6789069,4,B00P82BGYY,"The concept of this movie was very good!  People dealing with Altzheimers in a loved one would benefit from watching it.  True, the acting isn't top shelf, but I have watched it more than once simply because it speaks to my heart.  The message the son sings about his father makes it worth watching simply because this mindset is so often lacking in us today.",1445558400,3,359,4.492307692307692

6789072,1,B00P82BGYY,"I'm sorry... I hate to write negative reviews, but this was a huge disappointment to me. I should have researched it; if I had known it was a Christian film, I never would have rented it.

It had all the flaws I find in Christian films. Awful direction, stiff acting, dialogue that is completely unbelievable, characters not remotely complex, and the cinematography of one using their cell phone. It was awful.

I did feel the protagonist could have done better with better material. The kids were fine. Dog was good. But the other actors? Ghastly! And the camera work was just confusing.",1438819200,,588,4.754901960784314
6789073,3,B00P82BGYY,"The reviews here look pretty dicey, either they seem fake or they are quite negative.  I watched the trailer, which confirmed for me that it seems cheap and faux feel good.  The main reason for this review is in the line from the trailer about ""the road to redemption.""  If he didn't commit the crime, why does he need redemption?  I'm pointing this out because it seems like it could be an example of sloppy, cliched writing.",1434931200,,426,4.4935064935064934
6789074,2,B00P82BGYY,"The five star reviews must have been submitted by the cast. Slow, it was so bad I felt bad for the actors who were in it. But I could only take 30 minutes of it, maybe it improved but I doubt it.",1434844800,,195,3.6666666666666665
6789075,1,B00P82BGYY,"An amateurish, poorly directed movie with a home-made feel. Stilted dialog, bad acting, and cloying attempts at feel-good emotion. Oddly, everybody in it comes across as likable human beings, but trapped in a high school play.",1433808000,,226,5.305555555555555
