1082748,5,6305807523,"This is a superb drama documentary produced for the BBC and starring David Jason and Maggie Smith. It explores the history of the raising of the Sandringham Brigade during the First World War - a troop of soldiers  created from the estate workers, grooms and gardeners employed by the  British Royal Family at Sandringham, Norfolk in England. The recruits were  shipped to fight in the Gallipoli campaign, where all except one were  massacred by Turkish troops.
A gripping story of nineteenth century  values exposed to the horrors of twentieth century combat",952905600,33,559,5.0989010989010985

1082825,5,6305807523,"All the King's Men is a fascinating if often horrifying portrayal of a little-known episode of the First World War.

David Jason takes a great part as Captain Frank Beck, who has trained a group of workers from the Royal estate at Sandringham into a company of soldiers. This role is very reminiscent of his earlier one as Skullion, the head porter in Porterhouse Blue. Both are essentially ""good and faithful servants"", firmly committed to the values of their social betters, perhaps to a greater degree than many of the latter themselves. His face is a picture to behold when he arrives at Gallipoli to discover the real conditions there, and perhaps the dawning realisation that said betters may have let him down.

With only a few lapses, the atmosphere of the period is well captured. Did anyone else cringe at Beck's question ""Why are we here if not to prove ourselves as men?"" I would probably count as ""unmanly"" by 1915 standards, but would have sought at least a slightly more practical reason. Beck displays a similar attitude earlier on, when he is utterly terrified that he may be denied the opportunity to lead his men into action, despite being clearly too old for active service. The scene where the 12yo telegraph boy, proudly showing off his new uniform, is upstaged by his 14yo pal who by lying about his age has acquired a real Army one is also only too believable for the time, as is Beck's remark that the young boy (whose real age he knows) is ""more a man than I will get to be"" if he himself is not allowed to go to war. Likewise the mobbing of the pacifist who was initially mistaken for a wounded soldier. His injuries were actually inflicted by real soldiers whom he had been treating in hospital.

Queen Alexandra makes a revealing comment when someone expresses doubt as to whether the pacifist was truly a coward, saying ""We are all compelled to believe that he was a coward"", presumably because admitting the possibility of any other motive might lead her and others into thinking socially unacceptable thoughts. The Queen Mother gets a number of memorable lines, notably when her son, King George V, tells her that ""Kitchener is confident of victory"". She responds ""Let us hope that his confidence costs us less in Turkey than it has in France"". It is rather hinted that she is more than a little sceptical about the whole war, but carefully concealing this as it is part of her royal duty to maintain morale. The King takes this attitude even further, when toward the end he cautions the clergyman who has sought out the real fate of the ""Sandringhams"" not to say anything that would contradict the morale-boosting story promoted by the War Office. Shades of ""When legend becomes truth, print the legend.""

There is probably more than a little legend in the film itself, though excusably so given the paucity of firm facts. The theory that the men were ""executed"" after capture by the Turks cannot be verified. The Turks were indeed disinclined to take prisoners, but any killing is as likely to have been done during the battle (""shot while putting their hands up"") as afterwards in cold blood. In particular, the portrayal of Beck's death is highly doubtful, since what evidence there is (admittedly inconclusive) suggests that he was killed in the fighting rather than murdered. But the closing shot, as the men advance to their deaths through the mist, is evocative of that unforgettable final scene in Blackadder Goes Forth.

One final twist, which I gather is historically accurate. The sole survivor, reappearing at the end disfigured but alive, owes his survival to being left for dead and found later by a German unit, waking up in their military hospital. The only ""Sandringham"" ever to see the place again owes his life to the evil Hun. A suitably ironic note on which to end.",1304726400,,3819,4.7368421052631575
1082826,5,6305807523,"I understand from a friend of mine that the story line of All The King's Men is not true to the actual history of Gallipoli. These Brits can ACT, however.

1082827,4,6305807523,"Once again, David Jason of 'Frost' and 'Only Fools And Horses' fame proves his versatile and superb acting skills in this one-off drama, which attempts to explain the disappearance of the Sandringham Division during WWI. While I am not sure how historically accurate this film is, nor how much dramatic licence has been used, it is, the acting from an array of classic British actors makes for a pretty engrossing drama. Included is a documentary containing black and white footage. Worth getting if you are a war drama fan, or a David Jason aficionado",1281312000,2,552,4.882978723404255
1082850,5,6305807523,"""All the King's Men"" is a richly textured piece of television drama, sensitively directed by Julian Jarrold. Its carefully nuanced script explores the horrors of the Gallipoli campaign in Turkey in World War One and the myth surrounding the mysterious ""disappearance"" of the Sandringham Regiment, who were drawn from King George the Fifth's estate. The men are led by Captain Frank Beck,the agent on the estate, who with the support of the Queen Mother defies the King and, despite his age, leaves Sandringham to lead the men who he has trained and whose lives he has been intimately involved with on the estate. Through the excellent performance of David Jason we see a man of some nobility of spirit,used to respecting his superiors all his life,trying to do his best in a situation where his superiors got it completely wrong. His idealism is nicely contrasted with the humane pragmatism of the regimental doctor who has no such illusions.
The truth of a body of men ineptly led and totally unprepared for fighting in an unknown and hostile terrain with appalling logistical support is graphically portrayed and echoes the much better known Australian film, ""Gallipoli."" The deliberate burying of the truth of what happened(which involved large numbers of men being shot in the head rather than taken prisoner)in order to protect social sensitivities and preserve morale is nicely dealt with through the superbly restrained performance of Maggie Smith as the Queen Mother who is clearly not fooled but never betrays the fact.
The film also sympathetically explores the social values of the English class system and particularly the close knit generation of Sandringham workers who made up the regiment. Their naive and in some cases romantic confidence in the right of King and Country fighting with God on their side(despite the fact that they were invading another country)is believably portrayed.
The perfornances of the cast are without exception of a very high class with some excellent cameos. This is the BBC at its very best and I thoroughly reccomend it to you!",1259193600,3,2073,5.0821114369501466

I feel it shows his nephews as quite pathetic characters but in fact they were very brave men(as were a lot of soldiers of their time) and they were later decorated with military crosses although sadly none of them survived the war.

1082857,4,6305807523,"A very well made, moving drama about the Estate workers at Sandringham who volunteer during The First World war to fight the Turkish in Gallipoli. Unlike the Mel Gibson Film, this focuses purely on the British contingent at the Dardanelles and the suffering and losses involved.
The legend of the Sandringham soldiers has it that a mist descended on them as the marched into battle and that they were never seen again. This actually shows the reality of battle, the distinct lack of glory and the shambolic reconnaisance which leads in turn to the inevitable result.
As the drama unfolds, we are introduced to the characters and have enough time to get used to them and start to understand and like them.
If war films are not your thing, believe me, this is very different. Worth a watch, especially the ever-dependable David Jason.",1018569600,19,832,4.825174825174825
1082858,4,6305807523,"It is unusual in the history of warfare for entire units to disappear without a trace and when it does occur, such occurrences are usually the result of serious mistakes that lead to the annihilation of one's command.  In American history, Custer and the 7th Cavalry come to mind.  Further back, the disappearance of the entire Roman 9th Hispana Legion in Scotland is another example.  In the British-made movie entitled ""All the King's Men,"" a more recent occurrence of such an incident is portrayed.  On August 12, 1915 at Gallipoli, over 300 British soldiers of the 1/5th Norfolk Battalion attacked into a morning mist and where never seen again.  Few of the bodies were ever found and none returned from Turkish prisons after the war.  Winston Churchill no less, called it one of the great-unsolved mysteries of the 20th Century.
 This film focuses on the ""Sandringham Company,"" formed mostly from servants, gardeners and other workers on King George V's estate of that name, which were part of the 1/5th Norfolk Battalion.  Virtually none of these men were ever seen again and the Royal family made great efforts during and after the war to ascertain their fate.  The main characters in this film are Captain Frank Beck (David Jason), his two nephews who are lieutenants in the company, a Sergeant Grimes, King George V and Queen Alexandra.  Beck is the main focus, as the fifty-plus estate manager who organizes and prepares the unit for war; rather than appearing as an odious ""Colonel Blimp"" type character, Jason wonderfully portrays Beck as a trusted father figure in the unit, respected by both the King and the troops.  Much of the early part of the film focuses on the lives of the men while on the estate, and Beck's efforts to go to war with them despite his age.  Eventually, Queen Alexandra lends her support to his martial ambitions and Beck is allowed to lead his men off to Gallipoli.
 Unfortunately, the film bogs down a bit once the unit gets to Gallipoli.  In reality, the 1/5th Norfolk landed at Suvla Bay on 10 August and was lost two days later, but in the film these two days seem to drag.  The fact that the British were making a major effort to break out of the Suvla Bay enclave is missed here, because the film shows the men of the company lounging about and engaging in mundane camp activities.  Some patrol activity against Turkish snipers is shown, but this has little relevance.  On 12 August, as part of a minor preliminary operation to clear the way for a larger attack on the next day, the 1/5th Norfolks and several other units are sent forward to clear out Turkish outposts.  At this point in the film, when the unit disappears in the mists, the director begins to switch back and forth between post-war investigations into the disappearance and a hypothetical depiction of what actually occurred on that day.
 Historically, the film is a bit disappointing in recounting the fate of the ""Sandringham Company"" because it fails to put the day in perspective.  The Sandringham company is shown in total isolation from the rest of the British army.  The participation of other units or even the rest of the battalion is not depicted in this film, nor is even the audience told what their mission was.  In fact, Captain Frank Beck did not lead the attack; it was his superior Colonel Beauchamp (Beck is never shown interacting with his superiors), who also died.  The 1/5th Norfolk lost 372 men that day, of which the Sandringham men were only 2/3rds of the casualties.  Even more glaring is that the British suffered about 18,000 casualties in less than a week at Suvla Bay during the period of the Sandringham company's brief involvement in the campaign; the disappearance of a few hundred troops in the midst of such slaughter and confusion might have made more sense given these facts.
 Obviously the men were all killed, since none ever returned, but the exact nature of their fate remained a mystery. This film depicts the Sandringham's as punching through the thin Turkish line in a glorious charge, but are then overwhelmed once they become surrounded behind enemy lines.  The Turks execute all the captured survivors, including Beck.  While this theory has merit, it is not the only possibility.  The film depicts the mist as obscuring the battlefield, but fails to show the heavy scrub brush and small trees that hindered the British advance and made it difficult for the officers to maintain control.  Another plausible theory, not suggested by the film, is that the 1/5th Norfolk lost cohesion in the rough terrain and the battle-hardened Turks destroyed the untried unit piece-meal.  While there is little doubt that the Turks were not taking prisoners that day, there is no evidence to suggest that the ""Sandringham's"" went down in a blaze of glory as depicted in this film (although certainly such a depiction is preferred to anything that suggests an ignominious end).  Perhaps they did, but the loss of the entire unit is more indicative of incompetence than competence.
 Despite these historical reservations, the film is very well done and provides a poignant example of the enthusiasm of men to go off to war in the early days of the First World War.  Although some minor characters, including a conscientious objector and a shell-shock casualty, temper the glorious view of war to some extent, the film remains committed to a patriotic depiction of martial duty.  The cost of such devotion is apparent by the end of the film, but the meaning of such sacrifice is left ambiguous.  Contrast this British-made ambivalence about the sacrifices of the First World War with the current American films that glorify the sacrifices of the Second World War.",992044800,68,5703,4.844329896907216
1082859,3,6305807523,"In the vein of ""Glory,"" All the King's Men is about a regimen of ill-fated soldiers who meet their demise during a military offensive.

They seem two-dimensional, excepting Emma Cunniffe's character as the new bride and Ian McDiarmid's performance as the Reverend who was willing to lie to protect the mentality of the sole survivor of this regimen.
