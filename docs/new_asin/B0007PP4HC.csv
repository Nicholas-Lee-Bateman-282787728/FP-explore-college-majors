8050442,1,B0007PP4HC,"This video was not at all what I expected based on the cover, the description, and the title.  You'd think there would be at least some content related to actual cutting?  Not so.  This is only a very cursory description of a certain style of Iaido (sword drawing).  Does not at all delve into actual cutting techniques nor is any even demonstrated in the video.  Interesting since the cover photo shows him performing tameshigiri.  If you are already a student of Iaido there really isn't anything to be gained from this video even if you are a beginner.",1291507200,7,555,4.612244897959184
8050443,4,B0007PP4HC,I have just recently purchased this DVD and find that it is a very well explained and set out DVD for anyone who has no access to a teacher of Toyama Ryu and wishes to learn on their own. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that some of the filming is a little bit hazy. But overall a good well set out DVD.,1153526400,4,325,3.657142857142857
8050444,4,B0007PP4HC,"In this work, the authors describe in detail the swordsmanship of the Toyama Ryu, which was the official sword curriculum of the Japanese Military up until WWII. As the title suggests, they present the material very directly without mystification, which makes it a very practical guide especially when read along side the DVD version of the same name (availble through Actionflex.com). There is much in the way of insightful advice throughout. The pictures demonstrating the techniques are a little grainy (why my rating is 4 rather than 5 stars), but clear enough to understand. Overall, a very good guide to this very practical style of Japanese swordsmanship.",1122595200,4,662,5.196261682242991
