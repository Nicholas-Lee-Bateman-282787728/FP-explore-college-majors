7442736,4,B015N12RW4,"""Mississippi Grind"" (2015 release; 108 min.) brings the story of two gamblers. As the movie opens, we see how a guy (we later learn his name is Gerry) walks into a local casino in Dubuque, Iowa. He must be a regular as everyone knows him. But at his poker table, there is one new face, a younger guy named Curtis. Gerry is in real estate and way down on his luck. Curtis oozes charm and confidence. They bit it off nicely, and on a whim, decide to drive to New Orleans to enter into a 'big game' (buy-in price is $25K). To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writers-directors (and real life partners) Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (they previously brought us ""It's Kind Of a Funny Story""). Here they tackle the subject matter of gambling, and more precisely the addition to gambling. Combine that with the road movie angle, and you've got yourself an update to ""California Split"" of yesteryear. That aside, the movie is really a character study. Gerry (played by Ben Mendelsohn) is someone who you feel sorry for, although he is not quite the 'loveable loser'. At one point he goes to visit his ex-wife in Little Rock, and you can just feel the devastation set in when he learns she has remarried and didn't even tell him. Ryan Reynolds is perfect as the confidence-oozing Curtis. ""You'll be my lucky charm"" Gerry tells Curtis as they hit the road to New Orleans. Sienna Miller is okay as the love interest of Curtis. As mentioned, this is a road movie, and we get the best scenery from cities like St. Louis, Memphis, Little Rock, etc. Kudos also for the outstanding soundtrack, which features tons of 'old school' blues artists and songs. All that sais, the sum of the parts don't measure up to the total of the movie, which lacks the compelling elements needed to pull me in.

""Mississippi Grind"" opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this past weekend. The evening screening where I saw this at was surprisingly well attended, certainly for a week night. If you are in the mood for a character study about losers in life who are desperately trying to right the ship, ""Mississippi Grind"" isn't the best, but neither is it the worst. I'd suggest you check this out when you have a chance, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.",1444176000,14,2438,4.576659038901602
7442737,3,B015N12RW4,"Maybe we're witnessing the rebirth of the modern gambling movie? Just weeks after Mark Wahlberg's remake of The Gambler, Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden are giving us another look at those who like to risk it all in Mississippi Grind, a film about two guys teetering on opposite ends of Lady Luck's scale. Fleck and Boden, who excelled with the Ryan Gosling-led character drama Half Nelson, won modest praise for the documentary Sugar, and were completely ignored for the underrated It's Kind of a Funny Story, have dealt out an enjoyable but not entirely successful road trip story of second chances and the fickle whims of fate.

The ever-busy Ben Mendelsohn stars as down-on-his-luck Gerry, a guy who seems basically born to lose. It's like he's got William H. Macy's character in The Cooler (another great gambling flick) hovering over his life at all times. ""I'm bad with money"" he admits mournfully, but there's a cheeky smile when explaining that he owes money to ""everybody"". His losing streak comes to an abrupt end when Curtis (Ryan Reynolds) sweeps into a poker match and wins everybody's admiration, most of all Gerry's. Who is this cool cat, anyway? Curtis is a total pariah but he's slick, charming, funny, and always seems to know the right thing to say. He's got confidence in spades, something Gerry may have once had but hasn't for a very long time. After a thinly veiled threat from his bookie (Alfre Woodard in a surprising turn), Gerry convinces Curtis to go on the grind from Mississippi to New Orleans, hitting all of the action on the way to a high-stakes finale.

While the film has elements of buddy road trip comedies, it owes a much larger debt to the shaggy dog gambling films of decades past, from California Split to James Toback's original The Gambler. To emphasize the point, Toback even shows up in a brief cameo and the scene has all of the musculature one would expect if he were writing the screenplay himself. While we see Gerry and Curtis bond on their journey, ultimately the film is about their self-destructive qualities, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. Curtis travels the country on a lark, stopping to visit the prostitute girlfriend Simone (Sienna Miller) he can't admit to loving. Meanwhile, Gerry is just a complete degenerate. At first we find his sad sack qualities somewhat endearing but that fades as he lies, cheats, and steals to feed his habit. Fleck and Boden fight to make him sympathetic again, but by the time Curtis has had enough of him it's a wonder he hadn't folded already.

The bromantic chemistry between Mendelsohn and Reynolds goes a long way, though, and the film is always worthy of our attentions. The gambling scenes have the energetic spark of high-risk action, and the dialogue runs fast and free like the spin of a roulette wheel. It's the somber, reflective moments that don't quite ring true. We keep hoping they'll find another poker tournament to enter when the guys start wallowing in their self-pity. Backed by a wonderfully bluesy soundtrack and smoky barroom cinematography, the film's aesthetic touches put you right in the moment waiting for the turn of the river and the roll of the dice.

Of course there's the promise of a huge payout at the end of Gerry and Curtis' journey, but Fleck and Boden don't seem to know when to cash out. Instead the film continues to play hand-after-hand, hitting the same themes repeatedly and passing on every natural point to wrap up. Perhaps they were waiting for the big score of a crowd-pleasing finish, but it doesn't really mesh with the film's somewhat downbeat tone. Mississippi Grind has a number of strong cards in its favor but barely manages to play a winning hand.",1443484800,4,3707,4.796557120500783
7442738,3,B015N12RW4,"A fairly effective character study, and Ben Mendelsohn is terrific, but I'm surprised director Robert Altman and writer Joseph Walsh weren't cited in the opening credits as this film is clearly a remake of California Split. I saw an interview with the directors and they said they doubted anyone could predict the ending in advance. Uh, not if you've seen California Split. From beginning to end, there are just too many similarities between the two films for credit not to have been given where it was due. Knowing it wasn't as original as it presented itself to be, made me like it less.",1443312000,,589,4.728155339805825
7442739,4,B015N12RW4,"Gerry (Ben Mendelsohn) is a real estate agent who likes to gamble. He is down on his luck until he meets Curtis (Ryan Reynolds) at a poker table. Curtis is also a gambler, but he just likes to have fun and has no concerns or obligations. Curtis and Gerry decide to travel down the Mississippi River and hit all the gambling spots along the way.

On the trip we get to know our characters a bit more, but there wasn't much to see. They have their ups and downs, but the film didn't go anywhere and I was wondering what was the whole point. Personally I've would have made it a little darker. Not bad, but this will not a film that will be remembered.

7442762,4,B015N12RW4,"This is a witty approach to the kinds of people drawn to gambling, their hot streaks and the lulls, and what happens when those two cross paths. As their relationships and superstitions unfold we find equal parts warmth and desperation in this film. I enjoyed it a lot.

Written and directed by Ryan Fleck (Half Nelson) and Anna Boden (Half Nelson), this is the kind of film that I am never really excited to see, but always satisfied after seeing it.  If you're a fan of Ryan Reynolds or Ben Mendelsohn, that should be reason enough for you.

From their opening scenes we quickly come to understand our two unlikely cohorts.  Gerry (Ben Mendelsohn; Rogue One, Bloodline, Slow West, Animal Kingdom) is a student of the inner workings of the hustle, and the silver-tongued drifter Curtis (Ryan Reynolds; Deadpool, The Change-Up) enjoys a glib luckiness that draws Gerry's interest.  After meeting at a poker table and enjoying a pretty damn clever joke revolving around Bourbon, Curtis and Gerry hit it off.

But Curtis seems less interested in actually winning than simply being entertained, and Gerry leans compulsively to the game.  And whereas Curtis strikes the match to make things edgy and interesting, Gerry is the powder keg for whom we worry.  You see good things always seem to happen to Curtis--but not Gerry, especially not when Curtis is gone.  But Gerry is our storyteller and we know a lot more about him than our mysterious charming drifter.

Knowing little about each other, the two embark on a journey.  We discover more about them as they do within each other.  Meanwhile we, as outsiders, gain perspective on what makes gamblers tick.  This film enjoys the superstitions of gamblers who pick winners at the dog track based on recent coincidences and desperately look for signs and lucky charms from their surroundings.

Ryan Reynolds is a more mature version of his last decades self.  He channels all the cutting charm that earned him our favor from Waiting (2005), Van Wilder (2002) and Buying the Cow (2002), but has now grown upsomewhat.  His charismatic drifter exudes occasional glimmers that smack of his touching performance in The Woman in Gold (2015); but most of the time hes just Ryan being Ryan outside of the confines of his typical raunchy comedy.

Much as the temptation to stay and try your luck with one more hand, this film has a slow but powerful draw.  I'd recommend it for a quiet Sunday afternoon.",1489363200,,2440,4.83855421686747

Ben Mendelsohn is the compulsive gambler for whom winning is ultimately distasteful, and Bryan Reynolds is the take-it-or-leave-it gambler whose poker face is unreadable because he does not care. The movie is accompanied by very good music, which adds depth to the Southern setting.",1482278400,4,511,5.320987654320987

7442953,5,B015N12RW4,"You know what? I loved it. Great characters, cool plot, and it was fun to watch. Well done. Ben Mendelsohn shines as usual. He is just awesome in my opinion (yes I spelled it out). I am a Ryan Reynolds fan on most stuff. Here I think he was perfect. His snideness from other stereotype roles doesn't come into play here and he really makes you like his character and therefore believe a guy like this would tolerate much less back a seemingly degenerate gambler like Gerry, making their friendship the default lynch pin of this film's plot not only believable but also highly entertaining. Two thumbs up as it were.

7442985,4,B015N12RW4,"This is a much better movie than the box office tally would indicate.  Ben Mendelsohn is truly fantastic as the gambling addict who in his mid 40s has not much of anything going, no genuine job (he pretends to be a real estate salesman but he simply goes through the motions), no money, no wife, no girl friend--not much of anything.  But he sure gets a kick from gambling.  One night he runs into another gambler, a younger guy with oodles of personality, charm and confidence.  The two set out from Iowa to New Orleans for a big poker game.  The bulk of the film shows their journey.
  Ryan Reynolds also turns in a boffo performance as the charming hustler.  We want to like these guys, we really do.  But they are just too broken, each of them.  They also exude a sort of loathsome dishonesty, to each other as well as to themselves.  For their partnership to succeed they must trust each other.  In order to trust each other they must be trust worthy.  And they just aren't.  These guys are gamblers, which means that they gamble until they have no more money to gamble.  Worse, they will gamble until they have borrowed from any who will lend, then steal or try to from anyone they might.  The older gambler's ex-wife for example.  They lie to each other on crucial matters.  They lie to those who love them.  These are guys we want to avoid.
  Can we have a brilliant movie about horrible people?  You bet we can.  But self delusion is always destructive and delusion to the degree shown in Mississippi Grind is deeply, searingly destructive.
  The acting and writing are first rate and worthy of our time.  The direction is competent.",1467849600,,1642,4.5
7442986,4,B015N12RW4,"Not what I was expecting and a very different and interesting take on two less-than-squeaky-clean protagonists.

The movie needed great performances and it gets them from Ryan Reynolds and Ben Mendelsohn ... Reynolds has never been better ... (and) Mendelsohn provides a 4-aces performance that nails every nuance.""  (Quoted from Peter Travers' review in Rolling Stone #1245, 10-8-15).  Since Roger Ebert's death, Travers is now America's most established and influential movie critic - if he 'raves' about a film, you can be sure this is great 'must see' cinema.  And it is.  I was captivated for every minute - it's not just a film you watch, it's one you just fall into.  The acting, locations, cinematography and script are way beyond the norm in an Indie film, let alone some drivel from the big studios.  And then there's the soundtrack ... from somewhat obscure early Delta blues artists like Memphis Minnie and Big Bill Broonzy, to more recent traditional Mississippi Hills players like Jr. Kimbrough and RL Burnside, to rockabilly stars like James Hand, the music is as important to the film as any scene, and I love that.

7443107,5,B015N12RW4,"One of the most remarkable and human stories to come along in years, Mississippi Grind serves as another feather in the cap of director team Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden and confirms Ben Mendlesohn as one of the best actors of his generation. The film is a very well written and deliberately paced character study with flashes of white-knuckle gambling excitement interspersed strategically among many scenes of delicate, humorous, and staggeringly poignant repartee between the two leads. Though often known as a comedic heartthrob, Ryan Reynolds has turned in some enthralling performances over the years (he was never better than the poor fellow who finds himself trapped underground in the nightmarish study in claustrophobia, Buried), and sufficed to say, this is his most nuanced performance to date. This, in another characters words, Handsome Leprechaun is the Dean Moriarty of the gambling world. He wanders into a small gambling den with a smile that offers a thousand good luck promises, and inspires a local gambling addict, with whom he soon hits the road, travelling southward. Ben Mendlesohn is phenomenal. His performance could be comparable to Philip Seymour Hoffman, if PSH let up on the snark/whining persona that characterized some of his most gut-wrenching forays. He is a desperate man. A man driven by fear and need. There is a moment in the middle of the film where he admits his money problems to a woman, and you can see such torment in his eyes, even as he smiles dreadfully, that your heart breaks for him. And yet, you want him to win. You crave it. Sure, the movies plotting might be a little too leisurely for some, and the symbolism at times a touch heavy-handed, but make no mistake, this is an actors movie, and a darn good one. That the neon glitz and seedy backwater vibes of the south are captured with such jagged, perfect clarity by Fleck and Boden is a welcome added bonus.",1463529600,,1910,4.88

7443135,2,B015N12RW4,"I've been a fan of Reynolds since I used to watch Two Guys a Girl and Pizza Place and have watched most stuff he's been in since then, but I struggled through this one and eventually gave up after an hour or so.  Mississippi Grind isn't the most exciting film in the world, in fact it's pretty boring.  Basically we're following Ben Mendelsohn's character Gerry around various dimly lit gambling dives and watching him play out his gambling addiction.  At the start of the film he comes across Reynold's character when Curtis joins a poker table, who is upbeat all the time, has ladies swarming all over him and prepared to take risks which come off.  Unlike Gerry though he knows when to stop and walk away. Basically he's everything Gerry isn't.  But Gerry has also found when Curtis is in his proximity that not only is he having a better time, but he's more successful.  Curtis is going on a trip through various gambling places in towns and cities along the Mississippi, Gerry owes people a lot of money and decides to tag along.

As I said I didn't stick with this to see how it all turned out for Gerry as it just got too boring.  I'm not sure if this was going down the Fight Club angle for Curtis or if he was a real person but really I wasn't invested in it to care on way or the other.",1462752000,,1296,4.304526748971194

7443383,4,B015N12RW4,"Mississippi Grind is a film about gambling  or more rightly gambling addiction. It stars Ben Mendelsohn (Slow West) as Gerry a divorced father who is in real estate. He has sunk pretty low and owes everyone money  he has the next one will be a winner type attitude.  Then he meets Curtis  played by the always good value Ryan Reynolds. They meet at a card game and sort of hit it off and lo and behold seem to be good for each other and their gambling.

What follows is a road trip of sorts which is punctuated by their need for a fix - that is more gambling. These guys will gamble on anything  even what eye wear the next guy coming out of the washroom will have on. Essentially both men are losers but ones who are both essentially likeable. The portrayal by both leading men manages to illicit sympathy for both men despite the warning signs that these men are self destructive.

**Plot spoiler coming up **

Now I really enjoyed this but it is missing something and that is the heavy dose of realism. Gambleaholics rarely quit  they just go broke. Part of this is shown by Gerry who will stoop lower than a snakes belly to feed his habit. However, the ending for me fell kind of flat. One of the recurring themes of the film is that the destination is the journey and it is for that self same reason that I am awarding the mark I have. This is a good journey  sadly the ending left it firmly in Narnia which was a shame and a dodged issue as far as I am concerned. I have known and still do know gambling addicts and they are wonderful people who invariably will lie, steal, rob  anything as their lives spiral downwards. It is a shame that the truth for the majority was glossed over by a feel good ending that spoiled the film.",1457827200,,1734,4.2560975609756095

I am not going to give you a replay of the film; you can get that info from many internet sites.

They go on an adventure across the country stopping at different gambling spots. Ben does the gambling and Ryan stakes him.

7443586,5,B015N12RW4,"There are a lot of gambling duo or MIT wiz gambler movies out there, but this one is my favorite, no Kevin Spacey required. The story embodies what it is to be free in America and how for some, the dream can happen. Maybe we are not actually as free as we think, but to think some people who have had a crappy life can actually triumph over misery is inspiring. Reynolds played the cool guy as you would expect, with his somber and desperate new companion as they race ""down the river"" and bet it all. There are nuances in this film that require a second look. I like to think that there are free spirits out there who can collide and ultimately do the right thing and not let avarice destroy them. Reynolds doesn't take the game seriously, giving him extreme vagueness at the poker table, while Mendelsohn bleeds desperation out of every pore and does the same through serious study of the art. They balance each other out in this story, make each other stronger, and ultimately give you goosebumps as they throw the dice. Take it from me, try this different tale of the gambler's life - the story of an addict coupled with an enthusiast who loves meeting the people around him and give this movie a try.",1455580800,3,1205,4.408071748878924

7443768,2,B015N12RW4,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I liked Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's 2008 film Sugar, about an aspiring Dominican baseball player trying to break into the big leagues. The writing-directing team is known for thoroughly researching their subjects and this time they have turned their attention to the subject of gambling. After viewing Mississippi Grind, I'm thinking that perhaps Boden and Fleck should direct someone else's screenplay next time around.

""Grind"" is not short in the acting department. The protagonists here are Gerry, a hopeless gambling addict played by the talented Australian actor, Ben Mendelsohn, who replicates a passable Iowan accent and Curtis, a ""professional"" gambler, played by the engaging Ryan Reynolds (seen recently in Woman in Gold).

The plot proceeds lugubriously as Gerry and Curtis meet one another in a Dubuque casino and soon become fast friends. Things get a bit interesting when a criminal inside a pool hall comes to believe Gerry is loaded with cash after the inveterate gambler can't convince a group of bar patrons to accept his $1,000 bet on a pool game. Outside in the parking lot, the man stabs Gerry after discovering that he's indeed broke. Fortunately (or unfortunately depending on how you look at it), the wound isn't serious enough from keeping Gerry away from his next ""pit stop.""

We also learn that Gerry owes many people money including Sam (Alfre Woodard) who reluctantly warns him that she'll have to have one of her friends come after him if he doesn't make good on his debts. Curtis however proposes a trip to New Orleans where there is a poker tournament with a $25,000 buy-in. Curtis agrees to lend Gerry $2,000 for gambling purposes if he does the bulk of the driving.

The two travel to St. Louis where they fraternize with two prostitutes. We learn that Curtis has had a prior relationship with one of them (Sienna Miller), but the sub-plot doesn't really go anywhere. Gerry ends up betting $20,000 on the river card in a poker game and loses it all but tells Curtis that he won. The two friends then go to Little Rock where Gerry pays a visit to his ex-wife and is caught by her rifling through her drawer, attempting to steal a wad of cash. She promptly throws him out of her house.

When attempting to check in at a hotel in Mississippi, Curtis' comp card is rejected and Gerry reveals he lost all his money playing poker. Curtis provokes a group of tough guys in the hotel bathroom and after he leaves, they beat Gerry up.

At this juncture one is left with more questions than answers. How does Curtis really make a living? Does he simply keep getting lucky like when he bets on Mississippi Grind at the horse track and walks away with a cool $5,000? And why does he place himself in harm's way at the basketball pick-up game, intentionally welshing on a bet so that he ends up getting beaten up?

Worse is the climax where Curtis runs into Gerry at a casino and Gerry makes a single $285,000 bet in a craps gameand wins! Does the degenerate gambler who earlier attempted to rip off his ex-wife by stealing money from her homehas he redeemed himself by giving up gambling and now acting responsibly? The idea perhaps is that because Gerry leaves half the money in the safe for Curtis, and doesn't steal it, the films' scenarists are perhaps implying that Gerry is soon going to go on the straight and narrow. But given his entire history of addictive gambling, is it really likely that he's going to pull himself together? The bottom line is that Gerry really hasn't redeemed himself at film's end and what he did to his ex-wife leaves such a bad taste in one's mouth, that it's difficult to root for him at all.

Ultimately Mississippi Grind should be a cautionary tale about gambling the Gerry's of this world more often than not end up on the losing side of life. Through a sleight of hand, somehow Gerry and Curtis get a free pass from Boden and Fleck, who are more enamored with the fleeting charms of their characters than the reality of their compulsive game of self-destruction.",1453766400,,4067,4.700842696629214

7443866,4,B015N12RW4,"Most movies about inveterate gamblers are pretty much the same because most inveterate gamblers are pretty much the same. ""Mississippi Grind"" is surprisingly different, however. It's a buddy movie about two frequent gamblers who hit the road to put together enough of a stake to buy into a big poker game in New Orleans. But while one of these gamblers will soon seem very familiar to moviegoers, the other proves to be quite different.

Gerry (Ben Mendelsohn) is a compulsive gambler who has lost almost everything he has and is in debt up to his eyeballs to a loan shark (Alfre Woodard). His problem is the usual one compulsive gamblers face, the inability to quit while he's ahead and the continuing ability to convince himself that his luck is about to change. He meets Curtis (Ryan Reynolds) at a local poker tournament, and the two men strike up a friendship. Curtis is everything Gerry isn't, good looking, glib, unflappable, and also smart enough to know when to hold them and when to fold them. Curtis agrees to stake Gerry in the hopes that Gerry will win enough to get them into the big tournament.

""Mississippi Grind"" is a showcase for its two lead actors, one relatively unknown and the other relatively unappreciated. Ben Mendelsohn is best known for his Emmy-winning appearance on the Netflix series ""Bloodline,"" and he has the look of a born loser to him. He makes Gerry completely pathetic, especially in an exceedingly sad scene with his ex-wife. But, he's not one-dimensional: Gerry has some good qualities that surface on occasion. Ryan Reynolds, of course, is quite well known, and, at first glance, his Curtis seems like a typical Reynolds character. But he too has a lot more depth to him than first appears, and his seemingly happy-go-lucky attitude about gambling is more complex than it seems.

""Mississippi Grind"" is not an easy movie to pigeonhole, just as Curtis is not an easy character to understand, especially in comparison to the more conventional figure of a compulsive gambler in Gerry. Surprisingly, the movie gives Mendelsohn more screen time than it does the much better known Reynolds, which adds to the sense of mystery about Curtis. It's only in the last half hour that the audience gets to see more of him and understand his motivation a bit more.

The movie has a number of added pleasures, including a great blues soundtrack and lots of sharp dialogue. Much of the film consists simply of the two lead actors playing off each other and exchanging some great stories. ""Mississippi Grind"" is a movie that plays even better the second time around, as audiences can appreciate some of the things they may have glossed over before.

Unfortunately, for all the enjoyable (and realistic) aspects of ""Mississippi Grind,"" the ending is a huge copout. For a movie that's 95% original and creative, Ryan Boden and Anna Fleck, who wrote and directed the movie, decided to tack on a conventional ending that simply doesn't work. Still, it's hard to criticize a movie that is so well acted and, for the most part, so creative. ""Mississippi Grind"" is like a long run at the dice table. It craps out on the last roll of the dice, but it's still a winner most of the way.",1452556800,7,3200,4.7898550724637685

7443944,3,B015N12RW4,"We cant lose. Gerry (Mendelsohn) is a down on his luck gambler and is in danger of losing everything. Just when he thinks he hits rock bottom he meets Curtis (Reynolds) and his luck begins to change. Faced with debts he cant pay back Gerry convinces Curtis to bankroll him during a road trip in order to win back his life. Along the way Gerrys luck again starts to change and he keeps digging himself into a deeper and deeper hole. Even though this is basically like all the other gambling movies that have come out lately I really enjoyed this one. Ryan Reynolds is a great choice as the smooth talking good luck charm and Mendelsohn plays the part of an on the edge addict that you feel sorry for and are angry at at the same time. That is a hard thing to pull off. The movie does keep you wondering what is going to happen and what Curtis angle in this is. The entire movie leaves you feeling conflicted and you are never sure if you are happy for the characters or angry at them. That adds an extra dimension to the film that really helps it. Overall, a very good movie that gets better the more you watch. I did like this quite a bit. I give it a B.",1445817600,,1154,4.15625

8733953,4,B015N12RW4,"This movie will depend on your tastes. Down-on-his-luck gambler Gerry (Mendelsohn) and his hot-streak buddy Curtis (Reynolds) hit the road for New Orleans, on the hunt for the big payday. Ryan Reynolds made this movie for me. He can do no wrong on any front. Do you like movies about gambling? There was a ton of things in this movie that you could find interesting and for me one of the best things was the budding friendship between the 2 main characters. The gambling doesn't really do anything for me at all but some of it was interesting enough that it reinforces my not ever gambling, really is a sickness or an addiction to be sure. Mendelsohn, in particular, can't stop he has to keep going. Ryan is his lucky charm but never pays any attention to him.",1511049600,,760,4.5144927536231885
