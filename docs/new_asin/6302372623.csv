8159679,3,6302372623,"Don Dokken and George Lynch are very talented, granted. But these videos are, how shall I put it......well, gay. I know it was the 80's and glam ruled, but for Dokken this image was just wrong.

On the video 'Just got Lucky', Don Dokken looks like a cross between the singer from Loverboy and Boy George. How much blush did he need? And my god those leotards, spare me.

And in the early vids we get to see George Lynch's ""skunk-do"". That's right. The blond dyed mohawk with dark hair on the sides. The 'San-Diego Chicken Mullet'. Thank god he dropped that by the time Under Lock and Key came out.

For the most part Dokken played decent music, but their glam image was a total joke, they just couldn't do it.",1123113600,,709,4.356060606060606
