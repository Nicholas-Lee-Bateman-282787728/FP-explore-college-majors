8120353,5,B000FBHSKE,"I will speak mostly about the major work in this three-part DVD, the Pique Dame, consisting of the entire ballet and an extended interview of the choregrapher Roland Pettit and the two major dancers (Herman and the Countess).
The interviews really gives you the clue to this work, which is based on the short novel by Pushkin, but the story is different from the opera of the same name, the libretto being written not by Pushkin but by another Tchaikovsky (not the composer).
As one reviewer has already noted, the short story of Pique Dame is a bit terse and abstract. There are three major characters (actually two, but the third has some significance and deserves some solo treatment in the ballet itself), viz. Hermann (Nicolai Tsiskaridze), the Countess (Ilze Liepa) and Lisa (Svetlana Lunkina). I understand that Tsiskaridze, while not appearing any substantially on DVD, was at one time a Bolshoi principal for over two decades, and Lunkina is also a female principal dancer, while Ilze Liepa can be termed a 'dancing academic' by this time, being the daughter of a top Russian ballet dancer and herself a dancer throughout her career.
I find Lunkina to be very capable and well-schooled as a classical ballet dancer, and she fits the bill of Lisa totally.  However, the real standouts in this work are Hermann and the Countess, and I seriously think that the performances of Tsiskaridze and Liepa here would not be surpassed by future generations.  The reason is twofold: these two dancers own the technique required of these two very difficult roles (okay, we can trust the new generation in terms of technical prowess), but the second reason really makes this pair the embodiments of their respective roles, and that is the characters of these two dancers.  As Pettit noted when he handpicked these dancers (he picked Hermann first, and Tsiskardize introduced Liepa to Pettit during the search for the Countess), Pettit chose their affinities as well as aptitudes.  Liepa has the right aptitude for the role of the Countess. The role is not traditional classical ballet.  There are lots of bodily twists (very difficult in terms of flexibility), and the role requires a tall and very thin dancer. The spider like movements create the aura that this old woman is fate itself, casting a wide web on those who inquires her for future. This character of a 'spider woman' is a powerful sorceress and a feeble old woman in one.
The role of Hermann is even more complex.  An opportunist and a seducer who ultimately loss everything in the gambling chamber, and a role dominating the entire show that calls for enormous stamina on the part of the dancer.  It is really hard to imagine anyone taking on this role since Tsiskaridze created it here.
The interview session also shows the great determination of both Liepa and Tsiskardize to make this possible by overcoming the numerous technical hurdles.  Tsiskaridze had a knee injury during this time, and his ability to muster all physical hurdles is by itself utterly amazing.
The second piece of work called Passacaglia is based on Weber's music and is an abstract dance, like Balachine's Jewels.  Among the many dancers here, a good number of them now form the major core of Bolshoi's top personas.  Pavel Dmitrichenko was also featured in this work. The group dances and the duets are utterly stunning.
A real value of money.",1432512000,,3381,4.895104895104895
8120354,4,B000FBHSKE,"This video was very enjoyable. Although the story is well-known, it is not usually accompanied by the music of Tchaikovsky's  symphony # 6. Well worth seeking out for lovers of both ballet and Tchaikovsky.",1350777600,,205,5.029411764705882
8120355,5,B000FBHSKE,"I came upon this ballet by accident. It is a magnificent production based on Pushkin's short story, The Queen of Spades. It is not the same as the opera by the same name. It is authored by Roland Petit and uses the music of Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony. Also included on the DVD is a Passacaglia--a most unusual short ballet which must be viewed to be appreciated.",1317945600,3,364,4.53030303030303
8120356,5,B000FBHSKE,"Both of these ballets were performed and recorded in May of 2005, in the Bolshoi Theatre.  All the principal dancers are among the finest dancers Russia has to offer, and the standard of all the dancing here is superb(this is one of the points mentioned by Roland Petit in the 43 minutes of interviews with Petit, Tsiskaridze, and Liepa, namely that the standard of ballet has been getting better and better as time goes by).
In the first of these, ""Pique Dame"", we have a ballet based on a story by Pushkin(the writer, not the ballet dancer!), which is extremely allegorical; basically the idea is that a gambler, Hermann(danced by Nikolay Tsiskaridze), wants the Countess(danced by Ilze Liepa) to tell him the future outcomes of some game of chance involving playing cards(that should give you a clue as to what concept the Countess represents).  She does not want to tell him and he has to force her.  She gives him a few good calls but he gets greedy and it does not end well for him.  Does this plot sound a bit thin to you?(We are told in the interviews that this story is quite different from that of the opera of the same name.)  Some Pushkin fans might really love this story, but it leaves me a bit wanting, but ballet stories often do, and fortunately we have the great choreography to hold our attention. As for the choreography, it is mostly classical ballet, but the part of the Countess has a very modern edge--her part is not even on pointe, but it is extremely expressive and interesting.  The part of Hermann is very classical, and, not suprisingly, it pushes the envelope of possibilities.  The music is about as good as it gets:  Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony(Pathetique), which does a great job in stirring the souls of the Bolshoi dancers.
In the second ballet, ""Passacaglia"", we don't have to worry about the story because there is none--it is an abstract ballet.  The choreography is completely classical and the women dance on pointe with plenty of solos and pas de deux.  It is quite gorgeous!  The only problem some of you might have is with the music-- the Passacaglia by Anton Webern(Igor Stravinsky's favorite composer!).  When Webern was starting out in the business, he actually wrote romantic music, somewhat like Tchaikovsky, but he soon realized the error of his ways and became a student of Arnold Schoenberg and became a proponent of the twelve tone system.  His music is among the most difficult for the average listener to understand and appreciate.  It takes many hours of dedicated listening(and some studying doesn't hurt!) to realize the beauty of his music.  Fortunately, ""Passacaglia"" was one of the first twelve tone pieces he wrote and it still possesses a lyrical, romantic tinge.  If you are willing to endure this music, you will find it rewarding in the end.",1151539200,23,2808,4.770661157024794
