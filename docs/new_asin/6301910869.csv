2752648,5,6301910869,"Awesome WM. The ME was a heated affair between Hogan challenging Iraqi ""supporter"" Slaughter. The retirement match of Savage/Warrior was nail biting to say the least. The undercard was very good to boot - one of the best undercards ever.",1019088000,,237,4.95
2752649,5,6301910869,"Wrestle Mania VII was the best wrestle mania ever! The other ones were wild but this one exploded into greatness! This is the story line. During 1991, when this took place, the Gulf War was raging in the Middle East. Back in the WWF, Sgt. Slaughter was the Iraqi sympathyser. Everybody was against him and to make things worse he was the champion. Hulk Hogan, the hero of the WWF, stood up for his country and fought Slaughter for the title trying to bring it back to American hands. Other matches include The Ultimate Warrior vs. Randy Savage in a retirement match, and The Undertaker vs. Jimmy Snuka. If you are a true American and feel extreme patriotism especially during this time, buy this.",1018742400,,696,4.620967741935484
2752650,2,6301910869,"I saw this show live in 1991, and the only match that really grabbed me was Macho v. Warrior.  The match had a great storyline, Warrior's best in ring work, and drama.  The rest was really uninspired, especially the thrown together main event.  Hogan v. Slaughter, well it wasn't quite what I anticipated for a main event back then.  It could have been Iraqi turncoat Brooklyn Brawler v. Jingoistic jerk Hulk Hogan, because god knows Slaughter was a jobber with a one-time shot at the big time.  The match was okay, but the storyline was disturbing considering actual people were getting killed in a war.",1007596800,,604,4.714285714285714

2752652,4,6301910869,"Wrestlemania seven has been considered by many to be the worst but I still enjoyed it.  The hype for this event back in 1991 was extreme. ROYAL RUMBLE 91 and the events that led up to this event really convinced me to see it.
2 matches really made this event and those were THE WARRIOR V.S.. SAVAGE RETIREMENT MATCH and THE WORLD TITLE MATCH BEYWEEN HOGAN AND SLAUGHTER.
Plenty of talent was shown in this event but the undercard matches were all fairly short.  I enjoyed the TAG CHAMP MATCH and THE OPENING MATCH.  Takers match was good also but every other match was under five minutes. Still lots of matches and promising action.  I thought Demolition should have been in the TAG CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH not the Nasty Boys.
In conclusion a good solid Wrestlemania nothing super special but some promising talent and some good matches.  Highly recommended.",987379200,,853,4.736486486486487
2752653,5,6301910869,"This is by far the best Wrestlemania ever!  I would buy this one.  I didn't think that the Hogan and Slaugter match would be any good but it surprised me, it was a great match.  No suprise about the out come of it. So I would buy it but I already own it.",985737600,,254,3.7547169811320753
2752654,3,6301910869,"Fans of the WWF were in for a real treat at WrestleMania VII, which seemed to be one of the most emotionally charged events of all time.  With Hulk  Hogan showing his patriotism and Elizabeth's return to Randy Savage, this  seventh installment is one great event and worthy of recognition.  Don't  miss out on one fantastic card.",965088000,,329,4.701754385964913
2752655,5,6301910869,"This was the event that got me watching the WWF, and I have been watching continuously ever since. WrestleMania VII was held in March 1991. The main event pitted the 'evil' WWF Champion, Sgt Slaughter against Hulk Hogan. Of  course Hogan walked away from WM VII as World Wrestling Federation  Champion. Another suprisingly good match was the 'Career Ending' match  between the Ultimate Warrior and the then ""Macho King"" Randy  Savage. The match itself lasted about 45 minuites. I say this match was  suprisingly good because the Warrior hardly ever has good matches, in fact  his only other good one was again against Randy Savage the following year  at SummerSlam 92. This event also marked the WrestleMania debut of The  Undertaker, who is MUCH different to his new 'American Badass' character.  The Undertaker took on and defeated WWF legend ""Superfly"" Jimmy  Snuka. Other matches on the card were:
WWF INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP:  Mr. Perfect VS Big Boss Man
WWF TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP:
Hart Foundation  VS The Nasty Boys
BLINDFOLD MATCH: Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts VS  ""The Model"" Rick Martel
""Million $ Man"" Ted Dibiase  VS Virgil
British Bulldog VS The Warlord
Greg ""The Hammer""  Valentine VS Earthquake
Texas Tornado VS Dino Bravo
Legion Of Doom VS  Power and Glory

2752656,5,6301910869,"I Thought Hulk Hogan And Sgt. Slaghtuar Put On A Great Match Buy Themselves. The Warrior-Savage Match Was A True Classic. Warrior Pinned Savage After 3 Shoulder Takles. After The Match Sherri Started Attacking  Savage, So Elizibeth Came In To The Ring And Saved Him. Savage Was  Reinstated At The Survivor Series Event Later That Same Year. Another  Classic Match Was The Blindfold Match Between Jake ""The Snake""  Roberts And Rick Martel.",960508800,,438,5.041666666666667
2752657,5,6301910869,"This tape was great, only having a few dumb matches, such as the rick martel vs. jake the snake roberts blindfold match and tito santana vs. the mountie. The opening match was high flying with the rockers and barbarian  and haku, the crowd was pumped. The Nasty Boys regained the title against  the hart foundion in a greaat, surprising match. Probably the second best  match in wrestlemania history (first is steamboat vs. macho at wrestemania  3) is macho vs warrior in a retirement match. macho hit four or three  flying elbows and didn't pin warrior, and warrior hit the gorilla press and  didn't pin him. Also, liz and macho were reunited. The main evnt slaughter  vs. hogan, and hogan regaining the title was great, especially since  slaughter was for irag and it was during the gulf war. It had a lot of  blood and great action.",924912000,,835,4.664383561643835

8173953,4,6301910869,"The tag team bout between The Rockers against Haku & The Barbarian was pretty good for a opener. The World tag team title bout between The Hart Foundation & The Nasty Boys was a hard-hitting,smash mouth match. The Blindfold match between Jake Roberts & Rick Martel was a slow,boring,dumb,pointless comedy filler. The match between The Undertaker & Jimmy Snuka was kind-of one-sided but still a memberable bout mainly becuase it was the beginning of the Undertaker's undefeated streak. The Retirement match between Randy Savage & The Ultimate Warrior was a hard-hitting,smash-mouth,entertaining brawl. The IC title match between Mr. Perfect & The Big Bossman was not great but pretty good and the same goes for the Ted DiBiase-Virgil match. The L.O.D-Power & Glory tag team match was a 59 second stinkfest. The Hulk Hogan-Sgt. Slaughter-World title match was a entertaining,bloody,back-and-forth,smash-mouth bout. The rest were ok. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1281398400,,961,5.287581699346405
8173954,4,6301910869,"The Rockers VS Haku and Barbarian: A great tag match and a great way to start WrestleMania. I loved this match.

""Texas Tornado"" Kerry Von Erich VS Dino Bravo: A short match to make Von Erich look good.

Davey Boy Smith VS Warlord: Like Von Erich, a short match to make Smith look good. Warlord did look impressive, even though he was anther body in the over crowded WWF of the 90's.

Nasty Boys VS Hart Foundation: Near the end of the Hart Foundation's run as a tag team, with the Nasty Boys winning the tag titles. The benefits of being a friend of The Hulkster.

Blindfold match Jake Roberts VS Rick Martel: Never a fan of this gimmick match. I prefer Martel but of course he wasn't going win.

The Undertaker VS Jimmy Snuka: The start of the streak. Snuka puts up a fight but 'Taker wins in the end.

Warrior VS Randy Savage: I never cared for this match. Savage had the match won but Warrior wins. How that turn out Vince?

Genichiro Tenryu and Koji Kiato VS Demolition: Tenryu was around alot for WWF ppvs in the early 90's and no one knows why. Again, I never got the appeal of Demolition. Barry Darsow was better was Repo Man and i'm not afraid to admit that.

The Big Bossman VS Mr Perfect: Could have been a good match if Haku and Barbarian didn't interfere.

Earthquake VS Greg Valentine: Valentine was pretty much done in his career. Earthquake wins in a squash match.

Legion of Doom VS Powers of Pain: WWF always had the best tag teams in the 80's and early 90's. This was a quick squash to put over Legion of Doom. Yes alot of these matches were to put over talent-Von Erich, Smith, Undertaker, Earthquake, and now LOD.

Ted DiBiase VS Virgil: Anther crappy match for DiBiase at WrestleMania; Didn't WWF see his potential?

The Mountine VS Tito Santana: Anther match to put over a new superstar, this time it's the Mountine. A super short match that didn't do much.

Sgt Slaughter VS Hulkster: Thru out the event, you knew Hogan would win back the title. This was the time of the Gulf War and had American written all over the event. The match was decent but watching Hogan win everything is annoying after awhile.

Alot of stars were put over in squash matches against stars who were on the end of there careers. It was like watching an epsiode of WWF Superstars more then watching a PPV. The event was during the Gulf War, so it had America written all over it. Hogan wins again-like it or not.",1235865600,,2411,4.400900900900901
8173955,4,6301910869,"From the Sports Arena in Los Angeles in March of 1991, this seventh rendition of Wrestlemania is probably best known for its ultra-patriotic theme amidst the first Gulf War crisis.

As for the matches, here is a ranking on a 1 to 10 scale:

1. Barbarian & Haku w/ Bobby Heenan vs. the Rockers: 8/10
On paper, this should have been a sleeper match, but it far exceeds expectations as ""Rocker"" Shawn Michaels demonstrates why he would become such a valuable commodity in the WWF's future. The enthusiastic Rockers win impressively in the event's kick-off match.

2. Kerry ""Texas Tornado"" von Erich vs. Dino Bravo: 3/10
In a quickly forgettable brawl, the ""Tornado"" easily puts Bravo down for the three-count.  Sadly, both wrestlers died approximately two years after this event took place.

3. The British Bulldog vs. the Warlord w/ Slick: 5.5/10
Plodding and very routine. The now-deceased Bulldog manages to overpower the Warlord for the win in this steroid-driven slugfest.

WWF Tag Team Title Match: (Hart Foundation: Champions)
4. The Nasty Boys w/ Jimmy Hart vs. Hart Foundation: 8.5/10
Surprisingly good!  In an entertaining free-for-all, the obnoxious Nastys steal the victory and the tag team championship from the Foundation.  Bret ""Hitman"" Hart would move on to the I-C Title months later.

5. Rick Martel vs. Jake Roberts (blindfold match): 7/10
Not seeing is not believing, as one would have to be pretty gullible to think these guys couldn't find each other in the ring.  Still, the match is worth watching as Roberts gets his long-awaited revenge on the arrogant Martel.

6. Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka vs. the Undertaker: 3.5/10
The Undertaker, in his Wrestlemania debut, makes quick work of the Polynesian legend.  It is a standard Undertaker squash.

Loser Must Retire Match:
7. Ultimate Warrior vs. Randy Savage w/ Scary Sherri: 10/10
A truly memorable classic!  The fiery Savage gets the most out of the Warrior's limited arsenal of moves, as they steal the show out from under Hulk Hogan.  As expected, the Warrior eventually sends his arch-nemesis into forced retirement (albeit temporarily) after surviving several of Savage's famous flying elbowsmashes.

Meanwhile, Elizabeth makes a 'surprise' appearance rescuing her then-husband from a post-match beatdown by an irrate Sherri.  Clearly, the Savage-Elizabeth reunion becomes the crowd-pleasing moment of the night!

8. Demolition (Ax & Crush) vs. Tenryu & Kitao: 7/10
The Japanese combo rather easily defeat the former WWF Tag Team Champions, as this would be Demolition's final Wrestlemania appearance together as a team.

WWF I-C Championship Match (Curt ""Mr. Perfect"" Hennig: Champion)
9. Big Bossman vs. Curt Hennig w/ Bobby Heenan: 8/10
The late Bossman exhibiting surprising agile quickness makes a pretty credible threat to the also-deceased Hennig's title, but still only manages to only snare a DQ victory.  Andre the Giant makes a cameo coming to the Bossman's aid after a sneak attack from Heenan's gang.

10. Earthquake w/ Jimmy Hart vs. Greg Valentine: 1.5/10
An Earthquake squash that barely registers on the Richter scale.  Enough said.

11. Power & Glory vs. the Road Warriors (Legion of Doom): 4/10
The Road Warriors always made routs seem far more entertaining than they deserved to be.  This one is no exception as the Warriors wipe out Hercules & Paul Roma in under a minute.

12. Ted DiBiase vs. Virgil w/ 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper: 6/10
Nothing special, as Virgil comes away with a count-out victory over the devious DiBiase.  Virgil and 'Rowdy' Roddy, however, share some solid chemistry in the post-match ""get up"" pep talk Virgil gives a fallen Piper.  Meanwhile, the WWF makes it clear who Scary Sherri's next storyline cohort will be.

If you want to catch a far better encounter (without the cheap ending) between Virgil and his ex-employer, check out Summerslam 1991.

13. The Mountie w/ Jimmy Hart vs. Tito Santana: 1.5/10
Awful.  The Mountie (Jacques Rougeau) makes very quick work of Santana using his trademark cattle prod.  Santana and Rougeau both deserved a far better match than what they got here.

WWF World Championship Match (Sgt. Slaughter: Champion)
14. Hulk Hogan vs. Sgt. Slaughter: 8.5/10
Much better than expected, as a bloody and battered Hogan finally thumps the despicable Slaughter (posing as a Saddam Hussein disciple) to win the WWF Title for a third time.  The show ends with another of Hogan's post-victory posedowns.

Overall, despite its lapse of good taste in the main event's Saddam-related storyline, Wrestlemania VII remains a solid investment if you can find a copy for a reasonable price.

Also, as a side note, you may find some of the celebrity cameos interesting to see (Lou Ferrigno, MacCauley Culkin, Henry Winkler, Chuck Norris, Marla Maples, Regis Philbin, Alex Trebek, etc.), if only to wonder whether they came voluntarily or were paid to appear on camera.",1116460800,,4890,5.1313131313131315
8173956,4,6301910869,"This was one of the best WrestleManias of all time. The tag team match between the Hart Foundation and the Nasty Boys was exceptional. The main event lacked quite a bit of speed, but it made up for it by making people hate Sgt. Slaughter.
The best match of the tape, however, is the ""Loser Retires From Wrestling"" Match featuring Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage against the Ultimate Warrior. For about 20 minutes, both wreslted their bodies out. Finally, Warrior gets the pin. Scary Sherri attacks Savage and his (real life) wife Elizabeth comes out and saves him, reuniting with him and setting up his comeback about ten months later.
The bad match: the late Kerry Von Erich vs. the late Dino Bravo. Within two years, both men were dead; they did not perform much better than that in this match.
So-so match: the blindfold match pitting Rick Martel against Jake Roberts.",1063584000,,864,4.728476821192053
8173957,5,6301910869,"Time to reminisce again. I will say this about 1991's ""Wrestlemania"", the WWF sure knew how to promote it. With Sgt. Slaughter playing the ultimate heel, an Iraqi-sympathizing turncoat, everyone and their mother wanted to see Hulk Hogan take his belt back.
I recall being invited to my grandmother's house to watch the pay-per-view with my uncle and his friends. It was great. I was getting to watch Wrestlemania, live, for free. As a kid, it was the greatest thing in the world. SORRY! Didn't mean to go all nostalgic on you. To me, as a kid, WWF pay-per-views gave me the same excited feeling that Christmas and Halloween did. Though today's wrestling makes me sick to my stomach, I have always been a loyal fan.
This Wrestlemania had Ultimate Warrior and Macho Man in a ""career match"" where in a sappy ending, Savage reunited with Elizabeth. Yeah, it was sappy but everyone at the house, that night, ate it up. I got to see the last Wrestlemania of my favorite tag team, Demolition. At this point, they were no longer the same duo from the previous year as Crush came in, shortly after and Ax left not long after that. I still loved them but even at eleven, I knew their days were numbered as they seemed to slide further down the roster, especially with the addition of the Legion Of Doom.
WRESTLEMANIA VIII. was a classic pay-per-view and I still love every minute of it.",1062201600,,1376,4.574898785425101
