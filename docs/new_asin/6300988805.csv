301926,5,6300988805,"This black-and-white version from the Forties is still to me the definitive cinematic interpretation of Dickens. David Lean and co. weave a visual and emotional phantasm that is true to the novel, yet compact and,  well, lean. The images of the film shimmer in one's memory and allow the  page upon rereading to fill even fuller. The love and respect for the  writer is everywhere, unlike the recent remake that goes so idiotically out  of control. I also recommend Lean's ""Oliver Twist"", and the more  recent ""Little Dorrit"", which is interminably long, but worth it.",928713600,8,568,4.936842105263158
301927,4,6300988805,"The world's first glimpse of director David Lean's epic vision is a landmark acheivement in the cinema. Never before had Dickens been  transferred to the screen with such cinematic skill, attention to detail,  and vivid style. Lean's unsurpassed cinematic eye, plus Guy Green's  Oscar-winning photography (a rare British win) transport the viewer  straight into Dickensian England. The eye is ravished throughout this  splendid production, (even if the creamy look isn't quite appropriate for  Dickens) but perhaps the opening scenes are the most breathtaking. From  Pip's visit to the church cemetery, with his sudden encountering of  Magwitch, to the escaped convict's capture, the medium of cinema has seldom  been exercised with such stunning brilliance. The superb yoking of image,  motion, and sound in these sequences create a tempo and atmosphere that  give this splendid production of the famous story tremendous appeal to any  and all.  The performances also create plenty of interest on their own;  character and very likeable; Finlay Currie (unknown now, but always  sensational) absolutely perfect as Magwitch; and Jean Simmons (the young  Estella) in an eye-catching turn, irresistably likeable in her snobbery.  in the screen-test stage; and Valerie Hobson (the mature Estella), who just  can't compete with Simmons. The music is only pleasant, but the art  direction (also an Oscar-winner) is a big plus. Last, but not least, the  scope, romantic heart, tight detail, and rich characterization of the book  is superbly conveyed in the film. Where the adaptation falls oh-so short is  the narrative, which, though most individual scenes are absolutely  marvellous, the sum of the parts slightly exceeds the whole; which is why,  though a great movie, doesn't quite match the hypnotic viewer interest, nor  the soaring inspiration of Lean's masterly follow-up ""Oliver  Twist"" (which surpasses this film in every aspect). Just so, Dickens  has seldom attained such heights on the screen, and it is even today an  unforgettable experience for fans of all ages!",917308800,7,2072,5.410658307210031
301962,3,6300988805,"Review of Great Expectations
Hot Toasty Rag, July 25, 2017

While this version wasn't technically the first, its universally referred to as the original adaptation of Charles Dickenss novel Great Expectations. If you don't know the story, it follows the journey of a poor young boy Pip who is sent to play with the beautiful Estella, by request of the wealthy and strange Miss Havisham. He sees his commonness in contrast to her delicate beauty, and resolves to become a gentleman when he grows up, so that he might be worthy of her. Theres a lot more to the story than that, but if you want to learn more, either pick up the book or rent the 1946 film version. The original really is the best.

John Mills plays grown-up Pip, and its hard to watch any other versionout of the dozens of remakes out therewithout comparing other actors to him. Plus, he looks very handsome in 1800s costumes! Young Pip is played by Tony Wager, and its as if the camera crew really found him in the graveyard as they filmed the opening scene. His fear and shame in the beginning of the film is intense; Im always amazed at the talent of young actors. Jean Simmons played young Estella, and audiences were so transfixed by her cold beauty, she became an instant star.

Another familiar face to look out for is a young Alec Guinness, as the young pale faced gentleman. The tragic acting of the cast, and David Leans old-style direction that captures the spookiness of Miss Havishams world, is superb. There have been so many failed attempts to recapture the magic of Great Expectations, and Ive seen almost all of them. I didn't see the 1991 version, in which Jean Simmons plays Miss Havisham, though. I thought that would be rather sad to watch. Save yourself the trouble of hunting down every known version, and buy a copy of the 1946 version. It will become your go-to movie on dark winter nights, believe me.",1500940800,,1891,4.588757396449704

301967,5,6300988805,"The story Dickens tells may be his greatest moral tale because each critical event is presented in life and death terms; the actor must risk his life to save the other. Pip does so in his first encounter with Magwitch, who finally dies in peace after receiving the glorious news that his lost child is alive and well. Even the horrific fiery demise of Miss Havisham can be seen this way, for it breaks the tragic bond she has imposed on Estella who begins her efforts at living a new life. In the same context, when Estella tells Pip she intends to marry without love or a sympathetic heart, Pip dies to all hope for a fulfillment of his life-long passion. The producers of this film have made viewing enjoyable by the way they keep the plot flowing and carrying us along . The acting is first rate with especial mention of Martita Hunt's sincere portrayal of Miss Havisham, so touching that we find ourselves in tears, at one with her in repentance, ""What have I done!""",1490400000,2,970,4.4858757062146895

I much doubt this treatment could ever be bettered. It is admirably cast, has wonderful atmosphere, is very faithful to the spirit of the novel and often to its details as well. I particularly love its Wemmick; and the young Alec Guinness is of course delightful as Pip's friend Herbert Pocket. Obviously, time considerations forced them to cut out quite a bit (including Orlick; but I almost never see Orlick in any dramatization). The big change is the ending: Dickens provided two, and the movie uses neither, going instead for yet a third ending: of the three, I actually like this movie's best.
The one thing I did not like about this DVD was that I could not find any way to turn the subtitles off. Subtitles are vital to me in operas and other foreign-language films, but I don't need them in a GREAT EXPECTATIONS in English. They are a very good quality of subtitles, but I still would have preferred them not to be there cluttering up the bottom of the picture and constantly tempting me to read them instead of giving my whole attention to watching and listening.",1463097600,7,1201,4.616822429906542

302067,5,6300988805,"I saw for the first time last night David Leans 1946 film Great Expectations, based on one of Charles Dickens finest novels.  I have read this great book twice and can say that Leans production is true to the original novel in spirit.  The film lasts just a bit under two hours, so Lean must cut much from the 560 page story, but he does so wisely and judiciously, in my opinion.

As mentioned, this is one of the finest English novels and let me say here that I also think it is one of David Leans best films, and that is saying much.  Lean directed The Bridge on the River Kwai, which I saw recently, and that is another truly outstanding film.  Lean is a great director.

Great Expectations at its heart is the story of young Philip Pirrips growth from a boy living on the English moors who is apprenticed to his sisters husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery, to a man who has great expectations.  How these great expectations come about is a mystery.  We think we know the answer.  Phillip  Pip  as he is called, is brought to the estate of a reclusive spinster, Miss Havisham, to play with her ward Estella.  Miss Havisham was jilted just as she was about to be married and now sits lonely and alone in her mansion dreaming of ways to use Estella to break the hearts of all the men the young and beautiful Estella meets.  Miss Havisham starts with young Pip and succeeds; Pip falls in love with Estella, who taunts and belittles him.

But a few years later Pip is told that he has great expectations by Miss Havishams lawyer. Pip leaves the blacksmiths forge and heads to London to be educated as a gentleman.  Pip, and we the viewers, think his legacy comes from Miss Havisham, but we are mistaken.

What I have failed to mention is that at the very start of this novel, while Pip was visiting his parents graves on the moors, he encountered an escaped convict, Magwich, whom Pip helps.  Magwich is captured by the police and sent back to jail, but he never forgets Pips kindness to him and later repays Pip with the legacy that allows Pip to escape the blacksmiths forge.

The mystery surrounding Pips great expectations is part of a deeper mystery involving Estellas parentage.  By the end of the novel Pip has solved the mysteries and is now ready to realize fully his great expectations.

John Mills, the outstanding English actor, plays the part of Pip superbly.  Mills shows us the confusion and insecurity Pip feels as he enters London society.  Fortunately Pip has a friend and roommate, Herbert Pocket, also wonderfully acted by the great Alec Guinness.  The entire supporting cast is up to the task of bringing to life Dickens great novel.  Additionally, just as we would expect, David Lean recreates perfectly the look and feel of the English moors and also the city of London as it must have looked in the mid-nineteenth century.  The film is shot in black and white, which seems to heighten the effect of the rain and fog on the lonely moors.

Most importantly, David Lean has gotten inside Dickens story and he brings it to life in a manner I think would have pleased Dickens himself.  As mentioned, Lean brings out the best in all his actors and his cast is large, as befits this long and complicated novel.  Few writers have brought to life so many remarkable and memorable characters as Dickens and Great Expectations has some of his best creations.  The casting in this film is just about perfect with Mills and Guinness taking center stage at the beginning of their long and extraordinary careers.

Readers of this review who decide to watch the film are also advised to get the book on which it is based.  Both film and book come with my highest recommendations.",1457395200,,3686,4.5477996965098635

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Sir David Lean's adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic is one of the most beloved British films of all time. Sir David Lean's journey began with GREAT EXPECTATIONS in 1939, when Sir David Lean attended a stage production of the novel adapted and directed by Sir Alec Guinness, who served as narrator and played the supporting role of Herbert Pocket. In 1945, Sir David Lean and his partners in the Cine Guilds of Great Britain, which was the independent filmmaking unit they had formed, with cinematographer Ronald Neame and production manager Anthony Havelock-Allan, within the Rank Organization, pondered their third production, Sir David Lean suggested the Charles Dickens novel and his partners concurred it would be just the kind of prestige project that could break into the American market and J. Arthur Rank put up the money for the production. Playwright Clemence Dane was hired to adapt the sprawling novel, but Sir David Lean felt it was a total disaster and the partners decided to screenplay themselves, as they had their adaptation of Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit [1945].

Sir David Lean went for a harder, sharper look and opened the film with a dark, nightmarish scene. Skinny, wide-eyed Pip (played by newcomer Anthony Wager) runs through the marshes to visit his mother's grave on a stormy night, when he is startled by an escaped convict Abel Magwitch [Finlay Currie]. Pip is overwhelmed by the  imagery and terrified by the desperate convict, who demands food and the boy's silence, and Sir David Lean shoots the scene is if from the perspective of this small boy, terrified and at the mercy of this dangerous world. It's a piece of pure cinematic creation, accomplished with forced perspective sets, especially the creaky church looming in the background, and glass mattes to create the stormy sky, the kind of ingenuity they would need to create a visually rich world on their budget.

Sir David Lean started the film with Robert Krasker, but was unhappy with his soft look and replaced him with Guy Green, who brought a starker look and a more dynamic contrast to the imagery. To enhance the perspective of the young Pip, Guy Green shot his scenes as a boy with a wide lens to exaggerate the size and space of the sets. The most visually evocative scenes in the film, however, take place in Miss Havisham's shadowy mansion. The true mastery of Sir David Leans adaptation lies in the natural accentuation of human drama despite the pervading influence of social satire in Charles Dickens' work. The sudden social trajectory of the young pauper lends an often cutting observation of the class divide and a distinctly well-observed social commentary on the time.

Summoned by the mysterious matron to Miss Havisham's shuttered manor, Pip enters a gothic haunted house that time forgot and finds an eccentric, possibly mad dowager in a rotting wedding dress, holding court in a musty throne room dominated by a decomposing wedding cake, a reminder of the day she was jilted at the altar. Miss Havisham has sent for Pip to become a playmate for her ward Estella [Jean Simmons], an impertinent young beauty with whom Pip immediately falls in love. Apparently, young Anthony Wager also fell in love with teenage Jean Simmons, and how could not a thirteen-year-old boy with stars in his eyes not and even played the hero in real life. According to jean Simmons, her dress caught on fire from a candle she was carrying through a scene up a flight of dark stairs. ""Everybody stood aghast, but young Anthony Wager came and tore it off me and put it out and Anthony Wager was the one who saved me.""

Miss Havisham has developed an antipathy for mankind and though one feels that on one level she likes Pip she is also quite prepared to play games with him. She uses him in her quest to mould her ward Estella in her image and to gain revenge on men. Jean Simmonss Estella, here we find she is witty, intelligent and beautiful and she treats Pip pretty abominably but I was convinced as a child that she was good at heart and liked him underneath, Im not quite sure what this says about me! I was a lonely and romantic child but those scenes still enchant me, so much so that I feel Valerie Hobson as the bland older Estella simply doesnt have the same magical appeal of Ms. Jean Simmons.

Valerie Hobson (who just happened to be married to producer Anthony Havelock-Allan) plays the grown Estella, trained by Miss Havisham to be a heartless social mercenary, and the major supporting roles were filled out by some of the most striking character actors in Britain, like Finlay Currie as the convict Abel Magwitch, Bernard Miles as Pip's guardian Joe Gargery and the imposing Francis L. Sullivan as the decidedly humourless lawyer Mr. Jaggers, a role he played in the 1934 Hollywood version of the novel. Martita Hunt reprised her role as Miss Havisham from Sir Alec Guinness's stage production, and they say her imperious portrayal was magnificent.

Rather than try to condense the whole novel into a rushed journey through the plot, they focused on the integrity of Pip's story and his defining scenes and pared away plot elements and supporting characters that didn't serve his dramatic journey. Much of the dialogue was taken directly from the novel. Cecil McGivern and Kay Walsh were brought in when Lean left to work on Brief Encounter [1945], with Kay Walsh credited for coming up with the ending of the film, because Charles Dickens had written two endings for the novel, neither of which Cecil McGivern and Kay Walsh found particularly effective for a cinematic treatment.

The adaptation by Sir David Lean and his collaborators is a model of intelligent adaptation, rich with character and atmosphere yet focused firmly on the journey of Pip, from young orphan on the Kent marshes to a young man in London society. Sir David Lean fills GREAT EXPECTATIONS with a wealth of visual detail and vivid characters and personalities without allowing them to swamp his hero, and he directs with a warmth and humour often missed in such costume dramas and reverent literary adaptations. Though greatly pared down, this third screen version of Charles Dickens' novel remains to this day the quintessential cinematic incarnation. In terms of the sheer scope and grandeur of Sir David Leans work his adaptation of GREAT EXPECTATIONS is a consistent and undeniable hit. With a cast of such prolific talent, the film succeeds in becoming an enduring classic whose influence in further big-screen adaptations of the writer's work are there for all to see.

If you haven't seen or experienced GREAT EXPECTATIONS yet, I thoroughly recommend it. Again, simply consider the opening scenes, as the young Pip [Anthony Wager] is rushing home through a marshy landscape, entering a churchyard in which he is menaced by escaped convict Abel Magwitch who accosts him for food from Pips home, telling him with delicious relish that if Pip were to tell his guardians of Abel Magwitchs existence that a certain young man of his acquaintance and one with a taste for eating livers no less and will creep into the house and wreak revenge. Pip being a polite boy treats Abel Magwitch with respect despite being scared out of his wits and it is from this startling beginning that the plot of the film unfolds. It isn't just the wonderful performances or the spectacular landscape, with gibbets limned against the horizon, or the fantastic dialogue or the magnificent cinematography and editing that makes it work, its all of those and more. Theres a beauty in this film that never fails to move and its funny and scary and wrenching too.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The ITV Studios Home Entertainment UK Release of GREAT EXPECTATIONS is faithfully presented in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio with a competent, technically proficient 1080p encoded image transfer. First and foremost, blacks are decent, whites don't wash out the image, and midrange greys imbue the image with fairly impressive depth. Detail is the highlight of the transfer with fine textures, crisp edges, and plenty of minute surprises that are muddled and blurred on The Criterion Collection inferior DVD. Contrast wavers slightly, but is generally a good solid and bright, especially considering the age of the film. If I have any major complaints, its that black levels are never fully resolved, quite a bit of detail is lost in the heaviest shadows, still, the fact that ITV didn't employ edge enhancement, especially with DNR [Digital Noise Reduction], or any other meddling post-processing technique is a definite plus. The image is largely free of annoying artefacts and source noise, allowing the transfer to deliver a clean and attractive presentation of the film, but sadly now and again fine white lines running on the left hand side of the screen that appearing now and again, but despite this, it does not spoil your viewing enjoyment. Sir David Leans GREAT EXPECTATIONS still thoroughly outshines the 1999  The Criterion Collection inferior DVD release and offers fans the best looking version of the film available to date.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The ITV Studios Home Entertainment UK Release of GREAT EXPECTATIONS is presented with a 2.0 Dolby Digital Mono Audio track, that is a faithful representation of the original audio source. Low-end sounds are flat, dynamics are dull, and treble tones don't have the strength to stand out in the limited mix. Dialogue is crisp and well prioritised, but there's really no reason it shouldnt be. Still, Id rather hear this authentic mono presentation, than sit through a horrible updated poor 5.1 remix and again it is paramount to purchase this UK Release from ITV Studios Home Entertainment Blu-ray release, as there is unlikely not going to get an upgraded release for the USA market. Again this ITV Studios Home Entertainment Blu-ray release offers a totally rich and rewarding mono audio track, as I am very happy and very pleased with this UK Releases audio presentation. So anyone purchasing this particular Blu-ray UK Release will be very well rewarded.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: Unfortunately, this ITV Studios Home Entertainment UK Release Blu-ray does not offer any supplemental materials.

Finally, The ITV Studios Home Entertainment UK Release of GREAT EXPECTATIONS is true to the faithfulness of the period the novel was set in. The film GREAT EXPECTATIONS itself is a wonderful adaptation of Charles Dickens classic novel, the video transfer delivers an impressive rich Black-and-White rendering of its source, and the mono audio track sounds as good as when the 1946 film was originally released. Sure, the disc doesnt have any supplements and you do have to have an appreciation of older cinema to enjoy the film, but this is a classic in every sense of the word. For those in the North American region, it is well worth purchasing this well-produced Blu-ray, especially as it is an All Region release that probably will not receive a USA domestic release anytime in the near future. Highly Recommended!

Nor had I seen a movie version of the book before. So the daddy, mom, teen-ager and the 6 month old grandson of our other girl piled we piled up in the bed to watch this movie. Baby went to sleep. Teen-ager went to sleep and Daddy went to sleep. Me, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was a delight. I am going to read the book next. The actors were great. The story was amazing. I love the names that Mr. Charles Dickens gives to the people in his books. Pip, of course, was the main man and both actors who played him did quite well. I was astounded by Miss Haversham and felt really bad when she burned herself up. That was a bad part. Estella as a young girl was beautiful Jean Simmons and the actress who played Estella later on was very good, too. I had forgotten how much I used to like Charles Dickens works in school so now I want to read all his books again that I have read and latch on to the ones I have missed. I want to watch the older version movies, too. I loved Pip's hats. They were great. I also liked the fat lawyer who washed and scrubbed his hands in the bowl of water. I just liked the entire movie and plan on watching it again when my girl is a little more awake. I had a wonderful evening thanks to this movie.

It was a fabulous production with excellent acting and directing, and a good looking bluray disc as well, yet there were far too many predictable--and much too coincidental--plot twists for me (which I can't blame the filmmaker for. This was a problem I had with Dickens' original novel too--the only novel of his I didn't go for).

Perhaps, because this was the one Dickens novel I have never cared for, I didn't fall under the spell of this film which was based upon it either.

I can say the following, though:

If you had issues with the book, this film certainly won't fix them for you.

On the other hand, if you loved the book--and, in all fairness, I must admit that the majority of Dickens fans seem to--then, please, ignore my personal opinion of the film and make your own decision about it. You may love it too.

302292,4,6300988805,"""Great Expectations"" skillfully boils down Charles Dickens' venerable novel into a very manageable 2 hour movie. The black and white setting blends in perfectly with the story line. There should be no need here for any plot retelling since this one is so well known.

This reviewer thought the strongest performances were from a young Jean Simmons, as Pip's childhood tormentor and Francis L. Sullivan, in the role of Mr. Jaggers, the cynical lawyer. The key role of the convict is played by Finlay Currie. John Mills, in the lead as the grown up Pip, is a tad long in the tooth for the part but manages a solid performance. Didn't the Brits have a wonderful group of leading and character actor/actresses back then? This viewer was unable to identify Bernard Miles, who so many of us remember as ""M"", Sean Connery's stiff upper lip boss in the early James Bond movies. As a side comment, this reviewer was fascinated to read that Dickens actually provided his publisher with a variety of endings. How very modern. Did they employ focus groups back then?

""Great Expectations"" is an enjoyable, professionally produced old school movie for all ages.  As we know, that school has been out of session for some time.

Lean, the architect of such larger-than-life movie excursions as Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, delves deeply into Dickens' masterwork and comes up with one of the most poignant and visceral adaptations of the author's work. Bar none - the exemplar by which most any adaptation done since owes an immeasurable debt of gratitude.

The miscasting of John Mills as a 20-year-old Pip has been duly remarked upon: he's also unbelievably stiff, for a young snob who's acquired the social graces, in the scene of Joe's London visit, but it could be lived with.  What couldn't, for me, was the reappearance of Estella in the person of prettyish Valerie Hobson, who lacked mystery altogether (her American counterpart would have said ""Long time no see!"" and offered him a stick of gum.) So I've wondered whether Simmons' replacement was a matter of contractual disagreement--she was on the brink of stardom in any case--or something else.

This is a great Dickens story, full of emotional ups and downs, following Pip from childhood to adulthood. Tony Wager is endearing as the sweet younger Pip and John Mills is equally sympathetic as adult Pip. Teenaged Jean Simmons is remarkably lovely as the bred-to-be-cruel Estella.

Years later Carole Reed made the musical Oliver into a movie which was very good. Despite the fact that he copied most of the camera angles and the sets from Leans film  it just does not have the punch.

A bit later, Pip is invited to a nearby mansion on an on-going basis - the spinster owner wants someone to play with the young girl living there as her attendant. The girl is snobbish towards Pip, but he's attracted to her anyways. Upon reaching age 14, however, he can no longer come - he's required to pursue a blacksmith apprenticeship with his father.

302445,4,6300988805,"This film is a treasure. Based on the Charles Dickens novel, John Mills stars as Pip, a young man who leaves the world of apprenticing a blacksmith to becoming a young gentleman of society. Mills is excellent, as is the whole cast, which also includes Alec Guinness and Valerie Hobson (and Jean Simmons as the love of Pip's childhood).

Director David Lean, before he started doing epic dramas such as The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia and others, was a master at small personal dramas early in his career (In Which We Serve, Brief Encounter, Oliver Twist). The black and white photography is used splendidly here, with sets that often reflect so much bleakness that black and white is perfect for them. There is so much atmosphere in every detail in every shot.

And it is all captured with incredible picture quality crispness on Blu-ray. The film hasn't been remastered but it is still an exceptional Blu disc to own. The audio is 2.0 mono and there are no extras, but I HIGHLY recommend buying this title.

This, Great Expectations (1946) David Lean - Director, has always been my favorite film version. Now on Criterion (1999).  However I have not seen a bad version yet. Of course there are about 18 different versions and I only saw a handful.

It would take a miniseries to stuff in all the best parts of the book. But this film caught the essence.

I was impressed near the end with Pip says ""give me some light"" - oops that was Hamlet Act 3, Scene 2. Actually Pip pulls down curtains to reveal the truth about Miss Havisham's lair.",1353974400,,811,4.212903225806452

If you go to dvdbeaver.com and check out their comparison review of this film, with two other DVDs, it is quite obvious.

 The other reviewer is correct that this movie has not been fully restored.  That should not prevent someone from buying the best of what is currently available.  Too many people are focused on the technical aspects of the disc than the actual movie.  Just because a movie is ""cleaned up"" that does not mean it has been restored.  If you cannot enjoy the movie in this current condition, I wonder if you truly enjoy the movie.

 Even though this is a British release, it is Region Free. The only ""feature"" on the disc is the trailer.",1337731200,2,817,4.422818791946309

Emphasizing the gothic fairy tale aspect without ignoring the social realism, the director builds one great sequence after another.  Every character is a masterpiece of invention.  Jean Simmons' Estella is perhaps the most astonishing of all: her cruelty is as surreal as someone in a film by Bunuel yet believable in this context.  Martita Hunt's Miss Havisham what will haunt you forever.  The actress' phrasing of simple lines: ""Love her....LOVVE her!"" encompasses all the twisted psychology in the world.  Alec Guiness's fop Pockett is delightful-- especially in his perfect mimicry of his earlier incarnation's boxing match.  Jaggers,  Wemmick, and Magwitch, too, are among the greatest characters ever to grace the movie screen.  No praise can be too great for John Mills' dignity and craft.  The sets, too, are astonishing in their balance of realism and fantasy.

302450,4,6300988805,"""Great Expectations"" (1946) was directed by David Lean, and based on the novel by Charles Dickens. The story is about an orphan named Pip (Anthony Wager). Pip falls in love with a cruel but beautiful teenage girl, named Estella (Jean Simmons), whom he meets when an eccentric rich spinster arranges for him to come to her mansion. This wonderfully darkly photographed film follows the young Pip from the earliest moments in the film when he meets an escaped convict in a cemetery to his time in London as he learns to become a gentleman at the request of an unknown benefactor, to the final scenes when he revisits the abandoned mansion with all of its dust and cobwebs.

This is a fine looking film, though Criterion hasn't given it the same degree of remastering it has as with its more recent films. There are still many instances of dust and sometimes lines appearing on the film. There are also no special features beyond subtitles for the deaf and the original theatrical trailer.

This film was directed by David Lean, and I prefer it because the fact that it's in black & white is part of the atmosphere and mood, when Pip was growing up, some of the experiences he went through were rather grim. For instance, meeting a convict in the churchyard, or being  harassed by his sister Mrs. Joe.

The beautiful scenes with Alec Guiness as his flatmate,Herbert Pocket,in London.

The powerful dilineation of class differences in the scenes with Bernard Miles as Joe Gargery. There is nothing to compare with this in the Dicken's canon. It is the high point of post-war British cinema. The best ever translation of a book to cinema,the best ever filming of a Dickens' novel. The great contrast between rustic honesty and urban shallowness of the two world's Pip inhabits. The recreation of 19th century London. This is better than the epics he later did,there is no time or room for self-indulgence,due to the tight budget and schedule with a complex tale to be told with no moment to spare.

Casting of Joe, Mrs. Joe, young Pip, Jaggers, and Miss Havisham is perfect. Jean Simmons as young Estella is stunning. Grown-up Pip and Herbert appear a bit too old, which is not unusual in 1940s film, but they are wonderful actors. The ending is a bit too joyous, compared to Dickens.

The Criterion group have made this from new 35mm fine grain masters to ensure absolute quality. Black and white suits the suspense and darkness of the drama - colour could not possibly add any benefit. While I had seen this two or three times over the decades, I was pleased at how taken in I was as the story unfolded. Have been amused at people's startled/shocked reaction in the graveyard scene early in the film. Lean did not need special effects to startle us into paying attention.

Famed film director David Lean offers us a starkly fearless adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel ""Great Expectations.""  Tonally very similar to its source material, it is also surprising in its sturdy execution, holding up very nicely to contemporary scrutiny.

It is cast with some of the best British actors of the period, from Bernard Miles as Joe Gargery to Francis L. Sullivan as Mr. Jaggers.  In a natural and wonderful performance, Anthony Wager shines as the child Pip, even outdoing his mature counterpart Sir John Mills as the adult Pip.  Mr. Mills is passable but oddly colorless and out of place here.  Being paired with the incomparable Sir Alec Guinness for much of the second half of the picture does not do him any favors.  Mr. Guinness is Herbert Pocket, the varnished human symbol of Pip's hopes for material success and he plays the part superbly.  Additionally, Jean Simmons and Martita Hunt give timeless performances as the child Estella and the haunted crone Miss Havisham, respectively.  Ms. Simmons' performance is perfect and makes the viewer wish that the mature iteration of Estella had been handled better.  Much like Sir John Mills, Valerie Hobson's character is undercut by timid writing which diminishes the extent of Estella's romantic danger to Pip.  Martita Hunt expertly walks the line between caricature and realism in her depiction.  Ultimately, she comes off very demented and her slow line delivery mimics the slow speech of someone who is dying.

This is a mature movie which has true potential to give children nightmares.  Despite Dickens' reputation as an author who has spawned many family-friendly adaptations of ""A Christmas Carol,""  parents of inquisitive children regarding his other works should screen this prior to letting their children see it.

Despite the few complaints I've outlined, this is a superb movie which deserves to be watched for true entertainment value and studied in film schools to the present day.",1263772800,2,1986,5.159375
302498,4,6300988805,"For much of my life I considered Great Expectations David Lean's most enjoyable film. I hadn't seen it since it appeared on Bravo in the 1980s, so I was very excited when I recently bought it at half price during a Criterion Collection sale. The early scenes of Pip's extraordinary encounter with the prisoner Magwich, family life with his shrewish sister and gentle Joe, and Pip's visits to see Miss Havisham and Estella still grab me in my movie bones. Lean's incredible facility for atmosphere in the foggy English moors, the rotting ship hulks, the graveyard, and Miss Havisham's dreary mansion are still magical. But when Pip grows up, moves to London, and becomes John Mills, the atmosphere recedes, the delightful performance by the actor playing young Pip is of course gone, and Pip's foppish attempts at social climbing are almost too embarrassing to watch. However it's still a great half a movie.",1252713600,,907,4.934640522875817

Pip's sister's death was different in the film than in the book, as was the end of Estella's marriage.  This is one of my favorite classics.

The print is uniformly awful all the way through - with scratches, blocking, lines, blurring of the image - it's clear that little or no restoration has gone into this. An old DVD version would be just as good.

When you view other fully restored titles on Blu Ray like ""Zulu"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Cool Hand Luke"" and ""Black Narcissus"" (see reviews for the last two) and the wonderful job done on all of the Bond movies (especially the earlier ones) - you realise what a horrible let down for fans this version is. Unfortunately, too many companies are jumping on the BR bandwagon now with oldies, because of course there's a fresh new marketplace for them. Note how clean the image on the box is - when there isn't a single frame on the disc that looks so beautifully cleaned up.

I learned to love Great Expectations through this film.  David Lean brings out the story in a wonderful way and makes the story clear and meaningful.  Both Pip and Estella are born from low beginnings and then brought up to be a gentleman and a lady.  Their relationship to the status is based on money and connections.  When the money and connections become tenuous, they are laid waste again.  To their benefit?  Maybe.  Great Expectations is a story of hope and social mobility in a society that has little of hope or social mobility.  It is a story in which all members dream of it tenuously while trying to ignore their circumstances and birth.  This film is wonderful, don't ignore it and if your high school students are complaining that Dickens is too difficult, provide them with this DVD.",1230681600,,977,4.622093023255814
302560,4,6300988805,"First, a word of warning to the modern viewer: If you are the type of viewer who cannot stand the overacting, dramatically altered 'Hollywood' ending, and absurdly ostentatious soundtrack score inherent to any film released in the 1940s, you may choose to look elsewhere for an adaptation of Dickens.

If, however, you are able to accept the limitations and imperfections of the decade in which this was created, you will see a beautifully filmed masterpiece. Some of the camera work in this work is incredible. The director shows a sensitivity to setting and mood unparalleled in any other adaptation of 'Great Expectations'.  Even some of the acting is brilliant, especially Alec Guiness's role as Herbert Pocket.

Diehard fans of Dickens, especially those familiar with the controversy over Dickens's two endings, will bemoan the way in which the ending is slaughtered in a way Dickens would have never allowed or considered. This, however, may be easily remedied by stopping the movie five minutes before it ends. Or one can grit one's teeth and endure it.

The film is also too short. Many of the best scenes from the novel have been cut, and the actors and actresses often seem rushed, which is a shame, since this makes it pretty much impossible to tackle the nuances of the novel's plot. Classic Hollywood apparently had four hours to spare on a movie defending the racist South, but not much time for Dickens.

All complaints aside, however, this is not bad. I have watched it twice since I received it three weeks ago, and I would recommend it, though certainly not as warmly as many of the other viewers. Superior versions have been made since. But this was not a bad first try at adapting a complex novel.",1225065600,4,1717,4.826530612244898
302561,5,6300988805,"There are some films, such as ""Casablanca,"" that should never be remade. David Lean's ""Great Expectations"" is one of them.

The cast--headed by John Mills as the grown-up Pip, and which includes the rotund Francis L. Sullivan as the lawyer Jagger (whose clients are hanged as a matter of course), Finlay Curry as the convict Magwitch, and Alec Guinness as Herbert Pocket--is pitch-perfect (although I always thought the excellent Valerie Hobson was a bit of a disappointment after the brittle hauteur of Jean Simmons).

This film has everything: humor, suspense, and a lack of the sentimentality that seems to have crept into Dickensian films of late.

Lean, who was to become famous for his sweeping desolate landscapes of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Dr. Zhivago,"" captures the essence of the lonely English fog-bound marshes with swirling swathes of grey in this glorious black and white film. The image of young Estella (a bewitching Jean Simmons) leading young Pip by candlelight up the darkened staircase into the cobweb-enshrouded inner sanctum of the demented Miss Havisham (the incomparable Martita Hunt), is unforgettable, as is the sight of the jilted bride's rat-infested wedding cake.

302562,5,6300988805,I watched this classic story long ago and had forgotten about it until reading the story again.  I had a hard time finding this old English version.  My personal opinion is that the English productions are much better quality than what comes out of Hollywood for the classics especially.  I have a sentimental attachment to this film because it came out the year I was born and has such great character actors and actresses in it.  As in other classical movies it does not match the book in the way it develops the characters.  Case in point - there was no development of Estella's mother in the movie until right at the end.  Whereas in the book it started early in developing that she might be the mother of Estella.  Still all in all it came through with a great depiction of a Charles Dickens masterpiece.,1202688000,2,809,4.5
302563,4,6300988805,"Dickens' tale of an abused orphan gets a deluxe production here with lively direction by David Lean, a shapely script by, among others, Anthony Havelock-Allan, some splendid performances (& a few clinkers as well) which is all served up in glorious Black & White by Guy Green,  The first part is so good it carries you through the somewhat disappointing second part.  The opening in the churchyard where Pip meets the escaped convict Magwitch (Finlay Currie) is so expertly staged it's thrilling & you can't wait to see what happens next.  Soon Pip is employed by an eccentric lady who has a fancy to see him 'play'.  She was betrayed & abandoned years earlier on her wedding day &, for her, time stopped that same moment.  In her great moldering house Pip meets the ward, Estella, who is being schooled to be a heart breaker of men.  Later a mysterious benefactor makes Pip a young person of great expectations & he is off to London for a new life, more adventures & perhaps discover the identity of his patron.  Anthony Wager is wonderful as the young Pip.  He doesn't have the creepy precociousness of some Hollywood child stars of the era.  His vulnerability is part of his appeal.  When John Mills takes over the part you understand what he is trying to do; play the part of a young man who doesn't know what to do with his new wealth, how to wear his new clothes or dine on strange foods with his new friends.  Play the part of a young man with no confidence.  Unfortunately Mills' performance has no confidence either.  Freda Jackson is his abusive sister with whom he lives along with his brother-in-law (Bernard Miles who showed up the next year as Newman Noggs in Cavalconti's NICHOLAS NICKLEBY).  Martita Hunt is the Miss Havisham you always wanted to see.  She gives a superb demonstration of how less is more.  Jean Simmons is luminous as Estella.  According to James Agee she is the first British actor to come to acting solely from the movies.  What she does here would be astonishing from anyone but from a teenager it's jaw dropping.  When Valerie Hobson takes over the role it's like going from Being to Nothingness.  John Forrest is young Herbert Pocket & when he morphs into Alec Guinness they are so perfectly matched you may find yourself grinning.  Francis L. Sullivan is Mr Jaggers forever.

A word of caution:  The character Pip's sister is so verbally & physically abusive that perhaps her scenes are unsuitable for children & young teens.  If you are a survivor of child abuse and/or family violence these scenes can trigger flashbacks.",1191888000,3,2563,4.682326621923937
302564,4,6300988805,"As I watched the beginning of this film, I couldn't help but compare the story to the only other Charles Dickens story I was familiar with: Oliver Twist. It looked like it was going to be another story of a nice, respectful boy being abused by nasty adults. However, as soon as the young boy turned into a man, the similarities ended. Poor Oliver had a lot of ups and downs but life was basically pretty good for the boy, ""Pip"" in ""Great Expectations."" Because of that, I didn't think this Dickens tale had the emotional impact of Oliver Twist, but still was great storytelling. The last 20-30 minutes of this film tied so many things together it really made it a satisfying film. From what I just researched, it sounds like the book was a lot harsher story.

John Mills looked way too old to be playing a 20-year-old ""Pip Pirrip."" In truth, he was too old. Mills was 38 when doing this role. At any rate, I enjoyed a number of actors in here, mainly three older ones: Martita Hunt, Findlay Currie and Francis L. Sullivan. Hunt was just great as ""Miss Haversham."" I found her fascinating in every sentence she delivered, all of which she did while just sitting in a chair. Currie was genuinely frightening in the beginning as the escaped convict ""Magwitch."" However, what a transformation that man made in this story! Francis L. Sullivan emotes convincingly enough to play the

To me, the acting took a back seat to Dickens' story and to the film's cinematography. Knowing David Lean directed this film, that Criterion usually produces nice-looking DVD transfers and that ""Oliver Twist"" looked fantastic on disc, I was paying as close attention to the cinematography, and I enjoyed it. The story wasn't that intense until the finale, which was very well done. Even though the screenplay is softer than the novel, most people say it still captures Dickens' flavor, and few critics had anything but praise for this classic film.  Lean and cinematographer Guy Green won Oscars for their work here, so you know it's not too shabby.

The combination of Dickens, Lean, Green and a fine cast all make this a classic movie that is certainly recommended. Don't make the mistake of choosing the insipid 1998 version with Ethan Hawke and Gywneth Paltrow. This is the only version you want to see.",1188950400,3,2285,4.705

Lean was also nominated for 9 other Oscars for writing and film editing as well as directing.  Two of those nominations came for this film in directing and writing, so my expectations for the director were ""great"".

The Film itself was nominated for 5 Oscars itself, one of those for best picture, and it won 2 Oscars for cinematography and art direction.
I've heard the film is considered one of the greatest of all Dickens films.  It is also on Roger Ebert's ""great movies"" series with outstanding company.  In his review he quotes the British critic Adrian Turner who has written books on both David Lean and the great director Billy Wilder and says how the atmosphere of the mansion in Great Expectations and its deranged occupant were inspiration for Wilder's classic Sunset Boulevard made four years later.  Turner also ""wonders if the early graveyard scene of Magwitch jumping at Pip from outside the screen didn't inspire countless imitations in horror films ever since.""  So my expectations of the film itself were ""great"".

The story is simple enough a young boy named Pip lives with his mean sister and her caring husband Joe who is a Blacksmith.  One day Pip's presence is requested by a wealthy eccentric woman by the name of Miss. Havisham who wants him to visit and play, but for what reason.  Miss Havisham lives in an old wedding dress, her mansion is filled with cobwebs and she hasn't seen the light of day in many many years.  A young girl by the name of Estella who is very mean and nasty lives with Miss. Havisham, she is very insulting of Pip and doesn't want to play with him, yet Miss. Havisham tells her in her ear you can break his heart.  Six years go by and now Pip is 20, although the actor playing the grown up Pip John Mills was actually 38 at the time.  He is delivered a letter by a lawyer by the name of Mr. Jaggers (who also happens to be Miss. Havishams lawyer), played by  Francis L. Sullivan, who delivers a memorable performance and my personal favorite of the movie.  This letter informs Pip he has a benefactor and is to be taken raised as a gentleman.  The benefactor is to remain anonymous until they are ready to reveal themselves, although we and Pip have a good idea of who that is, or do we?  Pip moves in with a roomate by the name of Herbert Pocket played by Alec Guinness (Obi-Wan Kenobi from Star Wars) and this is where the movie starts to reveal many of it's secrets.  Sounds like a great plot so again my expectations are high.

In Roger Ebert's review he says ""One of the great things about Charles Dickens is the way his people colonize your memory. I wonder if there's any writer except Shakespeare who has created more characters whose names we remember, and whose types seem so true to human nature.""  This is very true, I read Great Expectations in school and I am now 29 and remembered some of the story but I still remembered the characters names of Pip, Miss Havisham and Estella.

My expectations were great for this film as were Pip's in the film and both Pip and the film live up to and surpass there expectations.  This is a great story as far as film watching goes and is filled with all kinds of lessons on loyalty, true friendship, who we really are, revenge, how our choices effect our lives, that's just naming a few.

This is a classic and when I give a star rating I am rating it against other classics.

Highly recommend this to anyone, especially for children and families.

My 10th graders were spellbound by this film.  They saw it on a big screen from an Epson 720p projector with big stereo sound, which probably helped.  However, their reaction to it really surprised me.  From the first frame they were rapt, and it turned into one of their favorite experiences of the year.

David Lean's brilliant cinematography is partly responsible for this - the lighting and composition are absolutely stupendous.  Many people talk about the ""possibilities"" of black and white, but David Lean delivers them.  The film is visually stunning.

The film also does a decent, if not perfect, job of following the book; obviously some scenes needed to be shortened or left out entirely or this would have been a five hour film.  It is not so accurate that you can read a chapter and then watch it, but it is accurate enough that it is certainly worth showing as a reward for finishing the book.

I withhold the fifth star only because the actresses who play young Estella and ""grown woman"" Estella are so jarringly different as to be almost impossible to accept as the same character.  For instance, young Estella seems to have a nose from Sweden, while grown Estella's nose seems to hail from somewhere near Rome.  The actresses just aren't similar enough to sustain even the most willing suspension of disbelief.

The actress who plays Miss Havisham, however, is utterly perfect, and her whole broken-hearted domain is reproduced exactly as I imagined it from the book, right down to the mouse-gnawed, spider-infested wedding cake.  Her 25 year-long tantrum is shown as half-hilarious, half-horrifying, which is exactly as Dickens intended it in my opinion, and the actress captures the perfect blend of nuances in portraying this unique character as perfectly as she could be portrayed.

The rest of the characters are quite well done also, including the attorney, Pip's sister, Joe and the ""pale young gentleman.""  Even the clerk with ""The Aged"" father is well played, although the tour of his castle-house from the book is absent.  Pip himself is portrayed very appropriately by both the young and older actors, and never disappoints.

Along with the characters, the film provides an incredible amount of tantalizing 19th century detail, enough to keep even the sleepiest, most sullen student awake at 8:02 am on a cold winter morning.  All in all, well worth the $35 asking price, especially because, like all Criterion titles in my experience, the DVD transfer looks and sounds absolutely beautiful.",1166400000,15,2699,4.955555555555556
302641,4,6300988805,The characters of Charles Dickens's timeless tale come to life in spellbinding black and white that perfectly captures the book's tone.  Both Estella and Miss Havisham's characters are vastly sweetened from the book.  Estella has genuine affection for Pip instead of just seeing him as another person to manipulate.  Miss Havisham is actually concerned when Estella and Pip fight instead of being happy that her master plan of having Estella break Pip's heart is succeeding.  These changes allow for the overly saccharin ending that is greatly different in tone and plot from either of the two grim endings Dickens actually wrote for the book.,1150934400,8,643,5.153846153846154

302643,5,6300988805,"Having watched the classic movies Great Expectations (David Lean) and David Copperfield (George Cukor) recently, I found Great Expectations an unparalled adaptation of the Dickens story - both in terms of the mastery of storytelling, cinematography and more importantly the unbeatable cast of characters.

I first watched Great Expectations as a child on a small TV, the only face I could remember was Jean Simmons (16 years old) as the young Estella leading young Pip around Ms Havisham's house. Now as I watched the movie again on DVD, there was young Pip whose distinguished performance would still stand out nowadays. The heartbroken but still beautiful Ms Havisham, Pip's honest brother-in-law, his faithful friend Mr. Pocket (Alec Guiness) all are a delight to watch. Yet the best acts must go to the shrew and careful lawyer Mr. Jaggers, whose diaglogue with Pip on legal terms were impressive, and Pip's benefactor - a convict exiled to Australia, his face was unforgettable and his voice revealed a lonely heart.

Though many movie adaptations of classics, by Shakespeare and Dickens and the likes, are produced over the years, this 1946 adaptation is worth watching again and is not a bit dated. The B&W cinematography, actors in the 40s, old houses, deserted marshlands, a rare glimpse of a steam boat and a distant shot of the gallows have added a natural, nostalgic feel to the movie and created a convincing portrait of a story about a long time ago.",1129334400,9,1464,4.995901639344262

Thereafter the film is a gripping human drama and romance, handled deftly by a great cast and crew among whom stars Jean Simmons, Martita Hunt and Finlay Currie stand out, along with composer Leroux and cameraman Guy Greene.

302645,5,6300988805,"David Lean spectacularly transformed Dickens' classic ""Great Expectations"" into a worthy screen version.

A frightened Anthony Wager playing the young Pip is terrorized into aiding an escaped convict named Abel Magwitch from a prison ship in the marshes nearby his residence.  The orphaned Pip is living with his strict and impatient sister and her husband the kind hearted blacksmith Joe.  Pip brings the convict tools and food to help him escape but he is still recaptured.

A short while later Pip is summoned to play at the behest of a reclusive and odd Miss Havisham.  Miss Havisham's mansion is in a state of decay unchanged since she was jilted as a bride at the altar.  She sits adorned in her tattered wedding gown never seeing the light of day.  She has a ward Estella, played by a young Jean Simmons initially and later by Valerie Hobson as she grows older.  At first glance she becomes the focus of Pip's attention.

Years pass by and Pip now grown and apprenticed as a blacksmith and now portrayed by fine actor John Mills, is sought out by a lawyer Mr. Jaggers.  Jaggers played wonderfully by corpulent English actor Francis L. Sullivan, announces that Pip has an unknown benefactor.  Pip will henceforth receive an annual stipend and will be schooled into becoming a gentleman.  All the while Pip's heart yearns for Estella who has been schooled by Miss Havisham into being a heart breaker.

The ultimate revelation of the identity of Pip's benefactor sends the flick into an all together different tangent as the nicely conceived Dickensian drama plays out.

Lean marvelously captures the classic historical characters and settings created by the descriptive imagination of an immensely talented author.",1120953600,4,1719,4.985964912280702
302646,5,6300988805,"I must admit, this film was brilliant.  I have never been so captivated by such powerful acting, intense storytelling, and such beautiful landscapes ... all created in the 1940s.  The work that I witnessed in this film could rival that of most modern films today.  For once, the acting was perfection.  David Lean, the director, has this direct sense of finding the best actors for the roles.  It is as if the actors really want to embody their characters.  This was an acting driven film.  Without strong players, I don't think it would have had such a big impact on me, but everyone involved surprised me.  From the larger roles like Pip played by John Mills (flopsy, but filled with charisma and charm), to the smaller roles like Miss Havisham (Martita Hunt) and Mr. Jaggers (brilliant portrayal by Francis L. Sullivan), everyone seemed in tune, prepared, and excited about their part in Lean's masterpiece.  You just don't see acting like this anymore.  My mind's eye, from reading the books, seemed to even been excited by what they saw.  It was nearly as if Lean was reading my mind and casting accordingly.  It was impressive, honestly, to say the least.

From my previous adventures into Lean's work with Brief Encounter (a personal favorite of mine) and Blithe Spirit (another immaculate tale), I knew he could tackle the voluptuous story of Great Expectations, but what I wasn't prepared for was the gorgeous scenery and ability to capture the sensation of the film.  For many directors today, the lack of proper cinematography can sometimes ruin the themes or feelings of a film, and even sometimes disrupt the power of the actors, but for Lean this was no problem.  His eye for filmmaking is unmatched, and his ability to create is on of Hollywood's greatest treats.  Lean has this power to pull the right people, the best scenes (even with a black and white structure), and create the most intense themes that will continue to pull you deeper into a picture that you may think that you are not going to enjoy.  There has yet to be one David Lean film that I have found distracting or below par.  Lean's passion for creation is obvious with the work that he has done, which I think was rather visionary for the time.  You can see it in Brief Encounter, and you can especially see it in this film.  I cannot speak any higher of Lean because his work speaks for him.  If you want to see cinema in its best form, I always suggest a David Lean film.

Finally, this film's structure was exactly what this story needed.  While I will agree that it is a love story (and future adaptations would say it was more of a love story than anything else), Lean transformed it more into a story of discovery.  This is a story about Pip, and his ability to be a person that many of us long to be.  While some would have fled in the sight of an escaped convict, or at least turned them into the police, you see a very humble human going beyond that and reaching out his timid hand to help.  This is what will change Pip forever.  Even if we think we are going to loose that person throughout the film (when money enters the picture), we eventually see that Pip's honesty is true.  Lean develops more of a relationship between Magwitch and Pip than he does Pip and Estella.  This worked perfectly for me, because it allowed me to see Pip for who he was, and the heart that he had developed.  While I am very happy with the ending to this film, the direction that Lean pushed us was perfect.  The balance was never tipped and our foundation never broke, a rarity in cinema today.

Overall, I was more than impressed with this film.  David Lean continues to prove that he was a formidable director at his time, and I cannot wait to immerse myself in more of his work.  This film wasn't just about Lean though, it was the actors that carried it and built such a solid story.  The reason this movie is so enjoyable to watch is because you don't see the actors, but instead the characters that they represent.  They carry this film on their shoulders and never let it fall or slip.  Whether you have read the story a million times or just once, or even never, this is a film that will capture your attention and excite your mind.  I read a review that stated it was ""intelligent"", and I couldn't agree more.  Lean forces you to think and commands your attention.  I just wish more films were made like this today.  If I could have experienced cinema in the 1940s, I think I would have been a very happy man!

The movie is exciting and emotional because director David Lean allows Dickens to be Dickens on screen: Hollywood could never improve upon Magwitch and Miss Havisham and the good Joe and Jaggers and all the rest; these characters are played to perfection.

To which Mrs. Gargery responds: ""Unc-le Pumb-le-chook, that IS kind!"" The theft of the savory pork pie is noticed at dinner, when, as Uncle Pumblechook intones: ""You could lay a piece of savory pork pie atop anything you care to mention and do no harm."" (Fortunately for Pip, the soldiers arrive, searching for the escaped convict, Magwitch, and the ensuing excitement causes the pork pie to be forgotten...)Alas for Joe, Pip grows up to be, for a while, an insufferable snob, brought about by his mysterious good fortune, bestowed upon him by an anonymous benefactor. We are led to believe, as is Pip, that it is Miss Havisham (WONDERFULLY played by Martita Hunt-""Do you know what I touch here?

""He calls the Knaves Jacks, this boy..."" in utter disdain, as she is contemptuous of everything about Pip. He meets Mr. Pocket in the garden of Satis House, Miss Havisham's forlorn estate, with the courtyard clock set permanently at 8:30, the time of her doomed wedding that wasn't to be... (Enough House, great title) The two have a half-hearted battle, with Pip bloodying the nose of the affable Mr. Pocket. They meet up again as young gentlemen, and share rooms together, Mr. Pocket now a very young, very eager Alec Guinness, in a great interpretation. He endeavors to teach Pip the finer side of social graces, beginning with his table manners, interrupting his own conversation to remonstrate with Pip to be more moderate in his eating and use of silverware...when Joe comes to visit, he disgraces himself with his clusmsiness, in Pip's censorious eyes, and loses control of his hat, in a way that would have been funny were it not so sad, under the circumstances. Joe realizes the change in Pip and how a chasm has opened up between their friendship and love for each other; it saddens him, but he is still kind, and hopeful as he departs, and tells Pip to think of him back in the forge, where he belongs, and then he ""won't judge him nearly so harshly.""

Pip's turmoil when he learns the identity of his benefactor, and Estella's origins, (far more humble than she knew herself) is riveting, as are all the characters and their inner workings, diplayed in true, inimitable Dickensian fashion. The ending is wholly unpredictable and is somewhat of a letdown; you want something different to tie things up after all the drama and anguish you are forced to witness...still, it is Dickens, and that is how he chose to end this story, one of his best, although I prefer, of all of them, David Copperfield.

Together with her adopted daughter Estella (Jean Simmons (youth)/Valerie Hobson (adult)), she lives in a run down mansion, complete with overgrown vines.

Pip (Anthony Wager (youth)/ John Mills (adult)) first meets Magwitch (Finlay Currie) in a graveyard and gives him assistance by giving him the tools to saw off his leg irons. Pip never imagines that in this one ""good deed"" he will in fact be rewarded with lifelong happiness.

Pip is at first taunted by Estella and then later Miss Haversham tries to use Estella to ruin him and break his heart like the love of her life did to her so many years ago. She thinks of Estella and Pip as pawns in her cruel little game.

If you think this story can be better told in color or in a newer version (1998), consider this. The very setting in which this story unfolds is perhaps best told within the shadowy essence of black-and-white cinematography.

I first remember reading this story in a ""classic comic book"" as a child. It is true to say it is still as beautiful a story today as it was 25 years ago and even more beautifully told back in 1947 before I was even born.

There are some darkly humorous lines which you just can't help laughing at, otherwise, this is a rather serious story, yet very enjoyable to watch.

302684,5,6300988805,"It has never been easy to tranfer Dickens from the printed page to the moving screen.  His plots are all too often multi-layered, containing what today's readers might think of as an excessive number of characters.  Nevertheless, the very best filmed adaptations still retain enough of the flavor of the original to keep the movie's actions on line.  Director David Lean in GREAT EXPECTATIONS has created a moody, black and white period piece that perfectly captures the essence of how a young and fearful boy sees his bleak surroundings.  This element of bleakness, so evident in most of Dickens, is especially prominent here, both externally in the grim, forbidding exteriors of the graveyard that introduces the film and internally in the myriad of blows that buffet young Pip (Anthony Wager) for nearly the entire film.  As was common for most of his child heroes, Dickens gave them a juvenile view of a universe that was inhospitable for them.  Adults were often unpredicatable and cruel in a manner than resonates even today.  Young Pip sees terror nearly everywhere.  The escaped criminal, Magwitch (Finlay Currie), his elder sister Mrs. Gargery (Freda Jackson), and the weirdly dressed Miss Havisham (Martita Hunt) all combine to make Pip's existence full of doubt and fear.  There are only a few adults whom Pip trusts, one of whom is his decent and honorable brother-in-law Joe Gargery (Bernard Miles).
As Pip matures,(now played by John Mills) he now realizes that his initial perception of the universe as intrinsically unstable was essentially a correct one. What he does learn, at great cost to his pride and self-respect, is that he can alter the equations of this universe slightly by a corresponding alteration in his perception of that universe.  By the novel's end, he can see more clearly the inner natures of those who most impacted on him. Joe Gargery he now can see as the good man he always was.  Magwitch is a man whom life pushed down the wrong path only to later relocate himself on the right one.  Estella has had time to mature even as he has.  Thus, the great expectations of the title is itself revealed as having undergone a metamorphosis.  Pip has learned a brutal lesson: the measurement of greatness is a function more of the heart than of the wallet.  Not everyone watching this movie can say the same.",1041724800,54,2338,4.8686868686868685
302685,5,6300988805,"An Academy Award winner for Best Art and Set Direction and Best Cinematography in a black and white film, this 1947 version of the classic Dickens novel was adapted for the screen by British director David Lean.  I can understand why it won those awards.  Without the availability of modern technical effects, he was able to create a perfect atmosphere and sense of foreboding, keeping the mood and dark macabre feeling of the novel throughout.  He also kept some key scenes intact, the young Pip's meeting with the convict, the mad Miss Havisham, and the ghoulish atmosphere in the law offices of Mr. Jaggers, whose walls are decorated with the death masks of clients he had lost to the gallows.
In most respects, this film stayed true to the novel.  But it is impossible to condense Dickens into a spare two-hour film.  Perhaps it was because I had just finished the novel the day before, but I couldn't help but notice how some characters were missing, many scenes were eliminated, the ending was changed and the plot seemed an oversimplification of the one I had just lived with in the book for the past month.
Without exception, all of the actors were excellent, but I wondered a bit at the casting.  John Mills played the young pip who was supposed to be 20.  In reality, he was 38 years old at the time and, in those days before plastic surgery, even had some crows feet around his eyes.  Alex Guinness, who was cast as Herbert Pocket who befriends the adult Pip, was actually 32 and both of these gentlemen just didn't have the  freshness of youth that was so apparent in the Dickens novel.
Age didn't seem to matter though in the casting of the convict. Finlay Currie, with his craggy face and threatening bearing was 68, but he played the role as if it was created just for him.  Jean Simmons played the young Estella, her performance overshadowing that of Valerie Hopson who was cast as the older Estella.  Marita Hunt played Miss Havisham, exactly as I had pictured her in my mind's eye.  And Francis L. Sullivan's gave a perfect portrayal of the lawyer Jaggers.
Perhaps if I had let several decades pass between my reading of the book and my viewing of the film, the edges would have softened on my memory and I would have not been as critical.  The film was really good and a great way to experience Dickens through this director's interpretation of his work. It certainly is a wonderful story and  I've noticed from a bit of research on the Net that there are nine movie versions, three TV programs and four TV series.  I plan to keep on the lookout for other videos which might exist of these offerings as I am now fascinated by the story and by the variety of interpretations.

302688,3,6300988805,"The actors and the cinematographer all get 5's on this beautifully made film, but whoever was responsible for mangling Dickens' ending gets a big fat 1. I am afraid the whole film can only achieve a three.
The good:
Alec Guinness! It is amazing to hear Obi Wan Kenobi's voice coming from a handsome young man -- in pre-victorian london no less. He plays a deferential foil to John Mills' Pip, and perhaps Guinness' greatest triumph was in a strong character portrayal that avoids submerging Mills' somewhat weak Pip.
Other great portrayals: With Dickens, capturing the essence of character is perhaps the most important goal, and Dickens' minor characters are often the most enjoyable. In light of this, it was delightful to see such a wonderful Mr. Jaggers portrayed by Francis L. Sullivan, so creepy a Miss Havisham played by Martita Hunt, and both portrayals of Estella (the younger by Jean Simmons, the elder by Valerie Hobson).
The use of light. This is a black and white film, and it makes absolutely tremendous use of light and shadow without resorting to artsy camera angles. The opening scenes on marsh and heath are delightfully eerie; the contrasts of indoor and outdoor lighting, most particularly inside Miss Havisham's dark and dreary mansion are all both atmospheric and suggestive of a well thought out use of light as symbolic counterpoint.
There were a few acting disappointments: I thought Pip himself was portrayed rather poorly. Pip had to continually tell us he had become a snob; aside from the voice overs, it would have been hard to tell.
Magwitch (Finlay Currie) certainly looked the part, but I thought him rather bland in the end.
Conclusion:
As mentioned, Hollywood really mangled a surprisingly subtle ending by Dickens. If you buy or rent this movie, it has to be to see some great character acting, the young Alec Guinness, or to enjoy the use of light.

Alas, it doesnt fulfill its potential.

The chief problem is the casting of John Mills as the adult Pip and, to a lesser extent, Valerie Hobson as the adult Estella.

Transitions of this kind are aways a challenge for filmmakers. If theyve done their job right, weve already formed an attachment for the younger versions of the characters (here well-rendered by Anthony Wager and more particularly by Jean Simmons). And if they're not careful in the casting of the older versions, they risk throwing away that goodwill.

Thats what happens here.

Mills is adequate. He says the lines. He moves to his marks. He does what Pip is supposed to do in his scenes.

But this is more reciting than acting. His performance is as obvious as Pips new suits and lacks sophistication and passion. Its effectively like casting a Mr. Bingley-level actor in a Mr. Darcy-level role. Its not so much that I didn't like him  were not really supposed to like the adult Pip  as that I did not accept him.

On top of that, at 38, Mills was a good deal too old for the role. (Pip is supposed to be in his early 20s.)

This kind of thing -- both the reciting and the inattention to characters' proper ages -- happened a lot back in the 30 and 40s, but that doesnt make it any less disappointing.

Nor is that the only issue. A great deal of Dickens wonderful novel had to be pushed aside to squeeze the core story into two hours. This sometimes leaves the film feeling stripped-down and rushed  most conspicuously in the finale, where I had the sense they were trying to catch a train.

To be sure, there are nevertheless many good things about Great Expectations. (How does one not enjoy the pompous brevity of Mr. Jaggers and the rough bluster of Abel Magwitch?)

But its hard to take full pleasure in sidelights when the main attraction feels like a bitter mistake.",1517788800,2,1992,4.543417366946779
