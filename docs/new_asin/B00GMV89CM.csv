6091397,3,B00GMV89CM,"A somewhat draggy and repetitious film but with enough exotic, erotic and esoteric features to make it humanly interesting.  It takes place in contemporary times in an ""An Unnamed Mideast Country"" which strikes the eye as Afghanistan or possibly Pakistan based on the clothing and mountainous backgrounds. A civil war of some type propels the narrative and there are some interesting shots of a war-torn, militia-infested and dilapidated town populated by various idiosyncratic types --ranging from religious extremists, hypocrites, panderers, misogynists and war criminals.  It is most effective as a biting commentary on a stifling, brutal and unfulfilling marriage which the film implies may be ubiquitous in that part of the world.",1396828800,,735,5.553571428571429

6091399,5,B00GMV89CM,"In Persian folklore, there exists a magic black stone, Syng-e-saboor (the Patience Stone), to which one can confide everything. The stone listens, soaking in all the words, the secrets, the miseries, until it finally explodes, and on that day, one is instantly delivered of all one's sufferings and worries. Some even say this stone is the one in the Kaaba and on the day it explodes, it will be the Apocalypse.

The Patience Stone is an unusual war film, based on the eponymous novel that won the Prix Goncourt 2008, brilliantly adapted to the screen by author Atiq Rahimi (Earth and Ashes, 2004) himself, in collaboration with his friend, the legendary scenarist, Jean-Claude Carrire (The Unbearable Lightness of Being, 1988, Belle de Jour, 1967, The Mahabarata, 1989, plus 136 more credits on his rsum). This was Rahimi's fourth book, and the first one written in French rather than in Dari, his maternal language

In Kabul in ruins, following the retreat of the Soviet occupation forces in 1990, rival bands of mujahidin are fighting like rabid dogs over the remnants of the city. In this apocalyptic world, a man lies comatose on a mattress in a bare room of his house. This ""warrior of Allah"" has been decerebrated by a bullet lodged in the back of his neck, not while fighting for his religion or his country, but during a fratricide fight that took place when one of his comrades insulted him. The angry exchange resulted in gunfire, and his serious wound. His wife kneels next to him, fingering her prayer beads, chanting the ninety-nine names of Allah. The mullah instructed her that if she did so, in fifteen days her husband would again be well. But after nearly three weeks, he is still totally unresponsive.

The film rolls for only few minutes before we realize that we are far from the Occidental literature's exotic clichs regarding the proud Afghan warrior, honor's place at the heart of the traditions, and the country's beautiful landscape. Although the battle field is limited to a single house, the war is present and overwhelming, with its massacres and its shelling that make the spectator jump in his or her seat. The Patience Stone takes place in a crepuscular Kabul, whose name is never mentioned, and therefore could be located in any Muslim country, like Syria, for example.

While the war rages around her, The Woman (we never learn any of the characters' names) is hidden in the house, huddled near the bed, praying, changing her husband's perfusion, cleaning him, and chasing away the flies that enter his open mouth. Her husband's family has fled, leaving her and her two daughters without any resources and protection. During the periodic cease-fires, she ventures outside the house to get water and medication for her husband's perfusion, but the water-carrier and the pharmacist refuse to extend her any more credit. She also visits the home of her last link with her own family, her aunt, who runs a brothel in another part of town. It is here where she eventually leaves her two daughters for safety. Despite the dangers and her fears, she always returns to her house to care for her husband, without really knowing why, letting the days go by at his bedside.

But she is now beginning to loose her courage and her devotion is starting to weigh her down. She stops invoking Allah's names. She is still scared of this inert body, but she keeps on talking to him anyway. In his silence, his authority still overwhelms her, even though she does not know if he can hear and understand her. At first, she recalls episodes of her life, including her aborted dreams, her forced marriage to a husband always on the battle front, even on the wedding day, and the day her father sold her sister to an old man to cover her father's gambling debt. Her voice, timid and hesitating at first, affirms itself. She finally lets bitter words, crazy words, holed up far too long, escape from her inner self. She heckles Allah and his Hell, insults men and their never-ending wars, curses her warrior husband, a hero vanquished by his male pride, his religious obscurantism, his hate of the other, and goes as far as to reveal her most inner thoughts and secrets. In doing so, she frees herself from the all the oppressions she has been enduring the whole of her life. Once quietly praying, now she screams. Once living in silence and self-sacrificing abnegation, she emerges now as a human being, a woman. Sometimes, though, the shelling and the bullets come too close and The Woman takes refuge in the cellar of the house next door. In one instance, couple of marauding warriors enter her house, and she escapes being raped by telling them that she ""sells her body as they sell their blood,"" knowing that they would never touch her, as she is morally unclean according to the Holy books. However, the younger of the two warriors comes back the next day with some money to demand her ""services."" She is devastated, but she must submit. Eventually, the young man, an orphan himself, comes back. She develops feelings for him after learning his story, and of the sadistic mistreatment he suffers at the hands of his commandant. Her nurturing woman's instinct takes over, as well as her femininity (and, of course, so does the money he offers her).

Eventually, her Patience Stone, full of her pains, sorrows, frustrations, and of her most shameful and unspeakable secrets, explodes: her devastating, magic words have blown up to pieces all the burqas of the World! As The Man wakes up and reaches for her throat, she stabs him with her knife in the stomach. However, The Man, in a supreme effort, strangles her, liberating her from the marital, social and religious oppressions she has suffered whole her life. But then, The Woman's eyes opens as she says, exulting, ""I am a Prophet! I just made a miracle!""

This is an ambiguous ending to the film, but the story itself has some aspects of a fable - we can only guess we are in Afghanistan without it ever being named; the characters have no names other than The Woman and The Man, like some twilight Adam and Eve. Therefore, Rahimi had to be able to embody this in an image, without denying to the fable the force of realism, and without denying to the real the symbolic sense of a fable. He succeeds in providing such a fable-ending to his story.

The adaptation of the book to the screen was a significant challenge, given that it is a tragic huis clos taking place in the sick room, which The Woman only occasionally leaves. The book is a monologue by a woman to a dying man. Its delivery is straightforward: the voice speaks as if the woman is writing. Translating this narrative to the screen was something else, and the challenge depended on the choice of a very special actress whose theatrical talent would allow her to embody the role of The Woman on whom the whole film so critically depends. Rahimi chose the young Iranian actress, Golshifteh Farahani, who was the leading woman character in Ridley Scott's, Body of Lies (2008). Born in Iran after the revolution, she knows what it means to live in a phallocratic society. This was not a sine qua non pre-condition for the part, but it was certainly an asset. At first, Rahimi hesitated to cast Farahani in the part of The Woman because of her physical beauty. Indeed, she is beautiful, and in the film she even makes wearing the chadri (the ""tent"" that covers some Afghan women from head to toe) look elegant! In the continuous face-to-face with the spectator, Farahani demonstrates the majesty and flame worthy of an ancient Greek tragedienne.

Within the four walls of the room, Farahani's voice and face do wonders. In a searing, provocative, and passionate performance, she gives a star performance of a kind rarely seen anymore. Revealing the ambiguities of her character with a liberating and disconcerting sweetness, she carries her difficult role to a level of truth which seems impossible to achieve. All by herself, she anchors this story at the heart of reality, offering the birth of her free speech to the twilight world that required her silence.

The Aunt (Hassina Burgan), a wise old prostitute, presides over a bordello whose ambiance is like a feminine calm in the middle of the storm. Inside its walls are all the things men don't understand. In this role, Burgan's acting is on the mark, conveying calm and wisdom. Nothing much can be said about Hamidreza Javdan, The Husband, except that he remains perfectly still except for the heart pulse in his jugular and his slow breathing, for practically the entire film, probably a first in the annals of film!

Most of the film was shot in Morocco, with some outdoor scenes filmed on location in Kabul under the pretext of filming fighting quails, one of Afghan men favorite pastimes. Since most of the film is interior shots, where space is limited, Rahimi was keen to have a camera in constant motion: with few exceptions, the camera is always kept moving, in order to offset the threat of staginess in The Woman's monologues.

The film is the result of the collaboration of many talented people, each an expert in his own field, starting with Thierry Arbogast (6 Csars), the celebrated photography director responsible for almost all of Luc Besson's films, including La Femme Nikita (1990), Leon: The Professional (1994), The Fifth Element (1997); Herv De Luze's (3 Csar, Same Old Song, 1998, Tell no One, 2007, Ghost Writer, 2011), editing is seamless, and no small reason for the film's success; Max Richter's soundtrack is discreet, and yet has a strong presence, acting as intermezzos between monologue sequences, and adding to dramatic suspenseful moments in the film. The soundtrack consists of metallophone sounds mixed with string instruments (or perhaps electronic keyboarding).

In Patience Stone, Rahimi breaks all of the Afghan taboos - social, cultural, sexual and religious. ""When I wrote the novel, I wanted to put myself in the shoes of an Afghan woman to bare her desires as well as her suffering,"" he said. In this respect, he also becomes the Patience Stone, gathering and reinventing the pains and hopes of the martyrs, of all the Afghan women of the shadows, in order to give them a memory, their struggles forever synonymous with truth and freedom. In a country like Afghanistan, in order for an oppressed woman to finally speak, Rahini first had to paralyze the oppression of the system. As such, The Husband, as a symbol for this whole patriarchal, repressive system, is now paralyzed and injured. And because of it, The Woman can finally blossom and flourish, and she becomes intensely symbolic: ""The voice that emerges from my throat, it is the voice buried for thousands of years.""",1388102400,11,10707,4.809342748506246
6091400,4,B00GMV89CM,"""The Patience Stone"" (2012 release from Algeria; 102 min.) brings the story of an (unnamed) woman who is tending to her wounded husband, who we later learn was shot when defending his family's honor after being insulted. The husband is markedly older than her. As the movie starts to unfold, the woman is starting to spill secrets to her comatose husband about her upbringing and, more importantly, her 10 year marriage to him. Apart from the emotional state of affairs, the woman and her two young daughters are trying to cope with living in a war-torn area (Afghanistan, presumably), where militia regularly search house by house. One day, the woman's house is searched by a commander and a younger soldier. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is based on the book of the same name by Atiq Rahimi, who adopted his novel for the big screen and also directed this (and beautifully, I may add). There are several aspects of the movie that are deeply unsettling, none more so than the submissive role Muslim women are forced to endure in the Muslim world. They didn't ask for it, yet they have no choice. At one point, the wife tells her husband about how her sister, then 12 years old, is sold off by their father in order to settle a lost bet, and nothing can be done about it. When you see the wife going about her business inside the house, and then having to wear a burqua (a loose dress that covers the whole body from head to toe) when going outside, it is unsettling to me. Much of the movie takes place in the one room where the wife is tending to her comatose husband, whom she hides from view for fear of retribution from the militia roaming the streets, and in that sense the movie feels like a theatre play brought to the big screen. This is not a complaint, mind you. Last, but certainly not least, the acting performances in this movie are top notch throughout, none more so that from the lead, Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani in the role of the wife. This is my first time seeing her on the big screen and I was simply blown away by her performance, which hits all the highs and lows of the emotional spectrum, not to mention that she is graced with an amazing beauty.

Imagine my surprise when this movie showed up unannounced and without any pre-release or hype in September at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati. I figured this would not play very long, and hence went to see it right away. The matinee showing I saw this at was quite well attended, somewhat to my (pleasant) surprise. Bottom line: ""The Patience Stone"" is a stunningly beautiful and moving movie, taking a profound look at the role of women in Muslim society. If you are in the mood for a top-quality foreign movie that is not just miles but GALAXIES away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""The Patience Stone"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1384300800,14,2984,4.534322820037106
