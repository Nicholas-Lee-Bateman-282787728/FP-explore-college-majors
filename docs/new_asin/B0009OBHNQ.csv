2306828,5,B0009OBHNQ,"I have examinate the Dr John pianoschool some years back (the videoversions, but I think its the same). To have Mac as a teacher is really something. With a camera above the pianotangents you can really study his fingers at magic work. Its imposible not to get in to the boogiegroove once you get started. Of course, to keep up with da doctor is not an easy task but its wonderful to try. The favorit-track? ""Goodnight Irene"" in James Booker-style. If you don't want to LEARN to play then just look, listen and enjoy.",1280275200,,517,4.51063829787234
2306829,2,B0009OBHNQ,"I'm a beginner and i can already play a few blues piano things thanks to the homespun dvd of david bennett cohen. he is a very good teacher and explains techniques over and over again until you understand them!

unfortunately dr. john is not really a teacher kind of guy. he's a very talented player, no doubt. but the fact that the producer Happy Traum had to sit next to him during the shooting to squeeze some techniques out of him already shows you right from the beginning that dr. john is not really there for teaching you anything. he's just doing what he can do best: playing and talking about fellow blues musicians!

this dvd is definately not for beginners, more advanced players might get some interesting stuff out of it, i didn't...",1263945600,22,746,4.559701492537314
2306830,3,B0009OBHNQ,"The  dvd  contained  some  great  tunes  and  overhead  shots  of  Dr.  John's  playing  technique,  but  I  found  the transcriptions  to  be  less  than accurate.  I  transferred  the  audio  track  I  was interested  in  learning to  a  file  and  used  my  SlowDowner  to  digest  the  tune.  If  you  have  a basic  understanding  of  the blues  and  already  know  some  licks,  the  dvd  will  be helpful.  In  any  case,  it  still  is  great  to listen  to.",1244419200,4,466,4.4324324324324325
2306831,4,B0009OBHNQ,"Dr. John is not going to teach you how to play. In fact, he's not going to teach you anything, but if you can learn by watching his hands, then you will gain a lot. I've learned a ton of new licks just by watching him play. But if you're anything other than an advanced blues player already, you're not likely to gain from this DVD.",1153353600,26,332,4.045454545454546
2306832,5,B0009OBHNQ,Very much into the New Orleans blues and get down boogie woogie . Doctor John has listened closely to the great New Orleans piano players and he is now a great one and legend in his own right .If you cherish plain get down earthy blues and a boogie woogie beat then this DVD is for you . Doc John also teaches you about the so rich black music culture still cooking in New Orleans . Suggest you purchase both volumes of his DVD's on this subect you will not regret .,1151884800,5,466,4.076086956521739
2306833,4,B0009OBHNQ,"This DVD is for anyone who truly wants to learn how to play blues piano properly.  Dr. John is a fantastic musician with an outstanding repertoire.  Perhaps the only downside is that not all of the songs are transcibed which is a pity, especially with Swanee River Boogie, but that shouldn't deter anyone from buying this DVD.  He is a true master and the opportunity to have him personally show you how to play blues piano should not be passed up.  Absolutely fantastic!",1128297600,13,471,4.63855421686747
8064088,2,B0009OBHNQ,While it's nice to see a virtuoso like Dr John play the New Orleans blues this is not a tutorial. Its a video of him  playing with  some personal  inputs on the styles of mayn  artists. As a gutair player trying to transition to piano  It was useless to me as a learning tool. For an experienced player I can see how the left and right hand  shots would be of interest to learn his techniques. Two stars is because it was supposed to be a teaching video.,1500595200,,454,4.1022727272727275
8064089,5,B0009OBHNQ,"This is a great resource if you already know how to play and are trying to pick up New Orleans techniques along the lines of Professor Longhair, Champion Jack Dupree, Fats Domino, etc..  Lots of up close shots of his hands.

However if you are just learning piano, this is probably not for you - he doesn't really slow it down or explain what he is doing too clearly.",1488412800,,367,4.304347826086956

8064091,1,B0009OBHNQ,"The quality is horrible, I am so disappointed this DVD can not be used as a teaching tool. I am a big Dr John fan and really was looking forward to introducing the Dr John sound to my granddaughter, but the DVD skips and pixelates, it is unwatchable. What a shame.",1419552000,,264,4.196078431372549
8064092,5,B0009OBHNQ,A great insight to the piano style of Dr John. His left hand style has shown me plenty. I am a beginner interested in this style.,1378166400,,129,4.0
8064093,4,B0009OBHNQ,"Dr. John really is the master of this style of piano playing.  Being able to see his hands while he's playing is a good feature.  He's not very talkative when it comes to explaining what he's doing, but that's ok.  I mostly bought the video for the music and the chance to try and figure out his voicings without having to do it all by ear.  There's a section where he shows a bunch of turnarounds that is pretty cool.  It's also good to see the rhythms he does with his left hand, and the reach of that hand!  Some pretty difficult 10ths in there (low B-flat to D).",1368662400,,566,4.146788990825688
8064094,4,B0009OBHNQ,"Dr. John Teaches New Orleans Piano uses the split screen gimmick that allows you to see what the good Doctor is playing as he's playing via overhead shots.  The only reason that I gave this four out of five and not the whole five is because of the audio version (in three volumes) that allows Mac to verbally reminisce about a wider range of pianists and styles.  While the transcriptions for the DVDs are a little more in depth, the audio version allows you to just kick back and listen to his gravely voice go on about a variety of subjects and makes for just plain good entertainment as well as education.  The DVDs are a little bit more structured and while are extremely informative, just aren't as much fun as the audio counterparts.

But, don't get me wrong, the DVDs are well worth the money and if one takes the time, then you'll come away much better for it.  So, even if I didn't give it the five stars, these DVDs are still highly recommended.",1368316800,3,955,4.403409090909091
8064095,4,B0009OBHNQ,"I can't say The Doctor's 'teaching' style meshes with my learning style (I wouldn't even call it a teaching style), but if you watch often enough, the genius of what he's doing does get communicated.",1358208000,,199,4.714285714285714
8064096,2,B0009OBHNQ,"Great pianist, uncontroversially, but the low resolution and quality of this video make it impossible to see what notes he's playing.",1293235200,2,133,5.380952380952381
8064097,5,B0009OBHNQ,"This is not so much a piano lesson as much as it is a dense style resource.  If you are willing to make ample use of pause and replay, there are several years worth of licks, turnarounds and left hand riffs to extract from this hour-long DVD.  You get a helpful top view of the keyboard so you can see notes and fingering (I agree - a working familiarity of blues piano and N.O. piano is helpful - I recommend Jeffrey Gutcheon's out of print '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Improvising-Rock-Piano/dp/0825640717/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Improvising Rock Piano</a>') and you also occasionally get side views, so you can see the technique of his hands, which I thought was very helpful when studying the technique of his piano rolls and trills (he sometimes anchors the 3rd finger and rolls the thumb and 5th finger, for example).  You also get some interesting variations on the I-IV-V blues progression and a showcase of the range of expression in N.O. Blues - from legato and gospel-like to a hammering, rock style.

Even just for entertainment, the DVD is a pleasure to just watch as an unaccompanied performance.  Watch Dr John emulate Allen Toussaint close up.  Doesn't get any better than that!",1285718400,3,1239,5.17
