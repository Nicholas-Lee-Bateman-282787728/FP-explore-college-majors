8393718,1,B003BKROOQ,This product was sold with the impression that it would play in US DVD players.  It does not as it is in PAL form.  This was a term that I did not understand at the time of purchase and the warning that it would not play was not apparent to me.,1367798400,2,244,3.764705882352941
8393719,3,B003BKROOQ,"I had initially hoped that this DVD would show the complete four and a half hour military parade but it did not. The non-military material was somewhat interesting but it was nothing special. What was shown of the military parade made the DVD worth buying. If you are interested in German weapons and equipment, as well as martial music, of that era I recommend you buy this DVD.",1298678400,6,379,4.588235294117647
8393720,1,B003BKROOQ,"Very very dissapointing. On reading one review one got the impression their was more footage on Hitlers 50th birthday than has been seen before. The so called 'Special features' are just a rehash of the original footage edited in a different style. Footage was hardly pristine even allowing for age etc. My archives has better footage of Hitlers 50th birthday than that served up here by what appears a very low grade organization. Amazon however in their usual trusted way ensured that the DVD was delivered promptly. Shame the 2 discs (could have fitted on i disc)was not re writable for one could have used them for far more better material.
  Thomas Knight - Wintergarden Film (Aust)",1297900800,4,687,4.863247863247863
8393721,4,B003BKROOQ,"Pretty decent docu with both color(ized) and B/W photos/video.  Comes with German and English narration, English subtitles for German film clips are quite nice, slightly raised orange color font.  The English narration is done by a Brit with a good tenor and pace. The only complaint is that the company producing the DVD (History Films) has their logo embedded on the movie in the upper left hand corner the WHOLE time.  Very annoying.

Buyers in the US/North America should beware that this DVD is in PAL format and will NOT play on Region 1 players.  It plays fine on my Mac though, so a decent computer or region-free DVD player and you're good.  A little pricey if you don't have a way to watch it though!",1293062400,8,710,4.595238095238095
