6411948,2,B00KB01MHO,I love the show Awkward so I'm buying all seasons of awkward on DVD. But I was very disappointed when I got season 3 on DVD. There are 4 disc that go with season 3 of awkward. The 3rd disc doesn't work at all it's completely blank. So I'm irritated that only have of season 3 I can watch.,1435190400,,288,3.8983050847457625

6411951,4,B00KB01MHO,"Awkward: Season 3 was definitely worth the buy. I loved it and the entire time I was yelling at Jenna for being so stupid, but if you really just step away from the situation for a minute, you see that this show is so true to life! Awkward is a show I recommend frequently to my fellow TV viewers. It honestly has what teenagers want and can also certainly be an interesting show for adults, as after season 4, Jenna is in University. It is fast paced and is very easy to watch, with each episode only being 20 minutes. Full of laughs, it also teaches some important life lessons.",1426723200,,580,4.281818181818182

8657091,4,B00KB01MHO,Awkward is the perfect name for this show. It is basically nothing like real high school but something about it just makes you keep watching. Having it on DVD makes it much more bearable to watch since they're only 30 minutes long.,1447545600,,231,4.523809523809524
