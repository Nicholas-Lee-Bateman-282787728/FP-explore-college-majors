7595297,5,B01A97AT9U,"Okay. Seriously freaking loved this. The acting, the writing--it was just all surprisingly wonderful.",1460505600,,101,6.285714285714286
7595298,1,B01A97AT9U,It doesn't deserve to have 5 stars nor my $3.99!!,1460246400,,49,4.0
7595299,4,B01A97AT9U,"If you are looking for a sweet, realistic romantic movie this is a good choice.  The realness of it is what makes it special and the actors also lend to this movie being more than just a syrupy, over saturated rom com.  I enjoyed it from start to finish and am glad I chose it. This movie is a good choice if you are looking for a girls night in type movie because it isn't overly sappy and has a relatable storyline.",1460246400,3,417,4.073170731707317
7595300,5,B01A97AT9U,"Go ahead, try it! Well filmed, well acted, and the characters are hilarious in their authenticity...",1460160000,2,100,5.3125
7595301,5,B01A97AT9U,"Heart-warming, honest and thoughtful. Just go for it!",1459641600,3,53,5.75
7595302,5,B01A97AT9U,Great rom-com. Amazing acting and great story line. Loved it,1458604800,2,60,5.1
7595303,1,B01A97AT9U,"The main character is adorable and I love her, but yet again, a fat chick written like a fat chick. Theres a scene where she's literally shoveling ice cream in her face for no reason. Stop it writers, just stop it. Also the romance plot was just BS.",1477872000,2,249,4.208333333333333
7595304,4,B01A97AT9U,Cute story. Just sappy enough. Perfect chick flick.,1475107200,,51,5.5
7595305,5,B01A97AT9U,"She's so relatable, the characters are wonderfully dysfunctional and hilarious! The family dynamic is pretty spot on and it's very real, these are things that people would do. I felt like I was peeking in on an actual family's real lives versus watching people act. Make another one! =]",1472774400,,286,4.857142857142857
7595306,3,B01A97AT9U,Good.,1472342400,,5,5.0
7595307,3,B01A97AT9U,Better than expected. Melissa Bergland did a good job with the main character but the story drags in the middle. It's still worth a watch even with its predictable ending.,1470441600,,171,4.733333333333333
7595308,3,B01A97AT9U,Liked the main character but mediocre at best. Plot was extremely predictable.,1470009600,,78,5.583333333333333
7595309,2,B01A97AT9U,"Really hard to have ANY empathy for the  heroine.  She was just irritating and confusing.  What businesswoman in her RIGHT mind closes her business and only source of income simply because a cute customer arrives??  Every act of her throwing herself at him, and tryng to make a 1 to 2 day relationship seem MEANINGFUL just made me wince.  And her RUDENESS???  What the heck was up with that???",1469923200,2,393,4.6231884057971016
7595310,5,B01A97AT9U,Very cute movie.  I thought the lead actress was very pretty.  I liked all of the performances.  I also liked the fact that it is set in Canada.  We don't get to see Canada in film all that often.,1468108800,,196,3.948717948717949
7595311,5,B01A97AT9U,Funny and heartwarming loved her quick witted sense of humor.,1467763200,,61,5.2

7595316,5,B01A97AT9U,"Cute movie, predictable but worth watching because why should all the skinny, models get the lead role in Romance Comedies? Its nothing you have not seen before but the quirkiness and curvy size of the actress made it all the more enjoyable for a girl's night.",1465516800,,260,4.673913043478261
7595317,4,B01A97AT9U,Fun story with a few twists and turns I didn't see coming at first.,1465430400,,67,3.857142857142857
7595318,5,B01A97AT9U,This is a great movie. I watched it several times!,1465344000,,50,4.1
7595319,4,B01A97AT9U,"From the previews, I thought this movie was a comedy.  Actually, it was a look at a dysfunctional family with some moments of laughter.  By the end, I felt quite somber and, also, thought it was worthy of my time.  Just don't watch it thinking you will laugh your way through it.",1465257600,2,279,4.326923076923077

7595321,2,B01A97AT9U,Not as good as I had hoped,1465171200,,26,2.857142857142857
7595322,2,B01A97AT9U,"The scenery was fantastic, but the good stuff stopped there. And could we please have a plus-size character who isn't addicted to endless ice cream and candy bars?  The heroine was Too Stupid To Live for a big chunk of the movie, her friends and relatives were mostly awful people - and that's when their characterizations had any depth to them at all, the acting wasn't particularly good and (small spoiler) the guy she ends up with in the end was just a vague jerk character for most of the movie.  I wish I could get my rental fee back.",1465084800,2,539,4.38
7595323,5,B01A97AT9U,"I absolutely loved this film. I laughed, I cried, I suffered along with the leading lady.",1464998400,,89,4.625
7595324,4,B01A97AT9U,Pretty darned good little formula rom-com.  Great choice for a rainy afternoon or date night.,1464998400,,93,5.2
7595325,5,B01A97AT9U,Enjoyed it. Pr distance nut it's my kind of funny romance. Not all jokes but good movies. Some serious stuff.,1464652800,,109,4.5

7595327,4,B01A97AT9U,"Quirky movie. More a drama about family than a romantic comedy, but still enjoyable.",1463529600,,84,5.071428571428571
7595328,1,B01A97AT9U,"Shouldn't have wasted the money on it. I thought it looked like a quirky and endearing kind of story, but it was just sad and crass. I made sure to watch the whole thing, hoping it would get better as it went on but with no such luck.",1463356800,2,234,3.8958333333333335

7595336,2,B01A97AT9U,"I really wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't get into it all. Tired and lame plot but pretty scenery. Lost interest and never finished it.",1461283200,,149,4.357142857142857

I found that this movie was funny and you will be caught up in this movie . You will first smile then laugh .
Yes  it is full of not the greatest acting but that also seems to be it charm . Great for a night in and you want something  that is light and has humor .",1461110400,,283,3.5483870967741935

7595342,3,B01A97AT9U,This movie was just okay. The lead actress is talented but the plot was predictable and other acting in the movie wasn't that great. I will say it was great to see two of the guys from Trailer Park Boys in it.,1460937600,2,209,4.0

8746704,2,B01A97AT9U,"It could have been great, but the main character was so mean to anyone who didn't serve her interests throughout the whole movie, it was hard to like her.",1496707200,,154,4.344827586206897
8746705,4,B01A97AT9U,"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. The characters are relatable, which is refreshing. It is nice watching a movie that doesnt leave you feeling self-conscious. Usually, the heroin in movies like these are stick thin with perfect hair, skin, clothes, faceetc. Though it is in the plot that the main female character is overweight, I was still expecting her to be cookie cutter Hollywood overweight, which really is not overweight at all! It was delightful to me that I was wrong.  That is what makes this movie great. The main characters are real, but still appealing. Great acting, great plot. What more could you want?",1493251200,,618,4.830188679245283
8746706,5,B01A97AT9U,A good movie for once. Real life circumstances without all the drama BS of Hollywood movies these days.,1491696000,,103,4.777777777777778
