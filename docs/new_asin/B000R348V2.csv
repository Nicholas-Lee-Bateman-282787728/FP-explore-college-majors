8198583,5,B000R348V2,"Having lived the scene in the Minneapolis area in the mid 60's and having seen them live several times, this DVD was great. A trip down memory lane in the laid back style that you would have expected. Good job Tony. I was good to see follow up info on the lives of Snaker, Spider Jack and Little Son. We'll worth it.",1516838400,,316,4.112903225806452

8198587,4,B000R348V2,Awesome!  Amazing that 3 guys from Minnesota can imitate the oldest and best Blues players of America!  Altough a sophmoric attempt probably as close to delta Blues a group of Northerners can get!,1421366400,,196,4.909090909090909

8198589,5,B000R348V2,"If you have ever heard Spider John, Dave Ray, and Tony Glover play then you probably have this DVD already - if not you need to hear these folks lay it down like no one else and this video performance/documentary hits it out of the stadium parking lot - this is extremely well done, informative and just down right great STUFF THAT WORKS. Real music performed by real folk - some of the best acoustic rocking rag folk blues you will ever hear - The Real Truth Americana Folk smack you in your soul music played by true craft masters, and an excellent look at the lives and play of these musical greats! R.I.P. Dave Ray, You Mattered Brother!!! As for Amazon and the service they provided on this purchase: it was top notch, good price, and very fast free shipping that arrived days early - Thank you Amazon!",1310169600,4,807,4.422818791946309
8198590,5,B000R348V2,"What must be the true stories of the true legends: Koerner, Ray & Glover... as told by those who were there. A quaint little rockumentary style video documenting some of the early days of this legendary blues triad! No slickly done hollywood flick here, but chock full of memories, many direct form the horses mouths.",1257638400,4,317,4.781818181818182

8198592,5,B000R348V2,"This video was basically put-together by Tony Glover, and has been up-dated a couple of times. At least recently enough that it covers Dave Ray's passing.

I was a KR&G fan since ""Lots More"" came out on LP, and now I seem to be a bigger fan than ever. If you're a fan (or a ""past"" fan), you'll love this. It was put together with love.",1192060800,10,335,4.075757575757576
