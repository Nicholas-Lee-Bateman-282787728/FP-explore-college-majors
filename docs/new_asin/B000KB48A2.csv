2687630,4,B000KB48A2,"I enjoyed this film.  While it may not be classic, it has great moments.  Bruce McCulloch, who directed the light comedies ""Stealing Harvard"" & ""Superstar,"" keeps the pace brisk.  Ray Liotta, who won an Emmy for ""ER"" in 2005, plays Walter Pearce.  Walter seems to be a rather weak man.  With a marriage that has gone stale, he gives into temptation with a young assistant at his firm.  His daughter Chloe goes to dinner with her family and her boyfriend Paul.  Chloe is played by the lovely Rachel Blanchard who was in ""Snakes on a Plane.""  Paul is played by Brenden Fehr who was a regular on the TV series ""Roswell.""  On the heels of Paul & Chloe's engagement, Walter feels compelled to confess at the worst possible time that he has strayed.  His wife Deborah played by Glenne Headley who was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Amateurs/dp/B000XJ5UEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Amateurs</a>&nbsp;begins to punish him in every way possible, which is the premise for all that follows.  The other daughter Christine is played by Brooke Nevin who I enjoyed as Nikki Hudson on TV's ""4400.""  She had her heart broken by star high school football player Skylar.  Walter winds up crashing at Skylar's house, next door to his family.  As Skylar, Shaun Sipos is a bright spot in the film.  Looking like he could play a cousin to Brad Pitt, he must endure a big change in his life and learn how to be kind.  The ""buddy movie"" aspect of the film greatly appealed to me.  Ron Selmour, who will be in ""2012"" currently being advertised in theatres, has a nice cameo as the yoga teacher Ranja who tries to do more than teach.  Overall, this is a feel-good movie that leaves you with a smile on your face and a warm spot in the heart.  Enjoy!",1231804800,3,1778,4.827814569536423
2687631,5,B000KB48A2,"There are those movies that really make you reflect on life and where you stand in it, and there are those that make you want those precious moments back.
This movie is one that really makes me think about life and where i've been, what I've done and what I still need to make time for to do. I loved this movie for so many reasons. Just saw it on TV and have ordered a copy. It was a great film. Perhaps not for everyone but, for me and at this point in my life; it certainly is a great movie.

I'd recommend this film if you've seen ""Broken Flowers"" and enjoyed it. Both are fantasic!",1200873600,8,586,4.051724137931035
2687632,1,B000KB48A2,"Why am I the first to review this movie?  The answer is obvious.  This one is so bad not even a woman will admit to watching this ""Chick Flick.""  I was forced to watch and I stayed with it only to get my revenge by writing this.  Any man who acts like Ray does in this movie ought to be stipped of his gender.  And what man would want any of the women in this film?  I am not talking about looks here.  All three female leads are gorgous.  What I am talking about is their behavior.  Clearly Ray was not that bad a guy but his wife and daughters treat him like a war criminal.  Avoid at all costs unless you want to exchange your good mood for rage.  PS: A great Loving Spoonful song is wasted here to boot.",1181606400,5,707,3.9432624113475176
8155356,3,B000KB48A2,Was a very predictable movie. The acting was not horrible.  The movie was generic.  Ray Loatta is horrible no matter what role he plays,1382400000,,135,4.583333333333333
8155357,5,B000KB48A2,I have to write 20 words for this movie. It's like either you like sappy movies or you don't. The movie is about family life and a family surviving failure in the sense of being unfaithful. It has very good moral content and focuses on situations in current society.,1377302400,,266,4.448979591836735
8155358,3,B000KB48A2,"Had a different story line, that was easy to follow. Enjoyed it, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in topic.",1372032000,,120,4.5
8155359,2,B000KB48A2,The most compelling aspect of this movie is simply Ray Liotta. And.... I guess that's kind of it. Watch if you have no other choice.,1368921600,,132,4.32
8155360,3,B000KB48A2,It was a moralistic show. I liked it for the moral it portrayed. The characters are believable and they are developed nicely.,1368057600,,125,4.7272727272727275
8155361,2,B000KB48A2,"Watched 20 minutes of it and turned it off...good thing it was a free rental...just not good, stereotypical two women wronged and the males in their life trying to win them over... ""ain't nobody got time for that..""",1366329600,2,215,4.684210526315789
8155362,5,B000KB48A2,"What's wrong with a good movie that has a happy ending...  NOTHING...  This is a campy feel good movie with ""positive moral values"".  So if you want to make the time, enjoy it and know your 140 minutes will not be waisted...",1365465600,,224,4.285714285714286
8155363,4,B000KB48A2,"I received before the date, I like it, HELP I do NOT what else to say, HELP I do NOT what else to say!!!!",1363651200,,105,3.4166666666666665
8155364,1,B000KB48A2,"Holy cow, where do I begin?  First of all - I'm offended that someone referred to this as a ""chick flick"" because it is decidedly NOT that!  It is awful!!  (side note:  I'm tired of people, usually men, referring to movies they don't like as ""chick flicks"".)

Somehow Ray Liotta and Glenne Headly pull off these terrible roles, but the rest of the cast stinks.  Period.

The story is stupid and the lines fall flat.  And what is with that ridiculous blue suit???? UGH save your time and money, and pass on this turkey.  You'll be glad you did.",1355184000,2,543,4.404040404040404
8155365,5,B000KB48A2,"I personally found this movie very good, it had a good story and I didn't find the acting bad at all considering the type of movie it was. I thought Ray Liotta did a good job with this role. Ray is one of my favorite actors and while he excells in movies like Goodfellas, Unlawful Entry, Hannibal, Smokin Aces, Copland,John Q, Steet Kings 2 Motor City and others like it, This movie proves he can act in any role hes trying to portray. I found this to be again very good with alot of meaning behind it. My girlfriend enjoyed it as well. Id recommend it to anyone who decides to give it a chance.",1311897600,4,595,4.182608695652174
