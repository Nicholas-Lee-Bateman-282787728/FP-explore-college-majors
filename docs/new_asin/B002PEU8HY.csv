Like a lot of people attracted to alternative medicine, I started out in my adult life holding up doctors as being next-to-God in their wisdom and worthiness. Cracks began to develop in that perception when I suggested to a specialist that perhaps I had XX diagnosis after having done a lot of research around a recurring chronic situation. He gave me the standard, ""Who is the doctor here?"" spiel and pooh-poohed my intuition about my own body. Of course he prescribed antibiotics (again).  A year later I ended up back on his examining table, and guess what? He had arrived at the conclusion that I had XX condition!  Surgery and heavy-duty pharmaceuticals ensued.  I am not going to criticize him for that because in my case the surgery was successful.  But it was just the beginning of seeing how I actually had some small knowledge of my own about my body and how lifestyle changes seemed to suit me better than being treated with condescension.

I have gone less and less to traditional doctors over the ensuing years. I am in my 60s, so of course I experience some aches and pains occasionally, but nothing that gets in the way of enjoying my retirement in a beautiful part of the world with the man I've loved for 43+ years.  I loved what Dr. McDougall has to say about visiting doctors-- because it confirms what I feel deep down, I guess.  He states if you aren't ailing, don't go to the doctor, ""Don't build a relationship with your doctor"" because if you are really sick you will likely just be seen by the emergency room or drop-in clinic doctor anyhow, and seek out a good 'generalist' vs. handing your primary care over to a specialist.  I think he rightly points out that most specialists tend to see all complaints from their patients through their own lens of speciality-- if you are seeing ""your"" cardiologist and tell him about a sore tooth he will suggest that unless you get in there and get it treated with a root canal you will likely end up with a terrible myocardial infection.

I'm sure that most of us have heard a lot of stories about the corruption that exists between the Medical Care institutions and the pharmaceutical moguls. Dr. McDougall is the first non-bitter traditional physician I've heard to draw a picture of what really happens-- the sexy 'former cheerleaders' who go into a doctor's clinic with pizza for the staff and the other kickbacks that happen when physicians buy into the latest pharmaceutical medication.  He does a laudable job in detailing this aspect of modern traditional medicine.  I was fascinated and somewhat horrified.  It was akin to finding out what goes on behind political lines.

There is so much more in this DVD that is worth watching-- actually, around 6 hours of 'seminar' material.  The bottom line is that taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing really trumps pouring your resources into the medics' and pharmaceutical companies' bank accounts. And Dr. McDougall will get you on the road to making those necessary lifestyle changes.",1372550400,2,3287,4.748681898066784
8376960,5,B002PEU8HY,I learned a great deal from this video because it presents information often nutritional  that most medical doctors are unaware of (many medical schools do not offer nutrition course sequences as part of the standard curricula)  and few doctors are as focused on putting the health and wellness of the patient using inexpensive solutions such as nutritional methods first and prescriptions drugs second.,1366416000,,403,5.380952380952381
