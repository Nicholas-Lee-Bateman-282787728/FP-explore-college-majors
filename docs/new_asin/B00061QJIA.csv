2157873,5,B00061QJIA,"What happens when you have great writing, fantastic ideas, briliant acting, but a tiny budget? You get Sapphire and Steel. I had heard of this series before but had never seen it. I was pleasantly surprised when the entire series was released on DVD recently. Thank you to the PTB. It's one of those series which is full of mystery and questions, (in this case, who exactly are these people named after ""elements""?) but doesn't feel the need to explain itself. The series is split into 6 stories, each one containing from 3-6 episodes. The stories are creative, the settings dark, creepy and moody. The ""flashlight"" monster of the first story is unintentionally funny but the story and acting are a great intro to the series. For those who can't get enough of S&S, Big Finish, who does the Dr Who audiocassette plays, will be releasing new S&S audio adventures.",1136073600,10,861,4.746666666666667
2157874,5,B00061QJIA,"I really enjoied this TV show. If you like Sapphire and Steel that means you are inteligent, curious for life and nature, smart, and have sharp mind. I was just a little kid when they broadcasted the show in Panama and I didn't miss one episode. Very well written scrips and good dramas are integrated into every chapter. I strongly recommend these series for those who are looking for great quality sci-fi drama, smart-public oriented.",1133395200,5,436,4.826666666666667
2157875,4,B00061QJIA,"I was very happy to learn that Sapphire and Steel was FINALLY coming out on DVD. Once I got the set and watched the series, I was not disappointed. The show has an eerie, claustrophobic feel that makes it unlike many other shows out there. One can forgive the limited sets and average quality video effects because the stories are so entertaining and original (A creature that exists in photographs, a darkness that lives off of the bitterness of the dead, time itself being a destructive force, etc.).

While the show itself is excellent the DVD's themselves don't live up to their potential. The extras are rather thin (although the introduction voice-overs by P.J. Hammond and Shaun O'Riordan at the beginning of each assignment are very insightful). The other problem is that the episodes were not transferred from PAL to NTSC (the U.S. video encoding standand) properly so the video images have a slightly jerky film-like motion to them. (Episode 5 of Assignment 5 is the only episode that was transferred properly) Although the problem is not distracting, it is a shame that A&E couldn't have got it right the first time. Maybe this set will be rereleased with the flaws fixed (as they did for some episodes of Space:1999).

Overall, this is a great series that anyone who likes original writing and spooky atmosphere will enjoy. A must have.",1109116800,33,1348,4.856521739130435
2157876,4,B00061QJIA,"My husband had seen episodes of this series at a science fiction convention, and described it to me. Until that time, I had been unaware of it. When I mentioned it was coming available on DVD (seems it skipped VHS completely), his reaction was simple:  Let's get it!

  I have admired the work of both Ms. Lumley and Mr. McCallum; I enjoy Dr. Who; and the idea of paranormal beings as leads fascinated me. I have enjoyed these stories, although they do take more than one viewing to fully appreciate.  Do not look for the banter of ""Man from UNCLE"" or the subtle sexual innuendos of ""The Avengers.""  Sapphire and Steel are not human, and seem above most of that sort of thing.  They team up to set right temporal wrongs - quite effectively.  No high-tech special effects, no high-speed action sequences.  The series was studio-bound, low-budget, and totally BBC.  Writing and acting carry the shows, which some will undoubtedly find more ""thought provoking"" than desired.

Only six ""assignments"" were made, and the final one makes it clear there will be no more.  Each assignment has within it several chapters (usually six), in (for lack of a better word) serialized style.  One drawback to the DVDs: there is no way to ""dovetail"" viewing each disk.  Opening credits, brief recaps, and end credits do get in the way.  Oh well.

This short-lived series represents a genre that wasn't seen again for a while.  (I am not a fan of ""The XFiles,"" but I am told there are some similarities.)  Considered rare (indeed, impossible to find for years), this set of the entire series is well worth having!",1106784000,13,1594,4.713768115942029
2157877,5,B00061QJIA,"Having seen this show while I was living in England in the late 1970's, I was pleasantly surprised to see the release of this series for the U.S. market as I don't believe it was ever broadcast here in the States.  For the uninitiated, Sapphire & Steel is about the adventures of two intergalactic ""special agents"", if you will, who manifest themselves in human form when among us.  Their assignments deal with threats to space and time and their struggles with assorted paranormal entities.  It's a bizzare concept that works surprisingly well given the limited budget and f/x technology of the time.  Given the low production values, what makes this show come alive, like most British television, is the writing and acting.  David and Joanna do a fabulous job and make their characters their own.  Watching the show is like watching a stage play as all but one episode takes place inside the studio.  The atmosphere the show generates is downright creepy and makes it a lot of fun to watch.  Conclusions to each assignment are often ambiguous, unsettling and not always a happy ending, for supporting characters as well for the heroes themselves.  The boxed set is really nice and contains the entire series of six ""assignments"". (The series was originally broadcast as a serial, with each ""assignment"" consisting of a given number of episodes.)  Each disc contains a complete assignment.  The extras are a little light, but there are some comentaries by the show's creator and writer as well as some promotional material.  Picture quality is fair, but this is due to the fact that the show was shot on 1970's era video and not due to any flaw on the dvd itself.  The sound is unremarkable for the same reason, plain ol' 1970's mono!  Overall, I was quite pleased with set and the audio/video limitations did not distract from my enjoyment.",1103932800,14,1842,4.82484076433121
2157878,4,B00061QJIA,"To any who are overly used to the impressive advances in special effects in the past couple of decades and unaccustomed to engaging their imagination, S&S will undoubtedly be a let down.

Engaged, or merely utilised, by an unnamed power Sapphire and Steel deal with sinister attacks toward the denizens of this timeframe from forces past, future or those simply inimical to humanity. Understated, poorly financed, yet wonderfully executed this science fiction `murder'-mystery series is particularly thematic and, yes, British.

Those who enjoy Blakes' 7 or Doctor Who are likely to have the patience to allow the mostly unexplained tapestry of this series to unfold metre by sometimes painful metre. It may, perhaps, have more meaning to those of us who sneaked off to the TV as pre-teens and took it in as a thrilling weekly escape when gore was never an allowable factor, or, then again, it may have more of an effect because of that ease of bloodshed now.

A more recent creation that draws upon similar precepts is Neil Gaiman's Coraline. There are things in the dark that you have never seen because light has chased them away; there are things in shadows that become stronger with time.

As I walked upon the stair

I met a man who wasn't there

He wasn't there again today

I wish, I wish, he'd go away

It's worth a watch, at the very least.",1103155200,8,1350,4.739316239316239
2157879,5,B00061QJIA,"This review pertains to the original transmitted telly series:

One of the cleverest series yet - moody, introspective, fantastic and mysterious: all on a minimal budget.  Think ""Doctor Who"" for adults.  With a smaller budget.

Lumeley & McCallum are the best team of temporal investigators  since Tom Baker & Lalla Ward.

Some of the adventures are better than others, but all are thought provoking and well acted.

2157880,5,B00061QJIA,"Nice to see this show finally get released by mainstream channels.  (current fans will have found the set elsewhere...)

If you're a fan of The X-Files, you'll LOVE Sapphire And Steel.  Especially if you prefer intellectual horror above quantitive gore, guts, and circus acts.  Made between 1978 and 1982, this low-budget BBC series used inventive plotlines, a strong atmosphere, and strongly written and acted characters to sell it self.  And it packs a whollop.  Indeed, some of the stories are so complex that they could be benefitted from a second viewing.  (pity VCRs didn't exist when this show was first aired!)

I personally recommend Story 2 (""The Railway Station"") for first viewing.  It's got the series' premise down pat and despite a lengthy 8 episodes, remains taut and gripping all the way through so the padding to fill out the timeslot isn't noticed.  The story puts a new dimension on ghosts and their influence, and episode 8 has some excellent make-up and a grizzly resolution.

Story 4, ""The Man Without a Face"" is another fan favorite.  The malignancy in this story puts photography in a different light.  Either by imprisoning people in photographs or taking them out, this story is inventive - and suitably horrific.  The final episode isn't as strong as it could have been, but the rest of the story more than makes up for it.

Story 6, with a working title of ""The Petrol Station"" features a new type of enemy for Sapphire and Steel.  This one doesn't use horror in the way the other stories had, but it is highly enjoyable and also keeps one's interest.  It's also the series' finale and, as many BBC Sci-fi series' go, this one isn't particularly pleasant.

Story 1, ""Escape through A Crack in Time"", while having a very good introductory episode, ultimately falls apart halfway through and the denouement rather misses the point of its preceeding episodes.  Revolving around children's' fairy tales, this one tries to give a deeper meaning to the tales.  As it is an introductory story, you'll note some differences that were not in subsequent stories.  As story 2 is so perfect, P J Hammond was quick to correct the errors he'd made.  It's still worth a watch, if for episode 1 alone.  As with stories 3 and 5, this one is 6 episodes long and contains some padding.

Story 5, ""Dr McDee Must Die"", was not written by P J Hammond, who wrote the other stories.  It feels more like a Doctor Who story.  It's got its moments, but is overall mediocre.

Story 3, ""The Creature's Revenge"", is the one and only turkey.  Indeed, it's a turkey complete with beaks and claws.  Watch it for the sake of completeness and the introduction to Silver, who is seen again in story 6 of course.  But what little plot exists is padded out so extensively that re-watchings are mandatory.  and, unfortunately, this story is so dull and uninvolving that re-watching is simply impossible to do.  The plot, as far as I can make it out to be, revolves around some human science teams traveling back in time a couple thousand years to experience how their ancestors lived in 1980.  There's a creature that kills on contact for some reason, the pair taking the role of a 1980 couple (despite being ~25 years different in age) are being tormented by visions of wild animals or food animals, and their futuristic but disguised pod is basically an old apartment building (both outside AND inside, sigh...) with a cheap mod and 1979-looking aluminium kitchen table set as a visual effect for the inside of another pod.  Episode 1 is actually reasonably good and its cliffhanger is marvelous, but it totally fails after that.

There were some audio commentary extras that were interesting, but not spectacular.

The menu system looks nice, but a ""Play all"" button would have been nice.

The packaging for the region 1 (US) version is vastly superior to any of the other region releases available.  It's uniform and has a proper feel.

The audio transfer is reasonably well, no argument here.

The video transfer is quite good, though it's clear that only a mundane amount of video restoration was used; the prints could have benefitted from a full restoration/embellishment process to eliminate the problems that the source tapes have (the only real problems are with the cameras and recording equipment of the time.  Skin tones look great and there's little artifacting to be found.)  But that would be very expensive, the show is British therefore the British owners would do the actual restoration work, and this is a niche show.  Besides, I've seen far, far worse.)

There is a rumor that the discs will not play the video at proper frame rate on some players.  The discs will play, but the video has a film-like motion to it.  As this series was shot on video tape, this effect isn't normal.  But even with this effect (it happens on my set-top player but not my computer's DVD-ROM drive), I don't find the effect jarring.  In fact, I think it HELPS many of the stories because it feels like a film transfer.  (only videophiles will care about the difference, but I thought I'd say it anyway.  :-)  )

A&E released this set.  So it's no surprise that this set is as solid as it is.  Definitely a buy for fans.  Easily worth a renting for newbies and ultimately worth the buy.",1095897600,133,5276,4.725877192982456

Okay, I bought this because this was at the top of my Netflix DVD cue for over a year and then it was moved to Saved (Unavailable).
Having waited for so long I was almost afraid to be disappointed when it did arrive, but I was not, I enjoyed it because it was sort of what I expected and not what I expected.  The stories themselves remind me of older Doctor Who (John Pertwee, Tom Baker) in that they do drag on a bit at times, not the choppy, almost a little too fast modern series (David Tennant, Matt Smith).  The six ""Assignments"" (34 episodes) could easily have made a run for twice as long.  Wish they could have wrung out one more story but I think it ended well.

I have the Shout! studios distribution of this show, there is a studio plug at the start of each complete story that I could do without but it in no way detracts from the presentation.",1426118400,2,964,4.166666666666667

I won't compare it to any other shows because it is unlike any other. Perhaps a little like Dr Who without the monsters and running. It is a little claustrophobic but I like that.

The picture quality is OK but not great. The color is pretty good. There are no scratches or other film blemishes so either it has been restored or it was originally shot on tape.

2157956,3,B00061QJIA,"Well unfortunately the stories make little sense. The opening credits should give you a clue where they claim the agents are named for each of the 127 elements. If you do not see at least two flaws in that or are as big a fan of these actors as I am you might make it through to the end. Despite the Amazon.com reviews calling it a British X-Files, it is in fact closer to Dr. Who, 3rd doctor, with 1/4 the budget so most episodes take place in a couple rooms, no monsters and a whole lot of staring off into the distance with voice overs of telepathic arguments. Even as expressive as  Joanna Lumley can be, and is in this, with just her eyes you just can not make a show of that. David McCallum seems to oscillate between deadpan and overly dramatic. Either would have worked for this but both, for about the similar reasons, is just odd.

Also the picture quality is not that great till Assignment 5. It is from 1979 so you would normally give them slack, but seeing how clear the last two assignments are you have to wonder why the first 4 are not. I can only guess they switched from film to video.",1391817600,2,1103,4.222748815165877

2157962,5,B00061QJIA,"Before I begin my review there are some rather good reviews here of this rather ground breaking show, and I hope my review does some justice these programmes.
A science fiction show that relied more on haunting atmosphere good scripts coupled with great dialogue. There was little in way of special effects and the sets were rather claustrophobic and `closed' there were no real external shots that I can remember - so very much a studio based production and even viewing today (October 2013) these programmes are still as gripping as I saw them when I was younger. My only regret is that there were not more episodes. The characters played by David Collings as Silver, David McCallum as Steel and Joanna Lumley as Sapphire were done brilliantly. For me it was a show that raised more questions than answers. You knew little or nothing of the background of our `investigators' or more correctly termed as Operators - what was there overall agenda? Who was there boss/control? There were strong hints that these Operators were not human. I guess this feel of the unknown and unanswered questions keeps me returning to this series from time to time.

If you are fan of good Science fiction then this box set is well worth getting.",1386547200,2,1228,4.765258215962441
2157963,4,B00061QJIA,"How could I, as a self-respecting fan of The Avengers (the Patrick Macnee TV classic, not the comic book entity) resist 34 half hour episodes of a different sci-fi/fantasy series in which Joanna Lumley appears, solves mysteries of time and space and appears decked out in one wondrous style after another?

To me, Joanna Lumley is the whirling warrior of bizarre crime in 1977's The New Avengers, the fourth partner of John Steed on his various quirky quests. Others know her best from Absolutely Fabulous or even James and the Giant Peach, in roles that were broader and less flattering but proof that she's a actor with no fear.

Her smooth, deep voice also graces many an audio book. She sounds like the caramel inside a Cadbury Bar if it could speak.

Sapphire shows little fear either. Steel is well, Steely. David McCallum is generally not known for his zaniness. In his two American series, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. and The Invisible Man, his persona is stern as it is here, though Steel is even more dour.

Sapphire and Steel is a TV recipe blending a few slices of time travel from Doctor Who, a helping of serial format similar to that of Dark Shadows and a dash of Upstairs, Downstairs (particularly in Assignment 5). There's even a little of Land of the Lost here, in that the scripts are far more ambitious than the visuals, but they do the best they can and hope you'll let your imagination fill in the rest. (The premise of a ""rip in time"" is not unlike the 2005 Doctor Who episode, ""Father's Day."")

Shot on videotape, the series has sparse special effects that appear quickly and carefully to obscure their modest nature. The sets, nice as they are, become really, really familiar to you as the actors spend lots of time on them.

Each of the six untitled ""Assignments"" are  clusters of episodes that make up individual story arcs. An Assignment can run anywhere from four to six half-hour episodes.

My favorite is the fifth one, which features the largest cast and the most dry wit. A millionaire throws a 30's party in which nothing contemporary is allowed. When such anomalies occur, there are these ""rips in time"" and it's time for Sapphire and Steel to crash the party, get bossy when murders seem to occur and even give one of the guests their power of telepathy.

A few caveats, I'm a fan of the musical director, Cyril Ornadel, who did a number of fine recordings I grew up with, as well as the Original Cast Album of My Fair Lady. But don't let theme music and the stentorian announcer make you think the show is campy. It's actually very serious, highly ethereal and ambiguous.

Also don't expect the pace and panache of the recent Doctor Who episodes that began in 2005. The stories are leisurely paced and require focused attention as they can be serpentine and puzzling (some never really make sense by their own design).

My advice is to avoid binge-viewing Sapphire and Steel, but to watch one or two at a time and return to it fresh. Otherwise it seems to wander and so does your concentration. Savor each episode.

Approach Sapphire and Steel as a collection of imaginative teleplays, not mini-movies. Let he series unfold before you on its own fascinating terms.",1377820800,5,3197,4.658969804618117
2157964,2,B00061QJIA,It seems that this series has a considerable following and very good reviews. (which is why I ordered it) Personally I found it really slow and boring.

2157965,5,B00061QJIA,"The title of this review is how I imagine the series creator pitched the idea of show to the powers that be. Sure, people like to link this series to the X-Files today but in many ways that undercuts Sapphire & Steel.

The series follows assignments of two intergalactic policemen assigned to correct fractures in time. Like the peak of The Avengers (Diana Rigg Era), we never really know who assigns these two to their assignments or who they really work for. The structure of the series is exact to Doctor Who, half hour episodes which are linked together by a cliffhanger before the story's conclusion.

I feel the stories are more grown up and darker than anything you'd see on Doctor Who. The story lines are often complex and the conclusions are some times  bleak and bitter.

The overall atmosphere of the series is highly claustrophobic with each story basically taking place in a single location. This does make each story more penetrating for the viewer because often the settings are a major part of the story.

The acting and chemistry from Lumley and McCallum is brilliant and the few supporting actors play their roles well.

The series consists of only six stories . I wonder if the show was cancelled or if the series creator, P.J. Hammond simply ran out of ideas. This series screams obscure cult following much like the 1960's classic The Prisoner. Short lived, revolutionary but far too obscure to be digested by its present day masses. X-Files does recall elements of this series but in many ways, this series is much darker and this is because the stories have more time to develop.

The American A&E set is well made and the only issue I have with it is the story's individual episodes don't run together. You have to go back to the DVD menu and select the next episode and click through the Chapter Index Menu. This ruined a story for me because the titles in the Chapter Index for the episodes are basically spoilers if you pause and read them. I had to learn not to do that. It's a flaw which is not worth removing a star from my rating but it is still a flaw.

I recommend buying, or renting this set and watching each story IN ORDER (or at least saving the 6th story for last)",1344729600,8,2203,4.531486146095718
2157966,3,B00061QJIA,"1978-81 was a kind of strange golden age for UK SF/Fantasy TV, including ""Blake's 7,"" the second half of Tom Baker's long run as ""Dr. Who,"" and this show. ""Sapphire and Steel"" is an utterly unique show, perhaps too much so, which would partially explain why it ""only"" managed to crank out six serials in its four-year run. (There are audios and other stories, too...)

The package cover blurb compares it to ""The X Files"" for some reason. Sure, it's about a male agent and a female agent investigating supernatural incidents, but that's as far as the overall comparison can go. The agents, and their fellow ""elementals"" (for lack of a formal term) make for interesting and engaging characters, though thoroughly weird, too.

These stories feel a lot like advanced stage plays with a lot of effects, and therefore like a TV serial with minimal effects, and these visual, sound, and editing effects are put to maximum effect, which is more than can be said for several 21st century SF films and shows. Yes, there is a datedness to it, and some strange social artifacts of another place and time, but ""S&S"" has such a strong strangeness about it that it goes beyond timeless.

(Quick note: Serial titles are my short-hand approximations of the set's titles)
Story 1, ""Crack in Time,"" runs like a British version of TZ's ""Little Girl Lost"" or ""Poltergeist,"" with two kids whose parents are still in the house, but stuck in a strange series of time warps, and it just gets weirder from there.
2: ""Railway Station"" -- The agents find a lonely ghost-hunter, and spirits from Britain's 20th century wars, but there's a bigger, darker force behind it all.
3: ""Creature's Revenge"" -- the absolute darkest, creepiest, most abstract and mind-blowing serial in the whole set
4: ""Man w/o Face"" -- the power of objects, photographs, memories, and the innocence of children inside and out of them; good concept, and a tale with more emotion and drama than usual for ""S & S.""
5: ""Dr. McDee Must Die"" -- the agents enter a contemporary (1980) house to attend a 1930s party, with ever more murders and deaths in a race against time to prevent a viral outbreak. It sometimes runs like an attempt at dark humor.
6: ""Trap"" -- the final story, just as mysterious, suspenseful, and multi-layered as any of the earlier stories, bringing the show to an intriguing close....

The version I ended up getting was A&E's old space-wasting set, although I've heard of newer, slimmer packaging (?)
The only extras are some random commentaries and a scrapbook.

2157967,5,B00061QJIA,"What would you do if you lived in the late 70s/early 80s and harbored a deep desire to watch a show that featured transdimensional time traveling agents, cryptic story lines, and obscure plot twists galore? You could wait for the X-Files to air, but since Agents Mulder and Scully wouldn't be along for a couple of decades, why you watched Sapphire and Steel, of course.

This was a series that way way ahead of its time, starring Joanna Lumley and David McCallum as the lead operatives Sapphire and Steel, with a penchant to deliver their dialog with minimal changes in facial expression (thus predicting the widespread use of botox in the not-too-distant future) and to frequently gaze into the middle distance as they...well, operated.

Bizarre but brilliant. There was one particularly  creepy arc of episodes of folks from the future who lived in an apartment that turned out to be alive....

2157973,4,B00061QJIA,"""Sapphire and Steel"" is terribly dated, but also totally awesome. If you enjoy other examples of low-budget but thoughtful science fiction (e.g. Doctor Who, Babylon 5, old Star Trek), you'll probably get a kick out of this show as well.

The protagonists are a pair of super-powered cosmic beings (David McCallum as Steel, and Joanna Lumley as Sapphire) who are tasked with repairing damage to the fabric of Time itself. They are opposed by a series of vaguely defined but clearly formidable opponents, including a faceless creature with the power to trap its victims in old photographs, a sentient wall of darkness, and the angry ghost of a World War I soldier. As you have probably already gathered, the storylines involving these characters are rather imaginative and bizarre in the extreme.

Every aspect of the show's production style is ""old school,"" so you need to approach it with certain expectations. ""Sapphire and Steel"" was shot with cheap video cameras on obvious studio sets, and made minimal use of (mostly bad) special effects. But despite these production problems, the show still has a memorably eerie atmosphere; it's a testament, really, to what a clever production team can achieve in the absence of a mega-huge budget.

The show also benefits from two excellent central performances. Lumley shines in an unusually strong role; I think it's worth noting that, up to the late 1970s, neither Star Trek nor Doctor Who managed to create a female character as powerful or prominent as Sapphire. McCallum, meanwhile, is memorably formidable and ruthless as Steel. Both actors play their parts with complete conviction, which gives much-needed credibility to their delightfully weird material.

So if you haven't seen ""Sapphire and Steel"" before, and are considering buying this box set ... I say, go for it, provided you have a tolerance for dated production values, and an interest in sci-fi that's more about ideas than spectacle. They certainly don't make science fiction like this anymore, and that's mostly a bad thing; there's a lot that the production teams of today's overblown sci-fi shows could learn from watching a cerebral, creepy, and minimalist production such as this one.",1295568000,2,2203,5.145251396648045

2157978,1,B00061QJIA,"I read all the glowing reviews of this ITV series expecting something unusual but, at the same time, well-written, well-acted, and well-staged akin to the late, VERY lamented 'Firefly'.

I was deeply disappointed.

As much as I liked David McCallum in ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."", his acting abilities here as the taciturn Steel run the gamut from A to B.  Joanne Lumley is better as Sapphire, who seems to be what we would call a psychic but is still forced to be the damsel in distress when she's not playing a maternal role to that week's guest star, rather than a supra-natural, noncorporeal entity in human form like she's supposed to be.

How Sapphire and Steel know what to do in dealing with 'disruptions in time' (which seems to be an early name for wormholes) seems to be one long series of non-sequiturs.  Something inexplicable happens, then Sapphire and Steel suddenly show up (how they know where and when to show up is never explained), then something else happens (insert some cheezy special effect here and pretend it's scary), then Steel does something (takes a kitchen stove apart, for example), then Sapphire 'feels' something (insert some other cheezy special effect here), then a third thing happens, then Steel does something else (maybe puts the stove back together again), then insert a third cheezy special effect here and pretend it's scary. It's simply a random collection of events strung together and called a plot.

I badly wanted 'Sapphire and Steel' to be much more than it is - a bewildering TV series that provides no insight for the various storyline twists.  Half the time the outcome has nothing to do with the beginning. The viewer is provided with NO information that allows any level of understanding of the implications of what could, or would, happen if these time disruptions aren't set right again.  Nor is there any explanation as to how Sapphire or, more likely, Steel, knows what action to take to start correcting the situation.

If you like simply sitting back and accepting what happens without trying to reason through WHY these disruptions happen WHEN they happen, WHAT IT MEANS when they happen, or HOW their attempts at resolving these disruptions are supposed to work and WHY some of their attempts fail, then this is the series for you.",1271376000,12,2291,4.868894601542417

It is, in fact, very good television.
McCallum, who rose to fame in ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."" and now stars as ""Ducky"" in the ""NCIS"" franchise, is wonderful as a by-the-book investigator/agent. Joanna Lumley, meanwhile, is perfect as his sexy partner who is not afraid to cross boundaries and break a few rules when it means successfully completing the mission.
The verdict: A 4.5 star series that's both fun and interesting.",1498348800,5,887,5.082191780821918

8036601,2,B00061QJIA,I quit watching and put the set into the charity pick up box.  I am from the same era as David McCallum and loved him in Man From UNCLE in the 60s.  This series was made in the 70s and is so full of dialogue/political tastes of the creators that it just wasn't any fun to watch.  I wanted to watch a mystery type of story for pure entertainment.,1487462400,,345,3.971014492753623
8036602,2,B00061QJIA,What a bomb.  Unbelievably slow pacing and stupid dialogue.  Even Lumley and McCallum can't save this one.  Save your money.,1481414400,2,124,5.1
