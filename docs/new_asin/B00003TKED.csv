Her voice is an incredibly versatile instrument, capable of huge power and great gentleness-sometimes within a few notes of each other. In this video, a compilation of her gospel tracks, that vocal talent ceratinly shines through, but there is one thing even more striking then Candi's vocals and that's the absolute sincerity and conviction she brings to each performances. For those of us who have folowed Candi's career down thorough the years the obvious joy she finds in her faith is wonderful to see. Even more importantly for those of us struggling with life's challenges day to day, here is a gospel artist who can connect with us in the real world, someone who can really inspired us with hope because when Candi sings  about a God who saves you can feel that she's not just singing lyrics-this is a performer who puts her whole life experience into every line. This is video isn't just for the Gospel Fan-it's for everyone who enjoys music which comes from the heart and touches the soul.",979257600,,1207,4.747619047619048
