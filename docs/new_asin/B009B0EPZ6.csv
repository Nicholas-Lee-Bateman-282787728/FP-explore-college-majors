First, the story and story-telling are both excellent. The tone starts light enough, but the stakes are soon raised; and yet, right when you think you now have a handle on the arc of the show, it throws a monkey-wrench into those expectations and kicks the story into an even higher gear, leading to a dramatic, epic, and just-about-perfect ending. Without spoiling anything, the story is sort of like if you took the plots of Chrono Cross (a video game for the original Playstation), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (a film starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet), the Matrix (that should not need an introduction), and the Running Man/Battle Royale/Hunger Games. That is to say, the story fuses sci-fi, romance, drama, a little bit of comedy, and an evolving mystery to fantastic effect.

And beyond the story itself, the manner in which it is told is great. There are more than a couple surprises along the way, but there are also key details and evolving threads the viewer can catch if they're really paying attention that pay off as the story goes along, and that is always satisfying if you like sleuthing and appreciate the creative manifestation of themes. But perhaps what I love most about the way the story is told is that it is eminently personal while also being larger-than-life science-fiction. Indeed, beyond all the incredible events, reality-plus elements, and dramatic twists, the show is, at its heart, a love story, and a touching one at that. If you've ever been involved in a relationship that seemed to come out of nowhere but quickly became very important, this show will resonate with you.

The acting is great, especially from the two leads. Gouriki Ayame was already one of my favorite J-drama actresses, as she can do comedy and drama equally well, but she is simply fantastic here, in particular because the story and her character necessitated a great range of performance. She is especially enjoyable in the romance-focused scenes. By contrast, I was previously unfamiliar with Okada Misaki, but he also puts in a top performance. The rest of the cast is quite good, especially the actor playing Kinjiro, Okada Yoshinori.

The score is brilliant, particularly the music related to the romance thread, as well as a couple of the incidental atmosphere pieces. Likewise, the visual production is great in just about all respects. Truly, I have nothing bad to say about the show itself.

However, I will criticize one thing about this box set: the subtitles in the final two episodes (episodes 10 and 11) are notably lower in quality than those for the first ten episodes. Indeed, the subtitles in the first 9 episodes are great---no problems aside from one or two small, unimportant typos spread over the nine episodes. However, the final two episodes were clearly subtitled by a different person, and feature significantly more errors.

However, even saying that, at no point are the subtitles in those episodes truly a problem, as nothing is unclear or unreadable. But it's just a bit jarring to go from great subtitles for nine straight episodes to middling ones suddenly near the end. As for the on-screen logo and semi-spoiler commercial sequences mentioned by the other reviewer, I don't really mind the former (the TV logo is small, and the DVD company logo only shows up briefly and is not overly bothersome to me), though I admit the latter are a bit annoying the first time you watch the show (as I don't want a scene spoiled if I'm about to watch it anyway). Still, this box set is certainly not unique with that issue, as a lot of these all-region J-drama box sets feature brief commercial segments with semi-spoilers (while a few others provide non-spoiler footage during the sequences, while still others just show thematic or artistic imagery behind the brief commercial segments---obviously the most sensible approach).

Regardless, those are minor complaints, and I certainly still recommend buying the show if you like J-drama, Gouriki Ayame, sci-fi, or epic romance stories. Class.",1492560000,,4201,4.909859154929578

What You Get

Note that there are two Future Diary (Mirai Nikki) productions, anime and live action.  This is the live action version.  Although the general premise is similar in both versions, the story line is pretty different, so think of them as separate stories.  I prefer this version, but fans of anime tend to like that one better.

This product comes on 3 DVDs, 11 episodes of about 35 minutes each.  The box is attractive and folds out for easy access to each disk.

The DVD format is ""all regions"".  I live in the US and it played fine on my locally-purchased player.  However, I've bought other ""all region"" DVDs and only half of them work on that machine, so be aware that these disks might not work for you if you're in North America.  I'm a fan of Japanese and Korean shows, so I bought an all-region DVD player that plays everything (the ""Sony All Multi Region Zone Code DVD Player"" that sells here on Amazon for $38).  If compatibility concerns you, you might consider getting an all-region player.

Pros

I love this show.  I originally saw it on an Internet site that offers Asian shows if you don't mind watching commercials.  I decided to get the DVDs so I could watch it without commercials, and to be able to show it to friends and family.

Without spoiling the plot, I'll say that the story really keeps you guessing.  Rewatching it, I've picked up on many details that I missed the first time.  As a survival game it's a pretty good story, but partway through the direction changes and the plot becomes even more interesting.

I was pleased with the picture quality.

Cons

The video displays a discreet light gray logo in the corner throughout.  A minor annoyance, but if I spend $40 on a show I expect to be able to watch it without logos.  Much worse is that for the first 4 minutes of episodes 1, 5, and 8, it also displays a bright red ""DVD Version"" logo, which moves from side to side on a trail of fire.  Now, I don't mind that we're treated to a full screen of the ""DVD Version"" logo before the show starts (we're all used to seeing studio logos before we get into the show), but the bright red and trail of fire during the first 4 minutes is highly distracting and frankly inexcusable.

The English subtitles for the first 9 episodes are serviceable, but spotty in places, and incorrect in some instances.  The subtitles in the online version were better, which surprised me because normally I find the ones on DVDs to be superior.  Not here.  ""I don't know why *I* did it"" is very different from ""I don't know why *he* did it"".  And ""I like you"" is really not the same as ""I envy you"" -- you can envy a person without liking him, so the use of ""like"" really misses the point of the scene and comes across as a strange thing to say.  Flashbacks sometimes have no translation of the Japanese text (for example ""6 months ago"").  Sure I can see the ""6"", but is that hours, weeks, or years?  Likewise sometimes the camera will zoom in on a sign and there's no translation in the subtitles (the online version did provide a translation).

However, that's nothing compared to the subtitles for the last two episodes, which seem to have been done by different people with much lower language skills.  These subtitles are embarrassingly bad, riddled with broken English and nearly incomprehensible in places.

Partway through each episode there's a pause to display ""Nissan"" in the center of the screen while a Japanese gal provides voiceover as upcoming scenes play in the background.  I realize that this first appeared as a TV series, but the Nissan promos were not in the online version, so what the hell?  I bought the DVDs so I could watch the story without commercial interruptions, and the Nissan-sponsored upcoming scenes are unwanted spoilers.

Summary

A very enjoyable story, good picture quality and boxing, but only 3 stars for the low-quality subtitles and the annoying logos and advertising interruptions, which really spoil what should have been an immersive viewing experience.",1420588800,3,4113,4.596153846153846
