I grew up watching digimon in the 90's as a kid and I would love to see the characters from the original series grown up and what not, but $70 for Part 1 of a trilogy?  Are you serious?  Japanese films are starting to become more and more overpriced as time goes by, and American retailers, especially in Northern California, are seriously ripping off customers on ""collectors"" kids shows.",1482364800,,416,4.830985915492958
8726477,5,B012QLKQ3G,"Digimon Tri is a great start to catch back up with the series.
With the characters growing up and dealing with threat from the digital world, this first entry is a great continuation to the original.
 While a bit more serious, the movie focuses on Tai's dilemma as well as catching the audience back up with the original 8. If you are a fan of Digimon, go ahead and check this out!",1476489600,,381,4.291666666666667
8726478,2,B012QLKQ3G,"Luckily the first two Digimon Adventure Tri films are on Hulu because I was able to watch them for free. But if I'd paid good money for these to either own or see in the theater I'd be pretty upset. Next to nothing has happened in the first two films, or 8 episodes if you're watching on Hulu. Tai is so concerned with damage being done to the city, Joe is so sad because he has to study all the time and become an adult eventually, Mimi is hurt that no one likes her ideas and fashion, Izzy is angry no one listens to him, Matt is unhappy with Tai because he won't put up a fight....

Collectively across the first two films it's about 90% angsty brooding and maybe 6% action and 4% comedy.

To have the original digidestined return and then to give us this nonsense? Rather than digimon adventure they should call it ""Digimon you were a kid when you loved this and now you're an adult so you should be self reflective and sad...tri.""

I don't like to be that person who complains that, ""nothing happens!"" but honest to God, nothing happens. There's a half fight at the end of the first one? They have a new version of Butterfly as the theme? I don't even know. Just absolutely disappointing. If I'd seen this in the theater in Japan I'd walk out and demand my money back.

What was once an entertaining, light hearted, imaginative show about adventure is now a sad, depressing, reflection on the real world. It's no longer an escape to the digital world, for the digidestined or for us.",1466208000,4,1488,4.3610108303249095
