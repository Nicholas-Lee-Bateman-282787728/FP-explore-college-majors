8034726,5,B0002YE28A,"If you like classical and sacred gospel, this is the one for you. Only 50 minutes, but good. I saw the tail end of it,(10 mins.) on DayStar church channel, and grabbed my tape and taped those last 10 minutes.  I was in heaven listening and mesmerized by the music, especially Resurrection.  Dino plays some of our favorites.

This won't be a waste.  I'm just sorry it is only 50 mins. Should be a 2.0 hr. tape/show or l. 5 hr.  Good music you hate for it to end.

Love it.",1367020800,,472,4.131868131868132
