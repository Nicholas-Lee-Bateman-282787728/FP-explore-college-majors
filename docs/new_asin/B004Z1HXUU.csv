The pregnant woman, never appeared pregnant and the other mother was just to accomodating for the story to seem real to me. I love this Genre of movies and thats what made me purchase it.

Then you get hit with a bang. The type a bang in a film that has you thinking whats next. Asking you the who, what, when, and why.

4504250,3,B004Z1HXUU,"I like stage plays and this one was good.

PROS

It was clean and wholesome.  I like the fact that it dealt with ""loving oneself"" in order to demand proper love and respect.

CONS

It dealt with forgiveness and YES, that's a good thing.  However, usually in these stage plays where women are hurting, the writers push past the emotions to deal with the forgives.  Nonetheless most of these writers eliminate the fact that these emotions have to be worked through.  People who usually deny their emotions now find that they come back to haunt them later.

Overall, it was a good play.  Even my son liked watching it.",1401667200,,615,4.559633027522936

Some things that bothered me though: the constant ""bad breath"" references were annoying and not necessary, couldn't understand why they were having a baby shower so early on when she wasn't even showing. I was glad to see the main couple decide to stay together. Thought that the other couple would decide to get together but we're not sure what happens with that. The singing was unnecessary. Glad that only happened one time. Overall, it kept my interest despite these things.",1396742400,,536,4.9010989010989015

4504270,1,B004Z1HXUU,"The cover is the best part about this movie. It was so choppy (all over the place) and the minor details were not realistic e.g. baby shower but she's not at all showing, all family randomly coming over, baby shower gift says the opposite gender of what she's having, and no fake sink for the hair shop or other tools. Overall it was boring; my mom fell asleep. Some jokes were drawn out - going on uncomfortably too long, and some people were over-acting. I didn't laugh once in this comedy.

4504275,4,B004Z1HXUU,This play was overall good. The beginning was good enough to have me continue watching. But I must say the middle didn't grab me as much. The ending as just a little un real. It was a great subject but lack complete interest.,1367712000,,225,4.255813953488372

4504283,4,B004Z1HXUU,The reason I gave this movie four stars because it the plot was good. I like the actors in the movie. There were many things I didn't agree with because they weren't real life. For example...who has a baby shower for someone who is a couple of weeks into being pregnant. Overall it was a decent film/play.,1360454400,,305,4.368421052631579
4504284,5,B004Z1HXUU,"Wow and Wow! I will tell you that I have started this play over several times and could not get into this play at first due to many many reasons. Many distractions caused me not to be able to watch this movie through several times.

So tonight we watched this movie all the way through several times on a great quite evening. So I said this to say, if you start this play and don't like this play, just give this play a chance.

To start off about this movie, this movie started of with good laughs and I love the clothes and decorations on the set.

This movie speaks reality and tells the truth about many situations. For one why do some men always want to know where their woman/wife's locations is at all times? Why do men cheat on their wives and then lie about it? Why do some women cheat with married men? Why do some men always want things their way? How do you know if you are with the right person, the wrong person? If you want to know the answers/solutions to theses questions, watch this play..

No commitments, no strings attached, do you say this, have you heard someone else say this? Watch this play. Do you love yourself? Do you refuse to set yourself up to go through the pain that you may have seen growing up? Watch this play. Are you looking for a husband? Do you know the deal breakers for a relationship? Do you think that just because a man has good attributes he is a good husband. Buy this play.

This play will inspire you and touch you in so many ways.

This play is so so great and awesome full of surprises and jokes that will make you roll on the floor laughing. And you know anytime Shirley Murdock is in something, it will be great.

The only regret I have is not being able to watch this on the first attempt, but life happens and life calls and at least I have the ability to watch this any time I want, even if I have to stop the play and start over.  I will say this, there are many parts that you will want to stop and rewind anyway.

And as far as the woman not showing while pregnant, I really think that the reason for this was because sometimes during the stages of pregnancy, women go through different things during each trimester. I think this was a message that the woman was in the early stages of life in the womb and how her decision would impact the life that was in her womb.

I could be wrong, but I think there was a message for the reason she was not showing. And remember some women don't show until the end anyway. Many women carry their babies different.

Great cast! I love the different faces in this play. I love myself better than that! Amen! Great play with Godly solutions! Great christian play, that shows faith, love, forgiveness, honesty, repentance, what God do you serve?, endurance, a family that not only talked the talk, but walked it! Fight for your marriage, many people don't. This is a great play to share with your church, community, date night, girls night, couple's night, etc. The issues are real and need to be told, keep plays like this coming.

Get your hot coco, tea, and popcorn ready!  Amos 3:3",1356825600,,3080,4.289655172413793
4504285,3,B004Z1HXUU,"It does not stick to plot and left me wondering if characters were just thrown in for ratings.  It had some interesting topics, however.",1356652800,,136,4.666666666666667
4504286,1,B004Z1HXUU,it's an demo and some of the show was off. but it's was good. but wouldn't rate it at all.,1354233600,,90,3.55
4504287,2,B004Z1HXUU,This movie featured some good actors but the story line was long and drawn out. Some parts of the movie were dry and just too long.,1350691200,,131,4.076923076923077
4504288,5,B004Z1HXUU,"Well, when I first saw the artwork for this film, I didn't know what to expect. I recognized the names and thought...hmmm...is this going to be one of those ""not sure what to think of this"" kind of movie where everyone is basiscally doing the same thing they did in their last film? or if it was going to be another ""typical"" and ""predictable"" urban film. Nonetheless, I took the plunge.

Right now, I'm thanking my lucky stars that I chose to ""click"" the order button. Not only is the story ""very real and important"" it was told in a manner that is realistic to believeable. Any couple can and will enjoy this timeless story of love and forgiveness. If I was married I would want my husband to see it. There are really strong performances by the leading ladies, (sorry don't know all the names); plus meaningful performances by the veteran actors Jackee and Clifton Powell, and yes even the young barber who was ""always late"" sorry didn't get his name either; he made an impressionable performance. I expect to see great things from him and these wonderful leading ladies soon. Ginuine the R&B singer, came in at the right time and seals the deal!! Even though he didn't sing he's still HOT after all this time.

To top it all hit R&B Queen, Shirly Murdock sings one of her signature songs; (I won't spoil it for you) you gotta order a copy to see her WOW you yourself!  All of this coupled with the great WRITING...is a great summer movie for everyone...your entire family will enjoy it!!

Thanks for reading!!!",1345334400,,1513,4.551470588235294
4504289,5,B004Z1HXUU,I had never heard of this play before I purchased it and I was pleasantly surprised. I liked it so much that I told my friends to go get it too. This play arrived at my house in record time and I recommend the item and seller to all.,1345075200,,233,3.7755102040816326
4504290,4,B004Z1HXUU,I watch the movie and thought abou myself in what I am looking for in a husband. It gave me some ideas about what I am looking for in husband and what I want. It was a good movie.,1341187200,,179,3.6153846153846154

4504293,5,B004Z1HXUU,"Refreshing! There was nothing unrealistic about this movie. It was wonderful to see Biblical Principles exercised for conflict resolution. The Word of God will Work, it you Work the Word! Faith in God, Love, Humility, Godly Repentance, Forgiveness... can take you where poor imitations cannot.

This video was encouraging. Many of us have been some of these characters and/or know someone who has. I loved how Shirley Murdock ministered to the young lady in a non judgmental manner where she would actually hear what was being spoken to her. She was wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove...Also, the young lady who loved her boyfriend had to realize her worth and draw a line in the sand. Yes! that brotha was fine! BUT he did not want to have anything to do with her GOD--deal breaker. How can two walk together unless they be agreed? She was indeed wife material and refused to no longer settle. Jackee told how she was the one who had to be forgiven, I did not see that one coming!

Christians will make mistakes and God knows this that is why HE provides instructions on what Believers are to do when they make a mistake. He also provides instructions for when we see our Brothers and Sisters overtaken in a fault. When our heart is right towards God and we follow HIS instructions, that is what makes us perfect in GOD's eyesight, not the Worlds.

The only real issue I had was not making the wife ""look"" pregnant. I could not understand the rationale. Otherwise, it was great!",1332547200,,1485,4.59622641509434

8449184,5,B004Z1HXUU,"I enjoyed the stage play, and Mr. Henson is wonderful.  As an established actor, he does not have to lend himself to help new writers, producers, and actors of color.  I admire him and others; therefore, I will support what he promotes.  If you don't like what you see, research the company, writer, producer, etc., and send them a private message.  Do not openly criticize their work because Amazon is a billion dollar a year industry, and those in Hollywood who have the clout to support with dollars, give people of color a seat at the table; are not inclined to do so, when they see negative reviews.  And sadly, the negative reviews are always from people of color, then we complain when we don't see enough of us in what we label ""A"" movies.  More recently, complaining about the Oscars and the lack of ethnic representation.  Well, it starts here!  When Black filmmakers, actors, etc., are new, the quality will not be as good as a Steven Spielberg film, but support it anyway, and keep the negative opinions off open forums like Amazon, Facebook, Youtube, etc...",1456790400,,1070,4.684491978609626
