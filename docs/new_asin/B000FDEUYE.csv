I have never seen UJR live but have heard Scorpions albums but never UJR's solo work. This guy is a whiz and cool how he designs all of his guitars with extra frets etc. so he controls the music for sure. The first songs are all over the place instrumentals and UJR is dazzling so all of that works. When UFO gets up with him it almost looks like he saves Schenker sometimes who looks very much worse for wear and well........fat! and out of shape. He still plays good (get his 2015 concert DVD and you will see he got serious again) but UJR seems to pull him out sometimes and they at least conflict just a little bit here and there. Jack Bruce gets up and UJR work great together, UJR kind of gets off a little bit from what Bruce is playing but thats OK because guitarists like UJR can easily hide or fix it. Some may find UJR overpowering and dominating but he restrains himself pretty well.  I would highly recommend this just to have part of history but do get Schenkers newest concert 2015 DVD.",1465084800,,1094,4.160377358490566
8121306,5,B000FDEUYE,Wonderful compilation!  Great experience with this seller.,1427673600,,58,7.285714285714286
8121307,4,B000FDEUYE,I thought this was excellent;was great with UFO on stage. Yes michael looked somewhat shaggy but he still was right on with ULI JON!I saw in some reviews it was said Schenker was drunk but i didn't see it. AWESOME FOR GUYS PUSHING 60! Oh i didn't forget about JACK BRUCE awesome!!!!,1296604800,2,282,4.4423076923076925
8121308,5,B000FDEUYE,"This is probably the best production hard guitar rock retro concert out there. Camera work, sound and picture quality are 1st rate. It seems that all the German produced concerts are of the best quality. Hats off to German precision.",1261094400,,233,4.85
8121309,2,B000FDEUYE,"A real let-down for me, probably because I had such high expectations.  Uli Roth, in my opinion, is one of the best guitarists I've ever heard.  His playing skills, even on this DVD are evident.  I just expected more from a master.

The near-constant playing of the highest pitched notes on the fret board got iritating as did the exagerated over-use of vibrato.  And what's with the costume.  Uli, you're not playing to a majority teen audience anymore.  The mysterious robes and headband don't work.  The long hair/ male pattern baldness thing is almost like a comb-over. And what's with that jewel on that axe?  I thought I was looking at the artist formerly known as White Prince.  Lastly, his vocals just don't cut it, never did.  Can someone please tell him this?  Uli- DIVERSIFY.  Try a Les Paul on for size, mix it up, play a different, lower part of that fret board now and then.  You're a true master who can do much better.

My most blistering coments are reserved for UFO.  Michael has realized that costumes, leather pants, and the other 70's & 80's get-ups are unnecessary in 2006-7 and that's good.  His playing, however, was just plain sloppy -as if he has not been practicing in a while.  He will always be one of my favorites but why do I have to pay to hear what sounds like a beginner trying to play old UFO riffs and solos?",1172793600,4,1344,4.483471074380165
8121310,4,B000FDEUYE,"FOR SURE THIS DVD IS VERY ENJOYABLE WITH JACK BRUCE, UFO AND MICHAEL SCHENKER AND ALSO MUSICIANS LIKE CLIVE BUNKER AND  DON AIREY IS VERY COOL.

THE SOUND AND PICTURE IS VERY HOT BUT FOR SURE IT WAS JUST BEFORE ULI CANCELLED THE REST OF THE TOUR WITH UFO/SCHENKER BECAUSE SCHENKER WAS TOO MUCH ON ALCOHOL AND IF YOU CAN LISTEN TO ROCK BOTTOM, HE HAVE SO MUCH MISERY TO PLAY (MAKING LICKS) HE ALWAYS MADE AND IT'S ULI WHO FINALLY BLOW THE GUITAR FOR THAT PART(MIDDLE OF THE SONG), ALSO (ULI)HE'S SO HOT IN LET IT ROLL MAKING HOT LEAD PARTS.

IT WAS FOR US THE OPPORTUNITY TO FINALLY HAVE A CONCERT WITH THE 2 HOTTEST MASTERS OF GERMAN GUITAR FOR THE 1ST TIME AND SCHENKER IS DRUNK !

HOPE THAT IT WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR US TO SEE IT AGAIN WITH A SCHENKER IN BETTER SHAPE.

ALSO, I HOPE THAT ULI WILL RELEASE A COMPLETE CONCERT OF HIS OWN STUFF IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

LONG LIFE TO ULI, (SOBER)MICHAEL AND UFO !",1172707200,2,904,4.166666666666667
8121311,5,B000FDEUYE,"As mentioned by another reviewer, Uli Jon Roth is an extremely talented, overlooked guitarist.  After hearing his name mentioned by a lot of other guitarist, I got his Transendental Sky Guitar CD.  I was knocked out by the depth of the feeling in his playing both classical and rock.  I looked for quite a while for a live DVD of him.  I got the ""Historic Performances vol I & II"" and where as his playing is great, the video and audio were not.  This one is has great video and audio, Michael Schenker/UFO and Jack Bruce, plus 2 CD's.  This hard to beat.",1169596800,4,555,4.339805825242719
8121312,4,B000FDEUYE,"Great DVD, good audio. It's great to see Uli rocking out. He's an incredible, overlooked guitarist. His playing on Scorpions ""In Trance"" album back in the 70's is phenomenal. UFO comes out and joins Uli to play ""Let it roll"", ""Rock Bottom"", and ""Doctor Doctor"". Michael Schenker's playing is on fire. Legend Jack Bruce comes out and joins Uli on ""Sunshine of your love"" and ""White room"", impeccable bass playing. Uli does ""Little Wing"" and the highlight of the show ""All along the watchtower"". Uli plays it note for note, he captures Hendrix's passion & fire. If this weren't enough 2 CDs are included of the concert. What a deal!!!!",1165968000,8,633,4.763636363636364
8121313,5,B000FDEUYE,"This DVD is excellent,Audio & Video is great,this is best one of the rest of Uli's, compare to the other dvds he's got out I know cause' I've watched the other ones,but there are better songs on the others but are kind of bootleg quality,I recomend this DVD to any Uli fan, is worth the money and it comes with 1 DVD and 2 cds this deserves 5 stars. Rock on!",1152057600,2,358,4.056338028169014
