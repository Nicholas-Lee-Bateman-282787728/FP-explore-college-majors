2393007,5,B000ASKJZI,I bought this DVD to supplement my at home yoga practice.  I found it to be very gentle and beneficial.  The entire DVD is wonderful!

THANK YOU!,1210982400,3,326,4.366666666666666
2393008,5,B000ASKJZI,I use this dvd on an almost daily basis and have found it wonderfully relaxing and gentle... just what I need from a yoga practice at this point in my life.  I also take the Pulling Down the Moon yoga classes in Washington DC and have found the instructor and the practice to be a great support to me.  The dvd is very similar to what we do in person.  I highly recommend this dvd to women who are looking to supplement their fertility holistic care with an at-home yoga practice.,1205884800,10,480,4.252747252747253
2393009,5,B000ASKJZI,"The practices that Tami and Beth have created here are gentle, so special for women like us going through this journey.  This is not the time to do hard core yoga or stretch like a pretzel, more to use yoga to gently exercise, relax, open up and let go- and this is exactly what this DVD helps you do.

This program was created by these two women that have experienced themselves all the emotions and stress of infertility and who used yoga as a way get grounded and balanced.

The DVD separates Breathing, Visualizations, Asana (postures)practice, Meditation, etc.. in different chapters so you can do just one at a time, in whatever order you feel like.  The music and their voices are subtle and gentle and the sceneries and pictures they use are beautiful!

As a Chicago resident, I am lucky enough to be able to go to their holistic center for fertility- Pulling Down the Moon.  A beautiful space with great services like acupuncture, massage, nutrition, yoga, among others. Can't wait for their book (Fully Fertile) to come out!
This is my second month going to the center and doing their yoga practices and I feel 1000% better!

And the baby?.... it WILL come...",1203552000,21,1169,4.673170731707317

8079673,5,B000ASKJZI,"Love, love, love this DVD. It really helps to relax you, while I always thought you had to be fit to even try yoga. This DVD takes you step by step and is so easy to follow. You won't be disappointed at all.",1396742400,,207,3.8372093023255816
8079674,5,B000ASKJZI,"I recently received this DVD and LOVE it.  It's extremely relaxing, and I love how thorough the instruction is. They offer plenty of suggestions for modifications to the poses as well.  As other reviewers have mentioned, they give you PLENTY of time to relax in svasana, which is really nice.  Yes, the production quality could be better, but it's still good and the content is fantastic.  I really enjoy the visualization section as well. I notice a difference in my stress and attitude when I don't use this DVD, it's THAT relaxing.  I've also visited one of their centers in Chicagoland, and the calm, caring vibe you get from the DVD is what you get in real life.  I also have their Fully Fertile Companion DVD, and it's good, but I definitely like Yoga Practices for Fertility better.  The Fully Fertile DVD offers less modifications, and although it says no prior yoga experience is needed, I think I would have a very hard time following that practice if I didn't already have a basic knowledge of yoga.

As my husband and I travel down the uncertain road of infertility and medicated cycles, I have found this practice to be a safe haven, a source of peace that's been hard to come by lately. I would highly recommend this DVD to any woman (or man, no matter where they are in their fertility journey!",1372636800,,1309,4.587982832618025
8079675,5,B000ASKJZI,I bought this and another product to encourage new habits in my goal for optimum female health .... arrived quickly.,1359590400,,116,4.85
8079676,1,B000ASKJZI,"With all the pregnancy things going on right now, I wasn't able to take a look at this dvd, and it sat by my player for a couple of months without getting any use.  One month, 17 dpo, I got a BFP and found that I was pregnant!  I realized I was able to get pregnant without this dvd.

What really worked for me was changing my diet and eating foods that kept my core temperature warm.  Spend your money on organic foods (when possible), get enough sleep and take your prenatal vitamins!  Good luck to you!",1310515200,5,505,4.164948453608248
8079677,5,B000ASKJZI,"I just got this DVD in the mail yesterday, put it on today and I really like it.
Its calming, its easy on my body and it has several sections that are very useful.
I'm so glad I bought this and can't wait to get better at it so I can really get into it.",1263427200,,253,3.618181818181818
8079678,5,B000ASKJZI,"I got this along with Yoga 4 Fertility from Brenda Strong. I slightly prefer the format of this one. There is a class with 2 men and 4 women in a bright, sunlit room. One of the instructors demonstrates the poses while the other stands in front of the class to lead and give form pointers. In addition to the main 45 min practice, there are several additional sections in the main menu like pranayama breathing, restorative poses, meditation and visualization. I also like that they have extra music at the end during savasana so you can lie there as long as you like. The routine is gentle but does the job of making me feel limber and relaxed. Once in a while the instructor will point out how a pose is good for fertility or letting go of stress. They also mention at the beginning that it's safe for all stages of fertility treatment. Although my husband didn't get a chance to do this with me, I like that it's geared toward both sexes so he could have done it without feeling like he's doing a women's fertility practice. This workout is good for all levels. The poses are challenging enough to be interesting for me (I've been doing yoga a few times a week for over 6 months), but they explain and demonstrate modifications, sometimes using a strap or block, and the participants are also at varying levels.

Sadly, our journey was cut short but I could see myself using this DVD every day for several weeks or months.",1254268800,19,1425,4.459770114942529
8079679,4,B000ASKJZI,I have enjoyed using this DVD during my recent IVF cycles. It has helped me relax but I'm still not pregnant (not that that's the fault of the dvd). The techniques used are very easy to follow along with and do. I love the visualization technique section--super relaxing. Great dvd and highly recommend if you need help in the relaxing department.,1253577600,6,347,4.704918032786885
8079680,4,B000ASKJZI,"This video provides many useful tools including a 45 minute practice yoga workout, two meditation sections, and another relaxation poses section.  However, there are no instructions as to when to use each sections or how often eash section should be used. (If you did all the sections every day, it wold run about 2 hours or more each day!) The quality of the video is good, but not fantastic.  It is performed in their studio in Chicago, where you watch the instructors and various students perform the moves.  The music that was added is a little distracting (not the typical new age music) and both of the instructors have sharp voices, so it is not particularly relaxing to listen to them. This is not in the same league as a Gaiam video as far as production.",1241136000,15,763,4.595588235294118
8079681,5,B000ASKJZI,"I liked this yoga DVD because it is the closest you can get to a real yoga class. It not only has a very nice yoga practice, but also includes visualization, ways to make your mind calm, and to release your inner potential in the seek to get pregnant. Since fertility treatments are so demanding, one needs also to find something to remain calm while trying to get pregnant. I also liked that the producers were also former fertility patients. I enjoyed a lot this DVD and it is very complete.",1235952000,4,493,4.428571428571429
