do not waste your time and money on this complete rubbish. Amitabh was finished at this point as the main hero.
dont believe me then look at Jaadugar, Toofan, Ajooba,Ganga Jamunaa Saraswathi,
All these films rehashing the same ""angry man"" persona, (apart from Jaadugar, that was just dumb) which everyone was bored with at this time.
Stick to his classics from the 70s and early 80s.",1477353600,,464,4.602409638554217
