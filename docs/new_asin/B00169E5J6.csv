3154450,5,B00169E5J6,"Whether you're Democrat or Republican, pro or anti-Bush, this documentary will help you see the war in an objective light.

Since the 2001 attacks of September 11th, we were constantly feds news bites, clips and news articles for or against going to war with Iraq.  Since going to war we have been constantly told why or why not the war was succeeding or failing, both by the media and by politicians.  Simply put, the last 7 years have been a media whirlwind and information overload for Americans.

Whether or not you agree with the war, this documentary will give you a complete picture of how it is that our nation's leaders ultimately made their decision.  You'll have a clearer understanding of the actual basis for going to war, beyond the talking points we've heard repeated over and over again.

You'll also get an extremely detailed and honest view of the personalities within the Whitehouse Administration and how their arrogance and failure to get along and listen to each other ultimately led us down the wrong path.

My wife and I mistakenly started watching this on NetFlix and we were immediately mesmeorized by the its detail and deep political insight.  This program was entertaining, informative and enlightening beyond our wildest expectations.",1220572800,7,1264,4.985714285714286
3154451,5,B00169E5J6,A powerful and exposing story! This 4 hour documentary on the Irag War explains and illustrates how the Bush administration plotted & planned the strategy of convincing the public that Iraq was an imminent threat to the United States and how Colin Powell was purposefully kept out of the loop as the war unfolded.

3154453,5,B00169E5J6,"Bush's War, parts 1 and 2 deal with the Bush Administration's reaction to the events of 9/11/2001.  The documentary interviews so many of the important principles, it provides very valuable insights into what our nation did, what miscues we made and who the were likely the responsible parties.  I highly recommend this documentary, but I also recommend reading the extended interviews which you can do at PBS.org.

Admittedly, there were some principles who weren't interviewed, namely Donald Rumsfeld, George Tenet, Douglas Feith, and of course, George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and Scooter Libby.  However the list of people who did give interviews is impressive, with much cross-collaboration on important details regarding the Bush Administration's war on terror.

Certainly, coming out of this documentary, some individuals looked much better than others.  Those who come accross as protagonists include guys like Rich Armitage, Gen. Jack Keane, Col. H.R. McMaster, Fiasco author Thomas Ricks, and David Kay. Frontline often contributes to the demonization of the antagonists in this drama by playing evil or disturbing background music when individuals such as Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, or others are discussed.  But individuals such as J.Paul Bremer, Douglas Feith, Paul Wolfowitz, Scooter Libby, Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, Gen. Casey, and many others are portrayed as individuals who were key players who made serious mistakes.

The first part of the documentary deals with the government's response from the perspective of going after Al Qaeda, Afganistan, and the rule of law as the administration ""took the gloves off"" and used the ""war on terror"" as a justification for human rights violations.  It also deals with the leadup to the Iraq war and the ""fixing of the evidence around the policy"" and the CIA's caving into the Cheney/Wolfowitz goal of invading Iraq.

The second part deals with the execution of the Iraq War from a military perspective and from the later attempts to justify the war given the lack of ""weapons of mass destruction.""  Military strategy is discussed relative to the growing insurgency.  Gen. Jack Keane's interview was perhaps the most insightful as he indicates that they never anticipated an insurgency and never had a strategy to deal with it. Even after it was evident that the insurgency was going on, the state of denial in the Bush administration was stunning to say the least.

The ""light footprint"" strategy of Don Rumsfeld is discussed at length, as is the efforts of some in the Bush administration such as Condi Rice to rethink the strategy for Iraq and try to deal with the insurgency.

One aspect of the documentary that is stunning is the degree to which the Bush administration was so deeply divided and ineffective in employing consistent and thoughtful strategies to deal with the crisis our nation faced.  What the documentary says in so many words, but never ties together, is that it is the failure of leadership by George W. Bush that led to the fiasco.  Bush brought together alot of strong individuals into his administrion.  But by doing so, it meant that if he didn't provide strong leadership himself, internal dissension was inevitable. By not insisting that his team work together effectively, by not asking the hard but important questions that an effective chief executive officer must ask, Bush failed as a leader.  And though Bush will hand off this war to some other President, the documentary makes it clear, that this fiasco, was ""Bush's War.""",1216339200,16,3513,5.1441124780316345

3154457,5,B00169E5J6,"This is without a doubt the most completely indepth, accurate and articulate documentary ever made about the events that led up to the war in Iraq and what happens in Iraq after US forces invaded. This tells the entire story in extreme detail, step by step. Every plan and decision the american government made from the time of 911 and beyond is gone over in this documentary with a fine tooth comb. I had to watch this 5 hour 2 part frontline film over a period of 3 nights. Its very long and very detailed. But I learned a great deal. One thing I saw consistantly is that Bush was less to blame for how things turned out than I had first thought. It seems the majority of the Blame should have been put on the sholders of Rumsfeld and those who backed him. Part of the blame should have been laid on Bush as well for not taking better control and responsibility for how the war happened and how it continued in Iraq. He can surely be blamed for having no backbone or leadership ability. He seemed more on the side line and not at the center of things or in control. Bush clearly showed consistantly he was a weak and irresponsible president. But that doesnt mean the US shouldnt have invaded Iraq. I don't think it matters if there were weapons of mass destruction or not, the fact is Saddam Hussein was an evil and violent dictator that needed to be toppled anyway. Though the reason for the invasion was focused on the weapons that were never found it really was a good thing that Saddam was captured and brought to justice. If america had not invaded Iraq we would have never known for certain what was going to happen. And there is still the possibility that the weapons did indeed exist. Thats my opinion anyway. We cant make the evil in this world dissapear unless we are willing to do something to stop it. If you want to know the real story then here it is.",1367884800,,1867,4.35243553008596
3154458,5,B00169E5J6,"I'd heard much of this on the news but it was piecemeal. A little here. A little there. I didn't quite get the flow or how it all fit together. This documentary did it all for me.

This 4 hour treatment begins with the tragedy of 911 and moves through essentially everything that got us into Iraq, and then what happened after we got there. This is some scary stuff. First off, that a government, any government, would go as far as to falsely trump up evidence to go into a war that would cost the lives of so many, as well as cost untold amounts of money, blows my mind. That they would do so with little idea of what to do when they got there and go in without an exit strategy is unconscionable. Then there is the fact that you, the President, are surrounded by people who are nowhere near on the same page. All are vying for position. Doing end runs around each other. Lying to the press and on and on.

This is all laid out in an orderly timeline with a lot of those involved chiming in to both verify and amplify the outline. You hear from intelligence personnel, reporters, military personnel and others. This makes it difficult for anyone to say the producers were stacking the deck.

This is a tremendously important piece. For anyone needing or wanting a great overview to our involvement in the Mideast, I would be hard pressed to recommend a better source.",1341878400,,1368,4.377952755905512
3154459,5,B00169E5J6,"I was first shown this film in a college political science class. In my first year of teaching I decided to show this film to my senior government class. It's a great film to show how the power of the presidency has been expanded. PBS did a good job getting interviews from different sources, however I can't help but pick up on some bias within the film. It tends to ""villainize"" some and ""empathize"" with other. As for showing my student's I allowed them to make their own decisions on the matter. I like this film because it shows how much politicking goes on behind the scene that we the American people don't know, but perhaps should start caring about.",1297123200,,658,4.491666666666666
3154460,5,B00169E5J6,"Quite possibly the best documentary I have ever seen in my 20 year life.

3154461,5,B00169E5J6,"Just unbelievable how facts were twisted to fool people. Every vague idea was considered a hard evidence to make the case for war. In a world of Fox News and CNN we are lucky to have PBS to present facts in a fair manner.

3154462,5,B00169E5J6,"Is it a democracy when those with opposing views are called ""un-American"" and are reviled as being ""unpatriotic"" and worse ""traitors"" who are allowing terrorists to operate with impunity.

Is it a democracy when politicians can have reporters barred or even terminated for writing oppositional articles?

Is it a democracy when a president has to lie, manipulate, threaten and even falsify evidence to garner enough support for a war that now almost no one beleives to have been justified?

Is it a democracy when a president can condemn thousands of America's bravest to death (or worse to a life of debilitation and despair) just to satisfy his own maniacal wishes?

Is it a democracy when politicians govern with an attitude that ""all is fair in love, war and politics?""

This documentary with either shatter your confidence in our government, or will make you laugh in contempt... because the evidence unfolds in such a daunting and inarguable story that makes George Bush seem something just a little less loathsome as Joseph Stalin or Fidel Castro.

If you wish to have a thorough brief of the reality of the ""run up"" and execution of the war against Saddam Hussein, then you must watch this video. If you wish to praise your war-mongering president with a blind naivety then please do not watch. Because there is no claim to offering a ""balanced"" report that might leave viewers believing the Bush administration as being right and justified... and that the war in Iraq was a genuine part of the ""war on terror.""

Worse, this documentary will make one question the very argument of our living in a democracy... when our government rules at its behest and not of the best interests of its constituents.

This is a five star documentary about one of the most shameful and disgraceful events in American history.",1265760000,,1816,4.873376623376624
3154463,5,B00169E5J6,"I can't get enough of the depth and gravity of this presentation.  We have much to be learned from this report and I am impressed with the clarity and continuity of this PBS production.  There is a clear and convincing argument made regarding the personal interests and egos of both Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld being directly culpable in the unnecessary and excessive deaths of American service personnel.  We as a nation should be outraged at the fact that these two pariahs have walked away from such accountability unscathed and un-marshalled for their actions.  Former CIA Director George Tenant should be called to the carpet for his complicity in the ""WMD"" hoax as well.

This is an excellent piece of journalism and reporting of a complex issue involving a multitude of characters and issues.  Americans would be well served if this were shown as often as ""The Wizard of OZ"" or ""Dirty Dancing"" on other channels.  We simply cannot afford to let our government be mis-managed by characters such as those within the Bush 43 administration - and this presentation tells us why.",1265587200,,1082,4.879781420765028
3154464,5,B00169E5J6,"This is a fascinating study of the major decision-making that led to the Iraqi adventure and the conduct of five years of military operations. What really stuns any viewer with a sense or knowledge of history is the total lack of any foresight and the haughty arrogance displayed by the chief protagonists. Despite all of the attempted comparisons of the Iraq and Vietnam wars rolled out by the media (at least after the initial US ""victory"") the only real similarities between the two were there for all to see from the beginning - the US's ""right"" to militarily intervene despite the opinions of the rest of the world, a total lack of intelligence on the intentions or capabilities of the enemy, no knowledge of Iraqi history, culture, language, or aspirations.

Tied to this is the extremely dangerous state that the military high command has fallen into since the end of WWII. The Pentagon has seemingly fallen into the habit of becoming ""yes men"" to any hair-brained scheme that a presidential administration deems necessary. Add to this the habit of retaining and promoting high-ranking officers who obviously have no business in their positions of authority (eg. Westmoreland and Franks). What McNamara/Rumsfield wants, McNamara/Rumsfield gets - despite any previous historical precedent to the contrary. The Pentagon then ""gets with the program."" After all, ""its not much of a war, but its the only one we've got."" Sound familiar?

The most scathing image in the broadcast is fleeting. General Franks' (who followed Rumsfield's ""low footprint"" recipe for disaster and who had scorned the advice of lower-ranking officer's for an enlarged invasion/occupation force) helo carrying him out of Iraq at the moment of his ""triumph"", when the real war had only just begun. Sanchez, the two-year hiatus before the military realized (or admitted) that it was fighting a counter-insurgency war, Bremer's insane de-Baathification policies (didn't he ever watch ""Patton""?) - yeah, theres your Vietnam analogy. Hubris, denial, and stupidity. And, as in Vietnam, who would pay the ultimate price for all of it? Coalition soldiers and Iraqi civilians. Classic.",1248739200,,2153,5.23768115942029
3154465,4,B00169E5J6,"Excellent documentary. I supported Bush and his ""war"". I watched this thinking it would be some kind of stupid Michael Moore-type hatchet job, but it isn't. It is very intelligent and very accurate, mostly.

The only thing I would have liked to see is the following:

- Saddam's history of supporting terrorism (Abu Nidal, the Bin Ladin of the 1980s, was living in Baghdad, when the U.S. invaded. Why ?)

- The 1998 Iraqi Liberation Act, a Clinton-era law that declared it as the official U.S. policy to overthrow Saddam.

- How the 1991 Gulf War, from a legal point of view never ended. And thus, America was indeed justified under international law to recommence hostilities, because there was no peace treaty in 1991, and Saddam also had not complied with 17 UN resolutions.

- How Clinton had repeatedly bombed Iraq.

- How the Kurds view Bush as their savior and revere America.

- The fact that one main reason for invading Iraq was to force the Saudis off the ""fence"" and get them to commit to a war vs. Al Quida.

- How Libya gave up its WMD program right after the invasion (coincidence ?)

Until those things are in this, it remains an excellent documentary, but ultimately incomplete.",1238976000,4,1195,4.652380952380953
3154466,5,B00169E5J6,"I am Australian and have a keen interest in America so this was bought for me as a Christmas present. My interests however are more about US history and politics, not war, but it made for compelling viewing. My interest in the US intensified after 9/11 (I was 22 at the time) and I must admit to largely training my attention on all things other than the Iraq war beyond the political context even though I knew I was ignoring one of the most important events in the history of the US. This documentary was a real eye opener. I would say I am like most observers of the conflict (who have no direct connection to it) and see it for its difficulty and sheer horror and have been overwelmed by its complexity and frankly sheer length. Keeping a mental hold on the conflict is not easy without real absorption. This documentary puts everything in such chronological order and necessary context that one comes out of it with an infinitely more informed viewpoint and one I hope to be a starting point for further study on my part.

Viewing it was especially timely for me given the recent election and imminent inauguration of Barack Obama and I imagine was much more timely for US audiences pre-election. I started out with a negative pre-9/11 opinion of the Bush administration, which became supportive immediately post 9/11, and has solidified into a poor opinion, specifically in connection to the response of 9/11 post Afghanistan and the handling of the 9/11 Commission.

This documentary for me expanded upon my initial distrust of the administration as it opens an endless parade of further avenues for questioning and slams home my initial opinion even further. Don't get me wrong I still find America and its society fascinating and the people mainly fantastic, I just don't like the Bush administration. Economics aside, the next 2 years will be VERY interesting for America. Good luck Mr Obama.",1231545600,2,1902,4.778115501519757

3388954,5,B00169E5J6,"This is without a doubt the most completely indepth, accurate and articulate documentary ever made about the events that led up to the war in Iraq and what happens in Iraq after US forces invaded. This tells the entire story in extreme detail, step by step. Every plan and decision the american government made from the time of 911 and beyond is gone over in this documentary with a fine tooth comb. I had to watch this 5 hour 2 part frontline film over a period of 3 nights. Its very long and very detailed. But I learned a great deal. One thing I saw consistantly is that Bush was less to blame for how things turned out than I had first thought. It seems the majority of the Blame should have been put on the sholders of Rumsfeld and those who backed him. Part of the blame should have been laid on Bush as well for not taking better control and responsibility for how the war happened and how it continued in Iraq. He can surely be blamed for having no backbone or leadership ability. He seemed more on the side line and not at the center of things or in control. Bush clearly showed consistantly he was a weak and irresponsible president. But that doesnt mean the US shouldnt have invaded Iraq. I don't think it matters if there were weapons of mass destruction or not, the fact is Saddam Hussein was an evil and violent dictator that needed to be toppled anyway. Though the reason for the invasion was focused on the weapons that were never found it really was a good thing that Saddam was captured and brought to justice. If america had not invaded Iraq we would have never known for certain what was going to happen. And there is still the possibility that the weapons did indeed exist. Thats my opinion anyway. We cant make the evil in this world dissapear unless we are willing to do something to stop it. If you want to know the real story then here it is.",1367884800,,1867,4.35243553008596
3388955,5,B00169E5J6,"I'd heard much of this on the news but it was piecemeal. A little here. A little there. I didn't quite get the flow or how it all fit together. This documentary did it all for me.

This 4 hour treatment begins with the tragedy of 911 and moves through essentially everything that got us into Iraq, and then what happened after we got there. This is some scary stuff. First off, that a government, any government, would go as far as to falsely trump up evidence to go into a war that would cost the lives of so many, as well as cost untold amounts of money, blows my mind. That they would do so with little idea of what to do when they got there and go in without an exit strategy is unconscionable. Then there is the fact that you, the President, are surrounded by people who are nowhere near on the same page. All are vying for position. Doing end runs around each other. Lying to the press and on and on.

This is all laid out in an orderly timeline with a lot of those involved chiming in to both verify and amplify the outline. You hear from intelligence personnel, reporters, military personnel and others. This makes it difficult for anyone to say the producers were stacking the deck.

This is a tremendously important piece. For anyone needing or wanting a great overview to our involvement in the Mideast, I would be hard pressed to recommend a better source.",1341878400,,1368,4.377952755905512
3388956,5,B00169E5J6,"I was first shown this film in a college political science class. In my first year of teaching I decided to show this film to my senior government class. It's a great film to show how the power of the presidency has been expanded. PBS did a good job getting interviews from different sources, however I can't help but pick up on some bias within the film. It tends to ""villainize"" some and ""empathize"" with other. As for showing my student's I allowed them to make their own decisions on the matter. I like this film because it shows how much politicking goes on behind the scene that we the American people don't know, but perhaps should start caring about.",1297123200,,658,4.491666666666666

3388959,5,B00169E5J6,"Is it a democracy when those with opposing views are called ""un-American"" and are reviled as being ""unpatriotic"" and worse ""traitors"" who are allowing terrorists to operate with impunity.

Is it a democracy when politicians can have reporters barred or even terminated for writing oppositional articles?

Is it a democracy when a president has to lie, manipulate, threaten and even falsify evidence to garner enough support for a war that now almost no one beleives to have been justified?

Is it a democracy when a president can condemn thousands of America's bravest to death (or worse to a life of debilitation and despair) just to satisfy his own maniacal wishes?

Is it a democracy when politicians govern with an attitude that ""all is fair in love, war and politics?""

This documentary with either shatter your confidence in our government, or will make you laugh in contempt... because the evidence unfolds in such a daunting and inarguable story that makes George Bush seem something just a little less loathsome as Joseph Stalin or Fidel Castro.

If you wish to have a thorough brief of the reality of the ""run up"" and execution of the war against Saddam Hussein, then you must watch this video. If you wish to praise your war-mongering president with a blind naivety then please do not watch. Because there is no claim to offering a ""balanced"" report that might leave viewers believing the Bush administration as being right and justified... and that the war in Iraq was a genuine part of the ""war on terror.""

Worse, this documentary will make one question the very argument of our living in a democracy... when our government rules at its behest and not of the best interests of its constituents.

This is a five star documentary about one of the most shameful and disgraceful events in American history.",1265760000,,1816,4.873376623376624
3388960,5,B00169E5J6,"I can't get enough of the depth and gravity of this presentation.  We have much to be learned from this report and I am impressed with the clarity and continuity of this PBS production.  There is a clear and convincing argument made regarding the personal interests and egos of both Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld being directly culpable in the unnecessary and excessive deaths of American service personnel.  We as a nation should be outraged at the fact that these two pariahs have walked away from such accountability unscathed and un-marshalled for their actions.  Former CIA Director George Tenant should be called to the carpet for his complicity in the ""WMD"" hoax as well.

This is an excellent piece of journalism and reporting of a complex issue involving a multitude of characters and issues.  Americans would be well served if this were shown as often as ""The Wizard of OZ"" or ""Dirty Dancing"" on other channels.  We simply cannot afford to let our government be mis-managed by characters such as those within the Bush 43 administration - and this presentation tells us why.",1265587200,,1082,4.879781420765028
3388961,5,B00169E5J6,"This is a fascinating study of the major decision-making that led to the Iraqi adventure and the conduct of five years of military operations. What really stuns any viewer with a sense or knowledge of history is the total lack of any foresight and the haughty arrogance displayed by the chief protagonists. Despite all of the attempted comparisons of the Iraq and Vietnam wars rolled out by the media (at least after the initial US ""victory"") the only real similarities between the two were there for all to see from the beginning - the US's ""right"" to militarily intervene despite the opinions of the rest of the world, a total lack of intelligence on the intentions or capabilities of the enemy, no knowledge of Iraqi history, culture, language, or aspirations.

Tied to this is the extremely dangerous state that the military high command has fallen into since the end of WWII. The Pentagon has seemingly fallen into the habit of becoming ""yes men"" to any hair-brained scheme that a presidential administration deems necessary. Add to this the habit of retaining and promoting high-ranking officers who obviously have no business in their positions of authority (eg. Westmoreland and Franks). What McNamara/Rumsfield wants, McNamara/Rumsfield gets - despite any previous historical precedent to the contrary. The Pentagon then ""gets with the program."" After all, ""its not much of a war, but its the only one we've got."" Sound familiar?

The most scathing image in the broadcast is fleeting. General Franks' (who followed Rumsfield's ""low footprint"" recipe for disaster and who had scorned the advice of lower-ranking officer's for an enlarged invasion/occupation force) helo carrying him out of Iraq at the moment of his ""triumph"", when the real war had only just begun. Sanchez, the two-year hiatus before the military realized (or admitted) that it was fighting a counter-insurgency war, Bremer's insane de-Baathification policies (didn't he ever watch ""Patton""?) - yeah, theres your Vietnam analogy. Hubris, denial, and stupidity. And, as in Vietnam, who would pay the ultimate price for all of it? Coalition soldiers and Iraqi civilians. Classic.",1248739200,,2153,5.23768115942029
3388962,4,B00169E5J6,"Excellent documentary. I supported Bush and his ""war"". I watched this thinking it would be some kind of stupid Michael Moore-type hatchet job, but it isn't. It is very intelligent and very accurate, mostly.

The only thing I would have liked to see is the following:

- Saddam's history of supporting terrorism (Abu Nidal, the Bin Ladin of the 1980s, was living in Baghdad, when the U.S. invaded. Why ?)

- The 1998 Iraqi Liberation Act, a Clinton-era law that declared it as the official U.S. policy to overthrow Saddam.

- How the 1991 Gulf War, from a legal point of view never ended. And thus, America was indeed justified under international law to recommence hostilities, because there was no peace treaty in 1991, and Saddam also had not complied with 17 UN resolutions.

- How Clinton had repeatedly bombed Iraq.

- How the Kurds view Bush as their savior and revere America.

- The fact that one main reason for invading Iraq was to force the Saudis off the ""fence"" and get them to commit to a war vs. Al Quida.

- How Libya gave up its WMD program right after the invasion (coincidence ?)

Until those things are in this, it remains an excellent documentary, but ultimately incomplete.",1238976000,4,1195,4.652380952380953
3388963,5,B00169E5J6,"I am Australian and have a keen interest in America so this was bought for me as a Christmas present. My interests however are more about US history and politics, not war, but it made for compelling viewing. My interest in the US intensified after 9/11 (I was 22 at the time) and I must admit to largely training my attention on all things other than the Iraq war beyond the political context even though I knew I was ignoring one of the most important events in the history of the US. This documentary was a real eye opener. I would say I am like most observers of the conflict (who have no direct connection to it) and see it for its difficulty and sheer horror and have been overwelmed by its complexity and frankly sheer length. Keeping a mental hold on the conflict is not easy without real absorption. This documentary puts everything in such chronological order and necessary context that one comes out of it with an infinitely more informed viewpoint and one I hope to be a starting point for further study on my part.

Viewing it was especially timely for me given the recent election and imminent inauguration of Barack Obama and I imagine was much more timely for US audiences pre-election. I started out with a negative pre-9/11 opinion of the Bush administration, which became supportive immediately post 9/11, and has solidified into a poor opinion, specifically in connection to the response of 9/11 post Afghanistan and the handling of the 9/11 Commission.

This documentary for me expanded upon my initial distrust of the administration as it opens an endless parade of further avenues for questioning and slams home my initial opinion even further. Don't get me wrong I still find America and its society fascinating and the people mainly fantastic, I just don't like the Bush administration. Economics aside, the next 2 years will be VERY interesting for America. Good luck Mr Obama.",1231545600,2,1902,4.778115501519757

Overall, Frontline is the best documentary series out there. Period. And this episode is the big tow on a glorious foot - to steal Bill Murray's poignant metaphor from ""Stripes"".  I've often fantasized about working for ""Frontline"" even as a coffee runner. Just to be a part of the service they provide to all Americans and by proxy, to the rest of the world. It would reward me more than winning the ""Powerball"".  And this specific episode summarizes the complex Iraq/Bush/Rice/Rumsfeld/Cheney/etc.not only expertly but also beautifully. And to underscore all of this, I bought this disc for my then dying father which subsequently sparked hours of meaningful conversations about the war itself, the Administration, the motives of the players involved and of people in general,  This gem of a documentary not only enhanced my perception of humanity and the countries involved (and those not involved) but of my own relationship with my now deceased father.  I could/can still see the pride in his eyes when I would bring up certain points of ""Bush's War"" during our weekly dinners at his favorite steakhouse in contrast against my brother's verbal struggle of which motorcycle he was looking to purchase next.  If through some infinitesimally small chance of a certain aligning of the planets caused someone from the Frontline team to ever read this review, while my offer to be a coffee runner was/is sincere, I would or could not ever ""run"" for a decaffeinated  request on principle alone.

One take away is that the documentary turns something that is not black and white in the author's book, and makes into a black and white issue.  Where issues are very grey, Frontline uses reporters to tilt the issue to left instead of using the words of those who were directly responsible or involved closely with the project.
