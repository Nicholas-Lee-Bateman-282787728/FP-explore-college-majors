3417010,3,B0018CWW4G,"Insanitarium has one of the more inane plots you'll ever see in a horror film, which in and of itself is quite an achievement.  Jack (Jesse Metcalfe) is trying to see his sister who has been committed to a mental institution.  When the hospital refuses to let him see her, Jack decides to get himself committed as well.  He cuts his chest with razors and walks onto the streets raving like a lunatic.  As if on cue, here come the police and the ambulance that just HAPPEN to take him to the same hospital where his sister is.  How's that for luck!

Once inside he meets the head of the hospital, the creepy Dr. Genetti played by Peter Stormare.  Has Stormare ever played a part where he wasn't creepy?  Jack soon learns that Genetti is conducting experiments on the patients and injecting them with an experimental drug.  Jack is determined to find Lily and get her out but when he reveals his ruse to Genetti and his staff, they think he is even more nuts and are not about to let him go.

Jesse soon leans the horrible truth about the experiments.  The drug is turning the patients into blood-thirsty maniacs (well, even more maniacal than normal) and he will have to try and find his sister and escape with an entire hospital full of flesh-eating psychos on their tail.

Insanitarium is a rather dumb movie for the first hour or so.  This is a rather large hospital and yet you only see one orderly and one nurse, who seem to work 24 hours a day.  The orderly has one of the patients sneak out of his room at night to steal pills for him.  Umm...wouldn't he have easier access to them, what with having a key card and all?  To top that off, he has regular sexual trysts with one of the patients and Jack is able to just sneak around the hospital by walking under the cameras in the corridors.  Great security!  But the last 25 minutes saves the film from being horrible as it essentially turns into ""28 Days Later"" inside an asylum.  The inmates go on a killing spree, killing and eating anyone they can find including each other.  Insanitarium features a ton of gore and some gruesome kills including machetes through the back of a head that come out of the mouth, arms torn off, stun sticks shoved down throats, etc...

The climax finds four survivors on the run from the lunatics and it's the most exciting part of the movie.  Olivia Munn of G4's ""Attack of the Show"" has a co-starring role as a nurse's aide and she does quite well.  Armin Shimerman (Star Trek DS9) has a small role as one of the maximum security crazies.  The performances in general were all good although Stormare tends to overact and chew scenery in every film he's in and it's no different here.  Stupid script but it has some exciting and terrifying elements.",1219363200,7,2739,4.451807228915663
3417011,4,B0018CWW4G,This movie is SOO gory! And a little disturbing. (I.E. Cat scene). The acting was good. It moved a little slow in the begining then sped up and let gallons of blood fly. Entertaining movie. Worth a rent or cheap buy.,1218844800,3,216,4.2926829268292686
3417012,5,B0018CWW4G,"This movie is well made and has all the great trappings of a cult classic!  The characters are well drawn and the action never lets up from the onset.  Jesse Matcalfe is super hot and Peter Stormare is totally insane.  A great combination like peanut butter and jelly or Tango and Cash.

I think this new director guy will be one of the most influential directors of our generation.  He's a visionary.  Keep your eye on him.  My son Rocco really loves his work.

3417017,5,B0018CWW4G,"The film follows a man, Jack (Jesse Metcalfe), faking insanity in order to save his sister, Lily (Kiele Sanchez), who has been involuntarily institutionalized. The siblings soon find that the strange doctor at the asylum, Mr. Gianetti (Peter Stormare), has been testing an experimental compound, orphium, on the patients that seems to be turning them into flesh-eating zombies; Loomis (Kurt Caceres), another patient, spreads the infection. The two siblings band together with a terminally paranoid man, Dave (Kevin Sussman), and a helpful nurse, Nancy (Olivia Munn), in the hopes of finding a way out of the asylum. They are attacked by most of the prisoners and staff, who kill Nancy; while on the 4th floor, they encounter the doctor, who gives Dave an icepick lobotomy, incapacitating him; he attempts to get Jack too, but ends up being infected by Loomis. At the end of the film, as the two siblings are in a police car heading to the asylum to investigate, the officers (Mark Kelly & Sharon Schaffer) accidentally let the patients escape into the outside world. It ends with a panning shot, revealing the city below the asylum's hillside location. The secondary plot focuses on the affair between Charles (Evan Parke) and Heather (Lisa Athrowe).",1355356800,,1251,5.077669902912621
3417018,5,B0018CWW4G,"I loved this movie. It does not disappoint, all the blood, gore, insane doctors, and mental patients who stay loyal even through being eaten. A must for any horror fan!",1313107200,,168,4.633333333333334
3417019,4,B0018CWW4G,"Insanitarium (2008) is a very gory medical horror thriller that probably deserves more attention from horror fans.  What starts out as an unlikely rescue mission, unexpectedly becomes an insane raging bloodbath of epic proportions.  Written and directed by Jeff Buhler (The Midnight Meat Train), the film has a dull muddled pedestrian start, but slowly builds up tension and adds dark elements, until all hell breaks loose in a murderous, blood spattering, flesh-eating frenzy.

After his sister Lily Romero (Kiele Sanchez) is committed to an institution and denied contact with anyone, her bother Jack (Jesse Metcalfe) pretends to be insane to get himself committed, so he can try and help her.  Fortunately for Jack, he ends up in the same facility as his sister, the Middleton Psychiatric Institute.  Jack makes friends with a patient named Dave (Kevin Sussman, The Big Bang Theory), and begins to investigate.

Prowling around at night Jack discovers that Dr. Gianetti (Peter Stormare), the head of the institute, is administering an experimental drug called Orpheum, to certain patients, causing them to get violent and crave blood.  Jack soon finds himself a target for elimination, and that Lily is scheduled for Gianetti's special treatment.  With Dave's help, Jack attempts to free his sister, but the trio finds themselves in a crisis situation, when the infected patients get loose, and begin killing and consuming human flesh.  Like zombies, the infected are cannibalistic, but have better cognitive abilities, and hyped up motor skills.

Once the chaos starts, most everyone quickly becomes prepared to kill to survive.  Dave, Jack, and Lily, try to find a way out of the locked down facility, but encounter new horrors wherever they go.  Gianetti is completely twisted and ruthless, and willing to sacrifice anyone.  You can almost feel the needle penetrating your own skull, when Gianetti administers a crude lobotomy.  Jack and Lily manage to escape, but their freedom appears to be only temporary, as the product of Gianetti's madness are unleashed on the world.

Insanitarium gets off to a sluggish start, but shifts into overdrive, once the inmates get loose in the asylum.  The violence and bloodshed are excessive, with many creative touches, and several memorable gore shots.  The acting is generally pretty awful, but this seems to matter much less once the craziness breaks out, and things become more of a scramble to survive.  Jesse Metcalfe, Kiele Sanchez, and Kevin Sussman, get a good workout, battling their way through the hospital wards.  Peter Stormare turns in a very creepy and ghoulish performance.

The supporting cast steps it up in the third act.  Carla Gallo is subject to all kinds of cruel abuse, as Gianetti's assistant Vera.  Olivia Munn is likeable, playing a helpful nurse, who forcefully resigns from her job.  As a patient who seems fascinated by Jack, Lisa Arturo runs around naked with blood soaked breasts, for much of the later part of the movie.  And Armin Shimerman is really vile and nasty, as a patient who has it in for Jack.  Put them all together, and you have a madhouse that makes Insanitarium a film that should be of some interest to gorehounds.  The lobotomy scene is one that may stay with you for a while.",1310083200,,3271,5.067289719626168
3417020,5,B0018CWW4G,"Insanitarium is a complex tale of a brother's love for his sister and his devotion to protecting her from whatever harm may befall her in this world.  In a world that has strayed from the path of family values, Insanitarium reminds us what is really important in life.  Jesse Metcalfe gives a performance ""beyond his years"" and portrays his character with ""utmost realism.""  This star-studded cast ""cleverly reveals plot twist after plot twist.""  Around each corner a new challenge is revealed and our main character, our hero, must confront these twists, growing and becoming ""more complex"" with each.

This film is an ""instant classic"" and a ""must watch"" for any film buff.  Insanitarium was brilliantly shot in hand held digital giving the film a realism that only ""Stage 6 Films"" can achieve.  The soundtrack is minimal yet ""utterly captivating.""  If you haven't taken the 80 minutes to watch this film, you are missing out.",1290902400,,928,4.98051948051948
3417021,5,B0018CWW4G,"I admit it. I came into watching INSANITARIUM, expecting precious little. But I have to say, INSANITARIUM is awesome!! It delivers on so many different levels as a horror film. A young man, Jack, is looking for his sister who has been in a mental hospital ever since trying to commit suicide and Jack hasn't been able to have any communication with her. Mental illness runs in their family, so it isn't a far stretch to believe that Jack might be a little unbalanced. Desperate to find his sister, Jack decides to ""get crazy"" and is committed to the hospital where his sister is, so he can take her home.

But things just aren't what they seem at the mental hospital. The good doctor is using the patients as guinnea pigs to test a new drug, Orphesium, that he's designed and the results are terrifying! If this is a cure, you're better off sick. And that's just the beginning...

INSANITARIUM is great. It has everything that a great horror film needs. The mental hospital makes for a chilling setting, The patients are so freaky, in more ways than one. It has a good plotline that doesn't have too many holes, just enough for a low budget film. And blood, guts, terror and nerve-tingling suspense. Even a psycho killer in lockup! I rarely give 5 stars to a dvd, but INSANITARIUM has it all!!

Check into INSANITARIUM and enjoy!",1285891200,,1329,4.57563025210084
3417022,4,B0018CWW4G,"Before I saw this film, I had no idea what this film would be like but this film has turned out to be a fun fast and gory film, not a bad way to spend an 1hr and 25mins of your time.

The film is about a man, who cons his way into a mental hospital, to break his sister out of there, but something bad is going on inside the place, a mad doctor is using his patients as lab rats and turning them into bloodthirsty killers.

This film is fast and has some nasty bits in this film, anybody who loves cats, won't like what happens to one in this film,I mean just when you thought the mental patients have been though enough, you get some dumb f**ked in the head doctor turning them into even more crazy nutjobs.

So if you want to burn the next 1hr and 25mins of your time, then look no further.",1229558400,,792,3.9685534591194966

8269569,4,B0018CWW4G,"Once again I find myself pleasantly surprised. Jesse Metcalfe in a movie that I was really into except for a few things that were kind of silly. The prime silliness being who would have themselves committed to a sanitarium to visit your sister? Looking past that we have Jesse doing just that because he can't get any info on her and he thinks that there are some serious shenanigans going on and boy is he right. It is an interesting story about a mad scientist experimenting on the charges in his care and creates something out of this world, not alien just different. I will say that this was a pretty good movie for what it was, I was no citizen kane but it did keep my attention and entertain me.",1499385600,,701,4.358778625954199

8269572,4,B0018CWW4G,"This is a good movie i decided to pick up on a whim when i saw it was a sanitarium movie,i like horror movies or psychological thrillers or sanitarium/psyche ward movies. The movie starts with a guy trying to get his sister out of a hospital after she tried to commit suicide. He gets himself locked up by cutting himslf open & running around exposed in the park til' he is picked up and sent to this particular hospital. Once inside he soon realizes strange behavior among almost every inmate,he finds his sister & he tries too free her from the hospital before the Dr. has his way with her. The dr has his own view of how to treat patients with this all new drug he has created,his plan is to electro-shock everyone in the hospital frying their brains. Then he feeds them this medicine he created causing the patients too get white eyes and a ferocious attitude. They are driven by a lust for blood like an addict for a spoon & it drives them to tear each other apart,all this madness ensues after the dr has an electrical shortage causing the patients too get loose. So the brother fights to survive to get to his sister & get them both out alive before the crazy doctor gets to them and/or the crazy mental patients all hopped up on this medecine that pretty much turns them into zomboes,not mindless & slow but they can talk like a human & still are ferocious. This was a pleasant surprise to me as to what the story may be,and the story was a suprise to me. The film really is different style on a hospital horror film but i liked it. I would recommend you check it out if you want a crazy psyche ward film & then enjoy the bloodshed and craziness that is Insanitarium.",1436400000,,1675,4.32063492063492

8269576,4,B0018CWW4G,"Great horror flick! This is what suspension of disbelief is for! A rocking, gory, loud, sexy, terrifying ride! A well acted horror-thriller and ultimately that's what makes the movie. Formulaic characters (mad scientist, hot assistant, hotter crazy chick, sociopathic bad guy, brilliant inmate who can't cope in society, etc), a well worn setting (the inmates are the sane ones! science has run amuck! No one notices!) and some pretty tough to swallow plot devices/coincidences (I'll just 'pretend' to be crazy and get admitted to the crazy house where I'll have free rein and no one will notice I'm really lucid if I keep folding my arms and ducking my head) - but the whole is better than the sum of the parts and somehow this one works well, really well. I enjoyed every minute the insanity at the insanitarium!",1422921600,,814,4.863309352517986
8269577,3,B0018CWW4G,"The first half of this movie was done really well and thought it was original. I was a little disappointed in the second half though as it turned into a gore-fest horror movie. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good gore-fest every now and then, I just wasn't expecting it here. I thought if they would have kept up with more of the tension of the first half of the movie, it would have been better. The ending was totally disappointing to me.",1422576000,,439,4.238095238095238
