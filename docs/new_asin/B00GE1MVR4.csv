8622416,1,B00GE1MVR4,"Cheap and cheesy. Despite a long history of wonderful Indian film and Indian actors, Peter Brook's version of The Mahabharata not only plods but relies overwhelmingly on African, Mongolian, and Eastern European actors who are then dubbed in Hindi. Boring, hard to follow. No sweep, no drama, no musical score. Looks like a film version of someone's high school play. We sent it back.",1451088000,3,383,5.0
8622417,1,B00GE1MVR4,This is trash; it is an insult to this lofty epic.  It would take at least a day for me to properly respond to this nonsensical and failed attempt to depict this amazing epic.  Don't waste your time.,1446422400,3,199,4.2105263157894735
8622418,3,B00GE1MVR4,"I was hoping that it could be dubbed in English because I spent most of the time reading the subtitles which move so fast accross the screen that I hardly have time to catch up, let alone see the images.  But, I love the story.",1444521600,2,227,4.044444444444444
8622419,5,B00GE1MVR4,Always has been a favorite.  I got this because I already love it.  Brook's interpretation is brilliant.,1436572800,2,104,5.0588235294117645
8622420,5,B00GE1MVR4,"This is the creation of the poem to engrave drama in the hearts of man, which culminates in the 18-day war between the noble Pandava princes and their scheming cousins, the Kaurava kings that decides the fate of mankind.

We see how free will and fait can co-exist. Notice that Krishna has an agenda that may or may not be that of the other players in the game. Even in the 18-day war every rule is broken every value is destroyed, leaving no difference between whom is good or who is evil, who is an enemy or who is not. As Krishna does throughout the movie, we see that the only way the Pandava can win is to use any means.

Peter Brook encapsulated the essence of the Mahabharata in a 9-hour play. Then the play was adapted to this six-hour visual media presentation. Visually and melodically stunning this presentation is so well presented that you hardly realize the effort that went into making this representation reflect the true Mahabharata.

Mahabharata literally means Great (Maha) India (Bharat), yet its meaning is the story of mankind, as one would see that mankind started in India.

There are other film and book versions of the story some better some not as good however this is a brilliant work and should not be missed.

In book form, I suggest as a good starting place ""Mahabharata"" -The Acclaimed new rendering of an immortal epic of war and destiny. Retold by William Buck.

Also, do not over look ""The Power of Myth"" -- by Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers.

  This one is absolute dynamite......
  Brook brings to life carefully chosen shards of the great epic of the Hindus.....
  It was breath-taking to view it years ago.
  And it still holds it own.
  BRAVO to director Peter Brook's work; and to all his actors.
  Thank you Peter.....",1413417600,3,345,4.475409836065574
