I wish, like millions of customers, they would stop playing region code games with movies.  It's ridiculous.  Trying to milk every nickel out of it and forgetting that end users . . . Your customers pay for the entertainment and are last when it comes to consideration.

In order to see this movie, I rented it from Amazon Instant Video, played it on my iPad, and then used Air Play and sent it to my big screen TV through Apple TV.  Good Grief!  I like this genre if it's unique and well done and I sensed that this one was.

It was creepy from beginning to end.  The boys father had died some time ago and so it was just him and his mom trying to make it together alone.  One night the little boy picks out a book for his mommy to read a bedtime story from.  The book is very short and simple about a Mr. Babadook who comes to visit and then you can't get rid of him.  While reading the story mom quickly sees that the story is sinister and not appropriate and tries to read another book.  Her son is fascinated yet afraid of Mr. Babadook and becomes determined that he is real and that it is his responsibility to protect his mother and kill him once he comes to attack them.  The mom, of course doesn't believe in Mr. Babadook to start, and by the time she realizes that he is not just a fantasy, things get really dark inside their home.

The rest you'll just have to see, now won't you KIDDIES!!!  A good old scary tale to make the hairs stand out on the back of your neck.  My favorite kind.  I want a copy once a region free is created so that I can share the scare with MY mom.  Ha, Ha, Ha

6889065,5,B00QVT3J1G,"Something is very unnerving about this movie. I watched it 3 times about a month ago. Still can't get it out of my head. Every time I see the ad on TV  I get a shiver down my back. This is not a slasher, gory movie; it just makes you wonder what the hell is going on the entire time. GREAT.",1418428800,7,290,3.7540983606557377
8693126,5,B00QVT3J1G,My 23 year old loves horror movies. I don't think there is one she hasn't watched that she didn't like. Some she likes better then others though. As for Babadook she loved it with a higher score then 5 if she could.,1436659200,,215,4.142857142857143

8693130,4,B00QVT3J1G,"This is a highly-original & engrossing low-budget Australian horror movie, written (& expertly directed) by Jennifer Kent, & based on the 2005 short film 'Monster'.

It tells the story of Amelia & her dysfunctional & deeply-disturbed 6-year-old son Samuel; born 6 years' ago, when the car driving Amelia to hospital by her husband crashes & kills him by decapitation - but mother Amelia survives to give birth that same day.
Now, 6 years on, Amelia still hasn't gotten over her husband's shocking death. She lives her life as best she can as a care-worn mum, working as a carer at a nursing home by day, but struggling to cope with her son's disturbing behaviour - hardly ever getting a good night's sleep.

One day, a mysterious book appears in her son's bedroom - The Babbadook. It's a creepy, pop-up book which tells a simple (but rather violent) story with characters that appear to represent Amelia & her son. She tries to destroy the book, but seems to have unlocked a malevolent force which enters the house & begins to terrorize her...

The most remarkable thing about this film for me was the wonderful central performance of Essie Davis as the mom - we really feel her pain & helplessness, & her facial expressions tell a thousand words. She desperately loves her son, but he forever turns the screw on her & drags her down, alienating her from her family & friends & driving her to the brink of despair. Noah Wiseman - as a 6-year-old child playing Samuel - should get a mention here too, in another excellent piece of casting.

The movie is unusually written, directed & produced completely by women too, & great use is made of the small budget. A wonderful brooding atmosphere is set by the creepy house too - an interior set especially constructed for the film.
It's a movie that really holds your attention, has plenty of jumpy moments & has you yearning for the hapless Amelia to win the day & defeat whatever it is that's tormenting her. It really plays on childhood fears of 'monsters under the bed' & imaginary friends (who may not ultimately be very friendly!).

There's an excellent bonus documentary on this DVD too that has interviews with the cast & crew, & which is well worth looking at.",1428796800,,2213,4.664102564102564

8693132,4,B00QVT3J1G,"The film centers on Amelia (Essie Davis) and her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman). Dad was killed in an accident the same day Samuel was born. Amelia works at a retirement community. Samuel has an overactive imagination about the Babadook, an entity that is in the home and after him. His obsession leads him manufacturing ""Home Alone"" weapons and makes him unruly and creepy. Mom has difficulty coping. In the second half of the film, mom is drawn in as expected, and the only question remains is the reality of the situation.

The film was a well done monster in closet type of genre. This is the type of film my mom would have me watch as a kid, then she would walk around looking crazy carrying a knife. Not that I turned out okay or anything.

8693133,1,B00QVT3J1G,It's a scam. The discs don't work. Terrible buy. Absolutely do not purchase.,1423612800,,76,4.923076923076923
8693134,5,B00QVT3J1G,"The Babadook is the perfect example of a cheap thrill(er) working perfectly.

With just  two leads, Essie Davis as Amelia the mother and Noah Wiseman as Samuel the son and fewer than a dozen supporting actors none of whom speak more than a hundred words, you can't trim a cast much more spare.

It uses just a couple inexpensive visual effects and sounds that are  sort'a free; so ""cheap"" still applies.

Its premise suggests an homage to a movie from 1961 that was based on original story that's nearly 120 years old, Henry James' The Turn of the Screw.

James crafted a story that may or may not have had a ghost about children who may or may not have been evil in which a housekeeper may or may not have lied to a governess who may or may not have been crazy but who may or may not have frightened the children to death.

The simply terrifying Babadook is a manifestation from an eponymous pop-up book from hell.  While this shadowy threat becomes more tangible and menacing as the film progresses, the one thing for uncertain is its source.

Did Amelia write the book? Is she or is Noah the psychic source point for the larger evil?

Mother and son trade off being Dr Jekyll or Mr. Hyde.  Amelia is loving or vengeful; Samuel is protective or off his rocker.

At first we see just a home sleep deprived by nightmares experienced by both Amelia and her son.  Amelia seems the worse for this since she is forever being awakened by her son who she then has to comfort for hours nightly --while she can't even get through an erotic dream without an interruption.

The family is certainly an unhappy one.  Samuel is and repeats the story of his birth and his father's death--the dad died  trying to get Amelia to a hospital to deliver the boy.

Needless to say the boy's birthday has not been celebrated in his seven years.

Another child's birthday party proves as ill fated.  All the mothers who brought children to the party are wearing black. Amelia has her first instance of her increasingly unbridled rage, and Samuel pushes the birthday girl from a tree house, busting her nose.

Some people try to help.  The school wants to give the boy his own teacher.  Amelia's sister sits the boy until he terrifies her daughter.  The police would help but Amelia has destroyed the proof of a possible stalker.  Community services begins an investigation.

All of the above happens in an atmosphere of hallucination and terror that rise without cease.

The ending or endings are uncertain as will be  the condition of any seat you used while watching this movie.

The Babadook will not make you just jump out of your seat-- it will keep you levitated from
 that seat for 93 minutes.",1421712000,,2677,4.541841004184101
