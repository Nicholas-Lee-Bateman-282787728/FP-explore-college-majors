4525798,4,B0051QS1RM,This is a fascinating series of how forensic investigations and the dogged persistence of investigators solve murders where the perpetrator is finally convicted on the the evidence which has been painstakingly assembled. The narration is good and the episodes move quickly and keep one's attention throughout the episode. Well worth it!,1417219200,,336,5.607843137254902

4525803,4,B0051QS1RM,"Forensic Files is an American documentary-style series which reveals how forensic science is used to solve violent crimes, mysterious accidents, and even outbreaks of illness. The show takes a ""whodunit"" approach, making each case a mystery to be solved. Every 22 minutes episode follows one case from initial investigation until conviction, acquittal, or some other legal resolution. Pathologists, medical examiners, police officers, detectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys, friends and families of victims or sometimes even the suspects themselves are all interviewed about their roles.

This set is about Crimes of passion: love triangles, jealousy, affairs, lies, etc. All 12 investigations are very interesting. Here are the 12 episodes you'll find on this set:

1. As the Tide Turns: The 2007 murder of FL resident, April Barber is investigated. She was shot and killed on a beach. At first, investigators thought it was a robbery gone bad. But the forensics evidence showed it was a calculated and cold-blooded plan.
2. Crash Course: A highway patrolman is dispatched to a seemingly routine traffic accident, but his suspicions are aroused when he sees the amount of blood in the car.
3. Dinner and a Movie: Time of death becomes pivotal when a pregnant woman is found murdered in her Connecticut home. The couple's adventurous sex life comes into play, and a striking similarity between the woman's death and an HBO movie gives forensic examiners the clues they need to thaw out the alibi of a cold-blooded killer.
4. Dirty Laundry: The victim was a self-made man who never minced words. Perhaps he was murdered by a disgruntled employee. Perhaps the racy photos in his safe held the clue to solving the crime. Or perhaps investigators could follow the money and find the killer.
5. Ghost in the Machine: In 1999 a minister's wife was found dead in an overflowing bathtub in her home in South Dakota. Her cryptic suicide note left questions about her state of mind and her sense of time. Forensic science provided those answers.
6. Hell's Kitchen: It appeared the victim had accidentally fallen and hit her head at the bottom of the stairs. But the odd position of her shoes and the absence of blood spatter led police to suspect the scene had been staged... and Luminol proved they were right.
7. Internal Affair: Friend's of a missing woman receive a shock when her body is discovered, propelling investigators to use blood evidence to find the killer.
8. Naughty or Nyce: A pharmaceutical tycoon's mail-order bride is found in her SUV in a half-frozen creek. Could a few flecks of sawdust and a shoe print determine whether a death is an accident or a homicide?
9. Sunday School Ambush: A wife's wound from an attack on her husband which left him dead looks like it might be self inflicted. After tireless efforts to solve this murder the only thing police have is the wound of the wife.
10. A Voice from Beyond: Can police find a murderer 30 years after the murder was committed? Watch Forensic Files to get the answer.
11. Web of Seduction: Bruce Miller was shot to death in the office of the junkyard business he owned. The crime scene was almost pristine. When a computer forensics expert examined the computers owned by the victim's wife and by her lover, he found all the evidence needed to convict the person most responsible for the crime.
12. A Welcome Intrusion: In 1995 St. Louis, Missouri a young woman complained about a shuttle van driver who took her home from the airport. A few days later, there was a violent confrontation that left both the woman and the van driver dead. Police first thought the incident was revenge; but the blood pattern, an old hammer and a hastily scrawled note told forensic scientists something entirely different.",1352160000,5,3771,4.918367346938775
4525804,5,B0051QS1RM,"I have watched Forensic Files since 2003.  Many of the episodes from this disc are earlier episodes (which are not currently airing).  Most of these I had seen several years ago, but it is still good to see them again.  I rip them to my hard drive and then stream them to my iPad via my network.  Apple charges $1.99 for similar content.  At under $10 for 12 episodes, these discs are really a bargain.  I think the thing that I most enjoy about having these epsisode on DVD is not having to watch or fast-forward through the commercials (particularly Tru-TV ads promoting their own stupid programming that is less than stellar (apart from this show).",1340841600,3,651,4.568965517241379
4525805,5,B0051QS1RM,If you like Forensic Files than this is a great DVD to purchase.  I really liked the way the files are selected.. I'm a big fan and can watch them over and over.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051QS1RM/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title,1330214400,,229,5.9393939393939394

Hell's Kitchen
Internal Affair
Naughty or Nyce

I would have given this five stars as a huge fan of the show, but it has to get four because it is exactly what it sounds like - just the 12 episodes listed, no extras or advertisements.  I would have liked some extras :)

Regardless, this is the dvd that includes episodes related to crimes of passion, which is pretty straightforward.  Affairs, jealousy, etc. If you're already a fan of the show, then you know what to expect.  If you are new to the show, it is basically an anatomy of a crime.  Forensic Files takes you from the crime itself, to the people involved, to the reality of what was going on behind the scenes, and of course the forensic evidence that helped to convict the criminals.  There are a lot of interviews with the people and professionals involved in the case, and include the conclusion of what occurred at trial (sentencing).  Overall a good show!",1314144000,22,1126,4.59

8453116,5,B0051QS1RM,These are shows that are for the serious fans of criminal investigation. The stories are true and the evidence is very scientific. These are not polished productions like Dateline but they are of high quality but they hold your attention. My only problem with these cases is they are only 20 minutes long.,1461715200,,305,4.773584905660377

8453122,5,B0051QS1RM,"I know what you're doing. You're wondering if you should get this, right? So was I.

I'm mostly a Science Fiction fan; Star Gate, Star Trek et. al. I viewed this and I thought to myself: Damn it man, I'm a Science Fiction fan, not a Detective!.

I ate my words. This is just as entertaining as any of my favorites. You see, like Science Fiction this also revolves around ""Mystery"" and you will become the detective you were always meant to be. Trust me, try it.",1434585600,,461,4.287356321839081
