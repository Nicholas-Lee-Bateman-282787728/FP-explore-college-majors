8531905,5,B008XAYXBQ,"After practicing the 1st 64, starting the 2nd 64 Action Form takes your training to a whole new level!  Focusing on post-natal qi, this form contains a much more dynamic series of motion than performed before.  If you have see the form before, it can certainly look challenging, but Shane Lear does a great job of dividing the form into digestible pieces.  Along with the 1st 64 Action DVD as well as the Wild Goose 1 Book, Shane Lear and Dave Deich make the foundation of the Dayan System easy and fun to learn.",1351900800,,512,4.425531914893617
