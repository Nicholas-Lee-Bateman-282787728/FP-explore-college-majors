8520901,4,B007PZAE18,"I was looking through the five dollar bin at my local Walmart and found The Midnight Horror Collection: Creepy Kids and Clowns 6 movies collection. I only bought the movie because it had Darkness with Anna Paquin! If you are wondering if it is the rated R version, you'll be disappointed as it is the PG-13 version. Even thought it is heavily edited. I still like the movie. Full Moon's campy KillJoy is also on here as well as Children of the Corn II. The other movies are below average, but it is worth the price to get the other three.

The movies are:

Disc 1:

8213: Gacy House

Darkness

Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice

Disc 2:

Jake's Closet

KillJoy

Secrets of the Clown",1346371200,,693,4.393700787401575
