8336867,5,B001QXZ81Q,"Terrifically acted by an amazing cast - Laurence Olivier, Alan Bates, Malcolm McDowell, and Helen Mirren - this is a fun, creepy and disturbing adaptation of the Harold Pinter play.

Not really opened up for TV (it was made for the BBC), more a photographed play. But the writing and acting are so delicious that the rough edged style doesn't matter, as we slowly piece together what did or didn't go on between McDowell and Mirren when they happened to meet at an hotel out of town, and the repercussions on their relationships at home; McDowell with Olivier, Mirren with Bates.

A must for any fan of Pinter's or the cast.

Note: This edition is a region 2 disc from the U.K., so you will need a region free player to be able to watch it.  There was a region 1 (US) DVD of this released, as part of 'The Laurence Olivier Collection' with both this play and Olivier as 'Big Daddy' in 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' that can play on regular U.S. players.  It can, however, be very hard to find as a separate disc, and not part of the big box set.",1439856000,,1039,4.280612244897959
