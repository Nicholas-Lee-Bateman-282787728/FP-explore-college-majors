1261054,5,B00003BDZY,"This was amazing. I am not a huge Anime person, but if one strikes my fancy I will watch it. This was right up my alley. It did everything right. The world was creepy, good characters, and left me wanting more. If Edgar Allen Poe were alive he would probably think this was great",1484179200,,279,4.185185185185185
1261055,5,B00003BDZY,I love Vampire Hunter D! It's a great movie,1483056000,,43,3.888888888888889
1261056,5,B00003BDZY,One of the best!,1481414400,,16,3.25
1261057,5,B00003BDZY,"It's a fantastic film! I'll say it is heavily flawed, with some bits of animation being flawed, some character designs taking a different look later, and it's extremely fast pace that doesn't allow anything to really develop. At the same time, the fast pace is also one of the best things about this film. It's technically a flaw, but the director claims he wanted to make a film that would just be entertaining, and that someone could put on to relax after stressful days at work or school, and VHD nails it! For the most part they only give time to what is completely necessary.

Animation is fine but the film looks extremely unique and has that colorful and charming look all 80s anime had. While I say colorful, the film is also very dark, but that makes sense because of it's setting obviously. It's dark a lot of the time, but the colors that are there are very warm and colorful. The characters look like the illustrations from the book mixed with FOTNS or generic 80s anime (makes sense as the director worked on FOTNS), and it makes something that looks like nothing else. Ad to that the extremely grotesque and creative monster designs and you have an extremely different looking film, and it's a joy to look at from start to finish!

The soundtrack is also fantastic! It's dark, moody and heroic when it needs to be. The tracks match their respective scenes perfectly. The credits song is a vocal piece titled ""You Song"" which was performed by the film's composer, and it's such a joy to listen to. Your Song is upbeat and a song you want to hear again as soon as it's over! Too bad Your Song isn't included on the film's soundtrack CD (highly recommend you hunt down the film's CD if you're a soundtrack fan)

As I said, it's weakest point is the lack of detail in the story, as many things aren't given time to be developed or explained further. It either expects you to have read the first novel which it's based off of (also recommended) or don't care and just want to be entertained. The film is extremely entertaining with plenty of action and a good story, and it never gets boring, so the director managed to accomplish his job perfectly! I've put it on when I was down, and it is the perfect film for that! It's escapism, it's creative and stylish. You get completely immersed in the world and are just entertained by everything about it. Technically the lack of story details is a flaw, but it's such a good film that it doesn't really matter. Highly recommended!",1474675200,,2485,4.517777777777778

1261104,5,B00003BDZY,"I was first introduced to D in 6th grade when my cousin let me borrow the first book. Yes, I said books. ITS A SERIES!!! There's about 17 books out for novels, and they are catching up in the manga. Yes there is also a manga! I highly suggest that anyone who loves this movie should definitely read the books. One, because there are a few obvious differences between the plot in the movies and those in the books. Two, because mastermind Hideyuki Kikuchi tells the story in such beautiful detail and it really pulls you into the world of the Frontier. I was in love with both the story and D ever since! Either way, you really can't go wrong!",1429660800,,642,4.31404958677686

1261116,5,B00003BDZY,"There is no beating around the bush with this title. Simply put, Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust is absolutely amazing. Right up there with Ninja Scroll and Ghost in the Shell this dark fantasy / sci-fi masterpiece puts you in an apocalyptic world of vampires, demons, magic, and romance. The animation style is a throwback to the years before heavy CGI (1980's and 1990's) which looks beautiful to this day. The soundtrack is memorizing and orchestrated almost to perfection, and the story line is about as epic as it comes. This title is a required watch for any woman that I date. It's an especially great title around the stormy Halloween season. Five out of five stars.",1428883200,,669,4.775862068965517

1261118,5,B00003BDZY,"If you loved the original, this is a worthy sequel. Enough of the back story is fleshed out so it can stand on it's own, but if you have seen the original, you will appreciate the care that went into this one. Would love to see more!",1427846400,,233,3.978723404255319
1261119,4,B00003BDZY,"A top tier anime, I only wish that this was available in HD or/and the original film was also available.",1426291200,,104,4.25
1261120,5,B00003BDZY,"This anime gem shines with quality storytelling and superb animation from the company Madhouse. From the beginning the story unfolds well introducing are enigmatic protagonist ""D"" and other supporting characters who are equally colorful in their own right. The antagonist is written to be sorry for or just apathetic to his actions. Personally I care for him as a character.

The animation style was clean and well animated. I will even go to say it was much better than the Afro Samurai anime. From the direction to the final editing made this film a classic to watch over and over again.

I will also mention that the American dubbed version was not the best of voice acting. I recommend watching this in its original Japanese or dubbed German with English sub titles.",1422662400,,770,4.825757575757576
1261121,5,B00003BDZY,This movie is both beautiful and exciting. Definitely a classic.,1420675200,,64,5.5

1261123,5,B00003BDZY,One does not know anime without having this movie in its collection. Unluckily there isn't still a blu ray version. A timeless classic Japanese animation.,1417132800,,154,5.2
1261124,5,B00003BDZY,"I'm not an anime fan, not in the slightest. Or at least I wasn't until I watched this film.

I had never given anime any kind of thought. I've watched cartoons my whole life but never really got into the Japanese animation stuff. One night while watching TV I put on HBO and this movie was on. In seconds I was hooked. Again the genre of anime never even came across my mind, I just saw it as some badass cartoon that I was lucky to catch,

I didn't see it from the beginning, but from the point I turned it on, it stayed till it was over. Few years later after doing on and off research I finally saw it available on DVD and bought it in a heartbeat.

The story is great, very gripping and entertaining, the animation is timeless and classic for someone who grew up watching cartoons in the 80's. I've seen others mention that they see the Sequel as a superior movie to this because the ""animation is better, and this one is so dated..."" Bullpoopy I say! This is like a classic movie, an old black and white, decade defining film that even after 30-50-100 years still is amazing despite the drivel that new technology force feeds down our glutenous throats.

Just because a newer movie has some ""better visuals or art"" does not make it a better movie. Often times the original or first of a series is the best despite them trying to go ""bigger and better."" In all honesty I own the sequel as well and I've watched it maybe once. It's not that good. The story is okay, the characters are one dimensional and it just doesn't suck you in (see what I did thar?).

In conclusion, if you like anime, this movies is a true classic. Don't like anime, hey neither do I really, but I love this movie. Like vampires and scary movies, buy this.",1415923200,,1733,4.287461773700306

The film is true to the original movie in that Vampire Hunter D is fighting for an ungrateful human population again and the blood flows and the hacked-off limbs fly. Once again our hero prevails. Since it's introduction to American audiences in the mid 80's, it's been a big hit and one of the major reasons that Americans came to love Anime films.",1380931200,,670,4.630252100840337

well, during my move, i lost this movie. i was in the mood to watch it again and went into a sort of panic from the loss. i few months ago, i checked on amazon but it wasn't available to purchase or rent. this past weekend i checked again and it was there for the taking. and thus i did. maybe in my older age, it wasn't quit as enjoyable as it was last i saw it, but still very entertaining.",1378252800,,871,4.063953488372093

I remember it as a fast paced pretty awesome viewing so when I purchased VHD recently (a few days ago) my expectations were high and I'm happy to say my second time go around hasn't been disappointing. How to describe this movie? It's kind of a cross between John Carpenter's The Thing meets Akira thrown in with Pale Rider. The movie itself is nothing short of true art. I love the gothic setting and old western feeling coupled with characters that aren't to over blown (perhaps with the exceptions of the ""bloody countess"" and the trio from the Barbarois). I suppose I'm weird, though, in my taste in movies. I like slow take your time set-ups with plenty of still sets. VHD is like this and one of my favorite scenes is when D is dug in the ground and it's raining outside, the movie isn't afraid to go against the grain of contemporary American movies and show you the scenery and let you get a glimpse of whats going on inside the characters heads. Overall their is to much to say about VHD in one review, suffice it to say if you want to spend about two hours of your time and not have your intelligence wasted, I'd recommend this one.

*Spoilers*

When I reviewed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampire-Hunter-D-Bloodlust/dp/B00005V1XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust</a>, I noted my frustrating with the character of ""D"" who is, in ""Bloodlust"" so perfect as to be an uninteresting cipher. Here, on the other hand, ""D"" is a much more interesting character - although still immensely powerful, he makes the occasional mistake, and he is capable of becoming emotional when dealing with a vulnerable woman and her frightened young brother, even going so far as to reach out and befriend them. For that character development alone, I'll give ""Vampire Hunter D"" a better rating than ""Bloodlust"".

Having said that, I should take this opportunity to note that if you're not already a fan of this particular anime, this movie probably won't convert you. The animation is very dated, and while I don't demand classic anime to look or feel 'modern', it is still crucial to be able to tell what's going on. The ""ubiquitous monochromatic colored background"" effect is used liberally, especially in fights and fleeing scenes, and I'm afraid watching a woman run jerkily in place while a blue ""background"" streaks behind her just doesn't get my pulse pounding. D himself flings himself over cliffs and through haunted castles, but often in such a manner that the viewer is faintly confused - how did he know where the castle was located?

Then again, it may be possible that the castle's location was posted as the nearest cross-roads - the movie can't quite decide how it wants to treat vampires. The setting here is ""Futuristic Western"", but the only 'futuristic' aspects are the electric fences around the ranches. Vampires seem to be less of a breed and more of a nobility in this world, and the movie seems uncertain whether or not humans can be turned. Does Doris face vampirism in her future, or is she just to be used up as a human play-thing? (""Bloodlust"" takes the more common route in this regard and is very plain and upfront that the ingnue *can* be turned and that this is a fate to be avoided.) On the other hand, again like ""Bloodlust"", minor characters can be turned into vampire slaves at the convenience of the baddies. It's not even clear what constitutes being a half-vampire like D - the local Count boasts a daughter who is revealed, to her surprise and disgust, to be half-human, but you'd think she would have NOTICED that fact about herself if it meant she had different abilities and/or limitations. You could say that she's only ""half-human"" in the sense of origin - i.e., that her mother was a human-turned-vampire and not a born-vampire, but then it seems odd that the same Dhampir label would be applied to her.

Finally, I really don't think it's too much to ask that at least one of these ""Vampire Hunter D"" movies explain D's talking, magical hand. It's not exactly a standard item, and I don't think I'm being unreasonable to expect a bit of backstory on that.

If you're a fan of the Vampire Hunter D series, I think it's safe to say you'll like this movie, but if you're just looking for a new, fresh anime movie to get into, I'd pass on D, unless you can find it at budget price.

1261268,5,B00003BDZY,"I first started developing a serious interest in anime in 1999.  I was in a record store called Plan 9 and came across this title while looking for another anime called Vampire Princess Miyu.  I was skeptical at first, but then thought, ""What the heck?""  I'm glad I made that purchase, because this anime is dark, bloody, risque and a landmark achievement.  The introduction itself gives me chills just THINKING about it!  Considering that this anime was made in 1985, WAY before I even knew what anime was, or what it stood for, I think everyone who was apart of the Urban Vision team were YEARS ahead of their time.  And interestingly enough, Vampire Hunter D takes place years ahead in the future.  But not quite the future one would come to expect as far as technological advances are concerned.  The firearms that some of the villagers posses are quite futuristic I guess, but don't expect to see an atmosphere that's comparable to let's say, The Jetson's.  Overall it's an epic anime, and it's now 24 years old.  So do yourself or another anime fan a favor and buy it.  I swear you won't regret it.",1250985600,,1104,4.581632653061225

1261271,5,B00003BDZY,"VAMPIRE HUNTER D

I have been watching anime since I can remember or at least since I was able to get my hands on it many moons ago. This one in particular is one of my favorites of all time and regardless of what any one tells me this will forever be in my one of the best ever. I know that some will say that I like this film just because it is older and is widely considered a classic while others will say that I should not rate it so high because of dated animation or what have you. All I can say to that is both of your points are true, this is the older film and is considered a classic by most and by today's standards it is dated. But that is were you are at fault for being overly judgmental and not understanding certain things.

Let's say that the dated argument is a legitimate flaw to the film but by that logic all those who say that about this film and praise ""Bloodlust"" so much for its looks will have to go back on that at some point. For those who love the second so much because of the animation just think of what the next film will look like especially if there is as much a time delay as there was between these first two. By the logic of the first is not so much a classic because of dated animation then that would mean eventually one would have to take back all the positives of the second in favor of the new and highly polished third film if there is to be one.

Don't get me wrong I love both films and enjoy both equally because I don't judge one against the other as far as animation. Story telling, voice acting, and even direction will always be up for debate because those are really constant from different time periods, there are those who do those well in every generation. The thing that is truly unfair is judging something based on things it can't help, animation gets better over the years because of the progression of technology and budgets. Therefore judging for the time period and such I would say this is excellent.

I love the animation in this first one mainly because it gives an other worldly and dark feel to the film, to be honest with out this animation the film may not have been the same. Be honest and really think about this, do you really think this would be better with the production value of the second film. The second film is a romance tell when it really comes down to it, therefore I think that the polished look and feel to the animation adds onto the over all storyline. Were as the fist film is about a girl taken against her will by creatures of the night that have a bloodlust as deep as their master, this film is more about the evil in that world not the beauty that could be. That means the grainy [dated] and dark feel of the animation is a perfect fit.

Now finally on to the actual film, ""Vampire Hunter D"". This first film is said to be based on the first in the series of books I believe, I have bought all of them so far but I have yet to find to time to read them. So to say this is the case would not be true n my part. What is true is it is based on the series and it's characters but I will have to read the first book to find the actual stories source material. As far as I know this is loosely based on the first book and did make some changes in the film version, but all is forgiven because I love this anime. ""Vampire Hunter D"" was brought to life on the screen by director Toyoo Ashida based on the works of D creator Hideuki Kikuchi, to me these two are legends because they helped create one of my favorite characters/stories/films of all time.

Our story is about a dhampir or dunpeal [which do you prefer] named D which means his of both vampire and human decent as his mother was human and you guessed it his father was a vampire. When we first happen upon D it is after a night spent with a girl named Doris [werewolf hunter like her father] who after hunting down some unfriendly creatures is bitten by a rather large fellow named Count Magnus Lee. Turns out that in the year 2,090 A.D. vampires and things like them are coming to an end even after many many years of ruling the lands. Well this Count is still holding on to all those old memories of ruling because he rules the land and all those in it just by taking what he wants, and what he wants is Doris.

Well this would not be what it is with out a skilled vampire hunter and he arrives in the form of D, who after easily dealing with Doris's attack on him agrees to help her in her fight with the Count. Of course Magnus is not a fan of this and sends his goons out to get her and each time D is there to either stop them or rescue the girl. The story really is that simple but the characters in this film are very interesting and the straightforward story telling of the first is excellent. The dark tone and feel of the movie is great and the fights, gore, and action are excellent. It doesn't hurt that the count has a pretty and interesting daughter who is opposed to his wanted arrangement with Doris. Add in some crazy looking creatures and vampires along with some more interesting characters like the majors cocky son and you have one great anime.

The acting is good especially for D { Michael McConnohie in the English version and Kaneto Shiozawa in the original} and Count Lee { Seiz' Kat' in the original and Jeff Winkless in the English}. Also it should be noted that Carl Macek is the man who produced and directed the English version of this film. Any way all involved on both sides should be commended.

As far as I can tell most people either love it or like it because I never have really meet any one who hated this film. And those who only like it seem to be the ones who judge it based on the animation thing, there are those who only like it but prefer the second film based on story, structure, acting or what ever. Those seem like more legitimate reasons to prefer the second film over this one not just disliking it more because of ""dated"" animation. Any way different people have different taste and for me this is a classic by far as is the second one in my opinion, I don't know maybe I am just a sucker for vampires. Also there is a huge thing about what his real name is like D could not be his real name at all, what if it is? Also he could just ride under the title Vampire Hunter D as in Vampire Hunter dhampir or dunpeal. But you could also say that D is the initial of his very famous vampiric fathers name, now who do you think that could be?",1242000000,,6437,4.147317854283426

The animation is good for it's time (originally released in 1985), the story is full of tension, with numerous surprises.
As others have noted, there is a follow-up video (""Bloodlust""), which has excellent animation qualities and a good story, but ""D"" loses a bit of the depth and complexity shown in this film. I do recommend seeing this first - it is both the earlier film and chronologically earlier in the story of ""D"", and it seems to me to make ""Bloodlust""s improvements in animation quality even better.
Be aware, this is not for kids - there is quite a bit of blood and complex story line, along with a bit of nudity.

The subject matter of this movie is graphic (So no one under the age of 17 or 18 should watch this DVD in my opinion). Also there are features on the DVD that will allow you to see how the movie was put together (Although if you aren't fluent in Japanese I strongly recommnd you activate the english subtitles they have).

The sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampire-Hunter-D-Bloodlust/dp/B00005V1XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampire Hunter D - Bloodlust</a>, is another easy five star film with beautiful modern animation and first-rate voice talent, but there is just something about the original; an ambiance that no other film has that makes it unique and utterly mesmerizing as well as creepy and just downright enjoyable.  Some would say the 80's animation is dated, but I say forget all that.  Modern animators couldn't recreate this work if they tried.  ""Vampire Hunter D"" was a perfect storm of animated horror and it has lost absolutely nothing in my opinion.

The story is deceptively simple, though there are a few twists and turns along the way.  it begins with that amazing scene of our heroine, Doris, chasing and killing a beast devouring her crops.  She finds herself defenseless before the local Aristocrat, a vampire named Magnus Lee (after a vampire from a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/short-story/dp/0143039393/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">short story</a>&nbsp;and horror legend Christoper Lee).  After being bitten by the vampire, her fellow villagers shun her leaving her alone except for her young brother.  But rather than despair, Doris seeks out and hires a vampire hunter.  A hunter known only as ""D"".  What does the D stand for?  You'll see.  The three stand together against the horrors of of The Count's numerous followers including his prideful daughter Larmica (an almost-anagram for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carmilla/dp/0809510839/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carmilla</a>) and the result is one hell of a ride.

As I stated in the video, this movie has possibly the best menagerie of creatures of any horror film.  First and foremost is the mysterious, intelligent (snarky even), and powerful parasite that lives in D's hand.  It's an outstanding device that deepens the questions about the hero's past and gives us somebody to explicate (D rarely speaks) while we journey through this bizarre world.  There are giant golems, phantom beasts, werewolves, giant snake-women, and many more imaginative and unforgettable creatures to be slain on the path to the final showdown with the millenia-old vampire.  The carnage is wonderful.

The disc comes with some bonus features such as a making-of segment and an interesting preview for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Playstation-game/dp/B00004U4SR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Playstation game</a>, plus the trailer for the sequel which is among the best sequels of all time and had me as excited as I've ever been for a film prior to it's release.  ""Vampire Hunter D"" is a rare case of the movie being superior to the book, though one could probably blame the stiff translation from Japanese to English for most of the novel's faults.  I think I've said enough: if you love horror and/or animation, then it doesn't get any better.",1223510400,4,4029,6.459962756052142

1261291,5,B00003BDZY,"In the pitch blackness of an imminent thunderstorm, a pigtailed peasant girl by the name of Doris Lang makes her way through overgrown grasses with laser rifle in hand, endeavoring to rid her property of the ferocious werewolves and reptilian mutants that wander unchecked amid the blue shadows of the night.  Meanwhile, back at the Lang homestead some distance away, little brother Dan battles tirelessly to keep swirling clouds of flesh-eating smoke away from the livestock.  As the red-clad youngster blasts away at the misty intruders, he is unaware that deep in the gloom of the fields beyond, his big sister has just witnessed the horrific sight of her beloved white horse, Luke, being torn and devoured by the bloodthirsty beasts of the underworld, leaving the miniskirted maiden completely alone in the foggy darkness.  Not even her electrified whip can save Doris from what comes next--a towering figure in black bears down upon her with fangs like daggers and eyes like fire.

Hope comes in the unlikely form of a stoic and usually silent stranger wrapped in a flowing cape and colored from head to toe like the Stygian midnight.  A wide-brimmed hat, narrow collar points and long strands of brown hair frame his gaunt, pallid face.  On his back he wears a slender sword of steel and beneath him trots a mechanical steed with horns like some equine devil.  This cool and fearless hero for hire is called D, the vampire hunter, and Doris prays he can find and destroy the ten-thousand year-old fiend that pierced her pretty neck with his foul teeth--the dreaded Count Magnus Lee--before the resulting infection turns her into the Count's personal vampire slave.

If he is to slay this ancient aristocrat villain, D must first venture into Count Lee's vast stone castle; squash teeming hoards of squirming pink worms; topple a gargantuan Frankenstein's monster; dodge a cackling bat-winged ghoul; fight off a yellow-eyed wolf phantom; slice and dice a diminutive green spider collector and avoid having his life force drained by the slithering Snake Women of Midwich...all while enduring relentless remarks of ridicule from his verbally-abusive left hand!  Can the unflappable Mr. D reach the undead owner of this dismal fortress and spare the lovely Doris a miserable life of solitude and madness in her village's notorious internment camp for vampire victims?  Furthermore, can the mysterious hunter outwit the Count's cold and cunning daughter, Lamika, and defeat the blade-tossing aspiring nobleman, Rei Ginsei...without losing his head?  And what, exactly, does the `D' stand for?  The answers to all these questions and more can only be found on D's DVD.

This Special Edition disc contains both the English dub version and the subtitled Japanese version of the legendary animated thriller.  Also included are trailers; footage from the Vampire Hunter D PlayStation game; an English subtitled `Making of' featurette; and a gallery of drawings by Amano.  Showcasing brilliantly designed characters and a wonderfully creepy atmosphere, Vampire Hunter D is a spine-tingling anime masterpiece you won't soon forget.  It's recommended for mature audiences only due to exploding craniums, severed appendages, exposed innards and the obligatory shower scene.

1261292,5,B00003BDZY,"Vampire Hunter D (1985) is up there with the likes of Ninja Scroll, Akira and Ghost in a Shell, so if you are looking for the best of the best Manga, or even just outrageously good horror, then Vampire Hunter D is a must see.

A mix of Hammer Horror ideas plus some cracking good 80s style Manga animation coupled with outrageously good fight sequences produces a feeling of watching something that really does transport us into the canvas of neo-vampires and monsters galore battling it out.

The story revolves around vampire Counts of the upper class aristocracies who rule the lands and occasionally kidnap a lower class girl to become their wives for recreation until they get fed up with them. D is the Vampire Hunter hired to take down the Count. Cue a stunning work of art that runs red off the screen and lucid landscapes, castles that put Disney to shame and full moons like on another planet.

Vampire D will stir your imagination and make you feel like you have just sat through one of the best horror stories you have ever seen. It is a satiating substance to see.

Vampire Hunter D is a vampire hunter.  I don't wish to give too much of the story away but he is, surprise, surprise, not all that he seems to be.
Kind of a mixture of Gothic horror and a dystopian setting it seems a tad too dark.  I don't mean the setting as much as it is sometimes hard to follow what is going on when everybody is wearing black, when fighting at night, covered in black blood.

1261313,5,B00003BDZY,"""Vampire Hunter D"" is a pretty deserving anime classic -- moody hero, gothic atmosphere, and buckets of blood.

While the animation is a bit dated, the solid direction and creepy story are more than enough to compensate. This dark, gloomy adaptation of Hideyuki Kikuchi's novels is a postapocalyptic cowboy/vampire story... with a twist. And boy, is it a twist.

Farm girl Doris is bitten by the ancient Count Lee (named after Christopher Lee), and is in danger of turning into a vampire herself. But fortunately she encounters D, a silent vampire hunter who agrees to protect her and her little brother from the Count and his underlings.

But Doris gets kidnapped despite D's efforts, and D sneaks into the castle and battles past mutants and snake-women to rescue Doris. But that isn't the end of the conflict -- Lee is determined to have Doris for his new wife, and D is just as determined to destroy the malign old vampire.

""Vampire Hunter D"" looks a little dated to modern anime fans -- kind of smudgy and stiff (look at D's weird stabbing scene). Fortunately, the story more than makes up for this -- basically it's an old western, but with monsters, vampires, and cyborg horses.

The whole thing is very dark and shadowy, even in prim little towns, up until the final scenes when we finally see some sun. The storyline moves pretty slowly for awhile, but speeds up rapidly when Doris is abducted the second time, right up to the earthshattering finale.

It's also peppered with some solid fight scenes, as well as the gore: severed limbs, electric whips, exploding heads, flying organs and literal gushers of blood. While the tone is quite grim, some of the dialogue is pretty funny (""For the first time in one hundred years I haven't been bored once!""). Including everything said by Left Hand, the hilarious parasite in D's... left hand.

D himself is an enigma for most of the movie -- repressed, quiet, kind to kids, but with a hidden vampiric side that only turns up occasionally. It takes careful attention to figure out who this ""dampeel"" is. And while Doris could have been a bit tougher, she comes across very realistically as a young girl in a terrifying situation.

""Vampire Hunter D"" is a postapocalyptic goth movie, with a likably taciturn hero,a  timeless storyline, and a lot of graphic anime violence.",1170374400,7,2324,4.79
1261314,5,B00003BDZY,"A good portion of the not so positive reviews for this film are due to the authors' preference of the 16 year in coming Vampire Hunter D film, entitled ""Bloodlust"". I understand that the aforementioned film is quite beautiful, with some of the most stunning visuals I've ever seen in anime. Therein lies the problem, however, because viewing ""Bloodlust"" first usually leads to a bias; people then usually see the first one and claim that ""Bloodlust"" has so much going for it besides just a gorgeous presentation (it's almost formulaic how it happens).

Many people fail to see the potential of this 1985 classic (based on Hideyuki Kikuchi's first in a series of japanese novels), and instead they complain that the animation is ""dated"". What people fail to see is the very compelling (albeit familiar) story and unique characters. Most of all, the few underlying themes within the film. The film (set in the year 12,090) is about a victimized yet strong female character named Doris who lives in a rural area and looks after her younger brother Dan without the help of any family (the only one that can care for both of them is the local doctor, Ferring). Humanity lives in a time where after a nuclear holocaust, they coexist with mutants, monstrosities, and vampires (the latter of which is seen by themselves and others as ""nobility""). During a routine hunt, Doris's horse is viciously (and graphically) killed by the werewolf of the local 10,000 year old vampire count, Magnus Lee. Lee then bites Doris, and intends to take her as his wife. Doris encounters the very stoic, very strong and dark vampire hunter, named D. The movie follows D's efforts to storm Lee's castle, deal with his many monstrous henchmen, and kill the count, in order to save Doris from becoming a vampire.

2001's film, ""Bloodlust"" (based on Kikuchi's third novel in the series) is about the kidnapping of a young woman named Charlotte Melbourne by a young looking vampire named Meier Link. Charlotte's father hires D to bring her back, or kill her if she is to become a vampire herself. Not only does Charlotte's father hire D, but also the cocksure team of bounty hunters called the Markus Brothers (and sister, Leila). Meier Link becomes wise to the various hunters, and hires members of the Barbaroy, a clan of viscious monsters. Throughout the film the viewer learns that Charlotte may not have been kidnapped, and she and Meier Link may actually love each other (despite Meier's realization of the inescapable lust he will have to have for Charlotte).

Though both films may seem to have similar stories (A cool calm and collected hunter needs to save a girl, etc), it is the 1985 film that clearly shines. The way the story is told in the original one is very straighforward, whereas ""Bloodlust"" is a very cheesy romantic story full of plot holes and an overabundance of characters. There are very smart themes throughout the film, such as identity (D's dealing with the imbalance of his vampire and his human side, Lamica and the harsh realization of her true nature, and mutant Rei's yearning for nobility), and the ignorance of true nobility (the Lee family mistakenly goes against their famous ancestor's true beliefs). The themes of ""Bloodlust"" are a bit more cliche, such as the dealing with characters' pasts which they can't escape, and love vs. lust.

Another quality the 1985 film has going for it are the powerful characters. D is a man frustrated with his identity (a half human and half vampire who has to deal with his possesed left hand constantly and wryly reminding him of his true nature) and struggling with the possible love of the female protagonist. Doris is a damsel in distress (albeit a strong one) with the responsibility of caring for her brother and the humiliation of being shunned by her hometown for being bitten by the Count. Doris also has to understand that she cannot ever have feelings for D, because D cannot repress his vampiric lust. The Lee family looks at themselves as noble yet they are gravely ignorant of their ancestors true beliefs. Count Lee is a near 10,000 year old vampire overridden by boredom, resulting in his turning to ""having fun"" with human women every hunderd or so years. Lee's daughter heavily follows her father's mistaken belief of humans being nothing more than livestock (leading to a pounding realization later in the film). Lee's henchman Rei Ginsei is a mutant with strange talents, who wants to be accepted into the house of Lee so that he isn't looked at as scum. Supporting the main characters are Dr. Ferring the town's humble doctor who tries his best to stand up for Doris; and Doris's brave younger brother Dan who looks up to D as a role model and tries to shape himself into the same kind of person. The problem with the characters in ""Bloodlust"" is that amongst the main characters of D (suffering from similar issues in the original film), Leila Markus (haunted by the past of her dead mother during her childhood), and Charlotte & Meier (their yearning to share their misunderstood love for each other), there are various supporting characters such as the Markus Brothers (hunters with no real past besides a reputation), the monstrous Barbaroy (ditto), and the bloody Countess Carmilla (the evil spirit of a vampire who aids the couple, with an agenda of her own). This ""supporting cast"" doesn't really seem to have a point, other than to be killed in some way by D or someone else. The story of Carmilla in relation to D seems to be a plot hole that isn't exactly explained.

Before comparing animation, I will first say that ""Bloodlust"" has some of the most vivid and gorgeous visuals I've ever seen in any anime and it would be no comparison as to which one is of finer quality. However, the art style and tone of the 1985 film is much more representative of the type of story being told. The original film is very dark, eerie, mysterious, a bit more of the macabre. ""Bloodlust"" however has many bright scenes, and seems much less dark and much less serious (a small tidbit that will soon be covered), this takes away very much from the dark nature and intention of the title character and the genre. The music shows this too: In ""Bloodlust"" it is very theatric, and over the top, whereas in the original it is subtle and foreboding.

Although this quality of the 2001 piece is less outward than the rest of what I have mentioned, it is nonetheless remarkable. There is a very evident Americanization of a story of Japanese origin within ""Bloodlust"" and the genre its story represents. As mentioned before the tone of ""Bloodlust"" is often times comedic and more action oriented than horror, which takes away heavily from the dark nature of the Vampire Hunter D mythos. What is characteristic of American horror is that even in the darkest tales, there is usually someone or something there for comic relief (go figure, evidentially ""Bloodlust"" was originally recorded in the English language). D's left hand is reduced from a dark entity sardonically reminding D of his true self to a sort of wise cracking sidekick.

The whole point of this was not only to review a great film I am a huge fan of, but to point out why I view this film as wholly superior to a 2001 film that gets more praise. In regards to ""Bloodlust"", I think it's a great film with a lot of potential that simply went to waste. Many people hide behind the fact that it's so stunningly animated, but ""What's a good looking plate with nothing on it?""",1154908800,71,7486,4.736196319018405
1261315,5,B00003BDZY,"Vampire Hunter D was the first authentic anime movie I had ever seen - episodes of the Thundercats despite their guilty charm and obvious anime foundation don't really count - and I was pretty impressed.  I caught a showing of it one morning on The Sci-Fi Channel's Anime Sunday and could finally appreciate all the fuss about anime.  Visually striking in its stylized approach and frenetic execution, Anime's power lies in tales of high-octane genre action.  While anime enthusiasts might somehow welcome a rendition of Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs, I suspect that while the Wicked Witch would probably come out all the more wicked, the dwarves would resemble something out of Pokemon.  And nobody really needs more of that, right?

After watching a few minutes of this disc, you clearly see that either a technician fell asleep while balancing brightness levels, or the studio wanted a darker release.  When comparing the trailer and other clips from the supplements, it's obvious that this print is noticeably darker.  At no time does it really become distracting, but for those who have seen other versions, keep in mind that this one is a much darker transfer.  Considering that the movie is 14 years old, it's not in bad shape.  Also, since it's animation generally colors in animated films are usually bold primary ones and deeply saturated, so there's a bit of a washed out look to the color scheme here.  But by and large the transfer is free of defects, pixelation and the compression is good with no apparent artifacts.  There are two soundtracks - one in Japanese the other in English.  Both mixes are powerful when needed, yet retain the subtleties of the quieter moments.

The disc has an extensive trailer selection showcasing other anime titles such as Wicked City and it also includes the trailer for Vampire Hunter D 2000 - the sequel.  Also as another trailer of sorts is the preview for the Vampire Hunter D -  Playstation Video Game.  Running nearly three minutes in length, it combines a video introduction with generous samplings of the video game.

A video clip comprised of graphic concepts and work samples of Yoshitaka Amano, the artist whose illustrations for the Vampire Hunter D novels formed the basis for the look and film design, makes up the Image Gallery.  Set to a haunting musical score, this gives the audience a peek at the beginning of the Vampire Hunter D characters and also a look into future Amano projects - including an upcoming collaboration with Neil Gaiman of Sandman fame.

Finally, there's The Making of Vampire Hunter D - at just under 10 minutes, this is a nice behind the scenes look at the film - complete with interviews of cast and crew.  Narrated in Japanese with English subtitles, we see the surprisingly modest animation studio which produced the film along with excited voice over artists thrilled at being given the opportunity to bring these popular Asian characters to life.

Vampire Hunter D succeeds as a crossover anime film.  Combining futuristic hard-edged action that's the hallmark of anime with dark, gothic elements of the horror and fantasy genres, it works remarkably well.  Today we're accustomed to the action/horror blend of such popular franchises as Wesley Snipe's Blade and of course Buffy: The Vampire Slayer, however, Vampire Hunter D having debuted in 1983 is the forefather to those vampire hunters.  Perhaps only The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires released in 1974 by Hammer Films was an earlier mixture of martial arts and vampires.  But where that and most other forays into action/horror never stray far from traditional trappings, Vampire Hunter D employs a decidedly unique element by setting the environment far into the future- a world still recognizable, though far removed from our own.",1154822400,8,3790,4.9683042789223455
1261326,5,B00003BDZY,"This gothic sci-fi apocalypse is a classic. It is a gift to have it on DVD. The images are simple, strong and moving. The musical score is superb. The plot is subtle and refined. Strongly recommended.",1154649600,3,200,4.583333333333333
1261327,5,B00003BDZY,"If you've never seen this film before, then you'll probably think that the animation/sketches are a little prosaic. But for the record, this movie was made in the 1980s, directly before Japanese Animation became widespread. Hence, the drawings themselves are quite extraordinary for their time, and the movie itself was a major stepping stone in the proliferation of adult-oriented, animated films.

The majority of the scenes in the film are generally dark, morose, and creepy...but in a good way. The film itself is set far into the future where technological advances abound, but ironically enough, the people live, work, and dress as if it's the 18th Century. The main character is a quiet, yet very lethal ""dumpeel"" by the name of D. Throughout the film dumpeels are characterized as half vampire/half human creatures who, like many real, unfortunate half-breeds, have a great deal of trouble making friends on either side. Because of this, D is a professional vampire hunter who most likely hopes to gain the acceptance of his human peers.

In the beginning of the movie, D meets a young, attractive girl named Doris who has been attacked and bitten by an ancient and  extremely formidable vampire known as Count Magnus Lee. Thus, D sets out to kill the vampire who's bitten Doris before she turns into a vampire herself. Of course, if you've seen any number of vampire flics, then this probably sounds very formulaic. However, I assure you that ""Vampire Hunter D"" is unique in every way. It was the first of its kind, and it set the bar for its remarkably laudable sequel, ""Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,"" which was made some 20 years later. So I suggest you give this film a try, and if you're a big anime fan, definitely check out the sequel.",1141862400,5,1749,4.842809364548495

The music and the effects are all out left behind. But the story stands timeless. It is a must for Anime and Manga fans.",1140825600,3,481,4.127659574468085
1261329,5,B00003BDZY,"This was my favorite anime, and still is, and I will tell you why, and why it's better than the sequel, Bloodlust.

In short, this is the story of the ultimate hero, who fights for what's right against the whole city, and saves the town from an overpowering evil. It deals with complex issues of class, nobility, and power, and every character has a different thing to say about it, and a different role in the story.  The big downside that people have trouble with is the graphics, which gets too dark and looks like old anime, which it is.

Bloodlust is the complete opposite. The sequel has characters for no reason, a simple story of love vs. lust, and D, the main hero, isn't even a hero at all, he's just a mercenary doing his job!! Oh yeah, but the graphics are really sweet.

In sum, this is a post-apocalyptic, sci-fi vampire anime told in the style of a western, with a deep plot and lots of blood.  If you see one anime, I would see this or the old Fist of The Northstar (NOT the new series).  You could also check this out on Youtube before you rent it!",1140220800,,1065,4.27363184079602

Bloodlust (the sequel) however amazed the life out of me and until its arrival i thought i would never find such amazement in an anime film since production IG's work.

The beauty of this anime though is the atmosphere surrounding the settings. They drag you into the film as quickly as if you were living it. You feel for the many characters in the film that must live in these settings, and want nothing more than for them to have something better.

And that's really the story of Vampire Hunter D. A young girl and her younger brother live in the shadow of a powerful vampire, and hire the hero D to get rid of him. It seems generic, but it isn't. Surprises and thrills fill the movie from beginning to end, and should leave you interested despite a predictable ending. And at the end you finally see the light...

The rabid boosters of all things anime will have you believe it is a masterpiece on a level with the original Dracula, or some such nonsense. This is obviously not true if you look at it without the rose colored glasses of anime fandom. But neither is it true that it is a terrible, horrible piece of crap not worth watching.

It boasts interesting character design (for D at least), a thoughtful plot, an unusually well written score and some clever scenic work. It suffers from the usual hackneyed anime style clichs of huge eyed, huge breasted characters, silly speed lines and up-in-the sky combats, a terrible English dub with Speed-Racerish voice acting, and cheap, often very crude cycled animation.

The basic plot is that Vampire Hunter D is working for a young woman named Doris Lang, who was bitten by the vampire, Count Magnus Lee. It's an older movie, so if you don't like 80's style animation this sort of movie isn't really for you, unless, of course, you love vampire movies. I'd have to say, overall, it's a good movie.

1261352,4,B00003BDZY,"I think this movie, along with the BloodLust edition are a little over-rated.  Yes, I agree that it has superb graphics, artwork and action sequence.  But something about the plot bugs me and nobody here has really mention it.

As you all know, D is a vampire hunter, who himself is half vampire and half human.  I believe his mother was the human.  He comes in to rescue Doris from the nearly invicible Magnus Lee (which I think is a very cool name).

Two things bugs me about this series.  One is that D is constantly talking about eliminating all the vampires.  Well, he is vampire too (he doesn't have reflections when he looks in the mirror, so he's probably more vampire than human).  So when all the other vampires are eliminated, does he just wander around feeling redeemed?  I think there is a sense of hypocrisy in his philosophy, don't you think?  Also, you have to remember that not all vampires are bad, just like not all humans are good (Bloodlust talks about this).  D is too absolute in his belief, thinking that all vampires are bad, which I think is sickening.  A story that puts everything in black-and-white doesn't deserve 5 stars.

Lastly, my major criticism is that D is too powerful.  How can a young hybrid (it doesn't matter if he's the descendent of Dracula, because he'll still have only 1/2 his power) be more powerful than a 10,000 year old vampire king?!  In this movie, there's a holy candle that can severly weaken a vampire.  When D is confronted with it, he falls to his knee, but when Magnus Lee saw the candle, he could destroy it by staring at it!  That shows how incredibly powerful Magnus Lee is, but D can overmatched him, which makes no sense!  If they changed the storyline so that D was able to out-smart Magnus with some ingenious thinking or trick, it would be easier to swallow.

How you guys who give 5 stars with all these major flaws (especially that last one I mention) and simple plotline is beyond me!  I do admit that this is a classic, so I'll give it 4 stars.",1112745600,2,2015,4.465753424657534

Pros: A unique storyline. (This was one of the first really well known and liked vampire animes. Many series evolved from this father of them all) Interesting characters. (D was my favorite, by far, but the others had a truly human nature, which made them appealing) Vicious vampires. (Well, yeah.) Lotsa blood. (For those who like it)
Cons: Lotsa blood. (For those who don't like it) Gritty color quality. (Maybe it was intentional) Gritty sound quality. (Maybe it was intentional) Ridiculous costumes. (Doris seriously needed more clothes!) Pathetically bad dubbing and voice actors. (Really, it's kinda sad...) An ending that makes you sigh, and not in a good way. (Very cliched...)
Well, overall, this movie is worth seeing and maybe worth buying. It just had (in my opinion) poor color and animation, but a storyline that somewhat redeemed it. See it SUBTITLED, not dubbed.

1261398,4,B00003BDZY,"""Kyketsuki Hunter D"" is the oldest example of anime I have seen to date, having originally been released in 1985, which becomes a necessary grain of salt in rendering an evaluation of the animation.  My initial impression was that this would have been considered pretty cool a decade earlier, but by today's standards there is just way too much emphasis on minimalist animation: softer and rounder character designs, lots of blood and gore, higher framerate, panning and scanning, loops, color and lighting changes, lower detail, etc.
The story begins 10,000 years in the future with our heroine, young Doris Ran, the daughter of a werewolf hunter, who is out carrying on the family tradition one night by hunting mutant animals in her skimpy little outfit when she encounters the local vampire count, Magnus Lee, who marks her with his bite, planning to make her his future bride.  At this point out hero, in the great tradition of a Sergio Leone spaghetti western except for the giant sword, rides into town.  Fortunately he is a vampire hunter and since he says virtually nothing there is every reason to believe he might be able to take the count and his minions down a peg or two.  There are several distracting subplots (Doris has a worshipping kid brother and the lecherous son of the mayor wants to jump her) but this movie comes down to two key questions for D: whether or not he can kill the count and/or love Doris.
The other big question is how old you think Doris is, and you should decide early on because this film has a shower scene in which you are going to see her neked and if you think she is under aged you ought to be ashamed of yourself.  On the other hand, the simple scene is a lot more effective than most of the nudity I have seen in live action films in the past decade (and my favorite shot of the film shows a strand of Doris' hair failing away and leave her neck bare while she is embracing D--remember what the Japanese think about a woman's neck).

""Vampire Hunter D"" (you really want to emphasize the ""D"" according to the Japanese trailers) is based on a pair of novels by Hideyuki Kikuchi (""Wicked City"" and ""Demon City Shinjuku"") and not reading these books puts the viewer at something of a disadvantage.  There are a few brief bursts of exposition delivered by characters at various times, but I still had a hard time piecing together the new world order depicted in this film.  I thought for a while the titular character had a talking sword, but it turned out to be a saracastic parasite that lives in his hand.  The second time around I was able to put everything together a lot better, but I do have a much better appreciation now of why people who had not read Frank Herbert's novel had such a hard time with David Lynch's ""Dune"" movie.
I have to admit I do not get why this particular anime is such a cult favorite.  For every good moment there is another than seems sub-par.  But the resulting mix is certainly interesting, especially for fans of vampire fiction.  The post-apocalyptic world is nothing special but the concept of the dampiel, the vampire-human half-breed is certainly interesting, and the mystery of ""D"" is a toss-up.  It might not be a keeper for everyone, but it certainly deserves at least one viewing.",1043193600,15,3267,4.583190394511149
1261399,4,B00003BDZY,"Okay, so the animation is far from perfect. Despite that, it's a great anime. The story isn't complex, which is rare in any anime nowadays.

This may not be the anime to see if you're trying to find a DVD to experiment and decide if Anime is something you really want to delve into.

It's not cheesy, the animation is pretty good for it's release date, and the characters are perfect.

VHD's story is unoriginal but takes place in an interesting world. So it had potential but didn't quite take advantage of it. The animation is unexscusable no matter how old it is.

1261405,5,B00003BDZY,"This is the original Vampire Hunter D, done in 1985 under the direction of Toyoo Ishida.  It tells a different story than the animation made in 2001 ('Bloodlust'), done by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, but shares the same world and main character.  The beautiful character designs of Yoshitaka Amano originally done for the novel series by Hideyuki Kikuchi are the artistic core of both films.
The story is set in 12,090 A.D., as millennia of rule by vampires slowly come to an end.  While vampires are increasingly rarer, those that are left still rule the night, making use of their mutant and werewolf servants to help them gain access to human prey.  They are the oldest, and the only threats to them come from the vampire hunters.  One such hunter is D, a dunpeal (damphir) - the child of a vampire and a human.
On a lonely night Doris Ran, a young farmer, waits on a road for D, willing to offer anything if the eerie killer can rescue her from the plans of Count Magnus Lee - who has selected her as a human consort.  Bitten by the vampire, suspected by all the villagers, Doris has little chance for survival if D cannot stop the elder vampire's plans.  Standing in D's way are Lee's own deluded childe Ramika and his servant, Ray Ginsay, who has the singular ability to bend time so that the attacker becomes the attacked.  This struggle will take all of D's powers and cunning.
The film makes an interesting contrast of D and his opponent Magnus Lee.  Equal in heritage, Lee is the magically stronger, but half-human D can walk in the sunlight.  Both are doomed to lonely lives.  For Lee, there is no longer a society of vampires.  For D, there are none like him; his powers are a curse that makes life as a human impossible.
It is probably unfair to compare the two films, both have excellent stories and superb illustration, even though 15 years of technology separates them.  Perhaps the 2001 version comes closer to Yoshitaka Amano's original artwork, but the older plot seems truer to what Hideyuki Kikuchi was doing.  However, this is splitting hairs - they are each excellent examples of their genre.  Whichever you see first, you will soon want to view the other as well.",1035849600,,2178,4.606217616580311

1261427,5,B00003BDZY,"I was half expecting a completely dark, victorian-type vampire fest when I rented this movie. The hero would be quiet and deadly, and the vampires would appear out of the darkness, with ensuing fight scenes and blood everywhere. But this movie was particularly surprising to me for it's variety of comic book type characters and its well done voice acting. There are certain dialogues and plot settings that give away the fact that Vampire Hunter D was a novel before it was a movie. But the creativeness of the characters and plot make the movie worthy of some praise. The characters were well animated and the plot did not end up an all out gore fest. And the sheer creativity that went into the characters and the world around them keep the movie interesting. I enjoy the fact that there is a mix of ancient gothic buildings and swords right along side rocket powered ships and automatic weapons. One minute the characters are passing through dark mountains, to ancient castles, then to  what seems like a wild west saloon with sheriff included! But the movie somehow makes each transition glide smoothly to create a diverse world for the characters to travel through. This was a pleasant surprise and change from the typical anime, and is a must see for moviegoers of all types.",1032220800,,1282,4.748878923766816

  Vampire fans, anime fans, fantasy fans, action fans, a movie for everyone. I like this original version more than than new 2001 movie, though the 1985 animation is certainly not up to par. While time wise very short, it nevertheless contains a lot of action and plot. I can't comment on the subtitled vs. dubbed versions, not having seen it subtitled, but I'd like to think the voice acting is nicely in character.

  That being said, it is a classic anime film and very engaging.  D has got to be one of the coolest anime characters around.  One of the gripes I had, though, was that the whole romance between him and the girl seems very forced and unrealistic.  Now I know what you're going to say. ""It's a vampire movie and you want realism!?""  I just couldn't feel any chemistry between the characters and it seemed like the relationship was just thoughtlessly thrown in there.

I've already ordered the sequel (Bloodlust) on ebay. i wouldn't recommend this movie to children due to extreme violence and a little nudity. There is a great story which is not too hard to follow. The plot twists and turns throught the movie and it definately keeps you on the edge of your seat. Buy it today!,1027209600,,471,4.130434782608695
1261431,2,B00003BDZY,Now The movie definately was violent and for that I enjoyed it but otherwise I did not find anything origanal or likable about it. Not to mention so many things make zero sense. Why do they ride robotic horses when they could drive a car or something sense they obviously have the technology? Why do they use melee weapons save the appearance of 3 guns when houses are protected by laser defence grids? I addition they had to some how tie the storyline to count Dracuala which I found unoriginal. The western theme just did not work for me either. I guess if your really into violence and do not care for much else you would be a big fan of this movie.,1025568000,,652,4.308943089430894

1261433,5,B00003BDZY,"One of the first, more serious animes I saw when I was younger, Vampire Hunter D has kept its appeal till today. Seeing it for the first time on cable TV I was drawed in to the world that blended myth, technology(both future and old), into a future epic about a Dunpeal named D, a quiet man, and his parasitic hand, who provides the banter, who hunt vampires. The show gave me a sense of power and honor and taught me how act as D acts.
D's main goal is to help save Doris, who was bitten by Count Magnus Lee, and to do so he must kill the one who bit her. Many obstacles lay ahead as D gets attacked by the Count's many minions and the perdicament in which Doris and her brother Dan are in. As the story progresses further we find out the truth of who D really is by finding out who is father was and why he is so powerful. But to really understand why D does the things he does one would also have to see Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust to get a better picture. Though it isn't a true sequel it uses the same basic elements.
A classic pure and simple. This anime taught me a few things as a child and gave me the sense of honor I have to day. As for the show itself it is a beautiful epic with a great plot although a bit cliched by today's standards. If it is any indication of how well this anime has retained it's appeal after nearly 15 years it should be a nice addition to your library.",1024704000,,1388,3.9964028776978417

The other thing about it, is that you don't have to see the first ""Vampire Hunter D"" movie to understand this one.  That's why it is so good.  I still recomend seeing the first one though.  By doing that, you'll have a better grasp on the character D and where he comes from.
The digital art in this is also an A+.  Normally I don't care too much for it, but in this movie it is great.  For any anime fan, this is a must have.",1024617600,,698,4.165413533834586

Most of what I loved about the first movie is missing from this one.  D doesn't seem as noble a character as he did before (though some virtue does shine through).  The damsel here is a lovesick puppy who is smitten with the vampire who kidnapped her.  And we don't really even know who the real villain is until the end of the movie.  Granted, this last point can make for a good plot, but there wasn't enough forshadowing to really make this work.  The villain isn't even mentioned until within the last half-hour of the film.
The new voice that they got for his hand was a HORRIBLE CHOICE, by the way.
The good points of the movie include the awesome musical score and the animation, which is mixed with good computer animation that almost makes some backgrounds look real.  I have heard that this movie was actually made in the U.S., making a literal subtitle translation unnecessary.
In short, this is a okay movie, but the original is MUCH better.",1023062400,,1194,4.435779816513762

She raises her rifle and spurts hot rounds into the neck and head of a fierce night creature. The monster falls squirting streams of blood into the night air, as Doris' horse appears. With only half of its remaining head, the creature grabs the horse in the throat and begins tearing. Doris fires enraged shots, wildly destroying the remnants. Behind her, appearing from no where another night creature snatches the cross from around her neck, sending her tumbling to the ground. In the night beyond, lighting flashes illuminating a massive sillouette of the vampire Count Magnus Lee, of the house of Dracula. Doris has tresspassed, and he is there to claim the price...
Vampire Hunter D is an anime in which you care for all of the character's, even at times, the villain's. D is a vampire hunter that crosses path's with a young girl that has been bitten by Count Magnus Lee. Unless Lee is killed, then she too will be brought into the vampire race.
D is a dark movie. Extremely dark. So dark in fact that at times the only thing seperating the objects on the screen are the different SHADES of black. One thing you may notice or agree with, is the close similarity in music themes between this and A Nightmare on Elm Street. I haven't read if there was any inspiration from Elm, but its not likely.
This movie has many villains. It has the main villain, the sub villain (Ramika), the helper villains (Rei Ginsei), and the nagging hotshot villain (Greco). And not to mention all of those nasty ghouls, goblins, giants, and the three snake women.

One of my favorite moment's is a funny scene in which Doris' younger brother Dan tries to immitate the stone features of D. Trying to look cool. Really funny stuff. Then there is D's hand...I'll leave that one for you to discover.
The only problem I had with the disc itself, was that the movie was in full screen. Some of you may prefer it, I just don't. Then again full screen may be its original aspect ratio, I'm not sure. And, some may consider this a problem: The vocals do not stay within the designated center channel. I actually found it kind of fun to have all of the voices bounce around my speakers. If that's not a problem to you, or if you don't have the surround set-up, then you'll enjoy it.
D is a fun experience, and a good anime to get started on. When Anime catches on seriously in America, and I don't mean pokemon, digimon, etc... it would be neat if you already had some knowledge of anime before your friends catch on to it. Go ahead and get prepared. The day will come. ~s.a.o.s.~",1018742400,,2651,4.5

It blends so many things wonderfully.  It is set in the future where demons and vampires rule like lords in midevil times.  D is the main character and is a half-vampire half human who roams the land to kill vampires for a price. Unwanted by humans and shunned by vampires he lives a cold and hard life alone.  The majority of the movie takes place at night which gives it a dark under-tone.  D is by far one of the coolest characters in all anime, with his unchanging facial expressions and strong silent attitude.  Although his character isn't developed enough he is still very interesting. The animation is alright and the music is somewhat annoying, but you must remember it was made in 1985. It has some violence and a little bit of nudity, but over all it isn's too bad.  The story line is great and follows a somewhat not so predictable plotline.  The imagery is awesome, it is like the movie takes you to a different place and time.  D also has a face in his hand that gives him advice and provides some humor in the film.

It doesn't have much of a story but it goes along with a horror type story and does a good job at that. The movie is nearly always put into the night time through out almost the whole thing and the music is very good. It is a very good movie to watch at night time. The movie reminds me a little bit like PS2's Devil May Cry. Which is a good thing. The music really goes along with the type of movie it is.

A little known Romani legend tells the tale of the son of Dracula who was half human, and half vampire, vampirojenovic/lampirojenovic, son of the vampire, or Dhampir. Vampire hunter D takes that basic premise renames the Dhampir Dunpeal and goes from there. The movie itself is intriging, and dark, but the art work and animation could have been better, as it is nothing compared to the recent Vampire Hunter D sequel. Over all this movie is interesting, but nothing about it is scary, and D is a bit too distant to get emotionally attached to, although his hand more than makes up for D's lack of dialogue. This movie is one of the best animes ever created, and should be added to every DVD anime fan's collection.
It is lacking in specila features though, aside from a rather uninformative making of featurett there is nothing substantial here. The Tranfer is slightly better than the VHS version, but again nothing substanial, the sound is a lot better though, but still not as good as it could have been, however this disk is worth the purchase for the movie alone.",1017100800,,1167,4.810945273631841

 watching it again, however, was a monotonous experience. the plot--while promising--is ultimately flimsy, dull, and predictable. furthermore, the animation is pathetic. the movement and action is wooden and hundreds of frames are sorely lacking.
  i think most people like this movie because of the gore. hey, i like gore as much as the next person--but the lead up to the blood is boring: streaming backgrounds with still figures and other outdated, primitive animation techniques.
 furthermore, like lots of anime, the movie possesses lots of pointless nudity and scantily clad women: it's insultingly sexist. it was only worth watching for nostalgiac reasons.",1017014400,,870,5.470149253731344

Also, I wrote to correct the review by Mr. Strohmann Christian from Durango, Colorado USA, written on February 19, 2002.  His review is actually for Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, the movie that came out in 2001.  And the reason that DVD does not have an original audio track in Japanese is that the original audio track was actually done in English.

Because Urban Vision was involved with financing the film, it was decided to create an anime feature from the ground up for the American market.  So quit complaining about the lack of subtitles because THERE IS NO JAPANESE AUDIO TRACK!  The film played in Japan in English with Japanese subtitles!
The English voices are, typically, hit-and-miss.  The actual dialogue is creaky and obviously written by an amateur.  (At one point a character agrees with another THREE TIMES in a single speech -- ""Yeah.  That's right.  I agree with him on that point."" -- just so he'll be saying enough words to match the lip-flap.)

First off, the animation is just out of this world, it is leaps and bounds ahead of anything I've seen except maybe Ghost in the Shell.  It was just so crisp and clean.  Second, I have never seen a movie where the music just fit so perfectly.  I literally had goose bumps at some parts.  Third, the story is great.  Now like others have said it does have a few parts that you sorta have to quess on what's happened or how it's happening but it's nothing too major.  Fouth, The characters are just great and have real personaltiys and their not just cookie cutter.  Now on some of the other reviews people have said how they prefer the japanese voices and that they were dissapointed that they aren't in the movie.  Well guys I hate to break it to you but there aren't any japanese voices.  The voices for the characters were all done here in the states and the movie was never done in japanese that is why you can't have japanese dubbing.

The movie suffers from horrible timing though, and the scenes that are intended to be touching are all very over dramatic. Some of the artwork isn't so much BAD (though it is pretty bad) as it is poorly thought out.  D's cloak changes shape every time you see it, and the length of his sword and where he stores it pretty much ensure that he could never actually draw it.  Pretty much any time Rei Gansei draws his boomerang blade, you know something physically impossible is going to happen.  It's as if the artists and writers had an idea of what they wanted to convey, but no idea as to how to go about it.  And man oh man is it sappy. The sighing and fainting of Doris every two seconds makes you wonder how the heck she survided as long as she did in the wilderness.  Every time Dan opens his mouth, get ready for a lesson in ethics, complete with lecture and discussion among the group.  The final moments of the film are so sappy that you want to throw up.  Overall, I'd have to say that the sequel, Bloodlust, would be a much wiser purchase. It has way better art, that actually makes sense most of the time, and with the makers of Ninja Scroll and Wicked City behind it, the drama has been handled better as well.",1013385600,,1396,4.297709923664122

The film was one of the first true horror animated films for adults (mind you this came out before AKIRA so AKIRA was not the only great one to come out in the 80s) and it's as good as if it had been made into live action movie. The animation is amazing considering the time period and the screenplay is very layered. It makes a fairly subtle social commentery about social positions in terms of the ""common"" mixing with pure bloods which gives it an added depth which makes it even more compelling and makes it rise above the average anime film. The characters are all extremely well drawn. You can't help but feel empathy for Lamika, the Count's daughter. It has some great visuals in terms of the design of the demons and mosters and the design of landscapes and castles. The music is also great, very ominous, classical and heartfelt at times. This movie also creates a great anime superhero in D who deservedly had another movie created around him called VAMPIRE HUNTER D: BLOODLUST. Do not miss this movie.

1261542,2,B00003BDZY,"This is a truly classic Japanese anime film, deserving of the royal DVD treatment.  Unfortunately this DVD is NOT it.
The movie's plot is well documented here so I will not re-hash it.  And I agree with what is said in the reviews here.  The film is dark and moody, and filled with fantastic animation.  While it might be ""crude"" by the standards of today, one must remember that it is an old film and created on a limited budget.  The fight scenes are amazing, with the action being drawn out to create that illusion of slowing down time.  The movie is provocative, ominous and is just a lot of fun to watch.
This DVD however is not a lot fun to watch.  The transfer was lifted straight from the VHS.  It is neither wide-screen nor is it even a clear picture.  Blurry and dark, many scenes look like a black screen leaving you guessing as to what's happening.  You might think that finally getting to see the movie in its original Japanese language with English subtitles would be cool.  Until you find out the subtitles are written in blurry little white letters that give you a headache trying to read.  (Actually, it is cool seeing it in Japanese and it is pretty interesting the differences in the subtitles and the English Dialog, but the subtitles are VERY annoying.)
The extras are a cheap, short documentary about the ""making of"" Vampire Hunter D, some promotional materials and some stills.
If you MUST have this movie in your collection like I did then buy it.  Had it been re-mastered in wide-screen format it would have been a real treasure but the over-all bad quality of the DVD makes me wish I waited for a better edition, which I'm sure will be released shortly.",1008115200,3,1679,4.5198675496688745
1261581,4,B00003BDZY,"From the moment I saw buff guys with big weapons riding around in a modified tank, I knew this would be different from the original. The entire world seems to work on different principles (less gritty magic, more gritty machines), and it comes across quite clearly in this radically different anime style. Fans of the ""X"" feature will enjoy it, but others will wonder why so many heads look like triangles with *gasp* huge eyes.
But the thing that got me to watch the original was interesting violence, and you've got some here. Unicycle-riding midgets, werewolves with giant fangs in their abdomen, terminally ill patients shooting up to turn into psychic juggernauts, and the voice of Starscream! Some of this does seem like the product of a bad drug trip, but it is well-rendered and imaginative.
The parasitic (""but I've always been a good parasite,"") hand returns with a bit of sarcastic wit this time, providing the much-needed dialogue and exposition D is incapable of delivering. Still, D seems a bit loose-tongued in comparison to his last appearance in 1985. His voice is well casted (as a matter of opinion, most of these voices are great), but there are times when I sat up in the theatre puzzled, because D just wouldn't say this or that. Still, he delivers the righteous justice and unrelenting effort of any good, sword-wielding anime protagonist.
The protagonist complex of so many characters is interesting, because many come across as genuinely good main characters, almost competing for screen time. Some stories are intense enough to push D off altogether, but not for too long. He is never five minutes away from a fight scene. However, the antagonist complex of so many characters (everybody seems to hate everybody that they aren't sleeping with or being paid millions to save) gets a little thin. Carmilla, who could be considered the principle villainess, doesn't even get mentioned in the first sixty minutes of the movie.
All in all, there are compelling, intertwining motivations, and enough eye candy to keep the average fan of anime through a sitting, but the ending is cliche (aren't all the best ones?), and other than to catch a few fight scenes over again, I didn't see much rewatch value.

1261583,4,B00003BDZY,"When I first saw ""Vampire Hunter D"", I thought it was a pretty good movie. But afterwards, I reflected upon it and realized that although it's definately a classic, it isn't much of a keeper.
To judge the quality of the animation of ""Vampire Hunter D"" to the newer movie, ""Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust"", would be unfair. It's like comparing ""Macross Plus"" to ""Robotech"". ""Vampire Hunter D"" accomplishes what it needs to despite it rough textures and sometimes choppy animation. Some of the scenes were a little odd in how they were executed, and sometimes movements felt static and stiff. Still, the film's blandness seems to add to the gothic feel of the movie, and it's difficult to imagine D looking any other way (until you've seen ""Bloodlust"", that is).
There is some nudity in the film, and although it does feel a little out of place and gratuitous, it doesn't take attention away from the actual story. The violence found in the film does feel a little stiff because of the colors and textures, but it's still gut-wrenching enough to label ""Vampire Hunter D"" as a mature film.
There are a few things that hinder this film from being an absolute must-have. The plot, while inventive, falls in several areas thanks to a few minute plot holes. Characterization is good, but hindered from some average English voice acting. And the supposed love story between D and the girl he's trying to save is...unbelievable, at best.
Despite this, however, any anime fan has to see ""Vampire Hunter D"" at least once. Most likely, only die-hard fans would want to keep this movie close to their hearts while casual anime fans will only marvel at it once before looking for something else.",1007337600,2,1678,4.769759450171821

There was hardly anything 3D and cinematic about it at all, definitely nothing close to Akira or Ghost in the Shell.  The first third of it was entertaining, but I expected a much darker, more advanced animation style, especially considering how they were supposed to be using state of the art computers for it.  It appears they used the computers simply for speeding up the animation and layering the sprites.  The biggest problem I had with the new D film was the lack of game rules on how the vampires can be killed.  By the end, the same entities keep coming back to life, seemingly at the whim of the film's creators.  Without rules, a film becomes a pointless exercise.

The story takes place in a distant future where now dying race of vampires is trying to survive the hunters who hunt them for huge bounties.  D is a human/vampire hybrid.  He doesn't belong to either world and is trying to rid the world of Vampires.  For a fee of 20 million he sets out on a hunt to catch a vampire who kidnapped a daughter of a rich man.  But this time he has competition, a team of the best human hunters are working on the same mission.
Original English language really makes this anime pleasant to watch, as opposed to horrible dubs that US likes to make.  Character voices were well chosen.
Animation is par excellence.  Beautiful backgrounds in high detail,  very detailed character animation.  Easily beats any disney animation on character detailing.  Very well integrated musical scores really set the mood for this anime.  And an interesting story seals the deal.

1261634,4,B00003BDZY,"I will admit, it's not ""Ghost in the Shell,"" or ""Princess Mononoke."" And yes, it's differs from the first film. Less sword fights, more romance. But in its own rights, it's a good film.
The story is complex and bring you many relatable characters. D is as cool and sleek as he ever was. Getting glimps into the motivations of other characters also help the plot and keeps the audience involved. Okay, the plot and the dialogue tends toward mellow drama. The English dubbing seems to exagerate it. You have to keep in mind that the movie was made for a Japanese audience, whose taste runs different from Americans. By the look of most animes, Japanese have a healthy appreciation for mellow drama.
Now the art work, GEORGEOUS! The animation employs both computer and traditional cell techniques. The blend of the two is seemless. Character design recalls those of ""girly romance serials"" such as ""Candy"" or even ""Sailor Moon."" Impossibly large eyes, lots of long flowing hair, sharp facial features, lush detailed decorations, in dark tones however instead of pastels. This works well in this instance, as the underlying theme is love and adds the element of romance to the dark gothic base of the film. The scene construction is as dynamic as film gets. The ""camera"" moves through the scene, weaving in and out, taking the audience along into the film.

  Amazing.  I am a true believer that the original is always the best, but this blew the original right out of the water.  The art form, the story (which was great because, I was wondering where the bloodlust was coming from, and when that was revealed the true nature of the story came in).

I'm not going to just give it a good score simply because of high hopes and respect for its predecessor. D didn't deliver the sword battles that can be found in Samurai X. The artwork wasn't sinister or gothic compared with Blood - The Last Vampire. The characters weren't nearly as well developed as those found in Ninja Scroll. After the dust settles and the hype moves on to a new movie, Bloodlust will be far removed from the status of ""an anime classic"" reserved for the likes of Akira and Ghost in the Shell.

After Akira took American anime audiences by storm, they wanted more. That's where Vampire Hunter D entered the picture, with the right amount of sexiness, violence and humour, this movie held it's own, and was really popular.
 Watching it for the first time, 14 years after it's release, I was not dissapointed. My favourite character is the hero's talking hand. I want one of them for christmas..

 Anyone who enjoys gorey slasher type flicks, and is a fan of Anime will enjoy this one. I recommend Blood to you, if you just like gorey stuff with an electirc atmosphere, but if you would like a good story line, this movie is for you.
 A girl's life is in jeopardy, after being bitten by a vampire. A vampire who's taken a liking to her. The only solution involves the death of the vampire. Enter Mr. D, the vampire hunter. Dissapointingly enough, he doesn't talk a lot at the beginning of the movie, which is a shame, because he has a rather cool voice. However it does add to the mystery surrounding him.

Animation: This movie uses an animation style I haven't seen before, and it fits perfectly with the dark, gothic storyline. The colors are rich and the motions are fluid. The scenes are also extremely full, no minimalism here.
Sound: The musical score fits right in with the movie and the ""dub"" is excellent. That's probably because this *isn't* a dub. This movie's orignal language actually is English.
Storyline (a few spoilers): This isn't your usual good-vs.-evil romp, here. It has a much more ambiguous moral compass than most movies. And it is much better for it. It is really a story about hope, love, and the way people treat (and mistreat) each other.

1261684,5,B00003BDZY,"Vampire Hunter D is one of my all time favorites and I was accustomed to listening to the American translation of this film before I bought the dvd version with the Japanese translation. The original Japanese audio gives a few more interesting features to this story.

NUMBER 1)  In the U.S. audio Count Lee sits on his throne talking to himself in a misty room seeming to telepathically know that Lameeka and Ray Ginsay failed to kill D. But in the Japanese audio the mist in the room turns out to be some sort of an entity that the Count speaks to and the mist actually told him about Lameeka's and Ray Ginsay's failure.

NUMBER 2)  In the U.S. version Ray Ginsay seems to be a very selfish character wanting to kill the Count for the sole purpose of having the Count's power. But in the Japanese translation it is shown that his reasons for killing the Count isn't totally selfish but partly an act of revenge for the death of his colleages that lost their lives trying to kill D for the Count. He isn't as bad as the U.S. version makes him out to be but actually is a bit moral.( Notice also he saved Doris' brother from falling to his death. It makes more sense.)

NUMBER 3) In the U.S. audio , in the scene where Ray Ginsay accidentally killed Gimlet (the thin man with the blades on his feet) he doesn't seem to care what so ever that he killed Gimlet but instead is soley conscerned that D got away. In the Japanese audio you get a sense that there seemed to have been more regret toward his accidental killing of Gimlet. So when the Count kills Ray Ginsay you feel kind of saddened by his death because he is depicted as being a more moral character than in the U.S. translation.

NUMBER 4)  In the U.S.translation , Doris tells the town officials that if D fails to kill the vampires she would leave town and never come back and her brother strongly stands beside her but then in the next scene we see her brother crying seemingly from fear of leaving town and being shunned by people. But in the Japanese audio Doris doesn't say that she would leave but she says she would KILL HERSELF if D failed and her brother responded in shock to what she said. So when we see him crying he is crying from the sadness of possibly losing his sister forever.

Why they took these aspects of the story out of the U.S. translation I don't know but they actually seem to give some of the characters a deeper dynamic making the viewer enjoy this film even more than we already do. So get the special edition dvd of VAMPIRE HUNTER D with english and japanese audio and see for yourself. It brings a new light to this already classic anime.",1001635200,4,2632,4.335365853658536

1261686,5,B00003BDZY,"I first saw <i>Vampire Hunter D</i> one random Saturday evening on TV in 1995 and loved it. I couldn't believe that I was actually getting to see an anime flick on `mainstream' television; it was the coolest feeling, and the best feature-length anime film that I had ever been exposed to at the time. In addition to the action, adventure, mystery and suspense in the film, I especially enjoyed the themes of mixed-race heritage that this film explored. I had never witnessed a work of animation that so intriguingly dealt with the societal complexities of being biracial.
D (the main character) was `vampeel', meaning he was half-human, and half-vampire. D's dual racial heritage allowed him to function in daylight, while retaining the supernatural powers that full-blooded vampires enjoy; in other words, 'vampeels' like D enjoy the best of both worlds. However, it is D's constant inner-battle between his vampire and human sides that force him to stay away from humans (to avoid temptation) and to battle evil by slaying vampires. D is a lonely figure.
The vampires in the film are cast as an evil, yet noble race in a twisted sense. Count Magnus Lee (the supreme villain) is a gray-haired, `Blake-Carrington-from-Dynasty-type' vampire who is supremely powerful. His daughter Ramika is a spoiled, pretty being who thinks she's a full-blooded vampire, and is proud of it. Lee's deadly foot soldier Reiginsei (and I mean deadly) longs to become a vampire in order to attain a status of nobility in his own right.
Doris is a human who has become Count Magnus Lee's object of affection to the endless disgust of Ramika who feels humans as mere mortals are beneath vampire nobility. Doris hires D to help her defeat Magnus. The battle that ensues between D, Magnus, Reiginsei, and others is utterly engaging. Vampire Hunter D makes for a great story indeed.
Now it is 2001, and a sequel to the original <i>Vampire Hunter D</i> entitled <i>Bloodlust</i> has been finally scheduled for release this fall. I highly suggest you see this film for the first time, or reacquaint yourself with it now. As far as `Bloodlust' is concerned, well...see you at the theatres!

Lined with some beautifully crafted imagery and animation, ( Not to mention some scenes with incredibly intense violence) this film is a treat for all the senses. Even though the style and film techniques seem somewhat dated (1985 picture), it is still worth the viewing for anyone interested in a good action packed gothic thriller. The plot is somewhat simple. In the far future, humans are reduced back to a menial feudal system in which vampires become the ruling class, and subject the humans as slaves. One of the local girls in a village, Doris becomes targeted by Count Magnus Lee, the local ruling vampire. In distress she hires a vampire hunter known only as ""D"", to protect her. Graphic, but visually stunning film. Not recomended for children, but use viewer discretion.",999302400,5,957,4.91358024691358

Although the animation looks a little dated nowadays, you can't really fault the skill that went into the drawings and it's never looked better than on this DVD release. I won't go into detail about the story, save to say it's relativley straight forward hero stuff, but is nicely handled, with some cool, original ideas. There's plenty of action to keep you interested and the music is also excellent. The voice acting is, as always, great on the original japanese track and lousy if you choose to watch in english. If you've already seen the dub and thought it was okay, you might like the original version a lot better - I did. Infact, I like it more each time I watch it. The extra features barely justify the 'special edition' tag, but even so, the 'making of' documentary was highly interesting and the modesty of the director was really amazing.",998697600,5,879,4.641025641025641

1261738,4,B00003BDZY,"If you want the quickest possible idea of what this movie is like, think ""Castlevania: Symphony of the Night; the movie"" except with some characters changed around. Still, obvious draws can be made, as the game has several parts that pay obvious homage to this movie.
For those who haven't played Castlevania (and Good Lord why not!?) you can expect a ""classic"" anime film about vampires in the far, far future (think 12,000 AD or so). Vampires have returned and have ruled the world for several thousand years. Humanity has been kept in an almost medieval state by the vampires, with the occasional odd bit of technology (cyborg horses, laser rifles, etc.) showing up amidst the antiquity of the rest of the film.
The plot is fairly basic damsel in distress kind of stuff, and while the ending is a surprise, it's not exactly a shocker. What makes this movie is simply the way it is presented. The artwork is quite good, there's violence and blood enough to show Mortal Kombat how it's REALLY done, and the weird synergy of old world and dead furture ties together so well that you almost wish the movie would go into the plot of how the world came to be like this a bit more than it actually does. Despite this, it makes an excellent backdrop. It's unique and creative, and not a little weird. If this doesn't sound like something you'd like, however, it's not going to surprise you and turn out to be something you love, so don't bother. For those looking for some creative storytelling and a decent action anime, look no further.

It was a birthday gift from  one of my friends and I hadn't watched it yet.  It had been about 3 days.  Later, I did some research into it and found it inspired the classic game saga ""CastleVania"".

1261855,4,B00003BDZY,"First off, if you have allready seen the original movie produced by Streamline back in the early 90s, there is no reason to buy this. However, if you haven't seen it yet, then this is your last chance to get it on tape. The dub version kind of chops up some of the many elements of Vampire Hunter D. For instance, the music prolonged in the dubbed version which ruins the mood of several seens. The dubbed voices of the monsters are horribly done and can't match up to the creepiness of the Japanese version. So if you intend on seeing the movie, spend the extra cash and get the subtitled version. Now lets talk about the film:
The movie takes place in 12090 AD. Werewolfs, mutants and vampire roam the world. Doris, is a farmer, is a victim of the vampire Count Magnis Lee. She asks for thr help of a vampire hunter named D. D prooves to be quite a love for Doris and a mentor to her brother, Dan. Magnis Lee wants to have Doris as his wife to plessure himself, but wants D out of the way. So he sends out Ray (a muntant/vampire hunter who wants to be accepted into the Lee family), Ramica (Magnis' daughter) and a bunch of other creppy villains. D reveals later on that he is a dampiel (half vampire, half human) and that his father is none other than Count Dracula (hence the name D). What unfolds is a story of love, violents, betrayal and history of vampires. A good old fasion movie about horror filled creatures. A great film.",979344000,,1434,4.314814814814815

A trailer of the new movie coming out (It looks terrific). A trailer of the video game (personally, the game is really terrible). There is also a moving picture gallery. The movie was in Dolby 5.1, but I was surprised to see that it wasn't even digitally remastered for the picture. Oh well. It still didn't ruin the movie for me. There are about 15 chapter stops, which for a movie, is pretty short, which means that a lot of stuff can happen in scene. Anyway, if you haven't seen the movie (I didn't see it till I bought the DVD) you have to see it on DVD. And don't be afraid to try out the original Japanese language. It's actually better than the English. So watch it and be amazed at the gorey and bizzare world of 16000 AD. It's addictive.",977788800,,1034,4.3076923076923075

1261922,2,B00003BDZY,"From all the rave reviews I've read about this movie, I was expecting a lot better.  I was envisioning this wicked vampire hunter wading through legions of lesser vampires to get at the count.  I was expecting a huge body count and rivers of blood.  What I got was D, who was definitely well designed, fighting a bunch of freaky mutants.  What's that all about?  He's a vampire hunter, not a mutant hunter.  You would think that a vampire aristocrat would have vampire bodyguards.
There are other small complaints that I have:  1)  When did the vampire hunter ever introduce himself as D?  I didn't see it, but, all of a sudden, everyone's calling him D.  2)  Why does the little boy call him brother?  I didn't get it.  3)  They didn't explain the world very well...if it wasn't for the blurb on the box, I wouldn't have known that vampires had taken over the world after a war.  4)  Was the dialogue really cheesy as it was written or was it just bad translation for the subtitles?
Finally, the animation seemed very mediocre.  The effects were kind of lame (especially lines representing wind and the close ups of people when they're on their horses...they should be swaying, but it's like they're sitting in a chair in their living room).  After seeing animation in such films as NINJA SCROLL and GHOST IN THE SHELL, I think this movie could have been much better animation-wise.  As a tangent to the production of the movie, I think the music that they selected was pretty inappropriate...it should have been dark and brooding, but it reminded me of music from RANMA 1/2.
Despite its shortcomings, the story was pretty interesting and the characters were all well designed.

The storyline is simple and the animation is decent.  So  what makes this such a good movie, you ask?  A powerful confliction of good  and evil is shown through D.  The storyline is pretty basic when considered  alone, but in this movie it is used as a tool for portraying this  confliction.  Upon close observation, many things in this movie that seem  to be just pointless or trivial in fact contribute to the theme more.  Also, I personally became intrigued by the question the movie seems to pose  of who D actually is (watch closely, as the obvious answer subsequent to  the viewing of this movie is contradicted within the movie by a few  quotes).

This is a classic, at its time, this had to be one of the best, and now everyone is spoiled by great anime such as evangelion and kenshin where the animation is amazing, and colors, and shading are perfect... you can't hold the animation against it... it still stands alone without it, and it was an outstanding dub...  no stupid slang terms, or ghetto talk used... thank god..",967075200,,728,4.313868613138686

In the far future, man has become disparate and are under the control of Vampires.  It  is a world of werewolves and other strange creatures.
The local Baron is  Count Magnus Lee and he has become enamored with a resident.  He is bored  and needs a little action.  While having bitten the young woman, he sends  her home, until the night he will marry her.  Instead of accepting her  fate, she hires a vampire hunter named D, who is a half vampire decendent  of Count Dracula himself.
The animation is weak, almost at the Ralph  Bakshi level and the dubbing is poor.  The characters are static and the  action is fairly lame.  It is gory but the movie is so weak that without  the blood, the movie would have been a complete waste of time.

True, the drawing may need some work but it works just  right!  Afterall it was made in the 80's and D still looks like a major  BABE!  The plot is soooo great, PERFECT for a vampire movie and the  characters are soooo right due to great character development!  I must  admit that at first I wasn't too sure about Vampire Hunter D when I first  saw it due to uneeded violence...I mean, I like action and bloodshed anime,  but they really had some graphic stuff that seemed like it was just stuffed  in their for no reason at all but WOOOOWEEEE!  When I actually paid  attention to it and it's magnificent unique story line, it became my #1!  IT'S THE BEST!  So if your in for a super cool vampire anime plot and  GREAT character development,(even D's talking hand) Then This Is A MUST  ABSOLUTELY HAVE!

The voices are well-dubbed, the violence is well  orchastrated, and the story is pretty cool. Admittingly the animation  itself is very ""Speed-Racer"" like, and a little choppy. If you  watch more for the impressive graphics... this isn't for you... but if you  like a dark, violent, sword-fighting hero, you're going to love Vampire  Hunter D!

1261962,5,B00003BDZY,"Let me preface this by saying that this is a review srictly for the subtitled version.  Although Vampire Hunter D was made in the early 80's, it never gets old.  The animation is smooth and fluid. It is truly some of  the best artwork in anime history.  The original Japanese voice acting is  exellent, and the muscial score meshes perfectly with the story to draw you  into the movie's futuristic world of medievel horror.  Now on to the most  important thing, the story.  In the future, mankind is under the feudal  rule of arisocrates A.K.A. vampires.  When a young girl, named Doris, is  bitten by the vampire Count Magnus Lee, she hires a Vampire hunter called  ""D"" to destroy the Lee aristocracy and prevent her marrage to the  Count.  There are several other really great characters, as well as a few  twists in the story's wonderfully dark plot.  However, I don't want to give  anything away, so I'll let you discover them for yourself.  As I noted in  the beggining of this review, this is for the subtitled version only. As an  otoku(i.e. a die hard anime buff), I would recomend the subtitled version  over english dubbing.  It really is worth the extra money!

She wishes to protect the town from the onslaught of Count Magnus Lee and his army of demons and vampires. What  makes vampire hunter'D' so notable is its use of characterisation which  makes the whole anime that much more enjoyable. For example the Count is  not just another mindless enemy but one who is reflective and intelligent.  The animation has suffered in recent years as the title is now over ten  years old. This does not matter, because the plot is well scripted and the  pace and music fit the film perfectly. The dubbing is fair and the overall  quality of the film is very high. This is thoroughly recommended if you  enjoy horror, science fiction or action anime. Even so it should be enjoyed  by all fans of anime. A word of warning though. The bloodshed reaches new  hights of gore and extremity which is rarely matched even in today's anime  world.

1262089,5,B00003BDZY,"First off, this is a CLASSIC MOVIE, its animation is not THE BEST, i.e. if you compare it to the cream of the crop in the animation world, and I wouldn't expect it to be, infact I would dearly hope so, since this movie  is like more than a DECADE OLD, i.e. this is a classic, in the sense that  it is one of the animes that started it all. Vampire hunter D was the movie  that started me on anime and for good reason. It showed me the  possibilities that anime presented, that american movies couldn't  supply.
First off, if you check your local vampire section for decent  movies, you'll come up with one, and that one is Interview with a Vampire.  You may also find something called ""Kindred"" which is a  television series and expands on vampires, but it doesn't do it on their  myths, like Vampire Hunter D does. Vampire Hunter D, since it is an anime,  is able to paint a picture of a world in Torment, making it theasable that  this could truly be a world, where goblins, vampires, and werewolves could  thrive and do.
NOW THE STORY The story basicaly starts off with a girl  Getting bit by the head vampire that lives in a castle just outside of the  village. Next, we see a shot of D(formaly known as Vampire Hunter D, and by  the end of the movie, you'll know what D stands for even if you only know  just a little bit about vampires, but if you don't...oh boy) on his robotic  horse. For this story is not based in the past, but in the distant future.  Some how, the girl peeks D's interest about vampires, being that she was  bitten and he has a vengance to kill them, though not all of them...
It  also seems that D has a certain curse/gift, that we know not where, how, or  why he has it. But this movie does keep you interested. Plot, yes, but  being this is a monster movie, it has done splendidly well. A notch done  from Interview with a Vampire, but a definite notch or two up from anything  else out there.
THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER If you are still  heasitant about buying this video, send me an email, and I'll tell you more  about the story, I was keeping most of it out, since its terrible to ruin  it for those who haven't seen it yet, but if thats what it takes to  convince you I will. I have probably seen this movie 3-5 times. D is such a  cool character, since he is so gothic(we ain't talkin about spikes), a  gentleman, and... he's the kinda person you wish your son would grow up  like, swaping the vampire hunting with a good job. That reminds me, his  whole suit of clothes fit him perfectly, actually everyone is made  perfectly, I love it.
FINALLY You will be starving for more and curious  about unanswered questions, well here's something to know, unless  somethings been changed without my knowledge, they are making a second  vampire hunter d!",947980800,2,2795,4.317919075144508

Originally released in 1985, and re-released in 2000.
In the  year 12,090 AD, the Earth has fallen into the clutches of ruthless vampires  and humans are enslaved by a corrupted feudal system, prey to a mockery of  freedom and justice. Only one being has dared to challenge the cruel  authority of these vicious, arrogant immortals - the mysterious vampire  hunter called ""D"".
A beautiful young villager, Doris, has been  targeted by Count Magnus Lee and his clan for the harsh doom of belonging  to the Count. In desperation, Doris promises herself to the enigmatic  hunter in exchange for the extermination of these tyrannical monsters.  Before ""D"" can execute his plans, the Count abducts Doris,  forcing ""D"" to forge through hordes of demons and unholy fiends  to rescue Doris from the bloody reign of the House of Lee.
Cult classic  by any standard. Sophisticated blend of horror and futuristic science  fiction. The bizarre imagery and exotic characters help to fully realize  the tone of the film, confirming its status as an exceptional work of  animation.

The story is about a vampire hunter, D, who comes to a village to  save a young woman from the clutches of the evil vampire lord. In the  process D gets a chance to settle a few old scores.
