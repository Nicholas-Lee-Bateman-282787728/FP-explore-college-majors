8639557,5,B00I60VY56,"As a teen growing up in Phoenix, Arizona, Queen was one of the phenomenal bands who dominated the airwaves and stereos across the Valley of the Sun.  Their amazing creativity and blend of classical influences with solid rock and roll (with just a tad of flamboyance thrown in just to make it interesting), made Queen the stand out band of the seventies.

While we have lost Freddie Mercury, the remaining members of the band are still alive, still creating, still innovating.  This is especially true for the bands iconic guitarist, Brian May, who, along with the lovely and talented, Kerry Ellis, have teamed together to release The Candlelight Concerts  Live At Montreux 2013 as a DVD + CD set and Blu-ray + CD.

This package offers up a treasure trove of covers classic songs that include, We Will Rock You, Born Free, The Way We Were, Crazy Little Thing Called Love, Tie Your Mother Down, and I Who Have Nothing

The DVD was filmed at the Stravinski Auditorium during the 2013 Montreux Jazz Festival. The Candlelight Concerts  Live At Montreux 2013 masterfully melds  Ellis beautiful voice with the amazing guitar playing of May. The film is of primarily acoustic performance sof standards, ballads, Queen songs and cover songs.  Brians guitar style flawlessly compliments Kerry vocals, giving a different life and interpretation to these timeless songs.

The Acoustic By Candlelight CD, recorded live during the UK portion of their tour in Autumn 2012.  The songs benefit from introductions by both Ellis and May that share background and influences of certain songs before they perform them.  While some may not like the banter, I believe that it adds to the intimacy of the performances and give insight into the music that influenced these gifted artists.

There are two songs on the CD (Im Not That Girl, I Cant Be Your Friend, and In The Bleak Midwinter) that aren't on the DVD. There are also some songs on the DVD that aren't on the CD (Somebody To Love, 39, Last Horizon, We Will Rock You).  From what I can discern, the songs shared on both discs are different performances thus making both discs uniquely entertaining.  In both cases, the listener/viewer is treated to what can only be said to be a truly amazing musical experience.

What is especially moving (and THE Boomerocity favorite) is the bonus performance on the DVD of Nothing Really Has Changed.  It was recorded on location at the Shamwari Game Reserve in Eastern Cape, South Africa.  It was performed for the person who actually wrote the song thirty-two years ago, Virginia McKenna, who also happens to be the founder of Born Free.  Brian shares more of the story behind the song on the DVD and is worth the price of the package just to hear it.

If you're a Queen fan hoping for some royal rockin, this isn't one of those kinds of offerings.  But, please, don't rob yourself of an incredible musical experience that will broaden your listening palate just like Queen began to do over forty years ago.

Some things never change.

8639559,5,B00I60VY56,"I do not particulary like music played by one instrument only, i rather like multi instruments music, be it rock, jazz, new age or whatever. So I order this BD with some aprehension, I actually erased it from my cart more than six times!! But after listening to this concert all I can say is Waoooo! Great music, great voices, great performance captured in very nice audio and video.
A concert to sit down with a cup of good wine and enjoy with your lights out.",1399420800,,461,4.372093023255814
