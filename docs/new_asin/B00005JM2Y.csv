1480924,5,B00005JM2Y,"A very enjoyable movie. Great fun, nice look into the football crazy world of the UK. We saw this in the middle of World Cup fever in the UK in the summer of 2002, might have added a bit to the fun. Look forward to seeing the movie in the US this spring. Tried to buy the DVD from amazon.uk.co, but alas it is Region 2 encoded.

1480925,4,B00005JM2Y,"A hilarious film.  My family laughed and laughed.  Titled for David Beckham with just enough soccer to satisfy soccer fans, but not too much to bore the non-soccer crowd.  There is a very funny scene involving older relatives of the main character -- a pre-wedding get together where everyone is dressed in traditional clothing yet when a cell phone rings during the party EVERYONE, including the grandmothers, thinks it is their cell phone ringing.  The main character's family is conflicted between traditional versus modern life.  One sister choosing the traditional and the other choosing a different path.  A very entertaining movie.  Can't wait to see it again once it opens in the U.S. in April 2003.",1037664000,5,707,5.043103448275862
1480926,5,B00005JM2Y,"Saw this when I was in the uk, and what a laugh it was!!...I think it is for all audiences, but being east indian you understand more, as well as knowing who beckham, lineker etc are.

1480988,3,B00005JM2Y,"I saw this movie years ago and loved it.  This time on seeing it with my kids, I realized there was a bit of locker room discussion that was awkward to watch with young boys (I had thought they'd like the soccer theme).  I was also uncomfortable with how the mothers are horrified at the idea that their daughter might be gay.  The basic story line about a girl pursuing her dream to play soccer and friendship was still good.",1506038400,,426,4.3

1480991,3,B00005JM2Y,"After all these years and out of boredom, I watched this recently on HBO for the first time. It wasn't anything spectacular but a nice little family movie. I found the soccer scenes more intriguing than the scenes about Jess' family. The parts about her family moved kinda slow but still humorous. One thing I didn't understand was the romance between Jess and Jo. It made no sense and came out of nowhere. Neither of them seemed attracted to each other until they danced at that club. Before then Jo found Jess annoying and she didn't seem to pay him much attention. Every story doesn't need a romantic angle and this is one of them. Jess and Jo had no chemistry and the film didn't dig enough into why they liked each other for the romance to be interesting or believable. Maybe this was thrown in to get the teenage girls swooning but it messed up the flow of the movie and wasn't necessary. Overall, a decent family film but nothing to go crazy about.",1501027200,,955,4.462857142857143
1480992,5,B00005JM2Y,"It may seem cliched, but I think all girls should see this. Just to be reminded of how far we've come and how far yet we can go. I'm not trying to make a political statement, but this movie wears its heart on its sleeve and it's beautiful. I love the story and the characters and the athleticism. Healthy is happy and happy is beautiful, too. The story is light, the acting is unforced and Jonathan Rhys Meyers is just coming into his own. This is an older movie that doesn't feel dated or forced.",1498953600,,497,4.242105263157895

1481425,4,B00005JM2Y,"I really like this film.

Jess/ Parminder Nagra makes good grades, but what she really loves is soccer.  She gets the opportunity to join an all-girl's soccer league, but she hesitates, which leads to my least favorite scene.  I loathed that it marred the whole film for me.  For Jess was not strong.  She could be broken down.  At the slightest provocation, because I could not see her as a hero.  Keeping out from what she loved because of a few scars, then confiding to a totally unsympathetic being, and then a few racial slurs.  Grow up.  You are a hero to no one, so though I liked Jess, admired her even, I had no faith in her.

The real star is Keira Knightly as Juliette ""Jules"" Paxton, whose beauty cannot be hidden.  She is utterly fearless.  She also has a discouraging parent, her mother, the completely ignorant and deliciously comedic, Juliet Stevenson as Paula Paxton.  Paula Paxton wears big hats to her daughter's meets, and she thinks her daughter is miserable for all the wrong reasons.

I love the energy of this film.  There is high energy, and I love when there are meets in other countries, and Jess plays well.  There is so much camaraderie, sportsmanship, and passion, and I loved that as well.

This film is great.  The faults are the whole beans and toast scene, and Jess's father's rhetoric.  Jess's lack of spirit is also a massive bummer.  Her reactions to wounds on her legs and racism shows she has no spirit.  Sorry but I just loathe a gimmick.  Too convenient, too Hollywood, and too corny.  It made her weak.

There is a reason why Keira Knightly became a star.  Because she was fearless.  The producers, directors, writers etc., did a service to Parminder Nagra.",1441497600,,1699,4.59866220735786

Anyhow, Bend It like Beckham is a feature about a female named Jesminder Jess Kaur Bhamra (Parminder Nagra)who has a strong passion for playing soccer. The problem with her hobby is that her parents, especially her father, are still adjusting to what she wants in life versus what they want for her. Jess loves her family, but is trying to come to terms with reconciling her dreams with keeping a strong connection with her family members. Some pop culture references; The character of Jess is shown admiring a picture of famous soccer player David Beckham (also known as husband to Spice Girl alum/fashion designer Victoria Beckham) and snippets of the song Inner Smile by Texas feature in Bend It Like Beckham. Two of the characters that Jess meets through her soccer playing Juliette Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley) and Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) dramatically change her life in different ways and are both important to her growth in some way.",1436918400,,1159,4.918367346938775

1481483,4,B00005JM2Y,"This 2002 film is about an Indian Sikh girl, Jess, who wants to play football (soccer in America) for a London girls' team (Hounslow Harriers). With Jules (Keira Knightley), they play for the same team. Jess' sister is getting married and the tournament falls on the same day. What's a girl to do?

The film has a great cast featuring Juliet Stevenson CBE as Jules' worried mother and Archie Panjabi as Jess' sister. There are newcomers who never made a film but did well in their first film.

The film has comedy and drama. The film relates to everyone about dreams and obstacles. The film was filmed in location throughout London and Hamburg, Germany.

The director did a terrific job in bringing the story to life. It's a feel good film with a happy ending.

The DVD features two notable features such as the making of it featureette and a cooking lesson with the film director.",1436486400,,881,4.628205128205129

1481595,1,B00005JM2Y,"The premise was intriguing, if trite. Girl wants to play soccer, traditional family refuses, girl runs off and does it anyway. Unfortunately, the execution was mediocre and we only saw part of the movie.

The very beginning was amusing. We see a televised soccer match with David Beckham on the team, there is trouble getting the ball through, and suddenly a female player gets the ball and scores an unlikely goal, to the world's adulation. Well, except for when several sports commentators talk to the girl's mother, who is critical of her being in the soccer game in the first place and showing her legs to thousands of people. It was the girl's imagination, of course-and real life intrudes when she is called down to deal with preparing for her sister's upcoming wedding.

Unfortunately, then comes a bunch of shouting back and forth, clichd and not well-acted. A standard clash of Indian and English cultures, and it quickly got tedious, so we gave the rest a miss. The idea could have been done much better.",1428451200,,1014,4.788571428571428

The problem is that their parents are not so keen on it, with the exception of Jules' father, who is ""over the moon"" that she's more interested in sports than boys at her age.

A wonderful coming of age movie with two good characters who work their way through plenty of problems in quest of their dream.  It is different and fresh in many ways, has a number of story lines that weave together nicely, enjoys a good cast and is always a pleasure for me to watch, especially when I've just tried to break in a new bunch of movies which I don't like so much and need to go to familiar ground that never lets me down.",1427241600,,891,4.285714285714286

Keira Knightley (and the actors who play her parents, whose names I am ashamed to say I can't recall at this moment) is fabulous as the main character's best friend/soccer-mate, and Archie Punjabi (The Good Wife) is completely perfect as the older sister. The hectic preparations for her impending marriage is domestic comedy that literally makes you laugh out loud. I love EVERYTHING about this movie!

My only negative issue in this film was the cheesy, ""locker room"" scenes. Seemed very out of place in this girl positive film. Felt kind of creepy, peeping Tom-ish and absolutely not necessary in this film but other than that great flick.

Plot wise, story of two young women (teens) who play football and would like to one day go to play professionally. Both of them of have separate family, personal and cultural obstacles to get over to see their dream through.

One a white European, Jules, and the other an Indian girl, Jess. Jules, already on a soccer team,had a mother who disapproved of playing the sport, she wanted a girly girl, but she didn't let that stop her. Jess had the same problem about her mother's view of the sport and girls playing it. Jess loved soccer and wanted more than anything to be on a team like her idol, David Beckham. She played everyday in the park with her Indian friends, which were men, and when her mother saw her she refused that Jess play anymore with these guys. Being Indian she felt that women should not show skin the way Jess did when she wore short sleeve shirts and shorts and NO man should ever touch a woman unless married. While playing the park Jules saw Jess playing and offered her to come try-out for a team! This was everything Jess had dreamed of, a real girls soccer team! Jess made the team and she kept it from her family. When her family found out of this her sister's marriage was almost cancelled because the Indian other of the groom felt the same way her own mother felt. Jess and her dreams really broke her family's heart and caused a lot of problems within the household. This movie had a pretty predictable ending but I won't spill it!

1482329,5,B00005JM2Y,"There isn't anything new here, like at all, but that doesn't matter.  The film is so cute and fun and just downright enjoyable.  Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra spar off one another brilliantly and create such cheekily likable characters in Juliet and Jess.  The film centers around a young Indian girl born in England.  She dreams of being a soccer player like David Beckham, a man she worships.  Her family is vocally opposed, forbidding her to play.  They want her to marry a nice Indian man and continue in the ways of their family traditions.  Much like many other films dealing with this concept, Jess will lie and hide her `real life' (here by joining the female soccer team and falling into a love triangle between her, Juliet and their coach, Joe) from her folks until it all comes spilling out and her family is forced to accept that change is necessary in order to `keep' their daughter.  Despite the fact that no new territory is broached here, the dialog is sharp, the performances are fun and the end result is a greatly entertaining sports movie that bursts at the seams with `girl power' in a dignified and exciting way.",1316390400,,1140,4.665
1482330,5,B00005JM2Y,"I simply cannot understand any of the negative reviews here. I thought this was a wonderful, enjoyable movie, the subtext being how difficult it is to accommodate traditional practices in a modern western society. In this instance, it's subcontinent Indian culture in England, but a change in costume and the like and you could be seeing the Hasidim in New York, or the Italians or Greeks anywhere in America, &c. The Indian girl thought it would break her parents heart if she showed up with a goreh - a gaijin in Japanese, a goy in Yiddish, a gringo . . .

The casting was ideal, the soccer scenes were believable, the interractions among the characters were plausible. I didn't hear a false note from beginning to end, and my wife and I watched it all in one go, something we rarely do.

And for heaven's sake, a proper Indian girl cannot show her bare legs in public.

But even though Jess is fanatic about playing, she isn't comfortable sneaking about and a conflict arises when her sister's wedding is on the same day as the football final. Yes, it is a formula film; parents don't want her to play football, she is going to miss the big game, and we are pulling for things to work out. But in this film the formula works. Irresistible performances will make you love the two female stars. This is a superb tale of a young girl's struggle to be true to herself and her family at the same time.

Parminder Nagra (televisions E.R.) plays a girl who is dealing with living with her Indian family and having the skills to play soccer. Her family does not want her to play soccer. They want her to find a good Indian man and be a good Indian wife.

Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean) watches Parminder play soccer with some guys in a park and asks her to play with their team coached by Jonathan Rhys Meyers

Can you see where this is headed? Let me fill it in for you. Keira likes the coach. Parminder, while intoxicated, falls in love with the coach as well. Problems, problems, problems.

Meanwhile, Parminder's family believe she is secretly dating an English boy because they see her and Keira hugging (Keira has short hair) and Keira's parents believe Keira is gay because they see the two girls hugging and being girly alot.

It's basically about an Indian Punjabi girl, Jess, who loves soccer, and gets encouraged by another girl, Jules, to join a female soccer team. Jess is very passionate about the game, but her parents try to steer her to do things good Indian girls should be doing: cooking traditional meals, wearing presentable clothing, etc. Jules' mother is having similar issues with her. And then there's a subtle romance going on between Jess and someone else.

I didn't really feel the chemistry between Jess and the person she was interested in, and I think the writers could have developed their romance better. But it's a really minor part of the plot anyway. In any case, at least this movie does have a good plot.

Her idol is David Beckam a famous soccer player in London. Her parents disapprove of her playing. It's not the Hindu way to be running around with boys and ""showing her legs"".  Her mom wants her to marry traditionally and be a homemaker just like her. Jess meets Juliet who has her try-out for a woman's soccer team. Jess gets on the team and has to lie to her family about where she has been spending her time. Jess's sister is about to get married to another Indian boy. But with Jess's running around, hiding, and lies it almost costs her sisters wedding.
 Bend it Like Beckam shows a lot of the different ways Indian woman are breaking out of their traditions and becoming more contemporary. From Jess's sister having sexual relations with her fianc before marriage to teenager girls wearing belly shirts and wearing blue contacts lenses. Some even dye their hair blonde in order to look more Caucasian and less Indian. In the Hinduism religion Indian woman are suppose to marry another Indian boy. In the locker room the soccer team was asking Jess who she was allowed to marry and she says, ""No white, Muslims, and definitely not a Black"".  This aspect of there religion is taking so seriously that when Jess was on the street corner with her friend Juliet (who has short hair) and they were laughing and hugging, her sisters-fianc's parents saw her and thought she was kissing an English boy. Her sisters wedding got called off on the account that Jess displays poor characteristics on the family. The lady thought if Jess `s urge to break the social norm of the Indian homemaker  displaying bad qualities then so will her sister and she was not fit to marry her son.

It's high-energy fun, a teen flick without too much stupid silliness or any of those contrived ""misunderstandings"" that are so common in comedies. The teen characters are irresistibly cute, the culture clashes are funny and not overdone, and the soccer scenes are exciting (I wish there were more of them).

But if the messages in this movie about ""girl power"" and following your dreams are going to be taken half seriously, then there's much to criticize. Most of the Indian girls and boys seem obsessed with sex, shopping, and early marriage. The girls lie to their parents time and time again. And what does it really say about girl power when the main character, Jess, as a beautiful, extremely talented soccer player, can win a sport scholarship to an American university? Are beautiful, extremely talented girls the only ones then who can hope to exercise ""girl power""? Jess doesn't have to work hard to acquire her soccer skills. She didn't even play on her high school team! And yet she is better than all the other talented girls who have worked hard for years, been coached, and played on teams. Everything comes so easy for Jess that it's easier to attribute her success to pure luck than to hard work or girl power.

On the other hand, besides being blessed and lucky Jess is sweet and level-headed. The movie is fun; the lessons are questionable.",1221436800,4,1417,4.7560975609756095

1482395,5,B00005JM2Y,"This is a rare film because it is funny, filled with action, revealing the struggle of cultures attempting to evolve within a foreign country and yet, fighting to keep the set of values that make them unique.

Bend it Like Beckham is a superb comedy that evolves around the lives of an Indian family raising two daughters, one following the values of her culture, considering that marriage and family are the keys to happiness, while the other is open and hungers to change the status quo.

Jess, masterfully played by Parminder Nagra, is an Indian girl born in England who, like her father, has great athletic aptitude and dreams of becoming a soccer player. She is fighting against prejudice because her own people do not want to see a girl showing her legs all over the television, a country where girls do not have the opportunities to shine if they excel in her sport, and her own demons because she fears rejection.

Enter a new English friend Juliet, superbly played by Keira Knightley, who scouts for her soccer team and is impressed about the ability of Jess when she sees her play at the park, competing and winning while surrounded by boys. Juliet approaches Jess and encourages her to join the girls team, and Jess accepts but secretly joins because she fears her family finding out and not permitting her to follow her dreams.

The male coach, played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, becomes the agent of change that opens Jess to no longer fear rejection, to overcome her personal fear of showing disfigurement in public, and the trigger for Jess to open her heart to welcome real change and that is becoming part of another cultural set of values.

This story is much like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" a genuine story of the struggle individuals go through as they open their hearts to understanding others with different and sometimes, clashing values, morals, and religious beliefs. This movie is a jewel and if you have teenagers around questioning their lives, this film provides a fun way to realize that we need to understand who we are, work hard at what we want, and follow our dreams, regardless of the barriers we encounter.

Don't miss it!!!",1209945600,2,2157,4.738666666666667

I actually watched, so I decided to give it a shot (and the good reviews helped a great deal!). I was not disappointed, this movie is very entertaining. Even though I read a review that says that it gives the wrong message (about lying to your parents, which of course isn't good), I think it approaches that touchy subject in a very natural way... who hasn't lied to their parents sometime? It doesn't, in my opinion, try to deliver the message that it's ok, it just portraits an adolescent's point of view, how they sometimes have to struggle (if they live in a foreign country and come from a very rigorous culture, like in this case). And the message that it actually delivers, again in my opinion, is that you should always do what you love if you want to be happy. That doesn't mean you have to lie, but fight for your dreams.

All in all this is a highly entertaining movie, great for all ages. It's very colorful too, and we get a glimpse of Indian culture and traditions. Obviously we westerners think some of them are far off, but for them, it's what they are! It also makes us aware of the importance of tolerance and open mindedness. I'm sure you'll enjoy it... I did!

Parminder Nagra is terrific as Jess, the Indian girl who loves to play football (soccer) and dreams of being able to bend it like her idol Beckham. Despite her parents wishes she joins a girls team at the insistence of her new friend Juliet (Keira Knightley). Determined to break free from the cultural expectations placed on her by her family, Jess now has the opportunity to prove how good a player she is and realize her dream. The possibilities are endless for those who dare to reach for the stars. As her relationship with her coach (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) deepens she may have found even more than she had initially anticipated.

Critique: While `Bend It Like Beckham' will appeal primarily to a female audience I think it's something that can be enjoyed by all if given a chance. Parminder and Keira are adorable and the action upbeat. I also enjoyed the soundtrack which like the film is a cultural smorgasbord, blending western pop tunes with traditional Indian music.",1203724800,2,1126,4.744897959183674

1482439,4,B00005JM2Y,"Bend It Like Beckham is a story about strength, overcoming odds, and reaching for difficult goals.  It centers around two soccer (football) players, Jess (Parminder Nagra) and Jules (Keira Knightly), who face family resistance and cultural pressure while trying to acheive their dreams on the field of play.

Jules sees Jess playing soccer in the park on day and instantly realizes a diamond in the rough who could help take her team over the top.  Unffortunately, Jess' parents are very strict and old-fashioned, and their Indian culture frowns upon a young lady playing sports competitively - they want a daughter who's looking towards building a family and learning to cook.  One of the interesting parts of this movie is the cultural immersion one experiences seeing the various traditions involved in an Indian girl's wedding, and the paranoid way in which Jess' mother attempts to prove their family's worthiness.

A love triangle ensues between the two and their coach - whose androgynous mannerisms completely betray the premise, and the tension of life, love, and competition endanger everyone's dreams.  It could affect Jess' sister's wedding, Jules' mother's sanity, and both girl's future.

The one down-side to this movie is the laughably horrible sports scenes.  The footwork on all goals, the slow-as-a-sloth goalies, the complete lack of defense, and the slow-motion ""action"" scenes take away from the realism of the movie, causing a viewer to seriously question if belief can be suspended enough to truly believe any of what is transpiring.

Despite that, the girls and their families learn to overcome differences and cultural barriers while on their way to athletic triumph.  It's a worthwhile watch, and probably a great chick-flick/sports combo for couples to watch.",1200009600,,1787,5.282685512367491

The movie may be a bit hard for Americans to follow at first, but eventually you figure it out and get wrapped up in the story. This is a British film about an Indian (from India) teenage girl in England who is a great soccer player. I'm not any type of sports fan but was able to understand the story when it involved the game. The British accents are a bit strong, but you get used to that too. American are familiar with various racial issues in the US, but England has its own racial issues that were tackled intelligently and sensitively in this film and it was not too hard for this American to follow that part of the story either.

It won my heart by defeating my various prejudices (Knightly, for instance, is too anorexic for my taste) due to its fine acting, interesting script, likeable attitude and tone. It is fun, and it has a point made in many prior films and books, but it makes it with a twist that keeps it fresh.

1482447,4,B00005JM2Y,"God, how I love Indies. They're funny, unique, usually somewhat dramatic like a dramedy, and special in their own way. Which is why I simply love Fox Searchlight studios: they've created movies that drop from indie heaven, and they are a fine studio. Bend it Like Beckham is in no way any exception: it's funny, smart, dramatic, special, and gives you that feel-good feeling inside. Parminder Nagra, an actress I have never seen act anywhere else, plays the Indian teenager Jess living in England with a passion for football (for us Americans, soccer). Her parents say otherwise, though, and she ends up lying and cheating out of her culture just so she can follow her dreams of one day playing professional. Her idol in life is David Beckham, much to her parents disprove. Almost in every way this girl is a rebel, and that's partly why the movie is so great. She will stop at nothing to make sure her dream is realized. Now, why, you ask, is a movie about that so appealing? Well, that's a question you'll need to see it to properly understand the answer to. The movie delivers a powerful, almost controversial message: your dreams are the most important things in your life. Put nothing ahead of them, and follow them until they come true in every way you originally imagined them to. This is a good movie to watch along with the recent film ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" as they both deliver the same message, and are both produced by Fox Searchlight, simply the BEST in indie film producing today. Rent ""Beckham,"" don't miss out on the fun. :)

Mom wants her to learn how to cook in the Indian way, marry and have children. Dad, an airline pilot, wants her to go to university and become a lawyer - then get married and have lots of kids.

  Jessie plays pick-up soccer in the park with the boys - also a no-no in a proper Indian family - where Jules, a slim boyish looking girl spots her and invites her to play on an amateur girls soccer team. Jules' mom is on of the best parts of the movie. A haughty, social climbing, pretenious woman, delightfully played, who chews up the scenery in every scene.

1482519,5,B00005JM2Y,"Highly recommended for the entire family, BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM is a charming and very funny movie about two British teenaged girls who like football almost as much as their mothers love traditional female roles.

An instant classic on par with anything Disney has ever created, this film requires no appreciation of sports whatsoever. In fact, I suspect that people who dislike sports entirely will love this one more than those who do.

A light-hearted exploration of the culture shocks and generation gaps created when two girls risk family shame to play football, BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM offers the world a loving window into the world of England's Indian  immigrants and London's middle class WASPs.

Here you will meet Jess (Parminder Nagra), the youngest daughter of an orthodox Sikh family.  Though Jess wants to respect her family and its heritage, the fact remains that everyday, Jess prays to her personal deity, sports superstar David Beckham, whose image hangs from her bedroom walls.

Here you will meet Jules (Keira Knightley), the tomboy daughter of a floozy mother who would far prefer to buy her daughter a push-up  bra than a football.

Directed by Gurinder Chadha, BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM is hilarious to children, teenagers and even grandparents.  But honestly one of the best things about the film is the music. A bizarre mix of 70s American soul music, Punjabi hip hop and traditional Indian music, this is one film that sounds even better than it looks.

Set in Britain, you have Jess, a teenage girl of Indian descent, keenly interested in playing soccer (or football in Britain) and very good at soccer as well! She idolizes British soccer player David Beckham and dreams of one day becoming a professional player herself! Unfortunately, her parents are very traditional and don't want her playing soccer as girls of her age should no longer be interested in playing sports.

Jess secretly joins a girl's soccer team after being spotted by another female soccer player, Juliet, who helps recruit Jesse to play for her team. Jess's parents don't approve, but Jess decides to play on the team anyway and not tell her parents anything about being on the team.

Jess excels at playing soccer, enjoys playing soccer as it is her passion, and becomes fast friends with the girls on her team as well as her coach. She also does a lot of funny things in order not to be caught playing on an all girl's soccer team by her parents, but still gets caught anyway. It doesn't help that the coach for the team is a male!

Pros: Cute, funny movie, with great storyline about friendship, family, love, and finding the inner strength be fight for what you believe in and following your dream.

Bend it Like Beckham follows Jess, a young British girl of Indian descent on her quest to become a soccer player like her idol David Beckham. She strives for this goal despite the disapproval of her traditional Indian parents who want her to conform to traditional Indian culture. I love how the movie explores the changing cultures between the generations of family. She perseveres despite numerous familial and social obstacles and in the end achieves her dream.

1482527,3,B00005JM2Y,"I quite enjoyed this film, although I could tell at almost every turn what's going to happen. Not only do we have the obligatory love triangle, a clash of cultural norms, but Jess just can't do anything ""wrong"" without being found out, somebody always shows up to notice, report on her etc.

I am sympathetic to movies where the main character realizes his/her dreams against all odds. In this case, the younger daughter of a not too wealthy Indian family, Jess (Parminder Nagra) has her heart set on football and plays with her Indian friends in the park whenever she can (all half naked men, of course). When Juliet (Keira Knightley), a young woman who plays in a girl's team notices her invites to try out, Jess's life becomes a bunch of lies, all in good fun, of course. Her family strongly disapproves, so Jess follows her heart and her sister covers for her.

Jess's mother is perhaps the funniest character of the entire movie, what with her mannerism, determination to put a stop to this foolishness and delightful non-sequiturs (""I don't want you to be like your niece, running around, showing her legs."" ""She's a fashion designer, mom"" ""Divorced, that's what she is. She got married to the gora boy with blue hair, and that's what happens..."" or something like this, you'll have to see :) The dialogue is not always easy to catch for outsiders, but still enjoyable.

Interestingly, Jess's and Juliet's mothers have similar fears about their daughters being corrupted by soccer and inability to act like a proper woman. Jess' mom is afraid of the influence of men, especially white guys, while Juliet's mom is concerned that her daugher has turned into a lesbian - both form the basis for a number of jokes.

The soccer team is coached by a young white man, the subject of both Juliet's and later Jess's affection. Hence the love triangle, which teenagers must like, but I am too old to figure out what there is to hate about your friend because a guy likes her and not you. As a result, I thought the conflict was artificial and uninteresting.

Then the international, cross-cultural, girl-power, film comedy ""Bend it Like Beckham"" is surely the answer. The movie takes place in England, where we meet teenager, Jess Kaur Bhamra (played by Parminder Nagra of TV's ""ER""). She loves playing football (thats' soccer for us, Yanks!) and is an absolute phenomenol, wiz at it, running rings around the guys in pick-up games at the park. At one such game, she meets up with another talented female player named, Jules (Keira Knightley), who wants her to join up with her team in an actual proper (rules, refs, uniforms ETC.) Women's league, which takes it's sports very seriously. Jess tries out for the team's young, but headstrong Coach, Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and makes the team! But there is only one big problem. Jess, comes from a very traditional Indian family. Her Mom (Shaheen Kahn) and Dad (Anupam Kher) dosn't think she should be rough-housing and playing games. In their eyes, she should be in the kitchen learning to make a 'proper Indian dinner' for an in the near-future, 'proper Indian husband'. To complicate matters even further, the family is obsessed with her older sister Pinky's (Archie Punjabi) tumultuous, engagement and wedding plans. In a comedic fashion, Jess' football plans and the big wedding eventually meet head on in both a hilarious and rousing collision course. Director/Writer, Gurinder Chadha (""Bhaji On the Beach"", ""What's Cooking?"") has created a wonderful, high energy, feel-good comedy. While on the surface it might look like it's about sports, in reality the film is about following your dreams. Gurinder's script shows us clashes and misunderstandings abound between generations, ethnic groups, male-female relationships and even best friends. If we would only listen to each other once in awhile, we could avoid a whole lot of trouble. The film has a wonderful cast featuring Parminder Nagra giving a great performance as the determined and forthright, Jess. It seems no matter what she does she's going to land in trouble. Keira Knightley is radiant in a standout, supporting performance as Jess' best friend Jules. Also mention should be made of Anupam Kehr who plays Jess' father, who is both loving but conflicted over his daughter's hopes and dreams. Finally, their is veteren actress, Juliet Stevenson's over-the-top, hilarious turn as Jules' mother, who through a misunderstanding thinks her tom-boyish, daughter is having a gay relationship with Jess. I laughed my head off when she uttered the line ""get your lesbian feet out of my shoes!"". The film also has a delightful sound track that features a wonderful mix of both western pop and Indian dance/electronica music. As for the DVD itself the sound & picture plus menus look great and the disc is loaded with extras, that are as much fun as the movie itself. It features deleted/extended scenes, that are hilarious and easily could have been left in the finished film. The disc also has the Director's commentary, a 'Making of Documentary and the film's international trailers. We also get various music videos connected with the film (some of which feature Mr. & Mrs. Beckham themselves!) But my favorite extra on the disc is a cooking lesson of an Indian dish from Director, Gurinder Chadha and her mother. It's great listening to the mother-daughter quibble back and forth and you get some ideal, where the characters from the film might have originated from. This is a very light, funny, upbeat film.

1482656,5,B00005JM2Y,"I finally saw this after seeing Bride and Prejudice a few weeks ago.  I can see what all the fuss was about, especially since this was a ""small movie"" when released in the US that did well mostly on word of mouth.  Truly I wish I had seen it in the theater.

Parminder Nagra was wonderful as Jess, the Indian girl who plays great football (soccer), but all her family cares about is marrying off her sister and getting Jess ready for the same route by teaching her to cook an Indian meal and wear more makeup.  Jess is torn between loyalty to her family, who do genuinely love her and mean well, and her desire to see how far her football talent can take her.

Keira Knightly has one of her first ever roles (maybe her first ever role) as the girl who befriends Jess and encourages her to join a women's team.  She shows Jess that their dream of playing women's soccer professionally could come true.

While the main storyline is compelling, by itself it would be teh stuff of a Disney or ABC Family network movie.  What really makes the movie wonderful is the time and attention given to so many of the supporting characters--Jess' family aren't simple old-fashioned obstacles to her dream, they have real reasons for wanting to protect her from herself to keep her from getting hurt as they have been in the past.  The actors who play her father and mother are especially good.

Another supporting standout is Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who plays the coach Joe.  Every time Jess' playing seems to have hit an immovable obstacle, Joe takes a step that keeps it going.  It's not easy, as Jess points out to him at one point, but her family would never have come around at all without Joe's polite but insistent nudges.

Of course there are feel-good football playing sequences, and of course the sister's wedding is a blur of ceremony, dancing and even a pointless fight in a hallway (The director's commentary says she insisted on leaving the scene in because a fight always seems to break out at an Indian wedding and no one is ever sure what it's about).

Gurinder Chadha wrote and directed the movie and it's obviously a labor of great love.  She does a wonderful job of capturing the tension of the generation of Asians who have grown up in England with English customs, but still pulled toward the customs of their oftentimes unseen homeland.  I loved the little scenes that showed Jess and her peers navigating between the two worlds, like when she and her sister smoothly shift from talking about boys to giving a traditional greeting to the mother of a friend.

And like Bride and Prejudice, this movie has a fabulous soundtrack and is going on my list of CDs I want to get one of these days!

Also, on the DVD, don't miss the director's commentary because it adds a lot to many of the little touches in the movie--you'll be able to spot her relatives playing relatives in the wedding scenes, and the many tributes to her deceased father that appear in the movie.

Worth watching, and for me, probably worth watching again!",1136246400,16,3027,4.561922365988909
1482657,2,B00005JM2Y,"Well, let me go the other way on some of the more worshipful reviews.  If you want an age appropriate film for mid-teens then try New Waterford Girl, 1999. There's a teen girl buddy story that tackles some tricky problems with wit and script.

Problem 1:  The happy talk about the ethnic differences and PC drivel about the immigrants that have swarmed into England for a better life, especially the Muslims, this is a bitter pill to swallow after the 2005 bombings of innocents in London.  To be fair, Parmider Nagra's family is a discriminated upon group of folks with turbans, the Sikh's.  They are non-Muslims in secular white England.  You can't happy talk folks into being more tolerant. Sorry, you can't.

Problem 2:  The sports action scenes are so predictable. They go on and on for half the movie.  Nagra overcomes all obstacles and scores the winning goal.  No kidding!  I didn't see that one coming.

Problem 3:  Neither Nagra or her bosom bud, Keira Knightley look like first class athletes.  They are either too short or too skinny.  They look better with teased up hair and disco outfits dancing for their skinny ex-soccer prodigy, their coach.

Problem 4:  I like ethnic comedies; My Big Fat Greek Wedding comes to mind.  But at this point, the generation gap between old country dopes and their offspring in modern Western civilization is tiring.  Hey, if your old ways and old country were so great, why don't you go back there?  I'll tell you why, because there is no opportunity where you came from and people live in dirt.  No, we wouldn't want to be like those Westerners, would we?

Beckman, now he's a real product of Old England, fierce, determined, and a product of meritocracy, not dimwitted old ways.",1135123200,2,1728,4.728187919463087

I also couldn't date a guy who cancelled dates etc just to go and see a bunch of guys kick a stupid ball around. But I found this film a pleasant surprise, as it focused on the girls, and didn't go too much into the football side of the things. I didn't have to know the offside rule just to watch the film.

Parminder Nagra was absolutely fabulous in this film, despite her character's obsession with David Beckham (bleurgh), and she was a real natural in front of the camera too. This girl has big things ahead of her. She also wears the number 7 shirt, the same number Beckham wears for England, and once wore for Manchester United. Unlike her super-skinny co-star, Parminder has a really natural shape, and isn't ashamed to show it off. And the scar on her leg (which I didn't think was real at first) was also incorportated into the film, as well as the story behind it, as originally Parminder thought it would stop her from getting the role.

I have to say, Keira Knightley really is way too skinny. She needs a good feeding, and also needs to do something with her hair. It was a mess in this film. She manages to show off her six pack (how many girls do you know who have a six pack?) with the little crop tops she insisted on wearing.

Johnathan Rhys Meyers was lovely in this film, and also the accent as well! The plot was sometimes a little predictable, as the three main stars got involved in a love triangle, and you could so see that coming! (Although, in the original script, it was Parminder & Keira's characters who were actually in love, and there's still some of this left in the film, including Jules mum thinking her daughter - Keira - is in love with Jess.)

And what's strange in this film is that although Parminder & Keira are playing teenagers, there's actually a 10 year age gap between them, but Parminder does NOT look 10 years older than Keira. Keira was born in 1985, and Parminder was born in 1975.

The extras aren't up to much, and kinda boring at the same time. You've got your average commentaries, deleted scenes, making of, outtakes, music videos and also ""Who Wants to Cook Aloo Gobi?"" featurette and the recipe for Aloo Gobi.

I did enjoy this movie, although the ending is a little sad, and there are a lot of serious issues sprinkled throughout. It's definitely a movie I'll watch again, with a lot of injokes as well, and sports bra jokes. It also gives an insight into the Indian culture, which worked really well I thought.",1125792000,5,2538,4.412393162393163
1482663,5,B00005JM2Y,"But, can just anyone direct a complex film like this and make it seem fresh and simple?

Have watched two films of Gurinder Chadha and I'm convinced the man is a genius.  In ""Bend it"" he manages to seque enough sub-plots together to create a full story that will keep viewers seeing new aspects after numerous viewings.

First, there's Jessminda (Parminder Nagra) a second sister in a traditional Indian family who only wants to play football (soccer in US parlance) and 'bend it (the ball) like (David) Beckham.'  When Jules, an English girl with similar ambitions, discovers Jess and recruits her for an all girls soccer team, Jess doesn't even know what position she played.  She just played on the field.  Well, it turns out Jess is brilliant and it only takes a little coaching to get that brilliance polished.

Then there is Jess' relationship to Keira Knightly (Jules).  Jules' mother thinks Jules is a lesbian because all she's interested in is sports.  When she overhears a conversation between Jess and Jules, she believes the two girls are in love and Jess betrayed her daughter...

Then there's Jess' older sister, Pinky, who just wants to get married.  The misunderstandings between the two sets of parents, etc. seem to be keeping the lovers apart.

Then, there's Joe, the girls' soccer coach who just may be falling in love with Jess.  Jess admits she'll have an easier time explaining that she wants to be a professional athlete than bringing home a white boyfriend....

""Bend it"" is hilarious and bears watching more than once even if you think you have all the plot elements down.  Hurrah for Bollywood!!!!!",1124064000,3,1625,4.858181818181818
1482664,4,B00005JM2Y,"If you like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" you will love ""Bend It Like Beckham."" The story is about an Indian girl named Jess who lives in Britain with her family.

With the duty to ""be there"" for Jess's sister Pinky, who is getting married, Jess is torn between ""accepting life, accepting situations"" and fighting to keep her dream of playing soccer alive.

The movie is humorous at times, dramatic at others. Paraminder Negra does a beautiful job in portraying Jess. I'll never get bored of this movie; ironically, I only give this movie four stars because I think the writer included the word ""brilliant"" and the phrase ""I just can't take no for an answer"" too many times.

1482698,5,B00005JM2Y,"""Bend it like Beckham"" is a film about dreams, more specifically about the dream of Jess (Parminder Nagra), a young teenager who would love to play soccer as well as her idol, David Beckham. There are two problems, though. The first is the fact that she is a girl, and the second is her very traditional Hindu family.

The first problem proves to be easily surmountable, as Jess meets Jules (Keira Knightley), a girl who happens to play in the local soccer team. Jules introduces Jess to the coach of her soccer team, Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). Despite some initial skepticism, Joe incorporates Jess to the team, after a great try out.

Unfortunately, Jess cannot share her happiness with her family. Her parents are immigrants from India, and even though they have lived in England for a long time they still cherish their old traditions. Of course, and according to them, a good girl shouldn't play soccer: she should think about getting married  :)

As a result, Jess hides the good news from her father (Anupam Kher), mother (Shaheen Khan) and sister (Archie Punjabi), and begins to play soccer with her new team. As you can imagine, keeping her family from finding out the truth will be quite difficult and hectic. Meanwhile, we will learn some things about cultural differences, friendship, love and (why not?) soccer.

On the whole, I highly recommend this movie, even if you aren't that much into soccer. It is very entertaining, but it also helps you to reflect on our increasingly multicultural societies. I specially liked the overall positive message, and I would like to recommend this movie to you and your family. It is a winning goal  :)

1482701,5,B00005JM2Y,"BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM tells the tale of a soccer-loving teenage girl named Jesminder, or ""Jess"" (Parminder Nagra) whose traditionally-minded family emigrated from India to England. Jess finds herself torn between honoring her parents' wishes to learn traditional Indian women's skills (such as cooking a traditional Indian meal) and honoring her heart's desire to play football (aka soccer). When her sister becomes engaged to be married, the family pressure increases for Jess to set football aside, at the same time as Jess begins to realize how much she loves playing... and winning... football games! Jess is fortunate to have friends and family who care so much about her, although there are many ups and downs. Adding to the humor and tension of this film are frequent misunderstandings about who's kissing whom, as parents struggle to figure out what's going on and how to get their kids' lives back on track. Fortunately for all of us, the kids are focused on helping one another make their dreams come true.

The entire cast in BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM is fabulous, and the film is at times hilarious, heart-breaking, sad, and uplifting. I was tremendously touched by Parminder Nagra's acting in the role of Jess, as her every expression conveyed tremendous warmth, intelligence, and inner fire. The other star player on the team is Jules, played by Keira Knightley, and she was every bit as riveting to watch as Parminder.

BEND IT is a truly amazing and inspiring movie with a powerfully positive message... that great things can be accomplished when you stick with them and don't give up, and when you've got supportive friends and family.

We follow a young Indian girl (Jess) as she gradually tackles all her troubles. She is a ""brilliant"" footballer, whose parents are an extremely conservative Indian family, and don't liker her ""chasing a ball around the park,"" but she is really good. Enter Jules, a girl of same age who is on an all-girls soccer team. The two become friends and Jess gets persuaded to join. Needless to say, this adds to Jess' problems, oh and then she falls in love with her coach, who is not Indian, further adding to her problems.

Juliet Stevenson, who plays the mum of Jules, is absolutely hilarious. She has some very funny scenes and quotes.

1482764,5,B00005JM2Y,"As far as British comedies featuring Indians go, this movie ranks a sweet number one above 1996's ""East is East"". The movie, as cliched as it sounds, is as tasty as the various Punjabi cuisine featured in it.

The director, Gurinder Chadha, directs this movie like a Bollywood musical-cum-Chariots of Fire-cum-dramedy. Like her recent film, Bride and Prejudice, this movie centres around the trials and tribulations of an Indian family living in a ""goreh"" country and the likes of Mr. Posh Spice's occupation.

Like Mira Nair's ""Missisippi Masala"" and ""Monsoon Wedding"", the centrepiece of this movie is surprisingly not a climatic soccer match alone. It intercuts with an exhurbent and exhilarating wedding party, full of colours, music, dance and food. Chadha finds the right balance in inserting familial cultural clash in humourous ways. Jessminder's mother is a riot. Armed with a traditional mindset and recipes for a full Punjabi dinner, meat and vegetarian, she steals the show with her sharp repartoire in regards to her ""wayward"" daughter.

At first glance this movie appears to be a brit-flick-chick-flick but it is a whole lot more.  I cant say enough about what an enjoyable movie this is.  The cinematography is beautiful and it has a great soundtrack that really gets the audience in a happy mood.

The story is fresh and while the theme may not be you don't notice it because the characters, both Indian and British, are well crafted and greatly portrayed.  The Indian family is of course very idiosyncratic and the director, being Indian, pokes a little fun at her own culture -- of course with the best intentions.  But she doesn't save this just for the Indians, ""Jules"" parents (the English Set) are two riotously humorous characters.

Beyond this, the script is so well written with fresh humor and great sequencing.  I think the film really is a gem.  The best part about the film is its wide appeal.  This is one of those rare movies you can watch with your extended family and they will all love it.  Of course the film resonates best with adolescents but I haven't found a single person who hasn't said this film is at least good.

One warning: The soundtrack is catchy and you may need to buy it.

If you have seen the film in theaters or on TV you are still missing out.  Get the DVD its packed with deleted scenes (which are understandably not a part of the original film), an aloo gobi recipe and a great commentary -- just to name a few things.

1482769,5,B00005JM2Y,"Ok so I'm a fan of feel good movies but I didn't know what to expect with this one. The reason I feel this movie is superior to most movies made by Indian directors is because most movies made in the Bollywood film industry are very unrealistic. As an example - they have people break into song and dance sequences from Switzerland to New York when the story is suppose to be set in India. Indian directors who try to be ""alternative"" and make their story in America also go overboard and make the minority who is growing up in America seem over westernized. By that, I mean that all the protagonist will do is smoke, drink and chase boys or girls.  And, of course in American movies, Indians are only shown as the liquor store owner/taxi driver.

This movie decided to forgo the clich and have a simple and very believable boy meets girl story. The race difference is not covered up nor is it used in a demeaning way for anyone. Having ultra-conservative parents myself, I felt as if Jasminder's parents were my parents. This movie is very easy to relate to. The sound track is also very nice - with classic Hindi and Punjabi music and some new English releases.

Jess is played by Parminder Nagra who is also on ER, Anupam Kher is an Indian actor who must have been in at least 100 Hindi films, and Keira Knightley (who was virtually unknown when this movie first came out) is pretty famous now and has starred in Love Actually, King Arthur, and Pirates of the Caribbean.

The problem is the storyline is incredibly predictable. I kept waiting for the story to make a tangent, any tangent, from the standard formula where everything the main character wants is achieved in the end including an unlikely dream coming true and getting the attractive young man to desire her. The contrivance of parents who stand in the way of both as the source of main dramatic tension is also standard formula stuff.

If you like to watch movies where the protagonist has fantasy goals and a possible unrequited love but gets a fairytale perfect ending (including parents who do a complete turnaround and magically turn accepting and supportive), this would be a good movie for you.

The story follows a British-Indian girl coming of age and trying to fulfill her deepest personal calling, love and honor her parents, and build and manage friendships.  None of these things come easy, especially when these ideals begin to compete and conflict with one another.

The richness of the film is in it's multi-cultural fabric.  I love the juxtapostion of the modern hip-hop music and the soccer scenes with the girls in their bright jerseys against the Hindi music and wedding scenes with the women in their own bright colors.

This film protrays the conflict between calling and family, betweeen the traditional and the modern, and then gives hope that these apparent opposite forces can actually complement and strengthen one another instead of forcing one to always choose one over the other.

In a world where people and ideas are too often polarized, it is empowering to meet Jess, an unassuming heroine who has the character to follow her heart, fulfill her calling, and reconclie her worlds.",1098835200,7,1124,4.878947368421053

Bend rules YES. Break rules NO. That's why this movie is unique. You can make your dream come true WITHOUT breaking the rules, but you can BEND the rules. In fact Jess did so; she didn't run away from home to become a pro-footballer nor did she skip university. She put family first, and as all Hindus belief, good things come to those who wait, her father realizes her talent and encourages Jess to pursuit her dream despite of his own past-failure for not pursuing his dream to become a world-class cricket player.

1482851,4,B00005JM2Y,"Growing up in the UK I was always more interested in rugby than soccer and had to endure FA Cup matches and World Cup action with my family. So, when I heard about BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, it seemed like it was about as far away as a movie could be from something I would like.

Little did I know that this engaging comedy is precisely the type of movie that someone who lists SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY and NOTTING HILL would enjoy.

The story of an Indian girl who breaks with her cultural tradition and goes against her parents wishes to join a girls soccer team is handled with a light personal touch. Also interwoven among the inevitable romance and hijinks of teenage girls discovering themselves is an interesting insight into the Indian culture as transplanted into England in what director Gurinder Chadha calls one of her most personal of movies.

Newcomer Parminder Nagra plays Jess, the Indian girl in question , who goes behind her parents backs to join the Hounslow Harriers - a top girls team which lists among its players a spunky tomboy named Jules (played by hot Hollywood actress and rising sex symbol Keira Knightley) who spots Jess's talents after seeing her kick a ball around with her friends at the local park.

The two immediately strike up a friendship that is compromised by a mutual attraction to the same man - their coach Joe (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers).

Soccer actually plays a relatively minor role in the picture, merely serving as a backdrop on which to paint the story of friendship, tradition, culture and self-discovery. And although the action scenes are well handled, the best parts of the movie are the parental interactions with Jess and Jules and the interactions between the two of them and between Jess and Joe.

Engagingly and inifinately watchable with some toe jigging musical tracks the DVD includes a commentary from Chadha, a making of featurette, deleted scenes, featurette on the Indian dish Aloo Gobi which is featured in the movie, music, ottakes and a recipe for Aloo Gobi. Also of interest is the inclusion of more humorous bloopers over the closing credits.",1098316800,10,2133,4.782608695652174
1482852,4,B00005JM2Y,"What a unique and pleasant little movie. This film is just fun. I highly enjoyed this personal little movie. You can tell that this was a real labor of love for director Gurinder Chadha. She really put her heart into this film and it's apparent. It's rare to see such a warm and individualistic movie today.

As an American, I found the ""Britishness"" of this movie to be a treat. It added to the style of the film for me. The actors, the language, the locales, and even the style of humor is wonderfully British rather than formulaic American/Hollywood of today and I found that refreshing.

I also enjoyed the delightful and intimate portrayal of Hindu society in this film. There is no stereotyping involved, but a realistic portrayal of Indian culture surrounded by and existing within a white English majority. As being of Indian decent herself, director Gurinder Chadha has obviously put herself and her own life experiences into so many aspects of this movie that it couldn't possibly be anything less than authentic.

The element of soccer (""football"" as they say in Europe) was the third ingredient into this mix that completely worked for me. As an American, we've seen one triumphant baseball, American football, and basketball movie after another, but this is probably the first movie I know of that centers losely around the sport of soccer. David Beckham is not quite a household word in the States as say Dion Sanders or Michael Jordan is here. I suppose if this movie would have been made in the US, it would have been about two teenage girls who play softball or high school basketball and it might have been titled ""Curve it Like Clemens"", ""Dunk it Like Shaq"", ""Hit it Like Bonds"", or ""Drive it Like Woods"".

As it is, this warm and touching movie keeps things light and on a wonderfully ""European"" tone throughout. It reminded me very much of another wonderful English comedy of recent times, ""Brassed Off"" starring Ewan McGregor.

Very charming and unique film. I highly recommend ""Bend it Like Beckham"" for anyone who's bored with conventional Hollywood comedy films and wants something different.",1097020800,5,2117,4.853185595567867
1482853,4,B00005JM2Y,"Parminder Nagra is superb as Jesminder ""Jess"" Bhamra, a London born teen but raised in the Indian orthodox Sikh religion. The youngest daughter of the Family Bhamra (Anupam Kher & Shaheen Khan), Jess is disobedient to her parents and the traditional, old school ways of Sikh.

Jess just happens to be a very gifted football (soccer) player and hatches a plan to go behind her parents backs to play on the London girl's professional football team along with her friend and teammate Juliette 'Jules' Paxton, played by Keira Knightley. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Joe, the dreamy football coach that both of the girls fall for and fight over.

But, as the girl's team starts to gain some media attention, Jess's secret can't be kept forever!

Mr. Bhamra tries to hammer home to Jess that a Sikh is measured by his quality and NOT quantity that he is a small or a big man. So, in a Sikh, it is what comes out of his mouth that matters as it reflects the quality of learning. Disobedience, lying, and above all, interracial relationships are NOT ALLOWED!

Mrs. Bhamra only prays for her youngest daughter to be a normal Sikh young woman, betrothed to a good Sikh young man, and of course, hopes that she can cook a good Aloo Gobi. (Recipe included in the extras of the DVD! How CUTE!)

Jess is grasping to be her own person while still holding true to her faith and upbringing.  Jess doesn't want to leave her new, more independent way to live her life for the other, more traditional way of life. All the way through the film she strives to blend the two together in harmony while trying desperately to honor her parents, her family obligations, ties and traditions.

This film is more than a teen, feel good, sports movie.  It has the great quality of breaking stereotypes, old traditions, and acceptance, above all...

It's like an Anglo-Indian Cinderella Story, except that Parminder Nagra is about a thousand times more interesting than Hillary Duff.

The plot is paper thin, generally along the lines of ""mom and dad forbid daughter from playing soccer; daughter sneaks out and plays anyway and gets caught; mom and dad forbid daughter from playing soccer again; daughter sneaks out again and plays anyway and gets caught again"" and so forth.  The coach's key contribution to the movie is to smoulder, and the ending is ludicrous not only for its deus ex machina quality but for its complete reversal--two star-crossed lovers agree that they can never be together, and three minutes later they're making out in Heathrow airport in front of the whole world.

It's a good-hearted movie and it tries really hard, but I wouldn't have bought it if I had seen it first.  On the plus side, the punjabi wedding scenes were fantastic, other than the mother's tasteless interruption.",1094342400,5,1121,4.848167539267016

So I decide to buy it and I am stuck watching it. Twice. It has elements of ""Golden Boy"" if you remember that far back, of the artist forced to fight to raise money for the suffering parents, but here the parents are Hindu and the heroine, Jess, a gifted football star.

The racism is funny . . . except when you remember how we have treated minority groups in America. The well to do Hindu family doesn't want their daughter to 'show her legs' in a rough and tumble sport, and especially to get involved with a 'white boy.' The girls sullen but charismatic soccer coach has an answer for that. He says, ""I know. I'm Irish."" Great line.

Good scenes of soccer-football. Nice dialogue. ""Kids are alright"" to quote Roger Daltry. No real flaws. Predictable . . .but who cares?

1482886,4,B00005JM2Y,"It's been a long time since I could say that I thought a film was at all original or new.  While the story is fairly universal, having a mixture of East Indian culture and English/Irish culture together in a girl's soccer movie is a very unusual and altogether delightful brew.  All the characters are very human, with zero melodrama, all the right emotions are conveyed with honesty and talent.  So, why not 5 stars?  Well, sometimes the soccer play looks choreographed and not entirely realistic.  None of the players seem to sweat very much during the games, or look at all physically exhausted.  The camera angles and sweeping steady-cam shots are interesting and vibrant during those sequences, however, lending a real time perspective(you feel like you are on the field).  But the soccer is not the heart of the film.  The heart of the film is in the form of a friendship between two girls who play together and, unfortunately, both fall in love with the same man.  Friction, indeed!  The only other minor negative in the film is with the tidy ending.  All the loose ends are accounted for, whether realistic or not, creating a complete story wrapped in gold paper and tied up with a pretty red bow.  It was also wonderful to encounter such a talented, new, and gorgeous young actress named Parminder Nagra.  She absolutely glows in this film.  Keira Knightly, of more recent ""Pirates of the Carribean"" fame, makes her debut here, as well.  They have great chemistry together.  For that matter, the entire cast is exceptional...and often very, very funny.  This is a light-hearted film with good writing and an original story.  All in all, this is a very entertaining film.

1482887,5,B00005JM2Y,"I caught this movie while flipping through the cable channels and was instantly mesmerized.  It is about a teenage Indian girl (nicknamed Jesse) in London who loves soccer and hopes to play for the British woman's team.  The problem is her family still believes that women are married early and have many kids and do not delve into distractions like games.  Therefore, Jesse must sneak away to attend practices.  She develops a friendship with one of her teammates and generally loves the new world she has entered.

Meanwhile Jesse's sister has had her engagement arranged.  Jesse gets in big trouble when she hugs her teammate in a bus stop and the parents of the groom happen by in car.  They see Jesse's teammate from the back and think that it is an ""English boy.""  They go to Jesse's parents and want to call the wedding off because a proper Indian woman would never do something like that.  Jesse is forced to tell her parents that she is playing soccer and that the ""boy"" was really her teammate and nothing happened between them.  Her parents tell her to stop this soccer business and prepare herself to be a proper Indian wife.

Her father tells her that he was once prevented from playing cricket because he is Indian, so he has vowed to never let sports become an important part of his life.

Jesse has to sneak away to attend a big game in Germany.  There things get rocky between herself and her teammate because they are both competing for the affections of their coach.  He seems to favor Jesse because he has had similar problems with his own parents who think it is unmanly to coach women's soccer.  Of course the game is so big that the team's picture is put in the newspaper and Jesse's parents find out.  Jesse must decide if she will do what her parents want or follow the ways of her own heart.",1092700800,5,1817,4.510703363914373

However, the focus here is not so much the game as it is the character's dream to play it without compromising her family's traditions.

Jess is a teenaged Indian girl living in England whose older sister is getting married. Though it is a ""love match"", the wedding and all that leads up to it is very traditional Indian, for these ethnic families resist being Anglicized at every turn. Jess is a talented soccer player, which is decidedly unladylike, especially for a girl that according to her mother, should be worried about finding a nice Indian boy to marry.

Jess, encouraged by newfound friend, Juliette, joins a soccer team on the sly. From this point forward, we see poor Jess try to juggle her wishes and those of her family's in an entirely realistic manner that was rather unexpected in a film of this genre. Anyone with an ethnic background can relate to her experiences as well as to her family.

It is hilarious to see the misunderstandings, Jess getting busted at every turn, and the promise of a forbidden love. Everyone is this film delivers a strong performance, and rather than turning this into a soccer movie, it turns into a movie whose theme focuses more on living for oneself.

I would say that having seen this on DVD and having been privy to deleted scenes, my only gripe, and it's a minor one, is that the scene in which Pinky (the older sister) and Jess discuss marriage should have been kept in. This scene humanizes the often backstabbing and shallow seeming Pinky. However, painting her as a complete witch is not a terrible thing either.

The movie is well made: not only is the writing good but I was particularly impressed with the editing and the music.  I don't usually notice such things, but I thought both were very well done and added to the movie.  A lot of the humor was very subtle and showed a very dry wit.  I particularly liked the touch of the ditzy, slutty sister who is the ""perfect"" daughter because she hides her rebellion.
I found it a little upsetting, when I saw it in the theater, that the scene where the father describes the rascism he encountered when he first tried to play cricket in Britain elicited a chorus of laughter from the audience.

Unfortunately, Jess's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Brahma (Anupam Kher and Shaheen Khan respectively), don't completely approve (her mother especially) of Jess's continued participation in soccer as she has grown.  Instead, they want her to learn more traditional Sikh family ways. A very memorable scene is the film's opening with Jess imagining herself playing with David Beckham, with television sports commentators interviewing her parents.  However, in Jess's imagination, her mother begins to scold the commentators for encouraging her to play soccer.  As the story progresses, Jess's friend Juliette 'Jules' Paxton (Keira Knightley) invites Jess to play on her team that is coached by an Irishman named Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).  Though her parents object, Jess continues to play with the team and even manages to secretly go with them to play against a team in Germany; and that's when things change more drastically and unexpectedly for Jess, Jules and Joe.

1482980,5,B00005JM2Y,"For once girls kick butt.  In this film a girl fights to play soccer. It's a fun and entertaining film that invites the viewer to take a closer look into the challenges of being a girl in cleats.
Very similar to My Big Fat Greek Wedding this film plays on the cultural aspects of Indian Sikhs in Britain.  Just as in ""MBGW"" the family's main concern is that the main character gets married someday.  In ""Bend It"" the family is concerned about what a future husband would think if he found out his wife plays soccer.
Jesminder, unlike her older sister, is not a commodified woman. She is completely her own person.  She does not care for makeup and dresses.  Her parents do not understand why she does not care for these things and why she is so worried about soccer.  In a hilarious scene Jess's mother prays for her to forget about soccer and worry about the more important things in life.
This film takes a look at the intersections of race and gender in this character's life.  Her teammates do not understand why her parents will not let her play soccer.  And Jesminder's parents can not understand why their ""girl"" daughter wants to play the sport.  All of these issues are showed in a way that makes the viewers laugh and at the same time question why should playing soccer be so difficult.
 A fun film for any girl to watch whom plays soccer or any sport.",1084233600,3,1362,4.433734939759036
1482981,4,B00005JM2Y,"Bend it like Beckham is a wonderful movie.  A young Indian girl, named Jess, who idolizes Manchester United soccer star David Beckham (the movie is pre-trade to Real Madrid) finds it tough to follow her dream of playing soccer.  Her parents don't understand her desire to play, especially her mother, who only wants her to learn to cook good Indian food.  Jess is very talented at the game, however, and one day she is noticed by a girl who plays on an all girl's team.  The girl, named Julie, convinces her to come out to play for the team.  Soon Jess tries to play the game she loves while trying to keep it from her parents.
The story is not particularly original.  In fact, it is rather formulaic.  Contained in this film are elements we have all seen many times before.  Will Jess' parents discover her lies?  Will there be a conflict between the two girls over a guy they both like?(it happens to be the coach of the girl's team)  Will there be a ""big game"" at the end which gives us a happy resolution?  The answer to all these is a yes, yet the film is still great to watch.  The young cast, all unknowns, shines and breathes life into the feature.  You will recognize no one here, except possible Keira Knightley, who is the gorgeous love interest in Pirates of the Carribean.  You won't even recognize her in this film, where she is such a tomboy, that her mother worries about her being a lesbian.  In fact, there are a couple of instances of homosexuality in the film, something you should be prepared to discuss with your kids should you choose to watch the film with them.
In short, I liked this film a lot.  It's a fun couple of hours.  This is one of those movies you may go back a few years later and recognize a lot of the cast who were unknown at the time.  Everyone did a great job here.",1084147200,4,1807,4.311572700296736

It included frequent British and American profanities, sex outside of marriage, disrobing girls in a locker room, lying to parents resulting in a positive outcome, ridicule for those who don't accept homosexuality, and a positive portrayal of homosexuality. These last two items would only bother those of us who remain happily politically incorrect.

For starters, it is laugh-out-loud funny, and definitely holds your attention.  I think it was really geared at young teenagers and pre-teens, but I saw it with my mother, and I was twenty years old at the time and we still had fun.  Jess (Parminder Nagra) just wants to play soccer, but her traditional, Indian parents won't hear of it.  They want her to go to college, become a lawyer and be a good Indian wife--let's not forget the cooking lessons her mom wants to subject her to, so she can cook all the curries, breads and assorted fried pastries.  The young Indian-English girl won't hear of it, and while her sister is preparing for her own wedding, the headstrong girl continues to sneak out and play soccer with the guys.  Another young lady (Keira Knightley) sees her playing, and invites her to join a girl's team.  They both proceed to develop crushes on the coach (Jonathan Rhys Myers), and then things get a little complicated......to say the least....also, the whole soccer matter can't be kept under wraps forever.
Even though I was never any good at soccer, and don't know much about the game (though, I knew who David Beckham was and that he played for Manchester United at the time that the film came out.......there is even a scene with Jess watching David--or, as her mom likes to call him, ""That skinhead boy,"" play his ""corner""), I had great fun watching Jess triumph in game after game, and enjoyed the Indian flavor that generously sprinkled out this film like fine haldi (tumeric, for those who know it by its Western name) in a savory and spicy curry, meant to be enjoyed with friends and loved ones.  Please give this one a go..........Also, encourage any young women and girls to watch it.  It is definitely an inspirational film for women of all ages, though.",1083110400,2,1889,4.6656626506024095

I don't usually buy movies because I rarely watch the same one over again, but I bought this one, so that's saying a lot.
 The director's commentary is unusually insighful and fun, too.",1083024000,,504,4.629213483146067
1483046,5,B00005JM2Y,"I really liked this movie. I find its plot refreshing, its performances outstanding and its resolution very satisfying.
The storyline combines both traditional movie cliches (girl battles against her conservative family to make it in the modern world) and more unusual features (the customs and traditions that comprise the value system of an Indian Sikh family).
Jasminda is the intellectually and athletically gifted daughter of a traditional Indian family who is trying hard to preserve its values in 2003 London. Her older sister Pinky, who also has one foot in both worlds, has become her family's role model for her. Initially rebellious, Pinky has recently entered into a ""love engagement"" with the cute Indian boy she has been seeing on the side.
With her family so preoccupied with her sister's wedding preparations, Jasminda sneaks out on the sly to play with a semi-pro women's team. During this adventure, she encounters the tomboyish Juliet and her drop-dead gorgeous coach. Both of these individuals also have their own family issues-Juliet with her very feminine mother and her coach with his overly motivated father.
The movie plays out all these family scenarios. The richest and most rewarding moments come from the Indian family dynamics. This movie lets you peer into an interesting slice of culture-traditional Indians living in 21st century London and trying to balance both worlds.
The performances are outstanding. Parminder Negra in the lead role manages a nuanced performance: she wants the world of big time soccer and modern day London but she loves and respects the values of her parents. Keira Knightley as Juliet is astonishing. She is a beautiful girl who could care less about her looks. All she wants to do is lace up her cleats. Juliet Stevenson has her mother is hysterical. Yes, perhaps she is a bit over-the-top, but she gets a laugh every time she shows up in the movie. And the actor who plays the coach manages to balance ethical integrity, athletic passion and drop-dead dreamy male lead in one performance!
The DVD has some fun extras. The director's track is entertaining and educational. The ""how to cook an Indian meal"" is fun. And the deleted scenes are entertaining.
I would recommend this movie to lovers of ""girl power"" movies as well as families who want something fun to watch together. And...it is a great movie for anyone who simply wants to be entertained for a few hours.",1080950400,2,2427,5.00990099009901
1483047,3,B00005JM2Y,"I'll admit that I allowed myself to get hype-tanned before I saw this collection of mildly amusing scenes cobbled together into a movie about assimilation and family conflicts within a middle-class Indian family in London.
You know the works. Girl figures out she is good at soccer. Wants to do something about it. And thus we get trapped in a redundant cycle of: Jess lies to mother about playing for the team, mother finds out, Jess stops playing, Jess starts playing, Jess lies to her mother, mother finds out.....ad infinitum.
See where this is going? It's quite dull and painfully repetitive, leaving us to count down the minutes until the plot reruns itself for the umpteenth time.
When the plot's not stuck in its loop, it's busy cramming in limp situations and characters. Jess' family is presented as a near-exaggeration that makes the parents of My Big Fat Greek Wedding look downplayed. Not just the Indian family, even the mother of Jess' british friend, played by Juliet Stevenson, is convinced that push-ups bras and short skirts, not shin pads and cleats, are the only way to attract a man. Both families feature the old standby of Lone Understanding Parent -- trusting, sympathetic dads -- who both exist merely to convince their grumbling spouse to give the kids a break, but only, of course, in time for the Big Finish.
On the plus side, the director succeeded in evoking a workable level of charm from the cast and the roles they play, and it's easy to see why so many people have come to like this film.  It's hard not to like these characters.  Plus, both Nagra and Knightley have the good looks, natural charisma, and honest acting talent that makes a person a bona fide movie star. The soundtrack is cool too except for that Punjabi music at the wedding that played on for a tad too long.
Yet, on the whole it winds up being a formulaic mess, not very rousing, not very interesting, and at the end of it all, not all that much fun. Recommended rental, perhaps.",1080950400,7,1983,4.662857142857143
1483048,3,B00005JM2Y,"Bend it Like Beckham (Gurinder Chadha, 2002)
Bend it Like Beckham, another movie with loads of hype surrounding it, is another entry in the suddenly-popular ""immigrants trying to fit in"" genre that Americans have been doing these days. And again, it's not a bad little film, but like Thirteen, the end result seems rather a lot of hype for something that didn't really deserve it.
Jesminder (ER's Parminder Nagra) wants nothing other than to play football (soccer, for you sport-challenged Americans) like her idol, David Beckham. Her parents think it's time to put away the game and concentrate on school. Unfortunately, just at the same time they decide this, Jess gets invited to play on an all-girls' soccer team. Please her parents or continue to play behind their backs? (The latter, of course, or there wouldn't be a movie.) Along the way, she finds herself possibly getting romantically entangled with her coach, Joe (Titus and b. Monkey showstealer Jonathan Rhys-Myers), which would cause her parents to have a heart attack. Hilarity ensues.
It's got a few laughs (rent the DVD, you'll need the subtitles to get some of the jokes), a nice if predictable plotline (which one wag we watched it with kept comparing to the TV show Saved by the Bell), lots of very pretty folks doing very pretty things. All good for a couple of hours' worth of distraction, but nothing to write home about in the ""groundbreaking new romantic comedy"" department. ***",1080518400,4,1453,4.9346938775510205
1483049,4,B00005JM2Y,"BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM is a nice example of a ""feelgood"" type of movie. You like the characters, they have some problems, but everything works out the way you want it to in the end. Further, it's an inspirational story for any young woman who plays a sport. My daughter, who has gotten onto her school's volleyball team this year, liked it a lot. The movie also has something to say about the clash of divergent ethnic groups and about traditional versus contemporary gender roles. Beyond all of that, the script contains plenty of humor and the players handle their roles well. It's very reminisent of MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING. Take that film, move it to Britain and change it to MY BIG FAT INDIAN WEDDING and you've got the picture.
With all of that going for it, though, BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM is not ""brilliant"" or ""flawless"". It's a nice flick. Nice, but very predictable. The script is clever, but the plot holds no surprises and there's not really a lot of tension. In the end, everyone emerges happy and essentially unscathed. Additionally, for non-British viewers, the dialogue is sometimes a little hard to follow.
I like this movie and I think most people will find it entertaining, but it's hardly a cinematic classic. Enjoy it for what it is, but don't expect too much. I'm a bit surprised at how some people gush over it. Finally, I haven't even watched the ""extras"" that come with this DVD, but what makes or breaks a DVD package is the movie, not the extras.

One is a featurette on the making of the movie that's charming. One is a short featurette showing the director and her mom and aunt making Aloo Gobi. The high point is, of course, the audio commentary, and here the director and her non-Indian husband add their unique and interesting perspective. The viewer can see the movie again through a different pair of eyes, which is why it's a darn shame closed captioning doesn't pick up their comments. As for the movie itself, everyone's pretty much given away the story, so I won't. Anyone reading my reviews on a regular basis knows I love coming-of-age movies.  I've seen some of the best, and I think this movie ranks right up there with them. Even though older kids are involved in this one, I found the movie very charming. It  features a culture clash on several levels: traditonal and modern, British and Asian, even young and older. But what prevails in the end is the love a family has for one another. It's a good story that younger viewers who are ready for more mature stories can see. I recommend it highly.",1077840000,,1196,4.558139534883721
1483102,4,B00005JM2Y,"""Bend It Like Beckham"" reminds me of the best of those 80's teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes.  Everything takes place in a bubble-gum colored world where everyone is attractive, there are some easily-resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly happy proceedings, and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to bouncy pop tunes.  Nothing wrong with this, however.  ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is an absolute treat from beginning to end.  My wife and I found ourselves totally won over by the cornball cheesiness even as we were making fun of it, and at the end, as embarrassing as this is to admit, we applauded (and we saw this, by the way, in our living room, not in a theatre).
Watch this movie and enjoy.

1483103,4,B00005JM2Y,"Some may disagree but this is a movie on culture clashes more so than a sports or girl power movie. While there are references to some of the intricacies of the game of soccer as well as the double standards still imposed on girls in todayfs society, the heart of the matter is integration. While some may be surprised that the UK is a melting pot of races & cultures, Bend it Like Beckham (BIB), simultaneously portrays the issues faced by a middle class Sikh family attempting to retain the tenants of their culture in the face of increasing British influence and a young woman's battle to balance her own aspirations with those of her overbearing family.
The story revolves around Jess (Parminder K. Nagra), youngest of two daughters who excels in soccer while to the dismay of her family, mainly her mother, shows no interest in boys, fashion, or cooking. During a pickup game where she as usual, runs circles around the boys, she catches the attention of Jules (Keira Knightly), who is already a star on the local girlsf soccer team. Jess is invited to tryout for the team and what follows is a series of deceptions, misunderstandings, and family crises that illustrates the tenuous balance between integration, growing up, and individualism.
Both Nagra and Knightly do a standup job especially Nagra who delivers a spot-on performance. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers provides a less than enthusiastic performance as the team's coach and both Jess and Jules' love interest. Comic relief is provided by the respective mothers of both the girls: one is having nightmares of her daughter being a lesbian, the other of her daughter showing her legs in public and bringing shame on her family. In particular, Jessfmother's laments are hilarious and show the effective parental use of guilt & shame.
In addition to soccer, there are references to homosexuality and racism that are not forced but nicely woven into the theme and add a hint of realism to the proceedings. It also provides an interesting peek on Sikh communities where social status and materialism seem to play such strong roles. Talk about image and keeping up with Joneses! However, it really is a story on how the fence is straddled between Sikh & UK and family & individual.
Its not Zadie Smith's White Teeth but it does an effective and more importantly, an entertaining job of showing what life is like inside a melting pot, this time one that is simmering with delicious Aloo Gobi. BTW: the wedding scene is wonderful, what fun!",1075852800,6,2489,4.858823529411764

Juliet ""Jules"" (Keira Knightley) sees Jess playing in the park one day and convinces her to come and try out for her all-girl team that is starting to get recognized.  Before Jess knows it, she is playing with a great group of girls and learning more soccer skills than she ever dreamed of!  There is just one small problem - her parents don't know that she is playing soccer.  Jess has to sneak out to practice and games every time and only her older sister knows.

With Jess' family dead-set against her playing, Jules' mother thinking that they are a lesbian couple and both Jess' and Jules' feelings for their coach, Jess doesn't know if it is worth it be able to...bend it like Beckham.

I thought that both Jess and Jules had absolutely hilarious families that kept be laughing during the whole film, yet, at the same time they made it so difficult for the girls to achieve their dreams.

Positive Points:
Parminder Nagra who plays Jess is really great in this film. She plays the footballing, Beckham fanatic, Asian-British girl who sneaks away to play football with such style and charm that you can't help but hope that she succeeds in her aim.
The script is fun and amusing. I couldn't help laughing at the subtle but funny references to David Beckham.
The pace of the film is steady and each scene is filled with something either amusing or relevant to the film. It never strays from what it is trying to portray.
Negative Points:
The character that Keira Knightley plays. She is just the only negative part in this film because at first she seems great because she is friendly but her impulsive nature later on in the film changes that.",1074816000,,1111,4.644670050761421
1483109,4,B00005JM2Y,"With the recent popular successes of indie or foreign films focused on non-traditional American culture, like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" and ""Bend it Like Beckham,"" it is telling.  It tells of a film consumer need that big production Hollywood isn't currently meeting.  ""Bend it Like Beckham,"" is indeed unique and heartwarming, qualities lacking in Hollywood production line productions.
British-made, we aren't left dismaying subtitles.  A small criticism is that ""Bend it"" takes a while to hit it's stride.  It no doubt will be a popular view for the soccer-(or football as the rest of the known world knows the sport as) crazed public toting young girls off to Saturday dreams of becoming the next Mia Hamm or Brandi Chastain.  Where, ""Bend it"" truly makes it's mark is the portrayal of the push and pull of a traditional Indian family making their way assimilating into a foreign culture in a foreign land.  It reminds me much of Amy Tan's ""Joy Luck Club,"" in that regards.  We are hooked with the movie when main character Jess, played beautifully by Parminder Nagra, finds a way to balance her love for a traditionally-minded family and her personal dreams of following her gifted skills to where they may lead her in the world.  It is a magical cinema moment.
The only thing that holds up this movie from the vaunted 5-star ranking is clarity of vision and need for originality.  ""Bend it Like Beckham,"" tries to be too much, all things to all people.  It is all at once a coming of age story, a clash of cultures story, a feel good sports-formula story, a girl power story.  In addition, it finds itself slightly leaning on the sports-formula crutch.
With this said, the criticism are minor, the movie is a good one.  Don't miss it.  A true kick.

1483110,4,B00005JM2Y,"Bend It Like Beckham is a thorougly entertaining movie about Jess, a girl who just wants to play football while her parents want her to be a traditional Indian girl and marry a nice Indian boy. While playing football in the park with her guy friends, Jess is approached by Juliet, a caucasian girl who plays for a girl's team and thinks Jess would be a good addition. This sets up the familiar plot where young child tries to follow her dream, gets in trouble with the parents, before a successful conclusion of all the plot threads.
Although there's nothing new in the plot of this story, it's the ethnographic details and the extreme likability of the actors that makes this film a joy to watch. Aside from the obvious gender-switching (girl playing sports), the setting (London) and the family (traditional Indian), there's a number of small touches that raise the movie above what could have been simplistic Disney fare, such as Juliet and her not-quite-similar situation where her father supports her while her mother doesn't and the young Irish male coach with another dissimilar home situation in which the father supported him too much. It's as if you get a cross-section of the possibilities of parent-child relationship, to compare and contrast and realize that for all their differences, it still comes down to the need for the child to make his or her own way in the world.
Like another ethnic take on a traditional theme, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Bend It Like Beckham succeeds because it reveals that while the food, dress, or customs may be different, parents are parents and children are children.

1483153,5,B00005JM2Y,"Never accept situations for the way they are, you got to fight! That was the message of the movie and I loved it! ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a great movie with a lot of humor and great ""football"" skills. Jess (Parminder Nagra) is an English Indian born to follow her family's tradition, but she joins Juliet's (Keira Knightley) soccer team. It's kept a secret and the team succeeds tremendously. Jess idolized the bald man Beckham and dreamed of scoring a goal by smashing the ball with her head. It was hilarious. Some moments are predictable though, but the characters were so rich and every scene was heart-felt, you can't help but like this movie. If you don't like this movie, then you have no soul and should be banished and need to go away forever.",1073692800,4,754,4.551470588235294
1483154,5,B00005JM2Y,"There were three movies out last year that examined the romantic transitions from adolescence to adulthood through ethnic family cultures that clashed with Western culture. They all focused quite a bit on the mother-daughter relationship. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" garnered the most attention, of course. ""Real Women Have Curves"" was a sweet look at a Latin-American girl's coming of age. And ""Bend it Like Beckham"" presents a similar story from an Indian perspective.
As a man who has been thinking a lot about the father-son relationship (now that I'm a father) over the past two years, I HAVE EXPERIENCED THESE MOVIES AS A WONDERFUL INSIGHT INTO THE MOTHER-DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP.
All three are refreshing triumphs of the female spirit against the subservience demanded of women by their cultures. Yet all three heroines ultimately respect the cultures. They (for the most part) successfully change their families' views on women through choosing to follow their dreams. They do so in a way that respects and holds onto their respective culture's emphasis on family, while rejecting the dominance of men.
""BECKHAM"" IS MY FAVORITE OF THE THREE. ""Greek Wedding"" is the funniest. ""Real Women"" is the most realistic. In that movie, the mother actually rejects the daughter, and we end with a view of the daughter moving on in life. We hope that a reconciliation will occur; but we are excited that the young woman has moved on with her life.
BECKHAM has great acting by little-known actors.  (Keira Knightley went on to bigger things as the female lead in Pirates of the Caribbean.)  The soccer (football) scenes are good, but this is a movie about relationships, and football is used to create tension.
BECKHAM has a lot of the humor of ""Greek Wedding"" but presents the family conflict in a more realistic way, like ""Real Women"". It does have a happy ending, though, as the mother and daughter make up. And Jess and her friend go to the US on a soccer scholarship to pursue their dreams of playing in a women's professional league.",1073692800,2,2031,4.935672514619883
1483155,5,B00005JM2Y,"If you hesitated renting this movie because of it's foreign nature or it's lack of box office success (domestically), then let me set you straight.  This is a great, funny, movie.
The story takes place in England as a young girl discovers she has a natural talent for playing soccer.  She even gets invited to join an all-girls team.  The only problem is that she's Indian and her parents are traditional.  In their mind, Indian girls need to worry about learning domestic chores and finding a husband, not playing games.  Naturally, Jess does what all teenage girls would do in this situation:  lies to her parents and sneaks off to play anyway.  The backstory involves her sisters pending wedding and what Jess' soccer playing, and erratic behavior, will do to hurt the wedding.
There are a lot of laughs, but there's also some serious drama, and the cast and crew pull it off seamlessly.  You will really enjoy this film as an escapist adventure.  Many of us don't live in England, and aren't Indian, so the enrichment we received from watching this film more then makes up for any minor weaknesses the film may have.  I really didn't notice any weakness, and my attention was riveted to the screen the entire time.
I highly recommend this film.  I don't give out very many 5-star reviews, so when a film recieves one, it definitely deserves it.",1073088000,2,1348,4.693617021276595

I totally recomed this movie for preteen girls and or ppl who enjoy football (soccer). If they would have left out all of the homosexual comments i would have given this film 5 stars.",1073001600,,513,4.244897959183674
1483157,5,B00005JM2Y,"Well, my wife and I loved this little British flick.  We popped it in New Years Eve and laughed for the entire time; even harder during the closing credits.  It is refreshing to see a movie where the young folks love and respect their parents to the point where they are willing to make sacrifices to make them happy.  I look at teens in American comedies and hope that the people writing them will go see films like Bend it for some inspiration.
The minute I pulled the flick out and put it back in it's case I turned to my wife and made the observation that my 10 year old niece would love this flick.  (I try and make it a point to pass on discs and books to her that I think will challenge her a bit yet still entertain.)  Wifey stopped for a moment, thought about it and then said that she probably would.  For the life of me I couldn't figure out why she had to think about it for a moment.  As I read some of the other reviews here it hit me.
Beckham is a wonderful story.  It is inspirational without being sappy, has wonderfully engaging characters and is wildly funny.  The girls are strong and capable without crossing the line into that brazen, in your face, nasty attitude that predominates a lot of American productions.  The message is simple but it's execution is not.  Follow your dreams, but do everything you can to not hurt those around you while you do it.  It can be a very fine line to walk.
The only thing that might turn some parents away is the use of homosexuality as a plot point.  Juliet's mother fears her daughter may be a lesbian, that Jess may be her lover and another character comes out of the closet to a close friend.  This won't upset a lot of free thinkers out there, but there are definately some parents who are not ready to explain to their kids why Juliet's mom is so upset that Jess gave her a kiss or why that other character is afraid to talk about their own preferences within their circle of friends.
My niece was born in Provincetown MA (San Franscisco East Coast, but smaller) and spent her life surrounded by gay men.  She and her mother have no problems talking about these things.  If however, you don't feel that you or your child are able to reasonably discuss these themes then hold off until you are.  Once you get to that point though, Beckham would be a great place to start.  It handles the issues with great humor and taste.
Five stars out of Five.  One of the best films of 2003.",1073001600,,2441,4.278867102396514

1483159,4,B00005JM2Y,"You don't have to be into soccer, or even a girl to enjoy this light-hearted movie. I first went to see it because I love soccer, but it was even better than I thought it would be. My guy cousins loved it, as did some of my friends who hate soccer. As you can see, it's not limited to female soccer players.
Jess, an young Indian girl, has a great talent for soccer, but her srict, tradional parents dislike her playing-- they'd rather hook her up with a nice, Indian boy or have her cook Indian food.  She joins a girls soccer league from the urging of her newfound friend, Jules (Kiera Knightly).  Of course, she does this while lying to her parents, and of course they find out and there's a whole moral about lying and whatnot.  But it's not preachy, it's enjoyable.
Bend It Like Beckham is one of best, not to mention funniest films of 2003.  The only problem I had was the confusion over the age of Jess and Jules.  It was only after the second viewing of BILB did I realized they must be around 17-18, because at the end,**SPOILER** they leave for college. **SPOILER OVER**  Americans might also be confused because the girls are shown drinking and going to a club.  This is because Europe has different drinking limits, etc. But all in all, this was a good, funny movie to watch with a group of a girls (and guys!).",1072742400,2,1323,4.353658536585366

It's not the best movie you'll ever see, but it's funny, fast-moving, and compelling and it would be hard to not like it.  Also, the portrayal of Indian culture is eye-opening.

First, I think it should be rated about PG-17. The content is mature in my opinion and the main character is older than you think (17 or 18) so younger viewers won't identify. Second, the movie embraces and seems to encourage: lying to and disobeying your parents, disregarding religious values in the home, swearing, drinking, and homosexuality. The only positive value in the movie was its' reminder of how destructive prejudice is. I hope my daughter got that part, but it had to be hard to find amidst all the negatives.
A movie with bad morals isn't necessarily a bad movie but I was looking for a movie with good morals and that's not what I got.",1072396800,12,908,4.611111111111111

1483202,2,B00005JM2Y,"I already know this is going to be a VERY unpopular review. I can see the hundreds of ""non-helpful"" votes already. Oh well, here goes anyway...
This movie is caked with so many cliches, it ruined the strong potential it had. The Indian girl with a severe burn-mark on her leg, falls in love with her Irish coach, who also happens to have a harsh scar on his leg. And it just so happens, that the Indian girl's best friend is in love with the coach. You can guess what comes next. Jealousy, bickering, and everything else. Meanwhile, the Indian girl is also battling her psychotically religious parents. Her mom is the typical of all stereotypes (I'm not even gonna bother going into the predictable intentions of this old wench. It's the basic ""don't bring shame on the family, blahblahblah, women cook this for the husband, blahblahblah, be a good Indian girl and do what your parents tell you, blahblahblah, you can't play Football, blahblahblah, marry an Indian boy, blahblahblah, don't show your bare legs to millions of people, blahblahblah""). Her father, ALSO played a sport, once upon a time (How convenient for US, eh?). Unfortunately, he was kicked out of a club and made fun of for, get this, wearing a turban. So, since the whites rejected him (because of a turban, no less), he thinks he knows what's best for his little girl.
This family has more than its fair-share of issues. As things start to heat up (at BOILING point) all you can do is duck and cover. What we're treated to, is disputes, lies, deception, racism, homosexuality, suspicion of homosexuality, accusations and everything else you can think of. Oh yeah, and guess what! The sister's wedding is the EXACT SAME DAY AS THE BIG GAME! Hey, who DIDN'T see that one coming? Ugh! And don't you just hate when someone walks in on 2 people JUST as they're about to kiss? It happens here. And not only that, as an encore to that sickening cliche, the father walks in on his daughter hugging her coach. These predictable paths have become so tiring, that it pretty much destroyed my enjoyment for the movie. And let's not forget the obligatory Indian wedding... cause afterall, no Indian movie is truly complete without one.
I saw the final act coming a mile away, too. Everything all wrapped up in a neat little package.
And let me just finish this review up nice and quick by saying Jess' mother gives the most HORRIBLE, DREADFUL, DISGUSTINGLY ANNOYING performance of the last century. Her over-the-top approach dents every scene she's in.
I hate to give this film such a low rating, because I DID see a LOT of potential. It's all pretty much wasted, in my opinion. Maybe I should watch it a second time, and see if I'll enjoy it more... but until then, this is a 2-star movie.",1071792000,7,2747,4.642710472279261

As her parents busily prepare for an older sister's traditional wedding, Jess slips out to the training ground where she catches the eye of the coach.

Complex but witty, Bend It Like Beckham is full of fun and wonder as if ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" has spurred an outing of cross -culture and -generation movies that show the compelling nature of families. This movie is a sleeper hit with a potential for a great sequel.

She gets support from friends, but they can only sympathize with her plight.

The acting is great; particularly Anupam Kher as the dad, and Parminder Nagra as Jess--they put a bit more in roles where not much is required.  On the soccer end, the editing is pretty good, and the skill level is satisfactory.

So if you haven't seen it, know that this is a fun and enjoyable movie, but not a truly great film as many would have you believe.

Two minor criticisms:  First, there were a couple of scenes where my American ears had a hard time understanding The Queen's Englsh being spoken so rapidly (even after rewinding and cranking the volume).

1483293,5,B00005JM2Y,"A delightful coming of age story with two luminous stars, Parminder Nagra (now starring on ""ER"") and Keira Knightly (most recently in ""Love Actually""), ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is great fun.
Nagra plays Jess, the younger daughter of a middle-class Sikh family, who yearns to play soccer (football in England) professionally despite her family's objections. Her best friend Jules (Knightly) is dealing with parallel disapproval - her mother believes that an athletic tomboy is destined to be lonely, lesbian or both.
While the central story of the girls' friendship, and their mutual passion for soccer (as well as their soccer coach) is immensely likeable, the ""smaller bits"" and characterizations are classic. Jess' sister howls and carries on about her impending wedding, and her mother badgers her about the right way to cook - but there's no question that Jess loves them anyways. Jules' mother, who is full of silliness, constantly attempts to understand her daughter and fails miserably, but never stops trying. Joe, the Irish coach and love interest, is inspirational to both girls but obviously wounded by his past relationship with his Da'.
Many films feature a misunderstood but plucky lad or lass, who finally achieves success and shows their families, friends, and often the world, that they were right, and everyone else was wrong.
Yes, it's a very old plot.
But in your typical film about first generation families like Jess', the older generation is painted as being out of touch with their dreams, having sacrificed their ambitions, as well as their homeland, for their children. There's something bittersweet then, if the child turns their back on their home culture and family to get success in the wider world: this sadness is evident in ""Double Happiness"" and ""Floating Life,"" two other films about Asian immigrants, in Canada and around the world respectively.
There's some gentle poking-fun at both mainstream English and immigrant Sikh culture, but ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is more realistic in that Jess doesn't really want to leave her home culture behind - she wants to live in both worlds, English and Sikh.
In one scene, her teammates pepper her with questions about her sister's arranged marriage, and later plans for her. Jess makes it clear that, while she's willing to go against her parents' wishes to play football, she agrees with their views on love and sex.
She even talks (in a non-cheesy way) about her talent for soccer as being a gift from God, knowing that this is something her parents can understand, as religious people. One more reason why this is a great movie for parents to watch and discuss with their teenagers, whatever their background - it shows that parents and kids can compromise without sacrificing common values and dreams.
Kids and adults alike will also love the fast-paced, upbeat soundtrack, including the jaunty song ""Independence Day,"" from tomboy-made-good Melanie C, formerly known as Sporty Spice. A great film for slumber parties or to give Monday night a bit of zing.",1069632000,9,3033,5.080160320641283

This movie manages to pull off all of the struggles inherent in that. There is humour that those of the portrayed ethnicity will relate to. These jokes, however, aren't so deeply enmeshed that the rest of the audience is lost. The film is, in turns, light hearted and thoughtful.

The girl dodges her family and manages to play in secret until finally her parents discover what she's been doing.

1483378,5,B00005JM2Y,"This is a wonderful story about a girl wanting to pursue her dreams of soccer stardom.  But don't make the mistake of thinking that you should have more than a passing interest in the game in order to understand and relate to this film.  All you need to know is that the Beckham of the title is the Michael Jordon/Wayne Gretzky or English soccer and that he has the ability to kick a ball along a curved trajectory, hence ""bending it"".  The basic themes are far more universal, centering around the differences between parents and children, males and females, and Western versus East Asian cultures.
Parminder Nagra plays Jesminder (Jess for short), the younger daughter of an Indian family living near London.  Unlike her sister and many of her friends, her dreams deal not with gaining a husband and having children but playing professional soccer.  As if to underscore the philosophical divide, the portrait of a Sikh religious figure dominates the living room of the family home while a poster of her idol David Beckham is the most prominent feature of her room, with both images being on the receiving end of various prayers and confidences.  Not surprisingly, Jess' traditionally-minded family does not view her obsession with football as a positive goal (no pun intended).
When she is recruited by Jules (Keira Knightley) to play on a girl's tournament team, Jess tries to balance lessons in traditional Indian cooking with her mother with surreptitious training and games.  Jules has her concerns with the possibility of impressing an American scout, and a mother that frets over the possibility of her daughter's passion for athletics turning her into a lesbian.  Toss a mutual affection that both girls have for their Irish soccer coach and you have a wealth of opportunities for confrontation, misinterpretation and cultural conflict.
The beauty of the film is that it handles this collection of familial, generational and cultural disconnects with a loving warmth and humor that alienates no one.  Differing views and goals aside, the respect and affection between all of the characters is never in doubt, and it makes for a most entertaining story.  It's a keeper!",1068681600,4,2177,5.022222222222222
1483379,5,B00005JM2Y,"Watch it!  It's about a teenage Indian girl in England who has a talent and passion for soccer and wants to play at the highest levels.  The problem is her Sikh parents are appalled and opposed to their daughter's desires.  They want her to behave like a traditional Sikh girl of her mother's generation back in India.
The film moves fast and has more than enough background components to keep is stimulating.
We first see Jess, the Sikh girl, playing pickup soccer with the men.  She has a friend-confident among the men who later confides to her that he is gay.  An ""Anglo"" British girl, Jules, recruits Jess to play on a competitive girl's team.  The girls become good friends but end up estranged for a while because both girls have more than a crush on their male soccer coach.  The soccer coach is Irish, which leads to a good twist or two, this being England.  Jules' mother overhears Jess and Jules talking heatedly about this love.  A Sikh woman spots Jess and Jules talking together and mistakenly thinks they were kissing.  Both sides-Jules mother and Jess's family think they are having a lesbian affair.  Jess's sister is engaged to be married.  Jess's un-Sikh like activities cause the family some disgrace, which threatens the sister's engagement.  The Sikh wedding is an uproarious, opulent, and fairly sensual affair.
Jess drew great empathy from me.  I was pulling for her the whole way.  The film makes you want to run out on a field and kick soccer ball into the goal.
The dialogue in the film is in a heavy British accent and often fast.  You will have to pay close attention if you like to catch all the dialogue, like I do.  The only thing that lacked credibility was the actress who played Jules.  Her acting was fine, but she looked too much like a model.  For a girl jock, her high-glamour lipstick looked ridiculous, and her body looked like anything but an athlete's.  There are many scenes where she is shown bare midriff (wearing a soccer/sports bra), and she is such skin-and-bones, she looks ridiculous.  The actress could never have played sports in her life.
You will like the movie if you have daughters that like sports, or if you just like sports, relate to cultural  conflicts, or relate to conflicts between teenagers and their parents.  My son Andrew (10) liked it because it was about soccer.  Michael  (8) likes soccer, but his attention wandered.  If you are a parent, don't worry about the mention of homosexuality.  It's very understated, and I discovered (to my dismay, of course)  that my children already know about such things.  If my kids know, your kids know.
The movie is fun, more than it is funny.  There is a little more emphasis on drama, than, say, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, but Bend It Like Beckam does have a happy ending.  It is a warm triumph of the human spirit.
The ""Lindy"" (my wife) Litmus test:  Pass.  She watched the movie all the way through with great interest.  It's the mother-daughter conflict that got her.",1068681600,4,2979,4.654510556621881

The world is not all gloom and doom with an impenetrable glass ceiling awaiting every female who would pursue their dreams. No longer do we need to sit glumly by and watch the world go to war on every issue from disease, and poverty, to the latest diet, drugs and the military industrial complex. We can now go to the movies and see glimpses of the emergence of the founding principles of a peaceful, creative world. Whale Rider did it. Honor the past and carry its spirit forward into the new century. Winged Migration did it. We all have within ourselves the ability to recognize truth without words. And Bend it Like Beckham does it. Let Gurinder Chadha create a film that testifies to her own ability to penetrate the glass ceilings of prejudice and perceived limitation. The DVD features make it even more endearing. I am going to try to cook curry from scratch now. Beckham is on my list of films that revive the spirit.

Notes:
""Gora"", a term often used by the Indians in the movie (including Jess), means ""white"" (or pale-skinned); it's not however a pejorative term (therefore unlike ""whitey"" or ""honky"").
I've seen some reviews referring to the Indian family as being ""Hindu"" -- actually, they're Sikh, with roots in the Punjab region of India/Pakistan (therefore ""Punjabi"" is their ethnicity and their language).  That's why the dad wears a turban, and also why laughing at it was so offensive to him.",1068163200,2,672,5.185185185185185
1483385,4,B00005JM2Y,"This film about a young Indian football/soccer player growing up in London is fun to watch and would be a great selection for family viewing. Jess is not really rebellious -- she just loves to watch football and play football; she is as passionate about playing as her mother is about having her become more traditional.  When she joins an organized football club, Jess is amazed at the opportunity to play in ""real"" stadiums and tournaments, but her parents want her to settle down and get more involved in her sister's impending marriage. I agree with other reviewers, that being cliche-ridden and predictable didn't really detract from my enjoyment of the film. The cast was very good and the wedding scene was quite fun.

DVD extras include a 15-minute featurette with the director showing us how to make a traditional Indian dish, Aloo Gobi, the recipe, a making-of featurette, 3 trailers, 10 deleted scenes, a music video and promo spot, and commentary by the director and co-writer. The film can be heard in English or Spanish, and subtitles are available in English, French or Spanish.

The one thing that they are adamant about is that Jess will NOT play football (soccer) because it isn't lady-like.

1483430,3,B00005JM2Y,"***1/2 ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a heartwarming charmer about a young girl's search for identity in 21st Century England.  Like ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" ""Beckham"" deals with the painful struggles tradition-bound cultures must go through as they enter a looser, more freedom-loving modern world.  The culture in this case is that of immigrant and first-generation Indians living in Great Britain.  As with all such tales, it is the young folk who feel the need to pull away from the stuffy values of the past, and who end up dragging the reluctant older folk kicking and screaming into the future right along with them.
Jess Bharma is a fairly typical teen with dreams of becoming a world-class soccer player.  However, Jess also comes from a very traditional Indian family that believes a girl should not play around with boys, show her legs in public, or aspire to much beyond marrying a good Indian boy and raising a family.  We've seen this kind of set-up countless times before and ""Bend It Like Beckam"" will certainly not win any prizes for creativity or originality.  It does, however, have a youthful exuberance and a generous spirit that can't help but captivate even the most diehard, coldhearted cynic.  Parminder K. Nagra is utterly winning as young Jess, capturing all the innate optimism and unquenchable enthusiasm of this irrepressible character.  She receives superb support from a cast of outstanding actors, both young and old, including Keira Knightley as Jules, her inspirational buddy who provides Jess with the opportunity to bring her dreams to fruition; Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Joe, the handsome young coach who provides lessons in love along with lessons in soccer; Anupam Kher as Jess' father, who turns out to have some of his own personal demons to deal with; Shaheen Khan as Jess' mother, who doesn't understand why her daughter can't be content with the pre-ordained life her parents have laid out for her; and Juliet Stevenson as Jules' mother, who proves that Indians don't hold a patent on tradition-obsessed parents.  In its quiet, gentle way, the film also confronts the issue of racism, particularly in terms of how the Indians are often still treated as second-class citizens in British society.
As directed by Gurinder Chadha, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a light-on-its-feet ""feel-good"" film that never takes itself too seriously.  The movie suffers a bit from a sitcom mentality, as when, for instance, Jules' parents labor under the illusion that their daughter and Jess are actually lesbian lovers.  The plotting, in addition to being predictable at times, often seems contrived and excessively melodramatic (the rivalry between Jess and Jules over Joe being the primary offender).  But this isn't enough to do any serious damage to the film as a whole.
Thus, if you're looking for a film that is easygoing, uplifting and comfortably old-fashioned in its demeanor and theme, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is for you.",1066435200,2,2946,5.06404958677686
1483431,5,B00005JM2Y,"David Beckham is a soccer star in Europe.  And Jess, the Sikh teenager living in London with her family, keeps a photo of him on her wall.  Her parents want her to learn to cook traditional meals and then get married.  But Jess, played by Parminder Nagra, is different.  She wants to play soccer.
Immediately, there is a clash of cultures.  And an inspiring story about going for your dream.  The British setting is refreshing, the acting is wonderful, and the story is upbeat and full of love.
Keira Knightly plays Jess's friend, who introduces her to the girls' soccer team.  There's later conflict between them as they both have a crush on the coach, played by Jonathan Rhy's Meyers. But the story is lightweight, all the problems are solved, and in spite of its predictability, there's enough tension to keep it interesting.
This is definitely a ""feel-good"" film, with ethnic clashes reduced to comedy, lovable characters and modern-day details, such as when a cell phone rings and a group of elderly Sikh ladies all pull their cells phones out of their saris.

Bend it Like Beckham just seemed like an amalgam of the two.  This movie came as a pleasant surprise.  More complex, more fun, and the movie is able to sustain and increase its energy all the way to the end.  I wish all movies had such a great sense of pace and a fun moving story that just keeps chugging along.  Fantastic script.  And kudos to the director Gurinder Chadha for putting together a memorable cast of characters and a great story.  Isn't that all we want when we agonize over the choices at the video rental store?  Oh, yeah.  This is Amazon.  Its a safe bet if you're a ""blind buy"" kind of person too.",1066176000,,783,4.222972972972973
1483433,5,B00005JM2Y,"A film by Gurinder Chadha
Every year seems to have the surprise hit movie that nobody saw coming.  Usually it is a smaller independent film (The Blair Witch Project, My Big Fat Greek Wedding) and makes a nice pile of money more than it cost to make.  Word of mouth spreads and the positive reviews come in, and more and more people start to see it.  In 2002 that movie was Bend It Like Beckham.
Jessminder (Parminder Nagra) loves to play soccer and is really good at it.  She plays with some of the boys in the park.  Jessminder is an Indian girl, but lives (and was born) in England.  Her mother is very traditional and while Jessminder has been permitted to play until now, Jessminder's mother has decided that she should grow up and learn to be a good Indian woman so she can find a husband.  Juliette (Keira Knightley) sees Jess playing in the park and realizing how good she is, invites Jessminder to play on her team in a league.  Jess does, but has to hide it from her mother (after her mother forbid Jess to play).  It was combination of Jess playing soccer still, and the fact that her coach, Joe (Jonathon Rhys-Meyers) is male.
Jessminder's love of soccer and refusal to quit playing causes a rift in her family.  Jess's sister is engaged to be married into a very traditional family who looks down on Jess's activities and Jess's mother wants her to be much more traditional.  Jules encourages Jess to keep playing and as she continues to play the risk increases of her family finding out.
This is a very sweet movie and it is a lot of fun and full of charm.  We know that nothing truly bad will happen to Jessminder, but we continue to root for her all the same.  We want Jess to get to play soccer and to be happy.  We hope that her team will do well (and with Jessminder on the team, how can it not?).  There are some layers to this movie, and even though we can easily figure out what comes next and how things get resolved, it doesn't matter.  Parminder Nagra makes her big screen debut with this movie (she has done television before this) and is excellent.  While Keira Knightley and the supporting cast is important to the movie, it is Parminder's success that is the movie's success.  She is sweet and believable and absolutely makes the movie.  This is a great little movie and I hope to see what Parminder Nagra does in the future.",1066089600,,2353,4.392609699769053
1483434,4,B00005JM2Y,"I'm a BOLLOCK when it comes to soccer.  The only thing I knew about this BLOKE, Mr. Beckham, was his marriage to Posh Spice of the Spice Girl LASS.  BLOODY STROP!!!  Okay, dropping the British dialogue aside, Bend it Like Beckham was a nice surprise.  Probably the feel good movie of the year... for England anyway.  Can you say... ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding?""
A story about a young Indian girl living in England, trying to accomplish her dreams of becoming a professional soccer player.  But all is not too easy when life hands along strict Indian family customs... oh the drama!  The movie is basically the typical clash between choosing her dreams, or choosing her family.  Let me say that the story, although conceptually simple, was very well-written and enjoyable.  It reminded me much of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" with soccer balls.
Then, comes the acting: Two thumbs up!  The acting was commendably way above expectation.  The two center characters, Jess and Jules, are quite the enjoyable duo to watch.  Their interaction with each other flows so naturally.  Coupled with good supporting and very entertaining characters, like their parents, adds a good air of humor and balance to this movie.
Probably the only thing that I personally didn't like about this movie was that the story seem to keep looping around Jess' problems with her family, over and over and over.  And each time, Jess would always try to get her way.  C'mon Jess you self-centered--, behave for once.  I lost a little bit of respect for her after about the 4th incident or so.  Also, there are some racial comments in this movie that might offend a few viewers, although they are very, very minor comments, usually regarding different lifestyles (But boy, these English aren't the tackiest of people aren't they).  But with those minor details aside, and the fact that I had to watch some of the scenes with the English subtitles ""On"" (These British accents can get pretty heavy), and had to listen to Indian Celine Dion music (Seriously), this movie was BLOODY FUN!!!  If I was a BIG soccer fan, I'd probably give this a 5 star rating.  If only basketball movies can be as good as this *cough*cough*likemike*juwannaman*cough*cough.*  By the way, does anyone else think Keira Knightley looks like Wynnona Ryder?
If your looking for something fun to watch in your FLAT, Bend it Like Beckhman will undoubtedly TICKLE YOUR FANCY!  Even if ""football"" isn't your most entertaining of sports, this movie will definitely score some points.",1065830400,,2512,4.875
1483435,4,B00005JM2Y,"I am not a sports fan, and I know very little about most games. Yet a good sports movie can often teach universal lessons about life in a way that can teach fans and non-fans alike. BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM is outstanding in this regard.  The movie tells the story of Jesminder Bhamra, and Indian girl living in England, who is passionate about soccer, and soccer's greatest star David Beckham. She not only loves the sport, she is good at it as well, but her traditional family does not support her endeavors. She plays the game in secret, but then has to confront her parents about her dream. Jes is supported by her friends Julie (Keira Knightly), her coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), and her close buddy Tony (Ameed Chura), who understands Jes' feelings of not fitting in due to personal issues in his own life. Though the viewer knows that the movie will have a happy ending, the way it evolves is realistic and moving.
The movie touches on a wide array of issues including achieving one's dreams, the importance of family ties, self acceptance, prejudice, and falling in love in a way that delivers the message without getting preachy. No doubt the movie will inspire young women who love soccer, but it will move anyone who loves a feel good film.",1065744000,,1251,4.609865470852018
1483436,4,B00005JM2Y,"From a distance Juliet and Jess appear to have little in common. But after meeting in a park one afternoon both realize that they share the love of soccer and David Beckham along with career aspirations of turning pro despite their family's wishes. Jess comes from a traditional Indian family who feels that playing soccer is unfeminine and inappropriate for a young Indian girl. Meanwhile, Juliet is resisting her mother's wishes of wearing more feminine clothes and dating boys while fearing her daughter might be a lesbian. Both families fail to take their daughter's dreams seriously. In spite of tensions at home Jess and Juliet form a good friendship while their soccer team is headed to the playoffs. It is only through the perseverance of their hard work and determination that family members relax and come to their senses that enable them to follow their soccer dreams.
BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM is a feel-good movie appropriate for the entire family. While the plot is predictable, it should not deter one from enjoying this film. The action sequences are fun and there are many laughs involved, especially with scenes including Jess's Indian family. Watching this film brings back many memories of when I played soccer as a young girl and it further validates my claim that girl's soccer is important. It is no wonder why this film has maintained such popularity since it was released.",1065571200,,1392,4.952991452991453

Despite being incredibly funny, the characters were very authentic.  I related so well to the theme of this movie as many of my friends were Indian.  I often marveled at the differences between what I was allowed to do as opposed to what their culture dicatated.
Some have stated this movie predictable and that maybe so, but in my opinion they're missing the point completely.  If you lived within this type of society, you'd understand the essence of this movie, predictable or not.  Many English people also grasped the essence, which is why it was No. 1 at the Box Office for weeks.
If you want a realistic vision of living in a multi-cultural society with plenty of laughs thrown in, then see this movie.",1065484800,,865,4.512820512820513
1483496,5,B00005JM2Y,"What makes this movie a delightful light comedy is that it cleverly makes elements of modern human drama seem human and ameanble to remedy, without ever being heavy-handed or overly caricatured. The main character is a young London teenage girl, nicknamed Jess (short for Jasminder), and born of immigrant Indian parents, who dreams of playing profesionally in a British girl's soccer team. She initially hides from her parents her practices with with a local team until her father accidentally stumbles on a TV sports report of the team in a visiting match in Germany. Not only does Jess face the horror and reprobation of her parents, but she alienates her team mate and friend (played by Keira Keagan) who shares her infatuation with the Irish coach, an earnest lad troubled by his own estrangement from his father. When the coach tries to persuade Jess' father to allow her to try for a soccer scholarship to the United States, he dicovers of how his own Irish experience of exclusion is mirrored by the experience of an Indian man who arrives in England from Uganda hoping to play cricket.
The characters muddle through all kind of misunderstandings, including Jess and her teamate's parents belief that the two girls are having a lesbian relationship. All of this is done with enough of a light touch that you end up sympathizing with nearly all the characters!

1483498,4,B00005JM2Y,"I think that it's great when movies like this get out into the mainstream land of movies. Yes, it has some stereotypes (Jules mom thinks that her daughter is a lesbian because she and her friend kissed after the football game) There are a few ""Three's Company"" mishaps (and I have nothing against Three's Company!) People comment that this is like My Big Fat Greek Wedding or Monsoon Wedding, but it happens that they also have a wedding in this movie, and like some other cultures, it is a very big affair.
Jesminder (Jess) is a big football (soccer to us) lover, and especially loves David Beckham. (who I didn't know before this movie, but is an English football star) She would love to play football professionally, instead of being a ""solicitor,"" but only plays in the park, without her parents knowledge of it. Her mom would like her to become a ""normal"" Indian woman, like to learn how to cook Aloo Gobi and marry a proper Indian man.
Jules, who plays football herself, sees Jess playing in the park, and invites her to try out for the women's team, who is coached by a good looking Irish man, Joe. Jules and and Jess seem to both fancy Joe, but he is not allowed to cross the lines of dating his football players.
While all of this is going on, Jess's sister Pinky is getting married to a man she really loves. They are allowed to pick their own husbands, and the wedding is coming up. A really good line that sums Jess up to a tee is when Pinky asks Jess in the car is, ""Don't you want this?"" Jess follows up with, ""Don't you want more than this?"" She has a dream that she will do anything to make it come true, whether it is pretending to get a summer job so she can play the sport, or having her sister cover for her so she can go to a game in Germany.
This is not just a ""boy meets girl"" story. It's about a woman who pursues her dream and maybe bends the minds of her parents along the way...",1065312000,,1905,4.25068870523416

Like an extra dose of the incredible affection the English have for soccer (""football"").
The movie expertly blends in that passion with the passion of a superb immigrant Indian family to preserve their customs and traditions, even in their home under the flight path of busy Heathrow Airport in London.
The movie raises some serious issues, but does not let the cast or the viewers get mired there. The lead character ---the Indian young woman Jess who loves soccer, Beckham, and then her soccer coach, quickly dispatches clouds of concern with her smile and strength. What she misses, the cheerful, sometimes extra loud, contemporary musical score picks up and kicks to the next movie lot.
Some might say the ending is a bit contrived. But when my wife Chris and I finished watching the movie, I went over and gave her a kiss and told her I loved her.
I still like Quarterback Bret Favre of the Green Bay Packers a little more than David Bechham, but I am getting to be more and more a soccer fan.

1483501,5,B00005JM2Y,"""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a great movie about following one's dreams regardless of any reactions from others.  It combines British and Middle Eastern cultures, especially noticed by the lead family.  It expresses happiness, sadness, family, jelousy, friendship, and much more.  Such combination of elements give this movie a highly unique theme.  This is much more than a soccer movie, it's also about discovering the trueness in people.  It corrects many stereotypes labeled toward such people.
The screenplay writer creatively expresses everything to full potential.  No one should be surprised if these efforts are honored with an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay.  While exploring such important issues, they know how to make their audience laugh.  Besides this, the production, the directing, and the acting were wonderful.

Chadka has elected to use neophytes as actors for the young girls (Parminder Nagra, Keira Knightly) and adds to this mix the talents of veteran performer Juliet Stevenson and the always reliable Jonathan Rhys Meyers, finding just the right combination of fresh youthfulness and experienced adults that makes this movie about life's clashes ring.

""Bend It"" is beautifully shot and scored, and soccer fans will be delighted with the game footage, but the real strength of the movie is in the different relationships: sisters, mother-daughter, father-daughter, newlywed couple, coach-player, same gender and different gender friendships; all portrayed with genuine affection.",1064966400,,579,5.411111111111111
1483585,5,B00005JM2Y,"I generally don't accept critics' praise for foreign movies since American movie critics tend to gush all over anything coming across the ocean.  But, this movie was worth all of the accolades and more.
The movie is a mature (i.e., intelligent, not sexual) coming of age story of an Indian girl raised in modern English culture.  The Indian traditions, of course, conflict with the European ideas, but I didn't get the feeling that the film makers were mocking Indian customs.  The girls of the family are bicultural and there were many scenes of the sisters comfortably transferring from one culture to another.
It is not a film, therefore, to denigrate one culture or the other.  The point was to show that there are differences, but a person can transcend the differences as was done by basically every character in the film.  The only clownish character was the mother of the English girl who was the best friend of the Indian lead character.
That said, let me also say that the film was often hilarious, never sermonizing, and I learned many things about the Indian culture.  My Indian friends were also pleased with the film and laughed at the scenes of the culture clashes.  I would especially recommend the film for girls and adolescent females for the film's strong statement of empowerment.  Finally, watch the end credit outtakes, they are priceless!",1064966400,,1361,4.886956521739131
1483586,5,B00005JM2Y,"The Full Monty, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Billy Elliott, Sliding Doors, East is East, 28 Days Later..and so on..British cinema is full of prime talent in acting, writing and directing. With so little expectations, all these films have surprised everyone and became box office hits worldwide, and far from being a coincidence, it was all the result of not only talent,but of dedicated hard working young filmmakers,who have fresh and very original ideas, and who got the chance to share it with the world.
These young filmmakers, unlike their colleagues in France or the US, do not have the same financial support, and some do really struggle to get their films made. Although there is the Film Council and BskyB who support movie making, the demise of the excellent Filmfour the film division of TV's channel 4(a bit similar to France's Canal +) was a blow to British cinema. But despite that, films are still being made, very successfully and artistically at a that.
What distinguishes British cinema, not unlike some European cinemas,is the close relationship and collaboration between writer and director,(if the two are not one and the same). Usually, the two are close friends, who work on the idea together for some time before securing the finances and shooting their project.
Bend it Like Beckham is another example of a little film, whose impact was huge. Director Gurinder Chadha (Bhaaji On the Beach) manages to direct a movie that takes womens football as a platform, but weaves many themes on top,friendships,dreams, traditional cultures in 21st Century Britain clashing with the  possibilty of fulfilling these dreams, one that was not available to the first generation of immigrants.
So as a result,it does not matter if you do not like football (soccer)or do not understand the game, because the film has a lot more to offer and entertain you in the process.
Chadha manages as well to write (or co write)a wonderful comedy too, which is guaranteed to leave you with a feel good feeling long after you watch it. The humour mainly comes from the parents, both Indian and English.
Chadha also manages,to show another lighter face of multi-cultural Britain, not unlike the film East Is East (and not Mira Nair's Monsoon Wedding as one reviewer saw it).
All the actors are great, especially first time actor, and very pretty Parminder Nagra(Jesse), and Keira Knightley (Jules),and  also of course the wonderful Juliet Stevenson, one of my all time favorite actresses.
Bend It Like Beckham, is a rare treat, a film that will totally captivate you, with its gentle humour, its engaging story, a must buy from the rich vault of British Cinema.",1064188800,3,2654,4.975225225225225

1483589,5,B00005JM2Y,"Parminder Nagra is an attractive, energetic 18-year-old young Indian woman living in the West London suburb of Hounslow, near Heathrow Airport and about thirty minutes by Tube from the West End.  She lives comfortably with her family and is a good enough student so that her parents are strongly encouraging her to go to law school, then marry a nice Indian young man and start a family, the same path her older, about to be married sister, is ready to traverse.
Nagra's bedroom is covered with photos of football great (soccer to U.S. fans) David Beckham.  What her parents do not know is that she is more than a fan of the great player; she is a talented performer in her own right.  When Keira Knightley visits the park where Nagra performs brilliantly against a group of Indian young men, she recruits her for the local women's team.
When Nagra makes the team and becomes a star player under Irish coach Jonathan Rhys Meyers, she does more than take a major step toward developing her football skills at a higher level of competition.  She feels an immediate affinity for Rhys Meyers, whose own budding career was dashed by an injury.  Like herself, he has had to contend with a strong-willed father.
A clash with Knightley, the person who got her the tryout, occurs when the team travels to Hamburg, Germany for a match.  Despite not wanting to get emotionally involved with Rhys Meyers due to Knightley's obvious romantic interest in the coach, the chemistry blends and Knightley catches them during a romantic moment, considering her friend a turncoat.
The plot develops toward a final championship match at Hounslow, which is held the same day as Nagra's older sister's wedding.  Her father allows her to sneak away to compete in the match, just as long as she is there for the rest of the big day in her sister's life.  Nagra needs to overcome an earlier sturdy opposition of a father who is opposed to her pursuing football glory due to his own disappointment, occasioned by racism.  As a young man he arrived in England from his native India, and ultimately believed he was not given a proper chance to develop his own athletic skills.
The briskly paced film, directed by Gurinder Chadha, who wrote the script with Paul Mayeda Berges and Guljit Bindra, moves to a satisfactory conclusion in which Nagra and Knightley become friends again.
The highly talented Juliet Stevenson is excellent in a supporting role as Knightley's mother, seeking to steer her daughter through disappointment in her love live while disdaining her vigorous pursuit of football.  In that area she holds a common view with Nagra's parents, at least until the story is resolved.
David Beckham appears late in the film in a scene shot at Heathrow Airport.  Nagra and Knightley share a laugh over the irony at seeing their hero as they prepare to depart for their own football adventures in America.",1062979200,2,2881,4.8

1483603,5,B00005JM2Y,"I will never understand Soccer. It's probably cause I was born and raised in America. It may also have to do with my proclivity to be bad at sports. But I will give anything a try once. So when the US women's soccer team was in the world cup (I guess that's what it's called) I watched the whole thing and was bored to tears.
You see I can understand why people want to play the sport. There is definitely a lot of skill involved. But after three hours of watching chicks run up and down a field, nobody scoring a goal, I was ****ed. When the US team finally won with a kick-off I felt even more cheated. All that skill only to win the game thru dumb luck. Ehhh, I could take it or leave it.
All that to say, I still liked BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, a schnazzy import from Great Britian.
BECKHAM is the story of Jess (Parminder K. Nagra, King Girl) a beautiful young Indian girl living in or around London. She has aspirations of being a great soccer player, but her Mother (Anupam Kher, Jaal:The Trap) wants her to settle down and marry. When Jess meets Juliette (Keira Knightly, The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl) a young lady who offers her a chance to play with a real soccer team, Jess's life is torn between the culture of her family and the love of the game. Which one wins out? You'll have to watch the film and see.
What's nice about a film like this is it gives a glimpse of a London we rarely see in the movies. There is a huge Indian population in the city and it such a fascinating culture. BECKHAM excels in giving us a glimpse into the tradition, and pageantry of this ancient culture without making things too over the top. I'm sure if you look at any culture, or walk of life you will find regular people who do some pretty funny things and BECKHAM showcases the Indian culture with such love and affection, but also with that touch of sweet quirkiness.
It also shows us how tradition and religion still survive in our modern world. How cultures that were once separated by miles now live in the house next door. There is a great shot in the film of Jess's family having a celebration. It's loud and boisterous and over the next hedge there's a regular British lady hanging up laundry. It's the kind of shot the say a lot without saying a word.
Parminder K. Nagra is phenomenal as Jess. I love how the script is constantly forcing her to up the ante. Pushing her character to grow up. I like how it's full of awkward moments, silly moments, tragic moments, and in the end it's so real. A lesser film would have made this movie about winning the big game. BECKHAM'S stakes are much higher. Do you follow your dreams, or follow your family? Can you do both? While the movie ties these concepts up quite nicely, it only because of Nagra's sweet and yet strong performance that the movie takes on a life of it's own and defies any contrivances.
My only qualm with the movie is a pointless and ineffective outing of a minor character. It serves no purpose in the film and in the end stops the film cold. It seemed so unnecessary. It didn't enhance the character any more. It seemed tacked on because in films like these it is necessary to have the token gay guy. But hey it's such a minor flaw that I will stop harping on it.
Director Gurinder Chadha has crafted a really sweet, good-natured film. I really liked it a lot and I hate soccer.
Hey if I liked BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM I think most people will really like it as well.",1060905600,12,3457,4.287461773700306
1483604,5,B00005JM2Y,"I couldn't believe it.  I've been looking forward to seeing this movie since the moment I first heard of it, and my expections were rather high.  In a situation like this, I'm usually disappointed by the less than stellar results, but Bend It Like Beckham was better than I expected!  It's a brilliant movie with very likable stars, though I suspect Kiera Knightly will be far more popular than Parminder Nagra when it comes to the US market.
I won't mention the story here, but it was absolutely wonderful.  While there are reminiscence of My Big Fat Greek Wedding here, it's unfair to compare the two in such a way.  I certainly think that this movie can stand on its own feet without striking the chords with Greek Wedding audiences.  It's also true that's there nothing new here, but everything is told with such refreshing honesty.  As an Asian American who've just gone through a similar experience, it was a little bit odd to watch the story unfold on the screen with such familiarity, though it made me relate to the movie on a deeper than just superficial level.  I can't wait to get this movie for my own collection!
There's just a bit here for everyone: sports, romance, cultural barriers, generational clashes and various other themes.  This isn't a perfect movie, but it certainly comes very close.  And while this may sound like the average sports flick, it isn't.  In fact, to call it just a sport flick would be sorely mis-categorizing it for it is a movie that revolves around the 2 girls playing soccer, not a sports movie revolving around soccer.",1060732800,4,1565,4.675182481751825

The characters are painted with such skill and insight that many of us may find ourselves recognizing members of our own families in the players.
I am ordering this DVD for my daughters in California and recommending Bend it like Beckham as a ""must see"".

1483606,4,B00005JM2Y,"Most films that are in any way geared toward a family audience are often hopelessly unimaginative and predictable. While ""Bend It Like Beckham"" has a lot of familiar elements, it presents them with a fresh perspective.
Newcomer Parminder K. Nagra (soon to be a regular on the series, ""ER"") is very appealing in the lead role of Jess. She's a young woman that has a passion for football (what we call ""soccer"" in the States). This doesn't sit well with her very traditional Sikh parents. They only want her to cook and be the wife of a nice Indian boy. We've heard this story before and with a more Westernized family, this would seem hopelessly dated. However, given Jess's background, this is totally believeable.
Despite the hype about co-star Keira Knightley (""Pirates of the Caribbean""), Nagra is the real star of the movie. However, this is not to discount Knightley's obvious charm. Perhaps for some, it may be easier to identify with her Jules over Nagra's Jess, but that is only because people are not looking beyond the surface details. Anybody who has ever shared a difference of opinion with their parents, will connect with Jess's situation. Knightley and Nagra are both very attractive on screen and have great chemistry together. Anupam Kher as Jess's father is another standout in the cast. He keeps the right balance of firmness and sensitivity in his role.
The film reminds me somewhat of the award-winning ""Far From Heaven"" because on the surface the film looks and feels familiar, but it incorporates elements that you usually wouldn't find in the earlier films that it resembles.
This is a good film for families with teenagers. It might be a little much for younger children. However, parents should definitely be prepared to discuss the film afterward with their children.
""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a film that supports multi-culturalism without being heavy handed or preachy. The film is generally upbeat, but doesn't dodge important issues regarding tradition and conflicts between child and parents. Importantly, the film never plays like an ""afterschool special"" insists on always being ""politically correct."" It deals with its material in an honest way, but never forgets that the number one role of the film is to entertain.
If you're tired of generic Hollywood teen films that look down on their audience, you'll really appreciate this film. It's an unabashedly ""feel good movie,"" but with substance. While not perfect, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" will leave you wondering why you didn't seek this film out sooner.",1060300800,,2538,5.016587677725118
1483607,5,B00005JM2Y,"Like everybody else, I appreciate knowing in advance if a film is poor so I can avoid it; also, I prefer to ""discover"" an especially enjoyable film rather than hear or read raves about it in advance. This is one of three films I saw for the first time without knowing anything about them, the other two being Good Will Hunting and My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Although I consider none a ""great"" film, I thoroughly enjoyed all three but for different reasons
Bend It Like Beckham was directed by Gurinder Chadha and co-stars Parminder K. Nagra (Jess Bhamra) and Keira Knightley (Jules Paxton), with Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Joe), Anupan Kher (Jess's father), and Juliet Stevenson (Jules's mother Paula) cast in important supporting roles. The film examines the struggles of two teenage girls to overcome parental resistance to their playing on the Hounslow Harriers league football (aka soccer) team. Their ultimate goal is to play for a college or university in the United States. Until a career-ending injury, their Harriers coach (Joe) played on a major professional team in England. Both Jess and Jules are attracted to their demanding but caring young coach. I view their feelings for him as being more substantial than teenage infatuation.
As is also true of so many other sports movies (e.g. Hoosiers), there is a Big Game to Be Won and, of course, dramatic tension increases as it approaches. Given the fact that her older sister's (Big Fat Indian) wedding is scheduled on the same day, will Jess be allowed to play? Will her friendship with Jules be re-established? With or wirhout Jess, will the Harriers win? If they do, how will that victory affect Joe's career opportunities as a player or coach? Will Jess and/or Jules be offered an athletic scholarship? The acting is consistently outstanding. Chadha brilliantly delineates the traditional values of Jess's family (especially her mother's), some of which differ significantly from those of Jules's family (especially her mother's). Each girl lives in two worlds, both of which compete for her loyalty. Jess and Jules struggle to keep their parents happy while working so hard to help the Harriers win the league championship. As is also true of Good Will Hunting, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and Tortilla Soup, there is an abundance of humor in this film. Many moments are hilarious, including the not-to-be-missed final credits. The film is good-natured and warmhearted throughout, even when misunderstandings threaten relationships, notably Jess's friendship with Jules. This film has little (if any) social significance but offers wholesome, delightful entertainment of very high quality. How refreshing!",1060128000,4,2663,5.166666666666667
1483608,5,B00005JM2Y,"Another intercultural drama comes from the UK, so I automatically figured it was going to be a winner,... and I was right.  Like many non-European cultures, the Sikhs expect their daughters to learn how to cook, marry nice Sikh men and raise lots of little Sikhs.  Obedience and respect of elders is expected.  Pinkie, Jessminder's older sister, is following the family tradition by getting engaged to have a big fat Sikh wedding--sorry, I couldn't resist, but the football-minded Jess is torn between trying to please her family's wishes and her own desires.  She often spends her time playing football with some male friends of hers at a park.  In fact, her bedroom wall is covered with pictures of David Beckham, who as most people probably know is the captain of Manchester United and the husband of Victoria, a.k.a. Posh Spice.  Score, 1-0.
One day, a white girl, Jules, short for Juliette, sees Jess playing and tells her about the Hounslow Harriers, an all-girl's football team headed by John.  He is impressed with her playing and not only wants her on the team, but is very supportive of her, while at the same time being the disciplinary but fair coach.  He also hopes to make the team impressive enough for an American scout to come recruiting.  Result, Jess continues playing with the team, with Jules and Pinkie covering for her.  The problem for Jess is her parents finding out.  Her passions could disrupt Pinkie's wedding if her prospective inlaws find out anything unconventional about the family.  Also, Jess's father played for the cricket team and encountered prejudice because of his race and just accepted life.  He feels that Jess's life will end the same way, in disappointment.  Jess's mother is more vehement than her husband, even praying to a wall portrait of an ancestor.  Score 2-0.
Jules's mother, traditional in a different way, has trouble connecting with her football-loving daughter.  She is fretting because Jules doesn't like to go shopping with her.  At one point, she says to look at Sporty Spice and see why she doesn't have a beau.  Jules's father is different.  He encourages his daughter's passion, giving her emotional support by helping her practice.  What both mothers have in common is that they are out of touch with their daughters and believe in traditional roles.  There's a funny scene when Jules's mother thinks her daughter and Jess are lesbians.  Score 3-0.
The soundtrack is a motley collection of disco hits, contemporary techno, and the most exotic of all, bhangra music, i.e. Punjabi dance music.  There's even a Punjabi-language of Jennifer Rush's ""Power Of Love"" that comes on.  The entire cast is marvelous, especially Parminder Nagra as Jess, and Jonathan Rhys-Myers as John.  When she's happy or sad, she is believable and someone one can cheer for or wish things could be better.  And Juliet Stephenson, whom I first saw in The Politician's Wife opposite Minnie Driver and Trevor Eve, does a wonderful turn as Jules's befuddled mother.  Also, the black footballer, Mel, is played by Shaznay Lewis, formerly with the All Saints. Score 4-0.
As for the title, it comes from a conversation Jess has with Tony, one of her male football mates and the one who turns out to be the most supportive, who says ""why try to cook when you can bend it like Beckham.""  In other words, we all have our own gifts and passions, and it's the most fulfilling to channel our lives towards that shining path.  And maybe in a more diverse world, it is possible for the younger generation to succeed where their parents didn't.  Final score, 5-0.",1060128000,2,3586,4.86963696369637

Jess' Indian immigrant parents see no future in her soccer skills. Her Mother (Shaheen Khan) finds soccer an unsuitable activity for a young woman, and her father (Anupam Kher) believes there is too much risk of disappointment. But British-born Jess is more hopeful and joins a local women's soccer team behind her parents' backs. With the help of her considerably less athletic sister,  Pinky (Archie Panjabi), and her teammate and new best friend, Jules (Keira Knightley), Jess is able to keep all knowledge of her soccer playing from her parents for a while. But when her Father discovers her deception and her championship game falls on the day of her sister's wedding, family obligations and traditions seem to stand in the way of Jess' personal goals and aspirations.
""Bend It Like Beckham"" is the latest in a string of impressive films to come out of Great Britain in the last few years that explore the everyday lives of Indian immigrant families as they try to retain their traditions while assimilating into a new culture. Not surprisingly, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is the most successful of these films thus far, because it is the most comical and accessible. ""Beckham""'s themes are universal: The goals of the younger generation clash with those of their parents; A woman tries to succeed at something normally reserved for men. ""Beckham"" is a laugh-out-loud comedy that pokes good-natured fun at both Indian and Western hang-ups and the collisions that sometimes occur between them. The film treats all of its characters sympathetically and manages to inspire the audience to root for Jess without making her parents out to be bad guys. The basic plot of ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is an old tried-and-true one, and the story does lapse into cliche in places. But ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is  a sweet, enjoyable and very funny film. It's perfect if you're looking for a some light-hearted fun at the movies.",1056585600,,2069,4.942528735632184

I was quite lucky to see it since there was a local theater nearby. It left that theater and later came back to another local theater and I went back as soon as I heard it was back! This is a great comedy for the whole family and has some dramatic moments as well which balance the movie perfectly! I can't wait to get my own copy!

The 2 films are my favorite so far this year, those films being Beckham, and Shaolin Soccer, which is set for a U.S. release this August.  Beckham however, is my favorite of the two films.  Beckham throws so much positive energy to the audience and to myself I feel as if I'm watching Greek Wedding for the first time all over again, only Beckham is even better than Wedding, which is saying a lot considering Greek Wedding is one of my all time favorite romantic comedies.  There is not a single dull moment in Beckham, and most of the laughs had me laughing through entire scenes, it doesn't get much better than this when it comes to good hearted comedies.  This film definatly deserves an outting like Greek Wedding also highly deserved, although it's doubtful for that phenomenon to be repeated, Beckham certainly does obtain the power to reach that goal.",1056067200,,1002,4.670454545454546

It is a light-hearted look at the challenges that life throws you, the heights that love takes you and the accomplishments you can acheive when you put your all in. It's funny and serious and can be understood by audiences of all ages, races, cultures, and sexes.

1483749,5,B00005JM2Y,"Throughout the movie, Bend It Like Beckham, the theme of Asian assimilation is the most common one.  There is an evident conflict that Jess, the heroine, deals with regarding her secular and religious and cultural life.  Jess is an excellent soccer player with traditional and religious Indian Sikh parents, and she needs to live a life with a strong religious foundation, while still expressing her talents for soccer.
The movie does a very good job in showing Jess' parents' intervention with her life, their criticisms and hopes for her.  Her parents regard religion as extremely important while placing a very strong emphasis on her education.  Jess' parents are opposed to Jess' soccer playing because it takes away from her religion and ""everything they [her parents] know"".
During the course of the movie, the director teaches the viewer much about Indian-Sikh-immigrants' life in Britain, or any other country.  The movie includes common phrases in Punjabi that are used in the family's everyday life.  Several examples of these phrases are ""Hai Raba!"" (= Oh My G-D!), ""chi, chi, chi"" (=bad, bad, bad), and many more.  In addition, the movie conveys many of the important values that the parents, as Sikhs and Indians, wanted to instill in their daughters.  It was important that Jess and Pinky learn to respect their elders and know how to cook traditional meals.
It is evident that in the traditional Indian culture, women were viewed on a different level than men.  When Jess finished telling her parents about joining the girls' soccer team, her father told her that she should start behaving like a proper woman.  Being a ""proper woman"" often indicates possessing the knowledge of cooking, not spending unnecessary time outside the house, and many more feminine stereotype-occupations and skills.
The movie shows a teenager's struggle to balance two cultures, which is much more difficult when one of the cultures is combined with a religion.  While Jess is involved in soccer, without her parent's knowledge, she learns to cook Punjabi dinner along with preparing for her sister's wedding.  Even on the wedding day, Jess goes to play in her final soccer match and returns to have a fantastic time at her wedding.
A phenomenon that appears in this movie in addition to Monsoon Wedding is a to-be bride's tendency to have a relationship with someone before her wedding.  This should not be seen as a generalization made about all Indian brides, but merely an indication that perhaps assimilation is seeping in and causing these actions.  These affairs may be conducted because an affair is common in many Western TV shows.  Perhaps the brides are just trying to be ""western"" and ""modern"".
Overall the movie did a good job of showing the conflict Jess had with her parents, and in the end their solution was a very sensible one.  Mr. and Mrs. Bamra allowed Jess to attend college in America while still instilling in her important values.  In the end Jess got the best of both worlds; Jess gained from the opportunities she has in living in the United States for four years and still maintaining a good foundation in her religion in culture, which will accompany her for life.
I enjoyed the movie very much.  The cast did a great acting job and really became their character.  It was difficult for me to form an opinion about what Jess should do, since I am a religious person myself.  The different teen-related themes really drew me in and kept me interested in the movie.  The soccer and challenge of getting to soccer practice, also helped hold my interest, because there was always the possibility that Jess would be caught and be forbidden from playing soccer.  The suspense and constant problems and conflict are really what hold the movie together and make it what it is.",1055462400,,3790,4.916797488226059
1483750,5,B00005JM2Y,"I will not belabor a review or description as such here, as the others who have commented have done a bang up job.  Rather, I find it more beneficial to simply offer my feelings of this touching, funny, and inspirational film to movie goers and watchers in hopes that it reaches as many people as possible.  Being a soccer fan and having read minimal descriptions of Bend it Like Beckham I was originally interested in seeing it with modest expectations.  When it suprisingly arrived at my local cinema I took a chance to see it and was greatly moved.  On the one hand there was a lot in this film that I could personally relate to: I'm Irish, my girlfriend is Asian, and I have witnessed much of cultural conditions out of which this film takes place if only in a different milieu.  Without saying to much I can tell you that Bend it Like Beckham is an ambitious film that attempts to bring many genres of typical American films together, and it succeeds in a way that I think most American films fail.  It is part romance, part sports film, part cultural commentary, part commedy, part foreign film (generically speaking and notwithstanding its being British), part feel-good movie, and perhaps even part existential film.  For anyone who may wish to see a brilliant film that is as empowering as it is funny, see Bend it Like Beckham!",1055289600,,1337,4.592436974789916
1483751,5,B00005JM2Y,"""BILB"" was a hit in Asia when it was released here last year, and it is good to know that this small movie has done well on both sides of the Atlantic. It boasts a good story, script, casting and direction and well deserves its boxoffice success. I think Roger Ebert's 3-1/2 stars review of the film also helps draw in the movie crowd. This is a refreshing movie because it provides a rare and colorful insight into the life of a Punjabi-British middle-class family living in the tight-knit Sikh community in London. The story is not just about a teenage girl (Jess) who has an obsession for playing football (or ""soccer"" as it is known in the US) but is also about the clash between the older and the younger generations that exists in every community and culture. After watching the movie, one realizes that teenagers are basically the same everywhere in the world, whatever their background or culture!

To me, the most enjoyable parts of the movie are the humour, Jess's fascination with football (and trying not to get caught by her parents for sneaking out to play the game) and the lavish Punjabi wedding scene. The last offers the viewer the chance to ""experience"" the beauty and tradition of another culture through the traditional wedding ceremony of Jess's sister. If in the movie, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" you get a Greek wedding, in ""Deer Hunter"" a Russo-Catholic wedding and in ""The Godfather"" an Italian wedding, well, watch ""BILB"" for an unforgetable Punjabi wedding complete with scenes of the hectic (and oftentimes hilarious) preparations, the elaborate ceremony itself and the marvelous songs, dance and merry-making.

Parminder Nagra's portrayal of ""Jess"" is brilliant. You will laugh at the hilarious scene which takes place in the kitchen where Jess's mother is teaching Jess to cook. Behind her mother's back, Jess starts to bounce a round of cabbage on her knees (football-fashion) until she is ""caught"" by her mother and promptly dragged by the ears back to the stove to continue her cooking lesson. Another funny scene is when Jess's mother (after realizing the futility of trying to curb her daughter's interest in football and make her focus instead on homely duties and proper feminine behavior) throws up her hands in despair and tells her husband: ""At least I taught her full Punjabi dinner. The rest is up to God.""

There are also scenes to make the tears well up in your eyes: when a tearful Jess is forced to ""hang up"" her football boots for good after her parents absolutely forbid her to play, and when Jess's best male buddy attempts to make a ""great sacrifice"" by asking Jess's parents for permission to marry her on the chance that her parents would THEN allow her to go to the U.S. to play football (confused? watch the movie for details!). Also the sad scene where Jess's father bitterly recounts the discrimination he faced as a young immigrant in Britain.

Whatever you do, don't miss this meaningful and highly entertaining movie!

Trivia: After her impressive performance in ""BILB"", Parminder Nagra has been offered a permanent spot in a future season of the TV series, ""ER"". She is to play a medical intern (in a role specially written for her). Kiera Knightly (who plays Jess's bestfriend, Juliette) also went on from ""BILB"" to land the plum role of ""Lara"" in ITV's 2002 adaptation of ""Doctor Zhivago"".",1055289600,,3352,4.832752613240418
1483752,5,B00005JM2Y,"You don't want to miss this-- it's a blend of Fat greek wedding, Billy Elliot Monsoon wedding, and the Best Sports Movies. At the end of the movie the whole audience clapped. I've been to excellent movies before w here a few people tentatively put their hands together. I've never seen such an enthusiastic applause in a theater. And the movie deserves it. We went to the big local megaplex 24 theater movie house even though this is also showing in art movie theaters. And it was sold out, filled to capacity.
This is a movie about a young woman's struggle with her Sikh Indian parents' rules and traditions versus being a contemporary adult who talks the same talk as all the other British kids and British Indian kids who, outside of the house, away from the parents are like any other older teen.
The acting is superb. We have some great new faces destined for stardom. The music is an awesome blend of western rock and pop and Indian contemporary music.
Good stories are built around characters who fascinate us, who we relate to, who we care about and this movie introduces a whole batch of them-- at least six superb actors who you will look forward to seeing again. They played out a script that provided the actors with wonderful characters who made complex, difficult decisions and showed brilliant flawed humanity.
This is a movie about clashing cultures and how real people adjust to those clashes. The World Trade Center Bombing was also about that clash of cultures. This movie does a beautiful job of showing how such clashes, fraught with strong emotion and opinons, can be worked out for a positive outcome. I'd like to see a similar movie with a clash between westerners and the Islamic world. It's important to build bridges through humor and positive emotions. This movie was fabulously successful at doing that.
When we left the theater we felt great. This movie has something for everyone-- the drama of rebellion and the risk a child takes defying parents, romance, sports and plenty of humor. If this is bollywood-- India's answer to Hollywood, I'm ready for more!",1055116800,,2088,4.754820936639119
1483753,5,B00005JM2Y,"There has not been a better feel-good movie released this year than Gurinder Chadra's ""Bend It Like Beckham."" Made up of equal parts ""Monsoon Wedding"" (moving the Hindu family from India to England) and ""Breaking Away"" (substituting soccer for cycling and girls for boys), ""Beckham"" is guaranteed to have you leaving the theater lighter of heart and step than when you entered. At the heart of the film is Jess (Parminder Nagra), whose love of soccer horrifies her devout Hindu family and even endangers her sister's wedding into an even more traditional family. Encouraging Jess is her new friend Jules (Keira Knightley), star of the local girls' soccer team, who tells entrancing tales of professional women's soccer in America. But their shared attraction to Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), the team's brooding coach, soon causes trouble. Meanwhile, Jules' prattling mother (Juliet Stevenson) starts jumping to conclusions about what she perceives as her daughter's masculine behavior. It's no surprise to know that all these conflicts get resolved happily, with whipped cream and a cherry on top. That's the pleasure of a movie like ""Bend It Like Beckham;"" you go to see something that will make you feel good, and you get it, only seldom do you get it done so expertly. (The set of ""Beckham"" must have been a happy place to work, judging from the outtakes shown during the end credits.) ""Bend It Like Beckham"" takes us to its own sunny little world, and for two hours persuades us absolutely of its reality, and of the possibility of realizing all your dreams.

She was hilarious as were Nagra and Knightley. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was an interesting choice as the romatic lead, but he pulled it off well.

1483756,5,B00005JM2Y,"Director Gurinder Chadha shows us, with her movie, one universal truth about women and men: when facing an obstacle, women tend to ""bend"" it while men tend to fight against it. This message is  amply and reliably illustrated in the film through the stories of Jess, Jules and Joe. Jess and Jules (the two girls) face their families' opposition to their wish to play football. It is interesting that the director has chosen two British girls of different cultural backgrounds (Jess's family is of sikh Indian origin, while jules's is white anglo)to show the opposition that they face is not a cultural issue, but a gender issue: to play football is not considered ""femimine"" and so, the girls will scare away potential husbands; and at least for these two different cultures -as well as many others- a woman without husband is an unhappy unsuccesful woman. On the other hand Joe, the boy, has broken his relations with his family and stopped talking to them, because of a problem also concerning football. But breaking with their family is something the girls -especially Jess- do not even consider doing. And we have a very good time seeing how Jess tries to ""bend"" her family's opposition -a charming family, with a father and mother reminiscent of Tevye and Golde of The Fiddler on the Roof-throughout the whole film. For the director the term ""bend"" is a metaphore: the character tries to do with the obstacles as Beckham does with the ball, that is, to curve around them or above them without ever clashing. Wonderful performance of every actor -the writer-director loves her characters and it shows-, good music, visual feast .... the ultimate feel-good comedy with quite a good, well chosen and well illustrated message. It seems unbelivable that it was made in eight weeks and with such a low budget. Not to be missed. Well done Gurin-dah!",1054425600,4,1846,4.86031746031746

While our family has hosted multiple foreign exchange students, our world is very far removed from that of an Indian family and one that isn't living in it's native country so the cultural education was excellent.

Bend It Like Beckham is the story of an Indian girl. She really likes playing football (also known as soccer, for those of you that live in the U.S.A.) and has a talent for it. Her parents, however, don't believe football is a good hobby/career for a girl. When the girl is asked to play on a women's team, she has to sneak out and play. Also, in this movie there is an English girl who's father is okay with her playing football and her mom isn't. This girl becomes friends with the Indian girl and they play on the same team, but they both develop a crush on their Irish coach.

1483850,5,B00005JM2Y,"A film that's sure to hit the ground running this spring/summer, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is one feature that's neither hit or miss, but is spot on! Jes (Parminder Nagra) is an Indian teenage girl making inroads as a member of her Hounslow, London-based football (soccer in the U.S.) team. But, her strict parents have other ideas about her future, as they wish for her to pursue a life in the academic world, and that sports plays no part in their worldly culture. Jes' best friend Jules (Keira Knightley) somehow gets caught up in Jes' somewhat misguided adventures - both on the playing field, as well as in both hers and her best friend's family fiascos, and the recipe calls for a delightfully funny movie that never lets up from the get-go! However, there's one small insignificance which may baffle many a viewer - although Jes keeps her football playing activities a secret (in accordance to ""BILB""'s storyline), it is well-known that Jes' parents know about her football activities, thus being strongly against them. Along the way, both Jes and Jules have designs on their coach (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). Jes and Jules' friendship is suddenly tested when Jes is seen (by Jules) in a scene featuring a warm and tender moment shared with Coach Joe. Jes' mettle with the rest of her team is tested as well, as both she and Jules are up for an athletic scholarship at an American university. As the big day of the local championship game arrives, Jes must choose between attending her sister's wedding and her huge match, of which she is ordered by her father to attend the former. But, seeing as how important the latter is to his daughter, he decides to let her attend the match, and therefore wants his daughter to be happy, which is only right. Of ""...Beckham""'s funnier moments, one of which features a scene with Jes about to kick the deciding shot, when she envisions her family (instead of the members of both opposing teams) standing in the way, attempting to discredit the goal (this is where she has her sister's wedding on her mind, by the way), is the best and funniest moment in the entire movie! This is just one of ""BILB""' priceless ""snapshots"". Even Juliet Stevenson's performance as Jules's mom would pass as a dead-ringer for Hayley Mills! Everything aside, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" doesn't break (nor bend) when it comes to capturing the perfect essence of a spectacular comedy/drama. So, all that's left to be cleared up is do the girls get their scholarships, and do they get to spend an ""ultimate eve in eternity"" with their coach? The answers to this and similar questions are waiting just for you and yours at a local theater today! Oh, one more question which may contain an answer: Could a sequel be in the works? Let's keep our fingers crossed! It also features a brief cameo of British football star David Beckham. What more could a sports freak ask for?",1053993600,,2882,4.720238095238095

1483853,5,B00005JM2Y,"A friend in London (England, not Ontario) convinced me that I had to see ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" (along with praise from Sundance and the Toronto Film Festival) so lo and behold, one dreary spring day I stepped into a surprisingly crowded theatre (I wasn't sure of a British comedy's marketability in North America). ""BILB"" proved every bit as wonderful as my friend said, and in a nutshell is a sort of cross between ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding.""
Jess, a Londoner of Asian descent, plays football in secret since her parents strictly forbid it and want her to grow into a nice, traditional Sikh girl who can cook a full Punjabi dinner. Jess, however, has other plans. She teams up with Jules (short for Juliet), a fellow footballer, and the team coach Joe and an American scout eagerly appraises the two. Along the way Jess has to survive her sister's frantic, bipolar engagement and wedding, come clean to her parents about her joining the team, fights over her blossoming romance, and learns to follow her heart. Jess confides her worries to her David Beckham poster that hangs over her bed. Her room is filled with Beckham memorabilia. Jules' mother is similarly against her daughter playing football, convinced that she must be a lesbian since she favours sports bras, has short hair and wears boyish clothes. The two girls hang out often, finding more similarities than differences, but when Jess nearly kisses Joe, Jules is furious, having eyed him for herself, and a stony rivalry ensues.
The film is doused with Indian culture, including saris, salwar kameez, samosas, Bollywood musicals, singing game shows, bhangra rock, and more, but always finds a more or less comfortable balance between Indian and London cultures. The unbelievably colourful, extravagant wedding was one of my favourite highlights of the film since I adore bhangra rock and Bollywood. The soundtrack is similarly influenced, with many Indian pop songs, and my favourite of all, ""The Power of Love"" cover (Sitam version) by Amar. The cinematography is at times used for comedic effect, as in rapid cutaways to see the dazed/shocked/delighted expression of parents and relatives, in dizzying, rapid-fire football matches, the colourful exuberance of the Indian wedding, the sizzling energy of a German nightclub, and at times timed shots to capture the beauty of day turning into dusk.
The movie is blessed with a strong cast, a great story, and characters that draw you into their worlds, worries, and triumphs, not to mention a catchy soundtrack, great football action, and a tender romance. ""Bend It Like Beckham"" will certainly join my other honoured favourites such as ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding."" Oh, and look for a ""There's Something About Mary""-like singalong/bloopers during the credits.

This was yet another time (the first having been ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"") that I got my sister Lorraine to go see a movie she knew nothing about, and she was laughing hilariously at the goings-on. Shouldn't have any problem enticing her to something else in the future.
""BILB"" concerns a young Indian girl who lives in England with her family. Rather than what we'd call on this side of the pond her getting ""Americanized"", Jess is getting ""Anglicized"", becoming more interested in the British sport of football (soccer to us Yanks) when her mom wants her to learn how to cook traditional Indian meals and help plan the older sister's upcoming wedding. Thus, Jess is compelled to join a girl's team on the sly, and much of the comedy of errors that ensues arises from misperceptions of what's really going on by the Indian family, as well as by the British family of Jess' newfound pal, who has something of a crush on the football coach, Joe.

1483855,4,B00005JM2Y,"""Bend it like Beckham"" is a very charming film about two girls in England, Jess an Jules, both of them aspiring to be football players.  But the only problem is, that Jess Bhamra, who dreams of playing football with her idol David Beckham, belongs to a family moved from India, and the mother and father are not happy about her decision.  And there are more events of life to come, which would eventually make the whole things much complicated, and that is a handsome coach named Joe who helps Jess persue her way.
Culture-clashing comedy in UK is nothing new -- we have already seen ""East is East"" -- but what ""Bend it like Beckham"" offers is its charming leading roles played by Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley.  Most incredibly, Keira Knightley was in one of the most commercially successful film called ""Star Wars: Episode I,"" but, none of us probably remember her.  (The reason concerns the way George Lucas used her, which I shouldn't disclose, so check it out for yourself.)  What Hollywood people missed is here revealed fully on the screen -- in short, these girls are radiating with their natural charms, which are simply irrestible.
The story is full of familiar moments and devices, we have to admit.  But the fresh charms of the likable and lovable characters, and surprisingly effective turn from Jonathan Rhys Meyers (""Velvet Goldmine"" and others) as understanding Coach Joe (cast against type) help greatly to make us forget some of the minor flaws found in the script (Juliet Stevenson's mother's portrayal is often embarrasing, for instance), and as a whole the film goes on always pleasantly.  You will know, after a few minutes, that you cannot hate this film at all.
The only complaint is its title, which might sound a little incomprehensible to non-football fans (and in that case you might not notice the cameos of ex-pro-footballers like Gary Lineker, former ace striker of England); well, but if you know  a bit about this sport, you see the meaning of the title and its implication.  David Beckham, star player of Manchester United (and husband to one of the Spice Girls), is so good at doing a freekick, and his techinique to bend the ball's course is really amazing.  Like him, Jess changes her ball's course as is depicted in the film, and possibly her life, too.",1052352000,,2297,4.792405063291139
1483856,5,B00005JM2Y,"Jessie has a problem. She is a young Sikh girl living in England who is also a very talented soccer player with an opportunity to play on a women's soccer team that is scouted by American scouts looking for women to play professionally in the United States. Her problem is that her family, however, is adamant that playing soccer is not one of the desirable qualities in a prospective bride, and insists that she instead give up playing soccer and concentrate instead on learning to cook Indian food.
Thus the central conflict is one of the most unique and delightful films of the past few years is created. This is a movie with many, many excellent qualities, and not a few ironies. For instance, Jesminder Bhamra a.k.a. Jess or Jessie, the heroine of our story, is an exceptionally nice girl. Unlike many of the other Indian girls, she doesn't sneak off with guys and engage in sexual behavior that would outrage her parents. All she does is play soccer. Yet, time and again Jess is the victim of narrow-minded prigs, who constantly fantasize that she is doing things that she shouldn't. At times, it seems that she absolutely anything she does leads to misunderstandings and condemnations.
Parminder Nagra, who plays Jess, is utterly adorable and loveable. If this movie engages you emotionally, it is because you feel so deeply her plight and the seeming impossibility of her situation. She is a girl who has a chance to become so much more than her peers, but who is constricted by a narrow and parochial understanding of the proper role for a girl. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who played the central character of Brian Slade in VELVET GOLDMINE, is Jess's coach. Keira Knightley, who starred as Lara in a recent TV version of DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, is excellent as the girl who first sees Jess playing soccer in the park and recruits her for her women's team, and who later becomes her friend. But apart from Parminder Nagra, no actor or actress adds as much to the film as the actress who portrays Jess's mother. Her hysterics, her despair over her uncooperative daughter who resists the role she has planned for her, her frequent emotional explosions provide many of the film's funnier moments. But as good as the supporting cast is, the character of Jess has to carry this film, and Parminder Nagra utterly succeeds in doing so.
Apart from the central conflict of Jess versus the expectations of her family and community, the thing I enjoyed most about this film was the incredibly vivid and full picture of the Indian community in which Jess and her family live. The viewer really becomes a part of this very distinct world, and while the director clearly sides with Jess in her aspirations to engage in activities frowned upon by that community, he nonetheless treats it with tremendous understanding and affection.
One of my favorite movies of the past year, and an absolute must-see picture.",1052265600,,2890,4.805220883534137
1483927,4,B00005JM2Y,"Bend it like Beckham has been explained by alot of the other reviewers, so i don't wannt to go to much into the name, but im going to start abit with David Beckham. Becks is our most known sports person. He is married to Posh Spice, who he is usally in the tabloids with under there name 'Posh and Becks' and is also seen in the sexiest men awards and polls that seem to happen every week. He is also somebody who at the World Cup 98 got send off to our rivals Argentina, and with him being a major part of our team, we just couldn't cope with just 10 men, and we latter lost on penalties 5-4.
This caused many tabloids to hate him, diss him, and some even tried to kidnap his son brooklyn. But the way he reacted to this, showing so much strengh made everybody love him, and has now become the nations favourite father and husband. He is so big in Europe and football(not soccer) countrys that recently people who are not even from England tried to kidnap his family, now with another son Romeo, and hold them for ransom. this was stoped by a taloid paper who was undercover on the operation, and the people have recently be sentenced.
This is only a small part of Becks history. He is a nations hero, and this film was amde during the world cup 2002, when beckham and England would later face Argentina, beating them 1-0, from a goal which Becks scored. So with this name on the film, it was bound to sell tickets, but it deserved it on its own merits to.
This is more of a description of becks ofcourse, but i hope it helps you know more about him, and his strange and very interesting story, and will let you be abit more opened minded about the film which ive heard some are unsure about as the title is unfamilar.
Oh and 'Bend it Like Beckham' Is about the way he can kick the ball, once scoring from the half way line, one of the very few to ever do it, and the way he scores free kicks, making him the best free kick take in the world.",1052092800,5,1943,4.156498673740053

It's more than just a coming of age movie.  It's about family, morals, friendship, love, endurence and achivement.  Something that lacks in most movies not to mention most people. The acting is wonderful, the scenes in England and Germany are great mostly because they are my two favorite places for holiday.  Great music score combinding American songs with Indian words. I only hope this inspires Hollywood to create more films like this and it proves again that you don't need sex and special effects to sell a film.

1483929,5,B00005JM2Y,"What brilliant film!  I absolutely adored it!  Anyone who dismisses this film as a ""soccer flick"" definitely needs to give it a second look.  Despite it's soccer-themed title, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a fabulous and heart-warming story about family, traditions, friendship, love, fulfilling your dreams, and - yes - soccer (or football to non-US audiences).
In the center of the story is Jessminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra), a young Indian girl living in England who desperately wants to be a football (soccer) player.  On the one hand, she is incredibly talented, but on the other, she has very traditional  parents who believe that Jess should (a) go to university, (b) become a solicitor, and (c) marry a nice Indian boy.  But Jess has dreams of her own and when she is approached by Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley) while playing soccer with the boys at a local park, she secretly joins Jules' local all-girls ""football"" team.  Jules and Jess become close friends but conflicts arise when both girls fall for the same boy - their coach Joe (the handsome Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).
There are many, many highlights to this film.  First of all, it is incredibly entertaining and funny.  There are definitely parallels to ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" as Jess' family life is thrown into chaos as they plan for her sister Pinky's ""big fat Indian wedding"" (complete with quirky, colorful relatives and friends). Secondly, it has a very talented cast led by newcomer Parminder Nagra (who is wonderful and earnest as the young woman in conflict between her dreams and her family traditions), the beautiful Keira Knightley (who will soon become a household name once ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" opens this summer), handsome heartthrob Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (rumored to be in the running to be the next James Bond), the hilarious Juliet Stevenson (as Jules' prissy mom who is appalled that her daughter would rather play sports than go shopping with her) and Shaheen Khan (as Jess' no-nonsense mom who is equally appalled that her daughter would rather play sports than learn the finer art of Indian cooking).  Thirdly, the production values, script and acting are top-notch, bringing to mind similarly quirky, enjoyable coming-of-age and feel-good films like ""Muriel's Wedding"" and ""Princess Diaries.""
I honestly cannot find fault with this film.  I came into the theater without any pre-conceived expectations and came out loving it and wanting to see it again!  This movie is definitely on my DVD must-have list. I can't wait to own it so that I can watch it again and again.  Anglophiles, soccer fans and anyone who enjoys top-notch romantic comedies must see this movie.

1483932,4,B00005JM2Y,"In England, David Beckham is a sports hero comparable in the United States to a combination of Michael Jordan, Dan Marino and Mickey Mantle all rolled into one. Football in England means S-O-C-C-E-R.
Jesminder (Parminder Nagra) is a Soccer fanatic, a major fan of ""Becks"" (David Beckham) and a genuine talent at playing soccer. Her family is not at all thrilled at the thought of their daughter on the soccer field, bare legged and sweating playing the game of football.
But Jessminder can't help herself: she's not only talented but driven and nothing can stop her from playing even if that means lying and hiding to do so.
Director, Gurinder Chadha directs carefully balancing Jesminder's strict, traditional life with that of the ""real"" world: boys, booze and sports.
Ultimately, the decision to play soccer or not is placed on Jess' shoulders and, in the end, she chooses what is right for her. ""Bend It"" is all about personal choice and how it affects our standing as individuals and our personal worth. Making a decision and sticking by it is more important than the actual decision itself.
""Bend it Like Beckham"" is important because it validates the outsider, the minority: one whose choices are seemingly narrow because of preconceived notions about her race, color or sex. Jesminder is a winner because she doesn't allow society to place limits on her potential and because she chooses to be one despite all the roadblocks that stand in her way.",1051142400,2,1455,4.91869918699187

Parminder K. Nagra as heroine Jess is lovely--vulnerable, yet feisty. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as coach Joe is not only good in his role, he's one of the most photogenic young men to grace the screen in recent times. (Watch out for this young man! He's got real star quality.) Keira Knightley as team-mate soccer-player Jules is delightful, as is Frank Harper playing her dad. The one jarring note in the casting is Juliet Stephenson (of Truly, Madly, Deeply) who is out of her depths and not entirely credible as the lower-class saleswoman mother of Jules. Otherwise, this is a laugh-a-thon. Don't miss the credits! They're the perfect grace note to a wonderfully enjoyable film.

1483934,4,B00005JM2Y,"While we in the United States like to think of ourselves as the movie moguls of the world, in reality, we are a close second to India, a country fascinated by its own television and films. For a long time now, Indian films have been unavailable in the United States, and for the most part, this still holds true. 'Bend it like Beckham' isn't really an example of the Indian invasion the way Monsoon Wedding was. 'Beckham' was made in England, produced in England, and is spoken in English; however, it has a very non-English tone. Ms. Chadha has taken some of her Indian heritage and culture, and has soulfully mixed it with the incredibly overdone sports/romantic comedy cross sell. The result is a movie about soccer (football),... or rather, football (soccer). Not entirely true, it is also a movie about stereotypes, and how stereotypical our stereotype analogies have become. In many ways, stereotypes are boring now. Thankfully, 'Bend it like Beckham' handles some of the more expected heresies with light hearted humor and essentially good-spirited characters that just need to 'get with the times'.
Parmindar Nagra plays Jess, the daughter of Sikh parents. Jess feels she can do nothing but dodge all her parents wishes and upbringing and become a soccer player. She becomes friends with lesbo look alike Juliette and falls in love with her Irish coach Joe. As complications arise, Jess must learn to value her parents values, while her parents, in turn, must learn to value hers. Needless to say, the potential romance with a white boy and potential lesbianism with a white girl all add to the situational comedy. There isn't really any new material here, save for the soccer and Indian costuming of the lead characters, but, there is a distinct freshness about the method. Chadha has breathed - not new life - but fun, into an old genre. Only the most jaded viewer will have difficulty enjoying this soccer/Rocky/Monsoon Wedding mish-mash. And if they don't enjoy it, they will at least seen an early glimpse of Parmindar Nagra, who can not only bend it like beckham, but whose down to earth beauty and carefully non-stylized acting puts her in the running for actresses to look out for. Also, as multiculturalism grows and ferrets out the still greater challenges ahead against it, it is nice to see the outakes of such an amazingly multicultural production in Beckham's closing credits. Some truly diverse talents have come together to make a truly diverse, fun, and funny film.",1050969600,8,2490,4.9168646080760094
1483935,4,B00005JM2Y,"Gurinder Chadha, director of ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" has struck the same chord in audiences that made ""Big Fat Greek Wedding"" such a smash hit.  She describes the clash of cultures that may prevent a British teenager of Indian descent from following her dream of becoming a soccer star.  Jesminder Bhamra, known as Jess, worships the British soccer phenom, David Beckham.  Jess herself is a natural athlete who has all the right moves and great athletic potential.  However, she also has two traditional Sikh parents who want her to marry and attend university.  Jess's parents are horrified when they discover that their daughter is sneaking out behind their backs to play soccer.
""Bend It Like Beckham"" succeeds mainly because of the charming and ebullient performances of its two young stars, Parminder K. Nagra as Jess and Keira Knightley, as Juliette, a beautiful blonde who recruits Jess to play on a woman's soccer team.  The supporting performances are all fine, with special kudos going to Anupam Kher and Shaheen Khan as Jess's parents.
The plot is a takeoff on the Rocky formula.  Can Jess buck her traditional parents and the expectations of what is proper to become a professional soccer player?  Will her ambition bring scandal to her family and put a monkey wrench into her sister's wedding plans?  All of this is played with a light comic touch that is pleasant and entertaining.  See ""Bend It Like Beckham"" and bring your teenaged daughter.  Both of you will enjoy it enormously.",1050796800,9,1496,4.944
1483996,5,B00005JM2Y,"This is a terrific movie! It is well written, the cast is superb, and the direction provides just the appropriate touch. The story incorporates comedy, romance and individual achievement with sports and cultural differences as the issues which provide the dramatic cohesiveness. It is the universality of athletic endeavor that both inspires the main characters and can resonate with the audience and what differentiates this from the themes of such superficially similiar films as MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING. We actually had hoped to view BECKHAM last summer after reading an entusiastic review during a brief stopover in South Africa, but the theater was sold out. Thus, we were very glad to see that it is now being shown here, and determined to see it immmediately although it is still in limited release.
Parminder Nagra is perfectly cast as Jessminder Bhamua (Jess), who lives in England with her parents who have immigrated from India. She loves soccer (Beckham is an English soccer star instantly recognizable in that country and Jess' idol) but her parents do not view participation in the sport as appropriate for young women. They believe that she should either attend university or get married; her older sister's proposed marriage is an integral element of the plot. In addition, they believe that she has no future in sports, both because of her gender and discrinination due to her Indian heritage.
Juliette (Keira Knightley) sees Jess playing a pickup game in the park with some boys and convinces her to try out for the girls team on which she plays. The coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is skeptical until he sees Jess' skills; Jess joins the team and soon bonds with Jules (Juliette), whose mother is both appalled and clueless concerning the sport and her daughter's love for it. For this review to do justice to the incredible number of subplots would make it almost as long as the movie script itself, however they add both depth and many comedic moments. One of the most important involves the attraction of both Jess and Jules to Joe, who is coaching girl's soccer after  blowing out his knee while trying to live up to his domineering father's expectations for him as a player. Another crucial to the outcome involves the discrimination experienced by Jess' father, a star athlete in Africa, after arriving in England. The social commentary is rampant, and the conflicts which Jess faces seem impossible for her to resolve at times, thus making universal the experiences of people everywhere (especially teenagers) faced with difficult choices between aspirations for the future and connections to the past and present.
The actors are universally good, all the family members are integral to the story and their performances add immeasurably to the viewer's enjoyment. The cinematography is also first rate; the sports sequences are excellent; however, the colorful scenes of the traditional Indian wedding ceremony are the most memorable. This is an inspiring story, and hopefully it will emerge into broad distribution here as it did in England last year. (Of course, they know who Beckham is.) You will leave the theater feeling good about Jess and the potential of the the human spirit.

1483998,5,B00005JM2Y,"There was much debate over the title for ""Bend it Like Beckham."" It was deemed too unappealing and was thought the title would hurt the film's box-office performance, despite its tremendous overseas success. But the title is like the movie itself--smart, original, and unique.
It refers to English soccer superstar David Beckham and his ability to curve a ball straight past the goalie. He's a hero to Jess (Parminder Nagra), an Indian girl residing with her traditional, hard-headed family in England. Jess is torn between being a dutiful younger daughter and her overwhelming passion for soccer. When Jules (Keira Knightley) spots her playing with a group of local boys and is awed by Jess' talent, she invites the Indian girl to play for her team, coached by a charismatic young Irishman named Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyer), who they both fall for.
Jess' father (Bollywood actor Anupam Kher) holds a grudge against the English but is soft-hearted toward his daughter. Jess' mom (a wonderful Shaheen Khan), who is preparing Jess' older sister, Pinky, for her wedding, prays that Jess will forgo her obsession with the sport for marriage and a life cooking Indian food for her future husband and family. Jules' mom (a hilarious Juliet Stevenson) tries to sway Jules into Wonderbras and girly clothes. But Jules, strong-willed and independent, is sure of her future: She wants to play soccer in America and nothing, not even her crush on Joe, will stop her.
Mix-up's, family complications,  a beautiful Indian wedding, and a neat resolution all follow.
Like last year's equally thrilling ""Monsoon Wedding,"" ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is terrifically fun entertainment; wonderfully shot and acted, instilled with spirit and life and able to woo us with its exhuberant freshness despite a triumph-over-adversity theme we've seen many times in different incarnations. It's explores the culture clash beautifully, and despite the predictabilty, it's a winner in every sense of the word.

Already a HUGE hit everywhere around the world, especailly the place it was filmed, England, it is finally coming to the united states and expanding slowly.  With war coverage on the news 24/7, people need a place to escape reality these past couple of months, and thats why the biggest hits this year (Bringing down the House, How to lose a guy in 10 days) are light hearted comedies.  This is a movie you can go into, forget about all of your worries and troubles for two hours, and come out feeling refreshed, uplifted, and extremely happy.  The storyline is pretty simple;  an Indian family in England won't let their daughter play soccer anymore.  If you are looking for a bunch of rolling on the floor laughs, you won't find them here, but the script is funny, witty, and definately will bring forth more than a few chuckles.

This is director Gurinder Chadha's film from start to finish. She conceived it while watching England in the 2000 European Cup.  And she nailed it.  I mean, absolutely nailed it.  There's not a single misstep in this film.  Forget about whether or not you like or understand soccer.  Forgot about whether or not you're into ""foreign"" cinema.

And that's ""Bend it Like Beckham""s strongest asset. It's the characters that one can relate to. You can cry with them, and you can certainly laugh with them.
And even though the plot is formulaic, it's because of the characters, that the audience(including myself) is conned into thinking this is a truly special story (by the end, that's exactly what you'll be thinking). And that's a sign of great filmmaker, who believes in their work and loves their characters, which Gurinder Chandra obviously does.
It helps that the director, Chandra, was able to find a stellar cast. Parminder Nagra is perfect as the endearing Jess, and Kiera Knightley is wonderful as the somewhat naive, but truly caring Jules. Also, Juliet Stevenson nearly steals the show as Jules' hilarious, and slightly daft mother.
I think the movie relies on hopes and dreams of an individual as much as the importance of strong family ties. You may be laughing throughout the whole film, but when it's over, that's what sticks with you. That along with that big, fat smile on your face.",1050278400,,1178,4.836633663366337
1484002,5,B00005JM2Y,"This movie will be compared frequently to MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING.  I really like GREEK WEDDING and thought it was full of laughs and was a ""feel good"" movie.
BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM has many elements in common, particularly a character in opposition to the wishes of her parents.  However, the lead character very much respects the culture of her parents, and her conflict doesn't come because she feels the ""old ways"" of her parents are outdated or silly, but because she is torn between the ""old ways"" and new ways.
The main character is a teen, just out of high school, Jess, who is a Sikh.  She's a lovely, intelligent and sensitive young lady with a great sense of humor who also loves to play soccer.  Her parents, disapprove of such activity.  Jess encounters spunky Juliet, another good player, who entices Jess to join the local all-girl's team.  Juliet (who goes by Jules) is all British, using terms like ""brilliant"" frequently.  The two girls seem to have little in common aside from the love of soccer, but a close friendship develops.  Jess, whose older sister is about to get married, must sneak behind her parents' back to play soccer, and when she is discovered, much conflict ensues.
More conflict ensues when the coach, Joe, is the subject of a crush by both young ladies.  Jules saw him first, of course, but Joe is really attracted to Jess, and when this comes out, the girls' friendship is tested.
This only gives you a bare glimpse of the many twists and turns the movie takes.  There are lots of great ""ethnic"" Indian characters, all quite memorable, especially Jess' father, who is an airline pilot.  These immigrants to England have done quite well for themselves, but remain somewhat insular and stick to their own kind.  Jess wants to see more of the world, not because she doesn't love and appreciate where she comes from, but because the world offers her the chance to play more soccer.  She isn't rebelious, as such, she is simply driven.
Will it all work out?  Well, this is the ""feel good"" movie of the year, after all, so you guess. But you know what, the movie is full of surprises great and small nonetheless.  Little moments you might not expect.  And the ending is actually far from a cliche, and leaves a little ambiquity.
EVERYONE in this little movie is top-notch.  The script is terrific, and to be quite honest, I think this is the most I've enjoyed myself at a movie this entire year thus far.
By the way, the movie actually has very little soccer in it, so if you aren't a big soccer buff, don't fret, you won't be lost.  And if you love soccer, there's enough here to draw you in, but it's the rest of the story that will move you.
Also, this movie has a simply terrific wedding / reception sequence.  These kinds of scenes have become cliches in comedies and dramas alike, but the way this one moves (and later juxtaposes with a soccer game) is delightful.
There are a few belly laughs in the movie, but to be honest, this is a movie that puts a smile on your face early on, and it just doesn't leave.  I had a delightful time, and think you will too.  (The movie is PG-13 and is honest and open about sexuality without being the least bit ""dirty,"" but you may want to keep anyone under 13 away anyway.)",1050278400,4,3249,4.500851788756388

1484004,5,B00005JM2Y,"I was already excited about seeing this film, and when it was over I wanted to stay and see it again and again! If you don't play soccer, it gives a realistic example of what the training and tournaments are like so that you can better appreciate the sport. Jess, the lead, gives a perfect performance and is a true star in the making. The chemistry between her and the coach, Joe, is crackling. In all aspects of filmmaking, this movie's the best i've seen in years.",1050019200,,467,4.379310344827586
1484005,5,B00005JM2Y,"I just saw Bend it Like Beckham, and totally loved it. I anticipated its release in my city when I saw a trailer for it while viewing ""The Guru.""  I thought the story, acting, and directing were superb.  Parminder Nagra was wonderful as Jess, and she and Keira Knightley had a wonderful screen presence.  It also is great to see Indians (if that's the correct reference) in this prominent of roles, with the issue of racism (or, ""cultural discrimination"") brought to light within a Comedy-Drama.  I think this is a movie for everyone to see, enjoy, and to learn from.",1049673600,,567,4.64
1484046,5,B00005JM2Y,"BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM refers to the ball-control skill of English football - uh, ""soccer"" to you Yanks - superstar David Beckham, who plays for mighty Manchester United. Beckham has no role in this film except as the hero of Jesminder ""Jess"" Bhamra (Parminder Nagra), the English-born teenaged daughter of middle-class Indian immigrants living in the London suburb of Hounslow under the approach to Heathrow, where Dad works. The girl's mother (Shaheen Khan) wants Jess to learn how to cook a complete Indian dinner, i.e. with meat and veg, marry a nice Indian boy as her older sister is soon to do, and go to the university. All Jess wants is to play football on the green with the lads. The conflict over career paths escalates when Jess is invited to play for the Hounslow Harriers, a girls' football club, by its star player Juliette (Keira Knightley). The Harriers are coached by Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), a young Irishman permanently sidelined by a leg injury. Joe quickly learns that, on the football field, Jess is positively ""brilliant"", and perhaps what American talent scouts are looking for.
If you loved MONSOON WEDDING and MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING, then this is your cup of Earl Grey. The film is bursting with energy and populated with an attractive and engaging cast. Nagra is effervescent in the lead as Jess. In a supporting role, Juliet Stevenson is perhaps the best as Juliette's totally clueless Mom, Paula. Anupam Kher as Jess's father starts out low key, but he grows on you as the film progresses.
After having seen BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM and MONSOON WEDDING, I'm convinced that Indian nuptials are exuberant riots of color, sound, and merriment, and that a sari is the most graceful of female garments. Please don't disabuse me of the notions.
Much of BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM is predictable, including a love triangle, but there are some unexpected comedic elements stemming from wrongly perceived sexual preferences that add extra spice to an already eminently entertaining film. As a puzzled member of the Bhamra extended family points out to an overwrought Paula, ""Jess isn't Lebanese.""
Unless it becomes a phenomenon like MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING, BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM is likely to stay in limited release. Seek it out for a feel-good outing. Trust me.",1049414400,58,2277,4.916883116883117
1484047,5,B00005JM2Y,"This movie, like, ""Greek Wedding,"" needs to move beyond the ""art houses"" in order to spread its theme of ""to thine own self be true.""  Character development and plot are strongly supported by the engaging and believable performances of an ensemble cast of actors.  Colorful sets, costumes, tantalizing food, music that draws you into the story (and makes you want to rush out and buy the soundtrack!) as well as the opportunity for ample laughter generated by the clash, crash and kiss of the co-mingling of Hindu and Anglo cultures create an entirely satisfying experience from start to finish.  It delivers a powerful message that is both entertaining and edifying.  A must see for everyone.  A movie for our time!",1048982400,2,716,4.933333333333334

1484053,5,B00005JM2Y,"I went to a pre-release viewing of this film simply because of the title-- I love football (soccer) and thought this would be a football movie.  It turned out to be a comedy about a young Indian girl whose parents won't let her play on an amateur squad.  Family, growing up, finding yourself-- not themes normally found in movies I watch.  However, this film is seriously funny.  I have not been that entertained by a movie in a long, long time.  The culture clash is briliantly executed, much like a Beckham free kick.  This movie is definately worth the time and money.  In fact, I'm taking my girlfriend so I can see it again.",1047513600,,629,4.464912280701754

1484136,5,B00005JM2Y,"At first glimpse this movie may seem like yet another culture clash/immigrant movie. And to some extent that's true, but there's much more that's tackled as well.
Ok first off the Title - David Beckham is to Soccer (or Football as non-Americans call it) as Michael Jordan is to Basketball. (He's also Posh Spice's husband, but that's besides the point for this movie).
The movie is basically about a British-Indian girl's struggle to achieve her dream - to play professional football, and yet still somehow balance her other priorities. But along the way the movie also helps smash a few cultural stereotypes, gives a pro-feminist message and manages to make you laugh out loud all in the space of two hours. What I loved best about this movie is that all the people in it were so real, and so normal, and also how the drama/melodrama was kept to a bare minimum. I also liked how the semi-conservative Indian father's objection to his daughter playing was not that she was a girl or that she was Indian but that he felt that there would be too much struggle. Or how it's not just the conservative Indian family which has problems with their daughter playing soccer but also the English family as well  - ""There's a reason Sporty Spice is the only one without a fella"". This movie was a hit in England, and also in India, where people of both countries felt that it hit really close to home. Hope you Americans enjoy it too. If you liked Monsoon Wedding, you'll really like this, and if you hated Monsoon Wedding, you'll still really like this.",1045699200,,1543,4.610909090909091
1484137,5,B00005JM2Y,"Bend it Like Beckham is the story of an Indian girl living in England who is obsessed with Manchester United soccer captain, David Beckham. The story follows her as she tries to wins her parents over to the idea of letting her play soccer with a local girls team. The family is not keen on the idea and try to force her into a more traditional role in the home. She secretly keeps playing, and the team wins several big matches. There is also a love interest with her coach and a lot of confusion with her family over her relationship with a team mate.
The film is totally charming and you find yourself cringing, laughing and cheering throughout. It also touches on issues of body, sexuality, tradition,race and family without being too cliche or forced.

1484140,4,B00005JM2Y,"'Bend it like Beckham' is a sweet, fresh and funny film, which despite the not so original script, manages to remain interesting and enjoyable all the way.
The plot uses women soccer as a excuse(original) to tell the story of a young, Indian girl, who idolizes David Beckham (having her room literally full of his posters). It describes her attempts to fulfill her dreams, which most of the times bring her in direct contrast with her family and society (not so original).
Apart from the script, I certainly enjoyed the ethnic/cultural character of the film, which reveals (always in a humorous way) the traditional Indian way of life, touching subjects such as religion, family, clothing, even cooking (delicious!)
The soundtrack of the film is simply brilliant, including an intriguing combination of modern, brit pop songs, and traditional (or not so traditional) Indian songs - pay close attention to the wedding song and the end titles song.
All the soccer scenes (including the close-ups) are very well shot. The fact that most of those scenes include girls, who prove how smoothly they can handle the ball, makes them even more enjoyable!
Concluding, 'Bend it like Beckham' may not be a masterpiece, but it will certainly leave a big smile on your face.
PS The film even offers a suggestion as to how you can explain the off-side rule to someone ignorant! Try it and see if it works.",1042070400,4,1390,4.8691983122362865

One of the funniest things, was when Jasminda plays a game of soccer in the park with some male friends, her skill at handling the ball had the three of us leaning forward in our seats, open-mouthed!
Brilliant, funny with a storyline to keep you thoroughly interested, anyone that hasn't seen this film, please do, I just wish I had seen it earlier.",1041379200,4,612,4.267241379310345
1484142,5,B00005JM2Y,"I saw this film on a trip to London in the spring of 2002 and have been anxiously awaiting it's release on DVD ever since.  As the other reviewers have pointed out, this is only somewhat about soccer...it's really about following your dreams and trying to appease a traditional family that loves you but just doesn't understand why you want what you want.  The first time you see this, you may very well miss some of the dialog because you'll be laughing so hard and yet, it's beautifully touching...even inspiring in the midst of the gales of laughter.
I was concerned that this film would never make it to the US (although I wouldn't be surprised if the title changes...never mind that Beckham is not exactly a household word in this country...I would never have know what ""bend it"" means if I hadn't seen this movie).  It is, in some respects, so much about things quintessentially English (combined with things quintessentially Indian), that I wasn't sure that American audiences would get it.  I'm thrilled to find that the studio is at least taking a chance that we will (certainly the reviews below show that I'm not the only American who loved it!).

1484143,5,B00005JM2Y,On a recent overnight flight to Sydney I watched this film while my wife slept.  My laughter woke her up several times.  Later in the flight we had another opportunity to see the film.  My wife had to see what I was laughing about so we both watched the film.  It was just as good the second time.  The movie is partly about soccer but is more about following your dreams while still honoring different cultures.  The movie is wholesome and entertaining and displays well the trials and tribulations of parents and teenagers.  We saw the film again on a flight from Sydney to Auckland and still can't wait to see it agian when it comes to U.S. theaters.  The cell phone scene mentioned in one of the reviews is classic.
