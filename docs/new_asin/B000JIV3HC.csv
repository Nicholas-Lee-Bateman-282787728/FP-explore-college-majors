8150435,5,B000JIV3HC,"For some reason, British screenwriters manage to squeeze a good deal more plot into their scripts than we do; I've never quite understood why. SCANDALOUS, a frothy '80's film that's really a throwback of sorts to '50's films, has a plot that begins to unravel and continues, with all kinds of twists and turns and funny scenes, till the end. I went to see the film in the theater because I love Jim Dale (this was pre-HARRY POTTER); I bought the film because I just loved it, period. Robert Hays is wonderful as a TV reporter who wants to be a reporter, not the son-in-law of the network owner (Emmett Walsh), who gives him fluff pieces to placate him and keep him married to his depressed daughter. Pamela Stephenson is the beautiful con artist who poses as an industrial spy to hook Hays into a scam; Jim Dale is the over-the-top police inspector who never stops talking and frankly steals every scene he's in. The music is wonderful, and as it's shot mostly in London, the glimpses of that great city are an extra bonus. This is a charming, funny film that deserves a second look -- you really haven't lived until you've seen Sir John Gielgud (Stephenson's uncle, and a master con artist) dressed as a punk rocker at a punk concert. SCANDALOUS is just plain fun -- a great cast having a great time and letting us in on it.",1332547200,13,1325,4.479338842975206
