I saw this at the theater and as I had expected, but hoped against, I was so ticked off at the stupid ending that it ruined the entire movie, in retrospect.  Just like ""the ring"" was pretty scary up until the end, this movie follows perfect suit.  I don't recommend it unless you are into this sort of thing.  And to think they are thinking about ""Grudge Part 2"".  I won't be fooled again, that's for sure.",1105401600,5,495,4.279569892473118

29261,2,0767827759,"The violent circumstances of a Japanese family's death have given rise to a curse in which all who enter their old house are stalked and killed by demons representing the dead family. That's not much of a plot, which is why this isn't much of a movie. In scene after scene, we watch a hapless person bumble through an abandoned area, slowly coming to the realization that they are not alone. They all eventually succumb to the fear that envelopes them, and the demons manifest themselves in a variety of creepy ways before dispatching the bumblers. The production values are high, and the scenes are very creepy/scary/disturbing, which is saying something. But any attempt to inject reason or logic into viewing the movie bursts the bubble, and ultimately, there's just not enough to sustain a feature film.",1104969600,4,807,4.897810218978102

29263,3,0767827759,"After seeing the horrible ""reworking"" done on Nakata Hideo's scare-fest ""RING"" by director Gore Verbinski and DreamWorks-- and seeing how director Walter Salles intends to 'one-up' Verbinski with his complete mangling of another Nakata masterpiece, ""HONOGURAI MIZU NO SOKO KARA"" (currently in production as ""DARK WATER"" with Disney/Touchstone as joint culprit) --I had some hesitation about wanting to see the Hollywood remake of ""JUON."" But four specific things fueled my interest in this Occidental revision entitled ""The Grudge"":

(1) It would keep the story set in Japan, using many of the same sets and actors of the original series;

(2) Sam Raimi (""The Evil Dead"") not only put up the money to have this movie remade, but he was so appreciative of the original Japanese theatrical production (and so confident of the success of the remake) that he was instrumental in getting ""JUON"" a wide US distribution even before the remake was completed and released to theatres;

(3) Raimi insisted that Shimizu Takashi, the director of the original productions, be retained as the director of the US remake as well;

(4) The pre-release trailers of the film made it unambiguously obvious that, unlike the distorted crud given to us by the teams of DreamWorks/Verbinski & Disney/Salles, ""The Grudge"" was going to be a true ""remake"" that remained VERY faithful to the original material.

Of course, none of that could guarantee that I'd be 100% satisfied with the result because, sadly, I wasn't. But that doesn't mean it was a bad movie or a failed experiment -- there is still much to like about this movie even for hardened ""Juon Junkies"" like myself. It's just that this film, as faithful a remake as it was, just didn't have the right kind of ""texture"": Gone was the gloominess & ambiance of the original productions, gone was the slow-paced and the tension build-up, gone was the ""REAL"" reason Saeki Takeo murdered his family (but, of course, reusing the original Japanese cast as the Saeki family, that really could not have been helped short of casting Jason Scott Lee or Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa in the ""Kobayashi-sensei/Peter"" role), and gone was the ""REAL"" reason Kayako makes that unsettling croaking noise (and it's not the reason they try to make you believe it is in the remake). There was never a moment in the film where I was not aware that I was watching a ""Hollywood"" production -- all of the ""Asian qualities"" I liked so much about the original series just weren't in this movie, and it's not because of the presence of Caucasian actors and English dialogue. My difficulty in relating to this remake stems from the fact that the presentation was too bright, too loud, too fast, too sanitized, too refined, too perfect -- lacking all the ""rawness"" and the pure emotion of the original series.

For those not all that familiar with what I'm talking about, ""The Grudge"" is based on a series of movies called ""JUON"" or ""JU-ON"" (literal translation: ""curse grudge""). It began as a two-part 'V-Cinema' (Japan's version of 'made-for-television/video') series called, appropriately, ""JUON"" and ""JUON 2"" -- which were marketed (but not ""officially"" titled) with the English companion title, ""THE CURSE."" Because of the immediate success of these two V-Cinema productions, writer/director Shimizu Takashi was given a bigger budget to work with along with a green light to begin work on a theatrical version, that was released under the name, ""JUON"" -- which, after a successful run in theatres throughout Asia, was followed by a theatrical sequel called, you guessed it, ""JUON 2."" In order to alleviate some of the confusion that was certain to arise, ""JUON"" and ""JUON 2,"" the theatrical versions, were distinguished from their V-Cinema counterparts by being given the marketed (yet still ""unofficial"") English title, ""THE GRUDGE.""

Contrary to popular misinformation spreading about, ""Juon"" (theatrical) is not a remake of ""Juon"" (v-cinema), but is, along with the theatrical sequel, a ""continuation"" of the same story; much like ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" is a 'continuation' of the original Star Trek television series' ""Space Seed"" episode. So, in actuality, the theatrical release of ""Juon"" and its sequel are best described as ""Juon, part 3"" and ""Juon, part 4"" respectively.

Because most of the people who learn of the original story generally become familiarized only with the first theatrical production (""Part 3""), they naturally assume that ""The Grudge"" is a remake of that film, when in reality the Western remake incorporates important story elements from both the first 'theatrical' production (""Part 3"") and the first 'video' production (""Part 1""), thereby providing much of the ""back story"" one would normally not have if they were only familiar with the theatrical releases of the original story. So, in this sense, ""The Grudge"" provides some important (but really not all that necessary) background details for those who have seen ""Juon"" (the movie) but were unable to gain access to the original V-Cinema productions.

Anyway, as the opening screen text explains (in all five films), ""Juon"" refers to [paraphrasing] a curse that is born when someone dies violently in the grip of a powerful rage where there is great resentment, etc., etc. Because of having died such an undignified death, the resentment (or 'grudge') lingers & festers in the place(s) where the horrific murders occurred, which then indiscriminately lashes out at ANYONE (male, female, adult, child, rich, poor, married, single, Asian, Caucasian, Terran, Martian, whatever) who trespasses upon the cursed site -- in this case, the central location where the curse resides & emanates from is a typical Japanese ""middle-class"" house (in the V-Cinema, it is the same house plus another apartment in a different part of town). The curse does not always manifest itself right away; in fact, it might take years before the cursed spirits enact their rage against their victims -- and the victims are not always dispatched the same way: some get strangled, some get literally ripped to pieces, others just ""disappear,"" and so on. The spectres are also not bound by the time/space continuum as we know it, often creating temporal shifts and so-forth. Also, in the ""Juon"" series, each attack has the potential for creating a new ""juon"" (i.e., the victim could then be 'reborn,' as it were, as another vengeful spirit), but ""The Grudge"" plays down this aspect of the curse and pretty much just sticks with building up the body count. And unlike ""RING,"" there is no way to break the curse or to keep it from spreading other than to just stay out of that damned house.

And though Mr. Raimi chose to keep the story set in its native Japan and limited the use of Caucasian actors, I am convinced that the film could have just as easily been set in NYC, L.A., or here in Honolulu, where heavy Asian populations reside and speak English as their native language, assuming that it was his intent was to cater to Japanese or other Asian cultural themes. Such a move could have been just as effective and would have given him better rationale for using Caucasian-American actors. But because of using a new cast of white American characters in Japan while having key members of the Japanese cast reprise their original roles, the story as it plays out in the remake loses some of its effectiveness and justifications, due to the inability to duplicate certain situations which account for some of the specific behaviors associated with certain characters, thus resulting in slightly different interpretations of the two films.

As far as recommending this movie on its own merits, I'd have no problem encouraging the 'uninitiated' to give it a fair look.

To those who are familiar with any of the ""Juon"" presentations (esp. those privileged enough to have viewed all four original entries), my recommendation comes a bit harder. Again, as I've already expressed, my specific prejudices have already influenced my decision to not include this remake in my personal collection, but if you're stoked to see a remake that is ""truly"" a remake, which remains very faithful to the original and refuses to take ""dumbed-down"" Hollywood-style 'liberties' with the source material, then you just might appreciate this movie on that level. On the other hand, if you, like myself, appreciated the ethereal qualities and slow-pace of the originals, I'm not so enthusiastic about recommending it outright, and I would suggest renting it out first before jumping in head-first.

In any event, it's really not a terrible movie; and for newbies, it could open a whole new window into Asian cinema. ~ Aloha!",1104019200,8,8668,5.044692737430168

 Well we all know this is a remake of the Ju-on films (almost all re-shoots) but in this case they did a great job remaking it. Although the grudge had it's problems it was still a fun movie and is worth seeing on the big screen. Being a huge Sarah Gellar fan i plan on buying a copy of the movie and recommend it to any Buffy fans. This movie really earned and deserved it's scares which were very numerous throughout the film. The Film starts out with a man committing suicide by falling off a building (very shocking and the image sticks with you throughout the whole film) and the titles role. It may seem pointless but it will be explained later. After the titles we learn that Yoko didn't show up for work at the care center (she had to investigate some creepy noises in the attic which didn't go very well) so Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) was sent to take after and elderly lady. And that is where it all begins. And after about 50 minutes that is where it ends. They didn't explain enough story during the first half so in the second half towards the end they tried to drop this huge bombshell on us and left many confused. Of course I knew what was going on because I've seen Ju-On many times but people in the audience that were once screaming in fright now scratched their heads in confusion. There were way too many side stories going on throughout and would have been great if this movie were 2 hours long but in it's short running time it just didn't work. I was a little disappointed with the surprise ending but i lit up like a school girl when i found out they might be shooting a sequel Hopefully SMG will return as Karen. Although the film was intensely frightening and very well made it left me feeling incomplete and saying to myself ""how could she do this to me again"".

As for the product itself, it is pretty awesome, when you open the case it has a picture on the inside of the cover which I have not seen a lot of lately so it was nice to see this again. The Blu-ray has one disc that includes both Theatrical and Unrated versions but trust me when I say you are going to want to watch the unrated version, it's sooooo much better. The Main Menu is nice and has many special features including 2 Ju-on short films called 4444444444 and In a Corner, if you are a big Ju-on fan you will know what these are but if not, they are pretty much scenes that explain what happened to certain characters in the Original made for TV Ju-on film Ju-on: The Curse. Anyway, it was nice to see those short films on here because I think they are really good. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because there was a little dent on the front of the case which I don't really like because It looks pretty bad but I will probably just get a replacement case.

The Grudge though is a one of my favorite horror movies. Yes I have seen the original Japanese version but I don't speak Japanese and I prefer not to read my movies but I do actually watch a lot of subtitled stuff despite that.
This is another Hollywood remake but not really, that just made it for the English speaking people and it works.
The movie is as good as the original I think but some people might not like it as it doesn't follow a straight line, it jumps around and you really have to pay attention. The movie sort of runs backwards to front and some might not like that. Japanese horror is great, but it's very different from what people in the United States think of as horror and I think they did a good job at the translation or transition for American audiences.

Sarah Michelle Gellar did a fine job in a role which had so little screen time in the film that I wonder why bother at all? Worse still is Bill Pullman... sorry no spoilers here.

29355,3,0767827759,"I found this horror film watchable, but still it disappointed me a little as it is nowhere near the level of ""The Ring"". Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

PRECISION: I never watched the original ""Ju-on: the grudge"" Japanese version so I am unable to compare it to this American remake.

Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is an American nurse living and working in Tokyo. She is efficient and hardworking and therefore she handles already numerous assignments, but her boss Alex (Ted Raimi) asks her to take one more patient, an aged American woman named Emma Williams (Grace Zabriskie). Emma lives alone in a large and old (by Tokyo's standards) house and she needs care because she suffers from dementia and lethargy  - or Yoko (Yoko Maki), the usually very reliable previous nurse assigned to her didn't report to work for a couple of days...

This actually is not the real beginning of the story, because the action of this film is as non-linear as it is humanly possible, with numerous flash-backs and with some new plots kicking in all the time - and that is precisely part of my problem with ""The Grudge"". Non-linear narration is a very excellent thing but only if the director keeps things under strict control - here it is not the case and even if the logic of the story is ultimately preserved it takes a great effort to keep up with the developments. Personally, considering that the film was not so good anyway, towards the end I didn't feel like making this effort anymore because all those narrative acrobatics tired me instead of intriguing...

The other problem I had with this film that, unlike the chillingly terrifying ""The Ring"", this film is hardly scary AT ALL. There is only a couple of really good scenes, but in a 92 minutes film it is not nearly enough.

The main strength of this film is in Sarah Michelle Gellar, who reveals herself here as a much better actress than usually believed - and of course she is still cute as a button, exactly as in ""Buffy"" TV series. Her character is likeable and clearly vulnerable (do not expect any martial arts) and therefore I was concerned about what will happen to her all the time - it was actually what kept me watching this thing until the very end...

The other asset is Detective Nakagawa (Ryo Ishibashi), a tough, courageous and competent police officer who already had to do with Emma's house in the past and is clearly scared s***less by this place - but nevertheless will do his duty with cold, resigned resolution.

Still, the good points notwithstanding, this is not a very successful film. Watchable, but nothing more and especially nowhere near the quality of ""The Ring"".",1391558400,,2677,4.717344753747323

29360,5,0767827759,"The Grudge is based on the Japanese film ''Ju-On: The Grudge''. It is about a curse that is born when a person dies in the grip of a powerful rage or sorrow. The curse stays behind and manifests in the area the person died in. Those who go in the place where the person died become cursed and haunted by the spirit of that person. In the film, a Japanese woman named Kayako is murdered by her husband after he finds out she is cheating on him. He snaps her neck, then he goes upstairs and drowns his son Toshio and his cat in the bathtub. Then the husband hangs himself.

The film takes place in Japan, and the main character is an American woman named Karen. The movie is told in a non-linear style, and jumps back and forth through time. Most of the film is about the characters going into the house and becoming cursed, haunted, and killed by the vengeful spirits of Kayako and Toshio. Kayako has long stringy black hair and she is often seen moving in a jerky way while making a creepy throat sound, and her son hisses and meows like his cat. The people are also often killed in the same way Kayako and Toshio were killed, but not always.

My personal favorite scenes in this movie are when Yoko is attacked by Kayako, when we see Yoko without her jaw, and the ending where Kayako is crawling down the staircase.

I really like this movie. It's a unique horror movie and I love the style.",1368748800,,1392,4.285171102661597

29364,5,0767827759,"This movie was more disturbing to me than the Ring. Although once again I must say the Japanese version was better this was still a very good American rendition probably because it had the same director.

Sarah Michelle Gellar surprised me, as she actually has in recent years with non Buffy things she has done. Not that I don't like Buffy, that show kind of grew on my like fine wine, but I must say, Buffy really wasn't ever high on the creep factor for me.

The sequels to this movie are also wonderful. The Japanese versions, worth watching.

29366,2,0767827759,"The rule of thumb for watching any Japanese horror film that is remade in Hollywood is to go for the original, subtitles be damned. The one exception is The Ring.

The Grudge remake, made by the exact same director of the original, is a series of confusing, disconnected creepy scenes until the end where you kinda-sorta get an explanation. No plot. Just typical stupid horror movie characters doing stupid things. ""Oh, let's go check out that really creepy sound all by myself after I found my wife/mother/girlfriend/pet dead.""

On a positive note, it did introduce the definitely creepy guttural ""groan"" that has since been over-used (the latest in the 2013 flick ""Mama"").

Having seen nearly all the Japanese horror flicks, there is a clear cultural fear of long black hair, water and eyeballs or mouths that are stretched/blacked out via CGI. When you experience it for the first time, it's scary. The second time, it's interesting. For the third, fourth, ...., it's yaaawwwwwnnnn.",1360713600,,985,5.030674846625767
29367,4,0767827759,"Following the huge box-office success of THE RING, an American remake of the Japanese hit JU-ON was inevitable as producers scrambled to cash-in on the hot new trend in Asian Horror. Thankfully, Sam Raimi had enough sense to bring back series creator Takashi Shimizu to direct, resulting in a film that is just as frightening as the original. Karen is assigned to a new caregiving position in a house that bears a terrible curse, which unleashes a pair of restless spirits upon anyone who enters. THE GRUDGE is nearly identical to JU-ON in nearly every, so why remake it at all? The answer is simple: most Americans are lazy and uncaring when it comes to foreign films, and this was the only way to expose this terrifying curse to a larger world audience. Faulting it on this, alone, would be an unfair assessment entirely, escpecially when it gets so much right. Shimizu brings back the same sense of dread and horrifying images from before, and manages to to create old-fashioned scares built on heart-pounding suspense. He overcomes the PG-13 rating without resorting to blood or gore, using the subtly subdued score and unnerving appearances of his pale-faced ghosts to drive home the terror. The American casting works fine, and launched Sarah Michelle Gellar from a television actress into movie stardom. But really, the strength of the film lies in the performance by returning actress Takako Fuji as the malevolent spirit Kayako. Her twisted movements and gut-wrenching stares chill to the bone. Young Yuya Ozeki is equally frightening as Kayako's son, Toshio. Of the many films brought over from Japan, THE GRUDGE rightfully remains as one of the best-made and most-terrifying remakes!

The film is almost a literal translation of the very fine original, Ju-on, and that makes it quite a disappointment. No new dimensions are added, even with the twist of bringing American characters into Japanese culture.

I'm a horror buff of over 3 decades and to me, Ju-on was intense and genuinely scary. In fact, it is one of my all time favorites...

With this in mind, I found the remake very disappointing. It seemed that everything that made the original so chilling was either changed or omitted. The parts that were changed were done so with special effects that were, I suppose, to give the film a more polished look. For me, this only served to make the film predictable. This, along with changes made in the storyline (to make it more mainstream?) took so much away from what could have been (in my opinion) one of the scariest films in years.

The original, subtitled version is certainly in my top 10, if not top 5 scariest films.

They also add to the overall story in key places. Oh well, at least these scenes are included on the DVD. I recommend this director's cut AND the deleted stuff.

Show me a Hamburger Helper gore-fest and I'll get downright bored; there's only so many ways to skin a cat (pardon the pun), plus the viewer, after awhile, becomes completely desensitized to all the blood 'n guts.  There's something to be said about things that go bump in the night; if a scary flick is to be effective, there needs to be suspense, a little campy creepiness, and a fleeting glimpse of a monster screaming, ""Boo!""

Enter THE GRUDGE, director Takashi Shimizu's American remake of his Japanese thriller, ""Ju-on.""  I thoroughly enjoyed this yarn precisely because Shimizu didn't try to gross his audience out; instead, we catch glimpses and haunting images of three demons who terrorize a house. . .and anyone who dares to enter it.  Accordingly, actual violence is kept to a minimum; shots of ghosts only last long enough to tweak the ""ick"" nerve, and the viewer never, ever, witnesses a victim endure a long, agonizing death.

And that, folks, makes for effective horror.

The mostly American cast is adequate, yet not memorable.  Sarah Michelle Gellar as an American nurse-in-training abroad in Tokyo--and subsequently tormented by messy ghouls--is okay, although she often seems aloof and disinterested.  Other American actors include Bill Pullman, who gets this movie rolling right along.  The ending, like most horror flicks, is pretty lame, yet THE GRUDGE works effectively via creepiness--not chainsaws.

29399,4,0767827759,"There are great moments in this flick!  The story is not so completely original, but the Japanese perspective on horror movies makes this an irresistable film!  It doesn't set a straight-forward chronology, but rather, it jumps back and forth in its time frames.  So you have to pay attention.  And you pick up new things each time you watch it again.  It scares you when you are supposed to get scared.  There are moments when you are sitting at the edge of your seat, there are things that will send a chill up your spine, and the interesting mixtures and conflicts between American and Japanese cultures add to the enticing flavor of this film.  It was intentionally arranged by American producers that this movie be directed by the same Japanese director who did the original flick on which this American remake was based.  It was an experiment that worked quite well. And of course, I absolutely love Sarah Michelle Gellar in anything she does!  Let's face it, Sarah can even make Buffy the Vampire Slayer almost worth watching.  But Sarah Michelle brightens every screen appearance she touches.  And this movie is no exception!  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good scare that is given from a fresh, new viewpoint.  But, it's a movie that you have to pay attention to, and watch more than once.

29400,4,0767827759,"Let me begin by saying up front that I am a horror fan. Yes I know that this genre is not considered cerebral enough for most reviewers. But it is one that I love and have loved since childhood. Every thing from low budget movies like SQUIRM to high profile items like THE EXORCIST. That being said, it should come as no surprise that after numerous viewings of all things horrific, there is little to see that I would consider actually scary. Until tonight.

The story is based around a Japanese legend that when someone dies under brutal or highly emotional circumstances, a curse is placed on that location that carries on to those who visit the site. After witnessing such an occurrence, we are introduced to Karen (Sarah Michelle Geller), a young woman living in Japan with her student boyfriend, who works as a care giver/nurse. Sent to the house where the first young nurse was killed (we know this but no one else does just yet), Karen is exposed to the ghosts that haunt the house, including a small boy and a terrifying lady with long black hair.

Her charge found dead along with the couple who own the house, Karen is taken to a hospital. The movie plays fast and loose with moving in time and space to tell its story and it works well this way. We see these victims before they were killed, find out how they came to the house, find out the connection (only slightly at first) between a man who killed himself at the very beginning of the movie and this family and we find out more about the little boy. We are also treated to the grisly deaths of all, including the sister of the couple.

It is through the use of storytelling, information that Karen finds online and later a discussion with the police detective assigned to the case, that we garner the whole story. And we learn why this apparition is haunting Karen as well as the rest.

No I won't spoil it for you by giving you the ending. Nor will I offer you the times and places in the film where you are likely to jump out of your seat. Instead, just let me say that there are some truly creepy sequences and sights that will make you skin crawl not to mention make you consider the fact that crawling under the covers may never be the safest thing to do ever again.

The movie's pace drags momentarily at times, but picks up again enough to make those spots not even noticeable (I wouldn't have mentioned them here but my wife felt that they were too long). What makes this movie work is that along with the scares that it offers, we have a fountain of story that draws us in as well. The acting is solid and the direction by Takashi Shimizu, who directed the original and its sequel, makes him a talent to watch in the future.",1205452800,2,2700,4.370517928286852
29401,3,0767827759,"Despite some genuinely scary moments, I never bought into this film.  I had three primary problems with it.  First, the ghosts had no idea how to do things ""comme il faut"".  Where was the build-up of suspense, fear, and terror?  What was this uncouth business of attacking people barely two minutes after they entered the house?  I mean, really!  Second, I was taken aback (and displeased by) the ghosts' ability to do physical harm.  What were they, ghosts -- or goons?  And the reverse should be true as well, shouldn't it?  What were these people waiting for to bring a baseball bat down on the heads of these creeps?  If nothing else, it would have given me enormous satisfaction -- I found the unrelenting and indiscriminate nature of the ghosts' vengefulness extremely irritating and tiresome.  Finally, I thought it ridiculous that anyone and everyone who so much as dared to set a toe in the house was doomed (not just in the house, but regardless of where they went).  What was this movie about, ghosts -- or the Ebola Virus?  At the rate these ghosts were going, all of Japan would have been dead within the month -- with, no doubt, the rest of the world soon to follow.

Kayako and Toshio are both the original actors from the Japanese film. The story is the same, but has the addition of Ju-on: The Curse 1 & 2's events to provide the back story.

There are some genuine jump moments (anytime Yuya Ozeki or Takako Fuji are in the frame) and the supporting cast is good (Ted Raimi as a social work facilitator not so good-he showed frustration almost constantly), but Gellar, as Karen Davis, just doesn't have broad enough shoulders to carry a film like this.  The phasing from story to story, so you could get the full picture of how insidious the hatred enveloping this house really is, was interesting.  I liked seeing all the concurrent stories that led up to the moment when Karen tried to burn down the house to kill the spirit.  I enjoyed Clea Duvall's portrayal of sadness and isolation at being in a foreign country, where hardly anyone spoke english.  Her growing frustration and withdrawal from her surroundings made her ultimate demise at the hands of the house very poignant.  But best of all was Yuya Ozeki as Toshio.  The child is beautiful when he looks normal, but put him in that white makeup, with the black eyes and sinisterly sad expression, and you have some really creepy moments when he's in frame.  Takako Fuji as Kayako was also creepy and weird.  Her face, it's almost plastic expressionlessness, was wonderfully scary to behold.  Her flexibility and disjointedness when she crawled down the stairs after Karen was astounding.  And how she got her hand under Gellar's hair on the back of her head in the shower is truly baffling.

At its core, this is an infection story, similar to communicable vampirism, Night of the Living Dead, or the Borg's assimilation.

29415,5,0767827759,"To date, director Takashi Shimizu has made 6 JU-ON/GRUDGE films. What is interesting is that each one contributes something new to the ""Grudge Mythos."" None of the films are merely ""remakes"" of another one. Although I personally find the first theatrical  JU-ON film to be the cream of the crop, I think that this American version stands up well in its own right. It's a fantastic horror film, brimming with interesting ideas, unforgettable imagery and fine performances.

If you are a Grudge enthusiast/completist, or if you've simply been meaning to pick-up a copy of the film, this Unrated Director's Cut is worth adding to your collection. The added footage is welcome, as are the excellent extras.

The feature commentary by director Takashi Shimizu, producer Taka Ichise, and actress Takako Fuji (who plays the iconic, long-haired ghost, Kayako) is a pleasure from start to finish. It's exactly what a commentary should be, a combination of information and entertainment. The three are obviously having a ball doing the commentary and there are times when they sound as though they're giving their film the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" treatment. I was laughing out loud at times. In addition, Shimizu offers some interesting insights on the film's imagery, what it was like working with an American cast, etc. This commentary alone is worth the price for Shimizu fans.

Also included in the Extras is a generous helping of deleted scenes. GRUDGE fans will enjoy comparing and contrasting these scenes with the earlier films in the franchise, especially the two original made-for-Japanese-television JU-ON films. As a welcome bonus, Shimizu, Ichise and Fuji offer interesting commentaries on all of the deleted scenes.

This DVD edition also contains two early, very short (about 3 minutes apiece) Shimizu films based upon his ""Grudge mythology."" What is interesting about these shorts is that they both relate to events which occur in the original made-for-TV JU-ON films.

For my money, the original JU-ON is the gold standard of horror cinema, and Takashi Shimizu is the reigning king of cinematic horror. I believe that, given the compromises which were forced upon Shimizu by his American producers, he still created a very worthy entry into the ""Grudge mythos"" -- and a brilliant film, period -- with his American version of the story.

A lot of scenes dragged on, and there were times I had to stop the DVD and say I'd come back later to finish.  Usually, when you have big name actors in a horror movie (Sarah Michelle Gellar is no Tom Hanks, but she is pretty well known), there's usually more of a fixation on the actor and less with the story of the movie. Some other good examples of this would be Scream (Nev Campbell, David Arquette, Drew Barrymore), I Know What You Did Last Summer (another with Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Jennifer Love Hewitt), and House on Haunted Hill (Tey Diggs, Chris Kattan).

The movie felt as though it was in bits.  There was no gradual build up, nor breaks inbetween to further build ups.  There was one scene after another of horror.  It lost impact almost from the word go when you realised that after one ""fast and obvious build up to the expected climax of horror"" there came another and another, one right after the other.  When you have constant climaxes, there is nothing more to watch.

I sat and watched a disjointed movie filled with ""scenes"".  They ruined the eerie parts by then overdoing it and not giving the viewer a chance to appreciate it and become drawn in.

I found myself at the end of the movie in a state of shock thinking ""is this it??"".  What potential, yet what a disaster!!!  And I am not hard to please.  I am a horror fan and can appreciate even the stupid ones, but this was a movie that should have been real impact stuff, designed to be serious and designed to shock, but again lost all impact.

The scenes shold have been more realistic and slowly built up to, and spaced further apart, with little eerie things inbetween.  They ALMOST did it a few times, but wham, once again the over the top and fast climax and then onto the next one.

Unfortuantely, now that they have such special effects, they rely on those to make the movie and the movie ends up being crap.",1170460800,5,1554,4.310344827586207

They show that the second film is along the same lines as the first and is more a ""Part 2"" than a sequel.",1168300800,,630,4.258333333333334
29424,3,0767827759,"""The Grudge"" is the American remake of Japan's ""Ju-On: The Grudge"", and while it's nowhere near on par with remakes like ""Dark Water"", ""The Ring"" or ""The Ring Two"", it does stand pretty well on its own.  In sharp contrast to the Ring/Ringu situation though (I can't compare the two ""Dark Water""s, as I still haven't gotten to the 2002 original), ""The Grudge"" is pretty much a shot-for-shot remake of ""Ju-On"", bringing little new to the table.

  As with the original, ""The Grudge"" follows the premise of a legend in Japanese folklore (apparantly really a part of that tradition and not just made up for the movie) - a person who dies an unnatural death, in the grip of a rage, will sometimes become a ghost known as a Ju-On.  These spirits are violent and vengeful and, judging from the ""Ju-On"" and ""Grudge"" movies, seem to act not necesarily in accordance with the kinds of people they were when alive, but lashing out quite indiscriminately in rage over the injustice of their own demise.  They seem incapable of differentiating between the living who they would have reason to bear anger against, and just the living in general.  Those who are killed by a Ju-On become one themselves, and the curse grows.

  At the risk of repeating myself from when I wrote about ""Ju-On"" in its own entry, the troubles begin when a young home health care worker (who makes her rounds caring for various frail and incapacitated people in their own homes) enters a house to care for a woman who's recently moved with her family into a new home with a dark past.  Invesigating strange noises coming from upstairs, she discovers an unusual little boy behind a boarded-up wall.  And thus the first Ju-On makes his appearance, and the weirdness and darkness begins.

  ""The Grudge"" has many of the same strengths and many of the same weaknesses as ""Ju-On"", which is fitting I suppose because most of the time they're the same movie, just with different actors (although some from the original reprise their roles here) and spoken in different languages.  As with the first one, there are some pretty implausible actions and reactions on the parts of the human characters in here; I found it overall to be less pronounced in this remake though.  Although both movies unfold in much the same style with regards to timeframes, I found this one easier to make sense of - it may be because I saw the Japanese one first and knew what to expect this time.  Or it may be because when ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" was shot, it was with the expectation that most Asian viewers would have already had a chance to see ""Ju-On: The Curse 1"" and ""Ju-On: The Curse 2"", the two Japanese made-for-tv-movies which ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" was itself a remake of (or, apparantly, it could be viewed as a kind of sequel if one was so inclined; I haven't had a chance to watch those two yet).

  The overall production values in this movie are very good but the ones in ""Ju-On"" were a bit better, except for the special effects.  Here ""The Grudge"" wins out by a fair margin with truly great effects.  Both movies feature the same freakishly disturbing sounds made by the Ju-On ghosrs.  Those bizarre, utterly unnatural noises are just plain scary.

  If one was just going on ""The Grudge"" and ""Ju-On"" you could really just pick either one and miss very little.  However, there's a catch - both movies's sequels are better, and the sequels actually follow completely different storylines from one another.  And they're each better served by seeing their respective predecessor first.  So personally I'd recommend both ""Grudge"" and Ju-On"", although you'll probably want to watch them some time apart rather than one just a few days after the other.  They're both good movies, but I wish they'd made at least a few significant changes in this one; it's a lost opportunity that was, thankfully, more than made up for by the sequels being so far apart.",1168300800,2,3893,4.689248895434463

29429,3,0767827759,"The Grudge is a horror film remake of a Japanese film. It stars Sarah Michelle Gellar (of BtVS fame) as an American nurse who is charged to watch over a woman in Tokyo. Hijinks ensue, as the house of that woman is home to angry spirits, who track down and kill all those who enter the house. The acting's fine, the direction's fine, etc. Really, the big question that must be asked of a horror film is:

Is it scary?

Maybe yes and maybe no, depending on what you think of when you think of the word ""scary.""

The Grudge is not scary in the sense that Rosemary's Baby or Whatever Happened to Baby Jane were scary. It's not scary in the same way that Psycho, Alien, Halloween or Scream were scary. It's not even scary the same way the Final Destination movies were scary. It's nothing psychological. It's not the ambience. You won't walk away from the movie looking around corners or afraid to turn out the lights. Instead, the movie is scary because the visuals are disturbing and they jump out at you from out of nowhere, with a crash of music.

You see, the special effects/make-up team do a great job at creating scary-looking ghosts to terrify Sarah Michelle Gellar, and when they leap out at you with little warning, you'll get a jolt. It's reflexive, kind of like how you'll flinch if something's thrown at your face. But it's hardly the same kind of terror as the true classics of the genre.

Real horror isn't *just* things jumping at you, but it's a sense of how and why they're jumping out; the context. In The Grudge, apparently you're a target because you step foot in the wrong home (where bad things, of course, have happened). After that, you're hunted down by the spirits until they... well... we don't actually know *what* they do. We only know that they look scary, and their victims die in some unspecified way. Why are the spirits able to dispatch some victims quite easily while others resist for some period of time? Don't know. Is there any way of fighting back against the spirits? Don't know. Why did the spirits materialize here, specifically, as opposed to all of the other scenes of violent crimes that pepper our lands? Don't know.

Basically, the plot has so many holes, because the plot is unimportant to the film, which holds itself as nothing more than a delivery system for those ""jump out at you"" moments. Without a real context, you're only scared when the freaky-looking ghosts are on screen; the terror fades as soon as they're gone. While it's scary in a dark theater, it doesn't hold up once you're back out in the sunshine. A fun flick to see once, perhaps, but not something you'll be discussing in 5 years, or really even 5 weeks.

Three stars, because it does what it wants to do and is executed well in terms of production values, acting, etc. It wants the last two stars, however, because it's lightweight and horror of the most fleeting kind.",1162512000,3,2889,4.5442307692307695
29430,3,0767827759,"In THE GRUDGE a nurse fails to show up for work at the home of an American family living in Tokyo and an American exchange nurse-student, Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is asked to drop by as her replacement. Karen finds the old lady to be mute and sleeps throughout the day. Strange events occur in the house and Karen discovers that the building seems to be tainted by a curse caused by a grudge. Strange events begin to happen and people start dying. No matter how many victims are killed, The Grudge just won't stop. It seems that an evil emotion that takes the former of frightening-looking, blue Asian children and a sound that sounds like someone with a chicken bone stuck in their throat just can't be appeased.

I watched THE GRUDGE with a group of friends late one night. Many of them were scared throughout the movie and couldn't go to sleep that night. Some of my friends didn't find the movie frightening at all, but several days later found that they were having nightmares and couldn't go to sleep. Japanese horror movies seem to have a psychological effect on some people that lets them experience terror when they would least expect it (I know people who were affected by THE RING the same way).

However, I found THE GRUDGE to be one of the silliest, funniest, and most convoluted films that I have seen in a long time. I busted up laughing during the movie several times and was given strange stares by those around me. I just didn't find the movie very scary. Also, unlike some of my friends I didn't wake up days later having nightmares. Instead, I would find myself laughing at inopportune moments as I remembered some of the scenes from the movie. Most people I have talked to have thought my reactions to the film rather strange, but I have a friend who is a director and though he didn't find the movie to be funny, he did say ""it's garbage"".

There are many who will find the movie quite frightening. Personally, I recommend it to see the lovely Sarah Michelle Gellar. She might not be a great actress, but she is attractive. The film also has Bill Pullman in a supporting role and Pullman is usually a joy to watch on the big screen, too. Overall, though I didn't find THE GRUDGE very scary at all, I know that many do and it is seeing at least once for Gellar and Pullman's performances.",1161216000,,2320,4.479905437352246
29431,4,0767827759,"The Grudge is the American remake of the Japanese horror film. What's different about The Grudge is it's non-linear story line. At first you think it's three separate stories, then just two, and finally you realize that your seeing interspersed story lines from the past and from the present and they meet at the end of the film -- filling you in on the curse and what's happening. (Think Momento and Identity)

The scariest part of the story, and it is pretty creepy, is that because the curse born as a result of the first murder kills indiscriminately anyone who enters the house. Not immediately. Not in the same way. No matter what you do, you can't outwit it. If you were in the house, it's got your number. The scariest thing is most of the people involved were innocent -- they had nothing to do with the original killing, when seeing the ghost while shocked, they tried to help. Yet, still they died.  There might have been a way to avoid the curse but unfortunately, it didn't get carried out.

There's no CGI/FX -- everything is low key and creepy. I'd almost say this is more psychological horror than monster coming to get you horror but never the less -- you'll probably end up sleeping with the lights on and wondering if you should ever go into a house you don't know anything about again.",1161129600,4,1305,4.521186440677966
29432,4,0767827759,"According to The Grudge, there's a Japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of rage, then a curse is left behind. It's a ""stain"" that forever becomes a part of the place where the death occurred, and it will kill everything it touches. All I can say is if that were true then the movie-going public better hope I never die in a theater. The audience at this movie was probably the most obnoxious crowd I've ever had the displeasure of watching a movie with. Talk about being in a powerful grip of rage. More on that later.

Jump scenes rule the day here. That's right, this baby is stocked with jump scenes! If you're having a hard time deciphering my complicated terminology, then let me explain that a ""jump scene"" is one in which something startling happens to catch you off guard and makes you jump in your seat. Some people think jump scenes are cheap ploys to get a scare from the audience, but they're really well done in this movie. And they're manufactured frequently and shrewdly enough to keep you in a constant state of unease.

Unfortunately, when most moviegoers get scared they like to scream and then laugh and talk about it for 2 minutes afterwards. If you're gonna scream then scream. But then SHUT UP and WATCH THE MOVIE! This ain't a comedy and it certainly isn't a coffeehouse, so quit killin' my atmosphere.

Some of you might be a little agitated to know that The Grudge does follow some clichd horror movie conventions, such as a character investigating a creepy noise in a dark attic with only a cigarette lighter to illuminate the way. And of course, one character has to slowly follow a strange figure that shouldn't be there in the first place. But it's forgivable. Keep in mind, characters aren't necessarily supposed to know they're in a horror movie. I'm sure we've all explored strange noises before, except rather than a horrific, disfigured ghost producing the noise, in real life the sound is usually coming from Uncle Larry's bathroom excursion. Never underestimate the horror of a night out at the Taco Bell.

Comparisons to The Ring are inevitable, so I'll just say that I personally feel The Grudge is the creepier of the two. This is a movie that's heavy on atmosphere and freaky imagery. The Japanese ghosts creeped me out even more than the time I caught some pervert staring at me in the men's bathroom stall back in my college days. Lucky for him, he took off before I had a chance to demonstrate what happens when a person is caught in a powerful grip of rage.

But The Ring has the better story and a much better ending. The Grudge does a great job of keeping you guessing. You never really know where it's going, and since the story isn't linear you really have to pay attention. I know a lot of you have the attention span of a goldfish (about 9 seconds, you just learned something today, thank me later), so this may be problematic. I think it works fairly well, but one of my complaints is that near the end everything is wrapped up and explained rather quickly.

As a result, I wish the movie had been longer. A longer running time could've produced more in-depth character development, a more clever way to explain what was going on, and maybe even a better ending. And there's my biggest complaint. Why do so many horror movies feel the need to use the I Know What You Did Last Summer-esque ""look, there's gonna be a sequel"" ending? Come on, how about some closure? It's similar to if you're waiting for me to close out my review in a witty and funny fashion, but instead, for some reason I just decide to end the review in mid sent...

THE GIST

If you're looking for some Halloween entertainment, then The Grudge will give you some good jumps and surround you with creepy imagery. But I strongly recommend that you see it at a time when there won't be a big crowd because I know I would've enjoyed the movie a lot more had I not been surrounded by a lot of stand-up comedians who felt the need to crack jokes at the most tense and inopportune times. Folks, this is a horror movie. Tension and atmosphere are a big part of it... I look forward to watching the DVD in peace and quiet one day where the only idiots I'll possibly be surrounded by will be friends and family.

29433,5,0767827759,"WOW.  That's the only thing I can say after reading all sorts of negative reviews.  I admit, the very first time I watched the Grudge with my father NEITHER of us thought the movie was scary at all and couldn't understand its success, but after watching the movie a second time two months later by myself late at night I REALLY began to see how frightening the movie is.  Probably contains the same amount of fear as the original Exorcist, another movie that's really effectively well done.  You HAVE to watch the Exorcist and the Grudge at night to get the proper effect.

The Grudge benefits greatly when it comes to maintaining a moody atmosphere and a pretty interesting story.  I say ""pretty interesting"" because the storyline isn't the best, or the easiest to understand.  Just interesting enough to get the job done.  The Grudge also benefits when it comes to not giving away too much or too little.  In fact, this is probably its strongest point.

Every time something scary happens, you see just a ""little bit"" of that scary monster boy or some kind of strange shadow effect, which is *very* important if you want to effectively scare someone.  If the scary boy had appeared on screen for longer than a few seconds it wouldn't have scared me nearly as much because I would have gotten used to seeing it.  The boy appears, and then he's gone.  Not giving away too much REALLY works with this movie.  You see, to really scare me you simply CAN'T put a scary monster on screen for long periods of time and you HAVE to create a moody atmosphere to make the film believable.  The Grudge works *extremely* well it this area.

The fact that something scary happens almost always unexpectedly in the Grudge allows me to give the film another compliment.  I'm telling you, the scene with the woman inside that building by herself (well, except for a security guard) and having to travel home to an apartment building all by herself is about 10 minutes of total bone-chilling excitement.  I *loved* this scene.

I was totally on the edge of my seat wondering when the woman was finally going to have something bad happen to her.  The scene where the woman saw darkness coming before walking down the stairs and having to hurry up to get out of there was *awesome*, and the scene a few moments after this happened where she DID see something in the shadow was ANOTHER awesome display of bone-chilling brilliance.  There's a bunch of scenes like this throughout the movie.  Freakin' AWESOME!

Excellent pacing and suspense makes the Grudge a true horror classic, in my opinion.  I've seen a thousand horror movies in my time and I'd easily put the Grudge right up there as one of the best.

People today have drastically different opinions when it comes to what makes a movie scary.  Remember the good old days when everyone could agree that the Exorcist was the scariest movie of all-time?  I wish everyone agreed that the Grudge is a total classic, and that the Ring is another excellent one.",1160870400,18,2991,4.636882129277566

Sarah Michelle Gellar stars in this japanese remake that is really scary. She acts so well that I think she should get the oscar for horror movies (if there is such thing). It starts out that there is this ghost in this house that a new couple and their mother have just moved into. They don't realize that they are all dead. Which is really scary. Sarah investigates the truth behind this creature that lurks in the house. She discovers something really scary and in the end it left me and others in the audience breathless.

Seriously this movie isn't for the faint of heart it is classified as a horror/supernatural thriller if you're into movies like these, go for it, if not then stay as far away from it as you can. They are indeed making a sequel and yes Sarah Michelle Gellar lives and she will be in the sequel-BUT only for a brief appearence, rumors are circulating that she will show up after the opening credits and get killed immediately. She doesnt have the lead role. So if you so happen to read this review and plan on seeing the sequel in late October of this year Take my advice and WATCH THIS FIRST.

It's also one of those movies that is hard to describe the plot without giving spoilers, because it jumps back and forth through time, making it next to impossible to follow in a logical sequence.

There weren't any real surprises-- plenty of people following the old dictum of going through ""That Door""-- you know the one where everyone in the theater shouts, ""Don't go through that door!"" The people also climbed stairs and went into dark rooms without turning on lights-- plenty of people just begging to be victims.

29445,4,0767827759,"I watched the making of this movie before I saw it in theatres.  It was some HBO special or something like that.  Well, they were interviewing the director who is Japanese and he had some interesting things to say.

One was the Japanese culture believes their ghosts look like the ones in ""The Grudge"".  They have long hair, and pale skin.  Does ""The Ring"" come into mind?  The director also started talking about why some of their stories never have resolutions at the end.  He actually criticized American movies at the time too.  He was saying how our movies always have to solve their problems for it to be considered a good film.  They want it to be more like the good guy doesn't always win, which is true.

Then when I went and saw ""The Grudge"", I watched for what the director was talking about.  In the end, I liked the movie because each every movie is different and I think we should respect other cultures' ideas as well.

Maybe ""The Grudge"" wasn't the scariest movie, but now we get the idea of how they believe in ghosts and hauntings.",1149292800,2,1049,4.43455497382199
29446,1,0767827759,"This movie is as pointless as two squirrels screwing in a wool sock.

First of all, it's not scary.  Neither the plot nor characters provide any real ""horror"".  In fact, Toy Story was slightly scarier than The Grudge.  Simply because there are a few shock scenes, in which the main device to shock is a sudden change from very quiet to very loud, does not make a horror movie.  What's more, it sure doesn't make a good horror movie.

Sarah Michelle Gellar gives a lifeless performance as the lead.  I suspect that for this abomination of acting she'll be lashed until she drops, never to receive a lead role again in which she doesn't show full frontal nudity.  The only way she'll be investigating any more deaths is in a Scooby Doo sequel.

Oh my!  There's a person in the attic.  Wow!  There's a mute, old woman.  Watch out!  There's a little Japanese kid meowing like a cat.  It's simply people walking from one dark room to the next, being confused by whatever nonsense could be imagined without rhyme or reason.

It is incomprehensible, boring, lame, and predictable.  If it weren't for the director's well-placed jump scenes, strategically selected to shake-up an entire audience of people in full REM, this movie would be perfect for someone with terrible insomnia.",1148774400,3,1273,4.739726027397261
29447,4,0767827759,"I knew this 2004 horror film was a remake of the Japanese movie ""Ju-on,"" in the tradition of ""Ringu""/""The Ring,"" but I did not know that it was filmed in Japan by the same director, Takashi Shimizu (I tend to avoid finding out a lot about films until I actually see them so that I be pure of mind when I first watch them). This makes a big difference because the idea behind this production is behind both the strengths and the weaknesses of ""The Grudge"" as a film. However, since I lived in Japan for a couple of years, have enjoyed Japanese films in general and ""Spirited Away"" in particular, and have an ability to understand non-linear narrative forms, I have to admit that I have a peculiar position from which to view the film (so take what follows with a grain of salt).

As the opening of the film explains, ""When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is born. The curse gathers in that place of death. Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury."" When you listen to the DVD extras you learn that there is another key ingredient: the source of that rage is that the victim does not know why they were murdered. This is important because this is not your typical American horror movie where the guilty die grizzly deaths. The innocent are the only items on the menu this time around. If you want other clear indications that this is a Japanese horror movie then notice that Shimizu goes for the creeps over suspense (guessing who is next to die is never difficult), the camera never lingers on the film's grossest images, and seeing the ghost happens early and often. The last one presents the most problems in terms of cultural translation because the Japanese conception of demons is so foreign to American audiences (I know, duh, but it is true) as is the idea of a Japanese monster house (""Obakeyashiki"").

Executive producer Sam Raimi had seen ""Ju-on"" and came up with the idea of remaking the movie in Japan with the same director but with American actors for an English speaking audience. So this is not the same thing as splicing in scenes of Raymond Burr to turn ""Gojira"" into ""Godzilla,"" but it is somewhat pointed in that same direction. Stephen Susco's screenplay has to come up with reasons why the American actors are working (and dying) in Japan and while he certainly comes up with plausible means of employment, there is an elephant in the living room in that the body count consists mostly of gaijin but that is never a part of the equation. Granted, Detective Nakagawa (Ryo Ishibashi) is suspicious of the house given what had happened three years earlier, but this film really needed to deal with the gaijin issue better (I was going to say that having more Japanese killed off in the movie would help, but then we have the problem a gaijin being the heroine in a story set in Japan).

However, at some point a decision was made for Jeff Betancourt to edit ""The Grudge"" in a non-linear fashion. Now, what they came up with is an interesting approach, but clearly most viewers are not picking up on what is happening right away. Beginning with the opening deaths before the title credits are over, ""The Grudge"" follows the first death backwards to the beginning of the tale and the second forward to the ending. These two plotlines alternate to the climax in which they actually come together. Unfortunately, this is just way too convenient as the only way that our heroine can understand what is going on. At a point where the puzzle is coming together we are wondering how this is happening when the focus should be on understanding why everything is happening.

Another way in which the production is more interesting than the movie is the limited use of CGI. Throughout the commentary track, Sarah Michelle Gellar talks about the lengths to which Japanese filmmakers keep things real. The shot of the hand coming out of the back of her character's head in the shower is not a CGI shot. The ghost creepily crawling down the stairs is all the performance of actress Takako Fuji and not a puppet on wires or anything else. When characters listen to messages on an answering machine, there are actually messages on the answering machine. But, again, unless you check out the DVD extras you have no way of appreciating the realism of this particular movie. The more you check out the more you will rethink what is going on in the movie.

""The Grudge"" is a creepy movie where the ghost is a lot more interesting than Karen the heroine. But then most of the characters are simply in the wrong place at the wrong time so that bad things can happen to them. Still, my wife screamed twice and jumped three times while watching this, so it can have the desired effect (at least on those unaccustomed to the way modern horror films work). More importantly, the attempt to make a Japanese horror movie for Americans, versus an American version of a Japanese horror movie, is worth paying attention to. Ultimately, I am trying to convince you to watch this movie twice, after checking out all of the DVD features in between.",1147737600,,5063,4.590055248618785
29448,3,0767827759,"I didn't expect much from the Grudge.  Whenever a trailer has difficulty in explaining the plot, I lower my expectations.  ""When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born"" seems a bit awkward.  The ""grip"" of a ""powerful"" rage?  Not a really bad rage?  What exactly is a rage's grip anyway?

This challenge, the failure to explain exactly the plot behind the horror, saps the terror from the movie.  I should warn readers now that I'm going to make a lot of comparisons to The Ring, a movie that scared the living crap out of me, because the two have a lot of similarities. We are venturing into Spoilerland.

So let's talk about similarities.  Although The Grudge is most certainly not a copy of The Ring, there are enough similarities to make comparisons inevitable. Besides the simplistic titles (""The NOUN, a new Japanese horror, coming to a theater near you!""), both films feature crawling girls with long hair covering their faces, a viral curse, and ghosts that defy the traditional boundary of staying in their respective haunted houses.  The climax is even similar: both heroines struggle to save the male love interest before he too becomes infected.

The primary difference between the two films is style. Where The Ring creates a set of rules and then systematically breaks them (or, depending on your perspective, doesn't break them at all but stops reminding you about them), The Grudge isn't encumbered by such rules, to its detriment.  This makes the movie hard to follow. In addition, the scenes unfold out of order, explaining what happened to each victim and thereby illustrating the original murder, Memento style.

Here's what I was able to piece together from the deleted scenes: Kayako (Takako Fuji) and Takeo (Takashi Matsuyama) Saeki move into a new home with their son, Toshio (Yuya Ozeki) and his pet cat.  While attending school, Kayako becomes infatuated with Peter Kirk (Bill Pullman), her professor.  When Takeo discovers her many love notes to the professor, he goes on a berserk rage, murdering Kayako, Toshio, and the cat. Then he kills himself.

The curse kicks in pretty quickly after that.  Peter discovers something is wrong and visits the house, only to be infected by the curse, which eventually causes him to throw himself off a rooftop.

Three years later, Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her pretty-boy boyfriend Doug (Jason Behr) move to Japan as part of an exchange program.  Karen is a healthcare worker who specializes in taking care of the elderly.  A house now inhabited by the Williams family, including Matthew (William Mapother), his wife Jennifer (Clea DuVall), and Matthew's elderly mother Emma (Grace Zabriskie).  When the regular healthcare worker doesn't show up for work one day, Karen is called in to pick up the slack. She's got a new assignment that just happens to be in that Saeki house...

The beauty of The Ring was the development of its characters.  It established people who, when faced with spreading evil or the death of their family, gladly chose the greater evil.  It dove into the complicated relationship between two parents in a modern age who don't know how to be adults, much less parents.  And it peeled away at the voyeuristic core in every one of us, who engages in peeping merely by sitting in a movie theater or watching television...and then punished us for it.

The Grudge is not nearly so high-minded. The curse spreads quickly; so quickly, in fact, that I had a vision of the Japanese National Guard being finally called in to stop the madness when two hundred people are found dead at the Sakei house.  Ghosts change form, appear on camera, make weird cat noises, show up seemingly at random, and kill some people quickly but take longer to murder others.

I've never been a fan of Gellar, and her performance didn't change my mind. Karen has no spark with Doug on screen, and their relationship is barely fleshed out.  Culture shock is briefly explored in Jennifer's struggle with understanding the Japanese world, but not enough to make us really feel her pain.  Not even Jennifer's relationship with Matthew has any real depth. And Gellar seems way too old to be a giddy exchange student.

The only characters that are actually fleshed out are the members of the Sakei family.  The deleted scenes make it clear that we're not witnessing one traditional American ghost haunting, but a ghost house of sorts, which utilizes all four bodies (yes, even the cat), to kill its victims.  And we come to realize that they are all reenacting their deaths over and over, from the croak of Kayako's severed vocal chords to the shriek of Toshio's poor cat.  Unfortunately, critical plot points connecting the first murders with the subsequent deaths were cut, seriously undermining the shuffled scenes. Half the fun is piecing together why the curse took place and connecting the murders to the original event; when you can't make those connections, the film just becomes incoherent.

And that's the problem.  With a ghost that can invade your office building, your home, or your bed, we lose all hope that the heroine can even defeat it.  The final solution, that the house must be burned to the ground, doesn't seem like a solution at all.  When the ghost(s) can look like people you know and call you on your cell phone, the evil seems to have such power that we never believe the heroine has a realistic chance of surviving.

The movie is still creepy.  After all, Sam Raimi executive produced. The film is beautifully shot with minimal special effects.  The same creepy-crawly stumbling that made Samara so horrifying is in evidence here.  The Grudge also makes use of a multitude of horrible sounds, including the aforementioned caterwauling and death-rattling.

Unfortunately, that's not enough to really make The Grudge a scary movie for Western audiences.",1147737600,3,5867,4.889787664307381

In all Horror movies or thrillers, as a director, or writer, you must succed in answering the 'Why?' of the movie. I'll admit that they did that partially but, I wanted more of a reason. This movie was your typical shockfest with no real reason or resolve. Even watching the movie in the theatre, with many people making noises, I knew that the movie was going to be bad. I walked out the last twenty minutes of the movie. I'm going to give everyone a piece of advice for the purposes of this movie: If you have to seriously wait for the movie to answer the why throughout the whole movie, don't see it.

True, some scary parts are scattered throughout but it's all for nothing and has no rhyme or reason. I'm surprised that this movie did so well in the box office. But, when you take a look at hollywood right now they have really been focusing on remakes and Japanese horror. And this is both. But, don't choose style over plot!

I've even heard that they're making a GRUDGE 2. God help them. My friend told me that JU-ON, which is the original, was much more satisfying with much more reason.

In short: The characters were flat, there were stupid characters just waltzing into a dark room not knowing what they were going to find, there are unexplained sightings of ghosts and things, the main character doesn't know what is going on and, quite frankly, doesn't hold your interest for too long.

29457,1,0767827759,"The prefaces of reviewing the grudge will hopefully allay concerns of people who enjoyed this... movie and are just reading to compare notes. The preface is simply this, a movie has a beginning middle and an end. It has development and it moves, no matter how confined the actual settings are. If character development is not an issue (and it isn't generally in horror movies) then plot movement is vital. To be more specific it is vital to making a good horror movie.

The grudge does not move. It does not plod either, but patiently instead walks constantly in the same circle, slightly alternating steps on each cycle. In effect this is a director's filmmaking exercise, taking the same elements of horror repeatedly and putting them in different containers. The sounds - including a sort of a Bjork Medulla-ish, throatal, moaning as children often make to prove they have a sore throat, isn't especially effective. The shadows are a little better in framing the suspense, but the small japanese house used as a setting is too symetrical and neat to be frightening.

Being PG-13 there are no chills from gore or violence or shock, all action is cut away from at the last second to maximize the potential audience. Imagine the same effect as Aliens vs. Predator's rating minus the attractive face of Sanaa Lathan or laughably bad directing. So instead we are repeated to the same teases as AVP offered. All buildup, no payoff. No variety, no change of pace, and no characters with interesting enough personalities to break the mood.

Our 'story' begins (or more accurately our stage is set) in a Japanese hotel room. A sudden suicide leaves a woman widowed, her husband having thrown himself over their balcony with no explanation or warning. From there the premise as explained in the trailers is played out. When someone dies in extreme agony the curse stays and all who encounter it are cursed. That's all. There are no Poltegiest of Hellraiser type developments. All we have are a series of excuses to show off the next scare tactic approxamitely every 15-20 minutes.

This is not a movie.

29458,2,0767827759,"The Grudge, based on a Japanese horror film, involves a haunted house that seems to destroy everything it touches and the lives of Americans living in Japan. It's off to a bad start from the begining when it fails to explain how these characters came about to living in Japan and just gives them titles like exchange student and Professor. I happen to know for a fact that Japan is one of the homogenous countries in the world, which is just a way of saying very few non-Japanese people live there. Also the Japanese characters, seemingly few for a movie set in Japan, all talk in perfect english. Well people don't see this kind of movie for an insight into Japanese culture anyway.

Apparently we learn that the haunted house the movie center's around once had a family that was murdered in it (and they fail to tell the American family moving in, yeah right). There's also a professor who in the past had encountered the house and surcomed to his death because of it. Sarah Michelle Geller's character encounters this house, finds it's not an ordinary house, and investigates. Trust me I'm giving nothing away; even if I wanted to it would be impossible for me to explain the major plot points. There are visual sequences that could very well have been effective had the story made any sense what so ever. Simply put this film is one scene after another of a noise, or an image, or a phenoma without the slightest bit of coherence to a plot. It's riddled with inconsistancies and there's a flashback sequence as uncomprehesible as anything else in this film. There's also no character developement, which might be the least of it's problems.

Judging by my writing so far I should give it just one star, but I hesitate due to the visual nature. As I said there are scenes that could be effective in a better story. It does have a sense of creepiness, though I really was never scared. I can compare this to The Ring, another visually strong film, but one that was actually going somewhere, and was intrigueing, and yes was actually frieghtening. The Grudge plays us like a yo-yo, yanking us again and again without purpose, and in the end we're lost in comprehension.",1138320000,2,2170,4.619170984455959

It's ridiculous that regular people can't go see the original versions of films, they probably would more, if Hollywood wasn't so determined to remake films, and put American actors in just to make it more viewer friendly.

The only good thing about this film was the little boy who appears. He is so creepy. I jumped so many times, he's a talented actor for someone so young, and can show so much with just his eyes. It's also very well edited, and is quick enough to make you think ""did I just see that?""

There's too many of your usual horror movie cliches in this, including looking for something in an attic with only a lighter to light your way and a character following another character that shouldn't or isn't there in the first place. There's also no character development, and it took me a wee while to work out why the character had done what he did in the first place. In fact, I'm still not sure what happened. Most of the characters are severely underused, Bill Pullman & Clea Duvall being the main two, and instead all the focus is on Sarah Michelle Gellar. Who just doesn't work in this kinda role. I know she appeared in many episodes of Buffy, but I've never seen it, so I can't compare. There just wasn't something right. Her face was also very distracting, there's something NOT right with her nose. It's almost like she's been under the knife, cos I don't remember her nose being like that!

The timeline just doesn't make any sense to me, there's a couple of different storylines happening, which are linked, but one storyline is going forwards in time, and another is going backwards. Get your head around that one if you will.

The story line is hard to follow, and after watching I had to read the back of the DVD case to see what this flick was supposed to be about.

There...that's a better start to the review. And a good way to end it. Don't buy this; rent it if you must (or catch it on cable), but don't say I didn't warn you.

29467,2,0767827759,"The story was hard to nail down, so I'm still not quite sure what the grudge was supposed to be. The story bounces around so much that the viewer is never really aware of who's who and what's going on. Confusing story telling to say the least.

Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing. The only thing remotely scary about this movie is the sound the thing makes, now that was creepy. Watch it if you want, but don't say I didn't warn you. Some may love it. I'm a spooky horror movie fan from way back, if I didn't like it you can bet it's not a great movie. But as they say, to each his own.",1132617600,4,590,4.042735042735043

tell u wat, it turned out to be SUCH a disappointment. i actually laughed at some of the scenes. a ""horror"" film? u've got to be kidding me. this is one of the worst horror films i've ever seen in my life if not downright the worst. the actors/actresses showed no talent at all throughout the film. and i just thought that the plot and theme was ridiculous.

this is the slowest moving film on earth i can guarantee u that u'll fall asleep during it.

it's a total waste of time, don't bother buying the dvd if u got that on mind. it's not even worth watching one time.",1131667200,,730,4.090909090909091
29470,3,0767827759,"Well, I saw the original first, which, eh, that one was okay too but this one was kind of a little less okay in some parts a little more okay in other parts. For one thing. Ugh, the acting was just really really bad.  It made the movie as a whole just look like a really really low budget old godzilla movie.  The script was just as bad.

However, like the godzilla movies, there's just something interesting about the plot that grabs you.  Now the original grudge done in japan ju-on would've been better but it was a little dragged out and well, i'm too used to american special effects. low budget america and low budget japan are two different things. low budget america means cartoon like computer graphics that glow off the screen and looks like a joke, and japan low budget is like, home video camera and planets hanging from little strings.  don't know how anime manages to rock so much with their graphics but i don't think their film industry's quite there yet.

anyway, so ju-on had too many random characters that all did their own thing and met up with the grudge. it was okay but kind of like reading a weekly comic book series with a new episode and adventure every week. so what america does is realize this and chop it up and cut out characters and shorten other characters parts to leave room for a main character and i'm left even more confused with the newer version than the original.

so now i'm complaining that ju-on dragged, and the grudge was a rushed chopped up piece of bad acted out liver with sarah michelle geller in it who really really disappointed me considering the fact that i know who she is and therefore i want to be impressed by a veteran actress and instead had to sit there thinking how old she was starting to look. that's bad. when i sit there just thinking that you're more wrinkled than you were in buffy that means you need to try harder.

however, this is why it gets three stars and not two or one. the japanese version didn't really go anywhere. it introduced the grudge concept. showed off the grudge concept. end. it just did it and that was it. the american version tried to tie it together a little and show why it happened and explained things in a more timely manner. basically like, lets unfold this mystery. this is the mystery building up. this is why. japan was kind of like. this is the grudge. growl. scare. roar. grudge. grrrr. end.

like i said. both movies kind of sucked. i liked it cause i like horror movies but ju-on impressed me more with the scary scenes even with the lesser special effects and comic book like pace and america kind of bored me in that way with the rushed chopped liver aspect. they just didn't reproduce the scary moments well enough and didn't come up with enough unique ones all on their own. but the end was a teeny tiny bit better in the american version. not the whole end. but the endish area was a little better. however, the bad part was america threw in a really cheap thing all of a sudden out of nowhere that america always does where the main character tries to be the hero whereas in the japanese version she was the victim only. end.

My whole point? good concept. done badly. japan's was better overall.  should've tried harder or not at all. could've been great i think. they had the right idea to try a remake just didn't give it their all. they should've taken full advantage of our special effects because that's really sad that the planets hanging from little strings in a video camera impressed me more than our own computer graphics.

i also liked and hated the fact that it was also in japan. for godsake's why don't you just use the same freaking movie set and actors for crying out loud. geez. can't you be a little creative?  not only are we gonna remake a movie almost word for word and image for image, lets make it in the exact same house, in the exact same city, in the exact same foreign language. its like, why'd you even bother with an american version if you're gonna make it in frickin japan. just so you could replace the main character for sarah michelle geller?  geez, all you really had to do was glue and paste then.",1131580800,3,4146,4.409685863874346

29472,4,0767827759,"I remember when my mother watched this movie and thought it was one of the worst movies she ever watched. Still, I was tempted to test that idea that this was just a ""clunky piece of trash"" as my mom called it. I had never really watched many Japanese horror films besides the brilliant AUDITION, so I thought I would give this 'American' version of Ju-On: The Grudge a chance. What was my overall verdict? You'll find out later.

At the beginning of the movie we meet Peter, a likable guy who later commits suicide, but for what? We find that out later. Cut to the next frame of the film in which we meet Yoko...a sweet and gentle Japanese girl who is tending to the care of a rather distraught old woman. The woman seems to have a sleeping disorder, so most of the time she is either sleeping or she is awake but silent, never really speaking at all. We do learn why she's in the state later on, and believe me once you see why you too will be scared. Now Yoko is left to clean up the mess in that house (absolutely no one in my home would ever leave a mess like this, and there are several parts in the film when the house is in complete disarray). Yoko suddenly hears a noise in one of the rooms on the upper level of the house, a thumping on the ceiling. As she goes to investigate after opening the door to the attic, she discovers to her terror a ghastly girl (Yuya Ozeki in creepy form like her ""Ju-On"" role) who attacks her, and the film cuts from there.

Next up, we meet Karen and Doug (Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr), two lovers and students studying abroad who seem very happy. Karen also works to help tend to the care of people much like Yoko was, and after the agency discovers her missing, Karen is placed in lieu of her mysterious departure. Karen goes to the house to to tend to the care of the woman, but she has no idea what she's in store for once she's there. You see, there's a curse on this house, and we don't know it at this point, but a family who lived in that house when through a deadly ordeal. The wife of the previous family had an affair with Peter (Bill Pullman's character, in top form here) and the husband found her out, so in a fit of rage, he drowned his son and murdered his wife before committing suicide. Karen has no idea that these events took place, but she will later. As time goes on, another family descends upon the house led by Jennifer (Clea Duvall, a rather disposable performance - she was better in The Faculty), who is rather depressed. The police are also investigating the disappearance of Yoko and some murders that have taken place, and they discover a jaw in the attic. Throughout the movie, anyone who comes into contact with ""the curse"" will ultimately be pursued by it until they are killed by its consumption. The moments in the high rise apartment are tense, but the scariest moment of the movie is when one of the agency workers is walking down the stairs and the beaten down Yoko appears, dragging herself towards the stairs going down. When the worker slowly heads in Yoko's direction, he slips on a substance on the floor...her blood. When he asks what happened, she turns around and reveals...oh, but I can't give it away. But let me say this, it scared me when I saw what happened to Yoko. The detective (Ryo Ishibashi) reveals the story behind the ""curse"" to Karen, and there are many moments in the movie where you will see flashbacks to the events that occured in the house. Later in the movie, Doug, disturbed by what's happened to Karen, who witnessed the ""curse"" firsthand, decides to go off investigating things in the house on his own. When Karen finds that out, she heads to the house where the climax comes into play. She relives moments of the past in the house, where Peter has come to find the mother hung by her neck and the child scared. Things aren't in a good state as Karen witnesses, but reality comes back into play and the scary girl is after Karen to kill her off.

In the final frame of the film, director Takashi Shimizu delivers a nice close. With the body of Doug under covers after his death, Karen goes to his body and sees for herself, but the ""curse"" seems to have found her and suddenly someone is standing behind her - the ""curse"" girl who has been tormenting some of the previous contacts and the film cuts with that rasping noise and the girl's creepy eyes. It's bound to make you look forward to next year's The Grudge 2, due out October 26.

In the meantime, the director's cut offers 8 minutes of unseen footage, and a plethora of extras. No doubt if you want to see a good remake of a classic Japanese horror film (JU-ON was scary), then THE GRUDGE should ultimately satisfy your appetite. While not a classic in its own merits, THE GRUDGE is the ultimate story of the worst kind of ""curse"" that could ever be left behind.",1130976000,,4839,4.355481727574751

Now, as Gellar is putting the woman to sleep, something comes up to the side of her and shocks the hell out of her...it looks like a japanese girl..floating. Then, we get into flashbacks of when the old woman (Zabriskie) bought the house with her daughter, played by Clea DuVall (Identity) and her daughter's husband played by William Mapother (Tv's LOST). Also, Gellar finds out about a man named Peter, played by Bill Pullman (Zero Effect), as she experiences a flashback of him and finds out the secret to why this woman has such a grudge against the people. You either dig it or you dont, is my saying and I dug it to a certain point where it kinda went downhill from there. Director Takashi Shimizu rewrote this story Ju-On: The Grudge which has a lot more effective and better then this one...this one is the neutered hollywood version. Gellar costar's with actor Jason Behr (Tv's Roswell) who worked with her on one episode of Buffy, surprisingly as one of her ex-boyfriends in that episode...here, he plays her boyfriend who goes threw the grudging pains, as I like to call it. Some stuff is creepy, other stuff is kinda gets annoying like the cat meows and the rasping voice on the telephone...even the girl kinda reminds me of the girl from The Ring which blows it off, but she's a Japanese girl...I don't know, maybe the girl from The Ring and the girl from The Grudge should make a movie called Ring Girl and Grudge Girl Take A Holiday.

29475,4,0767827759,I went into this film in the theater with very low expectations. Around that time a lot of campy bad horror movies were coming out and so I didn't expect this to be much different. I was very wrong. Though the story skips around a bit and is hard to follow at first you soon find yourself immersed in this movie. The story is great and the actors are good. My boyfriend got pretty scared at a couple of parts when and we usually don't scare that easy. It doesn't have that usually happy ending but kinda leaves you with the possibility of a sequel. Watching the original Japanese version clears up a lot of whole in the American plot so I would recommend watching that as well.,1128729600,2,677,4.296875
29476,3,0767827759,"The main theme of this movie is that a powerful negative force inhabits a place after someone has died a violent death, and that this negative force consumes all who touch the place in which the violent act occurred. This idea is not new, and many conjecture that what people believe are ""ghosts"" are in fact leftover energy from just such traumatic events. However, most American audiences want the ""wronged parties"" or ""ghosts"" to produce a moral outcome- either the punishment of the murderer(s) or the revelation of how the victims died. What most Americans don't really ""get"" or appreciate is this malevolent force striking out at random victims- the current occupants of the house, whoever they may be, however transient. This just spawns more innocent victims and seems pointless. On the positive side, the technical elements of the film were excellent, the parts of the film that were supposed to be scary were indeed scary, and the roles were well acted. In fact, for you Buffy fans out there, did you notice that Sarah Michele Gellar was reunited with two BTVS alumni? Jason Behr, who played her love interest, was Billy Ford in ""Lie to Me"", and the American wife who was caring for her mother-in-law before she was murdered by the ""ghosts"" was played by the same actress who played Marcie Ross in ""Out of Mind Out of Sight"" from season one.",1128643200,,1351,4.777777777777778

This movie is the lamest horror movie I've ever seen. The kids have it right on this one. This ""horror"" movie is stupid. The fact that any adults actually find this movie worth watching is more horrific than the movie itself. I sincerly hope that The Grudge finds itself grudgingly doomed to the bargin bins of stores everywhere for all eternity.

However I do recommend this video to any ""christian"" families which might be trying to find horror movie suitible for toddlers. This movie won't give anyone a nightmare, except for the parents who will wake up screaming because of what they paid for it.

29480,3,0767827759,"Having only heard disappointing reviews about ""The Grudge"", I went into this film with very low expectations.  I had remembered the television previews and decided that I would watch this film if for nothing else, than at least to see what all of the creepy images had to do with.  To my disbelief, this film actually had a decent plot and was told in an interesting enough manner, to keep me fully attentive during the over-drawn portions of the film(and there are many).

The film takes place in Tokyo and we are immediatly introduced to Karen(Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her boyfriend Doug.  They are foreign exchange students attending college and adapting to their new surroundings.  Karen is a social worker and is sent on her first case.  She is to take care of an elderly woman, struggling from what the doctors believe to be dementia.  Well, they are wrong.  As Karen finds out, there is something very wrong with the house this woman is living in and KAren apparently feels it the moment she walks in.  After a hair-raising evening, Karen is sent to a hospital so that she can be kept close watch on.  Oddly enough, the horror and images Karen saw in the house are now following her and won't leave her alone.  In fact, these images are following everyone that has visited the house, including the detectives sent in to see what was going on.  Why?  Did something happen in that house years ago??  Who is the little boy, that is just waaaaaaay too creepy???

These are the questions that will be answered throughout the remainder of the film.

""The Grudge"" does a pretty good job of keeping the viewer rather tense and on the egde of their seat.  This film is another example of the Japanese horror film gone AMerican and I am very curious to see the original Japanese version of this film, as I feel that it would rely much less on the special effects for the scares.  No gore in this film and although the images are scary, our two villians are a little Japanese boy and his mother----not really the sort of folks that will give you nightmares.  It was a good decision to tell this story in non-linear form, as the plot would probably have been much duller and predictable had they not.

All in all, this is a decent film, certainly worth a viewing.  Not suitable for children as the depictions of ghosts are probably going to keep them up nights.

29481,4,0767827759,"From all the hype I've been hearing since it's release, I would have thought that this was going to be a horrible movie, and I was wrong. This movie isn't half as bad as the majority lead some to believe.

The plot was fascinating, even if it is just another haunted house story, it is probably the best haunted house story I have seen and I have seen a lot. I wouldn't go as far as to say that this movie is scary, I didn't think so, but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.

I was very surprised on how well Sarah Michelle Gellar did in her role. Very shocked, I thought that this was just going to be another teen horror flick but it was surprisngly fun. It has taken me this long since it's release to watch the movie and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed in what I saw. And after watching the American version of the Ring, I thought I would be.

So the moral of the story is that if you are afraid that this movie is going to suck, take a chance and at least watch it when it comes on TV. You may be surprised, just as I was, and end up liking. It taking place in Japan was an added plus. The only flaw was that this was like a Tarantino film, ie, this has flashbacks with no warning given.

29482,2,0767827759,"The Evil Dead team of Sam ""Spider-Man"" Raimi and producer Bob Tapert helped bring this American adaptation of Takashi Shimizu's Ju-On: The Grudge to life; only it's more stripped down and accessable for American audiences who gushed over the Ring (which began this whole new horror fad of re-making Japanese horror films that are rated PG-13).  The Grudge begins promisingly enough with Bill Pullman and a surprising turn of events, before introducing Sarah Michelle Gellar, in her first post-Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie that doesn't feature a computer animated talking dog, as a young American woman in Tokyo with her boyfriend (Roswell's Jason Behr).  Since the girl who usually watches an inept woman is missing, she gets the duty, and soon enough, plenty of spooky things are happening in this house, and the film shifts back and forth revealing the story of what happened.  As a previous reviewer stated, the Grudge is more of an intriguing production that a great horror film, with clever camera tricks substituting for CGI-animated ghosts and spectres.  However, the film is predictable to it's very end, and even though Shimizu is in the driver's seat once again, it's surprising how much this Americanized version fails in comparison to the original.  It's not half as creepy as it thinks it is, and despite a solid performance from Gellar, it's hard seeing her as a helpless damsal after years of watching her kick vampire behind.  In the end, the Grudge is a disappointing mainstream, teen-aimed thriller that fails to deliver, and while this ""unrated"" director's cut includes some more graphic footage, it's still worth avoiding for long time horror fans.",1127174400,,1670,5.0989010989010985

It's a dumb clich&eacute; horror movie with the old haunted house thing going.  The interesting thing is that it alternates between dumb pseudo-expository scenes that reveal trivially small amounts of information, but the backstory is so obvious, aside from a few TINY details, that it HURT MY BRAIN.

Not to mention I like movies with resolutions.  I will refrain from posting a spoiler, but if you want horror films to have a little bit more than just a few startling moments and then bad acting and obnoxious CGI ghost things and a complete lack of a resolution, which is one of the most important parts of any story, than I guess this is the movie for you.",1126742400,3,812,4.386666666666667
29484,2,0767827759,"I suppose I could give this move a better rating if it made sense.  But basically it is just a compilation of creepy moments to make people jump, that's all.  Speaking of jumping this movie jumps and bounces around like a check from Delta Airlines.  I had no idea what was going on, except for the fact that something terrible happened to two people in this house a long time ago and now they are pissed off and became Scary Eyed Cripple Woman and her sidekick Cat-Boy.

Just when I think I am beginning to understand what is going on, another wrench is thrown in the mix making me realize that I don't know what the hell is going on.  The characters and acting in this movie are pretty bad, but I must admit not horrible.  I was about to fall asleep on this movie on several occasions, however the writers must have known when people are about to fall asleep then they bring out a scary scene to make you jump and keep you awake.

The only thing this movie accomplished is that it did keep me watching it for the entire movie, but in hindsight, I can't believe I was able to sit through this.  While I admit this movie did scare me in a few places, I was VERY disappointed at the ending....IT MADE NO SENSE!  It reminded me off the old horror movies from my teenage years that always would leave you hanging.

If you want to be scared then you definitely will be in this movie, but as far as being a genuine horror movie, you are looking the WRONG place!  It has some very good scary moments, but it's too bad there is not a story line to go along with it.",1126742400,4,1557,4.191275167785235
29485,3,0767827759,"I have not seen the original of this movie, so (if the reviews of others are anything to go by), I am lucky to be able to judge this movie without the acclaimed original in my head as a template.

And, I am both amazed and happy to report, as a movie in its own right, this version of ""The Grudge"" more than holds its own against its contemporary horror heavyweights.

Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar (in a much smaller role than one would have thought) and a host of forgettable extras (with the exception of Bill Pullman, again in a tiny role), this movie loosely follows the `haunted house' plot of so many horror movies - funny goings-on inspire further investigation, leading to a high-body-count misadventure resulting in closure for our hapless heroine - but since ""The Grudge"" rehashes this predictable-ish plot with such undeniable style and flair, as well as a few big twists, we don't mind.

The first thing that strikes me about this movie is that yes, it is genuinely creepy, with some true-blue shock moments. The jump factor is high, and these shocks and scares (bar the initial dealings with Yoko, the care-worker) never feel tired or predictable. It's thanks directly to the expert direction of Takashi Shimizu that this is the case.

Initially, the American Exchange Students-moving-to-Japan plot element feels like a cheat - divisive and base, and a way of moving the action of this remake closer to the tone of the original movie - but happily, an above-average script (for the genre) and a lack of focus on the Westernisation of the lead characters means that this actually works more in the movie's favour. Karen, Doug, the Williams family and the  Kirk family all feel more isolated and alone in their nightmare because of the culture barrier, and not because of some run-of-the-mill horror movie aspects.

Visual effects are minimalist and achingly stylish, the scene with the security cameras and the final black-and-white expository flashbacks are some really marvellous examples of what can be established when real talent sits behind the camera, unencumbered by a desire to show off. Affecting and moving, the washed-out colours and ingenious creatures and set-pieces provide a very sympathetic (almost forgiving!) backdrop for some solid, if unstellar, performances from the cast.

All in all, this really is an excellent effort, and, when taken in-context with its genre peers (The Ring, Dark Water), it's probably the best of the remakes, too. If `Candyman' was the best horror movie of the Ninties, then `The Grudge' is certainly a contender for that crown now. Recommended.",1126742400,2,2605,4.988479262672811

The music is perfect and the camera angles are extraordinary.  More American directors need to learn how to create mood the way Shimuzu does.  I pride myself in not jumping back during a scary part but found myself kept doing it.  This film has a great story line, awesome scary moments, and good acting (all without gore and slashing with knives and I think only one or two swear words).  I hope we can see more movies like this in Hollywood - I always find it funny when Hollywood is surprised when a movie like this does well in the box office and a remake of Bad News Bears or The Honeymooners tanks!  Great original movie (although a Japanese remake)!",1125964800,,927,4.470238095238095
29488,1,0767827759,"I liked how it took place in Japan, Chickensaurus. I thought that was cool. I thought it might be a pretty good movie, but once Sarah Michelle Gellar saw the darkhair and eyeballs coming from the ceiling. SCARY. and then I lost it; didn't know what was going on. No more Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It seemed. What the are you doing here. Over here. Bill Pullman, the President and Lone Star -- I think his career is going down the crapper if this role is any indication. But that is about it. Quite Frankly with Steven A. Smith, I did not know what the hell was going on in this movie.

Here are movies, Similar to this genre I liked:
Jeepers Creepers (part 2 sucked)
Signs (I like all Night Shyamalan's)

Didn't Like:
Blair Witch

29489,3,0767827759,"The Grudge is an interesting little horror film. It's very cool and cerebral and a little dull for long periods and then it wakes you up with a nasty scare. It's not great but it's hardly  the worst movie either. Sarah Michelle Gellar is basically playing Buffy without powers and without the neurosis. She's saddled with a cute but dumb as dirt boyfriend who, like the boyfriend in The Ring turns out to be fairly useless. Since I brought up The Ring I have to say that my first feeling about the Grudge was that it was a Ring rip off. When the ghost comes crawling down the stairs it looks just like Samara Morgan coming out of the TV but after watching a few Japanese horror movies I've come to the conclusion that the ghosts in this particular genre tend be grotesquely misshapen things that creep and have messy hair.

The Grudge was okay. I wouldn't buy it and I'm glad I didn't see it in the theaters but it has its moments.",1125878400,,931,4.344827586206897

Yes this movie is a supernatural tale. And it is scary. There is more then one part that will make you jump. And that is what I like about this movie. It can scare you without all the unnecessary violence and blood. The level of expectation is kept up throughout the whole movie. It kept my suspense level almost peaked the entire movie.

The story is well written. It gives you time to think. And the horror seems to never end. Just keeps coming and coming...it will keep you on the edge of your seat.

I would recommend watching this in a dark room with friends. Those who scream and jump will just add to the suspense for you.",1125100800,3,898,4.179190751445087
29492,4,0767827759,"Is this movie scary?  In a few places, yes.  However, this movie is more than scary, it is creepy and icky, and breaks the typical American formula for horror movies.  This movie is a matter of style.  If you prefer your horror movies told linearly and your idea of fear is ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,""  then ""The Grudge"" is likely not for you.  On the other hand, if you like some of Alfred Hitchcock's movies that like to build atmosphere, this movie could well hold your interest.

At the beginning of the movie we are told that ""When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is born.  The curse gathers in that place of death.  Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury.""  Another non-obvious ingredient of this rage is that the person who died does not know why they were murdered.  I was already feeling creepy and the movie had yet to really begin.

Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) has been hired to fill in at a nice house.  It seems that the girl that normally works there has disappeared (which we got to see near the beginning of the movie - one of the ""boo!"" moments in this movie).  Weird things start happening almost immediately, but the intensity builds and builds, and Karen seems to keep questioning whether what she is seeing is real, but all too soon she realizes that it is all horribly real.

What is unusual for a horror film is that the heroine meets ghosts, including the killer ghost, and does not instantly die.  Another unusual characteristic is that the killer ghost is not tied to one location, and seems to wander about buildings will little difficulty.  Also, the ghost was captured on video, though the result of that was disquieting.  The Japanese have learned that it is creepier to have supernatural being make use of modern technology.  Wouldn't it be creepy if your refrigerator started producing blood ice cubes, or a scaly hand formed from the door?  Scary!

The director did some things that I think worked well.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is a very strong actress.  However, the director deliberately made her character look weak and tired, and kept Gellar from taking control of the scenes.  The result is that Gellar's fright appears very real, and her manipulation and stalking by the ghost is scarier as a result.  The director also worked hard to tie together flashbacks and current scenes to keep you from thinking about potential problems with the plot.  As long as you remained intellectually engaged with the plot the movie remained creepy and enjoyable.

I struggle with modern horror movies.  There is typically (though not always) too much reliance on gore or the hand that ""surprisingly"" grabs you by the throat.  Unfortunately, after you have seen a few hundred horror movies you know when many of the scary moments come and surprise is harder to obtain.  For example, I found many of the deaths in ""Scream 2"" very predictable.  Other movies that try to build atmosphere just struggle to make it.  I tried watching ""The Others"" and found it tedious (which I find annoying because this movie was nicely done, but unfortunately I figured out the ending way too early).  ""The Grudge"" rarely bothers trying to surprise the audience.  Instead the goal was to create an atmosphere and to keep the suspense level high so that by the time the movie ended your sustained lever of adrenalin would theoretically leave you in a creeped out condition.  However, if you keep waiting for the ghoul to leap out from behind the door and splatter entrails all over the wall, you will most likely be disappointed.

I found ""The Grudge"" to be unique and interesting; probably not as good as ""The Ring,"" but still worth watching.  However, this movie is not a revolutionary breakthrough that will leave you breathless and in awe.  It has the potential to keep you confused and thinking and wondering what might be in your attic or what might be sliding down the stairs the next time you turn the corner.  I know I can no longer think of high rise buildings as being safe havens from vindictive ghosts.",1124841600,5,4055,4.689801699716714

29496,2,0767827759,"At exactly 17 minutes and 45 seconds into ""The Grudge,"" the ever-reliable cat jumps out of a closet and scares somebody.  I tell you this only so that you will know when you will be able to take a quick refreshment and/or restroom break and not miss anything.  It also pretty much underscores the modus operandi of this film, which is ""don't bother with something new when something old will do.""  For although ""The Grudge"" is a remake of a recent Japanese film (""Ju-On,"" made by the same director, Takashi Shimizu), there really isn't anything here that we haven't seen hundreds of times before in haunted house movies made east of the International Date Line.

The bland Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a young foreign exchange student living in Japan who volunteers as a care worker in her spare time.  When she is sent to the home of a strangely ""lethargic"" woman, Gellar begins to suspect that there is something not quite right about the residence.  From then on, she and several other people, who also share a connection with the house, are haunted by a ghoulish specter who keeps popping up in the strangest places and at the most inopportune moments to exact her revenge for being done away with in an untimely manner (although none of the people she pesters had anything to do with her demise).

Although there are a few mildly suspenseful moments scattered throughout the film, ""The Grudge"" is simply too derivative and too hackneyed to register much of an impact on our psyches, with a great deal of its imagery ripped-off from that seminal horror film ""Carnival of Souls.""  The story makes very little sense when you start to analyze it seriously and, after all the huffing and puffing to arrive at a stunning climax, the ending deflates like a slowly leaking balloon.  I haven't seen the original version, so I have no idea how it compares to this one.  But I can hardly imagine it was anywhere near as undistinguished and lackluster as this one is (or else why remake it?).  Even with the same director at the controls, perhaps something simply got lost in the translation.",1124755200,,2084,4.7134986225895315
29497,4,0767827759,"If I learned anything from watching The Grudge (2004) last night its that malevolent spirits are very messy, and don't pick up after themselves.  Perhaps that's part of their modus operandi...they come into your home, create a huge mess, and then while your attention is focused on cleaning up the place, that's when they choose to scare the heebie jeebies out of you.  Well, few things, cinematically speaking, scare the heebie jeebies out of me anymore (real life is infinitely more frightening), but I did think this film was, at the very least, entertaining, and provided some spooky visuals and an interesting and fairly simple story.  Co-written and directed by Takashi Shimizu, The Grudge is actually a remake of a Japanese film he did previously titled Ju-on: The Grudge (2003), which I have not seen, so I can't comment or compare without sounding foolish.  Appearing in the film is Sarah Michelle Gellar (I Know What You Did Last Summer)...does anyone else find it slightly pretentious to consistently use all three names?  But I digress...also appearing is Jason Behr (""Dawson's Creek""), William Mapother (Lords of Dogtown), Clea DuVall (Identity), KaDee Strickland (Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid), Grace Zabriskie (Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me), Ted Raimi (Man with the Screaming Brain), Ryo Ishibashi (Dog Star), and Bill Pullman, the guy who played the President of the United States in Roland Emmerich's bloated and flawed science fiction orgasmofest masterpiece Independence Day (1996)...I rip on Emmerich because I think he's one of the worst kinds of filmmakers (load the movie with costly special effects to hide the fact its lacking in everything else, including an actual story) but in a purely visual sense his films can be fun...

The film begins with some text telling us that when a really angry person bites during a fit of unprecedented rage, the negative energies stick around, creating some wickedly awesome bad mojo that waits to glom onto unsuspecting individuals who happen to visit the area, thus consuming their juicy and effervescent life force.  Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Karen Davis, an exchange student living in Japan with her boyfriend Doug (Behr) who's quite the hunk with his perfectly tousled hair...you know the style, it's the one that someone spends two hours and a whole lot of money at the hairdressers for to get that `just woke up' look (I get it every morning for free)...anyway, Karen, who's a nurse of sorts, receives an assignment to provide daytime care for a really creepy infirmed elderly woman (Zabriskie) after the mysterious disappearance of the previous caregiver named Yoko...alas, poor Yoko, I knew her not, Horatio, but she was a pretty, young, hello kitty maiden...anyway, Karen arrives at the house, sensing something odd, but goes about performing her chores.  Turns out the crazy lady lives with her son (Mapother) and his wife (DuVall), neither of whom return home, prompting Karen to call her boss (Raimi) as she doesn't want to leave the goony old bat alone...but guess what?  They're not alone...at least not in that house, as it has a violent history, and something was left behind, something in the form of a small, nekkid Japanese boy with a whole lot of eyeliner...and a big mouth...(the evil takes on many forms, but this was the oddest)

First of all, does anyone else think William Mapother is kinda creepy?  I'm not talking about his character, but the man himself...his face is all scrunched up and too small for his head, reminding me of one of those angry midgets from the Phantasm movies...well, I suppose I'm no Adonis myself, and he's probably a very kind fellow...as I said before, I enjoyed this film.  It sort of reminded me of a Japanese version of The Amityville Horror, but, instead of Satan moving in and causing all sorts of mischief, we have a nondescript evil entity, the result of a past incident of great anger and violence (the Japanese detective referred to it an `emotional stain'), indiscriminately preying on unsuspecting visitors who happen to enter the abode.  I might be tempted to label this a haunted house story, but that's not entirely true as the malevolent force wasn't confined to the house, but rather latched on to individuals who spent time within the four walls, and subsequently followed them wherever they went until...well, let's just say following them around was by far the least harmful thing it would do...the story was actually pretty simple, but told in a way to make it appear more complicated.  What I mean is instead of proceeding on a linear path, the film is edited in such a way that we see past sequences mixed in with scenes of the present, as they story crosses timeline boundaries, weaving three, connected tales into one.  This kind of thing can get messed up very easily, but here they kept it clean, orderly, and understandable.  The main one involves Sarah Michelle Gellar's character, the second involves the family currently residing in the house, and the third features the family that lived in the house three years past, and the ones responsible for all the stuff going on presently.  Oddly, there seemed to be less focus on the characters and more on the story itself, which may be a result of cultural differences, I'm not sure, but it felt intentional, so I went with it...there are some good scares throughout the film, many the result of something seemingly innocuous in the background coming forth to surprise an unsuspecting audience, along with a few, drawn out sequences designed to create a sense of suspense.  The overall effect for me was a permeating sense of unease, as the evil was clinging to the characters, biding its time.  Overall I thought the cinematography was really beautiful, and I especially liked those long and foreboding shots, as they developed a real sense of tension.  If you're looking for some visceral thrills, you'll probably be disappointed as the blood n' guts factor is minimal, but in terms of a spooky ghost story, the film does very well.  I have only seen the PG-13 version, but there is an R rated directors cut available on DVD, one that features about six or seven minutes of extra footage.

The picture on this DVD, presented in widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic high definition, looks very sharp and clean and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio comes through very well.  The PG-13 version that I have has a commentary track with producer Sam Raimi, screenwriter Stephen Susco, actors Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ted Raimi, KaDee Strickland, and Jason Behr, along with a couple of others.  It also features a five part, `making of' documentary titled `A Powerful Rage', a featurette titled `Under the Skin' - A medical explanation of fear response in film, along with trailers, one for this film, along with The Forgotten (2004), Guess Who (2005), Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid (2004), Boogeyman (2005), Riding Giants (2004), Spider-Man 2 (2004), Man of the House (2005), and Mirrormask (2005).  The Director's Cut DVD contains a few more extras, so if you are planning on buying this film, keep an eye on which version you're getting, depending on what you're looking for...

While this is not your typical horror film (high body count, blood etc) this certianly is a scary film (loved the scene with the woman coming down the stairs in the Japanese version I felt that scene slightly overplayed itself)

""The Grudge"" not only plays on these aspects, it does it with such slow tenacity that I could not help but to be drawn into such a story. It seems to me that the people who did not LIKE the movie, did not GET the movie. And that's fine. I, however, really enjoyed the film.

Let me put it this way. True evil never dies. It is always there, waiting to destroy anything it touches. Evil is destructive. That is what makes the Emperor in ""Star Wars"" so great. Or Sauron in the ""Lord of the Rings."" Beings that strive to dominate, crush, and destroy. What these antagonists do is give us the means for a story.  Without them, there is peace and harmony - not stuff that make such an exciting story.

So, what makes a horror movie great?  I think that it depends on what the viewer brings to the film.  I have expectations, as I think I always do when reading a book, watching a movie, listening to music, or whatever.  I expect to be treated like an intelligent viewer, reader, or whatnot, that wishes to be entertained with quality craftmanship.

""The Grudge"" does just that. You are expected to think. It lays out the story well, giving you time to warm up to the horror that will always be there, never die, and always win. What could be more frightening? You are not safe in your home under the covers. This thing will find you. And it will kill you whether you've been naughty or nice. It doesn't revel in needless gore, nor does it simply feel like a bad heavy metal music video. The movie is smart and frightening. That is why I enjoy the movie so much.

My Cousin said ""Wow, it's the scariest movie i ever saw"" with a statement like that i couldn't resist but watch this movie, and when i did i came to realize that my cousin is an idiot.

The Plot-Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a Tokyo College student who caretakes for an elderly woman in a haunted house.

Where a little dead tokyo boy screeches noises and loves to take bubble baths in the tub and a angry mother drags herself around the house on her chest looking for her sons rubber duckie.

The Negatives-

This movie is not scary, who was scared from this movie???? whoever got scared from this movie deserves to be slapped like a pinata.

I can see people saying""OOOOOH that little naked boy scares me when he goes ""AHHHHHH"" OR ""that big black spider cloud thing coming down from the ceiling wow that was scary""

Yes World, this movie is a waste of time, It's another Terrorist attack from JAPAN and it's on our cinemas!!!!!

Yes it's true look it up.

-Sarah Michelle Gellar Can't Act!!!!

If she's not slaying vampires i don't want to see her in anything. She's stiff, shows no emotion and is horrible as a lead in a horror movie. Plus she has no horror movie experience Oh yeah she was in ""I know what you did last summer"" but she got killed off anyway. Thats Right, if you can't act, you must be killed off.

The Positives-Hahahahahahaha, it's sad when the best scene in a ""horror"" movie is sarah's makeout scene in the beginning, maybe if she had flashed a boob in this movie this could have gotten an extra star.

Conclusion-This movie is a laughing stock,The japanese directors figure""See, Americans like ringu, they will like grudge, Ha ha stupid americans, we make money off them, ha ha""

Not off me you evil japanese people!!!!! not me!!!!!!!!

29507,5,0767827759,"I found this movie to be extremely scary.  The premise of murder causing a soul to remain in the place it's body was killed is not new.  The twist that the Japanese put on it is difficult to comprehend for American audiences.  I have read quite a bit of Japanese mythology and their ghosts are not our ghosts.  Their ghosts are more like demons.  If you don't know anything about Japanese culture or mythology this movie is not going to make a lot of sense.  Using an American heroine was simply a hook.  She isn't what the story is about, it's about the people who were murdered, why they were murdered and the aftermath for their ghosts.  The vision of the female ghost crawling down the stairs stayed with me for a long time.  The fact that is wasn't CGI made it even worse.  The one thing that I noticed among other reviews was that no one realized what a sacrifice was made by the Japanese detective.  He knew what was in the house and what it was capable of but went in anyway to do his job and purify the place.  I enjoy non-linear, subtle plots and the movie scared the living daylights out of me.

During the movie all the way until the end you never understand why the ghost of Kayoko makes this groaning noise.  This movie has the whole flashback in the end so you understand why Toshio is the only one whose wet and why Kayoko is blue from suffication, but her hair is never wet.  This is a frightening horror movie.  Just last night I watched it with my older brother (16).  He takes horror movies like this as a joke.  Since I had seen the original movie I wanted to see the deleted scenes first.  My brother watched them with me just to scare the crap outta me.  But he got really into the movie.  After we saw all the deleted scenes he was yelling at me to start the movie!  It is slightly confusing with all the flashbacks, but most asian horror movies have informational flashbacks.  Also you must know if you have never entered the house you can't see or be harmed by the ghosts.  Be sure to watch this before you watch the original.

""The Grudge"" and other horror movies that follow it are not filled with gore and blood, yet are eerie and mentally weird and supernatural.  The plot of ""The Grudge"" is basic, a dead woman haunts the house and people who are involved.

The thing that bothers me is why they pick Sarah Michelle Gellar to play the main character, when the main character lives in Japan no matter if she has some type of job that makes her to relocate there in the first place.  Well anyways ""The Grudge"" is a good, not great, horror movie.  And if you enjoy these type of J-Horror movies, rent or buy the real J-Horror movies, such as ""Ringu"", ""Ringu 0"", ""Ringu 2"", ""Ju-on"", ""Ju-on 2"", ""Ju-Rei"", ""Premonition"", ""The Mother"" and ""The Eye"".",1121126400,,843,4.556291390728477
29514,5,0767827759,"I have to say this is one of the scariest movie I've ever seen...including The Ring. But how can you compare the two movies with the different storyline. I saw this at the threater with a friend, who never watches horror movie because it gives her nightmare. I am a horror movie fantatic, I watch any horror movies, good or not, so I bought the tickets to see it with her to prove to her that there is nothing to fear.

In the beginning of the movie, where the Japanese girl was peeking in the attic, the mother suddenly pops up and grabs her, scared everyone...(the couple in front of us jumped, girls was screaming and it was only 10 mins into the film). To me the scariest scene has to be at the staircase. By then almost everyone had have their eyes halp covered by hands. My friend said to me at that moment, ""I shouldn't have come with you to see this."" While saying this with her face away from the screen. I think the scene that got everyone horrored was the bed, (I saw a few teenaged girls left the threater, it was almost 2/3 into the film.) ... After the movie, I was waiting for my friend outside the restroom, I overheard an other viewer saying, ""It wasn't what I have expected."" Sure, because this movie is unlike any western made horror movie.

But I think there is one point to make clear, that is the deaths occured because the mother and child had been invitied. For example, recall the phone rang before the sister's death? In the staircase and her apartment. Except deaths happened in the house, because it WAS their house.

This movie gave my friend nightmares for about a month, and I was hesitated to use any enclosed staircase alone for about 2 months. hehe... Give this movie a try and you might enjoy the [horror] from it...  I never like to compare movies, but to give this movie a 1 star is ridiculous, in this case, there should be a negative rating for The Sign, because The Sign really was stupid.",1120953600,,1929,4.364902506963788

First of all, the title itself is pretty self explanatory, as the narrator basically explains it at the beginning of the film. So someone dies in rage, and they get all anal about people being in their house, I get it.

So I'm sitting through the film waiting for a really interresting, unique storyline explaining why these ""things"" are so pissed at the people who walk through their front door. Waiting, waiting, waiting... movie ends... Waiting, waiting, waiting... credits end, back to DVD menu.

Um... ok... So they're just mad for no reason???

I thought maybe there'd be more of an explanation in the DVD extras. There were, in the making of the movie, but I found myself thinking, ""Thank God I didn't go to this in the theater!"".

It lacks in the story department mostly. Sure, there ended up to be a reason as to why these creatures are haunting this seemingly oridinary house (they were killed without knowing why they were killed), but I got to thinking, ""Why aren't other ghosts in other movies and stories like this?""

(...)
It just was a sheer dissapointment. I am a major fan of horror, but mostly in horror games since I have yet to see a really good horror movie that makes me wet my pants and turn on all the lights in the house (except maybe Silence of the Lambs). So I was a little scared of my bed once I finished this movie, but that's about it, and I got over that quite quickly when I got really tired.

I suppose this movie might be worth seeing if you've seen very minimal horror movies and/or games. Then you might be scared (like I notice kid's get really scared by this movie). But if you're desensitized like me, it's not worth your time or your money.",1120953600,2,1806,4.38622754491018

There are no scenes of blood and guts in the original but Hollywood felt compelled to add them for the remake. WHY?? Blood and Guts do NOT make a horror movie!

If you want a scary movie, Get the original Ju-On. They are ofcourse very similar but Ju-On will have you pulling the blanket over your eyes and pulling the covers far back before you go to sleep.

The only problem was it wasn't scary.

There was this gutteral sound that the ghost woman made, which was a little eerie, but not enough to give someone nightmares...or the creeps at all.

There are some decent jump scares throughout, but other than that it's pretty much your standard haunted house story. Except this one's set in Japan, a choice which I cannot understand at all. It made all those gaijins stick out like sore thumbs and I kept wondering what Ted Raimi was doing in Japan.

The writing was sophomoric, the acting was uninspired and the direction felt like a Japanese director doing an American version of his original Japanese story.

Not only is the story line played out, but it is also terrible. Not enough plot points, extremely hard to follow, and no this has nothing to do with people being or not being ""sharp"". Casting an actor like Sarah Michelle takes away from the overall realism of the movie. Good actor? Yes, but any true horror fan knows that more or less unkown actors only add to the experience by adding realism to the film. Casting a-list actors in horror films comes only as a distraction in my opinion. I tend to stray from horror films set in different countries as they tend to include languages that both the audience and often times the actors cant understand. Overall this is just a sad horror movie. Terrible story line, Mediocre acting, and lots of people speaking some sort of foreign language. I'm not even sure if this film deserves so much as two stars, as it is in many ways a pathetic film.

The Ring (the prequel of the trilogy remake) didn't really do much to portray the original storyline, which was actually much scarier.

Back to The Grudge, the movie was true to its core, in fact better! It's a tale of a house, where a 1/2 comatose elderly live in, and where Sarah MG's character was currently living in Japan, who bilingual in Japan and live with her bf, played by Jason Behr (Roswell), both still residing as students. Sarah MG's character also take up a volunteering job as a caretaker, which very much where the story unveiled.

She was assigned to take care of this elderly woman to temporary substitute for the sudden disapperance of Yoko, the original caretaker for the elderly. Sarah found her assignment trying desperately to move in her messy fouled room below and Sarah MG quickly started working to clean her mess off.

29530,4,0767827759,"It takes a lot to scare me in a movie, but Ju-On 3 did. Very terrifying movie. After seeing that, obviously, I wanted to see this American Remake of it, which is from the same director but with an American cast. While this just isn't as scary, it is still a great movie with some chilling scenes and big jump scares.

The plot of a movie is essentially that ""when someone dies in a fit of rage, their curse is left in an area. All who enter are consumed by it's fury."" Therefore, there's a house where very bad things had happened in the past, and everyone who enters the house will be killed by these very scary spirits. They follow you around anywhere, and show up at any time, eventually killing you.

Ju-On 3 was really more episodic than anything. It went from one character to another, essentially showing their deaths due to entering a house where deadly spirits live. The Grudge, though, takes one of the characters from Ju-On 3 and makes her the main character. So we have a little more plot here. As a result, though, the movie's not as scary. The Japanese version went from scare to scare, but this remake has to stop the scares sometimes to bring some plot into the picture. As a result, I was a little disappointed when I first saw this remake. My favorite scares from the Japanese version were either cut, or simply made less scary, (such as the security tapes scene.) But after seeing the movie again, I realized that, while the Japanese version is a lot better, this version still has it's strengths, and still has many scares, while bringing a plot into the picture.

If you want to see a movie for scares and nothing else, (and don't mind the subtitles,) see Ju-On 3. (Known in the US simply as Ju-On) instead of the remake. But if you want a stronger plot, a little less confusion (the Japanese version, admittedly, can be hard to follow,)an American cast, and are willing to settle for a less scary version, then see The Grudge. There are still some great scares here, and there are even a couple new ones that are fairly well done. Plus, the finale is a little more intense here. So, both this remake and Ju-on have their strengths and weaknesses. It's ultimately up to you which one to see. If you have no interest in a Japanese movie, then see The Grudge. It is definitely a scary remake.

Note; there are 2 versions of this movie you can buy; the Theatrical Version, and the Director's Cut. I HIGHLY recommend the director's cut. It has 8 minutes of extra footage, (much of it cut to get the movie a PG13 rating,) and it's definitely even scarrier. So if you want a great, scary, and sometimes complex movie, then see The Grudge, (But make sure it's the Director's Cut version...) or, even better yet, see the Japanese original.",1117843200,,2752,4.4760956175298805
29531,2,0767827759,"First of all, to clarify any bad blood later, I am NOT a fan of scary movies. I find them, well...Um, scary. But of course, like most people, I am stupid and somehow allowed my friends to persuade me to watch it. The plot begins like most over used scary movie plots. Haunted house, has bad juju. No one wants to live in it because of some horrible grisly murder or double murder or triple murder, yada yada yada. But, instead of the usual stupid young family wanting to move in (""oh, honey wouldn't this be a great house for the kids?""), it's a...caretaker. I thought that was a cool twist, I admit. She's assigned to watch over the scary as all out house and it's mute, haunted occupant, an old lady.

But then that's when it starts getting confusing AND very very very scary. Mother of god scary.

First, the confusing stuff: I didn't understand the flashbacks. They confused me, and didn't help me understand why the croaky lady and the meowing boy were killing people. It didn't make sense to my tiny, innocent little brain. But, hey, that's me. But the flashbacks were really confusing. It didn't help me understand why the strange things were going on. Not at all.

Now, to the scary stuff. Oh my god! Scary scary scary scary! Scary to the point I think I coulda peed my pants. (Then again, I'm NOT a scary movie fan.) The croaking lady, for starters. We are introduced to her in shadow in the beginning of the movie, as she snatches up a past caretaker and does something to the woman that leaves her dead. Then, the meowing boy. We are introduced to him a little while later, making the horrendous (and creepy) yowl that I thought only my cat could make if I didn't let her outside. And then the telephone call. Eeeek! Creepy as hell.

Okay....I'm gonna stop now because I could go on forever about the scary stuff. It sums down to this: The American remake, while very disturbing and scary, tries too hard and falls very short without giving an explanation as to WHY the things happen to the occupants of the house like they do. So it's this: If you like a truly terrifying movie without much plot, stop here. If you want a scary movie with an intricate, good plot, move on.",1117756800,,2184,4.438902743142145

29533,5,0767827759,"This movie is a remake in a way that no other has been done.  A popular Japanese ghost story was reshot by the same director with a few characters replaced by Americans.  The result is creepy, scary and brilliant.

The Japanese culture is much different from the American in respect to ghosts and spirits and yet this film can appeal to both.  The premise is that when death is caused by a great rage, a curse will be born that continue and thrive.

An American exchange student (Gellar) needs a health credit so she works for a clinic that provides in-house care for the needy.  One day she gets a chance to work in the field when another worker fails to show up for work.  This takes her to the haunted house that is at the heart of the movie.

The creepiness and scariness hit early in the film and keep on hitting even though the explanations are doled out slowly but not too slowly.  Gellar is not the only one who gets suck into the story and the curse as the vengeful spirits affect many.

If you are looking for a wonderfully spooky and scary movie then this is one to watch.  After seeing it you may even want to check out the Japanese original.",1117497600,,1154,4.296296296296297
29534,5,0767827759,"I loved this movie. Im a fan of movies like ringu(not the crap american dumbed down version). I also liked the eye. The thing with these movies is how much the sound effects and music play a huge part in the scares. The music and video combine to make the hair on your neck stand up at many points. American filmakers in general just don't seem to get this. Take the ring versus Ringu. The phone call in our american remake has some crappy line like ""two weeks"" but in the original version they pick up the phone and there is just creepy music on the other end.
But down to the unrated directors cut grudge. The extra seconds tacked on to the end of scary moments are great. Instead of cutting away from Yoko's face just as you see her tongue in the theatrical version, you linger and see the roof of her mouth. Also the boy and his dad scene(involving hanging) is great and the extended flashback in the finale is awesome. All in all the only thing I didn't like about this movie was the guy from Roswell, he's just plain annoying. The commentary is good and the deleted scenes really add something to the movie and it's a shame they could not add some of them back into the film.",1117411200,,1181,4.276785714285714
29535,4,0767827759,"I find it ironic that this movie has left me with a grudge of my own.  Frankly, I'm disappointed that a director's cut was released so long after the original (and with seemingly little warning).  As someone who enjoyed the movie, I bought the theatrical version when it was first released on DVD.  Then I come to find that my money might be completely wasted, as there will be a ""Director's Cut"" of the film.  That is my grudge.  If I were in this movie, I would die and become a vengeful ghost who kills anyone who enters my TV room, the scene of the crime.

I cautiously rented the director's cut, wanting to know if it would actually contain enough new material to justify spending another $20+ for what is essentially the same movie.  As a movie collector, I knew that I wanted The Grudge in my collection, so I had to know which was the best version to own.  Otherwise, I would advocate not buying any copy of this movie, just to send a message to the film companies that we would rather not buy the same movie over and over.

A good synopsis of the added scenes can be found on The Grudge listing on imdb.com (click on ""alternate versions"").  Some short scenes and added shots are meant to clarify things that are implied in the movie, nothing special there.  Some scenes come across as aimless filler.  The only real benefit of the director's cut, I feel, is that some of the most gruesome scenes are extended a few seconds here and there; they were obviously cut short for a PG-13 rating in the theatrical version, and here they are restored to their full length.  We get a slightly better look at Yoko's jaw on the floor of the attic (now you can actually see it`s a jaw), not to mention an extra second or two added to the shot of her giving Ted Raimi that special smile.  We saw that the killer husband/father was hanged (as we saw in the theatrical version), but not by a rope, and certainly not by choice.  We also get an extended, and graphic, flashback into the actual events that led to the curse.  Basically, the ""Unrated Director's Cut,"" is what we would have seen if the movie was rated ""R"" in the first place.  Overall, it seems, judging by the total running time of both versions, that the director's cut incorporates a whopping seven minutes of extra footage (intended sarcasm).

I was about to say that the extra features were more disappointing than that of the original DVD release, but looking back at the original release, those features were pretty disappointing too.  Now, instead of behind the scenes featurettes, we have deleted scenes (which, like most deleted scenes, were deleted because they weren't interesting or doing anything for the movie), intensely uninteresting video diaries from Sarah Michelle Gellar and KaDee Strickland (no offense to them), and various unthrilling production sketches and other filler.  The only extras of note in the Director's Cut disc are the two short (very short) films from the director, related to the movie.  Each film seems to be a story of what happened to someone who was, at some point not mentioned in the short film, in the cursed house.  These films are shot on a camcorder, both in broad daylight, and are not really very interesting.  Those who are students of shot composition or the ""atmosphere"" of a scene may find some merit in the director's early work here, but most likely the average viewer may mistake these two videos as winners of the cheesy Grudge Fan Home Video Contest.

From a value perspective, is this disc worth buying if you already have the regular edition?  I would say no.  If you're a fan, you'll like the unrestrained extra seconds throughout the film, and if you absolutely HAVE to have the definitive version, this is the one to get, but there isn't nearly enough extra footage (and no extra plot points or major changes at all) to justify a second purchase.",1117324800,2,3867,4.600583090379009

The Grudge is not scary. It has a lot of cool visuals and creepy situations that make it fun to watch. There are a lot of entertaining scenes. However, a lot of the things that happen are so cheesy and un-realistic that the horror-factor of this film is a negative.

29539,5,0767827759,"I am, of course, a huge Sarah Michelle Gellar fan.  I thought the initial, theatrical version of ""The Grudge"" was a very well done and original movie.  It was scarier than ""The Ring,"" it had better acting, better directing, and a more intriguing plot.  My problem with the film was due to the fact that the filmmakers never really showed WHAT exactly happened in that house.  The audience easily inferred what took place, but the audience was never explicitly told, ""this is what happened, and why all this crazy, evil stuff is now happening.""  This version changes that.

I prefer this unrated, extended, director's cut, or whatever they are calling it because  the include what actually happened in that house, and it is truly horrifying.  The majority if the added scenes depict some pretty scary stuff that I think was important to the plot of the movie and should not have been cut.  Thanks to this version, it has been added back in to the film.  Now, we the audience, can truly understand how terrifying this movie is.

So at the end of the movie I was left scratching my head thinking, ""What did I just watch?""  I understand how the killings started, so maybe a better question was, ""What was the point of this?""  The ending is not an ending at all, but more an opening for a possible sequel.

The strongest aspect of this movie was that the bulk of the gore was left to the imagination of the viewer.  You don't see people getting killed, you see it coming and then the rest is up to you.  I think this actually makes it more scary than seeing what actually does happen.

The best part is that it lowers the rating from an 'R' rating to a 'PG-13' so more people can see it.  With an 'R' rating, this movie would not have made as much as it actually did.

I've seen horror movies that range back to the oringial Frankinstien and Dracula up to this recent film ""The Grudge."" Out of the 100+ horror movies I have seen three have struck me as ""scary"" and this was not one of them.

1)The Shining
Why: Ingenious directing by Stanley Kubrick, and amazing acting from jack nicholson

2)My little eye
Why: The very clever use of webcams and sharp writing

3)Candyman
Why: One of the few ""mad slasher"" horror movies I've seen with and exeptionally smart plot (with the exception of ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" and ""Psycho"")

The reason ""The Grudge"" is not scary is because it lacked all of the things that made the movies above scary. As I said with the Shining ""ingenious directing and acting"" and we all know Shara Michelle Geller is not the greatest of actors/actress and the way this was directed made it look low budget and like a student film. As for the writing, it's not sharp at all. Although you can understand the movie, it all made sense to me, but in the end, if you think about it, it's....well, pointless. And as far as psychological horror...it tries to be psychological by lacking gore, sex, and drugs, and while that is all well and good, taking a pointless killer movie and taking these out these things does not make it psychologically scary. Candyman was very gory, and it had drugs, and a little sex, but it was still scary. And the writer apparently thought he had a great idea by having a ghost with a grudge on someone, and by the time he's almost done with the script he remebers that he never gave this ghost a reason to kill people. So, he writes a random idea (say, a woman falling in love with another man, while she is married, for no apparent reason) and he hopes the viewer would not understand and just find the jump scenes scary. I guess he succededed with many people but not with me.

Basically here is what you are paying for when you see The Grudge, cheap acting (not the worst but nothing that special, except for the dumbass kid and Sarah Michelle Gellar who cannot act to save her life), horrible incoherrent plot line that involves a story that is never fully explained or makes sense in the end, and another failed attempt of making a decent horror movie by hollywood.

it does start off in an interesting way, but quickly slows down and falls into a deep pit of retardation and psychologically traumetizing idiocy for the audiance. not only that but everything was predictable such as the boy appearing on the different levels as sarah's character passes on the elevator, sarah not leaving the house in the last seen (the golden rule of horror films, make something so insignificant and god damn stupid keep the main character in the path of danger just to drag another 5 minutes of 'terror' into the movie), and finding out the ghost (phantom, whatever the hell i still don't care) boy's father killed him and his mother at the end.....heres a big question for all you people, why the hell did that happen? just cause the mother was interested in another man? then where the hell is the mother and why do they kill people for no random reason?

29550,3,0767827759,"Japan has a long, ghostly tradition with beings from beyond the grave. Nemerous stories and legends  in Japan of these otherworldly visitors abound. Ghosts often play key roles in Kabuki theater and were a favorite though perhaps somewhat overly-used character by Kabuki playwrights. Many of the ghosts that appear in plays and stories are females seeking revenge for wrongs done to them during their lifetime typically by cruel, heartless husbands.

In the old ghost stories, vengeful Japanese ghosts would continue haunt their victims until they went insane, died, or at least made some form of restitution to appease the angry spirits. Some Japanese ghosts were born out of tragedy or sorrow and would haunt any person who came near. These spirits were particularly feared because they represented a danger to all unless they were somehow put to rest.

Although I knew about the horrific nature of old Japanese ghosts, I had thought modern Japanese ghosts would be more polite and demur. I had imagined a modern Japanese ghost timidly coming up to someone and saying ""Suimasen (Excuse me)! BOO! Gomen naisai (I'm sorry)!"" before whisking away. ""The Grudge"" (2004) showed me how wrong I was about modern Japanese phantoms.

""The Grudge,"" starring Sarah Michelle Gellar of TV's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" fame, depicts a haunting by very impolite spirits. Gellar plays an American student nurse in Tokyo who accidentally gets involved with a haunted house that has the nasty habit of killing visitors. The ghosts of the house were victims of a tragedy and now they rudely kill anyone who comes in contact with them.

The spirits' motivation for killing is explained at the beginning of the film in a brief written prologue which states: ""when someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is left behind.""

For Western audiences it may seem unusual that the two main ghostly antagonists who having been innocent victims of a violent death themselves would seek to cause the death of another innocent person. This flies in the face of a Western audience's sense of justice and fairness.

In many Western ghost stories, ghosts despite their spookiness are often motivated by the same things as living people namely the pursuit of justice for wrongdoings. The ghost of a murdered person will seek vengeance on the person or persons responsible for their death.

If a ghost is malevolent, it often turns out they were a bad person in life - as in the back-story to the main ghost character in the ""Poltergeist"" (1982-1986) movies.

To understand the nature of the supernatural entity of ""The Grudge,"" one has to understand Japanese belief in spirits and the supernatural.

In the book ""Ghosts and the Japanese: Cultural Experience in Japanese Death Legends"" by Michiko Iwasaka, there is a passage which is a direct echo of the opening lines of the movie:

""Anyone who dies under great emotional stress creates an energy which is not easily dissipated; these yurei [ghosts], thus, have an impact on the local environment...""

This type of spirit is called a ""goryo"" - vengeful ghost. A goryo, however, is less like a consciously aware ghost that plots revenge like those featured in Kabuki plays and which would be more familiar to Western audiences. A goryo is more like the energy of the emotion created at the time of death. And to some degree it represents the unconscious mind free of the limitations and morals of the conscious analytic side.

Formal belief of goryo can be traced to the Heien Period (794-1185) when goryo were believed to be the angry spirits of political enemies that had died in exile or had been executed. The noted scholar Sugawara-no-Michizane became one such goryo. Through guileful manipulations, his enemies at the Imperial Court engineered his banishment from Kyoto. Sugawara died in extreme sorrow while in exile. Shortly after his death, a number of natural disasters occurred from droughts and epidemics to lightening strikes. It was believed to be caused by the angry spirit of Sugawara. To appease his goryo, Sugawara was given ceremonial promotion at the Imperial Court and eventually he was made into a god-spirit whom modern-day students pray to for success on their exams.

Goryo were vengeful spirits from the aristocracy who like Sugiwara have the power to affect the very seasons. Another more commonly experienced type was onryo. While less powerful than the goryo, the onryo were the ghosts that kept Japanese of then and now frightened out of their wits. Onryo are typically depicted with wild unkempt hair in a white burial kimono.

Although onryo could be either male or female, the most popular onryo were women. Often powerless while in life, these female onryo wielded great power in death. They would wreak vengeance on husbands and lovers who spurned or hurt them in life usually by driving them mad with fear.

Director Takashi Shimizu has built on this old concept to create a deadly onryo of a very frightening ghostly Mother and Son duo. ""The Grudge"" is an American remake of the original Japanese thriller ""Ju-on"" (2003). ""Ju-on"" is Shimizu's horror franchise. ""Ju-on"" grew out of a short TV story to become a successful and scary theater-release movie which was followed by a sequel. Famed Spiderman director, Sam Ramie, who helped produce the American remake thought ""Ju-on"" to be one of the scariest movies he had ever seen.

""The Grudge"" opened in America during the Halloween season last fall but it has only recently opened in Japan. One notable difference is the inclusion of a few extra violent moments that were left out in the American version in order for the movie to keep a PG-13 rating in the States.

Overall there's not much of story. Some people die, then some other people die. Most of the film is just one scare after another with little character development or plot. ""The Grudge"" is more like a series of creepy vignettes strung together to make a film. However, these vignettes are quite scary. Its the cultural nuance of the goryo/onryo-type spirit that ""The Grudge"" represents and the genuinely frightening moments that makes the film an interesting experience for Japan-o-philes and horror fans alike.

On the Scare-O-Meter, ""The Grudge"" rates about 4 out 5 Screams.

On Plot, it rates about 2 stars out of 5; however the concept behind the movie rates about a 4.",1115164800,17,6351,4.962335216572504

I'm not talking about Sarah (BUFFY) Michelle Gellar, not this time, but instead I speak today of Grace Zabriskie, the actress who plays the elderly woman who sleeps on the floor and seems so haunted by the violent deaths of everyone she knows.

Grace Zabriskie has one of those faces you've seen over and over again, often playing disturbed or Satanic mothers along the lines of Angela Lansbury's character in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.  Her other forte is playing supportive, rather helpless and pathetic mothers who are nevertheless sweet and loving.  I first became aware of Ms. Zabriskie's sweeping talent while watching the US soap opera of the 1980s, SANTA BARBARA.  She took a nothing part and filled it with every kind of theatrical, filmic gesture, elevating an ordinary show into the kind of thing you would tape every day just on the off chance that she would make an appearance on it.  (That's actually not fair to SB which in many ways was one of the most innovative shows on TV.)  Then my friends who knew I liked Grace Zabriskie would call me and tell me they had spotted her in other shows and films.  She played one of the hardened factory hands in NORMA RAE and she excelled in DRUGSTORE COWBOY.  She was the mother of Laura Palmer in the series of TWIN PEAKS, and she was Debra Winge's mother in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN.  Need I say more?  For twenty-five years she has been giving us her all, and in THE GRUDGE she gives no quarter to the general shoddiness of the production.  She attacks the part as though she were playing Gertrude in HAMLET (which she is in a way).  Watch her as she turns white, and her struggles for breath, and her anguished pleas to Sarah Michelle Gellar, the co-star with whom she seems to have the most empathy.  If they had an entry for GREATNESS in the dictionary, there would be a little picture of Grace Zabriskie to illustrate the noun.

When she is assigned to take the job of Yoko (played by YOKO MAKI), because she didn't show up, Karen is sent to look after Emma Williams (GRACE ZABRISKIE), the elderly, senile mother to transplanted Americans Matthew (played by WILLIAM MAPOTHER) and Susan (played by KaDEE STRICKLAND).

There was also one scene in the end where `the grudge' is `crawling' down the stairs. It has a series of twitches and movements attempted to scare you, but I recall thinking MAN THIS IS DUMB.

But, it had an extremely low budget of $10 million, which is not much at all for a marketable horror film. But, ""The Grudge"" has frightened American audiences from all walks of life. This film follows the tradition of ""The Ring"", ""28 Days Later"" and other classic horror films.

The plot is formulaic, but the way used to describe it, which, I'm sure will be repeated over and over again is completely and utterly original. All horror movies have something they want from their audiences. But, this simply wants to make your flesh crawl. The Grudge is a film directed by Takashi Shimizu, who directed the Ju-On Trilogy. Ju-On was Japanese original films that triggered The Grudge.

The movie is about an accident that happened in a house in Tokyo, Japan that was a murderous act of rage. And it is said in Japan that after something this horrible happens, a curse is left behind. And this curse haunts Karen Davis, an American exchange student working at a care center for a disturbed woman living in that house. One other thing I like about this haunting scare-fest is the fact that it doesn't reel the audience in. It asks them to go along for the ride, per se. The events do not happen in order. So, that might confuse some, but I think it is unique and clever.

The DVD, though, has alot to be desired. It has a fascinating five-part documentary which time totals around 50 minutes, but there is no deleted film content, and the movie was way too short (an extremely modest 91 minutes) and if it had outtakes and deleted scenes, I'd be happy.

The special effects were totally subpar and this film was NOT scary!!!!!!!!  It was actually funny.  I burst out laughing when the creepy crawly ghost thingies made ""scary"" noises. I can picture the filmakers getting all excited and caught up ""Yeah! this will get 'em, that's sure to freak 'em out!""  NOT.

I will try not to repeat what others have said, but essentially I expected better. If you like The Ring you will love The Grudge? What a lie. I did like The Ring, but I don't care much at all for The Grudge. If I was to give The Ring 4 or 5 stars, I could honestly give The Grudge not much more than 1 star.
A complete viewing of The Grudge later, did convey to me the basic concept and the essentials of the plot which were intriguing enough. I was left thinking what a great concept was in this movie, yet it was portrayed so lifelessly. The scares... Weren't.
Gellar's acting has been better. Pullman's wasn't so bad, but seemed merely workman-like. I think it did so well in the first week or so of initial release to theatres simply because the commercials and trailers were better than the movie they promoted.

29566,4,0767827759,"No, this isn't the best scary movie I have ever seen but it definitely gave me the creeps.  Now, I am the type that can watch a scary movie, by myself, in the dark and go to sleep right after with no nightmares or repercussions.  However, I had to watch a funny movie after this to get my mind off of the movie.  The thing that really freaked me out the most was this grating, freaky noise that the ""ghost"" makes around it's victims.  Just the expectation of what to come in the movie seems to be the most creepy thing in the entire movie.

I agree with others when they say this is like The Ring as you can really tell both movies came from the same area (as they both are remakes of Japanese movies). The ""ghosts"" in both movies are eerily similar.  However, I enjoyed this movie more than The Ring.  There just seemed to be more scary parts than in the Ring.  This movie does keep you jumping and holding the blanket over your chin.

The movie is based on the thought that when a person dies a violent death, their spirit hangs around, spawning a sort of curse.  It has a good plot and stays with it throughout the entire movie instead of jumping around.

Rent it to test it out or buy it as a good addition to your horror movie collection.  I was happy to finally be freaked out after watching a scary movie.  Just make sure to watch it with the lights off.  It's just not the same with them on!",1112918400,,1399,4.152416356877324
29567,5,0767827759,"I will be completely honest with you, I watched this film with my finger on the fast-forward button pressed heavily so that the jumpy scenes wouldn't make me change my pants.  I thought that this was one of the spookiest films that I have seen.  Director Takashi Shimizu has done an excellent job remaking this film for American audiences.  While some will argue that this is nothing more than just corporate Hollywood turning the cranks on audiences' wallets, I thought there was quite a bit of originality to this film.  The institution of us seeing the demon or spirits before the characters do was something that I wasn't familiar with in other horror films.  Normally, there is this big ""jumping out of the darkness"" scene that frightens everyone because they were not expecting it, but in The Grudge there was this element of ""here I am"" that frightened me more than most films do.

Takashi Shimizu, the mastermind behind this film, also created the original Ju-on series that became extremely popular in Japan.  This allowed his vision and purpose (with a larger budget) to continue.  I enjoyed the fact that the original director was on board and that our American crew was in Japan.  This took me away from the idea that this film was going to be nothing more than just a pro-America horror film.  It took me to this unfamiliar place (building the fear) and showcased the talents of some unfamiliar/familiar American film actors working next to a complete Japanese crew.  I thought that this kept the entire film grounded.  It wasn't set in New York, there wasn't the scene of raw nudity at the beginning ... there wasn't the normal American structure to this film because we were not in America ... we were in Japan.  This really helped me build the excitement and utter terror that I felt while watching this film.  I was impressed.

The acting, well, you don't go to a horror film expecting to see Oscar caliber acting.  Gellar and Pullman knew that the horror genre is slowing coming into the limelight as a prominent figure in cinema (it was lacking for a couple of years there) and I think that is why they chose to do this project.  Pullman wasn't anything to write home about, thought I was impressed to see him in this film.  Gellar was the exact same.  She did her part, collected her money, and went home.  This wasn't what frightened me about this film.  I didn't rent this movie to be blown away by the acting.  I expected average acting and that is what I got.  What I did go into this film expecting was to shake, shiver, and be frightened to turn off the lights after the film.  That is exactly what I found. Takashi Shimizu did an excellent job of building that right amount of suspense, using amazing lighting, perfect sound, and some very freaky visuals.  His knowledge and ability to bring us something new was extremely impressive and honest.  Here is a director who was handed the money to make the film that he wanted, and while not everything was probably to his liking, it did open the door for more fans to enjoy his work.  It also opened the door to more projects from his mind to be released.  This could be the new face of cinematic horror, and I cannot wait to see what he has in store for us.

Overall, I loved this movie.  It was the exact level of fright that I was looking for.  There were scenes that I never saw coming, there were elements that were unexpected and vividly raw, and it thankfully did not follow the ever-classic Hollywood horror formula.  There was originality and emotion in this film that most horror directors do not give when dabbing in the horror genre.  This was a great story, and I cannot wait to gather friends for a late night horror scream-fest featuring this film.  From the opening scene, to the bus scene, to the opportunistic final moment, I had my finger on the fast-forward and I was scared.  This did what it set out to do for me, and for that I can only praise this film!

29569,1,0767827759,"The best thing I have ever seen Bill Pullman do was at the beginning of this uninspired yet marginally creepy film. It is worth owning just to watch Mr. Bill's first scene. He has owed us this ever since Mr. Wrong. Thank you Bill, thank you SOOOO much. It was only fair.

The rest of the movie is creepy in parts, but breaks its own rules more than once. Once you finally make sense of it, you will realize that it was only confusing because it broke its own set guidelines for what is happening. Even the writer made statements in the ""making of"" doc that contradict what happens in the final flashbacks. He says something about a certain someone ""not knowing why she was murdered"", but that particular person knows only too well why she is being attacked.

Leave it to Sam Raimi to cheapen and commercialize a legitimately original Japanese film, inject Hollywood mainstay actors who are known for being little more than cardboard cut-outs, and then supress the truly inspired film so that Americans won't ever see it. Shame on you, Samuel P. Raimi, and all others who are suppressing the True Art of film. The 20th century saw the creation of the film medium, the 21st century will see its destruction. That is, if those who love film don't do something about it. Films are not made to be REMADE, they are made to stand in their own right. What's next on the agenda? Remake Vertigo? Remake Raging Bull?

I thought the foreign version was greatly over-rated by fans who were determined to be scared no matter what was thrown upon the screen. In the American version, I saw the identical ""scare"" moments which didn't chill me at all. I was shocked by Sarah Michelle Geller's appearance. She looked exhausted through the entire movie and exuded very little energy. As for the ghost boy, he looked like a kid who had gotten into a bag of flour and covered his face with it. And then somebody came along and plastered mascara around his eyes. Was this supposed to be one of the scenes where you jumped out of your seat? In the ""Making of..."" documentary, the film-makers seemed proud of having not made a linear movie--that is, ""The Grudge"" dips into the future, then the past, then the present. To me, it was confusing and style overpowered the effectiveness of this movie. The same Japanese director who made the foreign version of ""The Grudge"" was hired to make this Americanized production. That was a major mistake right there.

29572,4,0767827759,"I am at a loss to explain a few of the negative reviews ""The Grudge"" got from some critics (like Roger Ebert, who should know better.) Granted, it's not a recognizably instant classic like ""The Ring"", so ""The Grudge"" probably suffers by comparison in the minds of some.  And its intricate story structure and downbeat themes may put off some people.  But ""The Grudge"" is, on its own terms, a very effective exercise in horror that is all the more terrifying because of its restraint.

The movie is told in parallel story lines that move back and forth in time, so you have to pay attention.  Its vision of history as an eternal, cyclical nightmare from which it is impossible to awaken may not be comforting to straight-forward, problem-solving Americans.  But it is very Japanese and has a haunting relevance nowadays.  As someone once said, ""you may be through with the past; but the past is not through with you.""  More than one critic complained that this movie ""didn't go anywhere""; that it was just an excuse to string together a sequence of very creepy images.  Well, the images are very creepy indeed (including an elevator ride that will haunt your dreams.)  But not being able to escape or move forward is very much the point.  Unlike a lot of American films, ""The Grudge"" doesn't feel obligated to explain everything and spell out every plot point.  You have to fill in some of the gaps, and tricking you into getting your imagination working overtime is a good strategy for the filmmakers.

Sarah Michelle Gellar does a fine, quietly touching acting job as a good-hearted American girl who to tries to fight the evil but is in way over her head.  She's plucky in a vulnerable way; it's very different from the ass-kicking Buffy we all know and love.  Anyone who still says she's limited as an actress is full of crap.  Director Shimizu has a nicely poetic touch that make the horror all the more awful.  I was exhilarated after watching this movie.

29577,4,0767827759,"After watching Ju-On tonight, I was finally able to stack it up against its American counterpart, the Grudge.  Here's how the movies compare as I see it.

1) Predictably, there are quite a number of scenes that occur in both flims.  In these cases, the American version is better every time.  It's well known that the Grudge had better special effects, and truthfully, it's not even close.  The scene with the surveillance camera in particular was much more striking and unnerving in the Grudge.

2) Ju-On takes much longer to get started.  By the looks of it, more people preferred the slower beginning, perhaps because they are given more time to get a sense of what's going on.  The Grudge doesn't hesitate to punch the viewer in the mouth right from the get-go, which helps avoid what some may believe to be a slow (read: boring) start.  To every man his own, but I enjoyed the quick jolt to kick things off.  Maybe I'm also the impatient type.  Hmm.

3) I've seen/heard a few complaints about how the plot loses some continuity, cohesiveness, and QUALITY during the translation.  While I will agree that Ju-On is more focused on the storyline, it's not a heady tale to begin with.  The Grudge is based off of a very simple premise, one that you can read about in any of its trailers.  Bottom line: if you're avoiding the Grudge for what seems to be a lame plot, than Ju-On won't really excite you either.

The Grudge will make you jump more, which may be a turnoff for people who want unbearable tension instead.  What could make the difference is the appearance of Kayako, the lovely girl who terrorizes all and whose face is undoubtedly burned into the minds of many viewers: she looks a bit upset in Ju-On, whereas in the Grudge, we see fear on her face, which I believe looks even more menacing.

One thing I hated with the movie was that it jumped around showing the different affects that the grudge affected all of the characters.

29581,3,0767827759,"I'm curious about why so many reviewers made a point of saying this movie was nothing like The Ring other than the fact that both are Americanized remakes of the Japanese originals. The two films are very similar in that they are both ghost stories...very Japanese ghost stories. In fact, I kind of wish I had seen The Grudge before I saw The Ring because the Grudge (and the DVD interviews with Sam Raimi and Takashi Shimizu) explains why both films were so creepy and disturbing.

At the heart of both film's effectiveness is the difference between Western and Eastern ghost tales. In the West, there is almost always some type of redemption: the wicked are punished, the innocent are damaged but wiser, and the ghost is at peace. In Eastern stories, ghosts (at least those of a person who died confused and angry) are always hungry for revenge and can never be at peace. In addition, anyone is fair game no matter how guilty or innocent. One of the shockers in The Ring is the false conclusion where we find out that what we thought put the ghost at peace had no effect at all other than to solve the mystery of how the girl died.

The demons are also very Eastern: not the ugly, leering Christian demons from hell but ones that are unsettling and watchful. More portents of distruction than bringers.

I actually appreciated the restraint with CGI and gore after having seen Exorcist: The Beginning just the night before. Although the thinking behind films these days seems to be that the audience expects lots of gore and special effects (otherwise they won't pay to see the film), I think the over-the-top approach usually detracts from the story as was the case in Exorcist I (which had potential but ended up being an abortion of a movie).

The non-linear approach to telling the story didn't bother me; in fact I enjoyed it because it sustained the mystery. In another inevitable comparison to The Ring, I think The Grudge, is far more satisfying it it's explaination for why the vengeful ghost and why the seemling indiscriminate selection of victims.

One more plus, the DVD interviews with Sam Raimi and Takashi Shimizu were a lot more enlightening than the typical gushing sound bites you find on most DVDs. They seemed to have left the over the top superlatives to the American performers.

The movie has some weaknesses which is why I gave it only three stars.

First, the pacing seems glacial: there aren't many extreme emotional events for the first 30 minutes. Even events that seem like they should be disturbing, left me feeling ""why should I care?"" Because Sam Raimi (""Evil Dead"" and ""Spiderman"") isn't exactly the most understated of filmakers, I imagine the quietness and pacing of the film was a deliberate decision. For me, it didn't work.

Second, the lead played by Sarah Michelle Geller, seemed to be not much more than a one-dimensional vehicle for keeping the story moving. If you're expecting Buffy kicking demon ass, you'll need to look at reruns or DVD compilations. Buffy is no where to be found in this movie.

Bottom line: I recommend this movie IF you are open to the fact that it is a Japanese ghost story and with the exception of casting American actors, does little to Westernize the film. If you're expecting The Ring (the Westernized version) you'll be disapointed.",1110758400,,3308,4.739130434782608
29582,5,0767827759,"I don't understand the all around bad reviews for this movie, from critics to the audience.  In my opinion this movie represents a glimpse into the future of filmmaking.

Perhaps it is a cultural problem with the concepts of the supernatural between westerners and asians.  In our movies, ghosts and demons have to have a purpose or a Satanic director but asian ghosts do not.  Asian ghosts simply exist and they have no explanation.  That being said, the ghosts in this movie do have a plan but the filmmakers feel they don't have to explain.  I will grant that the film feels very brief.  Obviously it was planned with sequels in mind so only part of Peter's, Karen's, Toshio's and Kayako's stories are told.  But the hints are there if you look for them.  Karen, like Peter, is one of the only characters who looks at the boy in his non-demonic form.  The female demon constantly resists attacking her.  Could she have some relation to Peter?  We don't know yet but at the end, it is clear that the demons have something very special planned for Karen.

As to the future of films, watch the documentaries included with the DVD.  The Japanese crew filmed extremely efficiently and economically.  But the movie never feels rushed or shortchanged.  The set design is fantastic!  From the glamorous high-rise apartment of the investment banker, Peter's modest Professor apartment, Karen's student hovel filled with japanese and american knick-knack's to the haunted house itself, everything feels lived in and natural.  Nothing looks as if it has been ripped out of the pages of Pottery Barn like the set design in American films today.  The surroundings are used to explain the life of the characters.  It opens big showing them living their international lives then squeezing out the life in them.

29589,4,0767827759,"Hollywood, in the last few years, has discovered the Japanese flair for horror films. ""The Grudge"", however, is the first collaboration between American producers and Japanese producers, using famed Japanese director, Takashi Shimizu's original film of the same name, in an effort to make popular the Japanese horror film for the western audience, without losing its critical edge in the translation. Tinsel town's adaptation of ""The Ring"", for example, in some respects was successful, though managed to lose something in the translation. ""The Grudge"", though, remained on task, maintaining that quintessential Japanese horror atmosphere, non-linear narrative style and open ending. More importantly, ""The Grudge"" is a chilling tale - a ghost story with an edge.

Revenge is the underlying theme of this film, and the story is actually taken from Japanese folklore. As the legend goes, a king loses a chess game to an underling. The king not only kills the winning underling, but also kills his entire family. As the family have been murdered unjustly, their rage develops and a curse is born. Their spirits are held in place with emotional rage, a grudge, and they inflict this rage on the living. In the film, there has been a murder suicide in a house, and all those that come into contact with the house, become the victims of these vengeful spirits. This may appear to be a standard plot idea for a ghost story, but it is the way that Shimizu tells the story that makes it interesting. The film seamlessly moves backwards and forward in time, telling us the story in fragments, until the entire plot comes together at the climax. For me this had great effect, as this method maintained my attention from start to finish - a welcome diversion from standard linear story telling.

Sarah Michelle Geller as Kare Davis put in a believable performance as the young American caretaker. She can appear realistically horrified without it seeming tacky or melodramatic.

Overall a good horror film that had me riveted from the start to its over the top finale.",1110585600,2,2057,4.9912536443148685

29592,4,0767827759,"The Grudge (Takashi Shimizu, 2004)

Among die-hard film snobs (like yours truly), the name of Korean producer Roy Lee has become the most loathed in Hollywood virtually overnight. Lee's tremendous success with the remake of The Ring led him to embrace the ""if it ain't broke, fix it anyway"" philosophy wholeheartedly. A check on his IMDB page shows no fewer than seventeen projects either completed or in production, the majority of them being American remakes of Japanese films (mostly horror, but Hideo Nakata's brilliant mystery Chaos is represented as well). But the bottom line is that if all of Lee's upcoming projects are as well-done as The Ring and The Grudge, folks have nothing at all to worry about.

Takashi Shimizu directs the remake of his own Ju-On, translated by Stephen Susco (whose next project is Lucky McKee's adaptation of Jack Ketchum's novel Red, another ""can't-wait-to-see-this"" movie), and for all intents and purposes, all that was done was replace some of the main actors with Americans. Some of the actors from the original film also reprise their roles here (most notably Takako Fuji as Kayako), while other, better-known Japanese actors dropped into some roles for the remake (most notably Ryo Ishibashi, who gained recognition on this side of the pond as the lead in Takashi Miike's Audition). What you end up with is an above-average cast featuring some actors who really don't get enough exposure in American cinema (Grace Zabriskie, whose role here is understated and chilling in the extreme, for example).

Because the original director reprised his role this time, The Grudge bears far more of a resemblance to the original than did The Ring. Still, it bears looking at as its own movie, rather than as a remake, and it is quite a lovely thing to behold-- the horror of the film comes not so much from the events as from the incredible attention to detail and the overall atmosphere of the thing. Definitely worth your time. ****",1110412800,5,1966,4.951515151515151

29596,2,0767827759,"""The Grudge"" is based on the Japanese hit, ""Ju On,"" which I viewed a few months before watching this film.  Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Karen Davis, an American student who works for some kind of social work agency - the details are never really apparent.  When one of her colleagues fails to show up for work, Gellar is sent to care for an elderly patient.  Upon arriving at the home, Gellar finds a creepy boy (Toshio) locked in the closet, which sets into action the main plot.

I'm definitely not opposed to foreign films being remade for the American market; however, they seldom live up to the original, as is the case with ""The Grudge.""  The film retains many of the original elements, including the Tokyo locale, director Takashi Shimizu, several Japanese stars, and the basic story.  Interestingly, much of the background story has changed, which makes the plot more linear and comprehensible.  However, the result is a story that is much more obvious and devoid of suspense.  What played as mystical and creepy in the original film with Japanese actors sometimes seems semi-laughable when Gellar or Bill Pullman are inserted into the action.  I'm not a Buffy fan, but I couldn't help but think that Gellar should kick the specter into next year.

I wasn't a big fan of ""Ju On,"" but it did have creepy atmosphere that's missing from ""The Grudge.""  Thus, I can't recommend the remake.",1110067200,8,1392,4.7824267782426775

29599,3,0767827759,"Why is it that no one in America can make a truly stellar horror flick? Can't anyone come up with an original idea and not have to borrow from past movies (IE- the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre, those awful Jason movies, etc. and the even worse Alien Vs. Predator) and Japanese horror films (The Ring, anyone?)? Alright. All that aside. This is a so so movie. I was scared most of the time, I'll give it that, but I was left disappointed with too many questions floating around in my head. I don't just want to be scared. I crave a great story. A story that begs to be told. This one so does not do this!

Basically, the movie is about a family who moves into a new hosue in Japan. Yes the house is lovely. Yes you must take your shoes off when you enter, even if it is your house. Strange things begin to happen to this family. The mother begins to stare at the wall. Her son is worried and his wife is nervous about living in Japan. The movie moves back and forth between several stories, one of which is this one about the family. The other is about Sarah Michelle Gellar's character, a student who is assigned to visit the seemingly senile mother in this freaky house. I love how Gellar walks toward the house so slowly and looks back and forth like a manic squirrel. She's never been there before. What's there to be afraid of yet? Anyway, she begins to see things too. Soon people end up disappearing. Dying. Seeing little boys who meow. Very strange. What's the deal with this house? What's happening to everyone? What's Bill Pullman jumping out a window in the beginning have to do with the story? It's convoluted, but it's not too hard to follow.

It kinda reminded me of The Ring, just the way it looks and how the tone is. I like The Ring better, though. This movie did scare me. I actually had to stay up and watch Full House just to get it out of my system. Ugh. Some of the images are just horrifying. And imagine having a younger sister who wants to freeze frame them all and stare at them for countless minutes and laugh at you while you squirm. You want a good scare? Check this out.

29600,2,0767827759,"I went to the movies to see this and I wish I hadn't wasted the money. It was not scary and it was rather bizarre...

I guess its like when someone dies violently there is rage left behind in the place where they were killed and Sarah Michelle finds out what happened in the house to make it haunted...

I don't want to give things away in case you decide to actually see it for yourself... but I would skip it. It's not scary, it's odd, the story isn't even good, and the talent is at mediocre best.

I was utterly dissappointed in this film and do not recommend it.",1109894400,4,1068,4.351758793969849
29601,3,0767827759,"I must admit I was rather disappointed by The Grudge. I've watched a lot of horror movies, and The Grudge just didn't strike me as very scary at all - it's creepy enough on occasion to make some viewers jump, but I didn't find anything actually scary about any of it - unless you think Japanese women and little boys wearing black mascara in Tammy Faye proportions is scary. It would have helped if more of the ""scary"" moments hadn't been preceded by an obvious, ridiculously loud crescendo of the music. I wasn't all that impressed with the story, either - it hangs together just fine, but it didn't seem to have much substance. I wouldn't even begin to compare this film with The Ring, which was much, much scarier and emotionally powerful. I have a lot of respect for Japanese horror films, so I'm not blaming any type of cultural differences between Japanese audiences and myself for my dissatisfaction. To me, this film just wasn't nearly as different or original as the filmmakers assert in all of the making-of featurettes. Just because The Grudge serves up a non-linear presentation of the plot and doesn't employ gore to impart its most visceral effects doesn't mean the film is automatically excellent (in the same way that a gory film is not automatically bad just because of the gore). It all comes down to the story, and this just isn't that great of a story.

Sarah Michelle Gellar (who has, by the way, looked better than she does here) stars as a sort-of nurse who has moved to Tokyo with her boyfriend (who, unfortunately, seems to have graduated from the Ashton Kutcher school of fashion). She helps care for infirm patients, and she has to fill in at a certain house one day - while there, she displays an unhealthy curiosity for a series of strange noises, which leads her to a creepy little boy and his fierce cat; before the day is through, she sees something much more frightening than that. Well, it turns out that this particular house was the scene of a violent crime, and the emotional angst that accompanied that terrible event remains in the house, marking for death everyone who dares cross over the threshold. We're soon off on the first of several flashbacks. By the midpoint of the film, it's obvious what is going on here, but that doesn't stop the onslaught of flashbacks. The ending is a little different than what you might expect - but I found it rather unsatisfying (although it does furnish some of the film's creepier - but still not scary - moments).

I just think this movie needed something more, especially at the end; the whole thing felt more like a number of related scenes thrown together than a full-fledged movie. Part of my frustration probably stems from the fact that Gellar's character is absent from a good chunk of the first hour of the film. Gellar seemed really excited about this film in her interviews, but that wonderful Gellar magic seemed bottled up in every one of her scenes. Her whole character never seemed to develop fully - actually, that's a problem with the movie as a whole. I really didn't care about any of these characters, be they innocent or guilty. And I really don't think there is anything complex about the plot - the filmmakers tried to make it seem complicated by the nonlinear storyline, but the final big flashback at the end was almost boring because it wasn't showing me anything I hadn't already figured out. I'm not buying the argument that The Grudge is comparatively deeper or more intellectual than many a good western horror film, either - a film like The Others beats The Grudge hands down, in my opinion.

The movie does come with some 45 minutes of interviews and behind-the-scenes materials, as well as a 12-minute lecture on the psychological nature of fear. There was a little bit of overkill with all this. I got the impression I was expected to love this film just because it was rooted in Japanese culture, made by the Japanese director and film crew of Ju-on, and different than typical Hollywood horror movies. I'm sorry, but as much as I love Sarah Michelle Gellar, The Grudge just didn't impress me all that much.

Who are these people who simply assume that Japanese films in their original Japanese formats won't fly in America? I'm sure Ju-on is a much better film that this Americanized remake - how about slapping some subtitles on the originals and giving American audiences a chance to prove whether or not films like Ringu and Ju-on can fill the seats of American movie houses?",1109808000,39,4492,4.675094816687737

29603,4,0767827759,"A lot was riding on Sarah Michelle Gellar's new movie, The Grudge. If it failed at the box office she could be faced with the prospect of more Scooby Doo sequels while its success could lead to bigger and better things. After all, it was her first serious film role after six years on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and proof that she could carry a movie on her name alone. Gellar is smart. She doesn't stray from the genre that made her a star. The financial success of The Grudge surpassed expectations that the studio had for it and a sequel is already in the works.

There is a spirited audio commentary by Sam and Ted Raimi, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rob Tapert, Clea DuVall, Stephen Susco, Jason Behr and KaDee Strickland. Tapert MCs the proceedings, often prompting the participants with questions. Everybody recounts production anecdotes, including working in Japan, getting used to their customs and working with Shimizu.

""A Powerful Rage: Behind The Grudge"" examines several aspects of the movie and can be viewed in five separate featurettes or altogether. Unlike the original, which used actual locations, the house in this new version existed entirely on a set. The cast also talk about Shimizu's distinctive vision and his working methods.

Finally, ""Under the Skin"" features Dr. Joseph LeDoux, a professor of neural science and psychology. He talks about how fear in horror films work on its audience.",1109635200,,1408,4.932489451476793
29604,3,0767827759,"First off, I thought this movie was okay. The acting was fine, and the pace of the story kept it from dragging too much. However, the basic idea is, well...stupid. According to the movie, Japan has a superstition that anyone who is murdered and dies in a way that involves great anger or sorrow (which should cover most deaths) ends up killing everyone who enters the house the death occurred in. If this were actually possible, I have to assume the Japanese government/police would have grown wise to this and torn down houses like the one this story focuses on. If you can accept that no one would ever catch on to this bit of the obvious in Japan, then the movie is enjoyable, to a point. This is one of those ""jigsaw"" movies that unfold out of chronological order, so you have to pay attention to the entire second half to understand why this particular story is the one being told. If they make a sequel, I hope they address some of the unanswered questions from this movie. (For instance, is the grudge so strong that the ghost(s) would follow someone back to America? Is there a time limit to how long you have to be in the house to justify being killed, like a plumber addressing a leaky toilet?) The mystery continues...",1109548800,2,1229,4.491071428571429
29605,3,0767827759,"If you ask whether or not 'The Grudge' is really creepy, yes, it is, but I think horror film fans would find the film as a whole is trying to be too clever.  It features American actors but is set in Japan (directed by Japanese Takashi Shimizu), and moreover throws away the usual chronological order to tell the story, very unusual storytelling method in horror films.

With this non-linear approach, the film can be ambitious.  So what you see in the first scene is the most shocking.  You see Bill Pullman staring at the city of Tokyo, from the window of an apartment.  Then, wow, a big surprise comes.

Sara Michelle Geller is nominal star of the film, but the real feature is actually the evil power that must be dwelling in the apparently ordinaly small, Japanese-style house in Tokyo.  It is soon revealed that in that place some terrible incidents happen to the visitors, including Ms. Geller's character Karen, American exchange student, or other people (mostly Americans, including Clea Duvall or Jason Behr as Geller's boyfriend).

[SURELY CREEPY] The film is surely creepy, and the film comes with the carefully controled sound effects (as in 'The Ringu' or 'Ju-On' the latter being the original version of this film).  The atmosphere of Tokyo is captured very well, and the 'lost' sense of American visitors in this city is presented convincingly.  (Incidentally, you can see the same downtown street of Shinjuku, as was seen in 'Lost in Translation'.)

But horror fans would soon realize that director Shimizu uses some conventional scares -- like sudden big noises -- and the film often looks as if too eager to be scary.  In the latter half, the film begins to show its defects -- it is repetitious.  People are killed, or intimidated, by Toshio and Kayako (evil spirits played by the same actors as Japanese versions), but ... it is as if we see too much of them, maybe more than Ms. Geller herself.

[IN A NUTSHELL] the problem is this.  In the beginning of the film, you see THE GRUDGE IS THE CURSE OF THE ONE WHO DIES IN THE GRIP OF POWERFUL RAGE. and that curse is, it says PASSED, LIKE A VIRUS, FROM VICTIM TO VICTIM IN AN ENDLESS, GROWING CHAIN OF HORROR.  Yes, it looks endless, in a bad way.

Perhaps the film's history is more interesting than the Hollywood remake itself.  The original 'Ju-on' and its sequel (shot at the same time) were made-for-video short films.  Then, two theatrical films were made, AND this Hollywood remake.  The franchize spread like a virus.  And they are planning to make another one.

I was enormously impressed with the Japanese original, and even more impressed with this version because it retains the same feeling of.... well, incomparable creepiness. This is a hell of a film, and don't be put off that Sarah Michelle Geller is the big teen name on the poster - this is not a teen scream flick but a well executed, supremely disturbing film by a defiantly groundbreaking director, the same artist as directed the original. I rate this at four stars only because Ms. Geller, while not doing damage to the work, is a bit limited in her range. The Grudge is worlds beyond the usual pablum that passes for horror from US studios, and will hopefully turn many Americans on to the exceptional cinema coming out of Japan.

Friday night. My wife was out with some friends and I was home with a sinus infection and an incredible urge to watch a scary movie and eat pizza. About twenty minutes into the DVD I wanted a blanket to lay on the couch. But, it was in the room at the end of the hall. I had to turn on the lights in the hall and in the room.

Saturday morning. I was feeling a little better and went to work in a drab office building with boring white hallways. I was the only one there and I got the creeps, again.

Saturday afternoon. I went home and watched the bonus features on how ""The Grudge"" was made. The features are well done and interesting. And, they showed some of the secrets that made the movie so scary. There, creepiness gone.

Monday evening. I wonder why that ghost moved like it did. Oh... it's probably because... echh.

It's Thursday. I think I figured out why the ghost made that sound.

Get it? I'm a 47 year old man, and I'm no sissy! But, this film got to me in ways I didn't expect. I think it was the feeling of disorientation that made the most powerful impact on me. Americans in Japan; even normal things outside ""the house"" are a little different. When the hauntings come nothing looks, moves, or sounds the way it should. There's only one brief, gross moment of horror, the rest is just a very good ghost story. I was impressed.",1109116800,,1414,4.257462686567164

Some people never learn. The creators of this movie seem to have cared more of the income they made at the movies.

This movie has a great (looking) cast, but that's it. They are from teen tv shows like Roswell, Xena and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. However there is no room for them to even say a one decent clever dialogue. The only thing they are good for are either looking stupid or scared and finally dying. I loved Bill Pullmans acting in Zero Effect and I thought that he would do a great job in this movie as well. Nope. I never once cared for any of the characters, They die They live Just the same to me. The actors probably took the job because it was easy: Five minutes of talking at maximum and lots of money to expect, except for learning how to pronounce the japanese word ""Konnichiwa"" of course.

My recommendation is that you go and see other better and new horror movies like Saw or Dawn of the Dead if you haven't seen them already.

To the big question: Is it scary? Well... It is quiet for a while and an actress sees a dark room, she's thinking ""What's that?"".

29616,5,0767827759,"First of all, I love a good scary movie.  They hard to find.  When I first saw the trailer to The Grudge, I compared it to The Ring.  When I actually saw the movie on the first night it came out, I was very impressed.  There were frightening moments throughout the movie.  If you are into the ""get ready, somethings about to happen"" scenes in a movie, this is for you.  I love the anticipation of what's about to happen.

In my book, The Grudge is a must see.  I saw it the first day it was in the theaters and I bought the DVD on the first day it was available.  I recommend it to anyone looking for chills & thrills.  It'll scare the pants off of most.  Put on some popcorn, pop in the DVD, turn off the lights & enjoy. I suggest watching with someone.  You won't be disappointed.  You'll be scared out of your wits.

29617,4,0767827759,"The Grudge (2004).  Unrated. Running Time: One hour, 31 mins.
Directed by Takashi Shimizu. Written by Takashi Shimizu and Stephen Susco.

American remake from the Ju-On films, also directed and written by Takashi Shimizu.

Everyone saw the television commercial for this movie and it scared the goosebumps on us.  It must be the quickest release to DVD for a film.  We also remember the advertisement for SAW (2004) as well.
  Yoko (Yoko Maki) is a health-care provider to an American woman, Emma (Grace Zabriskie) in Japan who is unable to take care of herself.  Yoko hears something and searches around the house for noise.  She opens a door, similar to a closet and looks around as if it's an attic.  Suddenly something pulls her up and she is gone.
  Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is the substitute caregiver to take care of Emma.  She finds Emma in horrible conditions.  After cleaning her up, she too begins to hear noises.  She finds a black cat with one yellow eye and one green eye and a Japanese boy.  After discovering the cordless phone gone, she sees out the corner of her eye someone walk by the door in Emma's room.  She opens the sliding door and Emma is frightened.  Emma says, ""I just want her to leave me alone"".  Suddenly frightened again, Karen turns around and sees the most horrifying thing of all.
  This movie centers around Emma and people connected to her.  This thing just isn't in this house, but can go to other places too to haunt you.

  Also in the cast: Bill Pullman (The Serpent and the Rainbow), Clea DeVall, Kadee Strickland, Jason Behr, William Mapother (ABC LOST tv series), Rosa Blasi and Ted Raimi.  Toshio is played by Yuya Ozeki.

Filmed in Toho Studios and Aoyama, Tokyo, Japan.

  DVD includes behind-the-scenes stuff, how nice and specific Director Takashi Shimizu is and in ""Under The Skin"", Joseph LeDoux, Ph.d will explain to you why we like to be scared.  Also an audio commentary with cast & crew.

29618,5,0767827759,I bought this movie because my friend told me it was good.  When i first watch it was a little bit scarey but throughout the movie it wasn't that scarey for me.  I say this is great dub version of jung wah movie.  A must get movie.,1108598400,2,231,3.872340425531915
29619,5,0767827759,"Though this movie was not a major hit with critics,and some people were only luke warm to its delivery,i was intrigued from the first preview i saw. Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a defying leap from her usual Buffy Slayer roles,and plays the scared victiom of this film. Movies like The Ring,Mothman Prophecies etc.base the horror on the human mind,what you believe even though you can't see it and are any of these things real. Well even though this movie is very similar to the formentioned you do see a lot more than what you would expect from this type of film. There is no extreme gore,killers or even huge creatures with razor sharp teeth,just people who definately look like they have something to be ticked off about,and there color is somewhat off,pale or even blue,with black eyes,which make for some really scary images. The one floating person(demon,ghost)what have you is about the scariest looking thing i have ever witnessed on film(only in my dreams).The eerie sounds they make is even worse,and often makes you want to hide and close your ears,me being 29 doesnt matter,i still felt that way. The story line may be cliche even though i won't reveal that information,this does make for one of the scariest movies i've ever seen,it definately answers the question of,what was that sound,what is under the bed?Whats in the closest?Whats in the Attic?among many others. So watch this film bravely in the dark,and see how much you sleep tonight.",1108512000,4,1455,4.894736842105263

I saw it at the theatre with a group of my friends and there were a lot of parts where the movie ""popped"" out at you and made the whole audience jump.  I love that.  It was a great movie to see if you get scared of your closet or noises in your house at night.  I mostly found this movie funny, however, because I tend not to get scared of movies anymore.  I did jump at the ""pop out"" scenes though.",1108512000,2,438,3.8764044943820224

The opening was totally unexpected and you'll ask yourself ""why"". Sooner in this movie you will find the answers to the beginning. But later on you will find yourself asking more questions, than getting answers. The film is quite confusing and you have to pay close attention. The movie switches from the past to the present without you noticing it at times. Its a very tricky little film. Also pay close to little details you may notice they will help you understand the ending better. This is a film that should be watched twice. After I walked out of the theather, I was questioning myself. I did not understand the film, neither did my friends. Later on, I thought about the film again and thought I pretty much understood it now. Then when it came out on DVD, I bought it and watched it again. After I watched it the 2nd time, I fully understood it. I realized I missed things from the 1st time I watched it. So if you wanna figure out the mystery to this film, you got to pay close attention to it. Overall, it was pretty creepy, but not quite scary.",1108425600,3,1172,4.3807339449541285

29623,3,0767827759,"I haven't seen Ju-On, but though I generally prefer to start with the original, I figured the experience wasn't likely to differ that much.  Same director, same locations. Same basic story.  And with this version, I get Sarah Michelle Gellar--though a sadder, more chastened Sarah Michelle Gellar I've never seen.  Her character was badly in need of a Prozac through the whole film.  It was like Angel had just gone bad again.

Some people have complained about the disjointed storytelling.  For the most part, this worked fine for me.  It added a level of drama and mystery to the whole thing that we wouldn't have had if the story had been chronological.  We're not only interested in what is happening, but in why.

Unfortunately, the pay-off is not so grand.  The forces that called these onryou--these vengeful spirits--into being are slightly questionable, and the way they function--especially outside the confines of the house--is never clear.

That said, the movie had some creepy atmospherics and a deft hand with the jump scenes.  It didn't haunt me like the best horror movies do.  I watched it at night...in the dark...alone.  And I slept just fine afterwards.  But I had some spine-tingling moments while watching it.  I don't feel compelled to seek out the original as I might have done if this one had blown me away, and I probably won't be going for a second viewing, but it was a decent enough way to spend an hour and a half of my time.",1108425600,2,1455,4.7370517928286855

Its been many, many movies since I've found one that actually gave me the goosebumps and chills I was looking for - (I certainly didn't expect to find one with BTVS in it).

29627,4,0767827759,"""The Grudge (2004)"" is based on the Japanese horror film ""Ju-on (The Grudge.)"" Japanese Director Takashi Shimizu directed both films.

""The Grudge (2004)"" is filmed with American actors. Bill Pullman, Jason Behr, Clea Duvall (Currently in Carnivale.) and Grace Zabriski were sent off to Tokyo to work with Takashi Shimizu. Sarah Michelle Gellar is used as the cover popularity, recognized name, but plays a supporting part to the haunted house. A never-ending curse is thrust upon this house because of what happened there. Do not step inside this house!

Takashi Shimizu utilizes time segments to develop this film into an ending climax. The film starts out in the middle, then procedures to go back and forth from present to past.  I enjoyed this horror film. This film is a break from all special effects movies that Hollywood seems to force upon us. Yes a movie can still be made without them! Was I scared? Sure. The director does take the viewers point of view in mind. I just can't get that scream and little boy creature out of my mind.

This horror film takes you back to the old days of filming horror films. No CGI special effects here. Everything you see in the film is real. Okay, I found this out by viewing the bonus features. I strongly recommend viewing the bonus features for filming techniques and technical applications applied. American horror films and Japanese horror films are completely polar opposites. An American haunted house is totally different than a Japanese haunted house. I don't want to give away too much, but the Japanese haunted house is ruthless and relentless.",1108425600,,1601,4.8966789667896675

It is NOT, however, fast paced and overly worried about the instant gratification of its audience... you have to sit there and let the cumulative effect of the film wash over you, and THEN you might say, ""wow, that wasn't bad.""  Also, though the movie features much more intelligence and depth than most horror films these days (especially the gore-spattered R-rated offerings in the multi-plexes every few weeks), the story isn't nearly as complex as it initially seems.  Once you see the whole movie and re-construct the timeline in your head in a normal, linear fashion, the movie is actually no more complicated than your average ""Friday the 13th"" entry.  It just tells its simple story better than most other horror movies tell their simple stories.  But there's nothing wrong with that, so, in the end, I say give ""The Grudge"" a whirl.

Not in my opinion..Just a bunch of flashy imaging. The entire film was a boring, stupid, mess. I guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror film I have seen in years. And that Buffy chick? Well, she's a bad actress! As plastic as Barbie and just as talented..No, wait, that would be an insult to BARBIE!

When I read about the movie, it sounded promising:  young American woman residing in Japan with her boyfriend. She is temporarily assigned to be a caretaker for a woman with severe sleeping conditions.  The house is plagued by the presence of murderous ghosts, the result of a curse. The curse is born from someone dying in a powerful rage.  Seemed interesting enough but I was wrong.  It's almost as if there should have been a prequel to this movie.

While watching in the comfort of your own home, you have to pay attention and stick with the story, keeping the hand off the remote. The pay off with what was up with Bill Pullman's character was really interesting and disturbing, in a good way, for an old horror film fan like me. The ghosts are really scary , too! ""The Grudge"" is a really fun popcorn movie to watch with your girfriend and isn't that what scary movies are about? Great stuff from Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert's Ghost House movies.

However, it's solemnity is one of its downfalls.  The movie seems longer than it really is and the non-linear editing keeps the storyline confusing, albeit interesting to a point.  Bill Pullman's suicide in the opening sequence goes unexplained for a long time and even when we find out what may have precipitated it, we don't know his true motivation:  guilt or was he compelled to do so because of the house's evil curse?  Sarah Michelle Gellar not only looks anorexic and anemic, but her performance is likewise uninspired.  Her years on Buffy may have convinced her that her presence alone is worth a viewer's interest, but I was really surprised at her lackluster participation.  Jason Behr as her boyfriend Doug seemed to be infected with this apathy as well.  The lighting, sound effects and spook effects were very well done, and as mentioned earlier, there is a sense of menace in some of the scenes.

Anyway, The Grudge is worth viewing once, but it doesn't hold up much beyond that.  There are no surprises here; the ""secret"" to the plot is given away in the very beginning.  The scary moments are purely manipulative and stereotypical.  You know, a loud noise here, a blast of suspenseful music there.  The only thing I liked about this movie was the cast, which included some decent actors.  KayDee Strickland in particular seems to have a career ahead of her.  I'm a big Buffy fan, but Sarah Michelle Gellar pretty much sleepwalks through this movie.  She doesn't really seem to care what is going on, and I felt the same.

This movie was- A) Not at all scary, B) bounced around more than a basketball game, C) embarrassing to watch the terrible acting by otherwise good (not great) actors, D) and despite a workable and understandable premise- got terribly lost in translating this premise to the audience.  In fact, you have to keep reminding yourself what the movie is SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT because it gets lost in the process.  Our family of 4 sat down to watch this movie and by a third of the way into it, all of us were preoccupied with other things.  I finally ended the madness by fast forwarding to the last chapter to see the stupid and disappointing ending!  Proving once again, box office success (in this case opening weekend before everyone stopped going to see it) does not necessarily mean- GOOD movie.

29637,5,0767827759,"Many have given ""The Grudge"" a very unjust rating, most likely because it isn't the typical American mindless gore that we have seen in so many horror films of both the past (Friday the 13th?) and present (Seed of Chucky?).  While those films cirtainly have appeal to many fans of the genre, they hardly require your strict attention to follow the plot.  ""The Grudge"" is different in that it doesn't use gore, or even violence (for the most part) to accomplish the scare.  Instead it uses long approaches into scenes in which the audience can anticipate the outcome but is still startled and surprised when it actually happens.

The ending to the movie has been one of its most criticized points, but it is very much in sticking to Japanese tradition where man is not the stronger than the spirit world surrounding him, and with many of the other modern horror flicks.

Overall I am not a fan of the horror genre - usually finding them more funny in their rediculousness than scary, but I can say that this is one of the very few movies that have actually scared me.  To me that is all it takes to be a good horror movie.

I enthusiastically recomend it and agree with one of the other reviewers here - it is better to watch it once, then watch all of the special features - including the cast & crew commentary - and then watch it again to pick up on all the things you missed the first time.

The only bad comment I might have is that noone ever really fought for their life, and I doubt many of the characters would have been so ,literally, scared stiff.",1108166400,9,1557,4.400696864111498

I rented The Grudge thinking that it was a good caliber horror movie.  It stunk.  The movie is poorly made and is not scary.

Compared to another similar movie, The Ring, this movie is not even in the same ballpark.  Don't waste your money or time with this let down of a movie.",1108080000,2,527,4.107843137254902
29639,3,0767827759,"First off, I have to admit to having seen the Japanese version of this film, ""Ju-On,"" and comparatively speaking, this Americanized version is similar in many ways but there was definitely something lost in the translation.  I own ""Ju-On"" because, quite honestly, I haven't seen a movie that creepy in a long time.  While the Japanese version has its flaws and low-budget look, the story is broken up into four parts and therefore the film is much easier to follow.  I know for a fact if I hadn't already seen ""Ju-On"" the ""The Grudge"" would have been more than a little confusing with its non-linear plotting and scenes from the first version that are inexplicably left out of ""The Grudge."".  ""The Grudge"" is less effective than ""Ju-On"" for the simple reason that is has a little too much Hollywood in it.  The ending in ""The Grudge"" is Hollywood Horror slop, while the ending in ""Ju-On"" is more ominous and eerie, as if to say ""this evil cannot be stopped no matter what you do or where you hide.""  However, there were some moments in ""The Grudge"" that were chilling and creepy, regardless.  Remember, I've already seen this story twice going in and I just wanted a comparison between the two films.  I still got chills watching ""The Grudge.""  Most of the great sound-effects from the first film are used again here, but there was an over-use of the score which frequently ruined some otherwise scary scenes reducing them to shock-tactics.  For instance, in ""Ju-On"" a young woman enters a quiet room with no music playing in the film when a cat screeches suddenly.  In my head, I was in the room with that character at that moment and I got a thrill without the score giving me notice beforehand.  In ""The Grudge"" the music is used too often at the wrong times to ""enhance"" a scary moment before it even happens and the illusion is weakened.  Another thing about this version that makes little sense is that there certainly seem to be a lot of Americans entering and/or contacting this residence in Tokyo, Japan.  I saw more caucasian characters in this film set in Japan than I saw Japanese characters.  It was certainly admirable of Executive Producer Sam Raimi to try and bring ""Ju-On"" to the American masses; and while ""The Grudge"" does succeed now and again at invoking terror, it does not live up to the original film overall.  In the end, the trappings of Hollywood Horror that are connected to this version make it less interesting to watch than its Japanese counterpart.",1108080000,3,2480,4.679723502304148
29640,4,0767827759,"This movie was undoubtedly quite creepy, and had some positive fear-producing features that few or no other films possess. For example, the film had a neat scene where a man is watching a security camera tape in which an entity forms a few feet away from the camera and then advances until its eyes appear right in front of the screen. Another good part is when a jaw is found in a cellar and a man confronts the girl who has lost the jaw. The only negative factors in my opinion were that the acting was generally kind of lousy, and that the movie ended on such an undecided note (the creature's face being zoomed in on). Regardless, though, this movie is definitely to be classified as a thriller and I would recommend it highly.",1107993600,,731,4.4222222222222225

29642,3,0767827759,"Remakes have been done time and time again, let's face it. But it seems kind of rare for a film to actually be re-created by the original director and have almost shot-for-shot imagery from the original. And so it is with the Grudge, an american production shot in Japan with the original director of Ju-On, where the source comes from. While it seems kind of creepy, it was kind of bad bordering on stale.

As we're told in the beginning, if a person dies in the grip of a powerful emotion, then it'll bring a curse on whoever comes near and consume them. So in this case, it's a house, anyone who sets foot in a japanese house is basically haunted by these 2 kids: Toshio, a kid who can screech like a cat which borders on irritating than scary and Kayako, a teenage girl who has this weird vocal thing going on.

The story is told very non-linear(chronologically) so we start with the death of a character than go to a character's rendezvous with the curse in the house. Then jump into the past for more people. Then back to present and we actually uncover why the curse started and what drove the first character's death and we also get the end of the present's story at the same time.

As for the ""scares"", they're not really that scary. The best scares always comes when it seems like there's nothing on screen then there is. A lot of these you can actually pinpoint before they happen like the attic scare or the under the covers ones. But in a scene that almost seems straight out of the Ring, one of the girls appears in a surveillance video seemingly coming out of the ground. That was more creepy than it's ""jumps""(although to be honest, when you see the end of the tape, it got ruined for me).

The performances as you can expect are average. Nothing completely inspired but at least they do a good job at getting the images across. Rent it for your date and see if they'll get scared but you'll probably be creeped out less than the date, if they get freaked out at all.",1107907200,2,1983,4.365853658536586

I cannot remember a movie that has freaked me out more and left me afraid to get up at night to go to the bathroom. I knew that ""she"" and the little boy were just waiting for me. The sounds and visuals are fantastic and overly effective, so much so that it still stays with me even months after seeing the film. This was a great horror movie and one that, because of the scares, I will not have the nerve to even watch again anytime soon. Even the TV ads for it bother me.

You really never see the ""grudges"" face besides as a woman who looks simialr to the lady in the ring and as a little boy (who is the scariest part of the movie--he is definately creepy!)  Over-all I was relunctant to see this movie at the theaters because of people either really loving it or hating it so I waited until video and I will say that I liked it for a creepy supsense plot not as a great horror film--as many are trying to make it.

There is something so powerfully frightening within the sounds and images of this movie.  It makes perfect sence to me that some of the characters were literally frightened to death by the presence of these ghosts.  I'm 30 years old, and after seeing this film for the first time, I felt like I was 5 again.  For weeks my imagination was creating ""her"" in the shadows at night.  ""She"" was under my bed...in my closet...in my attic...waiting.  I could sense her staring at me, unblinking while I tried to fall into a fitful sleep.  I could almost hear that gutteral croak, like a crushed windpipe gasping for air.  I was so certain, in that space between being asleep and being awake, that I could sense someone, something, slowly crawling across the floor toward my bed as if it's spine were broken.  And all I could do was lie there, unmoving, and tell myself ""it's only a movie.  it's only a movie.""

It's obviously not for everyone, but for those who are willing to allow it ""inside"", The Grudge is one HELL of a Horror movie that will stay with you day and night.  But especially at night.",1107907200,6,1219,4.536697247706422

Everytime at every scene that had someone alone you knew something was going to pop up and kill the person. I just got sick of seeing things pop up after every scene. I didn't even have a second to figure out the story line because i was interupted every 8 seconds because something new would pop out. That stupid little girl that had some broncitus or throat disease got on my nerves within eight minutes of the film, and the little kid in the movie was nothing but a disturbed little boy who needed much attention. If i were you, who ever is reading this or wants to see this movie, i recommend you rent it and decide on your own. i was disaspointed becuase it was presented as a Pathetic Teen Movie. If you thought American Pie is your favorite movie which is pathetic than you will think this movie is your god, because thats how horrible and  mediocre this film is. Its boring, and it lacks orginality. The girl constantly killing people at will gave me the impression that the filmmakers wanted to make a film out of the life story of Aileen Wuornos, that girl in the movie ""Monster"". But this time she just kills random people because they set there foot in her doorway.....lame...... I expected better from Sam Riami. Yet he is still a good director and this is just one of his flops. Well every director has at least one flop on their resume, excpet for Martin Scorcese. I would say not one of his films are a flop. O and do not bother watching Ju-On its exactly the same thing without the CGI evil girl. Instead a girl with make up which looks more real was protraying the whatever girl she is. i just call her the evil girl........",1107820800,3,1821,4.371681415929204
29647,2,0767827759,"What is it with remakes lately? Is Hollywood completely out of fresh new ideas? True, we get a good remake once in a while (Dawn of the Dead being a very good one, The Ring being a decent one), but more often than not, the films are just badly done. Especially when remaking good asian horror flicks.

Not that the original Grudge was all that great. But at least that one displayed a few very memorable scares. This new remake, starring Sarah Michelle Gellar as a nurse working for a family in Tokyo in a house that just happens to be haunted, offers no scare, no thrills. No images that will come back to haunt your dreams. No silly jumps or scare. Nothing.

It's hard to see such a good cast trapped in such a horridly boring flick. We've come to expect much more of young actors like Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr and Clea DuVall. This cast had a great potential. So why does the movie fizzle like it does?

Well, a lot has to do with the film's structure. True, it's fun to catch a flick that does not have a linear structure, but such a movie needs to be well planned and thought out. The Grudge is so disjointed and so freely moves back and forth in time that it becomes a headache for the viewer. And the fact that every new section is seperated by a few seconds of darkness ruins whatever suspense had been built up to that point.

I was expecting much more from The Grudge, especially when considering the people involved in front and behind the camera (Sam Raimi being one of the producers). The movie is just long-winded and badly constructed. Let's hope that the next hoard of remakes coming our way will be better than this one!",1107734400,3,1649,4.361563517915309
29648,3,0767827759,"Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie the Grudge. I actually was surprised because I thought this movie wouldn't be that good. Yet Gellar actually did not do too bad of a job. But this movie is not neccessarily meant for adults. I mean, the special effects for one thing were not spectacular. Like The Ring, the effects were indeed creepy but not great. The plot is all right but at the end it gets shady, and the ending itself was kind of a cliff- hanger and I'm one of those viewers whom don't like cliff- hanger endings that much. If you start a story, you should end it as well in my opinion. Overall it is meant to be a teen thriller, one that does not have great talent and special effects but of average quality like they use in teen filcks. And there were one or two other questions they wouldn't answer exactly. It wasn't exactly a mature film. But nonetheless I would recommend it for a night when you just want to relax and get creeped out, because indeed you will. So I give it three stars as a fun horror movie, not great, but not at all horrible either.

I don't want to give anything away so I will merely say that The Grudge is about Karen, an exchange student (Gellar) whom is working in Tokyo, Japan as a house nurse to a sick old woman, and soon she figures out there is something wrong with the house. Something very wrong. Go check it out and see what the problem is...it's not a leaky faucet, I can tell you that much.",1107734400,2,1440,4.217391304347826
29649,5,0767827759,"Ok, so it's obvious that this flick wouldn't recieve nominations, but let's face it; this is a great horror film. While most American horror for the last 10 years or so has gone for a cheap pseudo comical approach with actors delivering pointless and stupid one-liners, or the action/horror approach with leather clad babes toting ridiculously huge guns, this film (directed by a Japanese) leaves out all of what makes modern American horror films worthless and trite and injects it with some nightmarishly grotesque images and utter creepiness. Finally a movie that grasps what it means to be a HORROR movie. It's probably the scariest mainstream film I've seen in a very long time. Much better than The Ring. That movie left me bitterly disappointed and feeling like I was cheated. For all it's hype, I found the Ring to be downright lame. In The Grudge there is a certain element of ambiguity which might confuse some viewers. One thing that came to mind is why does the ghost of the young boy screech like a cat? The only clue is that we see his cat drowned in the bath tub along with him. It's just something to chew on, and it gives the film a definite surreal element. The ending was very satisfying and left me feeling stimulated rather than let down. There are far too many supernatural thrillers that end on a conventinal and almost ""hallmark-ish"" note. It's much scarier when what is going on is not fully explained.

Overall, an impressive little horror movie which I can say, truly creeped me out. I'm very interested in seeing the original Ju-On as well for comparison.",1107734400,5,1583,4.714801444043322

29651,4,0767827759,"I'm getting sick and tired of people not realizing how ""The Grudge"" made it as the title.  ""This movie blows, and what was the grudge?""  Come on people, because of the wife's mysterious love for Bill Pullman's character, her husband held this grudge against her, and was so disappointed, he decided to kill his entire family... even the cat.

  Anyways, on with my review.  I would give this a 5 star rating, but I was a little disappointed that they left out some of the reasoning behind why the boy screeched like a cat, or why the ghost decided to attack Matthew's sister, while she was at work and at home.  They said that the ghost's would stay in that house with it's rage, and I'm sure we could use our imagination and say ""oh, well... maybe if they see the ghost's eyes, it'll go for them wherever they are"", but... Matthew's sister NEVER came into contact with any of the ghosts, yes she was in the house, but so was all of the detectives, shouldn't they have been haunted too?

  About the boy, I was a bit confused when first witnessing him scream like a cat.  I didn't understand it, and the only thing that helped me understand were the ""Behind The Grudge"" featurettes.  Now, in one of the featurettes, they talk about how it is believed in Japan, that when two living creatures die together (the boy and his pet cat), they become one, but couldn't they have explained that in the movie?

  This movie was nothing like ""The Ring"".  Matter of fact, if I remember correctly, Ebert and Roeper, how however you spell their names, gave ""The Ring"" a decent rating, while giving ""The Grudge"" a bad one.  Well The Grudge by far had a more unique way of pulling you in the story, instead of right off the bat in The Ring, you figure out by watching a video tape, it was going to ruin your life, which was really cheesy to me, but all in all The Ring, I did like.  Now The Grudge explains right off the bat, before the story even starts, the motive to the story, but instead giving you more and more details, you're pretty much there with the actors, having to witness all of this madness, without knowing the answers, until Sarah's character gets the gift of seeing how it all began.

  By far, this movie was really great production wise, and I recommend it to anyone who has got a great imagination, and a love for thrills.  And when you are done, watch the featurettes, you'll be glad you did, it'll make you want to watch it all over again.",1107648000,3,2448,4.381374722838138
29652,1,0767827759,"Last evening I had the major disappointment of viewing this so-called horror movie, and it was way more HORRIBLE than horror. The only ""scary"" part was some weird sound that came out of the ""ghosts"" mouth - sort of like a frog croaking. I was scared alright - scared that the sad actors playing the roles of the ghosts were perhaps in need of medical attention. The entire movie was a bore, had no real storyline that made any sense whatsoever, the acting was mediocre at best, and it was hard to follow. It seemed to go backwards in time and then forward, and in either tense, it was difficult to follow. Perhaps in Japan it was considered scary, and if so maybe in that culture scary would be some freak who kills his wife and kid when he discovers his wife has a schoolgirl crush on her teacher, and then the freak/coward hangs himself. The untimely death of the wife and child then causes them to become freaky ghosts- the wife, who is a contorsionist, slithering down stairs like a snake, croaks like a frog, with stringy hair and bloodshot eyes, and the son looking deathly pale except for black eyeliner around his eyes and instead of croaking, he screeches like a cat. It then appeared that the authorities (ie. police), knew about the weird goings-on in the ""haunted house"", so in that case, why not demolish it. It was a pathetic, ugly house in the first place, so seeing that murders took place in it, just knock it down and go on with life. Instead of being afraid of the odd ghosts, the rest of the cast who were supposed to be scared to death or near-death should have just had a good laugh into their croaking and screeching faces, and then maybe the ghosts would realize how ridiculous they were, and just go away. The ending left me feeling empty as I had no idea why the police and medical personel would allow Karen into a morgue to what? see her dead boyfriend on a slab ??? , and since that was the case, why leave her alone in the morgue after she just went through such a tramatic experience in the haunted ugly house ??? Oh and lo and behold, just who materializes behind her but old bloodshot eyes herself complete with that ""scary"" croak voice. I still don't know what the Grudge is, and maybe Ju-on means grudge in Japanese, even so, did the ghosts have a grudge on whoever entered their house??? Terrible, terrible movie that deserves ZERO stars !!! Please don't waste a dime on this waste of time !",1107648000,5,2427,4.431767337807607
29653,1,0767827759,"THE GRUDGE was predictable and trite with the scariest thing about this movie being Sarah Michelle Geller's acting.  The ghosts, as the movie progressed, took on an almost silly feel.  I half expected a bathroom scene with one of them jumping out of the toilet!

Add to all of the nonsense the fact that the viewer can never quite figure out what the ghost does to people.  Does it suck out all of your air? Does it eat part of your face off and leave you a wandering zombie? Does it breathe on you after a lunch of really strong garlic bread and onion rings? Or does it just have a really big frog in its throat and is frantically begging for someone to perform the Heimlich maneuver?

At least in THE RING the demon's doings were consistently evil. I can't wait for the satires and parodies on this one.  The filmmakers should have a total heyday!

It was too simple, not worthy of the rest of this grotesque theatre-experience (as in seen-before in weaker b-movies). It takes away one star, but the important thing is that the little silly ending was scary too.

Other than that The Grudge is a masterpiece if only because it works that way as a Horror(!)-movie.

By that I mean: Forget Sixth Sence, The Others and other so-called movies of this ""Horror""-category -Sixth sence and The others are of course more intelligent (I find them both as Five-stars-movies) than The Ring & Grudge, they contain better plots (and perhaps actors and camera-work) - but they can't be compared to the ""fear-factor"" of the new horror wave coming this way!

This went beyond my expectations and had some genuinely frightening moments--no thanks to the lead performances of ""who again?"" Hollywood nonentities like Sarah Michelle Gellar or Bill Pullman.  Not even frightening moments exactly, frightening sequences, like when Matthew's sister is essentially tortured psychologically till she's sucked under the bed by that blue chick who crawls like she's really angry and really handicapped.

This is a scary movie to a considerable degree.  Yeah, it's derivative, and yeah, they use the blue chick too much.  But there are some scary moments, and like the other reviewer said, it beats crap like Seed of Chucky.  Worth a rental.",1107561600,,875,5.034722222222222
29660,2,0767827759,"This is a movie about two little ghosts who burp at you until you kill yourself or fall into a coma or lose your jaw so that your tongue hangs down like a necktie.

Little Brother ghost and Little Sister ghost (actually Mommy Ghost but who cares?) are the victims of a murder-suicide. This fact is obscured by the much more pungent fact that they are victims of Genre. The director's insulated obsession with horror films has him forcing the Sibling Spooks to burp their way across town, up elevator shafts, down stairwells, through cell phones and even once in the window reflection of a public transit vehicle.

Their bad manners are not the only shenanigans the poor devils are forced to perform. They are both made to alternate between ""hiding under the bed"" and ""hiding in the attic"" - both being locations in which their prey never fail to fatally discover them. They are forced to wear large amounts of eyeliner and white foundation which they must remove and reapply instantly - and Spooky Sis is required to keep her hair carefully covering her face and to move with jerky motions in order to imitate the director's favorite spook from a different movie - The Ring.

Even though Sis can turn herself into smoke she is still forced to crawl downstairs - because... well because crawling is spookier than walking. I guess. Also, they both have a thing for ""opening their eyes *suddenly*."" Sis is also known for manipulating the electric circuitry of an apartment surveillance camera. Their only handicap - like a cat forced to wear a bell around its neck our two mini-spooks are required to gastro-intestinally announce their approach upon their victims. This gives the victims time to be ""horrified"" before their jaw falls off or they go catatonic.

The director's task was to take this entire situation and make it scary - no easy feat considering how goofy it is. The Genre Beast forces our director to replace substance with style: film coloring, ""spooky"" soundtrack music, a pseudo-intellectual achronological sequence and stupid flat characters who walk backwards into haunted rooms.

Being an American remake DVD release allows fans to say things like ""It wasn't as good as Ju-on!"" or ""Wait until the unedited directors cut comes out!"" and other booby-prize slogans (which, incidentally, obtain their purchase by referencing the same external  environment upon which this review is based and for which this review will be criticized.) Viewers whose horror-film expectations have been groomed by decades of incestual inter-genre self-referencing may find something good in The Grudge. Who knows?",1107561600,6,2608,5.011547344110855
29661,4,0767827759,"Nasty spirits must have a corner on the Japanese housing market. How else to describe the lovely home this evil spirit occupies in ""The Grudge""? Sarah Michelle Gellar stars as Karen Davis a nurse living in Japan who provides care for those who require assisted living. This spooky ghost story scared up a hefty profit when it opened. It appears that grudges pay off for director Takashi Shimizu as this is his third or fourth remake of the same film. Luckily, the American remake refines the scares that made the Japanese theatrical hit such a big draw both overseas and even in the US. Keep in mind this is a suspenseful ghost story not a gore fest so don't expect a lot of blood and guts because that's not what this is all about (although it does have its moments). Top notch performances from the cast including Bill Pullman and Sarah Michelle Gellar help create a convincing, tense atmospheric thriller. While this has been Americanized for its audience, Takashi Shimizu's direction remains sharp and he refines his film making it a powerful, spooky thriller,

 A top notch transfer from Columbia highlights this terrific DVD. The colors are vivid and bright capturing the lovely, ghostly look of the original theatrical release perfectly. The 5.1 mix uses the format extremely well with nice imaging, sound and depth. The ethereal sound mix perfectly matches the tone and texture of the visual images.

 We get a five part documentary on the making of the movie. Sam Raimi (Darkman, Spiderman, Spiderman 2, Evil Dead, A Simple Plan, Army of Darkness) discusses his interest in the film and the cast including Bill Pullman and Sarah Michelle Gellar discuss what drew them to this ghost story. All comment on the stylish direction, the inspiration from Japanese folklore and its impact on the story. Screenwriter Susco discusses how he honed the original Japanese story and repackaged it for an American sensibility without losing what made the original so special. Director Shimizu discusses (via subtitles) how he crafted the story for a very different audience. Covering everything from the Myth of the Ju-On (the power of a woman's rage) to the culture shock the American cast faced making the movie.

Under the Skin focuses not on what scares us but why we like to be scared. Joseph LeDoux a psychiatric professor and author discusses how viewing other people being threatened gives us the adrenaline rush that the characters feel without the threat of actual danger. Using footage from the film along with footage of LeDoux, this featurette doesn't tell us something we don't already know but confirms why we react the way we do to horror films, urban myths and stories. We also get a humber of previews from forthcoming Columbia releases.

As usual Sam Raimi, Ted Raimi, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Robert Tapert, Clea  DuVall, Kadee Strickland, Stephen Susco all combine their talents for an informative, funny (and occasionally annoying) commentary track. They clearly are having such a good time doing the commentary track that even the annoying moments when they indulge themselves a bit too much are fun to listen to at least the first time.

An unusual scary ghost story ""The Grudge"" will keep you on the edge of your seat. Well made, acted and produced the DVD looks exceptionally good. The extras include a comprehensive documentary on the making of the movie and a featurette on why we like fear in movies (and ghost stories).

I really like the fact that this movie was made by a director (writer) with enough guts to create a film that did not force a typical Hollywood ending on the viewer.  Yeah, I myself probably would have enjoyed a storybook ending, but I was indeed surprised by this one.

I think the movie has some of the best visuals for a horror flick in quite some time.  I also think that this is the major goal of the director - make them remember the scene and that the scene was shocking to them.  I think that happens quite a bit in this film.  I wanted to see ""what would happen next"" from beginning to end.  In my book, that is a sign of a good movie.  I didn't want to go get popcorn or a Pepsi.  I wanted to watch.

The other core audience are movie viewers whose favorite movies are movies dramas and comedies and decide to see a horror movie ""once in awhile"". Obviously the sight of some kid who pops up every 25 mins to make a funny sound will scare them. I just kept thinking it looked like something out of a Bill Cosby Puddin Pop commercial and the kid was hungry. Also, the kids were TOO similar to characters from The Ring.

29666,2,0767827759,I had great expectations for this film but was sorely disappointed. The story jumps time periods frantically that you never really get attached to the plot. The story is also a bit vague. The actors are poorly cast (sorry SMG) with Grace Zabriskie giving the only inspiring performance (as per usual) as a bed ridden invalid...and that ain't saying much. What was up with the frog noises? How did all these Americans end up in Japan and find such bad luck? The film requires an extreme suspension of disbelief that just leaves the viewer bored.,1107388800,3,544,4.7368421052631575
29667,4,0767827759,"I really don't know what Roger ""Popcorn"" Ebert was thinking

when he gave a thumbs down, perhaps he was watching this Movie

upside down and actually did give it a thumbs up, well either

that or he was actually pointing to the barrel of popcorn for

more butter and people were like ""it's official"".

Anyways if you like horror/terror Movies you must buy this, i was

not going to buy this film after hearing so many people tear on

it in the reviews i was going to rent it but when i got to the

store i forgot my blockbuster card and decided to buy it.

I don't regret it at all in fact i had originally intended on buying it

and then i heard people bashing it in the reviews and was like uh..

oh well ill just rent it. Worked out.

People in the reviews made it seem like the whole Movie was chopped

into so many little pieces it confuses the storyline. I expected this

but its not what happened. There are some backdrop story arcs that

illustrate how and why everything is happening and it happens around

four or five times total not endlessly like the people were saying.

I jept waiting for it to happen and was suprised to find out i was

actually still watching and following the Movie. Ya all it was was

some backdrop. No time shifting, no trying to make it seem super brilliant

because someone wanted to hold this Movie up and above all others

and make a complex storyline, this is not that Movie or the motive.

This Movie was so fun to watch, people berated this film about

predictability and lack of originality, instead for some

reason acting like this did not involve people above the age of 13.

It simply was not true, i mean i read a lot of reviews and once

i was done i had realised it was not the producer or director

who had ruined the film it was what people wrote about it that

made it seem this way.

Let me just say this again if you like horror your going to love this

one.

Do you know who sam raimi is? (Well in a nutshell although yes he famous

for directing spider man now.) Sam Raimi is the person who created wrote

and directed the Evil Dead Movies. He believed in the originality of

the original (Ju-on a japanese horror film) so much that he actually financed

it so we americans could have the opportunity to see it.

Do you think this Movie would actually as some put it ""suck"" if

Sam beleived in it enough to do this. (ANYWAYS)

This Movie is set in Japan. Ive heard crtics say that it had more

american actors than asian? Wrong Dead wrong. All the backdrop, the

setting is set and filmed in Japan. They made it sound so awfull

but you see its not. There are actors of both nationality, including

a cool detective. I really was intriged enough to want to see

the original.

Although a Producers role is usually a role of finance, casting and

set i cannot help to think that Sam Had some influence on This brilliant

Director Takashi Shimizu. Sam Raimi is so cool he was on the Commentaries

along with SARAH MICHELLE by the way, i heard he spoke of a directors cut

to be released a few months later. Thanks to him the director was able

to become more flexible because of a more substantial budget!

This Movie flies if you as me. Its so original, was it scary yes

at times it was so creepy i found myself tensing. Some of the stuff

is very mind jarring the director is so smart its like they said

in the special features, its the kind of fear the director executes

that makes you challenge the innocence of even being alone in the room

with a little kid or a even a cat for instance. The

Director/creator pulls and plays with the minds most primitave fears.

Youll see. Now graphically it was not a slugfest but when you knew

the one of the creepy characters were coming you were simply

drawn into the creepiness. It had it share of special effects.

It like if something was after you and you didn't know what it was,

and then you caught a glimpse and knew and were scared as hell.

Glad to give a few seconds to give my review and dispell some of

the myths. All the actors were great, people looked really horrorfied

after ""they has seen"" what was up.

Oh that reminds me a lot of people said this is just like The Ring

well i saw The Ring and this is not The Ring its called the grude

and although i have not seen The Ring in a couple of years i simply

do not see the comparison. Generally they both did have that ""sort""

of creepiness that edge to it. By the way the story not only makes

sense it is also a very interesting one. Its not ""Some guy dies in

a rage and everyone who comes in contact with the undying hate becomes

a victim. I hope you see it soon! Cant wait for the Directors Cut.",1107388800,7,4678,4.205649717514124
29668,5,0767827759,"Since I was young I've been a huge fan of Horror films.  When I first started watching them, I enjoyed the gory yet dull ones.  But as I grew I started wanting to feel more suspense.  I wanted to be scared, disturbed and shocked; not entertained.  But in the last 10 to 15 years there haven't been many.  Not since the late 70's and early eighties has America released many truly frightening films.  Not films filled with gore and cursing, but movies that have such a disturbing, surreal feeling to them, that you can't help but sleep with the light on and the door locked.  Thank heavens for Japanese Horror.  Without it, I seriously doubt horror would be around now. It gave us ""Ringu"" which was americanized (very well I might add) into ""The Ring.""

And now with Shimizu-san's ""The Grudge"" (a remake of his hit film, ""Ju-On: The Grudge"")horror is finally stepping into the forefront, and letting the world see that gore, cursing and violence don't make a movie.

""The Grudge"" is not ""scary"" per say.  It has the over done 1 second shocks. You know when the creepy music plays and a cat jumps out at you.  Yet, these shocks are like none you have ever seen.  In most horror films, these shocks are last minute additions to get some sort of emotion out of the audience.  In ""The Grudge"" they push and continue the story.  Yes, unlike many people say, this film DOES HAVE A STORY.  It fleshes out the age old japanese folklore story of souls who are killed in the midst of a rage, and continue ""living"" by feeding on the fear and the rage that the living feel around them.  Many people see that this film is a group effort on the casts part.  You have no real lead; all though Karen (Sarah Michelle Geller) comes close.  So, yes; there is no real person the cling to.  The real stars are the spirits; and who wants to cling to them as an emotional path.  The story is played out non sequentailly.  There are characters alive 45 minutes in who you saw die or disappear at the beginning.  This film stucture lets the audiance piece the film together themselves. (Yes, the film actually makes you think)  The atmosphere and the sounds are what will get you.  Not while watching the film, but later when your at home reading a book at 11:30.  The way the film is almost washed in gray(The ghosts are gray.  The clothing worn by the cast are dull grays, browns, creams and blacks) gives the film a dream like quality.  And the claustrophobic sets give you a sense of no place safe to hide (the bed sequence, terrifying.)

But what really gets you, are the sounds, not the score, even though it is creepy.  The sounds that the lead ghost make will haunt you for days on end, even during the day at work.  What really sells the film is the lack of gore and language.  I don't remember hearing one curse word, and there is only one scene of true gore.  The gore of this movie is the atmosphere that creeps into you from the VERY ORIGINAL opening credit sequence to the cliffhanger ending!  Not a film to watch alone.

So if you want to see a horror film that gives you a lasting sense of dread, ""The Grudge"" is definitely for you.  If you want a movie filled with action, gore and cursing go rent a Friday the 13th film, cause this Grudge is for the 21st century.",1107388800,5,3255,4.375626043405676

and the gore and violence is absent from the film... maybe they just wanted it to be one of those ""jump scared and grab you date"" movie.... they still did a great job doing that... most movies cant do that right (for example WHITE NOISE.... just terrible).

It was just a series of bad things happening. It did not seem to matter if the characters were courageous or ingenious. It did not matter if they ran from the problems or faced them - there was no hope.

Second - the flashbacks were badly done - it was never clear whether you were looking at past or present, and the plot was a hairball.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1107388800,3,533,3.9626168224299065
29671,3,0767827759,"The grudge is the American remake of the Japanese movie Ju-On and like most remakes it isn't as good. The movie does have several good qualities to it. It is easier to follow than Ju-On and it is easier to keep track of who are the characters. It doesn't have the same creepy feel to it that Ju-On had and some of the jumps come off as comical instead of scary. There are a couple of good scenes that will make you jump in your seat, and it isn't a waste of money to rent or even buy it. Sarah Michelle Gellar is good in the movie, but nothing to write home about. Overall, I would say that if you haven't seen Ju-On then you will like the Grudge. If you have seen Ju-On, then the movie seems more like a pale comparison rather than original. It is a fun movie and not as violent as Ju-On, which I believe was rated R, but it never really gets into your head the way Ju-On managed to creep you out. If you compare it to The Ring (another American remake), it doesn't stand too well because The Ring was able to live up to the original. Still, I would recommend the movie if you want something to watch late at night, with the doors locked and a big bowl of popcorn. It is worth renting while Ju-On is worth buying.",1107388800,2,1214,4.083682008368201
29672,2,0767827759,"There was nothing worth noting in this film, and no reason to go out of your way to see it.

In order for a horror movie to work it needs at least one of the following:
1) Actual scares.
2) Gore/interesting deaths.
3) Characters you either fear for or identify with.
4) Interesting sets.
5) Tension regarding whether a character lives or dies.

This film had none of the above. There were no scares. There was no gore. The characters had no depth and no personality. The set was a typical Japanese home with no character.  There was no tension, as you could flawlessly predict whether someone would live or die.  Never once did you feel tension towards their outcome, and never did you care, as they were cardboard, anyway.

The movie begins with promise. The colors and angles will feel familiar if you saw the Ring, but it begins with promise, giving a mysterious death and a very creepy child.

It doesn't last, though. You soon realize that the deaths happen off camera and are usually unexplained. You realize the main ghost is a very confused looking Japanese woman with a facial expression that is supposed to be terror but is so over the top it's pure humor. And you'll realize the characters have no purpose other than to die. None of them say anything interesting, none have any unique characteristics. You could take the lines from one mouth and put them in another without noticing.

*minor spoiler* The end is terrible, too. The ghost gets a character face to face, inches away, but saves the character instead of killing the character. Of course, this doesn't stop the ghost from stalking the character and giving the ""surprise"" in the end. Why didn't it just kill the character when it had the chance? *end spoiler*

A movie with a decent concept but terrible, dull, and mindless execution. There's nothing confusing, nothing mysterious, nothing disturbing, nothing scary, nothing intelligent, and mostly nothing interesting to be seen in this movie.",1107388800,2,1965,4.792899408284024
29673,4,0767827759,"Despite the $39 million that ""The Grudge"" earned in its opening weekend to make it the #1 film in the nation, I had low expectations when I popped this DVD in to watch.  This was because my youngest daughter had rushed out to see the film (because it had Sarah Michelle Gellar a.k.a. ""Buffy the Vampire"" in it) and she was bitterly disappointed.  While I would not trust her opinion as to what is a great movie (she loves ""Gone With the Wind"" but does not get ""The Godfather""), I thought she would know what was a bad horror movie.  Consequently, I think my expectations for ""The Grudge"" were so low that there was nowhere to go but up once I actually watched it.

I knew this 2004 horror film was a remake of the Japanese movie ""Ju-on,"" in the tradition of ""Ringu""/""The Ring,"" but I did not know that it was filmed in Japan by the same director, Takashi Shimizu (I tend to avoid finding out a lot about films until I actually see them so that I be pure of mind when I first watch them).  This makes a big difference because the idea behind this production is behind both the strengths and the weaknesses of ""The Grudge"" as a film.  However, since I lived in Japan for a couple of years, have enjoyed Japanese films in general and ""Spirited Away"" in particular, and have an ability to understand non-linear narrative forms, I have to admit that I have a peculiar position from which to view the film (so take what follows with a grain of salt).

As the opening of the film explains, ""When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is born.  The curse gathers in that place of death.  Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury.""  When you listen to the DVD extras you learn that there is another key ingredient: the source of that rage is that the victim does not know why they were murdered.  This is important because this is not your typical American horror movie where the guilty die grizzly deaths.  The innocent are the only items on the menu this time around.  If you want other clear indications that this is a Japanese horror movie then notice that Shimizu goes for the creeps over suspense (guessing who is next to die is never difficult), the camera never lingers on the film's grossest images, and seeing the ghost happens early and often.  The last one presents the most problems in terms of cultural translation because the Japanese conception of demons is so foreign to American audiences (I know, duh, but it is true) as is the idea of a Japanese monster house (""Obakeyashiki"").

Executive producer Sam Raimi had seen ""Ju-on"" and came up with the idea of remaking the movie in Japan with the same director but with American actors for an English speaking audience.  So this is not the same thing as splicing in scenes of Raymond Burr to turn ""Gojira"" into ""Godzilla,"" but it is somewhat pointed in that same direction.  Stephen Susco's screenplay has to come up with reasons why the American actors are working (and dying) in Japan and while he certainly comes up with plausible means of employment, there is an elephant in the living room in that the body count consists mostly of gaijin but that is never a part of the equation.  Granted, Detective Nakagawa (Ryo Ishibashi) is suspicious of the house given what had happened three years earlier, but this film really needed to deal with the gaijin issue better (I was going to say that having more Japanese killed off in the movie would help, but then we have the problem a gaijin being the heroine in a story set in Japan).

However, at some point a decision was made for Jeff Betancourt  to edit ""The Grudge"" in a non-linear fashion.  Now, what they came up with is an interesting approach, but clearly most viewers are not picking up on what is happening right away.  Beginning with the opening deaths before the title credits are over, ""The Grudge"" follows the first death backwards to the beginning of the tale and the second forward to the ending.  These two plotlines alternate to the climax in which they actually come together.  Unfortunately, this is just way too convenient as the only way that our heroine can understand what is going on.  At a point where the puzzle is coming together we are wondering how this is happening when the focus should be on understanding why everything is happening.

Another way in which the production is more interesting than the movie is the limited use of CGI.  Throughout the commentary track, Gellar talks about the lengths to which Japanese filmmakers keep things real.  The shot of the hand coming out of the back of her character's head in the shower is not a CGI shot.  The ghost creepily crawling down the stairs is all the performance of actress Takako Fuji and not a puppet on wires or anything else.  When characters listen to messages on an answering machine, there are actually messages on the answering machine.  But, again, unless you check out the DVD extras you have no way of appreciating the realism of this particular movie.  The more you check out the more you will rethink what is going on in the movie.

""The Grudge"" is a creepy movie where the ghost is a lot more interesting than Karen the heroine.  But then most of the characters are simply in the wrong place at the wrong time so that bad things can happen to them.  Still, my wife screamed twice and jumped three times while watching this, so it can have the desired effect (at least on those unaccustomed to the way modern horror films work).  More importantly, the attempt to make a Japanese horror movie for Americans, versus an American version of a Japanese horror movie, is worth paying attention to.  Ultimately, I am trying to convince you to watch this movie twice, after checking out all of the DVD features in between.",1107388800,163,5741,4.555014605647517

First I'm a big horror fan and I mean all kind of horror movies.

I wanted to like this movie, because i've seen Ju-On in a festival 2 years ago and it was weak. I mean, a kid with a cheap white make-up, weak storyline and pace, very boring. And please stop to compare it to The Ring or Ringu.(These 2 movies are good exemple of great horror movies)

And The Remake, yes the remake, just a little better cheap white make-up. Directed by the same guy, it'S almost the same movie, it'S in the same house, same kid,same story, same pace, but for this time, good special effects. Not even close to the Ring, that was a scary and very well directed movie,+ great visuals.

And for the acting? We can say it'S okay.

To be honest, I don't really understand why so much peoples find this movie very scary, like the scariest they've seen in years. The only creepy and good moment of the film is at the end, the scene in the stairs. (won'T spoil it)

People, wait for The ring 2, because if it'S good as Ringu 2 (I've seen it couple years ago in a festival) that'S gonna be scary!",1107388800,,1112,4.197183098591549

In the beginning all that happens is a couple different people in different places get so scared that they become speechless. Some seem to have been scared to death. I actually just made the movie sound better than it is. It's not a good horror movie. You can't gather up a bunch of frightening images and call it a horror movie. I was very disappointed, I feel that most others might also be disappointed.

Think again. Turned out to be a joke of a horror film - an utter waste of time. Maybe the big screen, the dark theater, being at the late show at night, and perhaps the full moon and high tides had something to do with how they felt about ""The Grudge"". For me, this movie was slow, predictable, and down-right disappointing. I don't always need blood and guts in my HORROR movies, but sometimes it sure helps. Ask me what I think a classic scary/horror movie is and I'll respond with ""The Exercist"", ""Halloween"", ""Psycho"", ""Nightmare On Elm Street"", ""When A Stranger Calls"", ""Final Destination"", or any of the old classic Vincent Price films from 30-40 years ago. ""The Grudge"" being an (Asian) horror classic? Give me a break - this kind of innocent suspenseful horror is weak in my book. Watch this movie and tell me your horrified of the little white-faced kid with the shiney black balloon in his mouth. It just wasn't scary! To top it off, director Shimizu felt this movie was so good - he imported half a dozen American actors to make a 2nd (U.S.) version. The first version being ""Ju-on""... also a major disappointment. The two movies are 90% the same... with the exception of the American actors. The same house is used, as is the same sister's apartment, the care center, grocery store, elevator, not to mention script and plot. There is no soundtrack to speak of throughout the movie. The director relies on objects jumping in front of the screen at just the right time accompanied by screeching violins. Sarah ""Buffy"" Michelle Gellar (""Scooby Doo"", ""Cruel Intentions"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"") continues her roll of choosing below average scripts. Bill Pullman (""While You Were Sleeping"", ""Casper"", ""Newsies"", ""Spy Games"", ""Independence Day"", ""Lake Placid"") on the other hand, is distinguished as a leading 2nd man... and I was disappointed at his role here (very little dialogue and screen time).

The movie in a nutshell:

Bill Pullman jumps to his death in the beginning, reasons unknown as to why. Then the girl Yoko who is the old ladies caretaker comes upon the ghostlike boy and cat and she gets yanked into the attic. So now Sarah Michelle Gellar is a substitute for Yoko because the agency she works for thinks Yoko is sick because they can't get a hold of her. So Sarah goes to the house and does the cleaning routine and she hears a banging/meowing noise so she investigates and finds a taped up wall. She rips it open and there is the boy with his cat again. She leaves because the cat is growling at her and goes back to doing chores. Then the boy is at the top of the stairs and so on. So, Sarah goes back to check on the woman, and she is talking to someone. She goes into her room and sees her staring at something and asks her what and she replies ""I just want her to leave me alone"", then tucks her into bed. She looks up into the corner and sees this black shadow octopus looking thing and she sits in the corner with a look of fear in her face. The police come and investigate and find two corpses which were the married couple, the son of the old woman, and a human jaw. (They both die from the little ghost boy.) In the end it turns out that the little boys mother had a crush on Bill Pullman and he didn't know, and her husband killed her son and her in a jealous rage and then himself, and Bill Pullman came upon them and then he killed himself the next day.

I expected gore..what I got was far more sinister...the terror was subtle,yet had shocking impact..I use to think the scariest thing to see on my doorstep at 3 am was a clown..now im fairly scared of small pale Japanese boys who give off bad vibes..the scene before the final climax...Jeeeeeeez...there would be no final scene if I was in the film..call me dead of a coronary and thats a wrap...as for Ms Geller's performance...stellar...Stellar Geller...gave you the impression that if this film were real...shed be a permanent resident of a mental ward..however..to me..the big letdown of the movie was the end....but then again..it also left your mind wandering how far her depths of insanity would go...my husbands final statement upon seeing the final scene wrap up..*why does she NOT just turn around and jack slap her...C'MON BUFFY!* Apparently he now knows how to scare me in the middle of the night... the guttaral noise heard throughout the movie...I highly recommend this movie...made The Ring look a lil silly and the lil girl in that movie look almost pleasent..heh!",1107216000,3,1861,4.81875
29684,3,0767827759,"Having seen ""The Grudge"" in its ""theatrical release,"" I immediately played this DVD with the overlapping ""commentary"" feature because I wanted to hear the participants' input.  Towards the end, Sam Raimi reveals that a ""director's cut"" may/will be released a couple of months after this initial release.  That not-here version will apparently include 3 more minutes of horror, shock, and gore, but will delete the rooftop scene in which the main detective explains to Sarah Michelle Gellar's character the mystical/spiritual basis for what's happening.  We are told that the detective's explanation, which isn't all that complicated or helpful anyway, would be superfluous to the Japanese audience, which is (say the cast and crew) already accustomed to...well, actually I wonder.  Am I to understand that EVERYONE in Japan expects that when an awful murder happens in a house, future residents should expect to be killed by their ghosts?  No wonder the realtor in this movie kept quiet about the dysfunctional bathtub.

Anyway, if you're wild about this movie you may want to hold out for a couple of months before buying this version.  I went for a certain national chain's promotion and got this DVD along with the Japanese version, ""Ju-On,"" as a package deal.  I haven't watched that yet, but Sam, Sarah, and company said that the rooftop scene isn't in ""Ju-On"" either.

Clearly I also disagree with Roger Ebert's one-star lambasting of ""The Grudge,"" not only because I am a big fan of Ms. Gellar but because I found the pacing, camera shots, sets, and the music appropriately chilling.  For me, the nonsequential depiction of some events effectively built the suspense.  I usually agree with Roger, but I don't understand why he thought the plot didn't tie together.  (He also complained about the preponderance of hair dangling throughout the movie.  That gave me something else to watch for, a little inside joke with myself while the rest of the audience was gasping and screaming.)

If you can accept the admittedly suspect premise that ""[w]hen someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is left behind"" (it's on the box; I didn't memorize it, whattaya think, I'm a fanatic?)...oh, and you like lots of mysterious ghoulish death, you will enjoy ""The Grudge.""",1107216000,3,2276,5.034666666666666
29685,4,0767827759,"""The Grudge"" is not a great horror film, but it is pretty good. The scares are pretty predictable, but they still made me jump at times. When you watch it, keep in mind the non-linear timeline--the film starts out in the middle of the story, and subsequent scenes alternate between past and future. I mention this because I thought it was a bit confusing at first to see someone who was in mortal danger in one scene appear alive and kicking in the next. The DVD has some pretty interesting special features--the ""Making Of"" featurettes include some of the mythology behind ""The Grudge"", which helped clarify some things. Fans of ""The Ring"" will probably like this movie. It's definitely worth a rental.",1107216000,,703,4.770491803278689
29686,4,0767827759,"Ok, the only reason I gave it only 4, and not 5 stars, was that it scared the pants off me. I had a hard time sleeping that night, after watching it. And to tell you the truth, I'm surprised I didn't have nightmares from it. I jumped for days after, just hearing a cat meow. My friend at work said that he took the nightlite out of his baby's room, and slept with it in his, after seeing that movie, and I don't blame him.

That freaked me out.

But overall, great movie, but I'd probably not see it again, just because it is so scary, even though I now know the movie.",1107216000,2,569,3.982456140350877
29687,4,0767827759,"People were not impressed with the idea of well respected Japanese horror films crossing seas and being Americanized. Or Hollywoodized. But things changed with the success of ""The Ring"" and how good it was. Now with this latest American re-do of a Japanese horror film called ""Ju-On"", the concept of re-making these foreign films for American audiences continues it's welcomed translation into another solid piece of spooky chills and thrills. It may not grow in stature as ""The Ring"", but this film can be as equally chilling in spots. One of the main reasons that this tale and the movie works is that it is not entirely American. It is shot in Tokyo, with a lot of it's natives behind the scenes, and in front of the camera. The original director, Takashi Shimizu, is also on board directing this new version of his original film. To make it more accessible, Sarah Michelle Geller, Bill Pullman, Jason Behr, and a few others, are thrown into the mix. Sarah Michelle stars in her first feature film since the end of ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"", and she seems to be able to make the transition from TV queen to silver screen scream queen with little effort. She just works. She stars as Karen, an American student who is wokring for a care house for credit. She is living in Tokyo with her boyfriend Doug(Behr, from TV's ""Roswell"", who had also co-starred with Sarah in a season 2 episode of ""Buffy"" as well). When a care worker goes missing, after a spooky opening, Karen is given her job. To care for a sick old lady in a weird house that gives off one major bad vibe. Karen immediatley begins having weird feelings when she arrives at the house. Things are just not right. From here on out, events occur, people die, and Karen tries to figure out exactly what happened in that house and how to save herself from being sucked into the house's previous owners' deadly grip. As it goes, when someone dies in a kind of fury or rage, their spirits are left behind to carry out a curse to whoever enters. It's a pretty interesting premise that mostly works. It may brings up some questions that never really get answered, but we don't neccessarily watch these movies for that, do we?. The movie is shot well, and it really uses every area and nook and cranny they got to the fullest effect. They definitley create an ominous and scary feel and look. The movie itself is definitley a spine tingler. It has many scenes that are well structured to the point of being genuinley creepy and scary. A rare feat in today's climate of expected ""jump scares"". The cast is pretty good too. Sarah, thru her years on ""Buffy"", has proven to be an exceptional actress. This is her area, and she knows how to work it. Despite looking as lovely as usual, she is a fine horror actress and does the most with what she can with what is essentially a typical heroine role. She is good, but the character could of been better expanded on for her. Bill Pullman has a fairly small role, mostly seen in flashbacks. Jason Behr as Doug was basically wasted in a pretty transparent role. He really had nothing going on with the character. I guess other ones and situations came first. The movie is different in that it takes it's time creating the backstory for the bloody mystery, and how the current situation Karen and others are in came to be. Taking away from Sarah and the others. It is interesting how it is done. Not a bloody film at all, ""The Grudge"" is supposed to work on suspense and fear. And it pretty much succeeds. It would of been better if the characters were fleshed out more, and were as interesting as the spooks and chills, of which there is a fair amount to make this movie a worthy contender for a night of scary fun.",1107216000,3,3710,4.505934718100891
29688,3,0767827759,"its only fair by comparing to ""the ring"". ""the ring"" is more of an ""action package"", it has a decent linear story line. This one plays nonlinearly which is just like other people would discribe it, a serie of events played side by side. Be honest, I've seen a bunch of these movies and they hardly concentrate my emotion into one. It's the kindda question u ask yourself whether 1+1+1=3, does simple math really work that way in cinematics. The scary moments appears on and on occasionally, but they've ordered in a way at the end I would feel like what I've been watched are a bunch creepy clips with special effect that don't necessary lined up together. I've watched the original on DVD when it comes out first before this one. I didn't even like the original, this one's actually better in terms of technical achievement. What I think is the writer really sold out after the success of the massive first hit of ""the ring"" (second note, the ring 2 original isn't any better than the first either), sadly, but I guess its too much to ask the same person to be brilliant twice if not even more.",1107216000,,1095,4.48
29689,1,0767827759,"The Grudge plays exactly how a horror film should. An orchestrated series of incidents coupled with a protagonist who's trying to get to the bottom of things. Following the cult success of the much talked-about (but pretty lackluster) The Ring, this is another Japan-originated production which has made its way to Western shores. Does it keep afloat in the world of horror, or sink like its preceding overseas cousin? While it does have its scare attributes to contribute to its genre, The Grudge never allows its story to surpass its moments of terrifying fun, and it's a shame that the effectiveness of the so-called fun wears out almost too soon.

Although keenly reliant on story logic, the biggest problem isn't exactly a lack of horror elements or one-sided cliched characters, but that the plot progresses rather sluggishly behind a curtain of tried-and-true tactics. The truth behind the entire mystery is eventually uncovered, but a ridiculous amount of stereotypical `don't-open-that-door' type scenes overly dominates the movie, with one happening after another and another. While this sounds fitting for The Grudge, the sequence of events become all too predictable and repetitive to a point you know the film is trying to prepare more scares. The split-second frights are especially grating after the first several attempts and serve as cheap annoying distractions while its bizarre use of telling the story at different times makes an uneven mess. By the time it ends, it feels as though the movie has exhausted itself.

On the plus side, the characters aren't the usual you would find like most of the similar kind. Expect them to be well integrated into the movie's appropriate atmosphere. Also, the film does have its moments to have you bounce in your seat and feel uneasy, and may even perhaps provide a good laugh or two. If you have yet to see any of the previous Ju-On movies, then this remade version isn't a bad place to start. In a time when horror films seem to be waning down, The Grudge could rejuvenate your interest in them once more. But others should be forewarned, since it is a pretty forgettable film after one viewing. Creepy flicks tend to leave a lasting impression long after they end, but The Grudge isn't one of them. Although it may make you jump early on, don't expect to maintain that frightened feeling for long once that same door is repeatedly being opened, over and over.",1107216000,,2420,4.91442542787286

And how is it that the aforementioned disposal lighter seems to hold a flame through the obligatory endless looking-around scene without burning the holder's fingers?  I can only hold mine for about 20 seconds before the metal parts get hot enough to cause some serious burns.  Why is it that when the intrepid hero or heroine gets no answer at the door, they just urn the knob and walk in through a door that always seems to be open? I lock my doors precisely so people can't just meander in. These movies always seem to have the obligatory tearing down of the wallpaper or, in this case, brown tape to reveal the spooky niche where something dangerous and eldritch has been placed.  Hostile black cat?  Puhllease!  Broken picture frame, one face obliterated.  Creepy kid on the second floor balcony, but she ignores him to go over and listen to an answering machine message.
