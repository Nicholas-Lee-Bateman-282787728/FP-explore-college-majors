7734727,1,B01EG1R92A,"This is another bad anthology movie created by teenagers who have no idea how to write a story.  Guy steals a book in a mortuary that has occult type stories.  He goes to a party where the book is passed from person to person as they each read a story.  That lasts about 5 minutes.  Just the right amount of time to have a complete beginning, middle, and end. Not.  Nothing makes any sense. And you won't care after you see how bad the first story is.",1483401600,,451,4.137931034482759

7734729,3,B01EG1R92A,"I love anthology films. The ability to nibble on a story here and there or slam dunk out the whole flick in one sitting. The film is told via a book being passed around at a party with odd stories in it. It was acquired by an intern at a funeral home who took it off a strange dead guy. The helper ""Jerry"" at the funeral home is a scream and warns that the dead guy is plenty creepy himself.  The stories are twisted just like you like them with an odd assortment of characters and situations. The first story has a surreal feel as we watch an a seemingly grandmother type preparing a feast for her family but the main course is far from the norm. But will her family notice. Watch with a loose attitude, yes it's an indie so you know it's not the same old same old. That's a good thing.",1479859200,,787,4.077419354838709

7734732,1,B01EG1R92A,"Expect an 11-minute wait before arriving at the first vignette in this anthology.

There was absolutely no narrative to the first ""story"". It simply shows you a situation. The End. The production (minus the acting) was very good, considering the infantile level of the script.

The second story is an improvement ov..You know what? No, it isn't! Seriously, who wrote these!? The majority of this short establishes a brief backstory for the protagonist, who gets two scenes afterwards. The End.

The third story is...Marginally less sucky than the first two. Yay? I think I just liked this monster's make-up and the hint of a Halloween theme. Pretty straight-forward: The characters discuss the monster. The monster shows up and kills them. One could sum up many horror movies this way, but then again, those movies also have story elements. What I told you just now is literally almost everything that happens in the entirety of the footage.

Guys! Hey guys! This 4th story contains a twist! No, seriously! A twist! The two (lame, but) seemingly-normal protagonists are actually murderers! This is a really great opener! The End.

I'm not going to put myself through any more of this. These are haunted house ideas, not scripts!

The production values are really good, but the literary competence of the writers is abysmal. I've read more intriguing narratives penned by 4th-graders(Sorry to throw you under the bus, 4th graders). I'm with other reviewers in the certainty that cast, crew, and friends are the only positive reviews.

7734740,4,B01EG1R92A,"Review-Kirk finds this mysterious book at his funeral home job. He decides to bring this book to a party he is going to after work. The book has several stories that it seems the person who reads the stories, sort of witnesses firsthand happening. The first story involves a older couple. On the surface, they seem like your ordinary everyday couple. Till we find out, that they eat human parts. The next short is about this business woman who people view as cold blooded and cruel. We find out that she has a son that she keeps hidden in a cage. The third short, involves two guys who hear about the legend of this scarecrow. It seems that this legend, roams right where they are working at. The next story, centers on two hitmen who seem to love conversation more than killing. The next short, involves a couple. The guy is an avid horror fan, the female not so much. In fact, when she watches a horror film, it scares her so much that she is paranoid for days. Well, her boyfriend wants to break her of this habit. The next short, involves a bad break up between Freddie and Heather. Heather decides with her roommate to go on a girls night out. The problem is there is a psycho clown who is hunting them down in their own house.

The next short, involves Larry who has this very odd job. His boss finds a way when the job cannot be done right, to punish him. This punishment may or may not include a so called sedative in a locked room with his son. The next short, involves a woman named Alison. She is driving and almost runs over a girl. She stops to see, the girl is covered in blood. So, she takes her to a nearby neighbors house to try and get the ambulance out there to help her. Our last short, involves the pregnant Emily. She is broke and ran out of gas. She meets a stranger who offers to take her in and help her out. Come to find out, the stranger is more obsessed with wanting what is inside Emily, than helping. Dreadtime Stories is a fun little anthology film. The shorts range from 7 minutes to 12. For the low budget this film has, it really pulled off, something worth bragging about. This shows you exactly, what a little bit of imagination and a passion for horror can do. Like most low budget anthologies, there are some misses. The thing is, the misses in this film were not that off mark. Some of the shorts on here, clearly show that the director wanted to go outside the box. I can honestly say, from first to last short, this is a must have. If you are a horror fan and want something that respects you, this film does. The shorts really showcase what we all love about horror. The shorts also have dark tones and sinister outcomes to most, that as a fan we love to hear. My advice, seek this film out and be prepared to have a blast.",1472342400,,2765,4.266666666666667

7734764,1,B01EG1R92A,"Please take note that all the positive reviews either mention the Director by name or the media company involved and how they ""look forward to seeing more from this company.""

Advice to the shills: If you want a review to appear remotely objective, don't wave the fanboy banner so obviously.

I've seen a lot of indie films...many of them horror. This is right up there with the absolute worst of them all. In any aspect which a film can be measured as bad, this has it - acting, directing, editing and, especially in this case, screenwriting. I actually felt embarrassed watching this the same way I feel embarrassed for a journalist doing an interview while walking next to the interviewee...and then tripping on camera.",1469577600,8,722,4.814516129032258

7734766,4,B01EG1R92A,"I have a soft spot for good storytelling that's also a labor of love.

7734769,1,B01EG1R92A,"One of the good things about this movie(perhaps the only good thing about this movie) is that it eventually ends. Unfortunately, like myself, you may not be able to watch it that long and will thus deprive yourself of its one redeeming value.
The acting is horrible enough to make you either cringe or laugh and the script might have been hastily written by a high school drop out.
I wouldn't have bothered with the review but the 5 star reviews that this film received really irked me. They must have been submitted by the actors, producers, their friends or it is the reviewers desire to submit you to the same awful fate they were subjected to.",1469491200,,647,4.538461538461538

7734772,1,B01EG1R92A,"Amazon Prime has a ton of truly bad horror movies available on Prime (I'm looking at you, ""Dracula's Angel"").  Unfortunately, I've seen many of them trying to find a few gems in the rough.  Gave this one a shot because the rating was pretty high (which it turns out has obviously been  manipulated by bogus reviews)... but ""Dreadtime Stories"" turned out to be a laborious, amateurish, painful waste of time.

About those ratings.  Read through the ratings, notably the 5-star ratings.  You'll notice that they're all short, most mention the ""awesome"" acting, cast, local talent, story etc.  An unusual amount mention STX media.  They've all been posted within a couple of days between each other, July 9-11.  OBVIOUSLY, these are either cast members (John Gonzalez, maybe?), crew, friends, STX staff, family or mailing list fans.  Anyone non-connected viewer who watched the movie would give this a 2-star at best, and that's being generous (IMDB currently has it at 4.8/10).  It's really despicable that they would organize this level of review manipulation.  The reviews are so hilariously out of touch with the film that reading them is probably more entertaining than the movie itself.

As for the movie itself, I was willing to like it if it delivered.  But the acting is amateurish for the most part, with a few performances better than the rest.  The stories are weak and disjointed... it got tedious about 2/3 of the way through.  And the anthology aspect really doesn't work at all... it's pretty laughable, actually.  There are no scares, no horror, and even accounting for the supposedly low budget, not much to get excited over.  I guess if you're okay with community college level films, you'll be okay with this... if you expect more, do yourself a favor and skip ""Dreadtime Stories"".",1469232000,34,1798,4.956521739130435
7734773,1,B01EG1R92A,"I love B-movies, they usually have humor and when in the horror genre you get that feeling they are trying to shoot for an A movie but really just don't have the budget. Some of the biggest stars in Hollywood have gotten there start in B-movies, and after watching one you can sometimes tell that a particular actor will be successful, This is not a B-movie.... this Is a C movie... which stands for Crud.. or if you don't mind a little harsh language, Crap!  No redeeming qualities, the actors would not even be asked to work In a B-movie, the humor and horror are not there, and anyone including myself could  do a better job of directing, starring, and editing a horror film.
Also another sign of a C-movie is when the reviews are all really high because the people who made the film or were in it are the reviewers..
Nice try... get a life and please don't quit your day job, or please get one if your going to make another C-movie....",1469145600,7,939,4.36
7734774,1,B01EG1R92A,"Considering that a $2k budget usually means borrowed equipment, shot in your house, with your friends filling in as 'talent'; not a bad start to a film career.
By conventional standards, Dreadtime Stories is unwatchable.  I only forced myself to finish it as a perspective on independent film making.
The individual stories have no development, reason, or impact on the rest of the movie.  The acting is stiff and unnatural.  The actors always looked like they were waiting for their line.  Much of the dialogue outright didn't follow.  A lot of shots in already short scenes felt like filler.  A couple of tales were almost effective until a shyamalan-esque 'twist' ruined the mood.

In addition to the horrible production quality, not a single one of the ""stories"" is the least bit clever or interesting.  Each ""story"" follows the same pattern:  1) Introduce character, 2) Character gets slaughtered for no discernible reason.  The only thing worse than these ""stories"" is the unbearable over-arching ""story"" that attempts to tie them together.

8758532,1,B01EG1R92A,"Amateur night, kids. Just hammy and lame. They basically shot this with a camcorder and couldn't even figure out the proper interlacing for this so every shot's a double exposure. Love how the director Jacob Grim gives himself a credit as the DP, which means ""point  handheld camera at actor and don't use any lights.""",1537401600,,318,4.781818181818182
8758533,1,B01EG1R92A,"What's this movie like? Every story I watched (eventually I couldn't take it any more and gave up) went something like this....

""Have you heard about the snot monster?""

""The snot monster?""

""Yeah, the snot monster!""

""That sounds stupid!""

""You'll see! (Leaves)

The snot monster shows up and kills the other guy and then they go to the next story.

It's like they wanted to make a horror movie, but stole all their plot ideas from campfire stories told by small children.

In other words, this movie is an abomination, so proceed at your own risk and don't say that I didn't warn you.",1527984000,,587,4.576923076923077

At any rate, I enjoyed most of this film but felt it could easily by shorter and many of the segments were overly long (how long do I need to see the woman chop vegetables, for example). These things get boring fast. Maybe more stories could have helped (shortening some considerably) or more details or action in the current stories. Anyway, give it a watch. You might like it. You can always FF you know.",1491782400,,521,4.612903225806452
