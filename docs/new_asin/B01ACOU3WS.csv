8747072,5,B01ACOU3WS,"I fell in love with this movie after we saw it in the theater back in 1985 or so. At the time it was magical cutting edge German cinema that transported you to a different world. The charactors were clearly and realistically defined and the environs creatively displayed and lit. Another cool thing about this wonderful film is that you can mention it to anyone and probably be assured that no one has ever heard of it much less seen it. Much like The Music of Chance! And Choose Me is another that comes to mind.
I recall being captivated by a glimpse into another world in addition to being surprised by so many twists in the story and the surprise ending.
I wonder is this DVD will play in region 1 players?
I'd love to see it again, and wish there was another way than YouTube.",1521244800,,781,4.319727891156463
