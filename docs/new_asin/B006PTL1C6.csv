The totally unknown Rex Ray stars in THE UNKNOWN RANGER (1920), a fitting role as nothing at all is known about Ray himself; birth?, death?, nothing except that he starred in this film and one other, DANGEROUS TRAILS, same year, same cast. And as for the film itself, it's pretty good for a no-budget oater as Rex is onto smugglers (opium rather than the usual guns or cattle) around the Mexican border circa 1920, cars and horses here. The print used is rather good, no bad splices or scratches and the title cards appear original. The music track fits the story line and isn't just some record thrown on for sound. The location shooting is outstanding, especially as Rex chases bad guy Ben Hill over some rugged mountainous terrain. If anyone out there is reading this and may know where this film was shot please comment as I'd like to know.

The second Rex is the wonder horse. More is known about this Rex as he appeared in several films both silent and sound, and sometimes teamed up with Rin Tin Tin in Mascot serials. Veteran actor Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams is a young man here in one of his earliest films (1925). This is more of a heart warming family type film as Rex and Guinn (Jim Lawson) end up saving each other as well as overcoming their enemies and winning their sweethearts. This is a very enjoyable film with an exciting action climax that actually had me on the edge of my seat.
BLACK CYCLONE is available from other sources as well as APLHA, and though the print here is somewhat worn the film is very watchable with clear image. ""Big Boy"" Williams went on to play in many Westerns throughout his long career, the last couple being John Wayne's THE ALAMO and THE COMMANCHEROS where he plays the McBain character that Wayne impersonates when he hooks up with Lee Marvin (Crow).

A super great buy at Alpha's bargain price, I really enjoyed both films, especially getting a chance to view the historically important THE UNKNOWN RANGER. This is a recommended purchase for all Western fans.",1389398400,2,2047,4.605479452054794
