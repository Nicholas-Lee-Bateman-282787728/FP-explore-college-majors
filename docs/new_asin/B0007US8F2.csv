8051929,2,B0007US8F2,"Dunn's books are amazing, but this material is not what was expected.  There are NO live images or footage of the Giza plateau included.  Rather, just a lecture at a small group conference.",1491782400,,189,4.696969696969697
8051930,1,B0007US8F2,Do not waste your money on this product. Christopher Dunn has a message that might be worth listening to but this product does not deliver that message.  I have a hard time understanding why he put his name of this product as it is in one word horrible. Someone needs to pay Mr Dunn a visit and show him how to market his message. I did watch the video but I will not be watching it again any time soon. Sorry for the bad review but I told the truth.,1374192000,,450,4.0
8051931,4,B0007US8F2,Pros are the presentation contains the essential information from his book which outweigh the cons. The cons are that most professionals aren't that good at making presentations. The DVD was produced a while back on older equipment which causes it to not play on a laptop. But a home theatre DVD player works quite well. Recommend his book to go with the DVD if you're really interested in the subject. Buy both!,1371686400,,412,4.736111111111111
8051932,5,B0007US8F2,"Christopher Dunn is a brilliant man who has spent decades exploring the reality of advanced technology in ancient Egypt. I really love this lecture. He goes into a thorough and detailed explanation on why he is convinced that The Great Pyramid was a power plant. If you honestly give your attention to this lecture, you can clearly see that his science and reasoning is completely sound. He doesn't just come to an arbiritary conclusion because it sounds good. He really looks bravely and thoroughly at the startling evidence that is wonderfully exciting and intellectually
stimulating, in a powerful way. We are lucky to have people like Christopher Dunn who couragously look at the clear evidence that the egyptions were highly advanceded in the distant past. Bravo!",1362700800,3,768,5.103174603174603
8051933,5,B0007US8F2,"Christopher Dunn gives one great synopsis of the information in his book which
will be a '""must buy"" if one wants to delve deeper.  His ""power plant"" theory
of the purpose of the great Pyramid of Egypt is the most cogent, reasonable and
sensible I have heard yet to date.  The DVD is a very good exposition of it.",1282262400,2,313,4.288135593220339
8051934,1,B0007US8F2,"This is not a documentary.  Its a lecture with grainy video no less.  Hes boring and goes off the subject a lot.  But thats BOTH dvds in this pack, a boring guy with a mic, talking about very boring things that don't relate to the title at all.  Dont waist your cash.",1197676800,13,267,4.076923076923077
