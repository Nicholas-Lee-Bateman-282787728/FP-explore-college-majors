8104550,3,B000E1ZB7C,"I grew up with Robotech (Because I grew up and reside in the US where Macross is a barely known entity) so while I enjoy this Macross release for what it is, ""the original"", I can't say I like it better.  I know that's probably going to receive many sour faces, but there are a lot of things that just don't quite work as well here as Robotech.  What DOES work great is the new dub work including the voice of Vic Mignogna (Edward Elric) as Rick H....Ichijo, and also the original Minmei, Mari Iljima!  That's a pretty cool little easter egg, as quite honestly her music is far less silly than Robotech's offering....that said.....I still love Robotech's Lynn Minmei songs....I am a fan.  Anyway, the background music isn't nearly icon throughout the series as Robotech, and if Robotech (and probably Macross) taught me, Music is a huge part of all things, and it changes everything.  You can notice this in comparison of the original macross (which employs silence and no narration) as supposed to Robotech's immediate Narration and music.  Robotech never lets up on the music, and I think it works better for that and many reasons.  But owning these simply as someone whom loves Robotech and wants to see the history behind it is enough for me.  So it's good, but not amazing.",1503446400,,1278,4.648888888888889

8104554,5,B000E1ZB7C,Was a great Anime back in the day and is classic now. I have watched this over and over and still cant get enough of this series.,1300233600,,129,3.814814814814815
8104555,5,B000E1ZB7C,"But since I grew up watching the ""Robotech"" version and loved the first part -since it wasn't the most Butchered!- so much, this intrigued me enough to find out what it really looked like. Boy I was surprised how mature the story truly was and I feel a great amount of shame in my country that wasn't grown up enough to allow this show be seen as it was.

Battlestar~""reboot"" on ""syfy""? Nothing to compare to the Epic that is Macross as a Complete Story WITHOUT the tons of angst and Emo that dripped out of that show. This had everything a Science Fiction fan would love to see. The movie made it even better, but sadly due to ownership conflicts it will never come to America.

Watch and see what a bunch of dudes who loved SCIENCE FICTION did back in the early eighties.",1262131200,,773,4.324137931034483
8104556,2,B000E1ZB7C,"This short series could have been better, I don't understand why the Japanese feel the need to have all the main characters children or little girls, Of course this is not true for Macros Plus which is one of the best animation out there, maybe it's because they left the kids at home.",1239667200,,285,4.39622641509434
8104557,2,B000E1ZB7C,"I bought the first volume + box, of the revoiced, Macross series from ADV, and was not impressed with the new choice of voice actors.

Minmay sounded too old, Misa sounded too young, Hikaru to annoying and the infamous, Bridge Bunnies, not annoying enough.

So when the newest volume came out, like a woman forgetting the pains of labour, and deciding to have another child, I stupidly plunked down my hard earned cash, and popped in the new disc...

Well, I lasted about 35 seconds with the new voice dub, before mercifully switching over to the original Japanese track (as tiny sounding as it is).

I wanted to like this new voice dub, honestly I did, but I just can't get past the fact that three of the main character voices are completely wrong for the personalities that they play.

I was really hopping that the new voices would grow on me, even reading all the reviews I could, hopping to be somehow convinced that the newer dubs where better then I thought, but alas, to no avail...

It REALLY sucks that the original voice actors from the Robotech series, didn't finish dubbing the original Macross series, but instead, after several episodes, scrapped the original version for the slightly reworked Robotech version, as that would have been amazing to have in full.

So, I'm stuck with a new ADV dub that sucks, and the old Robotech versions with cruddy picture quality (as the Robotech remastered set has been also buggered up by ADV, having great picture quality sure, but the new generic sound effects, put into the new 5.1 surround track, are as bad as the voice dubs on the new Macross set).

Gotta hand it to ADV though, as they did entice me into buying three different versions of the same series...",1143331200,9,1718,4.646864686468647
8104558,5,B000E1ZB7C,"Another great volume in the Macross series!  That, combined with a second in-depth interview with Mari Iijima just keeps the interest level high!  If you like hearing Mari as Minmay in the series, then you should also see all the rest of the wonderful things she's done by going to [...]

ADV did a great job re-doing the series, plus having it remain uncut was a wonderful way of bringing a new generation into the Macross fold, so now they can see it the way it was meant to be seen!",1142899200,,485,4.3076923076923075
8104559,5,B000E1ZB7C,"I'm still awaiting an continuity for Macross.  Sure Macross Zero is out, but that's a prequal, not a continuation.  This new release is  wonderful.  Although the second volume does not include a duel DVD set like the first one.  Although I wished that they kept all episodes on one disk and the special features in another.  The second volume is one disk, makes life easier for us lazy viewers.  They still continue the in depth interviews with Mari Iijima.  She's so wonderful in her representation as a Japanese.  Simply put as an anime fan you can simply say that Mari really truly represents the character Minmay.  Minmay is who she is because of Mari.  The second dvd set also includes a first time trailer for Southern Cross.  I love the Japanese adaptation, and opening theme song.  Buy this if you're a true otaku of robotech.  Buy this if you're wondering if ADV Films will perhaps put together an album for Mari's big break into the United States market.  And I hope sooner or later they'll move away from trying to call ""Macross"", ""McCross"".",1142726400,3,1052,4.672131147540983
