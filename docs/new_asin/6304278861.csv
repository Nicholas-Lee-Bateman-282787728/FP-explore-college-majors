7866976,2,6304278861,"I just could not get into the groove with this video.  I can't move like that so I didn't feel like I was getting much of a workout from it.  I enjoyed the sculpting parts best.  The backdrop is pretty boring too.  And the way the instructor kept saying, ""I'm right here with you"" made me wonder if she thought I was insecure to do this on my own.  It gets annoying after awhile.",1172448000,,379,4.0675675675675675
7866977,5,6304278861,"I love this workout, especially on those days when I'm not feeling not quite so enthusiastic. Kacy's energy and joy are contagious, and she looks so athletic and strong, it makes me want to workout to get my body looking like hers!

This isn't the hardest workout I own, but you can modify to use her ""energy"" moves more to up the cardio. Advanced exercisers would probably find it too easy to get them really working, but may enjoy it for a change of pace - her flowing, grooving moves are great and really get you to enjoy your body.

The seated cool-down is an interesting but effective change.

I hope Kacy makes more workouts, and soon!",1112054400,2,641,4.461538461538462
7866978,5,6304278861,"This is a great video-she alternates 5 minute segments of aerobic and body sculpting moves.  If you use this tape three times a week, you will see results.  I went from a size 40 waist in pants to a 36 in a month and a half.  You may want to alternate this tape with Kacy's other, ""The Lucky Vanous Workout.""  Though it has his name, she is the chief architect behind that tape.",1069804800,,378,4.136986301369863
7866979,5,6304278861,This morning was my first time doing this workout and I loved it!  Some mornings I just dread working out but this was such a fun workout that I actually enjoyed doing it. I have many exercise videos and this was one of the most enjoyable.  It will be in heavy rotation.  I wish Kacy would come out with others.  I highly recommend this very enjoyable and effective routine.,1047945600,2,374,4.3768115942028984
7866980,5,6304278861,"I just finished this tape, and I am looking forward to doing it again tomorrow. As a person who has not always found exercise easy, this tape makes exercising a pleasure  and not a chore. As Kacy states, ""Exercise shouldn't be a chore. It should be a joy. Honor yourself."" Plus it was refreshing to see a woman of color leading the video without being bubbly -- Kacy is definitely a winner! I highly recommend this tape for anyone who wants to get back into shape or those looking for a fun and effective workout-- either way, you sweat!",1030406400,,537,4.424242424242424
7866981,5,6304278861,"I really did not know what to expect from this video, because I never worked out with Kacy Duke before.  I must say it was a very nice change from all of the choppy workouts from other tapes I've used.  I was able to flow with her through this workout, like she said 'natural moves'.  Before I knew it, I was perspiring and it was time to strech.  The stretches were really refreshing.  This is definetly a workout that you can get in to. I'm looking forward to more workouts from her.  Try it you'll like it.

7866982,5,6304278861,Wonderful tape easy to get in the spirit of fitness with this video & I wish more were like it.  The music is really good and the instructor is really motivational with out being artificially bubbly while comming at you like a locamotive.  This tape is good for the begginer or you can add weights for a harder workout.  The tape alternates 5 min. of fun arobics with 5 min. of toning.,970790400,6,385,4.319444444444445
7866983,4,6304278861,I hate to exercise but this video made me feel like I was in an African dance class.  It seemed like pleasure not work but I could feel my body getting more toned and leaner with each workout.  The music is great to  because the drumming really got me motivated and inspired.  The dance-ike  moves were unique but not too hard I could not keep up.  It really wa pure  joy.  It's a tape that makes exercise something I can stick to.  I  alternate with other exercise videos I have so I won't get bored.,963878400,7,501,4.178947368421053
