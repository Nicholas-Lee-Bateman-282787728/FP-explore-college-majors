8724281,4,B011IEW6HQ,Enjoyed this movie. A lot of twist with them doing a play and real life. Stick with it even if it seems slow cause it's quite a story. Do wish Amazon would get more of them.,1465430400,2,173,3.8333333333333335
8724282,2,B011IEW6HQ,"A famous actress Miyuki Goto is the lead in a new play based on the ghost story Yotsuya Kaidan. She pulls some strings to get her lover Kosuke Hasegawa, a relatively unknown actor, as the main male lead. When the film starts, it's clear that Kosuke is losing interest and sleeping with other women. He's presumably keeping up the charade to keep his role in the play, which is a sad story about a lazy, lying samurai who kills a woman's father to marry her, gets her pregnant, and then continues to be lazy and unsatisfied with married life with little money. A rich young girl wants to marry him and he poisons his wife and squalling, who then haunt him. In real life, their lives reflect the play (without the murder and the child) with some added weirdness.

I went into the film with no expectations and it's an interesting quasi-ghost story with typical Miike twistedness and flair. The visuals in the film, especially the parts at the play, are absolutely gorgeous with a Miike edge. I liked exploring both sides of the story in the play and outside of it. The story in the play is quite tragic and at times brutal to watch. I would have loved to see the play because it had excellent production value and incredibly detailed backgrounds on a giant rotating stage. The samurai character is abusive to his wife and those scenes are hard to watch, especially while the wife agrees that everything is her fault and she should be better.

Outside of the play, Miyuki knows something is amiss with her relationship and she spends most of her time at home alone, waiting for Kosuke to come home. I wanted to like Miyuki, but she completely revolved around Kosuke. After a while, she was convinced she was pregnant with his child (I guess to trap him into staying?) and she wanted to induce labor in one of the most stomach turning ways possible, especially since it was concretely confirmed that she wasn't pregnant in the first place. Almost all of the female characters revolve around this one horrible man. It made those women into flat, stock characters with no other motivations or goals. Overall, Over Your Dead Body is another creepy addition to Miike's ouvre, but most of the characters are quite flat. There were also some loose ends and missed opportunities that could have made the film even creepier.",1461715200,,2312,4.65036674816626
8724283,5,B011IEW6HQ,Really enjoyed this movie.  The visuals are quite good and the movie does have an option for English audio and subtitles.,1453939200,2,121,4.761904761904762
8724284,2,B011IEW6HQ,"Like another reviewer said, no english subs. Somewhat disappointing considering I'm a Miike fan who spent the money to rent this. Not sure what to rate the film itself considering I haven't yet watched it.",1452556800,2,205,4.885714285714286
8724285,4,B011IEW6HQ,"Miyuki Goto (Ko Shibasaki)  stars in a play on a revolving stage. Her lesser known co-star is her boyfriend (Ebiz Ichikawa). The play is about a samurai who murders his non-approving prospective father-in-law to marry his daughter. They have a child. He is unemployed and is offered work by a rich man on the condition he marries his 16 year old daughter. This has issues, but the rich man assures him things will work out honorably.

As life imitates art, Miyuki has trouble separating her real life from the play. The first hour of the film is psychological drama, establishing the scene for the weird stuff in the final half hour or so, including an intense shower scene that made me cringe.

There is a gold fish that appears in a tank always at the edge seemingly wanting to get out. I think it is symbolic of Miyuki's issue with life or else the director's little girl wanted her goldfish in the film.

Guide: No swearing. Brief sex. Brief rape. No nudity or swearing. Blood and an unrealistic dismemberment scene. English subtitles in DVD.  3 1/2 stars",1452384000,3,1059,4.641711229946524
8724286,1,B011IEW6HQ,"Do not rent if you don't understand Japanese, as there are no subtitles. Sucks, cuz i really wanted to see this movie.",1452211200,5,118,4.409090909090909
8724287,5,B011IEW6HQ,"Over Your Dead Body is a powerful, atmospheric, nuanced psychological thriller which will leave you wondering, much like the characters in the film, what is really happening and what is not.

It is also another directorial tour de force from versatile Takashi Miike, who has the ability to deliver films which are out there and at the same time the most mainstream of movies. This movie is somewhere in the middle, on the one hand a mainstream thriller and on the other containing elements of nonlinear surrealism, to great effect.

The movie concerns a group of actors involved in a traditional Kaidan (ghost) stage production. The lead actress lusts after a young inexperienced actor and the other actors in the production lust after the lead actress. The backstage drama mixes with the drama on stage, and the drama on stage mingles with the backstage drama, not once, but throughout the movie. The forced intervention of life and art is not benign but lead to mental torment, doubt and more.

The movie is perhaps mistitled. The original title for this movie is Kuime, to which there is no direct English equivalent, but is roughly translated as the woman who devours flesh.  An allusion to the Kaidan subject matter of the stage production in the movie, it also accurately characterizes the lead actress, who has a voracious appetite for love, possession and control. She is no simple Cougar by any measure.

There are many parts of the story which are genuinely creepy. There are times when the story moves too slow, but this only adds to the sense of danger. The overall effect of the movie will stay with you for days.",1451260800,8,1626,4.792857142857143
