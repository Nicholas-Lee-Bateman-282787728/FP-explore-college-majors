Some of the best known and most popular television programs of all time have found their way onto CLASSIC FAMILY TV. This collection features 30 episodes of both sitcoms and sketch comedy programs, highlighting the golden age of network television in the 1950s and 1960s. Included are a number of productions of the Desilu Studio, the first major television production company. MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY, aka THE DANNY THOMAS SHOW was Desilu's first major hit and guest star Andy Griffith was soon given his own show, THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW. Also featured is the later Desilu hit, THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW. CLASSIC FAMILY TV also has episodes of THE BETTY WHITE SHOW and one of the longest running sitcoms of all time, the famed ADVENTURES OF OZZIE AND HARRIET. With Ozzie Nelson and his real life wife and two sons starring, OZZIE AND HARRIET is in many ways a predecessor to current reality television shows like THE OSBORNES. CLASSIC FAMILY TV is a nostalgic trip down television's memory lane, as well as a neat history of programming in the network era.",1151539200,27,1501,4.8046875
