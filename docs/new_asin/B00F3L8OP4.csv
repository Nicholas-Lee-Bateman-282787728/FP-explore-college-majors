As I write this it is still ""out of stock"".  Unfortunately, this ""replacement"" has the identical defect...

Makes us wonder if we were sent the same dvd back, or does the master have this defect and nobody is paying any attention to the reason something gets returned.

5966266,5,B00F3L8OP4,"""Silent Night"" (2002) 1.33:1 [original full frame]
Starring Linda Hamilton, Matthew Harbour, Romano Orzari
This Christmas story contains a few corpses; violence; and suspense
I'd NOT recommend for children under twelve-years-old.
Based on actual 1944 war-torn Germany events. It's about a strong,
courageous, mother that takes the ultimate risk; turning enemies
into friends on a special Christmas Eve.
______________________________________________________
""A Christmas Memory""(1997)1.33:1 [full frame]
Starting Patty Duke, Piper Laurie, Jeffrey DeMunn
The second, Inspirational, Hallmark Channel Christmas Story is suitable
for your entire family!
From a Truman Capote's Christmas story. Seven-year-old Buddy has
a new home and a new family when his parents drop him off with distant
relatives in a town with no other boys his age. He becomes close with
Sook (a simple-minded woman). Before long, they find themselves on
one amazing adventure after another, proving that friendship is the
greatest gift of all.
It has a sad ending with their separation.

""Angel of Pennsylvania Ave"" (1996) 1.78:1 Anamorphic-Widescreen
Starring Diana Scarwid, Robert Urich, Tegan Moss
The third, Inspirational, Hallmark Channel Christmas Story is suitable for
the entire family!
Three children are determined to get their, innocent, father out of jail in
time for Christmas. They board a train ticketless; hop a freight train; be-
friend a hobo; a puppeteer; and hitchhike the rest of the way to D.C. in
search of the magical Presidential ""Wizard"" in The White House. This's
set during The Great Depression. This tender tale contains likable char-
acters based on actual events during The Hoover Administration, with
only ""Keystone Kop"" comedy when the children are chased by Security
Guards. MY favorite of the three!

5966273,5,B00F3L8OP4,I have the 20 movie set and these 3 just seen for the first time. Highly recommend all 3. Brought back memories of grandpa who lived during that time. He rode the rails for a while looking for work. Would be nice if the kids nowadays learned the events of that time in history. I listened to my elders and learned a lot about important things in life. I loved the old cars too was a treat to see them.,1424390400,,401,4.025

Okay, on to my comments on each movie in this set of three. It's interesting that the first three movies that I watched on this set of 20 just happened to be these three movies.

(I do include a few spoilers in my reviews, but not enough, in my opinion, to ruin the movie for you.)

----- THE ANGEL OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE -----

I loved this the first time I saw it, and I love it even more this time.

This is a feel-good movie that is based on a real-life incident, though I understand that the real Bernice Feagan actually took a bus from Detroit to Washington, with support from others. But it was wonderful imagining that three kids could try to travel on their own without the help.

The actual charge was different. Their father was in jail for car theft, not murder, but again, that does not detract from the movie.

What's wonderful about the movie is that it gives a fairly accurate (if dramatic fictional) look at the times, Hooverville's did exist, hobos did ride the rails, and there was an entire network of information that helped people know what R.R. stops had the worst reputations for arresting the rail-riders.

They even managed to include the dangers of hitchhiking. Don't ride with drunks, and strangers might take advantage of children (and adults) traveling alone.

I will watch this excellent movie again in years to come. It is a wonderful movie that is semi-historical both with the story and with its depression-era settings.

I give President Hoover and ""The Angel of Pennsylvania Avenue"" a grand total of FIVE GRAND GOLDEN STARS

----- A CHRISTMAS MEMORY -----

I also saw this movie some time ago. It took me awhile to get into it back then, and it took me awhile to get into it this time, but the scenes do seem to be very representative of what life was like so many years ago, in the years of Roosevelt's presidency.

Buddy is seven years old, his parents had split up and his mom had dumped Buddy with some elderly cousins long before the movie started. Those cousins are siblings who, many years before, had been raised by the oldest sister because their parents died, leaving the oldest to raise the others.

Buddy and Sook, possibly the youngest of the old siblings, probably the weakest willed of the bunch, develop a close relationship, but he is growing up. The domineering oldest sister rules the roost and decides that Buddy must go to Military School, but while all of this is going on, Buddy and Sook enjoy their adventures, including visiting a prohibition era joint to get one very important ingredient for her fruitcakes. Sook makes mistakes, but Buddy thrives, and develops a friendship with a girl in the area.

Along the way, we see how the community members do help each other, like the postal clerk who tells Sook that the amount of postage that she is short will just be covered by one of her fruitcakes.

I'd like to say that the oldest rode a bit too roughshod over her siblings, but it might have been better in the long run. The movie ends as Buddy gets on the bus to go to Military School.

It is a compliment to Patty Duke that I did not realize that she played this character until afterward, when I saw her name on the box.

I do understand that Buddy's story might be based, in part, on real life, but unlike ""The Angel of Pennsylvania Avenue"", I do not know the details. You might look up ""Capote"" and this title for more information.

I will watch this movie again, and I'm torn between giving it four or five stars, so let me call it 4.5 stars.

----- SILENT NIGHT -----

This movie starts out slowly, but we quickly find out that this mother and son must deal with soldiers from both sides in 1940's World War Two Germany. The mother manages to enforce a Christmas Eve peace between both sides, surprisingly by first convincing both sides that they can leave their weapons outside. Yes, they do have problems once in awhile, including a misunderstanding based on one of the American soldiers having a German Iron Cross in his possessions, which insults the German soldier who thought he'd taken it from a dead soldier.

Some reviewers hate the fact that the soldiers did share some wine or other drinks, but we have to remember that in those years, alcohol did show up in the battlefields. Even in M*A*S*H, we see how often soldiers enjoy their libations. In a way, the film might have seemed fake had the alcohol not been included. I did not think it was overbearing.

This film is based loosely on actual WW2 incidents, but even if it is very loosely done, I still enjoy this movie tremendously. I did see this movie some years ago but it was just as enjoyable this time.

----- CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION -----

I highly recommend these movies, but rather than ordering this set, I suggest that you buy the 20-movie set, also available on Amazon:

While perhaps a little ""slow"" compared to modern fair, I will definitely watch 2 of the 3 movies each Christmas season.  A Christmas Memory is a real tear jerker, very touching close relationship between old and young.  Pa. Angel is an eye opener into the desperate plight of those unemployed through no fault of their own.
