Leonard Maltin speaks about Hollywood actors and peoples opinions. John Wayne made what he did look easy or natural. His first big movie was Stagecoach in 1939 (he made many Westerns before this). Westerns are folklore, simple stories. William S. Hart was the first Western star. Duke went to USC and worked as a property man and extra. Raoul Walsh named him John Wayne for The Big Trail (his name was Marion Morrison). He took whatever work he could get in movies and gained experience in low-budget movies and serials. He had a screen presence that the audience favored. John was Singing Sandy, a singing cowboy (his voice was doubled). [The sound of a human voice calms cattle. Thats why they play radios in cow barns.]

Wayne worked with Yakima Canutt, an extra and stunt man. Fight scenes were staged, stuntmen replaced valuable stars in their action films. Movies were made in a week working from sun up to sun down. [Note those seeming accurate snap shots.] There were other cowboy stars (Buck Jones, Tim McCoy, Kermit Maynard, etc.) but John Wayne was better looking. Gene Autry tells about his past. Westward Ho had big action scenes. They tell about The Three Mesquiteers movies. These were morality plays where the good guys won at the end. This gave hope to people who suffered from the economic depression of the 1930s. John Ford worked with John Wayne for forty years. Stagecoach featured characterization as well as action; it made Wayne into a Hollywood star. He branched out into other characters in other movies, and he became one of Americas favorite movie actors.

A written biography will contain more information. Mike Tomkies biography says John Wayne was a football hero and honor student in high school. He applied to Annapolis but was rejected, then got a football scholarship at USC. An injury ended that, he found a job as a property man for a movie studio. Since he could ride a horse he became an extra in Westerns. His personality made him promotable (with the right friends). In his early Westerns John played an undercover investigator for Washington or Sacramento who worked to help small ranchers and homesteaders from being dispossessed by a big landowner or cattle baron. In time Waynes political opinions agreed with the powers that produced his movies and controlled his career. Change is the only constant in real life.",1432771200,,2382,4.8765432098765435
