8260613,5,B001608ZXC,This item is a great collectible if you can find one in pristine condition at a reasonable price.  Nice presentation of a very worthwhile and needful DVD set.  The old Popeye cartoons are just wonderful and provide hours of entertainment for all ages... Seriously!,1403481600,,264,4.9772727272727275
8260614,5,B001608ZXC,"I love collecting classic cartoons on DVD and since I already own Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volumes 1-6, Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection Volumes 1-3, and Droopy I figured I would add Popeye to my collection. I first looked at the cardboard case set and saw I could buy it for $10 from Amazon Marketplace. While I was looking at this item I notice an image for an exclusive collector tin. I thought I would check this out, I am happy I did. First, I had problems when I tried ordering it from one seller, but I cleared that up and got it from a different seller. If you want to know more about the Popeye set visit the cardboard set and read other reviews. This set is exactly like the cardboard set except it has a tin case it sets in. The top separates from the bottom and the DVD set sets nicely inside. The back of the tin has an image of Popeye walking and the sides have the DVD information printed on it. I think it is neat and cool!",1267056000,2,947,4.180327868852459
