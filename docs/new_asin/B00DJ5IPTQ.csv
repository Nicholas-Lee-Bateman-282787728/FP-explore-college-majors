5819382,3,B00DJ5IPTQ,"First off, if you love harems, bare boobs, panty-shots and the like, this show has plenty of all.  Watch it.  For the rest...

We Without Wings is an anime adaptation of an H-game by Navel.  Personally, I'm not a much of a fan of harems and I'm less of a fan of H-games, but I watched this series because I enjoyed the anime adaptation of Navel's ""Shuffle!"" See&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shuffle-Complete-Box-Set-S-A-V-E/dp/B005HVWVU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shuffle: Complete Box Set S.A.V.E.</a>.  In Shuffle! each of the girls has a dark and interesting backstory.  In Wings, the girls don't seem to have any backstory at all, but the main character is pretty interesting.  The first three episodes of Wings are nothing but really over-the-top fanservice.  But starting at episode 4, you begin to get a glimpse into the true story.

From a philosophical point of view, Wings is a commentary on escapism.  It's hard to say much in a review without saying most of what's actually done in the show, but let me just say that I thought that the TV channel-changing was a well thought-out symbol.

Overall, I was disappointed by the show.  It does have a couple of pretty interesting ideas, but it doesn't really take the time to develop any of them.  Instead, it spends it's time cramming in more ecchi...  I will say that Wings is more than a typical harem, but it's nothing near the level of Shuffle!",1382745600,17,1452,5.0974576271186445
5819383,5,B00DJ5IPTQ,"(Trying not to spoil, I swear!) The ending where you find out about the dudes and what's really going on is awesome! I can't say much more than that. As for the fanservice, the girls literally have no point in the series, but you end up liking them anyway. Also, episode 4 and 7 help explain what the scene hopping is all about. I suggest watching it online first. It's kind of confusing, but one of my favorites nevertheless!

EDIT: When I reviewed this anime the first time not that long ago, it only said that it was blu-ray. Now that I see that this is blu-ray AND dvd... I'll surely get it when I have money.",1374537600,11,613,4.239316239316239

5819387,5,B00DJ5IPTQ,"The anime girl, especially the ""young"" anime girl is a refreshingly new artistic expression of feminine beauty in all of it's aspects. Her arrival is a revolutionary break with the worn out clichs of the past (the Hollywood star, the runway fashion model and the adult women pictured in men's magazines). As an ideal, she is much more complicated than the ideals of the past. She takes her place among other modern works of art in expressing paradox and contradiction (Picasso, M.C. Escher, Jean Genet); she is both young and mature at the same time; she is both innocent and adult at the same time. Her idea can be expressed in either the cartoon art form or through the art of photography.
  When we begin to see the old Hollywood ideals as ugly, we ourselves are caught up in this condemnation and we can't help but see ourselves as something less than ideal. Thus we learn a new humility that comes to remove the vanity of the past. This can set us free from the intractable racial prejudices of the past. As something less than ideal we are all the same in this era with a new ideal, an unrealizable ideal of beauty. No one can be both young and old at the same time. Thus women are set free from the obligation to be beautiful as that was defined by the clichs of the past.
  The anime girl presents us with an historic opportunity to overcome the limitations of the past. I applaud We Without Wings for bravely pushing back against those limitations.
 In Jean-Paul Sartre's `Saint Genet--Actor and Martyr', we are able to see how a child, Jean Genet, learns and adopts a system of values that inherently condemns him. The child genet was abandoned by both mother and father. Adopted-out to simple peasants, he learned an ethics based on Being. Property ownership, the stability and unchanging qualities of things, is connected to goodness. A man is what he owns, and reciprocally he has internal essences which are unchanging in their determination of his value and qualities. But Genets' actual situation is in direct contradiction to this system; he has no property of his own, he is not a legitimate heir or even a legitimate child; he does not possess the innocence which children are naively supposed to possess. His situation becomes even more contradictory when he is caught stealing and labeled a thief. Nevertheless, he will never abandon this system of values despite the fact that it tears him apart from the inside out.
  I think that the people of Japan, like so many other people in the world, were greatly influenced by Western ideals of beauty communicated through Hollywood movies, Western TV, and fashion magazines. In adopting that system of aesthetic values, they become rather like Genet and they come to believe in a system of aesthetic values that condemns them. This white, Anglo-Saxon ideal of beauty, communicated to the world by Hollywood, especially in the past, is impossible to live up to for people other races. The anime girl ideal is also impossible to live up to but the difference, here, is that the bar she sets is impossible for all to attain.
  Violence toward women in Japanese anime and arts is difficult to understand and accept. In Sartre's `Critique of Dialectical Reason--Volume One,' he stated that sometimes the violence exerted by an oppressing class is interiorized and re-exteriorized by the oppressed class upon the members of their own class. He used the example of the riots in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angles where African-Americans burned their own automobiles, their own shops and businesses. Sartre said that this is a stage of revolution in which the oppressed class cannot directly confront the oppressing class. The widely exported US ideal of beauty exacts violence upon people of other nations who are, in effect, asked to adopt this ideal.  And as this ideal was, in the past especially, associated with a `white' ideal of beauty, people of other races who adopt it can end up living a lifetime of deep internal confusion combined with a sense of hopelessness. So we can see this internal confusion and contradiction and the attempt to deal with it expressed in art as violence against women. But this is only one aspect of the phenomenon.
 We had previously noted that when I adopt this new expression of feminine beauty in the anime girl, I can come to see the worn out Hollywood ideals as ugly, as less than ideal in every way. Since they are my ideals, I cannot see them as less than ideal without being affected and thus, I come to see myself as less than ideal. This helps me to see people of other races in a new light. They are no longer alone in being less than the American ideal. I stand beside them now, the same in a new humility. But I also see these worn out clichs of beauty as mannish. As less feminine and beautiful, with big bulky bones under their skin, they do look more like a man, which is to say more like myself. Hence they become my equal they are the same as me. Here, we see an example of a prejudice based not upon inferiority but upon a perceived superiority. When that arbitrarily decided superiority is removed, so is the prejudice.
 Now we can see the devaluation of women through violence in Japanese anime from yet another perspective. We can see it as a sort of correcting movement in that it works to remove a former mystification with the beauty of women in general. We can also begin to sense where that correcting movement is ultimately aimed, that being the original contradiction of values, internalized and lived in confusion. In order to exact violence upon a woman, I have to remove myself from a state of mystification, from my previous adoration of her beauty. But I also have to see her as having a new strength appropriate to withstanding this violence. I have to see her as more mannish and hence as an equal.
  One can see similar themes in both the area of violence toward women in anime and in the transition to a new ideal of feminine beauty in the anime girl. I think that the transition to the anime girl ideal initially is more relevant for us in the west since it is our non-contradictory ideal which is concerned and since it offers us a chance to overcome our prejudices. The aspect of violence toward women would seem to be more relevant to the people of East Asia and other parts of the world where the aesthetic contradiction is a problem. But interestingly, in both cases, East and West, the resolutions seem to move along the same lines, toward the removal of the Western ideal of feminine beauty. It might be worth noting that in the one case we are considering aesthetic ideals and in the other case we are touching upon ethical considerations. But on the whole, our concern is about the arts and how aesthetic ideals can come to condition how we perceive ourselves and others.
 Perhaps, too, violence toward women in Japanese anime can be seen as just one specific aspect of a more general violence-toward-all. What do we mean by this? I think that that would be a rather general devaluation of the human insofar as human is defined in unrealistically ideal terms. With the example of the transition to the anime girl ideal, we saw how problems arise when the ideal of beauty is an actual human being, the Hollywood star, for example. When the ideal is an actual woman that means that any woman could live up to that ideal even though it might require extensive plastic surgery. Thus there is an implicit obligation to do so. When the ideal of beauty is stylized cartoon figures, both child and adult at the same time, no human being can live up to this ideal and hence all are freed from the expectation to do so. So many are left out when expected to live up to the idea of human beauty, perhaps we would be better off without it. The Bible warned against vanity, and perhaps with good reason.
 If we can make real progress toward understanding the origin and the structures of violence toward women in anime and thereby gain a certain acceptance of it as artistic expression, perhaps we can do the same with other elements which we might find difficult to understand and accept. Perhaps those other elements may have similar origins, structures and reason for being.
  Another question arises here: can we see ourselves as less than beautiful in an aesthetic sense without consequently seeing ourselves as less than beautiful in an ethical sense? Or it might be put: when we see ourselves as less than beautiful aesthetically, doesn't this rather suggest an opening, a space that wasn't there before and a type of freedom outside the bounds of the ethical? Furthermore, what would be the entertainment choices of such a population less constricted by the ethics of the past and the present, where all share the same sense of both aesthetic and ethical imperfection as a form of common self-acceptance? This, I believe, is a glimpse of our future and an insight into the culture of Japan today.",1399766400,,8938,4.678548695098663

5819390,2,B00DJ5IPTQ,"Imagine you work at an anime studio.  You have 4 or 5 different shows in development and you run out of money.  We without wings is an attempt to cobble together these shows into one.  The series feels disjointed and characters come and go so fast you don't develop a real attachment to them.  The animation is well done, and the series does actually come together by the end so it ""makes sense.""

The ""writers"" think that people are obsessed with ""panty shots"" apparently as there are quite a few of them.  The fan service is pretty random and feels out of place.  It's used in some series for humor, not here.  Most disturbingly is Alice, the little girl, who flashes you.  It was disturbing and I don't know how they get away with it.

The last episode was the typical ""trip to the hot springs.""  A few participants were a couple of ""13"" year old girls.  Again very disturbing.",1390521600,4,880,4.43125
5819391,3,B00DJ5IPTQ,"Ten years ago,7-year-old Yogi Hanada commited an unpardonable sin; he struck his mother and caused her injury. As the story unfolds,in the later part of this series,it isn't as clear as perhaps it should be what all that transpired but whatever it was it seemed his mother was more than just upset with her husband leaving,perhaps she was suffering from mental disorder,what little time spent on her displayed emotionality hints at possible schizophrenia. Yogi,unable to deal with the two opposite demands of his mother regarding his sister,Kobato,(ie;""Love you sister-Hate your sister,"") fugues (mentally withdraws from reality) and ""creates"" several other ""personalities"",their individual personalities all based on characters in his favorite video game,one that has the kigdom of Gretaguard as the center. For you psych-types,you already should know that this is Dissociative Identity Disorder (300.14) and not what the series calls,""Multiple Personality Disorder"" as there is great double such really exists. But,for the limited intellictual depth of this series,it really isn't that important what it is called.
The players of this well-drawn,reasonably paced and more than interesting series are the several ""personalities"", the most prominate being the ""daytime"" and central alternate personality,the 17-year-old whimpy student,Takashi Haneda. He has a girlfriend named Asuka Watarai who is exceptionally attractive,fiesty and with a rich,dynamic personality: she deserves her own series.
In fact,the girls carry this whole series. The females are the ones that are carrying the emotional loads of all the males,none of whom appear to be particuarly emotionally stable nor strong. The girls are also unusually attractive,all with strong personalities....until we get to Alice,who is the reason a 4+ quality series cannot be given more than a 3,if that.
Alice is the 6 to 8 year old blonde daughter of a foreign businessman recently transfered to Japan. She hangs out in the late evening with a ""black dude"" named Marinez, ""why"", I cannot even guess, and has not correctly learned the street lingo. In resonse to a comment by Drac that should never been made in the first place concerning her panties,Alice flips her skirt up and fights to hold the hem up while explaining she wears lacey and see-through panties; the artists make sure the viewer sees she is not only is not lying but that she is indeed a girl,front and back. This happens twice, she mentions something about strip-rock-paper-scissors,mentions ,""...Drac is not happy down there..."", and sits on an electric pelvic thruster at a spa. This is a nod to a thankfully microscopic group of sickos,is completely inexcusable and distructive of an otherwise delightful series;can homoerotica be far behind? Those sorry sickos do not bring in anywhere near the monies and fans that they cost.
When Alice takes Ai's bra pads at the pool and puts them in her own bathing suit,that is what a girl her age,and older,would do and is entertaining. Her being naked in a spa is also normal but not really neccessary.
If there is to be a Season 2,Alice must either be cleaned up or eliminated.",1387152000,,3147,5.283433133732535
5819392,1,B00DJ5IPTQ,"I'm not ashamed to admit that I enjoy fan service and harem animes. High School DXD, Haganai and So I Can't Play H are some recent favorites of mine.  So when I heard about this show taking a different approach with some unique plot twists. I decided to give it a chance.  Big mistake!  This show is just plain bad.  It tries to do comedy and parody and it either falls flat or is outright embarrassing to watch.  The show is poorly animated and the fan service scenes especially reflect this and when the show does finally introduce some interesting plot twists and ideas it quickly lapses back into awfulness and never finds any decent pacing.

The only reason I can figure as to why Funimation licensed this show is that it comes from the creators as the more popular Shuffle!

5819393,3,B00DJ5IPTQ,"As a long time lover of anime I decided to start trying to purchase pre-order series that I had either not heard about or things that sounded good to give me a broader variety of series/stories to view.

Wings started out quite slow. Being a female, I don't mind fan service and actually enjoy it when I'm in the mood for a light and bubbly anime to entertain me. Wings doesn't disappoint anyone who hopes to catch a glimpse of some panties or some jiggle time but it does lack quite a bit when it comes to actual story line. I felt that I was just getting to know each of the characters when a new one would appear and just as quickly disappear. Sometimes I would look away and find myself so totally lost at what was currently going on in the story. It's one of those series where you have to listen to everything and pay close attention.

12 episodes was definitely not enough for even a first season considering how much more they could have done with the characters and I'm actually looking forward to the second season to see how it will continue.",1385337600,5,1053,4.340101522842639
8593726,4,B00DJ5IPTQ,"We without wings (WWW) carries some fairly heavy baggage. I came across it as a trailer on one of the High School DxD DVDs and you can guess what aspect of this that trailer promoted. Eventually I got around to buying the multi-format version. I have crunchyroll and not funimation and so buying the DVD/Blu-Ray version was the only way to see it.
WWW has an interesting visual style. The visuals are colourful and dramatic and flow faster than the story. They scene-joins and background graphics are what makes the visual style so unusual and compelling.
Fan Service - Yes there's quite a lot of it; mostly gratuitous. There is also a fairly strong Loli bias too. In reality the fan service doesn't add much here.
The story is quite confusing at first. I felt myself stumbling along with the episodes trying to work out what was going on. Fortunately enough of the characters were sufficiently interesting to make the chaos bearable. I could see how the first few episodes might make people switch off though. For me ""Falcon/Drac"" was sufficient to keep me watching. The story does resolve itself fairly well and I don't want to give any hints. The blurb on the cover says that this is a real tear-jerker. It isn't! The characters and plot aren't ever well enough resolved for that. Love Chunibyo and even assassination classroom are more emotionally involving.
As an experience this is a fascinating one. The chaotic start and lack of real character involvement stop me from giging this 5 stars but I would certainly watch it again.",1506816000,,1534,4.7706766917293235

8593729,5,B00DJ5IPTQ,"We without wings (www) is above all an experimental series and incredible bold at it!  This is a product aimed at audiences used to junk shows: superficial and stereotyped characters and situations, shows used to avoid the real world and dwell in fantasy. As can be seen in the reviews many in the audience failed in dealing with www. The main topic of escaping reality mustve reminded to many of they themselves. Yet, www somehow managed to get a 4 star ranking. So the audience is not that trashy. After all, we all avoid reality one way or another.

  I regarded www as an awesome display of creativity with a beautiful display of background scenarios. People prone to clinging to stereotypes (majority) will struggle with Japanese urban scenes that resemble Los Angeles or Chicago rather than Kyoto. Even more impressive than the landscapes its the army of cast members, many of them with complex and shifting personalities.  This is a severe departure from the usual personalities in average entertainment where each character has a set type of personality -or better said stereotype- and sticks to that.
www brings us many characters with many sides depending the context and situation they happen to live. However, the three main ones cant get it straight so easy because they are not merely different sides of a single person, but three whole different personalities inside a single person: Chitose, Hayato and Haneda, who came into existence to protect Youji, who shut himself to escape the real world after he thought he killed his mom when she attacked him and his sister.

The main front personality in charge happened to be Haneda, who happened to become a total weakling who also escapes real world by shutting himself into a fantasy world that is not even his, just a copy of a video game. It was logical indeed to have Yoiji create a personality like himself: Haneda who in turn created Chitose & Hayato to face reality.

 The official translation (this products) has Haneda claiming to be incomplete but elsewhere he claimed to be incompetent which does fit the situation. wwws translation is rather bad, as it happens to other official ones: missing jokes, trying to sound sophisticated but being obscure in fact, etc. But as for the show itself, for such a creative production it was incredibly lacking in comedy, the same dumb jokes and boring slapstick humor over and over, non stop. At least a few scenes when the trio shows up out of their comfort zones get funny.

This is one of the few believable harem shows, only from a logical stance (but the world is not logical). The way that wwws sub-hero gets a harem is by splitting himself into different personas who live different situations, situations with many more cast members than only the pretty girls to whom he finds ways to relate and bond. Chitose gets to protect new writer Tamizimi from bullying and saves her career; Hayato becomes a trustable friend to Naru and HanedaHaneda just doesnt trouble Kobato too much and gets lucky with Asuka. Actually Asuka has her own issues, shes violent. Haneda wouldnt be lucky after all in real world with someone like Asuka.

I couldn't help feeling disgusted at Haneda (like the Crow told him), his weakling voice, demeanor and his siding with the very people who attack him only make him object of scorn, so he seeks refuge by believing he is in fact a great  and respected warrior in another world. But beyond that we get to see more of the people who disrespect him, who also happen to have good sides in fact and don't need a clash to stop their rudeness. Again, www shows us more realistic and elaborate portrayals of human people, all of this being just an approximation to reality of course.

The huge extra cast overwhelmed many people, but I regarded it as a puzzle. After all this is a psychological show, that why I went for it and one comment claiming it had an awesome depth of story for an eccchi (erotic, non-pornographic) show. Every time that I rewatched it I discovered new details and plots and became very fun this way. It was a strange yet pleasant feeling watching a show without understanding it for some time.
www does have a number of logic flaws or holes in the story. For instance, Haneda at first is supposed to ignore about other people inside his mind, so who did he ever think was on charge all the times he ran away with his tail between his legs? Later on, Haneda did happen to have known them. I guess the story got so branched and complicated that the producers couldn't help it.

Someone complained that too many characters showed up to briefly and couldn't get time to bond with any. I preferred to regard all these characters as a part of a jungle landscape full of personalities and their situations instead of animals and vegetation. Some audience had trouble with a precocious little girl, Alice, and wondered how the producers got to sell this. I guess their puritan ways blinded them from the fact everybody was protective towards her and that she was only joking and seeking friends, company.",1466640000,3,5058,4.727582292849035
