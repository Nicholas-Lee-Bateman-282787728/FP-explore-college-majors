189838,5,1572524413,"Jacques Becker's tight, intelligent thriller out-noirs most American entries. The magnetic presence of Gabin, France's answer to Tracy and Bogart, helps immeasurably. Gabin's Max is tough as they come, but also shows a human side in his unwavering loyalty to careless pal Riton. Becker keeps the yarn unraveling at a brisk pace, as Max's long-awaited retirement remains suspended in mid-air. Eye catching Paris locale adds flavor to this juicy crime classic.",1125964800,5,458,5.464788732394366
189839,5,1572524413,"Class is often confused with style and fashion in the regards to how one dresses.  In our contemporary society this confusion is frequently expressed through flamboyance, which is usually the result of how money talks.  However, this vain perception of class has nothing to do with one's self conduct. Refinement, sophistication, and class are qualities that should be attached with characteristics such as trust, confidence, and mutual respect.  These qualities are what define a gentleman. When people see a true gentleman they only see the exterior, and it is this exterior that money buys.

The days of gentlemen criminals are long gone.  Films such as Scarface (1983), New Jack City (1991), or any of Takashi Miike's violent gangster illustrations depict the new style of gangsters that contemporary society is facing where disloyal and ill-mannered thugs roll in the direction of dough.  These films visualize the frightening power money has on people.  This could be seen up close in a grotesque manner in the brilliant Maria Full of Grace (2004) where humans are being regarded as pack mules.  Touchez Pas Au Grisbi, which was shot over a half century ago, depicts the coming of this new criminal element.

Nostalgia swallows Jacques Becker's crime story about the aging criminal and gentleman Max (Jean Gabin).  The story takes place in Paris where Max lives life with a women half his age while spending untold numbers of nights desiring the same meaningless affection from the women seeking their way into men's wallets.  The many visits to the night clubs have led Max to discover that he has grown old, and many of the people around him are older.  The life he once desired is no longer as appealing, as he decides that he wants to return home early.  Max even discloses this to his friend Riton (Ren Dary) while having found out that Riton's young girlfriend has found a younger lover, as she has previously given Riton empty promises of love.

The professional life, which Max has chosen for himself is also undergoing a transformation.  Younger generations are cutting into the growing drug business without the consideration of others, and these young newcomers show little class while they trample on everyone in their sight.  Recently Max carried out a job that brought him and his partner Riton 50 million worth in Orly gold bars.  This was to be Max's final job before retirement, however, the newcomers in the criminal underworld seem to want change his destiny.

Touchez Pas Au Grisbi is a stunning gangster tale where the old ways are to face off with the new.  This is depicted through Max who is undergoing a personal life changing experience, as he is confronted by events around him that make him question what he is doing.  The character that Jean Gabin delivers to the screen is marvelously multifaceted, as he portrays the gentleman thief by being a tender lover, clever diplomat, friendly patron, and firm interrogator.  The cast around Gabin also displays nice work as they all accentuate Max's uniqueness by being fairly simple characters.  Much is due to Becker's marvelous directing, which comes together through all the aspects of filmmaking.  This eventually leaves the audience in a haze of bewilderment, as Touchez Pas Au Grisbi offers a complex and enriching cinematic experience.",1108512000,13,3321,5.0200729927007295
189840,5,1572524413,"Like a fine wine, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI has aged wonderfully. Under the expert and loving hands of the folks at Criterion, we have an absolutely pristine print of this understated and refined French gangster movie. Watching the Criterion DVD is to fall completely into the film, as the restored black and white images are simply glorious.

This movie is not like today's heavy-handed violent gangster movies, but a more elegant and sophisticated presentation that focuses on character development and its themes of loyalty, betrayal, and an adherence to a moral code. Jean Gabin, who plays the urbane and respected criminal Max, is the soul of this movie, presenting Max as charming, stoic, and ruthless. Great detail is given to ordinary tasks, like the serving of a meal, brushing of one's teeth, etc., but the effect, instead of arty, goes to the development of the characters and the portrayal of them as regular folks.

Lest you believe this is a slow talky picture, there are moments of explosive violence that will send a chill through you. Suspense is created through the most effective of methods: by what you don't see and what is filled in by one's own imagination. As the tension mounts in the movie, you will be glued to the screen gripping the arms of your chair with withering anticipation. They don't make 'em like this anymore, neither here nor in Europe. This movie is a fine example of both  French cinema before the New Wave, and of the gangster genre.

In any language, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI means film excellence, especially after the careful, painstaking restoration by Criterion Studios.",1106438400,21,1611,4.911764705882353
189841,5,1572524413,"The great Jean Gabin is world weary, elegant, elder crime king pin Max in Jacques Becker's understated 1954 TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI (Criterion).

The title literally translates ""Hands off my loot!"" But it's all about the details and relationships that are peripheral to the aftermath of big bullion heist that Max has just pulled off.  His plan is to retire with his pretty young girlfriend, but when long time not so smart partner Riton brags to his two timing moll Josy (Jeanne Moreau), Max is sucked back into the world he helped create and can never leave.

Becker died in obscurity in 1960, but over time his reputation has grown.  This once forgotten gem is now recognized as a near perfect touchstone of the crime genre and it looks brand new in pristine black and white.

Extras include interviews and essays and a TV documentary.  It would be nice if the subtitles were in yellow, but that is a small complaint for a terrific film.",1106179200,4,938,4.654545454545454
189842,5,1572524413,"A wonderful movie - romantic desolation, Gabin at his best.

Gripping, ironic, tragic - the film is more interested in its people than its plot. (Easy to see this as the work of a Renoir apprentice). But all the other reviewers below have covered all

that. The point is the disc: Criterion and Rialto continue to raise the bar for making old B&W 1:37 films look and sound great on disc. They start 2005 off with a bang on this one: pin-sharp, lovely contrast, a superb grain texture, the mono track rendered cleanly and clearly without brittleness. The extras - interviews and documentaries from French TV programs - are especially illuminating. A wonderful disc of an essential film.

It certainly bodes well for a great year from Criterion!",1106092800,4,743,4.7890625
189843,5,1572524413,"Along with Rififi and Bob Le Flambour, Grisbi is a film no lover of crime flics should miss. The story is simple, Max ( Jean Gabin ) is an aging criminal who has just pulled off a robbery which will set him up in retirement. He knows that time is catching up with him and wishes himself out of the game. Unfortunatly he is stuck with a dim witted partner, Riton ( Rene Dary ) who thinks he carry on as he and Max did in their younger days.

Angelo ( Lino Ventura ) a rival gangster decides that he will cut himself into Max's grisbi (loot) and kidnaps Riton to get at him. Max then has to decide between keeping the loot and his loyalty to Riton and the underworld code of honour.

The great Jean Gabin is on top form as Max, he might to getting on, but this is still a guy you do not wish to mess with. Max might stick to the underworld code of honour but this does not stop him torturing a rival to find what he needs to know. In Max's world what matters is loyalty to your friends, everything else including the way you treat women, comes a distant second.

In this film we see why Max is a criminal. It is because he likes good suits, expensive restaurants, fine wine and beautiful women. Compare this to White Heat where Jimmy Cagney despite pulling off a series of robberies spends most of his time hiding out in cabins in the mountains.

Watch out for a young Jeanne Moreau as Riton's cheating girlfriend.",1103760000,3,1412,4.199261992619927
189844,5,1572524413,"If there is one scene that explains the enduring appeal of 'Touchez Pas Au Grisbi' (basically 'don't touch the loot'), it is this: Max (Jean Gabin at his most Mitchum-esque), an aging hood who has pulled off a massive airport robbery and plans to retire quietly to the country, sits in his apartment one night with his old friend, the somewhat lunk-headed Riton (Rene Dary).  Riton's girlfriend (Jeanne Moreau) has left him for a young gangster, Angelo (Lino Ventura in a sensational debut), whom she has informed of the job, and who is trying every means possible to snatch the gold.
So this scene is of crucial generic urgency, with rippling consequences for the development of the plot.  What Becker films is entirely without urgency or consequence.  In complete silence, he follows the middle-aged men as they enter the apartment, sit down, prepare a light supper, eat and talk; Max then gets up, takes out mattresses and pillows for his friend's bed like a good chambermaid, undresses in the bathroom, brushes his teeth, Riton likewise; then they both go to bed.  This beautifully understated, intimate and domestic scene does not replace the crime genre, but co-exists in paralell with it, showing what is at stake.
This split defines the movie, from the conflict between older and younger characters (and men and women); between Max's affable respectability and his latent sadism; between bright interiors of oppressive theatrical artifice and dark outdoor locations; between static scenes where nothing much happens and jolting bursts of brutal violence and action.  You even find it in the brilliant closing car chase, as thrilling location work intercuts with Hitchcock-style back projection.  This disparity between the real and ideal gives the film its melancholic, philosophical heart, and gives the climax an over-powering force, set in the quiet countryside to which Max wished to retire, and which can only offer backdrop to a bloodbath.
Critics have found in 'Grisbi', a gangster film about loyalty, treachery, collaboration, surveillance, torture, clandestine activities, secret hideouts, rural slaughter and military hardware, some kind of allegory for the Nazi Occupation of France a decade previously.  This explanation is attractive because the period had been tacitly removed from the public sphere.  But there is nothing so portentously grand in Becker's characteristically light handling.  Max and the gangsters may well have been in the Resistance - Melville has said that underworld methods and contacts were vital to both Resistance and Gestapo - as their knowledge of torture techniques and gun-smuggling suggests.  But the Resistance were absolutely crucial to their time and place, whereas Max and his friends are resolutely out of time, relics from the past who can only play at assimilation - the recurring motif of Max's harmonica theme suggests a man literally stuck in a groove.  Max himself exists in a paralell world to the realities of a 1950s France nowhere to be seen on screen, a revenant infernally condemned to repeat mistakes and watch old friends die.",1008288000,54,3097,5.236363636363636

Having watched Rififi, which I particularly enjoyed for its excitement and realism, and having watched Bob le Flambeur, which I didn't particularly enjoy, as I said I came to Touchez Pas Au Grisbi just hoping I would like it and nothing more.

Well, what can I say? I really enjoyed this movie, and Jean Gabin, the chief player in the movie, is more understated and stoic as a gang boss, than temperamental and over the top, and all the other actors played believable parts which for me help the plot, and the twist and turns in the plot, go well.

The heist of the movie has already taken place before the movie starts, and revolves around two aging gangsters trying to get around 50 million francs for gold bullion. While they are waiting for the (considerably lot less) money, another gangster has other plans, and kidnaps one of the gangsters to swap him in return for the loot.

This comment comes from a person who doesn't share the ""its great since it's a foreign film"" attitude. I am also not one of those that say any foreign film is good and then down rate the reviews of those complaining about the terrible foreign films rated as good.

In most foreign films you have to ""put up with much boredom"" before you get to the little good in them. But this film, while being slow by USA standards, is what all foreign films should be, slow yet fast enough to not ""die"" on you before the next important event.

The lead character catches the POST WWII Euro HEART and value system perfectly. Stolen money from high socialist taxes or just directly stolen from the bank, is as good as earned money. A mistress on the side. Friends you love. It satisfies the desire for a free ride in life that never ends. Ah the easy life....",1346630400,,1094,4.432835820895522
189855,5,1572524413,"Hey, I have been touting crime noir films for the past couple of years so why not review, as here with Jean Gabin's 1954 Touchez Pas au Grisbi, a French crime noir in honor of, well, the name of the genre. And a later generation of French directors who went crazy for Hollywood gangster epics in such films as ""Breathless"" and Don't Shoot The Piano Player. Especially when said this crime noir stars Jean Gabin, last reviewed here in a very different film, Children Of Paradise.

Well, let's cut to the chase (literally, as this plot unfolds). It seems that long- time crime boss Max (Gabin) has pulled a caper (heist, okay) to set himself and his confederate Riton up for a well-deserved retirement from the rackets. And everything was going along just fine until old buddy Riton got a loose tongue over some show girl (played by a very young Jean Moreau) and spilled his guts out to her about how he could keep her in clover. Problem is that young showgirls are as fickle and calculating as any other woman mixed up with bad actuarial table criminals and she has another crime boss on the hook, one Angelo. Naturally she mentions the loot to Angelo and sets off an explosion of maneuvers by him to get the kale, and by Max to keep it.

The cat and mouse of this pair drives the rest of the movie with old Max showing one and all why he was (and is) the king of the hill, even if he may have lost a step or two. Angelo's big mistake (besides thinking that Max was over the hill and easy pickings) was kidnapping Riton, an act that set Max on a fight to the finish. See the film to get the details of that fight to the finish. What is important though is the use by the director here of the many tough guy moves made by Hollywood gangsters in the heyday 1930s including a few off-hand beatings of opponent gangsters to get information, a few off-hand slaps at show girls (by Gabin of all people but that is part of being a boss and no chump), and a car chase, natch complete with machine guns ta-ta-ta-ing. Ya, the French picked up the genre very nicely. Gabin might be a little too suave (except for those off-hand girl slaps) to be an American 1930s gangster but he fit the more demure 1950s just right.",1338249600,,2205,4.336561743341404

This one, filmed in a Paris that seems to sparkle, is, in fact, as dark, gritty, and exciting as any he made.

Ventura would go on to make more than 50 films, but this was his first--someone had recommended him to the director as a man who looked like a gangster; at the time, having been a wrestler, he was working as a wrestling promoter.

This film was, to be sure, highly influential on the crime films that would follow.  It's absorbing, character-driven, with considerations of love, friendship and morality at its heart.  The script is faultless: the picture is hard-charging and hard-edged, tough, yet it has an evocative, romantic atmosphere.  The director's treatment of the crime milieu is matter-of-fact, his tale narrated with great understatement, then, surprising violent episodes.  Gabin turns in his usual man of the people performance: hardened, but humorous. It's a powerful movie that works its way to a shootout on dark, empty country roads, with an ending no viewer will soon forget.",1302652800,3,3599,7.0358744394618835
189858,5,1572524413,"Seen today, Touchez Pas Au Grisbi seems like Jean Gabin's last great role, but in 1954 it was seen as his comeback after a slew of disappointing post-war films that were generally fairly average on their own merits even when not compared to his remarkable run of pre-war classics. Certainly he was the right actor at the right time when his career, like the old-school thief he plays, was beginning to look like it was over. The old Gabin is still recognisable but the rot has set in, and it's that combination of a class act that has outlived his time that makes his perfect casting performance so remarkable. He's a bit of a moaner and feels his age: constantly weary, he's got to that time in his life when he wants to go to bed early because if he stays up after midnight he feels like he's working overtime. Far from the doomed romantics he specialised in during his Thirties prime, he's a faded man edging into the shadows - in one remarkable shot even a lit match casts no light on his face - in a film that takes a lot of the glamour off both its star and its genre. He and his longtime, not too smart partner have pulled their last job before the film even starts, and the inevitable violence and tragedy come from his attempts to keep his newly acquired `pension' - the grisbi (loot) of the title - from rival crooks.

There's no romance or honour among thieves here. From the clubs where the `dancers' do little more than walk across the stage to the restaurants that shun the slumming socialite crowd, it's a mediocre, artificial world they inhabit, where packs of criminals aren't loyal unless it suits them, where almost everyone either expresses disappointment or hides behind insincere clichd expressions of admiration and loyalty. For director Jacques Becker how his low lives go about the everyday business of living is as important as the plot, and strangely it's surprisingly compelling too despite what is happening often being so mundane. You can feel the cold of the rarely used apartment he and Ren Dary's Riton eat their crackers and pate in before breaking out their pajamas, brushing their teeth and going to bed early just as vividly as you can feel the crisp night air of a roadside hostage exchange that goes disastrously wrong.

If that sounds perhaps too grim and austere, the film is anything but. Beautifully directed by Becker, whose reputation has sadly faded over the years - indeed, for a long time this, perhaps his most famous film, was out of circulation in English speaking territories - and featuring Lino Ventura in his first role and an early appearance by Jeanne Moreau, it's one of the best French thrillers ever made and it's easy to see why it's been such a huge influence on the crime genre. The UK DVD is a good presentation as is the original StudioCanal French DVD, but not unexpectedly, Criterion's Region 1 NTSC DVD outdoes it as far as supplements go: a lengthy extract from French TV series Cinastes de Notre Temps, an entertaining and insightful 2002 interview with supporting player Daniel Cauchy, who reveals why his character really didn't make it to the film's finale, a 1972 interview with Lino Ventura, a 1978 interview with composer Jean Wiener, the original French theatrical trailer and detailed liner notes.",1284076800,3,3275,4.713787085514834

I won't be as detailed in my review but the prior reviews have said what I have been thinking about this movie for the past 12 months.
I rewatched this wonderful movie last night.  I must say...Jean Gabin is such an incredible actor.  So much like our Spencer Tracy except he can say so much with just a glance and a mere change in his facial expression can say it all.  I have seen him in some incredible Jean Renoirs and other movies of his from the 1930's...it is so neat to constrast the world weary 1954 Gabin character with his lively traveler from 20 years earlier.

This film is frank, brutally honest about aging criminals who operated with a touch of class.  They resorted to primitive violence when they needed to.

I love contrasting this free film w/ the tighter censorship of American film noirs.  It is darker and it just seems more realistic than the typical Hollywood film noir treatment.  The skating around the expression of female nudity (granted they were pictures on the wall of the nightclub) and seduction scenes were fascinating to contrast too.

The female actresses were fun to watch and linger over.  Some were absolutely beautiful and support the claim of France having some incredible women.

I love how all the characters were developed slowly and it closes with a finger gripping climax.  I was NEVER bored from the first minute on.

I cannot recommend this movie any more than I am now.

189860,5,1572524413,"Jean Gabin has always been my favorite actor (he should be; I wrote a book about him -- WORLD'S COOLEST MOVIE STAR), and this is really the consummate 'later period' Gabin movie.

Most Americans know Jean Gabin only from a handful of films which he made in the '30s, his ""matinee idol"" period when he played movie history's consummate tragic drifter.  But in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, he played the ultimate 'classy' gentleman-gangster -- a definite progenitor of Vito Corleone -- and director Jacques Becker's ""Touchez pas au grisbi"" (""Hands of the Loot"") knocks it out of the park.  If you like French noir movies like ""Rififi"" and ""Bob Le Flambeur,"" this picture is just as wonderful.

Aside from the requisite action sequences, director Jacques Becker (Renoir's A.D. on ""Les Bas-fonds,"" ""La Grande illusion,"" and ""La Bete humaine"") wisely alternates the action with some finely nuanced scenes between the characters, scenes which really make them genuine and 'real' to the viewer.

I can't recommend Touches pas au grisbi"" highly enough.  It should be part of every serious cineaste's DVD collection.",1224547200,3,1105,5.077348066298343
189861,5,1572524413,"Jean Gabin is sensational as a dapper old Parisian gangster who knows when his bedtime is.  Not so his lovelorn buddy who lets slip to his younger showgirlfriend Jeanne Moreau about their last haul.  When dope-dealing lug Lino Ventura catches wind and plots to rip them off, it's time for Gabin to start slapping people.

Great scenes of Paris at night coupled with a terrific score make this a thrilling entertainment.  And the picture looks stunning on this DVD.

It's amazing to think that Lino had never acted before this -- he's effortlessly menacing here.  But this is Gabin's show.  He's tough but oddly lovable too.  Never has the criminal urge to kick back and enjoy the good life seemed less cliche and more poignant.",1220054400,3,727,4.76
189862,5,1572524413,"There are not many words by which to describe the awesome 'combination' of the Sir Laurence Olivier/Marlon Brando 'version' of One of the most well-accomplished French Actors, ever to 'explode' upon the Silver Screen, the magnificent, Jean Gabin. This motion picture ""Touchez Pas au Grisbi"", is, about loyalty, the macho camaraderie binding the 'participants', as well as the unwritten law of never 'grassing up' your 'mates.' The word ""loyalty"" which is the clear message this film conveys, suggests, that, any man who is disloyal, lacks in character, and, basic moral fibre. Should this be the case, then, 'he'; is 'no good' to his friends, or to; anybody else.",1203724800,2,663,5.148148148148148

189864,5,1572524413,"Yes, it is about gangsters. But to any Continental old enough to have seen this movie first in a small suburban movie theater full of smoke (when the basic idea was 'I will grow up and do this kind of things'), then to have seen it again in late night showings on a black-and-white TV (when it was already slightly fading away, towards nostalgia), and finally in poor VHS and in the admirable Criterion edition, it will be mostly about growing old, and experiencing that specific form of loneliness that is one of the glories of old males. Eating a leftover terrine of foie gras with a baguette in the company of an old friend may be more quintessential to spirit of this movie than any crime scene.",1159315200,4,699,4.46875
189865,5,1572524413,"This film, made in 1954, is an ironic look at an ageing gangster ready to go into retirement, having pulled off one last heist - several bars of gold - which gets him into a life and death conflict with several younger hoods plotting to steal it from him. He is accompanied by a long-time partner, and director Becker makes much of the friendship between them as they talk of getting too old for the life of night clubbing and show girls. Gabin is wonderful in this role, rarely smiling, often a little bored, while maintaining an air of gravitas appropriate for a suave, well dressed man of considerable reputation among his peers.

The film moves rather slowly as it sets up the situation while taking time to humanize the characters, but eventually there is excitement enough as a kidnapping leads to a dramatic car chase, automatic gunfire, and explosives. The script is tightly knit, taking place over a period of 36 hours, and the cinematography is impressive for the time, as so much was shot in the streets of night-time Paris or in the darkened countryside (actually the Riviera). A revealing ""floor show"" is also in stark contrast to the Production Code-regulated exposure of skin permitted in Hollywood films of the 1950s.

As the interviews on this DVD reveal, only Gabin among its cast (including Lino Venturra and a very young Jeanne Moreau) was known to film audiences at the time, and Gabin had long since ceased being a bankable ""star."" This film was a comeback role for him and it helped launch the careers of Venturra and Moreau. Altogether, this DVD re-release offers many pleasures for fans of film noir and landmarks of popular French cinema. The collection of interviews from various sources, including Lino Venturra and the film's composer, are especially informative.",1149638400,4,1792,4.872131147540983

7797812,5,1572524413,"TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI (or, roughly, ""Hands off the Loot"") is a seminal French picture from the Fifties.  While I agree with the prior reviewer who said that the film is more about aging and friendship than the interior workings of gangsters, it has enough of the underworld to satisfy even the most fervent American gangster-movie fan:  tough guys, rough guys, dolls, molls, chantoosies and the semi-retired all grapple with the incomparable Jean Gabin, out to save his best friend from a routine (and brutal) kidnapping.  This movie above all others proves that the Parisians, who had been denied American films during the Nazi occupation during World War II, fairly gorged on U.S. gangster movies, especially the type now called *Noir*, after the war ended.  To see GRISBI is to see not only a wonderful construction, and proof that Gabin retained his power even into middle age, but a kind of recapitulation of classic ""dark"" American movies, including TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE and those wonderful old Fox black-and-whites like WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS.  GRISBI is well worth the money!",1483574400,3,1092,5.044444444444444

Of course it turned out that they were quite distinct and Grisbi was much less exciting for us. Particularly Gabin's performance seemed kind of bland and usually he is one of our very favorite actors. Then I read lots of reviews of this movie as part of the Criterion Collection and I came to appreciate more good qualities that were present. So I watched it again during the 24-hour rental period and enjoyed it more. I learned that Gabin was intended to be rather impassive and stoic in this flick. Particularly important to me is its historical importance in the evolution of French film noir, which I love. I highly recommend checking IMDB and Criterion Collection website to deepen your film appreciation!",1477612800,,841,4.8068965517241375

I was not in love with this film the first time I viewed it - I was tired and too sleepy.  I watched the end a second time and still was not getting it.  Right before I wrote this review, I read a fantastic review  written by Darragh O'Donoghue about this film and suddenly it all came together for me. I could never write a movie review, especially for this movie, as well as Mr. O'Donoghue's.  So I am going to suggest if you are at all interested in this film, please read his review of Tochez Pa's Au Grisbi and not only enjoy this great film but read a beautifully written review of it as well.",1476403200,,729,4.134751773049645
