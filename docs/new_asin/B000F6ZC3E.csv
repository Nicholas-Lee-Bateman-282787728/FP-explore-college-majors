8118179,1,B000F6ZC3E,"When I bought the dvd, I assumed it was entirely about the NSX. Unfortunately, only the last 6 minutes of the dvd were devoted to the car that is on the cover and title.",1355616000,6,169,4.0
8118180,1,B000F6ZC3E,"This video is a history of the Honda Motor Company and has nothing to do with the NSX other than a little bit of time on the continuum, (how do you like the millenial reference?).  I am totally ripped that I didn't read the review beforehand.  While it contains about 6 minutes of NSX footage, I feel ripped off in my purchase.  It is nice to view history and how it connects with an end product, however when the label is NSX, I expect more than 10% of the time devoted to this legend of the automobile business.  As an Owner of an NSX and a Stockholder of the Honda Motor Company, the producers ought to be held accountable for their total mislabeling of this product.  An explicit disaster of the DVD business.",1324857600,9,713,4.330827067669173
8118181,2,B000F6ZC3E,"Be forewarned that this video contains very little NSX content. The first 38 minutes are about this history of the Honda Motor Company -- interesting, but no NSXen are seen. Then, from 38:00 to 44:00 (six minutes), the video talks about the NSX, but even this is very sparse. From 44:00 to the end it's more Accords and Civics.

As an NSX enthusiast, I was very disappointed.",1251676800,19,375,4.597014925373134
8118182,1,B000F6ZC3E,"The product was not as advertised.  It offered a review of the evolution of the Honda Motor Company, with about 5 minutes at the end, out of 60 minutes total, on the NSX.  I was expecting a video only about the development of the NSX, as the title suggested.  The product title and advertising was misleading.  If you want info on the NSX do not buy this product.

Your return policy was excellent.",1206662400,2,398,4.397260273972603
8118183,1,B000F6ZC3E,"Let me first by saying that I purchased this DVD because I own a NSX and wanted something for a casual watch.

Pros: Honestly NONE

Cons: I have seen bootleg DVDs of movies that looked much better... this DVD looks like a dub of a dub put on a VHS tape.

This DVD will show you the history of the Honda company and its founders..  and then..... yes about 8 minutes of NSX info..

yes thats right a very small part of this crappy dvd was even about the NSX.",1152316800,23,456,4.022222222222222
