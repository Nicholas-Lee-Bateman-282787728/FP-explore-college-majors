8440755,5,B004TKXY64,"This sounds really great on my home theater (5.1 w/ Pioneer receiver and Klipsch floorstanding speakers). I was worried since this wasn't Blu-ray, but the visuals are crisp and defined (1080p Samsung TV). Crowd noise is at a minimum. The whole show was mixed very well. It's a hair quiet but nothing a little volume adjustment can't fix. Ben's vocals are front and center and leave you satisfied.

Really glad I picked this up, I'm a huge DCFC fan and I'd recommend this to anyone with a good sound system.",1507680000,,506,4.622222222222222

8440757,1,B004TKXY64,"All of the songs are almost alike and the players do not draw your eyes to their stage performances.  The only thing interesting on the disc is their documentary about their home town.  It is an older disc, so perhaps there is a newer performance with more recent songs that do vary in tempo and style.",1473120000,,302,4.375

8440760,3,B004TKXY64,"Death Cab has some great songs, some included here. However, if this is how they sound in concert we will likely save our money for the studio CDs. It may be that the mixing was just bad. At times the guitar rifts cannot be heard at all.",1391558400,,237,4.0638297872340425
8440761,5,B004TKXY64,The little movie before the concert was neat. Hearing about how they all met in their own words was a nice addition.,1384992000,,116,4.318181818181818
8440762,2,B004TKXY64,"Hmmm, I'm kind of torn on this. On the one hand I own and enjoy DCFC albums like Transatlanticism (my favorite), Plans, Narrow Stairs, and now Codes and Keys. I've  been exposed to live DCFC before, in the form of Drive Well, Sleep Carefully, so I knew what to expect.

Drive Well, I must admit, kind of shocked me with it's rawness - Ben Gibbard's shaky vocals and all, and this DVD is no different, even though the production values are higher. I guess they are an Indy band and Indy music is supposed to be raw, but to me, it's a little disappointing. You know when you watch a DCFC vid, you're not getting the vocal prowess of the Eagles or anything, but still . . . the live setting does make Ben's vocal limitations quite apparent, and the lack of harmony vocals in songs like Transatlanticism and Grapevine Fires takes something away from the impact of those songs for me.

To sum up, if you've watched Drive Well, and were disappointed, then this is probably not the DVD for you. To me, the video of the artists onscreen seems strangely detached from the sound coming out of the speakers, almost like they're not making it; there was a disconnect for me as a viewer.

If you're not worried about exact reproduction of the songs as per the albums and just want to see the artists flexing their muscles in a live setting, you might like this.",1308873600,3,1348,4.423387096774194
8440763,4,B004TKXY64,"I've only skimmed through it (as it was just released today), but here's my first impression:

-  The mini-documentary (about 11 mins) at the beginning does a good job of adding color to just how important Bellingham, WA is to DCFC's formative years.

-  The setlist (which mixes selections from a 2-night run in 2009) is good - a bit heavy on the ""Narrow Stairs"" stuff for my taste, which is understandable since they were touring in support of that disc.

- The main reason that I didn't give this 5-stars is because of the crowd.  While the band's nostalgia for the city seems genuine, the crowd doesn't seem to reciprocate like I'd hoped they would.  I know a lot of people (myself included) who are just passionate about this band and I know that they played for much more raucous crowds than this show.  The crowd looked pretty young (I'm 36), so maybe they're not as familiar with Death Cab's earlier stuff?

All in all, a worthy purchase - the ""Transatlanticism"" that closes the show is alone worth owning - but there are a lot of fine moments in this 90-minute DVD.",1306800000,5,1074,4.523316062176166
