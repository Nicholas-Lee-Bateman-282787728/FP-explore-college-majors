1018524,2,6305396817,"This video had the great makings of an Al Capone documentary,but alas seems to have fallen short of the mark. Many things were omitted such as Al's top killers Anselmi and Scalise along with Jack Mcgurn. Excellent top  Capone historians used on this program such as Mr. Binder,Mr. Matt Luzi and  Mr. William Balsamo probably had no say whatsoever in the accuracy of the  timelines cause some of them were way out there! They mention Al Capone  being in Alcatraz when prohibition is repealed?Duh?  Al entered Alcatraz in  1934 and prohibition was repealed in 1933. They also mention Torrio being  hit and retiring after Hymie Weiss is killed. Wrong! Hymie was on the hit  against Torrio in 1925. Hymie was killed in 1926. This video might fly by the  average Joe Lunchpail and Sally Housecoat who have no inkling about  Capone,but it just doesn't cut it knowledge wise. A good Capone documentary  to see is called Al Capone Chicago's Scarface(Narrated by Geraldo).Another  good one is by A&E called Al Capone ""Scarface"".Again,this is  my personal opinion and your entitled to make your own mistakes. I speak  from living and breathing Al Capone as my hobby for the past thirteen  years.",963619200,10,1185,4.884422110552764
1018525,1,6305396817,"This video is more like a home movie than a serious documentary.  There was not enough pictures and information of Al Capone or the era in which he lived.  On the other hand there was much too many pictures and inserts of  the film makers friends , family, and stuff unrecognizable to most viewers.  A big disappointment. The other review must be from friends or family to  incourage the films makers, but you do an injustice to them and the general  public. Certainly these reviews are to incourage buyers, not make them  leary of their purchases.",951955200,5,548,4.645833333333333
1018625,1,6305396817,"I was expecting a movie. This was more of a documentary with a few vintage film clips thrown in. Honestly, I only watched 15 minutes of it because it was a waste of my time.",1386374400,,173,3.9714285714285715
1018626,2,6305396817,"not very substantive but OK since it was free. I just finished ""Confessions of Al Capone"" and was curious to learn more.",1377561600,,120,4.5
1018627,4,6305396817,this story/ documentary is abount little known facts abount al copone I like the interviews with people who knew him his friends nephews also historins the story puts a somewhat positive spin on him . did you know when a reporter said to al that he liked his cigar that he gave him a whole box of them these were very expense cigars the reporter couldn't belive it and a signed picture too of himself,1377475200,,400,4.346666666666667
1018628,5,6305396817,I always find information about Al Capone fascinating.  This was a documentary that I hadn't seen before and I found it to be a good one.  I would recommend it for Al Capone buffs.,1370822400,,180,4.264705882352941
1018629,3,6305396817,Informative and entertaining but probably a little biased by family remembrance. Good with little known facts and events.  I enjoyed it but its never gonna be nominated for anything.,1369440000,,182,5.275862068965517
1018630,4,6305396817,How Al Capone got started in his life of crime/mob. Money it seems it all comes down to money and power.,1367712000,,104,4.0
1018631,4,6305396817,"To some people, he was a folk hero.  To his peers, he was a ruthless murderer, even if he didn't pull the trigger himself.  He was the
first celebrity criminal to find his way into the American pop culture.  He wanted to be loved and admired by his public and he did a lot of charitable works which endeared him to the common man.  But, he was an underworld czar who did his best to unravel the
moral underpinnings of his society.  He was not a paradox---he just wanted his cake and eat it too!  Love or hate him, he was a part of the culture or subculture.  I believe this documentary treats him fairly, without glamorizing him or decrying him too much, if it is possible to decry a criminal too much!  It is worth your time to watch this program, even though it opens with a rather stupid bus tour of 1920's Chicago.  If you can get past the opening 10 minutes, you will enjoy the rest.  So, dig out your pearl grey fedora and get your gun moll to sit by your side, and spend a little time with Big Al in the town he owned--at least for a while!",1367107200,,1047,4.113300492610837
1018632,5,6305396817,"This was great because I learnd things I didn't know about. I was surprised to hear about his brother, and nephew?",1365811200,,114,4.476190476190476
1018633,5,6305396817,A fascinating and in-depth documentary about one of the most notorious mobsters in American history. Very factual and informative. I loved watching it!,1359417600,,151,5.608695652173913
1018634,3,6305396817,"This documentary was informative to me, I had been paying more attention to Dillinger and now I want to learn a little more about Capone. The film on this DVD was produced in 1998, I don't know if the bus tours are still operating but I will look for them next time I visit Chicago. The film shows some of the actual places, back at the time and as they are nowadays; to me that makes this and any other biography more interesting. I don't know if my DVD is a bootleg, since I only payed $1.00 at a Wally World store, they have not restocked more. You can see a lot of $1.00 DVDs around at many places, pharmacies and dollar stores, this one was a pretty good find. Maybe it is a bootleg, since it was about Capone, hehe that was not funny...",1205971200,,742,4.124137931034483

7888685,3,6305396817,Interesting... I like Gangster & Mobster history.. Not terribly exciting but pretty informative and entertaining. A decent watch. . .,1392595200,,133,5.7
