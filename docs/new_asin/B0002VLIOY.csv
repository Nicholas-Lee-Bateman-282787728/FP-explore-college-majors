8033238,1,B0002VLIOY,"I waited years to see this series, and I couldn't believe how awfully poor the production is. Even for something made in the 70's. Any high-school drama class could do much better. At least they'd think of including subtitles! Couldn't watch more than 20 minutes of the first book. Laughed a little at the ridiculously reddish Robert D'Artois and his unconvincing acting. The worst part of the experience was that neither amazon.com nor the sellers (inetvideo.com) accept returns. Guess the garbage can will have to be it's destiny.",1147392000,3,532,5.056818181818182
8033239,5,B0002VLIOY,"Indeed, this is a masterpiece. I saw this when I was 15 and simply fell in love with it. I then proceed to read the seven books (the seventh one has been written some ten years after the fact and tells about the whereabouts of Jean, the supposed living heir to the throne of France, son of Guccio and Marie).

Then, I had the pleasure of seeing those Rois Maudits almost once a year for ten years since French Canadian public TV had bought it. We almost had formed a fan club for Robert D'Artois (fabulous Jean Piat).

It is by far the most intelligent way to learn about that period of French medieval history and although one might argue that it is not totally accurate (of course, Druon fantasized about the assassination of the son of Guccio Bagglioni and Marie de Cressay who took the place of the son of Louis le Hutin and la reine Clmence, which led to the theory that there was a male heir to the throne of France, meaning that the Guerre de Cent ans wouldn't have been) but all the surroundings - language, costumes, habits and customs - are very accurate to the period.

To those who think the production is lame, might I say that it is a parti-pris of mise-en-scne. French production can be lavish and grandiose, but Barma wanted to keep it minimalist, intimate and simple so one would concentrate on the human drama, not on the dcor. It was not a matter of making a spectacle of it; it was a matter of scrutinizing the absurdity of life as a common denominator amongst the powerful, the meek, the strong, the weak, the victor and the loser.

I just saw the remake they did of it (yes, alas, even the French are struck by this sickness of the remake). Those who were put off by the lack of luxury will enjoy that version better. But for me, the charm is broken. I don't feel anymore as if I was hidden somewhere behind a curtain observing the life of the rich and famous in medieval times. And although I admire immensely Jeanne Moreau, for me there will always be only one Mahaut D'Artois: Hlne Duc. And I will still be in love with Jean Piat as Robert D'Artois, even thought I think that Torreton is a fabulous actor. You don't fill those red boots that easily.

Lastly, for those who are chagrined by the fact that the DVDs are not subtitled, I'd just like to say, thought luck. You can't imagine how many excellent series are not subtitled (in French) when released on DVD (I've been looking high and low for David Copperfield with Daniel Radcliff to no avail. I guess I'll have to wait until my daughter knows English better... and that is not such a bad thing after all.).",1133913600,9,2589,4.385416666666667
8033240,1,B0002VLIOY,"I waited for years to see this on DVD, having watched the series on BBC TV - in French with subtitles in English.  As soon as it appeared in France, I ordered it and anticipated the pleasure of seeing it again.  Alas and merde, the lazy, arrogant so-and-sos who had made the DVD version had omitted to include English (or any) subtitles.  What a large potential market they have missed.  If they wanted to promote the French language, English subtitles would have taken this production to a far wider audience that the francophone one. Ah well ...",1098748800,36,547,4.608247422680412
8033241,4,B0002VLIOY,"This French television production of Maurice Druon's famous hexalogy has a great deal to recommend it: most pleasurably, for those accustomed (or resigned) to the megalomaniac meddlings of Hollywood, it is EXTREMELY faithful to the original books, right down to the dialogue.  It is also, by and large, well executed; although the gentleman playing the central character, Robert d'Artois, has a tendency to overact (possibly because of M. Druon's repeated characterisations of him as larger than life).

Unfortunately, it has two large strikes against it.

One, mentioned by other reviewers, is that there are no subtitles.  One has to wonder at the cause: indifference to foreign sales, arrogance (let them learn French), or simply laziness?

The other is that the entire thing is apparently shot in cheesy studio sets.  Even quite modest settings like council chambers are unconvincing.  I didn't expect a cast of thousands, but they can't even manage the forest scene where Philip the Fair collapses.

Even more irritating than the visuals, though, are the acoustics, which never change, whatever the scene.  Even when it's supposedly the streets of Paris, there are no background noises, nothing but the dialogue of the principals.

Can it have been done on a shoe-string budget?  A major production of a famous book by an Academician (as the titles do not neglect to tell us)?  Surely not.  Some comments on Amazon France attribute these characteristics to the age of the production (1972), but&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elizabeth-R/dp/B00005LC1D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elizabeth R</a>, from the same era, is far more professional.

However, this is comparing it with the very best.  By and large, the fine acting and the colourful characters and costumes make it more than worthwhile  if you speak French!  to catch this convoluted, fascinatingly true historic pageant of power, violence, love, hate, intelligence, stupidity, treachery, nobility, venality, and (of course) sex.

Incidentally, there are six (not seven) volumes of ""The Accursed Kings"" books in English, corresponding to the six episodes of the video:

If you read these first, you will be able to get through the videos with only schoolboy French.

The 7th book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quand-un-roi-perd-la-France/dp/2259001998/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quand un roi perd la France</a>&nbsp;(""When a King Loses France""), appears to have been a later addition, not filmed and not translated into English.

UPDATE 2007

I now gather that sets and costumes were deliberately kept minimal, to give the audience the feel of a small theatre production; fair enough (although I would have thought that a small theatre used cheap sets because it had too, not because it wanted to).

Also that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2005-remake/dp/B000I13K8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2005 remake</a>&nbsp;has realistic sets, CGI blood and guts, and (with the illustrious exception of Grard Depardieu) inferior acting (but still no English subtitles!).

I think I'll stick with the good acting.",1098489600,30,4348,7.648
8033242,5,B0002VLIOY,"I saw the series in Mexican TV many years ago. It was translated to Spanish. I wish I could find those videos. I supose the Mexican TV network translated them and filed them or returned them. They never sold them. I had also read ""Los Reyes Malditos"" (that is the title in Spanish)  by Maurice Druon. The series should have subtitles in other languages and not be only in French, so that those who do not speak French and are interested in the story of the Valois kings and the Kinghts Templars could understand it. The story is very well told and quite well documented. The costumes, settings and photography are incredible. They transport you to the France of those times.

If you understand French buy the DVD series. If not, at least read the books. The title in English is ""The Accursed Kings"" (in 7 volumes). The whole Valois dynasty and the French Aristocracy of the times is portrayed with all their pride,their flaws and their glory. The cruelty of Robert d'Artrois and his greedy aunt are shown in several chapters. At the end, King Philip, badly advised, has most of the Templars and thier Grat Master Mornay, killed and tortured in search of their alleged treasure which has never been found. Mornay while burning at the stake cursed Philip until the 13th generation and summoned him, Enguerrand de Marigny and the Pope to appear before the tribunal of God. All of which came to pass exactly as foretold. De Marigny, King Philip and the Pope died whithin  the next 12 months, and the dynasty was indeed cursed until the last Valois generation, the ill fated and depraved children of Katrine de Medicis and King Francis. Both the books and the DVD series are excelent work and I would recommend them to anyone who wants to learn history in an entretaining manner.",1094342400,8,1774,4.661341853035144
