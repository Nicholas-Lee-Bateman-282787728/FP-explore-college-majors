8009396,1,B0001AW0OI,"What a rip off.  I bought this DVD BECAUSE I was a guitarist and I wanted to learn how to play the tasty jazz licks from Reeling in the Years.  The instructor plays them and then says: those are the solo licks, but we're not going to learn to play them.  WHAT?  Instead he shows you how to play the rythmn parts and then the segment ends with him and some guy murdering the song.  Instead of wasting our time with some crappy performance, why not take the time to show us how to play the rest of the song.  It's obvious you KNOW how to play the solos so why not SHOW me what I paid money for.  I'm horribly DISAPPOINTED.  One of the worst instructional DVDs ever.",1253664000,7,663,4.0852713178294575
8009397,4,B0001AW0OI,"this is just as it states, ""gitar"" on Riki Don't loose that number and other 1972-74 heavy gitar songs.  If you have a gitar you will enjoy it if not you won't relate well.  Get Fagan's Tutorial instead.(and don't use a Casio).",1165104000,2,227,4.380952380952381
8009398,1,B0001AW0OI,"Do NOT buy this unless you are a musician interested in learning a couple of average songs. This DVD is NOT a concert,or performance of Steely Dan. Learn from my mistake. I'll take one for the team.",1094774400,39,198,4.378378378378378
8009399,1,B0001AW0OI,"This dvd is nothing more than a instructional vidio on how to play the guitar like steely dan. I got fooled by buying it,I hope nobody else does.  A.GOODWIN",1090800000,39,156,4.379310344827586
