4834926,5,B005MQ589U,Glad BET brought the Game back on television. It had a dark side to it but ended well. A must buy.,1329955200,,98,3.7142857142857144
4834927,5,B005MQ589U,"i have  been waiting to see the game season 4 for the longest! (i don't have cable) so i looked it up on amazon, and wht do ya knw, its on here! so i was super excited about my purchase and i watched it over n over and over. now waiting on season 5!",1329177600,2,249,3.611111111111111
4834928,5,B005MQ589U,"the series picks up 2 years after the last season and there are a lot of changes in the lives of the characters, but the drama and comedy are still there. tasha is managing derwin, malik is still as cocky as ever, jason is a sports commentator, kellie has her own reality series and melanie is still melanie...cute as ever, but always messing up something between her and derwin. the season is only a 2 disc and isn't as long as the previous seasons. has new faces and some other great actors and actresses and special guest appearances. season 4 just puts you on edge for season 5 which started 1/10/12. a must buy. you will enjoy.",1326672000,,632,4.410256410256411
4834929,5,B005MQ589U,"I bought this DVD and was very anxious to see it. I read several reviews before purchasing, and one review inparticular made me a little skeptical. I must say, I don't mind the changes at all, it is a show that was off the air for two years, I fell right back into watching it, and I didn't feel It missed a beat, of course some studio changes/homes have changed, but for the most part the characters personalites are the same and I love the show, I am glad BET/ put this out on Video..I am only diappointed that season 4 didn't have more episodes on the DVD, it was over too quick...I enjoy the story line, the drama, and the comedy.",1324512000,3,634,4.204918032786885
4834930,5,B005MQ589U,This forth season is pretty good. I knew from the beginning that their would be some changes to the show since it has been 2 years since the last episode and its on a different network. BET is not known for having sitcoms that last more than one season but i'm not surprised about this show lasting for a 5th season. Im a fan of the show and when this dvd comes out I will get it. I also watched every episode that came on tv back in january although after the 5th or so episode it was already getting boring but I mananged to keep watching all the way to the end of the season. I really don't like the writers of this new season but its been 2 years and the show was officially cancelled so I guess you have to make sacifices. I gave it 5 stars because I am a fan but hopefully the 5th season will be better.,1320796800,6,809,3.9693251533742333
4834931,5,B005MQ589U,Can't wait for this dvd to come out I know I wasn't happy with the direction of the show on BET because BET sucks however if you are true fan you wouldn't let it bother you to bad don't be a fair weather fan. We all knew it wouldn't be 100% the same come on now common sense.,1320192000,2,275,3.7586206896551726
4834932,1,B005MQ589U,"Since BET took over The Game...A LOT has changed. Physical appearances changed, characters were replaced (example: Jason & Kelly's daughter; Brittany), a lot of celebrity appearances were cliche' (example: Terrance J, Megan Goode). I understand it was supposed to be 2 years later & a new atmosphere was supposed to be placed around each character & that is Good & Fine to most but as an true Fan of Seasons 1-3; season 4 was a great disappointment & I stopped watching after the 3rd episode. I tried to give it a chance but it wasn't the same once it switched to BET, BET & their writers made major changes that changed the whole concept. I will not be buying this. Im sastisfied with Seasons 1-3.",1320019200,14,698,4.592
4834933,5,B005MQ589U,i love this show and all the people that starred in it. I can't wait for it to come out and into my collection. Also cannot wait for season five super exicted!!!!!!!!!,1319760000,2,167,4.25
4834934,1,B005MQ589U,This use to be a good show but now it has turned into some real housewives crap. they need to get new writers or at least get the writers of the first 3 seasons back!!!!!,1319414400,6,170,3.8857142857142857

4834945,5,B005MQ589U,"i bought it because i couldn't find the show online anywhere (hulu or netflix) since it switched over to BET. so i should be grateful that the network decided to keep it running but im not happy about how it doesnt integrate the show into any of the flexible streaming media sites.
anyhoo, i like the show in general so it was worth it to me to buy the dvd. i turned around and resold it after watching it.",1400457600,,406,4.151898734177215
