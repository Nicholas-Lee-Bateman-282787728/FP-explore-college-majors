6305270,4,B00IYLX5E0,"Long sought after and impossible to find, this 2007 ultra-low-budget horror film is finally available in its uncut director's version thanks to the fine folks at Unearthed Films. Even though the low budget shows throughout the film, director Marcus Koch keeps your attention throughout with plenty of blood and gore (especially in this new expanded version) about a circus clown unjustly accused of crimes and then going bonkers and begins a killing spree years later to get even with those involved (and their teenage children) with his incarceration. Lots of inventive kills and gore will satisfy gorehounds, while people looking to see how to properly make a film with no money can see how it is achieved. A very good film that surprises the viewer more than a few times. Highly recommended. Only the anemic budget stops me from giving this 5 stars, but don't let that stop you from purchasing this atmospheric little gem.",1410220800,3,925,4.974193548387097

8646441,3,B00IYLX5E0,"This one gets three stars in general but more as an independent underground horror film. It is for horrorhead gorehounds and lovers of low-budget film only, but is a feast according to our precepts. The tale of a psychotic clown (thankfully, a straight-up real killer and not some vague pseudo-ghost) on a rampage, it starts off with a relentless splatterfest as, wielding a huge meat cleaver, he descends on a Florida halfway house and graphically decimates all in his path. From that point the carnage never really lets up except for some spots that I'll get to in a moment. The gore here is sloppy and splashy and for that very reason effectively disturbing for horror enjoyment. The film itself has that grim B-movie look that works well in its favor. And the hulking, oddly somber actor playing the clown does a good job, giving sad little half-smiling looks to his victims before dispatching them that are a nice touch. In my modest opinion the flaw here is the side story involving two tabloid reporters' investigation of the murders. This is necessary in order to reveal the clown's motive and to give the film an entree for a second psychotic killer, but its LENGTH definitely is not. Its scenes just go on too long and could have all been cut by half, and their attempts at humor are mostly flat in my view. The actors are fine for a B movie, but their material was wanting. None of this amounts to a fatal detraction, though, and the movie builds to an all-out goreathon of a climax (BEGIN MILD SPOILER ALERT) and ends with a last scene of crushing justice that is rare in its finality and which had me cheering (END MILD SPOILER ALERT). All in all, a well-done, truly independent horror film that is highly recommended for the strong of stomach.",1461283200,,1757,4.634615384615385

100 Tears (2007)

Extended Directors Cut (2014)

Unearthed Films

Director: Markus Koch

Rating: 3/5

Receiving its original release back in 2007, 100 Tears has finally been released in an extended cut format with all of the kills and gore that were edited out. 100 Tears has achieved a cult status during that time, and rightly so. This is a brutal slasher with well edited gore effects that make for a very violent film.

Plot synopsis from Unearthed Films:

After being accused of crimes he did not commit, a lonely circus performer exacts his revenge on those who unjustly condemned him. The act sparks something inside of him which he cannot stop and now, years later, his inner-demons have truly surfaced. Part urban legend, part tabloid sensationalism he is now an unstoppable murderous juggernaut, fueled only by hate.

Going to the circus will never be the same!

100 Tears achieves everything films like Hatchet wish they could do. The gore is visceral and over the top and the script is humorous. This film has a high body count, upwards of 30 or more, and they never feel stale. The first time you see Gurdy the Clown in action, he makes his way on a rampage through a halfway house. The way the gore is edited, everything happens quickly and brutal compared to most low budget horror films. It feels like you are witnessing the violence in real-time.

100-tears-2

There is some good humor with genuine jokes. A large chunk of the humor comes from the abysmal acting and the over-the-top sound effects. Gurdys cleaver makes some noise. Even with plenty of humor, there are still a few tense moments. Gurdy is an unstoppable killing machine that is wet-your-pants imposing.

If you can get past the bad acting and the long drawn out plot elements, 100 Tears is one of the better slashers in recent memory. Gurdy is reminiscent of Rob Zombies take on Michael Myers in Halloween 2, the more brutal of the two Halloween films, even though this predates that film. He is brutal and terrifying in all of the right ways and makes this film the underground sensation it is known for.",1432512000,,2138,4.806010928961749
8646443,5,B00IYLX5E0,"It took me awhile to actually watch this DVD after I purchased it as I watch what I have DVRd first but as we know, the season finales are winding down so I took the opportunity to finally watch it.  First and foremost, at least in my personal opinion, there is a deranged killer clown with a cleaver in the movie just like the cover art on the DVD cover.  Yeah!!!!  I have made the mistake of buying a movie on the basis of the cover art alone sometimes and been very let down.  Secondly, this particular clowns' cleaver looks like it was made for Paul Bunyan.  It is huge.  For people like me who really like the gore, this is THE movie for us.  There is gore aplenty.  I think the acting was very good.  The characters were very real and interesting.  The last 60 seconds of this movie is a MUST WATCH so don't think of skipping the very end.  There is gore in this movie from beginning to end.  I did feel the FBI people in this movie were, how shall I put this, DUMB and lacking in their abilities.  This is a sure bet to buy, at least in my opinion.  I am a slasher movie freak and this movie gets an A+ from me.",1432512000,,1118,4.045662100456621
