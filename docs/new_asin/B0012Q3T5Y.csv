No there wasn't any of that either but it may have made this one a little more attractive to buyers or caused one to laugh out loud from reading it.",1435795200,,315,4.642857142857143
8247290,4,B0012Q3T5Y,"I found this particular Item at Fry's for $2.  I said what the heck.  I like NOTLD, I Like Horror, & I really do enjoy seeing a good documentary.  While not exactly a ""Good"" Documentary.  Come to think of it, it's not much of a ducumentary period.  What I will say is that having John Russo just dryly relating real life experiences to his films is interesting.
  This is one of those items that is made for a very small niche market.  While not for everybody, it is mildly inetresting",1433289600,,485,4.311111111111111
8247291,3,B0012Q3T5Y,"What is this?  I only bought it because it was cheap, the hot lady on the cover and its hosted by John Russo of NOTLD fame.  I thought it was going to be a documentary on the creatures in the title.  Instead, it was John Russo talking about the subject matter with scenes from his low budget movies starring witches, vampires and zombies.  Its like three extended trailers for Night of the Living Dead, Midnight and Dark Craving connected with brief comments by John Russo.  Its cheaply made and dated with a total run time of 40 minutes.  Was this some featurette for a DVD or something?  I have no idea, but its kind of interesting and I give it 3 stars for the great John Russo and the porno movie cover.",1417737600,,707,4.3106060606060606
8247292,4,B0012Q3T5Y,"I have to admit I bought this dvd for the sheer sake of the cover (at first) then after watching it and me being a huge total Horror head that I am, found it more and more interesting as I watched it, not as entertaining as the first time I had seen CREEPSHOW but still interesting. One reason in particular was it is hosted by John Russo ""and if you don't know who he is then may a zombie come into your bedroom tonight and eat you!"" no seriously he is the writer of Night Of The Living Dead and Return Of The Living Dead movies is that kool or what! There's several clips and scenes from feature films and even a short film you probably haven't seen yet? So to get to the Brains of the gray matter, *joke* I thought it was worth the money if you are a Horror enthusiast like me you will too. Now where is that remote, dim the lights, get the popcorn, sit down and relax and enjoy the show... Oh and don't forget to look behind you once in a while...he, he, he, he",1304985600,3,965,4.03125
