This first time I watched this movie it was in Mandarin and was excited to see it on amazon so that I could show it to my mom. Unfortunately, to my surprise it was in Cantonese and the subtitles were really difficult to see ( could it be any tinier?!) so my mom actually hard a hard time understanding what was going on.

The movie itself though is great.",1368835200,2,477,4.3
5458724,5,B00AN5LCV8,"I have to say this movie is pretty good,and Very Hart warming with great comedic scenes at the right spots.

The acting was really good by every one in the film but mostly Andy Lau (Actor)and Deannie Yip (Actor). That could be because Deannie Yip is Andy Lau's God Mother so they already have good chemistry together.

The Blu-Ray from Well Go USA is the way to go with the picture quality looking Pretty good and its at a low price.

I recommend this film

5458725,4,B00AN5LCV8,"Filmmaker Ann Hui as had a number of films that have resonated strongly with viewers.

Her films typically take on a subject that showcase a darker side of Hong Kong.  Films such as ""July Rhapsody"" (teacher/student relationship), ""Goddess of Mercy"" (justice), ""Night and Fog"" (murder) and ""All About Love"" (single mothers, same sex marriages).

With the film ""A Simple Life"", which was written by Susan Chan and Yan-lam Lee, Ann Hui takes on life and taking care of an older loved one who is sick.

One of the most recognizable things that Asian cinema fans will discover about Ann Hui's work is her ability to find the right talent to play the role of the main characters, in this case, Andy Lau (""Infernal Affairs"", ""House of Flying Daggers"", ""The Warlords"") and Deannie Yip (""Dragons Forever"", ""Crying Heart"").

""A Simple Life"" would win the Volpi Cup for Best Actress Award for Deannie Yip and the La Navicella Award for Anna Hui at the 68th Venice International Film Festival; winner for Best Director, Best Leading Actor and Best Leading Actress at the 48th Golden Horse Awards and was included in Roger Ebert's top 10 list for 2012.

VIDEO:

""A Simple Life"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio).  Shot with a Red One camera, where one will see this film look incredible is through the closeups.  From the facial details to overall textures of the clothing, you can see amazing detail.  Colors are warm and  I detected no banding or aliasing. Cinematography from Nelso Yu Lik-wai (""Still Life"", ""Dream Home"") was great when either capturing human emotion or frailty, Hong Kong during Chinese New Year.  If anything, this one of the most beautiful films from HK that I have seen on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""A Simple Life"" is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Dolby Digital 2.0.  As one would expect from a film such as ""A Simple Life"", there are times that not many words are said on screen.  It's about facial expressions during the quiet settings but the film is primarily dialogue driven with the exception of a brief fireworks scene that utilizes the surround and actually sounds fantastic.  But aside from that one scene, this is a dialogue driven film.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""A Simple Life"" come with the following special features:

JUDGMENT CALL:

Growing up with traditional Asian values in America, it was always ingrained by my grandfather at an early age that our responsibility was to take care of the family when they get older.

Watching ""A Simple Life"", the film was quite profound because it captured the essence of aging and frailty but also family.

In this case, a servant that has been with the family since a young age, taking care of four generations and as family have scattered around the world, the aging servant, Ah Tao, now stays with film producer, Roger.

Roger has been raised by Ah Tao and even at 70, she continues to cook, clean and shop for him, even take care of him and keep him healthy after having a heart attack.  But now, the roles are reversed and after Ah Tao suffers a stroke and wants to live in a nursing home, Roger makes sure that she knows family is nearby.  Even if it's just him, he wants to give back to the woman who had taken care of him.

She may not be of the same blood, but he regards her as close family.

And what I enjoy about this film is the contrast of how films about elderly are shown in America versus Hong Kong.  In America, we tend to see the banality of films of elderly abuse to a family disconnect and the loneliness that the elderly is facing.

While we do see that loneliness of various elderly in this film, its more of seeing things through the eyes of Ah Tao and a wonderful performance by actress Deanie Ip who communicates through eye movement and facial expression.

After suffering a stroke, Ah Tao is able to rehabilitate but while living at the senior home, it's that feeling that this is a place you are going to die, the people around you are also going to die very soon and it's all about time.

But unlike other seniors who suffer from Alzheimer's or dementia, Ah Tao still has quite a bit of life.  She is able to make friends but she enjoys the time that she spends with Roger, because he can joke with her, eat lunch or dinner with her and he brings her along to places, including a film premiere.

But it's the portrayal of Ah Tao that captivates the viewer.  She is a woman who has lived as a good servant.  Never the type to take gifts or even cash, she wants to pay things her own way and do it herself.  Granted, Roger takes care of the costs at the senior home because it's quite expensive but for Ah Tao, she is a woman who doesn't want to be a burden to Roger or the family.

She's a strong woman who is calling the shots of how her life is to be lived, no matter how hard it is for Roger and family who treated this woman like family to accept.

And we see that bond between Ah Tao and Roger as she spends time in the Senior home and seeing how she deals with loneliness or knowing that people around her will not be around that long.

As Deanie Ip is remarkable in this role, Andy Lau looks like a man who has never aged.  At 51, he still looks like he's 30-something.  But aside from the gun or sword-toting characters or the suave playboy or businessman roles that he tends to play, Lau plays the role of a caring man, a film producer but one that doesn't live like fame has changed him.  Still wearing a backpack and coat, he is often mistaken as a taxi driver or air conditioning repair employee, suffice to say, this is the most subdued role that he plays amazingly well.

For Asian cinema fans, also intriguing are the supporting actors and guest cameos in this film.  Anthony Wong, Angela Baby, Raymond Chow, Wing-Chiu Chan, Sammo Hung, Stanley Kwan, Chapman To, Hark Tsui, to name a few.

While I loved the film, there were a few scenes that probably could have been edited out as they served no true purpose (but to show more cameos), but for the most part, this is a very good film that I have found nothing negative to say about it.

The film reminds me a bit of my family who left behind servants because they moved to America but even to this day, my mother talked about the servants (the good ones) who took care of the family and how she visits or communicates with them today.

As for the Blu-ray release, the picture quality is fantastic and for Asian cinema from Well Go USA Entertainment, this is the best film I have seen on Blu-ray from the company in which detail was amazingly captured via Red One but also the cinematography is well-done and lossless audio is crisp and clear.  I wish there were more special features but considering many Asian cinema on Blu-ray (released in the U.S as of late.) rarely have them, at least a trailer was included.

Overall, ""A Simple Life"" is a profound film from director Anna Hui that captures the story of the elderly, aging and frailty but also human nature.  Featuring a fantastic performance by actress Deanie Ip, ""A Simple Life"" is a fantastic film that is worth owning on Blu-ray!",1364601600,2,7176,4.49537037037037
5458726,5,B00AN5LCV8,"I frequently visit two relatives in a nearby nursing home and constantly let them know how much I love them and appreciate what they did for me when I was younger. Such is the story of ""A Simple Life,"" where it's good to see an older person appreciated for the many things she gave to the family she served for decades! You will most likely wring out your emotions during this dedicated and forthright film.",1359504000,,407,4.44
5458727,5,B00AN5LCV8,"Ann Hui's 2011 Hong Kong film ""A Simple Life"" (""Tao jie"") is sweet, funny, poignant and above all real. Story-wise the film is pretty basic and predictable. What matters in this moving portrait of modern Chinese life is the two main characters you really care: an elderly woman called Ah Tao (Deannie Yip), who has been serving for the Leungs, a well-to-do family in Hong Kong for more than 60 years since she was 13, and Roger Leung (Andy Lau), the family's only son, working in the film industry.

Ah Tao has been taking care of Roger since he was a baby. With other family members scattered all over the world, Roger alone lives in Hong Kong. Ah Tao cooks and cleans for Roger living in a small apartment room, but when she has a stroke, she quits the job and enters a home for the elderly.

Based on the producer Roger Lee Yan-Lam's life, the deceptively simple story has a lot to offer, including keenly observed accounts of ordinary people. What makes this film special is the chemistry between the stars Deannie Yip and Andy Lau. Their rapport is so genuine and natural. Every small detail - including the gestures and silence of the characters - tells us about Ah Tao and Roger's mother-son-like relationship that is drawn affectionately. Nothing is sappy or sentimental. Everything in the film is so true to life, reminding us of someone close to us, or small events that you have almost forgotten.

The film also has many amusing cameos including Sammo Hung and Tsui Hark as ""film directors."" Anthony Wong and Chapman To, stars of ""Infernal Affairs,"" both briefly appear as the home's owner and a dentist respectively. You will see familiar faces like Lan Law and Angela Baby (very briefly), as well as Hong Kong film producer Raymond Chow.

In short, ""A Simple Life"" is a touching drama with a theme that everyone can relate to, describing the way life goes on, with some gentle laughs and genuine insight.",1355011200,5,1917,4.679525222551929
5458728,5,B00AN5LCV8,"Directed by Ann Hui, A Simple Life (Tao Jie) is a film based on the true story of a woman who worked her entire life as a servant for the family of Hong Kong film producer Roger Lee (who co-wrote the script with Susan Chan), looking after Lee in particular from childhood to adulthood with such affection and devotion that when she suffered a stroke in her later years, Lee and his family reversed their roles and looked after her.

The film begins with Roger Leung (Andy Lau), an accountant in the film industry, who lives in an apartment in Hong Kong with an elderly woman he calls Ah Tao (Deanie Ip), a servant who has worked for his family since before he was even born and now works for him personally. He is leaving on an overnight trip for a business meeting on a new film project and they discuss what she should cook for him while he's gone. When he says he wants ox tongue, a particular favorite dish of his, she chidingly reminds him that he's supposed to be avoiding fatty foods, to which he responds by reminding her that she eats things she shouldn't even though she's supposed to be watching her cholesterol.  After he leaves, Ah Tao begins preparing the requested dish anyway.  The scene quickly establishes that the relationship between the two is one of long acquaintance, almost familial in the level of informal familiarity displayed.

When Roger returns from his trip however, he finds Ah Tao collapsed on the floor.  He calls an ambulance and gets her to the hospital, where they determine that she's had a stroke and will need extensive care and rehabilitation.  Suddenly the structure of their lives is disrupted.  Ah Tao, who has never been dependent on anyone and has always looked after others, at first stubbornly insists that she should retire and move to a retirement home.  And that she can pay her own way. But Roger knows that this is impossible and takes over, first finding a nursing home for her close to the apartment and the neighborhood she is familiar with.  In a fortunate twist of fate, the nursing home turns out to belong to an old friend (Anthony Wong), a former actor who went into the nursing home business after he got too old for action films.

A lot of the film deals with how Ah Tao adjusts to the changes forced on her by her stroke, starting with living in the nursing home where nothing is familiar and she doesn't know anyone, and where she's dependent on others for things she used to do for herself. And then going through rehabilitation for her stroke, having to relearn how to do the most basic things.  Deanie Ip gives a compelling performance, showing Ah Tao's anxieties at her new situation mainly with her eyes and her body language as she warily takes in her surroundings and the strangers she now lives with. I can't recall ever seeing a movie that more realistically depicts this experience, particularly from the point of view of the person going through it, and this alone would make A Simple Life well worth seeing.  But there's far more to the film, which makes it all the more compelling.

Ann Hui's director's touch is very subtle, showing bonds of affection and compassion but never descending into cheap sentimentality.  And never flinching away from the hard parts, which you instinctively know are coming.  There's no musical score in the background to set any kind of artificial mood, there's only what you see unfolding on the screen.  The film progresses like a series of snapshots, slices of life strung together.  Ah Tao, on her first night at the nursing home, getting up and making her way to the restroom with difficulty but determined to do it on her own, then going from stall to stall to find one she deems clean enough. Roger suddenly having to do his own laundry for the first time in his life, having to read a manual to learn how to use the washing machine. A bunch of Roger's friends from high school come over to the apartment to share the ox tongue Ah Tao had prepared, reminisce about all the different delicious dishes she'd fixed for them back in those days, then impulsively call her at the nursing home, singing to her through Roger's cell phone.  Ah Tao coming back to visit the apartment and the first thing she does is to check for dust that's accumulated in her absence, tutting disapprovingly.

The nursing home, initially bleak, cramped and alien, gradually takes on moving depth as Ah Tao gets to know the other residents, each of whom has a story of their own. One old woman has been there for over twenty years, through three changes of ownership, and has not once had a visitor.  A daughter visits her mother there, always ending up arguing because her mother signed everything over to her favored son - who never visits - but it's her daughter who's ended up having to pay the bills.  An older woman turns out to be a visitor coming to see her much younger daughter who's in the nursing home because of a debilitating medical condition.  A former headmaster's mind tends to wander unfocused but he quotes long passages from poetry and literature with ease. And last but far from least, an older man called Uncle Kin (Paul Chun), determined to hang on to every last bit of vitality he possesses, singing and dancing around... and always cadging money off of the other residents and even their visitors so he can sneak out and have a quickie with a young woman. And yet for all his clownish hustling, it's Uncle Kin who ends up making one of the most touching gestures in the film.

But a lot of what makes A Simple Life work is the portrayals of Andy Lau and Deanie Ip.  Lau's Roger and Ip's Ah Tao have a lot of resonance and you can feel the things that bond them together.  Ah Tao was an  orphan when she began working for the Leung family and so has never had a family of her own beyond the one she's worked for all her life.  And Roger is the only member of his family still living in Hong Kong, the rest having apparently emigrated to the US where they now live in San Francisco.  Both of them are in a very real sense alone, and it is only with each other that they feel at ease.  And when Roger visits Ah Tao at the nursing home and the people there comment that he is a dutiful nephew or godson, it's telling that he does not correct their impression.  The naturalness that Lau and Ip bring to the relationship between Roger and Ah Tao comes from the fact that the actors have worked together many times over the years, and that Ip is Lau's real-life godmother.

A Simple Life doesn't moralize, or attempt to make any big points, or relate any grand tale.  If anything, it's a kind of mosaic, reminding us that a life, any life, is composed of a lot of little pieces, and that it's all those pieces that make a life what it is.  Highly, highly recommended.",1340668800,25,6774,4.503673469387755
5458729,2,B00AN5LCV8,"Although this film has received some honors, and was a good storyline, I felt there was something missing.  The film is about a man whose family maid of many years becomes ill and is ready for the nursing home.  He decides to caretake her, visiting the home, and being company to her.

What I missed was an emotional connection to the film.  I felt there was not enough to show us that she was a family maid for years.  That connection was not there, or rather not presented so we can feel that bond.  The intention was there, not completely foreign to us to have a young man care for an elderly ""friend"", etc.  So, it lacked something.

When you can watch a film in its entirety, and not feel something, then you walk away with nothing.  A film has to grab your emotions, make you feel it, and this one lacked that.  Rizzo",1425600000,3,823,4.285714285714286

5458734,5,B00AN5LCV8,"This is perhaps the best of the films shown at Ebertfest, 2014.  A small, sweet film based on a true story, it concerns an aging servant of a Hong Kong family.  She works for a film producer and shares his tiny apartment.  In the past she functioned as a nanny to the young man and now, as she approaches death, he is taking care of her.  The world of the film is heavily circumscribed.  We learn little of the man's experience beyond the family circle, though we learn that he has undergone angioplasty for a heart condition and he must now watch his diet.  This is difficult for him, because his nanny is a superb cook and some of her specialties are cholesterol-laden.  The plot consists of a series of scenes that involve role-reversal, as he takes care of her as her health deteriorates.  The film is not sad, however, and it is certainly not melodramatic or sentimental.  It is sweet and loving and the direction (by Ann Hui) is superb.  This is a small masterpiece.  The camera work is very special, particularly in the different paces achieved when we see the man, Roger, relating to the servant, Ah Tao, and the scenes in which he is relating to his male colleagues in the film industry.  The individual performances are excellent.  Deannie Yip came out of retirement to play the role of Ah Tao and Andy Lau is, as David Bordwell pointed out, the George Clooney of Hong Kong (except that Lau can act far better).  The film also includes cameo appearances by a series of Hong Kong directors, Ann Hui's estimable colleagues.  Highly recommended.",1398902400,,1552,4.592727272727273

8554524,5,B00AN5LCV8,"My wife found this movie at a local bigbox store on a discount and we decided to purchase it based on the back story of the disk holder. We love the based on true stories and we knew that it was a topic that would be hard for us to approach in that we did not know what to expect given our own recent events with aged family. For our backstory, my wife's mother moved in with us this year due to failing health and we dealt with the same topic as the movie covered.....death......dying.......family issues......loneliness.......and our duty to honor the lady/men that do/have done so much for all of us.

I think that this film was much harder for me than it was my wife. I was with her every step of the way with her mother and I saw this in her. But this film portayed that love in such a sweet way. It was the subtle and gentle way that you see that love portrayed in this film and that it truly is what real world love is all about....sacrifice. He did not forget Ah in the home. He went for her. He sacrificed for her. It was awkward for him but he still did it in her time of need.....She looked and waited for him yet wanted nothing of him to embellish over her.......just seeing him and being a part of the family.

This movie is a sweet and tender tear jerker with very funny moments inserted to break it up and show that we are all connected by the same human drive.....e ant love and affection regardless of our age or disposition or state. Its a little slow and you will have to read subtitles but even our 10yo daughter watched it with us(as she also went through the dying process of seeing her grandmother pass in our home), and it kept her interest. This movie is a raw, genuine, sincere, subtle, true version of life.....

I was also surprised to see how this foreign film dealt with the spiritual aspect of the dying process as well. Was not overt or covert but still addressed it as it is something that most everyone goes through.

Will be recommending this to my friends who like movies off the beaten path. Very artistic and very well worth the $3 we paid for it elsewhere.",1444953600,,2095,4.269521410579345
