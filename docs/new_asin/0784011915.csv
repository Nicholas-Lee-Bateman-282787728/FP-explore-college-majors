73496,5,0784011915,"For those of you who enjoy European comedies, this is an excellent choice! Adjusting to the accents takes a little work, but once you've got it down, the movie sails along, cracking you up all the way. I found it much funnier  and more entertaining than ""Full Monty"" which got rave reviews.  I'd put it more along the lines of ""Waking Ned Devine"" in the  humor department, though obviously more hard edged. Highly recommended!",950054400,12,426,4.72972972972973
73497,5,0784011915,"The only problem with this film was the inappropriate comparison to the Full Monty that is on the video box.  This is a film with nothing in common with the Full Monty, other than the fact that both are very good movies.
Definitely worth renting, and I'll buy this as soon as it hits normal  prices.",931392000,3,299,4.321428571428571
7790798,5,0784011915,"Very enjoyable.  Reminds me of In Bruges, but funnier.",1492128000,,54,5.0
7790799,4,0784011915,I stumbled on this quite by accident but gave it a go as I like Brendan Gleeson.  Very entertaining and the humour reminded me of In Bruges.,1444176000,,140,4.185185185185185
7790800,5,0784011915,"A sadly unknown film that's a great story woven with funny and fallible characters. A crime story about a pair of men who really don't have any business being involved in a life of crime. If you're a fan of film, this is something that deserves to be watched, and shared with your friends.",1441843200,,289,4.37037037037037
7790801,5,0784011915,"Love, love, love this movie. I have been waiting for years for a DVD. Snappy and often hilarious dialog, brilliant acting including the late great actors Tony Doyle and Peter McCaffrey, and the bogs and back roads of bleak but beautiful Ireland combine to make this a jewel of a little movie.",1441238400,,292,4.634615384615385
7790802,5,0784011915,"Brilliant.

Witty Script.
Cast.
Great story.
Now that Brendan Gleeson is finally being recognized as one the most respected actors of our time, this will get a DVD release in short time.
Won't it?",1439164800,,196,4.764705882352941
7790803,5,0784011915,"Good little low-key flick with an excellent ensemble cast. Besides the always steady Brendan Gleeson as Bunny and Peter McDonald as Git, the cast also includes two stars of the series ""Ballykissangel"", Tony Doyle & Peter Caffrey, who have both passed on.
However, whoever is responsible for the comment on the cover ""If you liked 'The Full Monty', you'll love 'I Went Down'"" needs to have their goolies kicked in. That comparison with ""The Full Monty"" is perfect fodder for the jerks who love to stereotype (us) Yanks as stupid & shallow. Of course, maybe somebody will rip this off for Broadway, ala TFM, ""Billy Elliot"", and ""Spamalot""(of course, ""Jerry Springer"" was on stage in London's West End well before it came to the US)",1270857600,,729,4.84
7790804,4,0784011915,"The ANZ-produced DVD conclude a feature and scene selections, presenting a quality of colors usual for digitally re-mastered old films.

There is something romantic in this story of mere crime and extortion where greed, need for money and family affairs are inextricably linked.

Perhaps, ordinarily actions themselves, simplicity of lacking Hi-Tech tricks brings about some lyrics in criminals' affairs peppered with otherwise rude language and sex urges with same gender affairs (""brotherly friendship""?) in the air.

Simple life of advancing Ireland's crims the short description is.",1248220800,2,586,5.790697674418604
7790805,4,0784011915,"Ditto all the great reviews here. I saw this when it came out, but why isn't it out on DVD? The top-grossing Irish film of 1998 can't catch a break from the distributors here. What a pity.",1187568000,4,188,4.108108108108108
7790806,4,0784011915,"I happened to see ""I went down"" on French cable TV and loved it.  I guess you would categorize it as a comedy crime caper movie. A triumph of underplaying by Peter McDonald. The best thing is the dialogue, sharply observed, offbeat and deadpan. Paddy Breathnacht delivers the story in a series of chapters with witty titles. Seemingly pointless snippets of dialogue are unforgettable:

GIRL: Do you ever talk?

GIT: yer...

GIRL: What sort of things do you say?

GIT: I say things like, shall we go to the shops?...

Or the conversation between Bunny and Git about America...wonderful!

Brendon Gleeson's part is very similar to his role in ""the General"".

Having searched unsuccessfully for DVD version, I had to order a second hand VHS from a store in the US, fortunately it works find on my (French) multistandard vhs player.",1165449600,2,828,4.822695035460993
7790807,5,0784011915,I`m not usually a movie fan but this is brilliant. I think Frank Grogan (Peter Caffrey) stole the show as he played brilliantly the role of the worlds most talkative hostage!  Brendan Gleeson and Peter McDonald also put  up excellent displays. By far the funniest scene as pointed out below is  when Bunny and Git are breaking into the house in the forest. I nearly wet  myself with laughter at that scene!,962496000,5,406,4.597222222222222
