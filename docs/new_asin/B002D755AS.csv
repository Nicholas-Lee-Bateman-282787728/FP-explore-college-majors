Would recommend, great as a halloween gift.",1351382400,,131,4.695652173913044
3909799,1,B002D755AS,"My review has nothing to do with the style of the show.  I like both the more modern versions of the Berenstain Bears and the older 1980's version.  The episodes are fine if you are just interested in adding to your Berenstain Bear DVD collection, but my problem is that I don't think the word ""Halloween"" is mentioned in a single episode.  None of the episodes are really tied into Halloween at all.  Sure there are some episodes with pumpkins, haunted houses, ghosts, and bats, but so what, they don't involve costumes, trick or treating, or even a single mention of the holiday that this collection of episodes is supposed to celebrate.  If you want a Berenstain Bear's Halloween special, look elsewhere, this is not the collection of episodes you want.",1317513600,2,756,4.740458015267175
3909800,5,B002D755AS,"I have reviewed several Berenstain Bears DVDs.  We have all of them (at least, of the ones you can order here on Amazon).  We prefer the newer DVDs to the 80's episodes.  BUT.  My children love these older ones, too.  They may be different, but they're STILL extremely good.  I remember them from when I was little.

I get rather upset that people complain about these older DVDs.  If you truly love the Berenstain Bears, I don't see why you can't embrace both.  True, the 80's version may be a bit dated, but the lessons are still there for all to see.  Talk about good, wholesome entertainment for your children.  Old version or newer, there's always good moral lessons to be learned.",1297728000,8,686,4.540983606557377
3909801,2,B002D755AS,"Our 5-year-old loves the Berenstain Bears books and since it's getting close to Halloween, I thought I'd take a chance on this video when I saw it in the grocery store.  Boy, am I dissappointed!  Not all the stories are Halloween related.  But what bothers me most are how the cubs are parentified, Papa Bear looks like a fool most often and even Mama Bear isn't her usual wise self.  The plots are a little twisted and harder for younger children to follow/process.  Plus some of the new adult characters aren't very appealing. Perhaps there are better Berenstain Bear videos out there...more appropriate ones.",1285372800,,611,4.836538461538462
3909802,5,B002D755AS,"Here we have the Saturday Morning version of Bererstain Bears run in 1980s on CBS. I am sure many a 80s child can remember this show greeting us while eating our cereal back when Saturdays were must see tv to a child.

The other reviews have been harsh and that's only because they expected this to be the PBS version airing in this decade. The only thing I can agree with somewhat is this dvd and the other Sony Wonder versions should clearly list on the front as this being "" The Berenstain Bears 1980s edition. "" In that way it can be clear to everybody. The only way you can tell this is the 80s version is by looking on the back credits and it states 1986 copyright. Now I don't know if it's deliberate on Sony's part to entice new Bererstain Bears fans to buy these too but I think there are a great many Bererstain Bears fans for the 80s version who would buy this.

Well in my case I actually have been waiting for the 1986 version to make it on dvd, the voices are great unlike some other review said here, any 80s animation lover will recognize these voices being in other 80s cartoons as well. This version was animated by Southern Star Operations which might not be all too familiar to some but they were a subsidiary of Hanna Barbara based in Australia and they also animated The Teen Wolf cartoon and CBS Storybreak, two other greats from the 1980s.

Now onto the content, you get 7 segments totaling 84 minutes. There use to be two segments making up one whole show when it first aired so in this case you are getting like 3 whole shows and a half for a decent price. The shows have opening and end credits intact just like they use to air. I hadn't seen this show since it first aired and I wondered if it still would be fun to watch and I have to say it still holds up well and I can say children of today can appreciate it too, maybe if they're too hooked on the new version they may not like it as kids are fussy like that but if you're a kid who grew up in 1980s this might just be the version you'd rather your children watch today as it has all the lessons and fun intact to enjoy.

This can be a fun treat to watch at Halloween time and really it can viewed any time of year. The shows which are on this dvd are as follows:

1. The Bat cave
2. The Spookiest Pumpkin
3. The Trojan Pumpkin
4. The Missing Pumpkin
5. The Wicked Weasel Spell
6. Bust a Ghost
7. The Spooky Old Mansion

If you like this cartoon you might also consider buying the Raggedy Ann and Andy 1980s version dvds as well, that show holds up very well. Keep the 80s rocking, buy 80s!",1283385600,21,2573,4.136
3909803,5,B002D755AS,The product was in great shape as stated by the Seller and was promptly delivered. Would buy again from this seller.,1277164800,2,116,4.571428571428571
3909804,1,B002D755AS,I thought this was the Halloween show that shows currently on PBS which it isn't.  Voices are different - kids noticed that tree house was different...not the same quality as the current shows.,1255305600,3,193,4.848484848484849
3909805,2,B002D755AS,"Our five year old son is a huge fan of the Berenstain Bears tv show and has been for the past few years, so when I saw this dvd was being released I went ahead and ordered it for him.  He was thrilled to receive it, but not so thrilled when he watched it.  He's used to the newer BB shows that you see on pbs/sprout in the evenings, and this one is not really like them at all.  There are seven 'episodes' over the 84 minute dvd, and so far we've watched the first four - - not impressed at all!  I'll be surprised if my son ever asks to watch this one again.

Papa Bear acts like a total fool most of the time and Mama Bear keeps saying ""Oh Papa!"" more out of frustration and disappointment than affection.  The adults come across as being (shall I say it?) IDIOTS.  In the very first episode there's a scam artist in the town that's clearly up to no good and the cubs are the only ones to see it so they have to step into action to save all the adults.  Who wants to buy a show for their kids that portrays any adult as a fool? In another episode Papa Bear is acting almost neurotic about carving a pumpkin for a contest and then treats everyone with major suspicion and distrust - even his neighbors and his own family.  The biggest problem - they never truly resolve those issues or show anyone learning their lesson like they do in the newer BB shows.

I could go on further, but the bottom line is: If you were a fan of the older BB shows then you may like this.  If you're a fan of the newer ones, skip this one altogether.  Trust me.",1251936000,15,1541,4.032894736842105

8364823,5,B002D755AS,"Can't go wrong with the Berenstain Bears. I definitely do notice the difference between the older/newer versions, as the story-lines, characters, and voices vary slightly, but our granddaughter likes them just the same - the auto-play feature (on many of them) is nice too.",1444694400,,273,5.2272727272727275
8364824,2,B002D755AS,"Generally speaking, we are big Berensatin Bear fans. This DVD was fair, but we were very disappointed in the content. The cover and title are very misleading. There does not appear to be an episode about trick-or-treating as we expected based on the cover and title.",1440892800,4,266,4.804347826086956
