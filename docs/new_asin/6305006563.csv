I've seen bad  movies before.  Some you can't help but enjoy, because despite their  inherent badness, there's an earnestness to them or perhaps even a sense of  fun.  This has none of it.  Scripted by Joe Eszterhas (who could be called  the worst screenwriter in Hollywood were it not for the dedicated efforts  of Akiva Goldsman to grab the title), it's supposed to be a funny,  insider's take on the underside of Hollywood, ala ""The Player"",  but it fails miserably despite the talents of some very funny people like  Richard Jeni and Eric Idle.
The film received a record 9 Razzie  nominations (the Razzies are the annual alternative to the Oscars,  ""dishonoring"" the worst in film) including 4 nominations for  Eszterhas.
In the long run this film is worth adding to your collection  only if you are a true connoiseur of bad cinema and feel a need to have the  worst movie of the century on your shelves.  Otherwise beware of this film.  Playing it for your friends may well get you in trouble with Amnesty  International as making anyone sit through this can only be regarded as an  act of torture.",921542400,5,1374,4.563786008230453

7880298,5,6305006563,"Although I find it difficult to believe people wouldn't get it.
I think the reason it got so many razzies was because the portrayal of hollywood was too jaded.  I think that we fear that our most cynical view of hollywood is too cynical.  Remember the old saw about people who like sausages and politics should never watch either being made?  Maybe the same is true of movies, and with this movie, you're too close to the magic to appreciate it.",1074124800,,445,4.469135802469136
7880299,4,6305006563,I was very pleased with the video and I received it very fast!!  Would buy from this seller again!! :),1029974400,2,102,4.1
7880300,1,6305006563,"Badly written, badly cast, badly acted, badly directed - it's all here.  And the embarrassing cameos don't help.  At all.  One would be hard pressed to pick out the worst of the bunch; Whoopi or Weinstein?  Would've been way better if Billy Barty had Ryan O'Neal's role though.
However, there's this 'inspirational' line in there somewhere: ""If we believe in film - and we do - then don't we have the responsibility to protect the world from bad ones?""  Indeed.
Too bad the film makers didn't take it to heart.",1006041600,8,510,4.622222222222222
7880301,3,6305006563,"Funny at some parts, very witty too. Alan Smithee (Eric Idle) has just made the biggest Hollywood Picture ever starring Jackie Chan, Whoopi Goldberg, and Sylvester Stallone. But when Smithee kind of goes crazy the  film doesn't come out and it makes a lot of people mad. This is the story  of that. Has a lot of potential, this movie that is, but doesn't quit live  up to it. Very funny in some parts, then it lags and get's annoying in  others. If you liked ""Waiting for Guffman"" and could stand and  liked Julia Sweeny's ""God Said 'Ha'"". Then this is your movie,  otherwise, let it go by.",960508800,2,590,4.416666666666667
7880302,1,6305006563,"Got a chance to read a script of ""An Alan Smithee Film"" a couple of years back. Funny, funnier, funniest. Not much plot, but funny, believable, outlandish circumstances. Joe Eszterhas  lays some Hollywood realism on the  line for us all to enjoy.
Too bad funny on the page doesn't necessarily  transfer to funny on the screen. Eric Idle: not funny, Richard Jeni: less  than not funny, and Ryan O'Neal: torturously cruel and inhuman.
Sandra  Bernhard as someone's wife? Always funny.
The  little cameos aren't even  cute, although you gotta appreciate the irony of Gavin Polone's appearance.  Too bad Michael DeLuca wasn't available.
Coulda, woulda,  shoulda...translates to better ways to spend your time.",949622400,9,705,5.223214285714286
7880303,5,6305006563,I loved this film.  It makes a lot of  fun of the movie industry.  It is not about the story  but more about subtle and funny gags to keep you watching.  The cast is among the best  I have seen in a long time.  Rent it  today.,928713600,,226,3.6595744680851063
7880304,5,6305006563,"i am a HUGE fan of Monty Python and when my friend Bob (a GIANT movie fan) and i saw a movie starring Eric Idle, we flipped and instantly rented it.  We loved it.  It was hilarious and i especially enjoyed the biography-like  format.  i really liked the guest performances of Coolio and Chuck D.  When  i saw that i ""won"" the razzie award for worst movie, i vowed  never to listen to the advice of the razzies again.",921974400,,416,4.189873417721519
