7667731,5,B01BTDOSSG,"Cinema viewing is fun but this is a DVD to own for additional viewing repetition. Got to admit I am a DVD stalker of Dame Maggie Smith. Shes good in any role. The world noticed due to Downton Abbey, but thats just a drop in the bucket. She is her usual perfection in this film about a recluse, homeless, almost a bag lady, but actually an ex-pianist, former nun-wanna-be, and past psychiatric patient that takes up residence in her van parked in a residential street. Shes invited to pull it into a drive, for a short spell (proving excessively long, by years). The driveway belongs to Alan Bennett, a playwright, played about as brilliantly as Maggie plays the old lady, Miss Shepherd, by Alex Jennings (Cranford; The Queen). These two exhibit chemistry of a non-romantic nature, for sure. Of course its drama with comedy, and Maggie Magic. A Maggie-Must-Own.

Maggie Smith, fresh off her dominance in Downton, and Marigold Hotel series, shows she can play any role and entice viewers to truly love even a downtrodden character. A theme of tolerance for the less privileged comes out of a real event, written by the man who experienced the events in his own drive. And this is not Maggies first go with the story, she performed the story on stage also. The films shot on THE London location, the actual driveway. Wow, a reality film. Its a sundae sweet experience. Maggie Smith is not just the cherry topper, but the hot fudge, the cold cool base, plus the nutty topping.

And treat yourself to another, Quartet, starring Maggie Smith and more, with Dustin Hoffman directing. Senior finesse at its finest.
PG-13 and 1  hours long. Youll wish for more.",1459382400,79,1652,4.729166666666667
7667732,5,B01BTDOSSG,"The film is based on a true story, shot on location where the event happened.

Margaret T. Fairchild (Maggie Smith) aka Mary, is an elderly woman who lived in her van. In the opening scene, which is dark, there is an accident, one in which she runs from. She ends up in Camden Town and in the yard of playwright Alan Bennett (Alex Jennings). Bennett separates himself into two people, the author, and the individual who deals with the stubborn woman in the van.

As the film progresses, the glimpses we get of her younger life fill in, as we discover this is an educated woman, who is accomplished, and whose life is now being wasted. Alan constantly contrasts her to his own mother, in a home who doesn't remember him.

But it is not a sad story. Maggie Smith gives us a delightful performance of a quirky woman with hygiene issues.

7667733,3,B01BTDOSSG,"""Starting out as someone incidental to my life, she remained on the edge of it so long she became not incidental at all."" Alan Bennett (Jennings) is a writer that lives alone and keeps to himself. Miss Shepherd (Smith) is a nice old lady who lives in a fan, she parked in front of his house one day, and never left. What started off as an inconvenience for Alan soon changed and a friendship began. This is not a bad movie at all and the acting is great but this is not a movie for everyone. I will say that, being American, this movie is super British. That's not a bad thing but a lot of the dialog and interaction was a little hard to follow because of the words used. That aspect aside, the fact that this is based on a true story makes this a little more fun to watch. Smith is great as always but, for me at least, the total British-ness was a little overpowering at times. I'm sure many American movies have the same effect for them too though. Overall, good and worth seeing, but not for everyone. I give this a B-.",1457654400,18,1023,4.171717171717172

The acting skills, the casting, the script, director, wardrobe, cinematographers, everything about this is worth sitting through.

7667746,3,B01BTDOSSG,"I liked the humanity of this film.  Here was a woman that was haunted by a terrible event in her life.  The PTSD she suffered, she suffered alone.  She found a decent human being and they forged a relationship over many years.  The relationship was probably a surprise to both.  The film plot had too many cutaways for me.  It chopped into the flow of the story that was being told.  I am glad that I watched it, but believe that it could have been so much more.  Oh, and I also appreciate that it didn't seem candy-coated, or preachy.  This was respectful of the persons of whom the film was based upon, and the audience.  Good for a conversation starter on matters of importance.  Suitable for preteens and teens with parental guidance.

Maggie Smith is okay. I did not fit her as witty as I thought she would have been. She is on the run from the law and lives in her van. Doesn't wash and squats in the neighborhood in her broken down van. The neighbors are charitable towards her as she becomes part of their community. She dies, they find out more of her history and the writer writes a book about his experience with her. A very LONG almost 2 hours. I suggest skipping it.

7667789,5,B01BTDOSSG,"This is Maggie Smiths performance of a lifetime, as the aged Mary Shepherd, a homeless, quick-witted, cantankerous woman, who bullies her way into the life and driveway of writer Alan Bennett (Alex Jennings). Their temporary contract lapses into 15 years, as Margaret commandeers and degentrifies this tony North London neighborhood.  The script is smart and honest, and not at all shy of detail, including the scatalogical.  The action and exchanges between the pair are nimble, sometimes touching, often accompanied by real or feigned acrimony, and funny.  Their evolving mutual enlightenment is striking.  Bennetts writing is wonderfully witty and incisive.  As an inveterate jotter-down of inspired words and phrases, I had some goodies to save with this one.  All filmmaking disciplines are first-rate and in synchrony: Bennetts writing, Hytners direction, Dunns cinematography with Anwars editing, and Fentons score.  I like the split-screen element, juxtaposing the writer Bennett with the man-in-life Bennett.  Jennings is great, and Smiths performance is stunning, exquisitely nuanced, while still disarmingly natural. The important social issue is present, but by framing it in a personal context and enrobing it in brainy, still amusing, dialogue, the message is heard.  I love this film and definitely recommend it.",1512259200,,1327,5.661616161616162

I think this is a 'good' movie to show to older people so they can identify with being active, engaged in life, etc.  Even younger people like this actress, of course.

The government didn't help, the Catholic Church harmed her so much, a policeman bribed her for years when she really had nothing.  This is a mostly true story it says.  She had so little support and people thought she was rude?  I would be rude too. Buying her a new van simply keeps her where she is.  The story never said where her car came from. The author helped very little and often said he didn't care.  I found this movie so shocking, the ratings really are very poor at 5 stars at 50% but even that I can't believe.

7668160,5,B01BTDOSSG,"We've grown accustomed to the sight of the titular lady in our film as the Dowager Countess of GranthamHer Ladyship indeed. As a lady of a different sort, she continues to engage with her talent. Maggie Smith portrays The Lady In The Van.

Miss Shepherd lives in her van. It's the sort of van that when Miss Shepherd chooses a neighborhood in which to park, the residents might offer some kindnesswhich Miss Shepherd disparages even when the kindness involves something she wants to eatbut they pray Miss Shepherd will move on.

The van is . . . how shall I put it? . . .  unattractive, and foul smelling, as is Miss Shepherd.

Playwright and recipient of Miss Shepherd's largess because she parks the van at his house, Alan Bennett, begins the film this way:

[first lines]
Alan Bennett: [typing] The smell is sweet, with urine only a minor component, the prevalent odor suggesting the inside of someone's ear. Dank clothes are there, too, wet wool and onions, which she eats raw. Plus, what for me has always been the essence of poverty, damp newspaper. Miss Shepherd's multi-flavored aroma is masked by a liberal application of various talcum powders, with Yardley's Lavender always a favorite. And currently it is this genteel fragrance that dominates the second subject, as it were, in her odoriferous concerto.
[walking down the hallway]
Alan Bennett: But as she goes, the original theme returns, her own primary odor now triumphantly restated and left hanging in the house long after she has departed.

Flashbacks appear throughout the film so we learn why Miss Shepherd lives in a van, and why she believes she's on the run for a crime she committed.

I particularly like the ""split"" personality of Alan Bennett. He is two characters: Alan Bennett the writer who sees a possible story in Mary Shepherd, and Alan Bennett who lives in a house and wavers between kindness to Miss Shepherd and disgust at the way she lives, which includes an elaborate system for dealing with urine and feces.

The two Alan Bennetts (both played Alex Jennings) chat and argue with one another.

The Lady In The Van is filled with clever dialog that makes me chuckle:
Rufus: Sorry, you can't park here.
Miss Shepherd: No, I've had guidance. This is where it should go.
Rufus: Guidance? Who from?
Miss Shepherd: The Virgin Mary. I spoke to her yesterday. She was outside the post office.
Rufus: What does she know about parking?

Jehovah's Witnesses: [at the front door] Good afternoon. Does Jesus Christ dwell in this house?
Alan Bennett: No. Try the van...

Maggie Smith and Alex Jennings are lovely in The Lady In The Van, which earns The Janie Junebug Seal of Highest Approval

Note: The real Alan Bennett is a writer and he shares in this film the story of his ""relationship"" with Mary Shepherd.",1472947200,,2785,4.779166666666667

With that --- this movie is charming and delightful even though the reality of the situation is very real and very sad. But not sad when you realize that you accept the reality that you are now living in ----- a van. It's main impact on me is that someone --- who would probably never consider doing what he did --- let her park her van in his driveway for a few months ---- that lasted 15 years!!!!!  The thing is: I understand her plight. No home, no family, no place to live -- except in her van and hopefully in a safe area. That's all she really wants. Living homeless and in a van is a lifestyle--- when you really can't afford anything else.  She kept her sense of self, her dignity, self integrity, and an extremely strong will to survive.  This is based on a true story. Kudos to the man who helped her. Last but not least ---- it has given me tips on how to live homeless and survive.",1471392000,,1029,4.160804020100502

7668221,5,B01BTDOSSG,"Maggie Smith is so amazing and so adaptable....she has never been typecast and acts beautifully in any role that she accepts.  This one was certainly different.

She plays a curmudgeonly bag lady who has parked her yellow van on a residential street.  A playwright who lives there invites her to park the van in his driveway for a short time, which turns into 15 years!  She invites herself to use his bathroom facilities, though probably not as often as she should.  The neighbors, while curious, are amazingly accepting of the woman with mental problems, and their children even deliver Christmas gifts to her.  She apparently previously had been a gifted pianist, a would-be nun, and continued to be a person of radical political views.  When she obtained a new van (gift of the playwright?), she painted it yellow, too.  The well-kept secret that kept her hiding in the van was revealed late in the movie; a motorcyclist had hit her van and been killed; she held herself responsible and was afraid that police were searching for her.

The playwright makes the story even more interesting, as we see him as two different personalities (the author, and the individual who deals with reality), who converse with each other.  (At first I thought them to be twins.)  He seems to mentally compare his resident bag lady to his mother, in various ways.

This is a true story, and it is filmed at the actual home of the playwright and the very driveway and London neighborhood where the van and the lady resided for 15 years.  Truth is stranger than fiction.

This is different from any other film I've seen, and I will keep it and watch it again.",1470960000,4,1642,4.695804195804196

7668289,5,B01BTDOSSG,"This film takes an unflinching look at the hardships that can attend upon old age, illness, and decline. It's also a very honest look at what it means to be a caregiver to someone aged or infirm. Nothing glamorized here. And yet, it is that very fact that for me gave the film such resonance and depth. The protagonist's frank self-examination as to what truly motivates him in his acts of kindness is so forthright and human. It is sad and yet triumphant. It is moving. An excellent film, excellent cast. And, because for me she is simply wonderful in any production that she graces, I must say that Maggie Smith is a treasure. : )",1469491200,,632,4.456896551724138

7668296,3,B01BTDOSSG,It's okay.  Not quite what I expected but good.  I thought it could have been better and I thought it was a little far-fetched.  I'm not sure if the bureaucrats would let anyone live like that now but I don't know and it is set in England so I really don't know!  It's a little slow in parts and almost could have been shorter.,1469404800,,327,4.0625

7668303,1,B01BTDOSSG,I made the mistake of pushing the play button before realizing the movie was not a Prime movie at the time I started to view it.  I turned it off immediately but have been charged for watching a movie that was on for less than a minute.  I have now learned that what was Ajmazon Prime may not stay a Prime movie.  I never watched it.  It might have been a very good movie but I am giving it a bad rating because I did not watch it after thinking it was a Prime movie.  After that I have now checked to see how many had changed and have removed them from my watch list.,1469232000,,568,3.9043478260869566

7668468,4,B01BTDOSSG,"In this mostly true film by Nicholas Hytner (The History Boys), Maggie Smith (The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) shows why she enjoys the constant accolades as an actor.  Here she plays Mary/Margaret Shepherd, an aged, vagabond of a woman, who lives in her smallish van.  Two things constantly play on her mind.  Events that cause her to repeat requests for forgiveness from the local priest.  One we see early in the film.

Shes being chased somewhere in rural England by a policemen (Jim Broadbent).  Shes doing her best to avoid him, but a bloody windshield suggests more than a speeding ticket.  The second digs deeper in flashback to Ms. Shepherd as a novice nun in training.  In any case, in 1970, shes a mean, dispirited woman.  Shes insistent that she reside in a certain upscale London neighborhood, by parking her van in the street, all to the displeasure of the neighbors.  Many try to befriend her, but she wants none of itwell until she does.

Somehow she manages to encroach upon a well-meaning playwright named Alan Bennett (Alex Jennings, Belle).  Hes sympathetic to her situation, perhaps because his own mother (Gwen Taylor) is about the same age and is having memory issues.  Alan finally invites Ms. Shepherd to park her van in his driveway, since he has no car.  Fifteen years later shes still there.

Smith is wonderful as the cantankerous woman, who somehow manages to elicit sympathy by herself being unworthy and unsympathetic.  Its a tricky performance but Smith pulls it off.  Bennett is the perfect counter to Smiths character.  He plays Ms. Shepherds unpaid landlord like a straight man to the funny comedian.  Hes Abbott, shes Costello.  The third act brings up the melancholia as we dig deeper into Ms. Shepherds background, but the film is funny and witty for the most part.  It also is a bit of a slog at times, repeating events to the point of, hey, we get it.  Overall, the film is enjoyable and watching Maggie Smith at work is always an education.",1467504000,,1981,4.764705882352941

This story though has an very humane perspective and Maggie Smith gives another solid and unique performance.

Homeless people once had a life and they too are human beings, somebody's son, daughter, brother, sister or child. Touching, tender and highly recommended.",1467504000,2,480,5.0886075949367084

7668499,3,B01BTDOSSG,"Love Maggie Smith and wanted to see this film after hearing her interview about it on NPR. The piece doesn't deliver on the inherent promise of a Maggie Smith movie, especially when the fabulous actor Jim Broadbent also stars. He is sadly underutilized. Basically what happens is an elderly woman parks a junker van on the street, much to the dismay of the neighborhood. A kind(ish) property owner allows her to move it into his driveway. Then we have flashbacks and unnecessary references to the property owner's sexual preferences, which are completely not germane to the story. There was a missed opportunity to allow Smith and Broadbent to do what they do best: develop unforgettable characters one falls in love with. Instead, it feels like a plot-driven story and the plot isn't very interesting.",1467072000,,802,4.992537313432836

7668523,4,B01BTDOSSG,"Fabulous performance by Maggie Smith who also played this role on stage. The story is a heart-wrenching one, but is made more palatable by the excellence in portraying the later life of this unusual, troubled woman who could not really connect to others in a socially 'normal' fashion or feel gratitude for their concern. The alternate story line, about the man who tries to extend a protective hand to both the van lady and his elderly mother,  is equally well constructed and convincingly portrayed.",1466899200,,501,4.964285714285714

7668893,5,B01BTDOSSG,If not mistaken this film was promoted as a comedy which would do it a disservice.  Certainly there are some amusing bits on display but for the most part the humor is drawn from the pathos of the human condition.  The film concerns a psychically wounded elderly woman (Maggie Smith) who parks her disheveled van in the driveway of a sarcastic playwright (Alex Jennings).  One could argue that Allen allows Mary to essentially squat on his property out of sheer altruism but he is too much the cynic to lump himself with his liberal neighbors who ply the poor soul with food and Christmas presents but secretly wish she would move on.  Unresolved mother issues could also be a factor but even that is ambiguous.  Or possibly Allen is looking for inspiration for his next magnum opus but one can't be certain.  Writer Allen Bennett has crafted an intricate script that succinctly encapsulates the human condition.  Maggie Smith is an absolute treasure here as Mary imbuing her character with interesting quirks without dispensing with her dignity.  Smith is matched by a superb turn by Jennings who expertly demonstrates the conflicts within Allen.  The Brits seem to have a knack for making these great human stories an art form lost in this CGI age.,1464566400,8,1250,4.830985915492958
7668894,5,B01BTDOSSG,"A triumph of nuance and more of a social commentary than expected: Maggie Smith as ""The Lady in the Van"" addresses social mores and the plight of being different with a cut of a coquette's eyes. Nobody does it better!",1464480000,2,217,4.45
7668895,5,B01BTDOSSG,"Like life it's a movie that seems to exist with no beginning and no end.  Yet, all things do have a beginning and do have an end.  The paradox of this film is that it immerses you in a situation while also somehow taking you on a journey.
Its continual succession of surprising unexpected clear realized moments is what makes the film so stunning.  Almost any scene is brilliant, and the film is chock-filled with them.  At first it may seem as a hodge-podge.  But as it continues, it becomes an evolving ongoing immersion into life.
Did i mention that Maggie Smith is exquisite.  In it she puts together many of the pieces of that brilliant large character she has played the parts of for decades into one perfect performance.
In the end (for the film does end -- ever so gently and beautifully) it is so true to life that you'll feel you lived it.

7668948,2,B01BTDOSSG,"Maggie Smith is the key ingredient in THE LADY IN THE VAN. I expected a small British film that would be heartwarming, inspiring and delightful. Unfortunately, it has none of those qualities except for being a well-intentioned film that so totally misses it's potential to woo the viewer.

THE LADY IN THE VAN is described as ""a mostly true story"" but we never really know what, besides the basics, is real. A mysterious homeless lady named Margaret (or is she really named  Mary?) parks her van in the driveway of playwright Alan Bennett's North London home for 15 years. Although he may not be pleased, he doesn't seem to object. It's pretty much the same with the neighbors who try to show the cantankerous and mean elderly lady some kindness and are always met with rudeness and anger from Margaret. And 15 years on her trashing his yard? And Bennett is constantly stepping in Margaret's  ""business"" (a more harsher word is used in the film) yet he never seems to raise much of an objection to the lady in the van.

I'm a fan of Maggie Smith and I loved her as the Dowager Countess of Grantham in DOWNTON ABBEY. Interestingly enough, Margaret is very much a poor and homeless version of the wealthy Countess. The same wildly opinionated and higher than thou attitude is back in Margaret who certainly can't win many friends. I was amazed that Margaret and the Countess are versions of the same character.

At the very beginning of the film, we know a tragedy has affected Margaret and is the reason she has gone into some form of nomadic hiding? The movie gets so dreary at times that it is hard to believe anyone would put up with this woman? Is she mentally ill or just a very free spirit? Social workers come visit her but no one seems to care to help her find a home. She sells pencils but how does she get enough money to pay for gas in the small car she suddenly seems to own?

The story tends to improve late in the film when we start to get some of Margaret's backstory. She was quite the lady in her day so how did she fall so deeply into homelessness? Bennett learns that Margaret speaks other languages, is well-educated and had more than one stint at a religious calling. So what happened? This lack of insight is why the films fails so miserably to entertain and inspire.

Bennett appears as two people in the film--sort of his yin and yang. The playwright Bennett and the more human Bennett fight over their feelings of Margaret and of Bennett's neglect of his elderly mother who so desperately seems to want his attention. Lesson to be learned here but it is overlooked.

I watched the extras on the DVD hoping to better understand the relationship between  Bennett and Margaret. Although he seems to have some general fondness for her memory, there still is not any explanation of how he tolerated her for 15 years. I was hoping for a picture of the real Margaret and some information on her ""real"" life. Who was this woman? Most of the film is just annoying.

Finally, we have the most contrived and silly ending I have seen in a film. LADY IN THE VAN is such an all around disappointment and I spent $22 on the DVD! Of course, Maggie Smith fans won't want to miss a chance to see her but overall, THE LADY IN THE VAN totally misses any potential for warmth and human detail.",1464220800,3,3296,4.469217970049916

Maggie was wonderful but the entire movie was lacking for me.  I feel I am fairly imaginative and do not need every detail to be conventional or spelled out for me but the idea of the writer who ended up having the main character (Maggie) live in his driveway for 15 years being portrayed as two personalities, each talking to the other, just got to me.  The story seemed to drag and it took some time to finally figure out why she ended up being this homeless person.  I trudged through the entire movie since I did buy it but it is one I should have rented from red box as it is a few hours I won't ever get back and certainly won't spend watching it a second time.",1463875200,,830,4.092592592592593

How is it possible that all those people sat down and ate supper every night knowing that a crazy old lady was in the cold, all alone. Don't give me the flack about we tried she wouldn't. Like the brother. He wasn't trying to be kind to her, he just wanted to get her out of his way.  Caseworker? Yep, that is exactly what they are like. Church? We don't have shopping nuns.  So. What shoulda coulda mighta have gone on here? Someone could have cared. If you do see this, understand that professionals need to diagnose and intervene.  But maybe you can be the one to nudge the system to do its job. Be kind and provide what you can. Allow them to make their own decisions, don't push or try to trick them. See how she agreed to let the lady bath and help her? It NEVER fails, if you are sincere.  They want help, but look at the surroundings. That is what the inside of the brain looks like.

7668984,5,B01BTDOSSG,"Thank you BBC and TriStar for providing a moment of sanity in the current deluge of noisy, incendiary, absurd plot movies that seem to draw the crowds (and the money) today. THE LADY IN THE VAN is a little jewel of a film, written by brilliant playwright Alan Bennett (Beyond the Fringe, The Madness of King George, The History Boys, etc)  a memoir of sorts, directed by Nicholas Hytner (The History Boys, The Crucible, The Madness of King George, etc), and starring the incomparable Maggie Smith in a role unlike her usual grand dame roles and Alex Jennings in a dual role of Alan Bennett as writer and as the one who experiences life, providing the source of Bennetts writings and plays. The entire cast is superb  especially the tiny cameos by Jim Broadbent, Dominic Cooper, Cecilia Noble, Deborah Findlay, Roger Allam, Clare Hammond, Gwen Taylor, Frances de la Tour and on and on.

The story is summarized here: THE LADY IN THE VAN tells the true story of Alan Bennett's strained friendship with Miss Mary Shepherd (Maggie Smite), an eccentric homeless woman whom Bennett Alex Jennings) befriended in the 1970s before allowing her temporarily to park her Bedford van in the driveway of his Camden home. She stayed there for 15 years. As the story develops Bennett learns that Miss Shepherd is really Margaret Fairchild (died 1989), a former gifted pupil of the pianist Alfred Cortot. She had played Chopin in a promenade concert, tried to become a nun, was committed to an institution by her brother, escaped, had an accident when her van was hit by a motorcyclist for which she believed herself to blame, and thereafter lived in fear of arrest.

Not only is the story funny and touching, it also makes a huge statement about our disregard for the homeless, the manner in which the Catholic church copes with its own problems, and the extraordinary love that develops between Mary and Alan. The music that plays such a significant role is Franz Schuberts Impromptu No. 3 in G-Flat Major, Op. 90, D 899 and Chopins Piano Concerto No. 1 in E Minor, Op. 11: II. Romanze  Larghetto and III. Rondo - Vivace beautifully played by Clare Hammond - all lovingly embraced and incorporated by the musical score of George Fenton (who also conducts the BBC Concert Orchestra in the film).

This illuminating and entertaining film will provide or restore belief in films as a means of significant statement and joy.  Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, May 16",1463616000,5,2445,4.807142857142857

She makes him feel so guilty that he allows her to live there for 20 years. He becomes fond of the old maid and form a bond which makes it a sad ending. .

7668999,3,B01BTDOSSG,"In my opinion, the theme of the film is not quite right, and feels unsettled in mood: I thought it promised to be a breath of fresh air of comic eccentricity with a clash of wills in some way it is, but I found the film be a routine of tiresome humour of tension between a playwright and an old lady who lived in a van outside the playwrights house.

Maggie Smith however, is wonderful as the actress in her portrayal of The Lady in the Van.  Perhaps the film could have won me over if it were entirely focused on the ladys character or life story (-or even a monologue which would have been far more interesting than Alan Bennetts own monologues of himself, of which he greatly seems to indulge, and be fond of....)

Instead, we seem to have a portrayal of Alan Bennett in importance of being....Alan Bennett  and if that were not enough of his own presence in film image, we also have a screen image of two Alan Bennetts....one with imagination of the playwright.....and the other in thought of the domestic Alan of the house talking to themselves together: how annoying is that?

I would like though to draw merit to the actual filming in the beautiful setting of the drama there is a visual and wonderful nostalgic feeling to the settings, and I like that, except that the style of the filming tends to be whimsical which clashes in contrast to the expense of poking fun of the eccentric ladys character. The incidental music score does not help  the melody skips along like a daft walk of mimicry fun.

I also don't buy the blue plaque scene outside the playwrights house....rather than to bring honour and to add a memorial to the lady, it draws a fantasy of attention to the Play itself -by Alan Bennett.....as the real life playwright himself turns up on his bicycle to view the unveiling scene of the plaque; so does the camera withdraw backwards so that the cinema audience get to see the actual filming with cameras and microphones on the film set. This may be clever, but feels a bit crass and self-centred. The ending too, of the film feels as though the storyline has run out of steam of ideas of the comical character that the film seems intent to make fun of, and then unfairly - masquerading her description as a cantankerous woman -as though everything was her fault in the first place  the film gives licence to allow us to indulge in the fun at her expense of the films success -but forgetting that we have invaded her very own private life.....

I also feel that the character of the neighbours is sketchy and pedestrian as though there is no soul or depth of feeling in getting to know their own thoughts  at least the playwright could have extended his imagination in style of old Englands Coronation Street? Sadly though, by the end of the film, I felt slightly heady and nauseated.",1463270400,5,2806,4.505905511811024

7669036,4,B01BTDOSSG,"Like most people I love Maggie Smith so when I saw her playing such an unusual role - falling from the halls of Downton Abbey it seemed like a great idea. We knew she'd be powerful whatever the role and living in a Van like a Tiny House... just seems so edgy and current!

I was surprised to find myself feeling disconnected from the story because they didn't show more about how she survived.  That actually made it a little less plausible which kept pulling me out of the story-line.  I don't want to give too much away ... but there was definitely some oddities that can be distractions to telling a pretty poignant story.  God bless anyone who find themselves living in a van in winter and has nowhere to go.

I did appreciate how the social worker seemed to be the voice  of reason and a kind of moral authority since  in so many ways it's not like that in this country.  It also seemed appropriate that she had the role she did in the end.

(I know that there are people who will comment about the specific acting roles and how each person did what, but to me what's important is maintaining integrity to the story and whether or not it held your belief in what was supposed to be happening and then ultimately left you with something you could take away from it and things like that.)

I gave it 4 stars because it held me enough to make me frustrated when it didn't hold me lol.  If I had been able to work on the set and help somehow I definitely would have developed more of her solitary time and emotional depth even if it was only in a few seconds of doing something other than moving bags around or telling people off.  She did give us a story to remember in the sense that there are so many disenfranchised people in the world and that part of the story you really can feel quite deeply. Her co-star was, in his own way, disenfranchised and as such he had room for her.",1462320000,,1883,4.243697478991597
7669037,5,B01BTDOSSG,"Loved it -- What a charming movie... but not in a quaint sort of manner. Maggie Smith does a wonderful job of portraying Margaret, sometimes called Mary, a homeless and extremely religious woman who was once a well-educated and classically trained pianist.  An incident in her past continues to haunt her and keeps her trapped in a world of delusions and paranoia. This is a brilliant glimpse of life and mental illness as presented through the narrative of a playwright, Alan, who observes rather than interacts with his world. Margaret ends up moving her van into his garden and Alan won't say no.  Together, this very odd couple, with his introversion and her eccentric behaviors, create a memorable relationship no one would have imagined. The ensuing dialogue is lively, entertaining and memorable. I'm very happy I stumbled across this ""mostly true story"".

This movie provides some great psychological insights into the mindset of an interesting and intelligent OAP who is on her own in the world-and hiding from a crime she mistakenly believes she committed. Her character, like that of the man who befriends and writes about her, is deeply complex.

It is about caring without considering it to be caring, which I find quite refreshing and humble. That it is ""mostly a true story"" makes it all the better, and it also leaves me hoping to track down the actual memoir of the same name by Alan Bennett.",1462147200,,586,3.9745762711864407

7669054,1,B01BTDOSSG,"The arc of this movie is the gradual unveiling of the truth behind the mess that is the 'van lady' as seen through the eyes of her reluctant benefactor, Mr. Bennet. And whilst a suspension of disbelief is a necessary element of all drama, this story loses credibility as it unfolds.  It is impossible to accept that a former concert pianist would fall beneath the level of a wild beast [even zoos animals get their cages cleaned]; or that the response of a former nun to charitable overtures on her behalf would be surly and rude.  The backstory of Miss Smith's 'lady' offers no explanation for her present state, either mentally or physically, and the more we learn about her past, the less we understand who she is.

While it is quite believable that this wonderful actress may have tired from playing upper class women in varying degrees of feistiness, I fail to grasp why her only other option is someone throwing feces out of her van.  This is an artist who can define an entire civilization by the shift in her tone or the wave of her hand.  Miss Smith's 'lady' is a grotesque parody of all the glorious, quirky, inspiring roles she has given us over the years.

That said, the movie does offer some moments of comedy.  Christian impulses also are in evidence, not in the form of her church -- which seems to have developed a unique brand of ineptness in how it handles the homeless -- but  in the actions of a social worker who is firmly determined to make things better. Why it takes 15 years to find a bath for the 'lady' remains a mystery, however.",1461888000,8,1558,4.480565371024735

7669081,4,B01BTDOSSG,"The Lady in the Van is the story of writer Alan Bennett (Alex Jennings), who allows the elderly, cantankerous Miss Shepherd (Maggie Smith) to park the van in which she lives in his Camden Town driveway until she gets things sorted out. The temporary arrangement lasts 15 years. Based on Bennetts 1989 memoir and 1999 West End play of the same title, The Lady in the Van has an episodic structure, and we learn through a series of conversations, flashbacks and exposition about Miss Shepherds history.

Ms. Smith makes this homeless woman her own, providing a layered portrayal that differs markedly from the Dowager Countess of Grantham on Downton Abbey. There could not be two woman more distant in social class and comportment, which makes it fun for fans of Ms. Smith to see her acting choices and realize what a truly magnificent performer she is.

The Lady of the title is hardly endearing. Shes brash and delusional and often extremely annoying. Yet we feel for her and admire her pride despite her sad circumstances. What doesnt work is Bennetts odd conversations with a literal manifestation of himself. Its an artsy device that differs in style from the grounded performance of Ms. Smith.

The movie has lots of dry British wit, ample charm, and a generous helping of pathos. It is especially a treat for those who love watching the superb Maggie Smith.

Blu-ray bonus features include deleted scenes, commentary with director Nicholas Hytner, a profile of Maggie Smiths portrayal of Miss Shepherd, making-of featurette, and a look at the films special effects.",1460851200,4,1570,4.9581749049429655
7669082,4,B01BTDOSSG,"I just saw Dame Maggie Smith turn in a performance that would put to shame every single actress nominated for Best Actress in this year's Oscar race. (Smith has already won two Oscars!) Director Nicholas Hytner (""The History Boys""), working with the man who LIVED the story, brings us a memorable (and mostly true) character who deserves our attention.

""The Lady in the Van"" is one of those small, quirky, dramedies that the British do so well. This time we aren't in some picturesque backwater hamlet, but instead in the Camden district of London, a stable, close-knit neighborhood that seems filled to the brim with thoughtful, generous people. Alan Bennett is a fairly reclusive resident of this neighborhood although he knows his neighbors and is on friendly terms with them. We discover right away that we'll see TWO Alan Bennetts: One writes stories and plays, the other goes out in the world and hesitantly gets involved. They talk to one another!

Here is most of the cast:
  * Alex Jennings (""Cranford"") plays Alan Bennett, the real-life playwright who was inveigled by this dotty old homeless woman into allowing her to park her van in his driveway...for fifteen years! We watch it evolve in a natural way, it's not a brilliant flash of generosity.
  * Maggie Smith (""Downton Abbey"") is Miss Shepherd: dirty, rude, smelly, and exasperating. We very quickly suspect there is more to her than meets the eye, but you never heard it from HER! She insists on using Mr. Bennett's lavatory, so the neighbors wonder if that gives her squatter's rights.
  * Roger Allam (""The Angels' Share"") is Rufus, one of those tolerant neighbors. I keep thinking this guy will call the authorities, but he is far more patient than I expected.
  * Deborah Findlay (""National Theatre Live: Coriolanus"") is his wife Pauline. She is curious, kind and flexible. The neighbors bring our heroine food, they have their children bring her Christmas gifts, and they try to serenade her (THAT doesn't work out well at ALL!).
  * Jim Broadbent (""War & Peace"" 2016) Retired Police Officer Underwood only shows up three times in the entire film, but it is his explanation about the motorcycle that brings clarity to Bennett's story.

We watch children in the neighborhood grow up, see Miss Shepherd's disreputable old van replaced by a generous benefactor (and the new one painted that same hideous yellow), see her make some mysterious trips out of town and watch her social worker blame poor Mr. Bennett for her condition!

I won't say any more, but please try to catch this one or buy the DVD when it becomes available. It's certainly worthwhile.",1459728000,48,2625,4.882882882882883

Based on the true story, Miss Shepherd was a woman of uncertain origins who temporarily parked her van in Bennetts London driveway and proceeded to live there for 15 years. What began as a begrudged favour became a relationship that would change both their lives. Filmed on the street and in the house where Alan Bennett and Miss Shepherd lived for all those years, acclaimed director Nicholas Hytner reunites with Alan Bennett [The Madness of King George and The History Boys] to bring this funny, poignant, and life-affirming story to the screen.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: If crotchety upper-class vagrant Miss Mary Shepherd hadnt turned up on the North London doorstep of the celebrated playwright Alan Bennett, he might have had to make her up, if only to give Dame Maggie Smith, our veritable Garbo of dingbat hauteur, one of the most tailor-made leading roles of her late career. Then again, perhaps vagrant Miss Mary Shepherd was partly his idea: The tension between life experience and authorial invention is the one complicating factor in THE LADY IN THE VAN, an otherwise heart-warming crowd-pleasing studies of two eccentric introverts, on opposite sides of the poverty line and finding common ground in more ways than one. Low on narrative drive, and marred by a misjudged final-act swerve into extravagant whimsy, Nicholas Hytners amiable luvvie-fest is enlivened by Dame Maggie Smiths signature irascibility; at least in healthy vanloads. Nicholas Hytner and Alan Bennett dramatize this evolving turf war of sorts and one that gradually yields mutual understanding, if not quite friendship, but mainly in ambling, semi-sitcom style. The puzzle of Miss Mary Shepherds backstory, stoked by occasional night-time visits from an apparent blackmailer (a leering Jim Broadbent) and all in all the film is a brilliant portrayal of a truly odd couple, and where also the screenplay touches on guilt, atonement and how nastily nuns can behave.

THE LADY IN THE VAN [2015] sees Dame Maggie Smith as the terrific as the muse in Alan Bennetts driveway. Dame Maggie Smith is excellent as the homeless woman who parked her camper van in Alan Bennetts garden for 15 years, in this enjoyable film about their poignant relationship from Nicholas Hytner. Dame Maggie Smith gets the chance to play someone grander than the Dowager Countess of Grantham, although with the same piercing stare of disapproval, pinched lips and bird-like head movements, as she assesses the unsatisfactory nature of everything around her. Two Academy Awards out of six nominations, five BAFTA awards, three Emmys awards, three Golden Globes awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, and a Tony. Its exhausting just to list the accolades that Dame Maggie Smith has accumulated over her decades on screen and stage: Imagine how tiring it must have been to earn them all. With two Alan Bennetts and Maggie Smith channelling a down-and-out dowager countess, this touching true story of the woman who lived in a van on the writers drive is a brilliantly British triumph.

Dame Maggie Smith plays Miss Shepherd, the Lady in the Van, in this very enjoyable film directed by Nicholas Hytner and adapted by Alan Bennett from his London Review of Books memoir about the haughty, cantankerous homeless woman who bullied him into having her chaotic camper van in his driveway for 15 years. Smiths performance, honed from the previous stage and radio versions, is terrifically good. Dame Maggie Smith as Miss Shepherd never says thank you or allows any charitable deed to go unpunished; Dame Maggie Smith shows how this once educated, talented woman is brazening out her agonised private guilt, and her presence is accompanied by much hand-wringing and suppressed distaste among the upscale north London neighbours, not unlike some of the characters resemble those featured in Alan Bennett's 1960s cartoon series The Stringal.

Alex Jennings gives a sharp and sympathetic performance as Alan Bennett, arguing with himself in split-screen, like a one-man married couple. Jennings shows that Alan Bennetts reasons for allowing Miss Shepherd to walk all over him were not down to timidity, or English reticence, or Christian charity, or because she was a guilty mother-substitute and he dismisses this glib parallel or even because he intended from the outset to use her as material.

THE LADY IN THE VAN [2015] might have been a kind of muse: the driving force behind his dramatic work, with its brilliant insights into loneliness and age. With Bennett, Miss Shepherd performed a strange, poignant duet of prickly unhappiness and wry humour. The likes of Roger Allam, Dominic Cooper and James Corden play useful cameo roles and the great Alan Bennett himself rolls up on his bike for the unveiling of a blue plaque to the sacred site at the end. But the glory of the film goes to the brilliant Dame Maggie Smith. There's nobody like her: so wonderfully Grande dame in any degree of squalor. All any of us can aspire to in the end, perhaps. But while her performance in The Lady in the Van was very much in the discussion for Best Actress this year, her age was scarcely brought up at all and exactly as it should be. Dame Maggie Smith has no need for such handicapping. She is not a gimmick; she is a treasure. This real cinematic pleasure is one of the best British films of the year.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has brought you this 2015 film looking really good to amazing on this 1080p encoded image Blu-ray, as well as an equally very nice 1.85:1 aspect ratio. THE LADY IN THE VAN [2015] has very exceptional detail, strong contrast levels and some amazing colour levels. The fine detail is never in doubt, with every fibre and wrinkle on the aging actors bodies and clothing are always visible, and the while the contrast is pushed to the high end of the spectrum, it never washes out the blacks TOO much. With that being said, I did notice a couple of times where said contrast gave the blacks a slightly washed out hue, but those were mostly at the beginning of the film, while the rest of the film sports deep and inky blacks. Colours are warm and natural, with cheery blues, greens and pastels to fill out the image with a good feel to the film. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment brings you also an equally impressive 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track on board sports great fidelity from the centre channel, which carries most of the weight, and features a good balance with the rest of the track but you know what to expect from your average drama in the audio department. Again this Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Blu-ray release offers a totally rich and rewarding 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track, as I am very happy and very pleased with this UK Releases audio presentation. What is also impressive is composer George Fenton supplied carefully calibrated score, which traverses the film's complex emotional territory with the composer's characteristic delicacy and the audio sounds are really clean, clear and well balanced throughout. So anyone purchasing this particular Blu-ray UK Release will be very well rewarded.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director Nicholas Hytner: Here Nicholas Hytner introduces himself and welcoming you to join him with this audio commentary while watching the film. Nicholas basically says the film is about Alan Bennett and his encounters with Miss Shepherd and her vans. We find out that Miss Shepherd is basically on the run from the police, because she felt it was her fault that she caused the accident with the young man on his motorcyclist, but of course we eventually find out that Miss Shepherd was not a criminal. Nicholas Hytner feels the film portrays Alan Bennet perfectly and very much like his real private life. We find out that when we see Dame Maggie Smith wandering around Camden High Street, it was actually filmed in Dalston High Street as the place has not changed, whereas Camden High Street has changed very dramatically. Many of the British actors in the film have worked with Nicholas Hynter in the theatre a lot. The Jim Broadbent character of the corrupt policeman, was thought up by Alan Bennett to show why Miss Shepherd was trying live incognito, to keep the story flowing. When we see the scene where Miss Shepherd is in Broadstairs [coastal town on the Isle of Thanet in the Thanet district of east Kent, England], and meets her Brother in the shed, well this actually happened in real life, because the Brothers wife would not allow Miss Shepherd in the house. As we get near to the end of the film, especially with the last 24 hours of Miss Shepherds life, before she passed away, Alan Bennett found a note left for him to contact her Brother and in real life Alan Bennett goes to Broadstairs to actually meet the Brother, which you see in the film. When we get the final surreal ending of the film where Miss Shepherd appearing after being buried, and talking to the two Alan Bennets is how it happened in the play at The National Theatre, and of course it is an imagination of his inner thoughts of what might happen if he did meet the ghost of Miss Shepherd, and of course it is a way to get the last word from Miss Shepherd over Alan Bennett. Nicholas Hytner sums up the film, by saying that what a joy it was to make the film and especially everyone who was involved with the film, who were a great team to work with and was also a great honour to make the film, especially in memory of Miss Shepherd.

Special Feature: Playing The Lady: Dame Maggie Smith as Miss Shepherd [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [6:22] First up with this special feature is Nicholas Hytner [Director] who talks about extensively about the amazing stage and screen actress Dame Maggie Smith. Since the 1960s, has been one of the shinning stars of the original The National Theatre Company under the guidance of Sir Lawrence Olivier, and played Desdemona in OTHELLO and of course has won countless of Oscars and especially for The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, and has never stopped be a true performer throughout the 20th Century. But of course what happened when any actress and especially of the calibre of Dame Maggie Smith reaches that certain age, because the great parts tend to dry up and are harder to acquire when you are over the retirement age, but of course when a truly brilliant part does come along in the guise of Miss Shepherd, it reminds you that it shows you the terrific high point in Dame Maggie Smiths career so far. But of course we find out that the part of Miss Shepherd was written specifically for Dame Maggie Smith, and it was on instinct from Alan Bennet and Nicholas Hytner that secure Dame Maggie Smith the part of Miss Shepherd. Next up is Alex Jennings [Alan Bennett] and found working with Dame Maggie Smith was an extraordinary experience, especially observing the powerful performance of thus brilliant actress. Next up is Kevin Loder [Producer] who comments on the fact that it was very brave of Dame Maggie Smith being known as a National Treasure to become the character of this grumpy old woman. Then we come onto the wonderful Dame Maggie Smith [Miss Shepherd] and comments on the fact that the actual Miss Shepherd was a very unpleasant woman, and says it was a very odd experience from going into the character of Miss Shepherd and feels her life was a real waste and personally feels deep down that Miss Shepherd really felt a sense of regret. We find out that Alan Bennett only really found out the true character of Miss Shepherd after the lady passed away, and in doing so Alan Bennett found out some truly wonderful material about her reel life from the past, and that is why Alan Bennett was able to produce something special, truly magical and also something truly remarkable. But Alex Jennings at the end of this special feature says that working with Dame Maggie Smith was again a formidable and a true privilege with this wonderful actress, who he felt and everyone else though, gave a truly extraordinary performance.

Special Feature: The Making of THE LADY IN THE VAN [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [13:46] We are informed that The Lady in the van was based loosely on a true story, but with a few embellishments, where Alan Bennett is a real writer who once lived in Gloucester Crescent near Camden Town in London . . . and to the build up to the making of the film, we get clips from the film to set the scene. Here Nicholas Hytner [Director] informs us that Alan Bennet [Writer] moved into the house in Gloucester Crescent in 1968, where Alan Bennett talks about when he moved into his home, he noticed Miss Shepherd van parked in Gloucester Crescent just up the road from him, but after 3 months Miss Shepherd eventually let her van drift to the next house, and eventually opposite Alans house, and around 1974 the council tried to move her on, and of course eventually Miss Shepherd finally winkled her way into parking he van in Alans driveway, and of course lasted for 15 years. But Alan Bennett says that if he had known the vent was going to last 15 years, he would never have dreamt of doing it, and of course things just creep up on you without warning. But of course the lady in the van did not go unnoticed by the residents of Gloucester Crescent and especially a young director named Nicholas Hytner, who moved into the area in 1983, and he knew Alan Bennett lived at No. 23 and could not work out what this yellow van was doing parked in Alans driveway, that was covered in bits of old carpet and the strange system of wires running between the van and the house, and as usual the English are always too polite to ask. Dame Maggie Smith asked Alan Bennett, how come it lasted for such a long time that Miss Shepherd was there, and Alan Bennett says, well she didn't impinge, and Dame Maggie Smith thought, what do you have to impinge on Alan. At the age of 78 years of age, Miss Shepherd passed away, and of course Alan Bennett wrote of his encounter with Miss Shepherd over the 15 year period and of course published the now famous memoirs of this period that Alan Bennett experienced with Miss Shepherd. But in 1999 Alan Bennett adapted The lady in the Van into a play, which was directed by Nicholas Hytner, which had Dame Maggie Smith playing the part of Miss Shepherd and ran for 9 months at the Queens Theatre in London. But in 2012 Alan Bennett and Nicholas Hytner collaborated on another play entitled Cocktail Sticks and starred Alex Jennings playing the part of Alan Bennett, who everyone thought he played the paly writer very convincingly. In 2014, filming started filming THE LADY IN THE VAN, and just like the play. Nicholas Hytner was to direct the film and here we get to see behind-the-scene filming in Camden. Everyone felt they could not make the film without Dame Maggie Smith and breathed a sigh of relief when the Grande Dame agreed to appear in the film. But of course they wanted Alex Jennings to appear as Alan Bennett, because of his portrayal as Alan Bennett in the play. The filmmakers felt that the film had to be shot in Alan Bennets original home he once lived in and on top of all that Alan Bennett was really pleased with the result of the film. Sadly Miss Shepherd passed away in 1989, but today her story still touches those who knew her, as well as those worked on the film about her life.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:34] You have a selection of three deleted scenes, which consist of You Could Get Tent; Im Preparing My Manifesto and She Has A Low Quiet Voice. Once again you can either select to watch them individually or Play All.

Special Feature: The Visual Effects [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [7:28] This special feature shows you how they did the trick photography in having two Alex Jennings appearing at the same time and as you will see the second Alex Jennings is played by the extra George Taylor, who has to wear the same clothing and what you get to see is screen wipes to show you how it was all done. Kevin Loader [Producer] informs us that in the play, the second person was the landlord who was always complaining about Miss Shepherd in Alans driveway. But they felt for the film it was much better to have the second Alan Bennett who was his inner thoughts talking. We also have input from Mervyn New [VFX Supervisor  Union VFX] who talks about the intricate technical camera set ups, especially how they got Dame Maggie Smith to rise up to heaven and to be welcomed by God. All in all this is a really fascinating insight into how they produced all the special visual effects.

Theatrical Trailer [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:58] This is the original Theatrical Trailer for the film THE LADY IN THE VAN. This is a totally brilliant presentation and gives you a real treat in showing off selections from the film that really shows you why it has been the big box office hit it deserves to be.

Finally, it says a lot that just about every surviving cast member from this directors screen version of The History Boys pops up for a cameo role like Jamie Parker as an estate agent, James Corden as a market trader, and literally half a dozen others. Frances de la Tour plays the widow of Ralph Vaughan Williams, Roger Allam a slimy hypocrite of a neighbour. Perhaps it depends if you want all your national treasures dumped out of the chest at once. There are cherish able lines and moments, like Theres air freshener behind the Virgin, says a local priest to the parishioner unfortunate enough to follow Mary into the confession booth. Her heedless smearing of mimosa paint on the driveway brickwork is a lovely touch. But of one thing, theres even less doubt: it's guaranteed to please absolutely everyone who already knows theyll love it. Also at one point of the film the great Alan Bennett himself rolls up on his bike for the unveiling of a blue plaque to the sacred site at the end. But the glory of the film of course must go to the wonderful Dame Maggie Smith, because there is nobody like her, a true tour de force of such a wonderfully Grande dame in any degree of squalor. All any of us in the end can aspire to it in the end. Highly Recommended!
