6333274,3,B00J4LMM6Q,"""There's always men whose honor can be bought."" When a man looking for revenge for the death of his son during the siege of Rochester Castle begins to plot his attack Hubert (Harries) sets out to find his cousin Guy (Austen) for help. What he hopes to find is someone with the same passion for protecting his land that he does, but what he finds is a war hardened mercenary who is only interested in money. When Guy returns to the castle old feeling begin to come back and he must control his emotions as well as fight off the attacking Celts. I have never been a big fan of these mid-evil type movies. I did like the first Ironclad though (mainly because I love Paul Giamitti) but was still a little leery about watching this one. This one, like most sequels, isn't as good as the first one. This one never seemed to fall into what it wanted to me. The movie starts off very violent and graphic, then becomes a revenge movie and finally a story about a man trying to reconnect with himself and his past life. Action fans will like this because there is a lot of fighting and blood (sometimes over the top though) but if you are looking for a complete movie with plot and a story to keep you interested then look elsewhere. Overall, nothing terrible but like most sequels it seems to diminish what was likable about the original. I give this a C+.",1404086400,3,1347,4.349206349206349

The lord of the castle is gravely wounded and the young new lord must find his really tough cousin to come and protect the castle.

Unlike other reviewers, I didn't really have a problem with the shaky shoulder cam shots. I didn't even notice it. In fact, I kind of like it, makes it seem a little more realistic, like you're there in person. Not much in the way of character development, story-line, war strategy, or script.

As a group they are quickly made (poor camerawork and lighting dominate in this one), rather graphic (beheadings and gratuitous sexuality here), and full of poor history (our English defenders never heard of the longbow in this one, the Scots can feed for a month off a forested mountainside capable only of supporting a village of ten hovels). As a group such films attempt to project attitudes and values that the producers think are popular in the west (in this one we are treated to provocatively clad female warriors, clueless heroines, and heroes who think that war is really a very bad thing). The one redeeming feature of this one is the castle. It looks medieval, it is charmingly ill-maintained, and it permits some nice scenes as its defenses collapse.",1416009600,,885,4.867549668874172

6333295,4,B00J4LMM6Q,"I am usually very generous with my ratings, giving 5 stars to B-budget films as long as they entertain.  The reason I only gave this 4 stars is because this movie could & should have been much better!!!  The characters absolutely fail to make any kind of emotional connection to the viewer & it is not the fault of the actors!  I get the feeling this movie was rushed, or the better part was left on the cutting room floor!!!  I also thought it was a poor choice to make Guy's character so dark & negative, he was close enough to a great man & survived against all odds at a time when violence was so common place it should have made him a man of stronger convictions!  Now don't get me wrong I am a Sword & Sandal, Sword & Sorcery, Historical period piece nut & don't regret purchasing this movie. I am saying they really missed a great opportunity to make a sequel that could have rivaled the first movie!!!  The first ""Iron Clad"" seemed to be a surprise hit, but when you look at the talent involved there shouldn't have been any surprise!!  Now they had the constraints of trying to keep the first film within its historical boundary's but they had total freedom to take this sequel where ever they wanted & I think they missed a golden opportunity to give the fans a great warrior hero instead of a psychologically struggling zero!!!  And if they felt compelled to follow the same formula of hiring mercenaries' they should have taken the time to endear them to the audience!  In the first ""Iron Clad"" even the hired swords with questionable moral centers at least had enough virtuous quality's that you cared whether they survived or not, in this sequel the lack of morality's in the swords for hire are so bad you almost find yourself more sympathetic for ""The Bad Guy's""!!!  Even the innocent women in the film come off as over privileged brat's you could care less for!!! Had they made Guy's character a defender of those unable to fight for themselves, like Marshal in the first Iron Clad & given the mercenaries 10 more minutes of back story or made them a bit more likeable they would have had a sequel fans would have embraced & found way more satisfying!!!",1414886400,3,2170,4.470886075949367

6333299,2,B00J4LMM6Q,"THE FILM: While the first IRONCLAD was a solid medieval action movie, this sequel is essentially the same movie and, even more to it's detriment, is horribly shot and edited. Describing the plot is an easy task. Basically, replace King John's small army with a clan of Scottish raiders and you have this movie. The only connection between the two is a minor character, Guy, who is the main character in this sequel (but played by a different actor). Other than that, the plot plays out, beat for beat, almost exactly like its predecessor. And to top things off, it is worse in almost every department. The acting isn't as good as the first one and there aren't any big-name actors to elevate the material, but no one stuck out as being particularly horrible. Additionally, the violence and gore aren't completely practical this time, instead opting for CGI blood spatter and poor dummy work for the more graphic shots (e.g., beheading). There was also some fairly obvious green screen and CGI enhancements that were really distracting at times. However, the worst aspect of this film is the camerawork, which is mostly ""shaky-cam."" Handheld camera during the dialogue scenes didn't really bother me, but the vigorous shaking of the camera during the action sequences was nauseating and made them extremely hard to follow. Still, there are a few aspects which aren't too bad. For one the score is appropriate to the material, even though a bit overblown. And even though the action scenes are rather poorly filmed, there are some good kills. They also attempt (with mixed results) to give the characters, including the villains, some depth. Overall, this film is a few steps down from the first in terms of quality across the board, some of it probably due to the reduced budget.

THE DISC: The audiovisual quality is pretty much perfect, although the digital cinematography does look ugly at times. As for special features, there is a single 15-minute behind-the-scenes featurette. The featurette was rather superfluous, and everybody talks enthusiastically about how ""great"" they think it is (which it isn't).

OVERALL: This sequel follows the law of diminishing returns perfectly, with a serious reduction in quality from the first.  If you saw (and liked) the first one, then maybe give this one a rental if you feel like punishing your eyes. Otherwise, just skip it.",1411257600,2,2370,4.97979797979798

6333303,4,B00J4LMM6Q,"Im not sure if Ive ever mentioned this before, but I really enjoy movies that contain big battle scenes.  By big, I mean huge as in scale and focus.  This means many people (or creatures) fighting against many others on a big battlefield.  When done well, this looks great onscreen and provides a monumental backdrop for which drama (and bloodshed) unfolds.  Director Jonathan English is very familiar with big battles, and his return to Medieval England in this IRONCLAD sequel is just as entertaining as the original.

When I first heard about IRONCLAD: BATTLE FOR BLOOD, I was very intrigued.  The first IRONCLAD is based partially on fact (and I say that loosely, as many liberties were taken with adapting the historical account to a movie), so I wasn't sure what direction English could take with a sequel.  Interestingly, he chooses a plot-line that could possibly have happened in that time period.

Like its predecessor, IRONCLAD: BATTLE FOR BLOOD is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The locations and backdrops used are excellent and set a dark and believable tone for the film.  Also, the production team does a great job of creating a plausible Medieval world thanks to specific detail-work and research.

The acting is pretty good, although I would not classify it as stellar.  I do enjoy seeing the lovely and talented Michelle Fairley onscreen; I first saw her in GAME OF THRONES and am now a big fan of her work.  Likewise, Tom Austen does a great job in the primary role of Guy the Squire.  I have not seen him act before, but I enjoyed his performance here and look forward to more of his work.  Unfortunately, the rest of the cast seems a bit bland.  This didn't detract a whole lot from the movie for me, however I do feel it is worth mentioning.

The action in IRONCLAD: BATTLE FOR BLOOD is top notch, and the fight scenes are brutal and intense.  The battles are blood-drenchingly realistic depictions of how actual combat probably was back in those days.  I love this aspect of the movie, and I have to confess it was one of the major draws for me.

IRONCLAD: BATTLE FOR BLOOD is a good follow-up to the original IRONCLAD, and fans of the first should enjoy this one as well.  Be sure and check it out on Blu-ray so you can savor every HD detail and see every blood-burst in vivid clarity.  The film hits store shelves today, so give it a look for sure.",1407196800,4,2380,4.590047393364929
6333304,3,B00J4LMM6Q,"3 1/3 STARS -- WORTHY (if flawed) ATTEMPT AT A SEQUAL.  TRIES TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE SUBSTANCE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY WITH LESS BUDGET THAN THE ORIGINAL - Results are debatable

Though I would still call the first IRONCLAD a better movie overall, I would assert this is a worthy sequel and actually better in just a few ways.  If we judge this in the world of B movies I might even consider 4 stars for this one.  The acting is quite good if judged in that context and the production values good as well.  There are only a few effects used for catapulted rocks and fires on the castle at some points.  Unfortunately these were noticeably thin, but not too distracting.  The story is very well constructed.  The one area that prevented it from being a truly excellent movie is that the characters were not fleshed out.  Through most of the movie I kept thinking it wasn't distinguishing itself in any way, but I was enjoying it still.  Where it makes up for the short comings is that it tries to be just a little more substantial or meaningful, with just slightly less cheese, than the first.  If they had just fleshed the characters and story out a little more, It might have worked.

THE PLOT:  5 years after the siege of Rochester Castle (Amazon's description says 1 year, but this is incorrect), the character of Guy the Squire is now Guy de Lusignan.  He is a mercenary drifting listlessly and struggling with inner demons, jaded after his actions at the siege of Rochester.  England is more peaceful, but English Lords on the borders are left to defend their own lands.  One such lord is Gilbert de Vesci, who's wife Joan is Guy's aunt.  His castle comes under attack from a Celtic clan that is trying to reclaim what they feel is their land.  To complicate the issue, the clan leader's son is killed during one of the attacks and each side becomes bitterly entrenched, bent on vengeance or survival.  Gilbert sends his son Hubert in search of Guy de Lusignan in hopes of raising some small support.  Hubert is disappointed to find his cousin in a debauched and bitter state, apparently willing to fight only where money is involved.  Money is paid and Guy returns with a small group of other mercenaries.  There is also a tiny bit of backstory between Guy and the daughter of Gilbert named Blanche (also his cousin of course).  The cast of mercenaries is very interesting, but this is one area I mentioned that just isn't fleshed out.  On in particular (Crazy Mary) is saved from the executioner and joins their band.  Actress Twinnie Lee Moore makes a pretty kick-butt little fighter playing Crazy Mary and I wish we knew more about her character.

The movie delves a lot into the disillusionment of battle as well as honor and duty for family.  There are still well recognizable stars (at least two or more from Game of Thrones like Michelle Fairley.  The action is also quite good.  As I mentioned before, the movie doesn't fail because of cheesiness as you might expect.  The story and the acting are quite excellent all considered.  Many will still enjoy this a lot, but I suggest a rental first.  If they had just fleshed out some of these excellent characters, I think this movie would have been outstanding.",1407110400,11,3216,4.597539543057996

Instead it is about some family of Norman descent privilege that have built a castle on the border land with Scotland. Then a vengeful Clan Chief leads his bunch of be-woded warriors to wreak revenge and do a lot of gurning.

The plot is that the young master  Hubert  has to go and get help from an estranged cousin who is a bit handy, as it were. This is Guy played rather well by Tom Austen. Then the action begins and to be fair there is plenty of action and it is mostly good.

However, there are some issues that could have been resolved and this would have been soo much better. For starters there is shaky cam during the action scenes and this is Richter scale 8 shaking, so a bit disappointing. Then the use of wode  I mean really this is supposed to be 1221. The spiral staircases in the castle go down on the left giving the advantage to the attacker  sack the architect immediately.

Then during the fight scenes which contain explosions for added authenticity they have buckets of straw strategically placed to spread as much fire as possible inside the besieged castle. I could go on but I think that is enough. Most of the acting is good though and they actually manage to engender pathos in parts and I enjoyed 80% of it, but this is one that many will not want to bother with because of the aforementioned issues and a bit more beside  I won't bother if they make a turd  I mean a third one in this series.",1463961600,,1500,4.290780141843972
