4386022,5,B004IEBRSI,"Saw Legacy in 3D first, then at regular 2D. While the 3D was good, the movie doesn't really lose anything by not seeing it in 3D.

I agree with the previous reviewer, Bret Fetzer has not seen the movie. He's pontificating to cover up having only seen the trailers which are the only scenes he references.

If you were a fan of Tron, you'll not be disappointed. The soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission. As a stand alone movie, it could have used a bit more setup, a bit more action, less Labowski--the character wasn't anything like that in the original--on Bridge's part, and a touch more time for the story telling and why ISO's were important. As this is rumored to be the first of a trilogy, more of that may be taken care of in future films.

With the backdrop of Tron, I'd give the movie high marks. On it's own, It's a good looking movie that needs a bit more in the story telling and dialog to make it perfect.",1296691200,33,930,4.3028571428571425
4386023,5,B004IEBRSI,"Not since ""Avatar"" have I been this wholly and utterly engrossed in a film.

Like the original film, ""Legacy"" follows a simple but engaging plot: Kevin Flynn's seemingly orphaned son, Sam, is digitized onto Flynn's pet project, the Grid, by accident and captured by Flynn's sinister doppelganger, Clu 2.0. Desperate to free his father, Flynn's lone companion and apprentice Quorra, and himself from Clu's tyranny, Sam kicks off a laundry list of events that are always exciting, always visually impressive, and always worth seeing over and over again.

The antagonist, Clu, makes a far more fitting villain than the MCP did in the original film. With his antagonistic role in place almost from the get-go, he does not let up his agenda until the last ten minutes of the film. Likewise, protagonist Sam Flynn is neither boring nor insufferable, providing the right balance of ""I know what this all is"" and ""okay, now what do I do?"" Quorra is a typical action girl in high heels and skintight bodysuit, but she still manages to come off as something better than a shallow love interest. Her quirky naivet, wide-eyed curiosity, and kind nature is a breath of fresh air in today's (slowly dwindling) trend of seductive temptresses and spiteful antiheroes.

In the 3D presentation of the TRON: LEGACY, the real-world sequences were filmed in traditional 2D while the digital sequences were filmed in stereoscopic 3D. The effects were far from headache-inducing and remained crystal-clear without the blurriness or ""ghosting"" of other 3D films. The eye-popping colors, infamous Tron aesthetics, ""derezzing"" effects, light cycles, and all else combined to create a visually immersive experience that looks fantastic whether it is in 2D or 3D. The vast landscapes, photorealistic CG imagery, and incredible particle effects certainly create a ""wow"" factor. The stereoscopic 3D was achieved using Cameron's patented system, which means the 3D is truly something worth seeing. In the Blu-ray transfer, none of the visual clarity was lost and the film now has the advantage of being in 2D, no longer suffering from a ""darkening"" effect due to polarized 3D glasses. With the distinct sharpness unique to the format, it is possible to watch the film a dozen times and see something new each time.

The soundtrack, which had been leaked in various forms for well over a year, meshed so well with the film that my first thought upon hearing the music on the disc battle grid was, ""I have to get this soundtrack"". It's one thing to hear it on trailers or video clips, and quite another to experience it. The film was cut to the music, and it shows. Beyond the music, the sound effects, though only rarely invoking feelings of nostalgia, were still extremely fitting and very well done. Duo Daft Punk, who make a cameo appearance in the film, have done an amazing job blending traditional symphonic music with synthetic sounds, an effect comparable to the all-electronic soundtrack that debuted in the 1956 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forbidden-Planet/dp/B0019NB9A2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forbidden Planet</a>.

Now, on to the original TRON Blu-ray included in the five-disc package: it is definitely worth it. Fully revised in full 1080p, the film has been cleaned up and pops off the screen like never before. The occasional sepia tones present in the original have been removed; pops and scratches are completely gone. What struck me the most, however, was the amount of COLOR - the reds, rather muted in the original presentation, are finally shown in their intended primary tones. Yellows and greens, along with cyan and blue, stand out better than ever from the dark backgrounds. The opening transition from the digital landscape to the streets of the real-world city looks more amazing than ever - I remember thinking, ""Since when did TRON have this many colors?!"" Even the 20th Anniversary DVD, which looked great on its own, doesn't hold a candle here. For the incredible Blu-ray transfer alone, this is worth a pickup.

Included on the LEGACY Blu-ray is a host of special features ranging from vignettes to documentaries. The extensive feature on creating the digital world using a combination of CGI and real-world sets is definitely worth a watch. The string of clips hidden elsewhere on the disc, ranging from a text-only conversation between Ed Dillinger, Jr. and a mysterious entity that signs off with ""End of line"" to the real-life viral marketing campaign ""Flynn Lives"", should probably be watched before the main film to get the gist of the backstory. The special features are very enjoyable - they're most certainly worth your time.

The film is an enjoyable, visually impressive 3D tech demo that is worth seeing in the theater. The Blu-ray transfer looks fantastic and the DTS sound mix is awesome even on a system without the DTS codec enabled. The film ends on a cop-out sort of note and a sequel hook, with a few slow segments sprinkled between the beginning and end, but in the end, TRON: LEGACY and its predecessor, TRON, is worth repeat viewings. Something new comes up every time - a feeling, a theme, a moral, something to take with you when the film is over - that makes LEGACY one of those all-too-rare diamonds in the Hollywood rough.",1292716800,,5306,5.0849598163031

4386063,5,B004IEBRSI,"Tron: Legacy has its flaws, I admit.  But oddly I cant seem to pinpoint them.  There is something missing from the movie as a whole, but overall its an effective Sci Fi/Father-Son/Coming of age movie.

For anyone who is a fan of the original (for all of its flaws) you should revel in the innovative production value that is a faithful effort to do what the 1984 version was trying to do; make something original.  Tron: Legacy offers a beautiful rendition of a computer world that is obviously no longer just a 2.0 version but a fully realized world with life, good & evil, desperation, hope and evolution.  The suspension of disbelief chasm is a bit large to imagine computer programs actually living and existing in any way close to our existence but if you can get past that, the reward is plenty.

With a brief and informative intro that explains how Flynn re-invigorated the IT Company, Encom that he regained control of in the 1984 version, we are given a glimpse on his relationship with son Sam, which is obviously a strong one.  He explains to him how he actually did get into the computer world and discovered how programs live and conflict with each other from inside the system.  Then Kevin disappears.  Leaving him with the question of not only where did he go, but why did he go.  Twenty years later, Sam has become a somewhat hostile and rebellious computer genius who still owns a majority share of the Encom company but doesnt really want anything to do with it.  On a request from Alan, the alias of Tron from the original movie, Sam goes to the old arcade and is pulled into the computer world via the same means his father was pulled in.  Now the computer world has changed though.  Its deadlier, and CLU, the created servant/custodian created by Kevin to watch over the world when he wasn't there, has tyrannically taken control and is trying to move into the outside world.

The emotional aspects of the movie don't come into play until much later in the movie, but needless to say, and this is a bit unfortunate, the movie doesnt really work as well on the first viewing.  After 2 or 3, I think its easier to see what the director was doing.  And even though Tron: Legacy is not perfect, its a great piece of entertainment and a great long term sequel to the original.  Its beautiful to look at, the action sequences are incredible, the story is very good, if not great.  And Jeff Bridges plays the character with the same loose groovy attitude for the most part but now he knows there is a lot more at stake.

If you watch this, try to watch it a second time at some point, and then make judgment.",1461715200,3,2622,4.482105263157894

4386071,5,B004IEBRSI,"OK, so the plot of these films is a bit hokey:  a computer programmer is sucked inside of a computer & finds all of the bits & bytes to be more than a little bit anthropomorphic.  There, I said it.  Happy now?  Here's the question:  who cares?  These are fun movies, plain & simple.  If you're looking for highbrow intellectual films, look elsewhere.

I had not watched the original in 30yrs before watching it on Blu Ray.  It did compel me to recall what a good time it was back in the 80s.  It also brought to mind all of the TRON video games in the arcades.  To my knowledge, TRON is the only film to ever be pegged as one of the best movies of the year & one of the worst movies of the year ~ in the same year!!  Whoa!

The sequel I had not watched in the theater so it was all new to me.  It has spruced up special effects and cool music.  Some of the motifs in the film seem to have been inspired by the MATRIX movies.  Mike Sheen is terrific as the flamboyant bartender ~ the polar opposite of the stoic scientist he plays in SHOWTIME's MASTERS OF SEX.  That said, the Thespian who steals TRON LEGACY is Olivia Wilde.  I was quite enthralled with her and have since added the rest of her movies to my Amazon wish list.

If you are a science fiction fan or a computer geek then this set of movies is a must-have.  If you are neither of the above but still have a tiny bit of little kid in you, then they're worth a look.  It's hard to go wrong with TRON!",1455580800,,1460,4.017421602787456

And just like the theater, the 3D is not in every scene. However, the transitions are all done so well I did not notice until I re-watched it and specifically looked for these things.

It is packaged well, and has a neat 3D holographic logo on the front.

The movie itself it great, in my opinion. The 3D is also very well done, with almost nothing flying out of the screen at you for the ""wow"" factor (that only distracts from the experience IMO). After Avatar, TRON: Legacy is probably the 2nd best 3D I've seen.",1379635200,3,809,4.344370860927152

4386149,5,B004IEBRSI,"I am a big fan of the original Tron. I really looked forward to the sequel. While there was a lot about the sequel that I liked, there were also a lot of things about it that disappointed.

For the color scheme, the style changed a lot from the original to the sequel. We went from blue on white to blue on black. It still looks pretty neat, but I would have liked to see some transition. Maybe even some older programs still in service. It was not to be. In some ways I still preferred the older suits. The new ones were almost completely dark.

In the first Tron, Kevin Flynn had ""magic"" powers due to being a User. I was kind of glad to see this subdued somewhat. Now, he uses his system knowledge instead.

Also in the original, Kevin Flynn was good at the games because he was good at video games. But this doesn't work so well in the sequel. Sam Flynn is good at the games... why? Not because he has any experience with them. But only because he has become Generic Action Hero Guy! I don't know what to think about that.

I liked how Kevin Flynn had aged. I also liked the awkward Father / Son relationship, which I could certainly relate to. I felt like the acting there was spot on. It was meant to be awkward, with two people who were worlds apart. With nothing to talk about really, but with still a deep love underneath. I got that, and I thought it was well done.

Some criticize Garrett Hedlund's acting in this, but I thought he did a great job. I had no problem with Sam Flynn as a character. Olivia Wilde was good, too. And Jeff Bridges, as usual, really shined. He was awesome.

I've read some criticism that somewhere between Tron and Tron: Legacy, Kevin Flynn became ""The Dude"" from The Big Lebowsky. I couldn't disagree more. They both have a beard, and they both say ""man"" a lot. But that's where the similarity ends. Flynn is philosophical. The Dude isn't - people just read philosophy into what he says, even when there is none. Flynn is an achiever. The Dude is a loser. Flynn cares about the future. The Dude just wants his rug back... So I don't think it's fair at all to say that Flynn is now the Dude. It doesn't make any sense to say that. Sure, the movie has plenty of things to criticize. But calling Flynn ""the Dude"" just because they look alike is a cheap shot that doesn't require any actual thinking.

For me, the biggest problem with the movie was that the story wasn't so great. Mostly because it featured far too much exposition. And in a lot of cases, there were setups for some great fights - which were never shown. For example, toward the end, Sam goes into a room to fight. He says his one liner, and then the whole fight occurs off-screen. This is very ineffective and a bit of a let down. Maybe it was done this way on purpose to avoid a PG-13 rating, but I was disappointed.

And all of the stuff with the ISO's... That's not a bad story, but all they did was tell us about it in flashbacks. That's not very effective storytelling. If they had made THAT the story rather than what we got, it might have been more interesting.

Plus, I never bought into the whole ""The ISO's will change everything"" argument anyway. ""Religion, science, medicine..."" I'm sorry, but I don't get that. It seems an awful lot like hand-waving on a lazy writers' part, trying to make us think the ISO's are more significant than they are. I mean, the programs in this movie can already think and act independently which is not at all approximating reality to begin with. So how is finding another batch of programs that can do the same in any way significant? So they were randomly generated. So what? What does that have to do with ""religion, science, and medicine""? Or ""everything""?

I've seen other reviewers here defend this plot point religiously. I think you guys are making something out of nothing. You WANT the story to make sense. You WANT the story to be great. But it isn't. Yet you still try to argue to convince people like me that it is.

What we got wasn't all bad, however. I still really enjoyed the movie, and I would like to see another sequel. It had some neat effects. I liked the derezzing effect especially. Story-wise, the father / son angle was good.

It also had some bad effects. Namely, the young CGI Jeff Bridges. Now I didn't mind this when used for Clu. Clu is a program, after all. So dead eyes and a creepy, frozen face are acceptable for him. But it's not acceptable for the younger Kevin Flynn. It's only one moment, but it seems apparent that the CGI technology is not quite there yet.

The story was not very complicated. This was good and bad. Good in that it was simple and easy to understand. Bad in that there wasn't a lot of motivation besides ""Clu is doing this because he is evil"". But that's exactly the way the first movie was, so I can't complain.

Tron is underused in the movie, which is a pity. But I didn't mind this too much. Even in the first movie, Tron himself is a pretty flat character. Just a crusading do-gooder. Still, I wish they had done more with him here, instead of turning him into a generic Darth Vader-type. But it was still good.

Ram also shows up, by the way. Or at least, his programmer does (""Alan, can I have some of your popcorn?""). But this isn't in the movie itself - it's only on the special features. There's a whole section of deleted scenes with an entire subplot featuring the guy, called ""Flynn Lives"". I am sorry to see that none of that made it into the movie, but I can see why it was cut.

It is also worth mentioning that same as the original movie, Tron Legacy really shines when it comes to the music. Instead of Wendy Carlos, we get Daft Punk. I credit this movie for turning me on to Daft Punk, a most excellent electronica duo. The music they do is great, both for this movie and in their own albums.

Also, as a special feature, this movie includes Daft Punk's most excellent ""Derezzed"" video. This features two sci-fi jousting figures on a Tron-esque landscape. It has to be one of the coolest videos of all time! Certainly the coolest I've ever seen.

As for the 3D... I am a 3D enthusiast, and own many 3D movies. I liked the 3D in this movie. It was nothing spectacular, all depth effects really. But it was very well done and I enjoyed watching it. I think the 3D adds to the experience here, and I can't say that about all 3D movies.

This particular pack also comes with the original Tron, which I don't care to review other than to say I love it. It's not perfect either, but it's still great. And having it on Blu-Ray is NICE.

The final verdict: Tron Legacy is a good movie. Not great, but good. It had a lot of potential, and - to be fair - a lot of hype to live up to. Perhaps there is no way it could have measured up to such expectations. It is hard for me to judge the movie without thinking I might be biased, or overly critical. I wanted the movie to be a lot better than it was. It let me down, but I'm still pretty happy with what we got. I'm still giving it 5 stars because I like it so much. I hope they make another.",1357516800,4,7055,4.282282282282282
4386150,5,B004IEBRSI,"There are tons of extra extents including the hour and half ""Making of Tron"" of the original movie, which is very inspirational and valuable as archive/documentary. There is not much to say about the new Legacy movie (meaning fewer valuable extra contents) and I can see the cause behind it. It does include some viral marketing footage in the form of Easter Eggs that hints on yet another Tron movie to be made.

The picture quality of the blu-rays (both of the two movies) can easily surpass many of the new blu-ray movies released in 2012! Don't really know how they did it.

I haven't try watching it in 3D yet but I have heard people speaking highly of the effects despite the complaints about the 3D effects during theatre visits.

This is a really good movie with excellent effects considering its era. A very nice upgrade! The 3D version of Tron: Legacy is just not very good. The movie has a thin storyline and the 3D effects really aren't that great. Actually, most of the movie is standard 2D with some special effects scenes enhanced in 3D.

4386158,4,B004IEBRSI,"Please accurately describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.

I have the 5-disc Tron set, so I am reviewing the ""Tron Original"" and ""Tron: Legacy"" Blu-Rays that came with the set (I do not yet have a 3D system).

Tron: Original
==============

Aspect ratio is about 2.20:1 (seemed a little less wide than 2.35:1). The movie lasts about an hour and 34 minutes. Sound is DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio.

The soundtrack is probably the best surround sound I've ever heard. There is a lot of sound from the surround speakers, and sub-woofers. It was perfect, and I give it a 10.0 on a 10.0 scale.

The video quality varied. Outside of the computer it was very good to great (not perfect). Inside the computer it varied. It seemed like there was a lot of grain in scenes that had humans. Most scenes without humans looked near perfect. Colors were fantastic, but blues, and human faces had the most grain. Blacks were perfect (no grain, and no distortions). I rate the video from 8.0 to 10.0. I've never rated a Blu-Ray's video less than 4.0.

Tron: Legacy
============

Aspect ratio varied throughout the movie from 1.78:1 (or 1.85:1) to 2.35:1 (or 2.4:1).  Sound is DTS-HD 7.1 Master Audio.  The movie lasts about an hour and 58 minutes.

After seeing ""Tron: Original"", I was disappointed in ""Tron: Legacy"".  Although the second movie is more spectacular, I was more impressed with the original, since it was made in 1982.

In ""Legacy"", I didn't like the video quality, because I thought there was a focusing problem.  In the ""real"" world, video quality was pretty good to great.  In the ""electronic"" world (I'm not sure if I have the correct terminology), the depth of focus was very shallow.  You could have two people talking, and one would be sort of in focus, and the other out of focus.  And the background was a total blur.  The camera only focused on one thing at a time, so you could only look at that particular thing.  And I use the word ""focused"" loosly, because it mostly wasn't a sharp focus.  Most of the time the faces looked soft and slightly out of focus.  And the camerman sometimes couldn't decide what to focus on.  When no people were in the scene, it looked great usually.  I still give the video quality a 9.0 to 10.0 (it varied).  I really didn't see any grain, except at the beginning a couple of times, when blacks looked grainy and distorted.

I wasn't as impressed with the audio quality in the second movie as I was in the original.  It was more complex in Legacy, but that was mostly because of the music.  I thought the sound they created for the original was better, because I think they utilized the surround speakers better for the motion of the vehicles, which seemed to move around you.  I know Legacy has 7.1 sound, but I just don't think that makes that much of a difference (and I do have a 7.1 system).  I still give audio a 10.0, because of the use of the side and rear surround speakers, and the fact that there is a lot of sub-woofer bass.

I am quite please with the purchase of this 5-disc set, because of the audio and video quality, not because of the movies themselves.  I paid more attention to the audio/video than the plot, which got kind of boring in both movies.",1333324800,,3256,4.488095238095238

Both movies have great video image quality with Tron Legacy again being the better of the 2.  That's hardly surprising considering it was made 20+ years later than the original Tron.  My TV cannot display 3D images so I can't comment on what I've seen of the included Tron Legacy 3D blu ray but I will say that I was impressed when I saw the movie at the theater in 3D.  Additionally, I will point out that I've seen many reviews that were quite positive regarding the 3D blu ray of Tron Legacy.

4386181,5,B004IEBRSI,"Since there are already many reviews on the movies themselves I will just focus on the package of discs and the quality of the films on the Blu-Ray Medium.
First off, the packaging is great. You get all five disk's packaged in a single regular sized case and unlike many multi-disc packages, the dics actually stay in place when you move the box around.
The original Tron both looks and sounds excellent on Blu-Ray. The teams that worked at re-mastering the sound and video did their jobs very well. The only difference I noticed from the original is just simply that it looked and sounded better, which is the way it should be. There are too many re-masterings out there that will destroy the color or misplace sound in the soundscape during the movie, this is not the case for the original Tron.
The new Tron: Legacy is just simply astounding in pretty much all A/V aspects. The picture is crystal clear. The sound is clear and sharp in the highs. It has thunderous lows that still manage to sound clear and concise. I don't have a single complaint in either picture or audio re-productions.
I have not had the chance to watch the 3-D disc as I don't have a 3-D capable TV so I cannot rate that.
All in all, this set is worth every penny. Even if you don't have a 3-D TV now, it is likely that your next TV will have that feature and it is good to be prepared. Besides, it still costs about the same as buying each movie separately  on Blu-Ray.",1308441600,,1446,4.37546468401487
4386182,4,B004IEBRSI,"This combo is really amazing: two movies (the original is always the best but the new one is OK), a lot of special features, digital copy, DVD, Blu-Ray and 3D in the same item. Good purchase if you are a fan of this kind of movies!",1308096000,,231,4.043478260869565

And don't pay attention to the bad reviews of the new TRON, if you loved the old movie, you will love this one just as much, visuals are mind blowing, and the story is kind of similar to the first one too.",1307577600,,431,4.070588235294117
4386184,4,B004IEBRSI,"The Tron/Tron Legacy combo is quite a mixed bag but overall, its worth the price.

I saw Tron in the theater and recall the WOW factor it invoked as a film created by computer graphics.  That innovation can't be understated in appreciating this film.  My memory didn't include the incredibly horrid acting by every member of the cast.  Watching Tron in 2011, I was reminded that almost all of the movies I saw back then were wrapped around named actors who delivered some incredibly wooden performances.  Still, the concepts were cool and the unique idea of diving into the world of the computer makes all the rest worthy.

Tron Legacy comes to us in a different timeframe and both benefits and suffers from its predecessor.  Watching it, I recognized how sophisticated we'd become in the special effects of our time.  Visuals that would have blown me away a couple of decades ago passed by without as much as a ""meh"" and the detailed world of the computer was so rich and so enhanced that in some ways I found myself wanting the more simplified grid with boxed clouds and straight walled alleyways.  The Legacy grid was so detailed that it seemed like another planetary environment from Star Wars or some similar film and that actually removed me from the ""in the computer"" feel.  I'm not sure how I would have reacted to this film had I seen the 2D version.

The 3D version is amazing.  The lightcycles were updated in a manner that screamed there was 30 years of computer graphics technology behind them.  The dimensional aspects worked outstandingly well, with a true ""viewmaster-look"" with depth beyond what I'd hoped to get out of a 3D movie.  The movements and flow of the animation was top-rate and the detailing of programs being shattered into bits really shone over the light flares used in the original.  If I had any complaints on the effects, its that they were too fully developed and seemed too much like the real world.  I'd have opted for something a bit more sterile to ensure that you never forgot this was supposed to be inside the computer.

The biggest anchors of the film were its storyline and unfortunately, Jeff Bridges.  To be fair, I don't know how much was Bridges and how much was his character but the older Flynn didn't work (at least for me).  The guy in Legacy isn't the same guy in Tron.  In the original, Flynn was happy and go lucky.  In Legacy, he's tired, worn-down, and lifeless.  A cardboard cutout would have served the same purpose.  The story supports this portrayal but the ending demanded a more inspired character.  Instead, the older Flynn seems like little more than a battery depleted of its charge.  Likewise, the younger Flynn is so subdued that its hard to embrace him.  The same dullness reigns through-out most of the cast until you get 2/3rds of the way into the film, and even then, the spark is only temporary.  I know this was done to give Legacy a more serious feel but it seemed to weaken the movie rather than strengthen it.

The fights off the grid game area were lacking as well.  The end contest seemed somewhat obligatory rather than thrilling and the final conflict had essentially no impact whatsoever.  Part of this comes from the magical aspect of being able to create anything on the fly.  It removed any sense of danger.  Part of it comes from the characters being so lifeless.  Unlike the earlier sequences on the game board, these fights unfolded as nothing more than pretty visuals going through the motions.

However, the game grid contests make the film worth purchasing and the larger grid world is visually appealing.  The 3D work is top-notch and I'm looking forward to seeing that these same animators will do with other storylines.

Overall, this is a definite buy but understand you are getting it with some inherent shortfalls.",1307491200,3,3812,4.6968325791855206
4386185,5,B004IEBRSI,"Buying essentially 5 movies for ~$10 a piece was a great choice.  I now have the option to watch it in Blu-Ray, 3-D Blu-Ray (if I ever get a 3-D TV), DVD, etc.  The special features are interesting, and I still haven't gotten a chance to watch them all.

I saw several complaints about the quality of the disk holders, but I have had zero issues getting the disks in and out.  It's simply a piece of plastic shaped like a DVD/Blu-Ray with two notches cut out at the 12 and 6 o' clock positions so that you can place your thumb at the center tab and index finger under one of the notches to easily pull out whatever disk you want.  I've had no issues of almost breaking/cracking a disk.  I'm not sure what other people are doing, but the disk holders are perfectly fine.

I don't know if the problem with movie was the writing or the directing.  Potentially the producer did something to edit out the content.

Good things:
-The special effects with the motorcycles was very cool
-The idea behind the story was an interesting concept

Bad things:
-The 3D was not well done. (Disney's Christmas Carol/Alice in Wonderland had much better 3D scenes)
This was the basic reason I purchased the movie.
-I kept losing what they were talking about; it was hard to follow
-Actors seemed like they were being overly dramatic
Esp. the first part where the son was talking to his dad's friend
Plus - I was never able to really care about the characters - I did not care if they succeeded.
And I was not concerned with one of them died.
Shocking because I really like Jeff Bridges.
-Bad guy was not wicked enough - more mildly annoying",1306627200,5,1022,4.5271739130434785
4386187,4,B004IEBRSI,"Tron Legacy-  When viewed on a good sound system this movie is very entertaining. The Lower frequency effects are great.  The story was decent. I think they did a better job on the first one in the story department. Graphics aside the first Tron in my opinion also did a better job of making a computer world. Obviously Tron Legacy is easier on the eyes then Tron, same is true for the sound. All in all I was very entertained and will be watching it again.
  The 3D images where clean with depth viewed on my Panasonic VT20.

 Tron- Been awhile since I saw this one so we watched it first. Graphics are hard to watch these days but putting that aside is still a good movie. Knowing more about computers then I did when I first watched Tron years ago I liked how they incorporated computer processes/parts etc into the story and stage. Like noted above I think they did a better job in Tron then Tron Legacy.

 This is a great combo if you do not have the original movie. Not sure if one would notice much improvement in Tron from dvd to blu-ray. And if you have the 3D equipment 3D is the way to go for Tron Legacy and hopefully with a very good sound system.

The world of Tron was just as strange and new as outer space or the deep sea.

Maybe a Sam Flynn action figure or Quorra or Rinzler on a light bike, meh, that would've been better I guess since we're bundling the movies with toys. No, I opted for this version, and I'm glad I did. I've read on here and other sites that the Bluray and DVD discs for the box set with the identity disk come in ""undesirable"" packaging which can easily begin to scratch the DVD's. This version on the other hand, is in one larger bluray case stacked on top of one another in their own dividers that you can flip through to choose which disc you'd like to view: be it the 3-D Bluray format included, or the standard Bluray, the DVD of Tron: Legacy, the bluray of the original Tron, the digital copy of Tron: Legacy -- all here, all in a handy, secure, non-damaging case, and really, the best copy of both films out there.

4386194,4,B004IEBRSI,"(Isn't it frustrating that Amazon combines ALL of the reviews for a particular movie, regardless of the edition, or the medium, or the packaging?  These should really be separate and distinct reviews!)

I remember when TRON came out, way back when...  it was a fun ""popcorn"" movie which pretended to have aspirations of deeper meaning.  The biggest element in the success of TRON was the special effects, which were (and still are, really) stunning...  perhaps a bit simplistic, but just ""otherworldly"" as well, and that was what mattered.

So...  first, the TRON disc...  it's beautiful, and I have no complaints about it whatsoever.  I'm not sure if they restored anything, or if it was just a very nicely maintained copy of the film that they worked from, but in any case, it's great.

Obviously, the NEW movie is a beautiful transfer, that pretty much goes without saying, doesn't it?  There's no reason to be critical of the production values of the disk set.

I really, really enjoyed the first movie.  And to be honest, I really loved the TRON computer game sequel... that is, THIS one:

[...]

... which is a far superior sequel to the movie we were just given, in my personal judgment.

What didn't I like about ""Tron Legacy?""  Well, first off... the ""otherworldly"" element was largely lost.  Granted, they're pretending to be in a more ""evolved"" Tron world, but it's still on the same hardware from decades earlier, so it's not like there's any justification for the less surreal presentation, is there?  And they just made it seem less alien, less artificial, less ""magical.""  The thing is, this film would have BENEFITED from the biggest complaint about most CGI films...  the so-called ""uncanny valley.""  If every character except the two humans were in that slightly creepy ""almost but not quite human"" mode that we see in films like, say, Beowulf...  that would have been a BENEFIT to this film, wouldn't it have been?

In fact, there is one character where this is actually the case, and it works well for ""him""... that would be CLU.  CLU resembles Jeff Bridges, sort of... but watching the two films back-to-back, you realize that the CGI guys on this film really missed Bridges' real appearance pretty badly, both for ""young Flynn"" and for CLU.  It looked more like David Duchovny than it did Jeff Bridges in some cases!  That was just FINE for CLU, though...  but not really suitable for ""young Flynn"" (who we've seen before... in my case mere minutes before!)

So... the TRON world was more like a bad rave scene than a different world... which was disappointing.  It was just too ""human.""  Too ""normal.""

That's not the worst part, and I could have forgiven that...  but the worse element was that the entire movie was just GRIM.  The first movie was FUN!  It was a ""popcorn movie"" which you could watch, thrill over, but it never devolved into DEPRESSING.  This movie was, simply stated, depressing.  All through it.

TRON 2.0, the PC game, by contrast kept the sense of ""fun"" from the first movie.  Yes, instead of a ""bit"" your companion was now a ""byte"" and could communicate a bit better...  and you didn't deal with recognizers and tanks and so forth all that much...  but it felt like the same world.

The biggest annoyance I had with TRON 2.0 was the ""teen-angst protagonist"" who was the son of Alan Bradly... ""Jet.""  But I have to say, I really think I liked Jet better than I liked Sam Flynn, honestly.  Jet was an aimless guy who didn't want to work at the same company with his dad, and wanted to make it on his own...  but he wasn't some over-the-top ""super-dude"" in the real world who was jumping off of buildings and breaking into his own company and so forth...  Sam Flynn was just a joke, really.  Honestly, can you imagine anyone like him existing?  Not in the ""TRON"" world but in the real world, I mean?

SO...  I give this set a 4.5/5.0 for quality (I've never given a 5.0).

I give it a 4.5/5.0 for completeness.

I give the first movie a 3.5/5.0 for the film itself (a better-than-average, light-hearted ""romp"" movie).

I give the second movie a 2.0/5.0 for the film itself (a depressing, uninspiring story without any characters the audience can really relate to).

And I STRONGLY recommend the video game ""TRON 2.0"" (I have no connection to this, by the way, except I bought it and I played it) if you really want to experience TRON in a more immersive fashion.",1305244800,,4405,4.659297789336801

Was a little disappointed that one of the disks lighting button did not work as the batteries had overloaded/run dry and could not get a replacement, but I won't mark the product down for that as faults do/can/will occur.

The movie itself is delightful and I am greatly looking forward to the sequel.  If you haven't seen this movie, or the original definately purchase a copy and support a great franchise, you won't regret it!

If you are looking to fill your shelf up with cool, unique, nostalgia ridden items, this product is definately a nice way to go.

The reason this product gets a 4 instead of a complete 5 is there are numerous ways they could have easily made this package better.  If they used a plastic jacket system within the case instead of a clip on spindle, it would have greatly increased the long term value of the product.  The lights could have been placed symmetrically and the back could have been a mirror of the front.  I think that a booklet within the disk with some stock photos etc could have been a nice touch as well as you rarely see a collectors edition of anything without one, and it rewards those willing to part with their cash just that little bit more.

I recommend the movies for everyone and the product for die hard fans, collectors, and empty shelf owners, (considering it is definately pricey especially now).

The original Tron from 1982 looks amazing in Blu-Ray...almost better than Tron: Legacy does!  I think the Digital Copies that Disney puts in their DVD packages are a little un-necessary, but I am sure some people enjoy having the digital copies for use on their IPOD's.

One thing that could have been added to this box set, was another extra such as the light cycle that was included with the Walmart-Only release of the Tron DVD set.

4386207,2,B004IEBRSI,"First, my initial shipment was damaged. It appeared to have been packaged that way, and Amazon made things right. So 5 stars for Amazon. I'll be shopping here again.

To the DVD:
I paid out a bit more to get this DVD set. Unfortunately, you can play one disk out of five unless you have blue-ray. So you upgrade, and can now watch 4 out 5 discs. To watch the 3D version, Disney provides instructions with, quote, ""4 easy steps."" A lie? No. They are easy. And very expensive. Buy a new 3D blueray player. Buy a 3D TV, Buy $100+ 3D glasses. Have 3D tron Disc.

Here's my point.

I watched Tron 3D with some cheap, 3D glasses in the theatre. It looked beautiful. Disney chose not to produce a 3D Version of the movie in this format, likely because A.) to save in production costs, and B.) to support the high-end tech industry.  They didn't care enough about the rest of us to make a 3D version we could all watch.

Don't tell me why the glasses are expensive. I know why. I'm not paying $4,000 so a mixed crowd can watch the movie.

Buy the two disk set, or a less expensive special edition, unless you're wealth - in which case you will be able to take full advantage of this set, and will only find yourself disappointed with the quality of the ""identity disc"" case. I do not envy those who can afford this. I am disappointed that Disney has singled out a high class of people, when the rest of us have kids too.",1304899200,,1412,4.230483271375465

Also, I think this is Jeff Bridges in his 2nd best performance (Rooster Cogburn #1). Everything came across great in the transfer from the big screen so its a jewel to watch. The new release of the original Tron is also beautiful, a great job of remastering.
I think the only negative I can list about this set is the Collectors Case. It lights up realy cool, but the latch on the case to hold it closed doesn't work at all. You have to have it sitting in the case base (the little trapazoid thingy at the bottom) to keep the case closed... it kind of clamps it shut.

I loved watching the Blu-Ray version of Legacy - the sound is absolutely phenomenal - the picture quality is great too. The quality of the digital copy and the classic Tron movie were also superb. I love the little disc case everything comes in with a couple of caveats:

1) the movies are stacked (not touching each other though)in a spindle - so to get to the one in the back, you have to remove all the others on top.
2) it's smaller than I thought it'd be - just big enough for the DVDs - but now that I look @ the picture, it seems right.
3) The discs are very difficult to remove from the case - I'm always afraid I'm going to break the disc I'm trying to remove.

I was hoping to have more information about said project, but instead it was the teaser that was already on the web.

Nit picking aside, it was a great find. Loved watching the original when I was growing up and the 'sequel' was just as thrilling for me. Perhaps it'll help people if they watch the original, then watch Legacy, right after one another. Better understand the sequel.

4386225,4,B004IEBRSI,"My brother got this collection and it is great.  I love the 'disk' case that comes with it.  It lights up and is a great addition to a normal DVD collection set.  Great for showing off with the disk platform.  There are a couple of additional things I noticed.

1.  The display case is hard to pull disks from.  The disks are hard to release from the case.  Not a biggy but makes me a bit nervous with a collector set.
2.  The Digital Copy is only allowed to license onto one computer so beware when you license it.  If an older computer or not your main computer then you will only be allowed to watch it on the one it was licensed to.  Of course you have the DVD versions as well though.
3.  The soundtrack on Legacy is great.  It is performed by Daft Punk.  It has received flack from the old school Daft Punk fans but I think it fits the story line well for the movie and is great for the movie.  I like DP in general and thought the soundtrack was amazing before I realized it was DP.  Music albums are different from soundtracks and DP fits the movie.
4.  The original Tron is remastered and was great to see on a big screen or home entertainment room.  The story to me seemed much better than I remembered. Great visual effects when it comes to grid like themes.
5.  The story for Legacy is lagging and somewhat weak, especially in the script.  They do not address the first film very well in this continuation of the franchise.  The set and special effects are amazing.  A cult classic I guess though so watch before you buy.  I did not understand Legacy entirely when I first saw it but after watching it again it made more sense and grew on me.

As for the packaging of this product I say overall it's decent.  The plastic identity disc that holds the blu rays and dvd looks cool and lights up, whoop dee doo.  That plastic identity disc that contains 4 out of the 5 discs I can do without.  I'd rather it come in like how they were sold separately.

As for the movies, Tron the original classic has always been one of my favorite movies of all-time.  I even own a disney beta copy that my Dad bought when it first came out.(I don't think that beta tape works anymore lol).  It was great to watch it in blu ray and I especially love the updated bonus content!

Tron Legacy I saw in the theatre but it was the 2D version.  I think I would've gotten more out of it if I saw it in 3D.  This is where the 3D blu ray comes into play.  I don't have a HD 3D TV yet but I might just have to take this over to my friends house to experience it.

I also love the fact that I got a regular dvd of Tron Legacy and the digital copy.  I will pass that along to family and friends who don't have blu ray players.  Plus I got 350 disney points for my disney account(HAHA).

4386236,5,B004IEBRSI,"I've heard many people ask if this boxed set is worth owning.  In a word: YES.  Even if you do not own a 3-D system, this set is roughly the cost of Tron: Legacy and Classic Tron together.  And this set includes Tron: Legacy on DVD as well.  All this, and the really sweet light-up ID disc case, with an easy-to-access battery cover in case you need to replace the batteries.  (Can't even do that with my iPod!)

The movies are good and worth watching.  This review is about the set.

The 3-D disc looks great on the Viera through an Oppo 93, and the switching from 2-D to 3-D (and back) is handled smoothly and you hardly even notice when it happens.  The movie also switches back and forth from 2.35:1 to 1.85:1 (not sure why) and this also is not noticeable unless you are looking for it.

The 2-D Blu-ray looks every bit as nice as the 3-D disc, as you might expect.  One thing that delighted me about the 3-D and 2-D discs was they both include Dolby Digital 2.0 sound!  You may not recognize how nice it is to have that option, but when you try to watch a movie like this on a laptop with Blu-ray capability, it's frustrating to be stuck with 5.1 sound with only 2.0 speakers.  (You lose the center channel, so the dialog is very low volume, but then the special effects and music (which concentrate more on the left and right channels) blast you out of your seat.  The inclusion of 2.0 sound on the Blu-rays is simply wonderful!

The Classic Tron Blu-ray looks as good as a 30-year-old movie can look!  They didn't pull a Lucas or a Terminator and add extra sounds to make it more... whatever they aimed for in those other movies, so you get the movie you loved and it is beautifully cleaned up.

The only problem I had with my case was that it was nearly impossible to remove my discs.  They nearly broke as I removed them.  So, I took a file, filed down one of the three tabs (half-way down, not all the way), and now the discs are held securely but they come out without bending.

In short: buy this set!

8/12/2015 EDIT: Whoops.  The price has edged up to the collectible realm.  It now costs a lot more than Tron and Tron: Legacy together cost, so that line is now no longer valid.  I still like mine.

4386241,5,B004IEBRSI,"So says John Lasseter in one of the many bonus features on the Tron and Tron:Legacy five-disc combo set, containing a Blu-ray and DVD each of 1982's Tron and the recent Tron: Legacy, plus a digital download disc of the latter. (You can also get each film separately, but why unless you have the earlier DVD and don't want Blu-ray?)

Lasseter's quote comes from what are billed as the ""original DVD features"" that were included in the much-sought-after first DVD release of the original Tron, which Disney did not reissue until now. Turning away what might have been a great amount of profit, the studio withheld the original film from reissue when the new film premiered, reportedly to avoid what might have been assumed as technical comparisons from the 1982 movie to the shiny new 2010 one.

They needn't have worried much, but it didn't seem to matter in the long run, because today both films are among the best sellers in the DVD market. And even though they don't compare well when judged primarily by special effects standards, they actually both stand together better than expected.

Steven Lisberger's Tron is still one of the most unique films to come from Disney or any other studio, now as well as then. There is simply nothing exactly like it, including Tron: Legacy, which is undeniably a tribute in its basic look, but also resembles a good many current big-screen special effects extravaganzas.

There's no way that modern filmmakers would replicate what is very much a product of its era in scope and resources, and Tron: Legacy is lightyears beyond its predecessor in astonishing visuals. And like the original, the sheer, overwhelming proponderance of eye-filling sights leave little room for characters, though both tried valiantly. Tron: Legacy has the lion's share of labor, having to survive comparisons to its predecessor and reconcile two storylines, all the while relaunching a franchise that has been like shining gold in a locked treasure chest for decades.

On the third point, Tron: Legacy succeeds extremely well. Like Star Trek, which transformed from a canceled network series with high ambitions and vision that transcended its limited sets and effects and built on itself through new incarnations, Tron was a great idea that occurred before the medium could handle it and even Disney didn't know what to really do with it for almost three decades -- though perhaps now has come into its own.

The key was to catapult the franchise, and Tron: Legacy hit the mark. The animated version previewed on the disc is just one piece of the pie; a high-tech dance party called ElecTronica at Disney's California Adventure Park is another; and apparently the merchandise is already doing well

Bruce Boxleitner and Jeff Bridges appear in both films, a plus for fans, though clearly many enthusiasts do miss Cindy Morgan (who appears on the earlier bonus features). Rather than relying on star power to sell the new film (and jeopardize sequels with high contractual demands), Disney wisely gave Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde a high-profile showcase. Wilde -- who has already distinguished herself superbly on TV's House, is especially impressive -- she is a scifi icon in the making, along the lines with Star Trek: The Next Generation's Seven of Nine.

What's especially fascinating about Tron, though, is the road entertainment and effects took between the two films, which can be traced on the bonus features (though the earlier Tron DVD set did have a few more, so keep your old one if you have it). It was an influential film that inspired countless viewers, especially those within the film and video industry.

Both films make good use of the clarity of Blu-ray. The only missing feature is a new commentary track. But we can still hear the comments on the original film by Lisberger himself, who seems to have been welcomed into the new production by the new creative team.",1302739200,2,3908,4.945121951219512
4386242,2,B004IEBRSI,"The price available through Amazon is reasonable but keep in mind the list price for his item is supposed to be $80.  With the combo set you get several versions of the exact same movie on formats you do not need.  Remember that time when DVDs first came out and all the DVDs you bought also came with a VHS tape and cost twice as much?  No.  Just me then?  Okay.

Including a DVD with the BD movies is foolish and silly but, hey, a lot of movies do it these days. Fair enough it costs like $1 or less to print a DVD but most movies have the decency to do this while also pricing their product in line with their stand-alone coutnerparts.  Not Disney, nope! We're going to charge you for that DVD too.  We're also going to give you a 3D version too, because, you're going to get a 3D TV sooner or later, right?

Negative review is all on Disney's pricing of this release as it's way out of line with what is reasonable. For the $80 this movie costs in stores, or $60 on Amazon, you get two movies, two versions of one and four versions of another.  Oh, and a lenticular cover.  Consider that for a moment. Are you going to use all of those formats?  Doesn't $80 strike you as high?  Most TV series seasons don't cost that much and those include 20-some one-hour episodes.

This item is way over priced and has way too much in it. A straight BD combo release for both movies is required.  Buyers are recommended to just get the stand-alone DVD/BD releases which, combined, will cost less than this set. Half as much, infact.  Get it even if you don't yet have a BD player since those stand-alone releases are DVD and BD.  No Digital Copy, however, even though that too is one of those things most other studios put in their releases as not much more than a free courteousy.  Not Disney, you's going to PAY for that digital copy too!

Content: Both are decent, fun, movies the latter one maybe a bit more than the former.  Low grade is all on Disney's lousy combo-pack release.",1302739200,3,1975,4.286486486486487

This is a cheap plastic case, the hinge is already cracked (just got it 25 minutes ago), the button for the light looks like it has been chewed out by hamsters. Nothing wrong with the discs (all are great). But don't order this box set.....you will be GRAVELY disappointed !!!!",1302739200,13,381,4.380281690140845
4386244,5,B004IEBRSI,"Back in 1982, the sci-fi Disney film ""Tron"" captured the attention of  sci-fi fans, especially for those who saw the beginnings of animation on coordination with CG for live-action film. ""Tron"" was a groundbreaking film for Disney.

As Disney was able to use experimental ways of achieving animation back in 1940, the company would do the same in 1982 with ""Tron"" and many thanks goes to the creative and foresight of writer/director Steven Lisberger, who had the concept in his mind of what he wanted to accomplish.  And although the technological terms may have had people scratching their heads back in the early '80s and the film was seen as ""ahead of its time"", while the majority of the public may have not understood the film, many younger people were fascinated by it.

""Tron"" would become a box office success as it grossed $33 million in the U.S. and since 1982, the film would be seen as an amazing time in Disney live action and animation as the film would inspire many people to become animators and the film itself would become a significant cult film, including the ""Academy Award for Technical Achievement"" in 1996.

As the film would spawn a successful franchise of video games, comic books, an animated series and toys, ""Tron"" was a film that would remain a fan favorite for nearly 30-years.

And then came the sequel, ""Tron Legacy"" in 2010.  Produced by original writer/director Steven Lisberger, the film would feature the debut of  director Joseph Kosinki and feature a screenplay by ""LOST"" writers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz.  The film would also feature the return of the original movie's actors Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner.

This long awaited sequel had a hefty budget at $170 million but made over $397 million worldwide.

And now both films will be released on Blu-ray and DVD and also an Ultimate Tron Experience with a 5-disc collection which comes with ""Tron: The Original Classic"" on Blu-ray and ""Tron: Legacy"" in 3D, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Copy.

VIDEO:

Tron: The Original Classic

""Tron: The Original Classic"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:20:1).  It's important to note that the original ""Tron"" is a 1982 film and that to achieve its look, there was a lot of tweaking with the original film, utilizing black and white images and literally layers upon layers of tweaking and isolating and painting over them, it was groundbreaking at the time.  But it's also a film that uses CG of that time period.  So, for those who watched ""Tron Legacy"" first, watching an older science fiction film may either put those in awe of what was accomplished at that time or turn people off to see how different the two films are in visual effects.

With that being said, one can not expect anything significant in visual effects compared to today's films but as a fan of the original film, I can tell you that this is the best looking version of the film to date.  One of my biggest worries about watching ""Tron"" was that the film's effects may show some imperfections in HD via Blu-ray.  But in this case, I felt the film, especially of its use of light was amazingly well-done for that time period and it looks great on Blu-ray!

There are some light imperfections and flickering but it's important to note that even the creators talked about this challenge as they accidentally used the Kodak film in the wrong order and thus, for the film, they had to make up for it by adding visual effects and sound effects to compensate for some of the unusual light flickering for the film.  But needless to say, because of the age of the film and the fact that back in the early '80s, film stock was not that great to begin with, there is slight flickering during the film but still there is also a god amount of detail in HD.  You can actually see the stitching of the outfits, even the detail of the skin of some of the characters.  There is a good amount of grain and also noise.

But considering how old this live-action film is, it still looks much better than any of its counterpart releases on video and for the most part, I was quite pleased with the picture quality of this film.  It was truly a groundbreaking, experimental film combining animation techniques to live-action, especially one of the first earlier films to incorporate CG.

Tron: Legacy

As for ""Tron: Legacy"", now this film is where the picture quality is fantastic.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 and 1:78:1).  The film uses a dynamic aspect ratio in which to preserve the original IMAX theatrical viewing experience, the picture image alternates from both aspect ratios.  There is no choice to change this.  Still, this film looks absolutely fantastic.  The focus of the filmmakers to respect the original film was to make sure there was a good use of light throughout the film but also to showcase the darkness with its rich blacks, strong contrast and vibrant colors that pop from the inky blacks.

The detail is also fantastic in this film and it's a visual feast on Blu-ray.  For a film that uses a lot of intense colors, there are no banding or artifacting issues whatsoever.  Make no doubt about it, this is a gorgeous transfer that videophiles and Tron fans will absolutely love on Blu-ray.  Fantastic PQ!

As for the 3D release of this film, it's important to note that you must have a 3D Blu-ray player and a TV capable of 3D and of course, the 3D glasses that come with that TV.  And as many of you know, I am a bit critical towards 3D releases on Blu-ray thus far but when its done right, that is when I become more vocal.  In the case of ""Tron Legacy"", this is an example of a film that was meant to be in 3D.  Objects actually pop off the screen and it's not a film about all depth, the discs fly out towards you, shattered pieces fly out towards you.  Granted, the 3D elements are a bit more subtle but the fact that you get the 3D version of this film included on this Blu-ray release is fantastic!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

Tron: The Original Classic

""Tron: The Original Classic"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA (48 kHz/240bit), French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  I have to admit that when it came to the classic film, I was not expecting an immersive soundtrack.  After all, it's an older film nearly 30-years-old.  If anything, I wanted to hear how lossless enhances the experience of the original ""Tron"" and sure enough, we get clarity in dialogue and action sequences that utilizes LFE and surround channels but for the most part, is a front channel-driven film that sounds great compared to its DVD counterpart.  If anything, I do enjoy the clarity of the lossless soundtrack for ""Tron"" but I knew in my hear that the film where I had high expectations audio-wise would be ""Tron Legacy"".

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.

Tron: Legacy

Wow!  That was the primary word that describes the lossless soundtrack for this film.  This film is what audiophile's dream of when it comes to full utilization of your home theater setup.

Presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD MA (48 kHz/24-bit) and English 2.0 Dolby Digital, English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital and French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital, it's that 7.1 lossless soundtrack that just amazes you!  The first thing that stands out is the lossless soundtrack by Daft Punk.  It's electronic music that enhances the overall feel of ""Tron Legacy"" and it's a film that manages to take every opportunity, may it be a vehicle, crowd ambiance, blast or any action-related sequence and utilize every channel possible.  There is a tremendous amount of LFE when it comes to the explosions or when a large vehicle is flying nearby, you can hear and feel that rumble!

I simply had a smile on my face when I was hearing the surround and rear surround channels at work.  This is the type of release where I simply love a 7.1 lossless soundtrack being fully utilized.  To many films where the surround and rear surround channels are just utilize sporadically but for ""Tron: Legacy"", it's constant throughout the film.  I have no doubt that audiophile's will fall in love with this lossless soundtrack.  It's fantastic!

Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Did you grow up when ""Tron"" was released?  Were you mesmerized by it?

I can tell you that I loved Tron and I can easily remember playing the various Tron games for the Atari 2600 but most of all remember how I wanted a Tron suit and get paint that glows, so I can paint all over a frisbee and play Tron with my friends.  As for the film, at the time, I'm going to be truthful with you, I had no idea of the concept as it was way beyond my head.  All that resonated with me was the fight scenes, the light cycles and the just the overall look of the film.

But as I got older and when I watched the 20th anniversary DVD release of ""Tron"", I realized for the first time of how groundbreaking this film was.  It's easy to think that things were created by computers back then but logically, you knew that since this film was made in 1982, technology was probably not available at that time to create this film entirely with CG and sure enough, we learned how much of it was hand-crafted and required many people to hand-craft this film using older animation techniques but also the beginning of utilizing computers for movie use.

It was an interesting juxtaposition of Disney's Fantasia and Tron, two films created over 40-years from each other but knowing that they wanted to accomplish something special, unique, groundbreaking in the world of animation and in the case of Tron, visual effects for a sci-fi film.

So, when I watched ""Tron"" again, nearly a decade ago, I realized how forward thinking Steven Lisberger was when he created this film and it was definitely a film that was ahead of its time.  Granted, it did great in the box office but it took years to achieve cult status as those who appreciate the film's storyline and also the creation of it, to see why it has become a cult favorite.  ""Tron"" was literally a work-of-art.

Now here we are in 2011, as the film approaches it's 30th year and most recently having great success with its sequel ""Tron Legacy"", a film that manages to continue the ""Tron"" legacy using high-end CG graphics and visual effects and what was accomplished on film was absolutely gorgeous.  Granted, the storyline for the sequel is easily accessible and although it may not be deep in storyline, it's one of those films that yes, it's a popcorn action/sci-fi flick but it manages to be a worthy continuation of the ""Tron"" series.  It was easily to get caught up in the new virtual world of the Grid by its gorgeous visual effects, its music by Daft Punk and literally audio carrying you away with its lossless immersive soundtrack.  I admit, watching this film on Blu-ray was a lot of fun and if you have the proper home theater set-up, you'll understand what I mean by awesome PQ and AQ!

I do feel that this 5-disc collection is the ultimate ""Tron"" release.  I can't fathom buying one without the other and if I had to review them separately, I'm sure my score would be much different and much lower than what I'm giving this collection.  But as a whole, this is a 5-star release.  Not only do you get both films on Blu-ray, you get the 3D version of the film, you get a DVD version of the film and you also get a digital copy as well.

I'm sure many will dismiss by score as they probably disliked both films but it's important to note that I'm grading the overall release and not just the film.

As a child, ""Tron"" was a big part of my life and I enjoyed it, even though I couldn't follow the story all that well.  And as an adult, I appreciate it even more as a Disney work-of-art for its time but also for its forward thinking by Steven Lisberger.  The sequel, story-wise wasn't all that deep but nor was the original.

What I enjoyed about the film was the escape to a virtual world and even today, may it be through games like ""Second Life"" or ""World of Warcraft"", there are people who manage to find the beauty of a virtual world and in this case, I felt the visual effects team were able to build off of the world that Lisberger created and create something so beautiful and gorgeous in the sequel and the storyline compliments that.

I definitely had a lot of fun watching both films and as mentioned, if I was to review each separately as a Blu-ray release, they would not receive a five-star rating.  But the fact that this 5-disc combo does include both films on Blu-ray, includes the 3D version of the ""Tron: Legacy"" on Blu-ray, plus a DVD and digital copy is awesome!

But it all comes down to your preference as each of these films will be released separately on Blu-ray or a four disc set for ""Tron: Legacy"" and even a more pricier collector's edition which comes with an identity disc.

Overall, some may find these films entertaining and fun, others may find it as visual eye candy for its respective time periods.  But if you loved both films, I highly recommend getting this 5-disc combo.",1302652800,4,17636,4.7457293035479635

4386246,1,B004IEBRSI,"The name of this set needs to be the terrible edition. The LED lights on the disc are a joke. I can not even tell they are on unless the room is pitch black. Unlike the picture of the product that shows is nice and illuminated. So if you decide to look past that, getting the disc out is a joke. They are all stacked on top of each other and are almost impossible to get out. I would stay away from this set as i am returning mine immediately and going to best buy to buy them individually.",1302566400,,490,3.95959595959596
4386247,5,B004IEBRSI,"- A second part that put behind the first one.

The 1st Tron was probably a revolution when it came out in the beginning of the 80's but comparing with the second one it seems that we miss something....

TRON Legacy is the most powerful feature that you can watch in 3D (Since James Cameron's  Avatar). Disney did right coming back on this adventure....but they missed a point. For the new generation who didn't know the first Tron, starting with Legacy was like if you missed a part of the story.
For most of the people Tron is ""dmod"" and doesn't give you the motivation to watch another one. It was better in this situation to Re-create a complete new saga to match with our time.

The Cameo idea
Hopefully the writers had a good idea bringing back young Jeff Bridges as he appears in the first movie.
Using technology and a clever introduction, you don't need to see the 1st Tron to understand this second part.....but you will be disappointed watching it after.

I saw the movie several times in theatres; I really enjoyed the visual part of it and of course the music produced by Daft Punk who match perfectly with TRON.

This is the kind of entertainment that needs to be seen on a big screen 1st. The Blu-ray contains a mix of IMAX and normal Theatrical view that will adjust to fit on your screen automatically. A lot of extra features will show you how they created the young Jeff Bridges Cameo.

Since we got the Philips 21:9 cinema screen; it's a real pleasure to watch movies, especially that kind of movie. If you have a normal 16:9 screen, you need to zoom or change the option to obtain the best immersive 3D Experience. Or a projector to forget the black bares.

See you on the grid",1302566400,5,1698,4.437299035369775

I recommend this for someone whos looking for a family movie thats in 3d there is plenty of action and no foul langage I'd gladly have my 4 year old watch it again and again in 2d of course no 3d till shes six. Buy it and buy it now I love disney and they take on live action family movies. And the glasses from 3d tv corp work great with my mits tv. I've got 6 pairs no problems there.,1302566400,,480,3.625
4386249,1,B004IEBRSI,Iam very sorry but to to me this set is a complete waste of money it gives u 5 discs good for the money but not for those who do not have blu ray players it is a joke for the price i was expecting the orignal tron to be a normal dvd not blu ray so yet it is just a waste of money to even get it not worth the time u only get 2 discs as normal dvds one is the digital copy the other is for normal dvd players as far as the blu rays i can never play them so i got majorlly ripped off on this item,1302566400,,494,3.3805309734513274
4386250,4,B004IEBRSI,"This is a great product, and I am extremely happy that I bought the special edition with the laser disk container. If you ready anyone elses review about how the discs are hard to get out it is not true. It works like a normal CD case, but there are 4 discs in it. Not rocket science.
On top of that the movie is amazing! Both the original and the second movie are really good, and I would recommend them to anyone and everyone!
The only issue I have with this is the lighting system. It was a great plus that I did not expect to have until I opened it. The issue was that after pressing the button about 5 times it broke. Now in order to turn it off I have to take out the batteries. Its kind of annoying.",1302480000,,706,3.9788732394366195
4386251,3,B004IEBRSI,"This is a review for the Tron Legacy Collectible Package (5 Disc ). I am not reviewing the movie.

I read the reviews about the packaging as soon as the item was available. I have to agree to most of them up to a point.

The packaging itself (the plastic identity disc) looks good but not great. I expected the packaging to be a little big bigger considering that it would hold the discs inside. For me, I think it was a wrong design having all the blu-ray disc stack on top of each other. Personally, I didn't have a lot of problems open the case, but taking the discs out....was a whole different story. I have read some of the reviews and noticed a lot of complains about the way the discs are stacked and how it was hard to take the discs out. It took me about 15 seconds to figure out how to take the discs out of the case. I guess I was lucky with the set that I got.  The fact that there is no foam layer between the discs to protect them from each other is a huge letdown for me. As a DVD collector, I take a good care of the dvd's I get.....and the way they decided to store them is completely not acceptable to me.

I decided to buy thin foam sheets and cut them disc-sized so I could place them between the disks.

About the identity disc itself, it did light up, but you have to press the switch really hard. There are only a few LEDs inside that light up. It is not the entire disk. The plastic of the identity disc (storage case) looks and feel cheap.

Considering that I have other Collectible Packages(Lord of the Rings Trilogy), I was hoping to see a similar quality to those.",1302480000,,1593,4.122580645161291
4386252,5,B004IEBRSI,"I saw this movie multiple times in the theater as well as IMAX 3D. My 5 year old even likes it. It is defiently one of my favorite movies of all time. I was glad to see that Jeff Bridges was back. I was also glad to see them not go with a well known actor or actress for the other two lead roles. They both did very well. It makes me want to fallow there careers a little more now. My only question about the movie is where on earth did they get those contact lenses for the 4 girls changing Sam's clothes in the beginning.

I saw this film in theater twice(3D version) and of course as everyone knows it was great...Finally getting it and popping in the Blu-Ray at home of course really was quiet impressive. Stellar visuals as anyone would expect, the extras are sweet, and I have to mention the ""identity disk"" case which has a neat glow. Plus, I can't wait to watch the original Tron in Blu-ray!! definitely worth it",1302393600,,466,4.559523809523809
4386254,1,B004IEBRSI,"I bought this DVD because I wanted the 3D version along with the regular blu-ray and the original Tron. Thought the identity disc looked cool so I splurged and bought it. But I'm extremely disappointed with it. I was not aware that the identity disc (which is actually only as big as a DVD) is the case for all five discs. It's made of cheap plastic and the stand for it is not even shaped to hold the case properly. What's more, the case's clasp is cheap and ineffective, so it doesn't stay closed at all. Also, the button clasp which holds the discs in place is too tight making it very difficult get the discs out. Plus, the discs are stacked on top of each other which means if you want a particular disc you'll have to take out all the discs in front of it. This item's design was not very well thought out, especially for how much it costs. DO NOT BUY THIS COLLECTOR'S SET. You're better off buying all these DVD's/blu-rays separately, EVEN IF IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE. You've been warned.",1302307200,21,990,4.385869565217392

I am happy I did though. What I found was a great soundtrack, amazing special effects, and all over a very decent story line. The only downfall of this movie is the 3D version. For me, it's a headache seeing so much bright neon lights in 3D all over the place. I know a lot of people are writing reviews of this movie saying how bad it is. I say just watch it for yourself and prepare to be entertained. It's an Action Sci Fi, so just enjoy it for what it is. This movie is definitely meant for a HDTV for sure.
I don't buy a lot of movies because of iTunes, Amazon instant movies, or Netflix but this is one I put in my blu-ray collection.",1302307200,2,799,4.0

I was a little disappointed in the behind the scenes features, as they didn't go into the depth and length that the ones on the 20th anniversary special edition of the original did.

Regardless, if you will allow it, the movie will bring you into the digital world and take you on a wild rollercoaster of both sight and sound.

4386259,2,B004IEBRSI,As much as I loved the movie this collectors edition was not worth purchasing. It came with no blue ray cases or regular DVD cases. The Identity disk is smaller than I expected it to be and worse yet the Identity disk itself is the DVD case for all 4 of the disks (The digital copy only gets an external cardboard sleeve) To take the disks out of the case is nerve racking due to having to press the button and pull up on both ends of the disk one at a time where the fit is so snug that it causes the DVD to bend slightly. I have read some reviews after already opening mine seeing that people accidentally broke their disks trying to remove them from the case. They are also stacked on top of each other causing them to rub up against each other. The Disk itself looks pretty decent but the stand it rests on has a cheap feel to it due to the sticker placed on the front and back of the stand from the light bike scene. I would return this if I could however due to having opened the box already I would not be able to returned an opened movie. Overall I am displeased with this purchase.,1302220800,,1090,4.074418604651163

4386262,3,B004IEBRSI,"The only difference between the Identity Disc version and the 5-disc Combo (in standard Blu-ray Packaging) is the Identity Disc Case. All the other materials included are exactly the same.

The Identity Disc case lights up, but as a case, it isn't very good -- instead of having each DVD/Blu-ray being on a separate page, the discs are all stacked on top of each other. Additionally, the Identity Disc Case doesn't even hold all five discs of the set -- the fifth disc (Digital Copy) is included inside the cardboard backing envelope for the package and won't fit inside the Identity Disc case. The disc case is a little bigger than the DVD/Blu-ray discs that it holds. The discs are secured by a push tab, which is extremely hard to depress to release the discs.

The outer packaging is made out of the flexible, super thin plastic that Disney tends to use for their box sets.

For those that just want a display case for the discs, this is probably for you; but if you are like me and can see yourself pulling the discs out every time you want to watch the movie and possibly scratching them trying to pull them out of the case, the 5-disc in Blu-ray packaging will likely be much more satisfactory, and is a good $15-20 cheaper.

Additionally the 5-disc set in Blu-ray packing has a lenticular print on the blu-ray jacket.",1302134400,,1325,4.554621848739496

This is not a review of the disks themselves, I haven't even viewed them yet. I'm so disappointed in the crappy packaging that I actually paid extra for, and want to be worth justifying that extra cost.

Now I have to stuff this back into a box and ship it back and get another one in the hopes that I got a bum copy of the packaging. I'm not at all happy here.

4386264,3,B004IEBRSI,"I love this movie, don't care what people say, I enjoy it nuff said.

Now I really wanted to get into the meat and potatoes of the Limited Collectors disk and to bash and support those who have already wrote about it because some misconstrued how it was designed.

Ok so here we go...

The Identity Disk is made of a cheap feel plastic and is rather small for the $70 spent. Its only about a 1/8"" diameter bigger than the disks themselves which is quite disappointing.

The Blu-ray disks are also stacked on top of each other inside the Identity Disk. No dividers, no numerous pages of disks, just a stack as if you were to take 5 disks out of your drawer and stack them.

And to those who say it is difficult to pull out the disks without breaking them, I'm sorry to have to say this, but....ok I won't...but in the center there is a ""PUSH"" button. If you were to actually push this button while taking the discs out, there would be no broken discs. It was rather easy actually, I took them out with great ease.

There is a button on the Identity Disc case which make the strips light up. Although not very bright, it is a noticeable and satisfying blue color. Now...people say you have to actually hold the button to make it light up..FALSE...you press the button once it stays on...you press it again, it turns off..nuff said.

Finally the digital copy in fact comes in a separate paper shenanigan. Why?...No idea but it does bother me.

OVERALL: This is a fun little piece to have sitting around your room on display and it does its job well of holding the discs in place. Worth the $70? Definitely not. But I am a fan of Tron so it was a must to get this little toy and it does put a smile on my face.

4386265,4,B004IEBRSI,"Overall these were great movies. Tron had the story and the visuals were not only good in 1982 but still hold up today, especially when you watch the ""making of"" featurette.  A lot of painstaking time for the effects.  Tron Legacy lacked in deep story but made up for it in visuals.

The packaging was okay, I did not have too much trouble removing the discs from the cheap, plastic holder, but I was gentle and patient.  The stand for the display was made even worse due to the lack of ability to snap or set into the stand properly.  I would assume if it is repeatedly taken on and off the stand there will be wear on the disc.  It also had a sticker on the front and back that made it look cheap.  Overall, it isn't a bad collector's item, but I will be keeping the discs separate from the stand.  I also refrain from lighting it up except for when others want to see it.  The batteries appear to be watch style batteries which, if you leave it on constantly, will cost as much as the entire movie purchase.

The audio on the Blu-Ray version was mediocre at best.  It is true that the music was increased and decreased at certain points, but I believe that was a choice on the disc editor's idea of making the vocals and sound effects stand out.  My problem was that there was a popping sound trough out the movie (Blu-Ray only) during key scenes, making the movie un-enjoyable.

I am returning it to Amazon for an exchange since it was fairly easy to do, but I wanted people to know that if they have an issue like this, they are not alone.",1302134400,3,1544,4.2465753424657535
4386266,4,B004IEBRSI,"First thing I want to say is DON'T BUY THIS VERSION for $49.99
-Yes you get 5 discs including the original,BUT you can get all that and more for CHEAPER when you buy them separately.
-4 Disc Tron Legacy: $24.99. You get 3DBlu DVD,2d Blu DVD, Original DVD and Digital Copy
-2 Disc Tron Classic:$19.99. You get Blu ray DVD and Original DVD.

So right there you are saving some money AND getting an original dvd Tron Classic (if you need one). I ended up getting this at Best Buy since I have the $5 off Disney coupon for Legacy and it all came out to $42.77.
I still love Amazon though and they always have great deals. Why Disney made all these versions is beyond me. This whole 3,4,5 disc thing we have to deal with nowadays is getting lame.

On to the movie. Grew up with the original and it's one of those films I never forget from my childhood, much like Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark (make this HD already), and the Christopher Reeves Superman. I had high expectations for this film when it came out. It didn't disappoint, but I was still left wanting. The effects are crazy, but the 3D (which I saw in the theaters) was good,but not great. To this day, nothing really touches Avatar in terms of 3D, but whatever. Story for Legacy was very simple and acting did enough to drive the movie along. The reason I saw this movie was because of the effects and it did not let me down. I kind of figured the story wouldn't be anything ground breaking. But I do feel UNLESS you really grew up or had much admiration for the original Tron, there is a chance you will not like this film. But I can be wrong. My wife who is so picky and never really likes the films I am into, liked this one a lot and she never even saw the original.
A third film has been announced (making this a trilogy) and I will look forward to that and I think that can do a lot for this franchise. The extras on this film are really cool and leave the door open for a sequel (which we are getting).

So in closing, give this film a chance even if you just want to rent it on iTunes or something. But you need to watch it in HD to appreciate it. Good luck. END OF LINE.",1302048000,,2140,4.127098321342926

At Best Buy Online/Store right now until the end of the week 4/9/11 they have on sale the Tron Legacy 3D set for $24.99, i don't even have a 3D player but you never know what the future holds once they get a lot cheaper. But you get the 3D version, 2D version, DVD and digital copy. And Tron original 2 disc set gives you the blu ray and dvd for 19.99... But In the Five-Disc Combo: that includes both movies, I never read that it included the original tron on dvd, maybe I'm mistaken since I didn't purchase it.

So right now I have purchased both movies, 6 discs in all for $44.98. You can go on the disney website which is free membership and they give a free $5 coupon with a Tron legacy purchase and best buy has it that if you buy both movies together you get an additional $5 off. So all in all you get $10 off. I bought it for $44.98-$10.00=$34.98 with tax came out to be about $38.

I hope this information helps. Because I seriously debated about buying the 5 disc both movie combo for $49.99, but when i saw that you can get 6 discs for cheaper if you buy serperately then personally it was no contest.

4386268,5,B004IEBRSI,"I liked the movie. I read the critics (who seemed to hate it) and listoned to friends (mixed, if passionate reviews either way). As with the original Tron, this is about a man's quest to overcome obstacles in order to get home. I liked Garret Hedlund's character, Sam Flynn. Emotionally scarred after losing his father at a young age, Sam comes off as devil may care, reckless and unambitious, at least that is how he wants to come off. In reality, he is more. Sam clearly has his father's smarts, he is brave, and though he does not want to appear it, earnest, sabotaging some of the ambitions of Encon's board members who ridicule his principled mentor, Alan Bradley. Opposite Bridges, Hedlund appears sad, bewildered, a little angry but clearly still very much loves his father. Though young, he is  very much a young man with some years under his belt. His face reflects a life that includes some difficult experiences. I also liked Olivia Wilde as Quarra. She is a fierce fighter, but is also very much the little girl who looks at Keven Flynn as a father figure, a man she loves and respects and is fascinated by his stories about the outside world. Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner reprise their roles and Keven Flynn and Alan Bradley/Tron respectively. Unfortunately, the part did it for me the least was where they portrayed younger selves. Where Bridges and Boxleitner played their characters with corresponding ages, it worked, but did not work quite as well with the CGI younger versions of theirselve, Bridges as Clu and Boxleitner as Tron. CGI may still have a way to go. Bridges in particular impressed me. As Kevin Flynn, he was definitely the grieving father who never lost his love for his son and the twenty years of seperation have affected him. Those who wondered how he got his ""Jedi"" powers forget he showed similiar powers in the original Tron. I think CGI affected Bridges' portrayal of Clu, who is relentless, cagey and an ambitious antagonist, but the CGI does not capture nearly enough nuances of his facial expressions as Bridges was able to do as the elder Flynn. I was glad to see Boxleitner brought back to his old role, but the role was too underdeveloped. He clearly respects the elder Flynn and as a result is not popular with the rest of the boars. He has also taken the effort to look after the younger Flynn. Still, I missed the presence Boxleitner brought to the earlier movie.
I liked Tron Legacy. I am no critic. The special effects were great, and as in the original Tron, they are part of what sells the movie, and complements the story. Having said that, I liked this movie. I found the story interesting. I thought the story moved along, the characters were fleshed out (that part I really liked), and as in the original Tron, there were subtle subplots and subtle cautionary themes. I enjoyed the movie. I was entertained, I was never bored, and when it was over, I felt watching this movies was a pleasant way to spend two hours",1302048000,12,2976,4.647058823529412
4386269,1,B004IEBRSI,"These reviews are supposed to be about the product, not the movie, and that's what this review is. Bottom line. Don't waste your money. Buy the discs in their basic packaging and move on. This is really a VERY disappointing collectible. It's not even a good ""toy"". First, the ""memory disc"" case is all plastic. Cheap plastic. So cheap, that I received mine with a broken clip. The disc does not stay closed. The lighting is poor. Several badly placed LEDs which don't distribute the light evenly. The movie discs are stored inside, in a stack, with no separators. Poor, poor, poor.

I purchased the J.J. Abram's Star Trek Limited Edition Collector Set two years ago. THAT was a real collectible set. Blu-Ray, DVD, digital copy in the original style packaging and then placed in a box set that contained the Sterling Silver and Pewter replica of the Starship Enterprise. A real collectible. Solid and in full detail.

This collectible is a representative of the movie itself. It falls far short of the original and bland. Sadly, it doesn't even try to blind you with gloss.

This collectible should have been, at minimum, in anodized aluminum with accurate lighting. They sure charged enough money to make you think so.

4386270,2,B004IEBRSI,"How much you enjoy this sequel will depend largely on how much pale orange and blue you can tolerate as these are the only colors present in this dull and dingy cash in from Disney.  The original film (which still looks amazing in its new bluray transfer) throbbed with vivid primary colors and imaginative design.  This film seems sad and dirty in comparison and while the visuals are more polished in a techinical sense, they fail to impress because they look like every other big budget CGI fest that studios crank out today.  I expected this to at least LOOK like TRON but it never really does.  Yes, it seems INSPIRED by the original but it never comes close to looking like it.  One huge fault is in the costume design.  The chracters no longer look like they are part of the interior of a vast electronic landscape, instead they seem to be making a bad fashion statemnt.  It also appears as if anyone new to this environment comes in wearing their street clothes and gets dressed in the requisite electroware by female automotans who would look more at home on a fashion show runway than in a sci-fi film.  The entire look of the film is off.  Everything (even in the real world) has been subjected to a color desaturation process that looks fake, dreary and quite ugly. The decision to take the design of TRON out of an ""electrical world"" and give it an environment with clouds, mountains, rain etc also takes away from the feeling that you are watching TRON.

What the film does have going for it is a fairly decent story (at least in the first half).  I bought into it and found myself liking where it went.  Unfortunately, the tepid, by the numbers script never fulfills the promise of the story and it becomes a predictable yawn inducing bore.  Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner are quite good and do the best with what they have to work with.  I thought the CGI Flynn was actually pretty decent and it didn't bother me a bit.  It was one of the few aspects of the film I enjoyed. Apparetly sometime in the last 30 years Flynn developed Jedi superpowers as well.  Newcomer Garrett Hedlund is also pretty good as Flynn's son and he gets a lot of mileage out of the one facial expression he seems capable of making (sort of a petulant frown).  Olivia Wilde fails to register on screen and Michael Sheen goes so over the top that he stops being funny after about 30 seconds and becomes cringe worthy ridiculous.

I bought the TRON films in their seperate, two disc bluray editions.  The original film gets a pretty decent selection of extra materials that includes some new exclusives, all the original DVD material and a commentary track.  The LEGACY film gets a few brief short doc segments and tons of advertisments for Disney films, and tutorials on how to use their latest gimmicks.  The transfers for both films are excellent.  I was not bothered by the switching aspect rations of LEGACY as it was done so well that I almost didn't notice it.

I don't mean to sound too harsh about TRON: LEGACY as it is far better than most Disney product but ultimately, that is exactly what this sequel is.  It isn't a genuine movie or work of art in the way the original film was.  It is just another Disney PRODUCT.",1302048000,2,3219,4.508620689655173
4386271,5,B004IEBRSI,"I wasn't around when the original Tron was released. But I have always had a healthy appetite for sci-fi movies and Tron is considered to be one of the best around. I watched bits and pieces of Tron all throughout my life, but I never sat down and watched it from start to finish until about one year ago. I will concede that this movie was not very story-driven, if at all. But Tron is a charming and visually impacting (even to this day) movie. It essentially created a world that had never been seen before. All the actors are top-notch and the visual effects still look unique. When Tron: Legacy was announced, I was excited. All the trailers and all the hype surrounding the movie was, in my opinion, well deserved. I saw Tron: Legacy in 3D, and even though everyone seems to agree that the 3D was amazing, I was unimpressed. The visual effects were amazing and even a little extraordinary at times, but I was more enthralled by the set pieces and the the visual style of the film. I really enjoyed this movie. In my opinion it should have been a contender for best visual effects in the academy awards. But my favorite part of the film is, without a doubt, the soundtrack. I love Daft Punk, I basically grew up with their music and this album really proves that they are extremely versatile. This soundtrack truly sold the film. Every scene was made that much more powerful with the accompanying score. I, for one, hope that Tron turns into a successful franchise. I hope that they keep exploring The Grid and the infinite possibilities that come along with it.",1302048000,3,1567,4.52112676056338

Also its a real pain just to get the discs out of the case they didn't cut the side finger grooves deep enough. The biggest let down was the fact that no where on the front of the box does it tell you that there is no digital copy for the original Tron all you see is The ultimate TRON Experience 2 - movie collection Blu-Ray 3-D + Blu-Ray 2D + DVD + Digital Copy 2-Movie Colection.....on the back in small print it stats that disc 4 is only digital copy for Tron Legacy.

However, this movie seemed disjointed and forced and you could tell they spent all the time trying to create a visual spectacular (no), but little or no time on an actual story that made sense or even flowed well. The CG Flynn was horrible and kept taking me out of the experience. Surely Disney animators could have created a better visual that that.

If I had spent any time and money seeing that at the theater last December, angry would not even begin to describe how I would have felt coming out of the theater after Tron:Legacy ended. I think I am a bit pissed about that 5 dollars last night....",1302048000,2,732,4.4222222222222225
4386275,5,B004IEBRSI,"The five-star rating is principally for the original film. I'm not sure I've made up my mind about the sequel. About which, more later.

WARNING! The LFE track is 10dB higher than it ""should"" be. If you have a separate woofer, you might want to lower its level before the movie starts. Double-ditto if you run the LFE through your main speakers.

Like other viewers, I'm not happy with the sound of either film. The dialog is generally at too-low a level. The mixers apparently wanted the sound effects to overwhelm the viewer, so setting the dialog at a ""normal"" level might make the effects overly loud. Your reaction will vary with your taste and your speakers. I cranked up the volume 6dB and found the results satisfactory, but experimentation is called for.

The highlight of this set is the first film. Though not well-directed (Lisberger was unable to build, relax, and re-build tension), it retains is extreme visual novelty. The superb (and that's an understatement!) CGI of the sequel is so realistic, that much of the sense of being in a strange new world is /lost/. As with Jackson's ""King Kong"" remake, this is another example of where ""cruder"" is more-effective, and less is more.

""TRON"" was the last film shot on 70mm stock, and (in the real-world sequences, especially) is sometimes spectacular. Only the IMAX elements of the sequel come close to matching it.

The sequel's Daft Punk music is also poor, the typical ""background drone"" of too many films. The memorable Carlos score of the first significantly aided in creating the film's mood.

The sequel also suffers from the tautological illogic of the original, only more so. ""Rules"" exist, and things happen, for no reason other than to drive the plot. This gets particularly bad when Flynn describes the sudden appearance of the isomorphic algorithms, which showed up simply because the time was right. It's a shame the Bhuddist consultant Jeff Bridges hired to add a ""spiritual subtext"" didn't pay attention to the script as a whole. The story has a lot of interesting ideas, but they're not well-developed.

On the positive side... Flynn plays Go. (This is only the third American film in which Go is referred to.) It's a bit of joke, too, as Flynn would (presumably) not want to play chess, as the Master Control Program was originally a chess game.

""TRON: Legacy"" is a generally entertaining, but not highly compelling, film. I doubt I will be returning to it often. Though it develops what is implicit in ""TRON"" in a clever way, it lacks the novelty of the original.

I hate to say this  -- especially as Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors, and I've written a terrific script for him and Robert Duvall -- but he's getting ""goofy"" and undisciplined. ""TRON Legacy"" is not one of his better performances. Bobby needs to sit him down and lecture him on the facts of artistic life.",1302048000,,2862,4.775303643724697
4386276,3,B004IEBRSI,"I bought the 5 disk combo in the identity disk packaging.  As others have pointed out, the packaging is a bit on the cheap side.  For the $60ish you're spending for this, you'd expect a bit higher quality packaging job.  The quality of the case is actually worse than the toys released for the movie.

On top of the poor and cheap package quality, the disks are stacked inside one on top of the other.  While I realize Blu-ray disks have an anti-scratch coating, that doesn't make them impervious to scratches.  This is especially true when in such close proximity during shipping.  Worse, though, is that it's difficult to remove the disks from the packaging without feeling like you're going to break either a disk or the package.  Basically, as with most collectible packages, it was made for form and not function.  So don't expect the disks to be easily managed inside the identity disk.  You'd probably do better to buy a 5 disk Blu-ray cover and transfer the disks to that.  Note, of course, there is no cover art to put it into a Blu-ray cover. So, you'll have to go buy a separate blue cased release for that.

Now, onto the movie transfer.  While the 2D version of Tron Legacy looks good, there's one issue.  For some inexplicable reason (but is described before the movie starts), the transfer alternates between 2.35:1 aspect (letterbox) and 16:9 full frame.  I don't know why this was done as I don't recall Tron Legacy making this change during the theatrical release.  To me, this is basically another form of pan and scan.  Personally, I would have preferred either an entirely full letterbox release or a full 16:9 frame release.  Or, even better, both versions on the disk as separate viewable releases.  This toggling thing as an all-in-one release (just to satisfy some IMAX thing) is just baffling, unexpected and an unnecessary distraction.

Don't buy into this Blu-ray disk expecting a constant 2.35:1 (or even a constant 16:9) aspect as it toggles back and forth.  This toggling aspect wasn't done on the original Tron blu-ray disk included in this set.  On the other hand with Tron (original film), the grain is a bit on the high side in places and the colors seem a bit overly vibrant, but is still far better quality than what we had in the DVD release.

Also note, the digital copy disk is not inside the identity disk.  Instead, this disk was shipped packaged separately into the backboard package (along with various literature).  I guess only 4 disks actually fit into the identity disk case.

Pros: Reasonably good transfers of both films
Cons: Bad case design, poor quality case (cheap plastic), stacked disks, unexpected and unnecessary aspect toggling during Tron Legacy

Updated: I also realized I should probably review the movie itself.  Note, I also give the movie 3 stars for effort in story.  In fact,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TRON-Evolution/dp/B0030MOTNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TRON: Evolution</a>&nbsp;actually has a much better story than Tron Legacy. In fact, I firmly believe Tron Evolution would have made a better film than Tron Legacy. So, you probably owe it to yourself to play Tron Evolution to get the full story behind the ISOs. Anyway, onto the film review...

Tron Legacy is about digital perfection. The issue with 'perfection' as an ideal is that it's an ever changing idea. If you design a program to seek 'perfection', it will be only operate within the constraints of its limited algorithm designed at a single point in time. That seems the idea and difference between the ISOs and programs. ISOs could change their own code structure at will and alter their original programming design to better themselves. CLU could not do this and his programming ideals remained firmly locked in a past non-changing idea of perfection. CLU's unalterable limited vision given to him by Kevin led CLU to believe that the ISO's self-alteration was an imperfection in need of extermination. Therefore, CLU's idea to seek perfection was, at the time, a naive vision born of Kevin Flynn. As Kevin matured and aged, his own idea of perfection altered to his age, wisdom and ideals. Unfortunately, CLU wasn't 'updated' to these changing ideals.

So, in CLU's defense, I don't see CLU's behavior as a problem. He was just carrying out what he was programmed to do. What I do see as an issue is that CLU wasn't truly a villain. At least, not in the sense of doing something with the intent to cause harm for personal gain. CLU was never motivated by personal gain. He was motivated by Kevin's flawed ideal of perfection. This is where Tron Legacy's story begins to unravel. The lack of a true villain in Tron Legacy leaves the film unsatisfying. Without a true antagonist, the story falls flat and leaves the viewer wondering what happened. This is the single biggest problem with Tron Legacy.  Comparing the MCP in Tron to CLU in Tron Legacy, there is no comparison.  The MCP was technically an ISO and, at the same time, a true villain because the MCP was greedy and motivated by personal gain (as was Ed Dillinger). Neither Kevin nor CLU were villains nor were either of them motivated by personal gain.  Both were merely victims of circumstances.  For CLU to be a true villain, that would mean Kevin also had to become a villain.  The writers didn't dare to tread there.  In hindsight, they should have.

Enter Sam. When Sam enters the grid, he's immediately caught up in this battle between CLU's perceived perfection and the ISO struggles.  Unfortunately, the story spends so much time on this premise that it forgets to have fun with the wonderment of being in this new stunningly visual world.  It forgets that we need to see Sam having fun and, at the same time, skillfully win important battles.  Instead, Sam fumbles his way through the entire movie accidentally with not one substantial win to call his own.  Worse, Tron, who was front and center in Tron, clearly takes a back seat role in Tron Legacy for 90% of the film. Overall, the film needed a much stronger villain.  A villain that Sam can easily identify and go after.  Tron Legacy leaves us hanging without closure as a result.",1302048000,,6191,4.866412213740458

4386282,5,B004IEBRSI,"I was introduced to the original TRON film back in the 90's, true it was released when I was a kid, but back then I didn't watch too much TV or movies.

There are a couple of strong points to the movie which make it one of my favorite movies.
First of all, as a Christian, (even though not intentionally done, I'm sure) The Movie has a connection to the Gospel, from a computer geek's point of view.
The Master control represents the devil, and the programs that work for him represent the fallen angels (demons).
The computer world represents our world, and the programs taken captive represent those who are trapped in sin.
Flynn represents Jesus as Jesus is the only one who can save us from our sins and do for us, what we couldn't do for ourselves.  Likewise, Flynn had to do for the computer world and the trapped programs, what they couldn't do for themselves to be free.  He gives himself to free the computer world of it's oppression, as Jesus died and gave himself for us.

The second thing I really like is the animation/live action the retro computer look, sound and the overall movie layout.  So in addition to the spiritual connection in this film, I think it's an overall fun film to watch.

TRON legacy, did a good Job of keeping the basic themes from the original tron, but I think it ended up telling a whole new story, while keeping the basic outline and themes from the original movie.

The graphics, and effects were well done in the new movie, and I think it was a nice timeframe upgrade, without overdoing things.

If I ever want to upgrade to 3D, I'll have the movie in 3D as well, since I bought the 5 Disc set.

My closing thoughts would be,  Good Job on the restoration of TRON and a very good job on the creation of TRON legacy.",1301961600,2,1756,4.358895705521473
4386283,4,B004IEBRSI,"All in all I think Legacy is a better movie than the original. Better directed, sound, and acting. While I think the plot was on par with the original. Also, the film just looks great, the art direction is phenomenal. As a sequel though I think they kind of dropped the ball on it's potential. Instead of exploring a ""Grid"" with personified modern technology, they instead chose to go into a ""Grid"" only slightly more advanced than the original. Effectively bringing absolutely nothing new to the Grid other than a new special effects paint job.

Legacy has 4 different blu ray options, one of which is a bad deal here on amazon. The 5 disc edition (not the identity disc set)costs $50. That means it's $5 cheaper to just buy the 4 disc combo at $25 and then buy the original Tron on blu ray for $20. You save $5 and you get the original Tron in it's own box and a 2nd disc for dvd format.",1301961600,3,889,4.323353293413174
4386284,3,B004IEBRSI,"I pre-ordered this Collectible Set with high hopes that it would be a very nice additional to my wall of dvd Collectibles ... I must say that I am a little (if not a lot) disappointed.

I have found that over the years the quality of the collectitibles has gone down hill ... both in size and over all quality.

This sadly has suffered from the same fate.

Over all it comes with a number of DVD's and Blu-Ray's, The orginal special edition of Tron, the DVD of Tron Legacy (as well as a digital copy), the Blu-Ray version of Tron: Legacy, and lastly the Blu-Ray (3D only) version of Tron: Legacy.  Which is great for the price.

But the disks (save the digital copy) are all located INSIDE and STACKED on top of each in the back of the Collectiable Idenity Disk and held in place with a very tough disk locking tab (I broke a finger nail in an effort to remove the disks).  So do be careful removing the disks not only to prevent damaging them but also be careful with the Idenity Disk as well.  I'm going to get some Empty DVD cases and place the disks in those for easier access.

Now the IDENITY DISK ... now I wasn't expecting a solid metal super, ultra, high quality item, but I was expecting the Idenity Disk to be about the size of a smallish frise-bee.  BE AWARE that the Idenity Disk is only slightly (and I do mean Slightly) larger than a DVD.  The overall construction is okay and it is cool looking, from a distance, but up close it feels and looks cheap.  It does light up ... but just barely ... in a completly dark room it looks cool, but other wise ... meh. =/.  The stand that the disk sets in is fairly cheapish and it feels flimsy but it does do the job of holding the Idenity Disk.  Note:  the batteries for the Idenity Disk are replaceable should you ever want or need to do so.

Overall I am satified with my purchase and the extras that entail this collecter edition ... but I am dissappointed as well.

As for other DVD collectors out there ... I would only buy this if you are a die hard collector or fan of the Tron movies ... otherwise ... save you money and get the DVD's or Blu-Ray's seperatly.",1301875200,166,2123,4.204938271604938

This would have been really cool in 3D, but this is the type of movie Blu-Ray players were made for.  Very exciting to look at and is much faster paced then the original.  The only problem with the movie in my opinion is that when no action is going in it slows way down.  Luckelly there is something going on for about 80% of the movie.

This movie was definitely a breath of fresh air with all the other crap movies continuously coming out. Ever since I saw The Big Lebowski Jeff Bridges has always been one of my favorite actors and even now he blows me away. People may have disliked the reanimated younger Jeff Bridges, but i thought it was definitely an improvement among mediocre cgi and i think thats what we still need to do with new special effects and animations is to explore newer ways of improving skills we have now and make new ways of making the gen of entertainment, but alas to each is own and i know other people don't feel this way. When it comes to the movie i give it a 5/5 with amazing action, music (daft punk one of my favorite artists as well), and characters in this movie.

When it comes to this movie pack i see they have the classic tron in blu-ray along with tron legacy but one thing makes it all horrible is the 3d and dvd packed into the package. I see the only aspect of getting this edition is to get both movies in one for blu-ray, but the fact is no one uses the dvd they get for a blu-ray package and they stack more features to get more money for the product. If the deal is cheaper to buy the movies separately in blu-ray I say go for it, but of course even just getting the blu-ray versions also come with dvd combo so either way you can't win.

Why am I writing a review for a Disney Blockbuster, when I generally never bother writing reviews on Amazon, and when as a film student who has seen hundreds of ""masterpieces"" and important films, there *should* be a thousand others I should be writing about?

Watch this film, and you will have your answer. Or better yet, win the lotto, rent an IMAX theater, and watch it. Again. And again. And again.... Only then will you understand.

Two things:
1 - I almost *never* go to the movies. I watch dozens of films each year. But they are, for the most part, not the types you see in theaters.
2 - I took a 2 hour roundtrip to watch this film on an IMAX theater. Not once. Not Twice.... Three times. (And it would have been Four if they were still screening it)

Again, the question is, WHY?

Because this film is, plain and simple, a Masterpiece. And watching it on IMAX was, I dare say, one of the most gratifying, satisfying, electrifying, experiences of my life. Woooahh says you... better than skydiving, watching a full moon on the outer walls of a Czech castle, or roaming around Chichen Itza at night???

Not better. But different...in the realm of ENTERTAINMENT, watching this film is definitely one of the ultimate highlights.

Again, WHY?

The story? Apart from the concept of the GRID, it is still reduced to the classic good guys vs bad guys story. Of course good guy wins, and gets the girl at the end. What did you expect?
Dialogue? - Cheesy lines from the main actor. Sad, but true.
Acting? - OK at best. The highlight was Castor -and he was a secondary character-

In other words, as a film, on paper, it is simply another Blockbuster. Designed to entertain, and make money. Not to redefine cinematic boundaries or be a medium-changing event.

The thing is, IT IS. WHY IS THIS FILM SO !$^# GOOD?
IT. itself. the experience. its ""core"" or whatever you want to call it. WHOEVER SAID ""YOU DONT LOOSE ANYTHING BY NOT WATCHING IT IN 3D"", IS WRONG. Oh so wrong. Never listen to them again.

This movie *IS* 3D. It is not normal-theater-3D either, it is *best-Imax-theater-in-state-3D.* Whoever didn't see this in Imax has missed a defining moment in the history of cinema. And I can say this -as a film student- with a straight face.

Because in 3D -Imax 3D- The visual *is* the film.
And in Imax 3D, the Audio *is* the film.

Together, VISUALS AND AUDIO transcend the film itself. They transport it from the realm of entertainment, to the realm of VISIONS. And you cannot experience this in a 50"" plasma with surround sound in the same way you can in a larger than life screen with with an audio system designed to churn up your entrails and rattle every bone in your body.

 BUT YOU BETTER WELL TRY!

Because Daft Punk has created one of the most amazing soundtracks ever. And the visuals in 3D -coupled with the audio, you CANNOT separate them- can transport you into another realm.

Yes, the acting is merely ok. Yes, the dialogue leaves A LOT to be desired. Yes, it is not terribly original. Yes and yes and yes and yes to any criticism the academics and and film critics want to level against it.

BECAUSE, WHO CARES? It doesnt matter ONE BIT.

Because the soundtrack is GODLY. And the visuals, together with the soundtrack, are something from another world.

So once again:

Buy this film. Buy it, then buy the biggest TV you can. And the Loudest surround-sound system you can. Then sit down, live it, and cry, knowing there is no tv big enough, or sound system loud enough, to make justice to the EXPERIENCE that is Tron Legacy.

A piece of crap in 3D on an IMAX screen is still a piece of crap. Let's see...how do I bring this home? The single best thing about the movie is the leather jacket Sam Flynn was wearing early in the film. That gets the single star. I suppose the initial flash of art direction and set design get a bit of props but geez, the acting is pathetic, the direction pitiful. The script is a hodgepodge of ideas and lines from other sci-fi films of the last 35 years.  This thing is an unqualified disaster.

The logo just feels wrong and I had people telling me they wouldn't watch it because it was from Disney. The logo feels old and low-tech when compared with the revolutionary ambition of this flick.
I love Daniel Simon and I hoped his extraordinary designs would (finally) have some ""practical use"" in Tron Legacy. But the shallowness of the movie sort of buried his genius. Just take a look at the pre-order cancellations for Hot Toys 1/6 Tron's bike.
I love action/fiction films and I'm known for having a high degree of tolerance as far as plots go. I even watch European sci-fi cinema and often enjoy it (lol). But Tron has, at least, one major flaw: putting it simply: it lacks TENSION. I'll take no argument on that. That's why a lot of people come out saying its boring. Without tension, fantastic visuals can't hold the plot on their own.
I also think that ""digital"" Young Flynn looks fake and, as time goes by and technologies advance, it will age quickly. They probably should have gone with a new actor that would simply resemble young Flynn. It shows serious effort but perhaps the technology is not up for it yet.
I also get that ""familiar plot"" feeling that doesn't help at all.
I like Michael Sheen but his character seems ""forced"" and again ""familiar"" somehow. I don't know if it's an attempt to match Fifth Element's Ruby Rod but... let's just say Chris Tucker nailed it big time.
On a more positive note, I liked all the girls, soundtrack and some of the visuals.

4386297,5,B004IEBRSI,"I saw this film in a theater featuring D-Box seating.  For those not familiar with D-Box,  these seats move like a simulator ride in an amusement park.  They are more subtle and don't intend to move you abruptly or beat you up, like theme park counterparts.  They are sychronized with the motion on screen.  They added an amazing element to the movie.  When Sam does a backflip off the Encom tower, the chair suddely tilts you back, a slight thud as he deploys his chute followed by a gentle floating sensation as he floats down to the ground and a knock through the chair when he gets hung up on the traffic light.  That was just one example.  The movie itself, sensory candy.  The visuals and the music, I found to be stunning.  I don't buy many soundtrack albums, let alone listen to them on a regular basis.  I have found myself walking around humming some of this music, even after a month since I have seen the movie.  The story itself was not the greatest, but it held my interest.  I noticed they took a Star Trek approach to this movie over the original.  J.J. Abrams made his Star Trek film with a non Trekker in mind.  He didn't use alot of Star Trek speak.  The original Tron had alot of computer lingo and terms that the average person probably wouldn't know or understand.  This film didn't have any of it.  If you haven't seen the original film, you might have a little trouble understanding some of the events in Legacy until about halfway through.

I only hope at some point the good folks at D-Box will develope a home version of their amazing seating that has a price a little more down to earth.  I will find it hard to sit through this movie again without the motion seats.  I'm sure the Blu Ray will carry the coding for D-Box as part of the package, when someday more people can experience it in a much more engaging way.

I had difficulty relating to it because it was so visually different from anything I had seen before.  The plot confused me; there was so much going on.  But somehow I felt drawn to the movie.  The ending moved me, but I wasn't sure why.

So I went back and saw it a second time.  I came away much more impressed.  The plot made much more sense to me.  I began to feel more at home in the alien digital world.  My wife and I saw it again -- this time at an IMAX theater, and I was blown away.  The visuals were so sharp and colorful and the sound was exquisite.  I was completely hooked on Daft Punk's terrific soundtrack and I wanted to see it again.  But unfortunately, the movie had left theaters in my area.

So I was very excited to see the release of the home collections.  Obviously they won't be able to rival the IMAX experience.  And I don't have a 3D TV.  But the BluRay should bring clarity to the vast world of Tron: Legacy and I'll be able to watch it as much as I want.  I'm glad Disney is including a digital copy, so I can travel with the movie.  And I'm glad the original Tron (Why oh why are they redundantly calling it ""The Original Classic""?) has been given a restoration.  This should be a terrific collector's set!",1296777600,25,1360,4.1183206106870225
4386302,5,B004IEBRSI,Watching this movie in IMAX was well worth my time and money. Loved nearly every aspect of the film.  Can't wait to play this film on repeat on a 3D home theater system.,1296777600,3,169,4.121212121212121
4386303,2,B004IEBRSI,"can't agree more with the official product review.  while a sight to behold, Legacy's script makes Transformers seem Shakespearean.  Disney should have plonked every bit of dialog, every scene with an overacting stereotype, and released this as a 10 minute Daft Punk music video.

two stars for bundling the infinitely better original Tron on Blu-ray, otherwise zero.",1296691200,15,367,5.4035087719298245
8430627,5,B004IEBRSI,"The original TRON is an iconic film featuring Bruce Boxleitner and Jeff Bridges. Even today the effects are still great to appreciate and the story is fantastic. TRON Legacy picks up years later with Flynn's son. The continuity, with the return of Bruce and Jeff, make the second installment fit seemlessly into the universe of the original film. The effects in TRON Legacy are crisp and hold to the original lighting scheme of the original wherein the lighting is inverted. Rather than being lit from without, sunlight or light fixtures the lighting instead comes from the characters and set pieces, all very cleverly done and conceived. If you are a fan of the original movie you will almost certainly become a fan of the long awaited sequel. The set is a great addition to the sci-fi library of any true genre fan.",1528761600,,817,4.76056338028169
