8700098,4,B00T20RX7W,This has to be the most intense Korean police series I have ever seen. I was exhausted just watching and sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what will take place next. Great cast. Great writing and wonderful subtitles. I bought the DVD as I liked it so much.,1458086400,,268,4.173076923076923
