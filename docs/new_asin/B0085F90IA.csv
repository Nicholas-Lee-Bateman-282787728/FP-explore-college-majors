This is a video about how one person's poor planning can become everyone's problem!  I looked for the story in it, but couldn't find one, so I shut it off.",1341187200,,275,4.0
8525571,5,B0085F90IA,"Ms. Matthys shows you a side of NYC that you'd never understand, until you see this ""momentary"".  It's heartwarming, heartbreaking and very educational without trying to be so.  And the ""3 C"" concept is a good one.  I will watch this video many times. Kudos to Ms. Matthys!!!!  Job VERY well done!

8525572,5,B0085F90IA,"An amazing documentary that keeps you entertained and amazed. Any parent who never saw NYC or ever thought of life what life was like raising a child in the Big Apple, should see this!
Sheryl Matthys  nearly 9 months pregnant talks to other city mothers and negotiates the streets and subways of New York.

The movie is funny, insightful and uplifting.
A true eye opener to regular mom's across this great land who have never had to consider putting up $25,000 for pre-K!!!!

The documentary flows naturally and is reality  at it's best. No staged events.

I thoroughly enjoyed viewing NYC and it's challenges through the eyes of a midwestern farm girl -huh should I say farm Mom""? (Is that politically correct for NYC?)

8525573,5,B0085F90IA,What a great story! This documentary has such a compelling message and is a fun watch! Very entertaining and inspirational.  I highly recommend you watch this video and share this page with your friends. The 3 C's that are lessons within the documentary are lessons that are unfortunately lacking in this day and age... the sorta of lessons that every child should learn. It's too bad that most adults I meet don't possess these 3 C's  :),1340064000,,438,4.675324675324675
