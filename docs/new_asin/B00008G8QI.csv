1844950,5,B00008G8QI,"In 1998, I saw this on Sci-Fi at about three in the morning and was completely blown away.  This is the perfect representation of the kind of anime that hooked me back in the early nineties (it seems the best stuff came out around the mid-eighties to mid-nineties).
In the distant future, a brilliant scientist creates what should've ensured the survival of the human race; a species of powerful robots whose sole obejective is to protect the earth.  However after a brief analysis, the robots come to the conclusion that the earth's greatest threat......is us.  As the world is thrown into an apocalypse of destruction at the hands of  its protectors, the man responsible makes a fateful decision to once again use his gifts for the betterment of mankind.  His own son, he transforms into Casshan; the lost hope for the human race and the robot army's greatest foe.  What follows is some of the best action anime I've ever seen.  Highly recommended.
Also, the live action version of Casshan, called Casshern, just hit theaters last month in Japan.  I'm hoping for a theatrical release stateside, but if not, I'll be waiting on the DVD.  As of this date (6-26-04), the trailer can be found at themovieboxdotnet.  A HUGE production value went into this thing and it looks to be more of a live action anime than the matrix trilogy could ever be.",1088208000,,1343,4.725321888412017
1844951,4,B00008G8QI,"ADV mislabeled the DVD as vol. 2 on its packaging. Amazon just went by what it sees on the label. Its a pretty good DVD, it's technically the special edition of Casshan with a japanese dub included as one of the special features. I like the show myself but people who don't like older anime probably won't like it.",1087776000,8,314,4.338983050847458
1844952,2,B00008G8QI,"I felt a little ripped off, when I got volume 1 and 2 together as an offer from Amazon. Com. Movie wise, volume 2 is actually exactly the same as volume 1, with volume 2 having the option for japanese dialog and Eng subtitle. Amazon could have at least indicated that in the ""description"".",1077408000,21,289,4.37037037037037
1844953,5,B00008G8QI,"what's fascinating is that this movie is a revamp of the ealier casshan series back in japan 75. but the premise is very familiar to scifi movie buffs. imaging john o' connor from the terminator machine wars, but with superpowers. casshan  is a great series with a bittersweet finale. the designs, fight scenes, intro themes and story pacing  are compared to other tatsunoko shows/ovas like gatchaman and hurricane polymar. which means it's an instant hit. the main villian black king boss controls a robo naziesque goverment which enslaves and exterminates humans who are surviving in a post apocolyptic enviorment. and it's up to casshan and his pet cyber pooch to save humanity by destroying the IRON EVIL but at the price of his humanity. good storyline with of course pathos. If your a fan of the Magnus robot fighter comics or even a scifi enthusiast,
then casshan is  well worth the purchase if not rental.",1077408000,,913,4.877419354838709
1844954,5,B00008G8QI,"I first saw this movie about ten years ago on the sci-fi channel and it blew me away with its story line, let alone its animation. I own many anime movies  (most current: Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust) and tv series type anime like star blazers (the entire quest for Iscandar series and soon to have the comet empire series), but this is one of my all time favorite full length motion picture anime movies. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes anime with a lot of action and a good story line. It will be available on DVD very soon and I already have pre-ordered it as I have been waiting a long time for a DVD version to become available. Check it out for yourself, you won't be dissapointed!",1051574400,,702,4.318181818181818
1844955,5,B00008G8QI,"I first saw this movie in the sci-fi channel a few years back, and recently borrowed it from a friend, after watching it again I love it even more than before, good animation, although a step below princess mononoke or VHD, still it holds it's own, great story line, Casshan fights to stop an evil android who wants to destroy mankind in order to preserve nature and save the world(basically the bad guy is trying to do good but feels like he's misunderstood), overall, if you like action movies with robots and explosions then this anime is for you.
a timeless anime classic i'm sure anyone would like, GET IT NOW!!!",1049846400,,617,4.5675675675675675
1845024,4,B00008G8QI,"I ordered this after having seen the final part of the Casshern Sins series. The storyline of these 4 episodes made more sense, particularly in the motivations of the villains and protagonists. Luna's love for Casshan and the conflict between his robotic reasoning and his human feelings lent a surprisingly touching air to the overall story.

The animation was definitely old-school, having a hand-drawn quality rather than a high-gloss CG feeling. Slow-motion and image repeating is used to good effect. The soundtrack is a rich orchestral sound that gives it a cinematic quality.  The introduction of the robotic swan is really gorgeous.

The only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 was the uneven vocal and occasional clunky animation.  For example, the narrator is a bit intrusive and the Japanese catchphrase ""If Casshan doesn't do it, who will?"" is a tad cheesy. I listened to both tracks. I must admit that I preferred the English voice actress.  The original Japanese voice actress for Luna sounded shrill at odd times.  The English actress because she had a quality that reminded me of old SF actresses (e.g. Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers) and seemed to fit this genre well.",1372377600,4,1183,4.89
1845025,5,B00008G8QI,"Sci-Fi channel aired this decades ago during this week of anime thing they had going.  It was the Wednesday night show that week, with Demon City Shinjuku being Monday, Lily C.A.T. being Tuesday, 8-man After being Thursday, and the crazy Project A-Ko Battle One: Gray Side, Battle Two: Blue side on Friday.  The story begins after machines have taken over the planet, plunging mankind into slavery.  A resistance group plots a coup, when the mysterious Casshan shows up to wreak havoc on Android BK-1's machine forces.

The show was every bit as good as I remembered it being, and I'm glad I purchased it.  If you're into post-apocalyptic stuff, or if you liked the concept of the world Terminator came from, you'll enjoy this.  Well... if you're into anime.  But if you're not into anime, then why are you reading this?  ;P",1368403200,8,824,4.753521126760563

1845027,3,B00008G8QI,"The story was interesting, but i would watch it online first before buying it. The animation isn't the greatest considering how far along we've come. If your in to 1980 classics this is for you.",1358121600,,194,4.571428571428571
1845028,5,B00008G8QI,"One of the most overrated animes of today that's just as overrated as Bleach, Naruto and Evangelion is Casshern Sins. Madhouse screwed up one of Tatsuo Yoshida's characters big time by changing the whole story and character backgrounds around, making Casshern (as he's called in that abomination when it's ""Casshan"" that's the official spelling) into some anti-hero who worked for Black King (his nemesis in the previous two adaptations of Casshan), and having supposedly killed Luna, who was his love interest in the previous versions, and in the previous two Casshan started as a human that was turned into a cyborg (ala Robocop). In Casshern Sins he's been a cyborg the whole time. What a crock! But not to worry, the kind folks at Discotek Media have reissued one of the previous adaptations of Casshan that was dubbed into english in 1995 by the late, great Carl Macek and his Streamline Pictures camp, and it's alot more faithful to the original 1970's Casshan TV show that Yoshida-san created than that overrated emo fest Casshern Sins. The story has a post-apocalyptic setting where the evil Black King (played by Jeff Winkless) has taken complete control of the planet with his army of androids and has enslaved the remainder of the human race. There only hope is Casshan (played by Steve Bulen), the creation of the late scientist Kotaro Azuma who is actually Kotaro's son Tetsuya who volunteered to sacrifice his life to become Casshan. Joining Casshan in his quest are his love interest Luna Kazuki (played by Edie Mirman), and his dog Friender (on an off-topic note:It's believed that the original 1970s Casshan was the inspiration for the video game franchise Mega Man, eg he's a robot with a robot dog). Black King's top dog or whatever is a Neoroid Commander (played by Catherine Battistone) who doesn't have any known name and throughout Casshan's quest to defeat his nemesis, she is always attacking him, Luna and Friender with her forces. The character designs by Yasuomi Umetsu who had previously worked on a 1994 remake of another well-known Tatsunoko franchise:Gatchaman, are very beautiful. Steve Bulen's performance as Casshan is fantastic and he fills the role very well. Jeff Winkless is outstanding as the villian Black King. The voice Winkless used for him was so evil and fitting, it was like it was tailor made for the character. The animation is beautiful especially for 1993/1995, and the film score is dynamic and reminiscent of the likes of oscar-winning composers like Danny Elfman, James Horner, Michael Kamen (R.I.P.) and Alan Silvestri. Carl Macek did an excellent job directing the dub like he always has with everything he was involved with, and at the price of only $14.99 on Amazon, Casshan:Robot Hunter is not only affordable and worth the money, but absolutely worth the time (and a hell of a lot cheaper than Casshern Sins!). And I want to thank Discotek personally for reissuing it so nobody has to suffer with the overrated Casshern Sins. Now if only somebody can try and get the original Casshan from the 1970s dubbed into english, that would be awesome! But for now, this will do great!",1355875200,4,3135,4.9393939393939394
1845029,3,B00008G8QI,"Okay, my best friend and I are fans of Casshern Sins, so we thought that something of the older series might be good to see. It sure as heck wasn't what we expected. Judging by the lines of Casshan/Casshern's suit (as well as various other tweaks of line-art), whoever the heck was drawing him had a serious hard-on for him. I'm not even kidding. There is _way_ too much attention being drawn to his crotch and his butt with that suit. Nevermind the gratuitous amounts of unnecessary art depicting the fact that yes, he _does indeed_ have 'tackle' shall we say...

Add on top of that, Luna looks like a scantily clad skank (and that's putting lightly)- let's just say that I don't want to think of what her laundry would be like- and furthermore, the plot is just kind of 'enh'. Yes, I'm aware, that's not a real word, but that's the best term for it. The story is mediocre with eye-bleedingly obvious references that Casshern and Luna had something going on before he got turned into a robot (or android, or cyborg, or whatever you want to call it).

As if that weren't enough, the entire plot basically boils down to: Casshern's father made the bad guy, the bad guy went crazy and took over the world, Casshern fights to save the world but has a brief moral dilemma over whether or not what the bad guy is doing would be what his father wanted, Luna makes goo-goo eyes at him while insisting he's still human as he insists he's not because he's amnesiac (yeah, that tired story concept), and then he goes to take down the big bad and wins- _and then spontaneously DIES for no reason_. Yeah. They tried to explain that off with some dumb excuse of 'his battery ran down' or something of the like, but in the movie it pretty much states that he's _sun powered_. And his 'battery ran out'. Riiiiiiiiiiight.

Oh yeah, and before I forget, turns out that he isn't the only one that got 'turned into a robot'; so did his dad and mom. Now here's the real kicker- his dad (or his dad's spirit/soul/whatever) is apparently sealed within the big bad/is essentially a catatonic robot (that briefly talks)- and yes, both of those at the same time, and his mom _is a freaking robot swan_. A robotic swan. A robotic swan that _randomly_ pops up around Casshern, shows him a hologram of herself, and talks to him- all while apparently getting information on his physical structure to give to the bad guy. Talk about your mothering issues, Casshern's mom is trying to 'comfort' him (when he pretty much barely remembers her anyway), while giving info on him to his _enemy_. What... the... hell?

That said, the art is amazing for the most part, and there are _some_ good parts. If for nothing else, this movie is good for a laugh, as well as rampant mockery. Worth the twenty or so bucks I got it for (including shipping and handling), but any more than that and you're getting ripped off.",1305244800,,2875,4.512476007677543
1845030,4,B00008G8QI,"I was not familiar with this character when I found and bought the DVD. It was apparent that either the story or the scenes had been culled from a longer series, as have the scenes from the ""Galaxy 999"" films. This film does a much better job of keeping loose ends or unexplained tie-ins from happening. The story, as present, is complete unto itself.

This is fun to have. Load it, grab the popcorn and enjoy! ; )",1173657600,,414,4.3076923076923075
1845031,4,B00008G8QI,"Like Gatchaman and the upcoming Karas (which is an anime meant to reignite the anime superhero), Casshan is a superhero anime, which is a rare thing in the anime and manga world. It follows a man with supernatural abilities, and in this case it happens to be a half-man/half-robot who has acrobatic abilities and the capability of plowing through metal with little effort. And, as an added note, Casshan was created by the very same studio that created Gatchaman and Karas, so at least this was done by the ones who know how to do it best.

The story follows Casshan as he journeys across a post-apocalyptic Earth populated by robots called Neoroids. These robots are slowly destroying the human race and, except for a few pockets of resistance, they are succeeding. But the human race have found a light in the darkness in Casshan, and he battles for the human race against the Neoroids tyrant leader, BK1, also known as the Black King. He's not alone in his efforts, for following him is a childhood friend who happens to have the blueprints for a weapon that could change the war, as well as Casshan's cybernetic dog.

Casshan is no masterpiece, but it has a special place for me since it was one of the first anime I was able to see, back when the Sci-Fi Channel had an anime block. It has some solid action, great animation considering the time, and a decent dubbed track, even if it is a bit melodramatic at times. In a lot of ways, Casshan is reminiscent to Vampire Hunter D, so if you enjoyed that classical work of anime, then you'll probably enjoy Casshan as well.

(NOTE: This is not volume 2. Casshan is only a four episode OVA, which is contained in its entirety on this DVD. Amazon.com has made a mistake in titling this DVD version.)",1143676800,2,1748,4.542857142857143
1845032,5,B00008G8QI,"Its got to be one of the best anime's I've ever seen. I saw Cashaun: Robot Hunter on Sci-Fi channel's ""Saturday Anime"" block. Basically its a movie about a scientist who made a robot who's prime directive was to clean up earth is to get rid of all humans, thus getting rid of pollution and war. The scientist also made two other cyborgs. One being Cashaun and the other being a dog. Together Cashaun and his dog (whom makes Rush look mega-weak) must stop the eco-crazed robot and his henchbots from driving the human race into extinction.",1125014400,3,538,4.556701030927835
1845033,4,B00008G8QI,"I grew up in Japan and I was a huge fan of its orginal TV series in 70s.  I am plesantly surprised how anime has been changed from the ones I used to watch when I was a kid.  Story is very sophicitecated in this short series.  Music is good as well.  I like the designs of machines better than its originals, but not of the people...(Casshan looks too young, Casshan's mother almost looks like his girlfriend, and Luna is showing too much of her body.)

7983264,3,B00008G8QI,"Based on a 70s anime TV series by Tatsunoko Productions(the creators of Gatchaman), Casshan(or as it's known in Japan, ""Casshern"")has gone on to inspire a live-action movie, and a TV remake titled Casshern Sins which was featured briefly on Toonami. But this particular 4-episode OVA was a gritty retelling of the original TV series which on its own was also the main influence for none other than Mega Man as both are about robot-fighting android superheroes with jet-powered robot dogs.

 Set in a world that seems like Terminator: Salvation totally ripped them up, a mad mega-android named the Black King(or BK-1)has lead an army of robots to take eventually conquer most of the world with pockets of humanity fighting for survival. Casshan is first viewed by the resistance as a legend or a martyr for their hope, and he finally steps forward with a frontal assault on Black King's fortress along with the busty blonde Sailor Moon lookalike, Luna. He succeeds in freeing some human prisoners, although it's never really said why the robots bother keeping humans around other than for forced labor. One project has the robots forcing the humans to build a bridge to transport troops across a canyon by train, even though it would be just a easy for them to carry them by plane or helicopter. Casshan is in fact an android given the memories of a young man named Tetsuya whose father was the one that originally created Black King, even though it went all HAL 9000 and decided to eliminate all mankind. Casshan also has the the spirit of his mother inside a strange robo-goose, but he ultimately hopes to free his father's spirit which is being held somewhere inside the Black King himself, although whether it might be Tetsuya's father controlling him is a mystery to him.

The OVA was done by some of the same creators of other Tatsunoko remakes in the 90s like Gatchaman and Hurricane Polymor, but this one seemed to keep most of the spirit of the original than those other ones. The animation is obviously upgraded, but this OVA takes it into more of a sci-fi/action route than the traditional superhero one. It was originally dubbed by Carl Macek for Harmony Gold into a VHS single feature, and then was re-released on DVD for ADV films using the previous dub but into a 4-episode format.",1404259200,,2295,4.775818639798489
