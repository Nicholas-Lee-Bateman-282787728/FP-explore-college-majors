8216312,4,B000V2TV20,"This Norwegian film from 2006 is set in Norway in the Seventies and revolves around high school teacher Pedersen and his communist ambitions and experiences. He reflects on the period in a short part of the film where we see him in present day Norway.
It is certainly a worthwhile film to watch and a good way to spend a couple of hours. The film is entirely in Norwegian with English subtitles.
Enjoy.",1340236800,,402,4.52054794520548
