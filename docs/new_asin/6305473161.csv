7901194,1,6305473161,"The comedy is slapstick and juvenile. Nathan has multiple personality disorders, all of which makes him act like The Stooges, although it wasn't really funny. There is some sex parody scenes that didn't work well either. Nathan manages to leave the mental institution and make it to his twin brother's house where no one, including his wife can tell them apart. The humor is old and stale. Tracy Lords looks sweet in a maid's outfit, but we've seen her looking better. Not worth the price of a rental. Avoid, unless you are extremely immature.

No f-bombs, no nudity, no real sex.",1333584000,,580,4.742574257425742
7901195,5,6305473161,"i found this movie to be a rare find of simple enjoyable comedy.  It mixes the reality of old state psychiatric treatment with very funny scenerios. the main actor played a man with multiple personalities and he was an excellent display with every personality shift he had.  My grandson and i have watched this movie over and over and still love it!!! If you like silly humor, something light with no real violence or too much heavy sex themes this is the movie for you.",1325030400,,470,4.517647058823529
7901196,1,6305473161,"This movie started out with a large, expensive food fight.  As much as I hate seeing food wasted, I should have known the film would go downhill from there.  This is a comedy about identical twins and multiple personalities disorder.  Of course, the multiple personalities aren't everyday folk; they're over-the-type personas like lounge lizards and cowboys.  Each time he changes personalities, they give him a loud costume change and don't allow for the actions to speak for themselves.  People are thrown out of windows; clothes keep getting accidentally ripped off; all that lowest common denominator stuff.  I saw this 'cuz I heard Peter Lupus was in this, but nobody stood out as that Playgirl centerfold here.
I never saw that film where Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin play mismatched twins, but what made that film annoying plays itself out here.  I'll give this movie one bit of credit.  It was full of gross-out humor and made in the early 1990s, long before ""There's Something About Mary"" and all of the hit gross-out movies to follow.  It may be prescient, but it's otherwise worthless.  Only the most puerile viewer could enjoy all of the silliness on display here.",1262995200,,1176,4.9238578680203045
