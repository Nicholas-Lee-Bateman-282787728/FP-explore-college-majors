5969450,5,B00F878KFM,"I have been wondering when this was coming out.  This show was brilliant in person, So I KNOW the DVD will be.  ALL of RUSHs DVDs are spectacular - SNAKES and ARROWS being my favorite.  I saw this Clockwork Angels tour in Charlotte last year and RUSH kicked ass for three plus hours... I don't know how they keep doing it, just keep getting better and better. I also saw on RUSHs website that on this DVD that RUSH is going to talk about new music they are working on since being inducted into the RRHOF... I hope RUSH has new music in the works.  I for one am beyond thankful and grateful that RUSH wants to still play music and perform for us.  Like NEIL said, its not over when its over... .. RUSH forever!!",1379376000,30,710,4.1911764705882355

5969452,5,B00F878KFM,"This is going to be awesome! And what a great price for all that you get! I loved this Rush tour. I was ok without a lot of the songs that people expect. This was a fresh idea to dust off some of the hidden 80's gems that never get played for the most. And I loved the latest CD so it is also awesome that I can have most of it done live on this DVD. Man, RUSH just stays amazing!!!",1379289600,12,382,3.6707317073170733

5969528,5,B00F878KFM,"Ok, here's the deal everyone:

I watched this bluray on my 70"" LED with surround system in the 5.1 Master Audio mode and it sounded great!  I checked the other option, the 2.0, and it did sound weak. But most people have a 5.1 surround sound system now days so you should be ok. If you still have that 27"" tube TV from 1998 you probably won't like it, but then again, you're probably not one to be a RUSH/concert video fan either if that's your set up.

Recommended for RUSH fans and others who enjoy rock concerts!  Cheers",1446163200,2,523,4.252525252525253

5969531,5,B00F878KFM,I'm a HUGE RUSH FAN ever since 1978 A Farewell to Kings Tour.  This Blu-Ray contains their live show with something they have never done before... the members of RUSH toured with a string ensemble.  Fantastic.  The music from this tour was written by Niel Peart to tell a story and was written into a book.  Never heard RUSH before or seen them - they put on a quite a show.,1442880000,2,374,4.225352112676056

5969534,5,B00F878KFM,"The recent Rush video concerts- R30, Rio, Cleveland (Time Machine), Clockwork Angels, are all excellent. Very good video and sound quality. They all have very different set lists. So I recommend choosing the concert video based on the set list you prefer. Like if you like Power Windows and Clockwork Angels check this (Clockwork Angels) out, a fair amount on it, if you like Vapor Trails maybe check out Rio, Moving Pictures then Time Machine. Etc.

For fans of the Power Windows album tho this is cool with Big Money, Grand Designs, and Territories. Marathon on the Cleveland dvd is also very good. The Rio dvd is a powerful concert with a quality documentary of the SA experience of the band.",1438819200,3,695,4.743801652892562

5969571,5,B00F878KFM,"My favorite Rush concert, captured for posterity with skill and care. The addition of strings makes the concert special, and I think ""Clockwork Angels,"" performed in its entirety, is among Rush's top-tier albums. Besides ""Angels,"" the concert contains all of the most vital canonical works, and the requisite Peart drum solos. This is a concert video to own and visit often.",1434412800,6,374,5.147540983606557

Geddy Looked uncomfortable playing with he strings.  Not nearly as good as Snakes and Arrows Live or Live in Cleveland 2011.  Those were awesome.  This band has so much power, they are the last band that needs strings.  Don't know why they (Ray Daniels?) (SRO Management) was thinking when they made this.  It was painful to watch.",1432598400,,491,4.6395348837209305

5969576,5,B00F878KFM,"Another great video from Rush.  This time they chose a more balanced soundscape.  There are sounds within sounds created by synth and those strings in the back.  All very clear and loud.  The group is tight, but they have been so in Time Machine 2011 and Snakes and Arrows tours.  I like the new songs a lot since this is my first hearing them.

Update: Okay, I will agree with some of the other reviewers that the cutaways and quick takes (video wise) are annoying and make it hard to concentrate on the viewing experience. I'm viewing this on my non-5.1 system over the built in speakers so I cannot comment on the sound quality. However, it doesn't change my overall opinion of the disc and the band. Of note, the video is produced by Allan Weinrib who is the brother of Geddy Lee (Weinrib).",1418774400,,683,4.294573643410852
5969612,4,B00F878KFM,"Id really like to give this Blu-ray 5 stars, but it only deserves 4.

The good: Well, its Rush, so its going to be good. The setlist is fantastic, the music is incredible, the new music from Clockwork Angels is among their best in 30 years (the string ensemble adds a unique touch), and these guys have more energy and far more talent than musicians half their age.

The not so good: Theres definitely something wrong with the sound. Of the four Rush Blu-ray concerts I own, I need to crank the volume 3 times louder to get the same level of sound. I only have 2.1 channels, but I echo reviews from others about the sound quality. Geddys voice is also not what it used to be, but hes 60. Give him a break.

The bad: This concerts editing looks like it was done with a blender. The director and producers wanted to capture the concert-like feel from the perspective of the concertgoers. But it flops. Carnies is a perfect example of the horrendous editing. Whenever the camera should be on Geddy, it's on Alex. When it should be on Alex, it's on Neil. Et cetera. And who wants to see the concertgoers more than the band? With so many cameras, how can the editors be late showing the pyrotechnics? Unbelievable. We don't watch Rush to see whos attending  we watch it to see the band.

I still recommend the disc as the setlist is among their best, Neil is ageless and has never played better, and because, well, its Rush. I'll support this band no matter what.",1418774400,2,1458,4.405204460966543

Time has given this group perfection instead of the usual getting tired or hammy taking the edge off their songs to play to the crowd.  The effects were great and fun.  The perfect balance....has a lot of energy, without looking overblown in that area.  What an amazing performance, and every aspect of their performance and the production of this movies is executed perfectly.  Probably the best rock and roll video concert delivery of all time.

Wouldn't you agree that the most memorable music by the best artists can and will stand the test of time.. Personally, I have never liked Rap or Hip Hop.. Why??? How many of those big selling individuals or groups of that genre have mastered an instrument ? Anyone ? As the late great Frank Zappa said,""The Tinseltown officinados come to SEE and not to HEAR!!!

Excellent DVD",1403308800,,181,4.625
5969662,4,B00F878KFM,"Rush released this new DVD to coincide with the release of the ""Clockwork Angels Tour"" live CD. The DVD concert content is identical apart from a few crowd moments and of course the special features. Onto the content of this extraordinary concert. First the good news, it is way better than the last DVD release where Geddy's voice did not cut the mustard. This time around the band have chosen songs Geddy can still sing so it is fairly much back to the retro 80s. At first I was worried about the choice of the band not to include classic 70s Rush such as Bytor, Working Man, and virtually anything from the 70s back catalogue. Without reservation the setlist they chose is a surprise and I must admit I grew to love this setlist for a number of reasons. The main reason is the versions of these songs are better than the studio versions, certainly heavier especially Alex Lifeson's lead breaks. The band clearly enjoy returning to the 80s and Geddy is far more comfortable in the voice range. These songs are less proggy than the 70s and far more straight forward in terms of musicianship, especially Neil Peart's drumming style, which is perhaps the reason he is given a plethora of opportunities to go solo and we are treated to very long drum solos on more than one occasion.

The set opens with Subdivisions and it powers along nicely, especially the wonderful synth stabs. I love how the crowd get into this gem from ""Signals"" mouthing every word. The band are decked out well, Geddy does not wear that Rash T shirt or the Blah Blah Blah design but instead has more serious black attire. Peart wears a ""Clockwork Angles"" design on his shirt and hat, and Alex is looking resplendent in his suit jacket over a star laden T. The band then launch into crowd pleasers from ""Power Windows"" The Big Money, Territories, and Grand Designs, the scathing critique on mainstream music. This track is one that has not been played live often and does not feature on the live ""A Show of Hands"" unlike the others. Also from ""Hold Your Fire"" is Force Ten, and from ""Grace Under Pressure"" is The Body Electric, and The Analog Kid from the wonderful ""Signals"" album. ""Roll The Bones"" track Bravado follows, then the band vacate the stage with its quaint popcorn machine working overtime, and Peart has a chance to shine on one of his trademark drum solos. Rather than use all his usual gimmickry and gadgets, he just rocks out with some incredible triplets and speed drumming on the snare and splashing cymbals. No doubt he is a master drummer and he is always seen to be so serious, unlike the other members of Rush who often goof about on stage with some hysterical choreography. Peart gets an ovation from the crowd after he plays with precision on Where's My Thing?/Here it is! And it is far different than the version on ""Roll the Bones"". This version is not the (Part IV, ""Gangster Of Boats"" Trilogy) version as you can understand as it is more or less a vehicle to give the band a breather and Peart drums up a storm, twirling his drumsticks, often throwing them in the air and always catching them. After this the band return for one more rocker before the half time break.

Easily the best song on Set One is Far Cry from ""Snakes And Arrows"" with fire balls and flames and some crazy lighting effects which are a taste of things to come in Set Two. The lighting is fairly subdued overall in Set One so that the band are able to take things up a step in the second set. Indeed, the lighting in Set Two is the best I have seen on a Rush DVD and really enhances the concert experience. The crowd really get into dancing and jiving and singing the lyrics, in particular note the group decked out in bright red whooping it up in the front row.

At some point in Set One a weird monkey arrives to take some popcorn and it is part of any Rush concert to have one of those moments. There have been clothes dryers where metal- heads come and get their T shirts, and frying chickens on a rotisserie in another concert. I like the popcorn idea, and the water tanks but the best thing about the set design is the Steam Punk dcor of the stage. There are three huge video screens, one for each member and tons of fire and steam in the second set. The lights are glorious with rays of light and beams scanning the crowd and they flash in sync to the rhythms in wonderful multi- coloured arcs.

Onto Set Two which is the best part of the whole DVD. This is the Clockwork Angels Set with 9 cuts from the recent album. Hearing the tracks live is a wonderful experience for me personally as I adore the studio album. Some tracks are missing such as the two BU2B tracks but overall the album is here and some of these live versions are heavier and more innovative than the studio tracks. I especially love how the Clockwork Angels String Ensemble add to the mystique and magic of The Anarchist and Carnies. Headlong Flight is a definitive highlight and it is great to see Alex thrashing out that riff and spiralling into some incredible lead breaks. Geddy has some bass solos in the set and his voice is superb throughout as all the songs are well in his range, I mean he is pushing 60 now so who can blame him for not tackling Bytor and the Snow Dog these days. There is a drum solo on Headlong Flight called Drumbastica and Alex solos on Peke's Repose seguing into Halo Effect. The lights are spellbinding on Seven Cities of Gold, then the album is concluded with Wish Them Well, and the brilliant virtuoso The Garden, that Lee claims is his favourite and I dare say is not alone in that sentiment. It was nice to revisit the album again as I had not played it for a while and the live treatment of it is as good as it gets.

I have to mention too the String Ensemble's verve and enthusiasm as they really get into these songs, dancing, swaying, jumping and generally giving it one hundred percent in presentation as well as actual musicianship. One decadent girl in particular stands out with her gothic eye makeup and waggling tongue. The Ensemble really add something extra to the concert experience and are not drowned out by Rush. I was surprised that they did not include BU2B2 with the strings going solo with Geddy as it was an opportunity, though the worst track on the CA album no doubt. David Campbell was the conductor and he is no stranger to blending rock with classical music. Campbell has been involved in such diverse projects as either muso or arranger with Muse, Black Sabbath, Meatloaf, Biffy Clyro, Metallica, Maroon 5, The Mars Volta, Kiss, Paul McCartney, Neil Diamond, Def Leppard, Aerosmith, Alice Cooper and Carole King. His resume is overcrowded with classic moments such as his work on ""Kiss Alive IV"", The Mars Volta's ""Frances the Mute"", Metallica's ""Death Magnetic"" and Muse's ""The 2nd Law"". He is also the arranger on the ""Clockwork Angels"" studio album so it is great he can return to the live stage.

After a deserved standing ovation the band return to snippets of their back catalogue with Dreamline, the single from ""Roll the Bones"", and the band thank the String Ensemble who depart along with Alex and Geddy, then there is an oddity called The Percussor, which is actually a Peart drum solo in various sections, the best being Steambanger's Ball. Here Peart goes for the gadgetry on cymbals that sound like guitar chords and weird sounds on the blocks. He does not go for the cool jazz thing this time though and it sounds like a ""Clockwork Angels"" outtake. Surely he must be the most inventive drummer in terms of actual drumming style and gimmicks. He has a lot of fun with the crowd then the band return to belt out Red Sector A from ""Grace Under Pressure"". YYZ follows and is always welcome from ""Moving Pictures"" masterpiece, perhaps one that cannot be missed as a concert favourite. The version on ""Rush in Rio"" is the best but, as usual, the band are at their blistering best with those insane fractured rhythms and screaming lead breaks. The crowd absolutely freak out as the first riffs chime in of Spirit of Radio from ""Permanent Waves"". Everyone screams as usual when Geddy sings ""Concert halls"" and the lights splash across the crowd. The reggae section of the song is pronounced and especially the bassline of the song. This is certainly one of the highlights of the concert.

There is an encore and we see the band sprint away to some dark corner as the crowd roar for more and of course the band return to spread some icing on the cake. The encore consists of a grand version of classic rush with Tom Sawyer, always nice to hear another ""Moving Pictures"" track, though I would have preferred Limelight. The band turn back the clock as a starry scene appears on the screen and we are treated to the brilliant crunching irregular chords of 2112, a quintessential Rush jewel. It is the only 70s cut so we have to soak this up and bathe in its glorious splendour, with some cool animation at the intro with a humorous edge. It is not the full version of 2112 naturally, as that would be overdoing it I guess, but this is lengthy including, not just the intro and Temples of Syrinx, but some of the instrumental break from other parts of the song. It ends the first DVD in a veritable blaze of glory. After this Peart pelts off stage with some fan giving chase and the security lady turns to the camera in amazement.

DVD 2 continues the music with a soundcheck recording of Limelight (Yes! There it is, my favourite Rush song so I can't complain). It is virtually a karaoke version with Lee missing most lyrics out in the rehearsal. Then there is Middletown Dreams, a forgotten track from ""Power Windows"". Next it's The Pass, the greatest track from ""Presto"", with the band bathed in a pleasant blue light tinge. There are many crowd POV shots making us feel as though we were among them. This is followed by Manhattan Project also from ""Power Windows"", and the String Ensemble resurface to help out again with admirable skill. This song features some quirky animation, and it is a better version than the studio with some great violin and guitar work. Peart gives those snares a real workout too.

The Special features of Rush DVDs are always fun and here is no exception. We get to watch the films that the audience were treated to and they range from mildly amusing to delightfully clever, with the members of Rush having way too much fun as weirdo gnomes or oompa loompas with squeaky voices in a Steampunk setting. I would rather have seen a more serious animation of the album content though the babe action is worth a look, and this anime is not as stupid as some of the animations on ""Snakes and Arrows"". Other features are the obligatory documentary on the tour ""Can't Stop Thinking Big"", always a treasure to be a fly on the wall. The Behind the Scenes featuring Jay Baruchel offers some insight as to what went on in the tour, and the outtakes are funny enough, using green screens and really silly behaviour by all involved. There's an interview with Dwush, which is Rush dressed as those gnomes and it really is very silly; ""are we getting paid for this?"" Then there are some oddball moments such as Family Goy, that is animation with Rush look alikes and Family Guy style characters. Stewie wants to be Peart who feels misunderstood and wears a 2112 T. Snoopy, Ringo and Road Runner make bizarre cameos and there's a lot of toilet humour. Family Sawyer is also rather odd, more gnome action as the band play a wacky hillbilly instrumental version of Tom Sawyer. Overall the features are well worth checking out at least once. The Easter Egg is Alex's gross joke.

The DVD booklet has some attractive photos, with tour personnel listed, a pic of the flames rising near the String Ensemble, one pic of each Rush band member and some live pics. With 16 pages, more photos could have been included instead of all the tour crew lists, however it is nice to get any book these days as often none are provided. The DVD liner itself is a pic of the stage with Rush under a spectrum of light beams. The DVDs are designed with the beige and red colours that coincide with the ""Clockwork Angels"" CD colour scheme.

This is a great 2 DVD package, with clear clarity audio production, decent editing, gorgeous sumptuous coloured lighting and well executed features and menus. It is not as silly as the ""Snakes and Arrows"" menus but the band still have their moments of hilarity, though they are probably enjoying the films they make more than the audience. All in all it is a great DVD experience, clocking over 3 hours, and well worth shelling out for especially if you are weighing up between this and the CD version. It is better to view the band on stage playing these great tracks so this is the better option. The music is the same as on the CD so one is not missing out by purchasing the DVD. I recommend it as yet another awesome Rush DVD!",1402012800,,12878,4.5203775203775205

Sound is excellent, captures the entire live show with the videos, the only and biggest complaint I have is that the editing is MTV style- you don't ever get more than 2 seconds of any shot.

5969666,5,B00F878KFM,"I agree the constant camera angles can be headache inducing at times, but the audio of this DVD (not blue-ray) is superior not only to the audio of the Time Machine Tour DVD (not blue-ray), but also to the sound of the Clockwork Angels CD itself.  I was disappointed on how NOISY and BOXY the CD sounded in my car stereo--probably the culprit of recording in PRO TOOLS without an warm acoustic-sounding processor.

The DVD concert audio itself is eye-popping.  Video, pyrotechnics, a string ensemble, epic lighting, even a calculated color scheme of the set and the musicians' clothes simply jump out at you!  The overall effect is wonderfully satisfying, if not a bit exhausting.  I missed their stop in Atlanta because I was working that evening and frankly I was a little short of cash.  This video is clearly the next best thing to seeing them live.  To hear CA in its entirety and sequence is especially thrilling: it amazes me how the band, the technicians (you can sometimes see them working their magic offstage), and the string ensemble could remember their cues (both audio, technical, musical and visual), play that music, and still look spontaneous while this huge production lumbers along like clockwork.

My two cents..  :)",1400371200,2,1237,4.880382775119617

5969668,5,B00F878KFM,"I also currently own the Rush Blu-ray Time Machine Live From Cleveland. This is very much like a part ll to time machine and they perform a completely different set of songs on Clockwork Angels Live. The sound in dts hd 5.1 is stunning as usual. Rush lends itself to Blu-ray medium better than most because of their incredible dynamics and sound quality. Their performance is a 10 on the 10 scale as is their par of late. Some of Rush's earlier concerts are performed and recorded poorly. These are not. If you like Rush pre 1985, I would recommend Time Machine over this one. If you like Rush's material from 1986 through present, I recommend this performance because post 86 is the material they selected for this concert (for a good example of what I'm talking about, on Time Machine, they perform MOVING PICTURES straight though in the exact album order). I for one really like the entire Clockwork Angels cd performed straight through on this selection. As cds go, Rush did very few anywhere near the quality of Clockwork Angels. It is very similar to Snakes And Arrows which came in a 5.1 format as well as enhanced stereo. Geddy Lee's voice has aged like fine wine. He shouts far less, has amazing breath control and hits every high note accurately. Some of the recordings on these two discs are BETTER than the studio originals. For one thing, DTS-HD has absolutely amazing bass lows and fidelity and this more accurately portrays Geddy's bass clearer than I've ever heard it anywhere. You listen to an older song and you think....""hmmm, so this is what the bass really sounds like on this song...wow"". This happens frequently on both discs to Geddy's bass, Alex's Guitar and especially on Neil's drums. Clear outstanding fidelity and superb dynamics. Warning....this will push your amps and sub woofers as you will want to keep turning it up louder. As Rush is now in the hall of fame and their always a class act, I feel there is probably good reason these last two live Blu-rays are so good and their last studio cd is second to none. It kind of fits into the hall of fame timeline. My son says listening to the Clockwork Angels tracks gave him a religious (almost mind bending) experience. Before their last three releases, he was somewhat familiar with their material, but he was not a fan. I thoroughly recommend this release on Blu-ray.",1400284800,2,2351,4.681159420289855

Well, it was pretty annoying.  I'm pretty sure whoever produced this had ADHD.  The scene didn't stay the same for longer than 2 seconds throughout the concert.
Audio-wise I felt it was just ok.  Alex's guitar was really loud and sounded good.  There wasn't much punch on the drums and not enough detail in the bass.  Vocals could have been a little louder but were ok.  It was Rush, so the show and songs and everything else was great.",1400284800,2,572,4.5588235294117645

Three short drum solos instead of one long drum solo. I like the idea. I saw Rush live on this tour. I've been listening to Rush and to classical music for over 35 years. I'm an avid classical music listener. Rush is one of my top favorite rock bands. I did NOT like the inclusion of a string section (violins, cellos, etc), classical music instruments, with Rush music. Many musicians believe that eclectic and creative mixes of musical instruments, genres and styles will produce great music. True. It does work many times. It did not work this time, in my very personal opinion and for my taste. The strings sound out of place and forced onto the Rush music and Geddy's singing. It sounds as if I were listening to Rush on one rock radio station and a classical music station was interfering with Rush. Thirteen of the songs on this disc are performed with the Clockwork Angels String Ensemble. Otherwise, I'd give 5 stars.",1399766400,,1062,4.7771739130434785

Also the DVD is marked DTS-HD which I found suspicious when I was in the store and debated on whether or not to buy it.  I've only seen DTS-HD on blu-ray.  Screwed again, when I play it there is no DTS-HD audio.  False advertising.  Forget the 2 channel option, stereo audio on this sounds worse than a fading radio station.  On the bright side it does have dolby digital 5.1 which sounds decent but still below average compared to other DVD concerts I have.  I'm glad I didn't pay extra for the blu-ray version because from the sound of other reviews it isn't much better.  Before you argue with me on this - yes my blu-ray player is compatible, it has all the audio codecs and can play DVD-A.

5969693,2,B00F878KFM,"Rush's CLOCKWORK ANGELS TOUR captures performances from shows in Phoenix, Dallas, and San Antonio in November 2012, spliced together so that one doesn't even notice they are taken from different dates.

All in all, I would not recommend purchasing this if you weren't there. For people who got to see this tour, this may serve as an enjoyable souvenir of the experience. However, when listening to a concert video at home, as opposed to being there and caught up in the thrill of being part of a crowd seeing a beloved band, then the weaknesses in the performances stand out, all the more so when the band in question is now sextagenarian. Geddy Lee's voice has aged far too much to hold up in live performance: he's hoarse and shouts his way through most of the songs. As much as I loved the last few Rush albums, it is obvious that multiple takes in a studio are necessary for them to produce acceptable work.

I was mainly attracted to this concert film because the Clockwork Angels Tour brought back some material from Rush's synth era, and I was curious to see how they would rework these highly polemical songs. Electronic elements in 1980s songs are mixed lower than on the album versions, so things are the way Alex Lifeson wishes they had been. The mixing is controversial, however, as a glance at other reviews will demonstrate.

The video quality of the Bluray is, for the most part, fantastic. However, to capture the Zeitgeist of concertgoers these days incessantly recording on their mobile phones, the video occasionally cuts to a camera placed in the crowd where the band can barely be made out among the sea of bodies and waving hands.

As for the SOUND:  ?!??
I love Rush, 1 of my favorite bands, but I suspect something or someone WENT ""sideways"" either mixing the sound and/or the transfer from master . . .
MY 5.1 DTS Pioneer Receiver is 8 years old, but it has been 100% consistent & brilliant with both movie & concert for as long as I've had it.
I ""played"" (labored-over) Clockwork Angels last night & spent more than half of the 3 hours on the floor, adjusting my 5.1 settings, re-checking wires . . .
About 2 1/2 hours into the concert footage, I ALMOST achieved a semblance of balance in both the tone & surround:

OK!  AS you VIEW this concert, Alex (Guitar) is on LEFT, Geddy stays middle & right to groove with Neil. The overall TONE of the sound is VERY bass / rumbling. My 5.1 allows + 20/-20 increments for adjusting each speaker. Normally the sub-woofer is around +8, or +10 for both movies & music.
My impression is that someone mistakenly (or perhaps he's a Geddy Lee FAN-addict ?) not only reversed the left-right surround setting, but I'll venture that what YOU/WE here from the playback might be Geddy's own mix in his headphones ONSTAGE. Any of the guitar sound comes from the RIGHT speaker, even though we're viewing Alex on the left as if you're sitting on the floor. (So, as GEDDY is playing / singing facing the audience, Alex is to HIS RIGHT!). The bass guitar sounds FANTASTIC, as does Neil's bass drum. His snare is a distant tap, toms even more distant, his hi-hat is NON-existent. Cymbals vary upon what Geddy is playing or singing.
Poor Alex, can barely hear him above the rumbling din of bass-drum and/or bass-guitar. Keyboards cut thru & sounded great (again, it seems as if we're getting Geddy's personal onstage mix . . .??).

So, I tweaked the 5.1 settings & actually had to change batteries 2X in the Stereo remote!
Left/front  = +20
Center  = +17
Right/front  = +12
Sub-woofer  = - 17  (that's WAY down: MINUS 17!)
Rears L/R  =  +3/+5

So, I'd like to know if anyone else feels this mix/cut also sounds . . . NOT ""Muddy"", the clarity is still there.
But VERY ""BASS-friendly"", (I play bass, but I' want to hear all 3 guys, not just Geddy's mix!).
Just takes some EXTREME surround tweaks to get some kind of sound clarity from the show.
STILL . . . It's weird to SEE Alex jamming on the LEFT, but to ONLY HEAR him from the RIGHT speaker.
RUSH, as usual, put on a great show, performance was flawless, but I'd like to see/hear back from the producers / distributors to see if I'm the only one with this VERY odd tonal mix.

I'd HESITATE to buy this, until we find out if it's JUST my disc, or is the entire release flawed???
I'm going with 2 stars ONLY because the sound was so screwy!  If that get's straightened out, an EASY 5 star!

*****

UPON READING OTHER REVIEWS: I'VE RETURNED MY COPY TO AMAZON FOR REFUND.
TOOK 3 BUSINESS DAYS FROM PROCESSING ON-LINE / FREE RETURN SHIPPING & POSTING $$ TO MY ACCOUNT. Shipping was ALSO refunded!  Way to go, Amazon!  :)
I'll add that I DO REMEMBER the ""porn-style"" constant camera angle changes, but as posted, I was so preoccupied with tweaking the 5.1 and checking speakers that I had no ""hang-time"" to become annoyed with the whiplash effect every 3 seconds . . .

ADVICE?? DEAR RUSH:  Since this is in dire need of a 5.1 / DTS re-mix, why NOT edit-DOWN all the thousands of camera-angle changes??
STAY with Alex for his solos, focus ON Neil when he's doing some magic on his kit & on Geddy when he is singing, playing bass AND ""FOOT-notes"" on the Taurus pedals, SIMULTANEOUSLY?!

5969706,4,B00F878KFM,"In the 3 decades I've been following this band, they have never disappointed. Rush have been like that old, faithful friend that has stuck with me and grown up with me over the years. I'm from the 2nd echelon of Rush fans...grew up hearing them in the 70s as a child (thanx to my older brothers), but didn't become a hardcore fan 'til 1984, at age 14, when I started to get a bit more serious about being a musician. I have to admit, though, that Clockwork Angels didn't initially thrill me like the others. Although Rush is the only band whose live albums I ever got jazzed about, I had felt that lately they had fallen in to the Rolling Stones rut: a new album every several years with a plethora of live albums along the way. BUT...when I read about this one coming out, I got very excited 'cos once again, I knew my heroes would be doing something excitingly different (for them). Ah yes, the string section! Although the idea in general was done do death in the 90s, who but Rush could revive it so masterfully? Watching and hearing this had given me a new appreciation for the Clockwork Angels album, and reminded me why Rush is still my favourite band.
The guys were in top form that night, the playing was great. The new material sounded fantastic, even better than the studio counterparts. And it was especially great to hear them bring back some of the mid-80s gems they haven't played since their release: Grand Designs, Middletown Dreams and The Body Electric to name a few. But a few disapppointments, though: this live version of The Body Electric (one of my all-time favourites) is lacking. All my favourite drum fills at the end are missing, and the groove during Alex's solo just doesn't do it (even though you can't really fault a band for changing something up after playing all these years together, it just didn't quite do it for me). And Where's My Thing sounds a bit weaker, so far as the drumming. That classic Neil Peart ride pattern during the chorus of the song is gone! And as much as I really do like the way they successfully integrated an orchestra into their music, it does not work for YYZ or Red Sector A. They sound cartoonish. And too many silly props on stage. Rush have built their reputation and loyal fan base on their musicianship. But again, all these years together, guess they just wanted to change it up a bit. Can't really fault them for it. Still, hey, it's Rush!!!
These are just minor disappointments so far as I'm concerned, and they certainly won't keep me from holding onto this DVD. Every fan has their favourites. MIne happen to be Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Signals to name a few. It all just sounds better with age. This may not be Hemispheres II (although I wouldn't argue with that), but the bottom line remains: these guys still got it. Regardless of all the s*** trends that come and go, especially in the 2000s where eveything is pre-fab, Rush have always delivered, and managed to keep their sound fresh and relevent. It's about time for R40, eh?",1392076800,,3011,4.54696132596685

As for the video, I'll admit I have mixed feelings about it but don't think it's horrible. It's shot very differently than your usual live video. Usually you get a straight forward show with shots of the crown, shots of the performers and shots of what's on the videos screens. All of these are important elements because you want to see what you missed if you weren't there. The difference with the way this video is shot is almost from a ""behind the scenes"" viewpoint. You get to see what the guys are doing backstage before they go on, the interaction with the crew, what it's like to be Neils hi-hat, what it's like to sit at the end of Geddy's keyboard and almost get smacked with the headstock of his bass, what it's like to have Alex in your face making jokes and just so much more.

Here's my review of the show itself:

 I've been a fan for years and this band, even in their 60's and almost 60's, impress me more every time I see them. It's counter intuitive given the level of difficulty in their music but it's the truth.

The set was recorded in Dallas, TX in November, 2012. I was luck enough to be at the show and was blown away by it live. They play a lot of songs from the most recent album, Clockwork Angels, and they even some extra accompaniment which I will not spoil. Most of the hits are there, drum solo or two as well. The one thing that really got me pumped about this release is the recording and mix sound...which finally has been nailed. The band have suffered from a loudness issue with their albums for years and now that is not present. Everything sounds great and you wouldn't even notice it was live if not for the talking/cheering.

If you're a fan you'll have to get this just to keep the collection going but in truth I think this release trumps a few of their more recent live releases. While the content may not be as deep, the sound quality and surprises are fully worth it. For the casual fan, if you want a good collection of Rush tunes with some of the known songs and other more current ones, this is a good release for you.",1390867200,2,1460,4.310218978102189

However no matter of tinkering with my home theaters audio system can make this disc sound decent, lacking any real low or mid-bass, drums absent, high guitar mix. Yikes, who is Rush paying to do their production ? Video quality is excellent though but that still can't make up for the audio misses.

5969735,3,B00F878KFM,"Rush is my favorite band.
They have long been known for their commitment to excellence, whether it be tight playing, song structure, recording quality or a string of well recorded and produced CD and DVD releases.
Most of their last few DVDs have been really top-notch as far as audio and video quality in my opinion. Even their last DVD, ""Time Machine Live From Cleveland"" looks and sounds good despite a rather lackluster performance.
Unfortunately, this release is an exception. I was so excited for this Blu-ray, having seen the first show on this tour. Imagine my disappointment when I put the disc in my player and heard the miserable audio mix. Muddy and dull sound overall. Tinny, compressed cymbals. No dynamic range whatsoever.
What happened here?
The performance itself is great. Yes, Geddy is getting older and you can hear that in some of his vocals. Songs like ""The Big Money"" find him a bit shrill at times, but so much of this music was recorded so long ago it is hard to fault Geddy if he isn't spot-on during every song. Playing is first rate throughout, picture a bit grainy at times for some reason.
Too bad the potential for excellence is lost here. This Blu-ray frankly, looks like a standard resolution DVD, The sound is poor, even for standard def. A waste of technology.

Having said that, I did enjoy the performance despite it's shortcomings. It's just a shame that the release wasn't produced better. Some of the concert Blu-ray discs I own look and sound incredible, with crystal clear picture and audio. I am happy to have this document in my collection, just sad that it is not all it could have been.
Therefore, 3 stars and no more.

Three musicians who've created memorable music for over 30 years isn't something to sneeze at, but these three people with their own string quartet for the first time ever is a most see.

The quartet was used for the bands music selections from their album ""Clockwork Angels"" and it was quite surprising to see just how this quartet of talented musicians were so much a part of the band's performances, as well as their interactions with he band themselves...and if you thought that YYZ performed in Rio was spectacular, wait till you see and hear that song accompanied with a string quartet that ""Rocks!!"" that song in a manner I'm unaccustomed to.

The Clockwork Angels Tour (I went to the Boston show) album is poorly mixed.  There is no depth to the songs.  You can barely hear Alex and on some songs it sounds like Alex is playing from the bottom of a barrel.  Its tough to pick up Neil on some songs and Geddy sounds raspy!!!

The string arrangement was not blended well into the songs.  I WISH SOMEDAY RUSH WOULD PLAY WITH A FULL ORCHESTRA!!!  LIVE!!!

I think the orchestral strings bring a wonderful new perspective to RUSH and that is consistent with this bands ever constant changing themes.

5969755,4,B00F878KFM,"I was given this as a gift recently. I'm a fairly new Rush fan, and I'm starting to believe this trio can do no wrong. A 3-hour concert with incredible energy at their ages? Wow. It's really a shame the audio mix wasn't as good as it could be. Here's how I rate this release (overall average of 3.8):
5 stars to the overall musicality and virtuosity of the musicians.
5-stars for the incredible lighting design.
4 stars for special features.
3 stars goes to camera work (did they give video cameras to fans on the wings of the stage? Nausea warning!).
2 stars for audio mix. Why? Read on

I read a lot of the reviews here and elsewhere, and there is either a love or hate mentality about the audio in this concert disc. I have a fairly well balanced home theatre 5.1 surround sound system with Polk speakers. I listened to the DTS Master HD surround track (the 2-track option was just too mediocre). The surround speakers were used well in terms of ambience. The synths probably sounded best of all instrumentation in the concert. The bass wasn't massively dominating, but it was much more than was necessary. What bothered me most was that the lead vocals were buried in the mix, as were the crispness of the drums. I could barely hear the licks from Neal Peartand that was really a big loss. The 2nd half of the concert featured a string section, and they were often buried in the mix too. Guitars, synths, and bass dominated.

Knowing how perfectionists Rush's trio are with their concert sound, I'm surprised they signed off on this. Sure, they're no Steely Dan in terms of crazy-perfection engineering, but I know Rush has a high level of expectations they require of their touring crew. It seems wasted with the mediocre audio mix found in this blu-ray.

The only other gripe were a couple of camera operators who should be fired. They were on the wings (seemed to be mingling with the audienceor WERE audience members) with really shoddy MTV-inspired unnecessary, unfocused zooms. Awful. Luckily, it seems most of the 2nd half of the concert didn't use much from them.

Still, I can't fault the musicians. They were sublime, as were the lighting designers. Some of the intermingled video segments I could do without (silly clips featuring the Rush trio in heavy make-up or using green screens). I know it was used as filler while the guys took a break, but yikes.",1389139200,3,2370,4.622327790973872

5969773,5,B00F878KFM,"I have been a Rush fan since 1976, when my buddy first played ""2112"" on his stereo, so I admit to a little bias here. That said, this is an amazing show. Musically, they sound in top form. High points for me were ""YYZ"", """"Caravan"", ""Red Sector A"", ""Manhattan Project"" (a bonus track) and ""2112"" . Sure, Geddy can't hit the high notes like he used to (for quite some time now), but his voice is still strong; I think he's become a better singer as he ages. The addition of a string ensemble for most of the second half of the show for the ""Clockwork Angels"" material worked really well, too.

The Blu-ray HD and 5.1 audio make for an almost ""you are there"" experience.

5969783,5,B00F878KFM,"I attended the Boston show of the Clockwork Angels tour, and it was a great concert event. I was very glad to see the guys again after many years of missing concerts. I have, however, kept up by watching their many concert DVDs, so I have a good amount of background regarding the filming and sound quality of their live shows on DVD. So I was surprised to read many negative reviews of the editing style and sound mix. I got the DVD anyhow, and have watched it twice now, and can say unequivocally that I think the sound mix is very good to excellent and the editing gives the performance a great span and ""live"" feel.

The mix is heavy, but clear. That is, the bass elements are slightly enhanced as they were in the concert itself. Geddy's bass lines rip, and Neil's heavy foot pounds. But these take nothing away from Alex's soaring solos or rhythm stings, or from the lovely pulses of strings coming during the main section with the ensemble. Vocals are clear, keyboards are clear, and the whole thing sounds great, I think. I have a 5.1 system, and it sounds great at all volume settings I've tried (quiet and really loud).

The filming is impressive, as it uses standard techniques (guys with shoulder cams and a few set cameras) along with a camera on a wire, cameras wandering the floor, cameras in the stands, and GoPros mounted on various stage equipment. This gives some surprisingly good shots of the players, the crowd, the staging, and the event overall. The montage during the light splashes of ""YYZ"" epitomize the approach -- you see them from the floor, the nose-bleeds, the left, the right, the stage, and above, all in a quick series of cuts that use filming to full effect. That is, the reason to have a lot of cameras is to convey more and different views to capture an event more completely than any single spectator could. The images are clear, the cuts are appropriate, and the overall concert footage is exciting and spot-on.

So, in my books, this is better than some Rush DVDs, definitely up there for excitement with ""Rush in Rio,"" and the footage of the songs from ""Clockwork Angels"" is spectacular. The title song is beautifully captured, and ""Headlong Flight"" and ""The Anarchist"" will leave you begging for more.

Get it. It's awesome!",1388275200,2,2267,4.617866004962779
5969784,2,B00F878KFM,"Neil Peart says something on the documentary of this release that will ring true with every single Rush fan: you don't have to understand all of what they do, that's not the point. Good luck with that, btw, fellow mere mortal. The point, to paraphrase the Professor, is to know that great care was taken in the making of each song.

That very specific doesn't translate onto this Blu-Ray because of its audio engineering. In time, history will regard this record as being below the standards set by that of the initial Vapor Trails release.

I've been a huge Rush fan for 35+ years. Over that time, recording and other audio related technology and methods have progressed to the point that home viewers should be able to appreciate at least half-way decent sound from any concert recording. From boy bands to the latest one-hit (non)wonder, audiences have come to expect audio that allows the average listener enjoy the music.

With that said, I was thrilled to get this Blu-Ray because it represents Rush at their musical peak so far. On this Blu-ray, the musical performance is easily the best Rush ever captured on video. It is simply brilliant.  David Campbell's string arrangements are perfect. As Geddy said on the documentary, Campbell deeply understands Rush. While I never thought Alex, Geddy, and Neil needed anyone else on stage, this is perfect as far as that goes.

The video capture is very good, too. I can see individual hairs on Alex and the Japanese oak grain on Neil's Promark's. BTW, we don't need 1080p to see that Geddy is in better shape than most of us will ever be in our lives.

To describe the audio experience, it doesn't feel right to speak anything but well of it. How can I in any way appear to put down the work of Rush? They are the nicest, most caring people and it doesn't feel natural.

Still, we're not talking about their performance. A Blu-ray is, fortunately or not, not comprised simply of one performance as a moment in time, but the methods by which that performance is captured and reiterated.

As an example of the audio deficiency here, I conducted an experiment. I put in this Clockwork Angels Blu-ray for my wife, who is the opposite of an audiophile. ""Good enough"" represents a huge range for her. No disrespect, right. She's just fine with our TV's mid-range biased sound. She doesn't see the point of a separate audio experience as a modern setup offers. So she's the perfect test subject... although I did give her my opinion beforehand. (WTF.) Given a few minutes listen of the Clockwork Angels Blu-Ray audio, I then put on Porcupine Tree's ""Anesthetize"" Blu-ray. ""Huge difference,"" she said within 20 seconds. That was all she said, and all she needed to say.

On Anesthetize, we can clearly hear each instrument and its full range of frequency output. The mix of instruments + vocals + audience, and whether my system is burning on 5.1 or two-channel Dolby, it's as if we are there in the audience. I hear something new every time I listen.

With the Rush Clockwork Angels Blu-ray, we miss out on the upper range of Geddy's voice. He sounds nasally, which does not represent his powerful vocals live or in other recordings. Frankly, the recording makes him sound almost annoying. That isn't Geddy's singing, but a poor imitation made possible by a feat of a truly crappy audio experience.

The drums are muddy with the snare, bass drum, and hi-hat core trio lost somewhere as if he's playing behind the stage. Alex's guitar sound is absent the high range and sounds compressed with heavy gating. While I'm using some hyperbole when I say this, I'm also not far cry to say as if someone recorded the show from a 1980's cassette deck at the back end of this big stadium rather than having direct access to the mixing board and each mic on and above the stage.

Truth be told, I'll always be a Rush fan. I'd give up three stars, but for one thing. Yes, the audio comments here don't reflect their performance whatsoever. They simply didn't get an audio engineer up to the task of conveying the world's best trio plus the rockin' Clockwork Angels String Ensemble) on disc. Rush has been core to my life and I'd gladly give a mere $20 or much more any number of times to support such high art. If they come out with a re-mastered edition, I will buy that. This is not money down the drain. For just that cause, I'd recommend you buy this Blu-ray too, if you're so inclined. But to show this current release to my friends and family? No way that's going to happen.

And that's what hurts.

The Clockwork Angels so want to spread their arms and sing, but on this Blu-Ray, anyway, they're forever entombed in molasses.",1388188800,6,4665,4.631961259079903

As you know, this tour is pack with the String ensemble for their new songs materials.
And even I'm not their fan during '80 as the first set concert, but it is not a big deal, instead it very challenge
when they play LIVE.

I enjoy for almost the whole concert, especially that three guys performed and they still in a great shape, power, energy, concentrate, entertain and the productions and the Brilliant script recording from the Director.
This I must give over 5 stars.

But Bad thing is the audio mixed is The Biggest way for this titled, especially 2.0 ch which my machine concerned.
The guitar solo some songs were very sharp & loud, while the Drum beat was just supported role, also the camera
and recording ways weren't use in HD that should suit as BD disc even the price is close to DVD, as you can check playing info that it 1080i not 1080P (1080P only appeared in Time machine Tour), it shame actually that overlooked.

5969794,1,B00F878KFM,"Finally got to watch this on Palladia. Absolutely painful to watch this production. Constant camera cuts (like every 1-3 seconds) are the worst. If Alex is playing an extended solo, just show him playing. Don't show 1.5 seconds of it up close, then cut away and zoom in real fast, and then show the crowd for 2 seconds and then Neil hit the crash for 1 second, then back to Alex for another 1.5 seconds. This is all made worse by the fast zooming, shaky hand held cameras, and poor video quality in general. At some points they literally change the camera on every crash/musical hit no matter how fast they are in the music. What a let down.",1387670400,56,641,4.394957983193278

Why would Pratt's performance be mixed so low? Was it on purpose? To what end? I am baffled. I won't be buying this Blu-ray. I will watch it on YouTube when people start uploading it.

I was so surprised I went around playing the blu-ray on multiple systems, and comparing it to other discs, before realizing that it was the product itself that was weak.  Geddy's vocals are buried behind the music, sometimess so low one cannot make out the words. The bass is muddy and the drums do not stand out they way they had. In set two, the string section added a lot, but they sometimes overwhelmed Alex's solos. The arrangements were nice, but the mixing was jaw-droppingly bad.

To make things worse, the video was grainy, choppy - the editor must love the 1.5-second cut - and used bizarre shots. Too many times did the camera zoom shakily onto a player, only to cut half a second later, or show the back of someone's head, or peer unflinchingly into the lights. I turned on the Snakes/Arrow tour from YouTube and got much better sound, and long shots that could showcase the musicians plying their trade. I can't see returning to see this again.

Those who may not know band well might think RUSH are trying to capitalize on their recent wider mass-appeal acceptance in releasing a boat-load of material of late.  Longer-time RUSH fans know historically the band has released a live DVD after each of their most recent tours.  The video quality and photography is excellent!  Clear, colorful, unique shots and angles capturing all of the band members at their best.  As long-time fans know, RUSH also has a great sense of humor.  That is still evident throughout this video though personally, I did not find the ""G-nome"" skit nearly as funny as skits from previous tours (can't win 'em all!).  I saw RUSH 3-times during this tour.  Each show was incredible.  Set-list did not vary much (couple of songs changed here and there) and (a little to my dismay) they focused quite a bit on the 80's material.  Though I was still a fan of the band during this period, I was (and still am) a greater fan of their 70's releases.  I was REALLY hoping for the 2012 ""100 year pre-2112 anniversary"" they would have done the ENTIRE 2112.  Very disappointed they did not.  All that said, my biggest gripe with this DVD/BD/CD set (I bought the ""Limited Numbered 1/5,000 copies 6-disc version"" from band website) is the audio quality.  Better than bootleg but not near what you'd expect from a band of this stature.

(my system: HDMI to Denon receiver, Mission 751 fronts, PSB rear and centre, two eight inch subs).  I set the bluray to 5.1 (the default is stereo which is odd), the DTS-HD MA light lit up, and I was good to go.

5969823,4,B00F878KFM,"Not sure what happened here but I am giving it 4 stars and here are the reasons why. Before I do that I just want to let you know that I attended this concert in Dallas and sat 3rd row on Geddy's side so I witnessed some things that may or may not be the reason this particular DVD/Blu-ray fails to meet SOME expectations although exceeds others.

1. The show itself happened on a Wednesday night in Dallas. If you don't live here then you need to understand how traffic works and how concerts go around here. I-35 is a parking lot every night and so is 20 and everything coming out of Mesquite and Fort Worth. The exit that is before the arena is a parking lot every single day except the weekend. When you are dealing with work all day and then sitting in hours of traffic rushing to get home and change for a concert and then get stuck in traffic again going to the arena? Your mood is not a concert one mid-week.

2. The atmosphere was absolutely dead. I have seen Rush 54 times in total. This was show 51 for me at the time. I have been seeing this band since 1984. Nobody addressed the crowd once that the show was being filmed until Geddy told the crowd before Grand Designs. A crowd prep would have been great and a hype man up there doing shot checks would have been even better. I have seen other concerts that have been filmed for DVD's and many bands have a guy who goes out and gets the crowd going and excited and alerted to be aware and excited that this show is being filmed and you will own it one day. The pre-show house music that is picked by Peart is absolutely dreadful. 60s and 70s dead obscure progressive rock sucks the life out of a room. There was nothing energy pumping about the house music he chose at all and hasn't been for the last 3 tours.

3. Why not play everything for one night? I know the band filmed Phoenix for extra shots for whatever went wrong in Dallas and for the other tracks that alternated in the set list, but why not just have had The Pass follow Bravado in Dallas, Manhattan Project follow Dreamline in Dallas, Middletown Dreams follow The Body Electric, and put Limelight after Tom Sawyer in the encore followed into 2112? You are talking a total game changer here. You would have had your entire rotating set list played in one show and it would have been a tremendous wrap. I am not saying they needed to play this set every night. Just this one night. Would 5 extra songs clocking in at 25 extra minutes really have killed them? Geddy admitted at the time of Rush In Rio (the last time they alternated set list's), that they should have just done Ceiling Unlimited, Vital Signs, and Between Sun and Moon but nobody brought it to their attention to do so. Ridiculous. What a really special show this would have been, instead the songs like Middletown Dreams, The Pass, and Manhattan Project are thrown in as bonus tracks. Unfair to those gems. Limelight soundcheck is interesting but I would rather have had the song in the set. Limelight should have been in the encore the entire tour anyway. I remember they had Working Man alternating with Spirit of Radio. Sheesh. Really?

After standing through almost an entire album that is brand new...you give another drum solo, an AOR hit from 1991 in Dreamline, a forgotten gem  for many in Manhattan Project, and Red Sector A which has had the same graphics and presentation since 2002. When YYZ kicks in and then goes into Spirit of Radio you head off the stage and come back with Tom Sawyer and 2112. Put Limelight in the middle there and you have a crowd going...did I just hear them run a string of YYZ, Spirit of Radio, Tom Sawyer, Limelight, and 2112 for the close? Yes you did. Talk about missed opportunities.

Memo to Rush...never alternate concrete hits regardless of how many times fans like myself have heard them. I am honest and accepting enough to understand certain songs have to be played but your set list structure has been really terrible the last decade. Not so much the songs but the placement has been all wrong.

4. I love the first half of the show as a big 80s fan. All of those songs deserved the justice you gave them. I am a fan of every song in the first half of the show but I have to ask why are you playing it so safe? Always The Big Money. Always Force Ten. Always Sudivisions. Always The Pass. Always Bravado. Always for the most part, songs that you have played on multiple tours many times over and over. When you think about the songs you have not played in decades or haven't played period, it boggles the mind that you deliver the same songs you really just rotate every other tour. Last year when you brought back Time Stand Still it was a huge treat. That song should have been a staple that never left the set! That was a true certified hit for Rush! Radio play was always there for it and it was heavily on MTV as well. It seems like a discussion went on also with Stick It Out. Neil has said he can't stand the song and there he was playing it. Yes, it was a huge #1 AOR hit in 1993. But you hadn't played it since 1997 on the TFE tour and it was completely forgotten by the fan base that has been seeing your shows since!

All of that work in the 80s and 90s as far as radio hits should never have been dropped. Distant Early Warning = hit, New World Man = hit, Vital Signs = Huge MTV song in 1981-82-83 and you stopped playing it after 1984 until 2002! Time Stand Still hadn't been played since 1994! Ghost of a Chance returned in the Summer of 2008 for the first time since 1992! That was a #1 AOR hit! Cold Fire? Not played since 1994! Test For Echo? Not since 1997-98 tour!  Again, #1 AOR hit. Show Don't Tell #1 AOR hit.

I could go on but I just never understood why you ignore your big radio hits from back in those decades.

I am not going to sit here and say you need to play Fly By Night and Hemispheres and A Farewell To Kings and a host of 1970s songs. Geddy's voice just doesn't have the range any longer. I am saying you should not shy away from your past successes and keep songs away for so long that the casual fans forget all too quickly. Now we have classic rock radio programmers telling us what to listen to from you and saying nobody knows or wants those songs...well...it's your job to keep your back catalog alive and well since you don't want to alternate your songs every night like Pearl Jam, Dave Matthews Band, Van Halen etc...

5. Geddy's voice has always been something I have loved...however..there is no reason he should be yelping and yodeling lyrics that were very low key to begin with. For some reason he has the urge to put high notes where they don't belong. I fear he has a good amount of hearing loss at low levels and his settings are all wrong in his IEM's.  His voice is not as bad on this Blu-ray as it was on Time Machine. My God his voice is just uncomfortable to listen to on that recording.

6. It would be refreshing if Alex brought some Fender's out once in awhile especially a Strat and Geddy brought out the Rick, Wal, or Steinberger. Your audience is made up of a ton of musicians who do get off on that stuff still.

7. I saw the shows in San Antonio, Houston, and Austin and this show would have been better off filmed in San Antonio on the Friday night when the crowd was crazy and totally into it. Also the upper deck was not partially tarped off like it was in Dallas.

8. My recommendation FOR purchase lies within the first disc and a lot of the Clockwork Angels material. You really don't need another version of Tom Sawyer, YYZ, 2112, Spirit of Radio, and the same ole songs you have seen a million times. But if you never were exposed to the brilliance of Power Windows and Grace Under Pressure because some idiot told you they sucked int he 80s....here is your chance to see different for yourself.

9. The string section should have been utilized for 2 other songs and the band knows it. Those songs are Losing It and Jacob's Ladder. I will not go further into this discussion as everyone with knowledge of the band's catalog knows this was a huge lost opportunity.

10. Where's My Thing? is on it...that alone is enough of a reason to buy it ;)",1386547200,,8157,4.296031229668185
5969824,3,B00F878KFM,"My review consists only of this complaint, which is more of a complaint about the tour's setlist: why no ""BU2B""?  Unfortunately I missed the tour, but cannot believe that they chose not to play what is arguably the hardest-hitting track on ""Clockwork Angels.""  I predicted in 2010 that ""BU2B"" would become a new signature song, a required encore like ""Tom Sawyer"" or ""Close to the Heart"" (I'd put ""Far Cry"" on that list, too), and am very disappointed that it isn't here.

As for the DVD, I found it fairly standard, and the audio mix was good enough for me--though I think it does suffer a bit from the current mania for compression that so badly marred ""Vapor Trails.""  They went back and fixed that--but must have been so focused on that that they didn't pay enough attention to this one.  A few more weeks of fine-tuning would have helped, instead of rushing it out in time for Xmas.",1386547200,,887,4.553459119496855

IMO, the video alone is dizzying and really unwatchable. Who did Rush use to record this? What lamebrain thought it would be cool to change the viewing on the concert ever 3.5 seconds including view from looking between heads, arm waves, and the back of the floor and arena. Here's some basic advice: for most of concert videos, people want a centering, close to front 5-10 rows view. Especially with Rush's visual show, we want to see the lighting, video backdrop, special effects. Yes, you can pan from SOME different perspectives. Changing views and angles ever 3.5 seconds from every distance, angle, from bad seating views to showing them walking up to the stage while the video is playing. MASSIVE over edit. I have no feel for even being at this concert. It's a video disaster. Try to put this video back together, please.

I would have to imagine that there are some settings on your receiver that need to be matched with the disc.  If that's not the case then I don't hear any of what is being said.  I hear everything perfectly loud and clear.  Guitars sound great as does everything else.  I thought it was mixed rather well.

5969833,4,B00F878KFM,"If you love Rush and their sense of Humor, I guess I don't need to tell you this is a must have.  If you like Rush post 1984, You're going to really like this. If you love the new material just as much as the old, You're going to love this. If you don't like Rush beyond ""the hits"", and don't like the new material. You might not like this. They do still manage to slip in a few old favourites though. I will say, if you don't like or are not familiar with the new material and would like Rush to try and change your mind, This is it. The new songs sound GREAT live. Geddy's voice is best suited in the newer songs and he's enthusiastic in this performance. The Band plays really well off the string section and it's fun to see that dynamic. The strings add a new element to an already great album.. All three members have killer musical moments in the show and there are some surprises if you haven't seen the tour. Geddy's said in many interviews that these Live releases are meant as a souvenir for the tour and a representation of the band live at the time. In that way, it's well worth the money if you want to remember the tour, or wanted to see it and couldn't. That's my review for the setlist and the Band. For the Audiophiles, the sound isn't that great. I'm constantly disappointed in Rush's Live ""DTS"" offerings. Surround seems to be an after thought and It always comes out just ""ok"". If you don't have good speakers or a decent system it actually sounds pretty crappy. This is why I knocked off a star. If I listened to this just through low quality tv speakers, it's lackluster.  A serious ""con"" for me personally was the mix on the extra songs.  A. I have always wanted to hear The Manhattan Project"" live a with string section. It was played on this tour but, it's not included in the main set list on this show. B. Middletown Dreams has never appeared on any live offering from Rush, and it's one of my favourite songs. It would have been nice if they were included in the main set, and got a proper mix. Objectively, this is a great purchase for a die hard fan, or someone who enjoys home theater concerts.

I pre-screened the show on Palladia (CATV) last weekend. Frankly, the video editing made me dizzy. The camera spends a few second on each shot in-turn, then on to the next subject. I stopped watching it after about 45 minutes. Simply awful camera and video work.",1386115200,4,336,4.6

After watching at home, my take is this: I enjoyed it because it is different; it's not great, but the un-perfect sound quality, camera techniques and surround mixing all combine to give a very realistic experience of what it's like to be at a live Rush show.  So if that's what they were going for, I get it.  I really do.  But what worries me is that they might actually believe that at this point in their careers, fans will buy anything that they put out, and as a result, just ""phoned in"" the production of this video.  I hope that's not the case, and it will be interesting what comments the band members make about this in the future.  Even though I did enjoy it, I knocked it a star because I'm kinda bummed....because this tour featured music from one of my favorite albums, Power Windows, which represented the peak of production and refinement in their careers, and I was hoping, and assuming, that this video would be the same with the understanding that it is a live recording afterall.  And that's not what this is.  So in summary, I don't know which way to go: if it was intentionally produced the way it was to provide a life like concert experience, OR that they just gave a half hearted effort that really shows through....and that would surprise me.

Still, I think it's definitely worth buying, so don't listen to the haters here.

5969840,3,B00F878KFM,"My favorite band of all time: Rush. My favorite concert DVD of all time: U2's Rattle and Hum even though I've never bought a U2 CD and never will. I was hoping this DVD wouldn't be like Rush in Rio. When I saw the trailer of 'The Garden' my hopes were high. But alas, the balance of this DVD was similarly edited by someone who fancies themself a cutting room craftsman and while we fans want to hear the music and see the show as if we were there, the editor wants us to behold his greatness at being able to deftly display Alex, then Neil, then Alex, then Geddy, then Neil, then Alex, then Geddy all in about 12 seconds. Once again, we can all experience what it is like to go to a Rush concert with severe ADD.

Everyone who edits a concert DVD should be required to study Rattle and Hum for weeks beforehand.

That being said, I loved the show. The only let down...the setlist, of course. I knew the first part of the show was going to feature the Power Windows and Grace Under Pressure CDs. Great! And it was great! And the way it all ended with Far Cry left me anticipating a second half of new material starting with the entire (almost) Clockwork Angels CD. Yaaaayyy! Alright!

5969841,2,B00F878KFM,"Most complaints are about the audio (and justifiably so) but the video is just as bad if not worse.

First, the concert was shot at 60 fields per second instead of 24 frames per second -- as a result it looks like live tv instead of film. Why is this bad? Because it looks like something your local tv studio filmed -- everything is overly crisp, overly saturated, overly smooth if that makes sense. The image is very flat, and has no warmth. I believe they used 24 frames per second on Time Machine, Snakes and Arrows, and R30 dvds and they should've stuck with that.

Second, the hyperactive editing is annoying. The vast majority of shots last no longer than 3 seconds. That type of editing might work for trailers and a single music video, but not for a 3 hour concert. They should have gone with half as many cuts.

Third, all the audience shots. I guess the producers had cameras mingling among the audience. I get it -- the director wants you to feel like you're there. Audience shots are cool every once in a while, but they really got carried away on this one. Furthermore, I'm sure the audience are all nice people, but when Neil Peart does a big drum fill, I want to see him do it, not some dude (or dudette) air drumming in the audience.

This DVD has one thing going it: it captures the light show very well. Rush always puts on a spectacular light show and this one captures it better than the other rush live DVDs. However, this does come at some cost: the color balance is badly off on many shots -- I think as they were trying to get the lights correct, many times the other colors (including skin tone) is completely washed out.

And of course, the audio stinks. The other reviews cover that well.

That said: Snakes and Arrows (still my my fav) and Time Machine are still the best Rush DVD's. Rio and R30 are second tier. This one is at the bottom.",1385942400,11,1867,4.335243553008596
5969842,4,B00F878KFM,"I have been a Rush fan for years now and I've liked 99.9% of the material they've put out. Even with arguably ""clunker"" songs like ""Dog Years"", I've come to appreciate the very Rush-like quirkiness to them. That being said, I was very excited about this new DVD/Blu-Ray release. I was able to attend 2 separate shows on the tour and couldn't wait to see it over and over again at my convenience at home.

As for the Blu-Ray, I feel like the colors and overall visual quality is superb. The only complaint I have is that the camera angles change too abruptly and they pan where it makes it a bit hard to focus on a specific member of the band. Not to say that there aren't some pretty good angles, though. Because there are.

While the audio, in my opinion, is certainly tolerable, there are definitely some obvious problems. I wish Neil had a bit more ""oomph"". I feel like it maybe falls flat. And there are times where the audio is muddy, making it a bit difficult to hear Geddy's bass clearly. I would say the most distracting thing, however, is the obvious aging of Ged's voice - which is obviously inevitable, but I feel like he's really struggling here. Unfortunately, I feel like he struggles particularly on ""The Garden"", as if it's too low for him to maintain the right notes. On a lot of the songs, I feel like he's singing through a head cold, or something. He sounds like he's singing right through his nose, at some points.

But, despite all of this, I still enjoyed the DVD and Blu-Ray (I purchased both of them). There are some really great songs on there. ""The Analog Kid"", in particular, was a gem for me. That, and the documentary, ""Can't Stop Thinking Big"" was done very nicely. Great filming, nice interviews, and a pretty cool ""inside look"" of the concert. They also added some of their sound check, which was interesting!

So, overall, while there definitely could be some improvements -- I would say it was worth its money. All three guys look like they are enjoying themselves immensely.",1385856000,4,2010,4.528925619834711

5969846,5,B00F878KFM,"A year before my 50th Birthday, my wife of 32 years said to me... ""You'd better see these boys before it's too late"" and handed me a ""pass"" to see Rush live in Las Vegas, 2012-11-23.

Since 1980, at the tender age of 16 I dreamed of Rush touring to New Zealand or at least Australia. So to be finally be in a position to afford to fly over 6800 miles to see them live last year, was a long time dream come true.

I was really excited with the Clockwork Angels release and it was an opportunity I will always be grateful for.
I flew out on 21-11-12 (what a magic Rush type date to fly out) and this latest Rush Live DVD / Blu Ray / CD was largely recorded a few days after the Las Vegas gig and is pretty much as I remember it and it is beautifully captured on both CD and Blu Ray (These are the two formats I purchased last week).

The set list, playing, Live production of both audio and visual is stunning.

Alex (Gtr), Geddy (Bass, Keys, Vocals) and Neil (Drums) really give a fantastic performance, as do the String section that accompanied them on this tour .

I love Clockwork Angels so was really pleased they played the bulk of that plus they dusted off some stuff that hasn't appeared on an official live release before (Grand Designs, Territories, Middletown Dreams from ""Power Windows"" (1985), Body Electric from ""Grace Under Pressure"" (1984) and Where's my thing from ""Roll the bones"" (1991). (Note the extra tracks at the end of the main concert are those that were not played at the Dallas show, but played at the Phoenix show as they alternated a few tracks each night they played.

So to have these tracks plus the Clockwork Angels suite meant a lot of stuff I hadn't heard live before, together with classics such as Tom Sawyer, Spirit of Radio, YYZ, Subdivisions, 2112 (Parts I, II and VII) and other incredible versions of songs such as Analog Kid, Where's my thing etc.

I can't speak highly enough of this release, it captures my memories very well. I've always felt bands have three great albums in them... The first normally in their youth full of energy and passion, the second touring a classic album and the third a celebration of time (eg 30 years). In this case Rush have had 1.""All the words a Stage"" from 1976, 2.""Exit... Stage Left"" from 1981 and 3.""R30"" from 2004.

In Rush's case I believe they have had two others... 4. ""Rush in Rio"" from 2002, 5 years after Neil returned and the band got back together after losing his wife and daughter. The 5th entry for Rush is this latest effort, touring on the back of their classic Clockwork Angels album, one of their top 5 albums in their 20 album and coming up to 40 year career.

If you like Rush and / or great rock music and decide to get this I hope you like it as much as I do, highly recommended... 5 Big Stars for 3 great guys.",1385769600,4,2812,4.330798479087452
5969847,5,B00F878KFM,"First off, I hate to be the kind of jerk who comes on here and says ""oh it was just fine for me"", but I've noticed the majority of the reviews are slamming the audio and saying you can't hear Neil's drums. Alright, I don't know what you guys are complaining about, maybe the setup on your sound system isn't right. Because I could hear the drums just perfectly! Sure they're mixed a bit low in the beginning but over course of the concert, the drums become more apparent. Alright, admittedly not all is dandy on the blu-ray, the menu was a it of a nightmare to navigate in the first insert, but if you plug in a USB stick, it becomes easier to use.

Alright, now that's out of the way, I am lucky enough to have gone to two shows on the Clockwork Angels tour, the Edmonton one and the Red Deer one, and I can say that those were two of the best concerts I've ever been to! There's two bands nowadays that know how to deliver the goods every time: Iron Maiden and Rush. Both don't mess around, and they cut the crap and deliver one hell of a show. Rush are especially great because they can perform for three hours straight without a dip in quality. Both shows showcased the three-piece's skill and sheer energy, and this blu-ray does not shy away at all from that.

Alright, so sure, Geddy can't hit the high notes like he used to. But throw this friggin' dog a bone; he's in his 60s and he has plenty of youthful energy and you can tell he loves doing what he does. You'd expect him to be giving his most conservative stage presence, but if this blu-ray is any indication, Geddy isn't just any 60 year old. He hops around the stage like a hyperactive 12 year old and his fingers are still almighty. And boy does he look good too! The rest of the band absolutely kill here at what they do. Alex is still absolutely incredible with his guitar work; his solos on Headlong Flight and YYZ especially show he's got it in him. And Neil, well, he's not capable of giving a bad performance. Still the greatest drummer after all these years, he has a three solos here, and at one point resorts to his electronic drum kit for a seriously trippy song where he controls synth notes with his toms.

The theatrics are worth mentioning too; with Geddy's new backing being a popcorn maker, and a gorgeous red carpet decking the stage, as well as the usual pyrotechnics (admit it, you jumped out of your seat during the one hit in Red Sector A!) and this time, a string ensemble. The string ensemble add so much more to the songs than you'd expect. Carnies especially sounds absolutely beautiful with strings, and the pyrotechnic freak out at the end is just killer. Also, ever wanted to hear YYZ with strings at the beginning? You won't be let down. The setlist is also worth a mention; so many songs that haven't been played in years and never recorded live. The Analog Kid and Territories, just absolutely brilliant, and that's just where it begins!

As for extras, we get the full videos used as the intros and intermission videos, a rather bizarre but at least chuckle worthy Family Guy parody named Family Goy, ""Family Sawyer"" which is a polka version of Tom Sawyers, a stellar documentary and some more Rush being silly. Rush are seriously so funny, they have a great sense of humour and should consider having their own sketch show on CBC! And of course, bonus performances that include Limelight, Manhattan Project and The Pass. Working Man would have been nice, as it was performed at a few shows too, but that's just one small hiccup on an otherwise brilliant blu-ray set.

Time has definitely been kind to Rush and this blu-ray is proof. They may be aging, but they're not showing any signs of slowing down and seem to be enjoying the ride. And you know what, let them. They've earned it. Nice one, Rush! By all means, this is a must-own for fans, and I even prefer it to Time Macbine. So by all means, buy it!",1385769600,5,3905,4.403047091412742
5969848,2,B00F878KFM,"I saw this show live in San Jose, CA.  Owning many of the Rush live Blu-Rays - I had high expectations for this  release.  And I am heart broken to discover what other reviewers here are saying is soooo correct - - this release is an audio disaster.  I am shocked that Rush would actually release this - especially after setting the bar so high with the DTS 5.1 release of the Moving Pictures studio album.  The camera work and editing isn't far behind the audio - definitely amateur hour.  And that's coming from someone in the video production biz for 30 years.  Read the reviews all over here for the long list of audio problems - muddy, shrill, can't hardly hear Neil, too much of one thing here, not enough of the other there.  I tried every adjustment on my $10k system - nothing helped.  It sounds like a mix of a dozen mics placed around the arena.
 Geddy closes every show with ""Best audience ever"" - well sorry guys - this was ""Worst DVD ever"".  Too bad - - very sad.",1385769600,8,977,4.284153005464481

5969850,5,B00F878KFM,"I own every Rush Blu-ray and I am baffled at the amount of negative reviews this release is receiving.  Considering the setlist, band performance, video quality and sound quality, I would consider this to be their best video release.  Could Neil's drums be slightly more prominent in the mix?  Yes.  That is a minor quibble, you can still hear everything he plays clearly. Overall, the audio sounds great.  Alex's guitar has never sounded sharper.  Geddy's bass and voice sound fine.  I have had this thing cranked on my system and it's a thing of beauty.  Don't believe reviews saying the audio is horrible.  That is nonsense.  In my opinion the visuals for this are the sharpest and most spectacular of any concert video I own, bar none.  I probably own over 100 titles spanning the rock spectrum.

So don't believe the bad reviews.  If you are a Rush fan, this is an essential release.",1385596800,5,888,4.688311688311688
5969851,1,B00F878KFM,"I'm a fan of RUSH and am very disappointed in the quality of the audio production of this new set.
- The percussion and singing are muffled.
- During many of Geddy Lee's vocals, his mouth is out of sync with the actual words in the audio.

I even had the company that installed our entertainment center check out the sound options.  Unfortunately the culprit is the DVD.",1385596800,7,370,4.426470588235294
5969852,2,B00F878KFM,"A quick glance over the reviews for Rush's new DVD and there is only one or two mentions of Geddy's voice - the other bad reviews highlight the picture/audio quality which funny enough I find to be ok.

I want to like this dvd i really do, being a big fan of their new albums and by Looking at the setlist it's too good to be true a whole slew of drum solos, set one's reliance on the latter 80s stuff is also an interesting choice.

Then I watched it and it immediately cleared the room, Geddy's voice wavers and warbles all over the place as he appears to be inwardly singing in a tenacious d sense. It's just awkward to watch him grimace as he struggles to hit any note regardless of register on both new and old material

Just to reiterate I am not bashing rush here Clockwork angels and Snakes and Arrows are two of my favourite rush albums which makes it more infuriating - his voice sounds good on those records

Standout moments on this DVD would be Caravan and Clockwork Angels the latter especially.

If you need a DVD of rush I recommend getting the snakes and arrows DVD instead.",1385510400,6,1091,4.302439024390244
5969853,5,B00F878KFM,"Received the Blu-ray on 11/22. I have all Rush's live Blu-ray concerts and all are excellent. I have not missed a Rush concert in or near CT since first seeing them in 1981 (Moving Pictures) and have been a huge fan since. Also saw the Clockwork Angles tour twice, in Oct. 2012 and May 2013. Now, about this Blu-ray. The video and sound quality of this recording is suburb. I'm still getting to know the performance, but this might be their best live Blu-ray so far. What makes this extra special is intensity, power and the way the band completely locks into the music. All their live Blu-Rays have these qualities, but this one has just a bit more in my opinion. If you enjoy music that is beautiful, powerful, complex and performed by virtuoso musicians, I believe you will appreciate and hopefully love, this concert.",1385510400,,821,4.63013698630137

5969856,5,B00F878KFM,"I love Rush and thought this was an excellent tour.  Seeing it released on BluRay was awesome, and I thought the sound quality and video were just fine.  One of the things I like about this BluRay is that it's pretty meat-and-potatoes Rush.  There is a little bit of a humorous introduction, but then it's more or less just them playing for the entire show (plus intermission), so it really matches-up pretty well the experience of going to the concert.  Also, the camera didn't really go for many weird angle shots, (like behind the band or from high above), which I think is good because it really makes you feel like you are watching Rush live and not watching a Rush documentary.  Only complaint was that the front row of the audience was full of older male business executive types and I have to imagine that Rush would rather it be filled with cool dudes and hot chicks instead of balding CEO's who can afford to pay 2 grand for a front-row ticket.  But they take it in stride and still keep rocking.",1385510400,5,1006,4.469945355191257
5969857,2,B00F878KFM,"I know I will get thrashed and flamed by the hard-core Rush fans for it, too. The string section feels very gimmicky, maybe their presence was in part to help cover up Geddys voice, which is almost completely shot. The past 10 years have not been kind in that respect. Geddy could still hit a few high notes during the Snakes and Arrow tour, but you could tell hes straining. Then for Time Machine, it was just barely passable. Now it is officially unlistenable in my very humble opinion. I worship the ground Mr. Lee walks on, but I cannot ignore the obvious any longer. I think he needs to at least consider either hanging it up, or getting vocal cord surgery a la Steve Tyler.
Audio quality was less than impressive. Mute, muffled and not a lot of ring or sparkle. Very disappointing, but hardly surprising. Their past concert films are hit or miss in this dept.
The band just looks and plays tired, they definitely deserve a nice long break from touring. On a positive note, I thoroughly enjoyed the many selections from their 80s-albums in the first half.",1385510400,6,1060,4.554973821989528

5969860,1,B00F878KFM,"The audio alone on this concert is excellent, the strings could be just a tad bit louder. But the real issue i have with the video aspect is there is a cut every 3 seconds. No joke. There were some EXCELLENT visuals at the actual concert when i saw them in Cleveland this tour, but all of those are wasted. The sweet pyro on Carnies? Yeah no, you get to see it from 12 different 3 second cuts. The cool ""angel wings"" effect of the video screens above the stage? Yeah some dude holding his cellphone and recording his screen is a MUCH better choice there. The great film effects on the rear screen that the director won an award for? Man what a waste. And some of the ""Go Pro"" cameras they used for filming were downright AWFUL, all kinds of artifacts in the video. The ""normal"" cameras they use provide some stunning clarity for the 3 seconds they kept the cut, but then others it appears fuzzy or hazy. It pains me to write THIS bad of a review for a concert film of my favorite band, but this is THE worst Rush concert film i have seen.",1385424000,7,1038,4.195
5969861,5,B00F878KFM,"LOVE the Video but hate the Audio. It seems as if the wrong mix (rear tracks instead of front left / right) was used on the pressing of the Blu-ray. Audio is loud but everything seems to be lumped into one wall of sound. I could not hear any separation between vocals and drums (something is really wrong if you try to listen to the first drum solo and can not hear individual drums). I think this blu-ray should be evaluated & recalled and a proper audio mix offered. Time Machine & Snakes + Arrows  DO NOT sound like this blu-ray release. Otherwise the video presentation is beautiful. I only watched the first set and turned off the disc before the 2nd set was performed. I listened to this on a 5.1 surround system. I immediately put in my brand new George Thorogood blu-ray and was blown away how crystal clear the audio separation and balance was presented on that disc.

Edit: Just revisited this Blu-Ray tonight. I just switched/changed some of my receiver settings, mainly I had something called Cinema EQ turned on and decided to turn it off and... WOW!!! I can now hear everything crystal clear and separated. For some reason (I assume) this setting must be cancelling this particular audio mix out or possibly compressing it to the point where everything had this muffled sound to it. It might explain some of the other conflicting reviewers issues with bad audio as opposed to the exact opposite Rave reviews regarding the Audio Mix. I also switched out my optical cable for a coaxial type which (i doubt since it is digital anyway) maybe helped my particular situation.

Try tweaking any EQ settings that may needlessly be activated and see if it helps any.",1385424000,20,1671,4.638513513513513
5969862,2,B00F878KFM,"At the risk of piling on... well it has to be said. I realize the band is very loyal to the people that have worked with them over the years, but Rush's reputation for  audio presentation is getting destroyed by the inconsistent offerings. This may be the worst. I collect concerts and have very good gear to play this on, and no amount of adjusting can do anything with this. They need to work with some new people (Steven Wilson?). Geddy's bass is too low or non existent (Tom Sawyer). The analog pedals are a mess of muddy noise. Geddy's vocals are buried and Neil's drums are so thin and lacking any weight, that the power of his performance is lost. This is management's fault, and this disgrace of a release should never have seen the light of day. I buy everything they release and I can honestly say that this will never see the player again. It is as bad as the reviews here state.",1385424000,5,890,4.36144578313253
5969863,5,B00F878KFM,"This is by far one of my favorite concerts.  I saw it twice in person (in Pittsburgh and Cleveland) and was counting down the days until the blu ray would be released.  I loved the Time Machine tour, but in my opinion, the set list for this tour was much better.  I find it refreshing that a band that has been around as long as these guys is willing to take risks and challenge their audience.  I love the 80s period of Rush (probably because it reminds me of my long lost youth) and as far as I am concerned Clockwork Angels is just as good or better than anything they have ever released.  Don't worry, if you are only into the old school stuff, you have YYZ, The Spirit of Radio, Tom Sawyer and 2112.  But lets face it, we've seen and heard those to death.  As far as the blu ray itself, the images are beautiful and crystal clear.  The one complaint I have with the blu ray is that the defualt setting for the audio is not the DTS-HD, so when I first watched it, I thought the sound wasn't so great, but once I went to the settings and changed it to DTS-HD, I was blown away by the sound.",1385337600,9,1093,4.074766355140187
5969864,2,B00F878KFM,"I've been a big fan for a long time...I stopped going to see Rush live about 10 years ago because I could no longer justify spending as much money as they're charging for a ticket only to be subjected to terrible sound.  Now, I can experience this terrible sound in my living room!  I honestly don't know how a product that has this many problems with the audio can be released...Now we have a live video where you can't hear 2 out of 3 members of the band!  I guess it's a good thing that there are 3 drum solos, since it's the only time drums can be heard!  I have a reasonably good surround system (Onkyo Receiver, Paradigm and Monitor Audio speakers), and other live Blu Rays sound anywhere from very good to incredible...Not this one.  Vocals and Drums are buried, Bass guitar and Bass Pedals are just a mass of undefined low end, string section is almost totally irrelevant, and the guitar is screaming above everything else at all times.  I like Alex Lifeson a lot, but I would like to hear the rest of the band.  To me, the whole idea of releasing a live Blu Ray is so that the music can be heard the way its supposed to sound without the adverse effects of an arena.  I was really looking forward to this release.  I think Clockwork Angels is their best album since Counterparts...Maybe before.  The setlist included some great stuff that they haven't played in a long time, the band is still playing great.  So, what could have been amazing turned out to be unlistenable.  At this point, I can only hope that this is not their last release...And that, if there is another, they will allow someone who knows how to mix to produce it.  All things considered, I feel like the 2 star rating is generous.",1385337600,5,1709,4.404458598726115
5969865,4,B00F878KFM,"The most written story about a assassination is the death of J.F. Kennedy. It's in the same city that almost 50 years later Rush played their concert for the ""Clockwork Angels"" tour. The release of the show is almost 50 years later, precisely, November 19th. To push thing further, i make sure to watch it November 22th! This time, the picture quality is more enjoyable than on the ""Time Machine"" Tour, were the arena seems to have been immersed in a fog, probably cause by those big machines on stage... The first half of the show is concentrated in the 80's songs, so much that we can call it the 80's tour. We have two songs that have not been played for a long time : ""Grand Designs"" and ""The Body Electric"". The band has reserve the new album ""Clockwork Angels"" for the second set with songs that are hits and misses, those songs are played with the string ensemble orchestra.

The camera work is something that we'll never pleased everyone, i am not to severe on that aspect, as long has we get a mix of close and distant shots, which is the case here. There is some shots from the audience with some heads blocking the views, but it doesn't happened often. Rush are known to play the studios songs to perfection, but they added a little improvisation part on the song ""Force Ten"". From the first song ""Subdivisions"", you know that there is something wrong; the drums of Neil can't be heard. There is some improvement the rest of the show, but still the audio mix is low on the drums and the bass. Alex's guitar are a bit too loud.

As the addition of the string ensemble, i always have reserve to bring some strings instruments when a rock band play some heavy rock. It can be interesting during the quieter parts. I have listen to ""The Anarchist"", ""Carnies"" and ""Wish them Well"" many times, and i can't get any feelings from those songs and the live versions didn't change anything for me. But on the other hand, ""Clockwork Angels"" and ""The Garden"" are simply great songs that will become future classics in the Rush repertoire. The band close the concert with some old songs including the always enjoyable ""Spirit of Radio"".

Nice performance with a nice picture quality, probably their best ever in all their DVDS with a dominant blue lighting, but the audio could have been better, especially when you have a great drummer that has the best drum kit, and a nice bass player with Geddy Lee. As for the extras, the main feature is the documentary, the rest is short segments of lighter subjects that we'll make you laugh a little. Don't forget that there is 4 more songs of the same quality in the bonus section and a ""Easter eggs"" easy to find on the main menu.",1385337600,3,2671,4.491769547325103
5969866,4,B00F878KFM,"First of all, let me say that if you told me 30 years ago when I saw my first Rush concert (Grace Under Pressure Tour) that these guys would still be producing new material and touring in 2013, I'd have been suprised, estatic and totally proud of my favorite band. In 2013, that's exactly how I feel about this band, their longevity, their relevance and their legacy. I've even been surprised by the long-overdue attention and accolades that they have received in the past decade, culminating in their Rock Hall election last year. Not that it ever mattered to be, but Rush is mainstream cool these days.

I saw the Clockwork Angels tour in Cleveland and I was once again anxious view the tour DVD. What better way to re-experience the concert, see the band a bit more close up and experience their fine musicianship once again? This DVD is all that (the video quality is excellent), plus you get a few extras as well such as the Clockwork Angels tour documentary. As to the concert itself, the part that really moved me the most was the second set featuring the selections from their latest album, including the string section and all the visual displays. What a spectacular visual and musical experience it was! The band showed such energy (I really think they like playing the new material) right through to the moving finale, ""The Garden"". For me, it just all fit together the best during this section of the concert. As a longtime fan, I was impressed.

That said, this is the first Rush item that I've ever given a rating less than 5 stars. Why? First off, I don't think Geddy sounded too good on this one. Vocally, he was really straining at points and I thought that he would even go a little too far with certain vocalizations and the result was not his best. Secondly, although I appreciated hearing a lot of the 80's material, I had to say that the opener ""Subdivisions"" was a little flat (the Time Machine Tour version is so much heavier and powerful) and again, Geddy's vocals didn't help on songs like ""Territories"" and ""Grand Designs"". One final thing to mention is that the stage design and special effects are definitely toned down in some ways and I don't think this is a good thing. The band seems to really rely on the background screens way too much for shots of themselves in action. I much preferred the video productions of the past. They were way more artsy and cool. I also miss the lasers in Dreamline and Red Sector A. We need some smoke machines too. The combination of the the lasers and the smoking mist on these songs provided a certain mystique to Rush's stage presence. Ok. I get it. They are just kicking back and enjoying the playing and have stripped down some of the elements of the past. I guess the funny intro films are their main investment now. I do enjoy the guys hamming it up in their acting roles, but I want it all. I also thought the encore came across as a little to obligatory, rather than full of excitement (they should have done Closer to the Heart and/or Xanadu)

Don't get me wrong, this concert is still good. I just don't think its their best (and by far). The main point is that Rush is still making new and interesting music as they enter their 60's. They can still rock and still make that big Rush sound come alive. I'll be there, the next time they go on tour.",1385337600,3,3323,4.48019801980198

As for the sound - I have no complaints on the blue ray or the audio CD, sounds great on my 5.1 surround system, very crisp and clear.

5969876,4,B00F878KFM,"Compared to other live Rush Clockwork Angels is by far the best from an audio quality standpoint. There is very beautiful definition of the individual instruments and clarity of tone. This is no small feat with HEAVY music such as this. THE AUDIO IS GREAT!!!!!

Why I found the video BAD.
The actual footage from the cameras is good. It is the editing I came to hate. I found that every shot seemed interrupted. It is as if Editor number one carefully set up very good shots by focusing on a lyric or part of the music being played that was a good and sensible thing to be focused on. The video would have been fine if they had used this version with few if any tweaks. However they seem to have decided to commission Editor number two to cut some secondary angle into every single shot. There were lots and lots of cameras perhaps editor number two was tasked with justifying their expense.
This made for in my opinion a very bad viewing experience. The constant cutting away gets annoying. There is a sense to many shots that gets interrupted and this is just like someone you want to hear and understand being kept from finishing a sentence or thought over and over again.
For example during the song Dreamline there is a lyric phrase ""For a limited time"". Not a long lyric and just before Geddy begins singing it Editor number one has a very good shot with one of the main HD Cameras. However short a time it takes for Geddy to sing these few words it is not short enough to leave alone. The sense of focusing on Geddy singing this lyric with one of the main cameras is interrupted with a cut. This scenario repeats itself endlessly.
One of the beauties of a concert video over being there is the variety of angle but apparently it can be overdone.
The Audio is so good and having seen two of the actual concerts it was hard but I had to only give it four stars",1385251200,,1865,4.343839541547278

5969878,4,B00F878KFM,"A great release that is definitely worth buying!! The complete show is captured on this Blu-ray along with songs that were played on other nights of the tour and a cool soundcheck version of Limelight!! The band's performance is great and Geddy sounds better here than on most nights on this tour.. it's still a wonder why they didn't make this film at the beginning of the tour when Geddy was at his best. But still, who cares.. you can see how hard he is trying and his bass playing is superb as always. Also, Alex is very funny on a lot of the songs and there are plenty of great moments from the other members as well!!! The band is on fire!!

Where this film falters is in the production. What is up with the editing?!?!?.. Visually and audibly this film makes you wonder if Rush even saw it and approved of it before it was released. As far as the visual effects, there are some points of this film where it looks like a bunch of kids were editing it. There are constant shots where the back of people's heads take up half of the screen and there are points where the shots change so often that it looks like the editors had ADD or something. Also, what is up with the fact that the band members can never get the respect of having the camera on them when musically the spotlight is on them. It's really frustrating when Geddy is singing one of his really high notes that is somewhat the climax of the song and then the camera turns to Alex and Neil for the whole time... just like when Alex has a guitar solo and the focus is on the audience or the other band members. This was a problem on past live DVDs and I don't understand why the the filmmakers couldn't fix such a simple thing that would make the viewing experience so much more enjoyable. Also, do we really need to see Neil Peart running off the stage at the end of the concert? Really?? They couldn't just finish with a nice visual of Geddy thanking the crowd or Alex throwing his guitar picks. I have to say, visually, the tracks from Phoenix were the best edited and they weren't even the ones from the main show.. Truly disappointing. On the bright side, there are a lot of really cool shots from the top of the arena and Neil's drum set that weren't used on Rush live DVD's before. Also, the overall quality is crystal clear HD and watching it on a big flat screen it feels like I can just jump in to the screen.

As far as the audio, one can wonder who was mixing this concert. The mix isn't terrible and isn't quite as bad as Rush in Rio but it definitely isn't great. You can barely hear Geddy's vocals and bass, the drums hardly cut through the mix, and Alex's guitar is way too loud in most of the songs. I saw Rush twice on this tour and the sound was nothing like this? Again, how can the members of Rush who are such perfectionists let such an audio mix get released? C'mon!!

Another great thing about this release is there are a lot of cool bonus features and the small snippets of what was going on backstage in before the show and during intermission.

Overall, this is a blu-ray that is a must have due to the outstanding performance by the band and the huge amount of content that this film offers. However, these things weren't ruined but definitely could have been much better if the production was of higher quality. I hope to see more live releases from this great band but PLEASE make a huge improvement in video and audio quality next time!!",1385251200,3,3433,4.29320987654321
5969879,5,B00F878KFM,"Well, this has been well worth the wait..!
Displaying an obvious dedication to their (growing) fan base, Rush get slicker and more impressive in (re)presenting their music with each subsequent tour. This 'Clockwork Angels Tour' live release may be the ultimate showcase of the co-ordination, technology and musical chops that Rush has displayed in a career of many highlights. As a special record of a great tour, this is the best Rush blu-ray/DVD/CD live performance to date.
The standouts of this concert are the picture quality and the individual band member performances. First, picture quality - it looks like it was mastered at a higher frame rate of 48-60fps or even in ultra high definition 4K or higher; with impressive definition at times and great black levels in the shadows throughout.
As a fan, it's not unusual to be witness to many a great performance from this band, but some represented here are well, just jaw-dropping...It is a delight for example, to see guitarist Alex Lifeson not only nail his solo on 'The Analog Kid' (to great applause), but also improvising and stretching out some others, as in 'Force Ten'.
Bassist Geddy Lee as usual is astounding on bass while singing, playing keyboards and/or triggering an array of foot pedals with flawless timing. Thankfully, his vocals here are mostly spot-on, with an acceptable amount of 'vocal artifacts' in evidence. Lee's singing has always been an acquired taste for many (as indeed is the case for much of this band's music), but for some fans to trash his current 'belting out' vocal approach (putting more passion into his singing) is like making it to the top of the mountain and then complaining about the last few feet..! Geddy Lee's vocals are distinctive and are a signature part of Rush's sound. Here, as always, it is amazing that he remembers most of Peart's volume of lyrics (helped by a monitor screen), play as well as he does and sing in a complex syncopation...
Then of course, in a clear standout - I must single out for particular praise drummer extraordinaire' Neil Peart. He not only is impressive throughout but his solo on 'Where's My Thing?' finally scales the heights of that in'YYZ' (Exit Stage Left -live 1981) and 'The Rhythm Method' (Different Stages -live 1998) as one of the best rock drum solos ever recorded. It's amazing that Neil Peart's drumming stands up to close scrutiny after 39 years now, while other great rock virtuoso
drummers out there (in Porcupine Tree, Dave Mathews Band, Styx for example) are initially very impressive but with an overfamiliarity over time they become less impressive.
Some fans have already posted disappointment with the sound quality, and sure the first song 'Subdivisions' sounds initially a little veiled in the midrange and muted in the highs (needs 2-3db lift in level, subjectively) but so did the original studio version...The sound quality does improve further into the concert - but it is in keeping with the current sound aesthetic of sounding like 'Moving Pictures' with extra compression and sub-bass extension. However, after a couple of viewings/hearings, the sound quality is perfectly fine, both in 2-channel and 5.1. It definitely does not warrant the out of hand dismissal by some reviews already posted. The sound may not be overtly 'hi-fi'ish or 'studio-like' as their other 5-star live release 'Snakes And Arrows Live'(2008), but you can hear all the drum/bass/guitar parts in clear evidence as performed. It's all there, from the lowest low to the highest high. The CDs sound very good in my car system as well, with great clarity and bass extension to work those subwoofers overtime...
Again, and concluding, this live performance release is truly representative of Rush's greatness as a live act, and those who are fans of this type of music or are somewhat sympathetic to or intrigued by Rush would do well to purchase this - from first to last this is the pinnacle recording of Rush live.

(UPDATED 12/04/13)-The source of the poor sound quality for some reviewers/owners
of this blu-ray or DVD release may be the blu-ray player settings. Go to >player settings>audio>choose""bitstream"" instead of ""PCM"" for Dolby Digital 2 channel
as well as DTS 5.1 channels audio. I hope this resolves the sound issues...",1385251200,5,4273,5.001404494382022
5969880,3,B00F878KFM,"I agree with what others are saying about the sound quality.  It is nowhere near as good as the 'Snakes & Arrows' or 'Time Machine' tour DVDs.  Can't understand why they don't stay with what has worked well before.

Although I very much enjoyed hearing some of the older songs they haven't played in a long time (e.g. Grand Designs, Middletown Dreams, etc.), this wasn't one of my favorite tours they've done.  I was not a fan of the string section.  Interesting idea, but it didn't go over too well for me.  Rush's music doesn't lend itself to string ensembles well like it did for Page/Plant.

Rush is about the only rock band that I ever go to see live anymore and I hope they continue to make great music!  Just need to ensure the product being released for our consumption stands up to quality standards.  The engineering of Rush in Rio and the original Vapor Trails was also disappointing.  These types of problems should not occur.",1385251200,,938,4.562874251497006
5969881,2,B00F878KFM,"While witnessing the Live show in Nashville, the thought and hope was on my mind afterward that Rush would be insane NOT to put out a live version of this second leg. Well, they did, and it surely didn't take a major kick in the butt to do it. It's obvious they were having a great time and a great tour. It shows in this video. As some of these bands get older, they do tend to relax and subdue their approach to playing live, slow things down, de-tune, and soften the vocals a lot. Rush employed some of these things in the show, but it's not obvious in every aspect. For example, you won't see any performances older than 1980, save 2112. The post 1980 arsenal of music is easier vocally (at least, it certainly is for me). 2112 has been de-tuned since 1996. YYZ has slowed considerably since the Grace Under Pressure Tour. But they STILL rock!

It was a ripe time to bring out some of those lost gems of the mid-80's, much of which were mostly neglected in previous tours. The Body Electric, Territories, Grand Designs, Manhattan Project, and Middletown Dreams were all welcome in the setlist this go around---and all of them, stellar performances!

New material was presented in a way that blows away the Clockwork Angels CD, not that the CA CD was even remotely wimpy or lacking. This just steps it up yet another notch. Headlong Flight is probably the best performance of the show, with some very creative and well-timed elements added for even more appeal to the band's inter-connectivity. Check it out.

(Spoiler Alert) I won't give away exactly what happens at the very end of the encore, but I thought it was hilarious! I'm sure it's somewhat a true routine, but it's just funny how the video focuses on this vs. the usual footage... (staff comment is also hilarious)

Outtakes: I was actually hoping the outtakes would have included some issues encountered during some of the shows. For example, if you search for ""Alex Lifeson's guitar broke"" on YouTube, you'll crack up. THAT should have somehow been on this Blu-Ray disc! Maybe even issues like this collected over the years.

Tour documentary: It's likeable. I highly recommend watching it for the human-aspect, and how these guys do say this is going to work with a team. I dig that. It's true. Although, word of caution: you'll think their lives are so easy and lavish compared to your own. Few people every get to live life like this and still consider it a harder-than-normal life.

Now, the audio: Yes, there are some critics regarding the audio of this video. I agree. The audio is VERY fatiguing on the ears, mainly from guitar and some consonants from vocals. It's a bright, harsh mix lacking on some full bottom end. I had to drop in a parametric EQ into my chain and do some serious cutting at about 3.7Khz with a medium Q to get rid of the high-end. The sub-frequencies are fine, as are some lower mids and cymbals, etc, but the aforementioned high-end crushes all that unless you can cut it. It's HARD on the ears. Studios and bands tend to forget: the band is not the customer, the fans are. It's obvious this mix didn't go through a screening step.

EDIT: I had to keep trying with this one. Audio still needs serious work. I can't believe how hard on the ears this is! Guitars are obviously too loud, cymbals sound terribly ring-y, and some synths are shrill and piercing. I really don't understand how this happened. For example, listen to the mid-section of Force Ten. WHY?! Why does Alex NEED to be THAT LOUD! I had to drop my review another star. I can't watch this show without ear-plugs!",1385251200,4,3574,4.575

I was then listening to just DTS-HD Master Audio, no Room Calibration even and the concert sounded GREAT.

I enjoyed the Clockwork Angels blu-ray; the camera work and editing captures and presents the show very well indeed. But the 5.1 sound is a major letdown. I was quite surprised by how muddy the mix was as Subdivisions kicked in. I thought I must have had a setting wrong, but after checking everything I determined with certainty the sound issues originated from the disc. It just seems so strange to me because the Rush audio live experience is always so crisp, balanced, crystal clear and with all instrumentation clearly distinguishable. That is definitely not the case here. Somehow that clarity is entirely lost. The botch job on the 5.1 mix is quite perplexing. It is the definition of a muddy mix. The drums suffer the worse and are absolutely buried. How this mix was approved by anyone is beyond me. The performance itself is wonderful, and the visuals outstanding. In other words with the performance and visuals we get what we expect from Rush and more, but with the audio mix we get something entirely incongruent.",1385164800,9,1152,4.8232323232323235

My buddy and I looked at each other and said, ""Where's the bass?"" Played the Blu-Ray on my 5.1 the next day...is something set wrong? Where's the bass? Then tried the CD in my car and on my bedroom 2.1...no bass. I don't mean no bass guitar, of course, I mean there is very little to at times no bottom in this mix.

It is cool to go off the grid and play some lesser known songs but I think they went a bit too far down that road on this one. That's a minor quibble. Why in the heck is there no bottom end on any of their videos? I have a very good audio system and my subs were saying ""where's the bass?"" I Played the latest Crossroads Guitar Festival afterward and they said ""oh, there it is."" Live shows tend to have a very full sound with punchy bottom end.

5969889,4,B00F878KFM,"Bad news first as this bluray disappoints in a couple of key areas. First & foremost is the sound mix. Worst part of this is Geddy's voice is buried so deep in the mix as to be barely audible at times, truly bad especially in the first set & very disappointing after waiting for months to see this release. He sounds like he's in good voice but you can barely hear him. I can't think why the mix should be this poor. Also the editing is a little too frenetic for my taste, but not as bad as some. And as another reviewer notes the odd scene looks like it was taken with a std-def camera, very grainy.
  The good news is this was a visual feast of a Rush concert. The cool steam-punk stage, the light show, & the string section make this easily(excepting maybe Rio's awesome crowd) the most exiting of their concerts to date. I loved the set-list, with most of Clockwork Angels( their best album since Signals in my opinion) & a host of great songs we haven't heard from them in years(hurrah for the Analog Kid).
  It's a great concert but I have to knock at least one star off because of the audio.  4 hours of Rush can never be a bad thing.",1385078400,4,1141,4.191780821917808

If you noticed from the past few tours the band has toned down the energy level quite a bit. Geddy is horrifically out of tune on many tracks while attempting to hit those premium high notes, only now he's doing this in complete falsetto.

5969894,3,B00F878KFM,"What a great tour this was, having experienced it in Atlanta, RUSH never disappoints live and presents one of the highest value productions you'll ever see live, unfortunately, that can't be said for the production of this blu ray.  My biggest problem with it is the way it was shot.

While it is apparent that the format is HD, the look of the footage screams ENG (Electronic News Gathering).  The footage is too sharp and harsh.  Most likely shot on broadcast cameras, it just looks like it was produced before the advent of high end 24p HD cameras.
Andre Pienaar, the DP,  should have chosen his cameras (and lens) more carefully).  Not sure what cameras they used but they certainly weren't ARRI Alexa's, RED Epic's or even Sony's F55's which would have given the show a much more lush or cinematic ""film"" look.  I  also noticed there were no long lens shots, which I love, particularly tight profile shots racking to different members of the band.  Although Andre Pienaar may have not been given the choice.  Often the budget given for a project dictates the format and tools used (Producers and production manager's favorite word is ""No."" as they think about their bonus for staying under budget!), having said that, I doubt it.  RUSH's muti-media is always top notch, particularly the films produced for the rear screen projection during their shows, as well as the state of the art lighting, stage props and sound.  Spare no expense!  You get what you pay for and I'm positive RUSH get's it.  But someone dropped the ball on this one.  I'm being critical, however, I'm not implying it's unwatchable, it's RUSH after all, I enjoyed it, All I'm stressing is it could have LOOKED a lot better.

That's certainly what they did here.  One has to wonder if the band even listened to this sonic sludge before it went out.

Alex's guitar is way to strong in the left channel, Neal's drums are almost lost in the mix and have little clarity, and Geddy's vocals are often lost and unclear (his bass is distinguishable, but not in balance with Alex's guitar).

One assumes that they have individual tracks straight from the mixing board that should offer plenty of clarity and mixing options.  Instead, what we hear here sounds more like mic's scattered around the venue, picking up and retaining all the negative sonic issues found in any big arena.

With so many fine examples of quality live audio on DVD's & Blu-Rays, you'd think the producers would have higher standards.  Not the case here.",1384992000,22,892,4.753246753246753

I love the backstage footage and pre-show footage, and the filming of the audience at key Neil drum spots, Neil's smiling, Alex being funny, Geddy dancing. However, the AUDIO IS WAY UNDER-PAR for what RUSH is known for. Their studio recordings are crystal clear and their Snakes and Arrows DVD is the best current Live Sound DVD that they put out (other than Exit Stage Left). On this Clockwork DVD, you cannot hear the snare drum on Subdivisions(of all drum songs!) and the drums are overall too low! It seems like all you can hear is the room mics for his drums. The guitar sounds very clear, crisp and is loud throughout the DVD and this may finally get Alex the attention he deserves from non-believers (he's in my top three guitarists for style and tone). However, the guitar seems to be mixed in the left channel throughout the whole concert. Geddy's voice is too low, over compressed and could use some presence/treble for clarity. Geddy's bass tone is kind of apparent but is heard more in the Clockwork Angels set. Let's talk about the String Ensemble. I was so excited to see them at Jones Beach and loved their presence on the classics including Red Sector A and YYZ as well as the Clockwork Angels album. However, on the DVD, they were mixed way too low on YYZ for Alex's guitar riff. It was soo powerful to hear the strings supplement an already amazing song and the DVD mix put them too low. I don't know if they wanted to maintain their original sound without being too obtrusive by adding the strings (they own that word). I watched the DVD for the first time today and I will definitely watch it again because it's RUSH, but they should consider getting the person who mixed Snakes and Arrows Live to remix this DVD. They recently remixed Vapor Trails because they were unhappy with the former mix. I hope other fans agree that this mix is also not sitting right. It's just a pity that the sound suffers on this magnificent tour document with an excellent performance by all.

I think the sound was mixed poorly, Geddy really sounds like he's straining to reach the notes, and the interstitial videos are nowhere near funny or entertaining enough to merit their number or length.

But I have to give the band high marks for the set list:  several songs from early to mid-80's (from ""Signals"" through ""Hold Your Fire"") and enough of their other classics to satisfy.

The addition of string ensemble was interesting but ultimately just an unnecessary gimmick.  They looked like they were having a grand time but they didn't enhance the songs musically as much as I'd hoped.

Again, I guess you had to be there.

But I'm still grateful that the band is churning out concert DVDs with such regularity.  And they are probably the only band around who can pull it off with such energy and aplomb.",1384992000,5,938,4.608433734939759
5969906,4,B00F878KFM,"I love Rush. They're near the top of my very favorite bands and I own almost everything they've ever put out. Overall, this is a great concert but I do have a few observations about it:

1) The setlist is great
2) Alex is way too loud even though he's probably never played better than on here
3) The whole band is on fire throughout performance-wise however..
4) You can't hear the bass or drums very well and even the keyboards are much too quiet.

I give it 4 stars for the song selection, overall performance and how the video looks, and dock it a star for subpar mixing which is a shame because I've been looking forward to this dvd since it was announced.",1384992000,6,661,4.28
5969907,5,B00F878KFM,"Really confused about the folks who are giving this a low rating. I think the sound and video (at least on the blu-ray) is excellent; very HD at times.  One thing I did do though; I adjusted the EQ on my surround system to 'flat'.  I normally like a bass boost in the sound but it was a bit much for this blu-ray. After that adjustment, everything sounded great!.  I agree that Geddy's voice may be mixed a little lower than it was on past releases, but to be honest, his voice is the only weak aspect of the band at this point, & it helps to have it mixed into the music rather than sit on top of it. It's not inaudible, by any means, & don't we know the lyrics to these songs by now, anyway! :)

I also liked the editing. I think it's a good mix of modern concert video editing; some fast cuts but also plenty of long pauses & most of the 'money' shots are there when you wanna see that particular drum fill, bass lick, guitar solo, etc. If you wanna watch Neil the whole song, then you need to buy a ticket & bring some binoculars!

Very enjoyable.  A great representation of a great band.  Loved that the setlist didn't offer too many repeats that you find on other releases of theirs. Look for the hidden Alex 'joke'!",1384992000,4,1222,4.1525423728813555
5969908,2,B00F878KFM,"Having seen this tour live in Washington, I had high expectations for this release and was looking forward to receiving it. I've turned into a big rush fan over the past year (purchased 18 of their albums) but that being said, it doesn't' mean I'm going to skew my opinion in there favor and give them a good review undeservedly. When I played the first disc and heard the audio I was kind of hoping it was a joke. I don't know what happened whether it be the venue's design, the low level recording equipment, or mixing mismanagement but you can't hear Geddy Lee. The music is much stronger. And in my opinion the music itself was just OK sounding. Just because I was curious, I played the Time Machine Tour and it was miles ahead of the Clockwork Angels disc. I also agreed with a couple of the other reviewers when they said the camera movement was overboard, this is another aspect of the Time Machine tour that is much better. Not to pile on but the video is also substandard and very grainy. I don't really know who to blame but I would like to know who okayed this being released from Rush's camp. I really hate to say this, but I call them like I see them and this kind of feels like there (meaning Rush or Rush's management) is just trying to take advantage of their heightened fame and putting something out strictly to make money. If your going to do it, do it right. And when they saw the final product they should have said let's fix this and release at a later date or just scrap the project altogether. I'm going to be more hesitant next time I buy a tour DVD. Was looking forward to this for months. Agh!!  Oh and in case you read this, the first 25 reviews in the 5 star section for clockwork angels DVD/blue ray are from before the disc was even released. That's the only reason this thing has such a high rating, its being bumped up by excited fans giving glowing reviews prior to knowing the true nature of the disc.  I say this because people should have the truth and an average of 4 stars is not the truth.  This deserves a recall and an average of 2 maybe 2.5 at best.",1384905600,22,2092,4.26448362720403
5969909,5,B00F878KFM,"I've seen these guys on every tour, multiple times in some cases, since Counterparts and they never, ever cease to amaze. Someone asked me after returning from the last show on this past tour (Kansas City), ""how was the show?"" My reply was, ""better than the last time I saw them, but not better than the next time"".  I'm almost ashamed to admit this, but listening to their music live and watching live DVDs gives me goosebumps and sometimes my eyes well up, I have no idea why it happens, but it does. The music hits deep, deep in my soul and is truly amazing. Watching this DVD now, and although I saw 4 shows on this tour it feels fresh and alive.

To make things worse, the sound is terrible.  I could get by with bad video, but the sound too.  I went to see this at the cinema, and the video was out of focus, in focus, cut away during solos, lights in the eye of the camera, backs of peoples heads.  I thought well maybe it will be better on my home theatre.  That is when I noticed the sound, immediately!  The three best musicians in the world, and you can't hear the drums, the bass is muffled, and the guitar sounds if it was tuned a step up.  Please Rush, please find someone that knows what their doing!  My video and sound from the concerts are way better than this.  I don't know who or what the problem is but do something. Watch Joe Bonamassa's new DVD @ Royal Albert Hall and call the people who done his work.  Even easier call the ""Caveman"". He'll get it right.

5969913,4,B00F878KFM,"Given the last two live video releases from the band, I was surprised to see this one shot at 60fps instead of 24.  The overall feel comes off much more like the ""Grace Under Pressure tour"" video release, and not just because of the 80's-heavy set list.  The opening and intermission videos are simply shown from the audience perspective instead of being integrated into the presentation (though you can watch them as extras).  There's occasional random off-stage shots of the band members, including a quick one of Geddy Lee relaxing during one of the drum solos.  Some of the shots remind you of bootleg concert videos, in fact, a few shots are shot behind concert goers who themselves are shooting video from their camera phones.

All of this gives kind of a refreshing raw live feel to the video.  Going this route, I would have liked to have heard the music sound less polished than it does.  One of the first things we hear is the opening guitar riff from ""Limelight"" during the sound check, and it sounds EXACTLY as guitar riffs do live, and I found myself hoping the whole show would sound that raw.  Alas, everything is cleaned up and nicely mixed (a little too flat, maybe) as all professional live releases are.  There's GOT to be a better way to capture that raw, unpolished sound for home releases.  Give us the real crowd noise.  Give us the imperfections.

Still, another nice release from Rush, and a must-have souvenir for those of us who were in attendance on this tour.",1384905600,,1488,4.637404580152672

What a band to give the fans everything and more.... Specially if you maybe wanted Middletown Dreams instead of Grand Designs etc..Here you get every setlist they did! (are you listening Dave Matthews?????)

Been a fan for 36 years...seen them 20 plus times.....

The lighting, video editing, and sound are stellar... nothing tops this!

For me The Wreckers and The Garden gave me chills, yes that's right!  You heard it from me!  The composition, sound, tightness of that string section is SICK! in the best kind of way!!!!

This is not your average show (by average they blow any rock band out of the water live providing a 3 hour show) ....

Some might say maybe include Closer to the Heart, Freewill, maybe a few Presto tunes etc to round it out... but his is a SOLID set!

Buy it!  Worship it!  Kiss it!  as of 2013 nothing comes close to this as they best BLURAY concert EVER released!!!!",1384819200,2,1006,4.610169491525424
5969917,5,B00F878KFM,"3+ hours of flawless execution. I was blown away when I saw the show in Atlantic City and thought this is one of the best concerts ever. After seeing it again on blu-ray, I'm convinced of its greatness. I read that Geddy said he was in the best shape of his life during this tour and it shows in his vocal performance. He sounds better here than on R30 and way better than Time Machine. The new album is one of the best imho and with the exception of BU2B, played in its entirety. The string ensemble really works. The first setlist is a solid collection and includes all of the songs from the 2012 and 2013 tour (a few of the songs were alternated). I could do without Territories and would rather they slipped in Chemistry after Analog Kid. The band said they will not do a 40 anniversary tour.

5969918,5,B00F878KFM,"Rush has produced another fantastic video of their live shows. Clockwork Angels, presented in Blu-Ray, is magnificent. First off, the 5.1 audio mix is crisp and clear. When pumped through a home theater system, the sound quality is as good as any I have heard before. And the band themselves sound positively rejuvenated - Geddy's piercing vocals, Alex's slashing guitar, and Neil's pounding drums; they each sound inspired and youthful. Pretty impressive for a band of their generation.

The video quality is absolutely beautiful, and highly intertwined: cameras are positioned throughout the stage, the crowd, even on Neil's drum kit. And it is all cut together seamlessly for a highly compelling show. I also really enjoyed the interspersed segments from before the show, they add a very authentic and ""cozy"" feeling to the set.

5969919,5,B00F878KFM,"Rush once again delivers a top notch performance. The 5.1 mix is well balanced and clear.  They've come a long way since the atrocious mix of Rush In Rio.  This production has a bit of a different feel than previous Rush concerts.  We're presented with pre-show scenes the likes of which we haven't seen since the Exit Stage Left DVD, and they're mixed in throughout the show, up to Neil's big exit at the end.

The entire Dallas setlist is included here, however Rush alternated severel songs on alternate nights. Those alternates are offered in the supplementary section of the disc. I only have two small complaints about this: the songs aren't mixed in 5.1 and it would have been nice if they were edited into the main show.",1384819200,2,728,4.62015503875969

Probably my biggest complaint is with the camera work and editing for the video.  Too many moving and low quality shots - and too many cuts between shots.  I got the impression they were really trying to make it dynamic, and it just has the feeling it is trying too hard.

Aside from the video work - I thought the band sounded pretty good.  I do enjoy the Clockwork Angels album, but this point I am still inclined to listen to it, rather than watch it.

Update: 2014 January  - OK I finally sat down and watched this again. The other reviewers are right.  The Audio is HORRIBLE!  Sorry to say, I was hoping for more.",1384819200,4,748,4.2785714285714285

5969927,5,B00F878KFM,"Wow, so many reviews of this already, I almost feel a little out of place doing a write-up now that I have seen the entire DVD (I got mine a day early, thank my lucky stars).

Set One was awesome, as I expected. I admit, beforehand when I saw the setlist I was a little skeptical about some of the rarely played songs from ""Power Windows"" but all that went away when I actually saw them performed. Grand Designs and Territories rocked and the extra from Disc 2, Middletown Dreams was also very good.

Subdivisions is my favorite Rush song so it's always welcome in the live set & The Analog Kid really did move me. Still trying to decide which ""The Big Money"" I like better, this one or the one from Rush in Rio. And I love when Rush pulls something rare out, in this case ""The Body Electric"" which puts the studio version to shame.

Set Two is where the band experiments by having a string ensemble accompany them on the stage & I guess not everyone will be wowed by it, but it's hard to imagine some of the new material from ""Clockwork Angels"" without them, particularly a song like ""The Garden.""

If I had to quibble with the string section for anything, it might be that they get a little too loud during Alex's solo on Dreamline, but they are fantastic during Red Sector A, YYZ and Manhattan Project, so overall I would say the string section did nothing to take away from Geddy, Alex and Neil.

Of course it will be interesting to see what Rush does with the Clockwork Angels material on their next tour & here I am thinking way too far ahead when Rush just wrapped up Clockwork Angels & just blessed us fans with this terrific DVD.

I'll just wrap this by saying Rush definitely delivers the goods with this concert. Not quite as great as ""Snakes and Arrows"" but definitely a step up from ""Time Machine Tour.""

5969932,4,B00F878KFM,"Although it has not yet been released, RUSH: The Clockwork Angels Tour, looks to be a great live recording. I am basing my opinions off of a few things, the first being having seen this show live twice, the others being the trailer's for this show and the sneak peak videos of ""The Garden"" and ""2112"". I thought the concert live was absolutely spectacular. Great lights, sound, song selection, visuals, etc ... the only downside could have been Geddy's vocals, but you have to give the man a break. He is 60 years old, he may not sound all too great but the effort is there. The trailers and sneak peaks for this DVD/BluRay look to be filmed twenty times better than the previous ""Time Machine: Live in Cleveland"" DVD/BluRay. I myself found ""Time Machine"" to lack dynamics in the sound, and the great visuals of the show were not filmed as well as could have been. It was full of close up shots of guitars, and overhead shots of Neil. This time it looks as if the filmmakers knew there was more to capture than just the band members. A large crane was used to film a lot of full stage shots to get the amazing light show that RUSH puts on, the close ups are not shoved in your face, and the editing seems to flow with the music. The sound also seems great. The drums do not sound muffled or flat, the guitars and vocals sound crisp, the bass doesn't overpower, and the strings fit in very nicely.

I've seen KISS, Joe Bonamassa and I can tell you that I have never seen a better show than Rush, Clockwork Angels. No opening act, just 2.5 hours of magic. They opened with Subdivisions and played a lot of their earlier music before going into the greater part of Clockwork Angels. The best part of this show was the chemistry of the band. They were smiling and laughing as they performed, three friends from way back. Some bands just get out there and go through the motions. Another day, another city. But Geddy, Alex and Neil are still having fun and enjoying what they do. And boy, did it show. The musicianship was phenomenal. Neil was Neil and the drum kit he used was the same one from the previous Time Machine tour. He claims it's the best kit he's ever used so he brought it out again and used it as only he can. Geddy is just nuts on his bass, a modified Fender Jazz. I think he's one of the very best on this instrument. Alex went back to his Gibson ES-335 for most of the songs and he hasn't lost any of his ability. They were wearing everyday clothes that anyone else would wear, plaid shirt, t shirt, jeans, converse all-stars. Again, just three friends doing what they do best. But the performance was only one facet of this event. The stage was full of steam-punk gizmos, giving it a slightly industrial look. Three massive screens, displayed the boys from various angles all through the show in hi-def. This was interspersed with video of the futuristic world that is the setting for Clockwork Angels. I wished I had two set of eyes so I could watch both! I kept switching back and forth afraid I would miss something...The sound was clear and loud, but not too loud. No distortion at all. KISS was so loud I swear my ears were bleeding, but this was just right. I honestly can't think of a single negative thing about the show. As soon as I left I was praying that this would be on DVD and I'm beyond excited that it is coming out. If you are a Rush fan, this will be absolutely critical to your collection.

==========FOLLOW UP / UPDATE=============

I received the Blu Ray. I DOWNGRADED TO 1 STAR. But hey, the performances are GREAT!!! The sound quality is simply horrible. The more expensive your home theater is, the worst this audio becomes. If you have a consumer-grade home theater receiver, crank this audio up and you'll be a happy camper. If you, like myself, have an expensive ($100K-$300K) system, this blu ray will sound like GARBAGE. Why? Because the audio IS garbage.

Long gone are the days when dynamics and crystal clear audio were produced. Now all you get is loudness wars and compression, compression, compression. I don't know how Neil Peart allows people to RUIN his drum sounds like this. Granted, his TAMA and Ludwig drum kits of the past sounded much better than this horrible, muddy DW setup he has been endorsing -- for reasons only God knows. Cymbals are non-existent as part of the band's sound. All you hear is compressed shimmer half a second after he hits the cymbals.

It's very unfortunate that the lack of knowledge, by newer generations, of what Hi-Fidelity sound means, allows this kind of poor audio quality to be accepted as ""normal"". If you like MUD, this is the sound you want.

Forget clarity, crispness and dynamics. Same goes to Dream Theater BTW. Their audio quality is also ruined by young sound engineers and mixing 'engineers' that have no clue about what they're doing and think that ""if it's digital, it's perfect"". A pure shame.",1380153600,9,1786,4.816993464052287
5969942,1,B00F878KFM,"Yeah...a review from now....release day...some one that has actually heard and seen this!

Go ahead. Flame away fan boys. But what is arguably the greatest 3 piece rock and roll band of all time has once again allowed the sound engineering mix of Rich Chycki completely ruin what should be an absolutely fantastic show. Why oh why do musicians of this caliber allow this to happen over and over again?

I have roughly 30k invested into sound and video in my Home Theater. I have 100's of Blu Ray concerts. (Not to mention older DVD's) I know what good mixes sound like. This is not one of them! The stereo mix is fine at times but without question the 5.1 DTS HD is without a doubt abysmal at best. The low end thump is blown beyond the nth degree. I have 4 - 1000 watt+ 15"" subs in my theater and had I not had the remote in my hand to turn it down quickly they'd all have been blown! Even toned down completely it's still an embarrassment how bad it sounds.

Peart's drums get lost in the noise. And the strings? Are you kidding me? What's the point? Except to see them on stage you'd hardly know they were there. I could go on but apparently not enough people care about good sound any more. Every one will lap it up and tell you it's the greatest thing ever. Shame.

Great show. Great playing. I love them. Spent thousands...no tens of thousands over the years touring and seeing them. I've spent epic weeks long journeys on my bike seeing them multiple times in a row. I go back to Hemispheres live on every tour. 40 some odd shows now. But this Blu Ray is a complete let down. However not unexpected as their last few releases have been disappointments audio wise.

Rush! O PLEASE Rush! Find a REAL Audio engineer!

OK...love em any ways. But the audio is just completely unacceptable. Bummer dude. Hope they change in the future.

Blah blah blah...

EDITED 12/11...I'm going to revise this a bit.

This was on Paladia last night and I tuned it in for experiment sake. As I don't have the DVD only the Blu Ray version so I do not have access to the plain vanilla Dolby Digital DTS...only the DTS-HD. Satellite is incapable of even remotely transmitting enough bandwidth to support 5.1 DTS-HD and there's only optical out for 5.1 so by default I get the plain 5.1 Dolby Digital version with Dish Network.

Even though I've been one of the most vocal bashers of this sound I honestly I have to say that the plain 5.1 DTS is better than the DTS-HD. The difference was night and day. Everything I have heard, seen and read points towards that. All of the glowing reviews are coming from folks that either have the DVD and therefore only the plain 5.1 DD/DTS version...or from people listening to the Blu Ray 5.1 DTS-HD that do not have the capability of hearing / reproducing the full spectrum.

While listening to the plain old 5.1 Dolby Digital version last night via satellite it was clearly evident in the same songs and passages where the crap sound lies with the 5.1 HD that the plain 5.1 DD was either better mixed / engineered or just unable to handle the full spectrum of sound. But again this comes back to a shoddy engineered / mixing job and sub par standards. Especially for Rush. The same thing is evident with the 2.0 stereo mix.

So the bottom line seems to be this. If you have an average sound system and buy the DVD or can only reproduce / hear 5.1 DD/DTS or 2.0 than yeah, this probably sounds pretty good.

However...if you have a high end system capable of reproducing reference / full spectrum sound sound then I stick by my original statement. The 5.1 DTS-HD is garbage.

And one other tid bit. I've been so focused on sound I didn't even bother with the video quality. It's poor, overly saturated and the never ending cut / pan / zoom / change angles....ARGH! Just try and count 3 seconds between shots. You'll be lucky to get 2.",1379980800,35,3856,4.412676056338028
5969943,2,B00F878KFM,"After the horrible mix of time machine DVD where they stupidly mixed Neil's drums low in the mix to create a flat sounding non dynamic presentation. They must get thier act together and produce a quality audio production on this DVD. Snakes and Arrows atleast had some dynamics, air, space and detail with a proper mix of Neil's drums that  gave one some hints at true dynamics.

Rush has been plaqued by awful sound quality, and poor production as evidenced by all of their recent studio works. Vapor trails is considered the worst sounding studio record of all time, with compressed blaring sound  and computer edited lifeless shaped noise that renders  one of the most talented rock bands unlistenable. Clockwork angles, released last year, continued with that "" wall of sound"" quality  that left Neil's drums sounding like pitter patter, distant and  non dynamic compressed garbage, unlistenable on a real hifi system.",1379894400,10,922,5.032894736842105
5969944,3,B00F878KFM,"The HUGE problem that I have with this video is that whoever edited the video  doesn't allow the viewer to absorb any single scene due to rapid editing. Not many shots of anything during the entire video lasts over 5 seconds. Most are 3 seconds long.... many many of them are 2 seconds, count them out yourself. The only shots of longer times are from a distance so you can get a sense of what the staging was like but those are only about 8 secongs long. And there aren't all that many.
The fast-editing ruins this video for me. Wish this video was like the Time Machine Tour.
But it's great for the performance, music-wise. My audio sounds fine, unlike some who apparently have audio gripes.

What bands should do is offer some fans a chance to view the video BEFORE it is released so they can get helpful feedback about things that suck.

This was an absolutely stunning performance by an amazing band. Very creative production and set. The inclusion of a small orchestra was outstanding.
The high-definition screen was stunning (and all of the smaller ones floating around the stage). It'll be fantastic to be able to see it again.",1379894400,5,1135,4.58128078817734

5969948,5,B00F878KFM,I saw them on 11/19/12 in LA at the Gibson. I was so excited to see the show. My 1st show was at a club called Tuesday's in San Diego CA in 1976. They were on the bill with Rory Gallagher and the way Geddy was singing we had to get closer to see if he was a man or a woman. I've been a fan ever since. They just keep getting better and better.  I feel so honored to have been there from the start and no matter what I will always LOVE them. Go Canada,1379376000,12,450,3.6391752577319587

Everything I love about the band is here, the inside quirks, the powerful yet playful stage presence, and the big screen animation, all of which contributed to make a Rush concert the unique experience that it truly was.
