I think THE THREE CABALLEROS is a great classic of the genre. . . a kind of Latin American FANTASIA that takes animation to the outermost limits of possibility -- but I want the movie in its original form, not in some altered, edited, Politically Correct modern dumbed-down version. There's nothing on the box or in the studio marketing that tells me which version I would be getting in this release. Can someone help me out? Should I Buy or Boycott?

3095971,4,B0012RLXBU,"For Disney historians and enthusiasts classic Disney films such as Sauludos Amigos and The Three Caballeros are a piece of Disney Feature Animation history. Both films were nominated for Academy Awards. However, to most of the younger generation The Three Caballeros is the center piece of the renovated Mexico pavilion attraction at Walt Disney World's Epcot. Now with the release The Classic Caballeros Collection: Saludos Amigos / The Three Caballeros that is about to change. For the first time both animated features are available together in the two DVD set. The Cinco de Mayo adventure begins as the Disney Studio team embarks on a journey to South America and Mexico with Donald, Goofy and Walt Disney himself in this animated and live-action collection.

The first piece in this adventure is Sauludos Amigos. In this Disney film Walt and his team of artists, musicians, writers and animators say ""Adios!"" to the U.S. to explore the heart and soul of Latin America. From the Bolivian Andes to the Argentine pampas, watch these four whimsical animated escapades while they travel to fun and exciting places. This enchanting international adventure earned three Academy Award nominations in 1943 including Best Musical Score, Best Sound and Best Original Song. Sauludos Amigos in divided into individual shorts highlighting different characteristics of South and Central America cultural. The first short features Donald Duck as a tourist at Lake Titicaca. Of course it wouldn't be a Donald Duck film without the customary troubles that follow this zany duck. The second short introduces us to a small plane name Pedro who must brave a thunder storm to deliver the mail in Santiago, Chile. After Pedro delivers the mail we venture to Argentina as the lovable Goofy portrays an American cowboy. Finally we set our sights on Brazil as Donald and his new friend Jose the parrot discover the culture and sounds of the region.

Interspersed with the animation shorts we go behind the scenes with Walt Disney and the animators as they crate this superb piece of celluloid (Disney also provides a South of The Border documentary in their backstage Section of the DVD)

We meet up with Donald's and his friends Joe Carioca and Panchito in The Three Caballeros. With lighthearted dance and lively music, this dazzling blend of live action and classic Disney animation is a celebration the whole family will enjoy! The film received two Academy Award nominations for Best Musical Score and Best Sound Recording.

The film opens with Donald receiving a huge birthday package from his Latin American friends. Things get interesting as Donald is introduced to the South American culture... During one of the final pieces of the film we are introduced to the films name sakes as Donald, Jose, and Panchito (a gun toting rooster) dance and sing in with the people of Mexico.

All in all this the Classic Caballeros collection sets out to do exactly what it is supposed to: entertain and introduce another generation to the history brilliant Disney Feature Animation.

A Side by side comparison does show some slight improvement in picture sharpness, and the audio has been re-mixed for surround sound, but it is not a full restoration.  Obviously this is a great price, and hard to pass up if you do not already own these.

3095973,5,B0012RLXBU,"Wow, wow, and triple wow. It is not often that I get excited over animation anymore, but these 40+ year old films took my breath away. This DVD set contains ""Saludos Amigos"" (1943) and its follow-up, ""The Three Caballeros"" (1945). A team of Disney animators visited Latin America and collected a wealth of film, photos, sketches, paintings, mementoes, and ideas that reflected the culture they soaked up. In ""Saludos Amigos,"" there is plenty of 16mm footage documenting the trip, interspersed with 4 animated segments: ""Lake Titicaca"" starring Donald Duck. ""Pedro,"" an ADORABLE baby airplane, ""El Gaucho Goofy"" starring Goofy (and to answer the ""burning"" question, there is no cigarette visible here), and my VERY favorite, ""Aquarela do Brasil"" (Watercolor of Brazil""). This finale could easily have been used in ""Fantasia."" It is a marvel of animation, color, and music. It is absolutely breathtaking. It is inspiring to see what this team was able to create together. Released two years later, ""The Three Caballeros"" stars Donald Duck, Jos Carioca (from Brazil), and Panchito Pistoles (from Mexico). Imagine Walt Disney, Salvador Dali, and Busby Berkeley mixed together, and this film would be the result. The mixing of live-action and animation is pure brilliance. The segment ""Las Posadas"" is particularly beautiful, and I would have to guess the visuals owe much to Mary Blair. The color in both films is glowing and lush, looking as if it were just filmed yesterday. Extras include 2 Donald Duck shorts, ""Don Donald"" (1937) & ""Contrary Condor"" (1944). ""Don Donald"" shows Donald in his early days, before the styling of Disney animation became just a tad too slick. Both cartoons are very enjoyable. Other extras include a short Walt Disney CBC Interview where Walt discusses the birth of the 2 Latin American films presented here, and ""South of the Border,"" which includes much of the 16mm film shot by the Disney team while in South America. Although the quality is not as glowing as what made its way into the feature, it is still extremely interesting to watch. The usual Disney sneak previews can be found on this disc as well.

HIGHLY recommended; beautiful animation, and a wonderful peak into the Latin American culture of the 40's.",1208736000,14,2245,5.0675675675675675

3095975,4,B0012RLXBU,"My husband loves the animated finale of ""The Three Caballeros"" so much he says nothing else here matters, and rates this, ahem, unique Disney collection 5 stars. I, on the other hand, rate it 3. Sure, the surreal stuff is creative, but the live-action material is so lame! And besides, I want a story! The 4 stars above are our compromise. (Our teenage daughter, by the way, sides more with her father.)

So here's my review, a mix of all of our opinions.

SALUDOS AMIGOS

""Saludos Amigos"" is a 42-minute South American travelogue. Produced in 1942 with limited wartime resources, it uses live-action scenes to link together four cartoons.

The live-action segments show Walt Disney and a team of Disney artists as they travel to the continent and then gather information and sketch cartoon ideas. Poorly composed, badly faded and politically out of date, the footage has the look of an old home movie, as well as an obviously overdubbed soundtrack. My husband, however, geezer-in-training that he is, likes these scenes for their historical value, as they are filled with propeller-driven airliners, 1930s automobiles and lots of women in big, flowing dresses.

As for the cartoons, my whole family agrees that they are some of Disney's best.

""Lake Titicaca"" stars Donald Duck as a tourist, getting into trouble as he attempts to sail a boat, take photos, communicate with the locals and ride a llama across a suspension bridge.

""Pedro"" tells the story of a cute ""little boy plane"" who dreams of carrying the mail between Chile and Argentina. A compelling story full of fun and drama, it holds up amazingly well, and looks like it could have been drawn yesterday.

The hilarious ""El Gaucho Goofy,"" is in the same vein as the 1950s Goofy ""How-To"" cartoons. As the narrator blindly describes how Goofy ""deftly tosses"" a lasso around a horse, ""quickly converts"" his saddle into a bed and ""gracefully"" dines on barbecue, the dippy dog botches every step. (If you buy this DVD, watch for these scene transitions. The lasso segment literally gets pushed off screen by the saddle scene, which itself ends by rolling up like a window shade. When the barbecue segment wipes off at an angle, Goofy nearly falls out of it!)

Finally, much like a tropical version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantasia/dp/B00003CX9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Fantasia,""</a>&nbsp;the terrific ""Aquarela do Brasil"" (""Watercolor of Brazil"") starts off as a painting of a vibrant rainforest that comes to life to music, in this case a great version of the samba standard ""Tico Tico No Fub."" Soon Donald appears, meets Brazilian playboy parrot Jos Carioca (a Disney version of a Brazilian folk character), and the duo shake their bonbons off into the nightlife of Rio. Much of Jose's dialogue is in Portuguese.

THE THREE CABALLEROS

The most bizarre movie the Walt Disney company has ever produced, 1945's ""The Three Caballeros"" is a collection of animated shorts, all tied together by a bare-bones plot of Donald Duck learning about Latin America. The cartoons progress from typically sweet Disney family fare to a truly psychedelic, adult-oriented swingin'-single travelogue that turns Donald into a libidinous wolf.

It begins as Donald Duck, sitting alone in a room, receives a big box filled with birthday presents ""from his friends in Latin America."" First up are a few cartoons about some unusual animals of South America -- ""The Cold Blooded Penguin,"" ""A Visit With More Rare Birds"" (rainforest birds) and ""The Story of The Flying Gauchito"" (a flying donkey). These three shorts take up the first 22 minutes of the film.

Next out of the box are two pop-up books about Brazil and Mexico. Each of these comes to life as its own peyote-paced animated featurette.

First, the cigar-chomping Jos Carioca pops out of the Brazil book and takes Donald on a 19-minute trip to the town of Baia (today's Salvador). As a catchy rhythm builds, Carioca creates his own harmony by dividing into four identical versions of himself, male, then female.

Eventually the birds meet the Cookie Lady (a live-action singer who attracts men with her baked goods) and soon the whole thing turns into what perhaps can best be described as a samba-fueled cookie version of the Marilyn Monroe production number, ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend.""

Donald gets jealous and pursues the Cookie Lady through the village -- which is, all along, a live-action stage set meant to be a huge pop-up-book page. For the finale, the Cookie Lady turns blue, two of her live-action suitors turn into fighting gamecocks and soon everyone and everything -- including the buildings, the moon, the waves in the sea -- dances into the night.

The book about Mexico brings forth Panchito, a six-gun-shooting cowboy rooster. He tosses sombreros to his new feathered friends, proclaims the trio ""three gay caballeros"" and takes Donald and Jos on a 30-minute flying-serape tour of his country.

On Acapulco Beach, Donald goes ga-ga for dozens of live-action bathing beauties (""Come to Papa! Come here, my little enchilada!"") and keeps losing his swimming suit. At night the duck can't stay away from the clubs, where he dances with still more real-life seoritas.

The movie's bizarre animation includes illogical color changes and an overdose of morphing gags. Donald himself assumes over a hundred shapes and color patterns, and once becomes a woman. Some scenes, however, are beautiful Mary Blair gems that would later inspire the films ""Cinderella"" and ""Alice in Wonderland,"" as well as the classic Disney attraction It's a Small World.

Sound great? My husband sure thinks so, and though I love the Mary Blair art, all the surreal animation and dated live-action blending don't exactly float my boat, and, well, I like my movies with a story! Still, some people have always found ""The Three Caballeros"" irresistibly entertaining, and it is certainly a must for any animation fan, as it shows the Disney animation team at its free-for-all zenith.

The two movies were produced as part of the U.S. government's Good Neighbor Policy, an effort to promote pro-American feelings (and combat Nazi sympathies) in Latin America during World War II.

BONUS FEATURES

Extras on the DVD include two good Donald Duck cartoons. In 1937's ""Don Donald"" (also on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronological-Donald-Vol-1/dp/B0000BWVAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronological Donald Vol. 1</a>), a flirtatious Daisy Duck (here named ""Donna"") gets trapped in the rumble seat of Donald's car as it bounces through the Mexican desert. In 1944's ""Contrary Condor"" (also on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronological-Donald-Vol-2/dp/B000ATQYU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronological Donald Vol. 2</a>), Donald finds himself hatching out of a condor egg and dealing with an overprotective mother.

Also included is 1942's ""South Of The Border With Disney,"" a 30-minute behind-the-scenes documentary. It shows Disney artists, including Mary Blair, in South America getting inspiration for the animated sequences in these films. It was also on the year-2000 DVD release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saludos-Amigos/dp/B00004R997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saludos Amigos.</a>

3095989,3,B0012RLXBU,"The two films on this DVD, Saludos Amigos and The Three Caballeros, consist of both animated shorts and live action segments that show off South American and Latin American culture.

The first film, Saludos Amigos, does not have much of a story but is introduced with Disney animators travelling to South America to do research for the movie. Along the way, Donald Duck meets the Brazilian parrot Jos Carioca.

The second film, The Three Caballeros, expands on the first film with its South American adventures and also travels to Latin America. In this film, it is Donald Duck's birthday and he receives gifts from his friends in other countries. He and Jos meet the Mexican rooster Panchito Pistoles.

I thought both films were a rather mixed bag. One of the strengths of most Disney films is their timeless appeal which, unfortunately, is not the case with these two movies. The live action segments are quite a dated aspect of the movies as we get to see these countries as they were back in the 1940s. While adult Disney enthusiasts might like the historical value of this, I find it difficult to see children being able to sit through it. Also, the films are at times rather nonsensical. Especially by the ending, The Three Caballeros has completely collapsed into a surreal mess.

In conclusion, this is a rather interesting piece in Disney animation history, although it is more notable for its historical value rather than entertainment value.",1418947200,,1452,4.890243902439025

There's still plenty of smoking in these two cute little movies, especially by Jos Carioca the Brazilian parrot, as well as a surfeit of skirt-chasing (gasp!), heedless carbon use (the horror!), meat-eating and booze-swilling (shudder), Warner-worthy cartoon violence (won't somebody think of the children?), and other unfashionable antics that escaped the censor's knife.

3096038,5,B0012RLXBU,"It is a very good idea to put these two films into a single DVD. ""Saludos Amigos"" was an initial effort of Disney to honor the Latin American nations in the wake of Roosevelt's ""Good Neighbor"" policy, and during World War II when the United States was trying to gain the sympathy and support of the American nations against the Axis powers. ""Saludos Amigos"" was a fairly good film, but was surpassed by its sequel, ""The Three Caballeros."" This film centers on a tour of parts of Latin America through the eyes of animated cartoon bird characters, principally Donald Duck of the United States, Jose Carioca of Brazil (a parrot), and Pancho Gonzales of Mexico (a pistol-packing rooster). Though the cultures are presented in a very simple way, we are given a terrific cafeteria of places and stories from Latin America, and though a bit corny, these glimpses of the cultures are both accurate and engaging. The principal vignettes are of the pampas of Uruguay and the gaucho culture, which really speaks also for Argentina; the sultry colonial beauty of Bahia in northeast Brazil; and various typical regions of Mexico. With each location we are treated to some of the most unforgettable folk dances and lovely traditional songs, featuring Brazilian singer Aurora Miranda, sister of the more famous Carmen Miranda, and Mexican Dora Luz singing Agustin Lara's great popular song, ""Solamente una Vez,"" in English as ""You Belong to My Heart."" Then there is the Mexican folklorist, Carmen Molina, who performs several traditional Mexican dances including a fragment of ""Zandunga"" in the spectacular lace headdress of the women of southern Mexico, and a most charming original dance to the great Mexican revolutionary song ""Jesusita en Chihuahua"" while wearing a most fetching feminine version of the Mexican national dress-up cowboy costume, the charro. Amidst all the glorious song and dance in ""The Three Caballeros,"" the recurrent main theme is the surging mariachi song ""Jalisco no te rajes,"" which means something like, ""Jalisco (a very traditional state in western Mexico headed by Guadalajara) don't let anyone put you down!"" Prior to digitally enabled film production,the combination of animated characters with real world photography was not very common. In these films it is quite effective. Sometimes the animated fantasy sequences are a little over the top and Donald Duck may not be to everyone's taste, but at least he makes an effective foil to all the gorgeous Latin American sight and sound. ""Saludos Amigos"" is a nice appetizer before the main feast of ""The Three Caballeros,"" a basically simple film which nevertheless strikes a universal chord and fully deserves five stars. I don't enjoy seeing many films several times over, but I never tire of ""The Three Caballeros.  """,1317427200,2,2786,5.109649122807017

Both films were nominated for Academy Awards. However, to most of the younger generation The Three Caballeros is the center piece of the renovated Mexico pavilion attraction at Walt Disney World's Epcot. Now with the release The Classic Caballeros Collection: Saludos Amigos / The Three Caballeros that is about to change. For the first time both animated features are available together in the two DVD set. The Cinco de Mayo adventure begins as the Disney Studio team embarks on a journey to South America and Mexico with Donald, Goofy and Walt Disney himself in this animated and live-action collection.

The first piece in this adventure is Sauludos Amigos. In this Disney film Walt and his team of artists, musicians, writers and animators say ""Adios!"" to the U.S. to explore the heart and soul of Latin America. From the Bolivian Andes to the Argentine pampas, watch these four whimsical animated escapades while they travel to fun and exciting places. This enchanting international adventure earned three Academy Award nominations in 1943 including Best Musical Score, Best Sound and Best Original Song. Sauludos Amigos in divided into individual shorts highlighting different characteristics of South and Central America cultural. The first short features Donald Duck as a tourist at Lake Titicaca. Of course it wouldn't be a Donald Duck film without the customary troubles that follow this zany duck. The second short introduces us to a small plane name Pedro who must brave a thunder storm to deliver the mail in Santiago, Chile. After Pedro delivers the mail we venture to Argentina as the lovable Goofy portrays an American cowboy. Finally we set our sights on Brazil as Donald and his new friend Jose the parrot discover the culture and sounds of the region.

Interspersed with the animation shorts we go behind the scenes with Walt Disney and the animators as they crate this superb piece of celluloid (Disney also provides a South of The Border documentary in their backstage Section of the DVD)

We meet up with Donald's and his friends Joe Carioca and Panchito in The Three Caballeros. With lighthearted dance and lively music, this dazzling blend of live action and classic Disney animation is a celebration the whole family will enjoy! The film received two Academy Award nominations for Best Musical Score and Best Sound Recording.

The film opens with Donald receiving a huge birthday package from his Latin American friends. Things get interesting as Donald is introduced to the South American culture... During one of the final pieces of the film we are introduced to the films name sakes as Donald, Jose, and Panchito (a gun toting rooster) dance and sing in with the people of Mexico.

All in all this the Classic Caballeros collection sets out to do exactly what it is supposed to: entertain and introduce another generation to the history brilliant Disney Feature Animation.

This DVD set contains ""Saludos Amigos"" (1943) and its follow-up, ""The Three Caballeros"" (1945). A team of Disney animators visited Latin America and collected a wealth of film, photos, sketches, paintings, mementoes, and ideas that reflected the culture they soaked up. In ""Saludos Amigos,"" there is plenty of 16mm footage documenting the trip, interspersed with 4 animated segments: ""Lake Titicaca"" starring Donald Duck. ""Pedro,"" an ADORABLE baby airplane, ""El Gaucho Goofy"" starring Goofy (and to answer the ""burning"" question, there is no cigarette visible here), and my VERY favorite, ""Aquarela do Brasil"" (Watercolor of Brazil""). This finale could easily have been used in ""Fantasia."" It is a marvel of animation, color, and music. It is absolutely breathtaking. It is inspiring to see what this team was able to create together. Released two years later, ""The Three Caballeros"" stars Donald Duck, Jos Carioca (from Brazil), and Panchito Pistoles (from Mexico). Imagine Walt Disney, Salvador Dali, and Busby Berkeley mixed together, and this film would be the result. The mixing of live-action and animation is pure brilliance. The segment ""Las Posadas"" is particularly beautiful, and I would have to guess the visuals owe much to Mary Blair. The color in both films is glowing and lush, looking as if it were just filmed yesterday. Extras include 2 Donald Duck shorts, ""Don Donald"" (1937) & ""Contrary Condor"" (1944). ""Don Donald"" shows Donald in his early days, before the styling of Disney animation became just a tad too slick. Both cartoons are very enjoyable. Other extras include a short Walt Disney CBC Interview where Walt discusses the birth of the 2 Latin American films presented here, and ""South of the Border,"" which includes much of the 16mm film shot by the Disney team while in South America.

I, on the other hand, rate it 3. Sure, the surreal stuff is creative, but the live-action material is so lame! And besides, I want a story! The 4 stars above are our compromise. (Our teenage daughter, by the way, sides more with her father.)

So here's my review, a mix of all of our opinions.

SALUDOS AMIGOS

""Saludos Amigos"" is a 42-minute South American travelogue. Produced in 1942 with limited wartime resources, it uses live-action scenes to link together four cartoons.

The live-action segments show Walt Disney and a team of Disney artists as they travel to the continent and then gather information and sketch cartoon ideas. Poorly composed, badly faded and politically out of date, the footage has the look of an old home movie, as well as an obviously overdubbed soundtrack. My husband, however, geezer-in-training that he is, likes these scenes for their historical value, as they are filled with propeller-driven airliners, 1930s automobiles and lots of women in big, flowing dresses.

As for the cartoons, my whole family agrees that they are some of Disney's best.

""Lake Titicaca"" stars Donald Duck as a tourist, getting into trouble as he attempts to sail a boat, take photos, communicate with the locals and ride a llama across a suspension bridge.

""Pedro"" tells the story of a cute ""little boy plane"" who dreams of carrying the mail between Chile and Argentina. A compelling story full of fun and drama, it holds up amazingly well, and looks like it could have been drawn yesterday.

The hilarious ""El Gaucho Goofy,"" is in the same vein as the 1950s Goofy ""How-To"" cartoons. As the narrator blindly describes how Goofy ""deftly tosses"" a lasso around a horse, ""quickly converts"" his saddle into a bed and ""gracefully"" dines on barbecue, the dippy dog botches every step. (If you buy this DVD, watch for these scene transitions. The lasso segment literally gets pushed off screen by the saddle scene, which itself ends by rolling up like a window shade. When the barbecue segment wipes off at an angle, Goofy nearly falls out of it!)

Finally, much like a tropical version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantasia/dp/B00003CX9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Fantasia,""</a>&nbsp;the terrific ""Aquarela do Brasil"" (""Watercolor of Brazil"") starts off as a painting of a vibrant rainforest that comes to life to music, in this case a great version of the samba standard ""Tico Tico No Fub."" Soon Donald appears, meets Brazilian playboy parrot Jos Carioca (a Disney version of a Brazilian folk character), and the duo shake their bonbons off into the nightlife of Rio. Much of Jose's dialogue is in Portuguese.

THE THREE CABALLEROS

The most bizarre movie the Walt Disney company has ever produced, 1945's ""The Three Caballeros"" is a collection of animated shorts, all tied together by a bare-bones plot of Donald Duck learning about Latin America. The cartoons progress from typically sweet Disney family fare to a truly psychedelic, adult-oriented swingin'-single travelogue that turns Donald into a libidinous wolf.

It begins as Donald Duck, sitting alone in a room, receives a big box filled with birthday presents ""from his friends in Latin America."" First up are a few cartoons about some unusual animals of South America -- ""The Cold Blooded Penguin,"" ""A Visit With More Rare Birds"" (rainforest birds) and ""The Story of The Flying Gauchito"" (a flying donkey). These three shorts take up the first 22 minutes of the film.

Next out of the box are two pop-up books about Brazil and Mexico. Each of these comes to life as its own peyote-paced animated featurette.

First, the cigar-chomping Jos Carioca pops out of the Brazil book and takes Donald on a 19-minute trip to the town of Baia (today's Salvador). As a catchy rhythm builds, Carioca creates his own harmony by dividing into four identical versions of himself, male, then female.

Eventually the birds meet the Cookie Lady (a live-action singer who attracts men with her baked goods) and soon the whole thing turns into what perhaps can best be described as a samba-fueled cookie version of the Marilyn Monroe production number, ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend.""

Donald gets jealous and pursues the Cookie Lady through the village -- which is, all along, a live-action stage set meant to be a huge pop-up-book page. For the finale, the Cookie Lady turns blue, two of her live-action suitors turn into fighting gamecocks and soon everyone and everything -- including the buildings, the moon, the waves in the sea -- dances into the night.

The book about Mexico brings forth Panchito, a six-gun-shooting cowboy rooster. He tosses sombreros to his new feathered friends, proclaims the trio ""three gay caballeros"" and takes Donald and Jos on a 30-minute flying-serape tour of his country.

On Acapulco Beach, Donald goes ga-ga for dozens of live-action bathing beauties (""Come to Papa! Come here, my little enchilada!"") and keeps losing his swimming suit. At night the duck can't stay away from the clubs, where he dances with still more real-life seoritas.

The movie's bizarre animation includes illogical color changes and an overdose of morphing gags. Donald himself assumes over a hundred shapes and color patterns, and once becomes a woman. Some scenes, however, are beautiful Mary Blair gems that would later inspire the films ""Cinderella"" and ""Alice in Wonderland,"" as well as the classic Disney attraction It's a Small World.

Sound great? My husband sure thinks so, and though I love the Mary Blair art, all the surreal animation and dated live-action blending don't exactly float my boat, and, well, I like my movies with a story! Still, some people have always found ""The Three Caballeros"" irresistibly entertaining, and it is certainly a must for any animation fan, as it shows the Disney animation team at its free-for-all zenith.

The two movies were produced as part of the U.S. government's Good Neighbor Policy, an effort to promote pro-American feelings (and combat Nazi sympathies) in Latin America during World War II.

BONUS FEATURES

Extras on the DVD include two good Donald Duck cartoons. In 1937's ""Don Donald"" (also on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronological-Donald-Vol-1/dp/B0000BWVAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronological Donald Vol. 1</a>), a flirtatious Daisy Duck (here named ""Donna"") gets trapped in the rumble seat of Donald's car as it bounces through the Mexican desert. In 1944's ""Contrary Condor"" (also on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronological-Donald-Vol-2/dp/B000ATQYU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronological Donald Vol. 2</a>), Donald finds himself hatching out of a condor egg and dealing with an overprotective mother.

Also included is 1942's ""South Of The Border With Disney,"" a 30-minute behind-the-scenes documentary. It shows Disney artists, including Mary Blair, in South America getting inspiration for the animated sequences in these films. It was also on the year-2000 DVD release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saludos-Amigos/dp/B00004R997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saludos Amigos.</a>

3330486,3,B0012RLXBU,"The two films on this DVD, Saludos Amigos and The Three Caballeros, consist of both animated shorts and live action segments that show off South American and Latin American culture.

The first film, Saludos Amigos, does not have much of a story but is introduced with Disney animators travelling to South America to do research for the movie. Along the way, Donald Duck meets the Brazilian parrot Jos Carioca.

The second film, The Three Caballeros, expands on the first film with its South American adventures and also travels to Latin America. In this film, it is Donald Duck's birthday and he receives gifts from his friends in other countries. He and Jos meet the Mexican rooster Panchito Pistoles.

I thought both films were a rather mixed bag. One of the strengths of most Disney films is their timeless appeal which, unfortunately, is not the case with these two movies. The live action segments are quite a dated aspect of the movies as we get to see these countries as they were back in the 1940s. While adult Disney enthusiasts might like the historical value of this, I find it difficult to see children being able to sit through it. Also, the films are at times rather nonsensical. Especially by the ending, The Three Caballeros has completely collapsed into a surreal mess.

In conclusion, this is a rather interesting piece in Disney animation history, although it is more notable for its historical value rather than entertainment value.",1418947200,,1452,4.890243902439025

As for Donald's chasing skirt, so did the cherubic Harpo in early Marx Brothers movies. It was considered I think disarmingly spontaneous behavior in more innocent times.

3330532,4,B0012RLXBU,"The only censorship mentioned by any reviewer of this or similar releases is the removal of no more than four seconds of Goofy smoking at the beginning of the ""El Gaucho Goofy"" segment of *Saludos Amigos*.

Even I, an anti-censorship nut -- I own a Japanese copy of *Song Of The South* and I still dream of seeing the complete *Tarzoon: Shame Of The Jungle* -- don't think this cherootectomy is a deal-killer. There's still plenty of smoking in these two cute little movies, especially by Jos Carioca the Brazilian parrot, as well as a surfeit of skirt-chasing (gasp!), heedless carbon use (the horror!), meat-eating and booze-swilling (shudder), Warner-worthy cartoon violence (won't somebody think of the children?), and other unfashionable antics that escaped the censor's knife.

If you really want to see Goofy taking a drag, the complete *Saludos Amigos* is included with *Walt & El Grupo*, a new and exceptionally well-done documentary of the Disney artists's 1941 tour of Latin America.

3330535,5,B0012RLXBU,"It is a very good idea to put these two films into a single DVD. ""Saludos Amigos"" was an initial effort of Disney to honor the Latin American nations in the wake of Roosevelt's ""Good Neighbor"" policy, and during World War II when the United States was trying to gain the sympathy and support of the American nations against the Axis powers. ""Saludos Amigos"" was a fairly good film, but was surpassed by its sequel, ""The Three Caballeros."" This film centers on a tour of parts of Latin America through the eyes of animated cartoon bird characters, principally Donald Duck of the United States, Jose Carioca of Brazil (a parrot), and Pancho Gonzales of Mexico (a pistol-packing rooster). Though the cultures are presented in a very simple way, we are given a terrific cafeteria of places and stories from Latin America, and though a bit corny, these glimpses of the cultures are both accurate and engaging. The principal vignettes are of the pampas of Uruguay and the gaucho culture, which really speaks also for Argentina; the sultry colonial beauty of Bahia in northeast Brazil; and various typical regions of Mexico. With each location we are treated to some of the most unforgettable folk dances and lovely traditional songs, featuring Brazilian singer Aurora Miranda, sister of the more famous Carmen Miranda, and Mexican Dora Luz singing Agustin Lara's great popular song, ""Solamente una Vez,"" in English as ""You Belong to My Heart."" Then there is the Mexican folklorist, Carmen Molina, who performs several traditional Mexican dances including a fragment of ""Zandunga"" in the spectacular lace headdress of the women of southern Mexico, and a most charming original dance to the great Mexican revolutionary song ""Jesusita en Chihuahua"" while wearing a most fetching feminine version of the Mexican national dress-up cowboy costume, the charro. Amidst all the glorious song and dance in ""The Three Caballeros,"" the recurrent main theme is the surging mariachi song ""Jalisco no te rajes,"" which means something like, ""Jalisco (a very traditional state in western Mexico headed by Guadalajara) don't let anyone put you down!"" Prior to digitally enabled film production,the combination of animated characters with real world photography was not very common. In these films it is quite effective. Sometimes the animated fantasy sequences are a little over the top and Donald Duck may not be to everyone's taste, but at least he makes an effective foil to all the gorgeous Latin American sight and sound. ""Saludos Amigos"" is a nice appetizer before the main feast of ""The Three Caballeros,"" a basically simple film which nevertheless strikes a universal chord and fully deserves five stars. I don't enjoy seeing many films several times over, but I never tire of ""The Three Caballeros.  """,1317427200,2,2786,5.109649122807017

8247432,4,B0012RLXBU,"An interesting entry in the Disney Animated collection, Saludos Amigos and The Three Caballeros are clearly products of their time more than most other entries in the Disney canon. The two-movie collection presents a good value as you get two movies for the price of one, although I feel that Saludos Amigos is the superior product. I enjoyed the segments in SA much more than I did in TTC, the latter of which seem much more experimental and have more live action than I care to see in an animated movie. Both are fascinating studies of cinema as propaganda, albeit positive in nature to strengthen relations between the USA and Latin america. As a completionist, I needed to have these to complete my collection, and it's fascinating to see this chapter of the Disney history, but these films are definitely not for everyone.",1502409600,,827,4.79020979020979
8247433,4,B0012RLXBU,"Great Old Disney Classic. This 2 Movie DVD is good. There are two additional cartoons on here and lots of old camera footage of Walt Disney on his trip to Latin America in the 1940's. I Don't Understand Why the price of This DVD and individual DVD's of The Three Caballeros are so expensively priced unless there's just not that many copies of it that have been released. This 2 Movie DVD with ""The Three Caballeros"" and ""Saludos Amigos"" was about $30$. So if I'm gunna spend $30$ I want it to be worth the movie. And this DVD is worth every bit. You get to enjoy great Disney cartoon artists work and the footage with WALT is just great.",1488240000,,638,4.325
