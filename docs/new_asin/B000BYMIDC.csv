2447141,5,B000BYMIDC,"It's obvious that Scott Ainslie knows what he's talking about. His relaxed, well-paced delivery enables him to serve up up a great learning experience. I enjoy just watching the DVD! It's entertaining as well as informative. Robert Johnson's substance and style are demonstrated, explained and taught with obvious pleasure and deep respect.",1276473600,,340,5.5576923076923075
2447142,5,B000BYMIDC,"This DVD is a phenomenal way to learn Robert Johnson's style, and Blues guitar in general.  The way the lessons are laid out, you get alot of detail from the instructor.  While it might be a challenge for a beginner guitarist, if you stick with it you will learn plenty.  And advanced guitarists can learn plenty from this...Getting into this DVD, it is more apparent than ever just how much of what Robert Johnson played became a huge part of Chicago Blues.  You can hear alot of these same licks in the music of Robert Lockwood Jr, Louis Myers, Muddy Waters, Jimmie Rogers and so many others... I love Blues so much, I'll buy pretty much any instructional DVD that comes out, because I love to learn... this DVD is one of the best I've gotten.  I think this is better than the Rory Block ""Robert Johnson instructionals"", though those are good too.  This cat, I think, has the phrasing and the timing down even better, and overall he explains things more clearly... I like that a few of the songs he teaches here are in standard tuning",1254873600,11,1036,4.48404255319149
2447143,5,B000BYMIDC,"I think you can't beat this video for learning Robert Johnson essentials. I had it in VHS and was glad to see they finally released it on DVD, a better media for learning anyway, plus I think the DVD has more songs. If you're just learning this uniquely American art form, you will be playing in no time, and if you're already there I have a feeling you'll be challenged and learn some new tricks. Skip selling your soul to the Devil like Robert did, and buy this video.",1231632000,2,470,4.292134831460674
2447144,4,B000BYMIDC,This DVD is a great learning tool for anyone who wishes to dive into learning the styles and playing of the one and only Robert Johnson.  This lesson features a variety of songs that will get you going along with a jam along cd for practice.,1142899200,3,241,4.239130434782608
2447145,5,B000BYMIDC,"I highly recommend Scott's Robert Johnson video. The lessons are clear and easy to follow and Scott adds a bit of his extensive knowledge of the blues interspersed with the lessons. A big difference over other videos is that he takes time to explain technique and rhythms that are some of the subtleties to Robert Johnson's songs. I wish it was longer, but there is plenty to practice. I am glad he finally has this out on DVD.",1135814400,3,427,4.487179487179487
8094299,4,B000BYMIDC,Excellent DVD.The accompanying instructional book is integral to the learning of these tunes.,1490832000,,93,6.230769230769231
8094300,5,B000BYMIDC,It was a gift.,1475712000,,14,2.75
8094301,5,B000BYMIDC,"I was into Robert Johnson when most people didn't know who he was. I wore out an old vinyl record I had of his. Aside from the great instructional aspect, which really gave me a better understanding of Robert's technique, I was introduced to a great guitarist. Scott Ainslie has taken me beyond Robert Johnson. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in learning to play Robert Johnson's music. If you don't know Scott Ainslie, well you will after this. I have since purchased every Scott Ainslie cd I could, and love them all.",1419292800,,532,4.670212765957447
8094302,4,B000BYMIDC,What a pleasant learning experience...Quality of the video is not as good as you get with Stefen Grossman or Homespun Tapes but the info is there in easy to achieve format. Requires you to be some what up to speed on your fingerpickng but put in some time with Scotty and some of the licks that seem impossible on records will be yours in a short time. WSould recomend it to anyone who wants to play this type of music. Well worth the money!,1396656000,,441,4.261904761904762
8094303,5,B000BYMIDC,"If you're really interested in where all that British Invasion music came from, Robert Johnson is Music Appreciation 101. I like what Clapton, Peter Greene and the other Brits did with Johnson's material; but you can't be a true aficionado if you aren't well versed with Robert Johnson. Behold! Your first grade primer is at hand.",1396137600,,330,4.910714285714286
8094304,4,B000BYMIDC,"If you want to know how to play Robert Johnson's songs right, this DVD does it and more than I had expected!
I was (and still are) blown away with all the information at hand that's needed to process.
And it could take me awhile to absorbe it all...considering ones work schedule, but I have no regrets on this purchase.
Scott definitely teaches and covers the material thoroughly!
Thank you!",1383782400,,392,4.614285714285714
8094305,5,B000BYMIDC,"Excellent for anyone wanting to learn traditional blues from one of the all time great Grandfather of the blues Robert Johnson held in high esteem by many of the worlds leading guitarists such as Eric Clapton and many others. Myself wanted to learn Blues from a traditional standpoint to really play the Blues well,Scott Ainslie demonstrates this in a excellent manner plus it comes with a booklet with chords,licks,tab and music notation, i highly recommend this brilliant DVD.",1377388800,,478,5.141025641025641
8094306,4,B000BYMIDC,"This DVD is a great resource for learning Johnson's techniques, but I did find some differences between Ainslie and Johnson.",1377129600,,124,5.25
8094307,5,B000BYMIDC,"This is a wonderful product.  Recorded in 1989, so be forewarned if you are the type that is turned off by something as superficial as dated-looking production value.  The content itself is second to none.  I am a long time RJ fan who has suffered for many hours trying to get Poor Bob's sound down to no avail.  Within the first half hour or so I spent with it, I knew this DVD is the missing piece to the puzzle for me.  I don't think Mr. Ainslee nails it note for note by any means - and I don't mean that to be taken as a knock, because I've heard many many great players interpret RJ, and the next one I hear ""nail it"" will be the first.  What he has done an amazing job of is to make incredibly approachable and great sounding arrangements that really capture the high points/distinctive parts of the song and are more than good enough pass for the real thing.  When you couple this with Mr. Ainslee's fantastic teaching style, he should have you up & running much quicker than you ever imagined.  The DVD even comes with a handy checkbook-sized (roughly) cheat sheet for some of the trickier licks if you are having trouble picking up on the fingering from just watching.

I really can't say enough about how wonderful of an experience this has been - I'm really shocked at how good I sound (yes, I know, immodest), especially considering how badly I bumbled through some of these tunes just a short time ago.  I also own the ""Complete Transcriptions"" - what I have done personally is to get Mr. Ainslee's arrangement mastered as best as possible as a starting point, and then cross-reference with the ""authentic"" tabs and original recordings to add some flair here & there where I think it's needed.  But that's just me - I'm a nut - Ainslee's arrangements sound very, very good as they are.",1309996800,9,1799,4.437689969604863
8094308,5,B000BYMIDC,"Mr. Ainslee presents seven Johnson tunes that are representative of most of the keys and tunings that Johnson recorded: Standard tuning in A, standard tuning in E, drop-D tuning, open E, and open A. Ainslee has mastered Johnson's playing style with an amazing degree of accuracy and detail, not to mention good insights into where Johnson was coming from musically, and he presents these techniques in an easy-to-understand fashion. These seven songs are a great foundation for learning Robert Johnson's varied techniques. The included tablature booklet is very helpful as well. Missing are any examples of Johnson's ragtime style playing in standard tuning C (Four Until Late or They're Red Hot) or his more idiosyncratic open-A tunes like Preaching Blues, but you can't expect everything in a single DVD. It is amazing the breadth and quality of instruction he manages to pack into this DVD.",1283817600,10,893,5.165517241379311
