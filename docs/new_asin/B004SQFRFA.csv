8440130,5,B004SQFRFA,"""Firing Line"" ran for a third of a century, and one of its most talked-about episodes of all time was the 1978 episode in which the Panama Canal treaties were debated.  The issue was touchy in those immediate post-Vietnam years when America's place in the world was precarious and under threat from the Communist menace.  Host William F. Buckley led the team supporting ratification, and future president Ronald Reagan led the team opposed to the treaties.

The proposed treaties would turn control of the canal to Panama in 2000, which seemed far in the future in 1978.  Reagan and Buckley each made strong arguments to support their views, and the debate touched on colonialism, terrorism, how the canal came into being and how it had been operated up to the late Seventies, how vulnerable the canal might be to attack and its availability in possible future wars, practicalities in turning the canal over to Panama, and how we would be viewed by the world if we kept or surrendered the canal.

Reagan and Buckley were not the only heavy hitters in the hall that nightexaminers included James Burnham, George Will, Pat Buchanan, and John McCain (father of the GOP 2008 presidential nominee).  This installment of ""Firing Line"" was debate at a high level that we see less and less of in our twenty-first century politics.  It is a unique snapshot of a perilous time, and a chance to see Ronald Reagan in his best form less than three years before he would be elected as the president who would see the successful reassertion of American strength and ultimate victory over the Evil Empire.",1515801600,,1589,4.798534798534798

8440132,5,B004SQFRFA,"In William F Buckley's ""Miles Gone By"", Buckley calls this debate (and Reagan's stand on the issue) as a key factor in Reagan garnering base support and ultimately the 1980 GOP nomination for the Presidency. The issue of the ratification of these Panama Canal Treaties literally split the Republican party in two and you will see what I mean when you watch this. Reagan along with Pat Buchanan, adviser John S McCain (former Admiral not the current Senator), and one other argue that ratifying these particular treaties are not good for the country. They argue that the Senate should hold out for a better deal before going through with the ratification. WFB Jr, George Will and two others agree with the Carter Adminstration on this foreign policy issue because they claim that the US owning the Canal fuels the arguement for America's enemies that the US is an imperialist colonial power.

This all occurred long before my time so I needed to educate myself with the details of the ratification before watchig and understanding it completely. I do know what happened after the ratification with the destabilization of Panama which led to armed conflict against Noriega in late 1989 and early 1990.

This is an interesting, thoughtful foreign policy debate and is worth watching if only to see Ronald Reagan debate William F Buckley Jr. It is a worthy document for a Presidential historian as well because Reagan was working more as a dinner speaker, journalist and radio personality at the time of this debate.",1371513600,3,1512,4.925490196078432
