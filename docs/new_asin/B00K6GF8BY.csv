6403538,5,B00K6GF8BY,"This is a story about a guy and his dream to run an arcade that is full of the classic games from the golden age of arcades. It was great seeing Dragon's Lair, Bagman, Pole Position, and Star Wars in that setting again. The movie does a good job of also giving a history of the arcades with some archival footage. There are some interviews with the some of the founders of video games that helped turn it into a multi-billion dollar industry: Ralph Baer, Nolan Bushnell, and Eugene Jarvis. You also get some interviews with the competitive side of classic arcade gaming, like Billy Mitchell and Walter Day.

As a side note, the video and audio quality are superb. The movie picture quality looked like a Blu-ray disc and not a DVD.

If you enjoy arcade classics or want to see a movie about a guy following his dreams you need to watch this movie. Highly recommended!",1403222400,5,867,4.481012658227848

6403543,5,B00K6GF8BY,"This is a great story! I was amazed at how much work goes into refurbishing the arcade cabinets. And to see all the old classic arcade games instantly took me back to my childhood. I spent most of the documentary naming off the different games and recalling my own experiences with them.

The documentary moved fast and created a quick emotional tie-in to Richie Knucklez (who could easily be pro-wrestler Chavo Guerrero Jr's stunt-double :-) )",1409270400,3,444,4.842105263157895

6403546,5,B00K6GF8BY,"This documentary was excellent.  The level of detail and the quality of the subject matter were immaculate.  The King of Arcades stands tall with other great titles such as the King of Kong....  It's a must for anyone interested in classic arcade gaming.  Buy a copy for yourself it you can find it,  you won't be disappointed.",1405209600,2,327,4.666666666666667
6403547,5,B00K6GF8BY,"A great film about a great guy. If you liked ""The King of Kong"" you will LOVE this! It appeals to the kid in you and really gets in deep. For all the gamers out there, they should definitely see this film and learn about the begining. And how games, that are 30 years old, are still a part of everyones life.",1404864000,2,308,3.9838709677419355
6403548,5,B00K6GF8BY,"I have always been about a middle of the road arcade person and really never got into the competitive side of gaming but this documentary really brought back great memories of the games I used to see when I was a kid.  Growing up in southampton I know I had several birthday parties at TNT and I saw a kind of behind the scenes look at that place that holds a lot of significance in my life.  Also watching Richie live through the ups and downs and being a friend of his through this whole movie it really gave me an insight as to how hard he works and some of the awesome people he has surrounded himself with.  Sean tiedman did an excellent job putting this all together and joe chapman did just as awesome of a job putting together that Pacman fever video which I am glad my fiance (Samantha Bellitz)  and I got to sing on and be a part of .  I loved the movie and the thoroughness of the history of gaming and I gained a lot of insight as to where the games I play today come from.  Keep up the great work everyone involved and I look forward to great news about the film!,",1403740800,3,1077,4.080568720379147
6403549,5,B00K6GF8BY,"I'm a video gaming fanatic. I love playing, collecting, and competing for world records. From the classic arcade games of my past, to home console  both of yesterday and the current gen.  I've been lucky enough to attend the first Kong Off featured in this film and had an amazing experience.  Now the one thing you don't really think about while while attending one of these tournaments is who is running it, providing for it, sacrificing for it, you don't ever question what form of passion the creator must have. Well now we can see what exactly one man has done to help us preserve history, what he's had to sacrifice both at home and business for the hobby we all love. Lots of gaming legends and a killer soundtrack! A must own for gaming fans.  \w/ J.Pompa",1403481600,2,763,4.507246376811594
6403550,5,B00K6GF8BY,"The passion for arcade gaming really comes through in this film.  I spent a lot of quarters on arcade games growing up and once had the privilege of playing at the famous Twin Galaxies arcade in Ottumwa Iowa as a kid.

If you love video games, you must watch this film to understand how video games got their start and what drives many to collect and restore these 30+ year old games.  It really is a labor of love.

This film has a lot of great footage of the games, the founders of arcade gaming, and world record high-score holders.",1403308800,3,535,4.32
6403551,5,B00K6GF8BY,"I'm not much of a reviewer, but I grew up in the era of arcades so this is a topic true and dear to me, and The King of Arcades is an awesome account of both the arcade industry, and the people who loved it, built it, and made it so great.  This video is very well made, and well worth the price of admission.  After watching, you can't help but break out the classics and relive the memories.  Very highly recommended.",1403308800,2,419,4.085365853658536

Cool movie",1530921600,,31,4.333333333333333
8656272,5,B00K6GF8BY,I don't think anyone can question Richie's dedication (obsession really) with classic arcade machines and restoration. Great passion as well. Learned about quite a few games I didn't have in my MAME collection that I added. There's a lot of bonus content on this DVD which was also great. Tons of value there and a great trip down memory lane.,1530057600,,343,4.733333333333333
8656273,4,B00K6GF8BY,Definitely a different style of documentary than King of Kong.  A movie a bout a guy doing wonderful things with an arcade and his struggles to keep it going.  I enjoyed it a lot.,1528848000,,179,4.235294117647059
8656274,5,B00K6GF8BY,Fantastic Doc about what it takes to make arcades work in today's world. Cool history of an awesome piece of 80's nostalgia. Loved every minute of it.,1519603200,,150,4.592592592592593

8656277,5,B00K6GF8BY,"I give this movie an easy five stars. However it is not a DVD that everyone may want to own. This DVD is specifically for those people interested in classic video games specifically those interested in arcade games. If you are not interested in arcade machines, then you will have no interest in this DVD. However if you love arcade games or have grown up playing video games in arcades, then you are sure to love this DVD. If you know nothing about the subject and love arcades because you grew up playing video games in arcades, then this DVD is a great introduction on what is going on in the world with arcade games these days.

This DVD chronicles the life of Richie Knucklez, one of many people who operate and restore classic arcade games, aka the arcade cabinets that you used to see in the mall, movie theaters and in stand alone arcades during the 1980's. Since I am very passionate about this subject I absolutely had to own this DVD and jumped on it when it was offered for a low price. I can say this unique DVD was well worth my money, and I was totally immersed in it while watching it. This isn't the type of DVD you can rent at the library so its well worth owning. I don't purchase many DVD's for myself these days but I can say this one is worthy of my very small DVD collection. The passion that Richie exhibits for restoring classic game through thick and thin is exceptional. I absolutely love to hear stories like this about someone who is so passionate about a subject.",1452470400,,1493,4.370503597122302
