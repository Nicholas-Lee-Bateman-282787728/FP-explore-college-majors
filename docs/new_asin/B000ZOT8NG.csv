3043101,3,B000ZOT8NG,"An awe-inspiring show, but... the production of the DVD is flawed to the point that I'd rather watch my old VHS copy of the Dublin performance (and that's really saying something since Michael Flatley frankly leaves me cold).  The picture quality is mediocre at best.  Whether it's the lighting, the equipment they used or a combination of both, it tends to be dark and somewhat grainy.  There is very little sharpness to the picture.  It actually reminds me of a poor quality VHS tape, not modern digital video.

Now to address the real culprit: the Editor, Jim Duggan.  Here's the scene - 30 Irish dancers in a straight line onstage, hard-shoeing their hearts out in outstanding synchronization, preparing for their signature move where they all stop dancing and then jig one-at-a-time in a kind of wave, down the line from one end to the other IN UNDER 3 SECONDS.  Does the editor draw our focus to this awesome dance sequence?  No!  He chooses, instead, to capture forever all 30 of these incredibly talented dancers TURNING THEIR HEADS!!!  Even worse, the camera angle he chose is from the side so we see all the action jammed together in half of the screen's width because of this awful perspective, when we could have seen this human ""wave"" travel 60+ feet across the stage faster than most of us can run.  Thank goodness the dancers repeat this wave movement in the opposite direction a moment later.  Unfortunately, Mr. Duggan once again features the head turns and not the dancers' feet!

There are just too many editing gaffs like the one noted above for this DVD to receive more than 3 stars.  It's a brilliant performance marred by an inept editor's poor choices.  Yep, give me the old VHS program any day.  I wish they'd release THAT performance on DVD!",1251072000,22,1767,4.7254901960784315

3043104,4,B000ZOT8NG,"I saw this show on VHS 6 or 7 years ago and was waiting for the DVD release. It is hard to find the proper words to describe how amazing the show is. The disc is a compilation of the famous Riverdance Show live from Radio City Music Hall in New York.

Now, what is on the disc? First of all is the gorgeous Irish step-dance couple Colin Dunne and Jean Butler. They are just amazing; it is hard to stop watching their performances, expressions, speed footwork, and beauty. They are unbelievable and their scenes are never boring to watch again and again! I might like the performance with Michael Flatley a little bit better than that with Colin Dunne but again, it is very subjective and Colin Dunne is unbelievable too.

Although I am not a huge fan of Flamenco, Maria Pages's Firedance is special in the show. Even I am speechless when watching Maria's expressions in this dance. You might ask what Flamenco is doing in an Irish Music/Dance show? I have no idea but it just fits in perfectly.

The show has a very impressive scene when Colin Dunne and two more dancers from the Riverdance group try to ""compete"" with Tarik Winston, an African-American tap dancer from the Bronx, and another tap dancer. To me, Tarik won... I like this part (Trading Taps) the most after the Finale.

You should be warned - the show is not dancing only. It includes a musical performance and singing. I like all the outstanding voices and heartwarming tunes, though I personally am waiting for the dancing to begin.

Overall, the content is still super hot even about a dozen years after the performance. The DVD just appeared in 2008 and is much better than VHS. It contains a lot of special features with interviews and the history of this show (and is worth watching too, by the way). The Riverdance Show became a very refreshing event in the history of dancing and has its own special place there.

So, why 4 stars only? The reason is that I am not supposed to evaluate the show. It has been evaluated many times by many people and their evaluation is simple: Riverdance is a historical event that is hard to overestimate. I am supposed to evaluate the DVD I purchased. I am sorry to say that the video is, at most, of average quality. I can accept that a video recording from 1996 might not be as bright and sharp as a modern recording. Indeed, it is 16:9 but it cannot be called High Definition. I believe that the lighting was not good for the recording.

The real problem, however, is the editing of this recording. The video is taken from a few cameras and the producer (who deserves a dozen spoiled tomatoes thrown at his head for his cutting work) switches between them quickly, unpredictably and annoyingly.  Sometimes you barely can see the dance composition. Instead the video can show you the feet of a random dancer for many seconds. It is awful and sometimes produces sea sickness due to loss of space orientation (at least for me). I cannot give the product less than 4 stars because it is a DVD any dance fan must have. However, you have been warned that the video quality is below average. Although it is watchable and very enjoyable, I am very dissatisfied by the quality of the video.

I highly recommend this DVD for purchase but be warned about the below average video composition.",1224633600,66,3289,4.54222972972973

3043107,5,B000ZOT8NG,"I'm very happy that Riverdance: Live from Radio City has been reissued. It looks as good as ever, and much more convenient that the disc doesn't need to be turned over to watch the second half.

Colin and Jean are the best leads together, dancing in a beautiful duet with one another. These two are experts, and it shows. Colin Dunne projects a passion and refinement in his step dancing that no other male lead has. His speed and timing are perfect, but the main interest is his graceful technique and his musical sense of rhythm so evident in all of his solos. He really shines in his Heartbeat of the World duet with Flamenco dancer Maria Pages, and of course, the ever favorite, Trading Taps with the American tap dancers.

Jean Butler, as always, dazzles the audience with her regal beauty and her flowing, graceful soft shoe solos. She has a powerful stage presence and brings out the beauty of Irish dance.

The band is excellent. The sets are beautiful, authentic hand painted sets. The company is tight and well-rehearsed. This truly is the best recorded version of the phenomenon Riverdance. The documentaries alone are well worth the purchase of this reissue.",1214265600,6,1170,4.753694581280788
3043108,5,B000ZOT8NG,"In truth, the (or ""a"", rather) 1995 performance of Riverdance at the Radio City Music Hall has been released on DVD before, but I have not seen them (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/half-and-half-dual-sided-DVD/dp/0767804341/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">half-and-half dual-sided DVD</a>, and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/single-sided-Superbit-DVD/dp/B0000B1OGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">single-sided Superbit DVD</a>&nbsp;was missing half or so of the entire performance (including the midway ""Riverdance"" itself!)). We, my family, have had a VHS recording of the show for years, and aside from the high-pitched vocal shortcomings (at least to our ears) in the beginning, the energy of the performance, not to mention the charm of its leading performers, has kept it as a favorite, and one of the only members, of our not-a-movie video collection.  To finally get a proper DVD release, bearing everything that we love about the VHS version in one continuous strand, would've been great.

Then, on a trp to Best buy, I happen to spot it when my sister and I were over at its little section of the isles.  It was recent, it was classy (think ""hardcover""), and it was... thirty-five dollars or so, too much for my pocket at the time.  Thanks to the Internet, I was able to snag this bit o' memories at a much better price (mid to low twenties), and as soon as it arrived (the day I'm typing this review), popping it in made me reasonably confident.  The case itself is very solid, with an interior featuring the principal dancers, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne, one a fire-haired beauty and the other a lovable 'jerk' (watch and you'll get what kind of ramp I'm talking about), whose movements sweep your mind, and likely your own hands and feet, along with the music, which I feel outshines anything else this show offers (really, I'm no good at following stories told through dance, and only slightly less worse at catching the lyrics of the songs).  It is a broad scope, but throughout it all, you feel the emotions shown on that stage, and you'll definitely crack a smile and get goosebumps as the show carries on.

A mild gripe I have, though it might be our TV (an LCD) or our DVD player, but you can see lines and flicker of the sort that you might expect on an analog broadcast.  Still, these are rarely noticed (mostly during the opening text, the flamenco intro, and subtitles), as the rest of the performance is so fluid that there's no chance to catch any interlace.  There was also a levels-of-light effect akin to altitude mapping as I fast-forwarded, but this sort of thing occurred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FFVIIAC/dp/B000K4WLXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FFVIIAC</a>&nbsp;on normal play, so for when it occurred, this is a non-issue.  Speaking of fast-forwarding, the segments seem to be broken into ranges rather than individual pieces, so if you want to scoot past the singing, you should fast-forward, in case it's the middle of that segment; the scene listings on the back of the box (synonymous with the VHS box, as other text) doesn't fully match up with the in-DVD titleage, but a quick look into the section should give one a point of reference, so another non-issue.  All in all, the video quality at least matches, though likely supersedes, the video I remember from our VHS.  To boot, it's widescreen, which gives you even more scope of the lines of dancers.  Oh, and there's native stereo sound along with a couple surround sound options (one being Dolby Digital).

Ah, I remember in another reviewer's take on the performance itself that they were disappointed with the editing job done.  To a degree, I agree, since the constant switching of angle to angle somewhat disrupts the scope the stage allows.  However, watching it again, I feel the clips work in tandem with the energy and the focus at any point in time, and while at first something that happens through the stage (for example, three male dancers doing toe-touches one after the other) isn't apparent due to focus on an active member, but things like this are given a full-scene shot, so you see the effect at least once, with the addition of seeing the motions up close.  Plus, you can't beat those pan shots of the lines.

Ah, and bonus content.  This is all relegated to the second disc, and includes a documentary of Riverdance's first ten years (1994-2004), a documentary of their experience in China (also 2004), and an interview that I haven't yet watched.  The documentaries (which overlap at least once, to my bemusement) really give you a feel for the creators and casts of the various troupes and their performances, which could only make watching the first disc more emotionally drawing.  For a single show, these bonuses cover a lot, and make me want to see the other performances throughout the years.  You'll hear the finale music over and over, but the sheer energy of it and the dancing in tune never gets old.

Riverdance is a powerful force, if nowhere else then with the movements and sounds of few to many people visually demonstrating the power of the musical compositions, and to finally see this showing brought to DVD so well is a pipe dream for me.  If you have the money, and you love music, dancing, or, hell, even singing that transcends any brought to film or stage, get a Riverdance DVD, with this one being my own recommendation to start (or continue) in a love for this blend that plucks your excitement out and throws it back into you.  You'll dance a jig for sure...at least if no one's watching, eh?",1214179200,31,5663,5.063440860215054
3043109,5,B000ZOT8NG,"I had not been exposed to the phenomenon of Riverdance before.  I had heard about the amazing performances given around the globe by this dance company, but this DVD was my first real exposure.  I have to say I saw totally blown away by the skill, visual and total sensual experience of this DVD.  The dancers and musicians were awesome.

This DVD was almost like two performances in one.  You had the dance and you had the music.  The orchestra performed a couple of songs that can standalone in my book as some of the best music -- sort of new age in nature.  In fact it reminded me a bit of Yanni or John Tesh at times.  But it would harken back to the Irish tones and bring you back home to its roots.

The dancers and singers were just wonderful.  The solo artists had the most crisp and clear voices I've heard in quite some time.  The principal dancers for the company clearly enjoyed their art -- dancing quite challenging pieces with smiles on their faces and a love of dance written all over them.  One can only imagine the amount of time it has taken to perfect this dance -- totally in step with each other and in harmony with the music.  The segment that mixed a bit of street dance with the traditional Riverdance format was lively and demonstrated the universal nature of dance to culture.

I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves music and dance.  You don't have to be Irish to appreciate the craftsmanship that has gone into making this DVD and the Riverdance company.  It is just amazing.",1203292800,42,1520,4.413669064748201

3043112,4,B000ZOT8NG,"A very good performance but picture quality a little to be desired.  Not as good as the original performance with Flattely  as principal dancer, but his ego killed his career with additional Riverdance performances, and his solo DVDs like ""Lord of the Dance"" were a total waste of money- quality was so poor I threw them in the trash.  I wish PBS or someone would have taken the time to make a DVD of the original Riverdance performance with the original cast.  What was so hard to do about that with today's technology?

3043113,5,B000ZOT8NG,"What a fantastic show! I have watched this version many times since childhood and the dancing never loses its appeal. The songs interspersed with the dancing slow the action considerably, but some are quite beautiful. I watch for the dancing, however.

I know that Michael Flatley is hailed as ""Lord of the Dance"", but Colin Dunne's chemistry with Jean Butler is simply electric, which is why I prefer this version to the one with Michael Flatley.

There were so many rapid-fire angle changes that it nauseated me, and destroyed the natural rhythms and dramatic arcs of the choreography itself, which is what I was really hoping to get to see.  This was cut like an action movie.  It made it impossible to really see any of what I presume to be fantastic dancing.

Several dance routines were almost unwatchable due to changing cameras rapid fire to the point that you could not even decipher what was flying by onscreen. The editor should never be allowed near such a project again.
That said it is still Riverdance, hard as the editor tried to ruin it. Jean Butler has a wonderful chemistry with Colin Dunne that was not there with Michael Flately. The cast was spot on and the audience cheers and roars of approval sucked the viewer into the celebration that is Riverdance.

If I wanted to see how ""great"" the BBC is I'd watch the BBC. It totally breaks the mood of the Riverdance experience. The show itself will transform the evening -- take you on a trip across the Ocean and back again. It is different from the other performances partially for this reason. It shows the immigrants that came here and built the life that we,their grateful decendents now have. It shows what they left,what they brought with them, and what they found. We have a rich heritage. It is a beautiful way to teach. A beautiful way to learn.

3043175,5,B000ZOT8NG,"Prior to ordering this I read the reviews, which, on a whole, were mostly positive.  But there was one aspect of this DVD that others were mentioning negatively; it was the way it was shot from different camera angles, and the main complaint was there was a lot of darting around, as though the viewer could never fully absorb the scene.  Well I just ordered it anyway because I love the show so much, and I'm happy to report that I had no problem with any ""darting around"" of camera angles, and sat just as mesmerized with this production as I did with the original one at the Point Theater in Ireland.  The cast is stellar, you just want to jump up there with them; Colin Dunne is superb (I thought I'd be heartbroken with the abscence of Michael Flatley, and all due respect to Michael, Colin did a wonderful job); Jean Butler is simply ever-beautiful, you cannot resist her; Maria Pages, you're in sheer awe watching her; and Katie McMahon has that one-in-a-million pure voice that's simply her own.  I can go on, and almost did, but, in a nutshell, if you have any fears of not enjoying this for whatever reason, well you can lose those fears, as it's totally enjoyable.",1272931200,9,1175,4.502347417840376

3043177,4,B000ZOT8NG,"I agree to some extent with other reviews already given, but would like to offer my own spin on both the Dublin and New York versions of Riverdance: they are different and they are both superb.  The show evolved between the Dublin production and the years-later, New York performance.  I haven't seen this 2-DVD (NY) edition, so I can't comment on the special features.  I'm hoping that either or both productions will be made available on Blu-ray. (At the time of writing, Amazon's product listing is a little confusing: this listing comes up in a search for Riverdance Blu-ray, but does not appear to be in Blu-ray format.)

I've watched both the Dublin and NY performances several times, and enjoy both greatly.  Both performances and recordings have aspects that I prefer, and other aspects I consider slightly less than optimum.  They are different enough and both are such compelling productions that we watch them alternately.  I'm glad that the producers of the videos released both productions.

Regarding the music and dance content of the two productions, they are both superb, and choosing one over the other would be nearly impossible.  The dancing is incredible in both.  Michael Flatley (Dublin) brings the greater technical and athletic intensity to his performances, but Colin Dunne (NY) brings his own unique and appealing talents to the dance.  Overall, I slightly prefer the vocal and choral work in the NY performance.  In the case of instrumental performances, again, all are outstanding, though I slightly prefer one or another of the analogous performers in the two productions.  Davy Spillane's performances (Dublin) are unmatched in pathos and depth.  One view of this is that you wouldn't go far wrong choosing either.  But if you choose both, you will be rewarded.

Some reviewers of the New York recording have noted heavy-handed video editing.  The first time we watched it, my wife and I reacted the same way: the rapid changes in perspective and focus drove us crazy.  On subsequent viewings, the editing seems acceptable and even somewhat natural.  When one attends a performance like this, one's attention typically flits around among overall and specific focus.  While I prefer editing of a performance video to be a little less obtrusive, this editing gives an overall impression of the performance, if you can roll with the editor's decisions.  I find the stage sets, lighting, videography, and editing of the Dublin production to be more in harmony with the program's content.

I would add a moderate criticism of the DVD of the NY production: the sound recording quality is very good but not great.  The high frequency content is strongly de-emphasized.  For example, the fiddle and some of the sharper percussion instruments lack ""bite"" and the high chimes visible in the video are almost completely inaudible.  If a blu-ray format is undertaken, I hope this could be corrected.  I have the Dublin performance on VHS, and I prefer the sound quality.

If you haven't seen Riverdance, forget the nuances and see it in some form or other!  If you become a Riverdance fanatic like me, get both productions, and see the live show, too!!",1263168000,,3171,5.011472275334608
3043178,1,B000ZOT8NG,"Sure, the dancing is phenomenal.  But the rapid-fire editing destroys the continuity of the dancing and leaves you disoriented and unsettled.  The editor thought he was the star of the show.  WRONG!  It is the dancers.

3277598,3,B000ZOT8NG,"An awe-inspiring show, but... the production of the DVD is flawed to the point that I'd rather watch my old VHS copy of the Dublin performance (and that's really saying something since Michael Flatley frankly leaves me cold).  The picture quality is mediocre at best.  Whether it's the lighting, the equipment they used or a combination of both, it tends to be dark and somewhat grainy.  There is very little sharpness to the picture.  It actually reminds me of a poor quality VHS tape, not modern digital video.

Now to address the real culprit: the Editor, Jim Duggan.  Here's the scene - 30 Irish dancers in a straight line onstage, hard-shoeing their hearts out in outstanding synchronization, preparing for their signature move where they all stop dancing and then jig one-at-a-time in a kind of wave, down the line from one end to the other IN UNDER 3 SECONDS.  Does the editor draw our focus to this awesome dance sequence?  No!  He chooses, instead, to capture forever all 30 of these incredibly talented dancers TURNING THEIR HEADS!!!  Even worse, the camera angle he chose is from the side so we see all the action jammed together in half of the screen's width because of this awful perspective, when we could have seen this human ""wave"" travel 60+ feet across the stage faster than most of us can run.  Thank goodness the dancers repeat this wave movement in the opposite direction a moment later.  Unfortunately, Mr. Duggan once again features the head turns and not the dancers' feet!

There are just too many editing gaffs like the one noted above for this DVD to receive more than 3 stars.  It's a brilliant performance marred by an inept editor's poor choices.  Yep, give me the old VHS program any day.  I wish they'd release THAT performance on DVD!",1251072000,22,1767,4.7254901960784315

3277601,4,B000ZOT8NG,"I saw this show on VHS 6 or 7 years ago and was waiting for the DVD release. It is hard to find the proper words to describe how amazing the show is. The disc is a compilation of the famous Riverdance Show live from Radio City Music Hall in New York.

Now, what is on the disc? First of all is the gorgeous Irish step-dance couple Colin Dunne and Jean Butler. They are just amazing; it is hard to stop watching their performances, expressions, speed footwork, and beauty. They are unbelievable and their scenes are never boring to watch again and again! I might like the performance with Michael Flatley a little bit better than that with Colin Dunne but again, it is very subjective and Colin Dunne is unbelievable too.

Although I am not a huge fan of Flamenco, Maria Pages's Firedance is special in the show. Even I am speechless when watching Maria's expressions in this dance. You might ask what Flamenco is doing in an Irish Music/Dance show? I have no idea but it just fits in perfectly.

The show has a very impressive scene when Colin Dunne and two more dancers from the Riverdance group try to ""compete"" with Tarik Winston, an African-American tap dancer from the Bronx, and another tap dancer. To me, Tarik won... I like this part (Trading Taps) the most after the Finale.

You should be warned - the show is not dancing only. It includes a musical performance and singing. I like all the outstanding voices and heartwarming tunes, though I personally am waiting for the dancing to begin.

Overall, the content is still super hot even about a dozen years after the performance. The DVD just appeared in 2008 and is much better than VHS. It contains a lot of special features with interviews and the history of this show (and is worth watching too, by the way). The Riverdance Show became a very refreshing event in the history of dancing and has its own special place there.

So, why 4 stars only? The reason is that I am not supposed to evaluate the show. It has been evaluated many times by many people and their evaluation is simple: Riverdance is a historical event that is hard to overestimate. I am supposed to evaluate the DVD I purchased. I am sorry to say that the video is, at most, of average quality. I can accept that a video recording from 1996 might not be as bright and sharp as a modern recording. Indeed, it is 16:9 but it cannot be called High Definition. I believe that the lighting was not good for the recording.

The real problem, however, is the editing of this recording. The video is taken from a few cameras and the producer (who deserves a dozen spoiled tomatoes thrown at his head for his cutting work) switches between them quickly, unpredictably and annoyingly.  Sometimes you barely can see the dance composition. Instead the video can show you the feet of a random dancer for many seconds. It is awful and sometimes produces sea sickness due to loss of space orientation (at least for me). I cannot give the product less than 4 stars because it is a DVD any dance fan must have. However, you have been warned that the video quality is below average. Although it is watchable and very enjoyable, I am very dissatisfied by the quality of the video.

I highly recommend this DVD for purchase but be warned about the below average video composition.",1224633600,66,3289,4.54222972972973

3277604,5,B000ZOT8NG,"I'm very happy that Riverdance: Live from Radio City has been reissued. It looks as good as ever, and much more convenient that the disc doesn't need to be turned over to watch the second half.

Colin and Jean are the best leads together, dancing in a beautiful duet with one another. These two are experts, and it shows. Colin Dunne projects a passion and refinement in his step dancing that no other male lead has. His speed and timing are perfect, but the main interest is his graceful technique and his musical sense of rhythm so evident in all of his solos. He really shines in his Heartbeat of the World duet with Flamenco dancer Maria Pages, and of course, the ever favorite, Trading Taps with the American tap dancers.

Jean Butler, as always, dazzles the audience with her regal beauty and her flowing, graceful soft shoe solos. She has a powerful stage presence and brings out the beauty of Irish dance.

The band is excellent. The sets are beautiful, authentic hand painted sets. The company is tight and well-rehearsed. This truly is the best recorded version of the phenomenon Riverdance. The documentaries alone are well worth the purchase of this reissue.",1214265600,6,1170,4.753694581280788
3277605,5,B000ZOT8NG,"In truth, the (or ""a"", rather) 1995 performance of Riverdance at the Radio City Music Hall has been released on DVD before, but I have not seen them (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/half-and-half-dual-sided-DVD/dp/0767804341/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">half-and-half dual-sided DVD</a>, and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/single-sided-Superbit-DVD/dp/B0000B1OGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">single-sided Superbit DVD</a>&nbsp;was missing half or so of the entire performance (including the midway ""Riverdance"" itself!)). We, my family, have had a VHS recording of the show for years, and aside from the high-pitched vocal shortcomings (at least to our ears) in the beginning, the energy of the performance, not to mention the charm of its leading performers, has kept it as a favorite, and one of the only members, of our not-a-movie video collection.  To finally get a proper DVD release, bearing everything that we love about the VHS version in one continuous strand, would've been great.

Then, on a trp to Best buy, I happen to spot it when my sister and I were over at its little section of the isles.  It was recent, it was classy (think ""hardcover""), and it was... thirty-five dollars or so, too much for my pocket at the time.  Thanks to the Internet, I was able to snag this bit o' memories at a much better price (mid to low twenties), and as soon as it arrived (the day I'm typing this review), popping it in made me reasonably confident.  The case itself is very solid, with an interior featuring the principal dancers, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne, one a fire-haired beauty and the other a lovable 'jerk' (watch and you'll get what kind of ramp I'm talking about), whose movements sweep your mind, and likely your own hands and feet, along with the music, which I feel outshines anything else this show offers (really, I'm no good at following stories told through dance, and only slightly less worse at catching the lyrics of the songs).  It is a broad scope, but throughout it all, you feel the emotions shown on that stage, and you'll definitely crack a smile and get goosebumps as the show carries on.

A mild gripe I have, though it might be our TV (an LCD) or our DVD player, but you can see lines and flicker of the sort that you might expect on an analog broadcast.  Still, these are rarely noticed (mostly during the opening text, the flamenco intro, and subtitles), as the rest of the performance is so fluid that there's no chance to catch any interlace.  There was also a levels-of-light effect akin to altitude mapping as I fast-forwarded, but this sort of thing occurred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FFVIIAC/dp/B000K4WLXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FFVIIAC</a>&nbsp;on normal play, so for when it occurred, this is a non-issue.  Speaking of fast-forwarding, the segments seem to be broken into ranges rather than individual pieces, so if you want to scoot past the singing, you should fast-forward, in case it's the middle of that segment; the scene listings on the back of the box (synonymous with the VHS box, as other text) doesn't fully match up with the in-DVD titleage, but a quick look into the section should give one a point of reference, so another non-issue.  All in all, the video quality at least matches, though likely supersedes, the video I remember from our VHS.  To boot, it's widescreen, which gives you even more scope of the lines of dancers.  Oh, and there's native stereo sound along with a couple surround sound options (one being Dolby Digital).

Ah, I remember in another reviewer's take on the performance itself that they were disappointed with the editing job done.  To a degree, I agree, since the constant switching of angle to angle somewhat disrupts the scope the stage allows.  However, watching it again, I feel the clips work in tandem with the energy and the focus at any point in time, and while at first something that happens through the stage (for example, three male dancers doing toe-touches one after the other) isn't apparent due to focus on an active member, but things like this are given a full-scene shot, so you see the effect at least once, with the addition of seeing the motions up close.  Plus, you can't beat those pan shots of the lines.

Ah, and bonus content.  This is all relegated to the second disc, and includes a documentary of Riverdance's first ten years (1994-2004), a documentary of their experience in China (also 2004), and an interview that I haven't yet watched.  The documentaries (which overlap at least once, to my bemusement) really give you a feel for the creators and casts of the various troupes and their performances, which could only make watching the first disc more emotionally drawing.  For a single show, these bonuses cover a lot, and make me want to see the other performances throughout the years.  You'll hear the finale music over and over, but the sheer energy of it and the dancing in tune never gets old.

Riverdance is a powerful force, if nowhere else then with the movements and sounds of few to many people visually demonstrating the power of the musical compositions, and to finally see this showing brought to DVD so well is a pipe dream for me.  If you have the money, and you love music, dancing, or, hell, even singing that transcends any brought to film or stage, get a Riverdance DVD, with this one being my own recommendation to start (or continue) in a love for this blend that plucks your excitement out and throws it back into you.  You'll dance a jig for sure...at least if no one's watching, eh?",1214179200,31,5663,5.063440860215054
3277606,5,B000ZOT8NG,"I had not been exposed to the phenomenon of Riverdance before.  I had heard about the amazing performances given around the globe by this dance company, but this DVD was my first real exposure.  I have to say I saw totally blown away by the skill, visual and total sensual experience of this DVD.  The dancers and musicians were awesome.

This DVD was almost like two performances in one.  You had the dance and you had the music.  The orchestra performed a couple of songs that can standalone in my book as some of the best music -- sort of new age in nature.  In fact it reminded me a bit of Yanni or John Tesh at times.  But it would harken back to the Irish tones and bring you back home to its roots.

The dancers and singers were just wonderful.  The solo artists had the most crisp and clear voices I've heard in quite some time.  The principal dancers for the company clearly enjoyed their art -- dancing quite challenging pieces with smiles on their faces and a love of dance written all over them.  One can only imagine the amount of time it has taken to perfect this dance -- totally in step with each other and in harmony with the music.  The segment that mixed a bit of street dance with the traditional Riverdance format was lively and demonstrated the universal nature of dance to culture.

I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves music and dance.  You don't have to be Irish to appreciate the craftsmanship that has gone into making this DVD and the Riverdance company.  It is just amazing.",1203292800,42,1520,4.413669064748201

3277633,1,B000ZOT8NG,"Oh, how I wanted to like this.  But the editing is horrendous.  So many quick cuts, forcing attention away from the dancing feet, just when they start getting interesting.  There were so many rapid-fire angle changes that it nauseated me, and destroyed the natural rhythms and dramatic arcs of the choreography itself, which is what I was really hoping to get to see.  This was cut like an action movie.  It made it impossible to really see any of what I presume to be fantastic dancing.  The producer, director, and editors need to go back to school and study up on how to frame shots and edit dance footage for film.",1419465600,2,618,4.5225225225225225

3277640,5,B000ZOT8NG,I enjoyed the disk very much and am very impressed at how well conditioned the dancers are.,1407974400,,91,4.411764705882353
3277641,4,B000ZOT8NG,"This is our favorite program of the Irish dance programs that have gained such popularity. It gets four stars only because it is SD and the audio is okay, but isn't on par with blue-ray or more modern audio formats. The story, the dancing, and the musicians in this make it must see - and the ONE to see, if you could only choose one.",1407456000,,334,4.153846153846154
3277642,4,B000ZOT8NG,"This was a gift for my mother who loves music and dance.  She enjoyed this, but I think it's difficult to capture a large production like Riverdance on a DVD.  The sights and sounds are great!",1405468800,,192,4.305555555555555
3277643,5,B000ZOT8NG,I really enjoyed the Riverdance when it first came on TV and could not wait to get the DVD. I finally found it here and love the show as much as the first time. So do my kids.,1398816000,,175,3.6315789473684212
3277644,5,B000ZOT8NG,"I had this on VHS years ago, and I have always loved it!!  This is a great show. Wonderful music, amazing dancing, and a fantastic cultural display that spans the globe!! My kids thoroughly enjoyed it's they had never seen such synchronization of dance.",1396656000,,253,4.75
3277645,4,B000ZOT8NG,The DVD came in great conditions. I would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of the Riverdance Show in Radio City,1395878400,,113,4.181818181818182
3277646,5,B000ZOT8NG,Recorded in New York it's the best.  Would have loved to see this one in person but glad to have it on DVD-already had it on VHS.  We saw a smaller company in person and they were very good also. Jean Butler and Colin Dunne are the best and the lead vocalists sound great together.,1393027200,,281,4.090909090909091
3277647,5,B000ZOT8NG,"Very pleasant to watch.  Both discs are worthwhile. I bought this some time ago, and I still dig it out of my collection to view it again.  Even though I have watched it many times, I still enjoy it a lot.  The Riverdance production was just remarkable.  A worthwhile addition to any collection.",1391299200,,295,4.509433962264151
3277648,4,B000ZOT8NG,"Good,but not great. The filming again here took much away from the great talents involved in the dance. If you want the same effect as a live show I highly recommend Fleet of Flames, which was filmed with great ability, not missing one detail of any of the great dances.",1388707200,,270,4.42
3277649,5,B000ZOT8NG,"Supreb!  Exciting!  Fun!  Dramatic!  This is a must for any fan of dance, Celtic music, or really anyone wh can recognize sheer genius.

My wife is decidedly NOT a fan of Celtic culture, yet she was instantly mesmerized.  Family-friendly, joy melded to music.  Get this if you love to be stirred and lifted.",1388448000,,307,4.679245283018868
3277650,5,B000ZOT8NG,"I enjoyed the Irish dance along with the American tap dancing in this video, it held my interest throughout the video. I enjoyed the singing and thought that went into making this video, I look forward to seeing more offered in the future.",1377475200,,239,4.5813953488372094
3277651,4,B000ZOT8NG,This is a great show that Colin did a great job in Michael's place. I love the variety between Irish dance and the US tappers.,1369958400,,126,4.08
3277652,5,B000ZOT8NG,The companion DVD on the history of Riverdance is very entertaining and provides excellent background information. The two DVD's make it a bargain buy.,1368144000,,151,5.333333333333333
3277653,4,B000ZOT8NG,"Although this was not the Riverdance I grew up watching, still have it on VHS, this DVD was still a good show to watch. Main reason why I bought it was because it still had Jean Butler in it, who I love to watch! This DVD will be sufficient until the one with Michael Flatley comes out!",1368144000,,286,4.035087719298246
3277654,5,B000ZOT8NG,SUPER GREAT WONDERFUL COOL NICE WOW SOO GOOD I WISHED IT HAD ORDERED IT SOONER MY LOVES IS MY DOGGIE AND KITTY,1368144000,,110,4.045454545454546
3277655,2,B000ZOT8NG,"No power. No joy. Did not move me.
Too many dance styles mixed together, allowing too short a time for each.
Dancers went through their motions without the passion that their dancing deserved.",1366329600,,192,4.848484848484849
3277656,5,B000ZOT8NG,This show was fabulous. Can't wait to order the remaining series. My wife and I just love watching them dance.,1365724800,,110,4.55
3277657,5,B000ZOT8NG,This DVD was purchased for my parents; they have alway loved Riverdance: Live from Radio City Music Hall more than any other Riverdance.,1365552000,,136,4.956521739130435
3277658,5,B000ZOT8NG,Great music and greate dancing--truly an inspirational performance by an amazing group of people. I would recommend this to anyone who loves music.,1363564800,,147,5.434782608695652
3277659,4,B000ZOT8NG,"This DVD was ruined by the incessant editing from one camera to another. Several dance routines were almost unwatchable due to changing cameras rapid fire to the point that you could not even decipher what was flying by onscreen. The editor should never be allowed near such a project again.
That said it is still Riverdance, hard as the editor tried to ruin it. Jean Butler has a wonderful chemistry with Colin Dunne that was not there with Michael Flately. The cast was spot on and the audience cheers and roars of approval sucked the viewer into the celebration that is Riverdance.
Everybody had a wonderful time from the cast to the audience and the viewer caught the infectious joy for this spectacular performance.",1363305600,,720,4.814516129032258
3277660,5,B000ZOT8NG,"This is a good dance show, with great music which is a bit loud.  One number after another shows off the skill
of the diversified cast.",1361750400,,135,4.1923076923076925
3277661,4,B000ZOT8NG,"great music and dancing. bought this for my 16 yr. old grand daughter for
her bithday. She is dancer for 12 years",1360800000,,113,4.181818181818182
3277662,4,B000ZOT8NG,"We liked it but accepted it only because we couldn't get MF in the original Riverdance.  I thought the Flamenco dancer and some of the other singers were a distraction from the ""Celtic"" theme.  I could have done without them, not to say that they were bad performers, but just didn't fit into the overall concept.",1360454400,,313,4.571428571428571
3277663,5,B000ZOT8NG,I wish they would record more performances.  I could watch them all day. All performances are so beautiful and artful.,1358380800,,118,4.9
3277664,5,B000ZOT8NG,I cannot say enough how much I love 'Riverdance.' I've had season tickets to Broadway in Los Angeles for 6 years now & Riverdance remains the best production ever. Amazing dancing & music; this is a must buy.,1335398400,,208,4.5
3277665,1,B000ZOT8NG,"This was an interesting show, but it never should have been called Riverdance. It bears no resemblance whatsoever to the real Riverdance. I was terribly disappointed.",1323648000,4,166,5.423076923076923
3277666,5,B000ZOT8NG,"This is another great and entertaining disc from Riverdance.  The dancing is always superb and so is the music.  Riverdance is so different than any other entertainment venue in America.  I think that is why it is such a big hit, and not just here.  Everyone is truelly talented.",1307145600,,279,4.63265306122449
3277667,5,B000ZOT8NG,"I have loved the program since I first saw it on a PBS station here in the DC area. While this is not the same program as that one was, it still was very good and the addition of the tap dance face-off added to the show. It does have a few problems but they are minor and can be ignored with no problem.

If you life Riverdance this is a good disc to get.",1304380800,,355,3.7333333333333334
3277668,5,B000ZOT8NG,"Riverdance brings out the very best of Irish Dancing. This dancing has much energy in it that the audience can feel as they hear and watch the production. In the DVD bonus documentry, we are told that this dancing energy is sexy. But it is also very much clean and inspiring.",1304380800,,275,4.411764705882353
3277669,5,B000ZOT8NG,"We loved the original Riverdance tape (yes, it was that long ago!) and this DVD, without Michael, is great.  There are new songs and people and more of a story line than the original.  Very enjoyable.",1302825600,,200,4.527777777777778
3277670,5,B000ZOT8NG,"I have seen parts of this show before on PBS, but it was interuppted by a pledge break.  I know it's not the same as the original one from Ireland, but it has some of the memorable numbers from the original show.  NBC aired a skating special called Riverdance on Ice and it reminded me how much I liked this show.  I look forward to watching this many times.",1302393600,,358,4.159420289855072
3277671,4,B000ZOT8NG,"I have seen the New York performance before. That is why I specifically ordered this version. I was looking forward to showing some friends the magic of this performance with Colin Dunne. I wasn't expecting a VERY LONG ad for the BBC.
If I wanted to see how ""great"" the BBC is I'd watch the BBC. It totally breaks the mood of the Riverdance experience. The show itself will transform the evening -- take you on a trip across the Ocean and back again. It is different from the other performances partially for this reason. It shows the immigrants that came here and built the life that we,their grateful decendents now have. It shows what they left,what they brought with them, and what they found. We have a rich heritage. It is a beautiful way to teach. A beautiful way to learn.
Without the BBC.",1273449600,,797,4.503448275862069
3277672,5,B000ZOT8NG,"Prior to ordering this I read the reviews, which, on a whole, were mostly positive.  But there was one aspect of this DVD that others were mentioning negatively; it was the way it was shot from different camera angles, and the main complaint was there was a lot of darting around, as though the viewer could never fully absorb the scene.  Well I just ordered it anyway because I love the show so much, and I'm happy to report that I had no problem with any ""darting around"" of camera angles, and sat just as mesmerized with this production as I did with the original one at the Point Theater in Ireland.  The cast is stellar, you just want to jump up there with them; Colin Dunne is superb (I thought I'd be heartbroken with the abscence of Michael Flatley, and all due respect to Michael, Colin did a wonderful job); Jean Butler is simply ever-beautiful, you cannot resist her; Maria Pages, you're in sheer awe watching her; and Katie McMahon has that one-in-a-million pure voice that's simply her own.  I can go on, and almost did, but, in a nutshell, if you have any fears of not enjoying this for whatever reason, well you can lose those fears, as it's totally enjoyable.",1272931200,9,1175,4.502347417840376
3277673,5,B000ZOT8NG,"I can watch this over and over. The music, the dance, the beauty is breath-taking.",1264291200,,82,4.533333333333333
3277674,4,B000ZOT8NG,"I agree to some extent with other reviews already given, but would like to offer my own spin on both the Dublin and New York versions of Riverdance: they are different and they are both superb.  The show evolved between the Dublin production and the years-later, New York performance.  I haven't seen this 2-DVD (NY) edition, so I can't comment on the special features.  I'm hoping that either or both productions will be made available on Blu-ray. (At the time of writing, Amazon's product listing is a little confusing: this listing comes up in a search for Riverdance Blu-ray, but does not appear to be in Blu-ray format.)

I've watched both the Dublin and NY performances several times, and enjoy both greatly.  Both performances and recordings have aspects that I prefer, and other aspects I consider slightly less than optimum.  They are different enough and both are such compelling productions that we watch them alternately.  I'm glad that the producers of the videos released both productions.

Regarding the music and dance content of the two productions, they are both superb, and choosing one over the other would be nearly impossible.  The dancing is incredible in both.  Michael Flatley (Dublin) brings the greater technical and athletic intensity to his performances, but Colin Dunne (NY) brings his own unique and appealing talents to the dance.  Overall, I slightly prefer the vocal and choral work in the NY performance.  In the case of instrumental performances, again, all are outstanding, though I slightly prefer one or another of the analogous performers in the two productions.  Davy Spillane's performances (Dublin) are unmatched in pathos and depth.  One view of this is that you wouldn't go far wrong choosing either.  But if you choose both, you will be rewarded.

Some reviewers of the New York recording have noted heavy-handed video editing.  The first time we watched it, my wife and I reacted the same way: the rapid changes in perspective and focus drove us crazy.  On subsequent viewings, the editing seems acceptable and even somewhat natural.  When one attends a performance like this, one's attention typically flits around among overall and specific focus.  While I prefer editing of a performance video to be a little less obtrusive, this editing gives an overall impression of the performance, if you can roll with the editor's decisions.  I find the stage sets, lighting, videography, and editing of the Dublin production to be more in harmony with the program's content.

I would add a moderate criticism of the DVD of the NY production: the sound recording quality is very good but not great.  The high frequency content is strongly de-emphasized.  For example, the fiddle and some of the sharper percussion instruments lack ""bite"" and the high chimes visible in the video are almost completely inaudible.  If a blu-ray format is undertaken, I hope this could be corrected.  I have the Dublin performance on VHS, and I prefer the sound quality.

If you haven't seen Riverdance, forget the nuances and see it in some form or other!  If you become a Riverdance fanatic like me, get both productions, and see the live show, too!!",1263168000,,3171,5.011472275334608
3277675,1,B000ZOT8NG,"Sure, the dancing is phenomenal.  But the rapid-fire editing destroys the continuity of the dancing and leaves you disoriented and unsettled.  The editor thought he was the star of the show.  WRONG!  It is the dancers.  Shame on the editor who decided to make his work front row center and in the process destroyed a wonderful performance.",1260230400,9,339,4.87719298245614
