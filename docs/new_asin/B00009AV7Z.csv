1882852,5,B00009AV7Z,I am a Navy submariner's wife. This one hour program shows what it is REALLY like and shows the life on board without all the PR baloney. Lots of great stuff that I and my family and friends had never seen or heard about. A dramatic story also. It had me in tears. I am proud of my husband and others like him.,1045440000,5,310,3.9365079365079363

7990642,1,B00009AV7Z,"Basic plot is a US sub is on its way back to base where the captain is to face a court martial for hitting a Russian sub. They are suddenly being pursued by another Russian sub that's been taken over by terrorists. The  U.S. crew now has to save the world.

Within the first 20 minutes I am rolling my eyes so much they hurt. Here are just some of the outrageous scenes.

First off a captain facing court martial is relieved of duty, yet this captain is still in command.

JAG officer on board - Lieutenant Heather Mitchell - She has long hair cascading down her back which no naval female would have. Her uniform is 2 sizes to big and looks like she got dressed in her hamper. She has on a pair of pearl dangling earrings like she was going to some party. which are clearly against Navy regs.

Captain - Instills no discipline. He is given ultimatums by ""Lieutenant"" Heather Mitchell, in front of his XO and crew members. His own XO argues about his orders in front of the crew. At one point the captain orders the boat to dive, Lt. JAG storms in demanding why she was not consulted prior to the dive.

During dinner, a LTJG calls a LCDR a dumb a$$ to his face in front of the Captain. Neither the Captain nor the LCDR does anything. But what can you expect from a captain who sits in his cabin drinking a snifter filled with brandy mixed with scotch while on duty. No captain of a US Navy vessel would tolerate anything near this level of insolence. If this was a comedy, I could let it slide, but this movie is billed as action.

The movie is a sad joke. They could not even get the passing of orders right. The captain orders 20 degrees down on the planes. In the very next scene, the officer tells the crew member ""5 degrees on the planes"". In another scene one of the crew is calling off depths as the boat is going down and he says passing 1600 while in the camera shot the depth gauge shows 1026.

If you want to see a good submarine thriller, get Hunt for Red October or Crimson Tide.",1332633600,4,1993,4.198952879581152
7990643,1,B00009AV7Z,"This movie is trash... it is an insult to the Submarine Service with so many errors it would be hard to count them all. They obviously forgot to get a technical consultant... pure rubbish, don't spend a dime on this one.",1168128000,,220,4.390243902439025
7990644,2,B00009AV7Z,"The VHS recieved was a pirated copy! Black and White case covers, nothing like the photo. The tape wasn't even rewound when I received it. Basically I received an illeagle copy of this product.",1163030400,,193,4.705882352941177
7990645,1,B00009AV7Z,"I grabbed this movie while I was deployed in Iraq from a vendor on the street, and once I finished watching it, I had to check online to make sure it was actually made in the US. This was by far and away to most HORRIBLE sub movie I have ever seen---and I have seen most of them. The acting was completely flat, the plot was non-existant, and whoever they hired as a technical advisor should be shot. The uniforms were either wrong or poorly cared for, the verbiage and pronounciation of sub jargon and medical terms was off, and the appearance of the crew was nothing like what you would find in the real world----a sumbariner with a BEARD?---Ummm---NO!

If you enjoy sub movies, this is one to stay far away from-----very far away.",1140998400,8,733,4.42962962962963
7990646,2,B00009AV7Z,"Story was interesting, BUT...lame acting and I hate movies dealing with the military that show military members with hair longer than the military would allow and uniforms looking like they were slept in/worn for a few months, not to mention portray lame military bearing and custom/courtesy. Course having spent twenty years in the military this is a sore subject for me with many military films.",1133913600,6,397,5.123076923076923
7990647,2,B00009AV7Z,"While this film looks and sounds very much like a documentary on Submarines, its merely a mediocre drama that deals with terrorists and a hijacked Russian nuclear Sub!! If this sounds like your bag then this film could be for you. I thought it to be an interesting Documentary but found I was wrong. It was just packaged to appear that way.",1070582400,15,340,4.5
