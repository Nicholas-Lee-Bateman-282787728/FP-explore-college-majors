2129104,5,B0002WYU2U,"Max and Ruby is a Canadian-American animated series that is aimed at a preschool audience.

Created by children's book author/illustrator Rosemary Wells and based on the world of her Max and Ruby books, the episodes present stories about Max, a rambunctious and determined three-year-old rabbit, and his big sister, Ruby, a patient, goal-oriented, sometimes restrictive seven-year-old rabbit.

According to Rosemary Wells on the Nick Jr. website, ""Max & Ruby celebrates the relationship between Ruby and her younger brother, Max, and the universal nature of sibling relationships.""

Each episode consists of three self-contained vignettes. Within each, Ruby is typically engaged in some sort of project or activity (which usually involves Max whether he's willing to participate or not), while Max has a particular interest of his own which either runs counter to his sister's or distracts her. Generally, Max's dialog within each story is usually limited to just one word or a two word phrase, which he repeats periodically for the rest of the episode until the end, sometimes saying a different word (or on rare occasions a full sentence[citation needed]).

Since he only uses the same word when communicating, what he is trying to say is often misinterpreted. By the end of the story, Max usually ends up helping Ruby in some way, to her benefit and delight, or outsmarts her when she is trying to restrict him. Their parents are never seen or mentioned although there is a family photo hanging in the entry room, however, their grandmother makes regular appearances.

""Max's Christmas""
Ruby is excited for Santa Clause on Christmas eve but Max asks questions like ""Who?"" ""When?"" ""Why"". (But mostly: ""WHY"") That night Max wants to see Santa, but Ruby won't let him stay up. Max still believes that he should see Santa and goes downstairs. Ruby notices him out of bed and shoos him back to his room. Max then secretly goes back downstairs and after falling asleep he wakes up to find Santa Claus coming with their gifts. After asking Santa many questions Santa Claus leaves their gifts with Max and disappears. The next day Ruby is shocked to see that Max wasn't in his bed and was sleeping downstairs. She doesn't see the gifts, but Max reveals them to Ruby under his blankets and the episode ends with Max saying ""Because.""",1341964800,5,2327,5.002583979328166
