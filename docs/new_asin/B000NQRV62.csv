8180792,4,B000NQRV62,"My boys (4 yrs and 2 yrs) love this video. Love is an understatement. They watch it over and over. They watched the episode ""Harold in the Dark"" and now are scared every night when they go to bed. The point of the episode, not to be scared of the dark, was lost on them. All they saw is the ghosts and now they're scared.",1441065600,,321,3.953846153846154
8180793,5,B000NQRV62,"This is a wonderful series of little programs.  Stays true to the Harold books with wonderful music and animation.  Addresses many childhood issues, including the death of a goldfish, the difficulties of having a real dog instead of a stuffed one, with great sensitivity.",1428451200,,271,5.136363636363637

8180796,5,B000NQRV62,I love Harold and the Purple Crayon.  I buy Harold for every birthday party or baby shower. Special memories watching Harold with my grandsons as they grew. Every child should experience Harold and the Purple Crayon and let their imagination soar!,1319846400,,247,5.024390243902439
8180797,5,B000NQRV62,"The kids love Harold, but the production values of this HBO series is exceptional enough for adults to watch, and I find myself drawn in myself.  Harold himself is a very quiet, understated character, unlike many characters in popular children's media; he lacks the usual shrill voice or frenetic demeanor or tired theme songs.  The plots of these episodes vary but the emphasis, like the Crockett Johnson books, is on the simplicity of the purple crayon and Harold's imagination.  I wish more episodes could have been produced, but the ones done in this limited series at least stay true in spirit to the purity of innocence, whimsy, and fancifulness of a child's imagination.",1308528000,,677,4.9734513274336285
8180798,5,B000NQRV62,Harold is awesome!  We love every episode.  Unlike other kid show we love to watch this one as a family.  He is so cute.,1307836800,,120,3.9166666666666665
8180799,5,B000NQRV62,"My son loves Harold! This is his second tape and he watches them all the time. I really like it for him to watch before bed, it helps settle him down. The cute imagination is great!",1252800000,2,181,4.055555555555555
8180800,5,B000NQRV62,"My granddaughter (who is almost 3) loves this movie! This way, she can watch her favorite television show even when it is not being broadcast.",1246924800,,142,4.72
8180801,5,B000NQRV62,"This DVD features Sharon Stone as narrator and includes the following episodes from the HBO Family series:
1. Harold's Birthday Gift
2. A Blast from the Past (Dinosaurs)
3. Harold the Artiste
4. Harold's Walk on the Wild Side (Penguins & Monkeys)

This is one of the only shows my 2-3 year old boy will watch, and Sharon Stone does an amazing job with the stories.
