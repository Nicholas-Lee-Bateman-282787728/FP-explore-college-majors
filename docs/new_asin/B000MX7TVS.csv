2750802,5,B000MX7TVS,"Great concept, mixing old footage and new with old bandmembers. Really great numbers too, from The King!

Better than just listening to a CD, turn on the Surround Sound and crank it up!",1175644800,,185,4.606060606060606
2750803,5,B000MX7TVS,"I own the DVD The 25th Anniversary Concert ""Live"" and it is the best video ever from Elvis.  I like his concert DVD's.  Although I like anything that Elvis is in.  So you won't go wrong by buying the DVD.",1175126400,6,204,4.05
2750804,5,B000MX7TVS,I too sayw this on PBS and then bought it. Really COOL!! A must have for the Elvis DVD collection. It is neat to see the younger generation getting to see what the King is all about while using a bit different band style. Fun to watch and worth the time at the least.,1173744000,12,267,3.962962962962963
2750805,5,B000MX7TVS,"I was at the 1997 show and the 2001 show in Memphis. They were great. This DVD captures the essence of the ""Elvis the Concert"" shows and does so with great sound and in great picture. Honestly, watching it is very close to being there in person. Elvis never sounded better. I wish they would release a companion CD. It's great seeing Elvis players together again and as brilliant as ever. This is a great release. Thank you EPE for putting it together and finally releasing it to the public. What strikes you is just how timeless Elvis and his music really is. No other singer could do a show like this and seem as fresh and modern as Elvis does. This DVD won't disappoint. Elvis lives!",1173139200,95,686,4.409448818897638

2750840,2,B000MX7TVS,"BETTER CHOICE IS '''THATS THE WAY IT IS'' , EXCELLENT QUALITY.
THIS ONE HAS ALOT OF HIS GROUP TALKING, SOME VIDEO CLIPS WERE FUZZY AND SOME CLEAR...
When its clear its amazing, The sound is excellent STILL ''THE BEST OF CDs IS ""THATS THE WAY IT IS""
''That's the way it is''  is even  better then when I saw him in LIVE in  New York,  unfortunately that's all we can get  from 1970 .
Who was to know we would go crazy looking for more ELVIS ELVIS ELVIS  because he was to die 7 years later.
I look at  ""that's the way it is"" and I feel so sad that this beautiful man got so sick and died so young.
This  CD has to much video of the background musicians during his concert. That should have been cut down by 50%.
Its almost like listening to a sound recording more then a concert video.
Basically its all we have of Elvis so if we want more of Elvis then this is the way it really is.",1439164800,2,882,3.971590909090909
2750841,2,B000MX7TVS,"They really should have left out ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"" as he messed this song up too bad. Secondly, there should never have been the musicians on stage over playing the accompaniment to ""Steamroller Blues"" from the ""Aloha Hawaii"" concert. It Ruined IT!!!!!! THEY SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE ORIGINAL IN THE SATALITE CONCERT ALONE!!! THE OLD SAYING ""IF IT IS NOT BROKE DON'T FIX IT!!
IT WAS AMAZING HOW THEY HAVE AGED IN ALL THESE YEARS. One who was missing was the Rhythm Guitar player .  The songs at the end were OK!",1435449600,2,516,4.548387096774194

2750844,3,B000MX7TVS,"I was slightly disappointed as I didn't realize I was getting a DVD of the show and not the actual show itself.  I am sure the concept was as dynamic and powerful as people say it was...wish I could have seen it.  The interviews and cuts were very disruptive while watching and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  I am glad I paid such a low price.  Until an actual DVD of the performance becomes available, I wouldn't waste my money.",1433289600,,436,4.345679012345679

Interesting to see the old and new footage blended together in one cohesive ""performance.""  Many great songs, and sometimes you forget Elvis is not performing live on this DVD, but rather 25-plus years ago.  His passion, sense of humor and tremendous talent playing various musical styles are on display.

The way they arranged this dvd and had most of the original people who sang and played instruments with him were awesome. It really sounded just as good as I remember him singing when he was alive.

2750944,1,B000MX7TVS,"I regret buying this.  The entire DVD has subtitles, which detract from enjoying the music.  Between songs there are conversations with former band members which break the mood of enjoying a concert. It is poor videos of old Elvis concerts.  You would do better to just buy a CD.",1248220800,4,279,4.653061224489796
2750945,5,B000MX7TVS,"I have viewed this concert several times and each time I have thoroughly enjoyed it. It really made me believe that Elvis does still live. When attending concerts unless we are seated in the first rows we tend to watch the performers on the big screen therefore for most people in the audience Elvis was performing live in this concert.
Watching on TV the editing was so good that a viewer could not detect the difference between Elvis on tape or when he was actually on the stage with the other musicians.  Having the split screen with the musicians in the past and live was so cleverly done. When Elvis turned around and mischieviously smirked at the other musicians you really could believe that he was actually performing live in this concert.
I have been buying this concert as gifts because I really feel it will be a treasure in any DVD collection. Visitors to my home, who have watched this concert say they want to own it too and I have given them the ordering information.",1244678400,,982,4.548022598870056

Very little, she said, we rarely heard his music. I started to tell her about watching  his last performance on TV. About how sad it was, how heavy he looked. He couldn't remember some of the lyrics to the songs he had sung hundreds of times. It was troubling. He was the King! About Graceland and the millions of followers, young and old from all walks of life. I wasn't a big Elvis fan, but I had respect for what he had accomplished as a singer,actor and his time in the millitary. I went on line and searched for the best DVD that would help me show my wife the true Elvis. My wife is an Elvis fan now! This DVD is amazing.",1236038400,3,776,4.038961038961039
2750947,3,B000MX7TVS,"I was rather disapointed with this DVD. I'm sure that to actually be at one of these reunion concerts would be great, but on the recording, there is entirely to much talking.

2750949,5,B000MX7TVS,"this is a perfect choice I made; the juxtaposition of films of Elvis' past live performances with the live orchestra, back-up singers and musicians is brilliant!

I am a long time Elvis fan and this to me as far as the dvd version is concerned is a tribute to the ones that put this together. It was irritating tryin to take in what is supposed to be a you are there experience, to be interrupted ever 10 seconds with them breaking in and talking over the songs with camera on them not Elvis ,and everyother sentence from Elvis  camera keeps going off onto the others. Am very dissapointed with camera work,,music is the only plus great sound,but you're better just turning picture off and just listening.it had great promise too bad they screwed it up back patting themselves",1196899200,6,702,4.358778625954199
2750956,5,B000MX7TVS,I was absolutely thrilled with Elvis Lives!  It was extremely interesting to see all the members of his former band together again.  Bittersweet to see them perform 'with Elvis' not actually being there.  Definitely something I would recommend any Elvis fan to watch - it is enjoyable.,1194825600,,285,5.0212765957446805

He was more of a personality than a musician.  He played other people's songs.  Never wrote tunes so he has that Sinatra type fame.  He was more of artist that interprets other people's tunes.",1190851200,,364,4.553846153846154

IT COMBINES ORIGINAL VEDIO FOOTAGE OF ELVIS CONCERTS WITH THE MUSIC AND BACKGROUND SINGING BEING DONE ""REAL TIME"" BY THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WERE AT THE CONCERTS.  IT IS VERY INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THE PEOPLE LOOKED THEN AND HOW THEY LOOK NOW.  THE MUSIC AND SINGING IS NOTHING SHORT OF FANTASTIC.

2750962,4,B000MX7TVS,I was at this 25th Anniversary concert in Memphis (3rd row from the front) so for me this is a huge reminder of a very special night & concert.  But a lot is actually missing & I don't think it needed to be.  There was a segment with Elvis' early recordings & a segment of clips & music from his movies.  We saw the best of Elvis' whole music career that night.  But the 'gospel section' where the backup singers do a couple of numbers of their own is also missing and I recall that was awesome!  But for anyone who couldn't go to & has never seen an Elvis concert this is a very good DVD to watch.  But I also found the picture quality in some of the Las vegas concerts seemed out-of focus and think that could have been improved.  But for me this is a trip down memory lane of a fantastic night & wonderful occasion & I'm just pleased they put this out at all.,1187740800,,862,4.035294117647059
2750963,4,B000MX7TVS,"If you're not a died-in-the-wool fan or are only going to purchase a few Elvis videos, go for the original performances:  That's the Way It Is (Special Edition), Aloha From Hawaii (Special Edition), Elvis on Tour VHS, The Lost Performances VHS (why aren't these two on DVD??), and The Come-Back Special/One Night With You.  TTWII & Aloha show Elvis at the top and are especially awesome!  The special editions of those include the original releases and extra material and are not to be missed.  The ""Elvis Lives"" DVD reviewed here is a unique supplement, but shouldn't be considered a substitute for the above.

This interesting presentation features many of his backup singers and musicians performing live to videos of Elvis from the above performances.  This DVD does include a few new camera angles of Elvis and several songs not on the original releases, but mainly shows that his group was and still is a very talented bunch--much older now.  Notably missing are Charlie Hodge and Kathy Westmoreland--are they with Elvis or still with us?  The DVD also has some interesting commentary.  And, it's nice (I guess) to see that I'm not the only one who has aged over the years!

Elvis hasn't--so just view the originals if you're just discovering him.  If you've never seen them, you are in for a treat.

This was presented in Memphis as a way to try to recapture the feeling of being at a live Elvis concert, and I suppose succeeds as well as could be hoped.  But there's nothing like the real thing, I guess.  The cutting back and forth is distracting, although this DVD is definitely worth having if you're a fan and already have the originals.  It was good to see the crew.  They had to be fantastic to keep up with Elvis, and were!

If I could give the originals 6 or more stars, I'd give this one 5--these are great performances.  Since I can't, it gets 4--but it's good.  I'd forgotten what an awesome job Elvis did on ""How Great Thou Art"" (from the VHS ""Elvis on Tour."")

There's never been anyone like Elvis--this DVD wouldn't have been made otherwise!",1187568000,5,2063,4.662049861495845
2750964,2,B000MX7TVS,"....this is a hard idea to sell ( a full band supporting a video of a long dead singer) and they did it and did it well! the problem is that the egomaniacs like Joe Guercio who was the producer...couldn't keep his sad old face off the screen!  What I mean by that is this concert is set up to try and give the feeling of an actual concert ..with this amazing band led by lead guitarist Rock  n Roll Hall of Famer...James Burton..and it absolutely works!!  The problem is that on the DVD ...these ""participants"" inject themselves into the broadcast between some of the songs and even during some solos AND WHILE ELVIS IS SINGING!!  for me this completely ruins the vibe and pulls me as the viewer OUT of the experience....(plus the verbiage they are spitting out is on  the monotanous 38 minutes of bonus back slapping). I was looking forward to that bonus footage,  but as the afore mentioned James Burton wasn't included ....failed to excite (although Ronny Tutt was nice  to see and hear from)..I also wonder why the  film of ELVIS from ""That's the Way it Is"" is such poor quality...if you have the DVD you will know its gorgeous footage but it looks terrible in this event and much worse than the TV footage from Hawaii...

Elvis completists should love it...and I am not unhappy I own it...I just wish I could have  the experience like being  there at the event and interrupting solos ,Elvis singing with these ""Talking  Heads"" and between songs...JUST PULLS ME OUT of the feel...

He sings with his heart. I love him! They projected him up on a screen above the stage singing (from a previous concert in the 70's) and the actual people who were with him during that partuclar time are all on the stage. So you see band and back up singers when they were younger and on stage current time. They are performing in front of a live audience, so it looks like Elvis is singing with them currntly which makes it look like he's still alive because it looks so current. You will love this DVD!

Of course there are special features which make it even more interesting. Interviews and discussion on the fine tuning that went into the making of this anniversary concert. Oh yes and there is footage from two other concerts also. It captures the magic and the passion one man had for his love of music.",1178928000,2,587,4.88

It looked pathetic to see all these old (but talented) geezers, up there performing with a forever young Elvis. Not only that, but they changed some of the licks they played too. Wonder how Elvis would have liked that. Elvis as a performer was always great, even if he just stood there. But, the best way to see him is in original concert films. Course that's just my opinion.

It is just fantastic to watch all the old band members play his songs it sounds new with elvis' voice on it like a remix .,1176076800,,353,4.130434782608695
2750978,5,B000MX7TVS,"For those of us who never saw Elvis live, I guess this is the closest we will ever come.  Elvis looks great and sounds even better.  The band sounds good and it's a little emotional when toward the end of the show when they play ""How Great Thou Art"" and ""American Trilogy"".  The picture quality is great except for the video footage of Elvis in 1970.  For some reason, the video quality is barely average for the 1970 shows.  On the plus side, the sound is really good and all of the Aloha video footage is really great quality. This is sort of a DVD ""jukebox"" for Elvis videos in the 70's.  People really don't understand how good he really was until they see this video.  For example, most folks don't even know that Elvis sang ""Brige Over Troubled Water"" in 1970.  His version is AWESOME and  blows away Simon and Garfunkle's version.  The version of Suspcious Minds on this DVD is the very best version as well and the song ends with Elvis doing the coolest moves of his career at the end of the song--shaking his  shoulders/chest in tempo with the drums.  Cool stuff really.  ""In the Ghetto"" is also great. This is a DVD you will play over and over agan and it's worth the small price. I stay in shape watching this video.  I get on my treadmill and run while I'm watching the video.

There are really too many highlights to mention.  If you are an Elvis fan, this DVD is essential.  If you are not an Elvis fan, this DVD should convert you.  I would like to attend the 30 year show in Memphis now.  That sounds like fun.",1175904000,18,1526,4.291228070175438

Elvis Lives: The 25th Anniversary Concert DVD Live in Memphis 2007 New & Sealed

This is a horrible concert. The focus should be on the entertainer, particularly, in the case of Elvis. He was a most beautiful man with an incredible voice. No one wants to see old men talking, playing instruments and the accompanying singers over and over..There are a few of Elvis on stage and then it quickly goes back to Elvis in a shot the size of a postage stamp.

The only one to buy is Aloha From Hawaii. It is worth every penny. This not not worth  1.00",1518048000,,560,4.314285714285714
8173280,5,B000MX7TVS,"Well, at first this video sort of freaked me out.  Elvis' backup players are old and it is clear that the footage of Elvis is from vegas, Aloha from hawaii and other concerts.  However, at least the main face and energy on the DVD are Elvis..  The editors did a great job.  I have the 40th Aloha from hawaii dvd and due to the split screen craziness of the time, i saw 6 little Elvis'.  I had the original on Betamax and what a difference.  But this DVD really did put Elvis front and center. Which as an Elvis fan, I want.  Worth every penny!!!!!!!",1516147200,,549,4.171428571428572
