8218717,2,B000VI6SYI,I enjoyed this sampling of British comedy.  Always love Martin Clunes.  He is amazing in being able to transform himself into totally different characters.,1409702400,,155,5.416666666666667
8218718,5,B000VI6SYI,"Of the three, I liked ""Beauty"" the best.  It was a sensitive story about an unusual unfortunate-looking man that had a surprising wonderful ending.",1303776000,,147,5.125
8218719,3,B000VI6SYI,I ordered this DVD because Martin Clunes was featured. Of the three offerings only one was worthwhile. Save your money on this one and order Doc Martin or William and Mary instead.,1287964800,2,180,4.65625
8218720,2,B000VI6SYI,"I am a big fan of Caroline Quentin, and also enjoy Martin Clunes in Doc Martin so I thought - a BBC comedy - I'll try it.  Well the first of the trilogy is more a sad drama (Caroline is VERY good in it)and I did not find any humor. The daughter who wanted to be a son was in no way a comedic plot. The second story with Clunes was, again, a drama and quite interesting.  Not much was funny.  The final part of the trilogy was indeed funny - although I was a bit put off by the picture on the cover.  It worked, it fit the storyline and the acting was good and quite humorous.",1258156800,5,575,3.847457627118644
8218721,3,B000VI6SYI,"In spite of the well known talents of Wilson and Clunes, and in spite of a huge hope of enjoyment, I have to say I was disappointed with this DVD. The stories were acceptable and the acting extremely good, but the overall pleasure I derived from the DVD was minimal - sadly. Martin Clunes' was particularly excellent, but even he couldn't raise this DVD above 'average' status.",1257033600,3,377,4.641791044776119
8218722,5,B000VI6SYI,Really enjoy British comedies.  These programs are extremely well done and character driven.  I am a fan of many of the actors/actresses involved in these programs so that was a big plus.,1243987200,7,187,4.8125
