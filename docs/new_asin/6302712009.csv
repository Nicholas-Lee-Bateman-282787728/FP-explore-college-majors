499128,5,6302712009,"In my opinion, this film is a 99.9% success. The favourite has to be the  icy-cool role of Bruce Payne (Charles Rane; infamous international  terrorist) who fits into the character perfectly using dialogue and facial  features. Wesley Snipes' part sunk a little in this movie, yet judging by  several of his other films, he took a break for this one in particular!  Some of the scenes were predictable, yet 8/10 films are, the plot is of an  ex-secret-service agent, John Cutter (Snipes) who quits his job after his  wife Lisa is killed in a robbery incident which he tries to prevent, as he  is offered back a higher standard job than that of which he is in now,  training flight attendents and night watchmen, he takes a flight to Los  Angeles on the 163 Airline International plane, which, purely by  coincidence, Charles Rane (Bruce Payne) is travelling on. The FBI failed to  tell the airline before Rane boards and so when his trusty henchmen shoot  his guards, he escapes and holds hostage all 200 passengers on board...that  is excepting the man in seat 57, who is the only one who can rescue the  unfortunate passengers on the flight...if you haven't seen the film I  highly reccomend you do, and seeing as i'd hate to ruin the end for you,  i'll leave it here! Please e-mail me on Luceharvey@talk21.com for further  information on the film, ratings or details. Just one last thing...BRUCE  PAYNE IS GORGEOUS!",959040000,,1418,4.737704918032787

499185,4,6302712009,"Four DEADLY Stars. ""Passenger 57"" is the 1992 thriller starring the rising-star at the time headed towards certified action-hero status, Wesley Snipes, in his first apparent solo starring role. In the plot, Snipes stars as troubled security expert, John Cutter, thrust into a deadly situation requiring all of his special skills. And the terror is just getting started for Atlantic International flight 163. Starring Snipes, Bruce Payne, Tom Sizemore, Alex Datcher, Bruce Greenwood, Elizabeth Hurley, Robert Hooks, Michael Horse, Mark Macauiay, Elena Ayala, and Ernie Lively.  This movie was the genesis for well over 2 decades of Wesley Snipes martial arts-action movies and dramas. Music by bassist Stanley Clarke. A Lee Rich Production. Directed by Kevin Hooks.

That's not automatically bad, and anyway what else could it be.  That comment is really meant to be about the material that Wesley had in front of him.  I have come to realize that  the writers, directors, editors and producers have considerable power to influence a pictures end result to be good or bad aside from what the primary actors do in the movie.  I'm basically saying that the material is where the short comings came from for Mr Snipes.",1463011200,,563,4.314285714285714

499460,4,6302712009,"I have this movie, Passenger 57, on video tape and converted on a DVD disc, and it's my favorite movie with Wesley Snipes that I would watch over again to enjoy as much. What I like about this movie is seeing a black man like Wesley Snipes play a good guy and fight bad guys, and that's what Wesley does in this movie, Passenger 57, as far as being a security agent on the plane. I'll never forget when I first saw this movie, because I was seven years old when it first came out, and I liked it Wesley Snipes. I even like the last scene with Wesley fighting the hijacker on the plane, and then kicks him out of the plane. This movie was when I first knew who Wesley Snipes was, and I find that he is a good actor and my favorite one. And this movie, Passenger 57, is what makes Wesley my favorite actor, fighting the bad guys and playing a good guy. I don't like to see Wesley Snipes play a bad guy in movies, so I would do without watching them. Movies like ""New Jack City"" and ""Demolition Man"" are the movies with Wesley playing a bad guy, and I don't want to see him in those movies. And another movie with Wesley Snipes that I don't like is, Sugar Hill, and that right there is also a pretty violent movie with Wesley that I've ever seen. And I really didn't like the Wesley that Wesley Snipes was in that movie. I find this movie, Passenger 57, with him is a even better, and it's totally different from the movie, Sugar Hill, and the other two movies with him that I mentioned I don't like.

And along with watching this movie, Passenger 57, I would watch another movie with Wesley Snipes called ""Blade,"" another action movie from 1998 with Wesley fighting bad guys. I find that movie is similar to this movie, ""Passenger 57. "" And another movie that I would watch along this movie is ""Down In The Delta,"" another 1998 movie with Wesley Snipes and a few other characters. I also find that's another good movie to watch with Wesley Snipes, and it's a movie with family. You don't see much of him in that movie, but he does a play a good character.",1427760000,,2053,4.223918575063613

499463,5,6302712009,Great movie. Old but still great. It was well made with real villains and tough guys. A high jacked plain with the world's most feared terrorist with several accomplish's. Snipes is the Security guy on a business trip. The plot was not outrageously impossible as most action movies seem to be. I think it really is a 5 star movie for entertainment value alone. It just keeps moving along with lots of realistic action.,1426032000,,418,4.662162162162162
499464,3,6302712009,I had this film in my VHS library and enjoyed it many times.  I thought to put it in my Amazon library but before doing so I rented it and determined that it wasn't worth the $12.00 they were asking for it.  It's good action film and Snipes does a very good job as an action figure.  The villan was over the top but he also came through.  The film is predictable and the plot is thin but if you want to see a lot of people being killed and more being kicked around the film comes through.,1425945600,,488,3.9489795918367347

The silly sheriff casually pouring coffee right after hearing that the plane was highjacked. The grandma saying ""Woo woo"" cause Snipes looks like Arsenio Hall. Talk about dating the movie with that. And Snipes played the grieving husband of a murdered wife, how original right. That said, 57 isn't a trainwreck. Pretty decent action scenes but not on par with blockbusters from the era. I'll bet on red.",1404172800,,565,4.957894736842105

499639,5,6302712009,"Now this is a great action movie that I won't cross his path or upset him, On a plane minding his own business and they have to do the wrong thing by overtaking the airplane or hijacking as we know it now, He retires to the rest room and returning back to his seat he finds things are not the same as before and being an undercover operative must start thinking of some smart ideas as to get out of trouble that everyones in. He has got a choice but the odds outnumber him and the passengers so there is no way out, plus no hope. There might be some hope or is there. Who will succeed them or him you'll have to wait and see for yourself. He does have a bad attitude with some other bad issues so having him there isn't going to be good news for the terrorist. Storyline is fantastic plus the cast create a brilliant  performance that will have you racing around in knots and blowing your mind as to what's going on next. I rated this an A grade plus for the fast paced action with thrills and spills from beginning to end, excellent entertainment. Now it's time for the popcorn so get comfortable rest and relax on your chair, forget about putting your feet up you won't have time plus forget about the relaxing thats gone too.

499678,3,6302712009,"If you ask me, it's pretty cool that Wesley Snipes decided to become a karate action star. For one thing, he didn't need to, having already received plenty of acclaim for his dramatic roles in fare like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Jack-City/dp/B0041QSZS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Jack City</a>, so I like to think that it's as much as a passion thing as anything else for him to throw kicks onscreen. Also, while I don't want to limit him to a subcategory based on his ethnicity, he was pretty much the only credible black martial arts star to make it in the movies within almost twenty years, what with Jim Kelly and Ron van Clief having all but given up the game years earlier and leaving only the charismatic but somewhat underwhelming Fred Williamson to hold down the fort. Of course, ""Passenger 57"" isn't a pure karate flick, but it is a decent action vehicle for Snipes. While it's beneath the adrenaline standard that Seagal and Van Damme were producing at the time, this is still required viewing for fans.

The story: a security specialist (Snipes) finds himself onboard a commercial airliner that's transporting a malicious terrorist (Bruce Payne,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Highlander-Endgame/dp/B004U7MQYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Highlander - Endgame</a>). When the criminal breaks free from his FBI escorts and hijacks the plane with a team of allies, it's up to ""Passenger 57"" to stop him.

This is the first and probably best ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>&nbsp;on a plane"" setup that's yet been put to film. It's pretty cool that the screenwriters found a credible way to get the plane into the air, set it down, and then have it take off again while the action's still on, as most other features would probably let the credits roll after it touched down the first time. The movie's pacing is pretty unique on account of this, and allows there to be a motorcycle scene in the middle of an airplane film. Additionally, a good deal of the plot's credibility is thanks to Bruce Payne, whose villainous character is more capable and fiendishly entertaining than one might expect from this strange Englishman. The acting in general is strong: Snipes performs with as much authority as his reputation demands, Tom Sizemore makes the most out of his action-free supporting role, Alex Datcher does fine, and even lifelong supporting player Ernie Lively (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Showdown-in-Little-Tokyo/dp/6305161992/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Showdown in Little Tokyo</a>) manages to create an entertaining character as the local sheriff.

Though Snipes' later movies would solidify him as one of the better American onscreen fighters, it's surprising that this one's biggest disappointment is its action content. No, it's not dreadful, but it just doesn't stand out: if you asked me to recount the highlights of the movie, I'm not sure I'd remember the fight scenes were I not reviewing it. He has five of these, and while the ones which include actual martial arts choreography tend to be poorly shot, the marginally better ones are basic brawls that almost actor could have staged. There are some interesting turns - Payne's character is such a nutcase that he's unfazed  by a stunned Wesley punching him in the crotch - but the best action scene ends up being Payne's escape from a plastic surgery clinic, which happens early in the film and is likely forgotten by the time it's the feature's over. In light of this, the movie feels like it's missing a vital component: it never had much of a chance of being a classic, but at least one really good karate match would have earned it another star in my review.

I'm disappointed that director Kevin Hooks hasn't done more work in the action genre. He'd deliver improved results in the following year's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Irresistible-Force/dp/6303824374/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Irresistible Force</a>, but since then has largely been stuck in a television career. Still, it's great that Snipes' star rose even higher following this one. If nothing else, I like to watch ""Passenger 57"" for retrospective purposes and take note of how Wesley's since improved. Make no mistake, this can be a pretty entertaining adventure, but as a pure action movie, it's definitely lacking.",1380931200,,4550,5.665689149560118

There are few actors I miss more in a guilty pleasure kind of way than Wesley Snipes.  For almost ten years, from 1989 to 1998 he was a huge star but that changed almost over night and by the early 2000s he was working almost exclusively in the realm of direct to video films and then he went to jail for tax evasion.  There's always the hope of a comeback soon with his upcoming appearance in The Expendables 3 but until then you can enjoy one of his most outrageous action films.

On a flight to Los Angeles airline security trainer and passenger 57, John Cutter (Wesley Snipes) is forced to take on Charles ""The Rane of Terror"" Rane as he escapes FBI confinement and hijacks the flight.  Rane's plan goes goes off without a hitch except he didn't count on passenger 57 being along for the ride.

Passenger 57 is not a particularly original film, even during its release in 1992 it was described as being ""Die Hard on a Plane.""  From the end of the x-ray machine opening to the start of credits Passenger 57 runs an embarrassingly short one hour, seventeen minutes and twenty-eight seconds long.  In that short amount of time Wesley Snipes karate chops terrorists, deals with racist country cops and goes to a county fair all while being as cool as the other side of a pillow.  His opponent, Charles Rane is chillingly portrayed by Bruce Payne.  He is cold, calculating and charming even when he's committing cold blooded murder; he's no Alan Rickman from Die Hard but he's no slouch either.  Other co-stars include Tom Sizemore, Bruce Greenwood and a very young Elizabeth Hurley.

There's nothing that really sets Passenger 57 apart from other action films of the era but that doesn't take away from the fun that can be had watching it.  The most important thing to remember about Passenger 57 is that even though it's completely ridiculous it has one of the most amusing and terribly great lines of dialogue in cinema history and if that doesn't make it worth owning I don't know what is.

The 1080P high definition transfer seen in Passenger 57 is actually quite good especially for a budget release like this.  Black levels and detail are generally good.  Some shot are occasionally soft but that has more to do with the film being shot anamorphically then with any deficiencies with the transfer.  The biggest issue is the video transfer's lack of ""pop"" which seems to be a little flat compared with other films of the day.

As with the video the DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio track is good considering its age and the modest costs associated with producing this Blu-ray.  Dialogue is well centered and clear and the low end is particularly impressive and will give most home theaters a nice boom.  The surround channels are used but at best sparingly which isn't surprising considering the film's age, the sound design limitations of the time and the lack of an expensive remaster.

Unsurprisingly Passenger 57 is a nearly bare bones release with the only special feature (if you don't count Wesley Snipe's karate abilities) being the original theatrical trailer.  It's an amusing trailer and does an effect job showing the HD improvements over something that looks only marginally better than an old DVD transfer.

So should you purchase&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Passenger-57/dp/B00CENXW92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Passenger 57</a>&nbsp;on Blu-ray?  That depends on your appreciation of bad action films and Wesley Snipes.  Both the video and audio are very good and the lack of special features shouldn't surprise anyone or keep them picking up this mostly forgotten action gem.",1377475200,,4393,5.240687679083095

499711,4,6302712009,"""Passenger 57"" is an action movie starring Wesley Snipes. Snipes, fresh off action success in ""New Jack City"", plays John Cutter: a former police officer turned security consultant, he just recently has finished a stint as head of security for a commercial airliner. His trip back home (by plane, of course) is interrupted when FBI agents abruptly bring aboard recently captured terrorist Charles Rane (Bruce Payne).

The extensively connected Rane has managed to have his compatriots infiltrate the plane's staff, and a hijacking takes place. Enter John Cutter. Before the film's end, a series of fistfights, chases and shootouts will take place on a plane, an airport and a carnival.

The steely-eyed Snipes is very convincing as the no-nonsense Cutter, who is given a tragic backstory (a recently deceased wife) and an arsenal of kung-fu moves to help him take on the bad guys. Payne chews up scenery with bombast as the slithery Rane. Supporting characters include Tom Sizemore as Cutter's boss and Ernie Lively as a small-town sheriff. Clever viewers may notice Elizabeth Hurley as part of Rane's crew.

The film is directed by Kevin Hooks, a former actor (TV's ""The White Shadow"") who delivers all the right notes for the action genre. Hooks' father Robert has a bit part here as an FBI agent.

Tracking at 84 minutes, the film moves along at a breezy pace, thankfully eschewing any sort of side-plots that could have dragged things down.",1320624000,,1444,5.004166666666666

There is a shot that bothers me where you see a 1980's Corvette Convertible from afar driving on the road surrounded by water then in the next scene it is a Red Corvette but a 1991!(Yes this is trivial but a big goof, one corvette has the Wheels and different nose/rear and the other has the aero look and ""Cusinart"" wheels!,any Car Guy or Corvette Guy would notice.)Also,the Hick-Exploitation and the jab at republicans from Sizemore,other than this the movie is pretty good even if Snipes is now a TaxCheat(correction was,also part of some weird martial arts cult thing).",1306886400,2,876,4.925675675675675

499749,5,6302712009,"""Passenger 57"" has to be my very favorite Wesley Snipes movie and one of my very favorite action movies ever!

At the height of this movie's popularity producers capitalized on Wesley's image as a strong leading man with the catchphrase: always bet on black. And that totally describes his role and this movie.

Wesley plays John Cutter, a security expert who quit his job as a cop after his girlfriend was shot. And, Bruce Payne portrays Charles Rane the master-terrorist. Although, I thought Charles Rane was more funny than scary. Whose big idea was it to make the British dude with long blonde hair the villain  who tries to go up against Wesley Snipes?

The film also includes some very impressive supporting roles. I especially enjoyed Alex Datcher (doesn't she look just like Halle Berry?) as Marti the tough-talking stewardess. And Elizabeth Hurley was in a somewhat smaller role as Sabrina Ritchie. I loved the part in the beginning when Sabrina says to Marti that she doesn't like her name because ""it makes me sound cold and heartless.""

IMHO the early to mid-90's were the Golden Age of Suspense/Mystery-Action/Thrillers. There were so many great movies in this genre, during this time.

499750,3,6302712009,"1992's ""Passenger 57"" stars a young Wesley Snipes in an early leading role as an air marshal on a plane hijacked by a deadly terrorist and his gang.  The plot, the characters, and the action sequences are adequate if formulaic.  This is decent no-brainer entertainment.

Snipes plays John Cutter, an experienced security officer, who is the extra passenger on an airliner hijacked by master terrorist Charles Rane (played with suitable snarl and menace by Bruce Payne).  Cutter happens to be in the lavatory when Rane and his thugs (including a young Elizabeth Hurley) seize the plane.  Cutter escapes to the cargo compartment, while Rame diverts the plane to an airfield in Lousiana to make his demands.

The plot is somewhat contrived, calling for Cutter to get off the plane to alert the authorities (and deal with skeptical local law enforcement), then get back on the plane to confront the terrorists.  Cutter is determined, adaptive, and a first-rate martial artist, supporting an action-packed finish to the movie.

This movie is recommended to Wesley Snipes fans and to those seeking undemanding action entertainment.",1190505600,,1125,5.176795580110498
499751,3,6302712009,"Wesley Snipes does DIE HARD (or LETHAL WEAPON sans a partner) in this entertaining but absolutely formulaic action-adventure outing. Another in the genre of the ""Lunchpail Superman"" movies that have proven so popular, Snipes plays a recently-retired (of course) covert government anti-terrorist agent (of course) who finds his dream vacation of a lifetime (of course) interrupted by A Few Bad Men (of course) who want to take a commercial jetliner bye-bye for foggy reasons of their own (of course). If you've seen the above-referenced films you will recognize PASSENGER 57, which samples the action in them quite freely and unashamedly. That's okay, because the film works well within its own limited expectations.

The surprises in this film are few, but memorable. The yummy Elizabeth Hurley plays one of the terrorists. The action takes place at an airport in rural Louisiana, and, thank the Script Gods, actually portrays the local Sheriff as a racist jerk good ol' boy, not as a redeemed cracker choirboy.

Hollywood loves to wear a formula to death.

Wesley Snipes (White Men Can't Jump, New Jack City) stars as a top security consultant for airlines who gets mixed up in an airplane hijacking with the most dangerous terrorist in the world.

The terrorist, Charles Rane, well-played by Bruce Payne is very nasty and clever. Snipes is the typical indestructible adversary (he can jump out of a speeding plane without being hurt).

Director Kevin Hooks keeps the energy level high. Writers David Loughery and Dan Gordon keep things interesting, with a lot of action on the ground as well as in the air. All of the minor characters are interesting too. Mark Irwin's photography is very good and the stunts and special effects are excellent.

The film is probably too violent for children, hence the ``R'' rating, but is O.K. for adults who just want some light entertainment. Just don't take it seriously.",1164067200,3,1218,4.785714285714286

I mean the direction in this movie is best example of how bad a direction can be. As rightly pointed by one of the reviewers (P. Sullivan) here, another stupid example is that old lady passenger doing woo-hoo after the plane was landed with dead people everywhere. Again, don't expect anything on any front of direction, acting, scripts, storyline, and dialogues.

Truth is, implausibly stupid as it is at times, Passenger 57 does deliver on some pretty lofty thrills. There are lots of cunning and tricky twists thanks to Snipes trying to outwit the baddies. And the baddies themselves, well lets just say they all pale in comparison to their leader, a man who could give fantasy superspy James Bond a serious run for his money let alone Snipes' all too humanly real airline agent.

Although I can't believe the FBI would be stupid enough to take a convicted terrorist bomber onto a commercial airliner, we wouldn't have had a movie if they had acted with common sense.  Nonetheless, the stony Wesley Snipes is not about to let the terrorists take over his plane without a fight.  Bruce Payne steals the movie as Rane, the terrorist.  He's been vile in many movies since, but this is one of his most perfectly evil roles.  Real life substance abuser Tom Sizemore does a nice second banana role to Snipes and Hugh's Elizabeth Hurley pulls a surprise when she offers Payne his steak.  Ernie Lively is a riot as the redneck sheriff, replete with his wife's gun; and director Kevin Hooks gives his father Robert (remember NYPD) a juicy role too.

As an action hero Snipes belongs to the school that plays it cool and cracks jokes and kung-fu kicks when the going gets rough, all with a nonchalant glint in the eye, as if he were fully aware that the film is really a live-action cartoon.

Payne as his villainous and unabashedly racist counterpart brings a similar comic-book audacity to the psychopathic fiend.

I was particularly surprised to see a very young version of a face I was certain I recognized, but couldn't put a name to. Elizabeth Hurley! Male chromosomes take note.

To its credit, the film doesn't dilly-dally in going about its pulpy routine, with some very decent action scenes for its time. You know what's going to happen, but it's interesting to see how.",1092700800,8,912,4.716981132075472

Cast:  Wesley Snipes, Bruce Payne, Tom Sizemore, Bruce Greenwood, Robert Hooks, Michael Horse.
Running Time:  86 minutes.
Rated R for violence and language.
As an up-and-coming action star in the world of Hollywood, Wesley Snipes's ""Passenger 57"" is the film that put him on the map.  The film opens with an introduction to the madman played by Bruce Payne, a terrorist who is about to be transported to a maximum security prison on an airplane.  Our hero Snipes plays an airline security expert who makes most of his living doing snazzy airline videos and cracking a few jokes.  It just so happens to both Snipes and Payne are passengers on the same flight (what a shocker!).
The evil terrorist miraculously gets out of his security devices and holds the plane hostage, tormenting and murdering passengers left and right.  Snipes pulls his best John McClane from ""Die Hard"" act, running around like a madman in order to save all of the innocent passengers from the gun-wielding maniac and land the plane correctly.  An exciting, funny, and mesmerizing little gem that is certainly overlooked by action film buffs, but packs a huge punch none-the-less.  Snipes gives a very solid performance in the lead role, proving that he is a formidable action star and that he is here to stay.  Payne is equally creepy as the villian, while goofball friend Tom Sizemore is always a likable character.  Director Kevin Hooks does a fine job cutting through the nonsense that often inhibits other action films and gives the audience a full 85 minutes of pure action.  One stellar action-adventure.",1086048000,4,1606,4.951492537313433
499780,3,6302712009,"Synopsis:
John Cutter (Wesley Snipes) is an airline security expert who is just getting back into his groove after the tragic murder of his wife.  On his way to a meeting with airline executives in Los Angeles, the plane he is on is also occupied by international terrorist Charles Rane (Bruce Payne), escorted by the FBI.  But things don't go as planned as Rane escapes and hijacks the plane.  Cutter, along with an unsuspecting stewardess (Alex Datcher) must try to stop him before more people die.

About the Movie:
This is a movie that I initially really enjoyed, but after seeing it a second time a number of years later, I'm not so certain about any more.  It's definitely nothing original as far as airplane disaster movies go, especially compared to the host of airplane hijacking movies that have come out in the past decade.

One of the main problems is that it needed to be better composed as far as its main characters.  The movie makes great pains to reveal to the viewer that Cutter's wife was murdered and he is gun shy about working in counter-terrorism.  I rather liked this element of the film because it made him less of a paper cutout action hero.  Unfortunately, apart from one or two short sequences, the movie doesn't follow up on this background all that well and chances to develop the tension between him and the female lead are missed completely.

The movie is 84 minutes long. For the expense of an extra 10 minutes a lot could have been done to follow up on all that character development later in the film. It's a real shame that they didn't, because the female lead in this film fares rather poorly, existing mainly as an eye-pleaser and a woman to squeal when harassed by the terrorists.

On the acting side, Wesley Snipes is his usual self, manly and in charge. He does nothing new here.  The villain, played by British actor Bruce Payne, comes of exactly like he's supposed to be, psychotic. Payne does a decent job in the role, though in all honesty, he really isn't given much to work with to make him stand out.  The same goes with the female lead, played by Alex Datcher. Her character as Snipe's love interest, as mentioned earlier, is hardly fleshed out at all, leaving the actress with very little to make her memorable.

Interestingly, this movie happens to have Elisabeth Hurley in it in a role you wouldn't expect her to play.  It's a shame that her role wasn't fleshed out more because a more dynamic character to work with in such an atypical role for her might have been entertaining.  As it is, she's totally unexciting.

On the action side, Passenger 57 has everything you'd expect in a Wesley Snipes film, from cheesy one-liners to gratuitous action sequences.  There are some pretty good action sequences in this film, including one where Snipes climbs from a speeding car onto the landing gear of an airplane that's taking off.

Of course, there are some cheesy and clichd sequences too, like the confrontation he has with a couple of redneck sheriff's deputies.  It makes it seem like they're discriminating against him because he's black, a plot element that has been so over used in movies as to make one's eyes roll. There are a number of bits like this.

All in all, this isn't a terrible movie.  It could have been better written, but the action scenes can be entertaining. It won't stand up against some of the other airplane hijacking movies out there (Executive Decision and Airforce One, to name two), but it does have it's high points.

About the DVD:
Passenger 57 comes in a cardboard snap case on a double-sided DVD with both fullscreen and Widescreen versions of the film in Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.  The image and sound are about average for a budget DVD such as this one.  The movie is translated into French and has English, French and Spanish subtitles.

As far as special features, this one has what appears to be something that is becoming standard on Warner Brothers budget DVD releases.  They include 9 theatrical trailer for other films and a series of textual production notes that provide background on the movie, cast bios and notes on the airplane hijacking movie genre. They're interesting to read, but not nearly as nice as real special features like documentaries would have been.

Bottom line is that this is an average movie on an average DVD release. 3 stars.",1072483200,16,4344,4.672798948751643
499781,5,6302712009,"If you thought the terrorists on Air Force One (starring Harrison Ford) were nasty, check out Mr. Charles Rane as he boards an aircraft intent on murder and mayhem as much as ""necessary"".  This movie vividly portrays action hero Wesley Snipes as the good guy, but it won't be so easy for Wesley (playing as John Cutter) to be the good guy this time. Charles Rane a.k.a. ""The Rane of Terror"" will freeze your heart, and everyone else's on board too. There's not a moment in this movie when your eyes are not glued to the screen, and, unlike other terror filled dramas, you can root for the good guys all you want, but the outcome on this one is not predictable. Mr. Rane cares for no one, and so cares not whom he murders, maims, or tortures. I've yet to see a hardened criminal played so excellently on any movie. Mr. Rane (Bruce Payne) has already been the brilliant mastermind behind four other terrorist attacks, and this one promises to have you holding your breath.",1064361600,4,970,4.511363636363637
499782,5,6302712009,"Wesley Snipes has been fortunate enough to be in some excellent movies -- ""Money Train"", ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar"", ""U.S. Marshals"" (read cousinpaco's review) and ""Drop Zone"", to name a few.  Even with such an impressive list of movies, ""Passenger 57"" is by far his best work.

Snipes plays John Cutter, an ex-cop / terrorism expert, with a rather large chip on his shoulder.  When Cutter takes his seat (as passenger 57) on flight 163, he has no idea what's in store.  Also on board flight 163 is Charles Rane, a psychotic terrorist being transferred to a high-security prison.  Rane, in cahoots with someone else on board, manages to free himself from the restraints, and take flight 163 and its passengers hostage.

Rane is a convincing and sinister bad guy that likes his steaks ""bloody"", and doesn't have time for Cutter's attempts to foil his hijacking plans.  The movie loses its edge once the plane lands, but Snipes' one-liners keep the movie fresh.

While formulaic at times, ""Passenger 57"" should be cherished by the Wesley Snipes fan in all of us.",1036627200,,1084,4.821621621621621

""On occasion.""
""Yeah, well here's a word of advice for you--ALWAYS BET ON BLACK!!!""
  --Wesley Snipes as Atlantic International Airlines Head of Security John Cutter to Bruce Payne as terrorist Charles Rane in PASSENGER 57.
  Not only is PASSENGER 57 a sensational action movie, not only does PASSENGER 57 feature a sensational villain--Bruce Payne in the ROLE OF HIS LIFE as terrorist Charles Rane!!!--not only does Wesley Snipes do a fantastic job of playing a black man trying to succeed in corporate white America, but PASSENGER 57 has excellent music, great photography, and a solid supporting cast anchored by Tom Sizemore, Bruce Greenwood, and Elizabeth Hurley as Payne's English henchwoman, Sabrina Ritchie.
  And the script is pretty good, too, as Snipes plays the BLACK MAN OF ACTION to the hilt, with just the right mix of awareness, bravery, and humor--with his own interests in meditation and martial arts thrown in--as he rolls with the subplot of race in America throughout the script--highlighted by one scene where Snipes tries to convince some a sherriff and some redneck southern cops that he's one of the good guys, and the sherriff responds, ""And I'm the Governor of Louisiana!""
  But as good as Snipes is, Bruce Payne nearly steals the show, because from the time he appears in the film's opening scene, Payne turns Charles Rane's every line into Shakespeare, and Rane's every act of violence into a threat of something worse, and before you know it you've got one of the greatest screen movie battles ever: black, spontaneous, hotheaded good guy American airline security chief John Cutter trying to protect a plane and its passengers versus blonde, blue eyed methodical coldblooded English terrorist Charles Rane who wants to hijack it!  And Rane has a lot of friends in high places!!!

But as soon as his plane is in the  air his band of nameless crooks (including a crazily miscast Liz Hurley)  set him free. But not to worry because John Cutter (Wesley Snipes) is on  board. And he just happens to be head of security for the airline. It's his  job to round up the crooks and save the passengers from the evil intentions  of Rayne. And he's only got 80 minutes to do it in.
I'm not kidding. This  movie is 84 minutes long. The credits roll at the 80-minute mark. Minus 2  minutes for the opening sequence and another 20 (of tedious character  building) for the action to begin. You're left with a 60-minute slice of  entertainment. It makes you wonder why they bothered. If Warner wanted to  make a great hijack movie why did they bother with the Passenger 57 script?  It's too short and too clichd. A couple of brief moments of action make it  barely worthwhile, but watch on it TV. Don't rent it or buy the DVD.",966643200,10,1196,4.372727272727273
