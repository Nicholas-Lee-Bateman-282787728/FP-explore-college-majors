If you're interested in storytellin', it's got that too, and it is all very entertaining. I especially enjoyed his ability to riff on Rev. Gary Davis' ""Two-step Candyman,"" his playing on Willie Brown's ""Mississippi Blues"" and some different lyrics on ""Rag Mama."" Anyone who is a fan of Red Skelton, Mark Twain, Victor Borge, or acoustic blues, should check this out.

As a full disclosure: Roy Book Binder did generously give me a copy of this DVD himself, but it was an unusual circumstance and I don't think he even knows my name, so I'm not on his payroll or anything like that.",1287619200,,743,4.628787878787879
8022214,5,B00024OR44,"As he tells in this charming video, one of Roy's mentors was Pink Anderson - a performer who made his living playing blues in traveling medicine shows - a fixture in turn of the century rural america.  Roy brings the best of that tradition to the stage - charm, humorous stories and great guitar picking and he does so without your having to buy a bottle of elixir.  I enjoy this dvd for a variety of reasons: the setting, the reference to the past through the feeling that one is looking in on a lost art (story telling and music together as performance), the performer's use of environment (sirens, and a plane passing overhead) to accentuate his art and his comfort with himself as both an artist and a guitar player.  This is a beautiful piece of Americana and well worth your time and investment.",1265414400,,801,4.510344827586207
8022215,5,B00024OR44,"I found a CD by Roy(a live show) in a flea market for a dollar and bought it because I had heard his name but didn't really know anything about him. I played the CD on the way home and was just blown away by the stories and his playing. When I found out there was some video of his live show,I had to have it. He can entertain an audience with just a guitar and a mike. That's not an easy thing to do,but his experience of performing since the 60's has given him a lot of stories and great blues songs. This video is a little over an hour long and I was wishing it could be longer. I love his playing and singing and really enjoyed the stories about Rev. Gary Davis,Pink Anderson,Mississippi John Hurt,and Honey Boy Edwards. He knew all of those guys and I'll bet he could tell hours of stories about them and others. I highly recommend this video.",1252627200,,848,4.1454545454545455
