8583706,5,B00CN2MRLI,Die Firma Hesselbach was a program I used to watch in the early 1960s with my parents.  It is very funny and well acted.  The German speech used is the Hessian dialect which was so familiar to me back when I lived in Germany.  Ordinary speakers of German may find the dialect a bit difficult to understand.  However it makes me feel right at home.  I love this series.  I hope more German sitcoms and programs can be brought back on DVDs.,1413676800,,438,4.280487804878049
