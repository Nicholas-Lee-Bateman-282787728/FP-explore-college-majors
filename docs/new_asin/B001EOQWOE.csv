8299189,5,B001EOQWOE,"I just gave this game to my daughter for her birthday on the weekend. This was by far her favorite present.  Not only did she play it non-stop, but she had me playing it too.  I actually found it to be really fun! Even my son joined in. We learned songs from the third movie and sang along to them on the DVD.  I found that I didn't even need to know all that much about the High School Musical movies to enjoy playing along.  The best thing is that there are so many games to play, that my daughter will be able to play it over and over again without getting bored.  We have bought other DVD games in the past, and in our opinion this is by far the best one we have played.  Two thumbs up!",1227398400,9,690,3.9280575539568345

They both have great music and games, including singalongs and dancing.  It is educational and fun at the same time.",1226707200,6,262,4.4375
