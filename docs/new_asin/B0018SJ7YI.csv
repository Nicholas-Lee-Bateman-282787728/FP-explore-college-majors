8270945,1,B0018SJ7YI,"When I ordered this dvd, I didn't realize it was not in English.  The captions, which were in English, were very difficult to read because of the colour of the letters and the colour of the background.  If they had been in contrasting colours--white letters on a black background for example--it would have been much better.
I was going to use this dvd with the kids I coach, but I can't do this now.",1428537600,,400,4.391891891891892
