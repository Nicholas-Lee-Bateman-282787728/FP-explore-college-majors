It's best to go into the film knowing as little as possible, but I'll give you something to get started.  A man researching a lost New Zealand tribe appears to have gone missing and simultaneously implicated in a murder, and his identical twin brother decides to find out for himself what happened to him.  From there the film sucks you into not only the mystery of the researcher but also the nature of the protagonist, and the tribe itself, and atmosphere piles on dimensions till until the ending pulls the rug out from under everything.  This needs a DVD release, BAD.",1340668800,,668,4.635593220338983
