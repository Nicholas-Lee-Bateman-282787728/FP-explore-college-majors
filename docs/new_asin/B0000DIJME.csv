I've viewed these dvds and i must say seeing these videos brings back good old days of MTV  I Love Rock & Roll, I Hate Myself For Loving You, Dirty Deeds, Love Hurts,Cherry Bomb etc. Maybe one day they'll release all her videos in one Mega collection.  Rock On Joan!!!!",1381881600,3,344,4.276923076923077
8416613,1,B0000DIJME,"WARNING- THIS DVD IS RARE BECAUSE IT WAS RECALLED DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT IS DEFECTIVE- NICE OF THESE ''HONEST'' SELLERS TO LET YOU KNOW, HUH? DISC ONE PLAYS IN COMPUTERS, BUT VERY FEW MODELS OF DVD PLAYERS- AND IF YOUR LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE FEW, THE MENU IS STILL INOPERABLE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THESE SELLERS DON'T DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION, BUT THEY DON'T MIND CHARGING $100.00 PLUS WITHOUT LETTING YOU IN ON THAT LITTLE SECRET. EVIL.
