566287,4,6303112161,"To talk about Sam Peckinpah is to name one of the most complete and wise North American directors in any age . He is in the elite of the Giants film makers . It is easy for the cultivated and passionate movie fan to distinguish his style ; that special seal he printed his works . the violence aesthetical had in him one of its most highest exponents .

Being this work the last Opus of S.P., and having besides a top cast : John Hurt , Burt Lancaster , Denis Hooper, Rutger Hauger it results more than unexpected the final product .

The film is interesting . Who can deny ? But you leave the film with a bitter taste . There is lot of  action , and a credible story but something missed along the film .

It would seem the editing process , the excess of illumination in the night chase sequences ; the obsessive use of the first plane and the abuse of the close up ; the nervous camera and perhaps the fragile nature of the material based on Robert Hudlum made of this thriller just a visible film , indeed but without those ravishing pretensions of his previous films such Stray dogs , Ride the high country , The Wild Bunch , The ballad of Cable Hogue, Cross of iron and the Getaway .

Perhaps the hidden reason remains in a painful reflection . Just a few amount of directors have been able to overcome the pass of the time and its sequels and say farewell with his last opus and sublime work .

The time: that barefoot army demons hidden behind the door of our days .",1104192000,,1474,4.172535211267606
566288,4,6303112161,"Although it starts off a bit shakey, ""The Osterman Weekend"" regains its balance and becomes a suspenseful thriller worth watching. While it isn't Peckinpah's best film, it has many of the best qualities that made ""The Wild Bunch"", ""Straw Dogs"" and other thrillers interesting and an example of vital cinema.

Rutger Hauer plays John Tanner a TV reporter devoted to uncovering the truth about our government's covert operations, illegal dealings, etc. When a CIA operative Lawrence Fassett(John Hurt)comes to him with the story of a career there's a catch--it involves Tanner's friends. Fassett reveals that Tanner's three best friends Osterman (Craig T. Nelson), Tremayne (Dennis Hopper) and Cardone (Chris Sarandon)are all three Soviet spies. Fassett proposes that Tanner can break an incredible story if he'll cooperate in trying to turn one or all of the spies over a weekend at Tanner's house. Tension builds as the three spies suspect that Tanner knows that they're agents for the Soviets and they're undecided what, exactly, to do about it.

On disc one we get the original theatrical version. It looks quite good and but this high definition transfer highlights the high amount of grain in the original film itself. That's due to the choice of film stock, lighting, etc. That doesn't mar the transfer just keep in mind it won't look quite as smooth as a more contemporary film. The print looks quite good with minimal digital and analog blemishes. The soundtrack in 5.1 sounds a bit hollow to me and lacks the presence it should but that's not a surprise given that it was transferred (If I'm not mistaken) from a stereo soundtrack master.

This Anchor Bay Special Edition includes both the original theatrical release as well as transfer of the video of the only known surviving copy of Peckinpah's original workprint. The workprint differs from the final version. The film was taken away from Peckinpah and many of the important subplots in the film were tossed aside and the more ambigious ending was also replaced a different cut making the film more conclusive. A warning about the workprint--it's precisely that an unfinished version of the film that hasn't been color corrected and is missing key elements of the film. It's also a direct copy of an old 3/4 inch transfer of the film and is in full screen. If you can get past that, it's fascinating to compare the two versions. While the final version is clearer and punchier, Peckinpah's version has some differences that make it compelling as well.

We also get a fascinating documentary called ""Alpha to Omega"" that discusses the making of the movie and the changes made to Peckinpah's movie as well as the general reaction to the film. There's also a still gallery and a nice commentary by Peckinpah historians Paul Sedor, Garner Simmons, David Weddle and Nick Redman. It couldn't possibly have topped Peckinpah's own commentary were he still alive but it's the best that we have. The commentary has a number of fascinating bits of trivia as well as observations about the film, performances and story that are very interesting.

While it isn't a perfect film, ""The Osterman Weekend"" is a fine thriller and well worth viewing particularly if you're a Peckinpah fan. The sharp performances, interesting script from Alan Sharp (who wrote the minor classic ""Night Moves"" for director Arthur Penn)and nice transfer make this well worth picking up.",1097107200,41,3411,5.008818342151676
566289,1,6303112161,"I read the book and enjoyed it back when it first came out, but I never saw the film in its theatrical release.  I read the reviews here and figured it would be worth a try.  Big mistake!

I usually enjoy films based on thrillers, even if they are not totally faithful to the book.  But in this case, the film failed on a much more profound basis than simply taking some liberties with the plot.  A thriller, whether it's a book or film, should at the very least provide some thrills, and it's here that the film falls far short of the mark.
Even though the movie was made in 1983, it is one of the most dated films I've ever seen.  I'm not just talking about the outdated room decor and fashions, I mean the whole look and feel of the film.  It looks as if it were shot in the early '70's. This sense of being very dated and amateur-ish is underscored by the music, a strange concoction of seedy pseudo-techno and cheesy jazz that would be more at home in a porno film.
The screenplay is painfully dull, with none of the suspense of the novel.  Production values are tacky and below the standards that one would expect even in a TV-movie of the same era.  Some tight editing could have improved the situation significantly, but instead we repeatedly end up gazing at someone's face far longer than is necessary.  It's almost as if the director wanted to go for a sort of retro-Euro look for the film, but he didn't come close.
The various ""high tech"" devices, mostly video cameras and monitors throughout the house where the action takes place, look ridiculously outdated.  This wouldn't be so annoying if the director had not insisted on zooming in for a close-up almost every time someone touches a push-button, as if to tell the audience, ""See, I'm all up-to-date with the latest new gizmos"".  The movie is filled with shots of people pushing old-style backlit clear plastic pushbuttons that used to adorn those boxy desk phones and were also used on some of the very first VCRs. Some of this stuff would have looked dated even in 1983.
Peckinpah is apparently best remembered for his penchant for violence and his use of slow motion in depicting violent scenes.  There are admittedly several excellent sequences where he uses slow motion very effectively:  a car/truck collision early in the film (totally unnecessary to the plot, but well done nonetheless) and several other scenes at various moments, but not enough to salvage the film.
What is so unfortunate is that the cast was made up of very capable actors, many of whom have given much better performances with other directors.  If you compare this movie to ""Marathon Man"" and ""Three Days of the Condor"", both made in the mid-1970's, they have aged much better than ""The Osterman Weekend"".  They move more quickly, they keep you in suspense, and you actually care about the characters.  By the time people started getting killed in this movie, I couldn't have cared less. Another fatal flaw is that this movie is totally lacking in humor of any kind.  There are some nasty sarcastic comments, but they are not funny, or even particularly intelligent.
Anchor Bay does an outstanding job of providing a quality video transfer for this turkey.  Even more impressive is the remastered 5.1 soundtrack, which is surprisingly realistic and is one of the few things that makes the film watchable.  The second DVD contains the director's cut of the movie, presented in full screen and without the remastering of the theatrical release.  I could not bring myself to watch it (this is definitely not a film to be viewed more than once), but at least the die-hard fan will have both versions to view.  There is a nicely done booklet with more information about Peckinpah and his films than I needed to know, but again, credit is due to Anchor Bay for giving the movie a much better presentation than it deserved.",1089849600,27,3863,4.65
566290,4,6303112161,"A great swansong to a dying man plagued by his personal demons.
This is not classic Peckinpah admitedly, however this is great viewing. The action scenes for 1983 are up there with any (good) John Woo movies of later years. Rutger Hauer, John Hurt and Craig T Nelson are very watchable. This is defientely worth a second look.
The very rough cut on the 2nd DVD gives this film a more ambigious feel.

566291,3,6303112161,"it's daft, tired and hollow... But i find this Peckinpah movie quite entertaining, but i've just taken an oppurtunity to say the following:
I hope this is the beginning of a 'Peckinpah collection' from anchor bay, a double disc edition of his most neglected masterpiece 'Bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia' would be greatly appreciated. I find 'Convoy', 'The Getaway', 'Junior Bonner', 'The Killer Elite' and 'Cross of Iron' all either tedious, revolting or both. They are all available, but not Peckinpah's last real achievement, strangely a film derided by even some of those that write books about him. It's time this ugly but wonderful, totally unorthodox love story was given a new life on DVD, restored. It's both the most typical and atypical film Peckinpah made.",1074124800,6,771,5.03125

566293,4,6303112161,"Sam Peckinpah (""The Getaway"") delivers his usual blend of action and paranoia in this 1983 sleeper, which stars the underrated Rutger Hauer as a investigative TV reporter out of the Mike Wallace mold, and John Hurt as the CIA operative.  Burt Lancaster as the national security chief reprises his role as an overzealous cold warrior type (like he played in ""Seven Days in May"").  The plot takes off when Lancaster, the frequent target of Hauer's hit pieces for his civil liberties violations, turns Hauer over to Hurt, who reveals that Hauer's business partners (Craig Nelson, cast against his ""Coach"" type as a ruthless businessman, and the ever-edgy Dennis Hopper) are traitorous subversives selling government secrets to the communists.
Soon the plot takes several twists and turns and everyone is mice trapped in a maze with the cat having just been dropped in.  ""The Osterman Weekend"" starts off as a traditional espionage thriller as a red herring just to fool you, but becomes a paranoid psychological manhunt which will leave you wondering who is the good guy and who is the bad guy (which I won't give away here).
The acting is top notch, especially Hauer;  It is such a shame seeing an actor with such a fine sense of timing and the ability to impart dialogue with intelligence, wit and subtle power, being trapped in made-for-cable and miniseries supporting roles.  ""The Osterman Weekend"" shows off the full power of his dramatic acumen , and is up there with his performances in ""Fatherland,"" ""The Hitcher"" and ""Inside the Third Reich.""  Lancaster and Hurt are chilling as the tough-guy spook and the manipulative psychological warfare agent, respectively.  I still say that *no one* can deliver an impassioned speech better than Lancaster, and he's in top form here.
So, treat yourself to a great psychological thriller that's almost as great as ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" with the devastating action and shoot-em-up pyrotechnics you expect from Sam Peckinpah.  ""The Osterman Weekend"" is his worthy validictory entry.",1033862400,15,2031,5.114803625377643
566294,4,6303112161,"Although at times confusing (unless one is really looking hard), THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND is a pretty good final film for one of the cinema's most controversial directors, Sam Peckinpah. It is his statement on the Cold War, courtesy of Robert Ludlum's 1972 novel, and has many of those well-staged action sequences that make later imitators like Quentin Tarantino and John Woo look like rank amateurs.
Rutger Hauer stars as a controversial L.A. talk show host with a penchant for tearing down government officials for their hackneyed explanations of U.S. policy towards the Soviets. He is anticipating the arrival of three old college friends (Craig T. Nelson, Chris Sarandon, Dennis Hopper) and Sarandon's and Hopper's wives (Cassie Yates, Helen Shaver) for an annual get-together.
But then, a CIA operative (John Hurt) throws a monkey wrench into things when he presents evidence that seems to indicate that Hauer's friends are working for the heathen Soviets in an attempt to sabotage America's germ warfare program. Hauer thus allows Hurt to set up surveillance equipment around the house to monitor their friends' doings. Then things get very hairy, complicated, and, not surprisingly, somewhat violent.
Despite having the usual difficulties with his producers, who were (like many others) penny-pinching, Peckinpah managed to make the most out of his final cinematic effort. The incredible shootout between Hauer, Nelson, and the CIA assassins in Hauer's back forty is Peckinpah at his prime (one would never suspect that in reality he was slowly dying when he made the film). Burt Lancaster turns in a hideously frightening role as the right-wing director of the CIA whose anticommunist paranoia (not too much unlike Sterling Hayden's in DOCTOR STRANGELOVE) sets the film's events in motion.
Finished off by a fine Lalo Schifrin score, THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND is a solid and efficient espionage thriller, worthy for at least one curious look.",996796800,18,1942,5.288025889967638

566461,2,6303112161,"I'd say this movie reflects Peckinpaw's emotional and mind state at that moment. A fearless TV interviewer (Rutger Hauer) is commandeered by the CIA when they suspect a group of his friends that comes for a annual house party has been solicited by the KGB. Former KGB spy (John Hurt) now with CIA after they killed his wife is heading the operation, and infiltrates the house with cameras and video equipment to get evidence as to which one of these 'friends' has alluded himself to the KGB. Thus becoming a weekend of suspicion, paranoia, and friendly patience. It sounds like a good scenario, but gets mired in clumsy dialog, over acting, and unexpected and over the top heroism. Maybe in Peckinpaws mind, this is how he viewed himself dealing with Hollywood and friends in the trade. But as a movie, it comes off convoluted, nightmarish, and a golden glow ending. For a seasoned director taking on a Robert Ludlum book, I think Ivan Reitman or John Hughes could've done a better job with this movie. Very disappointing!",1463443200,,1022,4.779661016949152

566508,3,6303112161,"""The Osterman Weekend""(1983) was Sam Peckinpah's (Straw Dogs) last film. This movie is based on Robert Ludlum's (The Bourne Identity) book of the same name. Tanner, a TV host (Rutger Hauer), becomes involved in a the conspiracy when it appears his friends are working for a foreign government. A mysterious CIA operative (John Hurt) involves Tanner in this investigation turning his house into a surveillance center, but then things turn horribly wrong when Tanner realizes he has unwittingly been helping an unhinged personality who is seeking revenge for the death of his wife. Burt Lancaster plays the CIA director. This is a highly entertaining film which speaks of the dangers of a world where surveillance overtakes individual's lives.

This film doesn't appear to be have been remastered as it has numerous instances of dust on the print. It's disappointing given that one expects something much better when transferred onto blu-ray.

There is an excellent, and lengthy (118 min.) special feature about the making of the film which has interviews with the producers and actors as they reminisce about their time on the set and the hurdles involved in creating the film with Sam Peckinpah.",1446422400,,1195,5.154639175257732

566513,3,6303112161,"The studio re-editing for the theatrical release did significant damage to this film. It comes across as a patchwork of scenes strung together in linear sequence without much to tie the scenes together. It's as if the movie were spliced together with duct tape using surviving scenes after some cataclysm destroyed a sizable percentage of the original filming. It also created inconsistent pacing with the story moving unevenly in fits and starts. While it's supposed to be a mystery spy thriller with an unexpected, substantial and very surprising twist (that I won't spoil), the result of this editing is fogged story clarity that should have drawn the viewer into this. It's not difficult to understand why audiences were confused when it was originally released theatrically. I concur with Roger Ebert's basic ""What's this film about?"" question that expresses frustrated confusion in his original one-star review. As I understand it, the original director's cut first scene didn't go well with test audiences with its length and psychedelic dream-like effect overlay, causing walk-outs before the scene was finished. If there's a flaw in the director's cut, it's not the effects used in the opening scene, or its purpose. It's the length of it combined with no clue whatsoever about what's happening. It could have been much better scripted.

Principal acting is excellent, and Burt Lancaster's powerful delivery is reminiscent of his commanding ""Seven Days in May"" role. The flaws are not with the actors. A number of scenes come across as gratuitously containing sexual acts, nudity and foul language without contributing much, if anything, to character development or the story arc. I'm no prude and have a number of films containing significant scenes with nudity, sex acts, lewd dialog and cursing, to include Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"", Oplev's ""Dragon Tattoo"" trilogy (aka Millennium Trilogy; the original Swedish films), Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"", and Peckinpah's earlier ""Straw Dogs"". In each of these, the nudity, sex, violence and extremely coarse dialog contributed something meaningful to developing the characters or the story. In this film, most of the nudity and sex scenes seem little more than gratuitous voyeurism contributing little, if anything, to the characters or the plot. There's not much cursing. Some of it seems natural for the situation. At other times the language is inappropriate and out of place for the characters and scenes in which it occurs. It's as if substantial portions of the ""R"" content were gratuitously inserted to attract audience.

Overall, there was much potential for an excellent thriller, with a very heavy plot twist at the end and a few additional surprises. Peckinpah's directorial swan song could have had the power of The Wild Bunch or Straw Dogs. Unfortunately it's dragged down by incohesiveness. An enigmatic opening, inconsistent pacing, poor editing that doesn't tie the scenes together very well, and gratuitous sex that distracts from the story, produces a film lucky to get 3 stars from me. I'd like to give it 4 or 4-1/2 but simply cannot and I'm disappointed.

The original Peckinpah cut is included in the 2 DVD set on the 2nd DVD and was transferred to DVD from a VHS video tape containing the only known copy of it. Started to watch it, but the quality was so low that I quickly switched to the studio edited main feature without getting past the first scene. I may eventually watch it, but not at this time. Peckinpah aficionados and purists will appreciate its inclusion, and unfortunately it's NOT included in the very recently released Blu-ray (IOW, keep the DVDs if you buy the Blu-ray).",1433203200,,3669,5.142378559463987

First of all there's the script which is your standard conspiracy mixed with your standard plot twists mixed with oh did I forget to tell you that plot twists and mixed with some classic thriller plot twists. It's very simple. The bad guy who thinks he's been besmirched by bad guy that thinks he's a good guy poses as a good guy and in the process of exposing the bad guy that thinks he's a good guy does bad things to good guys pretty besmirches as bad guys to get the help of a good guy to expose the bad guys that appears to be a. Meanwhile the good guy that appears to be a snot is convinced that the good guys or bad guys which may be bad guys yet they appear to be good guys that are just pawns in an extensive plot to get the bad guy that thinks he's a good guy but should know better. The bad guy that thinks he's a good guy is blind to the transparent scheme set up by the bad guy that wants to get the bad guy that thinks is a good guy and assist him in this scheme to get the good guys that appear to be the bad guys little knowing that he is the target. The assistance of the bad guy that thinks he's a good guy knows better so this makes him a bad guy and an unwitting pawn in the scheme. To convolute matters but spice up the story it looks like we also have Cupid Yep Cupid. As we see a lot of people shot with love and arrows fly some arrows get the bad guy which doesn't know is bad guy but would be bad guy if he thought he was. Another overlying theme is video voyeurism which gives an excuse to make this film a soft porn film whether that was the reason you got it or not.

566718,3,6303112161,"The acting wasn't that bad, the scenery and location shoot at the ranch was beautiful, but the writing and the entire plot line left so much to be desired. I only bought this movie because I am obsessed with the location in which it was shot: a 112 acre ranch estate in Los Angeles that is the largest residential property in the LA area that recently sold for $13.5 million (after a significant drop from an original asking price of $30-$60 million). Now, the property looks different from the filming of this movie, but I wanted to see this movie to get a glimpse of the estate and the rooms that I didn't get to see in real estate pictures. So, for that reason alone, I don't regret buying it. But... if you're looking for a good action or conspiracy thriller, then DO NOT waste your buck. The plotline is so weak, there's so many holes in it that you could sift quarters through it. However, amazon never fails to deliver the goods as promised.",1400630400,,948,4.422857142857143

566720,2,6303112161,"I purchased the movie because I had read the Ludlum book and I wanted to see the story translated onto the screen. I was to say the least very disappointed. The screen play treatment of Ludlum's work was in a word atrocious. I would compare and contrast the work with that of the translation of Tom Clancy's ""The Hunt for Red October"". The comparison is that there  is no comparison. Having read the Clancy book first and then watched the movie it was obvious that the movie flowed from the book. Not so the Osterman attempt. I had read the book only months before and thought I remembered that a movie had been made. I found it at Amazon and ordered it, expecting to see a good adaptation of the book; not so. Why the screen writers thought they could improve upon the characterization of Ludlum's work by introducing characters not in the book and additionally changing the methodology of the plot line is baffling. The character played by Burt Lancaster did not exist in the novel. There were of course other additions to the movie not in the book perhaps the kindest thing to say would be ""literary license"" if so the writers definitely need a license suspension. In addition to the Lancaster character there was the insertion of what I assume was the requisite 1980's car chase; again not in the book. Neither of these additions enhanced or advanced the story line. I was very, very disappointed with the movie. The one positive was Amazon's handling of the purchase.....efficient and professional as always.

So, if you enjoy Ludlum's work and have read the novel....please do yourself a favor and avoid the movie. Instead by a copy of a really good movie from Amazon.",1394323200,,1674,4.671186440677966

566825,4,6303112161,"After the disasterous CONVOY Sam Peckinpah was given by Panzer and Davis (producers of HIGHLANDER) another chance in the big leagues.  After CONVOY his only work was second unit direction of his mentor Don Siegel's JINXED.  After OSTERMAN his only work would be on Julian Lennon videos.  A sad climax to a career that had so much promise and, in the end, was sabotaged by Peckinpah himself.  OSTERMAN is a cautionary tale of surveillance.  In the Anchor Bay documentary people claim this was the first.  Not actually true.  Forerunners can easily be seen in Sidney Lumet's THE ANDERSON TAPES and Francis Ford Coppala's THE CONVERSATION.  Nonetheless, this is an effective thriller.  Good work by Hauer and company, Lalo Schfrin's understated score and the editing of Edward Ohman(?).  In the end, as happened to him before, the film was taken away from Sam because of stubborness and a hatred of the powers that be.  His career would have had more great movies and his life longer ... but then he wouldn't have been Sam Peckinpah.  Extras include a very illumating doc called ALPHA OMEGA about the making of the film and interviews with the participants and his first preview cut.  It is rough and easy to see by the opeming sex sequence why everyone was horrified.  Still, this is a better fitting end to his career than if it had ended five years earlier with CONVOY.  For Peckinpah there is what is there to see on celluliod and a thought of, if this man had more control of himself and his life, what might have been.  Still, no one was better at slow-motion carnage than Sam. It's not RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY or THE WILD BUNCH.  It probably belongs on the same level as THE GETAWAY or THE KILLER ELITE.  Still, this man's failures are one helluva lot more interesting some other men's success's.",1261612800,6,1798,4.6900958466453675

566827,3,6303112161,"I have to admit that what I liked about this movie was the fight scene in the kitchen. I am really into martial arts and I think that one reason is seeing Sam Peckinpaw's work back in the 1970s and 1980s, while I was growing up. He was the master of the slow-motion action shot, and we now see it in the films of John Woo and other directors. This is I think a pretty mediocre film, directed by one of the great directors, and like I said, that one scene really stuck in my mind over the years. It is a watchable film overall.",1148601600,4,526,4.019047619047619
566828,3,6303112161,"This one works only about half way. So 2.5 stars really. But I round it up to a 3.
There are signs of Pechinpah's filmaking throughout, but the story gets in the way, and that counts for a lot.
As to why these guys are friends, why they meet continually, why some of them are dealing with the KGB, why Burt Lancaster's character sets John Hurt up, why John Hurt follows through with the plan when he knows the truth, etc., etc., remain unanswered. This is the part of the story that doesn't work.
The acting is alright. Rutger Hauer is fine. Steely and equipped with essential hair. Pre-""Coach"" Craig T. Nelson stands out, but not only for his stellar moustache and command of martial arts, but for his substantive presence as the eponymous friend. The other friends Dennis Hopper and Chris Sarandon must have had creative conflicts, or more established characters in the novel, because their parts end too neatly, Hopper never gets to shift beyond third, and Sarandon (one could claim here he IS Mark Ruffalo's father) is all venom and vitriol. John Hurt is too good an actor to be bad, and represents an English FBI agent (whose wife's brutal murder opens the movie) bent on torture well. His penchant for being cast as a talking-head-on-a-screen, like he did recently in V for Vendetta also works here. Perhaps it is his ability for seething unabashed cruelty. Burt Lancaster is fine as well, neither here nor there as the shadowy figure of power.
The film does have well paced and suspenseful action sequences, standard Peckinpah slow-motion violence, and an ultimately oppressive use of technology as communicator and omniscient weapon of mass destruction.
Not bad, a decent rental, certainly a dated technological piece, with illuminative hair and style for an actioner....",1148083200,4,1779,4.894039735099338
566829,3,6303112161,"In this '80s thriller adapted from a novel by Robert Ludlum (of Bourne series fame), John Hurt plays a CIA operative whose wife is murdered on the orders of a manipulative high ranking CIA official with designs on the Presidency (Burt Lancaster). Himself not adverse to a spot of manipulation, Hurt enlists the help of patriotic gung-ho investigative journalist John Tanner (Rutger Hauer) to help him unmask one or more Russain spies from three likely candidates who just happen to be Tanner's best buddies from college: Craig T. Nelson, Chris Sarandon and Dennis Hopper. Tanner's house is re-wired with hi-tech surveillance gear prior to the friends' annual weekend get-together. But Hurt's intentions are not quite what they seem... This was Sam Pekinpah's last movie, and his name and the A-list cast lend the material a quality it doesn't quite deserve. The plot isn't quite as clever as it thinks it is, or needs to be. Still, the performances are good. Hurt and Hauer are perfect foils for each other, and much of the entertainment comes from Hurt's Machiavellian turn. The film remains interesting today for its exploration of the notions of surveillance, voyeurism, the insidious nature of TV news (especially editing). Peckinpah serves up his usual precision-perfect set-pieces and generally has a lot of fun with firearms and exposed breasts.",1136073600,6,1352,5.15
