4727996,5,B005LAIHW2,"I laughed, a lot, watching ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" (not the catchiest of titles but it'll do).  While it got off to a slow start the flick picked up once they got out of Africa and into hijinks in Monte Carlo, catching up with the Skipper and the rest of the penguin bunch, in order to get back to New York (home, sweet home).  With the introduction of this episodes nemesis, Captain Chantel DuBois, a French animal control officer who is completely bonkers and more than a bit of bloodhound, the movie chases our gang of misfits (Alex the lion, Marty the zebra, Melman the giraffe, and his gal pal Gloria the hippo) across a mostly non-descript Europe as they try to find their way back to the zoo.  Along the way they get involved with a traveling circus and help to transform the pathetic three-ring into a splashy, boffo big-top.  Of course, finding their way home means that they find that ""you can't go back"" and ""home is where the heart is.""  None of this gets too serious or heavy-handed.  Quite a bit of it is utter nonsense (I mean of the Looney Tunes variety, such as when our four intrepid leads are trying to figure out who will go down which oddly shaped ventilation duct) and there are the requisite pop culture references (Chris Rock's zebra painting himself white with polka dots and wearing a rainbow afro, as seen in the trailer), movie references (the jailbreak sequence involving Captain DuBois and the guards as the guards go around and talk about how she could get out in various ways such as through the hole in the wall behind a picture, a la ""Shawshank Redemption""), and a few political and social jabs (surprisingly at Canadian brethren and the French).  All of this mostly plays to the adults in the audience while the kids will love the crazy escapades and slapstick of the animals.

Speaking of the animals, as King Julian and the Penguins overshadowed the main cast in the first ""Madagascar"" and the Penguins killed in ""Madagascar 2"", Alex the lion remained the focal point of this iteration with a nice balance being given to KJ and the penguins and some very likable new animals being introduced by way of the traveling circus.  I especially liked the sympathetic seal Stefano (voiced by Martin Short doing a great impersonation of Roberto Benigni, and those teeth!), and the Russian tiger and the Cheetah were both made to orbit Alex the lion in a yin-yang way (the tiger was the doubter, the aggressor and the cheetah was the believer, the lover).

The only thing that rubbed me the wrong way and that I think was in poor taste, clever as it may have been, was Alex the lion remarking that his relatives used to headline the Roman coliseum circus events back in the day (our travelers were performing their first show in Rome, in the coliseum).  I'm sure this went over all of the children's heads and most of the adult's but the reference to dissidents and Christians being ""fed to the lions"" (while maybe in character for Alex the lion to say) isn't something to laugh at, especially not in a kid's movie.  But other than this and one instance where you thought a character was going to yell ""that's bulls***"" (the Russian tiger Nataly yells, ""That's Bolshevik!"" instead) the movie kept it's kid-friendly tone with its thoughtful and easily digestible messages.

Lastly, I saw this in 2D and thought that it looked fine.  I'm sure that the colors popped in 3D but I wouldn't think that this is a ""must see in 3D"" movie.  Some retailers are selling copies of the first two movies with money off your theater ticket as part of the bonus.  That's a good way to go.  Get through the first fifteen minutes of this film and you've got yourself a winner.

As good as ""Madagascar 2"", if not better.",1339286400,,3740,4.598496240601504
4727997,4,B005LAIHW2,"""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" is a DreamWorks gem, easily the best of the franchise.  The plot careens along at comedically break-neck speed, jokes of all kinds flying off the screen as fast as one can absorb them in some scenes, all while being a visual delight.  There's an element that'll probably tickle everyone's funny bone here.  Visual slapstick comedy, movie reference jokes (for the parents), puns, funny in-character interactions, King Julian falls head-over-heels in love, and of course, those ingenious penguins.

The story begins right where ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Madagascar-Escape-2-Africa-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B001NCDFTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (Widescreen Edition)</a>"" left off, with King Julian and The Penguins flying off to Monte Carlo.  The Bronx Zoo crew hatches a plan to finally get home by getting their hands on The Penguins.  Much like the movie-logic displayed when&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Muppets-2011/dp/B007C9N4H8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Muppets (2011)</a>&nbsp;traveled ""by map"", Alex the lion and his compadres snorkel from East Africa to the coast of Monte Carlo.  (Who says it has to make sense?  These are talking animals!)  From there, hijinks ensue.

They're being chased by the most resourceful animal control expert, Dubois (voiced with delicious snarly-ness by Frances McDormand), who has an uncanny nose for tracking animals and determination on par with The Terminator.  The fugitives take refuge in a rag-tag circus train and form a tenuous alliance with the circus animals.  More hijinks ensue as together they collaborate and create a new kind of circus.

There is A LOT to like here.  Sharp scripting with a wide variety of quick-hitting humor (some intelligent, some not-so-much but still laugh-out-loud funny) make for an enjoyable experience.  Visually, there are some flat-out dazzling, try-not-to-blink scenes.  When the film climaxes at the circus production, the audience is treated to a euphoric fantasy of sight and sound with Katy Perry's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firework/dp/B007JOM1ZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firework</a>"" inspirationally integrated.  It's like Cirque du Soleil meets Disney's Fantasia, and it's stunning.  The quality of the voice acting here is top-notch, with all the original main players returning from the first two films, plus the edition of the ever-surprising Bryan Cranston as the supernaturally gifted circus tiger, Vitaly.

As with all DreamWorks animated features, there are a few off-color references that will probably fly over the kids' heads (for example: a policeman chastises a peer with a glove slap, presumably for eyeballing Dubois' rather ample derriere), but there was one EXTREMELY close call brush with profanity that drew gasps from more than a few parents in the audience.  (With just a little imagination, you can imagine what ""That's BOLSHEVIK!"" might sound like.)  Still, there are more redeeming qualities in the script that negative ones.  Themes of loyalty, friendship, and honesty are front and center.

All in all, ""Madagascar 3"" is 85 minutes of fast-paced fun that on pure entertainment value outpaces most animated features.  I highly recommend it for a fun family day at the movies.",1339113600,,3398,6.0754716981132075

The story is silly, but there is a bit of heart in there, but this is one to check out for the oddball humor and gorgeous 3D esthetic.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

4728965,4,B005LAIHW2,"The original Madagascar didn't even make the shelf, Madagascar 2 is an all-time favorite, and this movie is somewhere in between.

Action-packed nonsense glued together with disjointed, but seriously funny moments. DreamWorks is notorious for their mediocre-yet-still-watchable comedy. It was undeniably for children (suppose the graphics or zebra with an afro gave that away) but there were enough legitimately funny moments for me to consider this a good movie. As usual, the storyline was lacking and overly stuffed with ideas like the first draft of a freshman research paper. My attention span is possibly shorter, but in a pinch or if we need a laugh-- it's worth it!",1458172800,,673,5.231481481481482

4728969,4,B005LAIHW2,"Finally! We have a movie in 2012 that is worth every minute and every penny. If your kids (or you, for that matter) cannot stop singing ""Circus! Afro!"" then go ahead and see Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted in 3D. It is the most clever, fun, and exciting animated film to hit theaters in a long time.

When we see our favorite zoo escapees this time, they are on the run with their jungle friends in Europe. Alex (Ben Stiller), Marty (Chris Rock), Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman (David Schwimmer) desperately want to get back to Central Park. Standing in their way is Captain Chantel Dubois (Frances McDormand) as the most evil animal control officer in the world. They narrowly escape her clutches by jumping on a train with a traveling circus. Now their only hope for getting to New York is to buy the circus and whip them into good enough shape to earn a touring contract in America.

Director and screenwriter Eric Darnell does an excellent job of leading the crew with this third installment. The story incorporates new characters beautifully by adding a love interest for Alex (Gia, voiced by Jessica Chastain), a dopey friend for Marty (Stefano, voiced by Martin Short), and a fallen hero everyone can cheer for (Vitaly, a tiger voiced by Bryan Cranston). King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) also finds love in a big bear wearing a tutu named Sonya, and the results are as hilariously sweet as the love saga of Donkey and Dragon. Kids will be able to keep up with all of the new names and nationalities and may even find a new favorite character in the bunch.

What makes this movie truly magic is the skillful use of 3D technology. Every leap on the flying trapeze, flight out of a cannon, and grasp at an animal's tail by Captain Dubois jumps out of the screen and excites the senses. It is so refreshing to see a movie in 3D that actually takes full advantage of its capability. The clever script and silly animation also kept me laughing, but I could have done without all of the jabs at people of Russian, French, Canadian, and basically all non-American descent. What was initially funny drifted toward mean, and resulted in one joke that was totally inappropriate. These moments only accounted for about 5 of the nearly 90 minutes of running time, so do not let that deter you from enjoying this chaotic adventure.",1455667200,3,2334,4.646489104116223

The only thing that I am not too crazy about is the romantic moments.  Some may not be as concerned or think it to be too minor a thing when compared to the many out there.  If your kids are in the preteen or teenage years, they know what's going on.  Just sharing my thoughts and making you aware of its existence out there.  The animation was fantastic, the music was great and by the end, I was singing the words of Marty, ""Afro-circus! Afro-circus!!!"" and made me think about getting the collectors piece to get the rainbow wig.  Definitely was an enjoyable film.  In fact, this is my second copy.",1445558400,,762,4.229166666666667

Dreamworks have often struggled to get the formula really working, but here theyve nailed the blending of adult humor and child entertainment. In fact, this third installment might be the pick of the bunch.

You want my opinion folks, buy digital movies from Flixster or Vudu if you plan to watch them on computers. I have FIOS 50mbs/50mbs, and streaming STILL stalls and crashes on 3 DIFFERENT powerful systems! When I tried watching it again as a stream, it stopped a third of the way trough. In other words, the movie is great, the service is sub-standard (which deserves a 2-star rating, but it's Amazon at fault so I won't penalize the film).",1427932800,,530,4.589473684210526

4730117,4,B005LAIHW2,"Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman are growing tired of waiting in Africa for the penguins to return and rescue them. Sparked by a nightmare from Alex, the four head off to Europe themselves to try to find them, and after causing a riot in a Monte Carlo casino, stow away on a circus train. There, they help inspire and train the talented-but-downhearted circus animals, hoping to impress an American agent and earn a trip back to New York. But the animal-hating French policewoman Captain Dubois is on their tail, and will stop at nothing to capture Alex and mount his head on her wall!

`Madagascar 3' is a really good film, both as a sequel and in its own right.  The story is interesting, the new characters are great, and the film is visually impressive.

It doesn't start out that well, to be honest; the first act, with our main characters travelling to Europe and going after the penguins, is a bit underwhelming. A few familiar jokes and character moments are rehashed, as well as obvious pop culture and film references, made me think that this was just going to be another ""Wash, Rinse, Repeat"" sequel. But the introduction of Captain Dubois, and the shift of the action to the circus train, really kicks the movie into gear.

Dubois is a fantastic character; a bit of a rarity in that she's a genuine antagonist rather than the typical Bumbling Bad Guy we often see in kid's movies. She's tough and competent, and actually gives you the feeling that she might succeed in capturing our heroes. The cast of the circus are also interesting; the gruff but fragile Vitaly, the enthusiastic and friendly Gia, and the comedy relief sidekick Stefano. They fit well with both the story and the main characters, and all are given a chance to show off their personality and abilities.

The pacing of the film is excellent throughout. Despite juggling all the main characters from the first two movies plus the interesting new ones, there are enough funny little sub-plots and side-stories to make sure everyone's favourite is given their time in the movie. The film plays it smart by not lingering on individual jokes for too long, allowing plenty of room for action and character moments despite the relatively brief running time. Visually, the film ticks all the boxes. The chase scenes are well animated, and the psychedelic-influenced circus scenes are quite spectacular.

It's not just for kids though; the film also caters surprisingly well to the adults in the audience. While there is plenty of silly dancing, bright colours, and funny moments, quite a few jokes and culture references seem deliberately targeted at parents. It's always nice to see an animated film acknowledge that it's not there only for children.

The third instalment in the `Madagascar' series is the best one yet. A fun watch for kids and (surprisingly) adults alike.

Of course, I can see why some of the more serious minded critics might not like this movie, but you kind of have to let go of reason when you're looking at this series of movies in particular. Once you do that, you'll find yourself enjoying the adventure that began with Madagascar and finished in New York. Giving you a hint, if you're not into circuses, polka dots, Afros, and the idea of being chased by an laughably indestructible animal control crew across Europe, then perhaps this is not your cup of tea.",1396569600,,625,4.443478260869565

4731280,5,B005LAIHW2,"I think this is the best of all the Madagascar movies.  Though I love all these movies, I liked this movie most, because the plot was more complicated and evolved than the earlier movies.  I highly recommend it!.",1393459200,,212,4.552631578947368
4731356,3,B005LAIHW2,I enjoyed this movie. But my girls were not as interested in it. IT is funny and colorful. But i don't think i would buy it again .,1393027200,,131,3.7142857142857144

4731359,5,B005LAIHW2,"It's not as good as the first one, but it's still pretty funny. The race across Europe and try to get back to the U.S. by joining a circus.",1392681600,,139,3.8275862068965516

4731361,1,B005LAIHW2,"Dont spend the extra $17 dollars to buy the wig/dvd combo pack, just buy the movie. The wig is horrible, pieces falling out, bald spots and uneven length. Its a total rip off.",1392595200,,175,4.333333333333333
4731362,5,B005LAIHW2,"i don't normally do reviews for movies but this is amazing in 3d,ive watched around 20 3d movies and this beats them all, so many special effects, the best ending to the series, this explains how the animals ended up in the zoo in part one, as good if not better than avitar, watched it twice in one night just for the effects alone, worth every cent, you do need a 3d player though as it only contains the one disc and it is 3d only.",1392422400,2,434,4.058139534883721

Not a big problem for my time frame, but I'm glad I wasn't in a rush. (And it could always be our failing postal service at fault). Otherwise, would have been 5 stars...",1392076800,,303,4.241379310344827
4731365,5,B005LAIHW2,Fun fun movie. Great music and animation. The penguins are hilarious and the other characters are as well. Usually sequels are not as good but this one was.,1391126400,,156,4.607142857142857

4731428,5,B005LAIHW2,"Madagascar 3 is in the series that just keeps getting better.  If there are more I would certainly get it.  Everybody stays in character  and in this one the penguins shine.  The nature inforcer in France is aggravating but pushes the whole crew to their comedy limits.  You find yourself saying, ""Ah, perfect"" when you see the circus buyer played like a cigar smoking Nast cartoon.  The new tiger too was developed to the hilt.  And, my grandkids liked it a lot.",1390694400,,463,4.573170731707317

4731568,3,B005LAIHW2,"Our little one loves Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa.  However this installment fails to hold a candle to its predecessor.  There is no story arc tie-in with Alex's family (not featured at all in this film) much less the pride or other animals on the reserve, and the 'bad kittie' grandmother from the first 2 movies is MIA.  Also, the others just go along with Alex's plan to go back to NY at the drop of a hat.  The penguins seem to have more access to James-Bond-esq technology and less intuitive invention and skullduggery than they had in the previous installments.  There are fewer songs and no good 'extras' on the DVD as in part 2.  Overall the plot is insipid and has a veiled anti-hunting message at the end.  I see my kid getting a lot less mileage out of this movie than they had with part 2.",1388620800,,803,4.348993288590604
4731569,5,B005LAIHW2,Kids love it.  However way overpriced n available too many places so should waited before buying g and overpaying for this,1388620800,,122,4.809523809523809

4731571,2,B005LAIHW2,"Although the children seemed to enjoy this movie, it was definitely not my idea of a suggestion to them. I'm not a fan of the personalities/attitudes of the animals portrayed, the dialog, or the storyline. I'd rather stick with Disney, VeggieTales, Shrek or other forms of family entertainment. This did NOT hold the interest of most people in my family as other movies do.",1388534400,,373,4.84375
4731572,5,B005LAIHW2,This movie is Visually stimulating and funny.  Best one out of all the Madagascar series.  Recommend this DVD to anyone.,1388534400,,120,4.95
4731573,4,B005LAIHW2,"My family LOVES this movie! It even does a good job of keeping the attention of my 20-month old. I bought this set because of the rainbow wig that comes with it thinking that my daughter (4years) would love it and she didat first, now it never gets played with. I would still buy the movie, but I don't think I'd buy it with the wig a second time around.",1388448000,,354,4.071428571428571

4731656,5,B005LAIHW2,"For 'In Your face' 3D lovers this is IT! I've been a 3D nut for 60 years and this insane flick has it all in spades. I don't even remember a scene where something wasn't in the living room, poking, flying, jutting, sticking, zooming, you name it and the movie is very funny and so well made. If you have a 3D TV, this is the DEMO. I can't even imagine watching this in 2D and not feeling cheated. ;-)",1386633600,2,400,4.0125
4731657,1,B005LAIHW2,"I'm twelve and I believe that this is inappropriate for children. For example the song "" I'm sexy and I know it "" is in it. it just isn't right and if your going to watch this movie watch out for clips that you might want to skip.",1386547200,2,230,3.8125
4731658,5,B005LAIHW2,What a fun movie! I have wondered how it would be when they finally got back to the New York Central Park Zoo. The ending is unexpected and fun. This cleverly brings the whole saga to a satisfactory end.,1386547200,,203,4.230769230769231

4731661,5,B005LAIHW2,"I was really expecting this to be lame. I can't lie- it wasn't. It was funny...and still funny every time my little ones watch it. Again. And again...and again. The music is great too, the voice overs are great, the movie is funny. Next to Ice Age - it's one of my favorite movie series makers have done that is still good with version 2 and 3. Family fave!",1386028800,,357,4.188405797101449
4731662,5,B005LAIHW2,"The funniest and best of the Madagascar movies! My kids own all of them and this is the one they come back to the most. This movie adds a few extraordinarily interesting characters to the mix, and the animation is also quite a bit better than the first movie in the series. As always, there's a lot of catchy songs, lots of laughs, and a happy ending. A great family movie!",1385856000,,373,4.267605633802817

4731941,4,B005LAIHW2,"Having enjoyed the first two in the series I looked forward to seeing what the third would offer the viewer and was not disappointed. This is a highly imaginative fantasy movie with reminders of Walt Disney's Fantasia. If you enjoyed Fantasia you should enjoy this one too.

The main characters from the first two are back and while seeking to return to New York manage to carry their activities to a European circus which introduces a new set of characters to the story. The movie is aimed at the younger audience but can also appeal to those members of the older audience who still retain a little of the child inside.

For the family with children this is a worthy addition to the series and should keep the kids happy with repeated viewings.",1375833600,,745,4.593984962406015
4731942,5,B005LAIHW2,"It's much better than the first one. The characters are endearing. The Russian tiger was a favorite. The movie was light and funny and quite silly and ridiculous at times, but it had some touching moments that really do have quite a bit of emotional depth behind them that should appeal to older audiences. This is something I like about Dreamworks, in comparison to a company like Pixar (although, I think Pixar is also an awesome company). Dreamworks tends to a little more hit and miss with their movies, but Dreamworks seems to take more chances, and as a result, they often come up with movies that are different and can be very deep and touching at times. Just a warning, I'm 23 years old, and I like many animated films, especially ones with animals so I'm probably a little biased. I was watching this movie with my 20 year old brother in the room, and he definitely thought it was funny, so perhaps that adds a little more credibility. This is the kind of movie that the entire family should be able to enjoy even if there are no kids around, but if there are kids around, I'm sure they'll love it.
With regard to the movie package itself. There is not much to say on that. It is pretty much what you would expect. It seems good. The discs are stored well in the case. There is no idiotic stacking of discs or any nonsense like that. The cover art it nice. Great movie and great package.",1375488000,,1396,4.3938223938223935

4732070,5,B005LAIHW2,"Manic story, what else would you expect? The stereo 3D design by Phil (Captain 3D) McNally, the Dreamworks Animation stereo supervisor, is terrific, best in the business. Watching on 3D Blu-ray you can notice design elements that are harder to appreciate in a theater. Pay attention to how much of the action and dialog shots take place in front of the screen plane. Not ""comin' atcha"" but tastefully placed to reveal the full roundness of the characters. The treasure trove for depth perception spans across the screen, fore and aft, and Phil knows how to use this better than anyone.",1373414400,2,585,4.86

4732129,4,B005LAIHW2,"I kind of hated the second `Madagascar' film despite rather loving the first, so when this third entry was released last year I had no desire and saw no need in seeing it, other than the fact that my kids kept repeating that ""Circus, Afro, Polka-dot"" scene from the trailer and they begged and begged to see it.  I avoided it in the theaters, since there were other more important animated films to see, but I knew I'd eventually see this.  I must say, I'm not at all upset that I did.  One has to embrace the fact that `Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted' is going all out here in the `ridiculous' side of things.  By the time Captain Chantel DuBois was crashing through brick walls in her attempt to behead Alex the lion I was pretty much in the zone with where this movie was going, and I was enjoying every minute of it.  As with the last two films, the supporting cast really makes this an enjoyable romp.  Alex and Marty, while the stars, are forgettable at best.  Melman and Gloria have had their run and are not as enjoyable as they were at first (Melman practically owned the first film), but Julian and his crew are back and a new crop of supporting players are here, most notably Stefano the slightly deranged circus seal.  The subplot revolving around King Julian's love affair with a bear is hilarious and the single best aspect of the film, and while the finale is a bloated mess (that whole circus scene is just lazy) you can't help but feel it in your heart as Katy Perry's massively popular `Firework' blares over the sound system and Alex finds true love.",1371686400,,1573,4.4375

This movie has the worst dialogue of any movie I've ever seen. Just being in the same room where it's playing makes you feel dumber.,1368489600,2,294,4.363636363636363
4732319,4,B005LAIHW2,"This was the best out of the 3 movies in my opinion.  The animation seemed sharper and the dialogue was funnier.  I mean when the penguin says he got a nuclear reactor when trying to get away from teh animal inspector and they learn that there are no brakes in the car and the penguin says ""Way to commit soldier"" it makes me laugh.  I was not a fan of the series until this one came along and now my daughter and I watch it all the time.",1368403200,,438,3.9545454545454546
4732320,5,B005LAIHW2,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

  The first two ""Madagascar"" films are not bad films.  They introduced us to an off-beat but likable quartet of zoo escapees who negotiate a crazy, unfamiliar outside world in a madcap attempt to get home.  They also introduced us to another quartet - devious but hilarious covert operation penguins sometimes offering ""help"" to the other quartet but more often engineering get-rich-quick scams.  Finally, we have the boisterous lemur trio led by an egocentric lemur ""king"".  They ensured that the first two ""Madagascar"" films were at least fun, lively, colorful, and even quick-witted from time to time.  But in my humble opinion, the two films lacked a certain something that kept them from being truly memorable.

  I think that ""something"" missing was control.  What I mean by that is that Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) didn't seem to have control of their destinies.  They passively let fate (and the penguins, and even a little old lady in Alex's humiliating case) slap them around a little too much.  However, I think things gloriously change and improve in ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" (hereafter ""Mad 3"").  Alex and his friends not only gain more proactive control in getting home, they reveal previously hidden skills and abilities and even take on responsibility for making others' lives better.

  I'll try to give just a basic skeleton of ""Mad 3's"" plot (yeah, right).  The movie begins with Alex and friends still stuck on the African wildlife preserve, perhaps vainly waiting for commando-minded Skipper (Tom McGrath) and his penguin crew to fly back in the rickety aircraft from Monte Carlo after making repairs.  Tired of waiting, they, plus the wacky King Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his lackeys sensible Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) and the obsequious Mort (Andy Richter), snorkel all the way to Monte Carlo and find the penguins in disguise playing roulette in a casino.  Hiding in the rafters, Alex and friends plan to nab the sneaky penguins and force them to fly everyone home.

  Of course, things go awry and all the animals find themselves relentlessly pursued throughout the city by Animal Control Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand).  A combination of Lucille Ball, Inspector Javert, a bloodhound, and the Terminator, Captain DuBois's true goal is mounting Alex's head on a wall.  Despite DuBois's non-stop efforts, all the animals find refuge on a circus train.  Learning that the train's tour itinerary includes New York, Alex figures that it can finally take him and his friends home.  Before that can happen, though, they must ingratiate themselves with the circus's skeptical members.  Gia the trapeze-artist jaguar (Jessica Chastain) and Alex's potential paramour, and Stefano, the high-strung Italian sea lion (Martin Short) and first cousin to Sid the sloth in the ""Ice Age"" movies, are relatively easily won over.  Vitaly the gruff and sullen Siberian Tiger (Bryan Cranston) is a tougher cocoanut to crack because he is suspicious of Alex and friends' circus credentials.  Also, he is a hoop-jumping star in decline because of a fiery stunt gone wrong.

  The rest of the circus is not in such hot shape.  It is dilapidated and playing to smaller and smaller crowds.  If Alex and company want to get home, they got to help Vitaly get his nerve back and make the circus acts really eye-poppingly spectacular again.  Meanwhile, they must also stay ahead of the seemingly unstoppable Captain DuBois, still on their trail.  Can Alex and company accomplish these three goals?  What if the circus troupe finds out the truth about their real intentions?  Will DuBois get her stuffed lion head?

  ""Mad 3"" is, I think, the best, at least so far, of the franchise because at last Alex and company take matters into their own paws and hooves to improve not only their circumstances, but those of others.  And how!  Alex's cajoling, encouragement, and athletic skills start to inspire the troupe, especially the smitten Gia.  Gloria and the insecure Melman not only perfect a literal high-wire act, but a romantic one, too.  Irrepressible Marty helps Stefano with the cannonball act and the circus with a ""rainbow afro"".  Even selfish Julien romantically bonds with melancholy bear Sonya and adds new dimensions to her cycling act.  All this culminates in a gravity-defying, pulse-pounding circus extravaganza, like Cirque de Soleil to the nth power.

  So ""Mad 3"" certainly has the energy, fire, and comic zaniness of its predecessors.  But beyond that, it unexpectedly reveals lessons in friendship, self-reliance, helping others, overcoming inhibitions, self-sacrifice, and what home really means.  If you liked the first two ""Madagascar"" movies, ""Mad 3"" will really make your happiness soar.  If you weren't crazy about the first two, I suggest giving ""Mad 3"" a try.  You just might end up with an exciting, meaningful, and unforgettable experience.",1368403200,,5051,5.152709359605911

4732484,3,B005LAIHW2,"I don't know why, but I've always felt that 2005's Madagascar really didn't need sequels.  This isn't to say that the characters and settings weren't conducive to an ongoing plot of course, so much as the cleverness of New York zoo animals suddenly trying to make it in the wild really only works once.  After that, it becomes a lot more about the characters and their trials and tribulations and in the case of Madagascar, a lot of that involves slapstick and visual gags over rich story telling.

However- my misgivings notwithstanding, the Madagascar series has gone on to encompass a trilogy of films, a variety of holiday themed specials, 61-episodes of the Nickelodeon spin-off Penguins of Madagascar and somehow I doubt DreamWorks is done exploiting this one.

The third film, subtitled Europe's Most Wanted, set DreamWorks back an estimated $145-mil and comes in at a runtime of 93-minutes.  It wears an appropriate PG rating and retains a majority of the established vocal cast of the past entries.

The story, or what passes for one anyway, finds the unlikely group of animal escapees longing to return to their zoo where all their needs were met and in some cases (like Melman's daily pharmaceutical overload) things they didn't even really need were being met!  Of course putting one's faith in the group of militant penguins (who have developed a fondness for gambling in this one) as your means of transportation is sure to come with risks such as having a plane crash on route to NY from Africa directly over Europe just as a random example.

What results is our escapees instantly becoming fugitives in the process as well as the targets of animal control officer Captain Chantel DuBois: equal parts French femme fatale and bloodhound.  Seeking refuge in a circus, the NY zoo crew meets up with a host of circus animals (including a knife throwing Russian tiger, Roman sea lion, a silent bear and an Italian Jaguar).  The circus, it turns out, is in a pretty sad state of affairs and could use the showmanship of some of New York's finest to get their act together.  All the while the main characters are trying to plot a way back to the US while Captian DuBois manages to stay one step behind.

So does any of this tell you if this film is worth a purchase or rental?  Probably not, so let's take a look at some of the technical elements.  The colors, complicated sets, and animatics are all top notch; so much so in fact that the (character models in particular) look surprisingly simplistic from 2005's original Madagascar.  The pacing is a bit odd, with massive action-laced chase sequences that hold the viewer's attention by themselves but the overall plot rather crawls along with no unexpected twists or turns.

Whether or not the comedy will work for you depends heavily upon your sense of humor.  There isn't a whole lot here for the adults.. A few puns here and there, King Julien's obnoxiousness, and a bit of pop culture reference (you have to look close though to pick up on the references to The Matrix, Inception, X-Men Last Stand and so on).  If you're big on slapstick, however, you are in for quite a treat!  Falls, smacks, tumbles, collisions and tranquilizer darts are aplenty!  Kids will likely enjoy the sheer over-the-top nature of the cartoony visuals more than adults will enjoy locating a segment of truly clever or thought provoking dialog.

In all DreamWorks has sort of fallen into the pattern of pumping out huge budgeted, visually intensive CG feature films that don't commit any major crimes so much as they simply lack for substance.  This seems especially true for all of the many sequels they pump out (the Shreks, Kung-Fu Panda, Madagascars and so on).

Worth a rental for sure so long as you go in expecting a lighthearted, cartoony violent, hour & a half romp that promises to get the little ones snickering.  You may wish to save purchasing it to those who need it to complete their Madagascar trilogy.",1366156800,,3958,4.761346998535871

This is a movie everyone can watch and enjoy.,1364342400,,572,4.305555555555555

4732700,3,B005LAIHW2,"This was a fun-ish movie, but, in my opinion, did not have the strong story lines of either M1 or M2.  the story line was too convoluted, had too many characters involved, and was only peripherally- involved with the leading characters (Marty, Alex, Melman, and Gloria).  Just my two cents worth . . .",1364083200,,301,4.555555555555555

The new style glasses needed for it are easier on the eyes than the old blue and red lenses they used to do 3D in, and we have enjoyed the depth added to the picture by the 3D. The multi-pack allows for us to watch the movie on other devices that are not 3D capable. The story is good enough to hold Mom and Dad's interest and fun enough to hold our kids' interests. So, it has been a great show to added to the new collection of 3D movies we are building up.",1363910400,3,508,3.80188679245283

I thought the first one was amusing and the second one was almost amusing, so I figured this one would go the way of too many sequels. Was I wrong! This one is my favorite and I never get tired of the re-invented circus scenes. I understand there is to be a fourth which is too bad because the third movie was the perfect way to end the movie series. The fourth one will have to be astounding.",1363737600,,438,4.104651162790698

4732750,4,B005LAIHW2,The movie is entertaining because of the familiarity of the characters. The story line is contrived and too big of a stretch (probably like any attempt at a 3rd sequel) but fun nonetheless. The circus scenes are colorful but not nearly as entertaining as they could be. They chose to present them like an over the top dream or wild hallucination with no connection to the realism they provide in every other scene in the movie.,1363564800,,427,4.631578947368421

My husband & I could not figure out why?  Called Amazon & talked to a very nice women & she explained that some of the New Blu- Ray movies have the same format..  So make sure your Blu-Ray player shares the same format, as the one you are ready to purchase.  Other than that,  the movie was funny!!!",1363305600,,562,4.295238095238095

First let me say I LOVED the first Madagascar.  I enjoyed the second.  Madagascar 3, however, is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen or had the displeasure of being forced to listen to over and over...

There are about two places in the movie I find funny (both involving the Penguins, of course).  The rest is constant unrelated chaos.  Martin Short drives me nuts.  Marty the Zebra drives me nuts in this one, though not quite as bad as Martin Short.  Screaming ""Afro Circus"" over and over again just doesn't do it for me.

My 5-year-old daughter loves this movie for some reason...  I loathe it.",1363219200,5,711,4.4

But it is clever and quirky, perfect for an afternoon or night when you want to laugh with young ones - or your friends! The French connection is slapstick and hokey, but reminds you of old time Keystone cops. If you love the circus, and have wanted to run away from a normal life to lead a different, more adventurous life, this is the movie that will allow you to vicariously live those dreams.",1363046400,,457,4.4523809523809526

4733766,3,B005LAIHW2,"In some ways, this is the best of the Madagascar movies, mainly because Alex isn't so hung up on himself through most of the movie.  Yes, they are still trying to get back to New York and still find themselves in incredible situations.  It still feels a bit formulaic, treading ground that is familiar to not only the previous Madagascar movies, but also feeling very similar to ""Puss-In-Boots"" and the Shrek franchise story lines.  In other words, it is great for kids and has enough allusions to adult movies so that they don't regret spending time with their kids watching it.  The only problem I REALLY have with the movie is that Alex and his friends lie at one point and when the lie is discovered, he brushes it off by basically saying that the ends justified the means.  That argument would get the troublemaker in more hot water, not less, in my house.  But it does give my family a discussion point.",1359244800,,909,4.54601226993865

Like the other entries, it finds a good balance for content that everyone can enjoy. I really enjoyed watching it and highly recommend it, even if you haven't seen the others.

I took one star off due to the picture quality of instant viewing. I played the movie via Amazon Prime on my PS3 and although the PQ was sharp, it's not up there with blu-ray. This isn't a fault to the movie, but to the limitations of streaming.",1358726400,,540,4.294117647058823

4734177,2,B005LAIHW2,"The first film in the series was cute, and I loved the spin- off Penguins of Madagascar tv cartoon as much as my kids do. But this movie is torture. I hate fake accents, and these are the worst. Maybe kids think it's funny but it sets my teeth on edge. There are movies that parents love to watch as much as kids, but this one isn't one of them. This is a movie to put in for the kids in the other room while you do the dinner dishes.",1358467200,,434,3.8333333333333335

4734297,4,B005LAIHW2,"As with most trilogies, the third is usually not as good as the first or second. This movie doesn't break that stereotype. The writers managed to come up with a decent story to keep your attention. Not as good as the first one but, if you enjoyed the first one, this one is definitely worth watching.",1358294400,,300,4.375

4734345,4,B005LAIHW2,While I'm sure the movie is plenty entertaining (purchased for my nephew) the wig was extremely sub-par. I ubderstand it was a novelty promotion but the quality is so bad that I would not have included it.,1358208000,,205,4.5675675675675675

4734350,5,B005LAIHW2,"This movie is so adorable! It has an appropriate balance between child humor and adult humor and doesn't use words that I don't want my child using. Even if you haven't seen the first 2 movies, you can easily understand the plot and character relationships.",1358121600,,257,4.733333333333333

Our four kids (ages three to nine) really wanted to see it, we reluctantly agreed to it and everyone from the three year old to the forty year old laughed out loud. It was a cute movie that had the three and five yr olds up dancing. The kids watched it again and laughed all over again.",1358121600,,369,4.211267605633803

4734447,5,B005LAIHW2,"Wow! After having watched the first 2 we were all excited about this movie. Madagascar 3 is so full of energy, lots of colors, great story line about believing in yourself and keeping passion in everything. I also like the fact that there was no gross humor and everything was very clean. My boys, ages 6 and 5, 36, and myself absolutely loved it. The characters are very likeable and loveable. Yes, this movie does have some far out things in it but thats what makes it refreshing. This was not a remake of an older film, it was original. I have to also say that each edition of this movie gets better and better, unlike other sequels. We rented the movie but now we are definitely buying it!",1358035200,,693,4.37984496124031
4734448,4,B005LAIHW2,The child enjoyed the complete set and is seen watching on his own.  I think it is a good buy.,1358035200,,94,3.7

4734451,4,B005LAIHW2,My husband and I enjoyed this one as much as the previous Madagascar movies. We laughed at so many spots and thoroughly enjoyed it.,1358035200,,131,4.5

4734506,5,B005LAIHW2,"This was on my Granddaughters Christmas list, so I went to amazon to buy it for the convenience of not having to go to the mall. Good price, well packed and on time. I haven't gotten to watch the movie myself, but my Granddaughter watched it several times with her Father while she was visiting and really enjoyed it. As usual Amazon kept me out of the crowds at Christmas and made it a great shopping experience.
Thanks Amazon",1357862400,,427,4.417721518987341
4734507,5,B005LAIHW2,"I like the personalities of the characters and the wit in this movie. The penguins are great and Julian is smitten by a very hairy female. I grew up in the right era to get a kick out of the penguins calling the lion with the big hair and his friends hippies and catch the references to the cold war. Beyond that, I think the movie touches on a deeper subject, but only if you want to go there. What do you do with life's disappointments and detours, and suppose you don't get what you want, or you do get what you wanted, only it isn't what you really hoped for? Then what? Maybe that's when you discover what truly makes you happy.",1357862400,,633,4.154471544715447

4734727,5,B005LAIHW2,We rented this on a whim because my husband and I wanted to watch a grown-up movie.  We figured a kid movie first would help the kids get to bed and then we could enjoy the adult movie.  The entire family (3 year old & 16 month old boys) and Mom &Dad enjoyed this movie.  During our 24 hours of rental we probably watched it 5 times!  The boys asked for it all day the next day after we rented it!,1357689600,,397,3.8641975308641974

It looks nothing like the one in the movie or the rainbow wigs of the 70's.  I don't know how to get it to look that way, I don't know if jeri curl and a pick is required.  But the quality of cgi continues to get better and better and BD prices are getting better.  I can't complain.",1357516800,,445,4.091954022988506

4735409,3,B005LAIHW2,I always enjoy Dreamworks movies for their hidden adult humor that can be enjoyed while the kids laugh at the slapstick stuff. I didn't find that to be true of this movie. Its not a bad movie but it was not nearly as enjoyable for adults as the first two movies. I tired quickly of the predictable storyline and was unimpressed with the creativity. I would still recommend for kids but it was definitely not as good as other Dreamworks pics.,1356912000,3,441,4.45679012345679

4735796,1,B005LAIHW2,"What can I say?  This movie is a dark, depressing movie.  It's not something I would take my kids to see.  The female animal control officer is frightening and her exaggerated appearance revolted me.  For some reason, she made me think of a dominatrix.  She seems unstoppable and I think that is very frightening for children.  The story is lame.  This is absolutely nothing like the first one which was FUN AND CUTE.  There is no wittiness that would appeal to adults and no humor for children, either.  It's dull, although there is plenty of violence.  A character shoots tranquilizers at animals.  Animals' heads are mounted all over an office.  A character tries to saw the head off of one of the animals.  What the heck kind of kids movie is this?  It goes beyond the norm for violence in a movie for children.  Knives are thrown at animals in the context of the circus.

Based on the number of great reviews I've seen on this movie, I have to say that public taste has taken a downward spiral.  I love animated movies that can transcend the gap between young children and adults.  I've enjoyed so many of the Pixar pictures and many others.  I couldn't wait to get through this movie, I just couldn't believe it was so bad and kept waiting for something actually funny to happen.  Please do us a favor and end this francise.",1356566400,2,1330,4.508403361344538

4735844,5,B005LAIHW2,"The whole film captures the magic, the sublime feeling when you are a child and going to the circus.  Even though the actual circus was just a part of the storyline, if you step back and look at the story as whole, start to finish, the level of excitement, surprises and turns is very similar to what it's like going to the circus.  There's point with the animation you can feel a strong sense of depth of feel.  For an animated film to feel this spatial is brilliant.

My favorite Madagascar film.  I like it better than the first and second one. The only film series where the third iteration was a better than the previous ones.  I can't wait to see what they do for the next one.",1356480000,,683,4.255813953488372

Most suprising to me was hearing my husband laugh out loud at several different times throughout the movie.

Overall I would say, if you like the previous movies, you will most likely enjoy this one as well.",1356307200,,426,4.448717948717949

This movie is honestly the best of the bunch, with a nice heartwarming family-type aspect to it...as well as wraps up the series nicely (though they could make more if they wanted!).  I will also say, for those interested in 3D, there are a few parts where I could see that being used very well!  If you love the other 2 movies, buy it now.

4736629,5,B005LAIHW2,Madagascar 3 brings to it one of those comedy and OH NO what's going to happen next theme to it.  We do learn an extremely valuable lesson about 3/4th the way through about helping people out and letting people down.  The jokes are on par with the first 2 movies and as an father of a 3 and 5 year old I was able to sit down...watch the movie and love it.  I was laughing just as hard as the children were!,1355616000,,406,3.926829268292683

4736704,1,B005LAIHW2,"My family has watched the first two Madagascar movies over and over.  They are filled with wonder, humor both subtle and slapstick, music both fun and majestic, rich characterization, great visuals, and deep emotion - just perfect for family movies.  And on top of that they left a little space to breathe and relax between the exciting parts.  Madagascar 3 is just frenetic, desperate to please and unable to.  Melman, Gloria, and Marty didn't have much to do, and even the penguins are tiresome; and the new characters aren't appealing.  The film's villain is exceptionally boring and ugly and awful - just a cartoon of a cartoon villain - every minute she's on screen is just a mistake.  One of the circus performers is famous for doing something impossible, and that's the theme of the movie - but you get the sense that the people who made it just gave up on coherence entirely out of laziness or lack of ideas, and without any pretense that the characters are animals in a physical universe all the forced action ends up being colors zipping around on the screen.  I can't wait to watch the second movie again and see the ""deja vu"" moment or Marty galloping with the herd, or the lemur scenes in the first movie (and on and on) and forget I ever saw this one.",1355529600,10,1265,4.546255506607929

4736710,5,B005LAIHW2,"I start out by saying that, because I saw the ""free wig"" pack and I thought it would be incredibly cute on my 5 year old while he is watching the movie and singing the ""Afro Circus"" song. After you see this, just trust me, you wouldn't want your 5 year old wearing it.

But the movie is great. Definitely purchase it with the Digital Copy. Two thumbs up!",1355443200,,354,4.130434782608695

4736712,4,B005LAIHW2,This is the best of The Madagascar films. The characters are all good and the female villain of the piece is pure genius. She is like a European Cruella DeVille. A great family film and some jokes for adults. Very colorfull to watch. Do not miss.,1355443200,,246,4.369565217391305
4736713,4,B005LAIHW2,"I loved this movie.  I laughed so much.  My family sat down to watch this together and that says something since my three boys are teenagers.  It kept my attention the whole time.  The jokes were for all ages.  The story had them finding out what they really wanted to do with their lives beside live in a zoo.  The additional animals were awesome.  I would recommend this to everyone.  The bonus wig was just perfect for my youngest who is a clown himself, and he does the dance so well.",1355443200,,488,4.285714285714286

The opening chase sequence in Monte Carlo is first rate, but it goes down hill until the london circus, where it falls off the cliff",1355097600,,285,4.2

We finally realized that the 3D DVD was defected, however we were able to finish watching the movie in blue ray.  Amazon also acted very quickly and sent us a new 3D set and return label for the defected one.  We have not had a chance to watch the new one, hopefully it will work properly.  Please note, whereas the 3D DVD was defected Amazon took care of it in a timely manner.  The only reason I rated it as 3 stars is that my family was very disappointed when we could not finish watching the movie in 3D and my niece was only there for the weekend.  It is a very cute movie and I have always had excellent service with Amazon.",1354492800,,730,4.141843971631205

4737451,3,B005LAIHW2,"Not AS great as the other Madagascar movies, but still very cute and had a decent story line. I just didn't think they followed the ""wild"" theme too much with this one.

Unsurprisingly, there were a lot of things that were overdone dulicates or simple rehashed bits from the first two movies.  But with the new characters, a new direction and plenty of pop culture references that can keep an adult relatively entertained while the kids howl at the obvious site gags, the movie ultimately is more than just ""worth seeing"" it is actually enjoyable and well above what you would expect for a third installment into a series such as this.  And that is from an adult perspective... from the kids perspective it is shiny, fast and slapstick funny.  It will keep them entertained for the entirety.  Well worth it.",1354147200,,716,4.788617886178862

There were a lot of aspects of this movie that I really hated, even though I expected them, but there was a few good qualities about this film. I thought Alex and the gang should have stayed in Africa with the second film, but apparently they were missing the ""good life"" in the New York Zoo. Without giving too many details, I will say that the movie takes an interesting turn with the circus, but it was visually indescribable. Definitely 3-D worthy. This was a fun movie for all ages. I gave this movie three stars because the movie was not great, but it wasn't bad. Just one of those movie franchises that may have over done it with this last one.",1353801600,,754,4.3546099290780145

4738398,2,B005LAIHW2,"Saw this in the theater, and while perusing the DVDs here on amazon I noticed how highly rated this third Madagascar movie was to my surprise. I guess that just goes to show everybody is different and while I hated this movie others seem to have loved it.
 One of my family's favorite movies out of all kids animated movies is Madagascar 2, so funny, King Julian is so great, every line was hilarious. However 3 was a MAJOR disappointment from the beginning (again, for me)I don't want to give away the whole movie but some of my issues were why he would leave his family, without explanation,  and then what was with the crazy annoying creepy shape animal catcher lady who was not funny (but I'm not much for violent slapstick so maybe that's why). The only thing I have positive to say about this movie is that the polka-dot song is/was catchy and fun and my kids cant stop singing it and once it starts it never ends...
 So I guess that's my two cents, but it looks like I'm in the minority of those not liking this movie... I liked it so little I am using my time to write this cuz I really didn't like it.

Oh, maybe I should add we did not see this in 3D and maybe that's what made all the difference, maybe the effects would have amazed and covered over a multitude of sins!?",1353456000,3,1282,4.2633744855967075

They continue on where they left off in Madagascar 2 in Africa and still trying to get back home to New York. Joining the circus is their ticket home and the journey is entertaining to say the least. The kids get wrapped up in the story just as easily as the adults. I enjoy how they put some 1-liners in for the adults as well.

The soundtrack is fabulous as well and gets the kids up and moving as well as singing along. I do wish they would've incorporated more of the ""Move It"" song that my kids love.

I like the Blu-Ray/DVD Combo with the Digial Copy. I like having the Blu-Ray for use at home as well as the DVD for long car rides. The digital copy is great to pull up on a laptop in a hotel room for a before bed movie. I can't say I recommend the rainbow wig, however. The rainbow wig included is a mess. It looks awful and has bald patches and the hair is stuck together. It also falls out in chunks if you touch it.

My 5 year-old loves the wig though so I took a brush and ""frizzed"" it out. That helped a great deal, but there are still areas where it was sewn too far apart to fix the bald patches. You also may want to just get rid of it if you've got little ones that will eat stuff off the floor.

4738696,5,B005LAIHW2,Loved it in 3d. Had a blast with the kids. Colorful and entertaining with a good story.  Could pass for Madagascar 1.,1353024000,,117,4.318181818181818
4738697,4,B005LAIHW2,"This was a gift for my 6 and 7 year-old grandsons.  It arrived on time, as expected, and they were thrilled with it.  Their film critic skills are not finly honed and I didn't see it, so I cannot speak to the quality of the movie.  Amazon, however, is wonderful with their new release shipping and price guarantee.",1353024000,,314,4.379310344827586
4738698,5,B005LAIHW2,This movie is the best of the 3. The penguins are awesome and the main characters are in awesome form. The new adversary is an awesome character that plays havoc with our favorite the animals from New York. I would highly recommend this movie you will laugh your rear end off.,1353024000,,276,4.431372549019608
4738699,5,B005LAIHW2,"I loved this movie!! My kids love it too.  My favorite character was king Julian, too funny.

4738771,3,B005LAIHW2,"My kids (6 and 3) really enjoyed the movie.  We saw reviews that stated this was the best of the three and would keep parents engaged.  I didn't see it, as elements were added to the film that took it in more of a fantasy direction (yes I know there's talking animals) and less in the relationship direction of the first two.",1353024000,,325,4.225806451612903

4738775,4,B005LAIHW2,"Very Entertaining. Funny, clever & creative. Worth seeing ONLY once. in many ways the first movie was better. But the third was surprisingly funny. Though I believe they have hit a creative wall. Not much more you can do with it.",1352937600,,229,4.609756097560975

4738780,4,B005LAIHW2,"I have seen all three installments of Madagascar, and this is by far the best. It is a great choice for families and adults who want comedy with a sentimental component. My only criticism is that the conflict is too similar to the second film and too predictable.",1352851200,,263,4.5
4738821,5,B005LAIHW2,"I do not know why a 65 year old loves madagascar, all three, but I will tell you this: they make me smile and LOL!

4738825,5,B005LAIHW2,My family (kids ages 11 and 13) really enjoyed this movie.  I would highly recommend.  Great fun to watch with the entire family.,1352851200,,129,4.565217391304348

4738827,5,B005LAIHW2,This movie isn't just for kids. I enjoyed it right along with my 8 and 10 year old grandsons. In fact I watched it again after the boys went home.,1352764800,,146,3.9
4738828,4,B005LAIHW2,This movie is so much fun that we watched it twice as a family. Pure family fun. Would recommend this purchase for a family movie night.,1352764800,,136,4.269230769230769

4739041,5,B005LAIHW2,"We watched Madagascar 3... with a two year old boy, and a five year old boy. Everyone enjoyed it, my husband and I laughed at some good, witty humor!  The kids were fascinated with the scenes, the color, etc. Overall a WONDERFUL film! We have purchased as Christmas gift :)

My Possible Unrealistic rant:...[minimal details from/ about the film below]

I did not care for the part where the antagonist stood on the train track and survived, I think that teaches kids that train tracks and oncoming trains are not bad or dangerous and you can survive as long as you lay down. This scene was archaic and something I found distasteful, especially with how impacting these characters are on our kids.",1352764800,,696,4.688524590163935
4739042,5,B005LAIHW2,It was an interesting movie it was funny and well detailed it was easy to understand and suitable for all ages,1352764800,,110,4.285714285714286
4739043,5,B005LAIHW2,This was a very funny movie. Rhe first 3d movie i saw in a theatre. i took the kids they really enjoyed it so i bought it for christmas.,1352764800,9,136,3.7241379310344827

4739046,3,B005LAIHW2,"The third installment of the Madagascar film was good... But will never match the first film.  It was a little stupid as the character hunting the crew was practically super human, which makes it seem unfathomable as to why she fails at capturing them.",1352764800,,252,4.7272727272727275
4739047,5,B005LAIHW2,This was the best purchase I ever made.  My kids (who are 8 and 6) love this movie.  I bought it and downloaded it to my Kindle.  It was worth it.,1352764800,,146,3.6451612903225805
4739048,5,B005LAIHW2,I thought Madagascar two wasn't that good. So I didn't have high hopes for this one. But as I watched the movie pulled me in and it made me laugh and was very very entertaining. I would recommend Madagascar three to anyone.:),1352764800,,225,4.380952380952381
4739049,3,B005LAIHW2,"This story continues abruptly from where it left off in Africa. We had just established Alex's family in Africa, however, he leaves without much acknowledgement of them. From there we go to Europe where some fun ensues and the team joins the circus. Relationships between the group aren't covered much in this movie... maybe because so many new characters are introduced. Also missing is the grandmother from the first two films. It felt weird not having her there to make an appearance and help complete the trilogy. The movie was fine but it didn't seem to have the heart of the other two.",1352764800,,591,4.747572815533981
4739050,5,B005LAIHW2,"This sequel was one of the funniest, unlike most movies that should have stopped at part 2. Keeping the original character voices makes it even better, especially with such an awesome cast!",1352678400,,189,4.9375

4739182,5,B005LAIHW2,This is a wonderful movie that m children love to see over and over. I even enjoy listening or watching because the humor is often for adults and yet funny for everyone. I would recommend this movie to anyone.,1352592000,,209,4.384615384615385
4739183,4,B005LAIHW2,"We've seen all three of the films in this franchise and we thought this was the second best, after number two. Amusing with some interesting new characters and a nice wrap up. If you liked the others, you'll like this one, too. It is not great cinema, but it is good fun.",1352592000,,271,4.230769230769231
4739184,3,B005LAIHW2,"Madagascar 3 was not really what I was hoping for, but it's still enjoyable. On the negative side, it lacked a good story line. It was very predictable and seemed like the directors were bored. I honestly felt like I was watching the trailer in a long version. Now, I don't want to be too harsh, so on to the positive side. The humor was quite funny, and it was still holding my attention. I think that kids would be laughing out loud several times at the jokes. This is what I would rate as a movie to rent a few times, but not buy for my own movie library. If one absolutely loves the Madagascar Trilogy, Madagascar 3 would be a fun edition to your collection.",1352592000,,662,4.2204724409448815

My friends said it was a funny movie",1352505600,,114,3.6
4739234,1,B005LAIHW2,"Wow!  This movie was a let down. First two movies in this series were good, but this one? Yuck. The sub-story of Julian and the bear was just ridiculously stupid. As long as you're funny when your stupid, it's fine. But don't be stupid just to be stupid. The plot was boring, and there was maybe one funny line in the movie. All in all, not funny, pretty boring, bad villain, (did I mention that?) equals bad movie. Period.

I swear i am waking-up in the middle of the night with Madagascar 3 playing through my head. The Penguins are fabulous, duh, the monkeys are hilarious, of course, the main characters are winners, LOVE Julien and all his oddities, even the new characters are fetchingly fabulous, but Capitan DuBois TAKES THE CAKE!!! AHMAAAZING.",1352505600,,452,4.734177215189874
4739236,3,B005LAIHW2,"This movie truly isn't what i expected. It has a very, ""unfinished feeling"" plot, and in my opinion, it's quite negative. The main plot is pretty much the main 4 and the penguins running from a lady who wants to kill Alex and hang his head on a wall. This lead them to joining a circus, and going through a series of adventures which were quite positive. Eventually, it lead them to going back to the zoo. It was in my opinion a sad and dramatic scene, and is a large reason why i feel like this is hardly one of the Madagascar movies. I feel that the zoo is the founder of all these movies in a way, and it's not even recognizable. It looks completely different, and is followed up by a large dramatic scene.

I'm not going to pound this movie. It's not bad, but i wouldn't buy it. I would rather stick to the previous 2. It's just like an entire new movie with new characters and feeling. It's just not Madagascar!",1352505600,,916,4.204545454545454

Even if you haven't seen the previous movies you can see this one.  I laughed the entire time out loud.  Hilarious! As with most animated films, there are plenty of lines in there that go straight over the kid's heads and are for the adults in the audience.  So yes, this is for all ages and you will be entertained and laughing.  Loved it!",1352505600,,485,4.0

4739315,4,B005LAIHW2,I gave it 4 completely because my children enjoyed it a lot and the quality was very good. It missed on 5 because I did not like the rewind and forward play with amazon player. Netflix is better it shows you the movie frame while scrolling.,1352332800,,240,4.239130434782608
4739316,5,B005LAIHW2,If you can get past Chris rock's annoying voice you will laugh through this whole movie. The movie is just plain funny. I love the bear's romance. We watched it twice. enjoy!,1352246400,,174,4.46875

Would not let me adjust size.  I don't know if this is a Charter cable problem or what.  Very disappointed.  Gave it a 4 cause granddaughter loved the movie, watched finally in 2D as heads were chopped off in 3D.  When I've rented movies from Charter ""On Demand"" there are always instructions before the beginning of the movie so you can adjust to your TV.  This movie didn't have that.  Don't know if I will ever rent any more 3D movies from Amazon.  Maybe would try another if it were free.",1352073600,,649,4.38655462184874

4739454,4,B005LAIHW2,"I have to confess that I never cared for the first two 'Madagascar' films (except for the hysterical, commando penguins).
The main characters were like the characters from 'Seinfeld', but without the commitment to self-satisfaction that made them funny.

In 'Europe's Most Wanted', Director Eric Darnell busts his entire cast free of their island prison; and, sets them loose on the world at-large. The animators and voice artists respond to the larger canvas with inspired acting, and a riot of movement and color that literally has to be seen to be believed.

The story (such as it is) has the heroes crashing the Monte Carlo Casino, being chased by a psycho French animal-control officer (a howlingly funny Frances McDormand) and hiding out with a down-on-its-luck animal circus. These elements are all that is needed for an animated tour-de-force.

The pace varies between fast, breakneck and ludicrous speed, with better jokes and a lot less bathos then in the first two 'Madagascar' installments. The crazy penguins are utilized brilliantly, the one-note King Julian is used sparingly (a little of him goes a LONG way) and the circus animals are perfectly compliments to push the main characters to a funnier level.

4739549,4,B005LAIHW2,"Madagascar 3 is the best of the Madagascar franchise.

It has combines STELLAR voice work -- Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, Tom McGrath, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jessica Chastain, Bryan Cranston, Martin Short, and Frances McDormand,
-- with dazzling visuals, non-stop action, color, color, and more color, wit, humor, and even some ""heart"" (rare in a Madagascar film!).

Madagascar 3 also plays Skipper, the Penguins, and King Julien, to the full.

(Somewhere between Madagascar 1 and 2, the directors realized that nobody _really_ cared about Marty, Alex, Melman, and Gloria. What sold the film was the brilliant, absolutely hilarious Penguins and Lemurs (and Monkeys))

Thankfully, the humor of Madagascar 3 is less crude, and more witty than that of the first 2 films. The result is an (almost) perfect balance of slapstick, verbal humor, and parodies that will entertain both children (who will laugh at the slapstick antics of the circus) and adults (who will catch some of the verbal humor).

Madagascar 3 is a hilarious, somewhat brilliant, frenetic family-film that both adults and kids will like!",1351900800,,1130,5.2555555555555555
4739640,1,B005LAIHW2,"This film is so frantic and obnoxious that I can't believe that parents would be so desperate to buy it just to distract their kids for a while when there are so many other, and much better, animated films out there.

This film is so poorly paced that any semblance of plot is lost, supporting characters are uninteresting, and dramatic important moments slip by without notice or consequence. Instead, what you get is a movie that's padded with antics and BAD comedy the whole way through. This movie makes Shrek 2 look like Shakespeare by comparison.

You probably think this review seems a bit cold and calculating for what is essentially a movie for kids; but is it really so much to expect that a kid's movie also be enjoyable to adults? Pixar, and so many other animators, all achieve this frequently...and even the first Madagascar film wasn't bad. This movie is likely only going to be enjoyable for very young children. Adults will get tired of ""Duh duh dudududuh duh duh duh duh Afro circus Afro circus"" after the first time they hear it. Even my 7 year old cousin, who liked this film the first time he saw it, started making fun of it after seeing it a few times more...and that's not the sign of a good movie.

Buy something both you and your kids can enjoy, and stop pretending you like this, adults. If you keep buying this, they'll keep making it.",1351900800,5,1363,4.532520325203252

Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman are still fighting to get home to their beloved Big Apple. Their journey takes them through Europe where they find the perfect cover: a traveling circus, which they reinvent - Madagascar style.

What did I think?
It was a colorful explosion of fun!!  The French Animal Control Officer (bad guy) looked an awful lot like Cate Blanchett, but hey...who cares?!! I found this movie better than the second by a mile, but not quite as funny as the first.  The new characters are fun, but the one I didn't like keeps coming back like a bad penny.

4739644,5,B005LAIHW2,"This movie was a ""visual delight to the eyes"" plus ""falling out of your chair"" FUNNY!  Chris Rock's character was Hilarious!
I've watched it 3 times already and I don't see myself stopping any time soon!  The Blu-ray version really ""pops"" with colors/clarity; some scenes looked almost 3-D (this is the only time I wish I had a 3-D capable HDTV-I'd have bought the 3-D version; without reservations)!  It looked just like (if not better; quality-wise) the movie as seen in Theaters!  Did I mention the action scenes?  They are ""top-notched"" comparable (PG-wise) to any non-CG movie!  Even with suspense included!  You have to be carefully attentive to catch some of the adult(not-in-a-bad-way-for-kids) Humor.  The ""mad/crazy"" animal control lady was also Crazy-Hilarious!

  If I (ever) get tired of laughing; I'll probably just watch it for the spectacular visuals of the Blu-ray version.  This movie was definitely worth buying the Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo(+Digital Copy+UltraViolet & Rainbow Wig) version!  I think I'll watch it again tonight....

Oh, yeah...My kids liked it too!  The included Rainbow Wig was not as ""big & poofy"" as I thought, but the kids enjoyed putting it on MY HEAD; more than their own!

You get a whole new senerio, and get to meet tons of fun new characters. Plus the movie also was very funny. And the colors in the movie, will blow your mind. Its such a work of art.

It had quite a few pop out moments from the animals themselves to objects flying at you. The story was really good. Towards the end of the movie my 8 year old daughter was saying she didn't want it to end, she was having a blast with the 3D. Also there have been a couple reviews saying that the blu ray disc wouldn't work for them, but that want a problem on our Samsung blu ray player, it played all three discs perfect, so don't know what the problem was with theirs.

Along the way, an animal expert chases and tracks the animals, who join and take over a circus to disguise their passage.  Much hilarity ensues, with all kinds of tricks.

As with the other Madagascar films, the voice talent is top notch, including Ben Stiller, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, and featuring Chris Rock.  This time they also have some great voices like Martin Short, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Frances McDormand.

Though the story is kind of thin, the film is quite entertaining and fun.  You will find yourself laughing out loud at many scenes.  Neither the story nor the animation are ground-breaking the way many Pixar features are, but this film is still worth watching for an entertaining cartoon.",1351728000,,915,4.934640522875817

If it wasn't for this issue I'd rate this product 5 stars.  The movie starts a little slow, but the middle and end are worth the wait.

This movie, at best, had a few minutes of laughs surrounded by 2 hours of drudgery and inane plot lines, chase scenes and illogical villains.  What is the point of this movie?

I don't know if it's Ben Stiller's flat performance or the bad writing but the Lion is the least interesting character in the movie.  Even the genius Chris Rock could only pull a few laughs out of this thing.  The problem with Chris is that he has such an over-sized personality and voice (in a good way) that when it is paired with such tired and cliche scenes, he appears to be desperate for the laughs.  As for the other characters, well, I can't even remember who they are.

If you didn't care for (or were only mildly amused by) the first 2 movies, you definitely do not want to waste your time and brain cells on this one.",1351468800,11,961,4.335195530726257

Madagascar 3 is fast paced and king Julian is as funny as always. His character developed a little more than the first movies.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it wasn't as good as Madagascar 1 and 2. The first two had more substance.

SPOILER ALERT

I know people get mad when you say parts of movies without saying spoiler alert. My mom is always yelling at me when I tell her what's going to happen.  :)  Here goes. I didn't like the lion hunter lady. I found her annoying.

My favorite part of the movie. Alex the lion: ""Maybe you even have above average intelligence."" Stefano the sea lion: (smiling) ""No I don't think so.""

It is no longer just about coming back to New York for the escapees - this movie puts the word ""family"" in prospective and makes our old friends New-Yorkers re-evaluate their lifetime priorities.

We initially went to see Madagascar 3 in a theater when it was first released. Both of my kids, 3 and 5-year-old were captivated by the movie.

Typically subsequent movies aren't as good and that was definitely the case with this one.  We rented it from Redbox, but not too far into it our kids were complaining they didn't like it.  We did however finish the movie but it never got bettter.  It was too bright, too nonstop, and no real story.  It wasn't enjoyable to watch unless you just want nonstop super bright eye candy and nothing else.  Unfortunately that's what most kids seem to enjoy these days....  We were hoping for more of a story or atleast something that made sense.  We wondered what people must have been on when dreaming up this movie.  It was really crazy.  The bad lady character in the movie was insane and really hard to watch.  She made the movie even worse.  We were thoroughly disappointed in it.  Only a few small laughs (that only the parents caught) throughout the entire movie.",1351036800,6,988,4.5141242937853105

My youngest child was going to wear it for Halloween and I was going to make her a zebra costume. When the item arrived, I just knew this wasn't going to end well. For starters, the wig was in the same size box as the DVD combo. I was hoping it would fit them, but wasn't sure. After we opened the box, it became readily apparent that the wig was a joke. It is thin, poorly made and is not an afro, as much as it is a pale imitation of one. My child tried to wear it, but it only covers the top of her (9 year old) head like a sad toupee. She finally did figure out that it fits her one doll, but the disappointment over the bonus wig is the reason we haven't even watched the movie, yet. I know the review is mainly about the wig, but, the wig is the reason I bought the movie. It says its for ages 3 and up, but I would bet that the wig wouldn't fit a child much older than 3.",1350950400,4,970,3.8308457711442787

When I started watching Madagascar 3, I thought it was going to be too much about the people again--and I disliked the Animal Control lady even more than I had disliked the Kung-fu Grannie. But then something happened. When Alex came up with his New Zoo idea, I absolutely loved it from then on. I finished up liking this movie just as much as, or even more than, the original.

Naturally, genius penguins and talking animals do push limits but in this movie, even those limitations are pushed further. If you have a daughter age between 2 and 10, or a boy under age 8 or 9 perhaps, you need to buy this movie. Original characters go thru extremely funny situations, learn about themselves. There is actually a character development there. Maintaining same actors for characters' voice was a great plus.

Spoiler alert - from the very beginning, I didn't like Mort barfing on the cake.  I don't find that funny at all.  The lady who chased them, I thought was funny at first (loved her immitation of a bloodhound) sniffing out their scent, and her acrobatics, but when she started licking the water, it moved into gross for me.

The movie was visually beautiful ... the circus part, but I will not be adding this movie to my collection as I did the first two.  I was disappointed, because I'm not a fan of crude humor (potty humor, sexual humor), I guess I like the slapstick humor, the things that we all do that we can laugh at ourselves for, and I said with Madagascar 1 and 2 someone FINALLY got humor right, but with this one, not so according to what I find funny.

Spoiler alert* - I did find it endearing in the show that the animals stuck together, and the revelation for the zoo animals at the end as they realized they had changed*, but I hope they return to the humor elements of 1 and 2 if they do a 4th one.",1350691200,3,1150,4.153153153153153

Because the characters both old and new were so endearing and well-developed that it doesn't really matter. No kid says ""I love the continuity in that subplot about the relationship between King Julien and the bear."" No. It's more like ""It was funny. Polka-dot Polka-dot Polka-dot Afro!"" and it was way funnier than I expected for installment 3. The subreferences to The Matrix, Bond films, and Cirque de Soleil, and zillions of other little things, I was in stitches several times. Actually my kids looked at me sideways wondering what the heck. In addition, the incredible fine details make it worth getting HD, or Bluray. I know I'm gushing, but I don't care -- this series has given me so many good laughs they deserve it. Basset hound!

4740227,3,B005LAIHW2,"I took my daughter to see this in the theater, as we were fans of the first 2 Madagascar movies.  The story line was really, really rough.  It jumped all over the place, and didn't seem to have much thought or editing done within the story line.
*SPOILER ALERT* The story jumped from: They're stuck in Africa because the penguins never returned, then they go off to find them, break into a casino to get them so they can fly back to NY, then get chased by some crazy animal control lady (her character was RIDICULOUS, by the way) and the plane crashes, then they hop on a train full of circus animals, then they buy the circus with the casino money, then they realize the circus hasn't performed well in years because of an issue with their tiger, then they want to re-invent the circus show to possibly get back to NY assuming some reviewer guy likes their show).  Wow...seriously?!*END OF SPOILER*

  I don't think the overall idea was bad, but it was obviously rushed (or they just didn't care enough to refine the idea and make it more of a smooth story line).  My daughter is such a huge fan of the first 2, and she didn't want to stay for the whole movie...even I was like ""seriously?! This thing is still going?"".  We actually had to leave about 20 minutes before it was over because she was done.

On the positive side, King Julien is hilarious!  The sad part about that is...he's about the only thing that made my time watching the movie not feel like a complete waste.  I don't like being this critical, but this was a really, really poor follow-up to an otherwise really good series of movies.  Unfortunate.

***UPDATE***
I subsequently purchased this on DVD for my daughter to have her see the ending since she loved the first 2 movies so much.  The ending was better than I thought.  The circus show was pretty decent with a good musical and colorful performance that was entertaining to my daughter.  I stand by my review of the first 80% of the movie, but they did do a decent job wrapping up the story in an entertaining way.  So, I increased the rating by 1 extra star.  Conclusion: I believe it's worth purchasing if your family is a fan of the first 2 films, even if it's not perfect.",1345939200,11,2203,4.410891089108911
4740228,4,B005LAIHW2,"Admittedly the opening of ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" is not great, but be patient. The second sequel is better than the first one and possibly the original. It takes a while for ""Madagascar 3"" to get really interesting.

The four animals from New York City's Central Park Zoo, Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria, decide to leave Africa, following the penguins now staying at a Monte Carlo hotel. Alex and the gang want the ever-resourceful penguins to fly them back to New York. But please don't ask me how the four big animals - a lion, a zebra, a giraffe and a hippopotamus - managed to travel from Africa to Europe.

The film kicks into gear when the film's ""villainess"" appears. She is Captain Chantel DuBois, Monaco's (or the world's) most efficient animal control officer ""collecting"" animals (their heads, in fact). With her incredible tracking skills and Jackie Chan-like physical prowess, she attempts to capture Alex the lion and the other animals in a hilarious chase sequence.

Most of the other new characters introduced are animals of a traveling circus troupe, including Gia the jaguar, Alex's love interest, and Vitaly the tiger, star of the circus. King Julien XIII also joins the tour and falls in love with Sonya the bear. These new characters and their subplots, though not particularly bad in themselves, are pretty weak when compared to scene-stealing Captain DuBois, who, like the penguins in the previous ""Madagascar"" films, deserves her own movie.

But the strength of DreamWorks' new animation lies in its colorful visuals (in part inspired by Cirque du Soleil) and thrilling action full of imagination that makes up for the lack of credible storyline. The rousing car chase sequence in Monte Carlo alone is worth your money.",1345593600,6,1757,5.006849315068493

I had expected this to be just as funny, but I just found it to be more annoying. The movie started out great and there were a few laughs here and there. However, the antagonist seemed poorly thought out. If there would have been less human interaction, I probably would have liked it more. I completely understand that there has to be an antagonist somewhere in the plot, but I felt as though the woman from animal control was really overdone. She had an overly annoying personality and she felt a little forced. I've been a Dreamworks fan for a long time, and I can't wait to see what they come out with next.

Unlike the 2 previous movies, this one has plenty of heartfelt moments that will pull at your heartstrings and even make you misty-eyed in some parts.

Well,... I'm amazed on how they can make another sequel, and keep me laughing from beginning to end.

And 3D is getting better and better. The 3D effects are getting more and more integrated in the story.
It feels natural and right, and... amazing, (as it should be), At last, I'm starting to like 3D movies,... Never liked 3D movies, seldom impressed by the effects. It wasn't good enough, and the 3D effects felt just like something they put in the story, to use the 3D. It didn't felt natural to the story (at least not to me),... but it seems it's getting better and better now. (First 3D movie I watched that I really liked, was ""Despicle Me"")

4740254,4,B005LAIHW2,"MOVIE REVIEW #40: "" Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted ""

Third in the Franchise of a Zebra, Giraffe, Hippo and Lion traveling to get home where they thought they belonged. The film has fun and funny beginning and a spectacular ending filled with music, daring rescues and color! The middle section dragged a bit and almost flowed a little off track - but the finale is worth waiting for.

Starting in Africa, where they were left in the second feature, Alex the Lion (Voiced by Ben Stiller - Tropic Thunder, Zoolander) decides on his birthday that they all need to be home back in New York where they belong. His buddy Marty the Zebra (Voiced by Chris Rock - Death At A Funeral, Grown Ups) seems to convince everyone they need to find the Penguins that abandoned them (with their witty and sarcastic leader Skipper voiced by the film's director himself Tom McGrath) and use their now super plane to get back to New York.

On their way to Monte Carlo - where the penguins rule at a Casino with the wildly crazy chimps as their buddies - Gloria the Hippo (Voiced by Jedda Pincket Smith - Collateral, The Nutty Professor) and Melman the Giraffe (Voiced by David Schwimmer - Friends, John Carter) fall deeper into their romance with each other.

Enter the villain Captain Chantel Dubois, a mean and sadistic animal police catcher who prides herself by mounting her prey on her wall. Guess what species she is missing - A lion. This was incredibly voiced with such cleverness and French accented flair by the brilliant Francis McDormand (Fargo, Almost Famous). She even sings in French too! She is the reason the whole gang join the Circus - by accident.

Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat, The Dictator) is back as Julian as well as Andy Richter (Late Night With Conan) as Mort and even Cedric The Entertainer (Ice Age 2, Intolerable Cruelty) is back as Maurice. But with some great new and extremely funny charters created by Martin Short (Father of the Bride, How I Met Your Mother) as the incredible self-deprecating Seal Stefano and Bryan Cranston (Drive, Little Miss Sunshine) as the prickly Russian Tiger Vitaly, everyone plays their part learning what a circus team can really do and how friendships are important.

Directors Eric Darnell (Antz, Madagascar 1 & 2 - who also co-wrote this one), Tom McGrath (Megamind, Madagascar 1 & 2) and  Conrad Vernon (Monsters Vs Aliens, Shrek 2) along with co-writer Noah Baumbach (Greenberg, Fantstic Mr. Fox) spent some time on relationships - a little too much in the middle - but paid it all off with a fast paced, fun and touching ending! Hans Zimmer (The Lion King) score is as always fanciful for this type of project.

The climax is fun - very colorful - and this was one of the better films that used the 3-D to its fullest advantage.

I plan to buy it for my collection when it's available. I could write a whole page about this great movie, but there is no need too. Buy it, rent it or go to the Theater to see it. Even at $10 a head at the Theater, it was worth it.",1339632000,,373,3.7948717948717947
