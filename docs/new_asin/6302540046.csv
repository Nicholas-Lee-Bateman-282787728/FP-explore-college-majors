I could have asked for some more sophisticated editing, but the benefit of minimal editing is that there's no question of something being taken out of context.  I particularly love the guy saying that in ""final days,"" people will go back to their ancestral place; this apparently does not include white people in America going back to Europe.  I actually had to pause while I laughed at that one.  To hear people who actually believe in human telegony professing the innately superior intellects of white people, or a man with a European accent complaining about non-white immigrants, pretty hoists them by their own petard.

476687,5,6302540046,"I first heard of this title back in the 80's when a documentary about this phenomenon of hate was shown on PBS.
As someone intrigued by what makes humans tick, why they express such hate for one another primarily due to skin color, and how they subsequently feel compelled to act out that hate in most barbaric and buffoonish ways, I felt the urge to buy the book and then see the dvd.
Some other reviewer felt disappointed with the production, etc. But let's not be distracted by the surface of this product. Instead, concentrate on what it shows about the visceral nature of racial hatred in this country and how it poisons the minds of children and future generations.
I highly recommend this product, especially because you get to hear the words from the hate and fear mongers themselves rather than just a scholarly presentation of this dysfunction; an illness that potentially lies within all of us humans.",1411084800,2,912,4.7421383647798745

476723,4,6302540046,"At first viewing this movie made me angry at the blind stupidity and unchangeable ignorance of the small group of white supremacists interviewed. That anger soon gave way to amusement as they spewed forth their twisted and ridiculously illogical form of Christianity/racialism. Ultimately though, that humor gave way to sadness. I started to feel sorry for these deluded bumpkins and their misguided cause. Their ignorance was disheartening as was their evil. Imagine an aging group of poorly educated and heavily armed people clinging desperately to a bankrupt philosophy based only on what they've read rather than what they've encountered. Now imagine them being informed by some kind of ridiculous messianic mission involving saving the white race and their country. Not so funny now, is it? Its like watching 65 year old Star Wars geeks sitting in the basement waving their home made light sabers waiting for the return of Darth Vader. Just sad, except these geeks are willing to commit acts of real violence in the name of their cause.

476724,3,6302540046,"I was led to this DVD by a Michael Moore fan. But he is nowhere to be found anywhere in the film - except in the closing credits. It's difficult to believe that this film is for real as a documenary. Seldom have I been so depressed as after seeing the 78 minutes. Such an unsavory collection of social misfits speaking bad English with an occasional few words of fake German!  How bizzare! A bust of Adolf Hitler and assorted Nazi memorbilia having little rational sense. Some of the worst parts were the depictions of preachers speaking with miniscule coherence. I had hoped for a higher level of exactly where the folks in the film were with some explanation of where they came from and where they intended to go.  Not at all clear. It is hard to give an award for ""most obnoxious character"" because there are so many of them. Although I lack formal training in documentary film evaluation, with all respect, the preachers quoting the bible in this film are top contenders. WHEW. OUCH.

476725,5,6302540046,"""Blood in the face"" refers to the extreme right-wing Christian belief that only white people can blush. Jews, Hispanics, Arabs, blacks, anyone who isn't of northern European extraction can't show blood in their face, according to these misguided folk. It's scary that the people interviewed in this film exist, especially since they're armed to the teeth and believe they're on a mission from God. The followers are uneducated, and all are filled with hate. They fear anyone who isn't ""Aryan."" They deny the Holocaust happened. They think the government and media are run by Jews. They call non-whites ""mud people."" And they wish all of them dead.
This was Michael Moore's first foray into filmmaking. He had originally been approached by James Ridgeway to ask the leader of a militia group in Michigan if it would be alright if Ridgeway could film a gathering of various militias/Nazis/Aryan Nations/Christian Identity followers, etc. Moore had interviewed the head of the militia group on a radio show, so he knew him. Moore was also asked to help interview the participants at the gathering.
It is interesting to see, in 2012, the predictions these haters made back in the late '80s. They feared the Hispanic population would exceed the white population. They feared the country would be ""taken over"" by ""mud people,"" and now Barack Obama is president. They consider those things to be bad. It's sort of like watching the birth of the Tea Party, or being at CPAC. They want to ""take their country back.""",1329350400,2,1506,4.956521739130435
476726,2,6302540046,"I have read quite a bit about political extremists. Therefore, I thought that Blood in the Face would be an interesting look at some of these people ""in the flesh."" The film, however, was a severe disappointment and I recommend that potential viewers avoid it.

Blood in the Face focuses on those who were active in the white supremacy movement in the late-1980s. The filmmakers attended a rally in rural Michigan and also conducted a number of interviews with both the movement's leaders and its foot soldiers. The presence of Michael Moore, as an interviewer, will no doubt interest many people.

The biggest problem with this film is that the views of the white supremacists simply are not interesting. Most of them cannot articulate why they believe the things that they believe. Most of their views center on the usual targets of the extreme right - international bankers, Jews, the U.S. Government, the media, etc. My wife and I both agreed that we were thoroughly bored after about the first 10-15 minutes of this clunker.

The filmmakers miss some opportunities to liven up this dull film. They interview the wife of Bruce Pierce, who was a member of The Order. The Order was the group that murdered Denver talk show host Alan Berg in 1984 and also robbed an armored car in California. Instead of focusing on Pierce and The Order, the filmmakers let her rant incoherently about her uninteresting views on race.

Another bizarre sequence is an archival 1960s interview with an inarticulate woman. American Nazi Party leader George Lincoln Rockwell was assassinated in the parking lot outside a laundromat. The woman in the interview happened to be washing her clothes in the laundromat at the time of the assassination. The Rockwell assassination is tangential to the story that the filmmakers tell, but it still could have been interesting. Instead of telling that story, they chose to present the mind-numbing interview.

My opinion seems to be in the minority here, but I found Blood in the Face to be a dull way to spend an evening.",1260403200,3,2043,4.876080691642652
476727,4,6302540046,"The film gives some history by introducing 1964 Nazi write-in Presidential canidate George Lincoln Rockwell who believed Hitler to be the second coming of Christ.
Video journalist Michael Moore escorts us to the white separatist lodges for an earful of hateful rhetoric.
Not surprising but shocking non the less.
2009 has proven to be the year of the right wing extremist terrorist, which should be expected with a black democrat as president.",1228089600,,443,5.166666666666667
476728,5,6302540046,"In ""Heart of Darkness,"" Joseph Conrad's character Kurtz's famous dying words are ""The horror!  The horror!""  Kurtz has looked into the face of evil, and the experience was so explosive that it destroyed him.

Conrad's characterization of evil as a mysterious, implacable, overwhelming, consciously malevolent ""heart of darkness"" is one that most of us resonate with.  But as philosopher Hannah Arendt pointed out in the early 1960s when covering the trial of Nazi Adolf Eichmann, evil can also be ""banal.""  Part of what she meant is the process that occurs when people fail to think or judge rationally, and so just accept as ""normal"" certain kinds of behavior that critical reflection would spot as wicked.  But in using the word ""banal,"" Arendt also wanted to de-melodramatize evil.  Evil actions are more often sordid and grimy, based on ignorance and stereotypes, than diabolically clever.

""Blood in the Face"" (which takes its title from the racist myth that only Aryans have moral sensibilities and are capable of blushing) is a perfect example of the banality of evil in both senses.  Filmed at a Michigan gathering of Nazis, KKKers, and Christian Identity loyalists, the film exposes the sheer stupidity, paranoia, and incoherence of the True Believers.

Perhaps nowhere is the pathetic nature of it all better captured than in the description of George Lincoln Rockwell's tawdry murder at a laundromat.  But there are lots of other examples:  the long-haired yahoos in faux SS uniforms proudly announcing that they're ready for race war; the nerdy teenager who insists he wouldn't be a racist or a Christian if it weren't for the ""lovable"" teachings of Rockwell; the wedding between two KKK-robed lovers at a cross-burning; an old guy in a bola tie who gets so furious in denouncing Ronald Reagan as a Jew-lover that he looks positively apoplectic; the stern-faced warnings of a coming Armageddon, which will break the US up into racial enclaves; the bizarre Christian Identity claim that Anglo-Saxons are really the chosen people referred to in the Old Testament, and that Jews are imposters; and the dimwitted would-be television host who clumsily interviews fellow-racists and proudly announces that ""we want to create a show that will make white people look intelligent.""  Duh.

The ridiculousness of these and other beliefs make for some genuinely hilarious interviews in the film.  But this oughtn't to minimize the fact that neo-Nazis, for all their banality, both advocate and occasionally practice violence.  Viewers are reminded of this at the film's end--just another lesson that evil in the world needn't be plotted by Hollywoodish mastermind villains to be horribly effective.

Highly recommended.",1213056000,13,2719,5.228110599078341
476729,4,6302540046,"Like the other reviewer (there's only one other post at the moment) I too am not a fan of Michael Moore, but, while watching one of the documentaries concerning him I saw of clip of his interviewing a storm trooper in Blood in the Face. I've wanted to check out his whole oeuvre for some time so I gave it a viewing. He's not in the film much though, and is not listed as a producer or director. He is the principal questioner in several of these sequences. It may have been Ridgeway or Rafferty, but one of the guys he worked under recounted working with Moore and telling him that the director should never be present onscreen in his film. Then, after contemplating his former advisee's success, stated that he thought it was incorrect.

I don't think it was though. We see why he was right in Blood in the Face. The product itself is a thoughtful, fair, and technically strong documentary which places it miles about Moore's works as his are mockumentaries. The director lets the subjects tell their own story. Here we have no manipulation, and we don't feel like we're being slimed. The dispassionate, legitimate approach to filmmaking is one that Moore would be wise to reexamine in my estimation.

Furthermore, with this topic there was really no reason to embellish. Bohlen and Rafferty let the paranoiacs tell the tale and it is pretty pathetic. Who needs to embellish when you're working with the cast of Conspiracy Theories? I found it both depressing and sad. However, folks like these are real outliers in society and are regularly watched and harassed by the FBI--something that cannot be said about plenty of other hate groups. Their dreams are foolish and do not appeal to their con-specifics. They certainly don't speak for me or anyone else I've ever met, but I do wish Moore would take a look at his past and practice some objectivity when making his films.",1201046400,,1875,4.678787878787879
7827140,4,6302540046,"The explanation for the title comes late in the film when one of the neo-Nazi participants avers that the Caucasian race is the only one that can blush  i.e. show blood in the face. Now Im no scientific expert on this (and I doubt this guy is either) so I cant speak to the veracity of the claim. Possibly those of duskier hues simply don't show their blushing. Perhaps  to paraphrase an old saw  the white race is only one that can blush or has cause to. It is, in any case, a mind-croggling premise on which to base xenophobia. And when an earlier participant declares he hates Jews, Spanish, queers, mud people and a long litany of anyone who isn't white, Christian and hetero theres simply no other designation to be applied. The people interviewed here admit to being racists & looking forward to the day they can shoot on sight anyone they suspect is not white; they promise a bloodbath. (You might recall that the fliers for the rally in Charlottesville included reference to a race war  so much for any contention that they were peaceful demonstrators.)
 Nutball pronouncements on racial superiority aren't the only wackdoodle theories propounded by these creeps, by the way. Try the assertion that there are (or were in 1991) hundreds of thousands of Red Chinese troops in the mountains of Mexico just waiting for the liberals to topple the U.S. government so they could invade. Assertions such as that rather deflate their other contentions  or gosh! maybe we do need that wall. These people seem to live in some alternate universe  or maybe they just deal in alternative facts. The interview subjects gave full access to the filmmakers (including Michael Moore in an early gig) in order to polish their image. The documentary lets them speak for themselves without contradiction or correction and they hang by their own petards.
 The film begins with a congregation of white nationalists of various stripes at what looks for all the world like an outdoor flea market with tables set up to sell their propagandist wares and chotchkes. Some of the attendees are in full Nazi regalia, some just with swastika armbands, some in camo and surprisingly some in full Scottish regalia with kilts and bagpipes just whats that all about? Possibly more disconcerting is how many of these creeps call themselves pastors. How many of them actually hold a divinity degree is not addressed but later in the documentary you can watch Pastor Bob Miles conduct a wedding by the light of a burning cross. That anyone should use a sacred text  any sacred text  as a pretext for spewing hate is repulsive. But then their grasp of religion is as shaky as their knowledge of history. The pronouncement that White people started this country, white people should run this country, for instance, shows ignorance of the fact that many African Americans fought in the Revolutionary War.
 The film includes archival footage of George Lincoln Rockwell, the suave founder of the American Nazi Party within only a decade after the end of World War II. Odd to think that anyone in this country would sign up with him at that early date but some obviously bought his line that Adolph Hitler was the second coming of Jesus Christ  and of course he was martyred. This of course ignores that Der Fuhrer cowardly took his own life to avoid capture by the Allies and certain execution for war crimes. Suicides aren't martyrs. But then the bigots display a puzzling veneration for losers. Like Hitler Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson lost the wars they prosecuted. Does any other nation have statues to those on the wrong side of a civil war or revolution? No, the film doesnt pose that question but I cant help but ponder it. Blood in the Face is utterly terrifying in its depiction of groups whose avowed purpose is to overthrow the government through assassinations and bombings. Will you enjoy it? No. Must you watch it? Yes.",1506297600,,3903,4.774480712166172

Although the presentation will no doubt send people into a tizzy about the racist movement, it certainly does not present the real story - that while you can film them and make them seem like a real threat, the racist right movement is going nowhere.  It lacks adequate leadership and any kind of cohesive doctrine.  Racist groups are fighting amongst themselves so much for the tiny scraps of money and resources out there, there can never be any unity.  Good grief, these groups cannot even agree on a basic definition of who is white and who is not.  They cannot agree on whether Jewish people are the biggest threat or non white people are the biggest threat.  It is a flailing, faltering movement with no leadership and no hope of any real leadership.
