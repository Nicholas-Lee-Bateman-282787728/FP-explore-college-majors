541054,5,6303052703,"Our 22 month old twins keep asking us to watch Barney's video from the moment they wake up. They just love to see Barney and his friends moving all the time.  They even started to sing along the ""I LOVE YOU""  song.  They learned the names of the animals in English although it is not  their mother tongue. They watch this video up to the end without losing  their concentration, and they get upset when it ends.  They want to watch  it again and again...",950572800,5,454,4.270588235294118

He LOVED it!

7835543,5,6303052703,I'm a home daycare provider. I have had Barney - Alphabet Zoo for many years. Kids ages 14 months to 4 yrs love this video. It's not a great video for teaching young kids about the alphabet. But it does have it's own charm. Kids love the singing and dancing numbers. Plus the story that Aunt Molly tells. Which is wonderfully cute story. Over the yrs I have collected over 100 kids videos. Barney - Alphabet Zoo seems to entertain my daycare kids ages 14 months to 5 yrs greatly. I'd say it's in the top 20 favorite videos of my daycare kids.,1127001600,2,542,4.271844660194175
7835544,4,6303052703,"My 21 month old son loves this video, especially Aunt Molly's story!  He grins from ear-to-ear while she tells her story.  Her voice and face are so animated!  He received this gift as a Christmas present and I was really surprised to see it didn't get great reviews.",1073174400,2,267,4.520833333333333
7835545,1,6303052703,"This is one of the worst Barney videos I've seen. My 2 year old likes it least of the 15 we own. There aren't any real animals, and the songs and children are extremely annoying. Good Day/Good Night is much better, along with Barney's Talent Show. Try those first!",1007510400,3,264,4.408163265306122
7835546,5,6303052703,"My son was thrilled when he was first introduced to Barney through this video. I always used to wonder why kids love Barney.... I just picked up this video from our public library for my son. He knew all the alphabets and animals as he was almost two years old when he saw this. But he just loved the dances and songs. So much so that later he would insist that we should dance with him in a circle or as a train whenever a song started. At one time even our guests were not spared and made to run around in circles. They, ofcourse loved to do that for the sake of kids.",1005264000,2,570,4.008771929824562
7835547,1,6303052703,"I bought this video for my two year old under the impression that we were going to visit a real zoo.  This video was terrible in that not only didn't it feature any real animals, but, it skipped a lot of the alphabet. He kept saying, animals mommy?  We were both very disappointed.  Big thumbs down.......",997315200,,305,4.410714285714286
7835548,2,6303052703,"Rich with symbolism, tarot cards are perhaps the most popular self-discovery/divinition tools available.  There are literally hundreds of different decks available today, from the sublime to the rediculous.  However, they are a difficult tool to use and require many hours of dedication, practice and study to use them effectively.
""Alphabet of the Tarot"" is billed as being for the beginner. In the video, Rosemary Taylor, a tarot reader of many years, takes the beginner through an actual spread (the popular Celtic Cross), readings for some of her students, walks the viewer through the symbolism of the major arcana, and answers common questions.
However, I found the whole video to be 53 poorly organized minutes of the very tip of the tip of the iceburg, where tarot is concerned.  In the first instance, she begins the video with an actual reading of a student's cards and concentrates on the meaning of the positions of the cards.  It is only after this that she begins to discuss the symbolism of the major arcana.  I found this to be terribly confusing because in practically every book I've read on the Tarot, from C.G. Jung's writings to ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Tarot"", the beginner is FIRST introduced to the cards, THEN to the spreads and what the individual cards mean in what position.  I think it is more important to intimately know each card-in BOTH the major and minor arcana-before even worrying about the placement of the cards in the spread.
When the major arcana was finally discussed, it was done so in an astrological manner:  The Fool aligned with Uranus, The Emperor aligned with Mars, etc.  Not only was the symbolism of the cards glossed over very, very quickly, but the cards themselves were taken out of order:  13 followed by 20 followed by 3, etc.  For any newcomer to the tarot, this must come across as profoundly confusing, for the major arcana symbolise a persons journey through life, beginning with the carefree Fool and ending as the fully-integrated World.  This would be the equivalent of telling your life story by jumping all over in time, back and forth and back again, in your history.  The end result, of course, would be a totally confused audience.  This aspect of the major arcana-the soul's journey through life-- was totally absent in this video.
I think what happened was that the director/author of the video tried to squeeze FAR too much into one 53 minute tape.  400+ page books have been written about the major arcana alone, so to reduce the symbolism of these cards to a 40-second soundbite is likely to leave a beginner far more confused than enlightened.  To begin with the spreads, gloss over the major arcana (totally ignoring the bulk of the deck which represents everyday life, the minor arcana), and end with questions & answers is a recipe for total confusion.  I actually had to reexplain almost everything  the video covered to a friend of mine after we turned the tape off.  A suggestion would be to have the video in a series:  a part on the major arcana, a part on the minor, and a part on the spreads; not all of it at once jumbled together in less than an hour.
Lest I sound like an old crank, let me finish by saying that the video is probably going to make the most sense to intermediate-to-advanced readers.  People who know the symbolism of the cards and who have had some experience with them will get the most out of this video.  Newbies and beginners will most likely find this tape confusing.  If you're just starting out in tarot, don't start here.  Pick up something more organized and clear, like ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Tarot and Fortune Telling.""  Leave this video for much later when you have a greater understanding of the cards.",986256000,7,3741,4.737654320987654
