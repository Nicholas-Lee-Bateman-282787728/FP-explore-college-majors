7889893,5,6305481121,"Love this movie.  I am not a mom/career woman, but have watched many friends go through the struggles.  Well acted movie and good chemistry among the cast.  Does not feel forced or scripted.  Love Rosie Perez and Pattie Lupone from previous projects.  It's a movie I can watch over and over again.  Wish it were available in Blu-Ray or DVD.",1378598400,2,340,4.583333333333333

7889895,5,6305481121,"A fabulous movie that I have watched again and again, and one that I enthusiastically recommend to all my friends!  I laughed so hard so often and then was moved to tears at the same time.
It truly was like reliving my own experience as a new mother and ""career woman.""  It is the only movie I have ever seen on this topic that is realistic!!! It is a movie that all new moms and dads should be REQUIRED to watch because it shows it like it is.
By the way, does Leonard Maltin have kids?  If so, I bet he behaved just like the husband in this movie, and just didn't get it! I often say that in my next lifetime I'd like to come back as the husband so I can pat myself on the back for ""helping.!",987897600,5,694,3.942857142857143
7889896,4,6305481121,"fun movie. Highly reccomended for a working woman family.  Try and watch it with your loved one.  Not worth 106 bucks, better to wait for the price to fall.",969667200,,156,4.344827586206897
