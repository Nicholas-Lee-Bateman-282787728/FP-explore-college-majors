2594203,4,B000FZETJI,"In Diagnosis Murder, Dick Van Dyke plays Doctor Mark Sloan. Head of Internal Medicine for a major hospital  and an armchair  detective. And unlike the TV show HOUSE, this detective solves crimes OUTSIDE the hospital. And he does it G-Rated without so much blood and gore as CSI or Law and Order..Think of this as Murder the Doctor Wrote! Its Pricesless

Van Dyke is no Rob Petrie in this one. He still has a friendly bedside manner and easygoingness that he has in the original Van Dyke show, but its not one liners and jokes that makes this shows. Its a friendly snoop that Dick brings to this show, like TV's Columbo, without the ""MY WIFE SAID..., SIR"".

The ensemble cast meshes together well. With dick's son Barry Van Dyke as Sloan's son Steve, Happy Days's Scott Baio  as Dr. Jack Stewart, and Victoria Rowell as Amanda, the cast supports Van Dyke's witty detective style

an extra bonus, the DVD has the Jake and the Fat Man episode that introduced Van Dyke as the Dr Sloan. However the two hour pilot is not included in this set, nor is there an audio commentary (FOR SHAME). Would love to heard Van Dyke talk about an episode of two or even an interview with him

Its a great family series, Enjoyable

2594204,5,B000FZETJI,"I, like others who wrote before me, am THRILLED to finally see Diagnosis Murder on DVD.  PLEASE put the other seasons on DVD as soon as possible!!!!  It is one of the BEST shows ever developed.

Think about it---Dick Van Dyke and the creators were geniuses in their day.  They were the pre-cursors to all the CSI shows and others like it.  They did the forensics and solved murders, but in a much less gruesome way.  Diagnosis Murder is a G-rated show that solves crimes in a thought provoking way, without showing all the blood and guts all the CSI and other shows do.  You can actually sleep after watching the show.

Dick Van Dyke and the cast are like a huge family (no pun intended since his son Barry has a lead role) and the camaraderie comes through to make for a very enjoyable and family friendly show.  Young and old, cool and nerdy, single or married, people from all walks of life can and will enjoy this wonderful show.

Amazon, if you could pass along all the positive feedback to the producers, so that they can see how much people desperately want the other seasons on DVD, I think I speak for all fans of the show when I say, ""we'd GREATLY appreciate it!""

To readers, buy this DVD and you won't be disappointed.  The show is AWESOME!",1153612800,37,1252,4.395652173913043

2594362,5,B000FZETJI,"I have to admit that since the demise of this show and Murder She Wrote, I retired from direct television viewing and watch only series I pick up via DVD. I have sampled some of the later shows and have no doubt that the same small percentage as in my day carry the burden for quality. There is a difference, of course, as there is between society today and society when Mr. Van Dyck and I were young. While the polish on the show is different than it would have been in the days when Carl Reiner created his first great hit, the underlying pattern is quite similar. The Good Guys Win and the Bad Guys Lose. Love implies but is not synonymous with Sex, We all know the 'dirty words' but are amenable to filling them in for ourselves rather than having them thrust at us as if we had no imagination whatsoever. There are more fundamental differences but it is difficult to specify what they are since they are conveyed by implication rather than specification.
Happily, Diagnosis Murder seems to have bridged generational gaps to have sufficient breadth of audience to keep sponsors content for a goodly number of years. Good scripts count for much, no doubt, good direction helped measurably, admirable feature players added more than a mite, nonetheless, it was the Star who carried the heavy load and carried it well. He possessed the maturity proper to his years and the lightness of touch necessary to keep it a comedy-mystery rather than a gritty drama of which a little goes a long way.
Certainly I strongly recommend a re-viewing of it for those who saw it first run, and a first viewing for those of mature years who missed its first run. To the younger generation, I can only suggest giving it a chance. Perhaps, maybe, you will like it.",1346716800,,1746,4.563694267515924

2594385,5,B000FZETJI,"Great TV Series and venue for talents of Dick Van Dyke.  Plots are interesting and not boiler plate, just enough humor to enhance the plot.  I plan to buy each season as it becomes available.",1255046400,,191,4.428571428571429
2594386,5,B000FZETJI,"I have never seen Dick Van Dyke in a bad role.  Some are better than others, but he always plays the role perfectly.  In Diagnosis Murder, he plays a doctor who helps solve crimes.  Van Dyke's real-life son, Barry, plays his television son, who is a policeman.  This is a fun series and the cast is very nearly perfect.  In the third season, Jack is gone and Jessie shows up, but both are likeable and so you don't mind.  This is a good crime story for people who aren't into (or just want a break from) all the gory, bizarre, CSI type shows.  It's good clean fun with a guy who remains young-at-heart and just plain loveable.",1252886400,3,626,4.299145299145299

Good show, great actors (Dick Van Dyke), stories could be better written.  Good thing, no really ""bloody"" scenes or anything entirely shocking.

2594405,4,B000FZETJI,"Thanks to the release on DVD of the first season of the popular television series ""Diagnosis Murder,"" we fans who became addicted to the program can now watch it at will.  The quality of the DVD is excellent, so we can clearly see the characters we loved (and some we didn't), as we watch Mark and Steve Sloan and company unravel mysteries all over again.  It is as good, if not better, than we saw on TV.  It is easy to select the specific episode you wish to view and the only difference from the original showings on TV is that you don't have those pesky commercials.  I was anxiously awaiting the release of this program on DVD and sincerely hope that additional seasons are offered to the public soon.  The only reason I did not rate this product a 5 is that one season isn't quite enough.",1168300800,2,794,4.337837837837838

The first season has all of the components that make this series great - Dick Van Dyke's stellar use of humor, great chemistry among cast members, and engaging plot lines. I'm hoping the other seasons make their way to DVD as well!",1167782400,2,398,4.619718309859155

I really hate a lot of the filth that is on tv. I have always loved reading mysteries and have been looking for things that my children and I can watch together; things that are CLEAN. There is nothing indecent or gory about these movies, no profanity, and we certainly did not find them boring.",1166745600,9,429,4.2439024390243905
2594422,5,B000FZETJI,"They've taken their time about bringing 'Diagnosis Murder' out on DVD, but here it finally is.

Dr Mark Sloan (Dick Van Dyke) is the eccentic and lovable head of Internal Medicine at Community General Hospital.  He is also medical advisor to the L.A. NYPD homicide division, which gives him the opportunity to solve murders.  A number of murders also occur at Community General, which seems, judging by this series, to be a highly dangerous place to be either a patient or a member of staff, the violent death toll being high among both groups.

Dick Van Dyke is delightful and funny as Dr Mark Sloan,a nd he is ably supported by his band of helpers, particularly the devestatingly gorgeous Scott Baio as Dr Jack Stewart (be still my beating heart), who combines medical knowledge with streetwise toughness.  The first and second series were by far my favourites, not only because of the presence of the divine Dr Stewart, but because they also featured two particularly likeable characters, Norman Briggs, the harassed hospital manager, and Dolores, Dr Sloan's secretary.  They also featured the occasional brush with the reality of hospital life, discussions about hospital funding, whether poor patients should be treated for free, the cost of drugs etc, which brought a note of authenticity into the wildly far-fetched storylines.

One enjoyable but particularly over-the-top episode features Dick Van Dyke playing four members of the same family, in another one he goes undercover as a priest in a convent,he performs accomplished dance routines without any rehearsal, in fact he can turn his hand to just about anything, and you are left wondering when he ever finds the time to practice medicine.  Never mind, it is all tremendous fun.  Forger reality, it's overrated, just sit back and enjoy it.",1165363200,6,1803,5.0641891891891895
2594423,5,B000FZETJI,"I'm glad the DVDs are finally coming out for this series. I'm biased -- I was a writer & executive producer on the show for several years and I've written the seven original DIAGNOSIS MURDER novels. My only complaint about this DVD boxed set -- beyond the lack of commentaries, deleted scenes, and other material -- is that they didn't include the TV movies that were produced and aired between the broadcast of the pilot (the JAKE AND THE FATMAN episode) and the premiere of the first season episodes. Hopefully they will include those movies as bonus materials on subsequent DVD sets.",1163635200,17,586,4.754901960784314
2594424,5,B000FZETJI,"I had enjoyed this series very much on TV. Unfortunately I don't have cable so was unable to watch it for a while.  I kept inquiring at the video store I go to and they had / knew nothing of this being released.

I am so glad it is finally out and looking forward to more as this is

a great series to enjoy especially with laughter at some of the pranks

the characters pull.

2594426,5,B000FZETJI,"I loved the series and watched reruns all the time.  My sister also loves it and she watches it over and over.  She is a Downsyndrome and once she latches onto something she likes she will watch over and over again.  Can't wait for more seasons to come out.

The only thing I did not like about how they put the series together - you have to hit play for each show.  I have other series that you can play all or indiduals shows.

In this first season it even has the show that Diagnosis Murder was shot off from - Jake and the Fat Man.  I had forgot about that and it was good to see it.",1163030400,2,587,3.9237288135593222
2594427,4,B000FZETJI,"I got my Diagnosis Murder Season 1 DVDs a few days ago and i'm so glad that I bought it.

I gave it a ""4"" only because there are no extras on each episode (like blooper reels or something) but I was thrilled to see that the ""Jake and the Fatman"" intro episode was added. I didn't watch ""Jake and the Fatman"" so I didn't know about this episode. Interesting to see the changes that they made to ""Dr. Sloan"" between this intro episode and the series.

I just got my first DVD player and a show like this is part of the reason why I bought it.

I hope that the entire series will be released.",1158883200,2,589,4.017094017094017

2594429,5,B000FZETJI,"Thats all their is too it.  Dick Van Dyke rocks!  I love this show. I still watch it sometimes on I TV.  The earlier seasons are the best, with Dr. Jack Stewart being played by Jack Baio(think thats right)when Jesse Travis comes in, played by Charlie Schlatter(hope thats right)the episodes seem to focus more on scandals and boring politics.  They are still fun to watch, BUT not as fun as the beginning episodes.  You can tell the cast is just having a great time in each scene.

Oh, and Michael Tucci(That is right)is awesome as Norman Briges.  All the other characters are cool too.  So buy this whenever it comes out and whoever owns the rights to this series I have this to say:

RELEASE THE REST OF THE SEASONS!

8127929,3,B000FZETJI,"Diagnosis Murder was not an immediate success.  In fact, they almost cancelled it after season two.  Part of the problem might have been retread plot lines within season one.  What are the odds of two of the main characters being framed for murder, and a third one accused of murder in separate episodes!  Count the number of times one or more of the main characters is kidnapped.  It was also odd that a doctor would spend less time with his practice, more time running around trying to solve crimes.  In two separate episodes they spent time in a strip club.  There was also a lot of slapstick throughout because murder is amusing.  Technical issues like a boom mike hanging overhead made it seem like a slapdash production.  And the number of times they contrived to have Dr. Sloan sing, dance, and do magic!  If Dick Van Dyke wanted to do a musical, why didn't he!?
In one episode Dr. Sloan does a piano duet with a mobster!
