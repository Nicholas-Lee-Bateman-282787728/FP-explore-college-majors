8547743,1,B000E1ZJCY,I am a retired Spanish teacher and am teaching a class on Spanish culture and civilization.  I purchased this DVD thinking to use it as an introduction to my class but was very disappointed in both the quality and material.  It was more like a quick travel video (28 minutes) and did little to present an introduction to the country.,1279929600,8,333,4.533333333333333
