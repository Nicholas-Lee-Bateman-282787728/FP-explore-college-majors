8633481,4,B00HM8O25W,"She goes really, really, reeaally fast. I think it's a good workout, possibly great, but I've had to back it up a zillion times to try and learn her flow because she's going sooo fast. I'm newer to yoga, so maybe that's part of it, but usually yoga itself is a lot slower. I didn't expect this to be a ""true"" yoga workout and I wasn't wanting it to be that slow, but somewhere in between the slow pace of true yoga and her rapid-fire pace would have been nicer. I wish I had a slo-mo choice on my remote while I'm learning the routine, but I'm still going to stick with it. If I can finally learn her routine and keep up with her, I should have the most amazing body of my life :) I did start with the ""svelte"" one, because I'm more interested in the ""long, lean"" goal at the moment. Maybe the other two choices aren't as fast and hard to learn? One thing I noticed, when you're choosing which of the three workouts you want, on my copy it underlines the strong and the svelte choices when you scroll to them with your remote, but it doesn't underline the sexy one for some reason. You just have to know that you've scrolled to it and choose it without it being underlined, if that helps anyone.",1443916800,3,1195,4.177489177489178
8633482,5,B00HM8O25W,"3 separate workouts - each about 20-30 minutes.  The first is a yoga/weights routine that is very fast paced and challenging.  Second is a great pilates workout, probably the easiest of the three.  Finally a wonderfully well rounded yoga routine.  Very well instructed.  Highly recommended.",1440201600,,290,5.355555555555555
8633483,4,B00HM8O25W,"really liked the pilates, the yoga and weights, i have to get into it, but it's very good.",1434412800,,90,4.055555555555555
8633484,4,B00HM8O25W,"I did this for the first time today. I encourage you to watch it first to get an idea of what she has to offer.  I found that I needed to make my own adjustments based on my fitness level. I like that I have something to strive for as she is a little more advanced than I am. She offers options in my three favorite workouts; weight training, Pilates and yoga. It is not your zen kind of yoga if that is what you are looking for but you will get a good workout.",1433808000,,461,3.8526315789473684
8633485,3,B00HM8O25W,"This is more of a more advanced work out! I am sure I will love it, but not there yet!",1430870400,,86,3.35
8633486,5,B00HM8O25W,Kristin is great. She really inspires you to work your hardest. It's a fast effective workout! ! Definitely worth it,1403481600,3,116,4.85
8633487,5,B00HM8O25W,"Great work out sessions when you haven't got much time to exercise. Kristin's DVD is very enjoyable with clear explanations, no time wasted between exercises, challenging the first times you practice it but not too hard to put you off. This has become my favourite yoga DVD (I'm also a fan of Mandy Ingber' s yogaloshopy); especially being  new mum I find the sexy section of the DVD really effective to get my belly back into shape. For any beginners or intermedium yogis I really recommend it.",1397347200,3,495,4.689655172413793
8633488,5,B00HM8O25W,"I LOVE this video! It has all the elements you need for a well rounded workout.  The 3 segments really work you hard if you do all 3, and if you don't have much time doing just one makes you feel fantastic. It's fast paced and you feel like you've actually done something with your 30 minutes! You'll feel it the next day!! A must have for a home workout.",1388620800,5,355,4.071428571428571
