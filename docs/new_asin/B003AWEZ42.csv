It's amazing to see her life from such a young age, to see her break into the rap game and watch her talent mature and grow. I wish she still made music. This documentary not only shows her professional life, but her home life as well. Whats its like to grow up in urban New York and have a parent who is on drugs and the struggle to overcome adversity to rise above. This is the movie that I watch when Im in a music mood. I always have the songs from this film that I listen to in the car. LOVE IT!!!!",1458518400,,653,3.9545454545454546

8393291,5,B003AWEZ42,"I've been a Hip Hop head since the 80's, and thoroughly enjoyed this documentary.  Shot over four-years, P-Star Rising offers a brief glance at the rise of nine year old rapper Priscilla Diaz.  The PBS documentary gives a behind-the-scenes look at the struggle of former 80's rapper Jesse Diaz, and his daughter's efforts to make a name for herself in an adult male Hip Hop world.

P-Star lives a life of home schooling met with late nights at the recording studio.  The camera follows the pint-size MC as she navigates a life of studio sessions and international performances.

What makes this film stand out is the star.  Priscilla is loaded with charisma, stage presence, flow, and remarkable wisdom.  Intelligent and confident, she's surprisingly profound when it counts, which makes for great on-screen chemistry (and static) with her father.

Given this is a PBS film, audiences shouldn't expect something as gritty as Rhyme & Reason.  But despite its PG format, the film still offers a surprisingly real take on the world of child entertainers and their parents.

Jesse Diaz, who reminisces on his own success as an MC during the 80's, lives vicariously through his talented daughter.  Throughout the documentary, Jesse is portrayed as both protective father, and something of an opportunist.  His relationship with P-Star's older sister becomes strained as his attention focuses on Priscilla's growing career.  As drama unfolds between Jesse and P-Star's label owner over his daughter's image and contract, ideas of what are best for Priscilla become hazy.

P-Star Rising ultimately concludes on a positive note.  There's an emotional payout when the family ties up a question that hangs over the two sisters, plus the satisfaction of their father's acceptance of humility.  Although I've never been much of a fan of child rappers, this is definitely a film that rap fans would appreciate.",1324252800,2,1897,5.150326797385621
8393292,5,B003AWEZ42,"I used to detest rap until I saw ""P Star Rising"" on Independent Lens (PBS).  All I can say now is ""What a fascinating young woman!""  Bright, engaging, talented, wise beyond her years, many things can be said to describe P Star (Priscilla Diaz).  With her life spotlighted in the film, it becomes easy to understand each and every word she speaks and how they fit into her performance and into her life.  I can't recommend this film highly enough.  She is fantastic.",1297468800,6,465,4.554216867469879
8393293,5,B003AWEZ42,"Priscilla Diaz , a 9 Year old, immediately draws you into this documentary. P-Star's dream grows in a temporary housing unit. The documentary takes you through the family's journey into the music industry. It includes the ups and downs of running a business entangled in a family relationship.

Priscilla's life has made her mature beyond her years even at the age of 9. I like the scene shown with the Dad talking to P-Star about their finance. She gets an advance from her contract and he walks through the amounts that were spent and the balance of what is left. At first it appears to be too much information for a child, but he is just teaching her.",1278892800,2,654,4.5423728813559325
