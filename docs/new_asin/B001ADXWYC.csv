3447181,5,B001ADXWYC,"I loved this series on PBS years ago and have had trouble finding it. It is a fascinating, well produced series with many interesting historical moments.  It is, in  my book, a lost treasure that now I have luckily found again.",1232236800,3,227,4.512195121951219
3447182,5,B001ADXWYC,"The Duchess of Duke Street was a BBC period drama set in London circa 1900-1925. The lead character, Louisa Trotter, was played by Gemma Jones, an actress who made the role her own, and mesmerised audiences in the role of a maid who works her way up to becoming a famous cook and eventually the proprietress of the Bentinck Hotel in London. This story is loosely based on the real-life Rosa Lewis who managed the Cavendish Hotel in London.

In the first season, we are introduced to the cast of characters, with Gemma Jones in the lead role of Louisa Trotter. She plays a fiercely determined, independent, strong-willed woman who is bent on making a success of herself. She wants to be the most famous cook in London, and gets employed in the household of Lord Henry Norton, to the detriment of his French chef. But Louisa's determination sees Monsieur Alex relenting and eventually developing a grudging admiration for her cooking skills. Louisa's attractiveness garners her the attentions of many men - ranging from her employer's nephew, Charlie Tyrrell[Christopher Cazenove], to the household's butler, Gus Trotter [Donald Burton], and even the Prince of Wales himself!

The first season sees Louisa's struggle to get to the top - she is pressured to marry the butler, Gus, a disastrous union, and eventually finds herself getting the lease on the Bentinck Hotel, and making a name for herself as a famous hostess in London society. There are many light-hearted episodes here, and also poignant ones - and the wonderful co-stars make the show truly enjoyable - there is the porter, Starr [John Cater] who insists that his little terrier Fred works alongside him, the very old but steady waiter, Merryman [John Welsh], Louisa's steadfast friend and employee, Mary Phillips [Victoria Plucknett], and Major Toby [Richard Vernon], a gentleman who has fallen on hard times, but is brought into the fold of the Bentinck family.

Season 2 continues where season 1 left off - Louisa Trotter [the magnificent Gemma Jones, who may be more familiar to some as Mrs Dashwood in the 1995 version of Sense and Sensibility] has established herself as the proprietress of the Bentinck Hotel in London. There are many interesting developments in this second season - Louisa's great love, Charlie aka Lord Haslemere finds himself trapped in a loveless marriage, Louisa finally meets her daughter Lottie, given up for adoption in Season 1, Mary Phillips the Welsh maid falls in love, and there are plenty of plot twists. Also, WW I looms at the beginning of this season, and Charlie goes off to war. Louisa's hotel gets bombed, and she even goes off briefly to run a canteen for soldiers with Mary and Mrs Cochran, the cook at the Bentinck.

There are many tragedies, and a number of deaths in this season, and indeed the second season seems to be a lot more subdued and somber than Season 1, but it makes for riveting viewing. I would recommend new viewers watch Season 1 first, as the series is choronological, and many key characters are introduced in the first season.

Those who love period dramas will love this series, and not just for the high quality of the acting. The attention to period details is wonderfully authentic, and the sets and location shots are beautifully done, given the time this series was made, circa 1970s. All in all, highly recommended.",1230422400,137,3352,4.884007029876977
3447183,5,B001ADXWYC,"Gemma Jones is ""The Duchess of Duke Street"".  She plays Louisa, an artist with food, and proves to be the queen (oops, Duchess) of society finery when it comes to providing the best possible hotel.  It is her goal, her dream, and her zealous ambition.

Along the way of creating this BBC drama/comedy series (PBS Masterpiece Theatre) she is joined in other cast members who also prove to be so likable and memorable that the entire cast becomes family. This similar thing happens in ""Monarch of the Glen"", also recommended.  This story is a period from WWI through the 1920s.  And along with the rest of the world, the Duchess of Duke Street ""roars"" through the 20's. With it you will experience every emotion imaginable, from love to hate, fear to peace, sadness to belly busting joy, laugh and cry at the same time.

Besides Gemma Jones there are other top performances that will remain with you every time you again see the actors and actresses in other roles.  Merriman (John Welsh) the butler, has an unforgettable manner, voice, and ability to be old but devilish.  Starr (John Cater), the door man and his dog are as unforgettable and necessary as the lavishly designed sets for the production.

Of course there is love in the life of busy Louisa, in the form of Charlie, (Christopher Cazenove, ""Dynasty""). Such going on.  The Bentinck Hotel in London has it all, and it is served as elegantly as the culinary presentations from the kitchen of Louisa. You will eat it up.

The story is based upon a truth and the owner of London's Cavendish Hotel. It is BBC British drama comedy at it's finest and garnished liberally with laughable situations.",1230336000,3,1651,4.7177700348432055
3447184,5,B001ADXWYC,"We first rented this entire series through Netflix and when we finished the last DVD, we both were caught up in the feeling that we could stay in this time period and with these characters forever they were that engaging. The production is based upon a real life character who lived pretty much as this story unfolds. Which made it twice as compelling.

So, when Amazon.com advertised that they were going to sell the DVD collection, I nailed it right away.  I will revisit Duke Street and the charming, engaging and outrageous Louisa Trotter, as played by the peerless Gemma Jones as the Duchess/Cook/Chatelaine, again and again. The entire casting is absolutely superior in the acting as is the story telling. It is typical British fare, elegant, classy, sly, dignified, restrained, stoical within a convoluted story line and fascinating characterizations by the actors. Even the irresistable dog Fred that the doorman Mr. Starr kept as his buddy and to fill his lonely heart. The series first appeared on Masterpiece Theater.  And, in my opinion, it is true to the reason as to why this production is considered a timeless Masterpiece.",1230249600,92,1138,4.978947368421053
3447185,5,B001ADXWYC,"Being a lover of 'British period drama,' this dvd series was a great find to add to my library. It's set in an very interesting time period - before, during and after WWI. The fact that it's hours of viewing, filled with great characters and acting, based on the real life of an amazing woman, ahead of her time, made it all the more enjoyable. I highly recommend it!",1227312000,3,367,4.333333333333333
3447186,5,B001ADXWYC,"Knowing the work of John Hawkesworth's Upstairs, Downstairs, I was intrigued in finding that from the golden age of Masterpiece Theater this beloved British miniseries entitled ""The Duchess of Duke Street"" was available on DVD.
 This miniseries consists of two series.  The first series consisted of 15 episodes and the second series had 16 episodes.
 Gemma Jones creates a role in which Louisa Trotter born to the servant class rises from a scullery maid to become a World Class Chef.  In time she learns the rules of high society from powerful men.  In all this she never loses her Cockney attitude or the Cockney accent.  This story is based on the true epics of Rosa Lewis who was a World Class Chef at London's venerable Cavendish Hotel.
 Louisa Trotter becomes the hostess and owner of Bentinik's.  During her reign before and during World War I through to the roaring 20's we find Louisa dealing with the trials and tribulations of her guests as well as her rather eclectic staff.  You will take comfort in the antics of the dear old Major as well as the dog Jack who greets the clientele at Bentinik's.
 In the course of the miniseries, we see Louisa's story including an affair with the Prince of Wales, an unhappy marriage and monetary problems.  Also along the way she has to deal with an out of wedlock birth and deal with the death of her one and only true love.
 Through thick and thin Louisa maintains the proper British stiff upper lip.  Gemma Jones is masterful.  Great Series!  Six Stars!!  No Problem!!!",1225584000,15,1522,4.686792452830189
3447187,5,B001ADXWYC,"I fell in love with ""The Duchess"" back in 1976 when it was first broadcast, nothing has changed.  The color is good and the price is right for the entire series.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Upstairs, Downstairs.

The only negative I can say about the collection is the ""jewel"" case packaging.  When I opened the case and tried to removed the DVD's (there are a total of ten) I had a terrible time trying to ""pry"" them out.  I'm going to go a buy a case with sleeves so I won't damage or warp the DVD trying to remove them from the plastic case it came in.  I want to enjoy this over and over again.

I'm still giving this collection 5 stars....",1221091200,6,663,4.173228346456693

3447190,5,B001ADXWYC,"The Duchess of Duke Street is based on the real life of Rosa Lewis, Gemma Jones portrays Louisa Leyton Trotter. Cockney Louisa Leyton wants to better her position from scullery maid and decides to do that by becoming a top cook and feeding the rich and famous.

Series One (15 Episodes) - Sees Louisa take a position as a scullery maid in an upper class house.  She quickly finds out that there is only one way improve her life and that is to learn how to be a great cook.  Along the way she becomes London's premier hostess and owner of Bentinck's.  But even with all this sucess, she cannot have the man she loves.

Series Two (16 Episodes) - Louisa continues her success through the great war and into the the Roaring Twenties.  But Louisa's kind heart (during the war she opens Bentinck's to soldiers but never cashes their checks) brings her to the brink of financial ruin.

Gemma Jones gives a fantastic performance and the series is worth watching just for this. But this show is superbly written and directed.  Series was created by Upstairs, Downstairs producer John Hawkesworth.

But when you watch it, plan on spending the entire weekend infront of you TV with a running time of over 27 hours!!

3447201,5,B001ADXWYC,"I can now relax. This series ran so many years ago that there may be far fewer people interested in buying it now, so the manufacturers could discontinue it at any time. I am replacing my VHS library with DVDs of my favorite escapist fare and I was delighted to find this series on disc.

3447223,5,B001ADXWYC,"My husband and I watched the series last year on streaming movies and TV shows. The final season was not available, so we watched it on You Tube. We fell in love with the Series. It's old school and a period drama, nonetheless, it made a mark in our hearts. Louisa Trotter was best portrayed by Gemma Jones. The main character has a very thick accent, nevertheless, she was so captivating. Based on true story, the screenwriters did such a good job in making each episode interesting and exciting. It became a part of our daily morning show while drinking our green smoothies way through early lunch or afternoon tea. We visited UK in 2014, which made us clamor for British period dramas mostly created by PBS on Netflix. Fortunately, in our searches, we stumbled into this great TV show and has given us sort of an education into the life and history of people across the pond. We were fortunate enough to be able to watch many English TV series in the process. I hope to find great TV shows like this again in the future. I highly recommend this TV series and I might buy this collection as a keepsake and to watch again.",1497916800,,1123,4.456310679611651

It remains one of the best of BBC costume dramas, in which the snobbish world of England before the first World War is abruptly juxtaposed with the great changes in society due to it, which directly impact on Mrs Trotter, her hotel and her lover. Wonderful performances both from Gemma Jones in the title role (who should be first in the heading above, not Christopher Cazenove who plays Lord Hazlemere), and from a host of gifted character actors - both the workers at Bentinck's hotel, who appear in most episodes - Starr (and his dog Fred), Merriman and Mary (Louisa's trusted assistant), but also individuals who appear in only one episode. No other nation has ever been able to field such gifted character actors in a period drama - neither the Americans nor the Australians could come within cooee of creating a series like this.

So if you have a dog, keep in mind that they didn't know the harm they were doing and please do not follow their example with your own animal(s). Other than that, I can't recommend this show enough!

One other thing: Regarding the Closed Captioning. The CC works on my television when I play the discs on my DVD player. But when I watch the discs on my computer there is no way to opt to use the CC. Since some people are hearing impaired, and others have trouble with the various U.K. accents, the CC option is usually necessary for viewing. So keep this in mind when you purchase this set. Since only Series One (Season One)  is available to stream on Amazon at this time (and does have fully functional CC) you may want to buy the complete series to see the second season. If you like the first season, you'll like the second season.

Each episode covers so much ground, it feels like you've watched two or three seasons of the show by the end of the first season alone.  If only they made shows like this now, with a stronger emphasis on the story; instead of fulfilling the actor's contractual demands for close ups and number of lines guaranteed per scene. I get that actors bring in viewers, but without a story, nobody's going to stick around for the next episode of any show. This show is a welcome departure from today's all too commonly formulaic approach to dramas.",1463356800,2,1690,4.459546925566343

Imagine my delight at getting this since it's no longer offered in streaming on Prime. Then when I watched it, I was SO disappointed because there are no closed captions. I had to turn the volume up to about 50, and still couldn't understand what most of the actors were saying. THEN, the next disappointment was having to keep track of which episode I'd watched. Instead of advancing to the next episode, it stayed on the one I had previously watched; therefore, I ended up starting the same episode again. Now I have to write down which episode I finished watching, then when I go back the next day, I choose the Select Episode option, and navigate to the one I want. Needless to say, this doesn't make it easy. I don't have this problem with other DVDs. Maybe it's because this one is old. I would give the storyline and cast FIVE stars, but I'd give the DVD a ONE star.",1451347200,3,1007,4.419354838709677

She handles life with wisdom, determination  and courage, and yet,like most women, she unwillingly becomes vulnerable to Charlie, the love of her life. I found these episodes ( all 31 of them ) to be quite entertaining and I admired Louisa as she handled the life obstacles that came her way. A  confident and hard working woman, Louisa dealt with everyone fairly, from royalty to the servants who worked at the Benthnick Hotrel.

But isn't anyone offended by the fact that a rape was committed?  Was it so ""dressed up"" as to not seem like a rape?  Ms. Trotter had no other choice but to compromise herself with the Prince.  She would have never been able to fulfill her dreams if she had refused.  Yes, she received much for the act but that's still prostitution, no matter the amount, right?  I can see it being considered fine in the period this happened, what I don't understand is why it's not seen differently in 1976 'till now?  No small wonder people are confused about this issue.

Born into the servant class Louise Leyton makes her way to the top as the most celebrated cook in Edwardian London. Louise, later known to all as Mrs. Trotter, becomes the owner of a very exclusive hotel with the most interesting cast of characters you will ever meet, both guests and servants, each one interwoven with one another to the delight of the viewer. THE DUCHESS OF DUKE STREET is full of heart, soul, laughter and tears. Gemma Jones is a power house and carries the story like the star that she is.

After purchasing the dvd collection,I came to realize, how exceptional the series truly was. I had forgotten the amazing characters of Louisa, Mary, the Major and Charlie. Jemma Jones's performance was a tour de force of acting. To say that I adored each episode, would be an understatement. The series is a true joy from beginning to end. Knowing that the character, Louisa Trotter, is based on the amazing Rosa Lewis, of the Cavendish Hotel of London, only added  to the pleasure. This is the story of a true feminist, who succeeded in a by gone era, on her own terms. What a character! What a lady! What a joy to view!

3447360,5,B001ADXWYC,"This is definitely one of the best British TV Series that I have viewed ! Acting is superb, story is well done, and the episodes are the perfect length. There are 31 hour long episodes in the complete series so it does take a bit of time to enjoy all of the stories. Fortunately, each episodes stands on its own and is not dependent on previous episodes in order to follow the self contained stories. In the way of very minor criticism, I wish that the series had sub titles. The dialogue is fast paced so perhaps it would have been difficult. The Cockney accent is hard to follow and I feel that I have lost a bit by not understanding all that is said. Nevertheless, the other British accents are very discernable and easy to follow. It does take a bit of getting used to and as the stories move on, I have become somewhat more comfortable in appreciating the dialogue. In particular, Louise Trotter, and Mr. Merriman are the most difficult to follow. The ""Major"" is an especially interesting character and I believe could be the subject of his own series. He is certainly a mystery man. Overall, the series fully merits the unusually high five star rating !

Series 2 is even better (both series are in the complete set). The series follows up with events and activities of the player during WWI with many surprises. The cast of characters is able to skillfully deal with all of the many circumstances and situations which confront them and the usual humor, drama, and suspense is ever present in each of the episode. There are 31 episodes in the set; getting to the last episode is defintely worth going through all of the 31 episodes. I actually thought that series 2 was much better than series 1, perhaps because the actors had become more familiar with their roles or perhaps because having WWI as the background period made it much more dramatic and intense. Lotte emerges in the final episodes and adds a great deal to the stories.

This was one of the BEST ! Don't miss it !",1401408000,16,1984,4.508333333333334

3447368,5,B001ADXWYC,"I have wanted to get this collection for a long time. It is a portrait of England during the time of Edward VII and how a lower class woman rose to the dubious position of hotel proprietor where she entertained distinguished guests. It is a look at the class separations of that age and the problems of a lower class woman falling in love with an upperclass man. I found this series captivating and I found myself rooting for the main character, Louisa, and her undying love for a vicount, and his undying love for her  and the barriers they faced in a society rigidly defined by class status. It is so realistic, and in places very sad as the story goes into World War I and some of the tragedies that the war caused. I loved this series from the start when I saw it on Masterpiece Theater years ago. It is just as fascinating now as it was then. I recommend it to anyone who likes English drama. -- Valerie Lull, Author, Ten Healthy Teas",1396483200,23,939,4.305084745762712
3447369,5,B001ADXWYC,"I saw this at the library about six years ago and thought - okay, I'll try something new.  Checked it out on old VHS tapes - just the first season.  I was IMMEDIATELY delighted by this story!

The characters are rich, and so well developed that you fall in love with them all, honestly.  Excellent acting - excellent.  Beautiful costumes, beautiful settings.  And the PLOT - boooo to all the reviews who have called this series ""boring.""  It is everything BUT boring!  This captured my attention from the beginning and carried me through to the end.  (And if it's any clue, one of the low star reviewers said, ""Don't WAIST your time.""  If you have an education, believe me, this series is NOT a WASTE of time.)

I don't want to give away anything - other reviews have given you a brief plot outline.  I later found out it was loosely based around actual people and events and was even more enthralled.  I have watched, rewatched, and rewatched.  At first, I just kept watching the first season - I never knew there was a second.  When my library obtained the second (on DVD) I was literally jumping up and down in the aisle and wanted to just shriek - an entire new adventure to all these lovely, wonderful characters that begin to seem like family!

***SPOILER ALERT, please do not read on if you haven't seen the series but are looking to!!!

Absolutely true that there are sad endings - but you know what?  People and dogs die.  Joseph gets a new dog, and Charlie's legacy will live on.  That was the saddest part for me, I guess - that, and the ending of the series.  I just want more and more!",1396310400,7,1598,4.404109589041096

It is very well done and Christians can watch it, if they don't have issues with UK swear words (bloody, krikey etc).

I found some episodes to be a little too much and boring so I did a FF thru some of it but on the whole it's a good series and a long series.  It is based on a true character and so that made it more interesting because she, the Duchess, is something else.  She's quite the lady and let's absolutely no one get the better of her........you end up really liking her even though some of her ways are a bit much and sometimes she gets carried away.  She certainly had her work cut out for her and she met the challenge head on.  When all is said and done, I would have liked to have been a guest at the hotel and I would have liked to have known her.  Many other interesting characters in it also.  Her mother was a real gem......!!!

Mostly good quality considering the series was filmed and produced in the 70's.  I will agree with several comments that some of the dialogue is often difficult to understand because of accents.  I still enjoyed this Masterpiece Theater production with its beautiful story line loosely based on Rosa Lewis, a remarkable woman with a knack for cooking. With her exceptionally sharp wit, she went from scrubbing kitchen floors to entertaining aristocracy.  Not Downton Abbey, but of more substance in my opinion.

The story focus's on the hotel she buys and the characters and staff that inhabit it. Usually the English sets are quite elaborate but that is not the case here.

Being the daughter of a Cornishman I am particularly amused and delighted with Gemma Jones and her characterization of Louisa.

I really cannot compare to any other story of it's type because this one was so very special in it's subject matter.  I suppose one could call it a soap opera of the 70's.

3447402,5,B001ADXWYC,"Downton Abbey is currently the rage in TV Period Drama. Passing time shall determine how deserving it is of its youthful accolades. However, The Duchess of Duke Street stands historically tall as a classic series produced and presented in 1976-1977 by the BBC through Masterpiece Theatre on PBS. This 31- episode series truly captures the essence of the Edwardian era and takes us into the mid-roaring 1920's.

This engaging series is as fresh today as when first shown. Its superb writing, production values and cast portrayals are deeply heart-wrenching, yet contain near side-splitting humor as part of the mix of emotions evoked. Gemma Jones plays Louisa Trotter, a feisty young woman determined to become the best cook in England as she overcomes daunting obstacles in the process. Ms. Jones is magnificent as the headliner in a most brilliant cast of London's best actors of the day. Indeed, she cooks a most scrumptious feast presented by all involved in the best tradition of British Period Drama. I shall view this series again, and wholeheartedly recommend it to you. Surely, you shall be left, as me, wanting to taste morsels of this wonderful fare that you missed savoring during the first sitting. Excellent series!",1378944000,10,1228,5.079207920792079

You won't be disappointed with this series. Along with Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth, the Duchess of Duke Street is one of my all-time favorite mini-series ever made.  My only teeny, tiny annoyance is that the DVDs look like they were copied from VHS tapes. The picture quality doesn't seem as crisp as I anticipated on my high-def television.  But that's okay.

3447409,5,B001ADXWYC,"The Duchess of Duke Street was a mini-series of 31 episodes in two seasons created during the Golden Age of British television production in the 1960s-1970s.  It is a dramatization based on the real life of the ""Queen of Cooks"" Rosa Lewis, whose Cavendish Hotel on Jermyn Street in London was known for decades as one of the finest establishments in Britain.

This version begins with the young and ambitious Louisa Leyton, born into a lower class family who cherishes the seemingly hopeless desire to become a great cook.  The first series chronicles Louisa's adventures as she struggled to the top.  She started out as an assistant cook in a noble household, became ""friends"" with the future King Edward VII, made a disastrous marriage with a dimwitted butler, fell in love with the debonaire Viscount Haslemere, and eventually became chatelaine of the Bentinck Hotel on Duke Street. There she became well known for the homey atmosphere of her hotel, which catered to the most select clientele, and for the excellence of her cooking. The first series' episodes are fairly self-contained, usually featuring some misadventure of Louisa's such as her encounter with an investigative journalist or her feud with the ladies of a yachting club. There is also a continuing story line dealing with the love between Louisa and Lord Haslemere which resulted in the birth of a daughter.  The first series ends around the death of King Edward VII in 1910.

The second series begins shortly thereafter, with several disconnected episodes leading into World War I.  The next five or six episodes deal with Louisa's wartime experiences and ably depict the privations and sadnesses of the period.  They are easily the best episodes of the second season.  The last few episodes showing Louisa and the Bentinck in the 1920s don't appeal to me as much, primarily because Louisa is so quintessentially Edwardian that she seems out of place in the Jazz Age.

The Duchess of Duke Street features beautiful sets and costumes and fine acting by some of the best British talent of the time. Gemma Jones and Christopher Cazenove play Louisa and Charlie Haslemere, and there are many appearances by the likes of Anthony Andrews, Richard Vernon, Angharad Rees, and many more.  The episodes vary in quality, and I don't think the entire series ever reaches the heights of such sublime productions from the period as Upstairs, Downstairs or The Forsyte Saga, but The Duchess of Duke Street is entertaining and Louisa is always a lot of fun, so it's well worth watching.",1371513600,5,2541,4.96933962264151
3447410,5,B001ADXWYC,This has been one of my absolute show of all times. Gemma Jones is the best!!!  I've loved her in all her roles.,1369267200,2,112,3.869565217391304

3447412,5,B001ADXWYC,"I saw The Duchesse of Duke Street for the first time when I was a child and I was so impressed that decades later I still remembering the dresses, the complexity and beauty of tables and cooking and how smart the plot was. I began to look for it and I decided to buy it some months ago. Looking at it now I recognize all the qualities that make me love those series. They are exquisite, whit this intelligent and subtle English humour, with strong and well defined characters and its a reliable way to penetrate in the everyday life at the beginning of XX century. It has too a superb, intelligent and surprising plot that can be hilarious sometimes or utterly dramatic. Another important positive: the video prints and sound are excellent.  I recommend it strongly.",1367625600,3,766,4.591240875912408

3447414,5,B001ADXWYC,"This is one of those series that exemplifies what is great about British drama and how it contrasts to the typical American series.  The lead character, Mrs. Trotter, is frustratingly flawed, single minded, ambitious and quick-tempered, but a fighter who claws her way into success as Britain's most famous cook and the owner of a discreet hotel that caters to wealthy aristocrats.  But unlike many American shows where the love story between the two main characters seems artificially constructed to purposefully keep them apart until the last season when everything ends in roses, the prickly relationship between Mrs. Trotter and Charlie (a Lord) is  organic to the nature of each of them and unpredictable as a result. There is no guarantee things will work out, rather like in real life.  Another thing, the British don't pull their series abruptly based on ratings, and those of us who invest time in some of the past network offerings often are left hanging and wishing we'd never even wasted our time.  The Dutchess of Duke Street has 31 episodes and follows the characters over a 25 year period.  It is a fascinating window into the life and times of the classes during the last gasp of the British master/servant way of life with more meat on the bone than Downton Abbey.  Thoroughly enjoyable!",1367107200,5,1304,4.9

Also there are times when the quality of the picture is not up to current standards.  The Duchess is brash and brawdy sometimes, but also very gentle and kind other times.",1363392000,,340,4.451612903225806
3447421,2,B001ADXWYC,"If you have any trouble with extreme cockney English, then you'll spend most of you time trying to understand what's being said by Gemma Jones, et.al.  Unfortunately, there are no English Subtitles for the hearing impaired.  In my opinion, if there was ever a TV series that cried out for Subtitles this is it!  However, I assume for the sake of the bottom line, Acorn Media rarely includes English Subtitles.
  Another strange, obsessive occurrence is the constant drinking that must take place in almost every scene, especially after Louisa begins to run the hotel.  I don't mean that people are getting drunk....it's just that almost every scene seems to demand that activity.  I assume the writer/director believed this was a logical prop that would keep the actors' hands occupied.  I hate to ruin this for anyone, but just take the time to count the scenes in which they must have a drink in their hands.  There is one humorous occasion in which everyone in the room has a drink in their hands, and during the conversation someone makes an impressive point, at which one of the guests says, ""Well, I think that calls for a drink!""",1363219200,6,1136,4.755102040816326

3447425,4,B001ADXWYC,"I love The Duchess Duke Street: Complete Collection.  For the price this series is on offer for right now this is an unqualified steal.  I watched this series last when I was in high school over twenty years ago and I never forgot it.  However I was just a wet behind the ears cub back then so much of the sexual overtones and interpersonal intrigues went right over my head.  Being autistic I was hardly a man of the world then or now.  I brought The Duchess Duke Street to relive my past joys. Funny that now I am an autistic man in my early fifties, I see and understand things in The Duchess Duke Street that I never understood before. I just liked the characters and settings in The Duchess Duke Street when I was young.  But 20 plus years hence I actually see new depths in Duchess Duke Street characters.  Some of the acting is not perfect but for the most part I think The Duchess Duke Street is pretty spot on for attempting to bring 1900's Edwardian England to life.  I love the old cars.  I love watching the culture make the switch from candles and oil lamps to Electricity.

There was one story flaw I noted. This fictional Bentick Hotel was supposed to cater to the United Kingdom posh upper classes.  Why is their no elevator at the pupscale Bemtick surely Elisha Graves Otis and his invention of the safety elevator and founding of his Otis Elevator Company in 1853 did not escape notice in 1910 London.  Thomas Alva Edison's light bulb and Alexander Graham Bell's telephone did not escape notice and were used in the in The Duchess Duke Street's Bentick Hotel.  Yet the (Elevator) or Lift seems oddly absent at the Bentick.  I'm shocked at the absence of a lift; the series suggests the Bentick is a Hotel frequented by one's ""Betters"" of Early 1900's London society. You would think a posh Hotel would invest in an ""Lift"" for the safety and comfort of its older guests.  Watching all these old folk trudging up stairs and watching bell hops carrying heavy bags up stairs made the supposedly upscale Bentick Hotel rather ghetto.  The lack of an lift always reminded me I was watching a badly written TV drama. I'm a geek so when appropriate technology is incorrect or missing, I notice.  However one suspends belief when watching TV to allow one's self to be transported to a different place and time.  On the Main The Duchess Duke Street got most things right lift or no lift.  Still The Duchess Duke Street was well done.  I enjoyed the actors and felt they were generally awesome.

Now the English accents were pretty darn good bordering on perfection which is why some in the United States have a hard time understanding what is being said. Fortunately I've watched British Comedy for ages so I grew up with the thick British accents and understand 99% of them with relative ease.  The hardest British Accents for US citizens to understand are Somerset, Yorkshire and Cockney because; the words melt together into a pool of sound like a song.  Some have trouble with thick Irish and Scottish accents as well, I can handle them all.  The only real dislike I have for this Duchess Duke Street Collection is that some of the transfers are really bad.  Not all but some transfers are faded, fuzzy, washed out and dark like someone did not care about quality at all.  Generally Acorn Studios does a pretty bad job of making transfers of its items.  However The Duchess Duke Street Collection is still very watchable.  Also it must be noted that in the The Duchess Duke Street series we are talking stock that is well over 20 years old and I can't expect Acorn to work miracles on old footage.  I am thankful that Acorn released The Duchess Duke Street even in this condition it is awesome to have in my collection.  I took one star off for the flaws noted herein.  The sound quality a slight hiss is evident in some areas so while not perfect sound quality is acceptable.  All that said, The Duchess Duke Street still gets four stars from me.  I am happy to have purchased The Duchess Duke Street it is fun to watch.  I enjoy the characters even the ones who are ripe stinkers morally speaking!",1361145600,4,4110,4.524390243902439
3447426,5,B001ADXWYC,"I've recently become interested in historical stories (books and movies/tv) set in London, from the Georgian Era through the 1920's. The tales of the ton is so fascinating! I thoroughly enjoyed this series. More than enjoyed really, I loved it! The acting is superb and after the first 30 minutes, the world of Louisa Trotter gripped me and I felt so involved in the story, the characters, their joys and their sadness. There are so many ups and downs and through it all, I was taken for an emotional and entertaining ride. I laughed and cried, sobbed! I will need an emotional break before I can watch this series again because after the last episode, I was distraught from missing my ""friends"" at the Bentinck Hotel. I know it's silly, but you know that feeling of sadness/depression one feels after going home from a long and wonderful vacation - that's how I felt at the end. Wonderful series! I wish there were more shows that focused on characters, people interaction, and good writing rather than all the mindless reality, sordid, and shock-value television that bombards (American) tv today.

This series is so old that there's probably not too many who doesn't yet know what happened, but here's a ***Spoiler warning*** nonetheless.  I was incredibly happy to see in the middle of Series 2 that Louisa and Charlie were finally getting together and getting married..they deserved a happily ever after. THEN... Charlie dies!! OMG! I cannot tell you how devastated I was..shocked! Shattered! Did anyone else feel like this?? They were so close to their happy ending. Is this what really happened to Rosa Lewis? I certainly hope not because it was such a cruel fate. If it is fictional, I am not at all happy with the producers for not giving its audience a happy ending. His death is what makes it hard to re-watch the show because the whole time I was hopeful and waiting for their happily ever after. I cannot believe it didn't end that way.",1360540800,,1949,4.7463126843657815

3447428,5,B001ADXWYC,"What a remarkable series this collection is and it stands well the test of time. Even though the production was broadcast almost 40 years ago, the sharpness of dialogue, the beauty of sets, the loveliness of costuming and staging and the telling of a life's story all bring support to the outstanding performances. You won't forget the Duchess, or Charlie, or any of the other persons in the story based on Rosa Lewis's life. She lived..........and so does this BBC Masterpiece production of 31 episodes.

For some viewers, the only drawback I can mention is Rosa's heavy Cockney accent, so truly maintained by Gemma Jones in the title role. On occasion, it was difficult to catch every word she spoke, but no matter.........the plot was clear and her dialogue could easily be interpreted!",1360022400,2,789,4.932330827067669

3447440,4,B001ADXWYC,"The only reason that I didn't give this 5 stars was the fact that the main character Louisa (Gemma Jones) was a bitch and a half.  She treats the staff of her hotel as if they are incompetent idiots and her tirades and rantings about relatively minor issues were quite aggravating. I was just never able to warm up to her abrasive nature.  But hey, I'm sure that at the turn of the century there were owners like this and maybe running a tight ship was necessary to run a top class hotel.  My wife doesn't share my feelings so perhaps I am in a distinct minority.

The rest of the cast is superb.  Of special note is Christopher Cazenove who plays Louisa's love interest Charlie.  Charlie is the direct opposite of Louisa, soft-spoken and with a mild temperament.  I did have a difficult time believing that he could be romantically interested in Louisa but he was often a calming influence when they were together.  The actors playing the hotel staff: Mary, Merriman, Starr and the Major were most entertaining giving both humorous and sometimes heartbreaking performances.

Highly recommended.",1348617600,,1095,4.751322751322752

3447442,5,B001ADXWYC,"Gemma Jones is ""The Duchess of Duke Street"". She plays Louisa, an artist with food, and proves to be the queen (oops, Duchess) of society finery when it comes to providing the best possible hotel. It is her goal, her dream, and her zealous ambition.

Along the way of creating this BBC drama/comedy series (PBS Masterpiece Theatre) she is joined in other cast members who also prove to be so likable and memorable that the entire cast becomes family. This similar thing happens in ""Monarch of the Glen"", also recommended. This story is a period from WWI through the 1920s. And along with the rest of the world, the Duchess of Duke Street ""roars"" through the 20's. With it you will experience every emotion imaginable, from love to hate, fear to peace, sadness to belly busting joy, laugh and cry at the same time.

Besides Gemma Jones there are other top performances that will remain with you every time you again see the actors and actresses in other roles. Merriman (John Welsh) the butler, has an unforgettable manner, voice, and ability to be old but devilish. Starr (John Cater), the door man and his dog are as unforgettable and necessary as the lavishly designed sets for the production.

Of course there is love in the life of busy Louisa, in the form of Charlie, (Christopher Cazenove, ""Dynasty""). Such going on. The Bentinck Hotel in London has it all, and it is served as elegantly as the culinary presentations from the kitchen of Louisa. You will eat it up.

The story is based upon a truth and the owner of London's Cavendish Hotel. It is BBC British drama comedy at it's finest and garnished liberally with laughable situations.

3447455,5,B001ADXWYC,My Sis and I watch this together and have enjoyed it very much.  there are a few glitches but not enough to down rate this wonderful series.,1301011200,,140,4.185185185185185
3447456,5,B001ADXWYC,"I first had it on video, and a few years ago bought it on DVD because I liked the stories. BUT my big (and it is BIG) complaint was I couldn't understand much of the language.  The cockney, Welsh, etc. was so broad and so very fast, I missed most of the conversation.  We do have a very different sounding language unless the British characters speak more slowly and more distinctly which they do not so in very much of this series, therefore I missed most of the conversation, though I pretty much understood what was going on. I'm sorry subtitles weren't added as they are in most American films these days. Some British films don't need subtitles as the characters speak clearly and Americans can understand. Example: Helen Mirren in ""The Queen"" but in her series ""Prime Suspect"" most of the characters were impossible to understand, except for her and a couple of others.

The ending disappointed me.  I waited for such a long time for Charley and Louisa to finally wed, and then Charley was written off.  As for Louisa's daughter, she had a very thin voice, and though she was a pretty good actress, doubt she could have become a professional singer.

But there were so many good stories. The one I didn't care for, was the one with Star and his ex wife, but for the most part the stories were excellent and lots of fun, and I've watched it many times. Especially liked the way the clothes changed, and other modern conveniences came about in the hotel and the kitchen as the years went by.

I would have liked to see more cooking by Louisa going from house to house, because she pretty much stopped after she left her job, and opened a hotel, but now and then she did it again.  Mostly her part was dealing with people in the hotel.

Thought all the main characters were well done, and fit in perfectly with the Bentinck. One of my favorite chapters was when the newspapers tried to catch Louisa's hotel in some bad publicity, but it backfired when the Prince's picture was spotted on the wall of Louisa's office!  Another good chapter was when Charley got locked into a court trial over breaking an engagement to a dancer.  Of course he was never really engaged to the dancer, and the dancer lost the trial.

Anyway, except for the language problem I enjoyed the series, though my husband didn't watch it as he couldn't understand the language.",1297209600,,2351,4.545023696682464

Why did Louisa have to ride off in her carriage leaving her disowned daughter to have to fend for herself?  I mean, come on.  All this unhappiness?  Why?  The ""guest writers"" perpetrated most of these unhappy endings.  I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, since the time this series was made, the modern world was in the midst of being assaulted by the Radical Marxist Left, which continues to haunt us to this day.  Tear down institutions, tear down the stage.  Ruin the endings.  Don't let people be happy.  The 1960's are the worst thing that happened to this world, and this series proves it.  I buy movies to be entertained, not walk away depressed, sad, and unhappy, which is the exact intent of these sad endings.  I gave this series 3 stars only because of the great actors.  Other than that, I didn't care for all of its many purposeful unhappy and depressing endings.",1291680000,6,984,4.580459770114943

3447463,5,B001ADXWYC,"I found this movie by accident. Gemma Jones stars as The Duchess of Duke Street. She is amazing in this role. I have watched it three times, which considering there are 31 episodes, must tell you how much I loved this movie!

It's a story about a young woman who fights her way up in the work force by starting as a servant in various homes, to becoming the best cook in England! She learns to cook from a male French chef. He thinks only men make good chefs and women are useless in general, let alone becoming chefs. She takes all he dishes out and then some. He ends up having great respect for her and becomes quite fond of her.

This teaches life lessons especially for girls as well as anyone who believes in themselves and won't let anyone or anything stand in her/their way.

This is one of the best films I have ever seen. I bought it for my daughter because she fell in love with it too.

There's romance, mystery, comedy, drama etc. Just buy it. You will not regret it. If I could meet Gemma Jones, It would be my honor to congratulate her on her best role ever. I have seen her in other movies and she can hold her own, but this one made her the star she is. I respect her and just love her acting abilities.",1275264000,2,1220,4.156779661016949

I've never seen a show that has so much emotional content and that's so unremmitingly honest about what it is to be human.  There's certainly nothing like it on TV now.  The acting is outstanding!  I don't think American actors now can touch any of the acting in this series.  It's a tear-jerker at times because it doesn't flinch.

3447471,5,B001ADXWYC,"If you enjoyed the portrayal of the class system during the early 1900's, this saga will ""knock your knickers off.""  As in Upstairs/Downstairs, the main story is made up of a central cast of characters with various sub-stories offering ""stand alone"" episodes. This series had many more characters than Upstairs/Downstairs because it was set in a private residential hotel, allowing a full range of people to enter the series then leave at the conclusion of a particular episode, either showing up in a later episode or disappearing... POOF!!!

Thoughtfully cast, designed, written and acted.  Not a snooty piece of literature, it is the backbone of British TV entertainments.

3447472,5,B001ADXWYC,"Trust me, The Duchess of Duke Street, a period drama that spans the last years of Queen Victoria's reign through to the post WWI era, will easily become one of your favorite BBC dramas, holding your attention from beginning to end.

The sets and clothing are gorgeous, loaded with wonderful details that are positively lavish. Even the newspapers shown being read by patrons or hotel staff are accurate with the headlines, articles and advertisements.  I'm on my third viewing and am enjoying it as much as ever.

The DVD transfer is clear and the sound crisp, so sit back with a cup of tea and a crumpet for hours of marvelous entertainment.

Gemma Jones gives a tour-de-force performance as Louisa, a witty, intelligent, wonderfully endearing woman with a larger-than-life personality and a heart of gold.  She comes to work as a cook for a family of the upper crust. The French chef who supervises the downstairs service takes a liking to Louisa and before long she is given the opportunity to cook for a special dinner party that includes the Prince of Wales.  The Prince takes a shining to Louisa and this royal association raises her to the status of a highly esteemed cook for posh functions, ultimately resulting in Louisa becoming the proprietor of the Bentinck Hotel, which quickly becomes THE hotel for all the rich and socially renowned.  A venturesome Viscount, Charlie, who becomes a permanent resident, manages to steal Louisa's heart as well as offer her his own.  Theirs is a relationship that brings both great joy and great sorrow.

The comings and goings at the Bentinck will keep you eager to watch one segment after another.  There's never a dull moment when Louisa and her eccentric staff are going about their business - be it upstairs, downstairs or during her two-fold contribution to the war effort.  During the second season, we really get to see deep into the soul of Louisa.  The series ends with joy and vitality, which is the heart of her strong spirit.

This is BBC at its best.",1259539200,8,2011,4.777456647398844

I found some of the vignettes very boring and had to stop myself from skipping on to the next disc.  I am usually one who can't wait to see the next chapter as in the case of Jewel In The Crown, Brideshead Revisited, Reckless, House of Elliott, State of Play or The Last Viceroy but I kept looking for something else to watch rather than going back to struggle through the next chapter in our subject review.  I still have one more to watch before I'm through with this.  I give Fred 5 Stars.
Speaking of discs and concurring with those before me who have had difficulty removing them from their container, I heartily agree!  Ridiculous!",1254096000,7,767,4.397163120567376
3447474,5,B001ADXWYC,"I didn't think that I could like anything better than Upstairs Downstairs but I was so wrong.  This series is so much more visually appealing.  The detail of the furnishings and period clothing alone make it worth viewing.

Gemma Jones who plays Mrs. Trotter, The Duchess of Duke Street, is good, to be sure, but we all have our favorite characters and mine is Merriman the butler played by John Welsh.  His understated manner and wit had me chuckling as I viewed each episode.  As in Upstairs Downstairs, though, there is one servant who is treated badly.  In UD, it was Ruby; in the DODS, it was Merriman.  Granted, some of it was good-natured teasing but much of it was not.  The disrespect that was shown to an octagenarian is disgraceful.

Some of the episodes were difficult to watch especially during the WWI episodes; a lot of death and tragedy but then, that's war, isn't it?  I will say that the last 5 episodes took a turn that I didn't particularly care for but if I tell you what they are, it will spoil things for you.  I can say, however, that the character of Lottie is most disagreeable.  She has aspirations of becoming a professional singer and the woman who played her, Lalla Ward, *cannot* sing.  Her voice is weak, thin and trembly and I should think that they could've cast someone better for the part.  In my opinion, she dragged the series down but I still gave it a 5 star rating because she didn't enter the picture until close to the end.  Had she been introduced earlier, I may not have liked the series so much.

I feel sad having come to the end and will definitely view this series again this winter during the cold, snowy months, sitting by the fire while sipping some English tea.  A must see and worth every penny.",1253577600,50,1749,4.466876971608833
3447475,5,B001ADXWYC,"Nobody did drama like the BBC in the 1970s.  Upstairs Downstairs, The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes (which is not and should be available on DVD), The Pallisers, Edward the King, and Lillie are the gold standards for TV drama. The Duchess of Duke Street is one of the best.

Gemma Jones is superb as the hard-working, irascible and generous Louisa Trotter, whose single minded goal is to become the best cook in England and takes a job assisting the chef de cuisine at a great London house.  She refuses to be distracted by superfluities such as the French chef's insistance that women cannot cook, the unwelcome attentions of the son of the house, and an unfortunate marriage brought about by pressure from the Prince of Wales. Time and time again, Louisa turns bad luck into opportunity and succeeds through determination and hard work.

Though Louisa faces devastating setbacks, she perserveres and creates an amazing and unconventional life surrounded by colorful characters and peppered with sparkling events and heartbreak.  From the beginning, she insists on being independent and is fiercely loyal to her friends.  This independence and loyalty as well as her cooking skills make for unforgettable stories within Louisa's story.  I sat down to watch DDS 1 and 2 over the holiday weekend for the first time since they originally aired on PBS, and it's just as fresh and wonderful as the first time I saw it. Gemma Jones' amazing Louisa effortlessly carries the two series, though she is supported by excellent actors and, as always, the BBC's costuming, sets and props are flawless.

The story of Rosa Lewis, the real Louisa, is just as charming and colorful as told in The Duchess of Jermyn Street, which is well worth reading for fans of these two series. Edwardian society's excesses during the last days of the British Empire as well as its struggles to adjust to shifting conditions brought about by war and depression are of never ending fascination to me.  The Duchess of Duke Street is the perfect antidote for 21st century tedium, and if nothing else, watching Louisa create all her dishes from scratch makes one appreciate modern kitchen appliances!

Painstakingly produced, it captures the rapt attention of watchers with an endless variety of interests.  Within a fascinating story, it offers, wit, humor, politics, history (as well as ""historical anecdote""), and burgeoning open sexuality against a background of semi-biographical human strife and struggle which never fails to draw me in and hold me.  Watching it takes many, many hours, yet I find myself watching the entire series every few years, observing a new aspect and enjoying myself again.

I knew that I had not seen all of the Episodes when it was presented on Masterpiece Theatre years ago.  I just love the progress of the story and how it related to life in England and to the individuals involved with Mrs. Trotter and her progression in society. Most of all, I loved the honesty and caring person Mrs. Trotter was, despite the many trials and troubles she endured. I also thought that Charlie was a most decent and honorable person despite his station in society.  I believe the actress who played the part was magnificent as was the actor who played Charlie.

3447480,5,B001ADXWYC,"The thing that the BBC production ""The Duchess of Duke Street"" (1976) strikes you most is its remarkable performance, you don't see actors, but characters, and evolving ones, who are simply unforgettable.  The attention put to every detail like accent, gesture, subtlety of emotions, or particulars of settings and costumes is tremendous.  Such impressive performance puts it in the same class as the other great British miniseries such as ""Love for Lydia"" (1977), ""Brideshead Revisited"" (1981), ""Yes, Minister""(1980) and etc., which all give a performance that is extraordinary and memorable.

Unlike ""Love for Lydia"" or ""Brideshead Revisited"", which are incomparable adaptations from novels, and therefore ""reads"" like a novel, ""The Duchess of Duke Street"" was scripted by multiple authors with each episode focusing on a single story, more like the style of ""Yes, Minister"", although more of a biographical drama than a political satire.  Nevertheless, it successfully and vividly tells the life story of a woman, Louisa Leyton, from various angles and stages in the first quarter of the 20th century.  Though from a lower class background, Louisa was ambitious and dreamt to become the best chef in England, she strived hard for that and became an owner of a private hotel, which served exquisite cuisines; and along the way Louisa found the love of her life and the fulfillment of her dream, a kind of shattered one perhaps.  In short, ""The Duchess of Duke Street"" is fascinating, and indeed is one of those few TV dramas that are really worth watching.",1234137600,3,1558,5.162698412698413
