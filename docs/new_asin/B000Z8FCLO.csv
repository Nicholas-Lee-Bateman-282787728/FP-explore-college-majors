8235033,4,B000Z8FCLO,"Police are on strike in Halifax Nova Scotia, Canada which means a lot of scum are loose on the streets. A two bit criminal gang of selfrighteous homophobic bullies start some trouble in a gay bar named the Crypt and by accident the bartender is killed, and the leader of the crew then decides to execute all witnesses. One patron manages to escape and these guys don't want any witnesses. A chase ensues and a couple of friendly people who are working at an intstitute for disabled young people let him in and thats where it goes all wrong. The gang wants the witness and the friendly people don't plan turning him over. What follows is the gang trying to siege the building and the people inside have to defend themselfs all night.

The bad guys have some super cool toys and really cool guns. Special credit should go to Doug Lennox, who plays Cabe, the ice-cold leader of the vigilantes. His stern, chiselled features can give you the creeps, spelling out mayhem and doom for all crossing his path. He is the big boss's right hand man and is such a gas you think he came directly out of an ass.

Despite having been filmed on a shoestring budget, the film has more atmosphere than your average Hollywood thriller. That's partly due to the claustrophobic settings, decaying buildings and dark alleyways but mainly it's the chemistry between the actors that makes this film so enjoyable. Some solid action and it had me on the edge of my seat a couple of times. Siege motors along at a fast pace, no lulls, just scene upon scene of intense cat n mouse between a gang of murderous thugs n a group of people. Simple story buy a classic must see before you die movie for sure.

This movie has John Carpenters fingerprints all over it. Siege is a great entry in the urban survivalist home invasion sub-genre. Similiar movies this remionded me of: this film include: Straw Dogs (1971 & 2011), Panic Room (2002), Assault on Precinct 13 (1976 & 2005), Purge (2013), Escape from New York (1981), The Warriors (1979), Class of 1984 (1982), The Strangers (2008), You're Next (2011), Hush (2016), Them (2006), Preservation (2014), Sorry Wrong Number (1948), When a Stranger Calls (1979 & 2006), Wait Until Dark (1967), Suddenly (1954), Funny Games (1997). That should keep you busy for a while.

I watched this on YouTube in 11 parts that didn't include the 11th part, the ending. Bummer! There is one new copy on Ebay at the time of this writing for $150 or best offer. What a fun great movie and I wish I had it in my collection. The rarity makes it that much better",1462320000,,2558,4.554347826086956
8235034,5,B000Z8FCLO,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie (through YouTube). It's a B-type film, so expect some of the cheap acting and poor cinematics. The only problem was the difficulty of watching it. It is ONLY available on YouTube, cut up in 11 parts, AND THE LAST PART IS MISSING. The ending could have been really terrible for all I know. Just don't go in expecting it to be amazing and you'll have fun with it.",1435536000,,402,4.445945945945946
8235035,2,B000Z8FCLO,"Disappointing Canadian B-movie starts out with a tremendous amount of promise--sometime in the future the police in a Canadian city have gone on strike and a group of right wing thugs decide to take advantage of the situation by walking into a gay bar brandishing baseball bats, threatening everyone inside.  After things go too far and the bartender is killed their leader turns up to shoot all of the bar patrons in the back of the head and eliminate any witnesses--except one escapes, running through the streets, eluding them in the halls of an empty building and finally finding refuge in an apartment inhabited by some young friends who are not looking for trouble.

As in Straw Dogs the thugs want the man who is being sheltered and since the people inside won't give him up those people are forced to defend themselves.  The most obvious influence here is actually John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13.  The opening scenes in Self Defense are filmed with a crisp clarity, with outdoors shots of nighttime city streets and alleys looking particularly handsome in cool, metallic blues.  A very 1980's synth score adds additional atmosphere and another link to John Carpenter.  In its early scenes it looks like Self Defense will be a smart, well-shot B movie with a clear premise that provides some good, unpretentious thrills.

Then the actual siege on the apartment house by the thugs begins and it quickly becomes obvious that directors Paul Donovan and Maura O'Connell have no idea how to stage action scenes which turn out to be so haphazardly staged it's frequently hard to tell what's going on or where the characters are in relation to each other.

This same script in the hands of more talented directors like John Carpenter, Walter Hill or fellow Canadian Robin Spry would have made for an excellent little B movie--unfortunately Paul Donovan and Maura O'Connell lack the skill to pull of what they are attempting.",1431475200,,1933,4.9079754601226995
