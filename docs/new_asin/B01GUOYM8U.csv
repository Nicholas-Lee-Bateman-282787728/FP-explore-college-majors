Privates tells about themselves to Technical Sergeant Jim Moore. In the morning recruits are roused from their beds. They show their training (or is it harassment?). One Private wants to go to sick bay because of a headache. Private Owens was there once this week. The Captain complains to Sgt. Moore about Private Owens. Training continues. Moore and a friend go to a night club. A woman sings about loving. Moore orders tomato juice and meets a woman. She leaves him, there is a conflict with another sergeant. The next morning the drill continues. Brushing away a sand flea can warn the enemy in combat. Moore orders a burial detail for a sand flea! One Marine went to college and is given extra drill. The Marines talk until Moore arrives. Marines don't laugh - they are the toughest soldiers in the world. Owens has a dirty rifle; they all have to run now.

Moore talks to another sergeant, who brings him a message from Ann. Moore explains why a clean rifle is important: if its not working its owner can die. The Marines disassemble their M-1s. One Marine thinks about going over the hill. Moore meets Ann at night, they talk about life and love. Moore learns Owens has bugged-out. He finds him and talks to him. In the morning Marines scrub the floor. The Captain orders Private Owens to appear before him. Owens had two brothers in the Marine Corps. Training continues. Mrs. Owens, the mother, comes for a visit; her husband was a Captain who was killed in the war. She wants her son to remain in the Corps. Owens will not get a General Discharge. Moore visits Ann in her store. Owens is reconciled, they go on a 20-mile march.

The Sands of Iwo Jima is still the best movie about the Marines in WW II. A good story makes a good movie. A year or so before this movie the news reported that a D. I. took recruits on a night march through a swamp and some drowned. There was an investigation. This movie may be meant as an explanation of training methods to the public. What kind of training in used in other services and countries? The limited scenery tells of a lower budget operation.",1488067200,,2116,4.490909090909091
