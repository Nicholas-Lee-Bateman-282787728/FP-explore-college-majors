7666465,1,B01BSW1O12,"Really not very well done. I had high hope for this, but it's a rather poor effort. There are a few interesting moments and memories, but overall the film is greatly lacking. Aside from David Prowse (who has truly been robbed as the true 'actor' of Darth Vader), the other people are generally very small and uninteresting extra characters. Having worked as a professional actor, I did my share of extra work at the start. I have nothing against it, and it is unquestionably necessary to round out a film However, it does NOT make for an interesting documentary - at least in this case.",1463788800,2,586,4.59047619047619
7666466,3,B01BSW1O12,"I thought this movie would be a heck of a lot more interesting than it was. The first 20 minutes was meant to introduce you, but the narration cuts between too many people to keep excited about. Also Boba Fett shows up only when they start talking about conventions for signatures and no place else, and I too like another reviewer would love to know what happened with Prowse that he can't go to sanctioned, ""copyright"" really, events.",1463702400,,436,4.602564102564102
7666467,5,B01BSW1O12,"This is an excellent documentary!  It's not about the stars of Star Wars.  It's about the people of Star Wars.  It brings a human element to the fantastic aliens, masked villains and background characters of the Star Wars universe.  I was always more of a fan of the aliens and villains of Star Wars so this documentary was right up my alley.  Don't expect a ""making of"" documentary but do expect an interesting peek into the lives of people who happened to have a role, some larger than others, in the biggest Space opera of all time.  I enjoyed it tremendously!",1462492800,7,563,4.524752475247524
7666468,3,B01BSW1O12,"Fell asleep in my puke while watching it.

Also, I hated the new Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015).  It was truly pathetic.  It reminded me of a stupid cartoon.  It had horrible acting, lousy CGI, a terrible ""retelling"" aspect that was entirely absurd and a revolting ""Supreme Leader"" called 'Snoker' that is a 30 foot cartoon that was preposterous.

I'm sick of Star Wars by now, well, I have been since 1978.  I don't dress up like a renaissance festival wiseacre, or even buy the DVD's since it'd be throwing away money.

I'm glad I'm the only guy against it all.",1461628800,5,582,4.485714285714286
7666469,5,B01BSW1O12,"Although there's plenty to keep Star Wars fans happy, the real strength in this film is that it is not in any way a fan-film or tribute to Star Wars.
Instead, it's a smart, sometimes melancholy study of how being associated with such a huge cultural behemoth has affected the lives of even the most seemingly insignificant participants. It's full of pathos, humour and philosophy. if you're expecting a straightforward 'behind the scenes', you might not understand what this film is actually doing. If you're a fan of smart, honest documentary, you'll absolutely love it.",1460678400,13,571,5.021052631578947
7666470,3,B01BSW1O12,"Basically this is an interview with mostly the extras and actors who had a few lines (although some of them iconic, such as These are not the droids were looking for), who turned up for a movie they thought might get shown on TV. A lot were wearing helmets or other costumes in the film so their faces were never seen. Although one guy realised this would happen so disobeys a direction and puts his visor up during the medal ceremony scene. The Stormtrooper who bumped his head, and just assumed he was out of shot since cut wasn't yelled and other key moments from extras/actors are in this documentary. David Prowse (Darth Vader) is probably the only main character in this, but it also has Bobba Fett from the sequels, played by a guy who was asked to audition who hadnt seen the first one.

You can probably skip the first 24 minutes as its pretty boring, at that stage other than seeing an action figure when the extra/actors voice talks in their first frame, you quickly forget who they were in the movie and are just seeing people you have no idea who they are (or care) talking about how they got into acting, where they went to school and so forth. Its only after 24 minutes that the documentary actually gets around to them auditioning (which in a lot of cases simply meant rocking up, after walking down a corridor after seeing a casting arrow as they walked past a door in Soho, London and followed it out of curiosity), for Star Wars.

The documentary does get more interesting after that, you don't learn a great deal but you see how the pilots destroying the Death star was filmed, ie they said every one of their lines in a row, all sitting in the same prop. The Comic Con type events was probably the most interesting. We see a jealous side to some of them who because they had their face shown in the movie, don't understand why more people want to get autographs from the actors who were R2d2, Boba Fett and Greedo who had what they call tin cans on their heads. A Canadian actor who needed to read his lines, doesnt like the fact that fans turn up to see extras at these events, and cant believe the nerve of a guy to turn up who claimed to be a pilot who was one of the extras in the classroom type scene. If they don't have lines or aren't listed in the credits they shouldnt be there is his and a few of the others opinion. We also hear from that guy who was the extra in the classroom.

The documentary is okay but is rather boring at times. It didn't have as much information as I had hoped and doesnt really follow up by prompting for more by the interviewer on things said by the interviewees. Such as the guy who played Darth Vader makes a remark about being banned from Disney World and some other place for Star Wars events and just says something like he must have done something to anger George. What? That is one the numerous questions that isn't asked.",1460246400,10,2887,4.33271719038817
7666471,5,B01BSW1O12,"I absolutely adore this film. It is SO MUCH MORE then another ""Star Wars"" related vehicle (Dont get me wrong... the behind the scene stories are incredibly cool) What I felt made it such a standout experience, was getting to know all the actors so personally, that by the time you were at casting and eventually filming, I actually had palatable excitement for them... as if I was actually there. So many relatable stories and the sites and smells... just wonderful. One of the best documentaries I have ever seen. One part sociology/personality study, two parts of various famous films these folks have aopeared in, and a topping of ""A Long Time Ago...In a Galaxy Far Far Away""... So glad it wasn't just a Star Wars trivia session... it really was so so much more. BRAVO!!!

7666474,3,B01BSW1O12,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Those are the famous lines spouted by actors for decades. They always want to thank the little people, those inconsequential actors, extras and crew members who make the star shine. But rarely do we ever hear about them and they never receive the accolades that the stars do. No one even makes movies about them. Until now.

STAR WARS is perhaps the biggest cultural event film made in the last 50 years. It was released, sequels were made, all were re-released, prequels followed, we got an all-new movie last year, a movie tie-in is coming as well as a sequel to the new movie. And while all had a handful of stars in major roles what most don't consider is the number of bit players and costumed actors that are found running around in each of these movies.

ELSTREE 1976 takes a look at those actors. If you were in a mask or played a small role in the original film you were there watching it all happen at Elstree Studios in 1976. The film makers here have gone back to those actors now and discussed with them the experiences they had in making that first movie. Matched with their appearances in that film we see them as they are now, masks off or a little aged for those who didn't have to wear masks. Each of them talks about their time and it makes for a nice backstage look at movie making.

Not only do we get to hear them talk about the making of the film we get to find out how it influenced their lives moving forward as well. Various cast members went on to roles in other films or TV projects, some of them recognizable when it is pointed out. For them youll be watching and saying Oh yeah! I didn't realize that was him/her! We see where they are today and what they're doing as well as those no longer with us.

Ive read some reviews of this film that take its makers to task for focusing on the minor bit players while ignoring some of the bigger name stars that were made who also wore masks. I find it difficult to side with those complaints seeing as how many of those stars have had programs made about them already as well as their appearing at numerous conventions to sign autographs to this day. The focus of the cast members here were those who aren't as recognizable, who didn't jump onto other major projects in starring roles, who haven't gotten the recognition that those others did. For me that makes the movie even better, giving them a chance for the recognition they deserve as well.

Understand going in that this is not an action packed film. We don't see tons of clips from the original movie. We get glimpses of these people in their roles, see them now and get the chance to listen to them talk about their experience. It is a documentary not a narrative film. And yet it is still interesting to watch. Fans of STAR WARS will find themselves listening to these tales with rapt attention. Others might find it interesting as well. For me it was a treat and worth watching.",1473811200,,2969,4.379310344827586
7666475,3,B01BSW1O12,"Unless you are a die-hard Star Wars fan, the title Elstree 1976 is likely to mean nothing to you, and even thenis a rather obscure reference. That said, Elstree is a cluster of British film studios that since 1914 have been home to the making of a number of films, including the original Star Wars. (Though the title itself is a bit of a misnomer, as Jeremy Bulloch didn't appear in the series until 1980's The Empire Strikes Back).
 Written and directed by John Spiro, this documentary was launchedthrough a Kickstarter campaign, and focuses on a few actors who either had bit parts in Star Wars, or appeared behind a mask. The most well known of the group are David Prowse, who physically played and voiced Darth Vader, though his dialog was later dubbed over by James Earl Jones. Jeremy Bulloch is Boba Fett, who pretty much chalks up his fame to the mythos of his character. We hear from Garrick Hagon, who had a larger role in the film until his characterBiggs Darklighter was cut down to almost nothing. Anthony Forrest's Fixer was completely cut. Paul Blake recounts his experience as Greedo, the bounty hunter Han Solo 'shot first'.
 While there are some interesting bits here and there, even as a fan I found myself rather confused and bored at times. The doc doesn't do that good of job telling who played what at first, using action figures instead of photos to show characters.
 While I suppose the point is to give these folks theirbit in the limelight, I didn't feel the need for all the back history, especially when one has a non speaking role with less than a minute of screen time. Pam Rose played a background cantina alien hardly seen in the film. Derek Lyon is the guy who passes the medals in the awards ceremony and is a guard in the same scene. Others have minor bits as pilots or stormtroopers.
 Oddly enough, this is part of what plays into the documentary, and what I found the most compelling, the confusion or bitterness most these folks project. David Prowse has somewhat been banned from 'official' Star Wars cons due to the way he signed autographs. Hagon and Forrest wonder what might have been. Some wonder why the sudden fame for a bit character with no lines not even in the credits, some wonder why the fame for an actor behind a mask never seen.
Fair enough for a view, but I just got a sort of'meh' feeling about the whole thing.",1473811200,4,2368,4.551643192488263

7666477,3,B01BSW1O12,"Yes, it was slow. The absolute best part of the film was around 1 hour 6 min when they showed fans displaying their autographed memorabilia because it brought a huge smile to my face. You can see it in their eyes, how happy they are.

What disappointment me was how some of the actors just don't get it. This is not about you, this is about the fans. Every single one of the actors thought this would going to be a B rated movie at best. Had they been asked to sell all of their rights for a few hundred bucks, they probably would have done it in a heart beat. Yet people like Angus MacInnes (Gold Leader), who coincidentally had to read his lines off his knees verbatim, is upset at people who were not credited signing autographs at the conventions. What a complete lack of respect to the fans.

As for the reviewers who say this film was a complete waste of time, no it isn't. If you are a true Star Wars fans you know that nothing about the films, books, cast, characters, actors, etc is a waste of time. Everything that gives us more insight and more information is worth our time and I think it's a little condescending to tell others not to watch it when they already have.",1468886400,,1180,4.263392857142857
7666478,2,B01BSW1O12,"As a lover of Star Wars and documentary films, I was excited to see this. Sadly, I was unable to finish it. It's got a very slow pace, covering the back story of people you've never heard of who aren't particularly interesting. I was expecting a film that followed some quirky characters as they milk their minor fame (like in ""Best Worst Movie""), but it was more about their history that led them to the roles, without giving much insight into the Star Wars films. I'm sorry to say I couldn't power through it, but it's snail's pace was putting me to sleep.",1468195200,,558,4.427184466019417

7666480,3,B01BSW1O12,"This was a good documentry, but it is about the actors (extras) that were in Star Wars. It was not about the time of life when these actors played in Star Wars. I was expecting and hoping for much more behind the scenes from a perspective not really seen before, alas this was dissapointing in this regard. Again, this is a great documentary, but sold as a very different thing then what it is.",1467072000,,394,4.337837837837838

7666482,4,B01BSW1O12,"""Elstree 1976"" offers an interesting hook: turn the spotlight on the mostly unknown actors who played the many little parts in ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" and gorge the insatiable beast of Star Wars cult fandom with yet more minutiae about their beloved film. So we go under the masks and the fur suits and the prosthetics to meet the guy who played Boba Fett, the lady who was a Cantina alien, Porkins, Biggs, etc. (including David Prowse, the soft-spoken hulk who wore the Darth Vader costume while James Earl Jones's sonorous voice gave the character its immortal life). Because all these incidental characters are so important to the fans, the actors have been able to eke out some extra income and a kind of twilight fame at conventions for decades. The movie doesn't really offer any surprises; I don't think it intended to. It tells stories of chance and good fortune that landed some journeyman actors and some lucky amateurs a place in modern mythology. There's a little bit of padding and hints of pathos (hangers-on and bit-part players who perhaps think they're actors when they've been glorified extras all along). The movie doesn't dwell on anyone's delusions, and it reveals that what many of us think of as an epochal movie didn't seem too far removed from community theater during its creation, a trifle with absurd costumes and a script few of the players understood. It attests to the gypsy-like aspect of filmmaking in which large bunches of actors and crew are thrown together to make something of which none of them have a sense of the thing in full. They shrug off their confusion and work diligently on their tiny, disconnected piece of the whole, hoping that it will either come together at some point or disappear forever and spare them professional embarrassment. This is, in some ways, a movie about people who took embarrassment as a necessary risk for the joy of making a movie. Even now, their joy radiates off the screen.",1466553600,5,1949,4.786350148367952

8751226,5,B01BSW1O12,"I was excited to learn that this documentary existed and couldn't wait to get my hands on it. What a cool perspective - hearing about the Star Wars phenomenon from the bit players and extras who happened to be a part of it. I read every single review on here before I watched it, so I knew going in it was going to be something different. Im also one of those people that has soaked up every behind the scenes film and book about the original trilogy since I was a kid. Ill start off by saying I disagree with nearly all of the negative reviews on here, even if I get where they're coming from - this is a great documentary, but you have to understand the nuance behind it.

By now, forty-plus years in, Star Wars is a legend in the film-making industry. Theres no denying the magic that went into its enduring success. But what I think has gotten lost in the mythos (and quite frankly, what is easy to forget) is that no one had any idea what the film was about or who George Lucas was, much less any expectation for success. This documentary is a great reminder of the absolute anonymity and inconsequential nature of Star Wars when it was being made. It adds an oft-forgotten layer to the legend - Star Wars came out of nowhere and put everyone on the map.

Hearing the backgrounds of the folks in the documentary further proves this point. It may seem a bit meandering and long (and yes, it does take almost a half hour before anyone even mentions Star Wars) but for me, it helped reinforce that most of those involved in the film came to it by chance and happenstance. They were simply ordinary people looking for work, and had little idea that Star Wars was destined to become anything at all. Its not even that they didn't see it coming - no one did. From this perspective, the impact on their lives has been extraordinary.

You won't get a massive amount of behind the scenes anecdotes - but really, thats ok for two reasons: 1) most were only on set for a couple of days tops, some even without lines or any on screen interaction with the lead actors. By nature, theres probably not a lot they could tell anyway. And 2) they were simply performing a job on a film so inconsequential at the time that it likely did not occur to them to soak in many of the details.

Its easy to condemn this documentary when you only consider Star Wars in terms of the legend. This is more of a hindsight view - a reminder of its humble beginnings, when it was nothing more than a goofy space story by an unknown director. For me, this documentary helps anchor the legend to something more human...less Hollywood Manufacturing and more Sheer Dumb Luck. Which is infinitely more interesting than the story of a sure thing.",1514678400,,2712,4.375

Personally I was hoping for a lot more background on the shoot itself and some on-set anecdotes; while some of that is sprinkled throughout the film here and there, it is buried in a great deal of padding which unfortunately wasn't all that interesting or relevant. With that being said, almost all of the actors come across as very nice people (with one glaring exception, who seems to be very elitist) and it's always good to see Dave Prowse, who seems a little less bitter here than he does in ""I Am Your Father."" It was also interesting to see how many of the actors are faring on the convention circuit, and how appearing in Star Wars has affected their lives: for some, it seems to have been a high point; for others, basically just another job. It's a shame that the pace is a little on the slow side, but all in all the film is worth a watch.",1491350400,,1021,4.4361702127659575

I defiantly had empathy for the stories told and could feel some of the regret of outcome and emotions that were over come. A big point made was 'perspective' looking back and appreciating BUT take risks and try not to be afraid. The doc was more about personal battles with a star wars theme; it wasn't the behind the scene making of the movie with the perspective of extras I wanted - and maybe that's my fault. I watched this because I wanted something other than the same people telling the same stories about how star wars was made and changed the world - not exactly what this is per say.

It turns out that this project is both as really well done documentary AND it has some great Star Wars stories about the production and the phenomenon it has become. So if you really like Star Wars, film making and documentaries, then this movie is for you.
The first half hour is slow because it is about the actors and the focus isn't on Star Wars until a half hour in.  It then goes on about the actors hearing about and staring in the Star Wars film. It later goes on tot talk about the many conventions and Star Wars fans that want the actor's autographs. It also gets into the politics of actors in film and how some Star Wars actors who were credited characters can be jealous of actors who were extras in the film, but still have fans flocking to them for autographs which was interesting.
This film really gave me so much more of bigger heart for stars Wars than I already had because you get to see the real people who acted out a few of our favorite characters and who had icon scenes even if they were just a stormtrooper.

These people are very charming and they are greatful for being able to play these iconic roles. Very humble, very likable actors who in some cases just happened to be hired for an unknown film called Star Wars. Luck, fate? Maybe both. I suggest to these other reviewers that you give it another chance and understand that it's about these wonderful people and their unlikely journey that led them to be part of the motion picture that affected the world. I love behind the scenes documentaries of Star Wars, all the production aspects, but this is about the human factor.

There is so much time spent on topics that have nothing to do with Star Wars, you spend the 1st 30 minutes wondering what the heck is going on, who are these people and did I mistakenly rent another documentary because they aren't talking about Star Wars right now and I'm 30 minutes in. When you do finally get on to the topic the introductions to the people being interviewed are so bad, these aren't stars of the movies being interviewed mind you, these are extras, minor support characters & body doubles you'd think it would be a good idea to do a proper introduction on lesser known cast members if those are the people you plan on interviewing because people aren't going to know who they are & you don't find out what role they had in the movie till much later in the interview, so stupid. I have no issue with lesser known cast members being interviewed but my issue is most of these people had little to no ambition in this line of work, why would you expect your audience to care when you don't care? because I found my self not caring about these individuals, you won't find any inspirational stories from them just a whole lot of lack luster and meh. If they inspire anything its to stay home and not do anything, forget having dreams and goals because all of that is meh. Don't be fooled into thinking its humility because it's not. What's more the Title of the Documentary Elstree is a studio in the U.K. that part of the Star Wars Episode 4 was filmed at but don't expect much about this studio because there's not a whole lot of information about it apart from the brief moment it was mentioned in the documentary as if it was a side note, you'd think there would be more since you named your documentary after it but nope, just a thought in the back of your ahead to be forgotten soon after its mentioned. This Documentary has no focus and is very good at being boring, if you want to see a great Star Wars Documentary done right check out The Prequels Strike Back: A Fans Journey. Regardless of your opinion on the prequels, this one also has people who are interviewed that most people wouldn't know about and they aren't even in the movie but it does one thing better, it has focus, it does not go off on irrelevant topics, it asks some questions and goes on to answer them. Elstree 1976 is pure garbage the people in charge have no idea what they're doing, they either use this criticism and improve or find another career and stay away from the Camera because doing things like this is not their forte.",1478304000,,2583,4.383333333333334
