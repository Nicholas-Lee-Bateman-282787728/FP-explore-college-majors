8614472,5,B00FD7TUWY,I bought this DVD because I've been having trouble getting back into any find of fitness routine and I thought it might be fun. I'm almost 70 so it's a challenge for me. Some days I just do the yoga section and some days I just do the ballet. I have never done ballet in my life and this DVD has inspired me to go looking for a local ballet class for adult beginners. I really love this DVD and look forward to the day that I can complete the whole routine in one session!,1502150400,,472,3.9789473684210526

Then, Beth's talent at film-making and editing combined with her grace and skill in yoga and dance has created a program that is so much more than a yoga and dance program. It is an adventure in the exploration of the balance and beauty of body, mind and spirit experience.  I look forward to tapping into the energy of such love and healing which I sense from beginning to end. Thank you Beth for sharing such a magnificent part of you.""",1382918400,,520,4.531914893617022

The background of the powerful Utah red rocks, and the soothing nature of the trickling water took me on a spiritual meditative journey. I love the fusion of ancient yoga, modern dance, ballet, sacred dance, and mindful mantras! This practice will bring flexibility, strength and balance to your entire being. I highly recommend this practice to everyone!""

""Absolutely stunning, this DVD is a gorgeous and delicious work of art for the body, mind and spirit!!! Melding Beth's extensive backgrounds in dance, yoga and spiritual wisdom to the backdrop of some of nature's most gorgeous backdrops is exquisite! Through her loving tone and generosity of heart and spirit, Beth elevates and escorts each participant into the rich atmosphere of the 5th dimension, where all things are possible.""

""As someone with a dance background who hasn't danced in many years, I was delighted to find Beth the Sybil's Yoga-Dance DVD both challenging and nurturing, and something I look forward to practicing repeatedly and regularly. Even deeper is the sense of empowerment her practices afford you as she expertly guides you from structured movement into your own personal, free expression. At the end of the free dance section, as I heard Beth's voice of wisdom giving life to the purpose and importance of our individual sacred dance, I wept with gratitude. As a filmmaker, I was keenly aware of Beth's choice to perform the same sequences in front of different backgrounds, which, when edited together the way she did, creates a subtle but powerful message about constancy amidst change. Yoga-Dance is a powerful invitation to remain steadfast and focused on your own unique expression, regardless of what external things are changing around you.""
