5190966,5,B008YKV2NW,All those rogue government types and cd's they were just starting to use computers its fancy stuff back then but Timothy Dalton was just right for the transition from Roger Moore as 007 to the following four other 007's  ( FOUR - whoa ).,1356220800,,237,4.386363636363637
5190967,2,B008YKV2NW,"License to Kill feels like what could have been.  Almost as if it was a dry run through.  First, it's filmed too tight and lit like a basketball game.  There's not much wide angle and half the time it looks like an episode of Scarecrow and Mrs. King on TV.  If you ignore that bad 80s cliche directing, poor lensing and lame dialog, there could be a really good Bond movie, but it's not all here. The story itself is pretty solid in a way. Junk the opening wedding and crappy gun battles and it's almost believable. Bond becomes a Ronin and chases revenge - that in itself is near genius they reused to lesser effect in the Daniel Craig movies.  The movie is hard edged in content but not in actual execution.  Better direction, more money, darker photography and we would be praising this as the ultimate modern Bond. Instead it feels as if we're watching Timothy Dalton fight tooth and nail while being forced to re-enact Romancing the Stone with a 9mm to his head.  Robert Davi phones in his typical 80s thorn job and Bencicio del Toro looks like he's not old enough to watch the movie let alone star in it, but Talisa Soto is welcome if underused.  Timothy Dalton very well could have been the first Daniel Craig.  He had the acting chops to sell reality and the presence to sell a laugh.  While George Lazenby threw away a good opportunity, Dalton was never given one.

Yep, what could have been.  They should have hired Lawrence Kasdan.

All that said, the Blu-Ray is mostly good looking.  Some scenes have a crisp clarity even though they are often over lit.  Later scenes play soft and a little smoothed over with noise reduction.  The sound is very crisp, however.  Good Blu-Ray, overall.

License to Kill is the Bond movie I fight hardest to enjoy.  It's just hard to ignore the unending disappointment.  While an ice palace may have killed Brosnan's Bond career in Die Another Day, it's the 80s that killed Timothy Dalton.  Shame.

Timothy Dalton is the best Bond ever. His performance in The Living Daylights and License to Kill were layered with subtext and had a visceral presence none have captured till the arrival of Daniel Craig. He's even got a palm recognition gun, something Craig only got in Skyfall. Dalton was twenty years ahead of the curve. Poor scripts, low production values and bad screenplays got the better of him. It would have been interesting to see what he would have done in a third film with a better script and budget. Audiences just weren't ready for him.",1353715200,,744,5.888888888888889
5190969,4,B008YKV2NW,"Licence to Kill is definitely one of the better Bond movies, I'd certainly rank it in the top ten. It also stands well on its own, as a fun but still dramatic action movie. It's absolutely worth seeing.

My full review is here: [...]",1353196800,,233,4.295454545454546
5190970,5,B008YKV2NW,"LICENCE TO KILL is an interesting and progressive follow-up to Timothy Dalton's version of a world weary James Bond in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS.

Dalton's Bond certainly possesses the drive that Connery gives Bond and adds more realism and conviction in his no-nonsense performance. Dalton posses the intensity and a certain presence that Connery often played with his tongue in cheek, but Dalton adds an enigmatic quality of the lonely world-weary blunt instrument to Bond. At times one can detect a melancholic aura tinged with disgust for his line of work. These were qualities that Dalton openly wanted to put into his performance. This film integrates the thinking man's hero and the man of action into Dalton's Bond.

James Bond resigns in this film, putting his current assignment aside, and sets out on a relentless crusade of revenge for the mutilation of his friend, Felix Leiter, and the death of Leiter's wife.  Why should Bond loose his objectivity and his professionalism over this incident? There is duty and there is loyalty and honor. Sometimes these virtues become in conflict.

Dalton's Bond has little time for levity or diversion from his personal mission at hand. Yet, he is the dedicated civil servant to some higher order in a world gone cynical and unsympathetic. Once Bond breaks into Milton Krest's warehouse in Key West and proceeds to get pulled in by M at the Hemmingway House, the film focuses on the vengeful Bond. We see Sharkey's body being towed to Krest's boat, another victim of Sanchez, and Bond in a restrained fit of controlled rage takes care of business immediately in one of the better scenes from the series. Eventually, Bond catches up with and confronts Sanchez face to face in many scenes that are full tension and suspense.  Ultimately, they have a very brutal no-holds-bared showdown.

LICENCE TO KILL contains good performances. One of the best is that of Benicio Del Toro's as Dario, a Sanchez henchman. Dario's screen presence is twisted and contorted bringing the notion that evil menace is the only reason for his existence in life. Don Stroud was very credible and somewhat likeable as Heller, the head of security and Sanchez's private army. Wayne Newton actually brought a nice touch of comic relief as Professor Joe Butcher, head of a meditation temple and front for Sanchez's laboratories. Anthony Zerbe brought his unique brand of histrionics to his role of the seemingly drunken smuggler Milton Krest. From a sentimental point of view, it was good to see David Hedison reprise his role as Felix Leiter and it was nice to see Desmond Llewelyn as Q in the field in a meatier role than usual. Robert Brown gave his most credible performance as M in this film. Brown never possessed the charisma that Bernard Lee brought to the role, but Brown as M brings a cold detachment in his scene with Bond even deploying sharpshooters in the event that the rogue agent may attempt to act irrationally when his ""Licence to Kill"" is revoked.

LICENCE TO KILL is one of the better Bonds.",1350345600,16,3028,4.89083820662768

5190981,3,B008YKV2NW,"This underrated, uniquely grounded Bond film features a strong, serious lead performance by Timothy Dalton crafting a more humanized Bond driven by guilt and vengeance.  A menacing performance from the lead villain also contributes to the gritty tone.  However, series staples such as glamour, glib lines and globetrotting are in short supply.  The lean budget, evident in lack of locations and poor lighting, leaves us with a film that at times looks more like a Miami Vice episode than a Bond blockbuster.

However, in Licence to Kill, Dalton has captured the Bond we can relate to - human and emotional but always under control - quick to think then act with finesse.

Another actor might have made this film work but casting was all wrong compared to the other actors who've portrayed James Bond, He's too serious and no fun at all.",1454112000,,499,4.154639175257732
5191091,1,B008YKV2NW,"Possibly the Worsth james Bond Film Ever. KORNEY is the word that comes to mind. It reminds me of some 1970's low budget crime comedy. The opening scene was TERRIBLE. Fake DEA agents, villian being caught from a helicopter while flying a plane. Parachute in to a wedding they nearly missed. All that was missing was a pie to the face and a rubber chicken and it would have been complete. They use the guy that is always a villian. He catches his girl in bed with SANCHEZ the gardener. Sanchez gets the knife off screen of course and he bends the girl over his knee with a whip and paddles her. I did turn the sound down and then bring up some old Benny Hill stock clown music. It fits the scene perfectly.

5191117,5,B008YKV2NW,"James Bond started out great with ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia with Love,"" but then started sliding downhill from Bond to Bling.  The series reached an all-time low with Roger Moore's inept portrayal of Bond as a comic victim, unable to do anything while events moved along to solve the problem despite having to bear him as a burden.

Then came Timothy Dalton and Bond was back.  He's still a larger-than-life action hero, but an almost believable one without the absurd toys and buffoonery that spoiled the series.  Events move along because James Bond makes them happen.  There's very little reliance on pure dumb luck.  the story has beautiful women, of course, but they are quite believable instead of the cartoon chicanery we see in other films in the series.  In short, License to Kill stands out among the best Bond films ever made.",1453593600,3,837,4.770833333333333

I know the production value looks similar to an episode of ""Dynasty"" or ""TJ Hooker"" but for some reason this movie has a great ""feel"" that captures the era.  Certainly a different feel than the cold war period that Connery was part of.  The 80's & 90's were starting to get that sharp and very smooth and polished production value.  The girls are gorgeous and really define the era very well with the slick and sassy hair style of Carey Lowell and the exotic sultry performance by Talisa Soto.

Of course by this point the Bond franchise is a comedy and romance series, with top notch aerial stunt sequences that are absolutely unrivaled in cinema.  The helicopter and airplane stunts are thrilling and really make these late era Bond films top notch.  Overall this is a great movie that captures the high class life of the year 1989.

5191177,3,B008YKV2NW,"I very much like Timothy Dalton as James Bond; he harkens back to a harder Bond, like Sean Connery's version, and The Living Daylights was a very good film.  License to Kill, however, feels like a '70's cop show.  The story seems contrived.  Case in point: Felix almost ditches his own wedding for a drug bust which didn't require his presence.  And in general, it seems low budget; for instance, the hundred dollar bills in Bond's suitcase are clearly not real, even on a small screen without HD.  Overall, the story isn't terrible, but I expect more from a Bond film.  I would have liked to have seen more Bond films made with Dalton, but I am pleased to see that Daniel Craig now brings the hardest skinned Bond of all.  I look forward to many new Bond films with him in the lead.",1365811200,4,783,4.395833333333333
5191178,3,B008YKV2NW,"The effects are just stupid. Almost every effect is ridiculous. He gets out of situations in ridiculous ways. The situations aren't realistic, the physics aren't realistic. They use every movie myth in the book. Three stars for action and hot women but wow. A truck doing a wheelie? There are many goofs too. It's like a B movie with a big effects budget.  When this era Bond came out it was so stupid I quit watching Bond for years.  Even in the mid to late 90s Bond got so much better.",1365638400,,487,4.34065934065934
5191179,4,B008YKV2NW,"I just thought this was a well done movie.  Tim Dalton had a short tenure, and his movies can be forgotten to the more recent and action-packed films starring Daniel Craig or Pierce Brosnan.  I think License to Kill was well worth the time and a Bond movie not to miss!",1365379200,,269,4.254901960784314
5191180,5,B008YKV2NW,"Love Blue Ray on HD TV.  Everything is sharper and tons more clearer.  I wasn't sure about having Timothy Dalton play James Bond, but he did an admirable job.  Each man that has portrayed Bond, brought his own person into the character.  But as I tell my husband they act as the director wants them to.

This movie reminds me of ""On her majesty's secret service.""  He lost his wife and grief settled in as he fought his enemies.  His friend Leiter gets married an looses his wife and almost his life thanks to Sanchez and his hooligans.  But he too fights back as Bond does and doesn't let anything get in his way.

Grittier than his other movies.  There wasn't anything funny about this movie.  Parts are horrific and others you just cheer on the good guys.",1359763200,,758,4.420289855072464

8532568,5,B008YKV2NW,This is one of my favorite Bond films.  I think Dalton is a great Bond and Lowell is a great Bond girl.  It's fun to see Q as a field operative.  Good story and good villains. Craig is not my idea of Bond...no sense of humor whatsoever.,1522281600,,236,3.978723404255319
8532569,3,B008YKV2NW,"All right James Bond entry. I like Dalton as Bond, Soto and Lowell are easy on the eyes, and Bond going on a vendetta are among the film's positive points. LTK is a violent James Bond movie, but that didn't bother me. James Bond against a drug dealer though isn't the norm and mostly doesn't excite. Mexico/Isthmus is one of the least exotic places for a Bond film, and Robert Davi is far from being the greatest villain of the series.",1512691200,,435,4.382716049382716
8532570,4,B008YKV2NW,"one of the best of the Bond films.  The talk of low gross at theaters because of ""blockbusters"" (list provided in the notes) demonstrates only the idiocy of those willing to pay theater pricing for such trivial moo bees.",1512086400,,220,4.641025641025641
8532571,5,B008YKV2NW,"This was a much more mature iteration of Bond than most films.  Normally Bond is essentially reactive.  He goes where his investigation takes him, but once there, he's primarily reacting to stimuli- using his wits and gadgets to get out of traps set for him.  In this film, he uses a set of subterfuges to create distrust and remove key players from the bad guys' organization.  This note of Kurosawa is applied lightly so that the Bond formula is maintained, but it elevates the character in welcome ways.

More than one reviewer has said that Bond going rogue is out of character.  I disagree.  While Bond always has a duty-first attitude, his maverick ways frequently lead him to act out of a personal judicial hierarchy.  Most notably, in The Spy Who Loved Me, Bond tells the submarine captain to delay destroying the villain's sea base so that he can save the Bond girl.

Speaking of Bond girls, several reviewers have commented on them as detracting from this movie.  Carey Lowell's character has a few moments in which I can see how some might say she comes off as whiny.  In general though, over the course of the movie she is an empowered female partner in a way that few Bond girls prior to her were.  This provides more subtle breaks from the Bond formula.

There is only one moment that detracts from the film, and that's the pressure tank scene when one villain kills another.  The way the explosive decompression in the scene is done is cartoonish.  I'll chalk that one up to limitations of the time period, the rest of the movie has the same classic and clean feel that we expect from the franchise.

Licence to Kill is on my short list of arguably best Bond films, and I find it very disappointing that we didn't get to see more from Dalton.  In terms of the larger franchise, Dalton pulled it back down to earth after the Moore era spent so long on the border with science fiction.  The franchise took an uncharacteristically long hiatus before going into the Brosnan era, which started with similar grounding before spinning back out of control in the late 90s.  The beloved Craig era, to me, is presenting where the Dalton Bond could have gone with a few more films.",1512086400,4,2185,4.585051546391752
8532572,5,B008YKV2NW,This is one of the Bond movies I grew up with. I enjoyed it then but now I think I can appreciate it. I like grittiness of the film as opposed to the more suave movies of Moore and Connery. I feel it fits along with the newer films under Craig.,1512000000,,244,3.803921568627451

8532574,2,B008YKV2NW,"This 1989 Bond film is forgotten by many, and for good reason. It was the last of two featuring Timothy Dalton and I believe it's still the lowest grossing Bond film to date. Considering it's tone and that it was released  during the summer up against a few big blockbusters, it's not hard to see why. The plot is absurd for starters, and the acting isn't all that good. Dalton is fine, he didn't have much to work with. The script is bad. After the ludicrous opening, his friends are harmed. The just married wife is murdered and his friend is greatly injured. You have to wonder why they didn't kill the guy. It's obvious the gangsters are no strangers to killing and yet they just have the guy get his leg bittin off and then they just leave him? So that he can survive and live to tell everyone about it? Makes no sense. So right off the bat this whole revenge mission that Bond goes on feels trivial because we feel no attachment to the recently married couple. It's just a ridiculous thrown together chain of events. Bond going off the radar and against his code doesn't make sense for the character and doesn't seem like something he would do.

The movie also contains some of the most lackluster bond girls in the franchise, with mediocre acting on top of it. As for the villains, they're largely forgettable. Sanchez seems interesting at first, but he never developed.

Another major thing is how dated the movie looks. I imagine it was much lower budget than other big movies of the time, but it looks like a made for TV movie. The sets and locations just feel small, claustrophobic, and unconvincing. All in all it's one of those movies where you constantly ask yourself just what exactly is going on because almost nothing that the characters do makes sense.",1511308800,,1770,4.5423197492163006
8532575,3,B008YKV2NW,"License To Kill is not one of my favorite 007 films.  Everything about this film feels like a made for TV movie that feels more like a Magnum P.I. episode than a big budget action film.  The film was released in 1989 and when compared to Lethal Weapon 2, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Batman, License To Kill was a major let down in thrills and action.

I can't say I dislike any 007 films, but License To Kill is among the 3 worst Bond films I've ever seen.",1505952000,,464,4.133333333333334
