7343682,5,B0128GGLWO,"My heart goes to all these children!!! How terrible to grow up thinking/knowing/feeling they were not wanted or desired by their parents for what ever reason. Hurras to all the families that have had the means, possibilities and specially the wanting to adopt and give these children a new life!!!!",1447632000,,298,4.98
7343683,4,B0128GGLWO,"Find Me is the tale of children who are abandoned by their parent, presumably due to financial difficulties. The children are ""found"" on street corners. They call that their ""found place"". One little girl is so sad that her face has a perennially fixed display. She symbolizes the trauma these children go through. My only problem is that the homes these children are adopted into are clearly wealthy and Very Christian, and speak as though the families have a direct line to their god. It's off-putting. I don't believe that just because they are vocal Christians it makes them good parents",1481932800,,591,4.861386138613861
7343684,5,B0128GGLWO,"Very powerful documentary. I was incredibly moved by this film and although it was ultimately uplifting, my heart was broken through much of the story. Keep up the good work with this type of documentary as it is very much needed.",1479081600,,230,4.634146341463414

7343686,2,B0128GGLWO,"The little girl couldn't be more precious. Unfortunately I thought the adoptive mom (both this one and those who follow) need to practice holding their emotions a little better. It really makes me wonder how much was overly displayed drama for the documentary?
How is that little girl going to be strong (which should no way be expected, she is the child) if she sees the new adults in her life blubbering all over the place? I am in the process of adopting older children, but I think many of these documentaries not only show you what happens, what to do, as well as what NOT to do!",1478304000,,584,4.416666666666667

7343689,5,B0128GGLWO,"I am mom to ten, six of whom are special needs children from China. My tenth child actually told me about this documentary.

7343690,1,B0128GGLWO,"I was so disappointed in this film. The stories of the adoptive families are well done, but the summary says the film also tells the story of the children's Chinese nannies and foster parents who took care of them before adoption. But it doesn't.

What the film does instead is show the American families talking about how they think or imagine the Chinese foster families might feel. Even when the foster parents are in the room and talking to the camera, the filmmakers don't bother to translate for us! In fact, the subtitles only say [speaking Chinese]. It's appalling, disrespectful, and frankly, racist. I would never have watched it had I known. I don't want to know what people who look like me think about the lives of people in China; I can get that by talking to strangers on the street. I want to know what the Chinese families themselves think.

One of the biggest problems with international adoptions is that we as westerners tend only to see our own side - we don't pay much attention to it's effects on the other countries. This film had an opportunity to change that, but it failed completely.",1476057600,4,1111,4.634517766497462

This film profiles several families and their adoption stories, as well as interviews with the former care givers and foster parents of who cared for their children while they were living in orphanages in China. Through the making of this film an organization called ""Find Me"" was born, which facilitates potential adoptions through the making of videos featuring children in need of homes, often profiling harder to place children, such as those with special needs, or older children who are getting ready to age out of the system.",1463270400,3,553,5.021739130434782

For those of us who thought that abandoned Chinese children are warehoused in overcrowded orphanages, it also provides a look at Chinese foster mothers and the loss they experience when their foster children are adopted by foreigners.  Viewers see that not all of the Chinese children adopted by Americans are girls who were abandoned because of China's one-child policy; some children have clearly been abandoned because their birth parents either could not get them the medical treatments they needed or did not want a disabled child.",1458000000,2,627,5.3232323232323235

7343725,2,B0128GGLWO,I was happy to find a documentary that interested me available on prime.  Unfortunately the piece seemed primarily focused on the adoption process as it relates to christian families.  I found the overt religiosity a bit tiresome for me as I don't share those views.  If you do..you will enjoy  it more I think.  Although it had some pacing problems .. it was fairly well done.  I didn't quite finish it thoough...it started to feel more like a sermon than a documentary.,1455667200,10,471,4.682926829268292

7343738,5,B0128GGLWO,"I loved every minute of this documentary (except for the beginning about farming... I was worried I had chosen the wrong film). This follows the journey of several families as they adopted children with special needs from China. This well-rounded movie not only looks at the experience from the adoptive family's perspective, but from the child's, nannies' and orphanage director's in China. I will definitely watch this again.",1453593600,,427,5.294117647058823

We are headed to China in a few weeks time to finalize our adoptions of two children with special needs, and this was so good to watch to prepare ourselves for what lies ahead.

7343743,5,B0128GGLWO,"Moving documentary.  I had heard it was good, but it was so much more than I expected.  It gives you a look at several families stories as they adopt from China (before, during, and after), as well as how an international advocacy organization was 'born' out of the making of the documentary.  As someone who would love to see every single child in this world have a family, it was heartwarming to watch stories about others who share the same passion.  Also, it gave a unique look into the foster system/orphanage system in China.  I will absolutely be watching it again (and probably again, and again, and again)... with my husband, with my extended family, with friends, with anyone who will watch it with me... before we bring home our own sweet son from China.",1452816000,2,765,4.637037037037037

7343745,5,B0128GGLWO,I'm amazed at these wonderful families who so freely open their arms and hearts to these children a world away.  I've been waiting to see this film since it was in production and am grateful that Prime offered it!,1451865600,2,213,4.461538461538462
7343746,5,B0128GGLWO,"I absolutely loved it. It was amazing to see and hear all those beautiful stories of how God brought families together. How He toughed hearts and lives and inspired them all to deeper faith and hope, was powerful. Seeing how the Ayi's so truly loved and cared for the children is priceless. To realize many parents didn't want to give up their child yet felt there was no choice in order for them to have life, was truly remarkable and a powerful testimony to these chinese families who leave their children out of love and concern  and give them the opportunity to live life was wonderfully captured through this documentary.

7343751,5,B0128GGLWO,"The DVD was awesome and heartwarming! It showed the many facets of the Chinese adoption process, including the process of coming full circle when the nannies said goodbye to their babies/children being adopted. It was a timely documentary for a friend's family members, who are at the final stages of adopting a Chinese 3-year old girl.

8725585,1,B0128GGLWO,"This film is disgusting. It's informative only to the extent that it exemplifies the dominant Western mentality of white saviorism surrounding intercountry adoption (ICA), whereby white people acquire children who were born to other people. The people in this film treat the visitation of childrens' so-called ""finding places"" (an insultingly trivializing term) as a scavenger hunt. The film features a homemade pop video of a family singing gleefully about how they're going to acquire more humans to ""add to their family tree,"" with no acknowledgement of the original families who are being torn apart in order to accommodate the expansion of their mini-empire. ICA is a white-centric, imperialistic, neo-colonialist system of oppression against economically and socially disadvantaged people in other countries. It's a known fact that AT LEAST 80%-90% of the children processed through ICA have at least one living parent who would choose to take care of them if they had the resources. Furthermore, many children have been stolen from their original families. Many were never relinquished by their parents at all, or were obtained from parents who were lied to and coerced into signing papers that they didn't understand, sometimes while still groggy from anesthesia after giving birth. Almost all adoption ""records"" have been falsified by the adoption agencies--which are private, for-profit companies operating in the absence of any international oversight. If a parent or couple in the U.S. or another Western country were to become down on their luck financially, or had a child whose medical condition required costly treatment, would it be a solution for that family to have their kids taken from them, to have for-profit companies change the childrens' names and falsify their identities, and then sell them for tens of thousands of dollars each to people in other countries, where their names will be changed yet again, and where they will forget or never get the chance to learn their native language, culture, family background, medical history, etc.? Many adopters prefer ICA because the system (due to its fraudulence and opacity) is highly effective in preventing the childrens' original families from ever locating them and vice versa. Tragically, even when those adopted are able to be reunited with their original families, the feasibility of forging and maintaining meaningful relationships is almost insurmountably difficult due to the cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers involved. Why is this system seen as acceptable, even laudable, by mainstream standards in Western, predominantly white societies? And why is it that adopters receive significant tax breaks for adopting--and some even hold fundraisers to help them pay the exorbitant adoption fees, as shown in this film--when biological parents are given little or no support to keep their own children? And does anyone wonder where all the money paid toward ""adoption fees"" is going to? None of it goes to the families who are losing their children, or to strengthening social welfare infrastructure in their communities so that these tragedies could be prevented. It goes into the pockets of the salespeople at the adoption agencies, the brokers of human lives.

None of this is acceptable. In fact, more and more countries have been shutting down their international adoption programs because of the rampant fraud, corruption, and myriad abuses found at every level. The ICA industry is a multi-billion dollar business with ultra-slick marketing that tells people it's a charitable, Christian thing to buy humans and reinforce systemic oppression of disadvantaged people in other, predominantly non-white countries. To celebrate and participate in ICA is to maintain the demand for other people's children, and to continue funding legalized child trafficking. If a person wants to learn more about the truths of ICA, it isn't very difficult if they know how to use the internet. Amazon doesn't allow reviewers to include links to other sites in their reviews, otherwise I would easily include a number of links to get people started.",1524096000,,4123,5.382352941176471

I loved watching the families interact with their newest family members and having the opportunity to hear an adoption director and various foster parents share their stories.  This film may spur other people to reach out and adopt children.  Seven years ago, I adopted my daughter, who was just ten days away from ""aging out"" of the adoption system.  We celebrated her fourteenth birthday immediately when we returned to the United States.  Her experience was different from the experiences featured in this movie.  She had been badly abused in a foster home and bore physical and emotional scars from years of abuse.  That's very different from what is pictured here in this movie but also a part of adoption.  I'm happy to say that with time and lots of love and patience, my daughter's terror, anxiety and ""fight to survive"" attitude slowly faded away, and underneath her survival techniques I found a beautiful, generous, sparkling spirit.  Even those children who haven't been blessed with loving foster homes can survive and thrive.  My daughter and I would add something different to a movie like ""Find Me,"" but our ending would be a happy one as well.",1511481600,,1249,4.9330143540669855
