8079438,2,B000ASAU1Q,I loved the other three fit at 40's but this one had poor video quality which made me not want to mess with it.,1360713600,,111,3.6666666666666665
8079439,4,B000ASAU1Q,"If you're looking for laughs, there's no doubt that these videos provide them.  The women are absurdly busty, perfectly manicured etc etc and I'm sure that it didn't come from doing exercises.

However, I decided to get past that, because the exercises really are useful to someone like me.  I'm a little over 40, I've had tendonitis problems here and there, and when I wanted to strengthen my body and lost some stomach fat without going to a gym or doing some aggressive workout I couldn't handle.  I first rented Jillian Michaels and found it impossible for me.  She seemed to assume that you knew all about working out, which weights to use etc and prided herself on being aggressive about it.

Well, that's not for me.  I need realistic exercises for a beginner who, apart from some physio, doesn't know a thing about it and just isn't strong at all.  This video gives me that.  The exercises are doable.  It's even nice to hear 'if you need to, you can support your bottom with your hand' and realize that people less fit or strong than me are doing this too.

I also love the southern-lady way of talking (I'm British) that the instructor has.  It's charming! It really is.

a word about the videos.  A little confusing.  I didn't do this one but the 'beginner/intermediate' workout' as opposed to 'b/i pilates' -  one I rented thru Netflix where one person is in blue and one in white.  Then I bought the beginner workout by mistake.  No harm in having that.  Now I'm buying that one I'd rented.  This one I'm 'reviewing' here I admit I haven't tried, but it is no doubt a similar kind of thing.",1334534400,,1603,4.5
8079440,3,B000ASAU1Q,"This work out was pretty good, but I couldn't stop laughing at these two women with their fake boobs, fake hair and lipo. I mean, come on now, if you are going to sell a product, at least make it look like you USED the product to get those bodies, girls!
LOL!!!",1276646400,2,261,4.038461538461538
8079441,2,B000ASAU1Q,"Ive been wanting to do Pilates more, but not with these two broads! On the DVD I have, you get to go to Blondies Malibu mansion to exercise, get to see how the other half lives, and good grief, what a joke that is! But I couldn't get past the boob jobs on these women, who did they make this tape for anyway? And the camera angle is over head just in case you missed all that cleveage. My my, don't they stand up straight tho! This would be a great tape for men tho, and I highly recomend it to them, but for us ladies, it was a sad statement about what we are all supposed to have and look like. And they didn't really do Pilates in the first one I watched, just regular old areobics. I hope I can sell my 4 DVDs, what a joke this is.",1233100800,4,735,3.8741721854304636
8079442,5,B000ASAU1Q,"I thought I would have a better workout with this dvd but it is a very easy workout, I do recommend it to those who are new to pilates.",1231977600,3,135,3.689655172413793
8079443,5,B000ASAU1Q,"This is one of the few pilates videos where I feel like I get a good workout!  I have mastered the beginner exercises but am not ready for advanced and this video is perfect for that.

I have been doing the video 3/4 times a week for a couple weeks and can see some results!  I would highly reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a good pilates workout!",1147478400,5,358,4.085714285714285
