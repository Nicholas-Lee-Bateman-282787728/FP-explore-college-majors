2401427,4,B000B5XPRO,"I think Carolena Nericcio is very good at showing how to do several bellydance moves. If you like the tribal style this is a helpful video for a beginner. The quality of this dvd is excellant. I already own ""The Art of Bellydance"" by Carolena Nericcio so I was disappointed to find out that this is the exact same video. Only three differences: The Art of Bellydance has more instruction(kind of shows you how to play finger symbols),THE PRICE, ""The Art of Bellydance"" costs less than 20.00,and you also get a music cd, finger symbols, instructional dvd, and a belly jewel. I am not sure what year she made ""The Art of Bellydance"" but I bought mine about 3 months ago so it is still sold.",1176422400,22,688,4.468253968253968

8081992,4,B000B5XPRO,"This is the DVD that inspired many. I saw it when it first came out over 20 years ago when I was with a small midwest troupe. It changed everything. FCBD started and popularized what is now known as American Tribal Style belly dance. This DVD is the bare bones, the easiest basics. This being said, the DVD ironically isn't that great as an instructional video. If you aren't new to belly dancing you'll find it rather boring and slow. If you ARE new, you may find it confusing as the steps aren't broken down as well as they are in other instructional DVDs, and yes, even ATS ones. If you are serious about learning American Tribal Style (or even ITS) though, you must at least watch this once for history sake. Unless you are a serious collector, I'd suggest just ""renting"" it direct from the FCBD site rather than buying a hard copy.",1402876800,3,836,4.435064935064935
8081993,1,B000B5XPRO,"Not real happy. My original copy of this was lost in a move, so I re-purchased this thinking it was the same.  It's not the original I use to have.

It is the exact same material on the ""The Art of Belly Dance: A Fun and Fabulous Way to Get Fit"" DVD/cd set that I already have from Barnes & Noble, just with this cover.

The way it is set up, it's not strong enough instruction for the beginner. What is taught is not broken down very well, you are expected pick it up as you follow along. Feels more like an introduction to the tribal format than an instructional. This was the original problem with the ""Art of Bellydance"" for me.  I had a hard time trying to learn with it. But it led me to taking live classes.

For the material is has, it should be listed at a lower price.

There is a small mention this was revised but this is a completely different from the old Fundamentals Vol. 1.

I now have two copies of The Art of Belly Dance. Had I known, I would have never bought it.
The material is not worthy of purchasing it twice.

8081994,4,B000B5XPRO,This was the most expensive DVD I've ever purchased.  Purchased to help me remember dance steps between weekly dance class.  The instruction is helpful and holds my attention.,1366156800,,175,5.214285714285714
8081995,4,B000B5XPRO,"I first purchased the dvd after dancing for only a few months, and I thought it was ok.  After dancing for several more months, I came back to it and totally love it.  It really showcases the beauty, simplicity and elegance of ATS.  I love that she takes a very small number of moves and creates lovely combinations with them.  It is a great way to hone your basics.",1329004800,6,366,4.260869565217392

8081997,5,B000B5XPRO,"I started 2 weeks ago, and I think it's a good basic belly dance instructional DVD.  It also shows how to use the cymbols/zills with a 38 minute dance routine at the end to watch or try to dance along with.  Costumes are gypsy style with turbans and 25 yard gypsy skirts.

You will have be slightly athletic to do leveling.  Learn balance because you will be on your toes and doing a 180 degree turn while remaining on your toes afterwards.  This was harder than I thought, but worth it.  It certainly does make you give more respect to even the most basic choreography of belly dance.  It's not nearly as easy as it looks.",1287878400,4,623,4.318965517241379
8081998,3,B000B5XPRO,"It gives you the formatt, but with no clear instruction on how to put it together. I do not think you could get much out of it without lessons from a qaulified teacher. If you took lessons it would be a great home practice.",1281052800,2,223,4.090909090909091
