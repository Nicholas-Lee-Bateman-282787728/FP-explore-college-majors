3611528,4,B001GJ7ZHU,"An exploration of Bigfoot in ""Panther Rock"" and Anderson County Kentucky. Learn the history and origins of Bigfoot and hear countless stories and eyewitness accounts about Bigfoot. This film definitely made a believer out of me.",1233619200,,228,5.361111111111111
3611529,1,B001GJ7ZHU,"This ""documentary"" was so bad I have now changed my mind about how poorly I think the ""Rocky Mountain Bigfoot"" DVD was, which was very amateurish.

If ""negative"" stars were available, I would have rated ""The Wildman of Kentucky"" accordingly.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!

If you're used to History Channel-produced documentaries like MonsterQuest, forget about it.  This documentary was not professionally-written.  Very biased.  It had the feel of a home movie.  And it's way too long at two hours.  They could have summed this up in five minutes.

It starts off with this absolutely annoying rock music, which already told me I was in for a less than scientific approach to the Bigfoot subject.  But the rock music just kept coming back.  It was played over the people speaking making it difficult to hear what was being said.  Then I realized what was being said wasn't that important anyway.

Then there's the histerical use of computer game-style graphics!  The producers couldn't afford to conduct re-enactments so about one-quarter of the documentary is comprised of these rediculous graphics that make me feel as though I need to pick up my Xbox 360 controller and start shooting at the Bigfoot.

95% of the info presented has not only been rehashed countless times in other bigfoot books and documentaries, but the info was presented in such a sweeping manner that it had little impact or purpose in the overall documentary.  The first 15 to 20 minutes has nothing to do with Kentucky.

Another warning:  If you don't like your Bigfoot stories mixed in with other paranormal weirdness, be forewarned.  I don't necessarily mind the few mentionings of black panthers, but it started to get too rediculous for me when the ""glowing orbs"" were being seen but somehow ""couldn't be shown on camera.""

And of course you have some hillbillies running around in the woods at night hyping it up as they keep repeating ""there's something out there...I can hear it...do you hear that?""

There ought to be a law against selling junk like this.",1230681600,23,2029,4.908823529411765
3611530,3,B001GJ7ZHU,"The Loud Rock/Gothic Music is Distracting and Annoying.
 The storys of the sightings are great and the Filming thats done in the woods at night is a joke.
 Filming the faces of four guys pointing at something in the woods and you only see the four guys pointing as they say, Hear that ? and you only hear the annoying music that plays in the back ground.
The talking is interesting, but these guys do not know how to research bigfoot as they just talk and show nothing.",1230681600,,469,4.318181818181818

It was actually even pretty scarey. Set mostly in mysterious places in Kentucky, the whole feeling this show sets up and gives you is cool.

3611535,3,B001GJ7ZHU,"I have seen several Bigfoot movies here and I will admit that the narration needed to be a lot better.; The music as far as I am concern was not very well planned out. Why I say this is that the music they called ""Bluegrass"" during the Daniel Boone part of this movie was NOT ""Bluegrass"", it was ""Cajun"" type of music. I love both of these types of music and I know the difference between the two. The cameraman instead of focusing on the people in the night scenes should have filmed more at what they were looking at. Also the crew needs to have some better equipment like updated night vision and maybe they should  get and learn how to use FLIR cameras. Maybe they would be able to find better evidence.",1482883200,,707,4.276119402985074

3611552,3,B001GJ7ZHU,"Clearly not made with the big budget of a show like ""Monster Quest"", but ""The Wildman of Kentucky"" portion of the show still presents an intriguing amount of knowledge, eyewitness accounts, and several pieces of potential evidence to viewers interested in the mystery of Bigfoot. However, the trail of the elusive creature goes somewhat cold for viewers during the often done ""nighttime investigation"" portion of the show, with the team walking through the woods and whispering about hearing and seeing unusual things that may indicate the presence of a sasquatch, but that are almost never picked up by their cameraman for the audience to reach even that conclusion.",1444867200,,667,5.185185185185185

The entire thing is a joke - This feels like a man-child took his hobby of computer games and made a movie and then just dubbed over it as he narrates the whole thing with rock music as his backdrop. This doesn't even present anything  profound or new to the topic it just regurgitates already standardized information on the subject matter - Save your time and do something else....",1443225600,,567,4.495145631067961
3611554,4,B001GJ7ZHU,"As an artist, I have to give this documentary it's rewards. As a documentary fanatic, I must give this documentary it's critique.

Yes, as many others have pointed out, the documentary is low budget. While low budgets are a detractor for some documentary fanatics, for other documentary fanatics and artists, a low budget can add a nuance big money can't capture.

This is a well written documentary that enlightens the first time Bigfoot seeker as well as the experienced Bigfoot enthusiast.

I personally enjoyed the cost efficient animation (think screen saver for your computer) that played while the narrator weaved information which had no actual footage. It wasn't the same animation on loop that was shown. In comparison to a Monster Quest animation which has one to three animations it replays over and over their 40 minute reel.

The segue from other creatures lurking within Kentucky is natural as it's brought to light by one eye witness and corroborated by other testimonies.

Artistically I give this a 4 star review, because I can see the vision the director has for this project. This is not a college level documentary, it's a documentary put together with vision exceeding a person seeking a good grades.

As a documentary, I give this effort 4 stars, because it enlightens those who have never watched a Bigfoot documentary before and it offers a fresh perspective on stories not heard by seasoned bigfoot enthusiasts like myself.

If you've got snacks and a clear calender of time. Press play on this video and let your imagination fill in the gaps. It'll be a wonderful ride!",1442620800,,1596,4.932835820895522

3611557,1,B001GJ7ZHU,"This ""mocumentary"" was worth the money I paid for it....zero on Amazon Prime Instant Video!!!  As repeated in the first review, the opening score was horrendous, I guess to give the viewer a taste of the testosterone & danger that might await them...NOT..it reminded me of Skinhead rock.  After the story transitioned to it's video game, Second Life graphics, the music transitioned to what I guess was Kentucky Bluegrass.  When finally the viewer is treated to a live witness account, the 1st ""star"" of the show starts talking like a tour guide & damn if the music isn't very Travel Channel'ish!  Since 27 minutes was all I could bear, I'll also point out more time was spent on the discussion of the Kentucky Wildman, (tall, black, wolf face) & large black upright cats (film provided of big black cat creature walking on a paved road on all fours) than about Bigfoot.

These best I got out of these 27 minutes, as I've titled, were that CORPSES were LOCATED IN KENTUCKY: 1811 Mammoth Cave, 1 adult approx 8' w/younger adolescent, 1876 New York Times ran an article  of the discovery of 3 8' remains.  In 1965, Kenneth White was building cattle stalls when he found a perfectly preserved corpse under a ledge, approx 8'9"", arms extremely long, hands very large, skull 30"" circumference, eye & nose sockets had slits rather than cavities, the area where the jawbone hinges to attach to the skull was solid bone",1427760000,,1411,4.73469387755102

3611568,3,B001GJ7ZHU,My biggest problem with this documentary is the dramatization and music. There are times when someone is whispering and you are trying to hear and the music is just overpowering.

After almost 20 minutes of aimless unprofessional narration, over cheesy low end video game computer graphics, I gave up and started jumping ahead to see if anything changed. There were the typical green scenes in the woods with all the usual tricks ( knocking etc) and I could take no more. Aside from the horrific narration, the worst thing about this thing was the sad fact that the CG Creature bore little or no resemblance to the description of the narrator, or most witnesses. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but it IS ridiculous.

I don't condemn people right away for telling what they saw, but after a couple of times without something to back it up, I start to give some doubt.

This film did little to alter my opinion as there wasn't any legitimate scientific evidence presented. It was however highly entertaining in the way that these folk stories are intended to be. I can't say whether or not these types of creatures actually exist although I think with all of our modern technology we would likely have some visual proof but the film did bring up some interesting and though-provoking points about their existence. All in all though, the film was more entertaining than educational - especially the ""Blair Witch"" scenes. Watch it with an open mind and you will enjoy it.",1294272000,2,733,4.872
3611583,3,B001GJ7ZHU,"The chance of there being a giant relative of Man but not Man lumbering around the woods of Kentucky is as intriguing as you get as far as I'm concerned.

Through recreations, animations, music and narration, this documentary successfully promotes Bigfoot.  The sheer number and detail of sightings around the world, and the different names by which the ""Wildman"" is known is the best evidence, but there are still no real photographic or skeletal examples, at least in our time, though this film points out other species of large ape-like creatures once existed on Earth.

The eyewitness accounts of encounters are the best thing about this film, and it's not just Bigfoot--there are accounts of a large panther-like animal too.

More amusing than enlightening is a segment reminiscent of The Blair Witch Project, suitably creepy, with a bunch of guys stumbling around in the woods, lit by flashlight, whispering, listening, convincing themselves there's something out there.  The viewer isn't so sure.

Also interesting is a connection to Daniel Boone, who is supposed to have killed a ""ten-foot, hairy creature.""

I'd love for there to be more here, but in the end, it's still a tease, with no real evidence.  Still, taken with a grain of salt, this DVD is entertaining for us hopeful believers.",1274745600,,1298,5.0327102803738315

Oh, I have no doubt that something must surely exist.  After all, more of our solar system has been explored then Earth's oceans have.  Surely, there are many areas of land that haven't been explored as well.  These wild places are excellent hiding grounds for Bigfoot-like beings.

In The Wildman of Kentucky, there are rumors and folklore galore of a Sasquatch type creature prowling around Panther Rock.  In this DVD we get to go along with a group of explorers on a journey to, hopefully, discover the truth. The tales were intriguing and some pretty interesting events took place.

The one star I gave this documentary goes to the witnesses they seemed crediable and honest about what they experienced.

It approaches the topic from all different angles. For example, it suggest that Bigfoot may be linked to the paranormal and exist in another dimension as well as our own.  I hope that the team or researchers continues to do more investigations at this spot since it seems to be full of activity.  I would love to give more examples, but I fear that I may spoil the film for future viewers.  I will close by saying that the viewer will not be disappointed.  I actually ordered the book from Amazon and watched it again.
There were some controversy over why the camera picked up images that their eyes did not.  While I am no expert on the matter, I do know that camera are not perfect representations of our eyes.  Cameras, depending on the their quality, have the ability to pick up images from other parts of the visual spectrum.  Our eyes actually see images using a very small band from this spectrum.  I think you will see this fact supported as more shows dealing with the paranormal are shown.

Poorly done graphics... looks like a student from a high school or college animation program put this together, which is a great way to grow, but a compelling doc it does not make.  Music is absolutely horrible. Also there's 5 minute production tag at the beginning which is pointless.  The whole first section of the film feels like one of those tedious filmstrips we used to watch in elementary school full of info we've all heard before (give me something new).  Realize who your audience is... it's going to be people interesting in cryptozoology, so you don't have to tell us the history.  It's a shame because there is probably a good story buried in there somewhere.  When I listened to the book author on Coast To Coast AM, he was compelling, a great story teller and passionate.  This video has none of those aspects.  I think if you could partner him up with someone who knows how to put together a compelling doc there would be something worth watching.

8305571,1,B001GJ7ZHU,"The first 18 minutes of this is really bad computer generated crap. The whole thing has horrible music playing on and off in the background. The horrible computer generations keep coming up throughout. Most of their ""facts"" are completely made up. They don't even make sense. They go off to speak about a ""large black cat"" that lives in Kentucky, which is BS so it just makes the rest of the stuff they talk about seem like BS as well. Most of it is just random scenery shots. In one report from someone the Bigfoot was just standing around calmly with deer around it. In another, the deer were scared of the Bigfoot and running away... you can't have it be both, either deer are scared of it because it is a Predator, or deer don't mind it because it doesn't eat deer. 43 minutes into it and they are finally in a night hunt for Bigfoot. Their night investigation had no evidence, was just full of feelings and ""knowing we are not alone"" BS.  They claim to see a light moving in the woods but never turn the camera that way to catch it on film. The light the show looks computer generated after the fact put in...
They spent like 5 minutes driving to, standing around, then driving from, Daniel Boone's grave. They found out facts from the local library and can't remember their lines for a segment, they had to read lines from paper. This is called ""...The Mystery of Panther Rock"" it took 79 minutes to get to panther rock! They are getting interviews from people that are telling stories of stories. It's not first hand accounts, it's someone talking about a story they heard from someone else... If they were to cut out all the scenery shots and music, they could have probably for this down to under 75 minutes. I would not recommend watching this if you are looking for an actual documentary on Bigfoot. This is more of opinions and boring CG.",1512259200,,1850,4.457227138643068

The group leader is pointing emphatically to a position off camera, but the camera never leaves the faces of the crew. That ruined it for me.",1492646400,2,338,4.296875
