4513396,5,B00507T4BO,"Cardiff was the master cinematographer. This movie is a great jumping off point to watch all of his movies and understand the difficulties and solutions during the filming of the first technicolor movies. Combine this with the Story of Film, an Odyssey and you have an excellent course in filmography.",1379808000,2,301,5.04
4513397,5,B00507T4BO,"Jack Cardiff (19142009)  I accidentally ran across this film on TCM while channel surfing and caught about half of it and knew I had to have it. If you are a film buff you will absolutely want a copy of this on DVD. If you are not familiar with his work, do a search on IMDB for Jack Cardiff and you will see how much this ""cameraman"" contributed to real film over the years. The extras on the DVD are great too. This film will make you check the credits of every great film you watch to see if he was behind the camera. Thanks Jack, for giving us so much.",1373155200,2,556,4.009009009009009

4513401,5,B00507T4BO,"I first saw this intimate and informative documentary on TCM, and was so impressed that I immediately went online, found it on Amazon, and ordered a copy. Jack Cardiff's body of work is impressive, but it's his self deprecating personality, seemingly uneffected by his successful porfolio, that caught my eye. In the infancy of color cinimetography, the Technicolor people were looking for cimematographers in England to train to use their unique three strand system. Grilled by the Technicolor staff with highly technical questions, Cardiff simply said, ""Well, I'm not really a very technical person. I just look at beautiful paintings and copy the lighting."" They selected him, to his surprise, and the rest is history. Cardiff's early camera work for brilliant British director Michael Powell yielded: A Matter of Life and Death (Stairway To Heaven), Black Narcissus, and The Red Shoes. Cardiff's delightful interview is evenly spaced throughout the film, along with Marty Scorsese, Lauren Becall, Kim Hunter, Thelma Schoonmaker, Alan Parker and many others. Scorsese's revelation that he styled the fight scenes in Raging Bull after The Red Shoes' ballet sequences is worth the price of this DVD alone. So is the behind-the-scenes look at the making of Black Narcissus. Cardiff's prolific crareer spanned seventy years. CAMERAMAN, is a delightful and informative look at the life and career of one of cinematography's giants.",1349395200,3,1429,5.383928571428571
4513402,5,B00507T4BO,This title is a gem- Cameraman Jack Cardiff is not a household name and were it not for this film I wouldn't have been exposed to type of individual that  is almost unknown today - an exalted master craftsman.,1347494400,,209,4.358974358974359
4513403,5,B00507T4BO,"I learned much from this documentary, especially the info concerning the application of the original IB Technicolor. Cardiff's explanation of techniques involved in the making of his many films, including Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes is fascinating!",1320105600,6,254,5.7105263157894735
4513404,5,B00507T4BO,"The stories, the visuals, the technical insights make this just a stunning bit of entertainment.  I agree completely with the other reviewer as to the startling qualities of this film.  A must see for the film lover.  What more can I say?",1316995200,3,238,4.619047619047619
4513405,5,B00507T4BO,"Among Italian cinematographers, only one name really stands out: Mario Bava(see ""A Drop of Water"" from his ""Black Sabbath"" trilogy). But the most important person in the history of color cinematography is surely Jack Cardiff.  Scottish documentarian Craig McCall spent thirteen years tracking down a list of people needed to give the proper insight to the work of Cardiff, who passed away, sadly, just before this film was completed. The participants were more than happy to talk about the man they called the greatest cinematographer of all time. The DVD includes directors Richard Fleischer, Peter Yates, and Martin Scorsese and actors Lauren Bacall, Charlton Heston, John Mills, and Kirk Douglas. Jack Cardiff's career spans the entire history of motion pictures, from the silent era to today's high definition technology. Cardiff started as a child actor in English silent films, and graduated to become a camera operator. Later, his career as a Technicolor cinematographer blossomed. You've heard of ""painting with a camera"". Cardiff ""painted with a camera"". Literally. He was a classic painter himself, studying and re-drawing Rembrandt and other artists. He mastered cinema ""paint on glass"". His love of classical painting and color technology produced some of the richest, most strikingly beautiful films ever made. The real star of ""Cameraman"" is the glorious, fully-restored clips from ""Black Narcissus"", ""The Red Shoes"", ""Pandora and the Flying Dutchman"", ""The African Queen, ""The Magic Box"", ""The Vikings"", and ""The Barefoot Contessa"". An extended analysis of ""Black Narcissus"" reveals a powerful study about nuns converting a brothel into a chapel in Nepal. Striking outdoor sequences on windy mountain cliffs were shot, not on location, but in London at Pinewood Studios: Cardiff movie magic. In 1953, actor Errol Flynn hired Cardiff to direct ""William Tell"", and constructed a Tyrolean village in Courmayeur, Italy, in the valley below Mont Blanc. Flynn invested most of his entire personal fortune($500,000) before the Italian backers ended funding. About 30 minutes of footage was completed, and the film was never released. The Alpine village set was torn down in 1979. Several brief color scenes remain, with Flynn in action. No sound-track has ever been found. More extensive scenes can be found in the 2005 documentary ""Adventures of Errol Flynn"". Jack Cardiff received two Academy Awards: one in 1947 for Cinematography, and an honorary Oscar in 2001. Cardiff died on April 22, 2009, at the age of 94. The DVD is in anamorphic 1.78 with high quality film clips. Generous extras include ""Interview with Craig McCall"", ""Jack's Actress Portraits"", with shots of his photos of Marilyn Monroe, Sophia Loren, and more, and ""Jack's Behind the Scenes"", with 16mm home movies on the sets of ""African Queen, ""The Vikings"", and ""Legend of the Lost"", with John Wayne. You also get ""Cinematographer/Director Relationship"", ""Working with Three-Strip Technicolor"", a ""Photos Gallery"", and the trailer. Late in the film, Cardiff is seen in France at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. Walking with the interviewer, Cardiff strolls throught the festival grounds. Young movie fans stop, and look, and wonder: Who is that famous old man? Cardiff laughs and tells the interviewer: ""These young kids have no idea who I am. Sometimes they ask me, and I say: I'm the stand-in for Frank Sinatra.""",1313798400,14,3390,5.312849162011173
8450807,5,B00507T4BO,Had seen this on cable. An eloquent testament to one of the cinema's premier cinematographers.,1481500800,,94,5.333333333333333
8450808,5,B00507T4BO,"Film making has existed for ten decades and legendary cinematographer Jack Cardiff had a career that spanned nine of those. His work with Technicolor forever changed how we see film and his vivid colors and effects brought stories to life. It can be argued that Jack Cardiff was the greatest color cameraman who ever lived.

He was behind the camera, working for 87 years. Most people do not even live that long, but that is what corresponds to the dates on his resume. 87 years and a body of with that includes films such as Black Narcissus (1947) and The Red Shoes (1948). Films that showed the world that Technicolor was made of astonishingly vibrant colors that sprung forth from the screen. In addition, he directed 13 films and worked in both Hollywood and in London. It's hard to imagine the same man capturing the magical ballet in ""The Red Shoes"" being the same man who focused on the blood in ""Rambo"" First Blood Part II"".

About half way through the film, there is a director who asks for an opening shot where mist is needed and Jack simply walks over to the front of his camera, breathes onto the lens and misty magic is created. He painted the glass, created filters and worthed with light that was ingenious at the time. He loved light and shadow and created effects long before special effects departments existed. For 87 of his 94 years of life, he lived, breathed and made films. Artistically, beautifully, magically and graciously - he painted the canvas of film like the art masters - bringing us something entirely new and drawing us into the work.

The interviews with the people who worked with him show a man who was respected, admired and loved. He himself discusses his love of photography and shares some iconic portraits of the beautiful actresses of the time. Cameraman is a poignant look at a man who changed the way we see the world.",1440720000,,1864,4.625377643504532

8450812,4,B00507T4BO,We get some insight into natural genius that's honed through his own enthusiasm about life and others.  We also get to see behind the scenes and dialogs of movies we've known and loved.  I wish I'd known him.,1397433600,,208,4.447368421052632
8450813,3,B00507T4BO,"I didn't see it till now, but I had expected it to have subtitles, so vieuwing it will be a little more difficult for me. So the three stars are for Jack Cardiff himself who I greatly admire.",1392163200,,191,4.052631578947368
8450814,5,B00507T4BO,"If someone needs an explanation of why the reflections of this great man who first was the ""Head Camera Man"" (I'm getting too old to remember even simple terms used in the film titles) and later as a Director, they would not have the knowledge to understand the importance of the ""Cinematographer"".",1386720000,,298,4.75
8450815,4,B00507T4BO,"The cinematographer Jack Cardiff might not be that well known. but he worked as director pf photography on some seminal productions, notably for Powell and Pressburger in the late 1940s.  The visual style of THE RED SHOES (1948) and BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) is chiefly down to Cardiff's brilliant photography, allied to Powell's imagination.  Cardiff began his career in the 1930s working on quota quickies in the British film industry, and was still working in 2007-8, when much of this documentary was filmed.  In between he worked on other seminal productions, notably THE AFRICAN QUEEN (1951), THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA (1954), and THE VIKINGS (1957).  Cardiff comes across as a modest person with a highly developed visual intelligence.  The documentary also contains reminiscences from stars who are no longer with us, such as Sir John Mills, and Kathleen Byron, as well as such luminaries as Scorsese.  Definitely worth a look for anyone interested in photography in the pre-digital era.",1385424000,2,988,5.261146496815287
