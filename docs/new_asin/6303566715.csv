7850129,3,6303566715,"In the mid-1980s, director Hector Olivera (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Shadow-You-Soon-Will-Be/dp/B0000633TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Shadow You Soon Will Be</a>) decided to get in on the sword & sorcery craze of the time, and the resulting production was what you see here: a B-movie mixture that's equal parts&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars/dp/B0006VIE4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/0544003411/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>, called ""Wizards of the Lost Kingdom."" Since its release, it's gained the reputation as a hidden gem of schlock - something I won't attempt to challenge, but it's definitely one of the more watchable gems of schlock I've seen. There are plenty of reasons for which even forgiving film audiences would turn their noses up at this little mess, but despite lots of cinematic missteps and many head-scratching dramatic choices, the movie is genuinely fun and worth a watch for the odd viewer.

The story: when a magical kingdom is overtaken by the scheming sorcerer Shurka (Thom Christopher,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buck-Rogers-in-the-25th-Century/dp/B0002MHDW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buck Rogers in the 25th Century</a>), Simon - son of the royal wizard (Vidal Peterson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes/dp/B0001I55U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Something Wicked This Way Comes</a>) - embarks on a quest with the aid of the roaming warrior Kor (Bo Svenson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inglorious-Bastards/dp/B00140PKCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inglorious Bastards</a>) to stem the forces of evil.

Screenwriter Ed Naha has built a career of sci-fi novels, film novelizations, and being one of the scribes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Honey-I-Shrunk-the-Kids/dp/B000065V42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</a>, so I assume that he's typically a talented guy. However, his method of storytelling for this flick is scatterbrained: there are umpteen instances of the heroes encountering characters of limited relevance to the plot (e.g. the Cyclops, the mermaid, the zombies) and occurrences of completely facetious events (e.g. Simon manages to destroy Shurka's ability to spy on him via a magic basin, but within minutes he's back at it, as though nothing's happened). I can't help but think that the filmmakers came up with a bunch of great ideas they wanted to see in the film but couldn't think of but the barest reasons to inject them into the script, and ended up throwing caution to the winds and filling the picture with a ton of these mini-detours. Without them, the movie's 72-minute runtime could easily be cut in half. Luckily, it doesn't take much prodding for the story to return to its focus, and for what it's worth, the distractions are roundly weird and interesting enough to be worth the bypass.

I can't help but think that the movie's budget was spread thin by its scope. The costumes, prosthetics, puppetry, special effects, and sets range from passable to mediocre in quality - better than those in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quest-for-the-Mighty-Sword/dp/6301759338/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quest for the Mighty Sword</a>&nbsp;but worse than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conan-the-Destroyer/dp/0783225946/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conan the Destroyer</a>'s - but several pieces are good enough that I believe fewer effects would have left the remaining ones looking superior. The characters are little more than fantasy caricatures, but inoffensive and decently entertaining to watch in action. No one in the cast is a great performer, but the storyline doesn't call for it. The only character I could genuinely do without is Simon's furry bodyguard/Chewbacca-knockoff Gulfax (Edgardo Moreira): not only is his costume the worst in the movie, but he's also an entirely worthless character who contributes literally nothing to the story. Additionally, the action scenes roundly blow: every swordfight is a flop, and the climactic magic duel between Simon and Shurka is...well, very anticlimactic.

You may feel a bit silly, watching ""Wizards of the Lost Kingdom,"" but at least you won't feel dirty like you would watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Troll-2/dp/B003ZD9DSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Troll 2</a>. There is no guarantee at all that you will genuinely like this film, but if you're up for a cheap, ambitious fantasy outing from this period that isn't as boring as many of its cohorts, it's worth a peek.",1363651200,,4995,6.9364069952305245
7850130,5,6303566715,"I originally saw this movie when I rented from a place called Video Barn that was going out of business.  My only regret is that we did not purchase this movie then.  It is one of those movies so ridiculously bad that it comes back around to being good.  It is hilariously bad.  Between bad costumes, and a dorky premise, and straight up theft of scenes from other movies that the main character is sort of reacting to, it hits all the wrong/right notes.  Plus, it stars Bo Svenson, who, aside from having an epic name, is crazy bad/good as an actor.  If you like bad movies, and especially bad fantasy, check this movie out.",1306454400,2,625,4.391304347826087
7850131,2,6303566715,"Actually, the lovely Maria Socas did The

Warrior and the Sorceress w/ Carradine

(topless!) in 1984, one-and-a-half yrs.,

before this came out. Welles redid his

role with Carradine in 1989. The '89

version with Bobby Jacoby, Sid Haig,

et, al is better. These movies inspired

the Harry Pothead Series. I wouldn't

recommend these for kids, but it's harm-

less adults. Carradine reprises his 'Dark

One/Kaine' role from Wizards of the Lost

kingdom here, instead of the Svenson cha-

racter of the W.O.t. L.K. role of the first

1985 film, an improvement, even if he was

wearing a wig!",1154995200,,591,4.8979591836734695
7850132,5,6303566715,"This movie is so bad that one has to see it.  I'm pretty sure its musical score was tooken from the score done by James Horner for the movie, Krull.  In the beginning of the movie it says, ""Bo Svenson in"" and then it says, ""Wizards of the Lost Kingdom.""  Who the hell is Bo Svenson?  I've never heard of him.  This movie does have some charm though.  When watching this, I couldn't take my eyes off the bad acting, bad direction, etc.  I'm not joking.  I watched this thing all the way through and despite the fact that it was horrible, I loved it.  I wish they would show more of that Bo Svenson.  He really steals the show.",977529600,4,625,4.133333333333334
7850133,5,6303566715,"I had the opportunity of seeing this film about a year ago when a copy was passed to me and \i was asked to watch it.
I was amazed, a fantastic original storyline of good verses evil where eventually the good guys  triumph.
I noticed that at present the video has been deleted from  production, big no no!
Any kid should watch this, a little bit of  romance, a little bit of fantasy, a little bit of horror and a little bit  of action.
The movie caters for all, so don't delay, if it's still  available in your local video store, BUY IT NOW!
Definitely the best  movie I've seen in a long while.",952905600,3,595,4.175438596491228
