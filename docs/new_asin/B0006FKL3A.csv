8041286,5,B0006FKL3A,"My son and I have a mission; to create the best baseball player he can possibly be by utilizing every tool available.  As a coach of rec league kids for the last seven years, I have struggled to teach hitting to boys who don't have the skill naturally.  It seems no matter how many swings they take in the bat cage, hitting live baseballs brings all the bad habits to the surface.

Dave Hudgens excellent series, Hitting For Excellence, takes a step by step approach that begins with choosing the proper bat, and moves a coach and his players through every facet of hitting.  Hudgens has plenty of big-league credibility, and uses his son as a model for little leaguers to emulate.

While most videos focus on what to do right, Hudgens takes time to demonstrate and explain what can go wrong for a hitter, how to recognize it as a coach, and how to fix it for the player.  For example, he explains in detail how the wrong hand grip can change the way the player's front elbow elevates during the swing, and how this small error can cascade through the rest of the player's at-bat.

Even the smallest details do not escape his attention; when demonstrating how to swing from a crouch, he takes time to emphasize the absolute importance of keeping the head still throughout the swing, and to keep the eyes at the same height in order to see the ball properly.

In segment after segment, Hudgens style as a patient and careful teacher comes through.  There's no big-league braggadocio here.  Theres a real sense that this is a man who loves the game, loves to teach it, and loves to see kids succeed.

The important lesson I want to leave with potential purchasers is this:  we all have lessons to learn.  Some as a player, but more importantly, we have to be willing to admit our failings as a coach in order to help our players and teams reach the next level of excellence.",1259712000,2,1872,4.486725663716814
