8751491,5,B01BTV8KU0,"We bought region 2 (non USA format) DVDs so we could finish this wonderful series.  It was bittersweet because most of the original actors have died and new ones have been added to the story line, but it's still a fun series and we're glad we purchased.  The DVDs worked flawlessly in our region-free player.",1516838400,,308,4.581818181818182
