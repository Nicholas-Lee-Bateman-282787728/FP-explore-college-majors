8033570,5,B0002W19RE,"I have enjoyed Billy Connoly's Tour of Australia since seeing it originally broadcast on TV in England. It is one of the most intellectually stunning, interesting and thought-provoking travel documentaries I have ever seen. And boy, has he done his homework. I haven't laughed so much in years. Competes with the goons!! My only negative comment, and it's not that I am prudish, but I did find personally, that the constant use of his colourful language in his show-clips, a little too much at times. But then, that is Billy. This is a masterpiece.",1344988800,2,548,4.840425531914893
