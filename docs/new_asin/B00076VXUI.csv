8045147,5,B00076VXUI,"Never having grown up with dogs or any real animals in my family (my sister's mice and my mother's parakeets don't count as real animals), I adopted a 1.5 year old black lab mix in 2000 from the inner-city, Washington DC animal shelter who knew no commands. Rumors were that he ran around with a mean gang before being caught.  Anyway, here I was, with no experience how to own or  train a dog, a new owner of a dog who had never been trained before.  A few disclosures:  Moose is a smart dog, as dogs go.  For the first year after I adopted him, I had time to train him almost every day for at least 30 minutes. His inner-city history was truly unknown, but I am sure that he wasn't trained to be mean and ugly.

I used the methods from the New Skete monk videos and in the 7 years I have owned him, Moose has become the greatest animal companion I have ever known.  He can:  sit, stay, come, lie down and heel. He is a terrific frisbee dog. He can do these things with major distractions going on around him, including other dogs (most of the time). When living in Manhattan, I easily trained him to not step off of the curb without a command. In my suburban neighborhood I almost never use a leash and control him almost exclusively with verbal and hand signal commands. Most importantly, the videos provided me with a means to connect with this animal, and Moose is truly a member of my family.  The training experience was also beneficial for me in the sense that I got a new perspective on animal and human behavior which has affected how I now raise my two young children (don't read too far into that analogy).  You may get these benefits from other training methods, but I can assure you that the New Skete Way is based on positive, loving and effective training methods.",1171065600,4,1780,4.3343373493975905
8045148,5,B00076VXUI,*****THIS IS A FIVE STAR TRAINING TECHNIQUE!  We trained our two hunting dogs the New Skete way and are known in our circle of friends for having some of the best behaved dogs any of them have ever seen. The training techniques in this video absolutely work IF YOU ARE CONSISTENT. I will always use the New Skete methods and highly recommend it to any dog owner who cares about having well-behaved animals to make the dog's life--and yours--the most rewarding experience it can be.,1113955200,5,481,4.658823529411765
