5660392,3,B00BNV9WCM,"This movie is basically ""Misery"" with family. Love Sick Love is a realistic movie, something that could happen, but I highly unlikely this could really happen. This movie had an interesting plot and had quite a few twists and turns. Being a fan of M. Emmet Walsh, I was amused with his and Charlotte Rae performance as Dori's (Katia Winter)crazy parents. Love Sick Love is a B movie at best, but interesting. I'd recommended if your bored.",1374624000,,439,4.714285714285714
5660393,5,B00BNV9WCM,"This was a movie of ""WOW. I didn't expect the ending so it was a surprise.  Great actors.  I watched it twice.",1373760000,,110,3.9545454545454546
5660394,4,B00BNV9WCM,"The film opens with first person narration from Dori (Katia Winter) who talks about love. She has apparently met Mr. Right in Norman (Matthew Settle). They have an intimate relationship she reads too much into. Norman agrees to a long weekend getaway to a secluded home up north. Here Norman is surprised by Dori's two children and grandparents. Things turn sour after Dori says the dreaded ""L"" word and we soon see Norman in the tied up condition depicted on the cover.

Dori abides by a relationship book that claims you have to experience all the holidays with each other, which she quickly does in June, with her family considering the odd behavior normal.

This is indeed a quirky film, one for women who have grown tired of bad relationships. It is an impressive indie which oozed with dark comedy and ironic statements. Great date night film.

5660395,4,B00BNV9WCM,"great little film, that is sure to please and have everybody talking about. the storyline is a little hard to make sense of but the acting and locations were very well done. the main actor and actress were very attactive and the attraction for each other was at first instantaneous. but as the story progresses the very sexy actress/lover shows a little more of a very weird family and up-bringing. seems like everyday there is a different holiday that the family celebrates complete with all the make up and costumes. Just wonder if there could be a true relation between a guy and gal when the girl is very sexy but totally off the wall. film was very entertaining and a little hard to watch with how the guy was abused by his girlfriend, one memorable scene has the actress stuff some unmentionables into the guys mouth to keep him from talking... unbelievable. overall this would be a great film for couples, and sure that they would have plenty to say about it.",1371340800,,966,4.589595375722543
5660396,5,B00BNV9WCM,"I enjoyed this movie a great deal and was happily entertained by the twisted mind of Dori.  There's no doubt that guys like Norman exist. I think the really gut-wrenching thought is that women like Dori exist.  Women like this are beautiful, determined and think they have all of the answers.  The worst part is that they usually think they have the answers because they have entire families behind them telling them they deserve the best, no matter what it takes.  It's a really common mentality.  I think this is a good warning to guys who take advantage of these seemingly innocent, fragile women because chances are, there's hell to pay.",1370908800,,641,4.738738738738738
5660397,5,B00BNV9WCM,"We ALL know people like Dori & Norman especially out in the dating world.  Loved this movie.  It is darkly funny at times, brutally honest in other moments with a lesson woven throughout.  We'lll be watching LSL, again with and/ without the guys; definitely conversation provoking.  Oh, besides the awesome Katia Winter & Matthew Settle, Charlotte Rae & Emmett Walsh, in their roles, are another reason to view this flick!",1370822400,,422,4.985714285714286
5660398,2,B00BNV9WCM,"If you are looking for a comedy this is not it. The acting is good, but the story is very dark. It is another movie, like Struck By Lightning, that has been miss marketed to pull in a wider audience. If you are looking for light  and happy: look elsewhere. This is not to say the move is poorly made, it is not. Possible spoiler: Think Misery.",1370390400,,343,4.119402985074627

You know your date is NOT going well when --- you wake up duct taped to a chair wearing grandma's earrings!  (the picture on the DVD cover).  This terrific black comedy is not very well known, but it does have some merit if you are into the genre.  It is a relationship comedy and can have a little bit of a ""Lifetime Movie"" feel at first.  But make no mistake, the black humor will kick in with a little more pith as it wades in.  It gets a lot more wacked from there!  I am not saying it's the funniest movie in the world, but it's worth more than the low profile it currently receives.

THE PLOT: Norman is you're stereotypical womanizing jerk who isn't looking for commitment. One of his ""conquests"", Dori (played by the very beautiful Katia Winter) invites him for a long weekend getaway. She may seem a little needy, but her sexuality is more than persuasive, and he accepts. Things are clearly not going as planned when she tells him she loves him and gives him a Valentine's gift.... IN JUNE. What's more, they are not alone and members of her family are in on the craziness. Think ""Misery"" with granny, gramps, and her kids all involved. Dori previously told Norman that making it through all the holidays of the year together was a sign a relationship is meant to be. Well, beginning with Valentines, she drags Norman through all the holidays of the year, crammed into just one long week. Meanwhile, he discovers if he doesn't escape before ""New Years"" there is a very special finale in store. Dark discoveries, bizzar pretend holidays, and a few hilarious moments carry this movie through.

This movie is darkly comedic. It may not be a complete knee slapper, nor a horror movie. However, I did find the situations and results pretty humorous throughout. I recommend it as a rental for a mildly dark, funny comedy. The acting is well done and production values are good for what I would still call a B movie.",1369872000,,1962,4.516949152542373
5660400,5,B00BNV9WCM,"I saw this film at the St. Louis Film Festival and totally enjoyed it from begininng to end. Beautiful young mom finds handsome young partner thought it was going to be a love story, turns out to have it all, love, horror, suspense and comedic chaos. Definitely worth seeing. One of my favorite scenes was when  Albert recounts and reminds Norman about the specific profanities he used and how many times he used them.",1364256000,6,418,4.648648648648648

8571726,4,B00BNV9WCM,"This was a good and weird movie for sure!!this woman sandbagged this poor guy(well not really poor)into going to the inlaws country home for a holiday(actually all of them)and goes psycho on him! Kind of what he deserves in a way but not to this extreme!!he's a serial dater or user for cheap thrill's! The rest of her family is in on it and some interesting events take place! the lead male actor was in ""The Band of Brothers"" and does a great job with the psycho chick. Its worth watching if your into psycho drama's but funny at times also!!!The grandma and grandpa was really great!!haha!!Hope you enjoy!!",1401667200,,609,4.5963302752293576
8571727,4,B00BNV9WCM,"I write very few of these reviews, I only write them if the movie is really bad or very good. I thought this movie was very good, I have not laughed watching a comedy in a long time, do not be fooled by the first 20 minutes of this film, I thought for sure this was going to be very bad in fact my wife and I agreed we would give it ten more minutes, we wore very happy we did, the acting was fantastic the story has been done before but this is very funny, I believe his name is Matthew Settle I had never seen him before very funny, he and the lead actress, played off each other fantastic I saw it on Netflix it is a free right now in fact it is the only reason I even watched it, give it a try very enjoyable especially if you need a good laugh, you will not be disappointed.",1384387200,,779,3.8447204968944098

8571729,2,B00BNV9WCM,"I only gave this movie 2 stars because I made it to the (totally predictable) end.  It was a very strange movie with little character development, completely stereotypical playboy man and love-hungry woman.  Of course the woman thinks there is more to the relationship than just their physical attraction and is willing to go to any (read: crazy) lengths to make something more of it.  Both the main characters were unlikable and I didn't really care what happened to either of them.  I only watched through the end because Dori's dysfunctional family was slightly interesting.  I didn't pay to see this movie and I don't recommend that anyone else do so either.  Whatever movie is playing on Lifetime Movie Channel right now is probably better than this dreck.",1378080000,,761,4.90625
8571730,3,B00BNV9WCM,"I expected more from the movie. It was okay, but not worth paying money to rent. It actually kinda sucked.",1375056000,,106,4.35
