8118498,1,B000F7CE0M,"From the description of this 'movie' this short film is supposed to be about four straight friends who are trying to help their closeted gay friend Lawrence have his first gay date.  Lawrence may have been in the closet but as he declares his sexuality, he wants to have a true romance rather than casual encounters.  After one of the friends meets a masseur who obviously has more to offer than a body rub, the friend shares the experience with the group and they all convince Lawrence to try the masseur. He does, but the experience does not free his libido as the masseur is a vaguely remembered high school acquaintance.  Wondering if the masseur is sincere in his pledge of being attracted, Lawrence convinces his straight friends to each have a massage to see if the masseur gives everyone the same treatment - or if there is indeed something special to his attention to Lawrence.

The bulk of the film is five massage sessions, each of which is equal.  The film opens with the masseur in the shower solo but tumescent: there is considerable frontal nudity here.  In all, the film seems like a vague excuse for soft gay porn and fails at that.  The 'stars' include Christopher Ward, David Joseph, Ephrain Gonzales Jr., Jason Matthews and Rock Rogers.  The package insert come-on is ""Can his supportive straight friends help him find love with the one person he's always had a crush on?""  But don't look for a story - unless watching massages is your idea of a movie.  Grady Harp, October 06",1159747200,6,1496,4.632575757575758
