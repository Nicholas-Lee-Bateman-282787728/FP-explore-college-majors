3598542,5,B001GBIOT6,"This woman is 59 with her daughter.  It's a no glitz, get to business workout with weights.  I'm 55 & have an unbelievable body too because of this workout. If you want a cutesy, bouncy workout that hardly does anything for you then this isn't for you. Your muscles will transform with this.  I love it.  Great for bone density too.",1338681600,4,332,4.39344262295082
3598543,5,B001GBIOT6,"OK, so I was REALLY out of shape.  I started following this video workout with the lightest set of weights two months ago and just now increased the weights a notch.  The new weights are as much as I can handle.  I already am seeing an improvement in my arms and waistline.  Although I cannot do all the reps in the abs routine yet.  If you do this workout consistently, it is very effective.  I recommend it.",1336435200,,409,4.246753246753247
3598544,5,B001GBIOT6,"This dvd and book are worth their weight in gold to me.  I can recommend it 100 percent. I worked out with Ms. Vedral's book ""Now or Never"" in the 90's, and then gradually forgot about it...weight training was in, so I did her book and it got great results.

 I didn't know then I had a six hundred pound aunt on my father's side, and I would have to watch my weight like a hawk for the rest of my life.  In total desperation at a high of 405 lbs, after turning 50 and realizing I had little to look forward to except exceeding my aunt's weight; I bought her book and dvd, ""Bottoms UP"" and it has made such a difference in my life, I spring out of bed in the morning and do my workout, and forget about it, my vitally needed exercise is done. I also suffer from high blood pressure, so I very carefully started the workout by doing nothing but the warm up for weeks before I lifted one dumbbell to get my body used to working out after decades of neglect.

 I made my daughter turn off the tv and grab my camera a few days ago because I have lost over 50 lbs in three months, and my body is shaping up so fast I could hardly believe it.  Last time this happened I was taking ballet classes as a teen.

Dr. Joyce is funny and smart, and she carefully structures the exercises so a severely overweight woman can do them.  Sometimes we even get to sit down.  I feel taken care of, and I will eventually buy every single book and dvd she has. 348 lbs feels so good compared to the 405 I was, and I can't wait to take off even more!
Most exercise videos are hopeless for a woman of my extreme size, but Joyce includes me too!  I feel comfortable because she is older than me, with a fantastic body.  Le'ts me know you don't have to let it go just because you are over 40!
 Joyce talks directly to the customer in her dvd's. I like her funny warm style, and she ANSWERS EMAILS!!  I was so shocked when she confided on the dvd, that she came from a fat family too, and said they all looked like boxes; except for the ones doing her workout.  HELLO!  That's me.  The only time I felt skinny was going to NY and visiting my father's side of the family.  Unfortunately for me, I have lived with my mother's side and most of them, including my mother are all quite small.  Joyce gets our weight struggle and and has the tools to help!  I am an African-American fan of Joyce's, come join me in restructuring our bodies and living the life we were meant to have.  I feel so much better finally doing something about something that has been in my way all my life.",1321401600,19,2549,4.098790322580645
3598545,5,B001GBIOT6,"I purchased the Bottoms Up book by Joyce Vedral over 10 years ago and I worked the program enough to reach my targeted goal and then I got off of the program; mainly because it was hard to read the book while attempting to keep a steady exercise pace. The factor of exercising alone also contributed to my quitting.  I have had this tape of the program for about three weeks and the visual aspect of exercising has a much better benefit.  Because I am exercising with Joyce and her daughter, I don't feel the sense of exercising alone.  The workout isn't as mundane as it used to be. However, because I have read the book and continue to reference it in conjunction with the video tape to target problem areas of my body, I am not only losing weight and getting firmer and healthier by the day but I'm enjoying myself while doing it.  Thumbs up to Joyce Vedral for an even greater venture.",1315353600,6,889,4.36969696969697
3598546,5,B001GBIOT6,She's a bit of a drill sergeant but her advice is invaluable.  I hope I'm in half as good shape when I'm her age.,1311033600,,113,3.7083333333333335
3598547,4,B001GBIOT6,"I enjoyed the DVD.  It's good to switch between the Bottoms Up! book and DVD now and then for a change.  The DVD is a little more challenging than the book, in my opinion.  For me, it normally takes longer to do the DVD exercise program than the book.  If you're a beginning exerciser, this is a good way to break in to working out with weights.  It took me about a month to do all sets and reps for all the exercises with weights, but I'm seeing good results from following Joyce's exercise plan.",1292371200,3,497,4.189473684210526
3598548,5,B001GBIOT6,I love this one too.  It is a great full body routine that can be done as a split routine.  I do Upper Body + Abs on Day 1 and Lower Body on Day 2 and then repeat for a 6 day rotation with 1 day off.  I also like Fat Burning but it is done really fast with lighter weights.  In Bottoms Up! you move at a somewhat slower pace so it is easier to use heavier weights when you are ready.  And fortunately Joyce's daughter is doing all of the counting so no mess ups like Fat Burning!  This is also a newer DVD so the clothing and hair is more modern.  I recommend this one to anyone who is looking for a really good straight forward weight lifting routine geared towards women of any age.  I'm currently only on week 2 but I expect to see great results.  Thank you Joyce!,1254700800,13,767,3.9285714285714284
3598549,5,B001GBIOT6,"It has helped me with weight training. I did not know much about it before I started working with her. She makes you work hard, but it is well worth it. I can see changes in the way I look.",1243468800,3,189,3.75
3598550,5,B001GBIOT6,"Ok, who cares about the music, excitement, or Joyce's accent if she gets that cellulite off your thighs?  Sounds a little petty to me.  Bottom's Up is a total body workout that focuses on the abs, butt, and thighs.  Everything else will look good, too.  (Chest, Shoulders, Biceps, Triceps, Back, Calves are also worked) By using a sensible low fat diet and using her dvds, particularly this one...I've completely reshaped my thighs, smoothed out the backs of my thighs, got a nicer butt and a smaller stomach.  I haven't lost all the weight I want to lose just yet, but I'm confident that I'll look the best I can.  This dvd is targeted (in my opinion) to slightly older women who are timid about picking up a weight for fear they'll look manly.  You won't look manly, but you will be very, very pleased.  It's for all ages and body types.  The thigh, butt, and ab sections are a little challenging.  Don't be afraid.  Just work your way up until you're doing all the repititions.  For the first time in my life I don't hate my thighs.  I can wear normal pants.  :D  Hooray!

by the way, the cellulite smoothing took about 12 weeks.  But I think the actual amount of time depends on the amount of fat on the body.  I'm a bigger girl.  It might take a little less or more time for you, but I do believe it will work. :D",1236038400,31,1318,4.327868852459017
8304766,4,B001GBIOT6,"I had the VHS version of this back in the 90's and liked the results I got. Fast forward, wanted to have the same workout, so ordered the DVD. Very satisfied and was working on building up my stamina to do all of the repetitions, then bam, got a virus which has set me back a few weeks. Cant wait to get back into it. One workout takes about 40 minutes which it just right for me. I'm 64, and this kind of layers easy exercises with more difficult ones.",1522022400,,453,4.044444444444444
8304767,5,B001GBIOT6,Excellent workout mostly . I really loved the lower body part as it is so complete. Easy to follow. Joyce is such a good trainer!,1407888000,,129,4.2
8304768,5,B001GBIOT6,"I totally recommend Joyce's DVD workouts.  She is motivating, explains technique and benefits.  She is awesome and her workouts are the best for beginning to advance.  Just change the amount of weight used.  totally recommend this DVD.",1401840000,,235,5.27027027027027
8304769,5,B001GBIOT6,Joyce Vedral shows effective ways to a better looking body in a short period of time. I love the way she puts her sets together,1380758400,,127,4.12
8304770,4,B001GBIOT6,I always enjoy working out with Joyce.  Weights for the arms present a challenge. Joyce keeps me focused and thinking positively while exercising.,1380412800,,146,5.3478260869565215
8304771,2,B001GBIOT6,"Joyce vedral,  video is good but, she goes to fast, and she never shuts up in the video. I felt like I needed a Prozac when I was done with the video.  She say write to her when you have a question so I did a few times, all she wrote back was  buy my book. Thanks Joyce, your a big help for a fellow New Yorker, looks like it's just about the cash for You!",1377216000,,356,3.6578947368421053
8304772,3,B001GBIOT6,"I just can't get past the datedness of it.  And sorry, but her body is scary. It doesn't look natural, like someone who had a weight problem and recovered from it. All I see is plastic surgery and wasting my time doing workouts that won't achieve a tight and firm look.  I may as well just go get a butt lift and tummy tuck.",1374710400,2,324,4.046875
8304773,5,B001GBIOT6,"She sticks with the description of what you are doing without all the cutsie stuff, or the yelling in your face attitude.",1362614400,,121,4.545454545454546
8304774,5,B001GBIOT6,Originally bought the VHS tape in the early 90's...I still incorporate these great workouts into my regular routines. Still works after all these years.,1358121600,,152,5.375
8304775,3,B001GBIOT6,"I own the VHS bottoms up series that Joyce released back in the late nineties.  I was looking to upgrade to a DVD version.  Although this a good DVD.  It is missing many of the exercises from the VHS version.  The segments for the lower body and the back are much shorter.  I've tried using this DVD version but just do not feel as though I am getting the same level of exercise as from the VHS series.  I'm not saying that it will not work, I'm sure it will but it is being touted as a replica of the previous version, and it is not.  I would feel better if it was titled as the ""new and improved"" but not as though it is the same release but only in DVD.",1355270400,6,656,3.9242424242424243
