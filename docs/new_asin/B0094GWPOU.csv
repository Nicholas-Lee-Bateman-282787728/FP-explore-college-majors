5261550,4,B0094GWPOU,"This is another case where it is sometimes better to watch a DVD release of a series airing on PBS than watching it on TV. The Bletchley Circle will begin airing on PBS this week as a three-part mystery. And even though you'll need to set aside an hour to watch it each week, the film (broken up into three episodes) is actually only 135 minutes (just over two hours). The episodes flow into one another with no real backtracking and I found that by watching three episodes back to back made for a richer viewing experience. The series was produced for commercial television in the UK, hence the short episodes.

I'm sure a lot of the reviews posted here will be based on those who watched the series on TV and, while I haven't seen the PBS version, my guess is there will be some small edits because of a few graphic images (both violence and sexual. The Blu-ray (and the DVD, I assume) are unedited and each episode runs about 45 minutes).
This film (series?) uses the standard ""looking for the serial killer"" baseline but is different because the crime (well multiple murders) are solved by four women who worked at Bletchley Park - an estate in Buckingham, England where smart women were recruited from Oxford and Cambridge in 1943 to break the ""enemy""'s code. After a brief intro, we are placed in early 1950s post-war London where four of the women - each with their own personality and home life - reunite to find a killer. There are men in the cast but every male character they interact with is either abusive or ignorant of their inner feelings. (Though women viewers will be attracted by the strong female characters, men will like the series too.) Both the script and the film's direction are by men.

Most of the interesting events take part in the third ""episode"", though you need to see the previous two to understand it. Honestly, the only weak parts are when the ""killer"" is on screen. Then it's just like all the ""serial killer"" movies.
The Bluray (and I'm pretty sure the DVD) does have a ""Special Feature"". It's a nicely done 28-minute featurette titled ""Electronic Press Kit"" featuring interviews with the four lead actresses (none of the male actors are included) as well as the production crew. Most of the discussion is centered on the ""design"" of the film and is informative. At the end there is mention that this just MIGHT be the beginning of an ongoing series (another serial rapist perhaps).
None of the cast were familiar to me and that made it even more interesting. It's not as great as some PBS dramas, but I did really like it and would probably give it 4.5 stars.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5261551,4,B0094GWPOU,"With a superb ensemble cast and exceptionally fine design, this is a series worth savouring. The problems for women emerging into grey, dreary, suburban 1950s England after performing life-and-death intelligence work during the war is all too believable. As the murders mount up and clues are pieced together like code-breaking by this group of brilliant but quirky women, the refusal of senior police to believe them or take them seriously becomes hair-raising. Recommended for those who like unusual, well acted suspense.",1360972800,133,523,5.469135802469136
5261552,5,B0094GWPOU,"Centers around a group of women who shared wartime experiences decoding German military messages at Bletchley Park during WWII.  Ten years later, back in the mainstream as 'ordinary' housewives and women, and having to deny their past due to the Official Secrets Act, a series of murders brings them back together.

They are fascinated by the patterns they are trained to spot in the killer's habits.  They are, of course, poo-poo'd by their husbands and police, so they go it on their own -- with certain degrees of danger and difficulty.

A cracking good tale, with a top-notch cast that enjoys each other's company.  The best sort of British TV, without any of the maudlin and saccharine side of Masterpiece Theater (not to mention their constant asking for money, even on a bought-and-paid-for DVD).",1358208000,110,803,4.962686567164179
5261553,4,B0094GWPOU,"When the masterful 2005 version of Bleak House premiered on Masterpiece Theatre, we were all introduced to the talents of Anna Maxwell Martin. She starred as the orphaned, ill-treated Esther who finally found purpose at Bleak House before going on to star in a number of smaller roles. Now she has been restored as a leading lady - and she does it all rather marvelously in this ""adult"" three-part mini-series.

Ordinary is not a word one could ascribe to Susan (Martin). She loves puzzles and cannot seem to shut off her brain no matter how hard she tries - when there's a riddle, she must solve it. Some nine years after WWII, that is exactly what Susan is living: an ordinary life with two children and a husband whose career is on the brink of brilliant success. As a code-cracker during the war, Susan was asked to sign a confidentiality agreement and has kept her work a secret but now there have been a string of horrible murders and by powers of deduction, she's come up with information that could aid the police in their investigations. When the information turns out to produce no results, Susan reaches out to her former colleagues in Lucy (Sophie Rundle), Millie (Rachel Stirling) and Jean (Julie Graham), all of whom are living simpler lives now. Lucy is involved in an unhealthy relationship and Millie is hurt by Susan's dismissal of their friendship, having once promised her that she'd never allow Susan to be ""ordinary""; the girls had grand adventures planned before Susan fell into marital life.

Skeptical to hear out Susan's plans, the girls eventually band together, knowing there is more to Susan's patterns than anyone is willing to notice. They use their training and any resources they can find to follow the serial killer's path. Clues that may lead them right to his doorstep - and possibly endanger their own lives.

One day during my on-line browsing, I happened upon this series and was drawn to it for a pair of reasons. For obvious reasons, the first was its leading lady and then I became interested after references were made to the brilliant Foyle's War in other's reviews. To judge the series by that original Anthony Horowitz penned script may not be fair but it certainly has similarities while holding its own, proving that it is just as exciting, clever and addicting in ways that are unique to its own style. The only flaw in the otherwise spotless scripting is that the series spans a mere three one-hour episode run and there have been no plans to produce more. That is enough to earn a sad face from me.

Restricting my thoughts to only this genre, I am not sure that since Foyle's War, I've met a cast of such fabulous characterizations. It was more fun than I expected to follow these women as they deduced and sought clues to put away a murderer and try to convince the police of their findings in the meantime. Like her prior roles, Anna Maxwell Martin was a fantastic leading lady. She manages to play each character with a quiet grace and the role of Susan is no different. She's compassionate and yet elicits sympathy from us for her apparent inability to calm her busy mind and desire to want to do something that matters. What she doesn't realize is that to her children, just being their ""mummy"" is enough. Her personality doesn't let her enjoy normalcy and yet, we don't doubt that she loves her family. Behind the apparent, she's an interesting character and one that could have been written even more complicated should producers ever see the merit in making the premise a serial. Each of the women has a specialty in their field which makes it easy to distinguish who plays what role in their crime-solving ""book club.""

Though the audience had more to go on than some mysteries, I was impressed how well writer's strung along the viewers with clues. More is revealed than we might expect before the end but it did not detract from the thrill of the chase or seeing the killer brought to justice. There was excitement and danger in the course of one scene and it felt like an enigma that deserved more than an hour to solve. As a story, `Circle' works well, but there are a few places that it lags in pacing though during its majority, three hours was filled nicely and never seemed to fall into being boring or come across as time used poorly in the capacity of a premise that is all too often abused. Filming and staging is equally impressive building suspense when it should and displaying character's lighter sides when the time is right. Unfortunately, The Bletchley Circle is not all ""good."" The premise may be written with precision but in all honesty, it travels down some dark places. The criminal mastermind is not a pleasant place to be yet this British (ITV) produced show has found a compatible balance much like predecessors have. Even in the middle of thoughtless crimes, the characters are not forgotten and they make it jolly good fun.

5261554,5,B0094GWPOU,"I was especially interested in The Bletchley Circle because my mother was a code breaker for the US counterpart. Unlike the British protagonists, who for security reasons are required to tell everyone (even their husbands) that they did only ""clerical work"" during the war, my mother was allowed to state her occupation, although without many details. She did convey to me the intellectual challenges, the excitement, the camaraderie, and the feeling of making a valuable contribution that pervaded the large room where the code breakers worked long hours, just as in this movie.  Like the protagonist Susan, my mother was extremely good at anagrams, crosswords, and other puzzles, but complained that the vast majority of those published were not hard enough. She also loved to read murder mysteries.

However, my mother returned to her academic career, whereas Susan has dutifully become a housewife. By 1952, Susan loves her husband and her two small children, she does her best, but she's bored. She becomes obsessed with a serial killer whose murders of young women are regularly reported in the newspapers.  She tries to determine the killer's schedule, his geographic patterns as he moves around the country, his modus operandi, and his motives. The police have arrested a different man every time, and she's sure those suspects were framed by the real killer. Susan cannot solve the mystery alone, so she recruits her three closest colleagues from Bletchley: Millie, Lucy, and Jean. Jean's strength is research (she's now a librarian), Lucy has an eidetic memory, and Millie is tough and slightly shady, meaning she buys and sells things, including handguns, on the black market.

In some ways this is a typical thriller. The women discover the killer's identity, but are frustrated by Scotland Yard's refusal to listen to female amateurs. Susan takes the lead, becoming the most visible person in the group. As she gets closer to the killer, he gets closer to her, menacing not only Susan but her family. Considering that Susan is not only brilliant but normally sensible, her at times reckless behavior seems improbable. However, the killer is the most challenging intellectual opponent Susan has had for seven years. The conflict between her role as female and housewife, versus her independence and her intellectual needs, is underscored by her husband's periodic commands to stop what she's doing ""whatever it is.""

I don't know whether the team of female detectives will return for a second season, but I certainly hope so. My mother would have loved this series too.",1355356800,367,2581,5.135714285714286

5261587,4,B0094GWPOU,"The concept is wonderful: four women who served at Bletchley Park have settled into their postwar lives, forbidden (by the national secrets act) to discuss the manner in which they contributed to the war effort.  Its as if this part of their lives never existed, though it may have been their lives high point.  Now, a serial killer is on the loose in London; the Met has been unable to stop him.  One of the women perceives a pattern in his actions.  Patterns are what these women do.  She rounds up the team and they go to work.

The result is a highly-entertaining and clever mini-series (with season two to come later).  The production values are strong, as are the performances.  The sets and costumes are exceptional.  Whats not to like?  Not much, but there are some issues of which potential viewers should be aware.  The production company conceives of this story as a thriller, ultimately a psychological thriller, a cat and mouse game between the women and the killer.  That would be fine, but we generally see that done with amateur sleuths who get in over their heads and find themselves staring into the abyss.  These sleuths, however, are professionals.  They defeated Hitler, ladies and gentlemen, and the obvious point is that they should be in charge of the case, not the plods at the Met.

I will not spoil the ending, which confirms their professionalism, but note that we are put through too many horror elements in the interim.  We are also subjected to a heavily-clichd representation of the men in their world.  The best of them are bureaucrats and lummoxes; others are vicious women-beaters.  We all see the point that these highly-skilled women (usually math geniuses, actually) have settled into domestic roles (reinforced by society) that do not play to those skills, but knowing those skills we want to see them in action; we do not want a lecture from Betty Friedan.

The bottom line is that, given their skills, this story is really a police procedural (or professional analyst/math whiz/puzzle solver procedural).  We get those elements and are grateful for them, but, again, there are moments when we fear bad guys jumping out from closet doors and damsels falling into distress.

Regardless of those moments, the overall story line is as strong as the performances, certainly strong enough to make us wait eagerly for season two.",1463875200,3,2363,4.8575

5261604,4,B0094GWPOU,"This follows the amateur sleuthing of four extremely bright women who served together at the legendary (and very secret) Bletchley Park, part of the crack UK team deciphering German codes and messages in WWII.  Now its the early 50s, and these amazing women have largely been reduced to more typical womens roles of that era as dutiful wives and mothers, daughters in mainstream jobs, telling no one about their shared past.  Even the one with the richest most adventerous life, seems to feel a hole at its center.  They miss the excitement of Bletchley, but they also miss being taken seriously as people, and being able to use their great intelligence as part of something important.  So when one of the women finds clues in the pattern in newspaper stories about a serial killer that the police seem to be missing, the women begin to work together to find the killers identity, undeterred by the police not being all that interested in what they have to offer.

There are a few annoying logic lapses, especially near the climax.  And the characterization of the killer is far less original than that of the women, as are some of the more standard thriller cat and mouse dramatics.  But this is still a very nicely done piece of TV mystery, with a quietly feminist edge.",1457481600,,1272,4.702702702702703

5261607,5,B0094GWPOU,"Bletchley Park was a top-secret code-break office in World War II London. The office had a group of four women who worked well together--Susan could detect patterns, Lucy had a photographic memory, etc. After the war, they signed a secrecy act and went back to normal lives, which meant marriage and two children for Susan. She's not entirely satisfied as a housewife and begins to analyze the news reports about a killer who's abducted his fifth victim. All the victims were women abducted while traveling and found strangled to death in dark cellars. Susan has worked out a pattern to the crimes and has her husband pull a favor with the London police. She gives her deduction of where the latest victim's body has been left but is wrong. The police thank her and bemusedly send her on her way. Rather than let it go, she calls on her three friends from the Bletchley and they get to work. They treat the murders like a code that needs cracking. They gather data on the murders and the victims to find more patterns. They make a lot of headway but the police are interested in evidence, not theory. The police politely ignore their conclusions. The women take the investigation into their own hands. The closer they get to the killer, the more dangerous it becomes.

The plot is engaging and has enough credible twists to ratchet up the tension and accelerate the story. The frustration of the post-war women being moved back into ""women's positions"" and not being taken seriously in ""man's positions"" is obvious but not heavy-handed. The situation creates natural set-backs for the women, forcing them to risk their own safety. Believable tension is also found in the lives of the two women who are married.

5261609,5,B0094GWPOU,"Anna Maxwell Martin is exceptionally gifted and what an intelligent, lively ensemble of actresses.  Challenges the old-school boys' club of assumptions about mothers and women without being pedantic or heavy-handed--just clear, concise and results-oriented.  You don't have to be a costume-drama fan or a BBC/Downton-loving type to dig this mystery series.  If only there was more than 2 seasons--and more Maxwell in the 2nd season as well.

Post-war sex politics were a huge slap in the face to women who ran the homeland during the war years--women relegated to previous ill-fitting  roles were given a partial chance during the WW2 years to express talents and even genius only to be expected to return home by 1945.  This is not just a Rosie the Riveter or the Land Girls scenario but an intellectual death sentence to women who worked in ways a lot of us can't even imagine.  The story of a group of gifted women being strictly cut off and then patronized when resurfacing in service of solving a string of murders isn't hard to believe--and the actresses who inspire that sense of team-genius and believability make this series not just a ""costume drama"" or a run-of-the-mill BBC mystery series.  A very rewarding binge-watch.",1452988800,,1232,5.004901960784314

Set in the early 1950s postwar period when Britain was near its economic and international nadir, it is  bleak and, like the cinematography, nearly colorless. Finally, and this may just reflect my personal biases, I don't find most of the ""Bletchley girls"" very appealing characters. They are still bright, but they've become homebodies dominated by husbands or boyfriends.

I was hoping for something more like ""Inspector Morse"" or ""Lewis.""  This is not it.",1436400000,,511,5.132530120481928

5261706,5,B0094GWPOU,"I enjoyed this thoroughly, mainly because of the acting along with the characters and general premise.

  The acting is top-notch, especially that of Anna Maxwell Martin as Susan, the leader of a small group of former WWII code-breakers who regroup ten years later in order to catch a serial killer.  She does a superb job of conveying the frustration and sadness of a brilliantly intelligent woman who is trapped in the stultifying life of a 1950s British housewife.  The other lead actresses (Rachael Sterling, Julie Graham, and Sophie Rundle) are also very effective in delineating their very different characters.

  Using Bletchley Park (the site of the British code-breaking operations during WWII) as the backdrop for the story allows for both a fascinating mystery story as well as a powerful look at the dilemmas women had to face.  Their war experience had already established them as men's equals in intelligence and ability, but their post-war lives did not allow them to continue realizing their potential.  In fact, they had to keep their Bletchley lives secret, in effect masquerading as mere housewives and secretaries.  Thus, although the show is not reducible to a feminist message, it cleverly uses the mystery/thriller story as a way of depicting the tragic unfairness of such a sexist society.

  It's also refreshing to see a show about a group of women who, although they have their differences, seem to genuinely like and respect each other.  There is no scheming or backstabbing among them.  It's also nice to see a good British period drama that has nothing to do with who is going to marry whom and inherit titles or properties or blah blah blah.  (Perhaps the two qualities are related?)

  Thus, the show works on many levels and rewards repeat viewings.  The acting is engaging, the characters are a fascinating mix of personalities, the mystery/thriller story is suspenseful and exciting, and the feminist message is powerful (and still sadly relevant).  If you like intelligent women, England, mysteries, or any combination thereof, you can't go wrong with The Bletchley Circle.

(The second season is also quite good, by the way.  Alas, ITV has perversely chosen not to make a third season.)",1416009600,2,2224,5.0633608815427

5261729,5,B0094GWPOU,"1945, England in the midst of war. Bletchley Park manor has been taken over by the government and houses its Code & Cypher School. In one section, young women work code-busting. After one particularly fruitful day, two friends bed down in their dormitory-like room. Susan, skilled in pattern recognition, says, ""Not bad for a few ordinary girls.""
Millie, a map expert, chuckles, ""Ordinary girls! You couldn't be ordinary if you tried.""
Susan, ""When this is over, we'll have to be ordinary.""

Skip to 9 years later. Susan has fulfilled her prophecy. She is a housewife with a loving professional husband and two young children. She loves her family, but she can't turn off the puzzle-solving part of her brain. The radio announcer says that the police have found the body of a woman, apparently the 4th in a series of similar murders. As they give some details of the latest murder, Susan mutters to herself. Something is not right. This latest murder isn't fitting the pattern unconsciously made by the murderer.

Susan's attempt to alert the police to the mistake the murderer made amounts to nothing. No, it amounts to less than nothing, because her husband is embarrassed for her. What makes Susan such a great character is that she is confident in her abilities. When she knows that there is a pattern, she KNOWS it. She cannot let it go, because if they don't find the killer, more women will die. She enlists the help of three cohorts from her code-breaking days, and the Bletchley Circle is born.

""Cracking a Killer's Code"" is a mini-series, covering the investigation of one murderer over a total of 135 minutes. It originally aired in England in September, 2012, in 3 parts.

The single-disc DVD release has the 3 parts plus 1 DVD extra. English subtitles are available.

The single DVD extra is the 30 minute ""Interviews With Cast and Crew"". This was enjoyable, with commentators including Guy Burt (writer), Julie Graham (plays Jean), Jake Lushington (producer), Anna Maxwell Martin (plays Susan), Sophie Rundle (plays Lucy), Andy De Emmony (director), Rachel Stirling (plays Millie), John Pardue (director of photography), Anna Robbins (costume designer) and Nike Gunn (designer).
Lushington describes Bletchley Circle as ""mystery and social drama"". These intelligent woman got to flex their mental muscles during the war. Then the war ended and, as Stirling mentions, ""they went back to their domestic life and were't allowed to ... claim what was rightly their part in the victory."" What a Catch-22. If a former Bletchley ""girl"" should  apply for a job requiring ""manly"" skills such as math prowess, she isn't allowed to say, ""Give me a chance, I busted German codes during the war!"" because of the Official Secrets Act. But she isn't  taken seriously for any such job without experience, given her gender.

When watching the show, I had to keep reminding myself that it was set in the 1950's, because it didn't look like the sharp colorful 50's, it looked like more like the war-torn 40's. Robbins, the costume designer explains, ""In actual fact, the colors would have been brighter in the 50's. But I wanted to bring a kind of sepia tone, from the photographs I've got from Bletchley."" She also points out something that I didn't notice my first time viewing the show: To keep the idea of the show on mathematical patterns, Robbins deliberately eliminated floral patterns from the clothing. However, please see the interesting comment added to this review, by P.G. Croft. She lived through this time in England.

A fabulous, atmospheric, intelligent mystery. Very recommended.

How frustrating for them, because they are usually the smartest people in the room.  The women have excellent deductive skills, but are limited by the time they live in and the social mores of the day. They  solved this crime by using their excellent skills and training.  Once they showed the police up to be unimaginative, slow and plodding, they were forced to return to their homes and boring mundane jobs by a society unwilling to recognize their talents.  Excellent look into how many women could have taught the police how to really investigate, and yet they ended up as housewives and  clerks or secretary.

What I really enjoyed was seeing women in these roles of being masters at solving complicated puzzles, math, and total recall. Its nice for a change to see women in this more scientific bent.

5261779,4,B0094GWPOU,"I have only watched season 1.  This was a ""new"" idea in an almost exhausted genre--British murder mysteries.  I liked that the four leads were women.  Their characters struck me as reasonable and interesting if a bit predictable.  The four actresses were good even if the lead Susan Grey did strike me as particularly charismatic.  Just to be clear--a woman lead does not have to be  ""beautiful"" in a Hollywood sense, but if she is the lead character of a band of sisters, it would be helpful she had a little more ""force"" or ""power"" so that we understood why the sisters were following her into danger.  This may be a problem of the dialogue and plot, however, rather than the actress.

But this first season was more potential than actuality.  The pacing of the formulaic plot was doubtful and unnecessarily repetitive, and it was rife with stereotypes of men.  It should be rightly accused of being classist.  Did anyone have a doubt about who would prove to be the wife-beater?  Who the understanding husband?  Ever?",1400976000,,1020,4.7272727272727275

5261783,2,B0094GWPOU,"This story about some former female code breakers putting their analytic skills to work on a serial killer/rapist in London is done with considerable skill. However, it is extremely gruesome and graphic, not for the even mildly squeamish. The four women appear as understated British superheros. The males, husband, inspectors and cops, are portrayed as insensitive oafs. And then there is the rapist. This is a theme that I have heard too many times. I managed to get through the first segment because I was thinking of giving it to my wife who is is really into puzzles and murder mysteries, but this would nauseate her.

5261787,5,B0094GWPOU,"I am not typically a fan of mystery/intrigue/murder solving series, etc. but this series is set apart by the core story of how these women eventually ended up working together to solve crimes ten years after all had worked as code breakers for Bletchley Circle in London during World War II.

There is enough flashback in each episode to show the fascinating way that civilians like these women worked in an effort to expose and stop the enemy (Nazi Germany) by decoding their messages, to hook you right into the present day story (again, taking place ten years later). It also sublimely shows how difficult it is to go from saving lives and winning battles, to being an ""everyday woman"" in early 1950s England. As with all of those working in such missions in the war effort, they had to sign a silence/secrecy agreement so that one of the four women has never even been able to tell her husband what she did during the war, and, yet he knows his wife if keeping 'something' from him and eventually it puts a strain on their relationship.

The best part about this series is that it shows how smart women can be in both math and logistics and one of the youngest of the group has a photographic memory - which can be incredibly helpful but at times very difficult for her. It is also set apart from other similar type television genres by the unique way each woman is able to use her war experience at Bletchley to solve whatever mystery or case they are working on. This is a great series for older girls and young women to watch as it really demonstrates how knowledge and the courage to use it, can make such a difference in one's life.

I've gone on to watch season 2 and it is just as good but now hear that they are not renewing for season 3 and actually doing some letter writing and petition signing to get a third series produced - something I rarely would do but that's just how good this show is!",1399852800,,1909,4.402266288951841

5261789,4,B0094GWPOU,I saw part of this on PBS and really liked the story about women who used to break codes for the British Government and how they reunite to stop a killer.  I ended up buying the DVD because this is definitely a program that I will watch more than once.,1399852800,,252,4.04
5261790,4,B0094GWPOU,"The Brits have done quite well for themselves in the mystery genre. The writing is often top shelf as is the acting. As good as this outing is, I'm not quite as in love with it as most viewers appear to be.

Here's the scoop. There are 4 women working for the British military as code breakers during WWII. Each has a specific talent and they prove themselves to be very good at what they do. Now it is peacetime. Their lives are more mundane and they are prohibited from divulging the work they did during the war. They miss the sense of urgency and importance. One of the women, Susan, becomes intrigued by the apparent presence of a serial killer in London and figures she can solve the case. But she needs the help of her old mates to do so and it's off to the races.

I enjoyed this very much. I liked the period detail and the fact that they cast Anna Maxwell Martin in the role of Susan. She's a bit on the mousey side. In Hollywood they would have cast a glamor queen. The writing was uneven. Many of the plot points involving the detective work were quite clever. Other plot points, particularly those involving the girls' lives, were pedestrian. There was little there you haven't seen before, while other aspects of their lives needed fleshing out.

I don't want to take too much away from this. The basic idea is clever and the girls working the case felt true. The writer, Guy Burk, seems to have done his homework on code breaking. You can't make this stuff up. Overall, a nice effort. I hope they smooth out some of the rough edges in the second installment.",1399852800,,1573,4.38013698630137

Not enough information about the code breaking activities that took place in secret at Bletchley Park is given as introductory material here. It was at Bletchley park that Britain's most brilliant minds worked tirelessly to break the German 'Enigma' codes which were used by the Luftwaffe, The German Navy and Wermacht in WW 2.

5261816,5,B0094GWPOU,"Four former co-workers and code-breakers from Bletchley Park regroup after WWII, due to the efforts of Susan, the former team's expert on pattern analysis. After uncovering a hidden pattern in a stream of murders, Susan, played by Anna Maxwell Martin, initially attempts to crack the case by herself. She soon realizes her own limitations upon discovering the murder pattern to be far more complex and extensive than she had imagined and subsequently calls in her friends. Upon combining forces, they confirm the killer to be both extremly confident and an astute individual while at the same time armed with highly uncommon skills. What follows is a series of cascading events which all the time lead them closer to the mastermind while increasing their own exposure and mortal danger with each step they take.

One might compare this series to the fabulous Bletchley Park thriller of 2002, Enigma, staring Dougray Scott and Kate Winslet. However, Bletchley Circle is somewhat unique in its employment of WWII code breaking techniques to solve conventional crime, a detection technique that remained pretty much unused until modern re-deployment by today's military to locate terrorists. Consequently, the circa 1950s London Police involved in apprehending the murderer graduate from initial willing partners to bungling obstacles, because the National Secrecy Act prohibits the former Bletchley sleuths from divulging their advanced skill-sets.

Personally, I cannot recommend Season 1 of The Bletchley Circle too highly. With recent spikes in armed responses by today's police, the series' message of advancing intelligent detection techniques has never been more relevant. However, putting even that aside, The Bletchley Circle has jumped to the top of my television viewing list on just pure entertainment value. The writing, directing and editing is only topped by the amazing chemistry of its lead cast, which includes Anna Maxwell Martin, Rachael Stirling, Julie Graham and Sophie Rundle.

When they realize that their pattern recognition could be useful in detective work, they volunteer their expertise.  Of course, they are patronized and marginalized initially.

Nine years later, we find them living different lives.  It is not until Susan, played by Anna Maxwell Martin, now a housewife and mother, recognizes a pattern involving a series of murdered girls. She goes to the police, who think she is silly. Even her husband,mojo knows nothing about her past, tells her to stay out if complicated issues. So, she contacts her three friends, her boss, played by Julie Graham, Millie played by Rachel Stirling, and Lucy played by Sophie Rundle, to help investigate this mystery. They are a little reluctant to get involved, but she convinces them.

They meet condescending men at every turn, and soon appear to be in over their heads. Finding a dead body almost convinces them to stop the investigation, but instead it spurs them on. There are three episodes, and I was sad to see the series end, however, I understand series two will be here soon.

This was one of my favorite British series of the past year. Four strong woman proving their worth, and showing those condescending men how wrong they were!

Strong ensemble cast, set into a period of British recovery after WWII (yes, cliche, and if you're able to recognize that, then you know this is when cliches were formed and challenged), chasing down a killer using statistical math, old-fashioned legwork, and above all, their native intelligence and experiences as codebreakers at the eponymous Bletchley Park. Not only are all the leads well-developed, with believable perspectives and attitudes of the time, but the series has spared no expense in creating seamless sets, costumes, and events.

5261846,5,B0094GWPOU,"It has not been until recent years that the code of silence surrounding various groups and organizations that were at work during the Second World War has been lifted, allowing the next generation to learn just what their grandparents were up to whilst Hitler was on the rise. One such organization was located at Bletchley Park, the site of the United Kingdom's main decryption establishment, where various codes were cracked by a staff made up of 80% women. For decades after the end of the war they refused to divulge their secret work even to their nearest and dearest, and were altogether extraordinary women, who not only saved lives with their diligence but were also some of the world's first computer programmers.

If anything, they've long been overdue a television show that focuses on their bravery and intelligence.

So I must confess that I was initially rather disappointed that ""The Bletchley Circle"" is actually set nine years *after* the end of the war. I was under the impression that this was a show that focused on the lives of women during the war years and which explored their work at code-breaking.

But it soon becomes clear that these characters' work during the war forms the basis of the show and still makes up a significant part of their lives. In 1952 Susan Grey is happily married with two children, though she misses the days in which she felt important and able to make an impact on the war effort on a regular basis. Following news of a series of murders on the radio, she believes she's spotted a pattern in the way the killer is targeting his victims. After the police can find no leads she turns instead to her old comrades of Bletchley Park.

They are Millie, the vivacious but hard-done-by waitress, Jean, their former superior currently working as a librarian, and Lucy, a young wife with a photographic memory (which naturally comes in quite handy). Using their old contacts and some old-fashioned legwork, they put their minds together in order to catch the killer. No internet or databases for these women; they have to sit down for hours on end to trawl through information.

But as they get closer to discovering the killer's identity, he begins to take a vested interest in them as well.

""The Bletchley Circle"" is not only a riveting crime drama but a vivid portrait of life in the 1950s. Fashions, technology and attitudes are accurately rendered in order to really give you a sense of time and place. As you might imagine, the women come up against a fair amount of sexism over the course of their investigation, wherein various husbands, employers and police officers can be anything from condescending to bemused to annoyed at their antics. Yet none of them (apart from the killer of course) are grossly misogynistic, in fact some of them are deeply concerned for the safety of the women.

On that note, there are thousands of films, books and television shows out there that depict male protagonists investigating a killer or undertaking some other dangerous mission, only to have his female love interest plead on behalf of his family that it's too dangerous to go out and do whatever brave thing he has in mind. It's a real treat to get a gender-flipped version of that old trope, in which a woman is torn between her duty to her family and her desperate desire to catch a killer and reclaim a sense of self.

That goes for all the women, who are fantastic characters to spend time with: determined, vulnerable, diligent, fiercely intelligent and always lady-like. I'm looking forward to series two!",1395014400,,3555,4.778501628664495

To be fair, the male actors, as written, could not ""star"" in the same way, in their given roles.

Anna Maxwell Martin, as usual, is watchable --- her face lets us see her thinking and struggling with decisions, and her delivery is also very real.

Enjoy it.  I hope the second season plays well.  The special features were good: the production notes were interesting, as were the four actor interviews.  But the young-ish men who produced and directed the series seemed awkward/shy/anxious about 'WORKING WITH SO MANY WOMEN'.

This is an excellent 3 part PBS mystery series.

The story opens in 1943 at British Intelligence HQ Bletchley Park where a team of 4 women (Jean, Susan, Millie and Lucy) work together as code breakers against the Nazis. Then we fast forward to 1952 London with the unsolved murders of 4 women making news headlines. Susan is one of the former code breakers and she discerns a pattern in these crimes and invites her 3 old friends to help. They are so successful in discerning patterns that they find the body of a 5th missing victim.

They secretly continue on with their work and Susan and Lucy especially incur great personal danger as well as friction with their husbands because they cannot reveal what they are doing since their former work was classified Top Secret. Eventually they realize that the murderer had actually killed 12 women over the years and was clever enough to frame innocent men for many of those crimes. Suspense rises as the murderer realizes that they are closing in on him.

The performers were excellent and the well written script provides a great mystery puzzle and also a story of friendship and self-sacrifice in the face of danger to help others. It is also quite apparent that the 4 former code breakers loved their work but suffered because they could never reveal this to anyone due to national security constraints.

The Blu-ray video and audio quality is good, and the special features offered are Scene Selections and Interviews with the cast and crew.",1391558400,,1756,4.8172757475083055

5261875,5,B0094GWPOU,"A friend who saw this series wrote me: It has your name written all over it.  It does!  I loved those women.  I empathized with them.  I found their lives so familiar.  First of all, the idea that women are not intelligent was an undercurrent of the times.  When it was vital, they called these four women in to use their talents, then afterwards sent them home with a condescending pat on the back and an admonition not to tell anyone what they did.  When they tried to use their unique talents to prevent a killer from continuing his work, they were ignored.  And when they were finally vindicated, all they received was a lukewarm ""We should have listened to you.""",1390003200,,667,4.454545454545454
5261876,3,B0094GWPOU,"I had high expectations of this and was very disappointed.  The period sets are fantastic, as I supposed they would be.  But the story is dumbed down too much.  Things happen that are convenient, but mar the story line.  And the ending is so unbelievably bad that my mouth dropped.  This needed to be an hour longer so they could have done it right, showing more of the protagonists' thought processes, and of course, coming up with a much better ending.  Mysteries can be intriguing and intelligent, like Prime Suspect and Broadchurch or charming and silly like Murder She Wrote.

5261900,3,B0094GWPOU,"This series is based on a great idea but is marred by contemporary political correctness.  Nevertheless it combines two features which make it especially attractive.

First, it is a period piece which takes place in England in 1952 just after World War II.  This is pleasing for those of us who remember the 1950s before places like England became multicultural paradises.

Second, it employs a very interesting plot where four women who were codebreakers during the war try to identify a serial killer who is leaving a pattern as he commits murders around London.  This would be an excellent series if it concentrated on the intellectual task of finding the killer instead of political propaganda.

The first episode emphasizes the humdrum peacetime lives of the women as if the men weren't in the same situation.  The main character is Susan and her husband  has a bureaucratic government job which is worse than anything the women face.  In fact the women have it better since they have time to pursue the killer instead of the daily grind of a regular job.  Moreover, the husband is the real victim as he has a war injury severe enough to require him to limp with a cane.

In the second episode the women begin suspecting that the killer must also be an ex-espionage agent because he is so good at hiding his tracts. This episode is marred by a completely gratuitous scene where one of the women (who are sworn to secrecy) is beaten by her husband who doesn't understand what she is up to.  This story was undoubtedly made by writers who were not alive in 1952 trying to foist today's political propaganda on that era.  Anyone who remembers the 1950s knows this scene is rubbish.  It is more appropriate in today's culture, especially with its African, Muslim, and Hispanic immigrants on both sides of the Atlantic.

The third episode descends into excessive melodrama as the women believe they have identified the killer who is a former agent.  He had received treatment at a mental facility after the war and Susan arranges to go to its office at night to talk to an administrator.  While talking to him she realizes that he is the killer but unlike a real serial killer he lets her go to keep the game going.  It turns out that he has been leaving clues directing her to him because he is intrigued by her abilities.

When Susan tries to contact the home of his former girlfriend he answers the phone and tells her where to meet him.  She goes alone with a revolver but doesn't tell the others.  He has already set up a scheme to foil any attempt to kill or capture him.  Susan finds him and the denouement follows.",1387238400,,2622,4.617710583153348

5261919,5,B0094GWPOU,another great britsh program that is full of twists and turns plus thrills and frights.  i like the emphasis on how women played such a great part in bletchley and behind the scenes of WWII but didn't get a whole lot of credit for their intellegence and dedicated service to their country and ours.,1384214400,,298,4.518518518518518

5261924,4,B0094GWPOU,"This was an interesting, atmospheric story with good writing and sympathetic, interesting characters.  The gimmick in the story is that the women were all code breakers during WWII at Bletchley Park, Britain's code breaking center, and use their skills, particularly in the interpretation of data and patterns to discover a killer at work and to find the killer.  Unfortunately, the detection of the killer is somewhat glossed over - so although the series is based on data analysis skills in uncovering and solving crime, the analysis is pretty much a black box of mystery as far as this mystery goes.",1383523200,,602,5.01
5261925,5,B0094GWPOU,"I enjoyed the background of this show. What DID happen to all the women of Bletchley Park? How much harder for them to hide who they were after the war.

5261932,5,B0094GWPOU,"Bletchly Circle holds you in suspense via the Master, Hitchcock. The premise of WW 11 Codebreakers becoming a team of post war crime solvers is brilliant.  The depiction of the
Bletchley team makes it clear that contemporary cultural values have reached the point of
presenting women with as full a range of qualities, deficiences, and questionable bearings as
men.  Compare the Bletchly women with Ms Pierce (Foyle' War 7).  Need a Bletchly Circle 2.",1382313600,,451,5.0675675675675675
5261933,5,B0094GWPOU,"This is a story of four amazing and normal women who are hidden heroes of British society.

During WWII, these women decrypted ciphered messages and tracked Nazi troop movements for the Allies, at Bletchley Park.  Their contributions remain classified and secret.  The husbands and boyfriends, and everyone else, were completely unaware of the secret achievements by these talented ""clerical"" workers.

Unfortunately, after the war, their lives become ordinary, as these women take a backseat within post-war British society.  These amazing women languish as ordinary women.  Like many, their special talents go unrecognized and unused.

The women re-unite to solve a serial crime involving the murders of multiple younger women.  The Bletchley Circle reduces the complexity and decodes the problem, which happens piece by piece.  The group overcomes the stigma of London society, such as police and their male companions, and work toward a solution which stops the slaying of innocent women surrounding a railway yard.

The believable portrayal involves who we are, what we observe, stigmas and obstacles, and the hidden enemies and heroes of British society.  While situations change, the descriptions of human struggle within modern society are timeless.

5261938,5,B0094GWPOU,"Thank goodness for BBC America. American television needs to take note and make more superb mini-series. If you like Sherlock or Broadchurch, you'll like Bletchley Circle. Can't wait for the series 2.",1381536000,,200,5.28125
5261939,5,B0094GWPOU,I received exactly what other reviewers had stated. Thank you to all those customers that wrote such excellent unbiased reviews! This was a great purchase.,1381536000,,155,5.24

5261943,5,B0094GWPOU,"I love English movies. This one was an extremely good one.. The acting of the four woman was great all the way throughout. It's
1hr:35 minutes long. Very interesting movie. However the ending of catching the seriel killer was a little weak. But the story of these
women was facinating.",1381104000,,285,4.72
5261944,5,B0094GWPOU,Loved this little mini series!!  The actors were brilliant and I'm sad that it's not a regular series but hoping for more.,1381104000,,122,4.545454545454546

5261946,4,B0094GWPOU,"Being a baby boomer, WWII was still very present when I was growing up--TV, movies, and for my parents. I still very much enjoy good stories from that era and this is one of them. Although it takes place after the war, the experiences these four women had together during the war is the springboard that inspires them to solve the series of murders where young women are the victims. The characters are engaging and the cultural milieu of British society following two wars is sympathetically viewed as women start to make a place for themselves in the economic and political landscape. The story stays very focused. I guessed the ending before it happened, though, and the production values are not quite up to US standards. But I do enjoy the subtlety and underplayed emotion that characterizes so much British TV.",1380758400,,816,4.794326241134752
5261947,5,B0094GWPOU,"This was recommended by a Brit friend.  The premise of the story is engaging, the characters/actors are believable and the subject matter is blunt.  Very well done.",1380758400,,164,5.037037037037037
5261948,4,B0094GWPOU,"Written like a documentary. Entertaining. Not the best acting, but it almost made it seem more real. I would recommend to the casual history buff.",1380672000,,146,4.88

5261950,5,B0094GWPOU,"A wonderful tribute and recognition of the women of Bletchley: intelligent, quick-witted, and yet discarded after WWII. So the women look for ways to emply their intelligence: in this case solving a case of serial murders. And they are brilliant!",1380672000,3,246,5.175

5261952,5,B0094GWPOU,"Well written mystery set in post-war London.  The protagonists are four intelligent women, ex-Bletchley clerks, who have been changed by the experience of working there, and who cannot reconcile themselves to playing the roles they are expected to play at home and at large.  A suspicious murder provides them the opportunity to put apply their various and considerable intellectual talents to tracking down the murder.",1380240000,,419,5.430769230769231
5261953,5,B0094GWPOU,I truly enjoyed these DVD's. They showed intelligent women trying to cope with the fifties when men ASSumed they weren't good for anything and could do nothing. I would not return to the fifties for anything. I thank God that I came of age just as women's awareness was coming about.,1380153600,,283,4.568627450980392

5261959,5,B0094GWPOU,"The Bletchley Circle (Season 1) is a beautifully crafted, British thriller.  Set in the years following WWII, the story focuses on Susan and three other members of a codebreaking team at Bletchley Park.  All four women have settled uneasily into life following the War and Susan, in particular, is stifled intellectually as a wife and mother with no meaningful occupation for her brilliant mind.  When a woman she knows is murdered, and it appears the police aren't going to find the killer, Susan recruits her former Bletchley colleagues to help her do what the police seemingly can't.  The four women search for the killer with the same determination and intellect they applied to breaking German codes during the war. Season 1 is short--only three episodes which, combined, are about as long as a feature film--but it is definitely worth watching.  Loved it!",1379894400,,861,5.035211267605634
5261960,5,B0094GWPOU,"I never knew that during the war many women were drafted in a sense to work for the government and break codes, etc. This is a great twist on women becoming the stronger theorists behind the police. Lots of twists.",1379721600,,214,4.375
5261961,5,B0094GWPOU,My friend recommended that I buy this and I'm glad she did because I really enjoyed this mini-series and had missed it when it was televised.,1379635200,,141,4.461538461538462
5261962,5,B0094GWPOU,The historical detail and engaging characters make this series great.  After episode 1 aired I couldn't wait so purchased the next one.  I look forward to more.,1379548800,,160,4.888888888888889
5261963,5,B0094GWPOU,"This series was so captivating.  The crime and how the girls solved it was an absorbing piece of storytelling, but the social issues surrounding the roles available for women in post-war England were clever supporting players for the drama.  I loved the cast, the pacing, and the cleverness of this series.  I hope there are more episodes coming!",1379548800,,346,4.931034482758621
5261964,5,B0094GWPOU,"This is an intelligent and beautiful exploration of women having to return to pre-war roles after playing an important part in the effort to help Britain win the war. The women who worked at Bletchley Park were working in a strictly classified capacity, and were unable to tell anyone about their duties during the war. Once the war was over, they had to return to traditional women's roles. The four women at the heart of this show find a way to continue to be of service and keep their minds sharp. Everything about this show worked for me - the costuming, the sets, the acting, the direction, the story and the concept.",1379548800,,622,4.5625

5261966,3,B0094GWPOU,"At the conclusion of WWII, a group of four women accustomed to vital tasks of gathering intelligence and deciphering German army messages during WWII are sidelined, trapped in boring careers and marriages that seem less than fulfilling.  They reconnect in an effort to identify a serial killer, using their unique skills as code breakers and their wartime connections to network with those who can supply pieces of the puzzle.  However, when the heroine, who carries a revolver, finally confronts the serial killer she screams and sobs in terror and allows him to disarm her because she is inexplicably unable to shoot him.  How ludicrous!  Instead of strong women, it seems that most of them (other than one with a strong Scottish accent) are whiny and wimpy.  However, the initial suspense and period recreations of post-war Britain are excellent.  Save your money.",1379289600,2,867,5.113475177304965
5261967,5,B0094GWPOU,"I did not know there was such a group during the war.  Women played a big part in that war, and as usual are the unsung heroes...Great show.",1379203200,,140,4.0

5261969,3,B0094GWPOU,"The code breaking concept was good, but I could not stand Susan, the unbelievable main character, who is a brilliant code breaker that goes to pieces and resembles a mental patient whose tongue has been cut out every time she has to speak to a man, even her husband.  I wanted to scream every time her mouth started moving in every direction and her face contorted, but no words came out.  Yet, in other parts of the three-part series, she is articulate with her female counterparts.  And, when will British shows have good audio - I had to turn captioning on several times and go back to figure out what was being said.  Usually British shows have so much music playing over the dialog one can't hear, however, I didn't find that music was mucking up the dialog, just the characters racing through their lines, making them incoherent.",1379116800,8,835,4.621621621621622

5261996,5,B0094GWPOU,"Four women work at Bletchley during WW II.  What they contribute to the war effort makes a difference.

Flash forward.  Now it's the early 1950's.  All four have returned to their former - or other occupations.

Martin's character, who had planned on traveling to see the world, has married, has two children, a husband, a  home.
Unfortunately, he has a very limited view of her intelligence.  He thinks 'puzzle' books will keep her occupied.

In reading about a series of crimes in the newspaper, she becomes convinced the crimes are related, the work of a serial killer.

She struggles to get her viewpoint across to men who do not listen, who dismiss her because she is a woman.

Martin brilliantly UNDERPLAYS her character.  A very quiet, steady performance, connects us with her intelligence, with the diligence
of all four women.

Just WELL PLAYED.

This was a great deal of fun to watch.  Good writing to begin with.  Anna Maxwell Martin is superb.  Supporting cast is excellent.",1376956800,,986,4.849397590361446

5262000,3,B0094GWPOU,"I thought this was an entertaining if short series, particularly the first two episodes, with a talented cast, but it wasn't at all as smart as some have characterized it to be.  If you strip away the PBS overtones, the period costumes, and the British accents that seem to cloud Americans' judgment, you are left with a story that makes absolutely no sense.  You have a group of women who are supposed to be incredibly smart doing incredibly stupid things.  This should be a story of women's empowerment, but that motif is completely undermined by how foolishly the women act.

Putting aside the insane risks the women take and their contamination of a crime scene, Susan's interaction with police is totally implausible, and does not represent how an intelligent person would handle such a situation.  We're supposed to sympathize with her because she is dismissed, largely due to her gender, but she goes to the police prematurely, and then contradicts her original theory.  She never has any actual evidence, nor does she explain herself well.  But we're supposed to think the police were wrong to not take her word as gospel.  Finally, in the third episode, she doesn't go to the police at a time that absolutely necessitates their involvement.  And yet everything ends up with the police admitting they were wrong, and overlooking her outrageously poor judgment.  I also thought it was funny how the police could figure out in 10 seconds what her wartime job had been, but her husband of several years (a veteran) was oblivious.  Susan's character was so contradictory that she just got on my nerves.  I wish the writers had stopped telling me that she was brilliant, and had done a better job of showing me that she was.

Additionally, whereas a truly smart show would have the viewers involved in trying to figure out the mystery themselves (see ""Lost""), here everything was conclusory.  There's a difference between a smart mystery, and a mystery which is solved by (supposedly) smart people.  This is definitely only the latter.",1376611200,18,2038,4.900874635568513
5262001,5,B0094GWPOU,Missed the last two episodes and could not fine a rerun so when I saw it on the internet I was thrilled. The series showed how valued women were in was time and then quickly forgotten after the war. More so in England than the USA.,1376611200,,231,4.043478260869565

5262006,5,B0094GWPOU,"This British thriller is  based on a very interesting premise- that a serial killer might leave a 'pattern' which someone skilled in breaking codes could follow and thus anticipate what the next step will be. The author (by the way, the series was written, produced, directed and filmed by men) chose as his detectives four women who were code breakers during WW2. Each brings different skills to bear on the solving of the crimes.

The acting is excellent and the period (1952) feel of post-war Britain is wonderfully captured. The plot requires one or two leaps of faith, but the tension is maintained throughout. The method of solving the crimes is entirely believable (it actually bears a fairly close resemblance to the first 'Prime Suspect'), but the idea of using trained code-breakers was new to me and is brilliant.

This purchase served its purpose.  We enjoyed the series, but the plot, characters, and story line were not as good as Foyles War, The Island War, or Downton Abby.

The women here did years of code breaking in WWII in London, saving many lives by knowing what the Germans were up to before they did it and alerted armed forces to avoid loss of life. After the war these women were sworn to secrecy and had to go back to humdrum lives and got no mention or credit for their heroic actions....very frustrating. A serial killer catches the attention of this group and they start tracking him in ways most of us would never think of...and they are not successful at first as women keep disappearing. They rethink what the pattern means and get it right...it is fascinating watching how math and patterns and probability all work to catch this monster....very clever against the male bastions of Scotland Yard..LOVED it.

Post WII, the women (who supposedly only worked as secretaries and clerks) from Bletchley Park find themselves mired in boredom and/or irrelevance after the heady atmosphere and solid achievements from their war work.  One such alumnus finds herself searching for meaningful intellectual stimulation outside child rearing and crossword puzzles and turns to following police reports in the news.

When a pattern emerges, she and her husband bring it to the authorities, who recognize her talents but fail to carry through.  Stymied by the establishment, Susan turns to her former code-breakers to help her unravel the mystery and bring a killer to justice, a turn which has unseen repercussions for the whole Bletchley Circle.",1373068800,,946,5.231788079470198

Stupider!  it was so refreshing to watch a group of  intelligent, brave, touching, daring women resist the conventional wisdom, their elders, their 'betters', and solve a puzzle/crime without racing through with loud dramatic music to tell us how to feel about it, and giving us a chance to get to know these oh,so interesting characters.
It was so insightful as to how women (and working-middle/class society) was in the 1940's and 50's in Britain after the War, when their use was no longer valued, except as housewives and cheap help.  Even the government had no use for their remarkable talents and simply discarded them.  (Same as in the USA: see season 1 of 'Mad Men'.
Even if the crime solvers had been men in this production, it was still a great murder mystery story.  But I'm so glad it was these wonderfully smart and unassuming women. I wonder if any of them was ever given a medal for valuable services rendered?  {Probably not.  Couldn't take a chance on having it go to their heads).

Characterisation was well done, context was excellent, as in the right clothes, furniture, food for the era.  The relationship between husband and wife (the main character) was particularly well done, with the wife's role carved out very clearly and the husband's reluctant acceptance of her interest in the murders.

Their appearance, especially in the long winter coats, with hand-bags clutched tightly and hats carried perfectly, took me on a long trip down memory lane (I was about 12 years old at the time of the story).  It was all so true to the period: ration books, steam trains, the little grocery stores, and not many cars moving.  The story line sucked me right in: disbelief was emphatically suspended.

Creating some of the scenes was clearly a struggle occasionally.  The double green-screen with actors against a computer-graphic train arrivals and departures board, then overlaid on archive footage of steam trains inside the station, was a brave effort, but didn't quite work.  Don't get me wrong: that's a minor quibble.  Hunting down the outdoor shooting locations must have been a serious challenge: my congratulations to all the production crew.",1372377600,,935,5.152317880794702
5262074,4,B0094GWPOU,"I really enjoyed this short series.  The writing was tight and the female characters were interesting, especially in how the show portrayed their interactions and support of each other.

Four women have grown apart since the war ended, when one of them gets interested in the murder of a woman.  She uses her mental skills in connecting the dots to realize that there is a serial killer on the loose and that the police have no clues.  She tries to approach them and you then discover that, despite her rather mousy little life as a 1950s housewife, that she used to work in a top secret position during the War and broke code.  Even her husband knows nothing about it.  She then hooks up with her other former-friends who were part of the secret codebreaking and they use their skills and talents to uncover the murderer.

The dissonance between what these women did and the lives they were leading after the war was fascinating.  It really highlighted the times and how they felt they had no choice but to hide who they were and what they could do in order to fit in.  The relationships between the four women is wonderful to watch, including how they support each other and how their talents mesh.

Great show.  A bit chilling at times, so not really for younger viewers.  I'd definitely watch it again, even if I now know the ending.",1372377600,,1337,4.548117154811716

5262084,3,B0094GWPOU,"I watched this on the recommendation of my sister, who thought it was great.  I was intrigued by the premise -- four smart women whose brains had contributed to the winning of World War II come together to solve a series of murders nine years later.  The initial episode met my hopes -- the story is good, the acting is great, the characters are fascinating.  But as I continued watching, I kept bumping up against situations that seemed unlikely or strained.

How has someone as intelligent as Susan convinced her husband of many years that she has no more brains than a cat?  That her interests and talents run only to housework and solving brain teasers or crosswords?  Did he never ask her ""what did you do in the war?""  How can she justify showing more loyalty to her government than to her spouse, to whom she's apparently been lying since day one?  Maybe the dedication to the letter of the Official Secrets Act was true to the period.  Maybe this is my American, self-reliant, post-Watergate persona projecting on a period and place that took for granted a more buttoned-up and tight-lipped populace.  But it just rings false to me.  (And I was born in in 1952, so I'm not that far removed.)

Susan is the group's spokesperson when they try to interest the police in their investigations, and does a horrible job at it -- again and again.  Is it really possible that someone so intelligent can be so persistently inarticulate in explaining her research and conclusions to authority?  And this after (in the introductory scenes) she's been able to convince Britain's top war leaders that she's decoded important evidence of WWII troop movements?

Why in the world would Susan elect to confront the killer alone, when she has several people she can rely on to back her up -- and who do, in fact, save her life despite her idiocy?  Susan is such a sack of contradictions that I wanted to yell at her through the TV.

And at the end, when the killer has himself been killed by the group of women, everything is suddenly OK?  Miraculously, the police, who have rejected the women's theories throughout the series due to a lack of any evidence, now need nothing but their own accounts of what happened and why?  There's still no evidence of ANYTHING.  Yet the chief inspector who has patted Susan on the head and told her to run along and play now says ""I should have listened to you.""  WHY???  It's just too rushed and neat and contrary to everything the rest of the series has built.

Not to mention the irritation of yet again encountering the ""something happened to him, now he's crazy, so he's a killer"" paradigm which so dominates British mysteries.

Bottom line -- it just didn't gel for me.  Too many discordant elements, too many unanswered questions, both from the mystery side and the social issues side.",1371945600,12,2817,4.642424242424243
5262085,4,B0094GWPOU,"Well acted, tense direction, and authentic settings - both the look and feel, and the male-female dynamic of the post war period.  Great story line unfolds as the protagonists are conflicted with the thrill of achievement set against the progressive horror of the events.  Some reviewers have criticized the lack of a Bletchley tie-in, but to me it feels authentic - the place was staffed with all sorts of people with very distinct skills and traits, and they were not allowed to talk about it afterwards.  I forgive the opening scene as a dramatic device to establish quickly who the protagonists are and what they did - not likely to have happened that way in real life as the institution was highly compartmentalized with few people knowing the end-to-end details.",1371945600,,768,4.892307692307693

5262099,2,B0094GWPOU,"This series sounded so promising. The premise is terrific. But it needed more than three episodes to fully explore the crimes and their solutions. The third episode felt very rushed to solve everything. And the illogic of some of the action was distracting. Why would Susan(I think that's the lead character) for alone to the final meeting with the killer? It made no sense. I missed the complete solution and especially two scenes which should have been incorporated into the series. One would have been a scene with the Chief Inspector who resisted the efforts of the women to solve a crime he thought had been already solved. His bried ""I should have listened"" at the end was not enough to satisfy me. And I longed for a scene with Susan and her husband where she finally tells him the truth about her service during the war and and her sloving of these crimes. I had a feeling the perhaps that scene was recorded and then editied out in the interests of time. Finally I found some of the dialogue very difficult to understand. I studied in England for a year and had no trouble understanding actors on stage there. But on TV is is getting very hard to understand some of the actors. Michael Kitchen is always crystal clear as are most British actors. But on this series I had many problems. Sorry it wasn't as good as it could have been.

well-acted, but the initial crimes are brutal and depict women who have been murdered and then raped after
they are murdered.  This is the stuff of low-budget horror films, not PBS entertainment (with a few exceptions,
such as the Helen Mirren series).  Perhaps future episodes change direction, but I can't help but shudder at

Although retiring from being cryptographers was not that common for women in this period, it is only an extreme version of a general problem where women who had been confident and independent career women during the war found themselves pushed aside and shoved back in the kitchen as society claimed they had to make room for soldiers returning home.

If that's not enough, the program gives a glimpse of the roots of profiling and the use of logic and math in criminology. As an avid viewer of NUMB3RS and Criminal Minds, this was the icing on the cake that made this show stand out from others.

5262138,4,B0094GWPOU,"I had just finished watching the film ""Enigma"" which I liked and wanted to find more info on Bletchley Park and the code breakers. In my search I came across ""The Bletchley Circle"" a british mini series which I ordered hoping to learn more  on the amazing code breakers during ww2 . In fact the first segment was about 4 women doing very secretive ,highly classified work at the Bletchley facility. Their work actually predicted through code breaking an invasion taking place in 3 days. Heros all.
9 years pass and one of the code breakers is following an article in the papers about at least 5 women  brutily tortured and murdered. She decides to solve the murders by using her unique skills in problem solving. She also realizes she will need help. This is where the 3 other women from the Bletchley Park days each having a unique talent necessary in the solving of these crimes. End of part 2.
The last part of the series reveals more of these womens peronalities , skills and personal lives. They tackle the case ,identify possible suspects and bring this info to Scotland yard. There they are met with resistance and can not reveal why their conclusion s are accurate. They are sworn to secrecy about their past jobs  (war secret act) and their skills .
It is left to these four very special women to solve the case on their own.
The final solution is very creepy.
This is a mini series which really shows the differences between American tv and British tv. I leave that for you to discover.
I enjoyed this short mini series even though I was hoping for more on the code breakers than 4 women forced to use their skills as modern day dectectives.",1370131200,,1651,4.533557046979865

The stories are deep and intricate and hold one's interest well. The only complaint is that the characters do some things nobody in real life would do, such as the main character going alone to a known killer's location without telling the people she knows she can trust (the other women of the circle) just because he says he will hurt her children.

5262152,5,B0094GWPOU,"I have always been drawn toward British period pieces, even of World War II.  This drama takes us down a path that we have rarely seen in a British period drama series and that is a classic, who done it, serial murder based several years after World War II. Each engaging character brings a different perspective to helping to solve a serial murder that Scotland Yard is totally stumped on.

One woman has a photographic memory, another is good with math tables, another with codes and patterns and another with detective skills and the ability to get her four companions from the infamous Bletchley Park Code breakers of WW 2.

The acting is superb and terribly exciting and the clothing and period props are all very authentic and real to the times in question. I just started watching this after getting myself hooked on another BBC series, ""Orphan Black,"" and here I go again with another weekly, I have to watch, BBC series. Thank goodness they are only $1.99 each or I should go broke with all the BBC shows I watch, including these new ones.

I cannot wait to watch the next few episodes, since I only stumbled upon this after watching another BBC show.
Definitely worth your time in looking into this drama with its spooky twists and turns. I just love the Brit's... don't you? =)

Despite the overwhelming ""Don't worry your pretty little head over this"" attitude, these four women unmask a serial killer the police are unwilling/unable to.  Fair warning: this is NOT a polite English murder mystery.  Sometimes my skin crawled but it was always fascinating as the trail led to the killer.  Late in Part III, one of the women pulls out a well-worn copy of Principles of Mathematics by Bertrand Russell.

There are some scenes that they show over-and-over (e.g. a man who shoots himself in the head, etc.) and other scenes that they prolong the view, longer than I feel is necessary.

5262201,3,B0094GWPOU,"First two episodes were great. The tightness of the script begins to unwind at episode three. The conflict among the women about whether or not to proceed with the investigation is resolved too quickly; their removal of evidence from a crime scene is brushed over; and Susan's decision to go alone to the killer is not believable. Certainly she's brave, not to mention intelligent, but this move was too reckless for a Bletchley woman. It was as if the writer had to squeeze a story that warranted 4 episodes into 3.  Nonetheless, the acting is fabulous. Anna Martin and Sophie Rundel are extraordinary and the other cast members not far behind. The premise of the series is A+. I look forward to more and hope writer Guy Burt can keep a more even course.",1368403200,23,755,4.634328358208955
5262202,5,B0094GWPOU,"I watched the series with utter fascination & appreciation for the BBC to remember the silent work force at Bletchley Park. Over 85% were women, but mostly in jobs requiring unnerving patience, manipulating fierce amounts of intense detail, and burdened with the knowledge their work meant lives. Working in cramped quarters, unrelenting laborous hours far beyond their required 40 hours because their work formed the basis for the decoders. It was their extreme dedication every day that ensured reliable information from the Turing/Welchman machines.

My wife noticed the recordings on our dvr; so we watched them together. During my second viewing I realized details missed previously. Although the logic employed was uneven, at several key moments, it was the group solving unique layers of information that I found most satisfying. My wife and I felt the characters on a personal level; we look forward to more episodes and further explanation re each character. We give Two Thumbs UP! More, we want more...",1368403200,,1012,5.246913580246914

5262204,5,B0094GWPOU,"The premise of ""Bletchley Circle"" is intriguing. Four women used to work as codebreakers back during WW II in Bletchley Park. Fast forward to the year 1952 - it has been several years since the war ended, and the four women have lost contact with each other. One in particular, Susan Gray (Anna Maxwell Martin who played the role of Bessie Higgins in North & South, Esther Summerson in Episode 1, and Sarah Burton in South Riding) is leading a rather quiet life with her husband (who has no inkling of her real job during the war) and her two young children. Susan is a highly intelligent woman and is obviously looking for something to do other than childminding and housekeeping. When a series of murders take place, all involving young women, Susan thinks she may be able to help the police in their investigations. Unfortunately, her attempt to help does not yield anything, and her husband, upset at his wife's apparent interest in the case, forbids her to pursue it. Susan then decides that she might stand a better chance at solving the murders if she could get her code-breaking colleagues back together again, and so the Bletchley Circle is born.

The other women in the circle are Millie (Rachael Stirling), Lucy (Sophie Rundle), and Jean (Julie Graham) and though initially skeptical and reluctant to get involved, another murder acts as the catalyst that brings the women back together. The show is engaging on many levels. The period details are credibly done and brings post-war England to life. Little things like the rationing of food in 1952 (food rationing continued till 1954) is well-depicted in the show and many more (such as fashion) that transport the viewer into the past. The four women make an interesting group of crime solvers. Each individual has a strength that lends itself to puzzling out the case. The dialogue and manner of interaction is also well depicted and I enjoyed the attention to details in each scene.

The women's journey towards solving the case takes them into dark and menacing places and the show perfectly captures all the finer nuances of a good procedural. I would advise viewers who can be a little patient to wait till all three episodes are screened and then watch them back to back since I thought the story flowed better that way, instead of being chopped up, but certainly it can be enjoyed either way. The total running time on the DVD is 150 minutes.

There are only three episodes in this series, but I hope to see more of Susan and company, perhaps solving another crime in the near future? This is a well made period crime drama that should appeal to fans of crime dramas and period productions.",1368316800,6,2659,4.7386609071274295

5262228,4,B0094GWPOU,"""The Bletchley Circle"" is a period mystery that capitalizes on the intrigue surrounding codebreaking during World War II and the social upheavals that followed the War. In 1952, Susan Gray (Anna Maxwell Martin) is a comfortable middle-class London housewife. Increasingly bored with housework and knitting, Susan has been following a series of murders that she believes exhibit a pattern. A serial killer is murdering young women in darkened rooms underground. Susan presents her theory to Deputy Commissioner Wainwright (Michael Gould) of the London police but is disappointed to find her predictions wrong. Undeterred, she asks Millie (Rachael Sterling), an old colleague from her war years at Bletchley Park, to help. Millie thinks they need more data and more help, so they enlist two other former colleagues: Jean (Julie Graham), a research librarian, and Lucy (Sophie Rundle), who possesses an eidetic memory, to track down the killer before he kills again.

This is a female twist on a ""getting the gang back together"" after the war plot. Instead of being soldiers, these four women worked at the famous Bletchley Park HQ, where British cryptanalysts cracked the German Enigma cipher. The movie opens with a brief scene of the women working together at Bletchley Park. Although women did outnumber men by a considerable margin at Bletchley Park, there were very few female cryptanalysts, and it's never clear to me exactly what job the movie is assigning these women. They rely on their wartime skills to understand the murderer and predict his actions. This mostly has to do with mathematical data analysis. They are successful, because this serial killer is far more methodical than most. The pressure on the women is increased by the overzealous Official Secrets Act that forbade them from even mentioning where they worked during the War. As a result, Susan can't show her husband that she's not a dunce.

The serial killer is in the pervert mold that has become a staple of British murder mysteries. Nothing interesting or believable there. The period sets, costumes, manners, and lovely photography do a great deal to make ""The Bletchley Circle"" enjoyable, though. London is always dreary and evenly lit. Indoor lighting is a mixture of daylight and tungsten, which produces a dull, soothing shade. Much has been made of the feminine character of this miniseries and the women's struggle to be taken seriously by authorities. But, as they couldn't say anything about their qualifications, and Susan's initial hunches were wrong, I can't say that the police acted any differently than they would now or than they would toward men. To me, the feature that sets ""The Bletchley Circle"" apart from most television mysteries being made today is that the detectives are not neurotic. Most TV detectives are more dysfunctional than the criminals. This is a welcome departure.",1367971200,3,2880,5.1781115879828326
5262229,4,B0094GWPOU,"Awesome. Enjoyed this thoroughly. Disappointed it was only 3 episodes. Oh those British shows. Great writing, acting, sets costumes, etc",1367884800,,136,5.85

The four women who star in the production are all wonderful.  Their relationships add a complexity to the show that makes it all the more engaging, in addition to the fact that each of their characters is compelling on their own.  And then there is the story related to solving the murders - it is both creepy and thrilling.  There have been a number of scenes when my heart was racing and my palms got sweaty!

All in all, both my husband and I highly recommend this series!",1367712000,,632,4.548672566371682
5262233,5,B0094GWPOU,"I really enjoyed this program, which depicts the use of crime analysis in investigating crimes.  It also depicts a first--that of women entering the role of crime investigations.  The women characters were not police officers.  They had served the government during World War II as civilian analysts who used data to aid the military effort and to project the enemy's movements, etc.  After the war, the women remained friends and, together, decided to use their expertise to try to aid the police in solving a series of murders.  This 1950's series demonstrates the women's expertise and the difficulty they encounter in being considered credible by the male police investigators whom they attempt to assist. I've only seen two episodes so far and very much look forward to the next ones.  On a side note, because the first episode no longer was available on line free, I turned to Amazon.  I was not sorry, as it was so much simpler to use Amazon's service than the free one from the broadcast company.

They film late at night and when it was cloudy out . The muted outfits go with the characters individual personalities and the mood of the show. They just don't deal with mystery going on , they deal with England getting back on his feet after the war and each woman gets a nice backstory of their own as well.",1367193600,9,689,4.348837209302325
5262248,5,B0094GWPOU,"This is a compelling story set in the drab yet still appealing venue of post-war London. It's a mystery but doesn't feel like a formulaic one. Great for details--interiors, clothing.  I highly recommend.",1367107200,,203,5.151515151515151
5262249,5,B0094GWPOU,"As a ""Downton Abbey"" and cozy mystery fan, this fabulous, little 3-episode mini-series was such a joy to discover! Great writing, acting and direction as I've come to expect from British TV, but I was surprised at how well-balanced ""Bletchley Circle"" was in addressing the sexism and inner pathos of these brilliant women living ""diminished"" post-war lives while still keeping the development of the mystery plot front-and-center and moving at an engaging pace. In other words, the story gives you a good understanding of the characters' situations/frustrations without ever getting bogged down by it, thus enhancing an already fascinating and really solidly built mystery story.

As for the ladies themselves, they're a great, interesting mix--Susan, the brilliant but somewhat socially inept savant; Millie, our bold, street-smart, world-traveling feminist and ""woman of action;"" matronly Jean, the ultimate organizer/leader and apparently the best-connected librarian in London; and sweet, unassuming Lucy with her extraordinary photographic memory, always eager to help even if she's not the sharpest codebreaker in the Park. ;-) They're a great mix of very endearing characters, and the care and friendship shown between them is one of my favorite ""by-products"" of the series.

Without spoiling anything, let me just say the conclusion is powerful and satisfying and definitely leaves room for more. Here's sincerely hoping the producers make more!",1366934400,17,1453,5.63013698630137

5262252,5,B0094GWPOU,"I was able to watch all the episodes of this series thanks to a friend who had purchased the DVD off the Amazon UK site. The series was shown on PBS and is also available for download here.

The premise of the story is intriguing. Four women used to work as codebreakers back during WW II in Bletchley Park. Fast forward to the year 1952 - it has been several years since the war ended, and the four women have lost contact with each other. One in particular, Susan Gray (Anna Maxwell Martin who played the role of Bessie Higgins in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-South/dp/B000AYEL6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North & South</a>, Esther Summerson in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Episode-1/dp/B00406ROD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Episode 1</a>, and Sarah Burton in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/South-Riding/dp/B004NBHVNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">South Riding</a>) is leading a rather quiet life with her husband (who has no inkling of her real job during the war) and her two young children. Susan is a highly intelligent woman and is obviously looking for something to do other than childminding and housekeeping. When a series of murders take place, all involving young women, Susan thinks she may be able to help the police in their investigations. Unfortunately, her attempt to help does not yield anything, and her husband, upset at his wife's apparent interest in the case, forbids her to pursue it. Susan then decides that she might stand a better chance at solving the murders if she could get her code-breaking colleagues back together again, and so the Bletchley Circle is born.

The other women in the circle are Millie (Rachael Stirling), Lucy (Sophie Rundle), and Jean (Julie Graham) and though initially skeptical and reluctant to get involved, another murder acts as the catalyst that brings the women back together. The show is engaging on many levels. The period details are credibly done and brings post-war England to life. Little things like the rationing of food in 1952 (food rationing continued till 1954) is well-depicted in the show and many more (such as fashion) that transport the viewer into the past. The four women make an interesting group of crime solvers. Each individual has a strength that lends itself to puzzling out the case. The dialogue and manner of interaction is also well depicted and I enjoyed the attention to details in each scene.

The women's journey towards solving the case takes them into dark and menacing places and the show perfectly captures all the finer nuances of a good procedural. I would advise viewers who can be a little patient to wait till all three episodes are screened and then watch them back to back since I thought the story flowed better that way, instead of being chopped up, but certainly it can be enjoyed either way. The total running time on the DVD is 150 minutes.

There are only three episodes in this series, but I hope to see more of Susan and company, perhaps solving another crime in the near future? This is a well made period crime drama that should appeal to fans of crime dramas and period productions.",1366588800,22,3236,5.3767258382643
5262253,5,B0094GWPOU,"If you are an Anglophile and mystery lover, you will feast upon this intelligent whodunit and thriller set in 1952 England. There has been a spate of murders of young women, and former Bletchley Park code breaker now housewife, Susan, thinks she detects a pattern.

She convinces her husband, who doesn't know of her past as a code breaker, to visit Scotland Yard with her to tell them that there is a victim they haven't discovered, based upon the pattern of the killer. When no victim turns up, and Scotland Yard dismisses her, Susan turns to three female code breakers with whom she worked at Bletchley Park during WWII, to see if they will contribute their formidable talents to preventing a future murder.

While there is trepidation at first, the quartet is on the scent of the killer, discerning patterns and predicting next steps. The joy of this series is in the distinct character of the four women, the synergy and chemistry they have together, the period details of architecture, autos, custom and fashion. You feel you are in the early 1950's with the ration cards, the male-female relationships, and the attitudes towards women and limited opportunities for them to use their mental prowess.

Ah, we hope this series is so well-received and successful, it will become a regular show. Wouldn't that be a treat?

The production values of the show are fantastic. Love the actors who play the key roles: Anna Maxwell Martin (Susan), Rachael Stirling (Millie), Sophie Rundle (Lucy) and Julie Graham (Jean).
