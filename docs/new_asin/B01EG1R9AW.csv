7734687,1,B01EG1R9AW,Ordered wrong movie meant to by motel hell. Oh well my fault!,1481500800,,61,4.166666666666667
7734688,1,B01EG1R9AW,"This is absolutely awful. I love indie low budget horror movies but I barely got through this movie. Endless dialogue which gets old very fast since it's not even done right. Hardly anything happens in this movie except endless talking. Weak script, weak acting, weak plot- no suspense whatsoever, no scares- it wasn't even funny entertainment to laugh at. What a HUGE waste of money. Not even worth the rental. Skip this one- so many other indie horror movies that are well done- this is not one of them.",1479081600,,505,4.685393258426966
7734689,5,B01EG1R9AW,"Filmed in Dallas ,Luv it. simple and direct, not big budget ,but entertaining .",1478044800,,79,4.714285714285714
7734690,5,B01EG1R9AW,Very entertaining.  This movie blends 4 stories into 1 creepy film.  I think it is worth a watch with some popcorn & under a blanket!,1478044800,,133,4.28
7734691,1,B01EG1R9AW,"This Hotel is hell on the viewers...I really wanted to like this movie...but i did not. Its obvious this was a childs project which was rejected or dismissed. The actors and actresses seemed hung over as they trodded their way through this torturefest....Dialogue flat...Story...flat....Shots were unfocused and at times you had to squint...Maybe some will like it...However there is bad and there is bad..People mocked Unfriended...To me that was a masterpiece compared to this pointless dribble...I would mention the actors in here,however this thing tanked their shot of moving on to other projects...This isn't even tomatoe rating....its sardines. Wait thats an insult to sardines....What a piece of GARBAGE",1469145600,3,711,5.592592592592593

8758499,2,B01EG1R9AW,"Ummm, this was not Hotel Hell.",1517616000,,30,4.166666666666667
8758500,4,B01EG1R9AW,The cinematography and sound design were very well done considering the budget constraints of the production. Overall I though the film was enjoyable. Unfortunately the DVD cover art sells this movie as something it's not. If you're looking for clowns and gore look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a more thoughtful entry in the horror genre give this a watch.,1511654400,,362,5.033333333333333
8758501,1,B01EG1R9AW,"Nothing wrong with lo-budget, but when your mikes are crappy, your actors flat, your story-line nonexistent, and your cinematography mediocre, there's not a lot to go with in terms of entertainment.  Do yourself a favor, leave this one in the garbage bin beside ""Creepy Doll"" and ""Deborah"".",1507334400,,290,5.170212765957447
8758502,2,B01EG1R9AW,"I thought that the story would have been a good one, if they ever explained it...There is no reason for all of the ""happenings"" which you never really see because it is filmed in the blair witch way ( home video cameras from he actors) Like i said good premise, but not really worth the watch",1500422400,,292,4.232142857142857
8758503,1,B01EG1R9AW,Makes no sense. Just terrible.,1491436800,,30,5.2
8758504,1,B01EG1R9AW,"Would love to say something nice about this movie, but in all honesty I can't think of one redeeming quality in the entire thing.  Not worth the price of even a free movie.",1489449600,2,172,4.212121212121212
8758505,1,B01EG1R9AW,ok so horrible title that had nothing to do with the motel they were in. Plus clown on cover not the same as the one in the movie.i like corny movies but this one is not on my list of favs.,1489276800,,189,3.6341463414634148
8758506,1,B01EG1R9AW,"If I could rate it lower, I would.",1485820800,2,34,3.375
8758507,2,B01EG1R9AW,"Great stories....acting...eeehhhhh.
I definitely would have enjoyed it more with a stronger cast.",1485129600,,97,6.538461538461538
