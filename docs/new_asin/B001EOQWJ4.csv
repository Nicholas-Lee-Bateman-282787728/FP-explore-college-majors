8299161,3,B001EOQWJ4,"This is a great motivator and demonstrational tool of bodyweight exercises, but it's usefulness for instruction only applies if you bought the instructional DVD as well. The last reviewer made a good point that this could've done better as a bonus to the instructional DVD. but it is what is. Unless you can do the exercises here, you're just spectating.  For what it does, it's great.  The moves are pretty self-explanatory, just do it like they did. With the help of the beginner DVD, you can one day work up to doing these exercises.",1250553600,4,536,4.691489361702128
8299162,3,B001EOQWJ4,"While I will admit that the models in this video have awesome bodies, this video is not an instructional one it is a demonstration of what they can do; which is why I can only give it 3 stars.  Their builds are worth much, much more.  The DVD does not teach you how to achieve what they have achieved.  They don't speak during the video; there's just music and rap playing in the back ground.  Some of the rap is a little too much for me.

They have produced an instructional video that you can get for their site.  I am considering purchasing it although I think this one should have been a bonus feature of their workout video.  However, If I can achieve anything close to what they have using their program and my own body weight, any price would be worth it.",1231891200,3,762,4.25
