5891966,5,B00E6881UI,I just happened to come across the first season one morning and had to keep watching. I'm glad they made a second season. The story has some romance and comedy mixed in with magic and adventure. There are so many great characters in the story. The scenery is colorful and realistically magical. It takes place during Fall when the leaves are changing colors. The music is amazing and beautiful. I love the theme songs of both seasons. The singer has such a beautiful voice. The second season wraps everything up nicely.,1382140800,9,519,4.714285714285714
