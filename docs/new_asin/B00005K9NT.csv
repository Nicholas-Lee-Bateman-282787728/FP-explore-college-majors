2832279,5,B00005K9NT,"Funimation has finally started to release VHS and DVD simutaniously! This DVD is a must have for any Dragonball Z fan! The quality is a lot better than the Pioneer versions, and they're uncut, too. This DVD contains episodes not yet aired on Cartoon Network or any other television network. If you want to see what comes after the Cell Saga, this is what you need! I recommend this DVD to any Dragonball fan, big or small.....",990748800,7,426,4.545454545454546
2832280,4,B00005K9NT,"Well, the Junior Division is over and the adults draw numbers to see what order they will face each other in the tournament. 7 Z fighters are left in the final 16(Krillin, Gohan as Great Saiyaman, Goku, Vegeta, Videl, 18, and Piccolo) as well as the two evil Majins Supopo Bitchi and Yam(english names may vary). Also entered are Kibit and the God Kaioshin(name most likely changed) so they can seek out Baba-Di. Rounding out the fighters are Killer, Jewel, some big Genie Guy and the masked fighter named Mighty Mask has actually been replaced by Trunks and Goten. And let's not forget the last contestant who will face Android 18 in the first round, Mr. Satan. And did I mention that Goku and Vegeta drew 11 and 12 and face off in the first round?? Great set up although at times you may find yourself begging for the fight to start already out of sheer excitement...or maybe boredom you decide!",989798400,12,897,4.577639751552795

8194549,5,B00005K9NT,"Here is a great DVD, I like the fact that Funimation is still putting out DVD's before the airing on Cartoon Network, however, they still have a long way to go.  I remember watching this saga for the first time and not really liking it, but once Vegita goes Majin it's all time for some fun.  For all of you out there who are thinking they are making more episodes of DBZ, you are wrong, it's been done for years in Japan and even another series, Dragonball GT (Grand Tour) has been done after the DBZ storyline.  Anyways, there is a total of 291 episodes, so I hope you enjoy the last 100 or so episodes, they get better.  I would keep buying the DVD's, but they are so expensive to buy 3 episodes out of 291 for 20+ dollars.  oh well.",1002067200,2,736,4.154929577464789
8194550,5,B00005K9NT,"The episodes on this DVD were some of my favorites in the Dragonball Z sagas. The DVD has episodes of the strongest under the heaven's tournament. In this tournament Goku comes back to life for just one  day to participate in the action. He meets his son Goten for the first time and there is a big family and freinds reunion. During the tournament a lot of action goes on and some other stuff that I won't tell you, but is really cool happens ( i don't wanna ruin it for u). All Dragonball fans sould definatly get this DVD.",1001462400,,525,4.25
8194551,4,B00005K9NT,"Here's something for you guys that are tired of all Garlic Jr., Frieza and Android episodes being showed over and over again on Cartoon Network. I didn't even know of these episodes until recently, I had no idea their were ones with Gohan as a teenager. I just wish they didn't skip so many episodes, I mean how does Goku have another son now when he's dead ?, lol. I'm still waiting for The Cell Games and many many other episodes meanwhile they can save a lot of time by putting a lot more than 3 on a DVD. Still though these episodes are very engaging and entertaining and I strongly recommend them. Forget about watching that corny show with those annoying Pokemons saying their own names a thousand times in one show. Dragonball Z is a fun saga that actually has fantastic character buildups.",999129600,,797,4.503448275862069
8194552,5,B00005K9NT,"First Of all I am 13, nad also I am a big Anime fan. The World Tournament saga is the newest saga although there are only 3 videos of it out so far I own 2 of them and have enjoyed each. The draw is mainly about the start of the real matches, all of the fighters go up and draw numbers, several of the match ups are, Krillen vs Pintar, Piccolo vs. Shin, Videl vs. Spoppovitch, Great Saiyaman vs. Kibito, and Vegeta vs. Goku I loved this video and I highly recomend buying the previous video in the Wourld Tournament Saga, Would Tournament: Junior Division, so you can find out who wins the Junior Division and who gets to knock Mr. Satan clear across the ring!!!!!!",996019200,2,665,4.244094488188976
