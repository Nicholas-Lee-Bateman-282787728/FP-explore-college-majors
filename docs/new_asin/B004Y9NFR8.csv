8448039,5,B004Y9NFR8,The very idea of this movie creeped me out. Everything about this movie was good. I especially liked the look in the eyes when the guy was controlling people. It was the perfect stare of evil. I do recommend this movie to anyone who would like to buy it. To those who are still not sure. You can check out the trailer on youtube first to help make up your mind.,1405728000,,361,4.098591549295775
8448040,4,B004Y9NFR8,"Cho-In is an angry young man with a dark gift: he can completely control the mind of anyone within his line of sight, making them do his will.  He's had this ability since childhood, and now - bored and insolent - uses his ""talent"" to rob pawn shops.  Kyu-Nam, a kindhearted young man who lost his job at a scrapyard after a horrifying accident, lands a job with the Utopia pawn shop ... which not only crosses his path with Cho-In's, but puts them in direct combat when Cho-In - during the robbery - discovers Kyu-Nam is the first and only person, EVER, whose mind he can't control.  From here the film becomes a battle of good vs. evil (with occasional touches of humor to lighten the mood), Kyu-Nam determined to stop the crazed Cho-In, who's gone on a killing spree to destroy him.  Wonderfully tense, the film's only let down is in never revealing how Cho-In got his power - or why Kyu-Nam is impervious to it.  But for sheer suspense, a few great set pieces, and the intense performances of the two leads, 'Haunters' is an engrossing watch (a Japanese remake called 'Monsterz' is set to release this month).

8448041,5,B004Y9NFR8,"This movie is one of the best thriller movies I have ever seen! It has a great mixture of fantasy, sadistic killer-ism, heroics, stop-em-if-you-can, and just a small dash of brotherly humor. I admit that it is not really worth over 15 dollars to buy it but it's well worth anything beneath that price. From beginning to end, this movie really shows how a special gift could corrupt a soul. There are a few times when you feel a little bad for the antagonist but he's NOT one of those annoying ""I'm evil just because I like being bad"" types. They give you plenty of background as to why he becomes that way and they give you insight on the limitations of his ""gift."" Although it is fantasy, it is completely realistic. I particularly love how the protagonist isn't this super sexy hot-shot who is smart in books and/or has a mysterious past with the special forces unit but just happens to be kind of nice. The protagonist is especially like-able everyday kind of guy, an average joe thrown into chaos, and you'll find yourself rooting for him the whole way through!

(SPOILER - DO NOT CONTINUE READING IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE)

I have heard people call the ending trashy because of the protagonist's sudden super-human abilities but if you think about it - how he did survived a head on collision with a truck and healed quickly, even cutting off his own cast to get a job; and how he hit the side of a train and then slammed into a wall and was okay enough to continue his hunt a few days later; and how he plowed through like 100 people to reach the killer - the main killer-psychic guy wasn't the only person in the entire world that was gifted in some way. I love this movie for that. Not just a single person in the whole world is born special - but two, that happen to meet. While the psychic killer was powerful through others - controlling them - the protagonist's body was strong and he couldn't be controlled.",1362960000,,1925,4.419718309859155
8448042,1,B004Y9NFR8,"I bought this movie on DVD two months ago and with absolutely no hesitation I say that this is the worst  subtitled movie I have ever seen in my life. Single words pop up in place of sentences, the words ""How the"" and ""Feed"" pop up constantly, which indicates that this movie was subtitled with the aid of a computer program that goes with the literal rather than the logical and obviously has a glitch in it. Sentences consist of unrelated words that are followed by other sentences that make no sense whatever. The entire movie is unfathomable by reading the English subtitles and it is blatantly obvious that whoever titled this movie does not speak a word of English. Before you fork out one cent for this movie be warned that you will be completely unable to follow the story unless you happen to speak Korean. This is the worst, worst, worst subtitle job ever released to the public!",1306022400,2,889,4.55625
