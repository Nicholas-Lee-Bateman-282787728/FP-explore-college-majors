2934204,5,B000VA3JFM,"The show is good--but pay attention to the ""NON-USA FORMAT"".  THAT MEANS YOU CAN ONLY PLAY THIS ON A DVD PLAYER THAT PLAYS THE GREAT BRITAIN REGION!
HERE IN THE GOOD OLE' U.S.A., MOST OF OUR DVD PLAYERS WILL NOT PLAY A FORMAT WITHOUT HOOKING OUR PLAYERS UP TO COMPUTERS AND CHANGING THE FORMAT----THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE IT BACK AGAIN TO WATCH YOUR OTHER DVD'S! IF YOU GO ONLINE AND LOOK AT DVD FORMATS, YOU WILL SEE THAT PRACTICALLY EVERY COUNTRY ON THE GLOBE HAS A DIFFERENT FORMAT.  WHY IS THAT? WHAT A RIDICULOUS KIND OF PROBLEM TO BE FACED WITH IN THIS DAY AND AGE!!!!!!!
  THEY CAN BE WATCHED ON A COMPUTER, BUT BEWARE! MY COMPUTER TOLD ME THAT I WAS ONLY ALLOWED TO CHANGE THE REGION FORMAT OF THE DISK DRIVE A TOTAL OF FOUR TIMES!
MY SON IS TRYING TO FIND A PROGRAM ON THE INTERNET TO CONVERT THE SHOW TO A U.S.A. FORMAT SO I CAN PLAY IT AT HOME.",1336435200,,860,4.162650602409639
2934205,5,B000VA3JFM,"I can only say, if you like British humor, I think you will really like this show. I laughed out loud multiple times at the 'next' thing that was going wrong. Try the first 2-3 episodes, and you will  probably be hooked.",1326585600,,220,4.238095238095238
2934206,4,B000VA3JFM,"I watched both series (leading up to the wedding and the holidays) in sequence over the course of several days.  This series relies more on verbal entendre and slap stick, as opposed to say The Inbetweeners, which is more of the ""in your face"" variety of comedy.  It is also a series that builds up (again as opposed to say The Inbetweeners with episodes that essentially stand alone).  What makes this series truly great is that through the progression (AKA the art of compounding) you actually start to laugh harder, at the cascading calamities and the resulting sympathy that develops for main character.  Brilliantly written and wonderfully acted.  Call it 4 3/4-stars!",1309132800,4,673,4.973214285714286
8217636,5,B000VA3JFM,We wish there were more episodes. Excellent quality and so funny and positive.,1467244800,,78,5.076923076923077
8217637,5,B000VA3JFM,"I stumbled upon this show on PBS and was immediately hooked.  Because it was sporadically aired on PBS, I have seen only a few of the episodes.  This has got to be one of the funniest shows I've had the pleasure of watching, and Ben Miller played his part to the hilt.  Huge fan of his because of this show.  I wish they would release a DVD set that is compatible with our players.  It's a show you could repeatedly watch and still be rolling on the floor with laughter.  The peeing in the dark, and the lawnmower, and the house blowing up and the woman who madly loves him still keeps me laughing through tears just thinking about it.  As the British would say--Brilliant!  BRING IT TO THE US--PLEASE",1437955200,,701,4.338461538461538
8217638,5,B000VA3JFM,"Great fun - and often corny sorrow, but otherwise keep you giggling",1433030400,,67,4.666666666666667
8217639,1,B000VA3JFM,"I bought this because of Sarah Alexander (Coupling) unfortunately we are worlds away of the genius of Coupling.. Coupling was also about having people in umcomfortable situation and being funny, this is just boring and painful. I watched it because I began, but it kept on being just stupid. In fact it is a copy of Ben Stiller's ""meet the parents"", funny that the main character here look like Ben Stiller and has also almost the same name !! (Ben Miller)",1420416000,,456,4.6419753086419755
8217640,5,B000VA3JFM,"If you're looking to laugh hysterically and very loudly, this will do the trick.  I watched them here and bought the Region 2 to send to my dad in Europe.  He also found them hysterically funny.  I've watched this series more than once and it's impossible to not laugh.
Not recommended after any type of surgery that requires an incision or stitches...",1404604800,2,352,4.645161290322581
8217641,5,B000VA3JFM,"I have a UK version so make sure that you can play UK DVDs before you buy this.  The first series concerns the week leading up to the main characters' wedding, and the second leads up to the birth of their child.  Just when you think they've thought of every crazy thing that can happen, another wacky and sometimes awful but still funny thing happens.  We are saving the Worst Christmas until the holidays (also part of this DVD set).",1400371200,,435,4.4125
8217642,5,B000VA3JFM,"I finally got a multi-district DVD player, mainly for the British Comedies available only in British format.  100 percent worth it, even if only for this movie and ""William and Mary"".  This DVD is so hilarious, in its horrible, cringing way! Reminiscent of Fawlty Towers.  Very, very funny!",1395273600,,290,5.0
8217643,5,B000VA3JFM,"If you enjoy a comedy where most of the time you feel like crawling under the table, knowing that the worst that can happen will soon get worse, this is your series.
Sex, death, murder, drunkenness, prostitutes, drugs, poo jokes...you name it.
Sheer brilliance.",1372291200,,261,4.954545454545454
8217644,5,B000VA3JFM,One of the funniest shows that the British ever made. The premise of the show is so unbelievable but the way the show is produced makes it entirely believable and so funny you will be crying.,1356393600,,191,4.333333333333333
8217645,1,B000VA3JFM,Saw it on Netflik.  was one of the funniest things I ever saw in my life.  I invited to a group over for drinks and a video night.  Unfortunately could not play the cds.  They were for British dvd players.  Very dissapointed.  Why would you idiots sell the version to anyone in the US?,1348012800,,285,4.185185185185185
