5772590,5,B00D3PAQHQ,"Watchers 6: The Secret Cosmic War is a very good watch. L.A. Marzuli's Watchers series is basically the X Fils for real from a Christian perspective. He takes on many many interesting contemporary issue's in light of the Bible, we learn Just how UFO's, Aliens, Alien Abductions, Conspiracies, Bigfoot, Monsters, Etc., fit in to a Biblical world view. These subjects are covered on the first 5 in the Watchers series. On Watchers 6 we take a trip to Peru to discuss the Nephilim of Genesis Chapter 6 (and elsewhere in the scriptures), We trace them to the new world, from Israel and look at the Elongated Skulls and the Megalithic structures. This is a thought provoking and evidence filled DVD and it will make you think. You will see evidence that some human like beings existed in the past who had elongated skulls, they were looked at as demigods by the ancients and they tried to be like them and using devisees to tweak their skulls to be elongated as well. But there is evidence that clearly distinguishes the difference between two. We also see evidence that the megalithic structures could not have been built by the Ancient man. And we see that these megalithic structures may of been powered. This is a must watch I highly recommend it and the whole series.",1381190400,7,1267,4.686098654708521

Hiking through the dense Peruvian forests and driving countless miles through small narrow villages in Paracas, Peru, South America, Author/Pastor, LA Marzulli, and his friends, were on a search of a lifetime-unearthing unspoiled evidence of the bones and skeletons of the fallen angels, the Nephilim and megalithic structures known as the temples of worship by these ancient beings.

These beings were predated from an ancient civilization, prior to the Incas of South America.

LA was Joined by his fellow cohorts and researchers, authors in their own respective fields:
*Brien Foerster, Ancient Mysteries: South America and the Pacific; Adventure Tours and Author,
*Joe Taylor, Owner Curator at Mt. Blanco Fossil Museum Location Crosbyton, Texas (Lubbock, Texas Area),
*Dr. Judd Burton, a historian of religion and anthropologist,
*Ron Morehead, the producer of the Bigfoot Recordings Vol. 1 & 2 as well as an accomplished author, and
*Richard Shaw, cinematographer, Producer, Director @ Pinlight LLC, Hollywood, CA.

The team of explorers examined megalithic stone temples, some with stargates, and noted their architectural structures amazed at their engineering shapes and complexities of how these tons of granite stone could have been shaped and carried to their setting place.  What type of machinery or precision cutting tools could have been used to create these shapes?

They visited various historical and national museums housing skeletons, in particular a woman and child, perceived to be fallen angels in a mummified state. One museum had guards guarding it.  The section housing ancient skeletons were being renovated and were no longer available to the public.  Now they have guards?

In one segment the team drives up the Macchu Picchu mountains to an ancient ""church"" in Cuscos, Peru, that was once an ancient temple of worship.

Their explorations of discovery included a massive cemetery with bones left scattered after being pillaged by grave diggers in search of gold, silver, or pottery. They conducted their own field tests, DNA testing and analysis, and further research with Museum Curator from Blanco, Texas, Joe Taylor, casting a mold of a skull for future study.

Each frame in this DVD sends the viewer into a state of anticipation.  What else are these researchers going to meet?  As many questions are being asked and answered, many more could not be answered.

They talked about the possibility of an ancient power grid that emanated from one particular structure which was so high-tech in design that the explorers came away with an understanding that the Incas didn't have the technology that was required to develop the structures.  Are these ancient stargates or portals into and from another dimension?

When questioned, some of the local villagers were under the impression that these structures were already in these areas prior to the Incas settling into them.

So what caused their demise?  Some of the structures had boulders ripped off, that they had fallen from the mountains now laying in the lower valley, too big and heavy for anyone to remove them to clear the way.  These boulders leave behind their story that once over 3,000 years ago, they were part of a larger story of an ancient civilization, so high-tech but not beyond destruction.  Did Noah's Flood cause their downfall?

Did the Fallen Angels once inhabit these areas leaving behind their once existing testimony of their high-tech existence?

In one image of a mummified skeleton, you will note that in the background, on the wall is a photograph of a skull but with an alien image directly next to it.

The museum believes these ancient skulls and skeletons resemble the Fallen Angels which we call Aliens today.

Fact or Fiction?  You decide, the evidence is mounting.

I bought this DVD from LA Marzulli's website, wrote a review on my own website, and would highly recommend it.

It's another step in making the case in proving the existence of the Nephilim, the Fallen Angels.",1378166400,15,4176,5.356814701378254

5772595,1,B00D3PAQHQ,"I bought this dvd based on the ads and reviews of others. I quickly found out this film had nothing do with the biblical ""Watchers"" or ""Nephilim"" but some elongated skulls. If you like travel films, you may enjoy seeing the ruins of Peru. Otherwise this dvd is a total waste of money. Like so many books and films reportedly to reveal the mysteries of the Bible, this one fails to do anything",1374192000,6,392,4.383561643835616
5772596,5,B00D3PAQHQ,"Before we get into the meat I want to state upfront what a fun and engrossing ride this video is. Regardless of your worldview or what you're looking out for I can guarantee you that you will find this an enjoyable watch. It's a real adventure and the production quality is first rate across the board.  It's as good as anything you're going to see on the History Channel except more truthful IMHO at least.

This subject matter by its very nature is sensational and ""on the fringe"" in relation to the 'mainstream' in and out of religious and scientific circles.

What we have here with this video and its companion book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Trail-of-the-Nephilim-Volume-1-On-the-Trail-of-the-Nephilim-Giant-Skeletons-Ancient-Megalithic-Structures/dp/B00D5DZIWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Trail of the Nephilim, Volume 1 (On the Trail of the Nephilim, Giant Skeletons & Ancient Megalithic Structures)</a>&nbsp;from L.A. Marzulli and company is no less than a game changer in the making. As far as I'm concerned they've blown the lid off this entire subject matter and it's handled in such a manner that I think any skeptic who looks all this over is going to at least be walking away asking some tough questions as well they should be.

As always, I greatly appreciate L.A.'s even handed handling of the subject matter. Great care is taken to indicate ""opinion/theory"" vs ""actual concrete facts thus far.""

Both this video and the companion book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Trail-of-the-Nephilim-Volume-1-On-the-Trail-of-the-Nephilim-Giant-Skeletons-Ancient-Megalithic-Structures/dp/B00D5DZIWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Trail of the Nephilim, Volume 1 (On the Trail of the Nephilim, Giant Skeletons & Ancient Megalithic Structures)</a>&nbsp;make it clear that this is just the beginning of the endeavor.

For this venture, L.A. And his crew traveled down to several location in Peru during a two week whirlwind of a trip that I'm sure none of them will ever forget.  The reason they went down there is because access to a number of artifacts was easier down there then it is here in the United States, at least for now.  The crew consisted of Brien Foerster, Dr. Judd Burton, Ron Morehead, Joe Taylor, producer Richard Shaw, and of course L.A. Marzulli himself.

Among the artifacts pictured and documented were a number of enormous megalithic structures that align perfectly with the sun and astrological phenomena and a precision in building methods that we can't emulate to this day. Evolution teaches we continue to improve as we move forward. The pictures and scholarship coming out of this venture clearly proves otherwise. During this blazing hour and twenty minutes video you're going to see that if a picture is worth a thousand words than video is worth even more.

It's difficult to argue with structures staring you in the face that consist of three to four time periods worth of building materials combined and an untrained eye can easily chart how much more inferior the methods and construction become as you move forward in time moving from the ground up.

That's the beauty of this. You don't have to be some high end specialist to look at everything in this video and immediately see what's what for yourself.

The fact of the matter is this: We have the Great Pyramid and all these other awesome megalithic structures around the world that simply cannot be replicated today and that flies directly in the face of the concept of evolution and Darwinianism.  How can anyone look this stuff over and still tell us we're improving and getting better as time moves on? No wonder the Smithsonian is trying to cover it up. Oops did I just write that ""out loud?""

So how did they build structures that have a weight, size, and precision that we can't replicate today if we try? How did they build these things that just happen to line up with each other perfectly along lines of latitude globally and also line up just right with certain astronomical and astrological formations?

None of this can be verified except from the air.  Let that fact sink in and think about it.

How do you pull all that off back in the Stone Age?

The building materials and methods themselves are still near impossible for us to replicate today. For example how do you have stones that look like they were melted into place in just a certain way and are so tightly and specifically locked together that you can't even fit a hair through the cracks? Look at the size! We couldn't do that today if we tried. The nearest quarry from some of these structures is 60 miles away.  What sort of technology did they have back then to pull this off that we don't have now?

The other major body of evidence in process is, of course, the numerous anomalous skeletons and skulls that were uncovered near these megalithic sites.

Down in Peru, the team was given the freedom to handle these artifacts up close and to be inspected in the proper manner by archaeologists and other people of scholarly credentials that one would hope to see on an expedition such as this.  Many of the anomalous skulls could be explained away with the usual conventions of cradle-boarding and the like however there were at least four skulls that even archaeologist Dr. Judd Burton said ""blew his mind"" and defied ANY and all conventional explanations including any known cradle-boarding methods and concepts.  Anyone who knows Dr. Burton and his work at all knows he is not easily impressed and is not given to throwing around hyperbole.

If you can officially eliminate cradle-boarding then Elvis has left the building with some of these skulls and good luck explaining it away conventionally without some serious scholarship and proof of your own to back it up with.

A question must be asked: How's come all these different civilizations around the world went through this cradle-boarding phase? How do you even come up with a concept like that? Where did they get the idea from? Was it a hand me down? An imitation?  Plenty of documentation exists and is shown in this video that giants and anomalous skulls similar to the ones found in Peru during this trip have been found in the Americas dating back as far as at least 3500 years and yet this is covered up. Why? Because it destroys the Darwinian concept in about two seconds? You can't reconcile the two.

The jury is still technically out on this but the evidence gathered thus far clearly indicates that it all comes from an original source. The main thesis of this entire project is that all of these things point to the Nephilim or Giants mentioned in the Old Testament of the Bible, with the most well known reference being Genesis 6.

I'd honestly be interested to see skeptics' reaction to this video and its companion book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Trail-of-the-Nephilim-Volume-1-On-the-Trail-of-the-Nephilim-Giant-Skeletons-Ancient-Megalithic-Structures/dp/B00D5DZIWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Trail of the Nephilim, Volume 1 (On the Trail of the Nephilim, Giant Skeletons & Ancient Megalithic Structures)</a>&nbsp;after taking it all in.

There really are some things afoot here that defy any and all conventional explanations that we know of and thankfully this video and its companion book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Trail-of-the-Nephilim-Volume-1-On-the-Trail-of-the-Nephilim-Giant-Skeletons-Ancient-Megalithic-Structures/dp/B00D5DZIWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Trail of the Nephilim, Volume 1 (On the Trail of the Nephilim, Giant Skeletons & Ancient Megalithic Structures)</a>&nbsp;are just the beginning of this research process.

As of this writing DNA test results are pending on a number of items from this Peru excursion. There were some preliminary DNA results mentioned that I won't spoil for you but be prepared to have your jaw drop.

More trips will be forthcoming and soon because the window of opportunity is closing to be able to get access to these items which ought to be a clue to folks that's something's fishy.  Why is it that at least one very prominent and famous scientific institution has been stumbling all over itself to make any of this evidence disappear in and even outside of the United States?

What about the press? You can't imply or outright state that there's a cover up of some kind without their assistance of course and it's painfully obvious they're doing exactly that.

Back in the 1800s there were press clippings all the time of people unearthing giant bones, artifacts, and hidden underground caverns in the United States and all over the world. Some of these skeletons were 15 feet in height with two rows of teeth and six fingers and toes. How do you explain that? What's the Darwinian answer to something like that? Why did it all ""get disappeared?""  I think I know. You can come up with your own conclusions after you've looked all this over.

It's an important area of study.  For Christians it's that much more concrete proof that the Bible can be trusted and should be taken literally when possible. It also casts more of a light on exactly what Jesus meant when He said the season of His eventual return would be ""like the days of Noah"" in Matthew 24.  Jesus could have picked any time period He wanted. What differentiated Noah's time up to the Flood vs any of the others? The Nephilim. Genetic manipulation and abominations ""not after their own kind."" What sorts of things are happening in our labs around the world right now even what we've seen leaked out in the mainstream from time to time? It's disturbing to say the least. Ominous.

For anyone else with varying worldviews you're going to see some things and read some things here that should make you want to ask some tough questions and get down to the bottom of things and rightfully so. I would encourage you to do exactly that. There's a number of things presented here that fly clearly in the face of Darwinism and other modern day conventions that simply can't be reconciled.

Clearly enough material is presented here that people should take umbrage to some pretty compelling evidence that they've been lied to about a number of important things including real history. No one likes to be lied to. Are people interested in the truth no matter what? If so then this material is for you. Be prepared to be challenged and have some comfy concepts and traditions challenged.

The worse case scenario here is you're going to get a fun and though provoking video that will be excellent chat fodder. It's only uphill after that. I can't wait to see what comes next!",1371945600,31,10762,5.194107452339688

5772603,3,B00D3PAQHQ,"in a nutshell this film pro ports the possibility that the huge megalithic stone structures found in Peru were created by a race of giants who perhaps moved on to which the Incas inherited these structures.  The Incas did not have the strength or the skill of the giants so their construction was much less sophisticated and immense making it easy to see the difference.  Then a catastrophic event cleared the deck sort of speak and the ruins were all that was left which over hundreds of years still exist.  Now, you don't have to believe this premise, but you should know this is the producers belief.  What works regardless is the tour of many impressive and unexplainable things in Peru.  Guided by L.A. and Brian, who are quite knowledgeable if not actual scientist or archeologists, we go places and see things wed likely never see or know about.  Thats the value here which rises over any theory which simply is impossible to prove.

5772641,5,B00D3PAQHQ,"Marzuli had done a great job. His documentary was well researched and presented. I found ""watchers 6: the Cosmic War"" incredible and mind-boggling, but very believable.  I was fascinated by the information presented on the actual elongated skulls shown and analyzed. The documentary gave insights into our distant past and provided  a link to similar artifacts in Egypt. We are getting closer to knowing who we really are and  where we might have come from. I loved watching this documentary. It resonated a feeling of affinity within me!",1413072000,2,538,5.090909090909091

5772643,3,B00D3PAQHQ,"Interesting topic; I was pleased to learn that there are museums (although very few in the US) wherein can be found examples of this unknown culture.
The only ""scratchy"" part of this video (for me) is Mr. Marzulli and crew's continual mispronunciation of ""Senor"". ""Senior"" is incorrect.",1412726400,,286,5.1063829787234045

5772648,2,B00D3PAQHQ,"IT was only about elongated skulls and curious man made structures.  What about the ""secret cosmic war"" that's part of the title?

Pretty good though for what it was.",1387670400,,166,4.689655172413793

8589138,4,B00D3PAQHQ,i was puzzled about some content but the video of different parts of Peru were outstanding!,1518307200,,91,4.75
8589139,4,B00D3PAQHQ,Overall a great introduction to what is being hidden from us about the past. The anamolies found are not being addressed by science and I urge people to do some research. Youd be amazed about our real history.,1516579200,,209,4.526315789473684

8589143,5,B00D3PAQHQ,"This is a good and interesting film but the title is totally misleading. The film is not about a cosmic war but about a  scientific investigation in Peru.  They are looking for three things:
 Signs of ancient giants
 Checking out large elongated skulls
 Looking at ancient buildings and marveling about the precise construction that was done 3000 or more years ago.

I liked the movie and I rated it 5 stars. The information presented is done in a professional manner and it was interesting. I do believe that they should retitle the film.",1498089600,4,539,4.741935483870968
