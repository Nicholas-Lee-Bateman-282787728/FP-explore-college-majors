8428722,1,B004GHLFES,"Let me give the conclusion first: these DVDs get five stars for episodes 1-18 and one star for episodes 19-48 based on the quality of the English subtitles.

Ryomaden is an historical drama from NHK, Japan's public broadcasting system. The show is a dramatization of the life of Sakamoto Ryoma, a low level samurai who was involved in several of the amazing events which led up to the end of Japan's rule by the Tokugawa Shogunate in the 1860s.

The NHK DVDs sold on Amazon's Japanese site cost several hundred dollars, don't play on region 1 players and have no subtitles at all (not even in Japanese!). These DVDs (2010 Japanese Drama: Ryoma Den Season 1+2 (Episodes 1-48) (2 Boxset 6 Discs) w/ English Subtitle) have the complete series and look to be the same video quality as the NHK discs on my TV. In the first 18 episodes the English subtitles are excellent: the Japanese is translated into fluent English with transliteraltion of Japanese names, place names, titles, etc into widely accepted English equivalents. I think these subtitles were done by izumisano who blogs on (and runs?) the Fukuyama Masaharu no Heart website. Five stars for an excellent effort.

The subtitles for episodes 19 through 48 were done by a person who is fluent in neither English nor Japanese. The 19-48 translator's English is full of spelling errors and unnatural sentence constructions. This is mostly humorous and only fustrating enough to subtract one star. What subtracts the other three stars is the 19-48 tranlator's Japanese: the Chinese characters that the Japanese use to write their language are translated into Chinese! Japanese names like Hanpeita become Pan or sometimes Wu, Katsu becomes Lang or sometimes Rang, the Japanese concept of Joui (oust all foreigners from Japan) is translated as rant, the Japanese name for the shogunate, Bakufu, is translated as city council, etc, etc, etc. The story becomes impossible to follow! A one star effort.",1296432000,4,1949,4.990769230769231
