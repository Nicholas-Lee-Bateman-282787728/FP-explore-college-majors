With Harry Warren and Al Dubin songs and Busby Berkeley dances, this film works on several levels about life in the theatrical world. The black and white version of this classic film still holds today with a great story, cast, music and dancing. The story of Peggy Sawyer who becomes a star when the star of the show breaks a leg in rehearsals. The cast includes Ginger Rogers, Dick Powell, Bebe Daniels, Una Merkel, Guy Kibbee, Ned Sparks, George Brent, Warner Baxter, and more.

This classic DVD features extras like three vintage featurettes about ""Harry Warren: America's Foremost Composer,"" ""Hollywood Newsreel,"" ""A Trip Through a Hollywood Studio"" and ""Notes on Busby Berkeley."" The DVD could have used some current footage on how this film influenced a hit Broadway musical complete with dancing and singing.

would only play half of the DVD. The outside of the black shipping case and the padded envelope were in great shape, couldn't ask for better.

382693,5,6301964217,"What exactly is a great movie? A great movie, is one that grabs you from the first second and doesn't let you go until it's over. 42nd Street is a great movie, one of the greatest of all time.

I bought this Blu-ray to upgrade myself from the really fine DVD I already had. I got home from work, found my package, opened it up, and quickly stuck the disk in the player, to see for myself how good a job Warner did restoring this picture. I was going to watch a bit of it and then go make dinner. But that didn't happen. The opening strains of ""You're Getting to be a Habit With Me"" flowed out in beautiful warm uncompressed audio, and the credits started to roll, and I was hooked again. The air of excitement, the expectancy, the desperate hope that something wonderful was going to begin. And the picture looks beautiful, too. I couldn't have stopped it and walked away to save my life.

Of course it's frivolous, silly, and very very corny. It was corny even at the time. But in spite of that, maybe even because of it, 42nd Street has a vibrancy that can't be matched by anything today. It's thrilling even now. And of course, loaded with incredible talent. And the Busby Berkeley production numbers are gratifyingly spectacular and beautiful, with deep blacks and glowing whites the way it was when it was first seen by astonished audiences in 1933.

I read a lot of criticism of Ruby Keeler, because her tap dancing looks awkward and clumsy to today's viewers. Keeler was a follower of the early ""Buck and Wing"" style of tap dancing, and it was all about the taps. She knew what she was doing. Once you realize what she's up to, it's incredible fun to watch her throw her tiny little body this way and that in reckless, single-minded determination to nail those taps Just So! And she does it like her life depends on it. It's a perfect fit with the ""do-or-die"" theme of the film. (If you really want to appreciate Ruby Keeler, you should see her in ""Footlight Parade"" matching steps with James Cagney, another great dancer of the same style.)

If only one Depression musical made it to Blu-ray in full glory, it had to be this one! Hopefully the success of this will bring the rest of the Busby Berkeley films to restoration.",1438819200,,2231,4.447432762836185

382742,5,6301964217,"A classic that shows its age, beautifully. That is, this template for backstage musicals is a wonderfully evocative reflection of its era, that era being the depths of the Depression when Hollywood escapism soared to ironically delirious heights.  One of the studio system's most durable early-talky classics, this putting-on-a-show show has characters of depth, pre-Code sauciness galore (Ginger Rogers plays ""Anytime Annie"") and some of Busby Berkeley's most dazzlingly loony numbers -- with Irving Bacon directing the nonmusical portions. The BluRay black-and-white doesn't shimmer as much as a Paramount film of the same vintage would, but it's still visually melodious-- a gritty musical (sounds like a contradiction in terms) as only the Brothers Warner could produce, a black-and-white classic that towers more loftily with each passing decade, and it looks better on Blu-Ray than it has in any other home-video version.  A great great movie.",1430956800,,949,5.537931034482758

382745,5,6301964217,"Now this is how old films from the Thirties should look and sound. Warner's Home Video through their Warner Archive Collection have released ""42nd Street""(1933) one of the all-time great musicals on Blu-ray for the first time and the results are just stunning. This new Blu-ray presentation is nearly pristine(Bitrate: 35.00) and for a film that's over 80 years old, the results are very impressive. Essentially a ""backstage musical"" about the creation and rehearsals for a new show that is to open on Broadway in five weeks, Warner's gives ""42nd Street"" a whole new life on Blu-ray and fans of the film will not be disappointed by the restoration of this classic Depression era musical. As mentioned above, the video quality is nearly flawless with the only the transition between each of the scenes having any noticeable damage. The director(or editor) uses a transition ""wipe"" technique instead of a straight cut but this only lasts a few seconds before the picture returns to it's crystal clear image. Gone are all of the vertical lines, white specks, torn frames, etc. that have been a problem with standard DVD versions of the film in the past. The Audio(DTS-HA Master Audio) has been improved also with no noise artifacts(hiss, pops, etc.). Dialogue and songs are crystal clear and easy to understand. The story itself moves along at a breakneck pace due in no small part by the director, Lloyd Bacon. Bacon gets some incredible shots of all the goings on of putting on a new show with his high crane shots from the top of the theatre being especially impressive. As good as Bacon's direction is, the three Busby Berkeley numbers(""Shuffle Off to Buffalo"", ""I'm Young and Healthy"", ""42nd Street"") is still amazing choreography in 2015 as they must have been to 1933 Depression audiences. ""42nd Street"" features a who's who of acting talent with Warner Baxter, Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler, Una Merkel and Ginger Rogers among the all star cast that give exceptional performances. It doesn't get any better than ""42nd Street"" when it comes to great musicals from Hollywood's Golden Era. ""42nd Street"" is 89 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.37:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. There are numerous Special Features, many of them transferred over from the 2006 standard DVD. Included are three vintage featurettes: ""Harry Warren, America's Foremost Composer"", ""A Trip Through a Hollywood Studio"" and ""From Book to Screen to Stage"". Also included are several vintage newsreels about the film as well as two vintage Warner Brothers cartoons. Warner's has also included a song selection that will allow viewers to watch individual songs without watching the whole film again. ""42nd Street"" is one of the best musicals from Hollywood's Golden Era and Warner's new Blu-ray of the film  should be essential addition to everyone's film library. It comes very highly recommended.",1429747200,,2883,5.0951374207188165

382788,5,6301964217,"I love this movie.  The first time I saw was in high school.  It's not just entertaining, but it is a useful instructional tool for anyone who performs.  The most important thing I took from it was a line given from Dorothy Brock to Peggy Sawyer:  ""The customers want to like you.""  How true, at least for live performances (although after having lived in the Philadelphia area, I have some doubts).

Look to Warner Baxter for the best portrayal on film of a stage director of a musical (at least from the handful I've worked with).  For some reason, normally rational directors get deranged when having to work with a chorus over a period of time.  Performances are outstanding all the way around EXCEPT for Ruby Keeler, who comes across as completely wooden.  One of the big ironies of the film is when the Ginger Rogers character says (basically) ""I know I can't carry the show, but (the Ruby Keeler character) can.""  You'd have to be blind not to see that, perhaps with the exception of dancing (later completely disproved in the movies she did with Fred Astaire) Ginger Rogers could perform circles around Ruby Keeler.  In my humble opinion, of course.

Some of the film is very dated.  There are several inappropriate racial stereotypes.  Sadly, that was the era the film came from and to have done otherwise would have ""raised eyebrows"".",1427068800,,1344,4.71244635193133

382792,5,6301964217,"42nd St. gives us an un-sugarcoated portrayal of how tough the theatre business was in the midst of the Depression. Adding to the mix is the delicious pre-Code overlay. Nary a scene goes by without sly innuendo or a zingy one-liner. Indeed for sheer spice and energy this may be my favorite pre-Code movie.
As with so many of those early Thirties movies, the film seems startlingly modern, certainly in its street-wise attitudes if not necessarily the technology. Also fascinating is the mildly downbeat ending which recalls the low-keyed, somber ending to Gold Diggers of 1933.
And of course the Busby Berkeley numbers - what more can be said? I'm fondest of the title tune production. Also kudos to the 'Young and Healthy' number: women's legs never looked so abstract!
42nd St. has a terrific cast, especially the ladies. Ruby Keeler and Bebe Daniels are wonderful. My only criticism is they look a lot alike and it's easy to confuse them. Also an early Ginger Rogers role. The men do less well. At their ineffectual, vanilla worst, George Brent and Dick Powell are essentially wasted here. Indeed the Powell-Keeler, Brent-Keeler and Brent-Daniels romantic subplots strike me as the only weak links of the film.
Powells and Brents lame contributions are more than balanced by the supporting players: Ned Sparks, Allen Jenkins, Robert McWade, George E. Stone, and Guy Kibbee.
However, and no disrespect to Berkeleys phantasmagoric choreographic miracles, this is Warner Baxter's movie. Intense, dictatorial, abusive, self-punishing, he's perfect as the stage director from Hell. Why didn't this guy have a bigger career? Especially fascinating is that the fragile mental and physical health of character Julian Marsh mirrored Baxters own medical problems which led to his premature death in 1951. He really looked strung out and exhausted through much of the movie, and this adds immensely to the character.",1411516800,,1909,5.181229773462783

382810,1,6301964217,"This is a tepid, dull film that doesn't have anything very important found within it. The actors are extremely unbelievable in the shoddy one dimensional roles and what we learn is that people treated everyone with extreme cruelty in the 1930's, as if they owned everyone. There's plenty of shouting, to no effect, plenty of bad one line jokes, and an extreme amount of overacting, not to mention a denigration of women as objects. The script is horrendous, its the type of common story telling found at boring big studios only trying to make a buck.

The small plot seems to have been written by someone under contract at one of the big movie studios (no character development, no complicated interactions, no involved dialogue). I couldn't believe the amount of praise this movie receives from everyone, its entirely average and lackluster. The ending was rather forced and seemed incomplete, divulging absolutely nothing at all to the audience except to believe that the ""show was a hit"".

382838,5,6301964217,"42nd Street...Immediately upon saying the title,hundreds upon thousands of dancing feet are heard tapping in the subconscious mind.  It has been over 70 years since Busby Berkeley's musical film extravaganza was first released, but the name 42nd Street is synonymous with Broadway, theater, musicals, and entertainment in general.

Released in 1933, 42nd Street is a smorgasbord of entertainment, A talented cast, a smart script, a musical score written by Harry Warren and Al Dubin, together with Berkeley's lively imagination, proved to be a winning combination. The box office success of 42nd Street saved the movie musical from oblivion, and for the next three decades, they would dominate movie marquees all over the world.

The plot is quite simple:  Young and talented chorus girl is chosen to take over the female lead part in a show after the lead actress breaks her ankle during a drunken brawl.  The chorus girl is played by a fresh and young dancer from New York named Ruby Keeler.
The film would also introduce a young crooner by the name of Dick Powell.  Another young lady in the film would later become a famous dancing star herself, Ginger Rogers.

The movie is campy and fun.  The Choreography is wonderful, but Berkeley preferred to move the dancers around in geometric patterns and filled the sound stages with as many dancers as possible.  I have read that some reviewers feel that Ruby Keeler's dancing is not in the same caliber as Eleanor Powell, but like singers, all dancers have different styles, and you either like them or you don't. I like both Ruby and Eleanor, and to me, comparing them would be like comparing apples to oranges.

42nd Street, on the whole, is a wonderfully entertaining film.  I highly recommend it.

Yes, true, I couldn't stay consistently in character in the first paragraph.
Hopefully, though, I did communicate my thought adequately.
If you want to understood the roots of the movie musical and what it became, this is one of the earliest polished productions in that history. If you want to see what made the American popular song in pre-Elvis days, listen to the score by two of Broadway's best songwriters, Harry Warren, the Italian guy, and Al Dubin, the Jewish guy. Don't miss the bonus short with Harry Warren at the piano playing some of his many hit songs (while a typical 30's group of singers gather round the piano). Do Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell seem  kind of weak in their roles: the audience loved both through the next years.

382904,5,6301964217,"SPOILER ALERT!

When I started seriously exploring classic film, by way of film noir, I never imagined I would ever own a musical. Gene Kelly and Busby Berkeley changed that. Of all the musicals I've seen, I think that 42nd Street is my favorite. It isn't as light and frothy as the other Berkeley musicals and it displays a playful, and relatively sophisticated attitude toward sex. I knew from reviews that this film was loaded with sexual innuendo, yet I was still shocked at what they got away with. Of course, if it was made just just one year later it would have been a very different film. But in that heady time before the code got its teeth, they went hog wild. Much of the sex in 42nd Street is not innuendo at all, but blatantly stated, and what is implied is sometimes downright shocking. Two scenes in particular made my jaw drop.
  The first happened during a dance rehearsal in which the girls have to sit on the laps of the male dancers. One of the boys says to his partner, ""Hey, what are you sitting on?"" She replies, ""on a flagpole!"" (gasp) In those days, movies didn't even aknowlege that men had penises. For a girl to imply she had just sat on an erect one is just scandalous.
  The second scene that shocked me was the obvious gay scene, which no one ever seems to talk about. This happens when the Julian Marsh character is sitting on the sidewalk depressed about the terrible rehearsals and his poor health. The Andy Lee character sits down to comfort him. After a short heart to heart and arm in arm talk, Julian asks Andy, ""What are you doing? You got a date tonight?"" Andy looks at his date who is impatiently waiting and says that he doesn't. Julian says, ""Come on home with me, will ya. I'm lonesome."" Andy does. It might not sound like much here, but when you watch it closely, and in the hyper-sexual context of the film, it is obviously a proposition, and obviously one that had been made and accepted before. What is most shocking about it is also that which kept it from being recognised for what it was by the general audiences in 1933. That is the fact that Julian isn't a limp-wristed and neurotic fairy, which is all that audiences were used to seeing. In fact it would be about 50 years before they would see anything else. Julian is a masculine and successful man and the most sympathetic character in the film. But here he is, the only man in the film who isn't constantly trying to score with multiple women, and he makes a tender, intimate proposition to another man. (gasp again!) It made me want to stand up and cheer, and definately helped to make this my favorite BB musical.",1288742400,,2623,4.433609958506224

It is a typical ""Hey guys, we're going to make a hit show!"" movie but it's a cut or two above the standard.  For one thing, there is a large cast with a lot of subplots.  Secondly, it has a lot of good music.  The title song is impressive as well as ""You're Getting to be a Habit with Me"" (I always liked Alan Sherman's spoof version ""You may be a Playboy Bunny but You're Getting to be Rabbit with Me"").  However, the song that captured my attention (and will be the main reason I will watch this film again and again) is ""Shuffle Off to Buffalo"".  There are several Busby Berkeley numbers that are typically outstanding.  I still ponder the supposed setting in a 1930's legitimate theater where the audience is presented with a horizontal view of a stage number that can only be appreciated from a vertical perspective.  However, I suspect that I ponder too much.

""42nd Street"" is a good film to watch if you want to see why Song and Dance was such a popular genre back then.

382938,5,6301964217,"Those hoping for MGM technicolor candy-coated escapism should look elsewhere. 42nd Street is a hardscrabble Warner Brothers movie from a hardscrabble era. In 1932, the filmmakers were not straight-jacketed by the Production Code (Warners, admirably, was the last studio to fully comply) and it shows. 42nd Street entertains grandly, but also warrants serious attention as a reflection of the United States in the throes of the Great Depression.

The plot has been summarized many times but may be worth another look through the darker prism of the film's historical context (SPOILERS AHEAD):

Theatrical producers Jones and Barry hire down-and-out Julian Marsh, excellently played by Warner Baxter, to direct their new show, ""Pretty Lady."" Marsh is a brilliant director but a desperate man. He has lost all his money in the '29 stock market crash. He's a physical and emotional train wreck. If ""Pretty Lady"" fails, it's all over for him. He drives himself and his cast relentlessly, grinding his cast through endless rehearsals, grinding the endless cigarettes he chain-smokes into the stage floor.

Leading lady Dorothy Brock (Bebe Daniels) has known great success in the past, but is glad to have a job ""with this Depression on."" She not only carries the lead of the show, she carries the responsibility for its financing. She has no taste whatever for the show's unattractive but wealthy backer, Abner Dillon (Guy Kibbe), but she must spend time in his company, dangling the promise of her sexual favors just out of his reach, to keep him supporting the production. Meanwhile, she meets secretly with her unemployed ex-lover from her vaudeville days, Pat Denning, who lurks in the vicinity of the theater. Dorothy wants to be with Pat, but he says there's a name for men who let women support them, and it's not a very nice name, obviously referring to gigolo.

Billy Lawlor, the juvenile lead (Dick Powell), befriends naive newcomer Peggy Sawyer (Ruby Keeler) at a casting call. Peggy, along with women of the world Anytime Annie (Ginger Rogers) and Lorraine (Una Merkel), win places in the chorus. There are plenty of not-so-subtle hints at the casting couch during auditions.

Grueling rehearsals go on and on, and finally, at a drunken cast party, Dorothy makes it clear to Abner that she cannot stand him. He threatens to withdraw his financial support. Dorothy then breaks her ankle. Marsh is desperate when he realizes that he is going to lose his leading lady and his financial backing.

At some point off-screen, Anytime Annie steps in as Abner's new companion, so the financing is saved. Abner wants Annie to take Dorothy's place, but Annie insists that Marsh give Dorothy's role to Peggy Sawyer. With less than 24 hours to go before the Philadelphia opening, Marsh pushes Peggy to the point of collapse. Marsh's famous line is, ""Sawyer, you're going out there a youngster but you've got to come back a star."" The less-famous lead-in is Marsh telling Peggy that  that all the money invested in the show and 200 jobs are riding on Peggy's back--a rather large burden for a frightened chorus girl with no prior experience.

There's a lot of sex in 42nd Street (off-screen of course, this is not Last Tango in Paris), not much of it motivated by love. There's a lot of fear. The film ends not with the performers' triumph, but with a shot of an utterly spent Julian Marsh sitting at the bottom of the fire escape outside the theater, watching the crowds go by and listening to them discount his role in the show's success. It's hard to think of a less escapist musical made between 1930 and 1960.

It may not be escapist, but 42nd Street is an excellent movie. The Busby Berkeley production numbers (often sexually suggestive and dark in theme) induce jaw-dropping. The Warren & Dubin songs have some clever lyrics and really stick in your head. Dick Powell charms, singing and handling his light comedy well. Ruby Keeler is a barely adequate singer, and her clogging dance style is not much appreciated today, but she's so appealing it doesn't matter. Ginger Rogers and Una Merkle provide expert comic relief. The off-stage business moves along briskly.

42nd Street is the original mold for the backstage musical film. I actually prefer this to musicals where the characters in lumber camps or city streets burst into song and dance for no apparent reason. In 42nd Street, the musical numbers make sense because the characters are directing, producing, auditioning for, rehearsing for, putting on, a Broadway musical show. As an imdb reviewer commented, complaining that 42nd Street has too many cliches is like complaining that Shakespeare has too many quotes. Even if you don't care for musicals as a genre, this holds such a significant place in American film history that it's worth a look for any film lover.

Other recommended Warner Brother's musicals of this era: From the pre-Code era: Gold Diggers of 1933 and Footlight Parade (watch for the National Recovery Act support--coming from Jack Warner, a lifelong Republican but ardent supporter of the New Deal). Post-code Dames and Gold Diggers of 1935 are a bit more fluffy, but have some hilarious comedy and more phenomenal musical numbers. These five films are available as a boxed set with a sixth disc containing musical numbers only. Warning: Some of these movies contain material featuring small-person actor Billy Barty that seems in bad taste today, and African-Americans are portrayed as grinning menials. The period-era cartoons on the DVDs contain ethnic stereotypes which Warners's on-screen commentary acknowledges to be offensive and wrong but typical of the era.",1248652800,,5648,5.017075773745998

It was certainly of its time but so smart and funny in a totally uncorny way.  All the stars are first rate.  I disagree with some of the reviewers who complain that Keeler couldn't act and that her dancing was clunky.  Others have explained her wooden-shoe style and its origins in the speakeasies of the day.  I found her youth and lack of sophistication to be perfect for the role.  She held her own with a lot of more experienced actors, just as her character did....and came out a star.  I thorougly enjoyed her in every scene.  William Powell, looking very average-boy-next-door, was her perfect counterpart.

Careers, lives, relationships and fortunes are all riding on the success of Pretty Lady. When the leading lady breaks her leg before the opening, newcomer Ruby Keeler is cast as the lead, right out of the chorus line.

The dialogue is snappy and sometimes surprisingly suggestive for the era. But, the best part is the twenty minutes of musical production numbers.

You felt that with a little help, and a bit of practice, you might be up there with them yourself. At the same time, you knew that you couldn't. Ginger was the tops. A stellar comedienne.

382967,5,6301964217,"42nd Street remains of the great classic musicals to this day. As Amazon correctly notes, this movie was blazing hot stuff at the time it was released; but the storyline makes this movie great entertainment even in these times. The plot moves along at a good pace and the action holds your attention rather well. I enjoyed it and I can easily tell you why.

The movie begins with a new stage show about to be cast by director Julian Marsh (Warner Baxter) because his bosses Jones and Barry think they can squeeze out another hit show despite the Great Depression putting a damper on everyone's bank accounts. Julian assembles his team of troupers including Bebe Daniels as the huge Broadway star Dorothy Brock; Ruby Keeler playing Peggy Sawyer, the chorus girl who just barely makes it into the show and actor Billy Lawler who is played very ably by Dick Powell. You should also look for Ginger Rogers in an early screen appearance as chorus line girl ""Anytime"" Annie and Guy Kibbee plays Abner Dillon, the wealthy old man who is funding the show on the condition that Dorothy Brock, his love interest, stars in the show.

Julian begins to run his troupe to death and it seems he never is satisfied with their work; to add some drama to his role Julian is under doctor's orders to abstain from theater work for health reasons. Julian, however, goes ahead and runs the show as the director anyway. Dorothy Brock also begins to encounter trouble as stuffy old man Abner Dillon wants more and more romantic time with her; but what Dorothy truly wants is to spend time with the real love of her life, Pat Denning (George Brent). Ruby tries to hang in during Julian's grueling rehearsals; she almost doesn't make it but she ultimately survives the torture.

Of course, despite the real movie--which consists of the song and dance numbers--you get a fair amount of suspense to hold your attention. Will Dorothy stay true to Abner so that her career can go forward to even new heights? Will Dorothy go back to Pat Denning, her true love, instead? What happens when for unforeseen circumstances develop and Peggy Sawyer must perform the lead in the show--with a mere five hours advance notice? Can Peggy pull that off? Can Julian direct the show without losing his health altogether? Watch the film and find out as you enjoy it--no spoilers here, folks! SMILE

Then there are the song and dance numbers. I loved all of them. The musical arrangements by Harry Warren glisten as true gold ever could. You get a great duet for ""I'm Young And Healthy;"" and there's the classic ""Shuffle Off To Buffalo."" Of course we can't forget the show stopping ""42nd Street"" either. Excellent! The choreography really shines during these musical numbers with great aerial views of the cast on stage and the dancing couldn't be better. Great!

The DVD comes with a few extras; and they also were fascinating to watch. I liked the segment about Harry Warren with him playing piano while his friends sing along; and the featurette entitled A Trip Through A Hollywood Studio fascinates me, too. The Hollywood newsreel is a rare treat!

Overall, fans of musicals from the Great Depression era and the golden age of Hollywood will cherish this classic musical. The actors work so hard; and it shows in their highly convincing acting. People who enjoy the music of Harry Warren will be delighted with this movie; and the Busby Berkeley dance numbers reflect his genius as they always did.

May you get this movie and enjoy it as much as I did! Great job, everyone!!!",1179446400,,3533,4.716369529983792
382968,4,6301964217,"There have been so many excellent reviews of this landmark film that there is not much to add so here are a few observations about the film and the extras:

- The film has a dark and sombre mood which is unexpected and surprising.  The backstage glimpses have a harshness and the comedy is very sharp and venal - nothing light and frothy here.
- Warner Baxter and Bebe Daniels had at least 10 years experience behind them when they made the film and their performances have great depth.  Baxter portrays a very sick man and Daniels captures the prospect of being over the hill movingly.
- Ruby Keeler's ingenuousness maybe real but the casting makes her perfect here. Never was such blank innocence so convincing which explains why her reviews at the time were so good. It was only as her career progressed that her limitations became obvious, although she always improved. Her tap dancing is a legacy of a different style from heavy shoes and timber floored speakeasies when she really had ""to put 'em down"" to be heard. Later in the decade, her tap lightened up.
- Dick Powell is also perfectly cast and his devilish way with the lyrics of ""Young and Healthy"" suggest an active libido. He is underrated.

The print of the film is excellent but Warner's seemed to have messed up the extra features.  The documentary on this film appears on the DVD of ""Goldiggers of 1933"" with a short on the promotion of the film when Warner's hired a train, the 42nd Street Special, to cross America to reach Washington for President Roosevelt's birthday.  What remains is a poor short film on Harry Warren, who wrote the songs, and other shorts promoting Warner Brothers which in fact were made 2 years later and refer to other musicals. It is all a bit confusing.

Unless you purchase this DVD as part of the Busby Berkeley set, the DVD is only OK value.",1170374400,,1842,4.580547112462006

movie!""

  Innovative in the sense that at the beginning.....the main actresses and actors are shown in large individual photos accompanied by very
beautiful background music composed by Harry Warren.
  The Plot was exciting and entertaining since it concerned and developed
the real problems intrinsic to producing, developing, and directing a
winning musical/dancing/acting/and choreographed ensemble!
  The ""Kingpins""in bringing this whole thing to reality were:
  Warner Baxter....Director/Slavedriver
  Busby Berkeley...Master Choreographer/Director
  Bebe Daniels.....terrific Singer...Actress...Dancer
  Prominent Cast Members...Ruby Keeler..Ginger Rogers..Dick Powell
  ...and others listed in opening credits!
  Harry Warren /Al Dubin...provided music and lyrics for:
  "" 42nd St""...""Young and Healthy""..""Shuffle
  off to Buffalo""..""You're Getting To Be A Habit
  With Me!""

  ""Chorus Girls"" were extremely talented ladies!....they had to
  be... since this was 1933 and the country was
  in a big Depression! Jobs were scarcer than ""Hen's
  Teeth!"" 5,000 fully experienced and talented
ladies tried out for the Chorus Girl positions...only 200 or 4% survived!
  A good bit of pleasure can be derived from the movie...not just as you see it.....but afterwards!
  The probability is that you'll be humming, whistling, or even singing
some of the tunes after seeing this movie.
  The one song that lends itself especially to the above symptoms is:
  ""You're Getting to be a Habit with me!"" Personally...I think this is one of the best songs that I've heard in a long time.!
  It's a real blessing that this 73 year old movie can now be viewed on
DVD with exacting clarity and superior sound!

382970,3,6301964217,"This is considered one of the best and well-known of the Busby Berkeley  films with the cute-and-likable Ruby Keeler making it winsome. She and the rest of the cast, with the exception of a loud and obnoxious Warner Baxter, were fun to watch. So were all the women in here,showing a surprising amount of skin. Had this been made some months later under the new Hays' Code, that skin would have been covered up.

At any rate, for a musical I thought the film was a bit too dialog-oriented. Up until the last 20 minutes, it was too much talk and not enough of the dance numbers. The latter did occur but they were too short.

Only in the last 20 minutes, as seemed to be the routine in the Berkeley films, did we see the extravagant production numbers. The finale is terrific, too. ""You're Getting To Be A Habit With Me,"" ""Shuffle Off To Buffalo,"" and ""42nd Street"" are all great song-and-dance numbers and look just great on DVD. The disc is a notable improvement over the VHS.

Overall, it's a good film with interesting characters and, if you have to patience to wait, a tremendous musical finale.",1145923200,,1098,4.50251256281407
382971,5,6301964217,"The film begins making a clear allusion to these hard years of the Great depression. The process of rehearsal of an ambitious musical that must be premiered in the next five weeks, directed by an inexhaustible man (who is seriously ill and he is aware this production may be the last one).
The great expectations of a provincial girl who dreams to be part of this amazing ensemble convey us to the insights of never ending hours of continuous training for the great day...

A story within a story; a show within a show, a backstage drama with smiling faces and broken hearts. With exciting rehearsals leading to that great, magnificent and overwhelming finale. The sumptuous choreography, admirable and imaginative shots; the cast of ten stars. Bebe Daniels, Warner Baxter, Ruby Keeler, George Brent, Dick Powell, Uka Merkel, Guy Kibbee, George E. Stone, Allen Jenkins and Lyle Talbot. Two hundred beautiful girls on stage, marvelous musical numbers, arresting dance routines, inspiring music, magisterial direction, captivating sequences and a beautiful love story.

Glorious, thrilling and unforgettable. An authentic milestone of the cinema. One of these films you must watch before die.

This film not only catapulted the career of Ginger Rogers the eternal bride of Hollywood during the thirties three years before ""Top hat"" with Fred Astaire. Besides, this film inspired to ""Singing in the rain"" to tell a story within another story and additionally, Bob Fosse would pay a well deserved tribute with ""All that jazz"" four decades later.
But taking into account we are in 1933, the superb special effects and original camera angles for the age, are simply out of this world.

382973,4,6301964217,"First of all, if you are expecting non-stop singing and dancing, you've come to the wrong place.  42nd street is more of a backstage drama enlivened by several songs rather than what you might expect from an all-out musical.  Only at the end does it make---and unabashedly so---a final push to bring down the house, so to speak.  The DVD box headlines Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, but this is a Warner-Baxter-lead ensemble.  Baxter is the star even though Ruby has the spotlight at the end. (No, she isn't the best, as others herein have bemoaned, but the story is supposed to be about someone being in the right place at the right time---not great, but good enough---to be given a shot at becoming a star.  That's how many stars, were in fact made, after all.  Consider this angle of the issue when viewing, consequently.)  George Brent, Guy Kibee, Bebe Daniels, and---my favorite supporting player herein---Ned Sparks, round out the cast.  But this film has more working for it not than just able players and memorable music.  This film is lush, I'd argue; not in drama and/or color---since it's in black & white of course---but lush in light.  The lighting is wonderfully apparent in this film.  The rich black backgrounds in the musical numbers couldn't be any blacker & the whites---blouses, tuxedo jackets, you name it---in contrast couldn't be any more livelier as a result.  As I write this I see a black piano, for instance, filmed from the floor on an angle as Bede Daniels slinks aside it in a long black dress set off with a white top.  Ruby Keeler is similarly arrayed, but in a lush all white dress as she ""shuffles off to Buffalo.""  It's a brilliant film in this regard (pardon the pun); an example how black & white can sometimes best color.  Do consider such when you have a look at this crisply filmed 1933 classic. (Trivial aside: Have a look at Ruby's shoes just after George Brent is punched in the face and notice that soon after---as she is carried by him from a sofa---she is wearing different ones.)

382975,5,6301964217,"42nd Street is the quintessential backstage musical. Both Keeler and Powell are spirited as the juvenile leads, and Baxters predicament gives the film added poignancy. Still, its the culminating dance numbers choreographed by Busby Berkeley that elevate this picture to classic status, along with a period score by Herb Nacio Brown and Arthur Freed, which includes the memorable  ""Shuffle Off to Buffalo,"" and the title tune.",1123632000,,425,5.4393939393939394
383008,5,6301964217,"Peggy Sawyer is a young woman with big wooden slats on her feet who just loves to dance (Ruby Keeler, who plays Peggy with the old style wooden taps on her shoes, had been the protege of the gangster Owney Madden in the Prohibition nightclubs of New York, and it is said that the singer Al Jolson had to pay $100,000 to release Keeler from Madden's ""contract.""

At this distance it's difficult to see what made Ruby Keeler the center of this titanic struggle of lovers' jealousy, but she seems like a nice enough person.  Her famous ""clunky"" style of tap was not her own invention, but she brought the style forward from turn of the century models, giving it a new kick start in some sequences here that look like she's trying to nail down the entire stage floor.  Those who compare her dancing to that of Ginger Rogers are missing the point--actually, they are making an important point in that in this single film we can see several generations of dance styles combine and ignite, Keeler's nightclub stage style, a hangover from vaudeville; Rogers' new, ballroom influenced and infinitely more subtle style (which she gives only hints of in 42nd Street) and the whole dance-non-dance world of Busky Berkeley, the choreographer whose ""girls"" didn't really have to move a step, they can just stand there while the camera travels around them executing the movements, a totally cinematic dance creation which became one of the few original inventions in film in the early 1930s.

Berkeley's massive dance creations look forward in time as well as back (to the stage models of Max Reinhardt and other ""super directors"") and their futuristic qualities are often noted and admired.  It was a style that culminated, oddly enough, in the massed athletes and marchers assembled by Berkeley's admirer, Leni Riefenstahl, in her OLYMPIAD of a few years later.

If they remade this film today they might dress Dick Powell up differently in the scene in which Peggy stumbles into Billy's dressing room, catching him in his underwear; but they couldn't cast a cuter guy or a fresher, more vibrant sexual vibe.  He's fantastic in the film, and he gives Ruby Keeler sex, just as she gives him back her adoration, a mirror of ours.",1121990400,,2214,4.7952755905511815
383009,5,6301964217,"42ND STREET has everything I could ask for in a movie.  Set in the present day (1933) it's a Depression-era behind-the-scenes story of the making of a Broadway musical.  An ensemble piece, it tracks a number of story lines at once - Broadway star `Dot' Brock (the beautiful Bebe Daniels) and her ever-present sugar daddy, the production's angel. wonderfully played by Guy Kibbee.  The down-but-not-out director Julian Marsh (Warner Baxter), for whom this play is a lifeline (`You guys ever hear of Wall Street?' Marsh asks when queried about his desire to direct this play, that being `nuff said in those days.) The sweet ingnue Peggy Sawyer and her numerous beaux and faux beaux.  Peggy Sawyer is played by Ruby Keeler, who was a wonderful dancer and an acceptable singer, but an enormously untalented actress.  There are, as well, various and sundry chorus girls, singers, and hangers-on.

  How good is this movie?  Baxter and Daniels are incredibly good and more than cancel out Keeler's performance.  The last twenty-minutes or so are devoted to Busby Berkeley dance numbers, and they don't rise above the movie.  The dialogue is great, ranging from the slightly risqu - said of Anytime Annie (Ginger Rogers as a veteran chorus girl) when she's first introduced, ""She only said `No' once, and then she didn't hear the question"", to the self-deprecating - when the lead singer played by Dick Powell introduces himself to the Ruby Keeler character, he says ""I'm Billy Lawler, one of Broadway's better juveniles"", to the surreal - an observation by slightly tipsy co-producer Thomas Barry (Ned Sparks) on Angel Abner Dillon (Kibbee), ""He looks like a Bulgarian boll-weevil mourning his first born.""  And it has some great songs by Harry Warren, not only the title song, but other hits such as `Shuffle Off to Buffalo' and `You're Getting to Be a Habit With Me.'

  From its touches of gritty realism to its bubbly song-and-dance routines to its near tragic final shot of an exhausted and spent Warren Baxter `celebrating' his success, I loved every minute of 42ND STREET.  My favorite scene was when the best actor in the movie - Baxter - has to coax, shake, or kiss a passable performance out of the worst actor in the movie - Keeler in `the understudy's big chance' scene in act three.  It was terribly self-referential, but at least the two kept a straight face throughout.

  The transfer print was in very good shape and easy to watch.  There's no commentary track but there are plenty of extras - A text only cast and crew listing, with an a open out page on the Career Highlights of Busby Berkeley; a nine-minute, 1933 Vitaphone short entitled `Harry Warner: America's Foremost Composer' with Warner at the piano surround by gowns and tuxedoes, the short features a medley of Warner hits circa 1933, including a '`42nd Street' production number; a ten minute short titled `Trip Through a Hollywood Studio,' standard behind-the-scenes stuff, ""Allow us to bring Hollywood to you...""; a 9-minute Hollywood newsreel of the period featuring a lot of Hollywood stars, and plenty of their pets, too; and a theatrical trailer.  The highest recommendation for this essential video.",1120262400,,3181,4.951035781544256
383010,4,6301964217,"42nd Street is the story of the process of making a musical. The director is a famous but dying man. He decides to put on a forgettable title although it might mean the death of him. It stars Bebe Daniels' character who hides her real lover from her benefactor who determines the fate of her career. There is also Ruby Keeler's innocent character who almost doesn't make it as a chorus girl but who ends up the star when Daniels' character breaks her ankle. Dick Powell is Keeler's love interest. In the end, the show goes on with much anxiety shared by all.

Thanks to the time in which it was made, the dialogue is snappy and somewhat racy at times, exemplified in lines like, ""Not Anytime Annie? Sure! Who could forget her? She only said no once, and then she didn't hear the question.""

Also a credit to the film is how sophisticated it is considering its age. In 1933, many films were still trying to adjust to sound and were often stationary because of microphone placement. This film was not hindered.

This film has not suffered from age as one might expect. The print used for this DVD is relatively clear aside from a scene near the end in which Bebe Daniels confronts Ruby Keeler after Keeler has taken the lead part.

All of the cast does well with their roles aside from Keeler. Perhaps the casting director thought that her dancing would make up for her acting or that since she was playing a new-comer, she did not need acting ability. Thanks to this, however, the film suffers. When Bebe Daniels or Dick Powell deliver a fine chunk of dialogue, Keeler jumps in with overly enthusiastic quips that change the mood and film from realistic to amateurish.

The music in this film is fun and a highlight of the film. In fact, the music makes the end of the movie with three well done numbers: Shuffle Off to Buffalo, Young and Healthy, and the title song 42nd Street. Each are graced with Busby Berkeley's distinct style and make an excellent finale. The attention to detail makes the visuals that go along with the music incredible; the sets and the costumes are well coordinated. Another credit to the music is the way in which it is presented. Too many musicals feature songs that are not really prompted by real-life events. The actors just burst into song but don't seem to have reason to. 42nd Street is not one of those films. The actors sing because they are putting on a show; the film is completely realistic (aside from Keeler's acting) and therefore is much more likable than the mainstream musical.",1119139200,,2522,4.570796460176991
383011,4,6301964217,"If your knowledge of ""42nd Street"" comes from seeing the stage musical, you'll be surprised to find how much less of a musical the film actually is, and how much darker it is than its stage counterpart. The spectre of the Great Depression pervades every frame of the film. These Broadway hoofers never once look like they're enjoying themselves; instead, they look like any other group of factory or assembly workers, desperately holding on to the job they have no matter how miserable it may be.

Busby Berkeley's groundbreaking choreography bursts on to the screen late in the film in a couple of dazzling production numbers. Though actually there is something disturbing about his obsession (and the entire film's obsession) with objectifying women until they are nearly indistinguishable from one another. To the producers of the musical within the film, the women are nothing more than pairs of legs. In the audition scene we are privy to, they select the chorus by asking them to hike up their skirts so that their legs will be more easily visible!! If there are any auditions to actually find out if the women can sing or dance, we don't see them. And again, in Berkeley's dance numbers, the women become little more than individual body parts, swirling around in kaleidoscopic images that blur one into the next.

These early Depression-era musicals are known for launching the career of Ruby Keeler, but I was quite taken aback by how awful she is. She can't act, and her dancing is atrocious. She clomps around and flails her arms like a chimpanzee impersonating a human. Of the actors, Ginger Rogers makes an impression in a small role as the acerbic Anytime Annie (and get a load of the scene where she insists that Ruby Keeler take on the lead role in the musical, because she can dance rings around poor Ginger....yeah, right). Bebe Daniels and George Brent do well with their parts, and Warner Baxter serves up the ham and gets to deliver the film's most famous line.

I know this review sounds more critical than positive, but I actually enjoyed this film very much. It's corny, silly and melodramatic to be sure, but it's also earnest and well crafted. It's a fascinating slice of film history and one that any serious film buff should see.

Unlike alot of musicals that came before or after you can really feel the grind that goes into a production like this.  The film takes you from the genesis of a Broadway musical to it's opening night and you can taste the blood,sweat, tears, and sawdust that go into such an undertaking.  In between there are the various backstage melodramas, some tedious, ultimately forgivable because the end result is a show that makes your jaw drop.  We are to thank the many talented dancers and singers as well as choreographer Busby Berkley and songwriters Harry Warren and Al Dubin for this.  The film is distinguished with a decent cast that is led by a remarkable performance by Warner Baxter as the show's driven director.

Juat a quick note to let you know that you comment on ruby keeler's tap dancing , Ruby's ""Style"" was from a school of tap that did not have metal taps on the heels or toes of the shoe,  Ruby had wood soles across the entire bottom of the shoe,hence the ""clunkley"" style. As such, it is a bit tough to perform the fast paced lighter styles.  This was the accepted style up to that time. Ginger Rodgers and others came along and did wonders with what they invented too! Ruby was one of the first to bring tap to it's zenith & deserves to be recongnized for her efforts.",1097452800,,685,4.253846153846154

I wish there was a video or DVD of the 1980s version. Sigh.

However, the movie wasn't bad. The B&W picture transfer was so good I forgot about it after a while.  But still missed the two most memorable songs I associate with the show.",1097366400,,469,4.458823529411765
383017,5,6301964217,"this is one of my all time favorite movies. I think that the humor is wonderful, and the cast, sining and dancing are just fine. Ruby Keeler is simply adorable as Peggy Sawyer, Bebe Daniels is rightly used as the fading star, Warner Baxter, Ned Sparks, and Guy Kibbee make the most of their parts. Una Merkel is ducky as wisecracking Larraine, and a scene stealing Ginger Rogers is a gem. ALthough I loved her in dramatic roles, stright comedy, and with Fred Astaire, there's something about the way she examplifies a wisecracking-secondlead-chorine that is just so wonderful. I believe that this is one of Ginger's best performances, that  goes for the whole cast. A similar film with mostly the same cast, (Ginger, Guy, Ned, Ruby, and Dick Powell, and chorus dancers) and the same famous Busby Berkeley overhead shots, watch Goldiggers of 1933. I think that these two are some of the funniest musicals ever made.",1086739200,,914,4.821656050955414

383061,5,6301964217,"Nothing makes an economically blighted population forget their financial woes (other than getting a job) than by seeing and hearing a rousing movie.  In 1933, director Lloyd Bacon and choreographer Busby Berkely combined to make the quintessential musical in 42ND STREET, which set the standard for all future musicals with its original mixture of song, dance, camera angles, and co-ordinated mass leg kicking.  The hero is a  robust ensemble of singers and dancers who showcase their talents singly and collectively.  Julian Marsh (Warner Baxter) is the martinet director of a Broadway musical who puts his troupe through their paces like a Marine drill instructor.  His lead dancer Dorothy Brock (Bebe Daniels) has a drinking problem and is pressured to date the lecherous backer Abner Dillon (Guy Kibbee) who wants more than a financial return on his investment.  Peggy Sawyer (Ruby Keeler) is pulled out of the chorus line to replace Miss Brock, who suffers a sprained ankle on opening night.  Pat Denning (George Brent) flits back and forth between Miss Brock and Miss Sawyer.  All of these personal entaglements are merely glue to hold the story together so that the last ten minutes of the film can be seen as a miniaturized version of the musical.  This conclusion is more like a play within a play.  The sets and choreography are so astounding that one wonders how the choreographers managed to simulate the vast geographical essence that is New York City.  The props are huge, but then so is the talent of the cast in front of them.  In addition to the song and dance routines, the interaction of the cast catches the eye even when the songs catch the ear.  Of particular note is the competition between Ruby Keeler and Bebe Daniels for George Brent.  Guy Kibbee is comical as the letch who thinks his money will buy the charms of Miss Daniels.  And then there is Warner Baxter, whose only wish is to put on a hit show, at the conclusion of which he hangs around outside the theater, listening to the comments of the exiting patrons who praise the new star (Keeler) but lambast himself.  It is odd that a movie that delivers so rousingly with bright sound and starry song should end on such a mute note.  Unless, of course, the director wanted to show that for all the rehearsed action of a play, there must come a time when the cast needs quiet to take stock of their endeavors.  Films like 42ND STREET continually serve to remind us that the enduring legacy of music sometimes occurs only after the curtain closes.",1030233600,,2526,4.754587155963303
383062,4,6301964217,"""42nd Street"" is truly one of the all-time great movie musicals. It was seen when first released, as a gritty back-stage look inside what ""really"" happens durning the preparations of a Broadway play.
 What is truly amazing about this film, is after some 70 years, ""42nd Street"" is still a dazzler. It still possess such charm and elegance that to be honest, not even the Broadway musical could beat it!
 ""42nd Street"" tells the story of a young novice chorus girl, Peggy Sawyer (Ruby Keeler) whom is trying to get in her first
Broadway play. She dreams of the bright lights of Broadway, and her name flashing high above. Sawyer will go into that play a youngster and has to come back a star. ""42nd Street"" throws in a lot of sub-plots dealing with most of it's main characters who include; Bebe Daniels, George Brent, Dick Powell, Ginger Rogers (Before she got her big break that same year in ""Flyin' Down to Rio w\ a then unknown Fred Astaire!), Una Merkel, Guy Kibbee and of course Warner Baxter who plays Julian Marsh, the director of the play. But, none of these sub-plots throw the film off-track. They merely give the film more ""color"". By the end of the film all the sub-plots coincide with one another.
 Another star of the movie I forgot to mention is of course the music itself composed by Harry Warren. The songs include; ""You're Getting To Be A Habbit With Me"", ""Shuffle off to Buffalo"", ""Young & Healthy"", and ""42nd Street"". It's in ""42nd Street"" that we see Ruby Keeler show us her steps. While many people today might not be impressed with it, there's something about her, that always holds my interest.
 If you've never seen this film before, it really is a must. If you've already seen it, there's no harm in watching it again!
 Bottom-line:This Oscar nominated musical is one of the best of it's day. Unforgettable songs, wonderful dancing by Ruby Keeler, and all around charm have made this film a classic!",1029715200,,1925,4.633431085043989

I wonder how this would sound if it was rechanneled to 5.1 using todays technology. All in all this is a masterpiece of a film, the production numbers from the master and the wonderful talent of Ruby Keeler, Warner Baxter and Bebe Daniels are priceless.

383064,5,6301964217,"This was the film that saved musicals, Thanks to Busby Berkeley. This film is certainly a musical classic. This is the film that saved musicals thanks to Busby Berkeley. Won't tell you everything, But I'll tell the highlights. The songs are beautiful, Great musical scores. I don't care what generation your from, if you love good music, this film is it. The attractive Bebe Daniels sings ""You're Getting To Be A Habit With Me"". Ruby Keeler does some good dancing for that era I guess, most people today wouldn't think much of it today, but that era loved it, because she was the first tap dance star, its not Eleanor Powell or Ginger Rogers dancing but its good. This movie basically is about what truly goes on behind the curtains of broadway and they certainly had the right people to be in the movie, because all were in Broadway so it was easy for them to betray it. A tempermental almost abusive director Mr. Marsh(Warner Baxter). A tempermental star who breaks her ankle by being drunk then Peggy Sawyer gets to replace Ms. Dorothy Brock, but before she gets to be a star Mr. Marsh who practices her to death 5 hours before the show, she almost gives up but in Mr. Marsh own way tries to persuade her to do it. I like the scene where Mrs Burke walks in on Peggy Sawyer(Ruby Keeler) people think she's going to hurt her but she doesn't, she actually wants her to do good, and tells her ""You Go Out There and Be So Grand, That It'll Make Me Hate You."" Another Great scene is before she goes on stage Mr. Marsh tells her ""You're Going Out A Youngster But You'll Come Back A Star"" words to live by.
Great songs sung by Dick Powell ""Young and Healthy"". Ruby Keeler sings Shuffle off to Buffalo, and she sings and taps to 42nd Street. Great Dancers, Beautiful Platinum Blondes, and Great Million Dollar Legs. Broadway really hasn't changed much since then. The ending of the movie is great when Mr. Marsh the director goes outside at the end of the show where the people are leaving, and with a cigarette he acts like a bum or is acting like he's waiting for somebody, but really he's listening to what people is saying about his show under disguise, he hears great reviews, and after all the people leave, he sits down and look like he's really satisfied and no other scene could end the movie better. Movies back then knew how to tell stories with looks, and as Barbara Stanwyck put it told stories with their eyes, If words were spoken it would of messed up the ending,  a lot of films are destroyed by spoken words instead of showing the eyes, feelings, and the surroundings. This film wouldn't of been complete without Ginger Rogers(Anytime Annie) and Una Merkel(Loretta) with their screwball, zany, free-spirited, sassy attitude. Ginger Rogers doesn't do much dancing, she doesn't get top billing, but is seen and heard, I wonder why she didn't get the leading part that Ruby Keeler played, she would of really made it a smash, but this is before the Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire years. Ruby Keeler went on to do other great musicals Golddiggers of 1933, Footlight Parade, Dames, Flirtation Walk-These films had Busby Berkeley magic touch also, but first see 42nd Street it was her first film, and not too many actress with no acting experience has a smash movie with their first, but see this first, then see the next one, and the next one, you gotta go in order, before any of those films, each film gets better and better, but 42nd Street you have to see first, then you'll understand Ruby Keeler's acting and what she's capable of. Each movie is better with more beautiful girls, great songs, great dance scenes, but you gotta start with the first. Ruby Keeler won the hearts of millions after this film even though her singing wasn't the greatest, and her dancing wasn't breath-taking. But she had something, and she'll always be remembered as the first tap-dancing star. Hope my review helped you, Won't tell you everything, it'll spoiled for you.",1021248000,,3962,4.603960396039604

Musicals had run there toll with the primitive sound systems & frozen camera shots.  Along comes Warner Brothers Studios, ""42nd Street"" script, Harry Warren / Al Dubin delightful songs, Busby Berkelry dance choreographer (predessor to Bob Fosse)larger than life dance productions & a budget of $400,000 (unheard of for musicals, especially during the depression).  The results a revolutionary film that set the standards for the ""Hollywood Musicals"" forever.  Note: Berkeley revolultionized Hollywood musicals in the 1930's & 40', staging elaborate dance productions with scores of dancers. Creating massive geometric dance routines with his patented ""top shot"" (overhead) & arial shots moving the camera from the floor creating many new & unique camera angles forever changing the way movies especially,  musicals were filmed.
Now this great Warner Brothers musical has been digitally restored & transferred to DVD with outstanding viewing & listening quality!!!  Excellent DVD package with several extras capturing the behind the scenes & backlot Warner Brothers Studios segments.
Summary: The story focuses on a hopeful & sincere starlet played by Ruby Keeler (her film debut from Broadway), who is initially cast as a nameless chorus girl.  She wins us over & we are therefore involved in the film as she stuggles to ""make it"" in the glorious world of show business.  With a great 30's supporting cast, a great musical score by Warren/Dubin, Dance choreography by Busby Berkeley we have a very entertaining movie musical.  (Watch for a young Ginger Rogers as another supporting chorus girl).

Kalaidoscope dance effects, Production numbers to end all production numbers, and a score filled with great songs. Prior to 42nd St. film musicals were mostly just songs or skits linked together, with little or no story line at all. In fact, much of the time, due to early techniques, they were crude by comparison to non-musical films, the dificulty in recording such large casts onto film at the time. While 42nd St. can be a bit hard to listen to, advances in sound techniques at the time solved much of these problems, and this release of 42nd St. is by far the best sounding release I've ever heard of this film.

Dick Powell to Ruby Keeler as they admit their love for one another in the great ""42nd Street"".  This is one of my favorite movies, for a variety of reasons. Probably first and foremost, is Warner Baxter, playing the ruthless director Julian Marsh, who lost all his dough in the Crash and has got to have one last hit show before he either cracks up or drops dead. He stomps around the stage and hurls invective at the ensemble, and not being there myself, I love every minute of it. Then there's star Bebe Daniels and her boytoy George Brent, who are pulling the wool over the eyes of numbskull Broadway show backer Guy Kibbee. In the ranks of the chorus are Ginger Rogers and Una Merkel, two platinum blondes made of brass. Dick Powell is also a-one as the Juvenile Lead. So who's not so hot? Why, Ruby Keeler of course, only the ingenue star of the movie. Oy, just try to look around her, and you'll be okay.  Harry Warren's score is fabulous, with the famous title song as well as ""Shuffle Off to Buffalo"" and ""Getting to be a Habit with Me"", as well as some nice instrumental work. And of course there's the maniacal choreography of Busby Berkely, with living kaleidoscopes galore.

383106,5,6301964217,"42nd Street, released in 1933, was the first successful early musical.  Busby Berkeley, a Broadway-Hollywood transplant, was the musical director for this masterpiece. His avant-garde style was showcased by the musical scenes.  He uses many different camera shots, and wild, geometric props to put together a remarkable effect.  These sensational visual effects are prominent in the title music score, ""42nd Street"".  This song has surpassed the test of time, and has become a classic work, perhaps better known than the film itself. The camera execution in 42nd Street is very modern.  The camera no longer stands still, fixed on the main characters, and ignoring its ability to change the entire scene, mood, and film, by purely making the camera mobile.  This advance allows for a free-spirited, well-flowing film.  It is no longer a stationary and trite film, lacking human emotion, but a film that flows as the human spirit, and essentially evoking the emotions that it attempts to. While 42nd Street has its carefree musical numbers, it is also true to its time period.  42nd Street does not ignore the fact that it was filmed in the midst of the Depression.  In fact, it embraces it, and uses it tactfully in the plot.  However, the escapist musical numbers evoke the same attempt at escaping the problems of the day. These problems were plaguing the people and, hence, part of the reason 42nd Street was so successful.",993600000,,1426,5.004237288135593

Though the jokes may be corny and the sexual innuendoes stale by 21st century standards, I found myself laughing at loud and thoroughly enjoying  the dazzling camera tricks and kaleidoscopic overhead shots. But one of the best treats of all was watching the greats from a bygone era performing at the peak of their careers.  Warner Baxter is superb as the director desperate to produce a hit while Guy Kibbee shines as the lecherous producer.  Bebe Daniels is memorable as the leading lady who twists her ankle on opening night and Ruby Keeler, in her movie debut, is the spunky girl plucked from the chorus line to save the show.

383109,5,6301964217,"The surreal parts are the Busby Berkeley numbers and the corn is everything else. One of the funniest moments in the movie is when Ginger Rogers tells Warner Baxter that Ruby Keeler is the person who should star in the big show -- Rogers was incomperably more talented that Keeler at both singing and dancing (it's almost painful to watch Keeler stomp around staring at her feet), but she plays the (already at that time) cliche of the good girl getting a big break charmingly in spite of her many limitations as a performer. (Just for the record, Rogers wasn't my favorite musical star; while quite talented, her shortcomings as a dancer were all too evident when dancing with Fred Astaire, but then so were almost everyone's...)
There are any number of later musicals that parodied this one to good effect, but my two favorites are the ""Baxter's Beauties"" segment of ""Movie, Movie"" and ""The Band Wagon"". The former is a straight parody, so the connection is easy to see, but I consider the latter a parody, too, in that in neither this movie nor ""The Band Wagon"" is it possible to imagine a single Broadway show having the bizarre collection of musical numbers used in either movie. I consider this to be one of the funniest running jokes in ""The Band Wagon"", and while this goofiness is true of all of the Busby Berkeley musicals I've ever seen, I think of this as the definitive one.(However, ""Gold Diggers of 1933"" is, to my mind, the most spectacularly insane of his movies.)",970790400,,1481,4.656488549618321

There's not much to  the story, but the backstage action is fun to watch.  The musical numbers  really are an eyeful, and I can see why Berkeley has the reputation he has.  There are some great lines (most supplied by Ginger Rogers as  ""Anytime Annie""), and the acting really isn't important, so  there's not much to say.  I enjoyed the title song, plus a few others.  I  have one complaint:  Ruby Keeler.  It's a real stretch for the imagination  to believe that Broadway would have cheered her as a great new star.  She  was a clunky dancer, and not exactly a vocal wonder, either.

383149,5,6301964217,"""42nd Street"" is still the funniest, sexiest and most exciting movie musical ever to come out of Hollywood.
Don't expect to see a string of elaborate production numbers strung together by little whisps of plot.  ""42nd Street"" is actually a comedy-drama about the tribulations  of creating a Broadway show and was made before the Hay's Office really got  its claws into Hollywood.  The movie is peppered with cynacism and risquee  lines.  When the production numbers finally come, they're icing on the  cake.
The only weak point is of course Ruby Keeler.  It's almost an in  joke when the Ginger Roger's character - Any Time Annie - (""she only  said 'no' once and that's because she hadn't heard the question"")  bravely gives up the starring role to Keeler's character.  Ginger Rogers  had more talent in her small toe than Ruby Keeler had in both of her two  clutzy feet, but who cares?  Even Ruby's jumping around the stage has an  endearing quality.
While there are only a few Busby Berkley numbers,  they're all gems.  Especially:

I highly recommend 42nd Street for those who have a deep appreciation for the old classics.",1513123200,,743,4.723076923076923

""42nd Street"" is one of those formula rival substitutes for the overbearing star formula chorus line movies that you see over and over. However it is old enough that this could have been the prototype for such movies as ""Down to Earth"" (1947). This must have been made shortly after talkies appeared ad they advertise it as one of the best movies since Warner Brothers made talkies. The story was adapted from a novel by Bradford Ropes.

It is interesting to see all the references to the ""Great Depression"" in the script and even the music.

A cute chorus girl Dorothy Brock (Bebe Daniels) smarms an old rich coot into financing a musical comedy and making her the star. The producer Julian Marsh (Warner Baxter) is economically poor due to the depression and has a nerves condition that makes this his last and imperatively good production. Others in the production range from old troopers to firs timers.

Most of the film is constant practicing in the day and deceit in the evening.

This film is good enough to place names next to the pictures of the actors and you will recognize many personalities form the period for example:

Warner Baxter
Bebe Daniels
George Brent
Ruby Keeler
Guy Kibbee
Una Merkel
Ginger Rogers
Ned Sparks
Dick Powell
Allen Jenkins
Edward J. Nugent
Robert McWade
George E. Stone

There are many good Songs peppered throughout the film such as:
""It Must Be June""
""Shuffle Off to Buffalo""
""Young and Healthy""
""42nd Street""

If you cotton to Harry Warren songs you may want to find the album ""The Song Is Harry Warren""

We can all sit back with your popcorn and become part of 42nd street.",1508198400,,1654,4.636986301369863
7817441,5,6301964217,"I love 1930s and 1940s films. This was the first of the 4 fabulous Busby Berkely films starring the wonderful Ruby Keeler, the others being Dames, Gold diggers, and Footlight parade. Busby had many other films after that including the very nice Gold diggers 35 and 37, the fantastic Judy Garland/ Mickey Rooney films, and the great Esther Williams water ballets. Alot of great characters in this film included Warner Baxter as the ailing, hard driving director who was told by his doctor that he may not have long to go so he decides that he'll stop at nothing to make this show successful.  Dick Powell is here as a juvenile lead, Guy Kibby as the older funder of the production, and then there's pretty and kniving star lead Bebe Daniels (who could get quite bullheaded) . Then we meet wonderful sweet Ruby, the quirky fabulous Una Merkel, and cute charming Ginger Rogers (Anytime Annie, who only said no once when not hearing the question). Una looked sorta different here from some of her other films such as ""Born to dance"" and ""Broadway melody 36"",  but she was still very pretty. So was Ginger, who this and Gold diggers 33 were her first films before teaming up with Astaire. The good part of the film focuses on  Warner frustratingly getting the girls to get their performances top notch, and Ruby passing out once from being overworked (and underfed too I'm sure, those Broadway directors back then put their dancers on strict diets. They did it to Judy Garland too). Ruby and another juvenile lead George Brent struck up sort of a romance, this was the only Busby film Ruby was in where she had a fling with someone other than with Dick Powell. George also is admired by Bebe, who ends up in a confrontation with Ruby over him. There are two songs I liked that weren't in the big show numbers, ""It must be June"" (that Warner changed his mind about wanting in the show because it was too old (went all the way back to 1904) and he didn't want to put on a revival), and there was the unnamed number that the girls danced fast to several times (the one where Ruby passed out on). The four show numbers were great, ""You're getting to be a habit with me"", ""Shuffle off to Buffalo"", ""You're young and healthy"", and the title song ""42nd St"" especially the last moment of the title song. They were wonderful, I loved them.",1505779200,,2325,4.530952380952381

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The liveliest and one of the most tuneful screen musical comedies that has come out of Hollywood. The story is an adaptation of Bradford Ropes's novel of the same name, and the songs having been contributed by Al Dubin and Harry Warren. Although it has its artfully serious moments, it is for the most part a merry affair and in it Ruby Keeler makes her motion picture d&eacute;but. Her ingratiating personality, coupled with her dances and songs adds to the zest of this offering. It is a film which reveals the forward strides made in this particular medium since the first screen musical features came to Broadway.

Here we have Hollywood and Warner Bros. Studios conjures New York City to wonderful effect in 42nd Street [1933], which has been called ""the virtual debut of the screen musical as a viable force in Hollywood."" On huge sets constructed at the Warner Bros. Studios, director Lloyd Bacon and choreographer Busby Berkeley create their own stylised Manhattan, epitomised by the production number built around the title song. Emerging star Ruby Keeler appears in close-up as she performs a dance routine, and as the camera pulls back she is discovered to be tapping atop a taxi at the intersection of Broadway and 42nd Street. The surrounding skyline suddenly begins to move, as we realise that it is a series of buildings painted on boards held by Busby Berkeley's celebrated dancing girls.

This feature begins cleverly and ends without the usual hugging and kissing scene, for which one can be thankful. Warner Baxter delivers one of the outstanding portrayals of his screen career as Julian Marsh, the stage director of ""Pretty Lady."" Warner Baxter actually gives the impression of a very tired man, exhausted with rehearsals and dissatisfaction with the dancers and others in the show. Bebe Daniels appears as Dorothy Brock, in which she is heard singing from time to time during the preparation of the musical comedy. Una Merkel impersonates a saucy chorus girl who is always ready with a smart retort for any impertinent young man.

The wisecracks are delivered with the necessary flare, and the throng that packed the theatre last night laughed heartily over the misfortunes of Abner Dillon [Guy Kibbee] and the pert comments of various persons. Abner Dillon is a man of means, who has put some $70,000 into the show, chiefly because he is most of the time greatly interested in Dorothy Brock. This young woman happens to be infatuated with Pat Denning, played by George Brent, and after more wine than is good for her she utters some stinging truths. And it is during this sequence that she falls and fractures her ankle. Guy Kibbee is thoroughly believable as the old soak with more dollars than he ought to be trusted with. Ned Sparks, who is seen too rarely in pictures nowadays, does good work as a cigar-chewing theatrical expert. In fact, all those in the cast do very well.

Busby Berkeley, who also designed many of the sets used in his numbers, brought a scale to the film musical that was truly gargantuan, involving hundreds of dancers moving in unison with all manner of props through fantastic environments. In one number for 42nd Street he created three enormous cylindrical turntables, each higher than the next, that spun in opposite directions as an army of chorus girls tapped on the discs.

42nd Street, which follows a Broadway musical from casting call to opening night, became a landmark film that turned the tide for the movie musical. At the time, the genre had slipped in popularity due to overexposure after numerous attempts to duplicate the success of MGM's Oscar-winning The Broadway Melody [1929]. But 42nd Street, which won an Oscar nomination as Best Picture, helped Warner Bros. emerge as a major force in film production and established Busby Berkeley as the ""mad genius"" of musical production numbers. ""A lot of people used to believe I was crazy,"" Berkeley would later admit. ""But I can truthfully say one thing: I gave 'em a show!""

Ruby Keeler (then Mrs. Al Jolson and making her film debut) plays Peggy, the starry-eyed chorus girl who replaces leading lady Bebe Daniels in the Broadway musical Pretty Lady. The show's director, Warner Baxter, famously tells her that ""You're going out there a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!"" In another star-making turn, Dick Powell is Peggy's leading man - a role he would fill for Keeler in several other musicals. 42nd Street was also an important film in the career of the young Ginger Rogers, who plays a chorus girl named ""Anytime Annie,"" of whom it was said, ""She only said 'No' once, and that was when she didn't hear the question.""

Overall, this film 42nd Street is a very engrossing and enjoyable fascinating film with wonderful music and above average performances from its many talented players and seems rather ahead of its time in 1933 and especially showing its very risqu&eacute; side of Hollywood rarely seen in at the time. Its worth a watch not only because its a great film, but also because of its historical significance. So that is why I give it a 5 Star rating and now brought to life even more with this stunning Blu-ray presentation.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The aspect ratio 1.37:1 is shown in a stunning faultless 1080p encoded image. The picture is a lustrous stable, gorgeous black and white images, with virtually zero defects holds up beautifully in projection. Shadow detail, grey scale and overall resolution are superb, and it has been given such a wonderful restoration that it is almost unbelievable that this film dates back to near the dawn of sound motion pictures. Thanks to a new restoration by Warner Bros. Archive Release is one of those special Blu-ray release and is a must have for true Hollywood Musical aficionados fans.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The English 2.0 DTS HD Master Audio Mono soundtrack is as good as it could possibly be, held back only by the inherent limitations of the source material. Every word of dialogue is clear, noise and excessive hiss are nowhere to be found, and the brilliant musical numbers sound terrific. Hiss has been cleaned up as well as possible, and the brassy showstoppers ring with clarity. English subtitles are available.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Retrospective Feature: 42nd Street  From Book to Screen to Stage [2006] [1080i] [1.33:1] [18:00] We get hear some fascinating historic information on how the film 42nd Street became the legend it is today and how eventually became a massive Broadway stage hit sensation. On this journey, we get contributions from the likes of Richard Barrios [Author/Film Historian]; Martin Ruben [Author]; John Kendrick [Musical Theatre & Film Historian]; Rick Jowell [Professor of Film/Author]; John Landis [Writer/Director]; Larry Billman [Author/Archivist]; Mary Ann Kellogg [Choreographer]; John Waters [Director]; Randy Skinner [Director/Choreographer] and Melisa Rae Mahon [Broadway Performer/Choreographer]. It is a really fascinating how all these contributors love 42nd Street and give their stance on why it was the massive hit it was. And it all started in a Broadway Theatre, but not the way you think, because there was a young chorus boy in the 1920s named Bradford Ropes and instead of just being a chorus boy, he wanted to become a writer, and eventually produced a novel entitled 42nd Street in 1932, which has all the usual slant on the behind-the-scenes seedy side of the Broadway theatre life, and Warner Bros. script readers were always on the lookout for said properties and felt the 42nd Street novel would make an ideal narrative and did not have to rethink the story from the stage terms to cinematic terms and the easiest transition from book to screen. We are told that a novel can think the same way that the cinema does in dream like tones, blending from place to place, without worrying about stage sets, and costumes being adjusted. But when Warner Bros. got the property, they were not sure if they could turn it into a musical and the first choice for the casting for the role of Peggy was going to be Ms. Loretta Young, who was neither a dancer nor a singer. Warner Bros. executives felt it was time to bring back the musical and that it should be grounded in realities of the time, especially the depression, with a gritty look at Broadway itself. It is also pointed out that each film studio had its own House Style in the 1930s and 1940s, and it is also pointed out that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios house style was based around the marvellous glamorous stars and they also aimed their movies at the widest popular audiences and especially the middle class. With Paramount Studios, they did more sophisticated type of film that was aimed more towards the upper class audience. But when it comes to Warner Bros. Studio, they were always trying to cut cost, also with their tight budget system they were always looking for the cheapest and most economical efficient way of telling a story, and when they got into musicals, they set out the same agenda. Then we get into the contributors telling us their favourite actors in 42nd Street, first up is Mary Ann Kellogg who nominates Dick Powell and Ruby Keller, next up is Rick Jewell and his favourite actor in the film is Warren Baxter and lastly is John Landis says his favourite actor in the film is Guy Kibbee. But of course all the contributors rave over Busby Berkeley and his total imagination in bringing something totally magical to the film and how he expands the images which could not be produced exactly on the theatre stage. But the only negative aspect with Busby Berkeley I find personally a bit annoying, is when in the main 42nd Street number where the camera pans up to Dick Powell in the window looking down or where he zooms towards Dick Powell and Ruby Keller at the end of the number, I cannot stand the camera shaking incidents and is so unprofessional and should have been filmed again, as they must of seen it with the rushes, as if it had been a much smoother camera action, it would of looked so much more professional. But despite this small negative comment, the whole sequence of the main 42nd Street musical number was a stunning presentation. Anyway we also find out that when the film had been finalised and in the can, Warner Bros. realised they had a big hit on their hands, so to do a massive promotion, Warner Bros. charted a special silver train that was tied up with General Electric, that was called the 42nd Street Special and started out in Denver and eventually ended its journey in Washington DC, just in time for the Inaugural of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Then we move onto more modern times, when Randy Skinner informs us that in 1980 it was decided to put 42nd Street on Broadway and normally musical films that are transferred to the stage does not work, but with the stage version of 42nd Street was a massive success, because they adapted it for a stage presentation.

Hollywood Newsreel No. 6170 [1933] [480i] [1.33:1] [8:54] This short is brought to you via The Vitaphone Corporation. Here we get a variety of stories from ""behind the scenes"" in Hollywood. There's a report on a second gold rush in California. The 1934 Rose Bowl winners, from Columbia University, visit Warner Bros. studios and seem to have a particularly good time with the dancers from an upcoming musical. Joan Blondell makes an appearance after a recent illness and thanks her fans. There's a shot of Elmer the trained lamb and Sammy Fain sings a couple of his compositions from an upcoming film. We also get a potpourri of features involving Hollywood celebrities. The Columbia University football team, winner of the 1934 Rose Bowl game, visits the Warner Bros. Studios and is greeted by several stars; Margaret Lindsay, Guy Kibbee, and Dick Powell work at a gold mine; Joan Blondell, recovered from a recent illness, thanks her fans; songs from the movie Dancing Fool [1934] are performed by the songwriters and the film's stars. Finally, we get a trip to the Song Factory where find two song composers at the piano composing a new song and two artists join them in singing and dancing to the melody rhythm.

Special Feature: A Trip Thru A Hollywood Studio No. 6616 [1935] [480i] [1.33:1] [10:04] This short is brought to you via The Vitaphone Corporation. The first part shows the audience the entrances to some of the major Hollywood studios; this special presentation gives you a personal guided tour. We get to visit several Hollywood Studios that includes Fox Film Studios that has its own Police and Fire Department. Next up is the RKO Studios that is located in the heart of Hollywood. Next up we visit the Warner Brothers/First National Studio, which covers massive of acres of land. Next up is a quick tour of the Paramount Studios. Next up is an ariel view of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios. Then finally we get to see Universal Studios which was built in 1914 and is the oldest studio in California and boasts of a ground space of 260 acres. We look in at the Casting Office, where get to see lots of eccentric characters hoping to get a part in a film. Then we get to see Busby Berkeley and choreographer Bobby Connolly working with chorus girls on production numbers. Then come some candid shots of several contract stars, such as Warren William, Ann Dvorak, and Pat O'Brien. Finally, we see comedian Hugh Herbert filming a scene for an upcoming release. Narrated by William Ray.

Special Feature: Harry Warren: Americas Foremost Composer No. 1544 [1933] [480i] [1.33:1] [9:08] Once again we have another special presentation via The Vitaphone Corporation. Here we get to see Harry Warren at the grand piano playing some of his most popular numbers on a piano in a tux in a drawing room with a few couples listening and a full bar in the foreground. There's some kidding and a few comic lyrics set to Warren tunes, then Margie Hines and Gladys Brittain alternate singing some of Warren's best-known songs, joined from time to time by The Legends. Couples dance, featuring Marguerite and Le Roy and several couples kiss, others throwback martinis. For the final number, ""Forty-Second Street,"" Harry Warren begins with some solo piano and then the scene dissolves as we go to a sound stage with a cast of hundreds singing and dancing to an orchestra's playing the 42nd Street musical number, but the massive bonus is that you get lots of extra scenes not in the original 42nd Street musical number. All in all this is a really nice little extra presentation.

Special Feature: The 42nd Street Special [1934] [480i] [1.33:1] [5:44] Here we have a Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. bringing their own publicity presentation on the 42nd Street phenomenon. As part of a publicity campaign for the film 42nd Street [1933], Warner Bros. Studios, with the assistance of the General Electric Company, assembled a 7-car special silver train called ""The 42nd Street Special"" and where thousands of fans thronged at the Santa Fe Station to celebrate this special occasion. With numerous Warner Bros. contract stars as passengers, the train made a tour across the USA. It was scheduled to make stops in more than 100 cities, ending in Washington, DC for the March 1933 inauguration of 'Franklin Delano Roosevelt'. This short film records the send-off for this trip in Los Angeles. Using a microphone set up on the rear platform of the last car, several people addressed the crowd attending the event. Those making remarks include performers, studio executives, and the mayor of Los Angeles. A nice little bonus is we get to see Bette Davis sending her good wishes to the public and camera. All in all this is a nice little extra bonus.

Special Feature: Vintage Warner Bros. Cartoon No. 5661: Young and Healthy [1933] [480i] [1.33:1] [7:26] A Hugh Harman-Rudolf Ising Production, and The Vitaphone Pictures presentation. A jolly old king, bored with all the foolish people in his court, goes off to find a group of children playing who are really young and healthy.

Special Feature: Vintage Warner Bros. Cartoon No. 5874: Shuffle Off to Buffalo [1933] [480i] [1.33:1] [6:50] A Hugh Harman-Rudolf Ising Production, and The Vitaphone Pictures presentation. We at Baby Central and a flock of storks is leaving with babies. An old man at a ledger book is dealing with phone calls and letters; a request for twins from Nanook of the North sends him to the refrigerator; the stork carries them in slings marked ""upper birth"" and ""lower birth."" Another request, written in Hebrew; this baby comes back as a rough Jewish stereotype, and gets stamped kosher. He then joins the head man singing the title song, and shuffling us off to see the baby assembly line, manned by dwarves. The babies are washed in a washing machine, dried, powdered, diapered in paper towels, loaded up with milk, and sent off in a crib. They clamour for ""Cantor"" and one of the dwarves reveals that he was Eddie Cantor in disguise, followed by another round of the title song. Viewers should be warned that it contains racial stereotypes which may offend Eskimos, Blacks, Jews, Asians, etc., and Warner Bros. is to be commended for making it available. As the disclaimer before the cartoon states, ""some of these cartoons are being presented as they were originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed.""

Theatrical Trailer [1933] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:18] This is more than a Theatrical Trailer and more like a Special Promotional Film, as we are informed that this is a glimpse into the production of 42nd Street. We also informed that this will be an unforgettable experience and proclaims in bold headlines saying, What A Show What Stars! What Beautiful Girls! The Greatest Aggregation Of Dancing Beauties Ever Seen Together On Stage And Screen Warner Bros. Creators of Talking Pictures Who Gave You Golddiggers Of Broadway, The Jazz Singer and The Singing Fool Surpass These great Hits With 42nd Street Another Milestone In The Art Of Talking Pictures. All in all, this is a totally brilliant promotional film for 42nd Street. A must view.

SONG SELECTION: This is just a list of all the different sections of the film, which is divided into 10 separate titles. You can either pick individual parts of the film to watch the actual musical numbers in the film. But when you click on Main Title at the top of the list, what happens is that the film just carries onto the end credits. Anyway the different sections are listed as follows: Main Title; It Must Be June (choral rehearsals); It Must Be June (stage rehearsals); Youre Getting Be a Habit with Me (piano rehearsal); Youre Getting Be a Habit with Me (full rehearsals); Forty-Second Street (rehearsals); Pretty Lady (overture); Shuffle Off to Buffalo; Young and Healthy; Forty-Second Street.

Finally, 42nd Street is a delightful and important Hollywood musical, and the Warner Bros. Archive Collection Blu-ray is positively stunning. It will be remembered as one of the best Blu-ray releases of the year. Busby Berkeley sequences turn the play into a work of the avant-garde, placing the action on a darkened stage with only a spotlight facing straight down to illuminate the dancers. 42nd Street is one of the first demonstrations that cinema could enhance performing arts, to take those forms into places they could not go on their own. Highly Recommended!
