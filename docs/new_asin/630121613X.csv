It is at once a coming of age movie and a social conscience movie, succeeding on both levels.  There is a gentle humor in scenes.  The drama is underplayed.  The story speaks for itself and has a flow throughout.  There are no great surprises, no great dramatic heights here.  But there is a real story here of childhood bonding.
This is a French film with subtitles, but don't let the subtitles keep you from enjoying this film.",1024617600,9,633,4.657657657657658
321787,5,630121613X,"The overall atmosphere of the movie is a threatening one. The historical circumstance threatens all but in particularly Jean whom the main character Julian befriends. Jean is not Catholic, he has been placed in the boarding school with the school fathers approval to hide him as well as a couple other boys. The viewer knows Jeans ""secret"" all along but it takes Julian a lttle time to figure it out so I'm not giving anything away. Jean lives in fear of being found out, so while the other boys lose themselves in games of play he is always on the look out & as Julian and he become friends so too is Julian on the look out. The two boys are equally gifted, both a bit precocious,  and they share their enthusiasms with each other for books, for music, and for girls.
The movies most powerful scenes are the ones where that bond is consolidated as in the scenes where the two boys are separated from the rest in a treasure hunt game. The two run for their lives from the other boys in a game of play but real life  resonates within the game. The two are lost together but are found by a German patrol and returned to their school. Jean is relieved not to have been found out even though he ran when the Germans found the boys. Julian breaks down crying though, it is as if he knows instinctively just how real the game really is. Julian invites Jean to dinner when his mother comes to visit and during dinner at a posh restaurant Julian tests the petty prejudices that even someone so dear to him as his own mother holds. ""Aren't we Jewish too?""
Many of the best moments are when the war has been pushed into the background as when the whole school watches a Chaplin film. Malle pans the audience laughing while Chaplin negotiates a ships to and fro movements and then he pans the boys faces again when Chaplin courts a beautiful girl and all the boys faces are still before the mystery of it.  And the scene when Julian and Jean ignore an air raid siren and remain above ground alone playing a lively jazzy piano duo together which makes them both spill over with the delight it gives them. When together they are a world of two, they read taboo passages from 1001 Arabian nights by candlelight while the other boys sleep. The joy of the movie is that their bond seems so real, their moments together seem absolutely natural.
This film has the quiet nuances you expect from Malle but all is perhaps even more heigtened by that pervading atmosphere which  threatens always to put an end to it all.",1018137600,2,2498,4.412147505422993
321788,5,630121613X,"This is a masterpiece of cinema, a work of genius by the late great Louis Malle.  Would that we had another like him!  As in Le souffle au coeur (1971) Malle (apparently) reprises part of his childhood for us, recalling everything with the barest touch, just the slightest emphasis, without rancor or any loading of the deck.  He understates and plays fair always.  He has complete control of his story as he gently guides the audience.  He knows what they believe and what they expect.  He respects that, but he doesn't cater, and he is very gentle about leading us to the conclusion.  He makes it beautiful although it is horrible.

Gaspard Manesse as Julien and Raphael Fejto as Jean are unforgettable and a reminder that in film it's important to have a good cast.  Yet, I suspect Malle could have made geniuses of any number of talented boys in their roles.  This is your Catholic boys school coming of age film without lecherous priests or the brutality of children; that is, no more than is necessary, just what is real and seen in perspective, the context being the Nazi occupation of France in 1944.  It is amazing how Malle manages to show the bestiality and brain dead stupidity of the Nazis by presenting them at their most gentle.  If one can damn by faint praise, one can destroy by contrast.  Compared to what is human and natural we see the Nazis, as their pretentious Reich is falling apart, chasing after children, obsessed with psychotic racist delusions.  Through the objective eyes of the children we see the evil.  Malle need only let the events speak for themselves.

I think artists working in any medium would benefit from a study of this film.  (An excellent American film by Malle also worth study is the fascinating Atlantic City (1980) starring Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon.)  What Malle's technique teaches us is to be honest, to be fair, and to keep it simple, but not too simple.  Use not a brush stroke more than necessary, and pay attention to every detail, especially the small ones.  But while we can learn from and appreciate, it takes genius to pull it off.  It can't be done by connecting the dots.

I am struck by a little irony on the jacket of the video.  It has an early Siskel and Ebert quote: ""One of the year's best films.""  That's a little embarrassing unless the year is a hundred years long.

Incidentally, the sublime and beautiful Irne Jacob, who later became a protege of Krzysztof Kieslowski in La Double vie de Vronique (1991) and Trois Couleurs: Rouge (1994), made her debut here in a small part as a piano teacher.

321789,5,630121613X,"Despite the two lead actors being in their teens at most, this film managed to capture so much emotion and beauty while telling a typically melancholy french tale.  The story line has been summarised above so I won't repeat it, but I can tell you that it neither drags on nor moves too quickly.  Because of the dramatic nature of the film the subtitles don't move too quickly and are actually quite easy to follow; even so, a base knowledge of French would supplement your enjoyment of the film.

Plus you don't get the same feel you would get if it were in your native language.  Even with that in mind, I rather liked the story because it was true.  It wasn't someones perversion of what happened. It was the true story of what happened to an 11 year old boy.  You can't even imagine how that would have felt.  I think the movie makes you feel an insider perspective of what really happened to French Jews in 1944.  Also the title of the movie was a good choice and I like how it was incorperated at the end.

321863,2,630121613X,"Not sure what to make of this movie. I am no model Catholic, but in my 25 years of being familiar with the Catholic church in various countries, visiting monasteries, etc.. hardly anything in that respect comes across as remotely authentic in this film. A Carmelite monastery where kids basically have free reign to raise all sorts of hell? Monks and priests totally aloof, (at least to anything that matters) going on around them? I went to Catholic school for 10 years, and it was not really that easy to dell the difference between that and a public school goes as far as what us kids go back and forth gossiping about and the various mischief we got into, but the nuns and priests were nothing like what is portrayed in this 'masterpiece'. The clergy here seem completely out of touch with everything around them, and absolutely useless or even worse than useless to the children they are watching over.

As for other aspects of the film, I just had a feel of general inauthenticity. The acting throughout seemed forced.

My idea of a good film related to the Catholic church is A Man for All Seasons. So at least some of you that may have seen and liked that movie, might understand what I am getting at here with my review.

321871,5,630121613X,"This French WWII film confines Nazis and freedom fighters to the background in deference to a segment of the population that is typically relegated to one-dimensional supporting roles: children. It is a fresh point of view, and one with many potential pitfalls, but Louis Malle's careful execution and commitment to truth carry it through. Basing the story on his own experiences at a Catholic boarding school in Nazi-occupied France, he draws on detailed memories of the cruelty and naivety of children. The students in ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"" are not precocious, like so many movie youths, but they do have individual talents and interests, and they enjoy pretending to be sophisticates. They try to talk dirty, they exaggerate their experiences, and they pretend not to miss their parents when all they think about privately is how they long to be with them. They all have problems and insecurities, as well, that expose them to the insensitive taunts of their peers. One boy has night terrors, one is anemic and faints during mass, and the protagonist is a bed-wetter.

But these are nothing compared to the dangerous secret that some boys are hiding. The lead boy, Julien, whom a teacher describes as intelligent and a bit pretentious, reluctantly befriends a new student, Jean. They share a love of reading, but Julien resents the fact that Jean is a smarter than he and more of a teacher's favorite. Jean is sensitive, and therefore an easy target, so Julien quickly discovers his weak point. But he withholds the valuable information, recognizing its importance without fully understanding its meaning: Jean is Jewish, taking refuge in the school under a false name.

It is hard to find your way to this movie without knowing that key plot point, so even before it comes to the forefront Malle begins exploring it through artful verbal and visual cues. Early on, two students in the schoolyard pretend to be knights engaged in combat. One of them, secretly Jewish, chooses to play the part of a Saracen knight. The other students call him an infidel, and only Jean cheers for him. But such moments of agency in which Jean can express his identity without outing himself are few. More often, he is at risk of appearing different because of things he cannot do: he cannot recite the Hail Mary and other prayers with the rest of the students, cannot eat pork when it is offered, and cannot receive communion.

The communion scene is particularly interesting because it shows the limitations of the school headmaster's charity. After delivering a ringing sermon to wealthy parents about the need to give generously to those in need, Jean comes to the front to receive communion. The headmaster passes him over since he knows Jean is not a Catholic. The moment might have been too-on-the-nose but for the interesting questions it raises. Does Jean intend only to strengthen his disguise by joining in this ritual? Does he do it to better fit in with his peers, and to get closer to his friend Julien? Or, as I tend to think, does he do it because the headmaster's sermon has deeply moved him? In any case, this is one of several moments that make us wonder whether the headmaster could have done more to keep his Jewish charges safe.

Another is the decision that brings about the end of the ruse. The students and teachers gather to watch Charlie Chaplin's ""The Immigrant"" (a 27 year-old film, but there is a war on and it is a religious school). Images of The Tramp and a woman sliding around a rolling ship give way to Malle's shots of a brawl on icy pavement between the school's cook and crippled kitchen boy. The boy, perhaps 18 years old, has been running a black market in preservatives, so the headmaster fires him. In retaliation, the boy notifies the local Gestapo that the school is harboring Jews. The headmaster is a hero who shelters Jews at the risk of his own safety, yet his incomplete committal to his espoused principles creates an opportunity for his work to be undone. Still, he falls gracefully. He courageously delivers the titular farewell when he is marched off to share the Jewish students' inevitable fatea fate Malle has foreshadowed in a tense but beautiful forest sequence midway through the film.

The movie's Nazis are one-note, but this is not a problem so long as they are kept in the background. When they show up in force at the end, they indulge in a bit too much leering and mustache-twirling for a film that is primarily interested in the hypocrisy and indifference of the French rather than the blatant barbarism of the Germans. But nothing diminishes the impact of the film's final lines, which are delivered almost without emotion in a voice-over by an adult Julien. The window on the atrocities of WWII that he had as a child was a narrow and privileged one, and his understanding of them was imperfect, but the sudden and permanent loss of a friend became a searing and defining memory for him. By looking at the period and place through a child's eyes, Malle demonstrates that no amount of insularity or innocence could keep one blind as to what was happening to Europe's Jewish population.",1423094400,,5139,4.7891770011273955

321940,4,630121613X,"AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS, (1987).  An unusual, but welcome, French classic in full color, this 104 minute film, a biography/drama/World War II/holocaust picture was written and directed by eminent French director Louis Malle, (ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS, ATLANTIC CITY, LACOMBE, LUCIEN, PRETTY BABY, MY DINNER WITH ANDRE), based on his own childhood experience. In 1944, as World War II rages around them, upper crust boy Julien Quentin,( played by Gaspard Manesse; the character can be read as Malles standin), and his brother Francois return to an expensive provincial boarding school run by priests.  Julien is a smart boy, a good student, a reader and a leader, and he is up to most of the usual schoolboy tricks in the school, which seems to be a haven from the war around them. A new student, Jean Bonnet, (Raphael Fejto), obviously also smart, arrives, and for some time they are rivals.  But eventually the roommates realize they have similar interests and talents, form a bond, and share secrets.  Jean learns that Julien is unhappy at school and wets his bed; Julien learns that Jean is Jewish, very frightened, and simply trying to avoid the eyes of the German troops occupying France so as to survive the war.

The acting of the boys, the priests, and everyone around them is seamless, transparent.  Beautifully written and filmed, this is a picture that might be unbearably sad, were it not for the fact that most of it is taken up with what I imagine is typical life at a French boys boarding school at the time, with all its horseplay and high jinks, cold water and scanty food (even at an expensive place). The crocodile, and the outdoor exercise plus wearing of short pants all through winter. The director does a good job of distracting the viewer with all this, until he is ready to tell the tragic story at its heart, which has clearly been on his mind for nearly 50 years.  I would urge you to take a look at it.",1407888000,3,1927,4.683431952662722

321944,4,630121613X,"In the film Au Revoir Les Enfants produced by Louis Malles, the protagonist Julien Quentin is a student at the Petit College dAvon during the era of Nazi occupation over France. School days were toneless however peaceful for Julien until he greets the arrival of the new pupil Jean Bonnet, which is also another protagonist of the story. Bonnet is appointed the bed right next to Juliens in the dorm room. Julien happens to dislike Bonnet at the first place since he considers Bonnet as his competitor in the class. One night as Julien wakes up from his bed he sees Bonnet is dressing abnormally and praying in Hebrew with two white candles. This occasion shocks Julien a little; as a result, he becomes skeptical about Bonnets real status. After digging through this unwelcome persons closet at the time when nobody else is in the dorm room except Julien, he becomes aware about the true identify of Jean Bonnet at the moment when he sees the picture of Bonnets family with his real name on it, or maybe he has start calling Bonnet on his real name Jean Kipplestein. After Julien confirms his suspect with Bonnet, he chooses not to expose the fact that Bonnet is a Jew. After this incident they become close friends to each other. Julien used to be jealous about Bonnets talent on playing piano, however, in one scene, they play piano together joyfully.
  Here comes in one of the key characters Pere Jean, he is the headmaster of the school. There is one scene in the church which Pere Jean is preaching to both parents and their children the students on Parents Day. The ideas he is trying to convey are that treat all the people equally and there is no difference between impoverished people and wealthy people. Another key character must be introduced is Joseph the school cook assistant. He is secretly selling school food supplies to black market. As Pere Jean figures this out and decries him, Joseph suggests several students as his accomplices, including Julien. Dramatically, it turns out that Pere Jean hires Joseph but none of the accomplices since Pere Jean is afraid of the wealthy families of these students. This action angers Joseph, he thinks it is not justice for Pere Jean to penalize him only. On a normal morning, Gestapo officers raid Juliens classroom to hunt down Jewish kids. Julien intends to conceal the fact that Bonnet is the Jew they are searching for. However, things usually do not happen in the ways people anticipate. The Gestapo officer is so affirmative that the Jew he is searching for is sitting right in the classroom. Julien unconsciously gives Bonnet away by peeking into his direction when Julien sees the officers back, unfortunately, this is the trick the officer plays in order to achieve his goal. Bonnet is arrested with other two Jewish kids, same as Pere Jean, in the crime of sheltering Jews and obstructing the officers missions. At this time, Julien sees a person who supposed to be no longer stay in this school with an German officer, it is Joseph the schools cook assistant. Joseph tells the officers that Julien is his friend. Julien finally realizes that Joseph is the one who gives away the hiding place of the Jews to the officer. Julien cannot do anything to alter the situation except looks on helplessly when he sees the Gestapo officers bring his best friend, other two kids, and Pere Jean away. The film ends with a remorseful confession of an older Julien about the endings of these four people which he will never forget during his entire life time.",1393027200,,3517,4.745098039215686
321945,5,630121613X,"The movie ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"" takes place in the years of 1943 - 1944. At this time in history, a cruel event took place, and this event was WW2. WW2 first started in Germany with the scapegoat theory, where people chose to blame the minority for the problems and at this time the minority had included Jews. German soldiers known as Nazis would go into the homes of Jews and take them away to brutal concentration camps. This action spread into different parts of Europe and one of these parts was France , as it is seen in the movie ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"". The Nazi soldiers in France would walk in to homes and take Jewish families away. This movement called for desperation and means to protect themselves for the Jews and for some French people that weren't Jewish, they wanted to help because they knew what was happening was unrighteous. In the movie, ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"", we see this taking place, where Jews are in seek of a hiding place and someone tries to help them . We all see the creation of friendships, betrayals, terror, fear, commitment, and compassion.  ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"" is about  a school in France by the name of Petit Collge d'Avon, where three Jewish kids are kept in hide with new last name as disguises to not show their Jewish background by the principal of the school, Pre Jean. Pre Jean's commitment, compassion, and duty as a priest to help and instill righteousness in people is seen when he takes these three Jewish kids under his hand, when the consequences for such actions could be death. One of the Jewish kids that Pre Jean takes in is a boy by the name of Jean Kipplestein. However, so he won't be recognized as Jewish, he changes his last name to Bonnet. Julien Quentin is another student that also attends this school. At first, he, along with the other kids, are not very nice to Bonnet, but overtime they begun to grow a close friendship to the point where Bonnet let Quentin know that he was Jewish and he was in hiding. The constant terror and fear that Bonnet faces everyday is not something a young boy should have. This type of terror could make a child loose his childhood and mature into an adult much more faster. The fear that one day, any day, he could be taken away and killed is not thoughts that any child should ever have to have , but it is the case for Bonnet. At this school, there is also a kitchen worker by the name of Joseph whom sells the school kitchen supplies to students on the black market. As a kitchen worker at the school, Joseph doesn't go through a lot of pain prejudice because he does not come from a rich background. For example, during one of his trades, the student took the stamps he was trading to him and ran off without giving him anything back. One of the students that he traded with was Quentin. Eventually, he gets caught and is brought to the principal, who has no choice but to fire him, however the principal does not expel the kids/his accomplices who traded with him because their rich parents may have been big donors to the school. This only added to Joseph's pain and prejudice. Due to Joseph's, unfair treatment of being fired with nothing happening to his accomplices and the pain and prejudice he has faced at the school, his betrayal of Bonnet comes.  He notified the French Nazis that Jewish kids were being sheltered in the school, which is the reason for their arrival there one morning. At this time, Bonnet and Quentin are in math class, and the Gestapo demands to know who the Jewish kid in the class is and when he turns around , Quentin takes a sneak glance at Bonnet, that did not go unnoticed by the Gestapo. The Gestapo quickly realized that Bonnet was the Jew and ordered him to get up and go with the French Nazi. The other two Jewish kids are also caught. Bonnet, the other two Jewish kids and the principal, Jean Pre are taken away  and as they leave, the kids yell out to Pre Jean, ""Au revoir, mon pre"" (Goodbye my father), and he replies to them, ""Au revoir, les enfants"" (Goodbye my kids), which is where the title of this movie comes from. The Gestapo, then educates the kids that what Pre Jean did was wrong and tells them that the French people are weak. At the end of the movie, Julien registers his own guilt when he says, """"Bonnet, Negus and Dupre died at Auschwitz; Father Jean at Mauthausen. The school reopened its doors in October.

Julien will never forget the day that one of his closest friends was taken away due to him and he will always carry that guilt even though Bonnet did try to reason to him that it was not his fault and this could have happened any day.  In short, This intriguing and thrilling movie that depicts a cruel time in history has shown the friendship of two little boys,  the betrayal of a worker due to the prejudice he was faced with,  the terror and fear of a young Jewish boy of being caught and taken away any day by a French Nazi, and the commitment and compassion of a priest , who helps to shelter Jews to try and protect their endangered lives. This movie, ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"" tells the story of the guilt of a little boy for getting his friend taken away that will always remain with him forever.",1392940800,,5287,4.4164102564102565

The film does reflect the inbuilt hypocrisy of the boys to their religion, but the dialogue shows very little reference to the war going on and the constant references to sex are there to amuse rather than to portray a picture of the times. Based on the well known French Antisemitism, the friendship between the wealthy French boy and his Jewish class mate had very little reason for it and was hardly credible. The Germans were not portrayed as savages in their dealing with the caught Jewish boys, and would surely have never allowed the boy to pack his suitcase.

After asking ""What are you guys doing for fun nowadays?"", he surprised me by saying that he actually had seen some of my reviews here online. He actually chided me a bit for being too nice to the Catholic Church, as he said ""always bending over backwards"" to emphasize that there are plenty of decent Catholics. Even though the Roman Church is engaged in the most heinous campaign against gay people. He asked why...??  Well, this movie sort of explains why. My dad's own story as a Jewish  child during the Second World War was quite similar to this movie. For that reason I found this movie especially poignant.

Au revoir les Enfants is a semi-autobiographical story from director Louis Malle who was born in 1932 and lived through many of the events depicted on the screen. Because it's based on the truth, it has added meaning for the viewer. It's about school, friendship, racism and regret.

The story begins with a 15-year-old boy, Julien Quentin (Manesse), leaving his mother and taking the train to a Catholic boarding school. The school is run by monks and all of the students are boys. It's set in the 1940s during the German occupation of France. A new boy, Jean Bonnet (Fejt), takes the bed next to Quentin.

Most of the students tease Bonnet and make his life a misery. As you have probably experienced, this is typical treatment for a new student in any school. In addition to the teasing, he finds that the water is cold, baths have to be taken in the local town, and air raids disrupt the lessons. Bonnet's life becomes more tolerable when a monk tells Quentin to befriend him without explaining why. After a while, Bonnet's ability in a wide range of school subjects such as music, math and French, earns Quentin's respect. The two become friends.

The portrayal of school life is realistic and reminds me somewhat of The 400 Blows. It gradually becomes clear that Bonnet has a secret. He claims to be a protestant and mentions that his father is a prisoner. Quentin searches Bonnet's locker and uncovers the secret, but he's not completely aware of its significance at the time.

When his mother visits, Quentin persuades her to include Bonnet on a trip to a local restaurant. She likes him although he doesn't say much. While they are eating, we are shown a group of collaborators harassing a Jewish man who simply wants to have dinner. Jews are not allowed in the restaurant. Quentin is puzzled by this treatment and isn't even sure what a Jew is and why they should be hated.

Quentin matures throughout the film and his awareness of events happening in his life increases. It's a coming-of-age tale of sorts, and the seemingly innocent existence of the students is overshadowed by something more sinister.

This sad tale will emotionally affect viewers who allow themselves to be drawn into the story. I can only imagine what Malle must have gone through in order to make it. Perhaps it was his way of confessing?

I don't want to reveal anything more as it might ruin the experience for anyone yet to see it.

Actress Irne Jacob made her film debut in the role of a piano teacher which ultimately led to her being noticed by director Krzysztof Kieslowski. As a result, he cast her in The Double Life of Veronique and Three Colors Red. Both films are essential viewing for film fans who enjoy stories encouraging thought and speculation.

Video Quality 4/5
Criterion's transfer is strong and has plenty of detail without ruining the intended look of the film. Instances of dirt, debris and scratches are kept to a minimum. The colors are particularly impressive despite the muted setting.

322045,5,630121613X,"Louis Malle (1932 - 1995) was one of the pioneering greats of the French New Wave.  His Au Revoir, Les Enfants, based on his own wartime memories is about the guarded friendship of two 12 year-old boys of 12, Julien Quentin and Jean Bonnet (played by amateur actors Gaspard Manesse and Raphael Fejto. Julien has been sent by train from Paris to the distant safety of a Catholic boarding school for rich kids.  At the school, Julien finds happiness and security from the war.  Not long after Christmas, a new student arrives: Jean.  A Jew.

Director Malle said he never forgot the day when Nazis raided his own school and took away three Jewish students and the headmaster.  As they were marched off, the priest turned back, ""Au revoir, les enfants."" Goodbye, children.

Malle later discovered that the three boys died at Auschwitz and the priest died at Mauthausen camp a few weeks after the war ended.  Criterion's pristine restored BD version of this classic film includes a video interview with Malle biographer Pierre Billard and actress Candice Bergen, Malle's widow as well as an audio interview with Malle himself.

The beautiful Blu-ray edition makes this compelling film all the more heartfelt and poignant and true.

Will we -- or do we -- ever learn?

This meditation on our common humanity -- and cruelty -- is from one of cinema's rare authentic artists.",1299715200,3,1367,4.824034334763948
322046,3,630121613X,"Au Revior les Enfants is a 1987 film written and directed by Louie Malle that recalls his fall and winter semesters in Catholic school in France in 1944. During this time, the Germans are stepping up their program against the Jews, and eventually the issue comes to Malle's school where a number of Jewish boys have been posing as Catholics.

Malle was nominated 3 times for an Oscar (""Murmur of the Heart"", ""Atlantic City"", ""Au Revoir les Enfants"") . He won 2 awards at Cannes (""Pretty Baby"" and ""Le Monde du Silence"") and over his career of 33 films he won a total of 37 awards. Malle is famous for ""The Lovers"" (1958) which resulted in a Supreme Court ruling about pornography, and equally famous for being the husband of Candice Bergen. I think his best work was ""My Dinner with Andre"" (1981) although his most reknowned film is ""Au Revoir Les Enfants."" The film won 7 French Oscars and several European awards. It was nominated for a Golden Globe, 2 Oscars and 4 BAFTAs, but won only 1 BAFTA (best direction).

As with almost any French film it is slow to develop and tends to linger on individual scenes in an attempt to bring some lyrical quality to the shot. Malle's tender reflections go on and on for more than an hour before we can get any sense of the underlying theme of the film. Though it's all very nice and child-like, it seems an excessive amount of time to devote to the goings on. For example, at one point, we watch the children watch a Charlie Chaplin silent film. It's a marvelous bit of direction and works, for about 30 seconds. But as the scene lingers on, switching between the children and Chaplin, I found myself getting more interested in the Chaplin film than the French film. Mercifully, after about 3 minutes, the scene ends. What could have been a touch of brilliance got milked to the point of becoming an annoyance.

I understand that many viewers will find the slow pace enjoyable, and some will find it enthralling. Roger Ebert praises how Malle ""naturally evokes the daily life of a French boarding school"". I'm just saying that I don't. Moreover, it's hard to imagine that this is really World War 2 and there are people being slaughtered everywhere. The Nazis behave like stern school monitors, and even the Gestapo are polite, sincere, and gentlemanly. In addition, everyone complains about the cold, but there is no snow, no ice, not even a chill wind blowing. People complain about the lack of food, but everywhere people seem to be well fed and there are a couple of really fat kids.

""Au Revoir"" can be compared with other World War 2 films that show what goes on in a conquered country. ""The Last Metro"" is a film about the German occupation of France, while ""North Star"" (1943) shows us the German occupation of a small Russian town and ""Hangmen Also Die"" (1943) focuses on Prague. Among these, ""Au Revoir"" seems to be the least concerned with the war.

If you're looking for a tender film about growing up in a Catholic school in Europe in the 40s, this is a really sweet and tender  look and you will enjoy it. If you're looking for some commentary about World War 2, or about the French resistance, or the treatment of the Jews, or anything political or societal, you will be disappointed.",1277942400,6,3240,4.577586206896552

Julien doesn't like the new boy at first, but gradually their mutual love of books and an exciting game of capture the flag cement their friendship.  Life is good at the school and, except for having no heat and meager meals, the war has little effect on the students until the day the Gestapo comes to class.

This film is based on an event in director/writer Louis Malle's childhood, one that obviously haunted him decades later.  It is a war movie for people who hate war movies, focusing on the ups and downs and youthful hijinks of boys at school until the sudden and shocking conclusion.  The boys who play Julien and Bonnet are both naturals and give sincere, touching performances.  The war era is faithfully reproduced and it feels like a movie made in the forties instead of 1987.

322051,5,630121613X,"Au Revoir les Enfants (Goodbye, Children) is a French film of profound sadness. The story is about Julien Quentin, a young French boy who must attend school in the countryside because Paris is not safe due to WWII. The opening scene with Julien saying goodbye to his mother says a lot about Julien's character. He can be mean yet at the same time, he shows incredible love and friendship to those dearest to him. While at the school, he meets Jean Bonnet, a mysterious boy who Julien cannot help but be curious about.

The title of the film says much about the themes present. As the film progresses, 12-year-old Julien learns about the tragic things in life. Unlike most other boys his age, the events surrounding the film cause him to grow up earlier than he is comfortable with. Childhood is an incredibly fleeting thing and to many of the characters in the film, it is even more so.

The strongest part of the film was the acting by Gaspard Manesse (Julien) and Raphael Fejt (Bonnet). Julien initially takes a dislike to Bonnet, but they begin spending more time with one another, learning that despite differences in each other, they are able to get along and form a friendship that touches both of their hearts. A tragic yet innocent mistake late in the film leads to a heart wrenching and unforgettable ending.

Au Revoir les Enfants is one of the best films I've seen. It is intelligent and deep in its message. For me, the message is that war affects children unnecessarily and cruelly. Like the title implies, children are forced to grow up too quickly because of war. I do not know about other viewers but for me, childhood was a happy yet brief time. For children affected by war and violence, it is even shorter, and this film perfectly embodies the tragic consequences that follow. I cannot recommend a film more intensely than this.

I watched it the other night and must admit that it IS an exceptional movie.  At first I figured that it might be just another over-rated French movie as I watched a well-done production of the standard boy's school hyjinks.  However, the characters were more substanitive that usual (even for a group of pre-teens nearing puberty) and the setting of France during WWII added a lot to the dramatic effect.

You could guess what was coming but I kept getting more and more impressed by the depth of the story, supporting cast, and the way Malle let us see Occupied France.  We see the collaborators, the anti-semites (somewhat redundant), the ones who buried their heads in the sand, and those brave enough to risk their lives for others.  The ending is not action-filled nor overly dramatic.  The ending evolves from a series of events that seem to happen too fast and then it is over.  A narrator from the future puts it all into perspective as we realize we have glimpsed a scene of horror that happened too easily.

It is a semi-autobiographical account of a young boy living a sheltered life in a Catholic school and the chance encounter he has with his classmate, who is first a rival and then becomes a beloved friend.  This friend is concealing a secret during a time when the Nazis were cracking down on and removing Jews from schools, among other places.

At school, he encounters a new boy, Jean Bonnet, who doesn't seem to fit in with the other boys. At first the two boys view themselves as rivals in grades, but later, they form a close friendship, made all the more precious due to the secret that Jean harbors. It is a dangerous secret, one which Julien finds out through some sleuthing around, but never detracts from their friendship. This is a story about childhood innocence, and coming of age in a time when the Nazis were in power. A time when one was persecuted simply for being of an undesirable race, even children. A time when even good people who acted based on their conscience were packed off to camps. It is a beautiful movie...there is no graphic violence, but you can sense the evil that permeates the atmosphere throughout the movie...children having to hide during air raids in dark shelters, a man forced to leave a restaurant for being a Jew, and children sent off to their deaths for their racial identity.

322112,5,630121613X,"This film is a masterpiece: poignant and evocative.  Long after finishing Au Revoir Les Enfants, the story will disturb you...it is a part of history that we rarely think about anymore, the German occupation of France and the genocide of the Jews and their sympathizers.

Louis Malle, the famous French director (1932-1995) and the late husband of actress Candace Bergen not only directed this film, but it is his story.  Malle was able to find closure for an experience that had preoccupied him since the German occupation of France in World War II. When he was 12, he was sent to a Catholic boarding school near Paris where the priests and teachers kept several Jewish students hidden.  They were given French names and the other boys were not told.  Julien Quentin (as Malle) begs his mother not to send him; he is a thoughtful, bright, sensitive boy who has a secret; he is a bed-wetter.  What a horrible place for a child who wets the bed............having to sleep with scores of other boys in a huge dormitory.  In addition, it is freezing cold and there is never enough food. But there is fun and games and the teachers really care for their pupils.

Through a series of events our young hero becomes good friends with a new student, Jean Bonnet.  When Julien finds out that Jean's last name is really Kippelstein, he realizes what he has suspected for a while, that Jean is a Jew.  The boys forge a friendship based on their love of books, music and their innate intelligence.  Jean even eats lunch with Julien's mother and brother during parent's day.  Then one day the Nazis come to class and arrest the three hidden Jews and the Priest (also the principal of the school) who protected them and send them to concentration camps.  The informant was the fired kitchen worker.  They also close down the school.  Julien and the other children, whose lives were once so carefree, are affected by this event for the rest of their lives.  In fact, their childhood is lost.

This haunting film is very well acted, the children portray such an innocence, even during their rough housing.  They are extremely believable.  And, I agree with the other reviewers, the cinematography is absolutely amazing.",1151452800,5,2203,4.75
322113,4,630121613X,"Au Revoir les Enfants is a movie made in memory of one of the most inhumane periods this world has ever seen, the Holocaust.  A group of French boys attend pre Jean's school in Vichy France.  Called the Petit College d' Avon, this school keeps the boys safe from the harsh environment of persecution that the Nazi occupied territories are experiencing.  One of the students, Julien Quentin, realizes that there won't be another January 17, 1944, and he feels like no one else thinks about death.  The irony of this statement lies in that he is saying this to a Jewish boy, whose mother is in a concentration camp somewhere, and his father was missing a long time ago.  He, Jean Kippelstein, a.k.a. Jean Bonnet, lives in the perpetual fear of being discovered by the German supporting Vichy government or the German soldiers who are frequently patrolling areas in the region.  Everyday, there is a possibility that the German soldiers will come into the school and take away suspected boys.  Jean has to hide his name, his religion, his beliefs, and his identity constantly, just to survive.

 This movie is not a dry, impersonal documentary mourning the tragedy of the numerous people persecuted during the holocaust, but a riveting account of the raw emotions felt by the people of this period.  ""Cruelty is pushed to its extreme horror,"" and people are being treated in an inhuman way, being publicly insulted, emotionally humiliated and every human right is violated.  One instance of this is when the soldier asks Julien to pull his pants down to check whether he has been circumcised, and particularly to a young boy, this is extremely humiliating.  However, even in these dark periods, the light of ""benevolence [is] carried to its highest degree of nobility and beauty.""  Pre Jean is exemplary in this respect.  He protects Jewish people in his church, even though he knows that this is treason, and that he could be persecuted for this noble crime.  He fires Joseph, the aid, for his exchanges with the students, but his accomplices were not expelled.  I believe that this is wise of Pre Jean, because if the rich and influential students leave the school, there will be absolutely nothing to prevent the government from sifting through the school for potential ""enemies to the state.""  In his sermons, he almost openly sympathizes with the Jewish people, and takes a great risk.  He preaches about the Christian need for charity, and generosity, especially in such dire circumstances.  Pre Jean's commitment to the Jewish students is so concrete he protects them until he is persecuted himself for protecting them.  This displays a great strength of moral fiber, and an unbreakable sense of compassion, irrelevant of religion or gender, or any other segregation.

 Guilt is another emotion that is brought out in its many dull hues during the course of the movie.  Joseph's guilt in letting the boys and Pre Jean be persecuted is explored.  Julien's guilt in the same case is also shown when Joseph says if he had not been fired for trading with him, he would not have had to sell the boys' lives to the Germans.  This guilt hurts the young Julien, who shares a ""wary and prickly'"" relationship with Jean.  They are friends, in a sensitive and curios manner peculiar to boys their age.  Julien is drawn to the strange new boy, is jealous of his abilities, and mystified by his foreign religious beliefs.  Jean gladly accepts any escape from the frequent taunting of his malicious classmates.  They grow closer over youthful male sessions of forbidden and shadowy tales from distant Arabia, and energetic pieces on the piano, and stealing treats from the kitchen.  In the end, Julien fells responsible for sending his friend away to an unknown but certain death.

 Au Revoir les Enfants manages to capture the real emotions experienced by people of Vichy France during the Holocaust on a level that has never been achieved before.  The movie leaves the viewer with a strange sense of emotion at the characters and their individual lives.",1148947200,9,4045,4.8841642228739
322163,5,630121613X,"French director Louis Malle made in this one, in my opinion, his greatest work.

Briefly -and mainly- this is the story of two kids in a catholic school during the German occupation of France.

As always, different critics will pick up those themes that most interest him. To me this was a film about

a) Childhood cruelty,

b) Coming of age

c) Social classes (as noted from the environment of a school)

d) and religion

Not in any particular order but all very interrelated. Also, I'd like to point out some interesting notes that caught my eye: the education environment. The relation between kids themselves, and the kids and their teachers. I was specially interested (because of the contrast with today's US) in the quality of education that was taught in France, in the spirit of discipline, respect, hard word... the underlining importance -as usual in French films- of books. Sure the French kids could be as ""naughty"" as US kids, but at least they would read Jules Verne or Arabian Nights. What do US kids read? That's right, nothing. They don't know Melville, Steinbeck, Jack London, Robert L. Stevenson. In US public schools kids don't read anything. They have the maid-teachers read for them. They still write on lined paper in college because they wouldn't be able to write straight (!!).

A work of art, even more because it is not an easy-to-tell story, this one. And time practically flies while watching it. I suggest showing it to your nearest specimen of teenager. If he stands the whole movie, he is probably a happy private school kid or a miserable public shool underachiever. If he stands ten minutes only, he can still live to be a senator or even President. If he runs away at the beginning he is probably a ""normal"" kid. (And, unfortunately, the same applies to their parents).

A wonderful film.",1147564800,3,1824,4.765079365079365
322164,5,630121613X,"AU REVOIRE LES INFANTS is a moving coming  of age film by famed French director Louis Malle. Julien Quentin, the film's protagonist, is a member of a well to do French family. He attends a Catholic boarding school during World War II which is the setting of most of the film. Julien is a sensitive, intelligent twelve year old and is considered by his teachers to be a young man with great promise. He is asked to befriend a new student Jean Bonnet, but this the young Julien finds difficult. Jean is the first student to rival the young Julien academically, and when Jean is taunted by his classmates, Julien fears risking his popularity. Eventually Julien finds in Jean the only student who shares his interests and both understands and shares his precociousness.

There are not many surprises in this film. Germany is losing the war and the French know it, which causes the Germans to resort to bullying tactics. Jean is attending the school as a means of escaping the death camps. Eventually the school's harboring of Jews is discovered and the school is closed. Director Louis Malle accepts that viewers will know the story and this allows us to be drawn into the characters. We see good and we see evil, but we also see that blurred line between good and evil that can make any of us ask ourselves what we would do in the same situation. For this reason the film stays with the viewer and can be seen multiple times and each time a new insight can be gained.

The critical praise of this film when it was first released is well deserved. Malle captures the atmosphere of France in 1944 perfectly. We see a defeated nation but we see glimpses of its pride returning. The boarding school is accurate and the Catholic back-story is authentic. Yet what makes this film so compelling is the superb acting of the two young actors Gaspard Manesse and  Rafael Fejto as Julien and Jean respectively. Throughout the film Manesse plays Julien with an innocence that is endearing but hidden under the innocence is a sophistication that far exceeds his age. Fejto's  Jean is both frightened and brave and he's able to capture a young man who would be lively and engaging if the circumstances were different.

Perhaps the fact that the film is based on Malle's own experiences during the war is the reason for its quality, but it is a moving film that will not soon be forgotten and reminds us that good films, like good novels, have a way of staying with us.",1146873600,6,2451,4.5972540045766594
322165,5,630121613X,"Louis Malle, one of the best directors to ever create film, gained his reputation through a series of semi-autobiographical films, films so heart-felt, so deeply emotional, so full of detail, they can't be anything but outstanding. ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"", recently released on DVD by the Criterion Collection, is my favorite of these films.

Julien (Gaspard Manesse) has a deep-felt affection for his mother (see Malle's ""Murmur of the Heart"" for more on this) but he understands he will be much safer at the French boarding school in the countryside. The school, run by priests, provides a safe haven for the children of well-off families during World War II. Returning from Christmas break, the new year is uneventful for a while. Julien is a bright student and the ring leader for a bunch of boys. Julien trades items with Joseph, a poor boy who works in the kitchen, more out of amusement than anything else, but also to supplement the meager diet served by the priests. One day, a new student arrives; Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejto), a quiet boy the other kids make fun of: ""Look at Easter Bonnet."" Julien also begins to notice things about the new kid; he doesn't participate in the Catholic prayers the father's lead, he doesn't eat certain things, and one night, Julien wakes up to find Jean praying over some candles. Then, Julien's attitude changes and he forms an uneasy friendship with Jean.

Made in 1987, more than forty years after the events depicted, Julien is a thinly disguised autobiographical version of the director, as he lives a real life event from Malle's childhood. You might expect such a film to be filled with saccharin and sugar, full of fond reminiscences from his childhood. But the film is very astute at depicting the childhood as an observer might see it. We watch Julien observe things, react to things, but he is very adult for his age, giving us an adult view of the events. Because we are watching his reactions, we see his feelings, which are emotional but reserved. It is similar to a television show with a laugh track, the fake laughter cueing us to laugh. When the television show doesn't have a laugh track, they have to work harder to make us laugh. When we are watching the events unfold through Julien's eyes, Malle has to work harder to make adults feel for the characters. Because this works, every emotion is more resonant and the film is much more powerful.

Life in the school is depicted in such a vivid fashion, it instantly becomes clear someone really lived through this period, this tale is autobiographical. The boys live in an old monastery, with very little heat. Yet, they don't seem to notice the problem much. They have endured it for so long and have become used to it, playing outside in the frigid weather, wearing shorts and coats. The classes are also very different from what we are used to today; the teachers are strict and the children tend to learn despite the circumstances of their life. Even though these children are from rich families, living in this boarding school, and they are well-cared for, they still have worries. The war is ever present. Some of the students have lost brothers, father, uncles and more. They are better off than many of their countrymen, but that doesn't mean they are comfortable.

As the relationship between Julien and Jean grows and changes, their friendship becomes deeper. Julien is like most boys his age, anytime someone new enters the picture, they have to prove they can fit in. Jean doesn't really fit in, or for that matter, really try to. Yet, every time Julien is surrounded by a group of friends, Jean seems to long for the same camaraderie. He is better in most subjects than Jean and he seems to get the preferential treatment Julien once received. But as Julien realizes Jean is different, and begins to piece together why, he realizes Jean will never completely fit in and has to help him through this ordeal. They become friends. Thankfully, Malle also shows a lot of restraint in this area. The friendship is a gradual thing. It doesn't happen immediately, or completely, taking time to develop.

Because the film is set in the winter of 1944, the threat of German soldiers is constant. These soldiers have occupied the small town, changing everything about the people's lives. Yet, Malle doesn't paint them as the completely evil men we have come to associate with Hitler's persona. Yes, there is always a threat, but some of their human qualities are displayed. When Julien and Jean get lost in the forest, German soldiers find them and return them to the school. One of the teachers makes a remark about the ""filthy"" German soldiers. The soldier responds he would like the blanket the ""filthy"" Germans used to keep the children warm during the ride back. During a parent visit, Julien's mother visits and takes them to a restaurant. At the restaurant a French Collaborator gives a Jewish customer a hard time. A table of German soldiers notices this and chastises the French Collaborator, humiliating him, leaving the Jewish customer to reflect in silence. The German Soldiers acted out of irritation at having their dinner interrupted, but it is interesting to watch them take the frustration out on the right person. It would have been extremely easy to paint the German soldiers as the villains we know they were. This story is told through Julien's eyes. And at the time, he wouldn't have known the full extent of the atrocities inflicted by the German army. Therefore, Malle makes some of these men seem human, giving the entire film another layer of depth. Also, during the final moments, when the Gestapo arrives at the school to investigate claims of Jewish students, their leader seems to be fairly kind and nurturing, even towards the Jewish students he uncovers. Of course, this makes him all the more monstrous. We don't expect him to take one of the children and start reading him a bedtime story. We know the fate of these children. And it is chilling. We don't really need to know what happened to them, but when Malle provides voice over narrating what happened to Jean and the other Jewish students hiding in the boarding school, we learn their fate and it causes great sadness.

All of these different layers help to make the story seem more realistic. The boarding school is run by Pere Jean (Philippe Morier-Genoud), a strict missionary who puts up with little foolishness. But after Jean's arrival, Julien witnesses a different side of the headmaster. The fact that this Catholic priest would help Jewish children hide in his boarding school, putting him and the school at risk, is a truly courageous thing. This is yet another layer, another detail, giving the film great depth. Because no one is completely innocent, or completely bad, everyone is involved in the tale of wartime survival.

""Au Revoir, Les Enfants"" is a heartfelt, masterful film everyone should witness for themselves. Description doesn't do it justice.

Malle also worked in American film, creating some interesting stories, the best of which is ""Atlantic City"" starring Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon in an early role.

If you haven't experienced the work of Louis Malle, now is the time. ""Elevator to the Gallows"", an early Malle film, was also just released by Criterion. Check it out.",1145577600,41,7311,4.837729816147083
322166,5,630121613X,"I do not see the need to summarize the plot as this has been done by other reviewers. I certainly disagree with the one who basically says this film is not as good as Schindler's List just because it does not embrace the same kind of memorial agenda, while the purpose of this work is to testify to Louis Malle's childhood and coming of age. It so happens that people lived during WWII who did not realize the times they were going through, and this is what this film shows. However, just as it would be simplistic to portray all French as Nazi ""collaborators"" or as Resistance fighters, I think that certain nuances may be lost to those who can only use subtitles to understand this story. Malle is actually suggesting that everyone bears a part of responsibility for what ultimately befalls the young jews, including some people who meant well or thought well of themselves. When the German officer enters the class room at the end of this film and asks who is Jean Bonnet among the children, it is Julien who denounces him because he cannot help looking at him. Of course it's not willful, but he must have felt terrible ever after. And this horrible fate happens because the young (handicapped) cook was fired from the school, the reason being that he stole food that he was selling to some people, including students who would not have enough with the boarding diet. In fact, one of the students who traded with him was Julien's brother, the one who showed sympathies for Resistance and openly despised Vichy! Thus even the self-righteous young man is not clean for having pushed a poor guy to despair - the handicapped cook was lucky to have these monks giving work to him, and he needed to do something for a living, so he sold information to the Germans!  When you look at it from this perspective, the innocent people in this film are just as much responsible for the final disaster as the clear bad guys. Which is much more interesting... and bears more similarity to my judgment of this period, and on life in general.",1140048000,8,2029,4.574175824175824

322168,5,630121613X,"The setting is a private school for the rich run by Catholic monks in France; the time is January 1944. The story is about how 2 boys become friends, and how one, who is of a rich Paris family, learns that the other is Jewish. One day the Gestapo comes and the Jewish boy is arrested, along with the head of the school who had been hiding him there. Louis Malle, who wrote and directed the movie, said that this is based on a true story in his own childhood, and it is faithfully, even lovingly, produced - yet this parochial French setting during the Nazi occupation seems so strange and different it might have taken place on another planet. Though not much happens - the boys attend classes (in freezing rooms), fight with one another, attend church, exercise, etc. - one's interest never flags. This is mainly for two reasons: it IS so different (the boys sleep in one big dormitory room, they bathe at the public baths in town, their game of war on stilts, the wild boar in the woods, the monks in bare feet); and the tension that builds as we slowly learn of the Jewish boy and then the scene with ""collaborators"" in a restaurant, and then the final outrage with the Gestapo barging in on the school - it happens so subtly yet inevitably that we can't but feel morally outraged and moved at the end. An excellent film; it's also beautifully photographed. Definitely worth a watch.",1114214400,7,1386,4.482213438735178
322169,3,630121613X,"Hollywood has embedded in the minds of movie-goers for generations the horrific images of the Jewish Holocaust during World War II. Though mainly dramatic presentations, there are instances where lighthearted moments are thrown in order to not leave the audience too emotionally depressed, while at the same time not allowing them to leave forgetting about one of the most brutal genocides in our history. Steven Spielberg's epic presentation, Schindler's List, is quite probably one of the most revered of the Holocaust genre, having won numerous awards including Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but there have been many others including The Pianist and Life is Beautiful. But, for one reason or another, foreign releases have failed to embrace, so to speak, this specific subject in their films as much as we have, so when one is released and praised it is only right to stand up and take notice.

The story for Goodbye, Children, based on the childhood experiences of the film's director Louis Malle, is not so much a commentary on the loss of innocence in the midst of the ravaged countryside of France during the second world war as it is instead a direct condemnation of the ignorance of which the French enveloped themselves in during the war and the half-hearted assessment they continue to express toward the Jewish race to this day. True, the conclusion to the film in which Julien is shown starring in stark disbelief at the sight of three of his fellow classmates, including the young Bonnet with whom he had recently established a friendship with, and his mentor does strike an emotional chord, albeit less expressive then that of either Life is Beautiful or Schindler's List, but it is actions expressed by the school boys throughout the earlier portion of the film such as the smoking or the ogling of women that would appear to contradict this belief. There is quite a dramatic difference between the loss of innocence and the discovery of ignorance, the latter applying to Julien and a fair number of the boys within the French Catholic boarding school at the end of the film.

Since this was based on the memoirs of Louis Malle, we as a collective audience have to assume that the events of the film actually took place, but as with nearly every Hollywood production, domestic or foreign, based on actual events, there are bound to be particular sequences which were fabricated in order to either liven up the mood of the picture or to have the script flow more consistently. Sadly, based on educational purposes, Goodbye, Children does not branch far from its focus on the relationship between the two boys in the boarding school, leaving those less familiar with the detailed events of World War II, specifically the assistance of the Vichy government during the Nazi occupation period in tracking down the Jews, completely lost. And though this does feature a leading character who is eventually captured by the Nazis and is sent to die in Auschwitz, this should not be dictated as a ""Holocaust film"" in the sense that it barely acknowledges the suffering of the Jews within the concentration camps at the hand of Nazi cruelty. It is in instances such as these that films like Schindler's List become an invaluable educational tool in bringing the suffering of the Jewish race under the Nazi regime into full view for college students.

It is quite understandable for Malle to portray the French collaborators of the German occupation of France as individuals who are as morally corrupt, if not more so, then the Nazis themselves in part because they are fully aware of what is taking place and yet are allowing it to transpire in order to save their own necks and perhaps make a little change on the side as well. An unmitigated result of Malle venting his frustration toward those who would betray their country as the collaborators had done is that the director appears to go quite easy on the Nazis within the film, going so far as to even portray them as decent human beings. When the Nazis begin to appear sufferable that is usually the telltale sign that this obsession is being taken to an unhealthy level and needs to be quelled immediately.

Gaspard Manesse gives an eloquent performance in the role of Julien, the protagonist of the pictures, who can easily be fathomed as the childlike reflection of the director Louis Malle on whose childhood experiences in occupied France were the basis for this film. Sadly the magnificent performance given by Manesse does not in effect make up for the lack of character development and direction. The motivations and the emotions behind the character Julien are a mystery and appear to come straight out of thin-air. For example, when Julien first meets the new student Bonnet, he snubs him and swears at him. One could apply the ancient excuse of ""boys will be boys"", but can anyone recall a time in their childhood when they acted as he did to a person they had just met? Raphael Fejt performs fairly well opposite Gaspard Manesse, or at least in the scene where they are playing the piano together, and given that this is one of his first feature film roles, there is little to complain about. There are however other problems that concern the character of Bonnet that transcend the performance of the young child actor. The most apparent of which being that the screenwriters rely on a few racial stereotypes of the Jewish race - for example, the admission from Bonnet that his father worked as an accountant before the war - in order to fill out his back-story. Though the script certainly does not follow the route of the Nazis in making the Jews out to be a race to be feared and discriminated, this nonetheless would appear to be going against the message the film attempted to covey upon its audience and acts merely as a telltale sign that the French no matter how much time has passed that they are not entirely absolved of their occupation from the Nazi ideology.

Pere Jean, the benevolent monk in charge of the Catholic boarding school for French boys, is played affectionately by Philippe Morier-Genoud. There are sure to individuals within the audience that will complain that Pere Jean is not seen enough in the film but seeing as how the story's focus is of the relationship between the two boys, Morier-Genoud screen time and his body language within those periods demonstrate a figure that is paternalistic but standoffish enough to allow the children develop without being smothered as they are at home. The scene in which Pere Jean and the three Jewish boys are rounded up by the Nazis and taken to the concentration camps, including Auschwitz, is truly a poignant moment as the boys lose not only their mentor and friend but also the only father figure some of the young children have had in their lives for the past few years.

Overall, Goodbye Children, though undoubtedly conceived as a copious perspective of the trepidation that was the Jewish Holocaust, instead acts merely as a subservient and adolescent equivalent to the realistic, emotionally driven, and vastly superior Schindler's List, a historical masterpiece truly worthy of the recognition it has received. It is quite ironic that a film whose storyline involves Jews hidden by Christian monks in a boys boarding school during World War II would be made in France, which is undoubtedly one of the most anti-Semitic countries in all of Europe. With synagogues being blown up or burnt down and Jewish graves being vandalized with Swastikas spray painted onto them not being uncommon news in France, it is hard to imagine this film ever invoking too much of an emotional reaction from its audiences. But even if it had been well received within Malle's native land, there is little doubt that the French populous would have learned anything more of value then the American audiences had received, which was sadly very little.",1113436800,8,7887,4.855869242199108
