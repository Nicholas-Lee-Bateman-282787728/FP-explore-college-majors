2983545,5,B000WMA72M,"I just want to say that I liked first two seasons very much and definitely gonna buy it in future.

I can't tell for this set, but we can notice that in first two seasons were in total 8 DVD's. In this set we can find 12, so 4 DVD's with extra's I guess. Plus, it's great that this set have subtitles.

In Europe we already have 3rd season, so people who want to buy whole series, please, wait until all seasons are released in complete box-set.",1200009600,6,445,4.103448275862069

8223750,5,B000WMA72M,"My husband & I absolutely LOVE this show, so when I couldn't find the series on DVD anywhere else, I grabbed it up right quick on here! Even though we've seen every episode, and usually multiple times, it's still funny every time we watch any of them again. Some of the best laughter we've had, has been watching this collection. Looking forward to the next 2 seasons! Can't wait!

And as a side note: When we only got 1/2 our order, Amazon.com didn't hesitate in crediting my account that same day!",1228435200,,499,4.483516483516484
8223751,5,B000WMA72M,"This two set DVD was thoroughly entertaining, funny and showcased very fine interactive talent.  I especially enjoyed the ""extra"" footage that is included only in the DVD set, where the producers, directors, and other behind the scenes staff offered their input into what makes these shows so enjoyable.",1210982400,,303,5.3125

Get this series.  You won't be sorry!",1202860800,2,204,4.2894736842105265
