8110951,3,B000ELJAVU,"I found the video quite interesting. Even though I expected a different approach (a more historical one), many of the images and the top tens have brought back memories of extraordianry moments of this great sport. The narration in spanish could have been a little less euphoric, but it was OK. In summary, a very good product for the FIFA lovers.",1210809600,,347,4.704918032786885
8110952,5,B000ELJAVU,"If you like futbol(soccer)than you will love this production. It is , without a doubt one of the best productions of World Cup I have ever seen and I've seen a few. This is an historical DVD that covers the World Cup from the beginning. There are lots of subjective observations by the producers but in fairness, all angles are covered. It is kind of hard to sort out the best of anything, especially something like World Cup that has such a storied and rich history. You have the best goals, best forwards, mids, defenders, goalies, most memorable runs, saves , controversial calls, unusual plays, goofs(put to slap stick music),best captains, refs, coaches, etc. I mean it is all covered. Seeing the old black and white footage was amazing ,especially if , like me , you have never seen some of the footage. It goes back to the first televised World Cup, the first color broadcast and into the modern era. They even cover hair styles and fan attire! For the soccer or futbol fan this is the best show. Two DVD's of just highlights. Goal after goal from different eras, from different stars , it is all captured on this amazing video. Check it out. Recommended for the futbol(soccer) aficionado in your universe.",1207958400,4,1213,4.672897196261682
