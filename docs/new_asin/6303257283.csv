7841852,4,6303257283,"Dr. Savaard is conducting an experiment to use an artificial heart apparatus on a volunteer to revive him after he dies. Dr. Savaard first kills the young man and then starts the revival process. His nurse, who is also the young mans girlfriend, panics and contacts the police. They come and interrupt the revival process before the young man comes back to life. Dr. Saavard is convicted of murder and hanged. Hes brought back to life and ingeniously seeks revenge on all who wronged him. This is a very interesting, very engaging science fiction/thriller. Similar at times to And Then There were none as the Dr. tries to eliminate his enemies one by one.  Acting is generally solid (Karloff is always stellar) but his nurse, Ann Doran, would get a Razzie if they had the awards at that time. This is a good movie, though, that  will keep your interest. Very entertaining.",1488585600,,872,4.730263157894737

7841855,5,6303257283,Above average creeper well worth the time. Karloff's performance is brilliant!,1426118400,,78,6.181818181818182
7841856,5,6303257283,"I first saw ""The Man They Could Not Hang"" in the early 1960's on one of the now legendary late Saturday night ""Horror Movie""  TV shows. It's as good as ever, and a rather interesting theme. Karloff is a Doctor who invents a Heart and Lung pump; a young man volunteers for the experimental test, during which his heart will be stopped for a few minutes, and then be re-started, the purpose being to be able to operate on the human body with less risk than conventional anesthesia, especially for dangerous things they could not then do, such as open-heart surgery. He is interrupted by the police, brought in by the hysterical and fearful girl-friend, the young man dies, Karloff's character is arrested, tried, and hung for murder. Then the real fun begins! The doctor's body is claimed by his assistant, who revives him with the machine, and then the Doctor takes his revenge on the jury, with a mysterious invitation to a gathering at the ""late"" doctor's palatial home, and that's where the real ""horror movie"" entertainment  begins!

The Dallons Brothers medical glassware company built the ""heart and lung"" machine for this movie (glass movie props were an un-advertised side-line); many years later, they made one of the very first actual heart pumps. I've had ""On-Pump"" open-heart surgery, and your heart is stopped, just as in this anticipatory sci-fi, and you are revived within 45 minutes (after that, it's too late!), just as in the fictional doctor's thesis. It's a bit uncanny when an early sci-fi comes so close to later reality as this one does. I rate this as one of Karloff's best in the ""Mad Doctor"" series of films.",1347840000,,1633,4.783687943262412
7841857,5,6303257283,"Karloff is the king of monsters but that's not all he played.
Here he plays a scientist working on an experiment but when
his nurse calls the police it results in a death and Karloff
is sentenced to hang. But his assistant brings him back to
life and of course he's gone mad and wants revenge. Great
writing and acting by all make this one of his best.
I've had this for years and watched over and over again.",1333843200,,409,4.189873417721519
7841858,4,6303257283,"Thanks to dir. Nick Grinde and the skills of Mr. Karloff, "" The Man They could Not Hang"" is a good thiller. This film along with other Columbia/Karloff entrys are well conceived.
"" The Black Room"" and "" Before I Hang"" are similiar entrys and are done well also. This concept of revenge against a jury that Hangs Dr. Savaard is unique for the 30's .
With that being said...where are other Karloff films such as the 1941 film "" The Devil Commands"" dir by Ed Dmytryk.??",1017273600,,466,4.367816091954023

This is an interesting Karloff movie, in which a doctor (played by Karloff) tries to bring the dead back to life after a death, like, say an  surgical operation and such. Then all ""heck"" breaks loose! This  movie has lots to think about too!",959040000,4,318,4.283333333333333
