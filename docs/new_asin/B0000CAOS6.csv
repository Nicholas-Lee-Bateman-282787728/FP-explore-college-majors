7998583,5,B0000CAOS6,"I had read the original comics when they came out in the early 2000s and really missed them (now that Crossgen is defunct).  So, it's was a great surprise to see a digital comic of my favorite series and universe come out.  If you haven't seen a digital comic before, they're kind of like the old ""Clutch Cargo"" cartoons of the 1950s or the limited X-Men videos  (from the 70's, I think).  As you watch this, you'll be surprised to not really care that there isn't any real animation, just cut-outs of the comic pages moving around on the screen.  But combine that with the sound and voices, they do come alive.  It's great fun.",1264982400,3,628,4.417391304347826
