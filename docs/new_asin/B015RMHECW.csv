8734365,5,B015RMHECW,Excellent. My error was getting them separately  and as a set. The separate ones had companion cd's .The  interesting  is this set featured their tours with their original pianist.and their first tour since his untimely death.,1509408000,3,226,5.222222222222222
8734366,4,B015RMHECW,The 82 concert at Leeds is a stinker in my opinion.  The one from 1971 is good but not quite as good as I expected.  The other three in this set are all excellent.,1489881600,3,163,3.764705882352941
