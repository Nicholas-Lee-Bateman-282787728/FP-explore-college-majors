8422120,3,B004BOGTF6,"Very mediocre. Does not touch important topics such as syncopation and time signatures. Mark goes by way to fast and jumps from a simple block chord arrangement to one with alternating bass rhythm and more difficult melody. This left me with more questions than answers. For example,
1. When is the melody note played with the beat and when isn't it?
2. How are rhythms determined and crafted for each song?
3. How do we keep time for each song? Not a single chart is shown as he speaks so we have to imagine everything. Granted, charts are included but its difficult to follow.",1492041600,,578,4.5673076923076925

It would have been better if he went slower.",1436313600,2,179,4.0
8422124,4,B004BOGTF6,"Basically, I just wanted to put in my question here.

The description says;

Publish date is Feb 1, 2012, however, the DVD case says 2010?

The DVD says 2010.

Why the 2 year difference?

Did they start production in 2010 and finish/publish in 2012?

I'll add/edit as I use the product.",1328572800,,286,4.509803921568627
