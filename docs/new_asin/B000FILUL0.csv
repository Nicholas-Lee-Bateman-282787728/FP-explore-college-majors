2568218,2,B000FILUL0,"This would of been a great Anime movie if it wasn't attached to a story I loved where all the characters I liked got pigeonholed holed into bit players. And it would of helped had they edited it a little more tightly to get to the frigging point.

And the creator has this weird~ WEIRD fetish about basset hounds. His history with the mutt: 'Ghost in the shell'~'StrayDog: Kerberos Panzer Cops'(where his camera is used to be viewed thru a mutts eyes)~ 'Patlabor'~'Patlabor 2'~'Innocence'~'Sky Crawlers' and who knows what else I didn't see!

2568219,5,B000FILUL0,"I'm a huge fan of anime, have been for well over a decade now, and I like a lot of different stuff from the accepted, mainstream greats (Cowboy Bebop, Fullmetal Alchemist) to the strictly entertainment-only fodder (Seitokai no Ichizon, Inuyasha). However, there are very few titles that I would actually recommend to my non-anime fan friends that I wouldn't feel embarrassed about showing them.

This film is one of the few.

That's not to say that this film is more Americanized or more mainstream than other anime, because it's not. If anything this film is deeply invested in Japan's economy and culture, and it's not something mainstream audiences would cling to (read the 1-3 star reviews for evidence).

This film is a masterpiece, a serious film about serious topics by one of the greatest directors the medium has ever seen. Mamoru Oshii's sense of pacing and visual imagery is spot on and absolutely haunting (helped in no small part by the excellent musical score by Kenji Kawai).

However, this film will not be enjoyed by everyone. It is deliberately slow and contemplative with long stretches of philosophical dialogues and monologues. Anyone expecting an action packed political thriller will be disappointed. This is a political film that isn't necessarily about the twists and turns of the plot, but the political ideas presented. What can ultimately be taken away from the film will depend entirely on the viewer.

If you are an anime fan give Patlabor 2 a try. If you don't like it, then it just wasn't meant for you. Nevertheless, it should be recognized as a high-water mark of Japanese animation, and even if you don't enjoy it, you should be open-minded enough to respect the fact that it is trying to make a statement about the real world that inspired it. Something that very few films or TV series within the medium ever hope to even strive for.",1259712000,6,1870,4.849529780564263

2568222,3,B000FILUL0,"I was very excited to get this remastered version of Patlabor 2 from the Bandai Visual label. I've been a huge fan of the movie, and cherish my older Manga version DVD which is now out of print.

The Bandai release visuals lives up to everything it's advertised as: The picture quality has indeed been remastered and looks remarkable. If you plopped down the extra cash for the delux version, you're sure to get all kinds of extra goodies and bonuses. I bought the single disc ""standard"" version and there is almost no bonus material to speak of. But I knew that when I was buying it.

My problem with this edition of Patlabor 2 is in the sound mix. Yes, it's 5.1 as advertised, but here's the difference: The sound mix is the ""Sound Renewal"" mix which producer Kenji Kawaii and director Mamoru Oshii commissioned  and oversaw in 1999. Songs that used to play at certain cues in the 2.0 stereo channel edition that I am used to from the Manga version no longer play. Most - if not all - of the music has been re-recorded with newer synths and sound strange and disorienting. There's also this weird hawk sound motif scattered throughout the movie which is just really odd and out of place? Essentially, the ""Sound Renewal"" mix is the audio equivalant of George Lucas' ""Special Editions"" Star Wars films. That is to say, Oshii and Kawaii went back and re-did a lot of the audio and soundtrack to ""re-envision"" the film. The pacing and mood has changed entirely. For someone like myself so accustomed to the original 2.0 mix, the ""Renewal"" version is so disorienting, it makes the movie unwatachable. And it's noticeable right from the very first scene. I sat and watched the movie for the 1st time waiting for the music to kick in and it never did. It took me about an hour into the movie to ask myself what the hell was going on, hit pause, and do do some research.

I wouldn't mind having the ""Sound Renewal"" 5.1 audio track on the disc if Bandai had also included either the original 2.0 track or remastered the non-""Renewal"" audio track in 5.1. But they didn't. To compound the matter further for a Patlabor 2 purist (many of whom, if you're reading this, are interested in this remastered edition), Bandai makes no mention of ""Sound Renewal"" on the disc's packaging. BUT....all is not lost. Bandai Visual did indeed release a re-mastered video version with the original 2.0 audio track, but it is Region 2 and Region 3 only. And you'll have to research on your own whether or not English subtitles are included; I could not find an answer in regards to that.

This really feels like a missed opportunity on Bandai's part. I thought I was getting the definitive Ptlabor 2 disc with remastered video and sound but alas - I am so used to the original audio mix the film is unwatachable for an old fogey like me. If you're new to Patlabor 2, you're not predisposed like myself, and I wholly suggest picking the film up in its remastered splendor. But anyone else used to the old Manga/2.0 audio mix and soundtrack, you should at least know the deal with this disc's audio track. Whole songs are missing or have been replaced with others. And beware the hawk screech!",1156032000,16,3166,4.557117750439367
2568223,5,B000FILUL0,"The infant Bandai Visual USA, in its quest to outshine the existing Bandai Entertainment USA, has once again shown that it is willing to put far more effort into releasing quality titles in a quality package, just as with their release of ""Patlabor 1: The Movie"" last spring.

A word of warning to those reading the other reviews: any review dated before July of 2006 is refering to the old Manga Entertainment release of ""Patlabor 2"", which is a far inferior disc to this recent Bandai Visual rerelease.

The new release of this film treats it the way that Manga _should_ have treated this gem of the anime industry, with a much better translation of the dialogue, extras that consist of more than trailers for other products by the same company, and a complete storyboard (translated into English, even) for the film.

The new English translation for the dialogue alone makes this version worth buying, as it is obvious that the translators spent a lot more time massaging the languages to provide the characters with more passion and subtlety in their speech.  This is critical in a thinking-man's film, which is the only type of film that Mamoru Oshii directs.  The old Manga version of the film treated the language too lightly, and managed to leave out minor, yet important, parts of the language.  The quality of the film still showed through the Manga bungling, but with this version the film truly shines.

The extras for this Limited Collector's Edition are, simply, wonderful.  Just as with the LCE of ""Patlabor 1"" there is seperate Special Features disc including a making-of documentary, and two books.  One of the books provides essays about the film and its meaning at the time it was released as well as essays and interviews dating from later times.  These provide the reader with some perspective of what the film meant to Japanese audiences in 1993 when it was released, and how its meaning and significance is changing as time passes.

The other booklet is a complete translated storyboard for the film, which is intriguing because it shows how the film's shots were originally constructed, and the small notes in it can provide insight into specific details and elements required by the director (Mamoru Oshii) which on the surface seem insignificant, but which actually set much of the atmosphere and tone for the film.

Are these extras necessary to enjoy the film?  No, they aren't.  In fact, if you're just interested in watching the movie in which Mamoru Oshii crystalized his signature style (later to be repeated in ""Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Innocence""), then I'd say get the standard release of this film by Bandai Visual (released in early July of '06).  The extras would mostly be of interest to the hardcore ""Patlabor"" fans, or those curious about the process of creating animted films.

A final word of warning to long-time ""Patlabor"" watchers; with these Bandai Visual USA film releases, some long-running characters in the saga receive their fourth or fifth English-language voices; the Japanese voices remain constant, but the English ones switch (at least partially) with every new series, movie, or production company.",1153353600,17,3156,4.948863636363637

2568299,5,B000FILUL0,"This is Mamoru Oshii's best film, hands down.  This is also one of the best political thrillers and police dramas that I have ever watched.  This film has Oshii's now standard philosophical ramblings, but here it's done in a way that isn't quite as overbearing as it will be in later films, like Ghost In The Shell, although the philosophical angle is part of why people hail that film in the first place.  The film also has a great music score, again composed by Kenji Kawai.  As with the first film and all of the other entries in franchise, Patlabor 2 takes place in a world where mecha (called Labors) are a part of everyday life, from construction sites to police departments, and even the military.  Unlike the first film, however, this movie does not focus on what happens when nutcase employees write viruses into the operating systems of the various machines used by everyone in the world.  Instead, this movie focuses on the more mature themes of love and war, with love being represented by Gotoh's unrequited love for Nagumo, and Shinobu's apparently still alive love for a man named Tsuge, who disappeared after a peacekeeping tour of duty in southeast asia in 1999.  Tsuge, however, has apparently become more than a bit embittered and has become a terrorist, and he manages to take Tokyo hostage without ever once getting his own hands dirty in the process.  The war is represented by Tsuge and his actions, which bring about a manner of civil unrest and even a declaration of martial law as corruption within the police force and rising tensions between Japanes Self Defense Force and possible actions from the United States (we still have military bases over there, ever since the end of WWII) begin to escalate.

This is storytelling at its finest, and I'd be hard pressed to find a live action film that manages to do what this film does in its runtime.  Sadly, I know that many people will probably ignroe this film simply because it's animated.  The other year when I tried to show this movie to my dad (I had bought the single disc edition at Suncoast), he was almost intrigued, until he realized that it was an anime and he promptly wanted nothing to do with it.  Still, the fact remains that this is a great political thriller, and the more mature themes (not mature in the way that teenagers and AV sites think of) that are explored here are done to great effect.  This film has less focus on the entirety of the Special Vehicles Unit Division 2 than the previous film, as it focuses mostly on Gotoh and Nagumo, the leaders of Divisions 1 and 2, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining.  Sure, there are no loud mouth remakrs from Otah until the third act, and we don't get to see much of Asuma and Noa outside of the opening credits and the third act, and...um, actually, yeah, nearly everyone is absent until the third act except for Detective Matsui, who gets to have some presence sproadically throughout the film, much as he did in the first one.  Despite the impact that Tsuge has on the plot, he actually doesn't appear very much outside of maybe three or four scenes total, and that's counting a photograph of him found in a folder during a discussion between Gotoh and Arakawa.  Mr. Arakawa, being a smug snake looking fellow, has actually less impact on the events that unfold in the plot, but much more presence than the man with the most impact.  Now that is a case of irony.  The discussions that Arakawa and Gotoh have throughout the film are not only delightfully philosophical, but also quite political and pragmatic as well.  The English dub really works well here, as the new one commissioned for Image Entertainment's DVDs was doen professionally, and all of the voices fit with the characters and their personalities.

As with the previous film's Limited Edition DVD, there are two discs in a book-like case, along with two booklets.  These are all housed within a gold-colored, uh, housing.  The first booklet is basically a ""making of"" booklet, or archives booklet.  It goes over the film, how it was made, comparisons between two episodes of the OVA and the second movie, character designs, interviews with cast and crew (especially Mamoru Oshii himself), technical specifications for the variosu locations, places, and people, and even short character bios alongside their designs.  A short version of this booklet, with only the characters, locations, and equipment, can be found with the Single-Disc edition.  The second booklet contains storyboards, storyboards, storyboards, more storyboards, and finally, storyboards.  As with the other Limited Edition, the first disc has the movie, in widescreen, with Japanese and English adio and subtitles, along with some Japanese trailers for the film.  The second disc has a making of feature.  Having already owned the single-disc edition, I have to say that this Limited Edition is a vast improvement.  Not only in terms of extra features, but also in terms of audio quality, as the single disc version had a problem with the English dub being too low in certain parts of the film, and too loud in others.  Here, however, that problem is not present, as the English dub is consistent the whole way.

As with the previous film, I would recommend both this movie and DVD to anyone with an interest in anime, robots, robotic engineering, and politics and police drama.  The plot is a solid thriller, Early Years of Tom Clancy level (like Red October level, not his later works), and the characters are great to watch.  The animation is very nice, and it clearly has a similar look to what Oshii would use for 1995's Ghost In The Shell.  Bottom line, this is gold.",1357084800,7,5664,4.757668711656442

2568302,5,B000FILUL0,"In contrast to the relatively light Patlabor TV and OVA series, the three Patlabor movies were deeper and more serious, and 'Patlabor 2' is the most serious of them all.  Dark and ambitious, rich in symbolism and metaphor, 'Patlabor 2' feels much closer to Mamarou Oshii's later work such as 'Ghost In The Shell' than to the remainder of the Patlabor cannon. There is little of the trademark fun and humour, far less mecha action than before, and the pace of the film is very measured. In addition, the main cast from the TV series such as Asuma and Noa are largely sidelined (or in the case of Kanuka, absent entirely), with the focus squarely on Gotoh and especially Nagumo.

But don't worry, Patlabor fans. Yes, it is different than what you're used to, but this is a really good film.

It's best to go into a movie like this without giving too much away, but it's safe to say there are no mad runaway labors or Scooby Doo haunted houses here. 'Patlabor 2' is at its heart a complicated political thriller involving what appears to be a military coup against the government. This doesn't sound like something the SV2 would normally deal with (although it is similar to a story from the original OVA), however they are slowly dragged into the story when it is revealed that the man behind the alleged coup has a connection to Nagumo Shinobu.

And for Patlabor fans, this is where the movie is important in the series overall. It addresses the one unresolved character point, the backstory of Nagumo. Nagumo has always been a favourite of mine because she is such an enigma; outwardly a dedicated and by-the-book police officer, she nevertheless shares Gotoh's distrust and cynicism towards authority, often siding with him over her superiors. How did such a strong and capable officer get shunted out to a backwater like the SV2, and why does she carry the huge chip on her shoulder? 'Patlabor 2' does an excellent job of fleshing out these aspects of Nagumo's persona; she is the central character in the movie, and her past is woven thickly into the main plot.

The bulk of the film is spent trying to unravel the reason for the coup, and indeed whether a coup is happenning at all. As with many Oshii films, the film is not afraid to devote some time to philosophical back-and-forth, as the characters ruminate on the fortunes of war and the method behind the apparent madness that is taking place. This is definitely one film you will need to watch several times, and do some serious thinking about, to fully appreciate the depth of its story and in particular the motivation of the antagonist.

The film does lighten a little in the third act, where the main cast re-unite to deal with the situation. There are a few humorous moments as well as some typical mecha action. This part of the film comes closest to capturing the lighter feel of the Patlabor OVA/TV series, and allow us to re-connect one more time with our favourite characters. Designed as the true conclusion to the series overall, the film also offers a few insights into the new directions the characters will take with their lives. These moments provide some relief from the heavy politics of the central story, as well as giving something back to long-time fans.

As with the first 'Patlabor' movie, the animation and direction are top-notch, especially considering this is nearly 20 years old now. In keeping with Oshii's later works, there is a heavier emphasis on symbolism (the snow falling, the birds...), and on showing montages of scenes without dialogue (the military build-up in Tokyo), which add to the depth and seriousness of the film. The script is very complex and thought-provoking; the political elements have attracted some criticism for being overly Nationalist and/or anti-Western, but it's the sort of story that can be taken on different levels and left up to individual interpretation.

In all, something very different but very good. Oshii succeeds brilliantly in taking what had been a predominantly fun series and turning it inward into darker and more ambitious territory. Provided you are willing to accept that this is an Oshii film first and a Patlabor film second, this is well worth seeking out, for Patlabor and political thriller fans alike.",1318809600,2,4249,4.803009575923393
