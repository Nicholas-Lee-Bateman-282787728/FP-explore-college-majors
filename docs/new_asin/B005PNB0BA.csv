But I love time travel stories, comedies, and foreign films (this is in French with English subtitles), so I decided to give it a shot.  The first half of the first season was enjoyable - the writing was funny and the characters were fun, so I stuck with it.  But halfway through the season, the main plot is revealed, and I absolutely couldn't peel my eyes away from there on out.

Season 1 is clearly very low-budget, but that doesn't really matter - it has a great story, and that's all you really need.  The production values increase dramatically with every subsequent season, so by the 4th season, it's an absolutely beautiful production.  Sets, costumes, makeup and hair, cinematography, CGI - it's all wonderful.

This series is available on YouTube (user: watchthevisitor), so it's worth watching there before purchasing this DVD - it's only available from third-party sellers outside of France anyway, and it's less expensive to order from Amazon.fr and have it shipped to the US (that's what I did).  Just be sure your DVD player can handle region 2 DVDs.

Do you like laughing? Clever, thoughtful time travel stories? Excellent writing and superb acting? Creative and thorough world building? Zombies and narcissistic robots? Good-looking French people with great hair?  Do not miss this series.",1402963200,,1421,4.957805907172996
