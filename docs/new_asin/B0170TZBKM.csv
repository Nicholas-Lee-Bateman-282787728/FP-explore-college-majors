8737777,5,B0170TZBKM,"The documentary shows pretty well what a wonderful living everybody has in this communist Shangry-la and how Western pigs are jealous of this country. Of course, when the director visits a perfect house and asks to see what inside the fridge, he is not allowed ""because the woman is shy"", When he goes to church and there's no communion, he's told ""the priest is not well today""; When he sees brand new H.Packard computers and asks where were they bought he's told ""it's a secret"". People have free education, where they learn (for free, of course) that the leader is above all. Catholic religion is permitted but you can not enter the country with a Bible. Hospitals are free, but there's no medicines. And the director and the crew were, at ALL times, acompannied by a bunch of Korean guides, never to be allowed to bleave the hotel or walk alone. See? there's nothing to hide...
And the Spanish man who voluntarily joind the North Korean forces is worth of being on a James Bond movie.",1506211200,,988,4.619318181818182
8737778,4,B0170TZBKM,"Informative. Of course DPRK controlled what the film maker could see. The film also included Western commentary. I wish we could know the truth about whether some people in DPRK like their government. The scenes of masses of people sobbing when their leader passed away, seemed genuine.",1505174400,,286,5.1063829787234045
8737779,5,B0170TZBKM,This documentary offers a fair presentation of North Korea from the perspectives of North Koreans. The world has been drowned by American propaganda for far too long and the North Korean point of view has been suppressed. This documentary tries to bridge the gap between North Korea and the rest of the world which is controlled by the Americans. Subjects covered by the interviews show the usual belligerent American propaganda and scaremongering to how North Koreans feel threatened by the Americans.,1502150400,,502,5.209876543209877
8737780,2,B0170TZBKM,"This was a film about frightened people.
There was certainly a lot of talk about ""the people"". There was certainly a great absence of them in this film which was just a puff piece for the North Korean acolytes. Where WERE the crowds? Every time you saw a bunch of people they looked just like choreographed nodders in a stage play.
I didn't expect director Alejandro to get access to the peasants in the country but at least there might have been one or two questions worthy of the name investigative journalist. The only time Lord Haw Haw seemed flustered is when he asked him how a coca cola machine had manage to find its way into the country! One and a half hours of nothing. Having recently read Barbara Demick's ""Nothing to Envy"" I was quite angry with the quality of the film altogether. It appeared to me as a case of All Fur No Knickers which has become so prevalent in today's society. I have seen similar films made about Hitler's Germany and Stalinist Russia that would have benefited from such propaganda. It even ran Harry Anslinger's scandalous war on Hemp a close second for lies and deceits.

The only interesting piece was in the last ten minutes when the real reasons for North Korea's continued existence was revealed
1  China - needs to keep a buffer zone with the USA as does Russia
2. Japan - fears the power of a united Korea
3. South Korea fears the econnomic burden of unification. cf West Germany 1989

I should imagine the fear of being killed would certainly make me toe the party line but as a journalist the director needed to help these people with intelligent questions. Where does the money come from? Where does it go? If it's so great why do you have to stop people from leaving?
I read recently that CNN have sacked all their investigative journalists. If this is true I fear for the future. Not for me in my 70s but for my grandchildren.
Bad things happen when a a good man does nothing.
Alejandro I'm sure is a good man...",1465862400,,1961,4.456824512534819
8737781,4,B0170TZBKM,"Film maker lvaro Longoria managed to get permission to film inside the DPRK but it was a guided tour  that was to be expected. His tour was exclusively of the cosseted capital Pyongyang. However, Longoria knew that there would be restrictions on what he could and more importantly could not film.

His guides take him on a tour of all the new shiny buildings and installations and shows us all the shiny happy North Koreans enjoying the gifts of the benevolent Kim Jong-un. Everywhere there are statues and pictures of The Great Leaders who must be constantly adored as some sort of deity and the people seem to have genuine emotions about these dictators. The film also interviews experts and defectors as well as human rights activists and strives to show both sides in the ever growing propaganda war.

The attempts to be balanced are credit worthy and Longoria himself missed his calling for the diplomatic mission. I was reminded of a Benny Hill sketch where an advertising board said People buy Smiths Pies because they don't know any better; and I think that is why North Koreans seem to be so content with their lot in the World  they just do not know what they are missing. He did mention the markets and the hard currency shops which the regime has had to allow to exist as it was too troublesome to uninvent choice as it were.

What is left out is equally important and any one who has studied this hermit kingdom will know of some of the bizarre and cruel abuses of human rights, but the whole point of the film is to redress the more extreme distortions of propaganda and try to see if there is any unvarnished truth that would help us understand them. In the end I felt he did a rather good job and as such can recommend to anyone who has an interest in modern social history.",1465603200,,1790,4.495384615384616
8737782,2,B0170TZBKM,"This movie is ostensibly about the propaganda put out by the North Korean government. However, the documentary itself becomes a victim to the propaganda with or without realizing it. As a result, the movie is merely a platform for the North Korean government to project its twisted version of reality, without offering any counter. The documentary suffers from the common disease of moral equivalence, demonstrating a lack of even the ability to make a moral assessment on a regime that mercilessly persecutes its own people.",1459209600,,525,5.188235294117647
