8099957,5,B000CPH9UW,"Having now played and re-played this DVD for a few months, I find it is a clear, generous effort on the part of Michael Manring to communicate the essentials of his style to other bassists.  Unlike some musicians who do instructional DVDs, he is a thoughtful and articulate communicator.  The subject matter is not for beginners, nor even 'normal' bass players- he covers topics exclusively related to his solo style, including alternate tunings, his unusual gear including his Hyperbass, string types, the use of the Ebow, and instructions (including a booklet in note/tab) on how to play several pieces on his album Thonk!.  Thankfully, I found that in spite of it seeming that I could never take a shot at any of this without his specific gear, I could approximate many of his sounds with the right effects box and a set of piccolo strings (quite cheap).  Reading and playing from the book is a challenge, though- much of his music uses BOTH the treble and bass staff! Not for the faint of heart, although thoroughly inspiring.
