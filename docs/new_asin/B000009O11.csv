1197662,5,B000009O11,"The Double McGuffin is a superb film, and all that I wanted to say is: Don't miss the Double Mcguffin.
Adults sometimes don't like the plot, because many times, they are a little bit stupid, sorry for be rude.
Many people don't see or notice the small information, facts, dialogues and scenes that, in the end of the story, make we understand the essentials and ""message"" from the authors. I agree with chatatumjr, who said more about Greg Hodges (blond guy) and Dion Pride, who should made a succesful career and didn't, I don't understand it up to now... moreover, the trailer also shows that Double Mcguffin would be his introducing to cinema...
 Thank you very much and did, I would be delighted if anyone mail me! I would like to build a Double Mcguffin site soon!",1032912000,2,769,4.613138686131387
1197663,3,B000009O11,"When this film came out in 1979, I was eleven years old. Then, it was the best film of my young life. Now, it is okay, but a neat trip down memory lane.
Specks (Dion Pride), Homer (Greg Hodges), Foster (Vincent Spano), and Billy Ray (Jeff Nicholson) are all junior high age buddies at a private boarding school. They have frequent minor brushes with the law, easy going Chief ""Tally"" Talasek (George Kennedy, in one of his most cuddly-likable performances). The boys are boys until Homer finds a briefcase full of cash in the nearby woods. He takes his friends back to the place he hid it- and they find a dead body with a bullet in the head. The boys then take Tally back, and find nothing.
A mysterious man (Ernest Borgnine) begins hanging around town, sporting Homer's found briefcase. As Tally is called in on yet another dead end investigation over the cash free case, the boys begin suspecting the mystery man of something. Since this is a mystery, I cannot give too much away. Our young heroes enlist the aid of school paper reporter Jody (Lisa Whelchel) and nerdy tattletale Arthur (Michael Gerard), and the group sets elaborate traps to collect evidence on the mystery man and his newly arrived henchmen. Eventually, the group must switch from evidence collecting to actually getting Tally to arrest the men before they carry out a political assassination on Elke Sommer's hard to believe foreign prime minister character.
As I said, this was a better film twenty years ago than it is now. The scenes involving the giant bulky school computers are now just funny. Kennedy's explanation of sending a criminal's photo over the wire to Washington, then having results on that suspect in an hour, is so antiquated as to also be humorous. Even the modern boys themselves must use rotary dial telephones. A few scenes here and there run too long, and the climax is clever but not exactly action filled.
On a positive note, I wanted to be just like these kids. Their dormitory room has secret compartments everywhere, hiding everything from a TV and stereo to junk food and a single beer being saved for a special occasion. They run around and solve crimes, with very little physical harm being threatened. Although set at a school, no one seems to go to class- every kid's dream.
Dion Pride and Greg Hodges did nothing else after this, according to IMDB. That is a shame. Pride warbles the film's flimsy songs, but he has great screen presence as the group's unofficial leader. Hodges is a riot as Homer, whether he is trying to hide the briefcase full of cash or reading a Playboy in the background of a dialogue scene. Spano and Nicholson are also good. Gerard, as the always flustered Arthur, is also funny, and threatens to steal the film from Hodges once he is introduced. I can proudly say I had a crush on Lisa Whelchel before she took the good, took the bad, took them both, and then she had ""The Facts of Life."" She is so cute here, it is criminal.
Kennedy is good, Borgnine is vaguely threatening without scaring youngsters, but Sommer is given nothing to do but be filmed from great distances and briefly flash the camera. Borgnine's henchmen are played with athletic stiffness by Ed ""Too Tall"" Jones (Go Cowboys!) and Lyle Alzado.
Camp throws in a few funny inside jokes as well in an otherwise normal directorial routine. A radio has Verne Lundquist analyzing Jones and Alzado's football strategies. A book rack is full of paperback books about the canine icon Benji, who Camp trained and whose films he directed. Little things like this are fun to watch out for.
Orson Welles tells us in the ominous opening narration that a McGuffin is the driving force that propels the suspense forward; the main reason behind the story. Here, it is the briefcase and its constantly changing contents, but also its incredibly fun cast and breezy conspiracy. Although not as good as I remember it being (and what is after twenty years?), ""The Double McGuffin"" can still be a charming experience. I do recommend it.
This is rated (PG) for mild gore, profanity, very brief female nudity, very brief male nudity, and adult situations.",1023148800,17,4133,4.725761772853185
1197664,4,B000009O11,"This movie was shot in '79, which means I was 12 when I saw it.  The fact that I remember it today (and just ordered a copy for my kids) is my endorsement.
I like this movie because I remember coming out of the  theatre as a kid thinking, ""It's cool to be smart.""
How many  mystery movies for kids today are there, anyway?  Get them something that  will make them think, and not about the action-figure tie-in with  McDonalds.",936316800,2,426,4.2625

1197681,4,B000009O11,"I remember watching this movie as a kid so I recently purchased it for nostalge reasons. I was quite shocked to realize that there is nudity in the first few minutes of this film, so it's not exactly family friendly. Skip this one if you have kids or object to nudity.",1171238400,,268,4.2745098039215685
1197682,4,B000009O11,"As the mother of one of the boys in this movie, I was very excited to find it is now on DVD. Our VHS copies are old and so we ordered a couple of the DVDs. It will be fun to watch it again.

  This movie is a good movie for old and young, even though a couple of scenes were a bit long.  We have enjoyed watching it along with our grandchildren, especially seeing our son as a teenager again.  The kids in this movie did a good job and were fun to be around during the filming, as they had to have a parent with them.

  Yes, things in the movie, such as the computers, have changed, but I think kids today will enjoy the mystery of this film.",1157414400,6,643,3.854961832061069
1197683,5,B000009O11,"i agree i watched this as a kid late 70s early 80s and i am now 36 and thought that possibly it wasn't going to be as good as i had thought after all those years. But i watched it with my 3 boys, they loved it as much as i did and i loved it just as much. A must see",1140825600,3,266,3.306451612903226
1197684,5,B000009O11,"First, if one reviewer was actually in the film and loved it, how come he only gave it 2 stars?  For being in it, he should have given it 5!

Now this film was always on my mind since around 1980 when I was a young child.  I NEVER forgot about this film.  This film always had a special place in my heart as I always wanted to be like the kids, smart, rich and having secret compartments in their rooms.

I used to watch this film every chance I could on either HBO or The Movie Channel back when those channels were indeed premium.  I recalled that it came on a lot, but not that much.  Then it just stopped coming on and I had not seen it since around 1981 or so.  That is a good while.  I recently tracked down the DVD.  I am a DVD purist, so I was disappointed that it was not widescreen , if it was ever shot in widescreen.  The picture quality was surprisingly great for a film that not many recall or ever heard of.  The DVD quality was great overall, but some extras could have worked.  I don't even think it had the trailer on it.  I saw a trailer on the internet.

Upon watching this movie, I was watching to see if I got the same feeling I had when I recalled it from so long ago.  I wanted to see if it would have the same effect on me now as it did back then.  I have to say that it did!  Unlike a lot of movies that i loved from back in the day (16 Candles and a lot of kung-fu films), it was still as good as I recalled.  Only the computers(I did not know of or had ever heard of anything called a computer back then.  I did know about Atari though!) and other technology looks so -old now.

As I watched, I was looking to see if I would become mystified at the setup which is the discovery of the case with the money in it.  I was.  Also, as I watched the film, I realized that this film, the characters, their lines and most everything else shaped my personality and being.  Yeah, it's that deep.  As a little kid, this had a profound influence on me.  Watching it and realizing this was shocking.  It also let me see how it is to get older and remember back 25 years ago!  That in and of itself is shocking!  I can also recall the time period very well as for some reason, they were the best years of my life.  Maybe it was because of Star Wars or the neighborhood.  I don't know, but you can't go wrong with this film.

One other thing, at the time, I did not realize that the kids were 'country.'  Dion Pride playing the guitar, I did not realize who he was.  I thought that he was just a new actor.  He did a great job.  I could not find a credit for him being in anything else which is weird.  I did not realize that he sang the songs in the film too!  Then I looked it up and saw that he was Charlie Pirde's son.  That made sense.  That arthur character, back then I did not know if he was a male or female and I am still not sure today!  That one cannot be solved with age.",1126742400,4,2897,3.9173838209982788
