8449268,5,B004Z24ZSW,"If you have ever been to a live Canned Heat concert you have probably witnessed a drum solo by de la Parra, who is indisputably one of the best blues/rock drummers of his generation.  It is usually the high point of the evening.  He has probably done hundreds, if not thousands, of them over the years and few were ever saved for posterity.  But this DVD offers a choice selection of those that were (luckily) taped and captured on film, both vintage and recent.  They range from terrific to jaw-dropping (the last one in particular is in the jaw-dropping category!), though each one is quite different.  Some are funky and others delicately intricate.  Some make you want to get up and dance, while others rivet you to your seat.  All eleven are exciting to hear and watch.  Together they are just long enough to make this DVD an important tribute to de la Parra's virtuosity, but short enough to leave you wishing for a couple more.  This is a must-have for drummers and collectors of course.  For the rest of us, it's a seriously great evening of fabulous music to share with friends or just lose yourself in alone.",1309046400,,1118,4.57286432160804
