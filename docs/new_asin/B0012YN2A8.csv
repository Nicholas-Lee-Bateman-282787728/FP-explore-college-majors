3099617,5,B0012YN2A8,"I have now watched Random Passage 3 times, each time I find it more fascinating. I especially like the way the director keeps the camera focused on small objects in the houses as wells as dwelling on the expressions of the faces. The actress that plays the lead Mary is especially good as well as the actress writing the story, both of their voices are so unique and haunting. True it is not a movie that is filled with continual action scenes, but is rather a painting that captivates one soul.  My only regret is that there is not a cd with the music,  I would love to listen to it.",1359244800,,584,4.252252252252252

3099621,1,B0012YN2A8,"I thought this would be great, since it features Colm Meaney, but the man has to make a living. The rave reviews here are misleading, so I'm compelled to provide you a differing view. This is not realistic historic narrative, but like a really bad high-school play, the worst thing I've seen in a long time. Meaney plays a down-trodden fake priest, the only man resistant to being grabbed-at by Random Passage's rabid heroine. I totally enjoyed the shameless Meaney in the wonderful ""The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But Came Down A Mountain.""

The filming of landscape in Random Passage is its only good feature. That's it. It begins with a beautifully filmed Irish coastline, then quickly descends into utter stupidity soon thereafter, with some of the worst acting I've ever seen: a woman dies, yet her tongue continues to loll distractingly about her wide-open mouth, while child unconvincingly pretends to a simper. I'm not kidding. The director should never be allowed to make anything else. Only a few moments are spent in Ireland (the tongue-rolling moment), and then the story becomes an idiotic bodice ripper, totally unwatchable. I couldn't subject myself to one more close-up of bad acting, with a dyed red-haired ""actress"" flouncing around (she's supposed to be Irish, so they sopped her hair in super-orange coloring) making bulbous goo-goo eyes. She gropes her bed-fellows in a lurid and graphic plot, unfit for children or discerning adults.  The acting is abysmal and amateurish, except for Meaney, cloying and cheesy, with the smarmy production values of ""Little House on the Prairie,"" or Spielbergian Smaltz.

Poor Colm Meaney (excellent in ""Layer Cake"" and everything else, he's a great actor) is stuck here in a horrible role. Don't waste your time or money, get the intense and accurate Irish series ""The Hanging Gale,"" with superb acting and historic realism (instead of this terrible costume drama). Here's a great selection to enjoy:

3099622,4,B0012YN2A8,"One of the most enjoyable dvd's I have viewed this year. The technical aspects of photography are top notch. Lighting, camera angles, sharpness and natural color are outstanding. Each member of the cast does a wonderful performance. This six and a half hour story in four one and one half hour segments moves at a comfortable pace. I did one segment per evening and found myself eager to move to the next segment. It is a fine story and a good visual representation of early times in a remote area of New Foundland. This is a outstanding family film filled with strong family values, however, some scenes may not be appropriate for the very young.

He was very good, but so were all the others around him,even though they are not known by American audiences.  I think there were moments when my eyes were misty, and it had a satisfying ending.

3099625,5,B0012YN2A8,"Setting: Cape Random, Newfoundland, a tiny cod fishing station barely clinging to life.

Plot: In 1815, two unlikely families almost literally wash ashore. Mary Keane (Darragh Kelly), a young Irish woman with her illegitimate daughter comes as a stowaway. Mary has been tossed out of her home, watched her mother starve to death, and been raised in the Workhouse under the vilest conditions. Finally getting away as a maid, she is sexually confronted by her new master, then tossed into the streets. Her 'protector', a worthless wharf rat, impregnates her, gets her wrongly implicated in a murder, and then connives to strand her at Cape Random.

Meanwhile, the largish Andrews family comes ashore seeking not-to-be-had succor for a member, en route to a hoped-for new life after the paterfamilias (Andy Jones)lost his situation for pilferage.

These two families strain the meager resources of Station chief Thomas (Colm Meaney) and the one other family there.

This gritty, earthy Canadian-Irish miniseries realistically tackles issues of bondage, extermination of the indigenous Indians, starvation, disease, insanity, God, pregnancy, adultery and you name it as the tiny band moves from total subsistence to a bare semblance of civilization.

The series is well-acted, and well-directed. Not too much stock footage used despite an obviously modest budget. This series is well-worth a watch or two. If you like human drama, detailed 'real people' historic sagas, or the setting, this is recommended.

Comparison: Less odd and artsy than The Shipping News, less idealized and more older-times than The Bird Artist.

The DVD: Boxed set of two discs, each w. two 1.5 hr. parts. Decent audio and picture, few special features of note.

SPECIAL NOTE: This reviewer is 100% ethnic Newfie and NOT a young man. He remembers his own Grandmother Wagg, born within living memory of the times portrayed, telling many similar tales.

Nitpick: Episode Three has an encounter circa 1830 with a Beothuk native; If my memory serves, my own Newfie ancestors had, regrettably, killed them all well before this.",1217289600,34,2094,5.2642642642642645

Also I have had the opportunity to visit the site where it was filmed in NL.  I always said, after being in the Harbour Grace, NL museum that the life of Peter Easton, pirate and the story of Sheila Nageira, said to be an Irish princess, who was kidnapped and brought to the new world.  She is buried in Carboneer, NL.  Leone Fitzgerald",1389312000,2,466,4.0989010989010985

3334142,4,B0012YN2A8,"Truly Canadian but more history of how the people really settled the coast (hiding in the woods when it came time to return to Scotland, Ireland, and England) could have made this more authentic. Still... a good watch!",1368230400,,218,4.7631578947368425
8248235,3,B0012YN2A8,"This looked like exactly the type of movie I enjoy. Historical fiction with my favorite engineer from DS9. It is nicely filmed, but the plot just isn't that engaging. Parts are kind of predictable - everyone has to get paired up, you know who the bad guys are, and who has to die. Other parts seem random and forced to make the plot work. Also there is too much romance and not enough history or character study. It is not something to watch with children, although those seen could have been a lot worse they could have also been omitted to make it family friendly and probably better. There are a few good moments and I will probably watch it again while I'm sewing since I now own the DVD, just wish I had saved my money and watched it on a streaming service first. Not horribly bad, just not horribly good.",1499904000,,810,4.3355263157894735

Had to put it in the trash.  My Grandkids could never come over and put this in to watch thinking they might see something about history..... 10 thumbs down",1474329600,2,329,4.190476190476191

I have fond memories of my time there, but being 8-10 years old I didn't know much about the history of Newfoundland. I recently found out about this TV series and ordered it immediately.
