8132238,5,B000GH3FH2,"Very methodic and thorough teaching style. Covers a variety of topics and has some great tricks and tips for both beginners and advanced players just looking to improve their technique. Everyone could benefit from trying different styles of playing or learning more efficient ways to practice, and I think this covers it pretty well. Great price, and great condition (bought used but unopened).",1367971200,,394,5.26984126984127

8132240,1,B000GH3FH2,After two viewings I put my copy on ebay and sold it. The author does not go into great detail about Moeller and half the dvd is videos of his band playing. Very deceptive advertising. If you want Moeller get JoJo Mayers DVD Secret Weapons for the Modern Drummer. JoJo's DVD is excellent! Learn from someone who knows what he is talking about. All you ever want to know about hand and finger technique is on JoJo's DVD. JoJo's DVD puts  Meoller Method Secrets to shame. The only secret on Moeller Method Secrets is the author doesn't deliver!,1267747200,7,542,4.530612244897959
