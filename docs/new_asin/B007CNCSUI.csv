8514631,5,B007CNCSUI,Son had seen this movie in a catalog from Christian Book Store but they were out so I found it online. Movie in great condition and delivered promptly. Son loves it and it has a great storyline.,1353888000,,194,4.27027027027027
8514632,5,B007CNCSUI,"When I asked my little guy which character he liked best, he said, ""Meteor!  Meteor is the big one that has 6 wheels.  He's blue and he's a monster truck and he loves Jesus!""  Later, he built his version of Meteor with Legos, complete with his super cool 6 wheels.  Right Turn Races includes 6 episodes.  Each episode has a lesson and a bible verse that goes along with it, like the one for Episode 6: 1 John 1:9: ""If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.""

Right Turn Races is a good 75 minutes long.  It's super fun and appropriate for kiddos of all ages. My son loves another series by the same studio so I knew he'd love these.  If you have a son or daughter, or any child in your life, who likes Lightning McQueen and Cars, I highly suggest Monster Truck Adventures.  Even better because, like my little guy said, these trucks ""love Jesus""!",1347321600,3,922,4.313953488372093
