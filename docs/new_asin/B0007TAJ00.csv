8051195,4,B0007TAJ00,Good demonstration of stimulating certain acupoints along the meridian from various angles. The instruction could have been clearer. Most of the learning will come from observing the demonstrations and copying them. They are simple enough to follow. I use the techniques as part of my warm up.,1485388800,,293,5.25531914893617

8051199,5,B0007TAJ00,"Before purchasing this little diamond in the rough my wild geese were running a muck throughout the entire village, what with the burning and pillaging. I had failed them as a master. I hung my head in shame for many days waiting for my last hope for controlling these vile geese.  Finally I took the plunge and the answers were immediately clear. So I rounded up all of these dastardly creatures. As I wrested each beast to the ground and practiced the methods in this film, my geese had their chi balanced in no time. My geese are no longer wild, but rather functioning members of our village society. Thank you for this brilliant piece of handiwork.",1341964800,3,652,4.572649572649572
