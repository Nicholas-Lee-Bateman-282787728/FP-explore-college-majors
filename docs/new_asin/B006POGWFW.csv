5012903,3,B006POGWFW,"Ong Bak was a movie that took the martial arts world by storm. The insane stunts, dynamic camerawork and all around fresh look made this the movie to watch for martial arts fans. Two more movies followed with varying levels of success that never quite equaled the original, but in the end all three were worth the look. Magnolia Home Entertainment collected all three movies and put them together into this single collection. They aren't even in slim cases; the same Blu-Rays that are sold separately are packages in this collection. Other than the fact you can get all three together there isn't anything special about this release. Here is the movie breakdown:

Martial arts movies generally focus more on the fighting choreography than any meaningful or complex storytelling. Ong Bak is no different. The first film was about a monk on a quest to recover the head of a prized statue that was stolen. The plot was just an excuse to have Tony Jaa get involved in impressive fight sequences, insane chase scenes, and all around impressive stunt work. The reason you want to see this movie isn't because you are drawn by the drama of a lone man's away from his element. You are watching it to see Tony's legs on fire (literally) beating up bad guys and slipping through obstacles a cat wouldn't dare.

Ong Bak 2: The Beginning is set in medieval Thailand and is a revenge story where Tony Jaa is a prince avenging the slaughter of his family. The story starts off with him as a child and moves onto his development and training up until he takes on his family's killer. It's another story that is there only to facilitate the martial arts, but this one was a bit more thought into it. This movies feels like it has more fighting only because there are more enemies to fight. The stunts and choreography are still really cool, but didn't give me the same impact as the original movie.

The final film in this trilogy, Ong Bak3, The Final Battle, you have another revenge story. Jaa's family is killed (again), only this time he is taken captive and tortured. Then the story gets weird with lots of metaphysical stuff going on and a lot less butt-kicking. I would like to say this is the more interesting story of the three, but as a martial arts film it has the least of what Tony Jaa fans crave.

The first disk looks pretty dreadful compared to the other two. It's hard to take in that this is the best transfer they could have gotten from the film masters. I know for a fact Ong Bak was shot with 35mm film so I have no idea what the excuse is. I still enjoy watching it, but I am very hard pressed to say it's high definition. The other two looks a lot better, but not exactly perfect. There is a bit of artificial enhancements, but if that's the trade off for a much better picture I can't complain much at all.

Audio for the first movie isn't bad, but doesn't really take advantage of the surround sound environment. The other two movies had a better budget, thus better use of surround in my opinion. The list of special features for each disk isn't half bad. I haven't viewed all of them, but I will give you as much as I can:

Disc 1:

The Movements of Muay Thai  - Short, but extremely sweet exhibition of various Muay Thai moves you see in the film.

French Rap Music Video with Tony Jaa - Rap group Tragedie and Tony Jaa in a music video with clips from the film peppered throughout.

Making of Music Video - No making of feature for the movie, but you get one for the music video (what's up with that?!?!).

Selected B-Roll - Alternate shots from the notable scenes in the film. Actually a cool extra.

Promo Video Featuring The RZA - Kind of a funny commercial where a street fight is interrupted to talk about the movie.

Disc 2:

Alternate Cut - That's right. You get two versions of Ong Bak 2 on this disk. The alternate cut is about longer, but nothing really noteworthy. No additional fights or poignant exposition. Still not bad to get a chance to see the uncut version of the film.

The Story and Characters of an Epic - Basically an analysis of the various characters in the movie. Didn't really learn anything new watching this.

Revealing the Majesty - A look at the coolest action scenes in the movie. Particularly the elephant surfing stunt (you have to see to believe).

The Art of War - The making of focuses on the various martial arts featured on the film.

Capturing a Warrior - Video footage of the fight choreography.

The Kingdom - Production info and comments.

The Community - Behind the scenes with the cast and crew.

Interviews with Cast and Crew - All the major players have interviews in this featurette. One of the longer features in the disc.

HDNet: A Look at Ong Bak 2 - Robert Wilonsky does a promotional segment for HDNET for the movie, and you get to see it here.

Disc 3:

Ong Bak 3: The Making of a Legend - A rather sedate collection of interviews from cast and crew. Not exactly enlightening.

Behind the Scenes: Uncovering the Action - Raw filming of a couple action sequences. Pretty interesting one, but even at about six minutes it starts to feel long.

Interviews with Cast and Crew - Like the previous disk you get interviews from the principal cast and crew.

HDNet: A Look at Ong Bak 3 - Also similar to disc two this is another HDNET promo piece.

If you are looking for a convenient way to get all three Ong Bak movies at a decent price this is the way to go. Considering how much the first movie is going for these days this can become a pretty sweet way to build your collection. If you are looking for a remaster of the original film you may have to wait a bit longer. If you really like Ong Bak you may also want to check out Tom-Yum-Goong (essentially the same story, but different crazy stunts). Ong Bak is an impressive martial arts foray, even if it's a bit flawed.",1405036800,15,5834,4.427102803738317
5012904,1,B006POGWFW,"Ordered this set as a Christmas present for my Son, who studies Kung Fu.  However, didn't realize that it's in Italian, which we don't speak fluently even though we are Italian!!  Tried to return it for a refund (the Vendor is located in Italy); it was Undeliverable and therefore returned back to me 2 months later.  Amazon Customer Service intervened and was able to ensure the refund, plus told me to keep the item. Should my Son choose to brush up on his Italian that he learned in school, maybe he'll give it a shot and watch it; otherwise, he somehow found these Blu-Ray movies in English elsewhere!!",1388707200,2,606,4.592592592592593

5012906,5,B006POGWFW,"These movies are incredible! If you are a fan of Jackie Chan's original works, Bruce Li, Jet li films... then you will love the Ong Bak series.

Tony Jaa is amazing, the first film will probably be your favorite of the three... and the films don't follow a sequential order and seem independent of each other for the typical movie goer.

There are director and producer reviews out there who witnessed Tony Jaa film the first movie, and say he shot the entire street scene on one take. Watch it and youll be amazed. The guy does things no one would think possible.

This collection of three films includes three discs, each in its own standalone plastic Blu-ray case, packaged inside a mostly-black cardboard box. You could discard the box if you wished, and the remaining cases would fit right in with the rest of your Blu-ray collection. Each disc has all the special features of the individual releases. Ong-Bak 2 and Ong-Bak 3 are labelled as Collector's Editions. Only the first film comes in one of those flimsier, eco-friendly cases with large portions of plastic cut out.

5012922,5,B006POGWFW,"A classic stylized Martial Arts trilogy from Tony Jaa, I personally believe to be his master piece in a epic sense of highly skilled Marital Arts. Although I do believe Ong Bak 2 & 3 was the best in complexity of Martial Arts from Tony Jaa. There's no doubt that this trilogy is some of Tony Jaa's best work, though the Protector 1 & 2 are very good as well. My favorite in this trilogy is Ong Bak 2, perhaps because its so earthly primitive in raw skilled talents of the Arts and many adrenaline epic fight scenes within Ong Bak 2.",1455148800,6,532,4.2254901960784315

film is my favorite. the first film is about Tony going to Bangkok looking for the head of his statue named ong bak. the other 2 films are prequels
about tony battling an arch rival.

5012952,4,B006POGWFW,"The Ong Bak Trilogy is a compilation of the three tales comprising the story of Thai warrior Tien (Tony Jaa), a religious young man who swears an oath of peace. In Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior, a gangster steals the head of Ong-Bak, the deity of Tiens village, and Tien heads for Bangkok to get it back. Action abounds, with Jaa performing his own incredible stunts.

The second film is a prequel set hundreds of years in the past, showcasing ever more mesmerizing action stunts from Jaa. Seven elaborately choreographed set pieces deliver some terrific martial arts action.

Ong-Bak 3 is the most brutal of the films. Tien is captured and almost beaten to death before he is saved and brought back to his village. There, he is taught meditation and how to deal with his Karma, but soon his arch rival, a fierce supernatural warrior named Demon Crow, returns to challenge Tien for a final duel.

Tony Jaa will remind you of Bruce Lee. His moves are sleek, panther-like, and clean, and he is smoothly elegant even in fast-paced action sequences. Taken together, the three Ong-Bak movies have an epic feel.",1407715200,11,1101,4.7539267015706805
5012953,1,B006POGWFW,not good,1407542400,,8,3.5
5012954,5,B006POGWFW,"When it comes to martial arts movies, I want to be blown away by the fight scenes, but there needs to be a story in there as well.  If there are tons of fight sequences just for the sake of fighting, my interest wanes.  Fortunately, the Ong Bak trilogy has plenty of fighting and drama both.  The fine folks at Magnet Releasing saw fit to group all three films together and issue them on Blu-ray in a special package.  The result is an excellent collection that will be a welcome addition to any film-lovers library.

I had never seen any of the ONG BAK films prior to receiving this trilogy, so it was a real treat to be able to sit down and watch them in a single marathon.  And seeing them in HD makes the action much more engaging; I love to see every jaw-dropping stunt and bone-crushing kick in crystal-clear clarity.

Each film is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The production values look high, although the sets are, for the most part, very low-key.  This is not a negative at all; on the contrary, its nice to see action films taking place outside of big-city venues.

The acting in each ONG BAK film is pretty good overall as well.  Actor/director Tony Jaa is an amazing talent, and I hope to see much more of his work in the future; he is one of the few action stars that can actually act, so seeing him onscreen is always enjoyable, even when he is not breaking limbs and cracking skulls.

If I were forced to pick a favorite out of The Ong Bak Trilogy, I would have to say the first one is the one that jumps out at me.  While the action is excellent in all three films, the first ONG BAK feels like it has more heart and more drama to it.  I will definitely go back and revisit it again.

The Ong Bak Trilogy is a big win for me, and I highly recommend giving it a shot.  Even if you don't want to buy all three films at once, at least check out the first one; if you do, chances are youll be eager to snatch the Blu-ray trilogy up afterwards.  This set is available now.",1406764800,16,1991,4.183727034120735
