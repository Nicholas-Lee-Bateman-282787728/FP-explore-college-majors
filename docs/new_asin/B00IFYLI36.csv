8641899,5,B00IFYLI36,"Wonderful movie that has become our family's new Christmas classic. Warm, touching series of interwoven stories, wonderfully shot to bring about a series of emotions. We'd been looking for this movie for years after hearing about it, and glad we finally found a copy.

The version we received wasn't Region Free (was Region 2, Europe) which is an inconvenience, so you will want to confirm you are ordering a Region Free version if you're outside Europe.",1518220800,,454,4.973684210526316
