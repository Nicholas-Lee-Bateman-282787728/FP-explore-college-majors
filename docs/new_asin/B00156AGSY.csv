8257621,3,B00156AGSY,"Good presentation of the story of the CIA,FBI,etc.,documents which have been declassified & those that are STILL being withheld. Author John Newman's bit on the available papers is very good. Clear evidence that the cover-up is still on-going. Viewers should read Mr. Newman's OSWALD &THE CIA(1995). Excellent book,available at Amazon.com.",1430179200,,339,5.8

8257623,3,B00156AGSY,"Here is a quality DVD taken from The History Channel, detailing many new discoveries by official research groups which gained access to files thought to be missing.

Included in the findings are the handwritten notes of an Oswald interview conducted under pressure by an FBI agent, at Dallas police Headquarters.

Another interesting piece is the revelation that a Kennedy friend/associate filmed the parade route from the second car and (possibly) captured the fatal shot!

We have the discovery of the Clay Shaw trial transcript, which includes that of Marina Oswald.

Problem is, for those who want conclusive answers, the above artifacts are not examined at all; and the point of view of this Production is decidedly pro-Warren Commission, with the lone dissenter saying that someday we *will* know. There's a ""debunking"" of a photograph at Dealey Plaza, shortly after the shots, which show a pedestrian only *resembling* Jack Ruby - we are then told that this is strong proof that there's no Oswald-Ruby connection. We also have a Garrison staffer who calls the Prosecutor ""crazy"".

We are left with some substantial food for thought, though not much for the more informed researcher.

[Note: This DVD makes a nice companion for ""Oswald And The CIA"", by John Newman""].",1297900800,3,1273,5.125603864734299
