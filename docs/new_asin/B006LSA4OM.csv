5003699,3,B006LSA4OM,"The video of this is very good. I gave it a three because it is very hard to read the sub-titles. They are in white with a very light background. It makes it very difficult to read, and follow the stories. It the sub-titles weren't a problem I would have given it a five.",1337904000,25,271,4.037037037037037
5003700,4,B006LSA4OM,"Great DVD. Very informative for anyone planning on walking the Camino de Santiago. It gives true accounts from pilgrims who recently completely wheir quest. You have to watch it a few times as its in subtitiles throughout due to language barriers. Check your local library 1st or maybe rent it if possible. Either way I have no complaints about the video or the purchase as I am extremely interested in making my Pilgrimage. This will give you most of the facts on the history, background, and determination needed to complete this journey. Bein Camino...",1336780800,35,555,4.914893617021277
5003701,4,B006LSA4OM,This a a good documentary. It does a nice job of giving you a feel for what the Camino is all about. I watched this after watching The Way staring Martin Sheen. It is much different but still good.  I love the Camino. And this DVD helped me relive some my experinces while on this pilgrimage.,1332028800,44,292,4.214285714285714
5003702,5,B006LSA4OM,"This is the first film I saw about the camino, and it's still my favorite. It accurately depicts the pilgrims you can find along the Way of St James. I especially appreciate the historical background provided by camino scholars. Having been to the cathedral I'm happy every time I see it portrayed in this film.",1421280000,,311,4.672727272727273

5003706,3,B006LSA4OM,"The film was a good travelogue of the Camino. I had walked the Camino in 2008 and the comments of the pilgrims were authentic and as I had found it. It is a good historical review and the Spanish and Italian experts commenting on the Way of Santiago were excellent. The English speaking narrator's pronunciation was painful to listen to, however.  Nevertheless, worth having.  Additionally, a frustrating issue was that I could not ""fast forward"" through the DVD--some sort of technical glitch.",1412553600,,494,5.012195121951219
5003707,3,B006LSA4OM,"I too was disappointed. I got some good information about the history and travels of Saint James and the route in general, and a bit about what a pilgrimage would be like, but found I was less interested in going on the Way of Saint James after watching this DVD. I had driven to Santiago de Compostela about 10 years ago.  My biggest disappointment was the add on topics that had no relevance to the Way of Saint James. More comments on the false De Vinci movie and especially where the commenter matter of fact comment about pilgrims worshiping Saint James. No wonder non-catholics are confused. I missed that at my visit to the grave of Saint James. Many of us admire him and ask him to intervene for us to God and Christ since he is obviously in heaven. But worship. Also some other things that practicing catholics might find offensive. I was surprise that Ignatius Press put this out. It's very secular, and not even a good secular at that.

5003710,5,B006LSA4OM,"I found this video very informative and inspiring.  It also gave a good overview of what to expect along the Camino.  There were absolutely no issues with reading the subtitles (despite what I had read on some other reviews) and interviews with pilgrims from different parts of the world kept it interesting.

If you are doing research on the Camino, I think this is a worthwhile resource to include.",1394928000,,400,4.768115942028985

Started watching this on my Blue-Ray but found I could not reverse or speed forward. It just stops the movie. I notice that many commented how difficult it was to read the white-letter captions when foreign [ non-English ] words were being spoken but I did not find this to be a problem at all. It would have been nice to have closed captions for the English as well because of the pronunciation of the Spanish words.

The main problem I had was the issue of having to watch the entire movie without being able to reverse or speed forward.

I  will try it on my DVD player [ when I have access to it ] to see if the functions work better on a different device. This is the only reason it did not get five [5] stars. Otherwise.....

Way to go Amazing-zon!!!

5003712,5,B006LSA4OM,"The Way of St. James combines thorough historical background of the Camino de Santiago and the experiences of a cross-section of actual Peregrinos (pilgrims).  Having walked the Camino last summer w/my husband and Granddaughter summer, 2013, I appreciated the combination of the history, spirituality and candid interviews.",1392336000,,323,5.872340425531915
5003713,5,B006LSA4OM,I enjoyed the content of this book. There are details not found in other books about the pilgrimage to Santiago.,1385337600,,112,4.65
5003714,2,B006LSA4OM,"would be much better without the continual interjection of comments by a group of pilgrims.  A couple of times would be ok, but was overdone and that cuts into the detail of outlining the pilgrimage itself",1382745600,4,205,4.694444444444445

5003717,3,B006LSA4OM,"The information is good, and provides a more realistic view of what it takes to prepare for the pilgrimage as compared with the movie, The Way.  I found the English subtitles to be somewhat distracting, especially when the subtitles were faded and appeared over a light background.  It distracted from the documentary.  Nonetheless, I found it to be very informative and inspiring.",1375833600,,381,5.112903225806452
5003718,5,B006LSA4OM,"The film was outstanding. I purchased it because I've planned a trip to Spain for next year. Before I travel I love to read and research as much material as I can to make the trips come to life. This film did a very good job explaining the history and perspectives of individuals who traveled ""the way.""",1375574400,,303,4.333333333333333

5003720,5,B006LSA4OM,"I'm grateful to be able to order and own a great historic and true story - The Way of St. James - also known as the Camino in Spain.  Upon watching this beautiful movie I felt like I was on the walk.  I believe this will be the closest and only way I'll be able to be a part of the 500 miles walk with Jesus.  More movies of this type need to be made, readily available to purchase AND, of course, viewed.  Again, THANK YOU AMAZON - for making ""things happen.""",1367366400,2,460,3.967391304347826

5003723,5,B006LSA4OM,"This DVD is a very handy reference for anyone wanting to walk the Camino or indeed anyone just interested in learning about it. The very In depth historic information, provided by a range of experts, is well supported by recollections of pilgrims who completed the Way. These people were of all ages and backgrounds and had different motivations for walking the Camino. I plan to do the Camino in 2014 and this type of reference just supports and reinforces the desire to do it. Highly recommended.",1359244800,8,498,4.8023255813953485
5003724,3,B006LSA4OM,"This video gives the viewer snapshots of the Camino and walkers' experiences. While mentioning other road its focus is on the French Way. I recommend it for the general and overall impressions it provides. Meseta and woodland views are shown along with rivers, valleys and mountains. Brief glances of pilgrim accommodations are provided. Two experts are extensively interviewed along with two volunteers. Some of the pilgrim interviews are very moving. The Knights Templar are briefly mentioned. The two drawbacks I see are not mentioning sanitation challenges and spending any minutes at all on  two topics with NO connection to the Camino---a novel entitled ""The Divinci Code"" and a French site that is a circus ""chateau"" whose promoter priest invoked the name of Mary Magdalene.",1357084800,10,781,5.298387096774194
5003725,3,B006LSA4OM,"This was good. It has a lot of interviews in other languages. I mean a whole lot of the DVD is composed of interviews. And the English subtitles are sometimes difficult to read.

5003729,3,B006LSA4OM,"Looked forward to watching this as the Way of St. James fascinates me.  Some inspirational moments but the downside is the subtitles.  What idiot puts white subtitles on a white background?  Impossible to read and that always drives me crazy.  So many people speaking in Spanish throughout with subtitles and if one cannot read what is being said, well it is a washout.  Scenery is gorgeous and the people seem to be spiritually changed by the trip.  Whoever put in the subtitles ruined this altogether.",1342224000,24,503,4.858823529411764
5003730,1,B006LSA4OM,"I watched the move ""The Way"" with Martin Sheen. Expected this DVD to have more in depth interviews with people doing the pilgramage. Also, thought they would show what it was like on the pilmagrage. Instead, it was a boring historical dvd with a handful of short interviews.",1338595200,13,274,4.729166666666667
5003731,1,B006LSA4OM,"I brought this DVD after watching the wonderful film ""The Way"" starring Martin Sheen. I was hoping that it would share the day to day experiences of real modern day pilgrims as they actually walked the Camino along with pertinent historical and cultural side-notes (a non-fictional version of ""The Way"" if you will).

I was disappointed (to put it mildly). What you get is a lightweight and rather boring historical travelogue that spends most of the time cataloguing the churches and monasteries along the way interspersed the occasional long-shot of walkers plus some staged superficial interviews with half a dozen or so people that had completed the journey.

I don't often do reviews, preferring to let people make their own minds up, but I brought this DVD based on reviews and don't want others to make the same mistake that I did.",1337904000,112,838,4.894366197183099

8500513,3,B006LSA4OM,"This film has some nice shots of the beautiful scenery one can find on the Camino and does have some interesting commentary about the pilgrimage. One point that I wanted to address, however, was when it seemed to say that St. James was worshiped. As a Catholic, I have to just point out that any Catholic who actually understands their faith would know that St. James is not a god to be worshiped. He is a saint who lived an exemplary life and is to be honored. God alone is to be worshiped. I wasn't sure why the film used that phrasing for the honor that the pilgrims showed St. James.
