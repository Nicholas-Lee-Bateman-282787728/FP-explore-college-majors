This one has a great cast that includes Cameron Mitchell, Diane Ladd, Bruce Dern, Jack Nicholson and Harry Dean Stanton.
It's pretty much the typical biker movie, but above average cast set it above many of the other biker films of the time.
The Rhino DVD is standard academy ratio fullscreen (1.33:1), mostly likely they way it was shot, considering it's a very low budget film.
The PQ and AQ is pretty darn good.

Overall I really enjoyed ""Rebel Rousers""",1320364800,,729,5.942857142857143

Bruce Dern, Jack Nicholson, Cameron Mitchell and Diane Ladd, and this is the best they can come up with. Mitchell's pathetic attempt at getting help from the people of a one dog town instead of smacking the crap out of the wimp deputy and taking is gun is sickening enough, but this is the lamest excuse for a bike gang I've ever seen. Never thought I'd see a movie that made Cycle Savages look good, but this is it. The one thing this movie has is a couple of real nice looking bikes (which is what I watch motorcycle movies for), the customized Triumph that Dern rides an the high exhuast piped model Jack Nicholson is on are the only semi-redeeming things in this movie.",1115856000,,839,4.283018867924528
