Or what about feeling so euphoria when your team has just clinched the division, advanced into and through the playoffs, and/or won the big game?  Or what about why the heck did they do that crazy thing?

If so, it's your turn to see the other side of things. Take an hour to see this film.

To sum it up in a nutshell, NFL Turf Talk takes you onto the field and shows you the most heated moments, the most ridiculous moments, and the most craziest moments of the NFL film.

Now while this film is Not Rated, according to one player it's rated R containing Adult Language and Violence but in an appropriate manner. You might here some mild language, but for the most part you'll be hearing all kinds of BLEEPS.  No blood and gore, but you'll see tons of smashing and players limping off the field and talking/describing about painful injuries.

The film is broken down into several segments.

There's a pregame segment which shows how players psych themselves up for game day, because as one player says, ""Every Sunday you got to get ready to go to war.""

There's another segment that shows some very heated moments on the field with players shouting obscenities, punking other players out, and even making threats.

There's a segment that shows the stress NFL coaches go through.

There's one segment where players explain why they do those ascenine hot dog stunts and we see some players doing crazy things.

There's another segment showing how crazy NFL fans can be, a couple of which even show female fans acting all crazy.

There's a segment where retired NFL players share their greatest moments.

There's a segment featuring the best radio broadcast-ed moments.

The final segment shows the top 10 greatest NFL soundbites.

If you are a fan of NFL football and especially love and live for NFL, do not hesitate to pick up this gem and watch it. I think I was lucky enough to get this for FREE in the mail.

I really don't want to explain exactly what happens in this film, as it would spoil it for you.",1364083200,,2130,4.536649214659686
7849874,3,630352446X,"There's little to say about this routine action-thriller. A Federal Agent, Steve Woods (Tony Tunnelers), expert in martial arts, takes a personal  vendetta against the killers of his childhood friend, Phil (Allen  Williams). As usual, the bad guys are the men from the Middle East who  challenge the U.S. with terrorist acts. This simplicity, however, makes  this film watchable nowadays, when violence seems to count more than good  scripts. Tony Tunnellers, as the main character, does fine his job, a fair  performance expected from a champion karate turned into movie actor. Adding  the good soundtrack by Sean Murray and you have a perfect and light  matine.",966211200,4,663,5.188679245283019
