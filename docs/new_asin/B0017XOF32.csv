3176143,1,B0017XOF32,"You might think that these videos will have lots of great footage of trains, planes, trucks, etc. They don't. This stupid All About series often has the camera frozen in place while adults carry on highly boring conversations about information. Not instructive or enlightening, just information. Most of it will not be relevant to children under 9. There is no wonder or awe in watching these vehicles. Just talk, talk, talk. What a disappointment.",1262304000,8,448,5.0675675675675675
3176144,5,B0017XOF32,"This was the best DVD I ever got for my two sons, 3 and 2 Yr. old. Fire truck, Trucks, Air Planes, and last but not least Trains. All on one disk and  a great deal of fun in each episode. Each show has a fun set of character and is informative on the in's and out's of it's item. I would recommend this item to any one with children who loves these items!",1252886400,3,355,3.7972972972972974
3176145,5,B0017XOF32,my grandson loves this dvd he is 4 years old and watches it over and over.,1241136000,5,74,3.6875
3176146,4,B0017XOF32,"All 4 movies are about 30 min.  My boys like each one, but the fire truck is the favorite.  They are all very kid friendly and not only show lots of different vehicles, but explain how they work, what they do and other interesting facts.",1233014400,10,237,4.2444444444444445
3176159,5,B0017XOF32,I couldn't find a dvd of planes and trucks all in one. my son abs love it thank you will be ordering more,1361491200,,105,3.608695652173913
3176160,5,B0017XOF32,"The kids like BackPack Jack.
A good way for kids to learn about things.
It makes a good kid gift.",1359504000,,97,3.9
3176161,5,B0017XOF32,My five-year-old son loved this DVD for Christmas! It's a nice break from the usual cartoons he watches. I recommend it.,1358380800,,120,4.761904761904762
3176162,5,B0017XOF32,"Our three year old grandson loves this video.  His favorites are the train, truck and plane.  This is his choice every time he visits.  He has learned so much.",1358294400,,159,4.413793103448276
3176163,2,B0017XOF32,This is not made for little ones.  There is too much talking and too little actual machines for the kids to look at.,1347321600,,116,4.043478260869565
3176164,5,B0017XOF32,"I decided I should leave a review for this DVD because I think other parents may appreciate this one. My son is now 5 and has been watching this since he was 3. It is the only DVD that he watches over and over again and I put him to sleep with it on every night. He loves it. I often wonder if he dreams about what he sees in these All about movies! Like the other person said, some acting is cheesy and the clothes are dated but it's completely bearable and not one of those irritating high energy cartoons kids often watch. I try not to let mine watch those. This series has a relaxed feel to it while managing to teach the kids all about _________. :)He particularly likes all the ones on this CD but sometimes requests the one with Helicopters & Airplanes instead. He likes the Helicopters one also. For the person who said Hard Hat Harry seems like a child molester...that I don't see whatsoever. That comment was just plain ignorant. No basis for such a comment.",1332201600,2,968,4.295081967213115
3176165,5,B0017XOF32,"To the adult, this video is BORING - but to my 2 year old - this video is the most requested DVD to watch.  My son loves to watch the fireman one - I think it's the speaker's calm voice mixed with the images of the firefighters working on the vehicles.  These videos were made in the 90s (you can tell by the hairstyles and clothing), but to a kid, they have no clue that those things are out of date.",1300492800,,401,3.9382716049382718
3176166,4,B0017XOF32,"Out two boys (ages 3 and 2) can't get enough of these movies.  They aren't the most well-made movies, but they still hold their attention.  The Backpack Jack-hosted episodes are much better made than the other ones, but as far as the kids are concerned, they're happy with all of them.",1292371200,,285,4.568627450980392
3176167,5,B0017XOF32,"I never write reviews- but I am shopping for another ""All About"" DVD since we own the 5 episode collection. My son LOVES all 5 of them! It is definitely dated, and early 90's clothes- but the shots of the trucks, trains, etc is great. They actually discuss in depth flying,  the difference between steam engines, etc. It is pretty educational- and very family friendly. I bought this at Target on a whim- thinking for $5 it was worth it for over 2 hours of video. IT was the best DVD I have bought- my son will always choose an episode from this DVD over any other show he is allowed to watch. If your son loves trucks, trains, planes, etc this is seriously the best deal around- and your son will totally love it.",1278892800,,714,4.288888888888889
3176168,5,B0017XOF32,I have a 2 year old that once saw this DVD and had been asking for it for six months now. I finally found it and he just loves that Airplanes especially.  The product came in great conditions and timely.  Its a great substitute to your every day cartoons for them!,1265414400,7,264,4.1568627450980395

8267749,5,B0017XOF32,"This DVD was also a birthday gift for 3 year old grandson.  He is totally fascinated and repeats the descriptive phrases verbatim.  I can put lunch together and know for a fact that he is completely absorbed in watching the dvd.  Better yet, he remembers a wealth of information from the dvd and can recite an amazing amount of facts.",1373328000,,334,4.533333333333333
