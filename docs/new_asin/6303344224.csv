626809,4,6303344224,"Though this film isn't as good as the first two KARATE KID movies, it is just as good if not better than KARATE KID III. In this film, Mr. Miyagi takes a trip out East to receive a special commendation from the President for his unit's extraordinay achievements during WWII. He stays over at the home of the widow of his former best friend. The woman is having a difficult time raising her granddaughter, Julie, who was orphaned after her parents were killed in a car accident. Mr. Miyagi suggests she take a trip to California and stay at his place on a vacation while he stays and takes care of her home and her granddaughter. Other than being fiercely angry at life, Julie is also having problems at school and is being harassed by the school's administratively supported bullies, the Alph Elite. Through the tutoring of Mr. Miyagi, Julie is able to control her anger and find focus in her life.
Hillary Swank pulls off a believable and emotionally-deep performance as Julie Pierce. The role needn't required so much depth, but her character reminds one of the girl next door.
However, as good as Swank is, the real reason to see this film is Pat Morita. It's great to see Mr. Miyagi again. His character reminds me of a real life Yoda. As long as the story is decent, one can't get enough of a great character like him. There are also some great quotes in the movie. My personal favorite is ""Never trust a spiritual leader who can't dance."" A fun movie that is surprisingly enjoyable.",1017187200,13,1488,4.5559701492537314
626810,5,6303344224,"Some waited on line for the 4th installment of that ""other"" series (Star Wars), but when this film came out, me and my comrades were online at the theatre for days and we were not disappointed when we finally got in to see the premiere, what with our Miyagi Dojo tatoos blazzoned on our chests.  WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED.  This is the best in the epic Karate Kid series and that is saying a lot.  This one becomes the best because there is an underlying message not evidenced in the first.  Oscar-winner Hilary Swank turns in her best performance as the orphaned student who high-kicks her way into the heart of the viewer.  Some said Noriyuki ""Pat"" Morita was typecast, but he is not playing a role anymore.  He has BECOME Miyagi.  What Morita has said with his stunning role in this dramatic masterpiece is, Miyagi cannot rest until the Kobra Kai has been fully eliminated from the world through use of Miyagi's Christ-like diplomatic karate approach.  Miyagi is a messiah for our time... and for Hollywood in general.  The fact that there is no longer a mental distinction between Morita and Miyagi is evidence enough for the world.  We will not be bullied into the John Creese mentallity and we will follow Miyagi (the greatest martial arts character since Bruce Lee's work) wherever he may lead us.  Fans take heart, as we have proven with this film, the karate kid series will not be stopped by the mere fact that the title character has moved on to other things.  In today's society we need a karate kid...  a next karate kid!",1003104000,7,1533,4.591911764705882
626811,3,6303344224,"THE NEXT KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent martial-arts flick. I thought that Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) looked good in their prom attire. Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real BULLY in my opinion. This was because he got Julie in trouble with Principal Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was a pure A******! This was because he was a VERY harsh man who wouldn't tolerate mistakes. My favorite parts were the prom and the showdown between Julie and the Alpha Elite. In conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend this smash hit to all of you who like martial-arts flicks or are fans of Hilary Swank.",994809600,3,646,4.725663716814159
626812,5,6303344224,"This was one of the best movies I have seen! Though not as good as the original, it does carry on the meaning of ""The Karate Kid"". This movie has a new modern twist to it! I think everyone will enjoy this movie.",954806400,6,211,3.9302325581395348
626813,2,6303344224,I think that it a boring so so movie no wonder this movie is barley reconised but I just saw it because I really like Hillary Swank and her peformince in boys don't cry got grate reviews so I figured I would see this  first before I waist my money in the theter sinse that is more money. And  know I really want to see that movie because her perfomince is grate.,954547200,4,362,4.013888888888889
626814,3,6303344224,"There, I've said it.  This one is the best, and the last, sequel.  Considering its competition, though, that's not saying a whole lot. In fact, I wasn't planning on seeing this one, but my sister was watching it  on Disney Channel, so I just sat down with her.
Pat Morita is great as  usual as Mr. Miyagi, but the whole monk thing was kind of disturbingly  stupid, as was that Colonal Dugan club thing.  The fight sequences were not  very well choreographed, and the music was basically lifted directly from  the first film.
This is, however, a refreshing movie.  Hilary Swank is  very good as the ""Next Karate Kid,"" an angry orphaned teenager  who Mr. Miyagi takes under his wing. She is a convincing actress, and  conveyed her emotions pretty well. The movie is worth watching for her  alone.  Unfortunately, most of the other acting falls on its face.
The  first half of the film plays off very well against the first karate kid,  and it doesn't bore us with same old, same old in terms of karate  instruction (most of the time). It skips over wax the car, etc... in just a  few minutes. However, there still isn't that much thats new.  Mr. Miyagi is  still a veritable fountain of sayings and aphorisms, the kid excels against  unbeatable odds against schoolkids, etc...
Still, an enjoyable movie.",948499200,23,1301,4.643171806167401

627171,3,6303344224,"Now enters the new Karate Kid in a female persona for The Next Karate Kid,also known as The Karate Kid Part IV. After a disastrous Karate Kid Part III,the producers have extended the series to Part IV this time with a new female lead. The Next Karate Kid is the fourth and final film in the original The Karate Kid series. It stars Hilary Swank and Pat Morita.

The story of the film picks up with janitor/martial arts maven Miyagi Yakuga. This time, his pupil is orphaned 17-year-old Julie, the granddaughter of Miyagi's war buddy. Relentlessly bullied by her male classmates and feeling responsible for her parents' fatal accident, Miyagi takes this time to take Julie to a Buddhist monastery in order to teach her the true ways of karate. In here,she learns, through direct lessons, balance, co-ordination, awareness, and respect for all life self-worth. The film ends as we know how when Julie finally takes revenge on the male classmates who used to bully her.

The film follows the same formula of the first three sequels using a new protg. So there are no surprises in it. It was too long and very predictable. Also,it offers little excitement, even in its culminating fight sequence. The only good thing about this film was the performance of future Academy Award winner,Hilary Swank who made a breakout performance in it. And most of all,it was a little better than the second sequel as this film did not receive any Razzies nomination unlike the latter which got 5.

In summary,in spite of the fact that the series tries to infuse a new blood with a new lead,the Karate Kid series has already lost steam and this time,it is evident to put a close into it.",1415836800,,1665,4.695205479452055

627236,5,6303344224,"Supposedly, when Hillary Swank was about six years old -- I would have been much older, say about 17 -- she moved into a trailer park in Bellingham, WA, a nice little city that I've visited many times, back when I lived in the Seattle area.  No, I've never met her, not even back then.

There are a lot of people who talk about ""trailer trash"" this, and ""trailer trash"" that, but I don't believe that I would put Ms. Swank into either of those categories.  After all, one man's treasure is another man's trash -- and vice versa -- and based upon my review score here, you can guess which one fits the bill for me.

Now, while I'm giving this film a 5, I'm not giving it a 5 based upon writing or direction.  Perhaps not even upon acting, although when Ms. Swank is in a film, she's always up for an Academy Award.  And while I believe that this is her first film, she still gave it the old college try, and that college try was enough.  I've seen better acting that wasn't nearly as, umm, interesting.

Let's just say the following:  this film could have doubled as a commercial for blue jeans.  Blue jeans that fit.  And fit WELL.  You may try to watch this film, following plot elements and even theme -- if there was a theme -- but that of course would be missing the point.  Instead, if you watch this film, you will be following Ms. Swank's jeans.

Well, I say, ""Rockin'!""  I think that there are some scenes where she saves some birds, perhaps a hawk or eagle?  Who cares.  And I think that there are some scenes where Miagi-san tries to teach her, ""Karate for defense, not offence!""  Once again, who cares.  All of these plot elements in the film are a showcase for one Hillary Swank.  And her many assets.

I just watched an old YouTube video of Siskel and Ebert, where they were reviewing ""Cat Woman"" with Halle Barry.  Mr. Ebert, with whom I am a big fan -- I was actually quite sad when he passed away last year -- hated that film, but he did opine something like, ""There are three things that I liked about this film:  Halle Barry's face, Halle Barry's body, and Halle Barry's costume.""  Indeed.  Stinker of a film, but hey, Halle Barry is in it so, sometimes, you've got to look at the film as being half full, not half empty.

And this film falls into the half-full category, at least.  As long as Ms. Swank is in it, I'll go five stars.  And the film doesn't have to be any good.  As a matter of fact, it may be pretty bad, which it is.  But who cares?  I'm still going 5 stars today on a bad film with a lot of Schwank.",1406332800,,2535,4.207900207900208

Most people prefer the first Karate Kid (1984) because it's the main one and where the story begins, but after the third movie Daniel goes his separate way and Miyagi goes to Boston for a military reunion.

Good coming of age film when a seventeen year old violent teenager after the death of her parents and grandfather isolating herself from everyone including her grandmother, caring for a bird name Angel after it broke it's wing and Miyagi  and Julie's friend Eric helped turned her around and made her into a better person that she already is.",1403654400,,629,4.657657657657658

And while my girls are complete opposites, (the oldest dedicated to her Tae Kwon do and science books, and the youngest to animals, pretty stuff, and the anything pink,) both equally loved it!
A nice story about a teenage girl learning to deal with her inner anger at losing her parents, well, and -basically growing up. (And wow, Hillary Duff before she got so big and famous...) And even though it's not a new movie, I don't think it's quite as well, dated, to be honest, as the original classic Karate kid either.

627384,3,6303344224,"Well, after the dismal Karate Kid III, we're treated to a refreshing change- a karate apprentice of a different gender. Hilary Swank and Pat Morita seem to have good chemistry in their roles. However, there's a downside. In typical Karate Kid fashion, there are over the top thugs who aren't believable. It's more of the same bullying that has become a Karate Kid staple. This movie isn't bad; in fact, Hilary Swank is interesting in her role, and keeps the viewer's interest, but not before we're treated to a barrage of nonsense behavior by some high school bullies and their coach who rattles off one stupid line after another. In the end, it's Miyagi who sort of steals Swank's thunder. His fighting and comments are entertaining enough to salvage what could've been a much better film.

WAX ON (the ""half full"" review):

1). Hillary Swank is attractive and engaging as Julie, the tomboy with anger management issues.
2). Pat Morita. I'm sure he knew this was less than a 5 star flick when he signed up for it, but he deserved one final Miyagi-sized payday. No harm, no foul on his part.
3). I gave this one 5 stars for having the courage to break from the formula.

WAX OFF (the ""half empty"" review):

1). The ice melts a little too quickly on Hillary Swank's character for it to b believable, especially in the romance department.
2). Michael Ironside. Neil Young made the one-note solo entertaining in ""Cinnamon Girl."" Ironside is basically playing the same role here as the one he played in ""Total Recall"" and probably every other movie he's been in. He just chews the scenery and isn't the least believable or entertaining while doing so.
3). The fight scenes. Thoroughly inept, stunt doubles punching and kicking empty air. Just awful.

It's become the norm in Mr. Miyagi's life that he has to deal with people who are employed in leadership roles, and who really just abuse their titles and actually be seen as remotely corrupted, badly influential teachers of the weaker (and I guess) lesser intelligent teenagers who are looking for a positive sense of direction in their lives.

Alot of Mr. Miyagi's best comments are presented here in this film.  It's not so much that he would have been a great father to a daughter, but he does live a life as that to respect all living things and to respect all God's creatures, including yourself.

This is one of Hilary Swank's first films and she rules the screen immediately and commands presence throughout the film.  She's one of those actresses that I don't look at her for her beauty, but I respect her commanding aura of a prominent actress.  She is really good as a young female projecting all the struggles that could be in a young girl's mind, of a daughter who lost her parents.

I thought Hilary Swank was great in ""Freedom Writers"" as a tough teacher in a tough school environment, but this film shows her tough side too.  I can't wait for the Blu-ray of this film.

627502,4,6303344224,"MILD SPOILERS

Hilary Swank gives us an intense, goodhearted early performance as Julie, ""THE NEXT KARATE KID"" in THE KARATE KID series of films. Noriyuki ""Pat"" Morita reprises Mr. Miyagi, the wise elder who teaches ""Julie-san"" karate, both as a way of bolstering the orphaned teenager's self-esteem and as a way of defending herself against a bunch of punks under the sway of their obnoxious coach, played by Michael Ironside.

The violence in THE NEXT KARATE KID is very toned down and a lot less plausible than in the original film. Even the most abusive man on earth would hardly take it upon himself to teach a gang of boys to target one specific girl, and if he did, he'd end up under arrest in a prison psych ward, especially if he was a High School Coach. As a result, Ironside and his minions are barely believable. The climactic battle between Julie and the punks had me smiling, as these implacable terrorizers had their collective @$$es kicked by a chick in what ended up being a two minute fight sequence.

However, THE NEXT KARATE KID has some wonderful and not-to-be-missed scenes inside a Zen Buddhist monastery, where Miyagi teaches Julie the art of Empty Hand Combat even while imbuing her with the spiritual fibre she will need in order not to fight.

The monks are wise and good natured, even when Julie kills a cockroach:

Miyagi (sternly): Monks no kill cockroach, have have respect for all life.
Julie:  It's a roach. It's gross. And hey, I've seen you kill bugs.
Miyagi: Miyagi not monk in monastery. But still have respect for all life!

Later . . .

Miyagi: Monks have surprise for you!
Julie (panicking):  Okay, I admit I killed a spider in my room! But it was an accident, and I buried it, and I even said a little prayer over the grave!
Monks:  Happy Birthday To You...Happy Birthday To You...Happy Birthday dear Julie-san...Happy Birthday to you!

There is a humorous sequence inside a bowling alley, where the inexperienced but perfectly centered monks play perfect game after perfect game against a bowling league. It's all very memorable and the seemingly magical ability of the monks to turn gutter balls into strikes will have you laughing out loud. True Zen practice, however, has no magical side effects.

Miyagi is referred to as ""Sensei"" (""Teacher"") by the monks, a term of ultimate respect in the Zen community. The film never addresses whether Miyagi was ever a Zen monk, but it's possible. He is wise and kindly (and showing his age); his gentleness with Julie creates the same filial dynamic which Miyagi and Daniel shared in the original.

This is THE NEXT KARATE KID, and nowhere as good as the first, but it certainly has a quality all its own.",1288915200,,2690,4.722222222222222

In real life the conflict should've been avoidable by going to the police.  Internal affairs would have to take such claims seriously.  I guess Hollywood needed a final confrontation though so that's forgiveable.  I loved the journey until that mess at the end.

What do all these movies have in common with The Next Karate Kid?  They're all sequels that should have never been made.  The first indication that this movie was a bad idea is that Macchio passed on it.

Hilary Swank plays Julie-san, a girl bullied in her high school.  She's got anger issues, family issues, and the team of tough-guy jocks called the Alpha Elite does not help the situation at all.  Despite the unlikely scenario of a high school boy's club that practices martial arts and enforces discipline/rules throughout the school, the odds of them picking on a single girl are even more unlikely.  The odds of a girl beating up the leader of that group gets into the preposterous territory.

Aside from those obvious flaws, this movie is simply not that good.  Nobody really wants to see Karate Kid I all over again with Hillary Swank playing the part of Ralph Macchio.  Nothing against Swank, but she was simply an actress learning her way at this point, and this ridiculous, recycled role did nothing to help her out.  And the addition of monks who bowl with their eyes closed surely didn't help.

It's a wretched sequel.  Pat Morita and Hillary Swank may be good actors, but the idea to make this movie is as bad as playing with fireworks in an arid forest.",1212624000,5,1398,4.5910931174089065
627548,2,6303344224,"Giving you a brief rundown of where I stand, I thought Part 1 was excellent. I thought Part 2 was even better. I didn't like Part 3 as much, but it did have an interesting theme as well as some great moments. This 4th chapter was really a sad end to this great series. Mr. Myagi is still in great form, but there are not many other good things I can say about this 4th chapter. In Daniel's absence, Myagi trains Julie Pierce (Hilary Swank). Julie is a really nasty girl, and even though she has some redeeming points, she fails to endear herself to us the way Daniel did depsite his faults. Moving on, Julie finds herself getting into trouble at her school which is controlled by bullies. The ringleader Colonel Dugan (Ironside) is too put it mildly, a major jerk who carries no charm. In Part 1, Kreese carried a charm despite his psychosis. In 2, Sato was frightening, but we never really forgot that he had some redeeming points. We can also speculate that Kreese or Sato would have destroyed Dugan with one hand tied behind their back, without even breaking a sweat. Most of the fight scenes in this movie are forced and unconvincing. (Especially the fight at the service station.) Moving on, Julie in a sympathetic moment gets suspended from school. Mr. Myagi takes her to a monastery. There, Julie cause some havoc by trying to kill a cockroach. In the high point of this movie, Myagi has to explain to Julie that ALL life is sacred to the monks. (A deep profound moment in this weak movie. This is the one gem in this 4th chapter. ) Moving on, Julie goes back to school. In an absurd scene at the dance, Julie's friend Erick gets into a fight with Dugan's bootlicker Ned. This leads to a totally preposterous street confrontation. While the street fight in ""Rocky V"" was actually quite plausible, the street fight in this weak KK 4 was a sad way to end this series. On the + side, there was some satisfaction in seeing Myagi easily trash Dugan. In one saving moment, Myagi gives Julie a proverb: ""Fighting not good. But if must fight, win."" Compare Julie's comment: ""Mr. Myagi, we kicked butt,"" to Daniel's beautiful comment: ""Mr. Myagi, we did it!"" Being totally honest, Mr. Myagi did the best he could in this poor movie, and there was the profound scene in the monastery. But try comparing this 4th chapter to Part 1, 2, or even 3. See if 4 is ANYWHERE near as good as one of the other 3. While Director John Avildsen faithfully stayed at the Directing Helm from parts 1 to 3, he was smart to not have anything to do with this miserable 4th one. With all respect to Director John Avildsen, even his great directing could not have saved this doomed 4th chapter.",1211241600,5,2670,4.4621676891615545

So if this is the case and his mentor sent the grandmother to CA to his house shouldn't he have warned her about Daniel being there at least? They could have mentioned what happend to Daniel but in this movie they totally scratch him out and this movie is lacking because of it.  Another thing is this movie doesn't touch the other three in any way shape or form. Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio had an on screen chemistry that you just couldn't denye was there and it made the movies all that much better but Pat and Hilary don't have that same chemisty that made Pat and Ralph such a great acting team and it shows in the movie. Also the other Karate Kid movies each have a theme to them especially the second one and this one leaves you with no theme what so ever except bullies always get what they deserve in the end which is a tad over done by this installment and the fight scene at the end is a little over done as I think they were aiming for the same affect they had in the Karate Kid II but they missed it by a long shot. Over all this movie is pretty good. Has some good moments but it should not have been a stand a lone movie all on its own in my opinion as it could have been much better then.,1135036800,8,1484,4.013513513513513

The look like a professional security force, they act like a WWF tag-team, they tromp around school like they've got full diplomatic immunity...they even have a drill sergeant. In high school. I just don't get it.

Anyway, these guys don't like young Julie Pierce, so they terrorize her repeatedly - and they even come dangerously close to what we, nowadays, would call ""rape."" All Julie wants is to be left alone with her beloved crippled hawk (Kes?), godammit! Julie's well-intentioned grandmother is at the end of her granny-rope, so she enlists the aid of old family friend Mr. Miyagi. Given that this is now the fourth time we've met Mr. Miyagi, and we've never once seen him interact with a teenage girl, the viewer is left to wonder if this arrangement is such a grand idea. But wouldn't you know it? The brusque and bouncy Julie slowly warms up to the adorable Mr. Miyagi, and yadda yadda, etc.

To quote one of the wise sages who comment at the IMDb, The Next Karate Kid is ""the pits."" Hilary Swank must cringe whenever she sees the flick pop up on cable; indeed, she's the one thing that makes The Next Karate Kid worth seeing. Not because she gives a particularly excellent performance (although she's better than the material deserves), but because this is such a GOOFY movie. For no good reason the flick takes a 20-minute detour into a freakin' monastery, for cryin' out loud! Plus this is a film in which Mr. Miyagi goes shopping for a PROM DRESS! Gee, anyone think we're just blatantly pandering to the ""other"" demographic at this point? Then just wait till the Hi - larious scene in which Mr. Miyagi walks in on Julie while she's changing...and he almost sees her boobies! Never thought I'd say it but...where's Daniel-san these days? Surely he could still be in need of some wise advice.

Anyway, Julie gets a date, grows some confidence, and kicks the ass of head bully #1. Also there's Michael Ironside as an evil high school sergeant who is apparently invisible to cops. Miyagi helps kick his butt at the end.",1131062400,5,2130,4.644562334217507

They did NOT need this version girl or guy.

627683,5,6303344224,"""The Next Karate Kid"" is the fourth and as it stands final Karate Kid movie. Released in 1994, a few years after ""The Karate Kid Part III"", this movie no longer focuses on the Karate Kid Daniel and his relationship with his Karate teacher Mr Miyagi. It is unexplained but suffice it to say the original karate kid has grown up. In ""The Next Karate Kid"" we follow Mr Miyagi's relationship with a teenage girl named Julie and watch as she becomes the next karate kid.
Julie (played by Hilary Swank who went on to win an Oscar for ""Boys Don't Cry"") is being bullied by boys at school who are following the violent teachings of their coach. Mr Miyagi (played by Pat Morita from the original Karate Kid movies) comes into her life and helps Julie learn courage and self respect through the use of karate and belief in oneself.
In comparison to the other three Karate Kid movies, ""The Next Karate Kid"" is a lot less violent. The Karate Kid has been increasing the violence with each movie, but has gone the other way with this one, and is all the better for it. There is a lot less of the karate and a lot more of the kid! No longer does the karate kid become about the next fight scene or the major karate move taught by Mr Miyagi. In ""The Karate Kid"" Danny learnt the crane, in ""The Karate Kid Part II"" Danny learnt the driver punch and in ""The Karate Kid Part III"" Danny learnt the Miyagi family kata. These special moves were used at the end of each movie. In contrast, with ""The Next Karate Kid"" Mr Miyagi teaches Julie the tiger kick, but she doesn't need to use it in the final fight. In fact in this movie Mr Miyagi has the final fight. No longer is fighting the driving force of the movie, and I'm sure that's something Mr Miyagi would agree with since he hates fighting anyway.
Here in ""The Next Karate Kid"" we are able to focus on the characters. And from that we can really feel for them when the fight scene does come. So if you are looking for a real karate action movie I suggest another movie. The fight choreography itself is sometimes a little poor, but it is all done by the same choreographer as the original Karate Kid movies so maybe he was just having a bad day. Mr Miyagi also appears to be having a bad day, because although he wins his fights fairly easily, he does look very old when fighting. I'm sure he used to kick higher and not lose his balance in the previous movies.
Hilary Swank is truly fantastic as Julie. Hilary Swank makes you believe in Julie and her actions are perfectly credible through Hilary Swank's performance. Mr Miyagi is almost as much Mr Miyagi as he always was. I say this because some of what Mr Miyagi says is questionable. He says lines like ""If must fight, win!"" Not entirely sure Mr Miyagi would say that. Anyway this is down to the writing and not the wonderful performance from Pat Morita.
For me, the movie did end kind of suddenly since I was expecting a bigger fight at the end. However this is based on my experience of the other karate kid movies. This fourth installment is very understated so be prepared for that.
In conclusion, ""The Next Karate Kid"" is great and I'm glad it's on DVD.",1048636800,33,3147,4.335593220338983
627684,3,6303344224,"This was just as good, if not better, than The Karate Kid Part III. This is about Mr. Miyagi(Pat Morita) who flys out to Boston to visit his old friend's wife Louisa(Constance Towers). Louisa dosen't get along with her grandaughter Julie Pierce(Hilary Swank), so she deciedes to take a break from Julie and puts Mr. Miyagi in charge. At school, a boy named Ned(Michael Cavalieri) from a group named the Alpha Elite,  harasses Julie, while she befriends Eric McGowan(Chris Conrad) who joined the Alpha Elite, which is lead by Col. Dugan(Michael Ironside).  Then one day, Julie is caught trying to feed a hawk on the school roof and is suspended for two weeks. While she is suspended, Mr. Miyagi and Julie go somewhere to visit Miyagi's old friends. There, Mr. Miyagi teaches Julie some of the same things that he taught Daniel. When they return, Eric asks Julie to the prom. Meanwhile, Ned is mad at Eric for quiting the Alpha Elite. After the dance, Ned taunts Eric and ruins his car. Eric and the Alpha Elite get into a fight. Then Julie comes and trys to stop Ned from teasing her once and for all.....",1033776000,4,1104,4.627551020408164
627685,4,6303344224,"I am SO glad that this one was not as bad as KK3. The plot is interesting, Mr. Miyagi is acting like himself again, and Hillary Swank is a great actress. The very beginning was a little shaky, but after that the movie became very good.
This movie has the idea of the first one somewhat, but featuring a quick-tempered girl, Julie. Mr. Miyagi is staying at her house while her grandmother goes to his house for some peace and quiet. Miyagi first has to earn Julie's respect during his stay. While he is there, he teaches her Kata for self-defense against a guy she hates, as well as how to dance for the upcoming prom. It may sound clich, but when you see it you will like it.
Mr. Miyagi also takes Julie to a Buddhist monastery, with monks who turn out to be quite humorous. The best part is when they visit Julie's house and go ""Zen bowling"" on her prom night.
Overall, this was a great comeback from the horrible KK3. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is nothing can truly match up to the original Karate Kid. My advice? Buy the DVD of this one and the original, skip KK2 and KK3. This is the perfect sequel for the first one, as it does not ruin the charactars.",1019865600,9,1183,4.215859030837004
