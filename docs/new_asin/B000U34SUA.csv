8211977,1,B000U34SUA,I bought this for my father and was disappointed that it did not play in his dvd player.  It played an opening sequence for 10 seconds and would not progress to the next section of the dvd.  All other dvds work fine.,1343347200,,216,4.119047619047619
8211978,5,B000U34SUA,"At first glance you're expecting a routine string of interviews, Q&A's and the like, but in reality, each of the personages presented offer an entirely new, different & frankly refreshing insight into some key & some not so key golfing personalities. What strikes you throughout is that the focus is on the interviewee, not their feats, and what makes them the people they are and perhaps an insight into how they became, performed and achieved in a maddeningly difficult sport. No two interviews are alike, nor even similar, the format is spontaneous and unrehearsed, almost as if you were asking the questions. All in all, a great way to spend a relaxing and entertaining almost three hours. I thoroughly recommend it for great viewing.",1321228800,,738,4.959677419354839
8211979,4,B000U34SUA,"My son is the golfer, I just can't see chasing a little white ball around a field.  Anyway, he will love this product!  Can't wait for CHIRSTmas to give it to him!",1221782400,,163,4.0625
8211980,5,B000U34SUA,"I bought several copies for friends of mine and I watched it one day.
I don't golf but I enjoyed watching the CD. It's very good for Golfers.

8211982,4,B000U34SUA,"This was a father's day gift for my father.  The only thing I was not impressed with was the length of time it took for me to get the item, other than that I would recommend this DVD.",1214870400,2,183,3.8157894736842106
8211983,5,B000U34SUA,"What moving stories from the Big Three, Nancy Lopez, Fred Funk and Jarrod Lyle.  Everyone of them opened up and gave personal accounts that made me feel like they were in my living room.  It is inspiring to hear about their love of the game, their support system, and their ability to achieve.  Pearls of wisdom come through in every interview.

I lent it to a friend and after he watched it, he passed it on to his brother, so I'm going to get another copy for myself.",1199232000,5,469,4.295454545454546
