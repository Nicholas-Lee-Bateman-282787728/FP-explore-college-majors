8622687,5,B00GFZLE8G,This film is superb and Clu Gulagher is his usual outstanding self. I only wish we could see him in more films or perhaps theatrical productions. Do not be put off by this being called a short film. It was so mesmerizing that it seemed to go on and on. I am 67 and fell in love with this actor at 12. He vividly portrays the angst of all of us as we find ourselves becoming redundant when we feel ((and are) every bit as vibrant as ever. This movie keeps coming back to mind and is oddly comforting despite its poignancy.,1491523200,,521,4.117647058823529

8622691,5,B00GFZLE8G,"Just finished experience this gem of a film. It saddens to know that Mr. Sage Stallone will not be gracing the world with his artistry as he did such an amazing job with VIC. What was to be an early glimpse into this man's talent ended up a sore reminder what what we lossed as a society.

As in my usual reviews, I don't waste much time with synopsis'. You can read what it's about for yourself. What you want to know is, 'is it worth my time and money?'. To that I'd shout an overwhelming and unanumous 'Yes it is!' VIC is as endearing as it is tragic. Clu Gulager shines in the performance of a lifetime as a 'has been' actor trying to survive in a world that has left him behind. While that premise may sound like familiar territory, the magic lies in the over package. By that, I mean, expert cinematography which beautifully captures the chaos in our protagonist's mind; the tension, the desperation...the hopelessness. Equally effective is the score, which punctuates every mood, every feeling. Acting and editing all top notch. This is a solid production. A brilliant character study into the life of a man trying to hold onto his dignity, knowing he is breaking and as the audience you will break a little bit with him. This is what cinema is capable of. While I really hoped we would've been able to see more of Mr. Stallone's wonder, I am happy I got to own a piece of a legacy that will endure forever.

Give VIC a chance, tell your friends. Let the world take part in this masters short lived, yet meaningful work of art!

8622692,5,B00GFZLE8G,"This is a unique film.  Clu Gulager gives a very moving portrayal of an older actor trying to make a comeback.  I have really enjoyed his performances for many years.  The reality of being forgotten is not entirely unique to the film industry, although it is much more evident there.  The fact is that in many other occupations there are many who are made to feel that they are no longer useful as they grow older.  It would have been nice to have had a different ending, but reality is seldom the way we would like it to be.  I cannot say that I ""enjoyed"" this movie, but it is one that I will long remember and I hope others will, too.",1392249600,4,637,4.180327868852459
