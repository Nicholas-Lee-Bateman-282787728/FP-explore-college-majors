7788143,5,0615208185,"As an early childhood art teacher for grades K and 1st, I am always looking for age appropriate art DVD's to celebrate the end of the school year. This is the perfect DVD: it has step by step drawing using shapes, animation, real animals, and ""catchy"" upbeat music and the children spontaneously can dance. I showed it to approx. 25 different classes and it was A+++ with all of them!!! When are you going to make Vol. 2? I will be first in line to purchase your next one:)",1277769600,,473,4.325842696629214
7788144,5,0615208185,"Easy enough that even I could use it(and I'm way older than kids).

I look forward to giving it out as gifts to friends' kids.  AND, now I know that whenever I want to try to remember how to draw a circle, square or triangle, I can just look at fish, dogs and other animals, to remind me!

Awesome show, great job!",1217030400,,314,4.032258064516129
7788145,5,0615208185,"My wife and I recently watched our four year old niece for a few days and were pretty concerned about how we would entertain her being that our own child has way outgrown dolls and cartoons. That was, until we put in Art House for her. She was so enthralled with the teacher; she kept raising her hand and holding up her drawings for Emily (the teacher) to see.  The minute it was over, she asked to watch it again and was laughing and interacting as if it were the first time she had ever seen it. Not to mention the fantastic art work that she drew!!! She was so proud to give it to her parents and brought the video to school to ""share day.""
Now, any time we have a gift to give a young child this is a no-brainer. Wrap it up with crayons and paper and you are a hero!
Thanks for saving us from what could have been a very LONG weekend!",1214265600,2,839,4.023952095808383
7788146,5,0615208185,"I can't believe how easy this was for my son. After watching the dvd just once he was able to draw all the shapes, no problem.  And then he wanted to watch it again!  My refrigerator is covered in drawings now.  And he's been singing the song all day.  I was getting pretty tired of all the same dvds, and I'm thrilled to have something new to put into the rotation.",1212364800,3,366,4.112676056338028
7788147,5,0615208185,At first my 4 1/2 year old daughter was unsure whether she would be able to follow the instructions and draw the animals.  To her surprise she was able to keep up with teacher Emily and she still had time to dance around to the songs.  It quickly became one of her favorite videos!,1210896000,3,281,4.185185185185185
