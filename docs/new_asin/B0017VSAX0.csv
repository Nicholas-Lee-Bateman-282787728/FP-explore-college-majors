INNER SANCTUM is a low budget noir goodie that has a most excellent eerieness to it. We open with a woman filing her nails; she's warned by an eccentric named Dr. Valonius to stop using the sharply pointed rasp, as the train they're in is about to go around a tight curve. Even though he's never taken this ride before, the prescient Valonious ""knows"" she'll cut herself and sure enough, the stubbornly unheeding gal does.

In the next gloomy scene, a story Valonius tells, we witness a man heave what appears to be a body in a canvas bag onto the caboose platform of a stopped train. He's seen by a pre-teen freckle-faced boy, and this jumpy guy almost bashes the unsuspecting kid's brains in with what looks to be a tire iron. Instead, the youngster's mother arrives just in time, and she angrily drags her wayward son home.

There's been a river flood, roads are closed and the bridge is out, so the killer (he obviously is) gets trapped in town. He ends up boarding at the home of the very child he wanted to murder just an hour earlier. The boy suspects he's the man who tossed a large bag onto the train and had a bloody arm, but isn't sure. Obviously, his life is in danger as long as this stranger remains in the house.

We won't reveal the entire plot, but the story ends as it began: with Dr. V. and the lady, who again won't listen when he advises her not to leave the train. What occurs next is the sort of finale that Rod Serling would use to great effect on his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TWILIGHT-ZONE/dp/B000H5U5EE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TWILIGHT ZONE</a>&nbsp;TV series.

""Inner Sanctum"" is a fine programmer peopled by first rank 'B' actors (if such a category exists) and is highly recommended!
