8427944,5,B004FN2510,"This is a great ""behind the scene"" show of the Airventure event in Oshkosh Wisconsin. Recommended for every person who plans to visit this event or has been there. for those who like air shows, this is a great program for seeing how a large airshow is being made but this is not an air show depiction - you see a few clips of the airshow itself but there are lots of dramatic events surrounding that airshow.",1440547200,,408,4.311688311688312
8427945,5,B004FN2510,"This is an insightful and thorough look at how the massive EAA Airventure takes place in Oshkosh, Wisconsin every year.  The 2007 show is shown from before the start to after the finish, highlighting the unique problems of getting so many aircraft in and out, day after day.

It doesn't miss anything, and that means, unfortunately, the P-51 collision on landing that resulted in the death of one pilot and airplane.  But while the tape shows this event fully, it doesn't sensationalize it, but rather puts it in perspective with the inevitable risks of a lot of airplanes in close proximity.

While, by its nature, Oshkosh may not exactly be representative of most of the air shows that occur in North America, you'll still get the idea of what needs to happen to make these shows work.",1302048000,2,787,4.7226277372262775
