8760017,1,B01F3LOUHE,"Kareena Kapoor's marriage to fellow actor Nawab (prince?) Saif Ali Khan has totally affected her acting.  A totally stupid story about a billionnair's son who misses his mommy and wants to be a stay-at-home househusband(?), playing with oversized model trains (that also carry the food he cooks, from his kitchen to the dining table).  A 7 minute cameo by the real life Amitabh and Jaya Bachchans does nothing to save this dull and repetitive hammering of ""I love you, but..."" film. Do not waste your money and time. Go watch some Kareena before-she-got-married movies, where  superlatives were not enough to describe her mastery of the art.",1479427200,2,641,5.028301886792453

8760021,4,B01F3LOUHE,"Very cute movie, with an unusual storyline; and lots of little effects that make it a very charming movie with some ups & downs, of course. Lead actor and actress very good and believable.",1465603200,4,188,4.5588235294117645
