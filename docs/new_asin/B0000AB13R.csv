7996601,2,B0000AB13R,"Tired and cliched actioner that is nothing by a cheap knock-off of DIE HARD (1988). Congresswoman Helen Filmore (Jillian McWhirter; DUNE WARRIORS - 1990) travels to Malaysia to take a tour of the newly-opened American chemical plant Chemco, only to find herself and the American Chemco executives taken hostage by terrorist Gerald Richter (Vernon Wells; KING OF THE ANTS - 2004) and his band of black-clad goons. Richter demands twenty-five million dollars for the safe return of the Congresswoman, but it becomes clear that he is only using this situation as a front for something more devious. Luckily for the Congresswoman, she brought along ex-CIA operative Ryan Cooper (Jerry Trimble) as a bodyguard. Cooper breaks free and leads the Congresswoman, Chemco executive William Atkins (Bob McFarland; NOT LIKE US - 1995) and Chemco employee Pete Olo (Archie Adamos; NAM ANGELS - 1988) through the plant's labryinth-like structure as they fight a never-ending supply of Richter's men in their quest to reach safety. It turns out that Richter was actually after Chemco's top-secret new nerve gas called KZ7079 and, once he gets his hands on it, he unleashes a small canister of it at an innocent crowd of people who have gathered outside the Chemco plant, killing them. He then demands fifty million dollars or he will uncork more of the nerve gas in a major city, threatening to kill many more people. The rest of the film details Cooper's numerous battles with Richter's men and, finally, with Richter himself, as he tries to stop the nerve gas from being dispensed. Cooper must also rescue the Congresswoman again when it is revealed that William Atkins is actually on Richter's team. After blowing up the Chemco plant and getting away with a large amount of the nerve gas, Richter escapes on a freighter with the Congresswoman as a hostage (After killing two of his own men after they try to rape the Congresswoman, Richter then takes his turn and gives it a go!). Never fear, because Cooper isn't far behind. Expect lots of ass-kickings and explosions.  This is the third, and final, actioner that Filipino director/producer Cirio H. Santiago made with martial artist/non-actor Jerry ""Golden Boy"" Trimble (LIVE BY THE FIST [1992] and ONE MAN ARMY [1993] being the other two) and it is definitely the worst of the trio. While the other two were nothing to write home about, STRANGLEHOLD is a tepid affair at best and the fact that it took three people (Mark Evan Schwartz, Brendan Broderick and Rob Kerchner) to write the generic screenplay speaks volumes on how desperate this film really is. It's nothing but a series of badly-staged gun battles, martial arts fights and chases, none of them particularly exciting or bloody. It's pretty clear that at this stage in his career, director Santiago was running on fumes and delivers a film that lacks any vibrancy or life. It didn't help that Roger Corman, who financed the majority of Santiago's films, forced Santiago to make this film on a budget that wouldn't feed a hungry family at dinnertime. Most of the film takes place at either the same boiler room set (filmed at different angles) or at a boardroom where the American government representatives (including Santiago staples Ken Metcalfe and Henry Strzalkowski) endlessly discuss what to do about Richter and his demands (They, of course, end up doing nothing and only serve to pad out the film's paltry running time). We all know how bad Jerry Trimble is as an actor (he also looks like he packed on a few pounds since ONE MAN ARMY), but the usually reliable Vernon Wells is simply horrible here and looks like he's coke-out or high on meth. This is quite possibly Santiago's worst film ever and even though it's only 73 minutes long, it's a chore to sit through. A total dud from start to finish. Santiago would go on to direct only a handful of films after this (2005's BLOODFIST 2050 is his last as of this writing), but he is still active as a producer. Also starring James Paolelli, Tony Carreon, Joe Sabatino, Joseph Zucchero (also this film's Editor), Jim Broome, Paul Holmes and Ramon D'Salva. Available on VHS & DVD from New Horizons/New Concorde Home Video. Rated R. NOTE: Sadly, Cirio H. Santiago passed away in 2008 and his last film, WATER WARS (co-directed by Jim Wynorski when Santiago passed away in the middle of filming), is still looking for a U.S. home video distributor. Word is, that as the films stands right now, it is unsalable (From what I heard, lead actor Michael Madsen looks drunk as a skunk throughout the entire film and the different styles between the two directors is highly obvious). When even Roger Corman can't sell a film, you know there has to be serious problems with it, but eventually everything makes it to home video.",1432339200,,4774,4.857668711656442
7996602,1,B0000AB13R,"The Chemco company in Malaysia is being visited by Ohio Congressman Filmore (Jillian McWhirter) for a photo op and to promote out sourcing in general. She and others get taken hostage and only Ryan Cooper (Jerry Trimble) can save her.

Please note Jerry Trimble keeps his shirt on in the film and doesn't go shirtless as depicted on the DVD cover. Also Jillian McWhirter wears a white bra and not a black bra like said cover and I have no idea who that other girl in the white bra could be on the front cover or where the scene of of our two main characters embrace while she is in a blue bra.

Not well acted or written.

7996605,2,B0000AB13R,"By watching ""Stranglehold,"" I complete my quest of seeing all of Jerry Trimble's solo starring vehicles, and I'm afraid I have to say that I wish this could have been more rewarding. I've always maintained that Trimble was one of the best physical specimens of the 90s movie scene, and thus it's a particular shame that he mostly got stuck with directors who didn't really know how to shoot a film. I take ""Stranglehold"" particularly hard, since it's the only vehicle of his I've seen that doesn't even focus on his strengths as an action hero. Cirio Santiago's attempt to make ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>&nbsp;in a chemical factory"" might be fine by Filipino standards of the time, but it's incredibly disappointing for someone like me who cries at the fact that Jerry Trimble hasn't been a leading man for almost twenty years...although if I were to judge by this film alone, I wouldn't be surprised.

The story: Congresswoman Helen Filmore (Jillian McWhirter,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dentist-2-Brace-Yourself/dp/1573625485/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dentist 2: Brace Yourself</a>) is taken hostage by a psychotic terrorist threatening to unleash a deadly chemical upon the earth (Vernon Wells,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-Warrior/dp/0790729342/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road Warrior</a>), and the only man who can stop him is undercover agent Ryan Cooper (Trimble,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Master/dp/B000067J48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Master</a>).

As for positives, the film is marginally better shot and produced than the average Santiago picture, and for what it's worth, the movie doesn't waste nearly as much time as others in getting its action content underway: there are no intro scenarios or throwaway setups, meaning that the kidnapping of McWhirter's character and the taking over of the chemical plant in question take place within the opening five minutes. Easily-pleased action fans (read: easier to please than me) will appreciate the lack of dramatic padding as the film shoots through its slim 73-minute runtime, but I need to admit that I was displeased how little characterization the performers are afforded. Jerry's character may as well have been named ""Generic Blonde Hero #4"" for all you get to know about him, and few other characters fare better. I can't believe I'm writing this, but damn it - not even cheapo action flicks should completely ignore the benefits of a decent script!

Buy this movie if it's your heart's desire to watch Jerry Trimble shoot a machinegun, because he does so liberally throughout the film. John Woo would be proud of how many bullets the Golden Boy goes through. I, however, am ashamed of how little martial arts action there is in the film, at the expense of all the gunfighting. There's some kicking within the first ten minutes and then there are a couple fights near the end of the film, but this just isn't enough for the guy who's had some good brawls in his career with Jet Li, Loren Avedon, and Michel Qissi. Maybe the idea here was to turn Jerry into more of an all-around action hero who didn't have to rely on karate setups in his action scenes, but since he doesn't really do anything more exciting than rappel down a wire during the middle of the movie, I'm not convinced this was the best course of action. Because of this, I declare ""Stranglehold"" to be the worst Trimble vehicle ever made.

Not convinced? Well, if you still think this will be a good movie, then you probably won't mind the ridiculously fake-looking miniature models used in the shots showing the factory blowing up - you're dealing with a pretty darn cheap film, here. I'm only writing as an action fan, and this area, the movie just doesn't deliver adequately. I have no reason to believe that Jerry will return to full-time action moviemaking (though I'm hopeful for his participation in an upcoming Dolph Lundgren flick), and thus it's with great disappoint that I bestow such a lackluster rating upon ""Stranglehold."" Believe me, I really wanted to like this one, but it clearly wasn't made for me.",1338768000,,4331,5.547655068078669
7996606,5,B0000AB13R,"Do you like cornball 80's action movies?
Do you like those movies to star kickboxers you never heard of before?
Do you like movies that feature absolutely nothing shown on the cover?
Do you like bad editing?

...but most importantly...do you like Vernon Wells?

My answer to all of those questions is: HELLS YES!  And this movie has it all and more (or less).

No, I am not joking about the cover thing either.  Even the screenshots on the back of the case aren't in the film.  There's no awesome shirtless chain swing while choking a guy with a desert eagle.  There is no scene where a woman in a white bra is flying from an explosion, or a black bra lady running for her life.  BUT what there IS, is a ton of 80's cheese and Vernon ""Chainmail Vest"" Wells being a total badass...and isn't that worth thr price of admission alone?

Stranglehold is a perfect stocking stuffer for anyone who loves greatastic action and whoawesome plots.  Buy it...shoot, buy three or four of them and pass them out to your friends.  You will thank me.  It's worth baderiffic every moment.",1329609600,2,1070,4.515625
