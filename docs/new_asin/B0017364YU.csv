The editing is horrendous.  Cut, cut, cut, wipe, cut, slide, cut, cut.  Scarcely anyone gets more than a sentence out and then it's off to the next interviewee.  If you want to watch an hour and a half of two second scenes, they've got you covered here.",1378252800,6,361,4.507692307692308
3167253,4,B0017364YU,"This is one of TWO DVD documentaries released this month by Music Video Distributors about modern day ""comic books"". (The other is ""The Story of Rock and Roll Comics"").  While the R&RC DVD focuses on one publisher, this documentary covers the gamut of those involved in the ""independent"" field going back to the underground comics of the late 1960s. No, there are no interviews with Robert Crumb, but Director Chris Brandt includes Robert Williams, creator of Zap Comics - one of the first 10 underground comics - and Ron Turner from Last Gasp and Gary Groth, the publisher of Fantagraphics (one of my favorite ""comics"" reprint publishers). The 77-minute film, which forms the core of this DVD, was made by Brandt in 2007. A lot of the interviews - with writers, artists, illustrators and publishers - were done at the annual ComicCon but others are done in the offices of the interviewees. The focus is on why these folks got into the business and how they have succeeded (or failed). There is a short history of the ""comic"" included but this is expanded in the bonus features. (More on those in a moment.). There is no narrator and Brandt has edited the comments so that they form the narration. He has a ""cognitive psychologist"" from USC comment on the psychology of comics but it looks silly, with the ""Dr."" in a white lab coat (!) pontificating. I could have done without that guy. And the music lips that Brandt uses (mostly electronic pop) gets annoying after a while. But these are rally minor faults. The closing credits run almost 7 minutes, as Brandt gives credit to all the interviewees, the artwork shown and the music used, but he adds more interview clips as they run.  The bonus feature run almost as long as the film itself. The outtakes and extended interviews (called ""Trimmings"") are nearly 30 minutes plus there are short features on comic book store owners and some of the pioneers in the business (including the aforementioned Ron Turner and the guy that co-created Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles).

I'm not that knowledgeable about recent comics, though I'm a big fan of Crumb, but I did learn a lot about pop culture from the interviewees and it was time well spent. I'd certainly recommend this to anyone who frequents the growing number of ""comic book and graphic novel stores"". They will recognize some of their favorites here.

This dvd had some promise such as Eric Powell ( The Goon ) and Erik Larsen ( The Savage Dragon ), and I expected for them to share their experiences in their career, how they broke in and made a name for themselves, how they go about making an issue of their book etc. You get none of this. Instead you get some artists, most that have never been heard of talking about the allure of comic books.

8264792,5,B0017364YU,"As an artist, I am always interested in what other artists are doing, comics or otherwise. How can you not be? It would have been really neat to see the studios these artists worked in, some were seated at their drawing tables, but for me, I want to see their environment. Anyway, back to the movie, I loved it! And I would encourage any one who wants to do comics to watch this and seriously take notes. The one thing they did not talk about was the time and physical effort that goes into creating a comic. But you should watch this, absolutely!",1464912000,,547,4.320388349514563
