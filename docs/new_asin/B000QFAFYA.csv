That being said I rated it 4 stars simply because they do not actually interview Martina herself. If you are a Martina fan this is a very good addition to any collection, A&E always does an excellent job with their shows. They interview Billie Jean King, Chris Evert and Pam Shriver. As usual they cover some matches and give you an insight into her life and career. There is really nothing new here but if you are a collector or a fan you will enjoy watching this.",1404432000,,594,4.173913043478261
