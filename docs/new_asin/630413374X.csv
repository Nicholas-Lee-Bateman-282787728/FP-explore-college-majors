The Sequels of Stephen King

by

M. M.

  Stephen King has written many sequels.  Big Wheels: a Tale of the Laundry Game (Milkman # 2), The Way Station, The Slow Mutants, The Gunslinger and the Dark Man, The Dark Tower II: the Drawing of the Three, The Dark Tower III: the Wastelands and Wizard and Glass to name a few.  There are also The Regulators and Desperation.  There is also, what I like to call the Castle Rock stories.
  Nona, Cujo, The Sun Dog, The Body, The Dark Half, Sleepwalkers, Needful Things and It Grows on You.  The Breathing Method is a sequel to The Man who Would Not Shake Hands.  Stephen King once wrote a sequel to the Cthulhu mythos.  One for the Road is a sequel to Salems Lot.
  Nevertheless, Stephen King didn't write all of his own sequels.  In 92, they wrote Pet Sematary Two.  Then they made Children of the Corn II: the Final Sacrifice.  Then there came Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest.
  Then there came Sometimes They Come Back Again.  Then there was Children of the Corn IV: the Gathering.  Then there is The Rage: Carrie 2.  Finally, there is Children of the Corn V: Field of Terror, Children of the Corn 666 and Children of the Corn (2009) the remake maybe don't you think?  Yes; course there is!!

792958,1,630413374X,"Imagine if you will that you are a formerly beloved sitcom dad sleepwalking through a role in a straight to video sequel of something based on something written by Stephen King. Your daughter is destined to win two Oscar awards, but the current movie asks nothing of her but to look suspicious and squirm in fear. And you are being hounded by a man who looks so much like a young Jerry Seinfeld pretending to be a greaser that it's not even funny. I keep wanting him to say, ""Demon Hell spawn? What is the deal with that.""
Here's an example of the witty wordplay of hell-demon Tony Reno, played really badly by Alexis Arquette: See, he picks up a severed hand, right? Because he's just chopped a guy up with a driving lawn mower. He picks up the bloody hand from the bloody lawn. And there's nobody around, right, and nothing he needs help with, but he says, ""Hey, can you give me a hand?""
Ha
ha

That joke never gets old.
I'm sorry, but except for The Shining, everything, EVERYTHING of Stephen King's I see on the screen feels like an afterschool special where swears, gore and boobies are allowed.
At about the 2/3 mark, William Morgan Sheppard as Father Archer says, ""Better the end of a thing than the beginning of one."" And I was, indeed, really looking forward to this movie being over.",1404172800,2,1295,4.445378151260504
792959,2,630413374X,Better made than last movie and Alexis arquette was truely disturbing but weaker script and is just a step above most direct to DVD horror,1400457600,,138,4.56
792960,4,630413374X,Sometimes they come back again is a good movie if your into horror movies but it could never beat the original i mean this movie has actor's who play in other horror movies like Michael gross from the tremors franchise so if you like hardcore horror movies this is for you.,1399939200,,273,4.372549019607843
792961,5,630413374X,"This movie has to be one of the greatest film ever made. It's also amazing how well Adam Grossman directed this movie, since his version of  ""Carnival Of Souls"" was terrible. And the acting by Alexis  Arquette is amazing. He's really creepy. And just wait until you see the  ""Tarot-card-death"". It looks real, and I think that's the only  killing that has ever moved me in a way. See this movie today...you won't  regret it.",968457600,2,424,4.6
