[...]

It is VERY detailed about the Zionist atrosities commited in Occupied Palestine by the Facist Minority Regime. It shows horrid crimes and backs up the points with evidence. (keep in mind most of the evidences have been covered up by pro-zionist/israeli websites and media).

The other reviewers are unfair and are also pro-zionist, so don't bother listening to them, their rather pathetic, defending criminals and discouraging this Excellent documentary.

I will admit, its an amateur production, but atleast the creator of it, had the courage to do so, I am very deeply happy to see the western people, standing up for what they believe in, Freedom and Truth.

The film maker has Exposed the Zionist Facist Terror Attacks against the US, Arabs, Palestinens, Libyans, europeans and everyone else who was unfortunate enough to die by these zionist criminals. Also has exposed the Human Body Harvesting operations on Palestinen CHILDREN by the israeli government.

I would recommend Watching this video, I support it and I recommend it to Everyone. Pay no attention to israeli-zionist supporters, they are very blind and VERY Cruel to support such horrid things... its like people supporting the Hutus Massacring and Raping the Tutsi population in Rwanda, or the Soviet Russians butchering and executing jews and other non-communists. Even the Nazi Germans weren't as bad as the israeli government and its settlers/military.",1341878400,,1504,5.298319327731092
8155190,1,B000K9PRCW,"If only the Arabs would focus on changing their desert as did the Jews then the hatred would stop.  No need for Arab lies as seen in this poorly fabricated DVD.  If only the Arabs respected their women perhaps they would stop their irrational hatred of America's and Israel's recognition of equal rights.  If only the Arabs recognized that Jews have lived in Israel since before the time of Jesus over 2000 years ago then they would hate less.  If only the Arabs realized that mahoomid was born ?600? years AFTER Jesus then they would discard their false claims to the land of Israel.  If only the Arabs realized that ancient Israel was 8500 square miles including the land now called Jordan and the Jews have already given away too much for peace as Israel is now only 5500 square miles relative to over a million square miles of Arabic lands then the region would know peace.  If only the Arabs realized that over 1 million Jews were FORCED from their homes in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria,... to come to Israel and these Arabic lands refused to accept the 400,000 Arab ""Palestinians"" who VOLUNTARILY left Israel in 1948 with a goal of returning as conquerors (bad gamble as the Jews now fight back and defeated the Arab armies combined)  then the region would know peace.  If only the Arabs directed their efforts to study and better themselves instead of hate then they would not fear/despise/resent/be jealous so very much of the Israelis living on ancient Jewish lands, centuries before mehumid was born!",1300752000,,1513,4.726235741444867
8155191,1,B000K9PRCW,"The information is important, but the production values are pathetic. never ending monotonous distorted voice-over with overbearing music that is just not appropriate.
The dude that made this is obviously a first time amatuer with no emotion or video production skills whatsoever. Steer well clear.

the shame of it is - 'Zionist War Crimes: The Case For The Prosecution' the subject is vital, but this video was made by an utter dork. He should have taken professional advice before
persuing this project. Just because you can cut a project at home does not make you a professional.",1296432000,,583,5.010309278350515
