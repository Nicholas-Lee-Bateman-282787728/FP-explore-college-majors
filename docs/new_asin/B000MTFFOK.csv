8310693,1,B000MTFFOK,The worst quality dvd I have ever seen. The old VHS I used to own was 20 times better quality. Very disappointing. Pretty much unwatchable,1439078400,,138,4.56
8310694,5,B000MTFFOK,"I owned the video many years ago and was so excited to see it out on DVD. This stands out as one of the definitive FMX videos of all time, and is an epic purchase - the soundtrack rules, as does the riding. Quality is awesome too - very happy!",1402790400,,243,3.88
8310695,5,B000MTFFOK,"LBZ's Chrome and Rechromed came at a time when motocross vids had a simple formula: fast edits, fast music, and big jumps. Chrome and Rechromed don't lack in any of those areas at all, and they have the feeling of rebellion and non-conformity that helped shape Freestyle Motocross.

If you like fast, fun editing and punk music, these videos are for you.",1292976000,,354,4.709677419354839
