8220772,1,B000HRLWO4,"This book is less expensive than the same volume packaged with the DVD, but is supposed to come with access to online video content. When you attempt to log on, you find that no page with such video content exists. That's just tacky. I won't buy from this publisher again.",1305417600,2,272,4.46
8220773,5,B000HRLWO4,"This would make an invaluable tool for any educator or coach in the field of strength training. Texts are great but there's nothing like seeing a moving image that can be replayed to help improve an athletes' technique.
If you're into strength or a teacher BUY IT.",1187136000,4,264,4.638297872340425
8220774,3,B000HRLWO4,"Good quality recording. Recommend for someone with absolutely no basic understanding of the olympic lifts. Do not get this if you are looking to refine your technique. And the 30 excercise thing? About 25 of them are variations of the pull. Underestandable since that is the most important part of the lifts, but misleading. The other 5 are the snatch, clean, jerk, squat and deadlift. If you would like to buy my copy for half price, e-mail me.",1185926400,11,445,4.717948717948718
8220775,5,B000HRLWO4,"i've never learned how to do olympic style lifts in the 15 + years i've been exercising. as conditioning specialist, i felt the need to expand my horizons especially for my clients who are in sports requiring strength and power. this dvd is great!! highly recomended for anyone wanting to take themselves and or their clients to the next level.",1180310400,6,344,4.75
