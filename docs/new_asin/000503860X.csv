16,4,000503860X,"It is an excellent experience to watch this DVD after all these years of being an X fan.  It was also very cool to watch this right after a repeated viewing of the DVD X--The Unheard Music (1985).  X still has every ounce of energy and connection it had back then. The only reason I gave it four stars is that John Doe's Bass is overshadowed in the mix.  But having said that, it is a DVD I will treasure for years to come.",1123891200,10,423,4.011904761904762
17,5,000503860X,"I have a thing against purchasing live DVDs. After all, how many times do you want to sit and watch a gig that you probably weren't even there for in the first place?

But as a dedicated X fan, I couldn't resist checking this out, and I'm thrilled that I did. This is the band in top-notch form.

It's encouraging that people who weren't around L.A. during X's heyday are finally clueing in to how historically important they were, and still are. And this DVD proves they're still as vital and viable as ever.

Do yourself a favor. If you've wandered to this page, there must be a reason. Don't leave without purchasing this DVD. You'll be glad you did, whether you're a diehard fan like myself, or a fan of music who is simply curious. All hail X, and may they continue to make music together for years to come.",1123286400,9,812,4.364238410596027
18,5,000503860X,"This DVD is unbelievable!  If you are a fan of punk rock, you have to own this DVD.  They play all of their classic songs and the bonus footage is amazing.  I think my favorite part is when they play ""White Girl.""  X has been around for a long time and this is their first live concert DVD, so it makes it even more awesome.  And the liner notes by Flea of The Red Hot Chili Peppers are really cool too.  Definitely buy this DVD!  It's worth every penny!",1116374400,8,454,4.033707865168539
19,5,000503860X,"Just brought this DVD home, and it rocks.  Those uninitiated to this great band don't know, but the fans understand, that this is a band that never disappoints live, and I can vouch for this having seen them 25+ times with and without Billy Zoom, solo, and in their Knitters incarnation.  The cool thing about this DVD is that it does not feel nostalgic - unlike the recent Blasters DVD (also by the good folks at Shout!).  The Blasters were and are a fine band, but one look at the audience on that DVD shows that the thrill is, if not gone, definitely waning.  No so with X.  Fans are still passionate, the playing and singing are still passionate, like the band still totally believes in what they are doing, and it shows.  So, fans will love it, but can this win over some new fans?  That's the question.  If you love the band, this DVD is a must buy.  For those of you with tangential interest, or who love other great bands like The Ramones, The Clash etc., or all of you on the east coast not too familiar with the band, take the plunge.  This DVD rocks.  Dare I ask....rock and roll hall of fame anyone????",1115942400,9,1114,4.3076923076923075
20,5,000503860X,"This is exactly how a concert DVD should be done. Tons of cudos to the editors and director of ""X Live in Los Angeles"". Thank you for just showing this amazing live performace, of one of Los Angeles greatests bands. Not .5 seconds rapid fire editing that would make someone sick to their stomach, just simple edits that emphises the music. When Billy Zoom does a solo the camera is actually on......Billy Zoom. Now to the performance. Basically, X still has it, in spades. The song selection is good, John Doe sounds as great as ever and the band is smoking.

I have seen X do faster paced sets in my day but this one is very good. Although the DVD is excellent, the best way to experience this show is to get as many people as you can into your living room, turn the heater onto around 100 degrees and blast this sucker. Now we're living.",1115942400,39,839,4.343949044585988
21,5,000503860X,"I have seen X live many times, both in the early days and their more recent reunion shows. Trust me when I say this: they never disappoint as a live band! This DVD document of a show on their home turf of LA is a dream come true. Can't wait.",1114041600,11,241,3.84
22,5,000503860X,"I was so excited for this!  Finally, a live concert video from X!  I've seen them twice, both times with Tony G. on guitar (he was superb by the way).  But we all know you HAVE to have Billy Zoom in the band. I haven't been able to see them, but this DVD will do the trick.  This DVD is AMAZING!! One listen/viewing makes me instantly forget all the ""power pop"" ""punk"" bands that are around now.  Their sound is fantastic, full, fast, heavy, thrilling!  All the members sound excellent, period.  I'm hopeful that there will be a tour, come on X!  Us old fogeys would like to see you old fogeys play your beautiful music for us!! UPDATE:  I've been so lucky to catch X a couple of times with Billy on guitar since I wrote this, it was just incredible seeing them, this DVD does give an accurate view of what it is like to have X RIPPING it up in concert!  cheers.",1112745600,5,862,4.16969696969697
23,5,000503860X,"X is one of the best punk bands ever. I don't even like calling them a punk band, but that's what they call themselves so I guess it's OK. This is musically complex punk with a lot of influences and a lot of tight playing and gripping tunes.

This is an awesome concert. The only two problems are that 1) it is just 67 minutes long and 2) John Doe's bass is buried too deep in the mix.

Every X fan should get this. More importantly, anyone who doesn't know about X should get this.

Why X? Did you know, for example, that:
- X has a different sound based on the unique harmonies between co-lead singers Exene Cervenka and John Doe that really sets them apart from anything else out there?
- Doe, Cervenka and drummer DJ Bonebrake also play in the country punk band The Knitters?
- Billy Zoom, the guitarist who originally formed the band, used to play rockabilly guitar for Gene Vincent and other big stars, and has been voted one of the greatest guitar players ever by Guitar Player magazine?
- X were playing Leadbelly tunes way before Kurt Cobain?
- Ray Manzarek, keyboard player of The Doors, produced X's first four albums? This is one of the big reasons why the band covered and generally closed its concerts with ""Soul Kitchen"" from the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Doors/dp/B000MCIBE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Doors</a>
- Cervenka and Doe used to be married, before Exene later married Viggo Mortensen -- Aragorn from the Lord of the Rings movies?
- Billy Zoom left the band from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, but during this time the band still managed to record&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Live-at-the-Whisky-a-Go-Go/dp/B000005IRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X Live at the Whisky a Go-Go</a>, one of the greatest live rock albums ever, with guitarist Tony Gilkyson?

As this DVD proves, X is still as good as ever. Billy Zoom still plays standing in his trademark splayed-leg stance with a broad grin on his face. Did I say he is awesome? Awesome.

I waited way too long before getting this one, thinking I could do without an X DVD. And I could have. But why should I? This really is worth it, and I'm sure I'll be putting this one in the player more often than a lot of my other music DVDs. Really, really good.",1291334400,5,2336,4.994858611825193
24,5,000503860X,"This is a fantastic video for anyone that is a fan of X or punk music. They sound as great as ever.
The DVD contains all the great songs. I look back fondly on the days when music was raw and real.",1282953600,,197,3.7142857142857144
25,5,000503860X,"For all you X fans out there-you will love this DVD -X are a great band live, and if they aren't coming to your town on their tour-this may be the next best thing to seeing them live!",1243987200,,183,3.8421052631578947
26,5,000503860X,"I got this DVD as an Xmas gift. I was very hesitant as I did not want to ruin the greatness I had in my vivid memory of X on the Sunset Strip back in the day. Needless to say my trepidation was unwarranted.

This DVD is awesome. It is edited well and they sound great. Billy Zoom has not lost anything and  Bonebrake is as good as ever. John Doe still can sing and has the great bass line, Exene sounds good as well, all though the years have not treated her well.

A must buy for any X fan. Now if the UCLA bruins football can return to the 1979-1984 form as well as X -all would be good.",1242345600,,589,3.8512396694214877
27,5,000503860X,"I've loved X since I first saw them here in San Francisco with, I believe, Devo and Romeo Void.  Romeo Void was a disaster due to the tiny outfit Deborah squeezed her huge body into; the audience couldn't stand to look at her even when the music was good. Devo was quite good. Then X came on stage and it was like hearing a great music system play compared to a tinny radio's sound. Man, they were great and they, unlike 99% of the other ""new wave/punk"" bands of the era were pros.  They had it down and played it up. I loved them! Watching this excellent reunion video (yes, Billy Zoom still has that same perpetual, inane smile on his face while playing), I was surprised to see very much the same show I saw all those years ago, with some extra songs that came out later, that is. The band's still electrifying. I'd like to see them ""live"" again, but until then, this video is the next best thing. It's well filmed and has a great selection of their best songs. Sure, they aren't as ""pretty"" as they used to be, but before you say too much, check your rearview mirror to see how you look now compared to 20 some odd years ago. Then, once humbled, go buy this CD. You will love it!",1192579200,,1183,4.20704845814978
28,5,000503860X,I think I saw X about 20 - 25 times from 1985 - 1995. They were always great and this brings back a lot of memories for me. They are a tight band that always sound great. I wish this had all of thier songs from that concert that is on the CD.,1186358400,2,242,3.5849056603773586
29,5,000503860X,"Being born in 1960 really ticked me off...Not old enough to really enjoy or not enjoy those carefree rock/roll, Dylanesque  years and awaiting my young adult years was the end of disco or the beginning of something in music called punk....Being a ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" landed me in the punk scene in the Bay Area...""Dead Kennedy's"" ""The Replacements"" and others were just either playing local clubs or being thrown into jail. Jello Biafra got married in a cemetary..Anywho, I was just shedding my Beatlemania and visiting nightclubs like DV8, One Step Beyond,181, Club X, Das Club, The Edge/Vortex, Face to Face, and Gotham City...I had seen ""X"" on New Year's night 1990 and being I was 30 decided this was my last year for dancing and clubbing...All the new wave/punk places were being torn down or remodeled for the next generation....That night I was blown away! Everyone in X had aged but still retained that youthful spirit and I tell ya it revitalized me! I danced all night long just like the old days....This DVD strangely enough revitilizes me again and had me tapping my feet, bobbing my head or singing along to ""We're Desperate"", ""White Girl"", ""Johnny Hit and Run Pauline""....It's definitely not a Beatles concert but the spirit and energy of the times will affect those of us growing up in those times and listening to that loud music....Geez, whatever happened to Dot Little? She's the one who asked me to be a punk with her! If you see her tell her I still love her!",1179619200,,1488,4.723076923076923
30,5,000503860X,"It just so happens that I was at this very show at the HOB in hollywood.  As a matter of fact, I can be seen in many of the shots of the crowd.  This show was nothing short of amazing.  After the show I was permitted to socialize with the band in the upstairs room.  Pretty cool for an old dude like myself.

If you know X, this is a must.  If you are young and new, it's a great place to get a taste of music history.

31,5,000503860X,"I recently saw X live in Atlanta, Georgia and was blown away with thier amazing performance, this DVD displays how they still have a passion for playing punk rock music. Good picture and sound, if you like X, buy this testament of punk history!!!",1140652800,2,246,4.613636363636363
32,5,000503860X,"I must admit I was hesitant to purchase this DVD. A classic punk band performing twenty plus years later, what could one expect? Apparently, one can expect a hell of a lot. These guys and gal can still tear their songs apart.

It's well filmed; there isn't that MTV, rapid editing that can cause seizures. The audio is excellent; you can actually understand the lyrics. It's well mixed. It's far superior to a lot of live performance DVD's currently released by some bands. X released a product that is worthy of ones money.

If you like X; you'll love this DVD. If you just appreciate a good rock/punk concert, you won't be disappointed.",1131408000,17,638,4.6371681415929205
7787747,5,000503860X,"Saw X live at the LA Dadafest Punk Prom and it was one of the great experiences of my life. The power and in-your-face nature was an experience and this video shows why. X was more than just another loud garage band. The deep rockabilly influences color their music with a rootsy intensity that recalls the very beginnings of rock and roll, tinged with East Hollywood grunge. LA was a great place for music in the late 70s-early 80s and X is probably the very best. They are still the best pure rock band I have ever seen. Also recommend John Doe's book Under The Big Black Sun for a look back at a crazy time.",1501891200,,610,4.267241379310345

7787751,4,000503860X,"At The House Of Blues no less. The band are so thight it squeaks, the performance is wild and inspired. It's as if 30 years hadn't elapsed; Billy zoom guitar's rockabilly-oriented  punk-rock performance is spot-on. The music just as I remembered it from the vinyl records. These old geezers put on a scorcher of a concert at a relentless pace; not a gazillion takes per second but just as fast as to make it dynamic enough. Loved the editing. They made magic with just 5 cameras. The dvd comes in a translucent box with a generous booklet plenty of pics and info. There are some interview snippets in between some songs,they don't detract form the flow or the excitement of the show at all and are welcome and candidly portray a brief story of the band.

Picture : Crystal-clear digital filming at an adequate 5.9 Mbps fixed pic ratio, in widescreen.

Sound : it smokes; good bottom end that starts a little weak but is corrected by the second or third song and gets louder as the show progresses. VERY aggressive midrange; if you want  a loud guitar you will have to put up with Exene's OTT vocals; she seems to have trouble with her monitoring at times. Drums are OK with a lot of kickdrum but I could have used more bite from the snare. Good if a bit overshadowed and trebley basswork somewhat drowned by the guitar. Little upper treble from the cymbals but still good enough. Billy's guitar appear to be a tad louder on the left channel despite being panned across the stereo soundscape, maybe to reinforce the visuals ( he stands by the left of the stage).

I found the extras merely anecdotical, consisting of two acoustic songs performed by Exene and Doe and a photo gallery of Billy's pics of the audience.

ANY fan of X will go crazy over this release, even a casual one like me. Clichd to say but a must have. It's X, it's brilliant, nuff said.",1394323200,,1854,4.486646884272997
7787752,5,000503860X,I have been a fan of X since about 1983 or so. I was lucky enough to see them in NYC around then. It was a great show ( Jason and the Scorchers opened for X that night). This concert vid shows that they can still bring it and deliver. Well shot and recorded. I was impressed by their performance. This show was done in 2004.,1359504000,,324,3.9242424242424243
7787753,3,000503860X,"We were somewhat disappointed in this video.  The talent is good, but there were interviews with various people cut in  between each song.  This made it seem chopped up and it was hard to get into the video, not to mention how distracting it was besides.  The cd had more fill in that seemed to be cut out of the vhs.  It would have been nice to have seen this truer to the way the concert was actually performed instead of just getting the singing.  Probably wouldn't have bought this if I'd known all this above purchasing.",1352419200,,525,4.360824742268041
7787754,5,000503860X,"It's like Henry Rollins said: ""X is one of the best live bands I've ever seen."" And here it is, a dvd with some of there best songs live! If you never got the chance to see X live, but always wanted to, this is a must. If you're an X fan, this is a must for your collection. I brought this dvd to Michigan for my niece to see and she fell in love with it, so I gave her my copy and bought another one for myself. There is not another band quite like X. John Doe in my opinion is one of the best American songwriters to come out of the late 1970's. His solo albums are excellent! And Billy Zoom is one of my favorite rock, punk and rockabilly guitarist. There's not too many instruments that this guy can't play. He's a real talented musician. I met him twice, and he's always fun to chat with. It's no wonder then as to why Ray Manzarek of The Doors went out of his way to produce X's first four albums. He knew they were something X-tra special.",1336521600,,946,3.9842105263157896
7787755,5,000503860X,"If you like X you will like the video-

All of their great songs.  This is a concert you don't want to miss- I think I got the video for 10.00 bucks-You can use some cash you saved to have a ""mini"" concert in your living room-make that your garage if you slam dance!",1296086400,,266,3.9074074074074074

My problem is once I turn this on I am locked, rocked, and unable to look away until it's over!  Having seen X a number of times, this DVD does a fabulous job of capturing the past decade of X shows.  TG they are coming to my town in a week!!!!  Highlights... as if there are Lowlights, HA!  White Girl, Los Angeles, Johnny Hit and Run Pauline, Your Phone's off the hook....., and Soul Kitchen",1292284800,,493,4.315217391304348
