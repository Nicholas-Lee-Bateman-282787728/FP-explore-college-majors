8423292,4,B004CNK588,"I first came to know of this movie from seeing clips of it on the documentary ""American Pimp"". They have it referenced on there as ""highway to hell"". Some of the clips of this movie that they show, aren't on the DVD? The movie was only about 1 hour long. Somewhat good movie but not too good. The part was missing where the main character says "" it ain't like the old days old timer, you see a fellow doesn't have to break a girl in anymore. There used to be a time when he'd have to get her nuts about him, maybe even promise to marry her. But then he'd lose his job or get sick awe there fowl excuses. Then maybe shed take a date with a friend till he could pay for the rent again, but he never did.""",1372550400,8,702,3.9507042253521125
