This tape brought back many memories of the 'glam metal' days of the 80's in SoCal. While I think the show was too short and was filled with a lol of non-musical nonsense, the feeling was there. Brought back many great memories of walking up and down the Sunset Strip hitting the clubs and seeing a lot of great 'hair' bands singing about having nothing but a good time. That's what it was all about back then: partying, having a great time with your friends and not worrying about anything else except the moment.

Cheers!!!",1167782400,3,571,4.480769230769231

It reminds me of the first movie KISS ever made, the 1978 TV film ""KISS Meets The Phantom Of The Park""- something really bad but also something really cool that would satisfy all fans of the band. Warrant's first home video,""Warrant:Live-Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich"" shows Warrant performing live and in concert, but anyone who purchased this video would be in for a bit of a surprise, because there is a plot based around this video. What is the plot? Warrant is playing a concert where they perform eight out of the ten songs off of the album that this video is supporting, while an angry fat guy who smokes cigars and has a big office named Black Guiderre (the cartoon character who was on the D.R.F.S.R. album cover, except this time the character is played by Warrant bassist Jerry Dixon)who hates Warrant and is trying to make sure their concert and the success the guys in Warrant (vocalist Jani Lane,Jerry Dixon, guitarists Erik Turner and Joey Allen, and drummer Steven Sweet)all gets ruined-and he wants to be responsible for ruining everything good that has come for Warrant. I won't give away too much of the plot, but the actual video is pretty cool, the only songs off of D.R.F.S.R. that Warrant did not perform live on this video are ""In The Sticks"" and ""Heaven"", and the songs that sound best performed live on this video are ""Cold Sweat"" (which sounds awesome when it is performed live)and ""Sometimes She Cries"", which sounded absolutely beautiful on this video. The live version of the title track on this video also sounds pretty cool when it is performed live. Another thing that is cool about this video is that if you have Warrant's sophomore album,1990's ""Cherry Pie"" and you remember Warrant's infamous ""Ode To Tipper Gore"" off of that album (which was about a minute of profanity and explicits clipped from some of Warrant's live concerts that was dedicated to Tipper Gore and all of those responsible for the Parental Advisory sticker)you will notice that two things Warrant vocalist Jani Lane says on this video during the performance appeared on that wonderful track (the Tipper Gore thing) that I admire Warrant so much for doing. The original studio video for ""Heaven"" and most of the original studio video for ""Down Boys"" are here also, along with a bonus interview with the original line-up of Warrant. My only complaints are that some of the chords in the ""Heaven"" music video are different then the chords that appeared on the original studio version for that song,the sound quality at the beginning of the video is a little bit weak(although it sounds much better in like five minutes or maybe even less than that), and the fact that the original video for ""Sometimes She Cries""was not included here, but other than those small flaws this is an excellent video. If you like Warrant,then don't forget to get a copy of this video. And before you buy it, make a careful purchase-it is now available on DVD! The End.",1115942400,5,3079,4.746268656716418
