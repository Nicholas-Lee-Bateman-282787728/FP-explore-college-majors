6081039,5,B00GLMOEUI,"Magnificent, and historically pretty accurate, serial about that legendary Queen Isabel of Spain who succeeded in freeing Spain from the seven-centuries Islamic dominance of the Iberia peninsula and in reuniting the many kingdoms therein into one Spain.
The incredible  accomplishments of this bigger-than-life queen are presented in this serial in lush and eye-popping manner that represents the best that TV production can offer..... even topping the famed BBC productions.
Alas, the serial is entirely in Spanish (with Spanish subtitles, to be sure, but no other).
But for those who can understand the language of Cervantes this serial will be a banquet of visual and dramatic delights.",1392681600,10,689,5.5

8624274,1,B00GLMOEUI,"I could not view the DVD because it was formatted for PAL, not NTSC. These are Region 2 discs, not Region 1. The content itself is not reflected in this review, as the program itself is quite good in my opinion.",1420761600,,211,4.170731707317073
