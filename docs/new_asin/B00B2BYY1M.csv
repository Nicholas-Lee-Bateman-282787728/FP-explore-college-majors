5553049,5,B00B2BYY1M,"I saw The Suitor 50 years ago, and was delighted with the beauty of the film, a series of carefully crafted images that told a simple story with a quiet surface but great underlying emotion.  Etaix managed an uneasy balancing act of telling a comedic story without making his protagonist a clown.

Now, with the re-release of all his films, I find that Etaix was literally a clown at one time, and brought that background to film.  So far, I've watched The Suitor, Yoyo (in which Etaix' background is a major aspect of the plot - a rich kid who runs off to join the circus) and two highly inventive short films.  All are beautifully filmed on low budgets, but the Blu-Ray restoration helps show the highly polished works that they are.

I would recommend these films to anyone who enjoys Jacques Tati (Etaix's mentor) or Bill Forsyth movies.  They are in that quiet spirit, but evoke hearty laughter.",1369958400,7,900,4.628930817610063
5553050,5,B00B2BYY1M,"it's easy to see the symbiotic connection between Jerry Lewis and Pierre Etaix, a renown actor, clown and film director. If you've ever wondered why Lewis is so revered in France, the work of this iconic French filmmaker will explain all. Not as juvenile as Lewis, Etaix is more lost man, than man-child. These films have long been unavailable and this new collection is a must for fans of this unique genre of comedy.",1369180800,2,418,4.662162162162162
5553051,5,B00B2BYY1M,"A previous reviewer heaped praise on Criterion for ""remastering and releasing"" Etaix's films to the public. I don't disagree with that sentiment, though it should be limited to releasing the films to the US public. Criterion isn't in the job of remastering, and this was done for the Etaix films by Etaix himself in 2010, with financial support from the Groupama Gan Foundation, and Technicolor Foundation for Cinema Heritage. We have these versions here, with new subtitles and various features.

Again, this isn't to slight Criterion. If it wasn't for them, it's difficult to think of another publisher that would purchase the US rights to these films. Praise all around, then.",1369094400,20,679,5.117117117117117

5553054,5,B00B2BYY1M,"Criterion has done it again...I want to personally thank Criterion for taking the time and effort to remastering and releasing the films of Pierre Etaix to the public.  Like his mentor Jacques Tati, Etaix is a comic genius whose humor is rooted in the classic comedians of the silent era (Buster Keaton, Chaplin, Harold Lloyd).  Also like these comedians, Etaix uses humor to comment upon modern society (or what was considered modern at the time he was working).  My personal favorite film out of this collection is Le Grand Amour, which takes the cinema trope of the troubled marriage, and brings it to a brilliantly surreal level.  This is, without a doubt, the blu-ray release of the year!",1367539200,14,693,4.8474576271186445

8561362,5,B00B2BYY1M,"These films are gentle fun.  If you like Buster Keaton or Jacques Tati, these will be right up your alley.  They are often wordless or nearly wordless, offering remarkable comic slices of life in France in the early 1960s.  Where the offerings of the New Wave are challenging or even frenetic, these films are meditative and rather elegiac in sensibility.  So, you get stories of a man who destroys his apartment accidentally because his pen doesn't work, or who has to run errands before he can get home to his anniversary dinner with his wife but Paris traffic conspires to detain him until his wife has given up in despair and finished the wine for the dinner.  They are beautifully performed and well plotted, but they are not necessarily laugh out loud comedies.  The pleasure, as with Keaton, is trying to see how the gag will be worked out and discovering that it can be elaborated beyond your wildest dreams.",1497312000,,916,4.69375
8561363,5,B00B2BYY1M,"Pierre Etaix has worn many hats during his long show-business career. He has been a mime, a circus performer, cabaret artist, screenwriter, filmmaker, instructor and more. Born in Roanne, France, Etaix started out as a painter. He began in film as a production assistant in 1949, and during the late 1950s he became a joke-writer for Jacques Tati. In 1959, Etaix appeared as an actor in Bresson's Pickpocket. In the early 1960s, he began working in music halls, clubs and on television with Nino the clown. He also launched his filmmaking career with two short comedy films made in conjunction with Jean-Claude Carriere. One of those films, Heureux Anniversaire, won an Oscar. He began appearing in feature comedies in 1962 and he has starred in every film he has directed. taix's signature on a disastrous distribution contract cast his films into oblivion, but 56,000 more, including those of Jean-Luc Godard, David Lynch and Woody Allen, on a petition in 2009, have rescued them for posterity. Here is the collection of 5 features and 3 shorts available restored for the 1st time. Enjoy this subtle, sly comedian of silent and sound slapstick.

A French comedy master whose films went unseen for decades as a result of legal tangles, director-actor Pierre Etaix is a treasure the cinematic world has rediscovered and embraced with relish. His work can be placed on the spectrum of classic physical comedy with that of Jacques Tati and Jerry Lewis, but it also stands alone in its good- natured delicacy. These films, influenced by Etaixs experiences as a circus acrobat and clown and by the silent film comedies he adored, are elegantly deadpan, but as an on-screen presence, Etaix radiates warmth. This collection includes all of his films, five features, The Suitor,Yoyo, As Long as Youve Got Your Health, Le grand amour, and Land of Milk and Honeymost of them collaborations with the great screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrireand three shorts, Rupture, the Oscar-winning Happy Anniversary, and Feeling Good. Not one of these is anything less than a bracing and witty delight.

Some of the best French slapstick comedy not coming from Monsieur Tati. Mr Etaixs films are superbly witty and endearing with amazing physical stunts and gags. Yoyo one of his main features has themes similar to The Artist. Lets not forget that, with the absence of new features from Jacques Tati between 1958 (Mon Oncle) and 1967 (Playtime), Etaix and Jerry Lewis were the most visible total-filmmaker-comics internationally. He proved with his 1st films, Happy Anniversary and The Suitor, a personal comic film flair. Variety said in 1969: Pierre Etaix is one of the few comic author-director-actor film-makers practicing today. Chaplin,Lloyd, Laurel and Hardy and Keaton, of the silent era were all his forbears. He loved Keaton , after seeing showings of his films in 1962.

 He joined Tati in 1954 as a gag writer, assistant director, storyboardist, go-fer and unaccredited player for Tatis Mon Oncle (France, 1958). He then worked as a comic and clown in his own right. Both had similar careers- music hall and circus to film shorts to features, with a return to live performance. He met Jerry Lewis in Paris 1965, after Lewis had seen Yoyo. Lewis declared the man a genius. He had a part as a pick-pocket in Bressons Pickpocket. He did this to see how Bresson worked as a director. He found a partner in fledgling screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrire and become fast friends, finding they liked the same classic screen comics, especially from Hollywoods early comedy golden age, and both had even prepared scripts and film exercises.

They did Rupture and Happy Anniversary in 1961. Then they went on to do four comedy features co-scripted by Carrire and Etaix, who solo-directed and starred in the films. His films sketch the frustration of men lodged indecisively between the inward restlessness of thought (the realm of desire, and of one-liners) and the outward restlessness of an uncooperative physical world (the realm of action, and of slapstick). One of his best works is Le Grand Amour. Keaton In 7 Chances seems to be his inpiration. He has doubts about his wife on their wedding day, but they marry, and hes absorbed into the routine of the family firm.

A new secretary knocks him for six, and at night time his bed floats out of the house and motors down the street, traversing country roads and other beds in transit. Surrealistic encounters take off from the characters subconscious, all action springs from his passive immobility, he just lies back and enjoys the ride. His masterpiece was Yoyo,after Fellinis 8 and a half. Where a bored rich man lives a decadent life, decides to join his lover and their son in a circus after the stock market crash. The 1st half is shot as a silent film, the 2nd part follows the grown son(played by Etaix) as he becomes a famous clown(Yoyo) and he enters a Felliniesque world of European high society. Having fought a 10 year court battle over the distribution rights of his films, he and the world can see them now restored while he is still alive. Enjoy!",1475366400,,5091,4.941588785046729
8561364,5,B00B2BYY1M,"The words ""French pantomime artist"" can strike terror into anyone's heart, but the eight movies (five features and three shorts) in this collection are still worth watching. The influence of Jerry Lewis and Jacques Tati on Pierre Etaix is inescapable, but Etaix's character -- not as juvenile as Lewis's, not as sentimental as Tati's -- would happily settle into bourgeois society if he could, but the material world and the people in it simply won't let him. The character is a misfit existing on the fringes of consensus reality.

The movies are wry as hell, and in ""Yoyo,"" Etaix attempts a slapstick mash-up of silent comedy and Fellini-inspired autobiographical fantasy -- not a winning combination. I'm glad that the films have been rescued from legal limbo, and that we can finally enjoy what this interesting minor filmmaker accomplished in his one-decade directorial career.",1438214400,,882,5.1678321678321675

8561368,5,B00B2BYY1M,"The only thing worse than a filmmaker not be taken seriously by critics or moviegoers is a filmmaker generally ignored by both. Critics hate Michael Bay, but at least he's well-known, and Douglas Sirk is scoffed at by the moviegoers, but at least he's respected in the academia. Pierre Etaix is another story: he was virtually ignored by even the most sophisticated film critics and he was on the verge of being forgotten by the most strident of movie lovers. This was mostly because of a bitter legal nightmare, which prevented his movies from being widely available in America for over a couple of decades. It also didn't help that his movies had yet to be restored and thus looked every bit as blemished as most of the unprotected comedy shorts of the silent era. But after a long legal battle, it is finally over. Pierre Etaix's movies are not only available in this fantastic Criterion box set; they are available in pristine visual and audio quality. As an added bonus, Etaix's feature-length movies are accompanied with all his short films. Beautifully restored and packaged, the films of Pierre Etaix have never looked this good since their release in the 60s.

I didn't hear about Pierre Etaix, until I read that his work had been compared to Jacques Tati and Buster Keaton. Since I am a fan of both filmmakers and since I heard that Etaix was an influence on the likes of David Lynch, Terry Gilliam and Woody Allen, I looked into it. I must confess, I was hesitant to buy the Criterion box set since I did not want to spend my job money on something that had the potential to disappoint me. But once I finished watching ""The Suitor"", my qualms were erased. Then when I saw ""Yoyo"" and ""Milk and Honey"", I was in a state of elation. In the end, I couldn't be any happier to spend $40.

Critics have compared Pierre Etaix to Keaton and Tati, which is an appropriate comparison, but I would also add that his work blends the free-form anarchy of the Marx Brothers, the political subtexts of Rene Clair comedies, the surrealistic imagery of silent Bunuel and the circus-like atmosphere of early Fellini. Telling you this would make you feel this his work is artsy-fartsy nonsense, but nothing could be further from the truth. Even if you don't like French comedies, you'll love this box set. All the movies and shorts are absolutely fantastic - superbly directed, riotously funny and subversively witty. Even experimental movies like ""Land of Milk and Honey"" (a documentary feature that plays like a darker ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" and thus outraged many critics) and the four-part ""As Long as You've Got Health"" have the charms that have sadly disperse in today's comedy world. As a result, the laughs are plentiful at first viewing, but the rewards become great in second or third.

Besides the outstanding digital transfers, the box set comes with a healthy supply of bonus features that does the director justice. Each of the films are accompanied by an introduction of Pierre Etaix, who comes across as a warm, modest but insightful person. And there's also an enjoyable one-hour documentary on the director that's located on the first Blu-Ray disc.

As I stated before, I didn't want to purchase this box set, but I'm glad I did. And with a Jacques Tati box set rumored to be released this year, it's safe to say that I'll be in comedy heaven very, very shortly. Pierre Etaix was cruelly ignored these past few years, but now his movies are given newer life, thanks to Criterion. Etaix is a comedy genius to rival Chaplin, Keaton, Hardy and Tati, and now his work is available for everyone to see. For comedians and comedy filmmakers alike, this box set is pure nirvana.

Strongest recommendation to buy (and steal) at all costs.",1393286400,3,3737,4.725460122699387

Pierre Etaix has a deadpan comedy style much like Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd.  Some of his film, like The Suitor, could easily have been silent films.  The set includes all of Etaix's films, including his last, a documentary about the French during summer vacations.  It was this film that so outraged the French that Etaix was never able to make another film in France.  He meant it as a comedy, but the French thought he was making fun of them.  One of the long films, The Great Love (Le Grand Amour) starred his wife at the time as his wife.  The film Yoyo takes place over decades, with Etaix playing both father and son depending upon the decade.  In the years before 1928, the film is silent.

8561371,5,B00B2BYY1M,"Filmmaker Jacques Tati has inspired many people throughout his lifetime.  And for one comedian, actor and filmmaker, Pierre Etaix, is a man who had the opportunity to work with Tati but also alongside international talent such as Robert Bresson, Nagisa Oshima, Otar Iosseliani and Jerry Lewis.

Best known for his short and feature films from the 1960s, you would think that Pierre Etaix, an Academy Award winner, would be a well-known name to cinema fans worldwide.  But unfortunately, his films would be unavailable for decades due to a legal dispute with a distribution company.

But now Pierre Etaix's films will be released on Blu-ray and DVD for the first time in America courtesy of the Criterion Collection.

""Pierre Etaix - The Criterion Collection #655 comes with digitally restored short films ""Rupture"" (1961) about an illustrator having a difficult time at work and ""Happy Anniversary"" (""Heureux Anniversaire"", 1962), a short story about a wife preparing an anniversary meal for her husband but unfortunately, he is caught up in automobile and traffic situations and not sure if he can make it home in time.  The short won an Academy Award in 1963 for ""Best Short Subject"" and a 1964 BAFTA Award for ""Best Short Film"".

The collection also includes his first feature film ""The Suitor"" (Le Soupirant), a film which was originally conceived as several shorts, but Etaix was told to create a feature film in which he did.

""The Suitor"" features Etaix and writer Jean-Claude Carriere doing a homage to Laurel & Hardy in which a man (portrayed by Pierre Etaix) just wants to study astrology but because he lives with his parents, he is  trying to fulfill his parents wishes of finding a woman to love and marry, but finding a woman is not as easy as he is not sure what it takes to meet a woman.  While he manages to attract Laurence, a woman who lives next door, he becomes obsessed with a singer named Stella on television.

""Yo Yo"" was a film created by Pierre Etaix during a difficult time in his life after his father was killed in road accident.  Inspired by Federico Fellini's ""8 1/2, Etaix was excited about the possibility of doing something different but with slapstick. Together with Jean-Claude Carriere, the two were able to create a film that would incorporate their love of silent cinema but from its main protagonist but with sound from everyone and everything else.

The film is about a millionaire who has everything... a palace, material things, musicians, dancers but he doesn't have love.  He often looks at a photo of a pretty woman of his past.

One day while attending the circus, he sees the woman on a white horse and we learn that the millionaire had a relationship with the woman and that she gave birth to his child named Yo Yo ten years ago.  Both she and the child were raised in the circus lifestyle but when he marries the woman and both live with him in the chateau.  For Yo Yo, to live in such luxury and a place that he loves becomes a big part of him.  Fast forward and Yo-Yo has went from acrobat to a clown.  But due to war, he is drafted into the military and when he gets out, he realizes that life has changed.

He returns to the chateau which has not been taken care of and so Yo Yo dedicates his life to working as a filmmaker and businessman to acquire wealth to keep up the place.  But while doing so, he may have run into the same situations as his father, having the wealthy and focusing so much on material things, he may have let love pass him by.

For the next film titled ""Tant qu'on a la sant&eacute;"" (As Long As You've Got Your Health), unfortunately with ""Yo Yo"" not doing well in the box office, producer's limited Etaix's budget for his latest film.  Etaix has said that this film, he wished he had the budget to put certain things he wanted in the film but producers were adamant against it.  So, having to use friends as extras and previous staff to make this film happen, Pierre went to work on ""As Long As You've Got Your Health"" which is a film divided into four parts.

The first part ""I - L'insomnie"" revolves around a man (portrayed by Pierre Etaix) who is having a hard time sleeping, so he picks up a vampire book and starts to get spooked out by it.  While his wife is sleeping right next to him, as he reads, the audience watches the story unfold as a man tries to save a woman from Dracula.  But unknown to the man, his wife has a secret.

The second part is ""Le cin&eacute;matographe"" and shows a man (portrayed by Pierre Etaix), who goes to the movies to enjoy a western.  But he quickly learns that watching a film in a crowded cinema can be quite difficult.  Meanwhile, during the movie break, audiences at the theater are treated by the latest in absurd commercialism.

The third part is titled ""Tant qu'on a la sant&eacute;"" and is about how life can be very busy for people in today's world.  From the sound of one with a jackhammer and making so much noise that it disrupts peoples lives, people trying to smile as they are stuck in traffic or have some type of problems in their life, to the fast walking crowds of people going to working or leaving work and as everyone goes to the psychiatrist to help them out with stress, they also must suffer from stress.

And the final fourth part is titled ""Nous n'irons plus au bois"" and is set in a countryside.  A man goes out to hunt, a couple goes to the countryside for a picnic and a farmer sets a wire fence to keep people out of his property.  But what happens when the hunter and the couple start to go through the wired fence?

For ""En pleine forme"" (""Feeling Good""), the short was intended to be part of ""As Long As You've Got Your Health"" but was replaced by ""I - L'insomnie"".  While created in 1966, the short was seen for the first time through the 2010 restoration of Pierre Etaix's films.  The short is about a man who goes out to the country to get away from real life and go camping.  But he's not an outdoorsman and tries his best to go camping.  He immediately is ushered to an area of campers, but while everyone has their own campsite in an enclosed area, they live as if they are living like their real life and not enjoying nature.

With the success of ""As Long As You've Got Your Health"", the opportunity to make a bigger film came.  And this time around, Pierre Etaix requested for a color film to be made but also with a larger budget, which the producers of the film agreed.

And so the film that Pierre would go on to make was titled ""Le Grand Amour"", made in 1969 and would star Annie Fratellini (Pierre's real-life wife and also onscreen) an actress Nicole Calfan.

The film revolves around Pierre (portrayed by Pierre Etaix), a man who is the boss of an industrial business and married to the owner's daughter Florence (portrayed by Annie Fratellini).  Pierre begins the film talking about the woman he was friends with and how he met and married Florence.  While their relationship is strong, the gossiping women around the area start talking false gossip about Pierre, who is seen saying hello to a woman walking down the street.  When a woman tells another woman, the scene is exaggerated to the point that it makes it seem that Pierre has had an affair.  The miscommunication leads to Florence leaving him for a few hours, but not knowing why his wife would leave, his friend Jacques (portrayed by Alain Janey) tells him that he should have married a much younger woman, so these problems wouldn't happen.

But as Pierre and Florence are able to patch things up in their marriage, a beautiful young woman named Agnes (portrayed by Nicole Calfan) has been hired to replace the longtime secretary who is leaving the company.  Immediately, Pierre begins to fantasize about her everyday and becomes so obsessed with her to the point that he starts to avoid his wife, starts to collect fallen hair left behind by Agnes and has dreams of him sleeping with her.

And now Pierre starts to wonder if he wants to stay married with Agnes or go after his secretary.

The final film featured is a documentary titled ""Land of Milk and Honey"" (""Pays de Cocagne"") and it's a film that is considered by Pierre Etaix to be his most important film.  It's also a film that destroyed his filmmaking career to the point that Etaix would not direct another film for nearly 16 years.

The documentary was shot during the summer of '68 as his wife Annie Fratellini was a singer and wanted to take part in the Europe 1 sponsored music stage which was traveling throughout France.  For Pierre, wanting to support his wife, he figured he would shoot his travel and find something interesting during his trip.  And when he saw the advertising and the people that turned out for the Tour de France, Etaix was captivated by the many people at the event, campgrounds and at the beach.

But while traveling, he also learned that the people involved in the traveling music stage were amateurs who couldn't sing that well, but in their head, consider themselves great singers who want to make a major career of music.  So, with so many ideas, Pierre decide to interview people from topics about the man on the moon, the power of advertising, eroticism, marriage and more.

But the film became an experimental film because he wanted to create a comedy, but since there was no script, all he could do is edit the film and make it fun.  In the process, critics and viewers thought the film was mocking society and after 10 days in the theater, the bad press led the film to be pulled out and destroying Pierre Etaix's credibility as a filmmaker with no one in France wanting to work with the filmmaker ever again (until 1987).

VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

The shorts and feature films by Pierre Etaix is presented in 1080p High Definition for the very first time.  Considering that the film has not been available on video due to legal issues that prevented the distribution of Pierre Etaix's films, audiences are getting the opportunity to seeing Pierre's films in the best picture quality possible.

The first shorts and feature films which include ""Rupture"", ""Happy Anniversary"", ""The Suitor"", ""Yoyo"", ""As Long As You've Got Your Health"" and ""Feeling Good"" are presented in black and white (some acts in ""As Long As You've Got Your Health"" are presented in color or sepia).  For these earlier films, the film looks very good for its age and very clean.  I didn't see any warping, damage or major flickering.  Picture quality was very good for these films.  Black levels were nice and deep while white and grays were well-contrast.

As for ""Le Grand Amour"" and ""Land of Milk and Honey"", these two films look very good.  With ""Le Grand Amour"", there may be one scene in which Pierre visits his wife's family, where the film does show its age, but other than that, the color on these two films look fantastic and the film was definitely well-preserved. Also, no problems of discoloration, colors are vibrant and picture quality for the two color films look very good!

As for the monaural lossless audio, French dialogue is crystal clear, as with the music. I detected no major hissing, crackle or pops during my viewing of the film.

According to the Criterion Collection, thew new digital masters were made from 2010 restorations undertaken by Studio 17, The Technicolor Foundation for Cinema Heritage and the Groupama Gan Foundation for Cinema, under the supervision of director Pierre Etaix.

For the restorations of ""Rupture"", ""Happy Anniversary"", ""Feeling Good"" and the Suitor, the transfers were created in high-definition on a Spirit Datacine from the original 35 mm camera negatives and the sound was restored from the original track negative.  The transfer of ""Yoyo"" was created in high-definition on a Spirit Datacine from a wet-gate printed 35 mm duplicate negative, and the sound was restored from the optical track negative.  For ""As Long as You've Got Your Health"", the transfer was created in high-definition on  a Spirit Datacine from the original 35 mm camera negative and a 35 mm duplicate negative and the sound was restored from the optical track negative.  The transfer of ""Le Grand amour"" was created in 2K restoration on an ARRISCAN film scanner from the original 35 mm camera negative and two-reels of wet-gate interpositive, and the sound was restored from the 35 mm magnetic tracks.  And for ""Land of Milk and Honey"", the transfer was created in high definition on a Spirit Datacine from a 35 mm blow-up internegative made from the 16 mm reversal, while the sound was restored from the optical track negative.

Subtitles are presented in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

The collection of shorts and films from The Criterion Collection's Blu-ray release of ""Pierre Etaix"" is entertaining but also a glimpse of a man who lived his life as a clown but pursued filmmaking and wanted to make people laugh despite not having a massive budget like other French filmmakers.

Inspired by legendary filmmaker and famous comic actor Jacques Tati who captured audiences with his character Monsieur Hulot, Pierre Etaix used his character of Pierre (different characters on each film) and wanted to make his film comedies based on vaudeville and also incorporate silent film style comedy, with few words spoken but everything is visual and humorous.

Featuring films with unusual sound effects played during certain moments of a short or feature film, the goal by Etaix was to create entertainment visually.  As clown who used visual jokes to make people laugh, Etaix felt he could do the same on a bigger scale through cinema.

While not a big name thanks to legal issues that prevented his films from being released, the Blu-ray release of ""Pierre Etaix"" will entertain audiences with its comedy but also films from the '60s that are now being released in HD for the very first time.  And for some, this is probably the first time they have seen the film since its release in theaters back in the '60s.

""Rupture"" has the comedy style of silent films in which a character tries to get work done but for each time he tries, he always ends up doing something so ridiculous that it effects his work.  In ""Happy Anniversary"", the story is straightforward about a couple trying to celebrate their anniversary, but due to traffic and other circumstances, the husband (or boyfriend) must do all he can to get back home in time.

By the time you get to ""The Suitor"", there are some remnants of a Buster Keaton style, as one man of a wealthy family tries to explore the world and discover if he can find a woman (who will possibly be his wife), but how is a man with no experience with women, find the woman that wants to be with him?

In ""Yoyo"", the film is entertaining from its many locations to its cinematography and 1920s dance choreography.  The storyline was not the greatest, but I found the film to be entertaining and fascinating as it deals with two men who find out late in their lives that love is more important that financial objects.

For the film ""As Long As You've Got Your Health"", the film is quite accessible for viewers thanks to it being divided into four parts.  And each film has its own charm.  Possibly my favorite part revolves around how cinemas were packed at that time and how badly people would go to find a seat but how people could be rude during ones movie viewing.  So, this part alone should connect with today's modern viewers.  You also get the extra short titled ""Feeling Good"" which was originally supposed to be the first feature of ""As Long As You've Got Your Health"", but Etaix chose to use the vampire segments instead.

The best film in the set is ""Le Grand Amour"".  Definitely a relevant film about a man's midlife crisis and wanting to see if he can attract the opposite sex but to also have feelings towards a younger, beautiful woman.  But would this man risk his marriage for this secretary?  The acting was top notch and the production for this film was much better than Etaix's previous films.

And the final film ""Land of Milk and Honey"" is truly an experimental film which included clever editing but was able to take something mundane and make it entertaining with the field of questions that relate from an era that is no longer.  The film goes to show about how much risk Etaix was willing to take but while trying to use hours of film to make a film, using that as a visual script to edit and make a comedy.  It didn't work during that time and the film was despised by many during that time, viewers today will probably see it more audacious and experimental than being critical of French society.

The set comes with an introduction by Pierre Etaix, who discusses each of his feature films and  also a documentary put together by his wife Odile Etaix, which was also entertaining and informative.  But giving us a chance to gain some insight of Pierre Etaix's work.

Overall, ""Pierre Etaix - The Criterion Collection #655 is an entertaining and enjoyable French comedy shorts/film set featuring the work of filmmaker/actor Pierre Etaix.  From his early shorts to his feature films covering the 1960s, each of the shorts and films presented in this set look fantastic thanks to its 2010 restoration by Studio 17, The Technicolor Foundation for Cinema Heritage and the Groupama Gan Foundation for Cinema, under the supervision of director Pierre Etaix.  For those who enjoy silent cinema or comedy (especially early French comedy) that is more visual than dialogue-driven, will find ""Pierre Etaix - The Criterion Collection #655 to be a set worth owning!

Highly recommended!",1372896000,5,18252,4.680451127819549
