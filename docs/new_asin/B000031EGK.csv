7916451,4,B000031EGK,"""The LBJ Tapes: Volume 1"" (subtitled ""Hello, Mr. President"") is the first in a four-part documentary series that features many of the White House telephone conversations that were secretly recorded by the 36th U.S. President, Lyndon B. Johnson.

This first 50-minute volume in the series contains snippets of several phone calls made by LBJ during his first days as President, following the assassination of his predecessor, John F. Kennedy, in late 1963.

Re.: LBJ, J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI, and the assassination of President Kennedy......

President Johnson was told several incorrect things in the days that immediately followed the murder of JFK. Such as when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover (for some reason) told Johnson that the ""Stretcher Bullet"" connected to JFK's murder was found on KENNEDY'S stretcher....when, in fact, that was impossible, since JFK's stretcher was never in the area of Parkland Hospital where that bullet (""CE399"") was found by hospital employee Darrell Tomlinson.

In the taped telephone conversations between Hoover and LBJ shortly after the 11/22/63 assassination of JFK (which are tape recordings that have been made available via various means, including some of them being placed on VHS video, DVD, and on Audio-CD as well), several other errors can also be detected, including Hoover telling LBJ that the shots from the Texas School Book Depository Building had come from the ""fifth"" floor, instead of the sixth.

Hoover's FBI took control of most of the physical evidence in the JFK murder investigation late on the night of November 22nd....taking it out of the hands of the Dallas Police Department, which is the organization that collected virtually all of the physical evidence in the case -- which is evidence that all points to Lee Harvey Oswald as the one and only killer of President Kennedy and policeman J.D. Tippit.

In hindsight, it would have been nice if Hoover's boys could have found a way to transfer Oswald himself back to Washington, too, along with LHO's rifle, the bullet fragments in the car, the President's car itself, the bullet shells from the Book Depository, and all the rest of that mile-high mountain of stuff that proves it was Lee Oswald who killed President Kennedy that day in Dallas.

But the assassin himself remained in Dallas during that dark weekend in '63....with the tragic result being: a dead Mr. Oswald two days later, thanks to a well-aimed bullet fired from the gun of Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby.

Upon listening to the November 29, 1963, taped phone call between J. Edgar Hoover and President Lyndon Johnson (which was a 20-minute-long call that took place on the very same day that LBJ created the Warren Commission panel), a decent-sized number of significant errors crop up as Mr. Hoover is relaying what he says are the facts surrounding various elements of the JFK assassination which had taken place exactly one week earlier.

Allow me now to examine that 11/29/63 phone call and point out some of the obvious mistakes uttered by Mr. Hoover -- mistakes that were later corrected by the WC during that Commission's nearly ten-month probe into the events of November 22. (The text wrapped in quotation marks are the verbatim words spoken by FBI Director Hoover and by President Johnson on 11/29/63.).......

~~~~~~

LBJ -- ""How many shots were fired?""

JEH -- ""Three.""

LBJ -- ""Any of 'em fired at me?""

JEH -- ""No.""

LBJ -- ""All three at the President?""

JEH -- ""All three at the President....and we have them.""

~~~~~~

I'm surprised more conspiracy theorists don't do more hollering about the above obviously-erroneous statement made by Mr. Hoover, wherein he claims that the FBI had in its possession ALL THREE of the rifle bullets fired by Oswald's Carcano rifle during the Presidential shooting.

When, of course, in reality, only two of the three bullets were recovered, because one of the shots (as later determined by the WC) missed the car entirely and was unrecoverable.

It seems fairly obvious that Mr. Hoover (as of 11/29/63) was under the impression that the two bullet fragments found in the front seat of JFK's car represented the remains of two separate bullets.

Later detailed examination, however, would determine that the two front-seat fragments were almost certainly portions of just one single bullet, not two. (With one of the front-seat fragments being a ""nose"" section of a bullet; while the other fragment was the ""base"" portion of a FMJ 6.5-mm. MC/WCC missile.)

~~~~~~

JEH -- ""He {JFK} was hit by the first and the third {shots}. The second shot hit the Governor. The third shot is a complete bullet, and wasn't shattered; and that rolled out of the President's head, and tore a large part of the President's head off. And in trying to massage his heart at the hospital, they apparently loosened that, and it fell onto the stretcher.""

~~~~~~

The above paragraph uttered by Mr. Hoover is simply amazing -- amazing, that is, in terms of the number of errors contained in that paragraph.

To say that the THIRD shot (which was the JFK ""head shot"") was the ""complete bullet"" (which would be CE399, the Stretcher Bullet), and that it ""rolled out of the President's head"" in a whole, nearly-undamaged condition, is utterly crazy.

In that conversation with President Johnson, Mr. Hoover had his bullets mixed up, to say the least.

~~~~~~

JEH -- ""Those three shots were fired within three seconds.""

~~~~~~

The above is yet another error-filled statement spoken by Mr. Hoover. Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano rifle was unable to fire three shots ""within three seconds"". That, in fact, is an absurd comment by Hoover....and I haven't the foggiest of notions where he arrived at such a conclusion.

Per the WC test firings, Oswald's rifle had a minimum mechanical firing time of 2.295 seconds between EACH shot (and that doesn't count any aim time; it only includes the time required to work the bolt and squeeze the trigger again).

But the Zapruder Film of the entire assassination proves beyond very much doubt at all (at least I have no doubts) that one gunman most certainly fired all the shots that resulted in each of the two victims' wounds -- with the entire shooting timeline taking approx. 8.2 seconds from start to finish, with ample space between the three shots for Oswald to work the bolt on his rifle and to aim and fire again.

Of course, Hoover was talking to LBJ just a week after the awful shooting in Dallas, which I suppose resulted in some of these errors in judgment on Mr. Hoover's behalf. But the ""3 shots within 3 seconds from LHO's rifle"" business is just simply crazy (and impossible).

And here's another very strange Hoover statement from that same November 29th phone call......

~~~~~~

LBJ -- ""If Connally hadn't been in his way...""

JEH -- ""Oh yes....yes. The President no doubt would have been hit {a third time}.""

LBJ -- ""He {JFK} would have been hit three times.""

JEH -- ""He would have been hit three times.""

~~~~~~

Now, yes, it was a mere seven days after JFK's terrible murder, and a lot of facts had not yet been researched and verified concerning the full events in Dallas -- but the above quote from the FBI head man is just absolutely nutty.

Because even by November 29th, it was surely common FBI knowledge as to WHERE on Elm Street the shooting began and ended. Via photos, films, and witness accounts, it was very obvious that the ENTIRE shooting occurred while both JFK and John Connally had their backs to the assassin. And JFK was sitting behind Connally in the limousine. Which means that at no time was Connally blocking Oswald's view of President Kennedy.

And yet Hoover misinforms Johnson with these words: ""He would have been hit three times"" had Connally not been ""in the way"".

Just....amazing. I think even long-time conspiracy advocates would agree with me that the above quote from J. Edgar can't really be taken as a ""shady"" or ""conspiratorial"" comment in any fashion (even though many conspiracists do, indeed, firmly believe that Mr. Hoover was a rotten liar and started covering up the true facts in the JFK case from the get-go) -- but the above comment about the victims' positions in the car relative to the gunman (Oswald) is just plain ignorance on the part of the FBI Director. How can it be anything else? It's just flat-out wrong....even, as I said, if you're a conspiracy theorist.

And, of course, Hoover's agency got the shooting scenario all fouled up as well, as we all know....when the FBI said that each of Oswald's three shots resulted in a ""hit"" to one of the victims. Hoover's men came to this ""3 Hits"" conclusion even though they should have known full well that such a three-hits scenario was utterly impossible just by glancing at the Autopsy Report (which states that a bullet came out of JFK's throat).

Unless the FBI did no checking at all with respect to Robert Frazier's detailed study of the limousine on the night of 11/22 (which was a limo examination that was performed by one of their OWN FBI AGENTS, which verified the fact that the bullet that exited JFK's throat did NOT hit the limousine and did not cause any limo damage whatsoever) -- the Bureau SHOULD have been able to put 2 and 2 together before even submitting its December 9, 1963, report to the Warren Commission ---

i.e.:

The FBI investigators should have been able to conclude that bullets rarely, if ever, vanish into thin air after entering a vehicle on a 17-degree downward trajectory from a 60-foot-high source, and that the JFK ""SBT"" back-thru-throat bullet HAD to have gone into the man sitting directly in front of the President in the limousine (John B. Connally).

I've long wondered why the Federal Bureau of Investigation itself didn't propose the Single-Bullet Theory to account for the double-man wounding of President Kennedy and Governor Connally. They should probably have done so, in my opinion.

Because -- Given the lack of limo damage to the back-seat and jump-seat areas of the car....plus the Autopsy Report verifying the fact that a whole bullet came out of Kennedy's neck on a downward angle from a 6th-Floor window and went SOMEPLACE....and knowing the location where Connally was injured on his back -- how is ANY other solution even possible, other than to conclude that the first bullet that struck JFK (which, per the autopsy, is hanging in mid-air between JFK and Connally and proceeding, obviously, toward the front of the limo) went into the only other injured victim in that car?

Did Hoover's men not even study ANY of this evidence before arriving at a ""3 Shots & 3 Hits"" scenario? If they didn't know these basic hunks of information -- why didn't they? That'd be my first question to them?

I'm not accusing the FBI of being involved in any kind of massive cover-up operation...because I don't think they were. And, along those same lines, I certainly don't believe for a moment that LBJ was a part of some crooked conspiracy and cover-up following JFK's death.

Because if Johnson had been involved in some type of cover-up plot, would he have voluntarily taped some of the phone calls that he made sure were recorded in the days and weeks following such a ""cover-up"" operation? Particularly a phone conversation in September 1964 with WC member Richard Russell, during which Johnson and Russell each say they do not believe the Single-Bullet Theory is true. Would LBJ want that comment on tape if he had a desire to squelch all talk of conspiracy? I kinda doubt it.

A whole lot of people have doubts about the Single-Bullet Theory. But their doubts don't make the SBT any less true. The SBT, in my view, is THE best explanation for the injuries to both JFK and JBC (not counting the JFK head shot, that is).

The Single-Bullet Conclusion perfectly aligns with all of the physical evidence....from the (one) whole bullet recovered in the hospital where the victims were taken....to the wound patterns on the victims....to the ""timing"" visible on Abraham Zapruder's film....and right on into Lee Harvey Oswald's rifle (which was found in the TSBD shortly after the shooting). The SBT fits -- to an absolute ""T"".

Believing in ANY other anti-SBT solution only adds numerous layers of mystery and ""unexplainables"" to the mix. And is THAT type of thinking more logical than the completely-within-reason (and ""within the evidence"") Single-Bullet Conclusion?

If you look up ""Occam's Razor"" in the dictionary, I think you'll find the answer to that last question.

-------------------

Final comments re. the FBI's initial errors in the JFK case:

I think the FBI was merely rushed to get a report out to the newly-created Warren Commission as soon as humanly possible, and therefore they very likely  didn't dig deep enough to resolve all of the questions surrounding the murder of JFK. Hence, some inaccuracies were bound to result.

But the basic, raw information was there for Hoover's agency to use, even via a somewhat-rushed-to-press report that was issued just 17 days after an event that had many, many things to sort out, including THREE separate murders (John Kennedy's, J.D. Tippit's, and Lee Harvey Oswald's) and all of the various issues that went with each of those three killings.

But, possibly, in this ""rushed"" state to get some kind of ""final report"" to the Warren Commission members, Mr. Hoover and the FBI missed a lot of important info. Obviously, in hindsight, that's precisely what did occur. Hindsight, of course, is almost always 20/20.

7916452,4,B000031EGK,"This video features some very significant phone conversations of Lyndon Johnson as President. His private conversations with notable persons are very revealing.
 Johnson's secretary, Marie Fehmer, was interviewed for this video. She was instrumental in setting up the phone recording system in the White House. Joseph Califano, Jack Valenti and others are also interviewed here. Their insights are worthwhile and they give background info concerning various phone conversations.
 Johnson's brief call to Rose Kennedy after the assassination is recorded here. His very gracious and humble call to Ted Kennedy in 1964 also appears. We hear Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover discussing the assassination. And LBJ pressuring Richard Russell to join the Warren Commission.
 Johnson's use of language was often entertaining. He sometimes used extreme flattery. Other times he was profane and vulgar. He employed various techniques to prevail upon people.
 In short, this video succeeds in presenting some noteworthy phone calls from the 1960's White House. The mood of the times is presented along with the mindset of the President.",1036108800,4,1120,5.570588235294117
