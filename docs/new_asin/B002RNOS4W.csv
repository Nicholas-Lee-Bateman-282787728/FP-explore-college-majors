8378799,5,B002RNOS4W,"Details: Boxed set of 9 DVDs in 5 slim cases, 33 episodes and 4 short outlines of lost episodes from Series 1.
Many extras including filmed introductions by Linda Thorson for her favorites, two period promos about Thorson, some commentary, screen tests for Diana Rigg replacements, still galleries, a printed classic promo insert and more!
 *REGION 2 PAL Format* You will need a Multi Region player or PC device to watch this. I assume these discs are Xbox & Play Station compatible.
Very high quality DVDs, some of my Absolute Favorites!
This is an EXCELLENT professional HD restoration release. Beautiful quality, far better than old A&E Region 1 discs.
Menus are great, easy to use.
Audio is Mono 2.0 unfortunately and seems to lack the higher fidelity of the A&E region 1 releases. Curious.
There is a visual commentary/interview extra for the Forget-Me-Knot transitional episode concerning Mr. Patrick Macnee's feelings about the departure of Diana Rigg. Very sweet.
Linda Thorson's Tara King was precocious and sexy by nature. Very feminine and always playful but her character was never quite as well developed as Emma Peel's.
The Avengers' co-creator, Brian Clemens felt he was close to getting the series concept right here.
That's hard to say, I think.
I actually prefer the early Honor Blackman stories myself.
They are so eloquently expressive, they fascinate me to no end and are uncompromisingly British!
Every episode here is uniquely individual and they vary quite a bit.
Some are sheer comedy, others are profound, but all are interesting to say the least.
A handful are indisputable masterpieces, their relevance is obvious.
Despite this I can feel some palpable desperation throughout, everyone is trying so very sincerely to keep this phenomenon going.
But everything does change relentlessly.
Sometimes global reformulation isn't enough, at least it wasn't for American audiences anyway.
People stateside actually preferred Laugh-In over The Avengers, a then sign-of-the-times.

But here we are left with these beautiful productions, some of which are very cinematic and always worthwhile.
An unforgettable television series and a lovely entertainment experience.
There will always be some who remember for the fun of it and I am one.

If you are a fan of The Avengers this is well worth buying a Multi Region player.

Beautiful...

Update: 11.18.17-

I am now watching all of my Avengers & PAL format DVDs with a PANASONIC DMP-BDT270 multi region bluray player and a 4K UHD TV. They upscale BEAUTIFULLY!
These Avengers releases are THE Benchmark Standard for upscaling quality, absolutely PERFECT and I cannot stress that enough!
I can see no pixelation whatsoever and the images are very clear.
OPTIMUM Studio/Canal DVDs are EXCELLENT.

Some of the OPTIMUM Avengers releases are difficult to find, they were for me anyway. Below are the ASINs for the DVD format releases available, some will have links to their Bluray counterparts. Just enter them in the search window.

Series 1 (partial) & Series 2 -  ASIN:B002GPNKFO

Series 3 -  ASIN:B002KAIW26

Series 4 -  ASIN:B002MKP37G

Series 5 -  ASIN:B002RNOS4M

The New Avengers  1976-77
Series 1 & 2 -  ASIN:B000HEVTKE

Look for Patrick Macnee's sublime performance in The Ray Bradbury Theatre episode 'USHER II'. Great fun!

*Bluray vs. DVD*

I purchased the Bluray edition of this collection out of curiosity and for the reasonable price ($41.00!).
Both the DVD & Bluray versions are sourced from the same High Definition digital restoration and are quite similar in overall quality, but the Blurays do look better at a near viewing distance.
At a more normal distance, about 10 feet plus, I honestly can't see the difference.
Both releases share the same Mono 2.0 Audio, which I think is disappointing. 5.1 Surround  would add so much.

Both are 9 disc collections with similar extras except-

Blurays don't seem to have the PDFs of the DVDs.
DVDs don't have all the video extras of the Blurays.
Blurays lack onscreen menu scene access of the DVDs.
DVDs don't feature English Subtitles of the Blurays.
There are no printed inserts or promo extras included with the Bluray release.

With higher definition comes finer lettering, which is a bit harder to see with the Bluray menus.

All these differences, or compromises aside I consider the Bluray release superb overall, and I still think my beloved DVDs are excellent and more fun to use!
I enjoy both versions very much for their own attributes, the Bluray is much better for the Stills Galleries. I am impressed someone made the best effort to get it right, it really does show.
The 2010 DVD & 2015 Bluray releases were obviously designed for Avengers admirers by people who feel the same.

Practically speaking, I don't think the 2015 Bluray edition will be as durable as the 2010 DVD. Printed paper packaging wears over time, plastic slimcases do too but are easily replaceable.

I really have enjoyed reviewing another worthwhile release for this most fascinating phenomenon, The Avengers.
Another privilege indeed.

Peace & Happiness
