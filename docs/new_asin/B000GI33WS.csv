8132458,2,B000GI33WS,This DVD is only for small kids/toddlers.  We have kids 12 and older and we can get more information (with more exciting activities and destinations) from Hawaii's own websites. Don't waste your money on this DVD if you have big kids.  Very basic tourist information.,1314057600,,267,4.911111111111111
8132459,5,B000GI33WS,"I didn't want to get a travel video that seem monotonous and boring. I wanted something that was more family oriented and takes us to all the nice, interesting places as if we're actually there. This video did just that even though I don't have kids of my own, I enjoyed seeing all the nice places that the family in the video had went to. It just seems so personal. If I haven't watched this video, I wouldn't have even known that hawaii has a chinatown! The restaurant that they went to...Roy's does seem like the ideal restaurant to dine into when you're on a vacation. It is more family oriented and it has a stunning view of the beach! I would definitely recommend this video for families who are looking to have a good time while vacationing.",1309305600,,748,4.427536231884058
8132460,5,B000GI33WS,"It is always fun to see video of your destination both prior to and after attending a location.  This video on Oahu is no exception.  Have been there countless times and I do take short videos and pictures but nothing compares to a professional video.  As soon as they come out with a 2009 update I will order that one too.  Our family also utilizes online info from Frommers, [...] , and the venues themselves for info about Oahu.",1237334400,,431,4.417721518987341
