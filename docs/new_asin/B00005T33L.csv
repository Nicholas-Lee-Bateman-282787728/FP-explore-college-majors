7953456,5,B00005T33L,"Broadway Sweat is my favorite exercise video. The dance moves are, in my opinion, the prettiest and simplest of all. The music is so inspiring and works so well with the routines. I think this video will never look ""dated"" because show tunes are so classic. The toning video is fun and I got good results especially in my leg muscles.  Please get this for girls ages 10and up (after consulting their doctor first) because it will inprove their coordination and gracefulness and they will smile while they dance because Richard is so heartwarming. I am middle aged and I love this video. I am so happy to have Richard Simmons in my era!",1108080000,4,635,4.5701754385964914
