1719738,5,B000067DCX,"This was great!  I'd never seen this film until this newly released, uncensored international version put out by Synapse.  It shows how perfectly a black-and-white film can be used to produce growing, sustained horror with atmosphere.  With the lights out, I watched this little gem, and occasionally paused the film to listen to the house when I thought I'd heard an unusual ""bump"" in the night; after all the horror films I've seen, that doesn't happen that often any more.
Castle of Blood (in Italy, ""Danse Macabre"") was directed by Itallion icon Antonio Margheriti, who made a name for himself with Sword and Sandle and Sci-fi films.  In this movie, he created perhaps one of the best evil dead stories of all time.  The premise, an eager, young reporter for the London Times meets Edgar Allen Poe and a companion of his, Blackwood, at a tavern called the Four Devils.  From the start, we feel as though we've stepped right into a Poe story, where everything is dream-like, and turning slowly towards some approaching horror.  Our hero is offered a wager that he can not survive the night in Blackwood's family castle, emerging at dawn unscathed.  The castle is supposed to be haunted by something not just frightening, but deadly.  In order to assure an interview with Poe for his paper, the young man takes the bet, not at all believing in the supernatural.  What follows is a night fraught with evil manifestations, as ghost after ghost must relive the last insanely violent moments before their deaths in the house once a year.  Our hero, aided by a beautiful exotic ghost played by Barbara Steel (fresh from her success in ""Black Sunday"") discovers his very soul is in jepardy unless he can escape the claustraphobic, shadow-filled interior of the house.
We're treated to murder and mayhem, and a plot that quickens in pace until it reaches an urgent pitch at the climax of the film that leaves us sitting on the edge of our seats.
This movie may not be for everyone, especially young, jaded movie-goers used to glossy red slasher films and cgi monster effects.  This is old-style ghost-story telling, where black-and-white filmography is used for the full effect of atmosphere and character empathy.  This is also not a film for children, as there is nudity and a brief scene of lesbianism.  Four film sources were used to reproduce this original, longest version of the film (it was released in America with the afore-mentioned scenes cut), so at times the sound track switches to Itallion with english subtitles.  These scenes are usually brief and do not detract at all from the movies appeal.  Understand too, this film is over forty years old, and some of the film elements used to put it back together were hard to find and slightly damaged by time; they are still of such a fine quality, you hardly notice it.  The movie is presented in widescreen with a mono soundtrack.  Though the voices of the Italion actors is dubbed in english, they did a fine job, so don't worry about a silly, bad acted dubbing that many associate with foreign films from that period.
So, if you like fog-shrouded castles, evil ghosts seeking human blood, and fearful flights through dusty, cob-webbed hallways, this is your movie.",1035072000,55,3224,4.809782608695652
1719739,4,B000067DCX,"This is a fine example of the Italian Horror film genre which took American Drive-Ins by storm in the 1960's (American title: CASTLE OF TERROR). Star Barbara Steele, having made a sensation in Mario Bava's BLACK SUNDAY (aka: MASK OF SATAN) in 1960, appeared in a string of Euro-Horror classics over the next several years with this film being one of the best. Directed by Bava protege/rival Antonio Margheriti (aka: Anthony Dawson) the story is original and compelling, but the atmospheric black & white cinematography is actually the star of the picture. Sadly, the English dubbing is not very good (it never is really), but the score is hauntingly beautiful. If this DVD is actually the European release print then expect some flashes of nudity, a bit of lesbianism and extended gore in the films mid-section that were trimmed for U.S. release. For fans of Barbara Steele this is a must have, and those who enjoy a good creepy horror story, beautifully filmed will also want to add it to their collections.",1022112000,67,1008,4.866279069767442

1719764,5,B000067DCX,"If you folks want to experience one of the best horror films made, watch this film (Danse Macabre/Castle of Blood). First you must remember it is an older film. It was around when I was a child watching it in the 1960's. It is a film that was made in black & white as many still were in that era. I thought the acting was pretty good. Talk about a love triangle - nightmare this has got to be it!. I would like to suggest that they speak in the same tongue  clear through the film from the beginning to end instead of speaking French in parts or using subtitles- (But I got through it O.K. though it was done in good taste.)  but I remember in those days how some scenes in this show would have been considered questionable - racy. I have been looking for this film for years and I finally got a copy. Thanks. I have only had it a couple of weeks and have watched it many times. Forerunner to Collinswood? This is one of those films that the more you watch the more you will see things you missed from previous viewings. I would like to make a suggestion. What about someone asking Ms. Ricci & Johnny Dep (Sleepy Hollow) if they would consider making a serious new version of this movie. I think it would be perfect for both. (A serious tone - not a comedy - just like the one above. I think it would fit in very well with both performers. As Rici looks very much like Barbara Steele and Mr. Depp does a good job performing panic scenes. I am willing to bet that if someone would be willing to put forth the monetary backing that this film could be easily recreated and using modern technology and the above performers and with a little updating this film may stand a chance at becoming  a #1 hit for the year if done right. In my opinion, I really like the show but everyone has different tastes and I am giving you my opinion. You could probably keep the same basic story and sequences(script). Stop and think if Rici and John wouldn't do a good job in this. Hugo chasing Rici around the house and Johnny in one scene commanding the Doctor to appear and that he is not frightened and the next moment he is pounding on the door for the good Doctor to let him out (Someone must have made a believer out of this young man.). I would really like to see these two make the remake of this film. It's an older film but it is still a good film and one of the best when it was made I suspect. If you watch this movie and agree why don't you write and suggest Ms. Ricci and Mr. Depp to consider making this film again? You can also possibly say that it offers some morality lessons...like that which your mother, and/or minister/priest would tell you. At least 1). Don't make bets/gamble. 2.) Don't jump into bed with the first person you meet. 3.) Make sure you have a life insurance policy and it is paid to current before taking on a job opportunity of this nature. 4.) Don't walk through graveyards at night.  5.) Finally, Don't mess around with dead people.  Heed these words and may you live a long life. I feel that you will enjoy the film. Best Wishes. - GDH",1372636800,5,3058,4.220512820512821
1719765,1,B000067DCX,"I recently was sent the Westlake Entertainment version of this great Barbara Steele movie. The quality is equal to a third generation VCR transfer! No, worse!

1719768,4,B000067DCX,"The film has been restored with some lines in the middle and end. Writer Alan Foster (Georges Rivi&egrave;re) accepts a bet to stay in a haunted castle for one night, all soul's eve when the dead come back to life and show how they were killed. Alan arrives at the dark castle to discover it is a set-up for the owner's sister Elizabeth (Barbara Steele). Supposedly her brother gets her a man once a year. The couple fall in love at first sight as we are introduced to Julia (Margarete Robsahm) a woman who appears to be a rival.

Soon the castle is filled with people and a few muscle men without shirts. Then the real action starts.

The film is a good Italian classic horror thriller. It doesn't have the blood and flesh of modern films. The plot is predictable, but still an enjoyable view, considering they restored most of it.

1719769,2,B000067DCX,"Sadly, I must agree with at least one other reviewer that this film has not worn well with increasing age -- at least, with my increasing age. As a junior high student, I remember being enthralled by it in much the same way that I was by all those Roger Corman epics of the same era. Watching it now, even in its ""uncensored international version,"" I guess I can chalk up my previous reaction to the enthusiasm and naivete of youth. I still think that the photography is first-rate all the way, with excellent composition and great use of black-and-white images to create mood. It is not, however, quite the ""orgy of terror"" that it bills itself to be. It takes a long time to get to anything remotely resembling terror, as we first sit through the framing device of a bet between a young journalist and a nobleman concerning whether the former can survive a night in the latter's dangerous castle. Set in England in perhaps the 1840s, it features an improbable Edgar Allan Poe as an observer of the bet. Anyway, the journalist arrives at the castle and, after a long and tedious if admittedly atmospheric stroll through the grounds and into the building, finally discovers that it's not empty. What ensues is a long and tedious if somewhat interesting explanation for the appearance of several other people. The essence of plot is in effect a kind of vampiric chain letter, with the journalist as the latest recipient in this bloody pyramid scheme. To complicate matters, one of the previous ghostly victims has apparently fallen in love with him, as he  has with her. Several details are confusing or inconsistent. One gets the impression that this supernatural game has been renewed year after year, yet only a handful of past victims are present. And other aspects of the plot are problematic at best and inconsistent at the worst. Why should the one past victim fall in love with the journalist so easily and quickly? I haven't the slightest idea. The ending is the one place in the film where terror actually starts to rear its head, but it's quickly defused as the journalist attempts to escape. The finale has a nice ironic twist, but the last few minutes of this film and it's excellent photography just aren't enough to overcome the overall tedium which the movie inspires. To top it off, an apparently real snake is killed on camera, a display of utterly unnecessary cruelty. The view should also be warned that this release is made from more than one print of the film, so that it switches now and then from being in English to being subtitled. Oh, and as for it being ""uncensored,"" I suppose that refers to brief nudity and lesbian themes, all very tame. Two stars for disappointment.",1357603200,,2697,4.689873417721519
1719780,4,B000067DCX,"Castle Of Blood(1964) is a very good Horror movie that relies more on visuals & atmosphere to achieve maximum effect instead of gore & special effects. It is also Barbara Steele's 2nd best screen performance after the excellent Black Sunday(1960). It is a very good ghost story with some rather tame lesbian scenes that were probably cut from the original scenes. This is the uncensored international version. I watched it twice the other night & even enjoyed it more on the 2nd viewing. It was supposedly taken from an Edgar Allan Poe tale Danse Macabre although no such tale actually exists by Poe. Poe is actually portrayed in the film as a drunk first seen in a tavern. When Poe visits London, he is approached by a British journalist played by George Riviere. He plays a character Alan Foster. Foster meets Poe & Lord Blackwood at a tavern. They bet Foster that he cannot spend one night alone in a certain castle on All Soul's Eve. On that specific night, every person who ever died there re-enacts their deaths. That's where he meets the beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood played by Barbara Steele & falls madly in love with her even though she has no heartbeat. Over the course of the night, he sees several horrible murders replayed by the dead inhabitants. I don't want to be a spoiler so I'll leave the rest of the plot for you to enjoy. I can only say that the last 45 minutes of the film are the best. Synapse Films presents a new fully digital transfer & present the film , for the 1st time in America, the complete version of this cult classic. All of the actors are very good even though Steele, who is excellent, was not pleased with the film due to her co-star Margarate Robsahm. The film was directed by Antonio Margheriti. If your horror tastes run more towards atmosphere, fine acting, excellent cinematography, & effective story-telling, I feel stongly that you will fully embrace Castle Of Blood & will also find yourself thirsty for repeated viewings.

Barbara Steele is sexy as hell and one of her best roles, right up there with Black Sunday and Nightmare Castle.  Another winner presented by Synapse.

It's the perfect haunted house movie, featuring vampiric ghosts, ghouls, and a bit of gratuitous nudity!

1719783,3,B000067DCX,"In 1964 this must have been the bee's knees. The beautiful Gothic atmosphere. The sumptuous black and white cinematography. The haunting music. This is more film art than film craft. Alas, we've become jaded over the years. All the levels of everything in horror movies have been upped exponentially. A younger viewer would look at this now and wonder what the big deal was.

The story is old and worn. A wager is set that a man cannot spend an entire night in a particular old house. He takes the wager and we're off to the races. Here, however, things are a bit different. People aren't being picked off one at a time by some unseen agent. We meet the players rather early on. So the mystery becomes deeper and more confused. Our hero needs to figure things out, and keep his wits about him, even though he is falling for one of the characters he should be wary of.

The handling of the genre is interesting by the standard of the time. The viewer guesses (or should guess) at least part of what is going on but knows something is still afoot. I myself was curious as to how it would all play out, but I really wasn't scared in the least. This is more of a mood piece.  I wonder how audiences of the time reacted to some of the scenes. How scared were they? Were they as aware of some of the exaggerated movements of the characters as I was?

But that aside. This film was made with care. Every shot is well framed and well lit. It is a true moving work of art. Barbara Steele just has one of those faces that begs to be used in a movie like this and you don't tire of looking at her. Most of the rest of the cast does a good job. But the directors are the stars here. They treat their audience to a rich feast for the eyes. I could easily give this another half star and quite easily be talked into a full four. I guess my argument with myself is if the time for a film like this has ended. Will it die with the viewers of my generation or is there still something here for the young ones.",1277337600,5,1992,4.152849740932642
1719784,2,B000067DCX,"I watched this last night and like many of the ""oldies"" I've watched lately, It was a bit disappointing.  Having seen this at the drive-in some 40 years ago, time has not been kind.  The special effects are camp. Don't get fooled by the (Uncensored International Version) suck you in hype.  All you are going to get extra is some dubbed French.  This would be a great video to add to a 10 video set that sell for $20.00,  I'd pay two dollars for this video and have no complaints because that's what it worth. to sell it for $18 is to rip people off.  I did enjoy the video enough to keep it, but it will be another 40 years before I watch it again.  As for the complaints of some of the other reviewers about the video quality, my copy was fine.  They might be equating today's standards in video to those of 40 years ago.  I can tell you If you could see this on a drive-in screen I think you could better understand that this was originally on film, and on a much larger screen, I've seen very little in B&W film that transfer to video with the quality of today's average camcorder.  For those of you who doubt me just you wait 40 years from now and take a look in the mirror to see how you transfer, it ain't going to be pretty!",1269302400,2,1232,4.117154811715481

This is an Italian film, as you all know, with the great Barbara Steele in a good role as a lovelorn spirit. A newspaper reporter makes a bet in a tavern with the owner of a particular haunted castle that he cannot spend a single night therein. Sitting at the same alcohol laden table is Edgar Allan Poe! (Who is visiting England and takes the opportunity to impound on whether his macabre tales are based on fact or no...hence the bet.)The atmosphere is great, this DVD is great...perfect black and white, crystal clear (tho there are a few moments of not quite perfect English audio, but it is hardly a deterrent), the sets are spooky and stylish (from the upstairs roms down into the crypt, you are inside the bowels of this house in the dead of night with the reporter from the moment he enters), and the script holds your interest. The man is alone in the castle with spirits re-enacting their deaths as well as a bloodthirsty vampire...it reminded me of the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyworld mixed with a good dose of 60s Euro-goth. There is a little topless nudity, and even that is stylish with the black and white film. This film is a lot of fun and I highly recommend...so get Castle of Blood...set aside a rainy afternoon or night, and take a trip inside a real haunted house in the wee hours and commune with Barbara Steele...",1259452800,5,1446,4.522900763358779

Some short portions are in French with English subtitles since scenes are included that were never dubbed for U.S. release, but this does not take away any enjoyment from the movie and these scenes are really quite brief.

1719812,4,B000067DCX,"I originally saw this movie as a boy at the old Rialto Theatre as part of a Saturday afternoon matinee triple bill which also featured Vincent Price's ""Last Man on Earth"" and Mario Bava's ""Nightmare Castle.""  I had nightmares about blood lusting ghosts for a week afterwards!  Though I didn't know it then, all three movies would prove to be classics of the genre.  No wonder I was so scared!  Though all three films frightened me, it was Castle of Blood that had the most profound impact.

It was the first on the bill.  I didn't even get to see it from the beginning as we were late getting to the cinema and missed the first 20 minutes of the movie. That's lot to miss since the edited print only ran about 79 minutes (the unedited runs 87minutes).  But despite this, the dark creepy atmosphere (complete with ruined castles, fog enshrouded cemeteries, shadows and cobwebs), Gothic set design, strong acting, and suspense (especially the last 20 minutes) scared the bejeepers out of me and made a lasting impression

It took me years to finally get a copy of the film for my collection. Since it was a French - Italian import, it wasn't a movie that showed up on the late show in Winnipeg.  I couldn't quite remember the title (remember I didn't get to seen the beginning of the film and was scared witless), and to make matters worse, the film had been released under literally a dozen different movie titles (aka Danze Macabre, Coffin of Terror, Castle of Terror, Long Night of Terror, etc...) and the USA/UK working title ""Castle of Blood"" was very generic, similar to dozens of other ""b"" horror and suspense films, making it illusive.  But thanks to the internet and perseverance, I  found it at last!

What a treat to finally watch the film in its entirety after so many years!  It may not have had quite the sheer emotional impact that it did when I was a boy, but as haunted house movies go, it's stands up well and compares favourably to similar iconic films of the period such as  ""The Haunting,"" ""The Innocents"" or ""Black Sunday,""

The film is a fine early effort of  Italian director Antonio Margheriti.  It stars 60's scream queen icon Barbara Steele and features a well written screenplay by Sergio Corbucci about a sceptical writer (Georges Riviere) who, on a bet, spends the night in haunted house and unsuspectingly becomes part of an annual ongoing ghostly story.  The hypnotic Steele is well cast as the ghostly love interest - as is Arturo Dominici as Dr. Carmus, and Margarete Robsahm as Julia.

Many of the tricks Margheriti employs to create the film's eerie atmosphere (cobwebs, creaking doors, fog, etc) are bound to seem clich to a modern audience, but they work far more effectively in black and white than they ever could in modern day colour.  Rather than using body counts and special effects, the film creates scares the old fashion way, relying on a good story, stylish direction, fine set production, interesting camera work, and strong acting performances. Margheriti does a marvellous job taking these elements and building the film's suspense as the horrifying paranormal secret of the house gradually reveals itself to the unwitting writer.

The film is not without faults. The pace drags at the beginning of the film (ironically, the 20 minutes I originally missed). This is probably worsened by Synapse films effort to restore the film to its original length.  Though fans will likely appreciate the chance to see the film restored - in terms of the intro - it may have been more of hindrance than a help.  The English voice dubs are merely passable and, in the restored scenes, the language shifts from English to French  (English subtitles provided) which is sure to be annoying to some viewers.

However, Synapse Films deserves kudos for the quality of the print.  Clearly some effort was put into its restoration and deservedly so.

I enjoyed the film immensely and highly recommend it to aficionados of 60's Italian Goth films, or anyone who enjoys a good ghost story.

1719814,5,B000067DCX,"Most of the other reviews are spot-on.  This is just a fun archetype mid-60's Italian Eurogoth pic - soaked in atmosphere, perfect for a dark rainy night. Barbara Steele, of course, is at her finest, and there's the requisite brooding (and beautiful) black and white cinematography, creepy portraits, candelabras, graveyards, harpsichord music, foggy cemeteries, dreamy echo-y harp intermezzos, ghosts, crypts, bad dubbing with familiar voices, cobwebs, black cats, it's all there in one entertaining and surreal package. As an added bonus, a touch of lesbianism and some brief but tasteful nudity. Remember, this one was European.

I give it five stars because films like this, sadly, will never be made again. In an era when extreme and graphic sadism passes for ""horror"" and such films confuse ""unsettling"" their audience with frightening them, I appreciate, more and more, the kinder, gentler, more creative, and more atmospheric, and entertaining era of ""old school"" black and white horror genre - especially the 60's European goth stuff... and especially those films featuring the beautiful Barbara Steele.

1719816,4,B000067DCX,"You could say that ""Castle of Blood"" is based on the best story Edgar Allan Poe never wrote -- despite what the opening credits say, I cannot find any Poe story called ""Danse Macabre.""

But despite that, this vintage horror movie is still quite entertaining as a Gothic tragic romance. It suffers from a rather thin plot, but makes up for it by soaking the entire story in atmosphere -- lots of dungeons, coffins, crazed murders, cobwebby corridors, and vampiric ghosts. A danse macabre indeed.

Edgar Allan Poe (Silvano Tranquilli) is on a visit to England, telling a gruesome story to his friend Lord Blackwood. A cocky journalist, Alan Foster (Georges Rivire) is there to interview him, but he ends up taking a wager from Blackwood -- to disprove the supernatural, he'll spend the night of November 2nd (All Souls' Day) in Blackwood's haunted castle.

The castle turns out to be as creepy as expected, but not as abandoned -- Alan meets the beautiful Elizabeth (Barbara Steele), and falls for her despite the fact that she's... well, dead. As the night goes on (with the help of the local wacky scientist), Alan sees the tragedies that led to her death, and those of the other ghosts who drift through the place. But he doesn't realize that the ghosts have plans for him too...

""Castle of Blood"" was one of those beautifully decadent-looking Eurohorror movies, full of sumptuous atmosphere and genuinely creepy ghosts. It seems slow by modern standards, especially since there isn't anything jumping out or gratuitous gore'n'guts.

The plot itself is rather thin, with a contrived love story (they fall in eternal love in five minutes!). But who cares? That plot is substantial enough to carry all this atmosphere -- creepy, ghastly atmosphere, peppered with the occasional gruesome murder or flashback to parties. The castle itself seems like a dead rotted thing, covered in cobwebs and dust.

And the story picks up substantially in the second half, when Alan finds out what made all these ghosts in the first place (it involves stabbing, bludgeoning, and lesbian groping). Then director Antonio Margheriti throws a deliciously gruesome plot twist into the story, which elevates it from a ghost story to real, bloodthirsty horror.

Riviera is the one weak link in this movie's cast; his Alan is so smug and stiff that it's hard to care what happens to him. Instead, the good performances are provided by the dead: Steele as the frightened ghostly waif, Margarete Robsahm as her chilly maid, and Arturo Dominici as the most sedate horror scientist ever. Tranquilli also gets a nod for his solid cameo as Poe.

""Castle of Blood"" is short on plot, but miles long on atmosphere. And it turns out that it's all this vintage horror movie needs -- nasty ghosts, sumptuous decay and a giant castle.",1171670400,3,2796,4.896405919661734

The Westlake version of this movie is not as good as the movie itself, though -- the first few minutes are very grainy and green, and while it improves a lot, it's never really what you'd call crisp. The print has some brief jumps, crackles and lines, and that mediocre English dub. Dedicated fans of this movie will want to get the official rerelease, but this one is good enough for an introduction.

1719818,5,B000067DCX,"I used to watch this film all the time as a kid on Channel 5's Creature Features, and found out early that it had been cut. Why it took almost 40 years to finally get an uncensored version is a true mystery, but finally, here it is, and well worth the wait. I'm a big fan of 'old dark house' movies, good or bad, and this one is good. One of the finest of the Italian horror wave that produced Mario Bava (among others), this film is beautifully realized in atmospheric black and white. The director remade this film in the 70s as Web of the Spider, with Anthony Franciosa. Not bad, but not as creepy as the original.",1156636800,5,617,4.19327731092437
1719819,5,B000067DCX,"This haunting movie has remained in my memory for 40 years since I saw it in the 60's. Don't expect a great deal of plot. However, the decay and melancholy of the castle together with the lighting and camerawork are what makes this movie work. Often slow moving but finally with an unforgettable atmosphere this movie is a must-have if you like to be haunted in an old-fashioned way.

1719830,4,B000067DCX,"A journalist takes a bet that he can't spend an entire night in a ""haunted"" castle.  How many times have we seen this plot?  AH, but such a premise may never have been done with such style, mood, sensitivity, etc. as seen here.  Based on Edgar Allan Poe's ""Danse Macabre"", this film reeks atmosphere and spookiness in every single frame of film.  I suspected it was Italian --hard to be sure, as my old TV copy had all English-sounding names (""Anthony Dawson"", it turns out, is NOT the English actor who appeared in 1962's DR. NO).  Barbara Steele (PIT AND THE PENDULUM, the 90's remake of DARK SHADOWS), frustrated with the attitudes of Hollywood types, thumbed her nose and had more success overseas.  Some of the voices used for dubbing sounded familiar to me... I suspect the actors involved also dubbed such shows as SPEED RACER.

The plot builds slowly, inexorably...  First the journalist wanders an empty house... OR IS IT?  Then he meets the beautiful and lonely Steele, and the two fall in love so quickly one wonders if there isn't something in the air.  Then a noted doctor appears and begins explaining what's REALLY going on... except, there's more to HIM than meets the eye as well.  Throughout, the lead character refuses to take anything at face value, despite the growing number of mysteries, impossibilities, and MURDERS.  Only at the very end, perhaps, does it finally sink in that-- YES-- the house IS haunted!  But too late...

It wasn't until the climax that I realized just how much the entire story structure (and even the photography!) reminded me of a story I used to hate but came to appreciate as the years went by...  ""THE GUESTS"" from the classic 1st season of THE OUTER LIMITS.  Creepy house... creepy inhabitants... one man lost in it all... and a girl he falls for, who does all she can to help him escape.  It would appear this film and that one were made the SAME year!  Could they both have been inspired by the same source material?

It took a bit tracking this down here, simply because-- HOW MANY ALTERNATE TITLES do some films need?  Depending on the print, this one's been known as CASTLE OF TERROR, LA DANSE MACABRE, CASTLE OF BLOOD, LONG NIGHT OF TERROR, TOMBS OF HORROR and TOMBS OF TERROR !  (I had to consult another website to see WHICH one it might be listed under here!)

A CLASSIC!  When you're done watching all 8 of Roger Corman's POE films, put this one on next.  They make a good fit.",1153872000,3,2439,4.5796766743648964
1719831,4,B000067DCX,"I'm a huge fan of Italian director Antonio Margheriti, aka Anthony M. Dawson, even though I haven't seen very many of his films. How can this be? Because the ones I have seen revel in low budget schlocky glory. Margheriti is responsible for such classics as ""Alien From the Deep,"" the infamous ""Cannibal Apocalypse,"" and ""Killer Fish."" He's also the man who brought us several highly entertaining shoot 'em up action/war films, films like ""Indio,"" ""Indio 2,"" ""Tiger Joe,"" ""The Last Hunter,"" ""The Hunters of the Golden Cobra,"" and ""Ark of the Sun God."" If you need any additional evidence pointing to Dawson's relevancy in the realm of low budget cult classics, he directed the catastrophic ""Yor, the Hunter from the Future."" If you've seen this disaster, you know how important Margheriti is to lovers of cheese cinema! I'm dying to see all of these films--and a few others--arrive on DVD. Until then, I'm contenting myself with the precious few of this director's earlier movies that have come out, or are soon to come out, on disc: ""Castle of Blood,"" ""The Virgin of Nuremberg,"" and ""Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye"" among them. ""Castle of Blood"" inevitably draws comparisons to Mario Bava's ""Black Sunday.""

Bava made the superior film, but ""Castle of Blood"" is just as entertaining in its own right. A black and white entry in the gothic horror field popular in the early 1960s, Margheriti's film possesses all the right elements for a creepy good time: a gloomy castle, ghosts, Barbara Steele, and Edgar Allen Poe. Fun! The movie begins when a journalist by the name of Alan Foster (Georges Riviere) stumbles over the inimitable Poe (Silvano Tranquili) and a companion drinking at a small inn somewhere in England. Eager to interview the writer of superb supernatural tales, he soon agrees to a proposition offered by Poe's drinking companion, one Sir Thomas Blackwood (Umberto Raho). Blackwood owns a decrepit castle out in the sticks, a castle long rumored to hold the restless spirits of long departed souls. On one specific day of the year, he convinces someone to stay in the haunted building. And wouldn't you just know it? The night Foster stumbles into the bar is that very day of the year. Agreeing to Blackwood's bet, the journalist figures he can at least coax an interview out of Poe during the coach ride to the castle. The chances of him filing that story in the morning, however, will decrease with every minute he stays in the castle.

Blackwood's estate is indeed haunted, haunted by several spirits both benevolent and hostile. The first apparition Foster meets, Elisabeth Blackwood (Barbara Steele), couldn't be any nicer. She falls hard for the journalist, and he for her, before the truth about her status in the castle emerges: she's as dead as a doornail. That's sure to put the kibosh on any future matrimonial plans. What's worse, Elisabeth has a few companions to keep her company in eternity. One of them is another lady, the evil Julia (Margarete Robsahm), who has her own designs on poor Elisabeth. There is also a doctor in the house...er, castle who has resided there for quite a few years. Throw in a burly, thuggish looking chap and the hapless couple who took Sir Blackwood's bet the previous year, and it soon becomes apparent that this castle is a rocking place on one night of the year. As the evening proceeds, Foster witnesses the grisly circumstances that led to these people haunting the castle. Alan also discovers why Sir Blackwood went to such great pains to secure fresh meat for the estate. You see, the spiritual denizens of the castle need something from the living if they wish to reappear every year. I leave it to you to discover the identity of this item.

""Castle of Blood"" has many good things going for it. The best part of the movie is Barbara Steele. This raven haired beauty starred in a number of these black and white European gothic horror movies, most notably in Bava's ""Black Sunday,"" so it's always nice to see flaunt her copious charms again. She's like the original Goth chick--dark and dangerous yet incredibly sexy at the same time. Moreover, Margheriti gives us a fairly racy scene in which Steele and Robsahm make it abundantly clear what ties their two characters together. It's sort of surprising to see such behavior alluded to in a movie made way back in 1964! Anyway, Steele's appearance helps the film immeasurably. Another effective element in ""Castle of Blood"" is the atmosphere, which positively oozes doom and gloom. The masterful use of black and white photography helps, no doubt, but so does the claustrophobic ambiance of the castle. This is a building that screams at the top of its lungs, ""I'm haunted!"" Perhaps the only drawback to the film is pacing, which drags a bit when Foster first arrives at the castle and spends what feels like an eternity wandering about the premises. Aside from that small problem, ""Castle of Blood"" deftly delivers the chills and thrills.

This ""Uncensored International Version"" supposedly contains scenes cut out at the time of the movie's original release. I suspect we're talking about a flash of nudity towards the end of the film, and maybe a bit of the gore (tame by today's standards). A photo gallery, a trailer for the film, liner notes, and an alternate opening sequence round out the disc. If you like horror films, definitely give this one a watch. And if you think Barbara Steele is a serious babe, you'll love Margheriti's film. It's not quite as good as ""Black Sunday,"" but it's darn close.

Lovecraft's ""At the Mountains of Madness"" and began enjoying ""Castle of Blood."" The brilliant photography and lighting greatly propelled this movie based on an Edgar Allen Poe short story.

1719833,4,B000067DCX,"A fine example of the Italian horror-film of the sixties mostly concerned with atmosphere. A journalist is spending the night in a haunted mansion to prove Edgar Allan Poe wrong on his theory of life after death (!). The investigation of the old dark house and endless walking down dark corridors make up for most of the running time, but then Barbara Steele shows up and after two minutes they're in love. Well, the story is actually quite good, almost tending towards a greek tragedy with adultery and three people dying within ten seconds. As we have come to expect from the Italian horror-cinema there are plenty of hints to lesbianism, necrophilia and algolagnia, but as usual it's rendered with a lot of taste and poetical manner. Fans of Bava's Black Sunday will be pleased to see not only the otherworldly Barbara Steele but also the stoical Arturo Dominici, who played Javutich, as Dr. Camus, who becomes the journalist's spiritual guide in the haunted house.

You have to love thick gothic atmosphere, stagey black & white cinematography lingering long on a dark castle full of dust, suits of armor, strange sounds and...something else.

I finally found the time to sit down and watch it and ,wow, was I impressed. I had never seen it before and had only read about it. Synapse has done a wonderful job in restoring this treasure. It's a tricky tale and you really have to pay attention. The dialogue is excellent and appropriately morbid in explaining the happenings and the metaphysical reasons behind them. Margheritis' direction is tight and keeps the action going without lapsing into confusion which would have been easy to do. The photography lingers in lurid detail on the dark and shadowy set pieces and most impressively on the otherworldly beauty of Barbara Steele as a sad and dissolute figure doomed by tragic fate. She and several others are bound to relive their final violent moments on earth once a year on the ""night of the dead""---the anniversary of their deaths--- in the castle they occurred in. A writer accepts a strange bet from Edgar Allan Poe and a direct descendant of the castle that he won't survive this night if he stays alone in the ""empty"" place. There, he encounters these ""lost souls"" and witnesses them reliving their deaths. They need to be replenished with human blood on this ""night of the dead"" so that they may ""live"" again the following year. Steele is the Ist one he encounters and the writer determines to save her from eternal damnation. This is a dank, dark, gloomy film and is amazingly intense and even scary. The music score is great and perfectly enhances the horror to the hilt. Film is also relentlessy morbid from the writer meeting Poe in a tavern called the ""Four Devils"" all the way through to the last ironic shot where we see the writer has lost the bet. I cannot recomend this DVD enough. Extras include the alternate American opening credits as well as the lurid American theatrical trailer. ""Danse Macabre"" is certainly just that.

A callow writer of sorts, Alan Foster (Georges Riviere) joins the two and casts doubt on the claim that all Poes tales of the macabre are in fact based on real eyewitness accounts by him.  Lord Blackwood mentions that he just happens to have a haunted house, would Foster care to wager on whether he could spend the night there and make it out alive.  Foster doesnt believe in ghosts, so there!  Easy money, of course hell take the wager.  And before he can back out of the deal, Lord Blackwood and Poe escort Foster to the house in question.  See you in the morning.............or not.  The fool enters the house and starts a tour of the place by candle light.  Imagine his surprise when he meets an exotic beauty (Barbara Steele as Elisabeth Blackwood).  She looks very much alive.

Soon, the place is hopping with people.....who start killing one another then disappearing without a trace.  Naturally, Foster doesnt believe what hes seeing (and not seeing).  This is only a play!
