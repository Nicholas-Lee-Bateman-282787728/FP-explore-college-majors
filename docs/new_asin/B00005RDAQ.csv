7951976,5,B00005RDAQ,"Lovingly put together tribute to music beautifully played by a beautiful spirit.  John was one of the nicest people I have ever met, the most brilliant musician I have ever heard live.  (And I have heard/seen them all.)  Nothing could do him justice but his own life.  But this is close to the best we are likely to get.
If you never saw him play, this is well spent money.  Your only regret will be that you never saw him or met him.
If you were blessed by personal experience of his switchblade and tremolo, this is well spent money.  Your only regret will be that you will never hear him live or talk to him again.
But you will never forget.  Images will be burned on your retina for the rest of your lives.  Vibrato will now be encoded in your DNA.  It has been over 13 years since the last show in Cambridge, Mass. and I have never forgotten.  I never will.
Beyond the music, the images, there are the interviews.  Tender, loving interviews.  I think my favorite is Bill Graham's.  But all center around one main feature of his art.  He was unique.  Instantly identifiable.
(Bill is listening to him play and Jerry is trading licks with him in the heaven where all sincere musicians go.)
Whether or not you agree with many of us
(most of us who saw him?)
that he was the greatest rock and roll musician of all time
(hell, that he was the personification, the living embodiment of rock and roll)
there is no question that he was the most uniquely identifiable.
Sure.  This film should be on DVD.  (I had to get that in somewhere.)  A nice bonus would be complete versions of the excerpted songs.  Yeah.  Don't hold your breath.  (And DON'T wait for that to happen.)  But buy a few copies and maybe someone will take notice.  Give them to everyone you know who loves music, whether they have heard of him or not.
None of my usual cynicism and facetiousness.  This is important beyond words.
