1675538,4,B00005Y71H,"At last,the talented folks who brought such award-winning cartoons to the screen as BATMAN :the animated series,SUPERMAN and BATMAN BEYOND have turned their talents to DC Comics premiere superteam,THE JUSTICE LEAGUE.This latest incarnation brings the pleasant saturday morning memories of the SUPERFRIENDS in line with the depth and richness of modern storytelling. In the debut adventure,SECRET ORIGINS,we follow Batman and Superman into a crisis that may well be beyond their talents to contain. They (and we)are introduced to several exciting new heroes including Wonder Woman,Green Lantern,the Flash,Hawkgirl and pivital to this adventure,The Martian Manhunter. The story is engageing and the animation is crisp. I loved seeing these classic characters re-invented for a new millenium. Forget the X-men and other jonny-come-lately superheroes,the JUSTICE LEAGUE is what all superheroes hope to be when they grow up. I'm happy to see some of the greatest icons of comics history in glorious adventures. Somewhere in the world,kids are playing Justice League on the playground and there's plenty of cool heroes to go around.",1017014400,8,1126,5.668639053254438
1675539,4,B00005Y71H,"I am an old fan (if you consider 32 years old).  I have almost the entire collection of the various incarnations of the Justice League from the late 60s to current.  I saw this movie on Cartoon Network on March 16.  I have seen each of the other episodes also.  The main problem I have with this movie is the team makeup.  My personal opinion is that the team is almost too politically correct.  Everyone knows that Hal Jordan or Kyle Rayner would have made much better choices for Green Lantern.  Making Jon Stewart militant only makes this bad choice worse.  Also, when did HawkGirl become a solo act.  I realize she has some solo experience, but to make this appeal to mainstream viewers, either Zaureal (sp?) or Hawk would have been better choices.  I would also have liked to see some of the newer current team members from the comic (Plastic Man, Barda, Orion, or Steel).  If these members would have been included - the political correctness agenda would have been served as well.
All bashing aside - I have enjoyed this movie and the other episodes.  I do hope that some of the more involved plots are included from the comics also.  The ""Tower of Babel"" would be a great story to see animated.",1016496000,3,1202,4.5092592592592595
1675540,4,B00005Y71H,"Inasmuch as we have become a world of readers whose reading is limited to the latest offering from J.K. Rowling, John Grisham, or Stephen King, we seem to have forgotten the authors of classic literature.  Obviously Lukic and company realize this and decided to loosely adapt the ""Justice League"" pilot on one of the greatest novels in science fiction history: H.G.Wells' ""The War of the Worlds.""
Making variations in Wells' original, the invaders are not Martians, but unnamed aliens that decimated Mars years before, thus enabling the storyline to introduce J'onn J'onzz, the Martian Manhunter. Each of the remaining superheroes is more familiar to the viewing audience; due to their various television incarnations of the past, little ""introduction"" is required.
The animation is adequate; the voiceover talent is comparable to the exemplary acting of the previous WB animated shows of recent years. The brilliant Kevin Conroy returns as Batman, showing that 10 years under the ""cowl"" is still his domain.
For lovers of comic books and quality-animated storytelling, this DVD is a worthy effort",1016236800,9,1097,5.304597701149425
1675541,5,B00005Y71H,"I don't get what anyone says about it not exploring the characters.  Of course we're not going to see them out of costume very often, because most of them don't know each other's secret identity, but there is a lot of character development.  ""Secret Origins"" is basically a meeting of each and they all learn each others basic personality.  Not deep delving, but it is development.  We learn that Green Lantern is a rigid military type, Wonder Woman is a rookie, Batman isn't a team player, etc.  The whole story is about J'Onn J'Onzz (the martian) and goes into his character and background quite a bit.  The other episodes that have come along have been mostly about a specific character.  In ""In Blackest Night"" there is a lot of development and backstory for Green Lantern.  ""Paradise Lost"" is all about Wonder Woman, her mother, and her home.  ""The Enemy Below"" didn't give you much about any of the main characters, but it did develop Aquaman immensely as a guest star.  I'll buy any of these on DVD.",1015027200,10,1006,4.632768361581921
1675542,1,B00005Y71H,"To say the new Justice League is better than SuperFriends is NOT saying much...
However, the show is FAR short of the excellence that characterized the earlier DC Heroes shows of the 1990s (Batman, Superman, and Batman Beyond).
While there are seven main characters in the show, there is NO EXCUSE for the short shrift given to developing the character's personalities.  Basically, they have NO LIVES and appear to live in spandex 24 hours a day!  Heck, Batman was written better on a recent episode of Static Shock than he's been portrayed in Justice League thus far.
The voice acting is VERY wooden on the show.  As well cast as the earlier shows were, it appears the casting directors were or other authorities ultimately in charge of casting the character voices were asleep at the wheel!  Especially bad are the voices of Superman (who is sadly no longer voiced by Tim Daly who was excellent in the previous Superman animated series) and The Flash who consistently manages to be the dullest voice each episode.  The animation is equally as wooden.  Sure, it's being done on a TV budget and you can't expect Disney feature quality, but the earlier shows had a sheen and visual punch that Justice League fails to deliver.
I wish I could say the show has gotten better since the mediocre pilot episode released on the DVD, but sadly this is not the case.
I, too, am a big fan of these characters, but so far they have NOT been done justice in any media outside of a few -- VERY few -- good comic books.  It would have been better if this show had NOT been produced.  It has no heart.",1012003200,12,1585,4.536842105263158
1675543,5,B00005Y71H,"Wow! I was simply amazed by this series when it first premiered on Cartoon Network. Combining the personages of the world's greatest superheroes, Secret Origins Parts 1-3 introduces the team and introduces a threat that no one superhero can tackle. Any fan of the 1970's show ""Superfriends"" or of the comic books series in which these characters star will love and appreciate the intricacies and nuances of a team that, from this perspective, is off to an exciting start. A definite must see, the Justice League premiere is not only a great stand-alone movie, it introduces the world to a new and ongoing series on Cartoon Network AND is a great collectible! I say, if they keep making 'em this caliber, the golden age for comic fans has truly arrived.",1011744000,4,752,4.792307692307692
1675544,4,B00005Y71H,"It all started in the late thirties. First, there was mild-mannered Clark Kent as Superman. Then came brooding, millionarie Bruce Wayne as Batman. As the decades went by, DC Comics added to their roster of popular superheroes; Wonder Woman, Flash, and many others. Now for the first time, they've all come together under one name, one show: Justice League.
Okay, this isn't the *first* time. Originally Hanna-Barbara came out with a Justice-League show called 'Superfriends', but that was more of a fanboy's worst nightmare. Justice League (JL) is the latest creation of Bruce Timm, who was one of the major talents behind the award-winning Batman: The Animated Series, Superman, and Batman Beyond. Using the same stylized animation and feel of their past shows, JL is actually the first story arc of the new series. Here, Jonn Jon'z (Martian Manhunter) is introduced, and leads Earth's heroes on a quest to prevent an alien invasion.
In all fairness, JL isn't as good as Timm's previous shows, but thats because it has to balance seven main characters, each with their own unique powers and personalities. We know a good deal about Batman and Superman, but that's only because they've had entire shows for character development. The episode is basically about Jonn Jon'z, so we learn a lot about him. The Flash is a wise-cracking joker, but we don't know too much about him, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, or Wonder Woman. Not to worry though, later episodes go more in-depth.
So is this DVD worth picking up? Absolutely. The series is great, and can only get better as the season progresses. There's no better way to get in on the ground floor.",1011484800,10,1640,4.924187725631769

The only problem with it then was I never knew what time it would be on; they changed it's time-slot all the time. But that is on the Cartoon Network, not on the producers & directors & actors of the show. So now that it is on dvd, I can watch it at my leisure.

Although parts of Starcrossed are weaker than later episodes in the series, namely superman being beaten too easily, it is a great intro for people who are curious about the series. If you aren't sure about it even after  watching these first 3 episodes, the whole series is now available on netflix. Personally I recommend the whole season 1 and 2 disc packs over just getting a few episodes here and there but its still a great start to one of the best superhero shows ever made.",1365897600,,515,4.4787234042553195

1675625,5,B00005Y71H,"I'm a great fan of ""Batman: The Animated Series"" and ""Superman: The Animated Series"", but had never seen ""Justice League"" before. I was familiar with ""Superfriends"" which I use to watch as a kid, but that was very much just a kids show. But knowing that ""Justice League"" was a spin-off of the ""Batman"" and ""Superman"" shows, I knew that it would be a little more adult in its plot and characterization of the characters, but when I was watching this I thought they had turned a serious science-fiction movie into a series science-fiction cartoon drama. It was very dramatic. Not a thing usually seen in a cartoon series. This was more serious and dramatic than the ""Batman"" and Superman"" shows that came before it. I loved every moment of it. It's very action-packed, it's got a good plot, and some scenes really got to me even as an adult. ""Justice League"" is great for both kids and adults. My 60-year-old dad even liked it.

The Plot:

Astronauts awaken an ancient evil on Mars that puts the entire Earth in jeopardy. Batman is investigating strange activities at Wayne Tech in Metropolis, and with Superman's help, they uncover a sinister alien plot to invade the Earth. A friendly alien, Martian Manhunter, helps Batman and Superman battle the alien invaders, but even that isn't enough to stop them. Eventually Wonder Woman, the Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, and the Flash join in on the battle. But even with the world's greatest Superheroes, can the invaders be stopped? A combination of ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" with Superman, Batman, and other heroes thrown into the mix. A great action-packed adventure.

Highly recommended!",1294272000,,1661,4.882978723404255

1675627,2,B00005Y71H,"It's an interesting time if you are a cartoon lover.  We now have CGI playing an ever-increasing role in the genre and if indications of the success of ""Chicken Little"" and ""Cars"" is anything to go by, it looks like 2-D images like we get here are on the way out pretty soon.  I guess as we already have quite a decent Spider-man out on CGI, it's only a matter of time before all cartoons including the DC characters get onto the bandwagon as well.

As for this disc, I was pretty disappointed.  Although the sound quality was pretty good, the storyline is pretty lame and the overall running of the movie was just too short to do justice (pun intended) to the development of each character's ""secret origins.""  In fact, we only get to see Wonder Woman and the Martian Manhunter's origins unless they are talking about the origin of the Justice League in which case, what's so secret about that?

Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse, we have virtually nada on the Special Features side of things.  All in all, quite a high price to pay for a dvd that barely runs over an hour and with little bonus features.",1156032000,3,1123,4.4487804878048784
1675628,4,B00005Y71H,"Recovering from an auto accident and got hooked on the Batman animated series.  Have all three volumes.  Saw the review in Wizard magazine where they listed BAS, Superman and JL in the top 10 cartoons of all times.  They were right.  The BAtman series  dark/art deco artwork, the plots... all beautiful and targeted for adults.  However, I am having a hard time following up on the other works of Superman, Justice Leaque.  Seen a few and all good work, but I am not able to follow which is first, second, beginning etc.  Seems like they just put any episode on a dvd and published it.  Will just rent for now.  I absolutely hate buying a DVD and finding out I already have it in an anthology.  The Batman series was great, well labeled and the episodes enjoyable as they built on the previous story.  Why can't they do the same with the other series.  It must be a DC thing.  They don't label their graphic novels either.  You never know which one you are reading.  Hey, take a page from Marvel.

I'd actually forgotten all about the Justice League cartoons, I used to watch them after school almost every day at my friends house. Pretty good stuff, though I would also suggest renting this title instead of buying it because it is pretty pricey for the length.

1675641,1,B00005Y71H,"It's an understatement that many of us feel ripped off by WB's attempt to unfairly empty our wallets. If we refuse to buy these horribly priced episode dvds and at the same time purchase the available full season box sets that are of value then we can make some headway. They are in the business of making $$$. Slowing their cash flow will force them to give us consumers' products we demand or risk losing our disposable income. Die-hard fans of this series and other series must convince every parent to withhold from purchasing these dvds until full seasons are made available. C'mon WB, we love these shows and will pay for them. We only ask that you don't rape our wallets. Give us the full season box sets much sooner.",1110412800,4,724,4.534351145038168
1675642,3,B00005Y71H,"Justice league Secret Origins contains the three part story line where the Justice league came together for the very first time.  The world has turned over its protection to Superman and disarmed.  Now an alien race called the Imperium has decided that Earth would make a good colony for them and begin converting our atmosphere for their arrival.  Superman and Batman rescue a Martian who has come to earth to warn the world about the invading aliens.  This of course would be the powerful, shape-changing Martian Manhunter.

Soon the trio would be joined by several other of earths heroes including the Flash, Green lantern, Wonder Woman, and Hawk Girl as they eventually defeat the alien threat and the Justice League of America is born.  Very enjoyable storyline with the animation quality we've come to expect from Warners.  The voice talents are outstanding as usual and include Mark Hamill, Phil La Marr, Michael Rosenbaum, Gary Cole, Clancy Brown, and James Remarr.

The problem is why isn't Warners giving us the season one on DVD?  I mean $12 or so for 3 episodes and just 60 minues is really weak.  Add to that there's basically no extras you get a set that has very little value for the money.  Hopefully they will wake up and give us a set with at least 15 to 20 episodes on it with solid extras.",1106870400,3,1309,4.672489082969432
1675643,3,B00005Y71H,"I haven't watched this type of program since the late `60s, early `70s.  I have fond memories of most DC comic heroes and was curious to see how they've evolved in one-plus generations.

  My first impression was that the acceptable, if unspectacular, animation is much better than it was in the earlier incarnation, especially the backgrounds.  Took me a while to get used to the exaggerated physiques and lunch-bucket jaws on the super heroes, especially Superman and Batman.

  The story in JUSTICE LEAGUE is interesting and involving.  Earth is invaded by an army from Mars who plan to block out the sun, subjugate the human race and take over the Earth for some nefarious reason or other.  The writers cribbed a lot from H.G. Wells and a bit from latter-day science fiction to cobble this one together.  The invaders speak tinny squeak talk and look like marshmallow blobs studded with nougats.  A worthy test for this newly formed super hero league if ever there was one.

 There's enough action to keep the kids interested and there's story enough to keep the adults quiet in their seats, as well.",1100217600,13,1104,4.803191489361702
1675644,5,B00005Y71H,"There has been some disturbing reviews about the appearances and powers of the heros. For one thing, Wonder Woman is supposed to be taller than most of the men, she's an Amazon, she's not an oridinary human female. She also could fly in her original comic series, but later was reduced to long jumping in the TV series incarnation(Who's Who in the DC Universe, #4. Written by Mark Waid-DC Comics). Secondly, Superman is rather weak in a sense, he's defeated with just kyrptonite, but I can't agree with the reviewer who says the show portrays him as weak. On the contrary, the show portrays him to be rather arrogantly powerful because it is mostly him, who at the end of the day is strong enough and has the most indepth power to save the day. And that's the on-going machismo bickering that he and Batman battle with on nearly every episode as to whom can outwit and outmatch whom. Thirdly, I am disgusted to see a reviewer comment that Hawkgirl and the ""black"" Green Lantern are forced minorities? Have you not read DC comics Green Lantern series? The Green Lantern's powers were transfered into John Stewart in the early 70's premiering on January 1972 to be exact, so this character is not just a made up version of the Green Lantern--he has been this hero for the past 32 years. People if you are going to comment on this series...PLEASE know what you are talking about, because it makes you look foolish and it it does not help potential buyers who may shy away from buying this wonderful series.",1090713600,12,1503,4.591078066914498

There is an open respect from the creators for the characters and for the intelligence of the audience. This origin episode was a must have, but I have to confess that I have not purchased the other two because I am anxious for a boxed set of the entire seasons 1-2. The price of $16.00 for four episodes is a bit steep when considering what  comparable boxed set would cost. C'mon, Warner Brothers, get on the stick!

This movie was perfect for the kind of people who are going to watch it, and maybe even perfect for the people who happen to catch it on TV some night when they're surfing channels. If the DVD doesn't have a lot of extras, so what? The movie makes up for it.
It's a perfect introduction for the show, which really hooks you with it's cliphangers, comedy, and great animation. Bravo to Bruce Timm and the rest of the people behind the show.
The only thing that I may have added to it, although it wasn't totally necessary, is where Flash, Green Lantern, and Hawkgirl came from- for the newer fans. Otherwise, the movie has great scenes, perfect dialogue and a fine storyline.  Plus, it's pretty much appropriate for all audiences.

If you liked either of those shows, I suspect you'll really like this show as well.  The three segments here (originally broadcast as a 90 minute special on the Cartoon Network) are needed to cover the ""origins"" stories of the League and to give any kind of detail at all to the number of characters the story focuses on.  The voice characterizations are excellent, and the animation is sharp, and I think the storytelling is well done.  Yes, the plot suffers some dilution due to the number of characters they have to cover, but nevertheless, this is an enjoyable story.
The DVD is fairly standard stuff, without anything special in the way of extras, which is disappointing but not terribly surprising.  Warner always needs a kick in the pants to give their animated products the support they deserve, and they haven't gotten it yet.  It is nice to have it without commercials and it is reasonably priced.  I recommend this DVD.",1059004800,,1050,4.736263736263736

Hawkgirl and the black Green Lantern look fine but they seem forced, like token minority superheroes. On top of it all, the stories, backgrounds and villains are dull and predictable; second-best at the most.
Too bad, and certainly not what was expected from Bruce Timm, Paul Dini and their great animation studio. I dunno; it appears their new productions have run out of steam (or money). If so, go pester the people at Warner! Have them take another look at BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM and get inspired again, not just milk the supercow!!!",1059004800,,940,4.703030303030303

1675661,4,B00005Y71H,"Perhaps the best aspect of this movie has to be the introduction of major players in the DC universe (notably Wonder Woman and the Martian Manhunter) who had hitherto been absent in either the 1990's WB Batman or Superman series.
Backed by a strong plot, the movie (titled ""Secret Orgins""; originally a three part story) explores the manner by which Superman draws his fellow superheroes into a unified team for the purpose to protect the planet.  The backstories of Diana [a.k.a] Wonder Woman and J'onn Jonzz [a.k.a] Martian Manhunter are revealed throughout the course of the story.  Intriguing character relationships are introduced (i.e. the Flash and Green Lantern) and the series' intergalactic setting is introduced.
It is unfortunate, however, that more special features were not included on this disc (beyond the standard trailers and character profiles).  Especially missed was commentary featuring series creator Bruce Timm included on previous Batman and Superman DVD discs.

These dumb writers have managed to completely destroy Superman in the past decade.

He started to grunt when he lifted heavy objects, he started to gasp and clench himself in pain when he got shot, and now.. he has the voice of Mark Hammill on helium. Since when can wonder woman fly? Since when was The Green Lantern a black guy? Since when were writers replaced with utter morons with no knowledge of what they're writing about in the first place. You would think it would be a prerequisite for writing a script of this magnitude to actually know what the Hell you're doing. They did a good job on Batman and Flash, I'll give them that.. but all the other characters were poorly conceived.
In despite of all the numerous flaws, this movie wasn't *too* terrible. I did like when it ended, after all.",1046304000,,1045,4.684782608695652

I say ""however far..."" because I am not quite sure myself if the creators want to continue with the show or not.

It was good that the people who worked with the animated Superman and Batman was on hand to work on Justice League.  This isn't your old Superfriends and boy I'm glad it isn't.  Don't get me wrong the old Superfriends for its time was good and but this is a new era and some stories should be retold, as long as its retold correctly.
The debut of this series follows Batman, Superman,Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash, Hawkgirl and the Martian Manhunter whom the story is bulit around and the alien threat that made me wonder how the Justice League would put an end to it.  This isn't a lightweight story it is by far an all-around solid story with solid characters and action.

Timm has previously worked on projects such as the hugely influential and Emmy award winning 'Batman: The Animated Series', 'Batman Beyond' and several animated Batman feature lengths. 'Justice League' takes a step back from the dark environment and stories in 'Batman: TAS' and brings a fresh, colourful take on the JLA (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash and Hawk Girl). The series main audience is children but don't let that put you off because there is a lot here for adults that most children wouldn't get and the stories are entertaining. The animation and voice talent is excellent as you would expect from a Bruce Timm show, although Wonder Woman can sound bored or detatched at times. Other than that my only other complaint is that Batman is often away from the action and the rest of the team and has lost some of the dark charm displayed in previous shows and the comic books. The series improved after being sanctioned for a full season with characters and stories both developing but this is a good introduction to the show and is enjoyable for both children and adults, especially comic book fans.

I would first point out that I have not watched the series, but, having been a fan of the animated Batman series and the JLA books, I decided to buy this without watching first. Big mistake. This movie is a clear case of what happens when people do a half-assed job of translating an excellent comic book to a show. First off, why is the Green Lantern so boring? He is a real jerk and he seems to have no imagination either. Why does he even have a ring that can do anything he can imagine if all he can imagine is a laser beam or a shield? A true waste. The characters of the other JLA-ers aren't too bad, although Batman becomes a lame characterization (as opposed to how he is portrayed in the superior series he is the star of) who delivers lines such as he does at the end of the movie. Superman, Wonder Woman and the crew decide to be the JLA and Batman says ""I'm not much of a people person, but if you need help, and you will, I'll be there."" This is the lamest way to show that Batman isn't quite sure what to think of the whole superhero thing. I think this bothers me the most because Batman is so complicated and here, he is so wooden. And the voice talent is awful. Wonder Woman sounds bored.
Overall, this is a piece of garbage. Hopefully, the show is better, but I think I will pass and watch something else.

The pilot more than lived up to my expectations. The plot was not entirely original (invading tripods from Mars, anyone?) but it was riveting nevertheless. In 60 minutes, you get a pretty clear idea of the characterisation of each of the seven superheroes making up this version of the Justice League. Having always been a great Wonder Woman fan, I was surprised to discover the my favorite character in the pilot was not her, but Hawkgirl. She certainly wields that mace to great effect! She reminds me of Big Barda with a mace instead of Barda's power rod.
I would have liked the series to use the REAL big seven - Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner), Flash, Aquaman and Martian Manhunter - but I can understand the need for diversity by putting in one other female character and an African American one as well. Will we ever get to see an Asian superhero? Kimiyo (Dr. Light) would be a good choice.
All in all, a very good romp indeed. I would recommend it to anyone who loves DC comics.",1021420800,7,1268,4.517391304347826

Then I have to remember the time frame inwhich the cartoon was showing, the '70's. Being an artist, the new version of JL is sharp, crisp and the 3D effect at the beginning of each show is awesome!! Plus each character has his and her own personality. The animation is great. I like it when there is an alien invasion as the main story. The characters have their jobs cut out for them. My only problem is why did they make Superman so weak?? I have been a superman fan for years and he is not as powerful as he has been in the past or in the comic books. I notice in the last several episodes of the Superman animated series on WB he did not wear the space suit in space nor under water, plus he seemed a little bit more stronger. Overall I think the whole concept of the new version of JL is great! I notice in the new generation of cartoons you start to see various ethnic groups were in the past you didn't.

I wonder if Warner Bros. will release another version in the future, just as they re-released BATMAN BEYOND: RETURN OF THE JOKER?
The story is solid, the tweaks on the character designs are interesting (even the enlongated ears on Batman's costume), and it is fun to see the animated version of the DC Universe expanded even further. If this story lacks the verve and wit of the animated Batman series, it nonetheless offers solid entertainment. Other animated series would do well to follow the model presented by the Timm-designed animated DC heroes.",1020988800,,730,5.041322314049586
1675704,4,B00005Y71H,"Nicely done!  The colorful animation, Dolby Surround Sound, and clarity that can come only from a DVD make this a real treat.  Very different from the awesome Batman and Batman Beyond works, but solid in its own right.  I think the Justice League is more appropriate for youngsters than Batman Beyond:  The Return of the Joker.
One thing that makes team-based superhero movies (Justice League, X-Men) not quite as good as single or dual superhero movies (Superman, Batman, Batman and Robin) is that there just isn't time to develop the relationships between the characters and the characters' own personalities.  Because there are so many characters competing for ""scenes and dialog,"" there isn't enough time to do all the characters justice (no pun intended).
This movie was fine, but true enjoyment of this well done adaptation of DC Comics' counterpart to Marvel's ""Avengers"" will come from regularly tuning in to the series on TV.  If the writers do their jobs, they will make Justice League appealing to both youngsters and older geeks, and tolerable for the youngsters' frazzled parents.  The TV series should give the creators and writers enough time to do a good job blending lots of action and good animation with character development and interaction.
Think of other ""team-based"" series that have hit it big.  From the original Star Trek and its newer offspring, to Friends, part of the enjoyment derived is watching relationships develop over time.  Let's hope that the same will be said of Justice League two or three seasons from now.

1675729,4,B00005Y71H,"After the success of its Batman, Superman, and Batman Beyond cartoons, it was only a matter of time before Bruce Timm and the rest of the Warner Brothers animated unit tackled the DC superhero team known as the Justice League.  Created for the Cartoon Network, this DVD covers the hour-long premiere episode which introduces the superteam.  In order to protect Earth from an alien invasion, Batman, Superman and new ally Martian Manhunter must enlist the help of some of their fellow crimefighters to stave off the threat. But can the heroes mesh their rather different personalities in time to work as a team before it's too late?  Despite having to juggle 7 main characters, JUSTICE LEAGUE proves to be another feather in Warner Brothers' cap. As always, the animation is especially vivid and the voice acting is solid. By now, Kevin Conroy can voice Batman in his sleep, but he still turns in a definitive turn in the role.  Michael Rosenbaum (aka Lex Luthor in TV's SMALLVILLE) is fun as the smart-alecky Flash.  Carl Lumbley (Jennifer Garner's agent partner on TV's ALIAS) is appropriately enigmatic as the Martian Manhunter. Obviously, because of the more globe-trotting/space-hopping nature of the series, this series is a tad brighter in tone from BATMAN:THE ANIMATED SERIES. But Timm and Co. never talks down to the audience.  As a result, we get a series that provides solid entertainment.  Despite the rather skimpy DVD features, this is definitely something for the comic-book hero fan to enjoy.  Definitely recommended.",1020211200,13,1532,5.075697211155378

1675731,3,B00005Y71H,"In general, I love Bruce Timm's rendition of the DC comics characters, but for some reason in this new series, he decided
to severely weaken Superman, Green Lantern and the Martian Manhunter and greatly strengthened Batman and Wonder Woman (Since when is Wonder Woman as strong as Superman and can fly...?). Superman seems to get knocked out by just about anything more powerful than a 9 volt battery, and there's never a mention of his super speed, which they showed in a Superman episode featuring the Flash that they were just about equal. They did make the Flash a little tougher than they did in his premiere on Superman, but he still is not using all of his vibration/molecular control powers. Here's a hint... they ALL don't have to be the same power level!!!
As far as the DVD itself, I was hoping it would at least have interviews with the cast, but it had nothing special whatsoever.

Justice League is every bit as beautifully animated as its predecessors. The simple, clean style is what makes it work.
The best thing about Justice League is its double entendre. The humor, plot and action can be appreciated by an adult viewer, while say, a three to six-year-old enjoys just watching the good guys beat up the bad!
These versions of the Justice League, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, J'onn J'onzz, Hawkgirl, and the Flash, differ quite a bit from their comic book versions but the essence of each character has been maintained. Kevin Conroy's familiar voice serves as Batman and the other six Leaguers are new voice talents, although I recognize some of them from other bit parts in the Batman and Superman animated series.
The DVD version of Justice League doesn't have much in the way of special features, but it's priced appropriately. I enjoy it anyway for the enhanced sound over our stereo system. Gives the show the cinematic effect it deserves!",1019952000,5,1120,4.962765957446808
1675733,3,B00005Y71H,"Well, definitely in this case, the Justice League was a much better animated show than the crappy Avengers that was released several years ago on Fox network. Now, I'm not saying that the Justice League has been perfect, but it does have potential as writers smooth out the cast. It definitely has a nice mix of personalities and choices for its characters. I'm pretty sure I've seen so many detractors of why Hawkgirl was included before the show who turned completely around after seeing her no nonsense attitude after the show's debut. And it's always a jewel for me that the team's got a Green Lantern who has always been my favorite book and hero no matter who wears the ring. I'd rate the show a 4 star show. It's good and has potential to be better, but I'm only giving the dvd a 3 star rating cause like always, the WB puts out a very low key dvd. Not much extras are ever included in the animated releases. I'm just thankful they released the Justice League before the original prints deteriorated over time. It's kinda sad to watch the Batman/Superman animated movie and see it in the poor quality shape it's in now on dvd. They could've tooked the time to remaster it as I'd be willing to pay a few extras bucks for a copy that was brighter and clearer than the one they just released.

1675734,4,B00005Y71H,"As the ads for the original comic book said, Just Imagine! Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and more on one team. Well, actually as a child of 1970s, I can imagine it quite easily. On TV, it was called The Superfriends. But in the comics, these heroes were The Justice League. Now, they are back!
  This DVD is the first three episodes of a new cartoon series which at the moment isn't being shown in my country of Canada.
  First the good, the cartoon is exciting. It's a fast-moving plot -- which as others have stated owes a debt to Wells's War of the Worlds (as well as some Justice League comic books, where the invaders were White Martians and Apellaxians.)
 For an action-driven movie, the character interplay is very good. Flash is an impulsive joker, Green Lantern a military type, Hawkgirl a fierce warrior. Relatively simple characterization but they blend fairly well.
  And I like the composition of the team. With several Green Lanterns to choose from, they picked John Stewart. I see that a former reviewer complained about this. Well, essentially, GL is just a name and a power. So, why not pick the black (or African American, as Americans say) one? The same with Hawkgirl? I really don't see the big deal here. It makes sense. After all, Kryptonians and Thanagarians and Martians --- well, that really isn't diversity.
  My problems? Well, the plot is a bit thin. I think this comes from being a ""widescreen"" (well, full frame in this case) epic battle. But the bigger problem? I know who John Stewart is (originally a social activist with a chip on his shoulder, and an architect). I know who the Wally West Flash is. But I doubt the non-comics reader does. Sure, the DVD has a character bio section. But I think with newcomer Wonder Woman, someone could have given her a brief description of the heroes. It's called Secret Origins, but really, the only origin we get is J'Onn J'Onnz's origin. I'm not even sure anyone ever calls Green Lantern by his superhero name once.
  But if their names don't come through, their characters do. Much more sharply than they did on the old Superfriends.
  Still... my biggest problem? That it doesn't contain all those cool adventures I've been hearing about? Manhunters? The Injustice Gang? A Pseudo-Earth 2? Metamorpho? Bring them on!
  Oh, and as for the person who said this was DC's answer to the X-Men? Well, the Justice League came first.",1019779200,27,2399,4.719424460431655

One would not even suspect the creators' initial apprehension of approaching such a grand project as representing a whole team of classic heroes for a new audience of potential fans (as well as those who were raised on the ""SuperFriends"").
With such praise and self-evident merit, it is disappointing that Warner Bros. would opt to employ their traditional, minimalistic philosophy in the DVD format.
