3029970,4,B000YJH46K,"Perhaps Liberace has received more attention lately  after the cable special, Behind the Candelabra, recently aired.  If so, Liberace's Christmas special adds a different perspective, focusing solely on the performer, capturing his  enthusiasm, showmanship, and desire to reach his fans. He  even speaks directly into the camera, going beyond traditionally filmed piano performances of the period. He occasionally even demonstrates his singing skills.

And there are hints of the excessive special effects that became more pronounced as time went on. The film is in black and white so the stage sets don't have full impact. But I'm guessing they would have been quite something in color.

I have to admit that i was never a huge fan of Liberace's over the top (to say the least) style. I felt ambivalent about his performances.  No matter how showy they were, was he still helping audiences gain familiarity with classical and other compositions, ones they might not be open to hearing otherwise? Or was he detracting from true appreciation of the music with his personality, stage sets, and unabashedly campy style?

But - debate aside-  I WAS fascinated by his popularity and charisma, particularly with the women who were the majority of those who attended his shows. I got a chance to witness this at a sold- out performance in Liberace's later years.

Comparing the two time periods of Liberace's performing years (early and later), the DVD  doesn't completely reveal the more flamboyant style of Liberace's later years....mainly because it was a style that evolved over time. When I saw him perform,  he had women gasping and clapping when he appeared in outfits so sparkly and dazzling that they were nearly blinding. He also cracked jokes that resonated with his audiences.  It was amazing to see his almost hypnotic appeal.

But at least this DVD should allow viewers to catch a glimpse of Liberace's trademark style. No substitute for a live performance but perhaps the next best thing. For more examples, check out clips from The Liberace Show, when he performed on television in he 50s.",1369612800,4,2098,5.061046511627907

8233019,5,B000YJH46K,"Judging by some of the comments, it's a good idea to make it clear that this is a 1950s era show filmed with a live audience for later broadcast on TV, which means 1) it's in black and white 2) the show consists of well played music and an engaging performer 3) it was customary for performers to speak directly to their audience during the show -both the one in the studio and the one at home watching later on TV.  People who grew up with ultra HD digitalized everything and expect to see that, in color, with fireworks/special effects galore will probably be bored.  If you're one of them but want to see what the rest of us grew up enjoying, if you are older and remember such programming with fondness, if you love the music and don't care about the rest, you'll probably enjoy this and other Liberace shows from the era.  Since I recall watching Liberace (and Lawrence Welk, and the like) with my grandmother, I am one of those who doesn;t need color film or ultra digitalized anything or special effects to have fun watching the show.  Liberace was musically gifted and very personable with the audience, which comes across quite well in this double segment from the show. It was great!  ;D",1482624000,,1197,4.497695852534562

Alas, this is one Christmas program followed by one Mother's Day program, and, disappointingly, the programs are half an hour each. They just barely get started and it seems like that they are over already. But these two programs are worth five stars IF, and this is a big IF for some people, you can ignore the stories about his personal life which only came to light years later..

I prefer to watch programs like this with an open mind, and with my memories of what he must have accomplishment with his misical embellishments and arrangements.

Liberace introduced many people to the classics. His flamboyancy made him a popular performer (and certainly increased his live audiences and viewing audiences). How many people graduated from his piano programs to symphony concerts, we will never know.

My family watched his specials because our mother was a classical pianist, and had been a member of the 1940's Melodear Trio that traveled the eastern half of the United States. I fondly remember waking up in the morning to her piano concerts, live, drifting up the stairs from the living room.

I highly recommend these two programs to you.",1443657600,,1269,4.888372093023256
