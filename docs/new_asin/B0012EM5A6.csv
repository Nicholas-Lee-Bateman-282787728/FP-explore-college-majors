this begins at the start of his literary career - as if the viewer would be too impatient to suffer thru his early years - that part of his life is no more or less as interesting as it can be since it describes a man who wrote adventures while living the comfortable  lifestyle of the nouveau riche

at 30 minutes - the documentary switches to a timeline account starting with his birth - tho i don't recall if they mentioned the year he was born - then we learn of the hardships of his life - which came when he was a young adult after he had married and had children - he struggled - like many Americans - to make ends meet - but hardly in an adventurous way

it's clear that Burroughs stories came out of his fantasies - his life doesn't explain much about them - however the racial supremacy found in his stories does parallel his real life attitudes - as just one example - after the attack on Pearl Harbor - he sought to have Japanese-Americans deported

as a Japanese-American - now i have a motive other than the cheap reputation that stamps his writing to avoid reading his works",1325289600,,1190,4.247787610619469
