8740734,1,B017V5YYDU,"Finally had an opportunity to sit down to watch this with my daughter.  She had asked for this as a bday gift.
So disappointing to discover that there was NOTHING to watch on the DVD. Only the opening menu then a black screen after multiple attempts. I will need to repurchase but not from Amazon.
Epic fail!",1528243200,,308,4.4035087719298245
8740735,1,B017V5YYDU,Don't waste your money. The movie does not play. The menu is like the kind you see when you put together a dvd of home movies on your computer. This is not a professionally produced dvd.,1509840000,,186,4.194444444444445
8740736,1,B017V5YYDU,not the best quality rendition of the original Nosferatu.,1495324800,,57,5.444444444444445
8740737,1,B017V5YYDU,"Stay away from it. Bought two copies, one for myself and one for my daughter. NEITHER played properly. Don't waste your money, look for this from a different DVD manufacturer.",1484265600,,175,4.866666666666666
8740738,1,B017V5YYDU,The first 20 minutes of the movie was missing,1479168000,,45,4.111111111111111
8740739,1,B017V5YYDU,"I originally ordered this product, and when played it did not start properly. I had to fast forward to 20 minutes or so before the movie started...and it did not start from the beginning of the movie but, mid-way through. I wrote to Amazon about the issue and they sent me a replacement in a matter of days, which I was happy about. The second dvd did not have ANY menu or ANY video on it at all! I now am awaiting a refund. Needless to say...STAY AWAY!",1477872000,2,453,4.159090909090909
8740740,5,B017V5YYDU,I have always loved this film. It's a classic and has been a reference point to so many Dracula films. This version is clear and digitally enhanced. Loved it. Great cover!,1460592000,2,171,4.548387096774194
