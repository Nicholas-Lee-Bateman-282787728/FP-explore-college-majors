I ordered it on February 12th, and it arrived on March 5th, which is pretty fast for where it came from! The seller packaged it very nicely and I also got a free anime (the whole series, at that!), so I'm very satisfied! (: Thank you!",1457308800,,356,4.173913043478261
8731515,3,B014Q32UV8,"I have played and beaten the first corpse party game so I was more than shocked when everything was different.  The following is possibly a major *spoiler*
I will not go into great detail but only two people survive in the anime where five people survive in the game.  This was a major disappointment to me but other than that the anime was intense.
If you want a good horror anime with lots and I mean LOTS of blood and gore this is it. If you have a weak stomach this anime is not for you.....",1454284800,,495,4.145833333333333
