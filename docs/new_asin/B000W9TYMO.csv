8221935,4,B000W9TYMO,This Movie Is So Terrible Its Hilarious. Anyone Who Likes Bad Movies Or Furries Will Adore This Odd Gem.,1258329600,,104,4.526315789473684
8221936,1,B000W9TYMO,"I am not sure what film most of the reviewers on this page were watching. Pretty well-acted and filmed given the time constraints, but frankly, there's no narrative I can make sense of whatsoever.. I guess the most charitable I can be is just to assume that they didn't have time to finish shooting, and decided they'd just make do?

Don't waste your time, this isn't even bad in the funny way, it's just seven confusing minutes with a handful of snappy dialog. Ten dollars? Really??",1235520000,,483,4.616279069767442
8221937,1,B000W9TYMO,"It's not worth the money. From other reviews I thought that this dvd contained a well formulated story line. Well it wasn't. It's seven minutes of silly home movie style nonsense, and very little to no story line. If you enjoy watching amature college style stories, editing, acting, ect... then this is the movie for you. How this won an award I will never know. Personally I've taken film classes and have seen better films then this by other students. Also, if you're interested in learning about the furry life style this movie is not for you.",1232755200,4,547,4.649484536082475
8221938,5,B000W9TYMO,"""Fur Love of the Game"" played to a packed house at the Free Range Film Festival in Wrenshall, Minnesota. The audience loved it! (And so did I.) There really isn't another film quite like it in the whole wide world. Buy it today for someone you love.",1191196800,,249,4.319148936170213
8221939,5,B000W9TYMO,"This movie has much more going for it than a clever title.  If you like Panda costumes and heartwarming stories give this short a shot.  Bring it to parties and impress your friends with your obscure, and good, taste!!!!!",1190937600,,221,4.641025641025641
8221940,5,B000W9TYMO,"This film won the Audience Award at the 2007 Fargo 48 Hour Film Project with good reason.  Uproarious and poignant at the same time, 'Fur Love of the Game' is not only a must-see short film, but an instant classic among everyone who enjoys watching people in animal costumes attempt to play sports.",1190592000,,298,4.622641509433962
8221941,5,B000W9TYMO,Perhaps one of the most enjoyable 48 hour films ever made. Chronicles the panda plight of a nerdy librarian who harbors a crush on the world's most adorable security guard. Witty dialogue and lots of sports action.,1190592000,2,214,4.8108108108108105
