4504039,5,B004YZ3M16,"If you're a Beck fan, especially if you were blown away by Crazy Legs, this is the dream come true. HEre's JB doing the Gene Vincent thing with all the vintage gear and a great band. It took almost 20 years between Crazy legs and this, but now we get to see Jeff do IT",1297209600,,268,3.890909090909091
4504040,5,B004YZ3M16,"Really late last night i was flipping the channels and happen to see a 'rockabilly' concert going on at PBS. I stopped to watch awhile. I'm sure I had heard the singer before (Big Sandy?)....but who is that great guitarist next to him?  He sure looks a lot like Jeff Beck?  He plays blistering solos (short and compact, true to songs of the era) like Jeff Beck.
Jeff Beck is a rock/jazz fusion genius, it can't be him playing sideman on a rockabilly band?  Then they brought out this beautiful singer that looks a lot like Scarlett Johansen with a weird hair-do, and she beautifully sang 50's songs with what sounded like 2 of the Puppini Sisters. I wondered if I was dreaming?

Finally, they had a 'pledge break'...OMG! It WAS Jeff Beck!!! The singer is new to me; Imelda May, from Ireland.
You read the details above about the concert and the over-dubbing trick of Imelda. All I can add is that this was great, a lot of fun, and makes me appreciate these classic songs anew. I'm only bummed I have to wait to get the CD, and I'm on my way to find some Imelda May albums.",1296000000,17,1072,4.345

4504042,5,B004YZ3M16,"Les Paul was a bona fide genius.  I've played acoustic and electric guitar, as well as tenor and baritone sax (although nowhere near the level of the guys on this DVD), for many years so I know what kind of monster musicianship went into playing it.  In case you didn't know, Les Paul (and his friend Leo Fender, working separately and whose last name you should also recognize) had everything to do with the invention of the electric guitar.  In addition, Les Paul invented recording studio techniques that are still in use today.  Though the equipment has changed, those techniques are still the same. Everyone who uses a recording studio today -  including myself - is still using many of those same techniques today.

I first saw the edited PBS version and just HAD to buy the DVD.  Take it from an old-school rock'n'roller: I'm telling you THIS SHOW IS NOT TO BE MISSED!  The show was recorded on what would have been Les Paul's 95th birthday in 2010 in a tiny club in NYC.  You'll have a better seat than anyone who was actually at this invitation-only event.

The show features the amazing guitar work of Jeff Beck, the gorgeous Irish vocalist Imelda May, who, when she covers the 1950's Les Paul and Mary Ford records contained in the show, is a dead ringer for Mary Ford.  Ms. May did the same trick Ms. Ford did on the original Paul and Ford Records of the 1950's (one of Les Paul's many inventions) - she pre-recorded the harmony vocals on such songs as ""How High The Moon"", ""Mockingbird Hill"", ""Tiger Rag"" and more - and sang the lead vocal live with the band and the recorded harmony tracks - essentially singing harmony with herself.  Each of the guest artists came out in turn and did their stuff, and boy, did they do it UP!  The show features a great horn section for some of the tunes, such as the theme from ""Peter Gunn"", plus Brian Setzer, Gary U.S. Bonds and lots more.  If you're a fan of REAL rock 'n' roll, you are going to want this DVD or Blu-Ray disc in your collection...and you'll want to turn it up!!!",1295568000,62,2031,4.454054054054054
4504043,5,B004YZ3M16,"This past December I viewed this on my local PBS station.  This is well in advance of the official release of Feb 2011.  Regardless of this being a partial show it was great.  I can't imagine the full show being anything less than this.  I don't usually review something that has yet to be released, but made an exception here.  The mix of rock and roll with some pop classics of yesteryear was tremendous.  The Peter Gunn version was a blast with great solos.  The only negative thing I can say about this is that what I saw on TV does not match what's on this setlist for the DVD. As an example they did Shake Rattle and Roll on TV, but it's not listed here.  They never give you the full concert and I'll never know why. This is especially true with anything that aires on PBS.",1295049600,4,780,4.222972972972973
4504044,4,B004YZ3M16,"This show was broadcast on our local public T.V. channel. I imagine that was the case in many other states as well. Released yet or not, I'm guessing that many people saw the broadcast, some more than once, hence the ability to post a review like the the first person on this thread did. And for what it's worth, I agree with D.Perkins and  with that review. The ""Big Banding"" toward the end was a bit much. Still, a fine show and Brian Setzer smokes on guitar...Just my opinion.",1295049600,5,479,4.382022471910112
4504045,4,B004YZ3M16,"This event with Jeff Beck was recorded at the Iridium Club in New York, the same place the late great Les Paul held court each Monday. I was lucky to see one of these Les Paul mondays a few years ago and Jeff's tribute is entertaining and touching.

Jeff plays guitar, and I think he's the best player alive now. He is a innovator, crosses musical boundaries and definitions, plus is an incredible mimic: THE most stunning part of this session is his duet with Imelda May, performing the early Les Paul and Mary Ford hits in real time with that Les Paul sound. They prerecorded Imelda May's vocals and multiplied them to get the lush texture that was Mary's multi-track vocal signature.

[...]

PS: the less than 5 stars review is for the last third of the concert where everyone tries to ""big band."" The event and manages to just get loud. Not a reason to dismiss the whole event, but ""top this"" is a convention in any concert where they try to end on a ""high note.""",1294444800,35,967,4.391061452513966

4504088,5,B004YZ3M16,This wonderful release is twofold first you have the concert honoring the great Les Paul. The concert hosted by the great Jeff Beck is filled with Les Paul and some of those great rock & roll songs inspired by Les. What a great band and Imelda May is amazing. You can really see the greatness of Jeff his plays what is needed to serve the song rather them himself. What a wonderful treat this is thank God they went through the trouble to record this for dvd. Anybody who loves Les Paul and rock and roll this is for you. Now the concert is only half of it the extras are just as wonderful. A great interview with Jeff he also goes through showing and taljing about his guitars. Then the real treat Les and Jeff playing together live plus Les and his little black box. I also thought the interview with the film maker and those at the show (some of the giants of the rock scene) was a treat for me. Over all this is a obe of a kind show thank God they had the forethought to record it and make it available to us.,1395014400,,1013,4.121212121212121

4504090,4,B004YZ3M16,"I first saw this on PBS and got the video for my collection.  I hadn't seen Les Paul and Mary Ford on TV since I was a little -- and too young to understand really anything about them, except one great song which took hold in my memory over the years -- ""How High the Moon.""  Since watching this honorary documentary, it seems almost everything I see mentions Les Paul in one way or another -- from the conversations of Joe Bonamassa to (hello all you ""Red Dwarf"" fans out there) Dave Lister explaining to Rimmer how much he loved his ""Les Paul guitar.""  If not already, the so influential Les Paul should be included in Webster's dictionary.  The show also introduced me to Imelda May, who is a really fabulous singer in a great OMG time warp hairdo.  And if you watch closely, you can see the camera catch the intense eyes in the face of David Bowie in the back of the audience.  Bottom line -- all performers have created an historic show about a man in history well worth honoring.",1394150400,,985,4.355191256830601

It sounds very authentic, and it was obviously a labor of love for him to put this together. He performs songs associated with Les, and then more that aren't - tunes that he grew up with and found an opportunity to play. The band is great, the camera work is great, and it looks like it was a lot of fun - wish I'd been there! So this isn't Jeff doing what he usually does - this is a rare chance to see him paying homage to his influences.

Don't get me wrong. I love rockabilly but  remaining in that genre will limit her exposure world wide to millions that would love her singing other types of music.  I don't care what you sing,just keep singing girl.

Beck is masterful, a true virtuoso, but sometimes it sounds like I'm just sitting through a recital when listening to him, albeit a recital by a virtuoso. He's been impersonating himself for perhaps too long. Any student of the guitar has to study Beck, but that doesn't mean we all want to just sit back and enjoy him.",1383868800,,476,4.482758620689655

He rocks, he rolls, he mimics the old styles to a point and even throws in some modern phrasing (that can be a good thing or a bad thing).  The back up group is AMAZING, the female vocalist is great, every thing is smokin' along and on walks Brian Setzer who joins Jeff for a song, picks up his Gretsch puts it through the paces... and that's when I realized the Setzer just plain smoked Beck.  But, hey rockabilly is Setzer's forte and Beck was giving the genre' its proper respect.  Great show, don't get me wrong.  All the way around wonderful.

But regardless.....He impressed me with his ability to get way back to his roots.....before any fame or fortune; Playing Old Time Rock and Roll and Les Paul standards, when most men his age are in a rocking chair, Jeff Beck is in his Rockin' Chair, with a lady I had never heard of: Imelda May, an incredible talented lady.

This concert, recorded at the Iridium Jazz Club in New York in 2010, features a first class line-up of led by Darrel Higham on guitar and male vocals. Imelda May provides the female vocals with considerable aplomb and interesting explanations including examples of multi-tracking typical of the period. Guest artists, Brian Setzer, Trombone Shorty and Gary US Bonds all make valuable contributions to an evening of Rock delivered with impeccable style and skill by all concerned. Jeff takes a supportive role within the band supplying short riffs as appropriate and with telling effect.

Eagle Rock has provided a recording with involving camera work supported with crisp imaging. The sound is presented in excellent DTS 5.1, DD 5.1 and stereo.

This disc will give enormous pleasure to anyone to whom the program appeals and is a perfect example of Jeff Beck at the very top of his considerable game and supporting colleagues of a similar exalted calibre. For those purchasers this will be an unmissable 5 star release.",1346803200,3,1177,5.0

4504121,4,B004YZ3M16,"Famed guitar rocker Jeff Beck acknowledges that the first musician that influenced him was Les Paul who along with his wife Mary Ford had a successful hit machine in the 1950's and `60's.  Paul is also credited with several advances in the success of the electric guitar over many years.  Paul died in 2009 at the age of 94 but had performed regularly at a New York club called the Iridium Jazz Club.  On a Wednesday night in June, 2010, Beck gathered a cast of musicians in this tiny club to entertain those lucky enough to be in attendance including numerous celebs from the musical world.

Beck's primary band mates were an English rockabilly group, Darrel Higham (vocals/guitar) and the Enforcers.  They were also on Beck's previous video concert ""Live at Ronnie Scott's"" (2009).  New to this collaboration is a sensational singer by the name of Imelda May who I had first seen on one of the late night talk shows.  While Beck takes on the Les Paul role, May does the Mary Ford vocals complete with her own previously recorded harmonies, just as Ford had done.  Beck indicated later he picked out 8 songs he thought Paul and Ford were best known for.  They are all excellent, but perhaps 5 or 6 would have been enough.

May returns later in the show for the best two songs on this program.  Track 21 is entitled ""Walking in the Sand"" which is actually properly titled ""Remember (Walking in the Sand)"" and was a hit for The Shangra La's in 1964.  May and Beck just kill this song.  Right after that May takes on ""Please Mr. Jailer"" which was a hit by Rachel Sweet and featured in the film ""Cry Baby.""  In the John Waters 1990 movie Amy Locane lip synchs the song which also featured Johnny Depp who lip synchs the vocals of James Intveld.

Some other featured songs showing off Beck's nimble fingers include the theme from TV's ""Peter Gunn"" series, ""Apache"" popular in England by The Shadows and in the U. S. by The Ventures in the late 1950's and ""Sleep Walk"" in the same era, a chart topper by brothers Santo and Johnny.  The stage gets some short visits on a couple songs by Trombone Shorty, Gary ""U. S."" Bonds and Brian Setzer.

The extras are worth checking out.  There is a weird PBS interview with Beck where the interviewer and Beck never appear on camera at the same time.  It seemed staged and the journalist was pretty lame except for her nice smile.  For guitar junkies, there is a feature where Beck goes through his guitar collection.  Best of all there are a couple performances with Les Paul and Jeff Beck jamming on some blues in a 1983 feature called ""Rock `N' Roll Tonight.""  The primary concert runs 87 minutes with another 77 minutes in the bonus features.

The Blu ray transfer is in 1080i not 1080p but certainly looks fine to me.  Some may find the features are not quite as sharp but come on this is a small club concert.  Who cares? The audio does feature a great DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track in addition to the LPCM Stereo and lossy Dolby Digital 5.1.  Crank it up and let it rock.",1344124800,5,3012,4.470695970695971
4504122,5,B004YZ3M16,"Very enjoyable music concert DVD. (Also available in CD.) I especially enjoyed the great guitar playing of Jeff Beck (one of the very best) and the wonderful singing and voice of Imelda May.  Imelda May's band is also excellent. Some great songs too.

Rock and Roll, blues, rockabilly and jazz.  Great performances. Recorded Live at the Iridium Jazz Club in New York City in 2010. The sound recording is also great.  Sounds like you are in the concert venue.

The DVD also has bonus features.  An interesting interview with Jeff Beck.  A very cool ""At home with Jeff Beck and his guitars""  where he explains where he got some of his collection of guitars that is fun and footage of Jeff Beck with Les Paul in concert. There is some behind the scenes footage. I do not like the part where a fan says that he saw Jeff Beck at Madison Square Garden and he thought Jeff blew Eric Clapton away. I don't think either one blows the other away. I don't think Eric would have someone on his dvd say that he blew another guitarist away. You could get fans that think Jeff is better and fans that think Eric is better. They are both great.

This is an awesome album.  The CD was nominated for a best rock album grammy and I think it should have won.  I think that it should have been nominated for album of the year grammy along with Eric Clapton and Wynton Marsalis Play The Blues Live at Lincoln Center.

4504123,5,B004YZ3M16,"JEFF BECK-ROCK & ROLL PARTY HONORING LES PAUL: When six string guru JEFF BECK decided to throw a ROCK & ROLL PARTY in honor of his mentor LES PAUL, creator of the solid body electric guitar and recording innovations like multi-tracking, he certainly didn't skimp on the entertainment; the tight as a drum-head backing band for this rockabilly boogie woogie wing-ding is straight out of an ELVIS PRESLEY flick, led by pompadoured cool-daddy singer/guitarist DARRELL HINGHAM. BECK also shares the stage with HINGHAM's wife IMELDA MAY, a stunningly sultry sex kitten who coos, caresses, yips and yells like a possessed retro-chic soul-mama, truly a shimmy-shakin' talent to marvel at. BECK and MAY lovingly channel LES PAUL & MARY FORD's pioneering fretwork and echo-saturated vocals to recreate early fifties classics VAYA CON DIOS, MOCKINGBIRD HILL, and HOW HIGH THE MOON, retaining the high-spirited zing and novel beauty of the originals. The man with an axe to grind also takes on jump bluser TINY BRADSHAW's swingin' chestnut TRAIN KEPT A ROLLIN', (which BECK's old band THE YARDBIRDS memorably covered), plus steam-heat instrumentals PETER GUNN, APACHE, and SLEEP WALK with neck-breakin' chops and passion to spare. Sixties soul slinger GARY ""U.S."" BONDS shows up for the crowd-participation pleaser NEW ORLEANS, followed by twanger revivalist BRIAN SETZER, who busts out EDDIE COCHRAN's TWENTY FLIGHT ROCK to cap off this funky, fast-paced tribute.

However this is a really fun DVD: while I am not a great fan of rockabilly, here it is played with real enthusiasm by Beck and the rest of the musicians. It is supposed to be a tribute to Les Paul, which musically is maybe not that clear but it is done with a really infectious enthusiasm. The singer Imelda May is a real revelation as well. Beck is able to play his usual licks and to adapt them in a surprisingly natural way to traditional rock'n' roll. It is a surprising success",1332028800,,597,4.2

For some reason, the Shadows tune ""Apache"" really got me.  As a 14-year-old long ago I saw a band at Butlins play this; probably the day I became such a music fan.  Jeff is at the leading edge of Rock; he plays Blues with the White House All Stars; and, as shown here, he also knows and loves his roots.",1330905600,,538,4.235294117647059

It not only showcases the incredible and unmatched guitar skills of Jeff Beck (the world's greatest guitarist), but also the beautiful Imelda May's great vocal skills as well as Leo Green's great sax skills and Trombone Shorty's great trombone skills.  Its also a nice tribute to Les Paul, who was a friend of, and influence on, Jeff.  The DVD points out that Les invented the solid body electric guitar as well as many guitar and recording techniques that are still used by guitarists and sound engineers today.  The music is all 50's and early 60's pop, rock and rockabilly, consisting of 1) some of Les and wife Mary Ford's top hits, 2) some tunes by contemporaries of Les who were influenced by him, and 3) some tunes that Jeff felt Les would have appreciated.  Highlight songs for me included a blazing ""Peter Gunn"", a dramatic and beautiful ""Walking in the Sand"" (seeing Imelda slink by Jeff while Jeff's doing an incredible riff is worth the price of the DVD by itself!), beautiful versions of ""Sleepwalk"", ""Apache"", ""How High the Moon"", ""Tiger Rag"" and ""Vaya Con Dios"" and a rollicking, stomping version of ""New Orleans"" (with Gary ""U.S."" Bonds) .  Excellent bonus features are included.  Watching this DVD leaves me at times thrilled, at times amazed, and at times joyful.

Gary US Bonds is a real  treat and he is great even at the age of 71 when this was recorded!

Playing with a Rockabilly back-up band Jeff performs several tributes to birthday boy Les Paul who passed shortly before this already scheduled 95th Birthday Party. He also did many numbers in the style of Gene Vincent. Genes guitar player, Cliff Gallop was largely responsible for influencing Jeff's style. This rockabilly guitar style is such a complete U-turn from Jeff's regular style it is worth hearing and seeing just for the difference.

Jeff Beck is presented as the front man in this performance at the Iridium. But it's actually the DARREL HIGHAM and wife IMELDA MAY show. This is my introduction to the duo and they do not disappoint here. They take me back to first year high school, just before The Beatles and the ""Stones"" hit the big time. Beck struts his intrument impressively without dominating the night. The show here really is Imelda and the songs she chose to perform- many are '50s and '60s American popular music, soon to be converted to rock and roll by you know who (jazz singer Dinah Washington recorded Cry Me A River, and Ella Fitzgerald recorded How High The Moon). And Imelda wears '50s hair style to match (like my older sister did).

Guest artists Gary U. S. Bonds, Brian Setzer, Trombone Shorty and the horn session all jazz the night up. Audio and video quality are both excellent, with good balance among all audio channels.

4504147,5,B004YZ3M16,"When a friend recommended the PBS special excerpted from this DVD, I was a bit skeptical.

Yes, Jeff Beck is a brilliant rock fusion guitarist -- probably the greatest electric guitar wizard since Hendrix -- but could he discipline himself to do justice to these great rock & roll classics from the fifties?

The answer is: yes, in spades!  This is flat out one of the best roots rock & roll concerts I've ever seen.

I just can't rave enough about virtually every aspect of this DVD.  The song selections... the singing... the playing... the sound quality and unobtrusive camera work... the DVD extras provided, including footage of Beck playing with Les Paul and Beck calling out a few of his favorite guitars in his extensive collection...

Apparently this R&R Party project started with the idea of a tribute to the late great Les Paul, the father and master of the electric guitar and multi-track recordings.  That tribute, with the young singer Imelda May doing ample justice to Paul's wife and performing partner Mary Ford, comprises eight songs at the heart of this concert.

The rest of the bill includes many wonderful rockabilly and instrumental hits of the fifties and sixties, plus special guest appearances by the legendary Gary U.S. Bonds -- who happened to be playing at B.B. King's around the corner from the Iridium, where Paul played weekly and where this concert was taped -- and Brian Setzer, who trades rockabilly guitar licks with Beck.

Really, this DVD made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, it made the tears roll down my cheeks... and it had my toe tapping from start to finish.

I don't mean to sound like such an old geezer, but -- will hip hop kids feel the same about their favorite records in fifty years?  It's hard to imagine...

At any rate, this DVD belongs in the collection of anyone who loves classic roots rock & roll and rockabilly.  And truth to tell, I'd rather see Jeff Beck playing this material with this band than his usual fusion material with his usual band of instrumental virtuosi.

This is timeless music -- and musicianship of the highest order.",1308787200,,2107,4.705722070844686

The video operator did a superb job.
Also, if you don't know her, you'll be introduced to Imelda May, and prepare to fall in love.

I don't think anyone could do such soulful renditions of these tunes. What's more impressive is that the show was done on a whim. Most musicians would have to take months off of their regular tour to learn this material; Jeff pulled this off in the middle of a tour that showcased a totally different genre of music. I know Mr. Beck plays HIS music without a pic, but Les Paul's? Enough could not be said of Imelda May's contributions, she is incredible and supremely sexy. However, this is not your typical Jeff Beck show. The songs are played in the same format in which they were originally recorded. The solos are quick and to the point (but mind blowing), so don't go to sleep or get caught daydreaming if you want to hear the guitar solo. This is one of the most rare occasions, where a Jeff Beck album's most uninteresting songs are the instrumentals. Didn't think I would care to much for this one, being a fan of soulful-but-blistering guitar work, but I am. I find myself waking up and going to work with Jeff riffs and Imelda's voice ringing in my brain- no complaints on keeping the radio off. Bought the DVD for my Dad, thinking I wouldn't want it. I had to buy a second copy. The DVD has to many great extras. If you just get the CD, you miss out on some of the best slide work of the night; as well as the whole feel of the show because you miss out on 7 songs and the whole ""flow""/build-up of energy that occurs throughout the evening. The interview of Jeff is pretty good, and the cameo interviews are fun as well. I had no idea Paul Shaffer was such a big Jeff Beck fan, and my guess is that Meatloaf got trashed. The old footage of Jeff playing with Les on TV from the 80's is worth price of admission for any Jeff Beck fan- even with Billy Squire doing the intros. Now, if I'm not in front of the TV, I just listen to the DVD with the TV off.",1305936000,,1976,4.161879895561357

4504156,4,B004YZ3M16,"I'm not particularly a fan of Jeff Beck's own music but I do truly appreciate what he has done in creating his own unique playing style. He is truly a master of the guitar. I just happen to like more blues in my rock. His history in The Yard Birds is also of interest to me since Jimmy Page is at the top of my favorite players list. I enjoy seeing deserving people honored and appreciate the exceptional character of people big enough to give such honor as Mr. Beck does here for Les Paul. This night's performance is very 50s rock-n-roll and as such is not my personal favorite style of music but no one can argue how well those assembled here cover that classic genre. I was especially impressed with Imelda May's multi-track covering of Mary Ford's vocals as Jeff belted out the classic Les Paul guitar parts. Even to a hard core hard rock and heavy blues fan (Led Zep, Aerosmith, Badlands, Bad Company, Cry of Love, Rainbow, Gary Moore, etc)those songs IMHO are musical brilliance. Les was way ahead of his time in his playing technique, skill and methods, not to mention his legendary recording studio techniques. Mary Ford's singing was perfect for those songs as well. Thanks also go to Les Paul for pushing Gibson to create my favorite guitar. Had Gibson payed his ideas more attention sooner, they might have had advantage over Leo Fender's Stratocaster. but then again, it is Les who is being honored with this lineup of very talented musicians. I highly recommend watching the Video of Les' life story, interviews and historic footage of he & Mary Ford called Les Paul - Chasing Sound, you'll likely enjoy it at least as much as this night's performance. His contribution to the world of music can't be overstated. The same can be said of Jeff Beck. I'm very happy to have this production alongside all my music concert videos.",1304726400,4,1839,4.626911314984709
4504157,5,B004YZ3M16,"I followed Jeff Beck off and on starting during the Yardbirds and Rod Stewart/Faces days.  Sometimes I liked what he did, sometimes not.  He dropped off my radar screen during the 90's.  My wife recently heard his interpretation of ""Nessun Dorma"" on the radio and asked me if I knew who Jeff Beck was.  That question led to my rediscovery of Jeff Beck and his current work, including a purchase of his album ""Emotion and Commotion"" and seeing him in concert for the first time.  I purchased ""Rock and Roll Party"" on a whim for two reasons:  I love old rock and roll, and I wanted to see what Jeff Beck would do with it.

This video is just plain fun.  the songs sound great.  The backup band is the same one that plays the rockabilly set on the ""Live at Ronnie Scott's"" DVD, with the inclusion of Imelda May as vocalist.  I know little about the band and Imelda May but they are very good on this video.  Beck plays the music ""straight up"", sticking closely to the original arangements (or closely enough that my admittedly sketchy memory didn't notice any major differences).  The solos are phenomenal.  It is amazing to watch Jeff Beck at work.

The guest musicians are good.  Beck gives them their due and lets them play without trampling them with his guitar wizardry.  They do not detract from the overall presentation, although one or two of the saxaphone solos didn't really add to the songs.

The video bears repeat viewing, both for the music and to try and recognize people in the audience (how many can you name?!).  My wife and I have watched it several times, and my children (ages 11 and under) love to dance to the music.  This was a great buy for the whole family.",1303430400,2,1680,4.467105263157895
4504158,5,B004YZ3M16,"For one night only - June 9, 2010 -,a date that would have celebrated guitarist/inventor/music legend Les Paul's 95th Birthday ( he died 8/19/2009 at age 94), rock guitarist Jeff Beck hosted ""party"" at the small 200-seat Iridium Jazz Club in New York City. In the audience were names like David Bowie, Meat Loaf and Steven Van Zandt. But they didn't take the stage. On stage, and captured on video, were Beck along with British rockabilly singer Imelda May and her band. For 90 minutes there was, virtually, non-stop music. Beck gets about 10 words out of his mouth, but does all his communicating with his fingers on the fretboard. May sings on about half of the 27 songs performed and there are one-shot vocals by guests Gary U.S. Bonds and Stray Cat Brian Setzer. Beck does his solo thing on Paul classics like ""Sleepwalk"" and ""Peter Gunn"".

But it's not ALL rock and roll. While Paul's early Trio work is mostly overlooked, there is a large segment devoted to his Capitol years and the recordings he made with then-wife Mary Ford. May uses vocal tape looping (pre-recorded) to do a creditable re-creation of Ford's vocals on their hits ""The World Is Waiting For The Sunrise"" and ""Vaya Con Dios"". As the program progresses, Beck takes the beat more into rock and roll territory but never breaks a sweat. Paul never had ROCK hits but that isn't to say he couldn't play rock guitar. (After all he invested the solid body electric guitar which Beck plays.).

The concert itself would be a reason to get this DVD but the bonuses make it a must have. First there is a 26-minute interview with Beck at his home in the UK. Next is an 18-minute  ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette that mostly shows Beck's fans anxious to see him. (Paul is rarely mentioned). Two performances of Paul playing with Beck in 1983 (From the Rock `n Roll Tonite TV show) show how Paul could match - or beat - Beck at hard rock if he wanted. There's a 14-minute section on Beck and his large guitar collection and a four-minute performance of Paul (again from 1983) demonstrating his patented ""black box"" which allowed him to layer his guitar sound.

I can't think of any music fan - whether a young kid just starting out on guitar or a baby boomer who remembers Paul from his 45 hits with Ford - not getting a lot of enjoyment from this DVD.

4504159,5,B004YZ3M16,"Holy Crap, this is really good.
I'm a big fan of Les Paul, so it's cool to see someone of the magnitude of Jeff Beck paying homage to Les & Mary's music.  But that's not the only cool thing about it.  Jeff Beck nails it.  He really did his homework not only on hitting all the notes that Les played on those classic recordings, but also in working out the proper tone through his Les Paul guitar and amp (yes, Jeff used a Les Paul guitar for those songs), and some tastefully added effects such as delay, reverb and such.  It was almost like listening to the Les Paul records.  I don't believe there's another living guitarist who could have put forth so much effort to reproduce Les Paul's songs so true to the real thing.  I hear audience members were at times in tears due to the beauty of Mockin' Bird Hill.  Imedla May may have a different sounding voice than Mary Ford, but she still did a tremendous job on these songs, with pre-recorded harmonies.  She fit in perfectly with the night's set list.  The band as a whole was fun, professional and well-practiced.  In addition to numerous Les Paul classics, they played some of Beck's favorite American rock 'n' roll favorites from Bill Haley to Santo & Johnny.  If you're a fan of either Les Paul or Jeff Beck, this is a must!  I give it the highest possible rating.  I can't speak for the man, but I don't see how Les himself wouldn't approve of how true to the original these songs are played.  A fitting tribute.",1303084800,2,1470,4.376383763837638

My feelings about this are the same as all the rest of the 5star reviews. Id like to add the fact that the horn section contains some pretty heavy hitters also. Google up Leo Green,or Dave Prisman-household names in the music world,playin with just about everyone. Also we all know Blue Lou Marini from the Blues Brothers(looking a little more gray,but aren't we all).Imelda May just freakin blows my mind as well. Her band is amazing.

I know Les was certainly associated with jazz (in his early recordings) , some degree of country (country swing jazz from the get go) and certainly an iconic master of pop (with Mary Ford). But I have never heard of his being associated with Rockabilly, let alone playing, or at least recording much of it. So I really do not see how these selections are the basis for a tribute to him.

Though it's not my favorite music style it's a lot of fun and shows that Beck can make a guitar express anything his inventive thought happens to be at the moment, and he's a generous performer. His brief call and response with Brian Setzer is worth the price of the DVD, and Imelda May is terrific - I had never heard of her before.

Along for the ride we have Imelda May, Brian Setzer and Gary U. S. Bonds sounding as good as ever.

She is little known in the U.S., but does an exemplary rendition of Mary Ford......almost an exact clone of her velvet voice, complete with overdubs.  I've grown up to LP&MF and have most of their memorable music, both LP's and remastered CD's!  This entire concert celebrates both their dreamy music and many rockabilly hits over the years.

I agree that Beck is probably the best living guitarist, and he doesn't hurt that reputation here.

This show is amazing from beginning to end, not just the Les Paul/Mary Ford stuff.  Some other reviewers here didn't care for the songs near the end of the show with the full horn section, but I thought they were great.  ""Walking in the Sand"", the old Shirelles hit is one of the highlights of the show, with Beck and Imelda May wringing more emotion and intensity out of the song than I would have thought possible.

The Blu-Ray disc sounds and looks fabulous, don't let the cheesy looking cover put you off.  This isn't a low budget production.  I'm not a big fan of Rockabilly, but this disc has given me a new appreciation for the genre.  Five stars easily.",1300924800,2,960,4.3841807909604515

Paul Schafer from David Letterman quips in one of the excellent bonus features, ""I cried tonight...I think everybody cried at least twice.""  That summed it up for me. When Imelda May pours out her soul in the torch classic, I'm a Fool to Cry, I was wiping my eyes. That's not even a Les Paul song, but all the material is wonderful. I fell in love with Imelda May during Cry me a River. Her husband Daryl Higham is a throwback-he looks and sounds like he's been cloned from 1958. They're all like actors playing their  rolls to a T. Oscars for all involved. And Jeff Beck? Three recent DVDs feature him at the peak of his powers: This one, Jeff Beck Live at Ronnie Scott's and The 25th Anniversary concert of the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame. All excellent.

While Jeff and his guests performed many tunes from the 50's and 60's, there was a nice set where he and Imelda May did Les Paul and Mary Ford tunes. Imelda recorded several tracks of her voice just like Mary did way back when. To be honest, I have not heard such near perfect renditions of those songs since Les and Mary did them. It truly brought a tear to my eye watching it. Absolutely incredible! Jeff Beck's playing is truly unmatched by any living guitarist. He was able to reproduce most of Les Paul's incredible guitar work nearly note for note. This was not an easy feat. Watching him play, you can really get an appreciation for how talented Les was.

Imelda May is just sensational and really fulfils the whole rockabilly style in her own way,and what a great voice,she will have you mesmerized from the moment she comes on stage.
The rest of the band is awesome and so tight,the guest artists like Gary US Bonds,Brian Setzer and others perform knockout renditions of songs brought back to life by Jeff and his friends.

There's a 15-minute bit with JB in his home with some of his most treasured guitars, relating a story to each one, that is just fascinating to watch.  A Strat gifted from John McLaughlin?  The Seymour Duncan ""Tele-Gib"" traded for the 1954 Yardbirds-era Esquire, and subsequent regret?  A plastic guitar from Jimmy Page?  A '54 Sunburst Strat that some guy just GAVE him? The ""workhorse"" Telecaster?  Yep, pretty kewl stuff!

There's 1983 concert footage of JB playing live with Les Paul that's a hoot; LP tries to yank Beck's cord out of his Strat after a particularly blistering solo, and JB then tries to return the joke by de-tuning LP's; all in great fun.

From the same show, there's a Les Paul solo performance where he showcases his ""little black box"", which allows him to first layer several tracks spontaneously, then play lead over them.  It reminds you just how much of a genius this guy was, not only as a musician, but as an inventor and engineer.

Then there's a long interview with JB.  It's unfortunately marred by an annoying Entertainment Tonight/Access Hollywood-wannabe who obviously attended The Diane Saywer School Of Overanimated Interviewing.  JB does relate a lot of his early life and influences, both from his family and music, and the over-acting-fake-tan-bimbo aside, it's damn interesting.

All of this may get overlooked with the other reviews in the excitement of the Irridium show, but anyone who is interested in purchasing this great DVD should know what else lies in store.",1299283200,33,1668,4.931899641577061

Sure, Jeff can play this style he grew up with as good as anyone, but the real focus here should be Imelda May and her band.  First, Imelda May's vocals are why Jeff Beck decided to do a project like this in the first place.  She is an amazing blues/rockabilly singer who has really created her own sound in recent years.  Her husband Darrel Higham is also singing lead vocals throughout the show.  Darrel is an incredible lead guitarist and fantastic vocalist.  Trust me, had Darrel been playing lead guitar, he would have MORE than held his own against Beck or Setzer.

Some of the songs she performs are from the Les Paul days when his wife, Mary Ford, was a vocalist. Imelda does a terrific job singing these classics. If you like Rockabilly, or Jeff Beck, it's a must have. The sound and picture are excellent and I liked the way it was filmed, the camera zooms in on Beck's fingers so you watch the Beck magic close up. Les Paul would have been proud to have had his name associated with this fantastic show. The extras are also good. I had never seen Beck interviewed, but the interview on here is interesting and talks, among other things, about his feud with Clapton, how an American movie inspired him as an adolescent, good stuff.",1298764800,3,851,4.3584905660377355

4504181,5,B004YZ3M16,"OK - I confess to being a hardcore Beck fan. But this DVD is the one that will pull in anyone who had wondered what the ""buzz"" about Jeff Beck is. He does spot-on versions of songs that you have probably heard from the original sources (Les Paul & Mary Ford, for example) - but his playing is in homage to the sources, and is not overly modified, as too many artists would have done.

And...""The Train Kept A Rollin' "" is worth the price alone. You hear Jeff do a nod to his Yardbird days, yet retain the aura of the original song. Wow.

Imelda May adds vocals on about half of the twenty tracks - and she is amazing. Her obvious love for the music pops right out of the screen. The rest of the musicians are likewise stellar - including Imelda's husband, Darrel Higham on guitar and vocals (he was part of Jeff's Big Time Playboy  band, and added chops to the ""Crazy Legs"" CD,also a classic).

Among the added tracks on the DVD there are a great interview with Jeff, a clip of him showing off his ""toys"" (a guitar selection to die for!)and two pieces with Les Paul showing why he will always be remembered both as an artist and an inventor. The clip of him and Jeff jamming in the '80s is joyful and charming. Talk about loving what you get paid to do!

I plan on loaning this DVD out to my friends - the ones who wonder why I am such a Beckophile. I'm sure it will blow them away as much as it has blown ME away.",1298764800,10,1414,4.108695652173913
4504182,5,B004YZ3M16,"No one else other than Jeff Beck could possibly have done a production like this.  Spectacular guitar tribute, Imalda's style and talent are the perfect foil, and her multi track work on the Mary Ford pieces could not be cooler. I felt like I just dropped back to Les Paul's day. Darrel Higham is great as well and I truly could close my eyes and hear Bill Haley's mojo taking it all to a new level with Jeff's magic.  What a show.  Les would have truly been honored.",1298592000,,467,4.284090909090909
4504183,5,B004YZ3M16,"If you're a rock and roll fan, don't think twice - buy this DVD!

And if you're a Jeff Beck fan, it's even more essential. The interview alone is worth the price of admission. As is the segment with Jeff showing and discussing his guitars.

As for the music, it's a celebration of rockabilly and it's carried off with style and soul and a band of terrific musicians who set my toes a-tappin'. Ordinarily I don't listen to much rockabilly - I'm more of a rock & fusion fan - and I shy away from vocalists. But this show opened my eyes to the greatness of the music. These people are here because they love to play - that's all, and we get to be a part of it. It really is a party.

One more plus - the camera work. Many videos nowadays are driven by headache-inducing frantically paced cuts which detract from the music because no shot lasts more than 2 seconds (Paul McCartney take note!). This is NOT the case here. On the contrary, there are plenty of full band shots, shots of the interactions among the band, and close-up views of the performers, sufficiently sustained to allow you to really appreciate and engage with their performance. The producer has realized that the proper role of the videographer is to be invisible and let the show speak for itself.",1298592000,2,1263,4.435344827586207
4504184,5,B004YZ3M16,"""Wow"", what a Tribute!!! This is an ""up-close"" & ""personal"", tribute concert, to the late/great Les Paul. I thought he invented the first, solid body electric guitar, but according to the current issue of ""Guitar World"", featuring Jeff Beck & this release, it states that Les Paul, was one of the 1st to experiment, with the developement of the solid body electric guitar. It states he did not invent it. Also, it states that Les Paul was an innovator, in muti-track recording, & other things, plus he was a recording & performing artist. I know he toured with Hank Williams back in 1952, because I have a Concert Poster, that includes him along, with Hank. He also performed with Jeff Beck, and there is a picture of them, performing together in the current issue of Guitar World. Anyway, Jeff Beck ""perfected"" the playing of the instrument. Les oftened performed in this same exact venue, where this tribute concert was filmed. This is not as ""up-close"", & ""personal"", like the ""Live at Ronnie Scotts"" DVD. However, it is a relatively, small venue. This concert includes some of Les's songs, plus some great early ""50's Style"", Rock & Roll favorites, like Bill Haley's ""Rock Around the Clock"", & ""Shake, Rattle, & Roll"". You get Jeff Beck, the electric guitar, virtuoso, plus a large backing band, plus special guest performers, and singers. If you like ""Old Time 50's Style"", Rock & Roll, like Bob Seger sang about, along with Jeff Beck the electric guitar virtuoso, then you'll love this one, for sure. This is definitely, one fantastic tribute concert. Thanks!!!!

P.S. The Bonus Features include a ""BLAST FROM THE PAST"", with Les Paul, and Jeff Beck ""jamming"" together, with their electric guitars. It's ""awesome"". Thanks again!!!!",1298505600,,1737,4.928327645051194
4504185,5,B004YZ3M16,"Unbelievable... I don't know how JB manages to be the best guitar player in many musical styles. He is the best guitar player and the most versatile one too.

Imelda May's vocals are also true to the original and overall this concert represents the sound of the era ""very well"".

Buy this DVD now, do not wait. And while you still have a chance to see JB performing this concert live (till April 9th, 2011) in US -- go get tickets for it.",1298332800,,438,4.265060240963855

To fully appreciate it, you should have an appreciation for Les Paul's music and skills. The collaborators are top notch.  Imelda May and Darrell Hingham and their band are superb.  I highly recommend all of Imelda's albums also.  Jeff's guitar work is stellar and tasteful, and the other guests are wonderful.  So buy this product!",1498953600,,439,4.786666666666667

The album lacks continuity because of the way it's cut into songs.  Since this is a live performance, the DVD flows naturally with the conversation and commmentary in between the songs.

Jeff is great and so is Darrel. Imelda makes the album...she is a wonderful performer, and incredible singer and drop-dead gorgeous too.",1475884800,,466,4.8734177215189876
