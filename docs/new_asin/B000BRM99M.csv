8091523,5,B000BRM99M,"I produced ""Missing, Presumed Dead.""  This version of the DVD is not the official DVD which contains many more DVD extras.  I will not see any revenue generated by the sale of this DVD as the original distributor dumped their stock onto the discount DVD market (like putting them in a dollar store chain.)  If you want to purchase the official DVD with much more video about our POW/MIAs go to the film website:  MissingPresumedDead(dot)com",1304121600,,440,4.826666666666667
8091524,5,B000BRM99M,"This DVD showed the actual sub-committee and how they balked at so many things - it was really an eye opener.  I have been involved in the POW/MIA issues for over 30 years, read a dozen of the best books and spent 23 years in the Army, the last 12 in Army Spec Ops, and nothing ever got my attention like this DVD.  In one scene, there was a man who was a trained Human tracker using the most sophisticated equipment they had during Vietnam.  He was discharged from the Air Force, given a new name and was sent to the secret CIA camp deep in Laos; while  there his job was to send back the locations of certain POW's.

Well he did just that. However, after the troops left Vietnam and all the fuss started about there were still live POW's left over there, he was helpless to do or say anything.  He was sworn to secrecy, since the CIA operators must all do so, they can never tell anyone what they did. It was driving him crazy for years knowing all along that he had been tracking over 200 POW's AND they were never reported.

So he went to DC to testify. While there, he received several calls and was told he would not make it to the hearings alive, etc. On the day he was to testify, he made it there AND ONLY ONE member of the committee was present. He asked where they were and the man said he had no idea. So the guy said -- Well, that just proves what I wrote in my testimony and that they are afraid to try and answer my questions or to tell me I'm lying about what I stated; so for the record, ALL I wrote in this testimony I want entered on the record. At that time, he told it all....you must hear his testimony to really begin to understand the TRUTH, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

8091525,5,B000BRM99M,"The saddest thing of all is that Bob Dumas has recently received evidence that his brother Roger incredibly is still alive in North Korea, along with several other Korean POWs, working as slave labor.  He wants help getting them out, but can't even get ANYBODY from the media to cover the story because they are all to afraid of reprisals from the government because of their shameful history of leaving our brave men behind after the end of conflict.",1223424000,,451,4.708860759493671
8091526,5,B000BRM99M,"The movie interviews many high-profile people such as former current and former congressmen.

By the time you finish watching this well-made documentary you will be stunned by a couple of realizations you come to.  This movie is like a bucket of cold water over the head.",1217203200,3,271,4.869565217391305
8091527,5,B000BRM99M,"For anyone who is not familiar with the POW/MIA issue,this is a must see video. Especially for those who were born after The Korean and Vietnam conflicts. It is very educational. It brings to ""LIGHT"" the failures of our government to find the truth about what happened to our men and women. It brings out in the open that we(Government)did indeed left men behind(ALIVE)in Korea and Indochina. Watch this video and get involved!",1210896000,4,427,4.863013698630137
8091528,5,B000BRM99M,"Learn from the journey of this New England family as they struggle with our government, politicians, and foreign governments to get answers to a 50 year old question - What happened to Korean War POW Roger Dumas?  Roger was last seen at the exchange point at Freedom Bridge in Korea to be repatriated back to the US, back to his family.  Suddenly and inexplicably he and a dozen or so others were taken away from the group,  never to be seen or heard from again.

Follow the amazing dedication of Roger's brother Bob as he does battle with various governmental agencies who have, for decades, stonewalled families of those with loved ones who are still Missing in Action.  This story documents not just the plight of the Dumas Family but gives a shocking yet stark overview of the POW/MIA Issue and some of the major players on each side of this debate.  Watching the excerpts from the 1992 Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs clearly shows that two members of this committee had personal as well as political agendas when they arrived at this committee and how the fate of thousands of men was simply pushed aside in the name of ""global progress"".
The emotional rollercoaster you will experience after watching this DVD will stay with you for days, if not weeks.  Every American should see this story.",1160179200,11,1309,4.714912280701754
