1823919,5,B000083C5F,"Kieslowski is quite simply one of the greatest directors of the 20th century.  His relatively small body of work should not be held against him as everything he has done is absolutely brilliant.  Blue is a dark somewhat depressing tale that is a bit more cerebral than its companions in the trilogy.  Nevertheless it is a beautiful piece of work.  White is a touching story of how lives can change and how tradgedy can turn to comedy in an instant.  As much as I like White.  Red is the best for me.  With Red Kieslowski achieves a humanist tone I only see in Kurosawa's work.  The visual technique and the way Kieslowski weaves his stories in Red is something many western filmmakers will never hope to duplicate.  I try to get everyone I know to see all these movies and if they only see one, I try to get the to see Red.  Its the first one of the series that I saw and it is still my favorite.",1045008000,10,896,4.2485207100591715
1823920,4,B000083C5F,"""Red,"" ""White,"" and ""Blue"" is a trilogy of French films made by Polish-born filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski, widely considered to be the one of the greatest European directors of the late 20th century.  Each film follows emotionally damaged characters in modern French society, as they try to deal with their own unique angst.  The films are presented in such an honest, gritty manner that they nearly create the appearance of a documentary, as we the viewers get the impression that we are somehow intruding on their lives.  We get a voyeur's glimpse into their daily activities and experience with them their joy, excitement and most often, pain.
These movies have the traditional European feel.  They are simple little tales that play out in an unrushed narrative.  Sadly, the only films like this we can see in America are found in the ""foreign"" section of our local video store.  An interesting note about this collection is that each film features beautiful actresses who have subsequently found moderate success in Hollywood (Juliette Binoche, Julie Delpy and Irene Jacob).
Of the three, I prefer ""White,"" but most critics claim ""Red"" is the best.  Fans of European dramas will love this collection, and anyone with a desire to begin exploring foreign cinema could make no better selection for their first title.",1043539200,10,1318,5.074074074074074
1823921,4,B000083C5F,I do hope that the quality is as good as the VHS. These are wonderful thoughtful films. The details and cinimatography are absolutely beautiful.,1042675200,5,144,5.041666666666667
1823922,5,B000083C5F,"The Three Colors Trilogy comprises 3 superb films (Bleu/Blanc/Rouge) by the late, great director Krzysztof Kieslowski. The films use the symbolism expressed by the colors of the French flag for their themes (liberty, equality, fraternity). The Three Colors is Kieslowski's crowning achievement, and Rouge, his final film, is probably his masterpiece. That's saying something, because some of his previous films (Decalogue, The Double Life of Veronique) are among the greatest films of the last 20 years! I saw Bleu (with Juliette Binoche) a long time ago and was very impressed. It's a sad but beautful movie, about a composer's widow and how she copes with life after his death. Blanc (with Julie Delpy) is about life for a man after he is unceremoniously dumped by his wife; it's the lightest and most comedic of the three films. Rouge (with Irene Jacob) is my favorite and explores the melancholy (and platonic) relationship that develops between a young lady and an older man. Jacob is quite simply a goddess, and if you can tear your eyes away from her long enough to pay attention to the movie, you'll find this is a thematically rich film with solid, subtle performances (Kieslowski was nominated for a Best Director Oscar for Rouge in 1995). I am lucky enough to own a DVD of Rouge which has a ton of extras (making of, deleted scenes, soundtrack samples, trailers, film-making lesson by the director, Cannes festival interviews, extended interviews with editor, director, and *sigh* Irene Jacob). I believe the upcoming Miramax DVDs retain these features (with subtitles), which are in French. More Americans should experience these films. They are so well-made and lovingly crafted that they put to shame all the multi-million dollar, shallow, explosion-fests routinely shovelled out by Hollywood nowadays. Next to Stanley Kubrick and Akira Kurosawa, Krzysztof Kieslowski's death in the 1990s is one of the most tragic for cinema. Younger filmmakers should hope one day to approach even an iota of the MANY brilliant masterpieces created of these film masters. Watch The Three Colors Trilogy! This is film-making at its finest and totally a 5 STAR recommendation!",1042416000,108,2173,5.158640226628895
1823923,5,B000083C5F,"It is absolutely shocking that it has taken so long for this trilogy of masterpieces to reach DVD. These are, without a doubt, my favorite films of the 1990s. The late Kieslowski was working at the top of his game and his presence in filmmaking is sorely missed. Blue and Red are my favorites out of the three, with Juliette Binoche illuminating every scene. Red (which is set in Geneva and not Paris as the amazon review incorrectly states)is a brilliant way to wrap the trilogy. Irene Jacob sparring with the great Jean Louis Tritignant in their lovely and heartbreaking scenes. There are so many wonderful moments, including the final moment when Jacob's face on the giant billboard becomes a haunting coda that will reduce you to tears...simply because it is shear genius on Kieslowski's part. Like his contemporary Wim Wenders, Kieslowski marched to the beat of his own drum and gave the world beautiful, if not always easy, films to cherish.",1042329600,44,947,4.851851851851852
1823924,5,B000083C5F,"I've not viewed the dvd's (because I've been waiting a since 1995 for them to come out) but I have them on VHS and these movies are some of the most moving pieces of visual art. The writing, character development, plot development, acting, cinematography, & directing are all just top notch. I have considered these films to be my favorite french movies of all time.

OK here it is #1 blue- a sorrowful tail staring Juliette Binoche (pictured on cover) as a woman who sees her husband & child die before her eyes and is then forced to continue her life w/o them. #2 white- a vengeful tail taking place predominantly in Poland where a wife (pictured on cover) screws over her husband and he gets some awesome revenge but only after having to rebuild his life. last but not least #3 red- a tail of loneliness with a nice twist of fate. Staring the beautiful Irene Jacob (need I say it? ahem ... pictured on cover) this is for some odd reason my favorite of the three despite amazon reviews claiming it their least favorite. In each case the title color permeates the cinematography and plays a large part in the telling of each tail. These movies are just a great study in psychology and leave you wanting more.

I hope this is helpful.

Eric Rohmer's style is felt throughout this incredible tour de force.

I would rank the trilogy in the following way: 1) White 2) Blue 3) Red

White is my favorite since it is based on a Polish character and much of the movie takes place in Poland.
Blue is most emotional and melancholic.
Red is the most hopeful of all three.

BLUE stands for: freedom
RED stands for: brotherhood",1385164800,4,474,4.686746987951807

1823990,5,B000083C5F,"One of my favorite filmmakers, Kieslowski left behind an impressive resume, one that peaked with his final contribution to cinema, this exceptional trilogy.  While the trilogy is not necessarily one of the narrative sense, it does carry interwoven themes and works rather splendidly as a complete work.

In Kieslowski's first film in his `Trois Couleurs' trilogy, he explores liberty.  This is not in the political sense but in an emotional sense, and that truth rings loud and clear over the course of the film's running time.  `Bleu' follows Julie, a wife and mother who has her life turned upside down when her husband and son are killed in a car accident.  Having been in the car with her family, and being the sole survivor, Julie is racked with guilt atop her sorrow and she is pained with the very thought of living.  Over the course of the film, Julie regresses into isolation only to have her soul liberated from emotional desolation as she reconnects with her former life and uncovers truths she was unaware of.  Kieslowski does a remarkable job of shadowing Julie's inner conflictions with stunning use of visuals, but more so he allows the emotional core of the film to seep into every frame through music, using it as a symbol of Julie's inability for true isolation and eventual liberation.  Binoche's tremendous performance illuminates each scene as she digs deep into the turmoil Julie is experiencing.  What is so moving about `Bleu' is that it truly serves as a progressive film, maybe more so than either of the other films in the trilogy, because it fully fleshes out Julie's complete transformation as a person experiencing grief.  Kieslowski truly `liberates' her.

In `Blanc', the second film in the trilogy, Kieslowski tackles equality.  Using a divorcing couple for this, Kieslowski mirrors the political state of France through this young couple's sexual and emotional turmoil.  Karol, a Polish immigrant, is being humiliated by his French wife for his inability to consummate their marriage.  Instead of simply walking away from the situation, Karol mourns the loss of his love and she continues to rub that loss in his face to the point where he seeks out an intricate and devilish revenge in order to attain his personal equality.  The use of white is brilliant here, for it underscores the more pure aspects of the story and helps connect us to Karol as a man.  As an `anti-comedy', `Blanc' offers a lighter look at Kieslowski's themes but never feels unimportant.  The depictions of Karol's eminent rise are deeply rooted in the strength of the trilogy and offer a true glimpse of the director's range.

For me, Kieslowski's crowning achievement (at least in this trilogy) comes in the form of `Rouge', the final film.  Here he tackles the subject of fraternity and does so by introducing us to an `anti-romance' revolving around part-time model, Valentine, and a retired judge, Kern.  The two are brought together when Valentine accidentally runs over Kern's dog.  The two find themselves wrapped in a web of emotional connection as the two become privy to the lives of those around them.  Kern, a bitter recluse, spies on his neighbors to feed his cynical outlook.  Valentine stumbles onto this and finds herself intrigued despite her hesitation.  What makes `Rouge' so impactful is the way that Kieslowski perfectly balances out his themes through varied means.  He uses polar extremes to create a complete picture.  The age differences, the personal outlook on life, the professional stage in life are all factors that help give the audience vantage points that feel fully fleshed out and truly universal.  The depictions of maintained innocence amidst pure cynicism are powerful and truly lasting.  The prominent theme of fraternity is beautifully exposed through the interwoven relationships that become all the more evident in that closing scene.

I highly recommend these films.  In pieces, they are exceptional, but seen as one whole they deliver a tremendous punch to the gut and linger in the mind with thought provoking accuracy.",1376611200,,4072,5.034328358208955
1823991,5,B000083C5F,"The only trouble is which do I like best, Red or Blue? I've only watched White a few times. I can't count the times over the years I've experienced the artistic philosophical poetry of Red and of Blue. Since I'm a classical composer I naturally love, absolutely adore Blue. I always ask new good friends to watch Blue for me and tell me who they believe wrote the music and so on. But Red is different. Red is too intimate to share with any but my longest and most gifted friends. Red sets my philosophical an ethical senses atwitter. I have no explanation for this this but I feel there is a connection with Red and The Fall by A Campus. But don't look too far into that. If I were to take 4 DVDs to a desert island these would be three of them. You can't have 2 without the 3rd (Red and Blue and White). They, as a trio, make sense. Ask me and I'll tell you the fourth (its not Star Wars or about Hobbits). Would I suggest these movies to anyone? No. They are for those with a taste for self inquisitiveness and a mind that is entertained with questions of existence and the why do we do as we do. As a classical musician I have an affinity to form and balance for esthetics. These three have this. They celebrate Film with a capital ""F"" as art and an example of humanity's breath.",1375833600,,1283,4.17741935483871
1823992,4,B000083C5F,"I had a lot of fun watching these three movies, though i must admit to not considering them masterpieces.
The basic stories of all three movies are charming. All three are in some way about human relationships, and they manage to convey the intensity such relationships can take in an interesting way. The problem is that the stories at times veer over in what i feel is unreflective self-parody. In a sense, they become too self-referential and the plausibility of the situation is lost in the process. This is not as apparent in the first movie as in the second and third. But by the third movie it becomes slightly annoying. At the same time the narrational outline of the third movie was the one i found most appealing.

Apart from the excessive self-referential symbolism the imagery is quite powerful, and the stories are incredibly charming. (Though that might just be my like of french and polish influencing me.)

1824018,4,B000083C5F,"Kieslowki is my favorite director of all time, so I am very picky about how his work is represented. One thing that I love about Criterion is that they exercise extreme discretion with their restorative process, and so I was confident that certain intentional qualities of the original films would persist in these new versions and I was not disappointed to that end. Each film came through with a relative graininess still intact (good), and wherever Criterion did have to make an exception I felt very comfortable with their choices. Except, as it turned out, when it came to the colors & lighting, two aspects I think anyone could agree are enormously important to these three films. The Miramax set has been criticized here in other reviews as being too dark and over-saturated, but I don't entirely agree. The difference is most obvious in Blue, where cinematographer S'awomir Idziak's trademark use of filters and unconventional lighting has been significantly adjusted, sometimes to the point of almost total removal, in the Criterion set.  Anyone who has seen Decalogue V or Double Life of Veronique can readily identify that cinematographer's unique style, and comparing the Criterion and Miramax adaptations, I feel strongly that the few scenes with clearly heavy filter use are better represented in the Miramax version than the Criterion one; ideally a balance between the two end results, weighted slightly to the Miramax side, would have yielded the best results. The Criterion set is still fantastic, and there are many things they did right, but the color and lighting just seemed a lot less impressive in this incarnation of the trilogy which, justifiably, better accents the director's exquisite skill than that of each film's dedicated cinematographer.  That said, I'll be keeping my Miramax set alongside the new Criterion version as even after a remarkable transfer the lesser set is still a valuable asset to anyone's collection.",1327795200,24,1951,5.170886075949367

I'm partial to Blue, but all of the films are filled with gorgeous cinematography, fascinatingly drawn characters and beautiful nuanced performances. Looming above and below the surface in all the films are powerful themes suggesting a mysterious and interconnected spirituality. Criterion has done an amazing and thorough blu ray edition. The usual beautiful packaging contains an outstanding video transfer (and the audio quality is superb). Each disc is also loaded with satisfying and illuminating extras. Kieslowski is one of only a small handful of filmmakers capable of combining real, delicate human portraits with a bracing, almost-supernatural existentialism. These films are not to be missed.",1326758400,2,975,5.731034482758621
1824020,5,B000083C5F,"Take three amazing films, update them for Blu-Ray, and release them in one set.  Success!  Like the Miramax release, all three of the Trois Coleurs Trilogie are in one shiny package (though I own the Miramax trilogy which is still available, I wanted to check into the Criterion version and so checked it out from my local library on Blu-Ray).  Criterion has done a wonderful job of the HD transfer to the Blu-Ray.  Though this is not quite a visual tour de force, there is a lot of detail in these films.  The most notable improvement is on Rouge, where the instances of darkness have been improved and sharpened so that the characters no longer wash out into the shadows.  It creates a crisp look that is probably the effect that was intended.

The subtitles have been updated and improved upon, as is standard with Criterion editing.  There are some light liberties taken with translations in certain points, but it is all done with the intent of bringing across the point that the director was originally intended.  But 99% of the subtitling is accurate to what they characters are saying  (at least in Bleu and Roughe a French speaking friend told me).  And there is a 70+ page book included with all kinds of interesting essays and excerpts.

Now onto the films.  Each is a masterpiece by itself.  They don't really seem to fit together, and they really don't... but they do.  Each is based on one of the colors and themes of the French flag and motto: Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity (Libert, galit, fraternit).  Made more interesting since a Polish man directed them!

Bleu was and is my personal favorite.  The acting is so strong in this film!  The scenes are lovingly shot and the use of music as a storytelling device is amazing.  Bleu is all about Libert, and the liberation of a woman from her tragic, crippling past.  She must come to grips with the past and then begin to look towards the future and push forward through anguish.

Blanc is more of a dark comedy that could have been based on a Shakespeare play.  A husband takes an interesting and twisted revenge on his wife.  It's overall based on galit (equality) and shows that a marriage (and society) is and should be a partnership of two equals.  It's the only film set in the director's native Poland.

Rouge is the final film and it is based on fraternit.  In it, two people form an unlikely friendship. The story is heartwarming at the core, and there are some peripheral stories that help illustrate the difference between their friendship and the relationships of people who are seemingly more compatible.  The use of light is of particular note in this film.  Artistically this is arguably the best of the three.

A modern tour de force of film making. These three films have more feeling than many modern motion pictures and take one back to the glory days of the 50s and 60s French film industry. A wonderful series to add to any collection, and I must say that the Criterion Blu-Ray version is worth the price (which is pretty reasonable on amazon).",1326412800,2,3033,4.6360225140712945

Upon seeing White and before seeing the other two, I even read up on the symbolism of the movie and hidden or not so hidden contexts - still, in my opinion, all three films are only likable.",1326153600,2,483,4.377777777777778

I will say that in these films, the use of color, use of limited dialogue, music, mise-en-scene, and camerawork - we see something that cinema is capable of that no other form of art is. Kieslowski really stretches the limits of filmmaking through deep levels of poetic and metaphoric language and imagery and is able to some up complex relationships in a single shot.

The Criterion Collection has done a great job as usual with a tremendous amount of special features, remastered versions, and a large booklet with interviews and an array of interesting behind the scenes materials. The last DVD has two of Kieslowski's earlier documentaries. I have rarely seen so many special features in a film set.

1824023,5,B000083C5F,"*** 11/26/11:  ADDED REVIEW OF CRITERION BLU-RAY EDITION ***

The late great Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski cleverly ""adapted"" the three French ideals -- liberty, equality, fraternity -- into three thought-provoking modern-day dramas about people who cope with personal losses and tragedies. In BLUE, the first of the trilogy, a widow tries to set herself free (and gain liberty) from her emotional baggages. The second film, WHITE, is about a jilted man's outrageous plot to get even (thus, equality) with his ex-wife. The last film, RED, which is also Kieslowski's final film before he died in 1996, is about a lonely old man who is embittered by the memories of his youth and finds accidental companionship (fraternity) with a young model. All three films are understated in their tone, economical in their dialogs, elliptical in their editing and plotting (there are some mind-boggling flashbacks and flash forwards in WHITE), and haunting in their atmosphere.

The films regard the three French ideals quite indirectly, and in fact more and more so as the trilogy progresses. BLUE is the only one that deals with the ideal of ""freedom"" (albeit emotional freedom) in a concrete way, inviting us to ponder its meanings and its attainability. WHITE treats the concept of ""equality"" in a rather subversive and satiric manner, and it clearly wants us to rethink its meanings rather than accepting it at face value. And RED has to do with ""fraternity"" only circumstantially, and has more to do with the subject of destiny, and how our past is linked to our present. The three films are set not just in France, but also in Poland and Switzerland, and WHITE has primarily Polish dialogs. Hence, a sort of universality is intended.

The three films are also linked in various ways. All three films involve an unfaithful lover who dies, in one way or another. All three films involve a chance encounter between the distressed protagonist and a sympathetic observer -- the widow and the mistress in BLUE, Karol and Mikolaj in WHITE, the retired judge and the model in RED. Both BLUE and WHITE are about people who move to new surroundings to escape from his or her troubled pasts. And RED, ironically, is about someone who never leaves his home in order to wallow in his self-pity.

Kieslowski had done this sort of thing before. In 1988, he ""adapted"" the Ten Commandments into ten one-hour, modern-day dramas, collectively titled DECALOGUE, that invite us to rethink the meanings of those principles. In the segment for ""Thou Shalt Not Steal,"" for instance, we witness the kidnapping (the theft) of a child from her adopted parents by her natural mother, who thinks she has a right to her custody. Thus, it turns clear-cut moral ideals into real-world dramas that have no clear-cut solutions or judgments.

The THREE COLORS TRILOGY (as well as DECALOGUE) has the scope and richness that truly earn the films' standing as one of the high points of modern cinematic achievements.

Criterion Blu-ray edition of THREE COLORS offers an improved video transfer over the 2003 Miramax/Buena Vista DVD edition.  This is not merely due to the inherent advantage of high-def over standard-def, but also to the fact that Criterion created new remastered transfers that look much better than the old transfers.  The Buena Vista edition looks good for its time, but compared to Criterion's effort, the colors often look too warm and saturated, and details in the shadows are often obscured.  In a trilogy where colors have great visual significance, the better video representation on the Criterion Blu-ray is much welcome and needed.

Criterion also offers DTS HD-MA 2.0 surround tracks for the three films, but you may need to do a bit of funky adjustments to get them to work.  Note that these are 2.0, not 5.1 tracks.  Criterion expects you to use Pro Logic Surround decoding on your audio receiver to turn the 2.0 tracks into surround tracks.  However, older receivers, like mine, may not be able to apply Pro Logic to DTS audio.  So what I did was I had my Blu-ray player first convert the DTS audio into PCM multi-channel audio and pass it to my receiver, and then I was able to apply Pro Logic to the PCM audio.  To compound matters, the WHITE disc's surround audio was encoded incorrectly, yielding 1.0 mono after applying Pro Logic.  Criterion is currently fixing this problem, and will offer a replacement in December to those who already bought the set.  Contact Criterion's point man Jon Mulvaney ( mulvaney@criterion.com ) regarding the replacement.  On the BLUE and RED discs, the surround tracks do work, and with much higher bit rate they do sound better than the surround tracks on the Buena Vista discs.

The fully-loaded Criterion set contains several new supplements, but is also missing a quite a few extras on the Buena Vista set.

Bad news first.  The wonderful full-length audio commentaries by film professor Annette Insdorf on the Buena Vista set are gone.  Also gone are most of the interviews done by MK2 (producer Marin Karmitz's company) in 2001, with actresses Juliette Binoche, Julie Delpy, and Irene Jacob, editor Jacques Witta (for BLUE), and Karmitz (for BLUE and WHITE).  Most of the MK2 featurettes are also gone: ""A Discussion on Kieslowski's Later Years"", ""A Discussion on Working with Kieslowski"", ""Behind the Scenes of White with Kieslowski"", and ""Behind the Scenes of Red with Kieslowski"".  Selected scenes commentaries by Delpy and Jacob are also gone.  Also noticeably missing are two student films by Kieslowski: ""Concert of Wishes"" and ""The Office"".  All these valuable video and audio extras are NOT on the Criterion set.  Needless to say, those who have the Buena Vista set should probably hold on to it.

The Criterion set does retain some of the old extras.  It does have several of the MK2 featurettes: ""Kieslowski's Early Years"", ""Reflections on BLUE"" (featuring the cast and crew, Insdorf, film critic Geoff Andrew, and film director Agnieszka Holland), Marin Karmitz's interview for RED, and Jacques Witta's interview for RED.  It has Binoche's selected scenes commentary for BLUE.  All the wonderful ""cinema lessons"" by Kieslowski are also retained.  The footage of Kieslowski announcing his retirement at Cannes also, thankfully, survived the cut.  Also retained are two of Kieslowski's student films, ""The Tram"" and ""The Face"", although the picture quality of ""The Tram"" is noticeably worse than that on the Buena Vista DVD, with more print damage and a much darker picture.

The all-new extras offered by Criterion are all excellent.  Each film comes with a 22-minute ""video essay"", done by Insdorf for BLUE, film critic Tony Rayns for WHITE, and film writer Dennis Lim for RED.  These segments are essentially audio commentaries with film clips and stills.  While they are well-written and informative, they seem a little too terse, due to their short lengths, compared to Insdorf's full-length commentaries for the Buena Vista DVDs.

There are new interviews with composer Zbigniew Preisner, actors Delpy, Jacob, and Zbigniew Zamachowski, and screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz.  Criterion usually does great interviews, and these are no exception.  They are all more in-depth and comprehensive than their MK2 counterparts.  They were all shot in 2011.  Ten years after they were interviewed by MK2, their enthusiasm and admiration for Kieslowski's work are apparently unchanged.

There are also three wonderful documentaries not on the Buena Vista set.  The 16-minute ""Seven Women of Different Ages"" (1978) shows seven ballet dancers in each day of the week, from a little ballerina to an old ballet teacher, subtly depicting the journey of a dancer and of life itself.  ""Talking Heads"" (1980), running 12 minutes, interviews several people in the order of their ages about who they are and what they want to be; it brings to mind Michael Apted's UP documentaries.  And there is a 1-hour documentary made for Danish TV in 1995 called ""Krzysztof Kieslowski: I'm So-So"", where the just-retired director reminisces about his career, from his early films to his later masterpieces, and we hear many of his pessimistic views about art, life, and politics.  He concludes the film by saying, ""To know is not my job.  Not knowing is.""

The Criterion set also offers a fairly substantial 75-page booklet that includes a 18-page excerpt from the book ""Kieslowski on Kieslowski"" as well as interviews of the three cinematographers of THREE COLORS.  The last page of the booklet also mentions the fact that Pro Logic is needed to hear surround sound, as I mentioned above.

Yes, this Criterion Blu-ray edition is a pricey set, and, unlike the Buena Vista edition, the three films are not sold separately.  But the strength of the video and audio qualities and the comprehensive supplements still make this a worthy purchase.",1316736000,89,8860,5.05777166437414

These are not movies for the Hollywood bubble gum crowd, they are very metaphorical and symbolic. There is no ""action"" in them to speak of.

1824025,5,B000083C5F,"Around here, red, white and blue are known as the colours of the American flag, and they are also the colours of the French flag.  But they also are the names of the late Krzysztof Kieslowski's brilliant ""Three Colours"" trilogy, which has a delicacy that most directors can only dream of. Beautiful, painful, artfully shot, it's a visual feast for anyone who has an appreciation for beauty, subtlety and filmmaking.

In ""Bleu,"" Julie de Courcy (Juliette Binoche) and her family are in a car accident when their brakes fail, and her husband and daughter are killed. Devastated, she leaves her palatial house in the country after a night with her husband's old friend Olivier (Benot Rgent), who has been in love with her for years. And though Julie tries to leave her old life behind, she is pulled in when Olivier starts to finish her husband's last composition -- and he tells her of a side of her husband that she never knew.

In the bitterly funny ""Blanc,"" hairdresser Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) is being coldly divorced by his beautiful wife Dominique (Julie Delpy) because she is sexually dissatisfied with him -- and she takes all his money too. But after returning to Poland, Karol rebuilds his life and fortune, and amid a web of killing, seduction and faked death, he comes up with a way to get back at Dominique...

And ""Rouge"" is the color of love. On her way home from a modelling session, Valentine (Irene Jacob) accidently injures a pregnant dog. The owner is Joseph Kern, (Jean-Louis Trintignant) an embittered ex-judge whose job has left him spiritually adrift, and who now spends his time wiretapping the phones of his neighbors and predicting what will happen in their lives. The friendship between Valentine and Kern grows, even as a young man's current life mirrors what devastated Kern long ago...

The three colours of the French flag symbolize liberty, equality and fraternity -- and these are echoed in the stories of Kieslowski's films. And each of the three movies has its own ""feel"" -- ""Blue"" is cool and sensual, ""White"" was sharp and sexy, and ""Red"" has a sweetness and richness that is truly moving.

And while most directors are just boring when they do slow, arty direction, Kieslowski infused his direction with sensual beauty and endless light and colour, like a painting come to life. And he intertwined many symbolic images and lingering threads from one movie to the next, whether it's an old lady recycling bottles or a rather surprising finale for ""Red"" that brings all three movies' protagonists together.

And he saturated the movies with the colour of their title -- blue is sadness, depth and beauty; white is beautiful and pure, stark and blinding; red is passion and warmth. While this may not have been Kieslowski's intention, the constant presence of these colors (a bridal gown, a swimming pool, and so on) add an extra dimension to the emotions in the story, especially the first.

Juliette Binoche is an extremely good actress, and this movie uses her expressiveness as most movies don't. Zamachowski brings an element of humanity and poignancy to what could have been an idiotic character, and I never felt anything but understanding for this guy. And Irene Jacob brings a sweetness and innocence to her role as Valentine (aptly named, considering the title of the movie she stars in) that is rarely seen in modern movies.

In fact, this trilogy was ripe for a Criterion Collection release, and as usual they're lavishing extras on it -- high-def restorations; improved English subtitles; commentary by Juliette Binoche; interviews with actresses, writers, critics, producers and composers; video essays, a few short films and documentaries by Kieslowski, a feature-length documentary on Kieslowski, and the usual booklet of essays and printed interviews.

Kieslowski was an unusual and extremely talented moviemaker, and his ""Three Colors"" trilogy -- ""Bleu,"" ""Blanc"" and ""Rouge"" -- is an exceptional piece of work. We shall not see his like again.",1313539200,36,4006,4.992503748125937

Rouge is very mystical (for lack of a better word), like the director's Double Vie de Veronique, and it unites the events of all 3 films (i'm being a bit vague, so as not to create a spoiler) at the end in a way that seems to give them transcendent meaning.

There is absolutely no plot, and nothing about the movie makes any sense. So I am sitting there, in physical pain from boredom, waiting until the end just so I can see how they explain this piece of crap, but, alas, it just ends!

1824038,5,B000083C5F,"I'm a movie buff. And I have to say that Krzysztof Kieslowski is my favorite director of all time. It's sad that he's no longer with us now. But I've bought and watched almost everything that this Polish director has directed and made. I love his movies so much, that now I would like to go visit Poland someday because of him. Kieslowski puts so much thought into his films. Even the music plays important roles in his films. All of his films are hauntingly beautiful. The themes and subtle symbols you find in his movies keep you thinking and reflecting deeply about the different messages Kieslowski is sending long after the movies end. I can't express enough how deep and beautiful his movies are. Kieslowski was such a unique director. His movies were raw and true art in motion. He was truly one of a kind, and I honestly believe that there is no filmmaker out there who can match the brilliance of this man's masterpieces. The Colors Trilogy is the ultimate masterpiece. My favorites out of the trilogy are ""Blue"" and ""Red"". Juliette Binoche is one of my favorite actresses of all time. And she is so deep and intense in ""Blue"". Juliette Binoche is the type of actress who gives it her all, and she doesn't disappoint in ""Blue"". If you want to see fine acting by a female actress, watch Juliette Binoche in ""Blue"" - from her crunching on her daughter's blue lollipop to her scraping her hand across the rock wall to her letting the top of the piano slam down - this woman is so deep and really raw in her acting. Juliette Binoche is fearless. I also love ""Red"" because it ties ""Blue"", ""White"", and ""Red"" together. Irene Jacob does a great job in ""Red"". She also did a great job in ""The Double Life of Veronique"". She's like a gentle soul. One of my best friends from my undergraduate college school years knew that I was a big fan of Krzysztof Kieslowski and Juliette Binoche. She said that she went to the movie theater with a friend of hers and that after ""Red"" ended, the whole audience stood up and clapped and gave the film a standing ovation, and that was in my college town! If you watch all three films, you will see why this trilogy is such a masterpiece, and how Kieslowski deserved that standing ovation. I highly and strongly recommend this Three Colors Trilogy.

I don't believe I've ever said this about any film. Kieslowski has created the ultimate (and last) work of a lifetime of observing humans with both a heart and objectivity. 'White', the least of the three, is nevertheless an excellent film that holds our curiosity throughout, and also touches us emotionally without the least hint of sentimentality. The acting is excellent, and the pacing, though slow in the European tradition, is near perfect.
Each movie has a very competent and useful feature-length commentary. In addition, each also has several very useful extras that round out our understanding of the films' narratives, the techniques employed in their making, and the director/writer.

1824040,5,B000083C5F,"I saw these films when they first came out and loved each one a little bit more than the one which came before it.  Blue was a sad film about a woman struggling with new found independence after losing her husband and child in an accident.  It was sad and mysterious.  White is a black comedy about a dueling couple with an uneven power match.  The woman is beautiful and French, the man is not as attractive and Polish.  A duel of wits and power plays define their relationship.  Red is a story of lonely people struggling to connect with others.  It turns a warm, friendly face to the world and is the most heartwarming story of them all.",1248220800,2,640,4.3277310924369745
1824041,5,B000083C5F,"Among the pleasures of watching a Krzysztof Kieslowski film is that you really have to pay attention to what's going on at the present in order to really understand what happens later. And I'm not talking about the major incidents, I'm saying that what often seems insignificant at the time proves to be the portentous key on which the story turns. Kieslowski honed that technique with his masterful Decalogue, and he works it to full efflorescence in the Three Colors Trilogy.
I am not going to rehash the stories as so many others have done so well. But I will say that these are three of the finest moral dramas I've seen in years. Kieslowski forces the viewer to consider many angles on a question he/she may have never considered. His films are almost like short courses in logic and philosophy, but much more interesting.
I like all three films very much, but I think that White is the cleverest and is the most humorous as well. Blue and Red are far more serious and demand the most intellectual engagement. It doesn't hurt one's attention span that the female leads are all attractive and sexy in their own very different ways.
Some viewers used to fast-paced American films may find these three masterworks too low-key and methodical for their tastes. And methodical they may be although they never fail to surprise. But if you are one who prefers films that are intellectually stimulating and ultimately satisfying, then the Three Colors Trilogy may be for you. Be sure to watch them in the order of Blue, White, then Red. Pay close attention to all three and your time will be rewarded.",1238371200,3,1597,4.707142857142857

In ""Blue,"" Julie de Courcy (Juliette Binoche) and her family are in a car accident when their brakes fail. Julie is injured, but her composer husband and their daughter die. She can't bring herself to commit suicide, but neither can she just go home and get over it. So instead she leaves her palatial house in the country after a night with her husband's old friend Olivier (Benot R&eacute;gent), who has been in love with her for years.

Julie arrives in Paris with nothing but a blue cut-glass lampshade, takes back her maiden name, rents an apartment, and tries to leave her old life behind. Though she says she doesn't want love or friends (because they are ""traps""), she befriends a promiscuous young woman and is pulled back to Olivier when he starts to finish her husband's unfinished work. In turn, Olivier reveals to her the side of her husband she never knew -- the other woman he loved.

""Blanc"" is more of a comedy than a tragedy, but there is an element of sadness as well. Hairdresser Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) is being coldly divorced by his beautiful wife Dominique (Julie Delpy) because she is sexually dissatisfied with him. She also strips him of his money and possessions, leaving him playing pitiful music at the subways. What's more, she rubs it in his face that she's now having sex with other men.

Things can't get worse, right? Wrong: Karol goes back to Poland and ends up getting beaten up and robbed. Via some not-so-legal methods, Karol builds himself an impressive fortune and becomes determined to get back at his cold, manipulative ex-wife. Amid a web of killing, seduction and faked death, Karol finds the perfect method to bring Dominique down...

And ""Rouge"" is the color of love. On her way home from a modelling session, Valentine (Irene Jacob) accidently runs over and injures a pregnant dog. The owner is Joseph Kern, (Jean-Louis Trintignant) an embittered, cynical ex-judge whose years of condemnation and acquittal have left him spiritually adrift. He now spends his time alone in his house, wiretapping the phones of his neighbors and predicting what will happen in their lives.

After Valentine expresses disgust at Joseph's activities, he turns himself in to the authorities. Their friendship grows into a bond of differing values and unhappy histories. As Valentine prepares to leave for England, the judge reveals the tragic circumstances of his early life -- a tragedy mirrored by some of the people he has been spying on.

The three colours of the French flag symbolize liberty, equality and fraternity -- and these are echoed in the stories of Kieslowski's films. And each of the three movies has its own ""feel"" -- ""Blue"" is cool and sensual, ""White"" was sharp and sexy, and ""Red"" has a sweetness and richness that is truly moving.

And while most directors are just boring when they do slow, arty direction, Kieslowski infused his direction with sensual beauty and endless light and colour, like a painting come to life. And he intertwined many symbolic images and lingering threads from one movie to the next, whether it's an old lady recycling bottles or a rather surprising finale for ""Red"" that brings all three movies' protagonists together.

And he saturated the movies with the colour of their title -- blue is sadness, depth and beauty; white is beautiful and pure, stark and blinding; red is passion and warmth. While this may not have been Kieslowski's intention, the constant presence of these colors (a bridal gown, a swimming pool, and so on) add an extra dimension to the emotions in the story, especially the first.

Juliette Binoche is an extremely good actress, and this movie uses her expressiveness as most movies don't. Zamachowski brings an element of humanity and poignancy to what could have been an idiotic character, and I never felt anything but understanding for this guy. And Irene Jacob brings a sweetness and innocence to her role as Valentine (aptly named, considering the title of the movie she stars in) that is rarely seen in modern movies.

Kieslowski was an unusual and extremely talented moviemaker, and his ""Three Colors"" trilogy -- ""Bleu,"" ""Blanc"" and ""Rouge"" -- is an exceptional piece of work. We shall not see his like again.",1222387200,2,4763,4.917808219178082
1824044,5,B000083C5F,"Blue, White, Red were named after the colors of the French flag with the movie themes of liberty, equality and fraternity.  The three films are largely unconnected in their story lines but have similar construction:

* Terrific casting
* Each move has a lead or co-lead who is a beauty
* Slow moving
* Characters are deeply introspective and emotional
* Generally few words by and among the major players however facial expressions and the ""unsaid"" pull you along and visually tell the story
* Colors and cinematography project a dream-like state
* The movie title colors (Blue/White/Red) are beautifully emphasized and subtly set in the each film (blue sky, blue water, blue chandelier).

In Blue, the director's subject is ""liberty"" which is intended to represent emotional ""liberty.""  The film is set in Paris.  Julie's husband (a famous composer) and child are killed in a car accident.  In her grief, she tries to distance herself from her former life by cutting all her ties (sells her house and her belongings, gives away much of her money, moves and tells no one) - - but she finds that leaving it all behind is not so simple.  In her grief, she is also stunned to learn secrets about her family which further adds to her grief.  She eventually turns back to music as her solace and turns to an old friend for companionship and love - and both begin to pull her out of the darkness.

In White, the director's subject is ""equality.""  Karol moves his wife from Poland to Paris where she proceeds to divorce him, humiliate him and abandon him because of his inability to consummate their marriage.  He is thrown out on the streets of Paris penniless.  Karol schemes to move back to Poland where he becomes a successful businessman and plots his revenge.  And revenge he gets at a significant personal cost.

In Red, the director's subject is ""fraternity"" where he shows unrelated characters with little in common coming together to develop a close relationship.  The movie is set in Geneva where a professional model (Valentine) meets a retired judge in a chance meeting after she runs over his dog.  Valentine learns that the retired judge is listening in on his neighbors' phone conversations and she despises him for it.  She happens to visit him on several other occasions after she returns with the dog from the vet.  He begins to see and appreciate the ""goodness"" in her - so he turns himself in to authorities for the illegal surveillance and begins to open up to her. They eventually form a very close relationship as she learns his life history.  And, other characters loosely connect to the storyline.  This film was the most difficult of the three to follow as other characters loosely connect to the storyline - but this film like the other two was equally engaging and moving.",1216425600,3,2794,4.757261410788382
1824045,5,B000083C5F,"This is a tremendous bargain. All three of these films are terrific on their own, but they are much easier to appreciate all together. It may be worth mentioning that the stories are largely unconnected (although they do intersect at certain times). This isn't really a narrative trilogy (like Star Wars), but a thematic one. Each film is named after a color of the French flag, and is supposed to represent the same ideal (Blue=Liberty, White=Equality, Red=Fraternity). But these concepts take on slightly twisted forms in the films; for example, Blue begins with a woman being ""liberated"" from an unhappy marriage by means of a car accident which kills her husband and child. Liberty is great, but it can also be violent and emotionally painful. The Three Colors films challenge us to see these kinds of complications in what we otherwise may take for granted.

In case the above paragraph didn't make this clear, these films are not easy viewing. They are slow, they are not in English, and they most likely will demand multiple viewings to fully appreciate.

1824048,5,B000083C5F,"I just rewatched all three movies again and I must say that Red is by far the best film where magic happend. The other two just are not up to par with Red, but Red is an exceptional film that is so rare to find. Red was so relaxing to watch! It feels like a poem or watching a painting come to life. I believe it is about how compassion, or opening of the heart, splits all notions of time and space and exposes a different reality that is just outside the one we are living in, as in an alternate reality. The powerful force of a compassionate heart changes the destiny of several lives. It is a story about the breaking through to the divine within the human heart that connects us all; the mysterious dimension of the universe that is not available to the senses and is much bigger then the human seen dimension.

The woman in the movie, Valentine, was sad and went through the motions of her life seemingly disconnected from herself and her happiness. Her boyfriend was jealous and was not sure he loved her, and her brother was on the streets from drug use and Valentine seemed to be void of life, even though she was a successful model and ballerina dancer. As they showed her life they also showed the life of her across the street neighbor. He was studying to become a Judge and he too had a life that was not fulfilling or living up to his potential. Valentine and the young man never met, but their stories intertwined as if they were just out of sync with time. Mysterious and spiritual forces worked in the background weaving their lives together.

One day Valentine was driving around sad and she hit a dog. She jumped out of the car and saw the dog was bleeding. She took it to the owner outside of town. He was a dejected and bitter older retired Judge, who spent his time listening in on telephone conversations of his neighbors through a radio he setup. Once Valentine heard the conversations she became agitated and told him it is wrong. She was a sweet innocent young woman pure in beauty and their lives touched. Her loving heart changed him and he later turned himself into the police and they shut down his radio for good. She saw that in the paper and went to see him. It was his birthday and they shared some peach brandy and talked about their lives. She was to go see her boyfriend and he told her to take the Ferry. She bought a ticket.

Meanwhile the young Judge found out his girlfriend was cheating on him and he got dejected and followed her around. He too got a ticket on the same ferry as Valentine. The older Judge came to see Valentine at her modeling show and he told her similar stories of his life that mirrored the life of the young Judge. He then told her the story of his love cheating on him, just like the young Judge's story but having it end there with him lost never finding love again. Then he said that maybe the woman he never met was Valentine, making the story really feel magical like the alternate reality, just out of sync with time, would happen. And when the Ferryboat capsized and we saw the survivors as Valentine and the young Judge, we knew they would have the life they were both meant to have and somehow the older Judge would have that life too.

Excellent movie that just feels so good. The streets of the small European town, the building and their environments were all so beautiful and magical as well. I like those big coffee cups and the warm cozy feel of their lives. No cell phones, no TV's just life pure and simple and how compassion can open the heart and transform lives so profoundly that lost lives can become renewed and the very reality of time as we know it can be changed forever. Love is the healing force of the world that is what is required to transcend stuck sorrowful lives. One of the best films ever made.",1195776000,3,3794,4.346967559943582

Most of the time they were over the actors' mouths (and I'm not averse to seeing Juliette Binoche's mouth).

Having complained about subtitles, I'm now going to complain about their absence. Crucially, in the magnificent montage that concludes the film, when Julie's overwhelming new piece of music is finally heard in its entirety, the subtitles don't even bother conveying the words (from 1 Corinthians 13) that accompany the chorus.

These are important thematically ('If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love...') and are anticipated in earlier dialogue ('Do you know what words the chorus will sing?'). The impact is diminished by excluding them, even if it means that you can see the visual glory of the montage without there being writing all over it!

1824055,5,B000083C5F,"I would be remiss if I didn't decry the injustice that none of the films or the director, Kieslowski, ever won an Oscar. In 1995 the screenplay for The third film, Red, was nominated for best original screenplay, and Kieslowski was nominated for best director; but alas, neither won. Inexcusably, the film wasn't even nominated for Best Foreign Film.

Yet the Trilogy will undoubtedly endure while the Oscar winners of those years will be largely forgotten. Why? Well, let's start with all the Hollywood cliches about screenplays: story arc, plot points, blah blah blah. Open any screenwriting guide and you'll find that the first plot point arrives on page (and therefore minute) 20. Check it out. Twenty minutes into a film, something happens which causes the action to swerve in a new direction.

If we follow up the idea that all art works from some ""center,"" some gravitational focal point which draws us in, then the vast majority of Hollywood films work from a a plot-driven center: a character must overcome an obstacle, there's something at stake which has to be resolved by a voyage, and so on. On ocasion, the center of a movie will be the transformation of a character. In a good movie, the two are seamlessly overlaid.

Thus, in Casablanca, the ""something at stake"" is Victor Lazlow's escape to America, and the transformation is Rick's emergence from self-pity to understanding, sacrifice and action.

To take but one of the Trilogy, Red. What makes Red so intriguing (other than its visual virtuosity) is the ambiguity at its center. Exactly what is the ""plot""? A model accidentally hits a dog and finds the owner, who feigns indifference. The model cares for the dog and establishes a vague sort of relationship with the owner, an irascible retired judge.

Not much here in terms of story arc and other Hollywood conventions. But there is a beating heart to the story, perhaps even several. One is certainly ""contingency,"" a philosophic word for chance, serendipity and even synchronicity. Things happen in a causally linked but outwardly haphazard fashion.

Another center in this film is intimacy, the difficulties of intimacy and the secrets plumbed or hidden in intimacy. The model's boyfriend seems to be extremely suspicious of her; during every call, he cross-examines her as if unbelieving she is truly alone. We never see him, we only hear his disembodied voice. When she asks him if he loves her, he replies, ""I think I do, which is the same thing."" She demurs. The retired judge, meanwhile, is secretly listening to the intimate phone conversations of his neighbors.

A third center to the movie is how patterns of human behavior and relationships pop up again and again. Thus the judge's own story of a lover's betrayal is played out by a promising young lawyer, and perhaps also by the model's own relationship with the boyfriend. The charm of the film is that these patterns, overlays and elliptical references are not announced, they are hinted, suggested, brushed on in chiaroscuro.

The use of color is unavoidably central in the films, as befits a series of movies named after the French tricolor flag, as are the themes of liberte, egalite et fraternite. Yet just as striking is the powerful deployment of music. You would be hard-pressed to name another film which wasn't specifically about music itself (i.e. The Last Waltz, etc.) with a better vocabulary of musical flourishes and colors. This is clearly referenced in the first film, Blue, whose main characters are composers and their lovers.

The transformation of character is understated in Red, but it is nonetheless visible. The judge turns himself in for spying, and returns from his punishment a better man. His dog, the one he cared so little for at the beginning, has a litter of puppies. As for the model, her growth is nearly invisible, but we sense it beneath the surface. The film ends with her traveling to see her boyfriend in London, leaving us with the anticipation of some discovery, revelation and perhaps closure or renewal. Maybe the model hasn't changed much so far, but we sense that her experiences have prepared her to deal forthrightly with her boyfriend's infidelity. At least that's my read of a purposefully, and artfully, ambiguous movie about life's inherent ambiguities.",1147996800,8,4292,4.9665738161559885

1824071,5,B000083C5F,"High-concept filmmaking can be a dangerous endeavor. Too often, directors get overly bogged down in their own ideas or alienate their audiences with over-the-top stylization or sheer pretention. However, The Decalouge (a ten part television series dealing with the Ten Commandments, released in Poland in 1988) proved that Krzysztof Kieslowski was one of a rare breed. Along with writing partner Krzysztof Piesiewicz, he's able to fully dramatize his ideas and frame them with such visual and aural flair that harkens back to the golden age of filmmaking. So it fits that for his final project, he took on the unusual task of creating three films for France's bicentennial - each dealing with one of the colours on the French flag, and its corresponding attribute.

The first film in the trilogy is Blue, which is meant to represent freedom. Blue is the story of Julie (Juliette Binoche), the wife of a famous composer who had been creating a piece to commemorate the unification of Europe. However, at the beginning of the film, her husband and five year old daughter are killed in a car crash. Unable to bring herself to suicide, Julie instead leaves her former life behind in an only semi-successful attempt to reinvent herself, despite the love of a colleauge of her husband's, Olivier (Benoit Regent).

The second film (often argued to be the weakest) is White, symbolizing equality. White tells us of Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski), a polish man living in France. His french wife Dominique (Julie Deply) divorces him after only six months because he is impotent and even frames him for arson. Having lost everything, he returns to Poland, where a suicidal friend named Mikolai (Janusz Gajos) helps him create a strange revenge against his lover.

The final film (and by far the strongest) is Red, representing the ideal of fraternity. In Red, Valentine (Irene Jacob), a Swiss model living in Paris stumbles across an elderly retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who uses surveillance equipment to eavesdrop on his neighbours. Instead of being repelled, her nature causes her to form an unlikely friendship with this man, and their bond has echoes beyond themselves - most notably with Valentine's young neighbour, a fellow Swiss citizen named Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit).

Stylistically, each entry is unique. Blue is a stark tragedy, laced with long visual takes and very deliberately spoken dialouge. The score of the film - a haunting and delicate affair by Zbigniew Preisner - was written before the film was shot, so that the action could move to the pace of the music. This is an unusual technique, but it works gloriously and fits in context of the story, since music is this film's ""MacGuffin,"" if you will - it's the way the characters communicate what they are unable to say. Juliette Binoche is really the only STAR of the film - she gets almost all the screen time and her performance is nuanced and restrained. She reveals Julie very slowly and very strongly fleshes out the grieving process one goes through in reaction to such a devestating event.

White, on the other hand, is a comedy, albiet with the blackest of spirits a comedy could have. Karol's antics are sometimes almsot Chaplin-esuqe; witness the scene in which he attempts to hide a gun in his pants. Zamachowski's Karol is both a fun, intruigiung character and a bitter, unsympathetic anti-hero, often at the same time, and he's matched by Julie Deply's performance. Her icy beauty belies a chaotic underside that manifests itself occasionally, as when she torches her salon to get Karol out of it. Edward Klosinski's cinematography accentuates the subtext of the film - the bright idealised colours of the Parisian streets are contrasted with the cold, but somehow more real browns, whites and grays of Poland.

Red, however, is the masterpiece. Neither tragedy, nor comedy, it's a tale of the human spirit - Piesiewicz called it ""a film against indifference."" It uses such devices as telephones, dogs and  carefully shot near-encounters to tell the story of isolated lives. Irene Jacob's Valentine is the idealisation of the modern woman (person, really). She lives alone, her boyfriend is across the channel, her work friends don't truly understand her nature, and yet she is optimistic, sweet and honestly believes in the good in people. Her connection with the Judge is important for both of them. The casting of one time hot-male-lead Trintignant is clearly conscious. Now robbed of the vitality he once had, Valentine gives him a second chance as much as he reveals herself to herself. I wish I could say more, but I really wouldn't want to give the awesome nature of this story away. Visually speaking it's also the warmest film of the three and the use of light throughout is magnificent - there's a scene in which the characters stand in the light of the Judge's old house that's absolutely breathtaking.

Although one could view the three films individually, it's only as a whole that they truly make sense, and noting the connections - both cinematically and symbolically - is one of the best parts of the series. For example, all three films begin with a sense of motion, shrouded in the colour the film deals with. Blue opens with a shot underneath a speeding motorcar on a cold, rainy day. White follows a particular suitcase of note as it moves down a conveyor belt at the Warsaw airport. Red moves us along telephone lines, tracing the path of a missed connection. Likewise, each film concludes with one of it's central characters looking at the camera through a glass of some kind.

The nature of all three films, however, is about love. Blue and White are both somewhat harsh in their treatment - freedom clearly comes with a price, and the power struggles inherent in equality can lead to more conflict than they're worth. Julie is shedding her past and Karol is getting revenge - both antagonistic actions, but Valentine - even when faced with a repulsive character, as the Judge originally seems, is willing to look for the best in someone. Fraternity is about forming real human connections - a deep form of love that's what's truly valuable. This is illustrated best in one of the most concrete connections between the three films: each of the main characters encounters an elderly woman trying to fit a bottle into a recycling bin she cannot quite reach. While Julie and Karol both only watch, even if with a real human interest, Valentine is the only one of the three who helps her. The end of Red, however, gives us all hope. Without giving too much away, three couples - one from each film - are united amidst the most tragic of circumstances - saved from doom by fate or chance or God or whatever you believe - and their meeting ties up the ideals of all three films into one amazing package.

Movies like this are the reason I love movies. They're visually beautiful, dramatically accomplished and honest-to-God moving. If you can only see one, Red is one of the best films of the 1990s, but all three are VERY highly reccomended.",1130284800,10,7044,4.887029288702929

None of these films is a ""sequel"" (and though there is a ""wrap up"" of sorts at the end of *Red*, you really could watch them in any order, which in itself is quite neat).  Also, Kieslowski has to be one of the most *awake* directors in the history of cinema--every single scene in each of his films is a carefully prepared canvas, with every detail well worth examining and all the backgrounds worth paying attention to (so be sure to see these films on DVD and with a nice-quality screen in front of you).  You'll almost feel as if you're breathing the very air of Paris, Geneva, and Warsaw, so vivid and compelling are the settings.  Finally, the acting in all three of the films is uniformly expert and fantastic.

Nonetheless, I have finished my first viewing of the trilogy (and I saw it in this order: BRW) with a somewhat empty and even slightly cheated feeling.  For one thing, I can't help but think that the ""color concept"" becomes over-determining and distracting.  I wish Kieslowski had spent more time exploring the characters and (particularly in the case of *White*) making the storylines less contrived rather than trying to ""create so many cool color connections"" (that's the only way I can put it) on the mere surface of the screen.  Colors in their most primary form are simplistic symbols rather than meaningful expressions, and they are used far too often throughout these films merely as eye-candy.  One has to admit, however, that without the color gimmickry, this trilogy would not have become so well known.

Of the three, *White* is the one I watched most recently and am most disappointed by.  Zamachowski's performance is perfectly executed, but his character (Karol Karol) is one that we've seen performed by Dustin Hoffman countless times before (Zamachowski in fact looks so much like Hoffman that I almost want to call his character in this film ""Kramer Kramer"").  Actually, the entire storyline of *White* is built on shockingly unoriginal cliches and over-used plot devices (the hapless fool who turns out to be capable of building a corporate empire overnight; the world weary acquaintance who first seeks his own death then learns to love and embrace life; the faked funeral where the ""dead"" can witness the reaction of the grieving; the whole ""turning of the tables,"" etc.).  The weakest element of the film turns out to be the role of Dominique (played by Julie Delpy, who deserved a much better part than this), whose shallow and simplistic character belongs on the pages of a comic book rather than in a Kieslowski film.  In general, there's a decided lack of psychological verity to *White*.

*Blue*, by great contrast, spends most of its time trying to penetrate the mind and soul of Juliette Binoche's character.  The story of this film is also quite contrived--but its atmosphere, mood and ambience more than compensate.  For what it's worth, Kieslowski also does ""cooler"" things with blue than he does with the other two colors.

As for *Red*, while it may be the most perfectly executed of the three films, it has also proved for me to be the least memorable.  This is where I found the use of color most distracting and annoying.  Or perhaps I'm just allergic to red...

In spite of all the flaws I've mentioned here, there's something undeniably unique about this trilogy--and regardless of where you start, once you've seen one of the films, you'll most certainly want to see the other two as well.",1108166400,7,3931,4.737151248164464
1824078,5,B000083C5F,"After more than a decade, I still consider Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours: Blue, White, and Red to be the most remarkable trilogy I've ever seen. When I saw these 3 films, I was still an adolescent, and I was so moved and mesmerized. Now that I get a repete viewing, I still enjoy them tremendously!
BLUE: ""Juliette Binoche rises from the ""deep-blue"" ocean of trauma and depression.""
Before Juliette Binoche made her Oscar-winning The English Patient and Oscar nominated Chocolat, she gave a ""deep-blue"" performance in Blue that won her the best actress award at the Venice Film Festival. When I saw Blue, I instantly became her fan, depite the fact that she played a nasty role in Damage(Jeremy Iron) that same year.
Blue will always be her signature movie, because it's the most challenging role she's ever played, and it's definitely more powerful than the performances from Julie Delpy(White) and Iron Jacob(Red).
She plays Julie, a young French woman who had survived a car accident that took the lives of her famous composer husband and daughter. She was so tramatized that she isolated herself from the world, and gradually leans toward her musician friend(Benoit Regent) for sexual pleasure as she slowly revive herself. I couldn't forget the scene when she rubbed her hand against the wall and it started to bleed. It was so disturbing and emotionally impacting. Eventually, she found out that her dead husband had been unfaithful to her......
I noticed that there was a scene in this movie that was weaved into White. When Julie was looking for someone in the courtroom building, she ""accidently"" walked into the room where White was being shot. I guessed K.K. wanted to somehow connect Blue to White while he was making both films at the same time, even though the stories are not connected.
Other than the stunning performance from Binoche, the score, cinematography, and art direction were impeccable! Blue is the most depressing of the trilogy, but it's my favorite, because Binoche moved me to tears.
WHITE: ""Zbigniew Zamachowski gets even with Julie Delpy.""
White is the least complex and it's a revenge comedy. Julie Delpy divorced her husband(Zbigniew Zamachowski) after a 6 month marriage, because she's not fulfilled sexually as result of his impotence. Z.Z. was broken hearted and leaved France and headed home(Poland) to rebuild his life. Eventually, he returned to France after planning a scheme of vengeance against his ex-wife.....
Julie Delpy does a fine job at portraying a bad gir, but her character is underwritten and it's supporting role to the more touching and wonderful Zamachowski. Oh well, if you hate her here, than you'll love her in Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. It was good to see White after seeing the heavy-duty Blue.
RED: ""The mystery between Irene Jacob and a stranger old man.""
Red may be the most critically acclaimed of the trilogy, but I didn't enjoyed it as much as I did for Blue and White. I found it to be a bit intricate and the story didn't really touch me. Though I was mesmerized by the cinematograph, especially when Irene Jaocob does her runway fashion show and the ""bubble gum"" photo shoot. I think she was more memorable in The Double Life of Veronica which was also directed by K.K. Red is about the encounter between Jacob and a retired judge whom has a mystery to share with her. Red is K.K.'s final film.",1104019200,2,3379,4.888501742160279
1824089,5,B000083C5F,"We know that Kieslowski titled this triology after the colors in the French flag.  But the intention is rather more subtle than that.

The colors of the French flag stand for the three pillars of the Revolution -- Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.

And thus the films each take as their theme one of those principles.  ""Red,"" symbolizing Liberty on the flag, is about a woman who must set herself free from a set of emotional entanglements.

""White,"" Equality, is about a man seeking in a strange, compelling way, to equalize a relationship.

""Blue,"" for many the most cinematically beautiful of the three, is about Fraternity, or connection.  It is the culmination of the trilogy, and of Kieslowski's life.  In it he shows that it is only through connection with others that our own lives can take on meaning.

In the end and taken as a whole, the trilogy was Kieslowski's way of telling us that valuing personal freedom (Liberty) too highly can lead to a sterile and lonely life.  Entering into relationships carrying a ledger, trying to maintain an even balance on both sides (Equality) is meaningless and painful.  It is only through connection to others that the self has value, that life is given meaning and richness.  Indeed, it saves us from ourselves.

These films are beautiful and moving in their own right.  Taken as a message from Kieslowski at the end of his life about the values he had discovered, they are extraordinarily powerful, rising beyond cinema to art.",1097625600,6,1478,4.836653386454183
1824090,5,B000083C5F,".
In the Three Colours Trilogy, the late director Krzysztof Kieslowski poses subtle questions about the nature of our individual identities.

Like Shakespeare, he draws a map of the human soul.

In Blue we meet Julie who has just lost her husband and daughter in a road accident. She seeks liberty from her sadness by attempting reinvent herself and isolate herself from her previous life. But, she is ceaselessly drawn back into the past by the people of her life. No, for Julie there is no escape from who she is or who she was.

In White, oddly enough, a black humour pervades.  It is a tale of marital revenge and the strange odysseys that love can often send us on. Our hero Karol Karol must discover the hard way that one does not achieve true equality in revenge, even perfect revenge.

Red deals with the nature of coincidence, parallel lives and unlikely friendships. In this regard it is not unlike La Double Vie De Veronique. It shares the same lead actress (the highly talented Irene Jacob) and the same levels of innuendo and suggestion. One gets the feeling that there are mysteries within mysteries here as the story of our heroine's friendship with a retired judge unfolds.

At the very end of Red, the lead characters from the Trilogy come together for one brief moment. To say more would spoil it - but it's highly satisfying.

If you enjoy good film-making and like stories that put the human condition centre stage don't miss this trilogy. See them in order and see them all!

1824094,5,B000083C5F,"BLEU (TROIS COLEURS) / France/Poland 1993 (4 STARS)
23 January 2004: The thing that stands out most about Blue is the expression (or lack there of) of grief. How does a woman, seemingly fulfilled by happiness, react when that happiness is yanked away in one telling moment, in a car accident in which both her husband and her daughter pass away? That is the central understudy - a strong woman's attempts at finding purpose in the seeming absence of meaning.
* Mise-en-scene: I watched an interview with Juliette Binoche, where she mentions that Kieslowski refused to make the film unless it had her in it. It's easy to see why. I can't imagine Bleu without Juliette - its not just that she lends her personality to the film...Bleu IS Binoche.
* I was thrown off by the sub-plots of the character's relationships with her mother and the striptease dancer, as I was about the seeming resolution at the end of the film. There were perhaps references that I missed but the 'almost happy' ending left me feeling un-relinquished. Given that I had shared such an intense journey with Julie, it seemed almost improper to accept that she would settle in to a normal relationship again.
* Cinematography: The 1st shot of the film - that of a car tire racing - shot from the bottom of the moving car establishes this as 'not your typical movie'. The sequence-of-shots that follow eerily draw one into the compelling story-telling style of Krzysztof Kieslowski, minimalist in its approach, with a world communicated without dialogue in the first five minutes of the film.
* Blue is not your typical art-house film. Its production values are up there with the best, and the cinematography by Slavomir Idziak (who's craft was recognized by Hollywood in Black Hawk Down), is nothing short of stunning.
* The lighting is low key and soft, and wraps around the characters to create a mood of subtlety. A distinguishing feature is the detail in the shadows. None of the close-ups fully illuminate the protagonist, almost  hinting at her vulnerability at facing the light, though the delicate use of eye-lights does well to bring alive her emotions.
* The camera, an intelligently used narrative element, interacts with Julie and partakes in her emotions, respecting them and yet accentuating their intensity as she plods on in an alien world of deep personal purposelessness. The tight close-ups penetrate her soul and force us to delve into Julie's mind and share in her agony.
* Editing: deftly uses match on action to create irony while forwarding the narrative.
* Sound: The pace is hauntingly slow and silence has been used compellingly. It screams with meaning and becomes one of the more important elements as the narrative progresses.
Bleu is not a film you can watch, consume and move on. Either you'll feel that you've totally wasted your time and will probably not be able to sit through (the pivotal occurrence is over within the first five minutes of the film without a single world being spoken, and the rest of the film is essentially the protagonist's psychologically subjective journey) or you'll realize by the time you've reached the end that you'll revisit this film at various points in time, explore and read about it, discuss it with people you respect, and try to get closer to the essence of Kieslowski. For there are two now well-accepted truths about the folklore surrounding Kieslowski, whose reputation continues to mount posthumously...1. that Kieslowski carefully interwove elements that were rich with meaning and social irony, and 2. that figuring those elements out and appreciating their implications is probably a lifelong learning  process.",1074816000,4,3660,4.969004893964111

1824097,4,B000083C5F,"Good God people! When first we wade through the effusive praises heaped upon Kieslowski's metaphysical interpretation (so to speak) of le drapeau tricolore by so many star-struck and goggle-eyed foreign film enthusiasts that the reviews become indistinguishable, we are inclined at first to be dismissive in our reading. However it may appear that this review is nothing more than a rant contre les autres (against the others) it is not. I promised some reality didn't I? In reality these reviews, the majority of which though rather over the top, have been just in their critique of the trilogy. Within reason however Kieslowski's masterpiece is NOT as many profess the GREATEST FOREIGN FILMAKING of ALL time. Ah yes, I fully endorse the enthusiastic post coital praises, the rose tinted glasses, the luscious afterglow of film magic, yet shouldn't we also visit Truffaut (the workman filmaker), Bertolucci's 1900 perhaps, lest we forget Felini or Schlorndorf's The Tin Drum, or the daring of German Expressionists like Murnau or Fritz Lang?
Now, leaving out but not forgetting many other auteurs like Wertmuller, Visconti, Passolini, and more, we have a veritable Mt. Olympus of film greats among whom Kieslowski rests comfortably. His achievement stands by itself as a work by a storyteller. A director tells a story and does it well, he earns his living. He crafts, imbues, layers and provokes in the same medium as storyteller, and if he leaves us yearning for more then this may be greatness. This director has met these parameters and exceeded them. These three films achieved what he set out to accomplish. They were pieces in a lyric poem told visually, emotionally, and with enough obscurity they left us thinking and questioning. The director succeded and we went home to digest it, his little post cold war morality play on libert, galit, et fraternit.
In conclusion, another small dose of reality: The only negative review encountered was in the end the most honest and real including this one. Though I disagree, and would council that reviewer to wean his dependence upon naive and simplistic cinema, which so conveniently wraps up all loose ends so we may go home secure in the knowlege that there isn't anything out there we might not comprehend, I neither fault nor denigrate his opinion which is personal. There is much to be thankful for in American cinema and much greatness therein as well. Let us be careful in our use of superlatives and generalizations when judging the work of others, yet still recommend on merit with qualified praise. Finally, if you the viewing public has yet to see these films then do so. Blue, White and Red are well worth your time. Having been a serious student of film for over 25 years now, I give my guarantee that anyone who's an admirer of European film will profit from and be enriched by the experience.",1066521600,37,2861,4.937759336099585

It is striking at the first glimpse, although one forgets about it as one watches the movies. It is only the second time I watched ""blue"" that I realized I had been staring at a screen that most of the time was... blue! Same thing with ""white"" and ""red"". Real masterpieces of picture, as they are of music, action and screenplay. Also a very sharp analysis of society and human relationships, in which much of the interpretation is left open to the viewer. I can't add much more to what has already been said in other reviews.

1824119,5,B000083C5F,"The praise that most of the other reviewers heap upon this Trilogy is well-deserved. They are collectively a brilliant piece of film-making, and Blue and Red are exquisite on their own (White less so).  As I struggled to understand the actions of Binoche's character, which aren't entirely explained, I realized that French audiences like having to wrestle with such questions--unlike American audiences, French audiences don't want things handed.  Thus it is up to each viewer to decide why Binoche does what she does.  My own opinion is that after the death of her husband and daughter, she no longer wants to want anything, and the film is the story of her gradual recovery of her desire.
To correct a comment made by another reviewer, I think that White comes first.  There is a scene in Blue that won't make complete sense unless you have seen White first.  Also, unlike some of the reviewers, I think that White represent liberty, not equality.  Issues of control and freedom are central to White, while Blue addresses the question of equality within relationships (although I can see why some would see Blue as being about freedom).  Red is definitely about fraternity.

Because these movies are misunderstood, it will take time before he will be recognised in the future as one of the greatest directors of all time. I would liken him to the animator/writer/director of ""Castle in the Sky"". He wrote and directed the entire production. The key in why these are great are their subtlety.
After watching the movie again with the commentary track, I realized all the numerous clues of symbolism, using light and reflection and angles and positioning and colors he uses to give hints and clues to the viewer in what seems a boring ordinary story of everyday life. He replicates images throughout the movie, and once it's pointed out, one sees the movie in and entirely different viewpoint. I totally missed most of them, and the true symbolism and themes which pervade the movies. I would have said pulp fiction was better too, but now I believe Red should've won the Cannes award that year, except there were too many dummies like me in the audience who just didn't get it.

1824123,5,B000083C5F,"I am referring to Blue exclusively here.
It was the first of the trilogy to be released, and I think the strongest of the trilogy, as well as the most rewarding to see by itself.
Juliette Binoche is nothing short of a revelation here.  Her performance is so emotionally naked and raw, it is almost hard to watch.  Her study of a woman consumed with the loss of her husband and only child is devastating.  Binoche is one of those actors that can convey more emotion in a look or an expression than most can with an epic monologue.  In fact, what I took away from the film initially is how much was unleashed without really saying much of anything.  She is perfect for this role, and it is arguably the best performance of her career thus far, and one in which she won a Cesar award for Best Actress.
The style of the film is totally unique.  There are breathtaking moments of genius spread throughout the film.  The camera is such a languid yet probing force in Blue, showing you things that are out of view and lending fascinating perspective to the characters.  There is a shot I recall in a hospital, when the camera has a tight shot on an eye, only to reveal a doctor looking down to the patient.  It is remarkable that these elements do not feel gimmicky at all.  They simply become part of the language of the story.  The cinematography is just gorgeous.  The colors and the use of focus add tension and depth to the visual space, leaving some images behind that are both abstract and precise.
I remember feeling really out of touch when I left the theatre after seeing Blue.  It is so cliche, but I really felt like I had been dreaming.  The images that I recalled reminded me of the kinds you recall when you wake up from a dream.  You have a series of images or situations, and are kind of left to extrapulate what they mean.  This film is very similar.  Even though the story has played itself out in a way that is easy to understand, there are so many elements that float to the surface that are puzzling, and leave traces of themselves behind.  The ending is often explained by different people in many different ways, and this is one of the most marvelous things about the film.  It leaves a lot to the imagination, which is a criminally underappreciated tactic in films today.
I was quite thrilled to hear the Trilogy was coming out on DVD, because it was impossible to find a copy of Blue in any format for quite some time.  I had relied on an overused VHS of the film for years, and taped it once when it was playing on Bravo.  The problem was that Bravo edits almost everything, so I was pretty sure I was missing parts of the movie.
If you have never seen this film, please allow yourself the opportunity.  It is one of my all-time personal favorites, and probably one of the best films to survive the 1990's.",1055635200,5,2826,4.363288718929255
1824124,4,B000083C5F,"The RED, WHITE and BLUE trilogy refers to the colors of the French flag. This must be a declaration of patriotism or admiration from the films' director, Krzysztof Kieslowski, since the various storylines mostly take place outside France. Go figure.
In BLUE, Julie (Juliette Binoche) mentally recuperates from the loss of her family in an auto accident, of which she was the only survivor. In WHITE, Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) emotionally recovers from a humiliating divorce and shabby treatment by his ex. In RED, Valentine (Irene Jacob) copes after injuring a dog with her car.
Though each film is a complete story in itself, BLUE and WHITE must be viewed before RED. At RED's conclusion, a most improbable happenstance brings together the major characters of all three films. The trilogy's lesson appears to be that life is a series of coincidences, and the potential for personal growth from any connection between one or more individuals is a mine of great richness if one cares to work it. Humans are reputed to be a social species. However, the set is perhaps best appreciated by a ""people person"", who relishes the interaction of daily encounters whether random or not. I'm not that sort (much to my wife's perpetual disgust), so my regard for the series is somewhat muted.
RED, WHITE and BLUE also make the point that there's commonality in the experiences of varied individuals. In each film, the major character observes an old person struggling to insert an empty bottle into the elevated aperture of a large, curbside container for recyclables. Only in RED does the protagonist (Valentine) give assistance. Perhaps the director had more in mind here, but it only indicated to me that Valentine was the more generous and less self-absorbed of the three, and, on a larger scale, that reaction to a set stimulus is not uniform among individuals.
I recognize the ability of the trilogy to inspire opinionated discussion, which, as long as it doesn't degenerate into name-calling and fisticuffs, is a swell thing, especially over pizza and beer. I liked the series for its visuals - it continually held my interest - but I'm not such a deep thinker as to regard it as the Greatest Cinematic Achievement Ever. Sometimes, I think, symbology can be overwrought to the point of detriment. And, as I'm beginning to sound pretentious, I'll stop here.",1054598400,11,2354,4.977157360406092

Kieslowski excellent use of music in BLUE is nothing short of amazing and is also acts and an unseen character. Plus Juliette Binoche is amazing to watch.  She is extremely convincing as a woman in real grief.  White starring another well known French actress, Julie Delpy and polish actor Zbigniew Zamachowski is more comedic and the actor plots his revenge on his French ex-wife and then there is the magnificent of Red starring Irene Jacob, as a young model who discovers an ex-judge has been listening on the conversation of those around him.

So instead she leaves her palatial house in the country after a night with her husband's old friend Olivier (Benot R&eacute;gent), who has been in love with her for years.

Julie arrives in Paris with nothing but a blue cut-glass lampshade, takes back her maiden name, rents an apartment, and tries to leave her old life behind. Though she says she doesn't want love or friends (because they are ""traps""), she befriends a promiscuous young woman and is pulled back to Olivier when he starts to finish her husband's unfinished work. In turn, Olivier reveals to her the side of her husband she never knew -- the other woman he loved.

""Blanc"" is more of a comedy than a tragedy, but there is an element of sadness as well. Hairdresser Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) is being coldly divorced by his beautiful wife Dominique (Julie Delpy) because she is sexually dissatisfied with him. She also strips him of his money and possessions, leaving him playing pitiful music at the subways. What's more, she rubs it in his face that she's now having sex with other men.

Things can't get worse, right? Wrong: Karol goes back to Poland and ends up getting beaten up and robbed. Via some not-so-legal methods, Karol builds himself an impressive fortune and becomes determined to get back at his cold, manipulative ex-wife. Amid a web of killing, seduction and faked death, Karol finds the perfect method to bring Dominique down...

And ""Rouge"" is the color of love. On her way home from a modelling session, Valentine (Irene Jacob) accidently runs over and injures a pregnant dog. The owner is Joseph Kern, (Jean-Louis Trintignant) an embittered, cynical ex-judge whose years of condemnation and acquittal have left him spiritually adrift. He now spends his time alone in his house, wiretapping the phones of his neighbors and predicting what will happen in their lives.

After Valentine expresses disgust at Joseph's activities, he turns himself in to the authorities. Their friendship grows into a bond of differing values and unhappy histories. As Valentine prepares to leave for England, the judge reveals the tragic circumstances of his early life -- a tragedy mirrored by some of the people he has been spying on.

The three colours of the French flag symbolize liberty, equality and fraternity -- and these are echoed in the stories of Kieslowski's films. And each of the three movies has its own ""feel"" -- ""Blue"" is cool and sensual, ""White"" was sharp and sexy, and ""Red"" has a sweetness and richness that is truly moving.

And while most directors are just boring when they do slow, arty direction, Kieslowski infused his direction with sensual beauty and endless light and colour, like a painting come to life. And he intertwined many symbolic images and lingering threads from one movie to the next, whether it's an old lady recycling bottles or a rather surprising finale for ""Red"" that brings all three movies' protagonists together.

And he saturated the movies with the colour of their title -- blue is sadness, depth and beauty; white is beautiful and pure, stark and blinding; red is passion and warmth. While this may not have been Kieslowski's intention, the constant presence of these colors (a bridal gown, a swimming pool, and so on) add an extra dimension to the emotions in the story, especially the first.

Juliette Binoche is an extremely good actress, and this movie uses her expressiveness as most movies don't. Zamachowski brings an element of humanity and poignancy to what could have been an idiotic character, and I never felt anything but understanding for this guy. And Irene Jacob brings a sweetness and innocence to her role as Valentine (aptly named, considering the title of the movie she stars in) that is rarely seen in modern movies.

Kieslowski was an unusual and extremely talented moviemaker, and his ""Three Colors"" trilogy -- ""Bleu,"" ""Blanc"" and ""Rouge"" -- is an exceptional piece of work. We shall not see his like again.",1050192000,16,4763,4.917808219178082
1824128,5,B000083C5F,"There is no reason you should be debating to buy this set if you found your way here.  I actually had not seen the trilogy until I purchased this.  The triology tries to take a story on each of the 3 colors of france, and in my opinion, Kieslowski sure was successful!
Blue, the first film, tells the story of a woman who loses her husband and tries to isolate herself from society.  Blue was a ""wowing"" film if I ever saw one.  After the first viewing it immediately went to my top 10 list.  Juliette Binoche's is one of the best I've EVER seen...it made me hurt.  The only better performance I've seen is in Dreyer's the Passion of Joan of Arc. This was such a deeply moving movie and I view it as the best of the trilogy.
The second film, White, is about a couple who are breaking up, but the man still deeply loves his wife.  With all the hurt she has caused him, he seeks vengeance.  This film is a semi-black comedy and didn't appeal to me all the much, but it was very, very much better than average and I enjoyed it thoroughly
Red, the final film, is about a woman who becomes enthralled by her stalker neighbor.  This is my 2nd favorite film of the trilogy.  The story brought the 3 (basically) unrelated films together to a nice conclusion.
These are 3 wonderful films, with excellent transfers and some nifty features.  Kieslowski has really done a fine job of analyzing and examinating humans and our ways.  These films sum up what life is about.  It's hard for words to describe the genius of these films.  I would buy the trilogy again if it cost 3x what it goes for on amazon.

1824129,5,B000083C5F,"Kieslowski captured my imagination-he inspired me. From the beautiful film Blue through the redemptive Red, these films are a Picasso. While we may argue over the meanings of each particular subplot, we all agree that these  films capture something both simple yet elusive about man. In Red The strange relationship between the retired judge and the model shows the strange pull that certain individuals have over each other. Free will and  luck are themes that I took home from my viewing of the Three Colors Trilogy. If you wish to see movies at their absolute finest, watch these jewels and the Double Life of Veronique and anything else by Kieslowski that you can get your hands on.

1824132,5,B000083C5F,"Thes movies are based on the three colors of the french flag and center around france, but journey all over Europe.
Blue is my favorite film, it is a tale of loss and over coming loss.  Juliet Binenois(SP) plays a character who after losing her husband and daughter tries to give up on living, not suicide but isolation from her past.  The music and the use of the color blue are magical.  As Julie tries to isolate her self she still can't avoid human contact,  and in the end she can not escape who and what she is.  This a movie of realizing that life must continue after loss and that is a sin against ones self to denign what is great inside ones self.
White is a tale of revenge agaist an man who loves his wife and who was loved by his wife until his impotence destroys the marriage.  The man knows that if he can have his wife leave france and go to his native poland than impotence will turn to ... lust and love.  This is about how every man wants and how in desperation will do anything to love the one woman he desires most among others.  This is the most comic of the trilogy and the vengence theme which I will not give away is comic as the need for vengeance and love often is.
The third tale is about the longing for life at any age and how we all find our true love when we don't expect it.  The main character a young woman share two sides of simlar past 50 years appart.

1824134,5,B000083C5F,"The late great Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski cleverly ""adapted"" the three French ideals -- liberty, equality, fraternity -- into three thought-provoking modern-day dramas about people who cope with personal  losses and tragedies.  In BLUE, the first of the trilogy, a widow tries to set herself free (and gain liberty) from her emotional baggages.  The second film, WHITE, is about a jilted man's outrageous plot to get even (thus, equality) with his ex-wife.  The last film, RED, which is also Kieslowski's final film before he died in 1996, is about a lonely old man who is embittered by the memories of his youth and finds accidental companionship (fraternity) with a young model.  All three films are understated in their tone, economical in their dialogs, elliptical in their editing and plotting (there are some mind-boggling flashbacks and flash forwards in WHITE), and haunting in their atmosphere.
The references to the three French ideals are actually quite tenuous, and in fact more and more so as the trilogy progresses.  BLUE is the only one that deals with the ideal of ""freedom"" (albeit emotional freedom) in a concrete way, inviting us to ponder its meanings and its attainability.  WHITE treats the concept of ""equality"" in a rather subversive and satiric way, and it clearly wants us to rethink its meanings rather than accepting it at face value.  And RED has to do with ""fraternity"" only circumstantially, and has more to do with the issue of destiny, and how our past is linked to our present.  The three films are set not just in France, but also in Poland and Switzerland, and WHITE has primarily Polish dialogs.  Hence, a sort of universality is intended.
The three films are also linked in various ways.  All three films involve an unfaithful lover who dies, in one way or another.  All three films involve a chance encounter between the distressed protagonist and a sympathetic observer -- the widow and the mistress in BLUE, Karol and Mikolaj in WHITE, the retired judge and the model in RED.  Both BLUE and WHITE are about people who move to new surroundings to escape from his or her troubled pasts.  And RED, ironically, is about someone who never leaves his home in order to wallow in his self-pity.
Kieslowski had done this sort of thing before.  In 1988, he ""adapted"" the Ten Commandments into ten one-hour, modern-day dramas, collectively titled DECALOGUE, that make us rethink the meanings of the commandments.  In the segment for ""Thou Shalt Not Steal,"" for instance, we witness the kidnapping (the theft) of a child from her adopted parents by her natural mother, who thinks she has a right to her custody.  Thus, it turns clear-cut moral ideals into real-world dramas that have no clear-cut solutions or judgments.
Miramax released long-awaited Region-1 DVDs for the Three Colors trilogy, and they all have superb video transfers and rewarding extra material.  Kieslowski expert Annette Insdorf provides excellent running commentaries for all three films.  She analyzes the visual, aural, and editorial techniques, the thematic significance, as well as how the final films deviate from their original screenplays.  She points out that Kieslowski films often deal with abstract concepts, such as fate, death, and grief, in very concrete ways.  She makes an observant remark about the apparent twist of fate in the opening of BLUE: if the hitchhiker were picked up by the family, the ensuing tragedy might not occur.  She points out that the dream-like wedding scene in WHITE, which many assume is a flashback, could also be a flash forward (a very interesting, and plausible, notion).  She offers her interpretations to the many symbolisms in the films, such as the frequent fades to black in BLUE, the recurring shot of a stooped old person at a garbage bin, the significance of the concerto music in BLUE, the tango theme in WHITE, and the bolero score in RED.  She also explains the intentionally cryptic endings of WHITE and RED.
Each disc comes with several featurettes that comprise about 100 minutes of interviews and commentaries by the cast and crew, Insdorf, film critic Geoff Andrew, and film director Agnieszka Holland.  The BLUE and WHITE discs also contain some early short films by Kieslowski: CONCERT OF WISHES, THE TROLLEY, THE FACE, THE OFFICE.  All three discs contain a fascinating segment called ""Kieslowski's Cinema Lesson,"" in which the director explains his intentions in one particular scene.  The WHITE and RED discs contain behind-the-scenes footage of Kieslowski giving directions on the set.  For Kieslowski fans, perhaps the most poignant clip in these supplements is that of Kieslowski announcing his retirement at the '94 Cannes festival, included on the RED disc.",1047772800,138,4740,5.081290322580645

It is necessary to watch these films over and over again to understand the painstaking efforts that went into creating such beautiful images, images that express in a moment what entire features cannot hope to equal.  I can't even look at the box without being moved from memories of each film.
Great admiration should be evoked from the very first shots of ""Blue"".  That is it should be apparent on the first viewing the love and respect Kieslowski has for his chosen medium.  I believe it is through his earlier documentary work that he achieves this respect.  This love resonates in the instants that make up the films, through the emotions of the often fragile, though resilient characters that fill the trilogy.
I should point out that Kieslowski is my favorite director, I own many of his films including several versions of the ""Three Colors"", though I do not believe it is through bias that I write, rather through intense study and appreciation.
These films, as a trilogy represent the pinnacle of great film making, and separately they retain the qualities of great films. I do believe, however, to get the full experience it is necessary to watch these films as a trilogy, in order: ""Blue"", ""White"", ""Red"", and perhaps a supplemental screening of ""The Double Life of Veronique"" will fit nicely, for the more inspired viewer.  For the fiercely determined viewer I urge you to get your hands on as many of his films (and soundtracks, core to the experience of his films especially ""Blue"" and ""Red"") as you can, starting with ""The Decologue"" and going from there, but then again, if you're like me, you probably have already done so.",1046390400,9,1739,4.838383838383838

7978620,5,B000083C5F,"Krzysztof Kielowskis magnificent Three Colours Trilogy is one of the outstanding achievements in cinema and deserves to take its place alongside his equally amazing series of TV films based on the Ten Commandments entitled Dekalog. Dekalog came out in 1988 and Three Colours Red in 1994. That means the director made 14 films (16 if we include the Dekalog spin-offs A Short Film About Killing and A Short Film About Love) in 6 years, an extraordinary outburst of high quality artistic creativity unparalleled anywhere else. Not surprisingly perhaps considering Kielowskis hectic suicidal working habits (at one point he was editing Blue, shooting White and writing Red at the same time!), within two years the great man was dead.

Actually, the Trilogy is not so much to be set beside Dekalog as to be set after it, as a continuation of that projects ethical inquiry. Kielowskis films changed dramatically when he started to work with Krzysztof Piesiewicz on No End in 1984. Suddenly the tone became metaphysical with a stress on the inner lives of the protagonists concerned and an insistence on asking those fundamental questions about human existence - What is the true meaning of life? Why get up in the morning? What, in essence, is right and what is wrong? What is a lie and what is truth? What is honesty and what is dishonesty? And what should ones attitude to life be? (Kielowski). It was Piesiewicz who suggested Kielowski do Dekalog and it was he who also suggested making three films based on the tricolour of the French flag, each colour representing an ideal of the French Revolution  blue for liberty, white for equality and red for fraternity. Piesiewiczs idea was to make a film where the commanding dictums of Dekalog are understood in a wider context (Kielowski). The director tells Danusia Stok (in the highly recommended book Kielowski on Kielowski [Faber]), Why not try to see how the Ten Commandments function today, what our attitude to them is and how the three words liberty, equality and fraternity function today?  on a very human, intimate and personal plane and not a philosophical let alone a political or social oneThe West has implemented these three concepts on a political or social plane, but its an entirely different matter on the personal plane. And thats why we thought of these films.

All three films of the Trilogy undeniably follow through this examination on the personal plane in three gripping and superbly executed human dramas, but politics and society do form the back-drop to everything we see. Most obviously the Trilogy is a response to (and an expression of) the unification of Europe following the collapse of Communism in 1989. Blue is set in Western Europe, White is set mainly in Eastern Europe, and Red is set in politically (and historically) neutral Switzerland, the home of international law which legislates for a whole continent. Taken together the films constitute a fundamentally positive celebration of the unification of Europe with all the key protagonists negotiating a way out of their various personal impasses to face up to a bright and positive future. This really was as Europe stood at the end of the 20th century before the darkness set in with 9/11.

It might seem portentous (as well as an example of cynical commercial expediency) to make a trilogy of films based on abstract ideals connected with a countrys flag (the very country that provides the finance), but theres no denying the fact that the French Revolution was a defining event in European history which saw the birth of modern society as we know it, and the concepts of liberty, equality and fraternity have endured down the years as very potent ideals which we all live with whether we consciously realize it or not. Kielowski and Piesiewicz couldn't have picked a better symbol really for describing Europe at this critical juncture after the collapse of Communism and it is very interesting how they have approached an understanding of the ideals in each film. They do so by exploring them as contradictions. Blue (liberty) presents the impossibility of any one person ever being absolutely free as the heroine Julie (Juliette Binoche) makes a bid for absolute freedom by cutting everybody and everything off following the loss of her husband and daughter in a car crash, but is reigned back by fear, past memories, other people who won't leave her alone and by jealousy. White (equality) posits the truism that actually nobody wants to be equal. They simply want to be more equal. Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) approaches self-redemption by seeking equality with his wife Dominique (Julie Delpy) to find he succeeds only at being more equal. Red (fraternity) is concerned centrally with the impossibility of any one person being self-less. We only help and get along with others in order to help and get along with ourselves. The model Valentine (Irne Jacob) helps a sick dog and drags its misanthropic owner back to humanity in order to make up for the desire to help her drug addict brother and establish a father figure she does not have. At the same time this misanthropic owner  the omniscient retired judge Joseph Kern (Jean Louis Trintignant)  plays [the Old Testament] God to the people living around him. He helps others as a means of helping Himself.

Following the pattern of Dekalog Kielowski chose a different lighting cameraman for each of his films. Sawomir Idziak (who had shot Dekalog 5 and The Double Life of Vronique) shot Blue, Edward Kosiski (Dekalog 2) shot White, and Piotr Sobociski (Dekalog 3 and 9) shot Red. Each cinematographer was instructed to feature their respective colour strongly in their work to emphasize the focus on each respective ideal. This is done not so much through the use of filters, but more by the placement of objects and use of locations with the requisite colour prominently displayed. Apart from giving each film a unique feeling, what is interesting is the way red, white and blue are combined throughout all three films.

Blue is very blue, but there is barely a shot which doesnt also feature white and red as well. In a swimming pool scene which starts completely blue a group of kids run in dressed in white swimsuits with red floats on their arms. Of course Blue is set wholly in France, the land of liberty, equality and fraternity and in the story we see all three ideals and their colours mixing together. We are encouraged to speculate on the way each one is integrated into the central story. True, Julie seeks for absolute liberty in her neurasthenic behavior, but equality is also suggested by her extremely generous charity and her refusal to put herself either above or below any of the people around her. Fraternity is suggested by a world which stubbornly clings on to her despite all her attempts to cut herself away. She wants to be like a sky diver plunging through life unattached to anything, but the film shows images which highlight the restraints binding her to humanity more and more  the strings holding her blue mobile ornament from the ceiling, the rope holding the bungee jumpers we see on TV, and the lines of music notation which tie her to her past and cry out to be completed. The score (a Concerto for the Unification of Europe) left by her dead composer-husband comes together as a harmony of different chords, which echoes the harmony of the various people she meets who drag her back to the fraternity of the human race. The films concluding montage is on one level a statement of all three ideals (fraternity above the other two perhaps) as we hear a Europe unite through love which translates in the context of the film as the surrender of liberty.

White is very white with both blue and red relegated to minor but fascinating roles. Indeed, to highlight the whiteness (Karols obsession with seeking equality with Dominique) black is accentuated both visually and in the script which works as a dead pan black comedy. Karol begins the film crushed, impotent, penniless and dispossessed on the streets of Paris. In this opening 20 minute section the colour scheme is much the same as Blue with all three colours appearing at the same time. Karols loss of liberty is expressed by the loss of his credit card (coloured blue of course). When he and Dominique meet in court both are wearing burgundy red sweaters (they are not divorced yet) and this is echoed later in Poland when the nouveaux riche Karol drives a burgundy red Volvo to express another kind of fraternity with his company and his workers. He reaches absolute rock bottom after he is released from the suitcase in which he has been smuggled back to Poland, only the case has been stolen and he gets beaten up by thieves on a snow-bound rubbish dump which represents his homeland (Jesus, home at last, he says). The severe black and white composition (the sky is always white in this film) highlights the inequality which he sets about righting in the films middle act. He does so through a combination of self help and the fraternal help of others. His friend Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos) agrees to take him back to Poland and then later provides him with money to start a business. This is subtly expressed through coloured scarves. When Mikolaj offers to help the destitute Karol he is wearing a red scarf (he is offering fraternity), but when he meets Karol later to gain his liberty, his scarf is blue. Also offering fraternity is Karols brother Jurek (Jerzy Stuhr) who initially takes him in after his suitcase ordeal. The neon sign above his barber shop is noticeably both red and white (the fraternity of brothers who are now equal), but the films dominant black and white highlights Kieslowskis concern with the get rich quick materialism that swept Poland in the aftermath of the end of Communism, everyone wanting to be more equal than everyone else. The colour white literally blinds us on three occasions  twice on a repetition of a flashback (which could also be a flash-forward) to Karols wedding to Dominique where they are equal before the Lord and once when Karol finally succeeds in bringing Dominique to orgasm. But this equality is both brief and illusory, the ideal proving to be as impossible to achieve as liberty was in Blue.

Red is of course very red and white also plays a prominent part, but blue is entirely omitted, the idea being there is no liberty for these characters trapped into repeating the same narrative cycles over and over again. Here we return to the world of Irne Jacob as encapsulated in The Double Life of Vronique with a highlighting of binary relationships and the doubling of characters, props and events under the auspices of one over-riding creative artist/Godlike doppelgnger figure in retired Judge Joseph Kern. He sees himself in the character of young recently qualified Judge Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit) and the lost love of his life (the reason for his misanthropy) first in the character of weather forecaster Karin (Frdrique Feder) and then in Valentine, his ideal partner born 40 years too late. The way all of these characters interact shows a gradual progression from complete isolation from each other at the beginning to eventual complete fraternal bonding at the end, the films final denouement shown as being determined by our omniscient Judge Joseph who plays God to a universe in which nobody is free (the absence of blue), everyone is equal under His law with white accompanying red throughout. This is seen especially by the huge red poster featuring Valentine modelling chewing gum which when torn down turns out to be white on the reverse side, the red and white Marlboro cigarettes which Auguste smokes and the red and white mise-en-scne of the theatre where Valentines final fashion show is staged (red seats, white ceiling). During the crucial conversation between the Judge and Valentine a storm blows up and blinding white light enters through opened doors and billowing curtains. The Judges disclosure of his past leads to an equality between two kindred spirits born at the wrong time for each other, and yet there is still time for God to engineer a positive outcome for the girl who lives in an apartment above a caf which bears His name. But what of His motivations? Does He do good for altruistic reasons, or does He do good simply to make Himself happy? True, the protagonists of all three films are allowed the possibility at least of a bright positive future, but this is engineered at the expense of many lives which evidently lie outside His concern. This is the discriminating Old Testament God here who gives and takes away for no apparent reason so making for an unequal world. True fraternity turns out to be as illusory as true liberty and true equality.

Retired Judge Joseph Kern is the last in a line of omniscient God-like artistic creator doppelgnger narrators in Kielowskis films. They all represent a higher power controlling everything we see from above. Other narrators were the dead husband in No End, the young man who appears every time a crucial decision has to be made in Dekalog, and the puppeteer who uses/creates the lives of Weronika/Vronique in The Double Life of Vronique. This higher power is wielded by the lawyer-writer Piesiewicz and the director Kielowski, the Gods of the narrative we see. They voice a thicket of ethical dilemmas centered on the enduring question of how we should all best live our lives. In Blue the dilemma is how should Julie lead her life when every reason for living has been removed? She has no husband or child to take care of and is affluent enough not to need to work or indeed to interact at all with anyone anymore. Why get out of bed every morning? Why live at all? Her rich inheritance including music which she may or may not have part-composed raises questions of what is actually hers. Is it ethical to live a dead persons life and to complete a dead persons music? In White the dilemma is how should Karol react to being dispossessed in a foreign land where things are basically unequal, and when he returns to Poland there is a complete lack of ethics in the way people spy, lie and cheat to get rich quick in a bid to out-equal each other. Is it ethical that one wrong perpetrated on Karol in a foreign land be cancelled out with another wrong perpetrated by Karol on Dominique as revenge? Do two wrongs make a right and can the protagonists involved ever be happy let alone equal? In Red ethical questions multiply and rebound on all the characters. Ethically, what is the difference between spying on people legally through the power of the law granted to a magistrate, and a Peeping Tom spying on neighbors illegally? Ethically, how good is an act of kindness if by being kind you are mainly helping yourself (as Valentine does through picking up the dog) or even worse, destroying other peoples lives (as she almost does when she approaches a happy family to tell them they are being spied on)? Ethically, is it right that one man (the Judge representing Switzerland, the home of European law) should rule omnipotent and omniscient over everyone (the whole of Europe), deciding who survives and who dies, who prospers and who fails, who is impotent and who is potent, who loses everything and who gains the world? The questions asked by Judge Kern in Red reverberate strongly over all three films in the Trilogy giving it a unity which on casual examination may seem lacking.

It has been suggested that the Trilogy represents the world as it is seen by narrative art in toto  Blue is anti-tragedy, White is anti-comedy and Red is anti-romance and although the stories of all three only come together right at the end of Red, all three are bound tightly together in a subtle repetition of ideas, motifs, situations, binary repetitions and subliminal connections which rebound throughout. These are films which can be watched a thousand times and still offer up something new, some revelatory nuance which has been missed before. Kielowski and Piesiewicz avoid spelling things out overtly and encourage us to enter their world both intellectually and intuitively  You make films to give people something, to transport them somewhere else, and it doesnt matter if you transport them to a world of intuition or a world of the intellect (Kielowski). How one responds to these films then is very much a personal reaction, one determined by our own life-experiences which Kielowski and Piesiewicz want us to bring to bear on our response.

I will examine each film in greater detail later under each individual title, but here I will address just a few of the themes, ticks and tropes which reoccur and bind the films very tightly together as a Trilogy. All three films begin and end the same way. They open with the visualization of abstract mechanisms which course under our everyday existence  Blue opens with flashing lights whizzing past as seen from beneath a car driving through a tunnel, White opens on a carousel in an airport bearing a suitcase through subterranean tunnels headed for an un-stated destination, and Red opens with a phone call leading to the camera hurtling down telephone lines across Europe, under the sea to be met by an engaged signal on the other end. Immediately all three films force us to question what courses beneath our seemingly benign everyday lives. The films finish on three of our key protagonists in tears looking through glass. To say why they are in tears would be to say too much here, but suffice to say all three scenes confirm the impossibilities of the three ideals the films are centrally about. The glass is part of the intricate mise-en-scne of all three films wherein characters are forever seen doubled through windows, mirrors and other reflective surfaces. All three films feature nervous, sensitive protagonists who have great intuition. Blue and White feature liberty and equality which are individual traits and Julie and Karol both face up to their ethical dilemmas and emerge ready to live another day even if liberty and equality are both shown to be illusory. Red features fraternity which is a group trait, not an individual one and features two protagonists (Valentine and Judge Joseph) who are no less intuitive and also face up to their dilemmas which eventually turn out to be a shared one. All three films feature the legal process very strongly. Each one has a crucial court room scene and in Blue and White, the protagonists of both films briefly appear in the others films as Julie mistakenly enters the courtroom where Karol and Dominiques divorce case is being heard. In addition to courthouse scenes we are also given other lawyers who are charged with carrying out the protagonists lives. Julies lawyer (Pierre Forget) is charged with dispensing her estate while Karols lawyer (Aleksander Bardini, also the lawyer in No End!) is charged with changing his will. Red is most lawyer-bound of all as two of the main protagonists are judges.

All three films show characters negotiating new lives, but retaining objects from their past. In Blue Julie retains a large blue mobile which recurs as an important visual motif throughout. We connect it to her lost daughter, but we could also connect it to her own childhood. In White Karol takes back to Poland a 2 Franc coin and a plaster cast of Marianne which in his imagination becomes Dominique. Both represent the key motivation for his search for equality  to get rich quick and to win back his love. In Red the judge has retained a fountain pen which had been given him by his lost love and which symbolically stops working as he consciously changes his life. This is echoed in Red by Karin giving Josephs doppelgnger Auguste another fountain pen. Also present in all three films is a scene of an old person trying unsuccessfully to put a bottle into a bottle bank, the reaction of our three protagonists demonstrating the respective ideal each one is concerned with. Julie doesnt notice the old woman in the spirit of freedom, Karol laughs cynically at an old men being as low as he is in the spirit of equality, and Valentine happily helps an old woman in the spirit of fraternity. In addition to windows and mirrors, broken glass is a re-occurring feature especially in Blue (the window Julie breaks in her bid to commit suicide and the blue glass she tears from her mobile in a moment of grief) and in Red (a broken beer glass in a bowling alley which suggests a dispute between August and Karin and the judges windows which are broken by stones thrown by his neighbors). Unifying (and perhaps anchoring) the Trilogy are Biblical references (I Corinthians 13 set to music at the end of Blue, Matthew quoted in Red) and Preisners music which moves from a full blown concerto for 13 symphony orchestras and massed choir in Blue (music is a very important structural element of this film in particular) through a deliciously lop-sided tango for the blackly comic shenannigins of White to a hypnotic Bolero for Red. At one point in Red Valentine visits a record shop and amidst the cacophony of different music being listened to by customers we can make out the music from all three films which are ascribed to a certain Van den Budenmajer, the nom de plume used by Preisner ever since Dekalog 9 where we first met the name.

What really puts the central examination of liberty, equality and fraternity on a personal plane (one everyone can relate to) is the way the dilemmas faced by the protagonists stem from sexual infidelity and the problems of sexual compatibility in general. Searching to live up to these ideals is shown to be incompatible with successful love wherein people can be truly happy. Kielowski and Piesiewicz taking their cue from F. W. Murnaus Sunrise (1928) perhaps through Erich Rohmers Moral Tales, this is the biggest theme which sears through the Trilogy gluing all three films seamlessly together. In Blue Julie finds out her husband had been having an affair with Sandrine (yet another lawyer!). In White Karols impotence causes Dominique to desert him for other men. In Red sexual infidelity has turned the judge into a misanthrope with August playing his doppelgnger forced into playing Peeping Tom as he watches another man between Karins legs. Fear of infidelity looms over Valentines relationship with her absent boyfriend who makes annoying accusatory phone calls. This theme is visualized by making the faithful good characters (Julie, Valentine) dark haired and the unfaithful libidinous bad characters (Sandrine and Lucille in Blue, Dominique in White, Karin in Red) all blonds. Kielowski and Piesiewicz must have been bitten by blonds in a previous life as all the libidinous characters throughout Dekalog are also blond. Revealingly, the infidelities depicted in these films have both positive and negative effects. Julies discovery causes painful jealousy, but it wrenches her back to join the real world. She learns to love again by giving up her liberty. Karols humiliation leads to eventual rejuvenation (a surge back to potency) and a corresponding rejection of the pursuit of equality. Augusts cuckolding combined with tensions in Valentines relationship effect the possibility of a start of a new relationship between the two as they meet after the disaster. This consummates the judges life-long desire to unite with his true love through his doppelgnger, but at the expense of hundreds of lives and the rejection of the possibility of true fraternity for all. In the end true love wins through even if it is a prison which makes liberty, equality and fraternity impossibilities and a world where man and woman can only perceive each other at best through a glass darkly. This is movingly conveyed in the image of Julie and Olivier (man and woman) making love through glass to these exact words from Corinthians 13 at the end of Blue and then confirmed in the final but one image of Red as the judge cries through the glass of a broken window.

I want to finish by stressing how open-ended these wonderful films are and how wary we should be to try to interpret things too definitely. Much is mysterious, opaque and difficult to read, especially I would say Red where the metaphysics become particularly labyrinthine with subtle doubling and binary combinations reflecting on many different levels both in the deeply resonant script and in the complex visuals. To take one example, one possibility is that August doesnt actually exist, that he is Josephs alter-ego posited by him to correct a mistake he made in the past. Like the greatest art these films merit the closest attention and will give up different things as one travels through life. Everyone is encouraged to watch and bring their own experiences to the table to understand the incredible richness of what Kielowski has set before us. This is pretty much as good as cinema gets.
