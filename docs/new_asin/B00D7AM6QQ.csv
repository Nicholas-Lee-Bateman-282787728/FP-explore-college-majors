5776756,4,B00D7AM6QQ,"Excellent stories for kids who are just getting into the horror genre.  Each story is absurd enough to be imaginary, yet cautious enough to keep the kids interest.  I would absolutely caution parents to pay attention to which episodes preview with a note that ""this story is not for 7 and under"" .  They mean it.  Watched with my 8 year old who was in my lap by the end!  Creativity and imagination keep my son coming back for more.",1392940800,,432,4.35

own ALL of the R.L. Stine DVDs, and all seven seasons of
ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?

I love a-l-l that stuff. Tickles the little kid in me to get scared without any
of the heavy R-Rated stuff.

Great for the entire family. Including gran'pa... I should know!

5776790,5,B00D7AM6QQ,"This show is a lot of fun.  I am 33 and enjoy watching it with my 6 year old.  It is a bit more mature than Goosebumps, but still acceptable for small children.  The tales have a little more depth, and the kids are usually a little older in it.  I like that there are several actors in this that are now famous.  The stories are the right ""scare level"" for all ages of children.  It's a great series and all the characters are likable and people you can relate to....",1457049600,3,467,4.076923076923077

5776793,5,B00D7AM6QQ,"While I may be 50 years old, I still like scary movies. These are just clean fun. Acting is well done and it keeps me wanting more (seasons that is). It is refreshing to watch something that is G rated in contrast to PG or R and all the foul language. Thanks R.L. Stine.",1443744000,3,270,4.018518518518518

5776796,5,B00D7AM6QQ,"even though i am a goosebumper for life i have to say when i first say the haunting hour, i was beyond shocked. the haunting hour was made by r l stine the same dude who made the goosebumps stuff. unlike the 90's goosebumps show which had bad acting and a low budget, this series has better actors, spookier storylines and better cgi, well only the first season. season 2-4 just suck but season 1 of the haunting hour is the best. after the first season of the haunting hour i went back to being a goosebumper for life. ok now to the dvd  this dvd this dvd comes with 4 eps. don't let the jonas brother on the cover fool u, its a good dvd. scary mary is a very good and creep ep that last a hour. its similar to bloody mary, scary mary makes young girls do what she want then she pulls u through a mirror and wait for a boy to come looking for u. she steals ur face and tricks the boy into loving her. swarmin norman is just a very cool ep. and freaky knowing that all these bugs r trying to kill folks. flight is just spooky. a ghost is on a plane but doesnt know he is a ghost. this boy is the only one who can see him other than the figure of death herself who is on the plane too. once the ghost realizes its a ghost the plane starts to spark causing it to crash. last there is pumpkin head. ugh. not the best ep and it is really bad. its bad cuz one there is a jonas brother in it who cant act, once the story starts to get creepy, it just ends with a cliffhanger.  it just leaves u feeling flat.",1414886400,,1501,3.918032786885246
5776797,5,B00D7AM6QQ,Amazing show based on the books by r.l. stine. I LOVE all the episode but they haven't come out with volume 7 yet. I REALLY want to own them all so please get those out soon. Amazing stories in this volume (like in every volume) and well worth you money. Enjoy!,1414800000,,261,4.137254901960785

8590311,5,B00D7AM6QQ,Ordered the entire series. Couldn't wait to watch Pumpkin Head. I watched Goodebumps as a young adult and Are you afraid of the dark.  I love R.L. Stein. This series is actually very creepy. Definitely better then any of  the other shows as far as fear factor is concerned. Highly recommend these to any horror fan! I don't have children of my own but probably wouldn't want a child 10 or younger watching these alone. They can get intense and the main character meets an ill fated end more often then not. Pumpkin Head was my favorite episode. These are a true jem. I highly recommend this to kids and adults that are true Sci-fi/Horror fans!,1493769600,,643,4.5344827586206895
