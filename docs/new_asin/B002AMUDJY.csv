3887645,5,B002AMUDJY,"I've never written a review in my life, and at the end of my comments some readers may say they can see why; nonetheless this movie compelled me to share my opinion. A magnificent cinematic portrayal of Winston Churchill's service as Britian's Prime Minister during World War II. Brendan Gleesons performance as Churchill is superb, capturing not only his physical attributes but his careful thought provoking command of vocabulary as well. The casting of Roosevelt and Stalin is remarkable, you would swear you were a fly on the wall at Yalta. Janet McTeer as Clemmie (Mrs. Churchill) is the epitome of a proper British wife, friend and confidante to the Prime Minister. Iain Glen's role as King George VI is as royal as the monarch himself. Historically accurate and brilliantly written. From the Parlimentary debates to the actual war footage and Churchill's relationships with his cabinet, war ministers, family and the King. A great film, entertaining and informative. KBO-HBO!",1246406400,155,982,5.182389937106918
3887656,5,B002AMUDJY,"I'm not a historian, but as a laymen I think the actor who played Churchill is by far one of the most believable. He looks the part, sounds the part, more so than other actors who have played this role (including The Crown). What a great exerpt from his life to watch. Definitly watch this before watching The Crown.",1520380800,,316,4.372881355932203

3887659,2,B002AMUDJY,"Brendan Gleeson's performance really shows what a world class actor can do. Sadly, it is completely ruined by this giant turd of a script.  This documentary is, basically, and literally, Mr. Gleeson reading and acting out Winston Churchill's quotes, one by one, chronologically from the beginning toward the end of the war, with a few other amateur actors running around.

3887664,4,B002AMUDJY,Good attempt at depicting such a remarkable man.  I kept thinking to myself how soon people forget history and let it repeat itself.  Sir Winston was right about the Nazis and he was right about Stalin and socialism.  It's sad that the people didn't listen to him once the war had ended.,1516579200,,287,4.480769230769231

3887676,5,B002AMUDJY,"This is a riveting film that follows closely the breathtaking uncertainty and torturous decisions that needed to be made at a moment when the future of  civilization hung by a thread. The filmmakers took pains to stay true to history; much of the dialogue is taken from Churchills own spoken or written words. While the performances are fine, my wish is that Albert Finney and Vanessa Redgrave had played Churchill and Clementine, as they did in this films predecessor, The Gathering Storm.

A must-see for anyone who wants to understand the magnitude of what was at stake in WWII, and to appreciate what the world owes to Churchill.",1515715200,,633,4.851851851851852

3887698,1,B002AMUDJY,"The story of WWII is absurdly told as a series of flashbacks as Churchill is waiting for the votes in the 1945 election to be collected (from those stationed overseas) and counted.  Thus this is the story of Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister who was turned out of office after leading his country to the brink of victory in WWII.  We are presented with Churchill, the quirky and flawed leader whom the British people didn't trust to lead them in peace.  There is, of course, no mention of the fact that the voters returned Churchill to power five years later (at age 76), after the economy performed so poorly under Attlee that war time rationing was still in place despite the Marshall Plan.  Nor any mention of the Nobel Prize in literature awarded for his history of WWII.

With so much important historical ground to cover, this documentary has no business wasting time trying to portray Churchill as a defeated man.  The great man had many flaws and strengths and he was at the center of many controversies.  The biggest controversies were over when and where to invade Europe.  Did the diversions to North Africa and Italy prolong the war at the USSR's great expense or was the attack on Normandy carried out at the earliest practical date?  The movie shows Parliament's anger after the fall of Singapore, but skips over the even more embarrassing surrender a year later at Tobruk.  Two years of major defeats, only three members of Parliament voted no confidence in Churchill's government.  Like Hilter, Churchill often interfered in military affairs large and small.  Unlike Hitler, he needed to persuade his cabinet and military leaders that he was right.  He was an extremely forceful and opinionated leader, who never forgot that he was merely first minister in the King's government.

The movie shows Churchill's heart attack at the White House while practicing for a speech.  Actually, the heart attack came the evening after his extremely successful speech to a joint session of Congress.  Churchill personally wrote all of his major speeches.

The movie does make it clear that Britain would most likely have negotiated an end to the war (effectively a surrender) in 1940 or 1941 if anyone else had been Prime MInister?  The movie doesn't make it clear why.  The movie suggests that Churchill's irrational stubbornness lead his nation to victory against long odds, but Parliaments don't tolerate flawed leaders for long.",1503100800,5,2439,4.948402948402949

3887700,3,B002AMUDJY,"Good Acting, but a weak story line because it tried to cover so much in a short film. I think a min-series would have added depth to time period film was covering, and made it more enjoy to follow instead of highlights.",1500163200,,219,4.238095238095238

3887702,5,B002AMUDJY,"A magnificent film about a magnificent man who led a courageous people to victory with a steady hand.
It is still astounding to realize that of all the peoples overrun by Hitler during the war, only one people--
the British-- fought back and won, with our help. England was blessed with Churchill and England was
blessed with America by its side. May we always stand shoulder to shoulder with our mother country.",1497657600,2,412,4.736111111111111
3887703,4,B002AMUDJY,It was a good movie but I could not get through the ending. The movie felt too political for my taste at the end. It is possible that history may be open to interpretation.,1496448000,,172,4.088235294117647
3887704,3,B002AMUDJY,"...not as good as the first movie, ""The Gathering Storm."" This one is agonizingly slow, the writing is very dry, the casting is poor in many roles--Janet McTeer as Clemmie Churchill is the exception, she does a great job--and Brendan Gleeson is regrettably not very good.  He has copied Churchill's slump-shouldered posture and the way he held his cigars and yelled at people, but if you've watched the real Churchill on film, you can see some ways in which Gleeson misses the mark. If you haven't watched the earlier movie ""The Gathering Storm,"" do watch--IMO it runs rings around this one in terms of great acting by Albert Finney & Vanessa Redgrave and how watchable the story is.",1496361600,,683,4.788135593220339

3887706,3,B002AMUDJY,"Brandan Gleeson does a superb job of capturing the personal qualities of Winston Churchill, complete with the less than glamorous social qualities but also not missing out on his superlative speech abilities.  It offers a glimpse into the ""personal"" man versus the public figure well known to many history buffs.  This is basically a film of WWII from Winston Churchill's perspective.  The movie seemed to be lacking in many ways....so much greatness in a man who truly lead the UK to victory from an exceptionally dark beginning yet the movie seems to miss quite a bit of it.  There should have been conversations with Eisenhower showing the challenges of his own general Montgomery.  Very little attention was spent on North Africa, Greece, Italy and the Far East.",1492128000,2,766,5.0

3887711,2,B002AMUDJY,"They did not do Mister Churchill the justice he deserved, nor did they delve into the details of the crisis in which Churchill managed adequately.

3887713,4,B002AMUDJY,I liked this show a lot and one reason is that I've read the biography of Churchill by Paul Johnson. This movie has to speed through all the delicacies of life at the peak of the British Empire after all! It has to skip everyone else's lack of highs and lows and focus on Churchill's own most moving and critical moments and in doing that it filled a need for me. It humanized him and exalted him not as a ruling member of that once most powerful nation but as the one man whose efforts resulted in the stopping of Germany from world domination. So if you've read a Churchill biography give this a view; it's got some guts and shows him as a man who had many of the toughest decisions that ever needed to be made.,1487808000,2,713,4.173913043478261

I also realize, (as I age) that my temperament is much like Churchill's, and my devoted Wife, much like the former Prim Minister's dear Wife. I do not wish to be too soppy, but a good women is a strength to any leader, and without such support, life would be a harder and a lonely struggle, with little peace, as it seemed Churchill understood in the end of this film. As near as I can tell, it is exceptionally accurate, and very telling about World War Two, and world events afterwards",1487376000,8,636,4.539130434782609

As the war esculates on the continent, Britain now much ready itself to take control of opposing forces, either marching ahead, or surrender, with Churchill at the helm, there is little choice but to march forward as a strong nation, as others oppose him, he is relentless in his efforts at the helm.  Forceful presentation by Brendan Gleeson, as Churchill, however, I don't think as strong a presentation at with Alfred Finney, in the first episode, there is much to be said about both actors, but, in my opinion, Finney, is a truer likeness to the man himself.  As his career is overwhelming for Clemie, she struggles with conflicting feeling, regarding their relationship, continue to follow their story, and see how she works our her emotions, and ever abiding strength, in spite of so much conflict.  Last, of all is his tireless spirit, begins to loose its favor amount many, has he succeeded, or failed, retiring he finds comfort in support in the most likely of places, the theatre.

That awful year was one of setback after setback.  He made some fearful decisions during the war.  Read his books on World War II.  They are remarkable.  I thought one of the more horrific ideas while preparing for a German invasion of Great Britian was arming the young children with ""sticky bombs.""  The kids could throw a sticky bomb at a tank, run away and have the tank explode.  When the enigma code was broken, he was alerted to the planned bombing of Coventry in England.  Rather than compromise the enigma machine's German radio traffic, he did NOT alert Coventry and that resulted in a horrendous loss of life.  The British continued to read the German radio messages to the end of the war.  There is one scene where Mr. & Mrs. Churchill are at a play after the war when the lead actor called attention to the Churchills in the balcony box exclaiming, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, we have with us tonight the savior of our country.""

Much of the footage is wasted on Churchills losing the vote in 1945. A thoroughly mediocre experience. It is difficult in 90 minutes or 2 hours to portray a great man, and it is rarely done. Spielberg's Lincoln is one of the exceptions: In this movie he captures every salient point in Lincoln's presidency, from his Gettysburg address to his 2nd Inaugural. The film Patton portrays a great Second World War general.  Alex Korda captured Nelson very well. Shakespeare captured Henry V as well as anyone in history.

But, the film highlights the important, and positive, role that his wife and their marriage played in his life and career.,  It captures the sense of duty that drove him on in darker times, where self-doubt lurked in the background..I would not have immediately  thought of Brendan Gleeson for the role of Churchill, but he did an excellent job.",1484697600,,705,4.809917355371901

I think comparing the two actors' performances is a waste of time.  If you preferred one actor over the other before you saw these movies then nothing in them will change your mind.

At first I wanted Albert Finney back (he portrayed Winston in the the first part of this series, The Gathering Storm) as Winston because I felt he really had the look of the great man but Brendan Gleeson was surprisingly good playing Churchill.
I also thought that his wife was very accurately portrayed by Janet McTeer, in fact, in my opinion, she outdid Vanessa Redgrave's portrayal of Clemmie in The Gathering Storm. Janet McTeer played a Clemmie who really seemed to love the man he was and admire his eccentricities where Vanessa seemed angry all the time and terribly frustrated with his odd ways. I, even if not true, like to think she could see the inner genius and overlooked the rest.

Trying to line up my main objections, the first is that it attempts way too much material. Presumably the main point of the story is that Churchill lost the general election in 1945. That is really a very worthwhile objective but one that the film does poorly. Instead we are exposed to random events from the War which seem unconnected and crammed into the time available; we all know about them. The character of Churchill is lifeless and poorly portrayed; I had no sense of his real warmth. Its not a film that I would ever want to sit through again.",1476835200,,722,4.6484375

Brendon Gleeson does a very good job portraying Churchill, and the movie does a good job of presenting a realistic view of Churchill, his strengths and weaknesses, his ability to bring the UK through WWII and lack of full support from Roosevelt.

The casting of his wife was also a bit over the top; projecting a hard edged image.  And to have her with either a scowl or a look of incredulity on her face most of the time was really far too much tilt in that direction.  Surely she could not have been THAT non-understanding of his burdens.  Franklin Roosevelt, though playing only a small part, was similarly ill-cast and unconvincing.  Still, it covers important historical subject matter with reasonable accuracy and is no worse than an average TV movie.

3888126,5,B002AMUDJY,"Winston Churchill's 6-part series on the history of the Second World War, on which the film is based, is an excellent read and gives additional insight into the pivotal events and key people of the time.  The film follows the book closely, providing the viewer with some 'feel' for the mood and politics of the era; most notably, pacifism and isolationism.  The majority of Americans do not realize WWII began in September 1939, not December 1941.  The British had been fighting the Nazis for more than two years when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, drawing America into the global conflict.  What is not entirely clear in the film are the events that preceded the outbreak of war; events that, had the British and French been more resolute in dealing with Nazi Germany's transgressions against the Treaty of Versailles and her European neighbors, Hitler would have backed down and, in all likelihood, WWII could have been avoided or, at the very least, delayed for perhaps a decade or more.  The lesson learned, as Churchill well understood, is that appeasement invariably leads to aggression... until subjugation or war is inevitable.  ""Into The Storm"" is best watched after viewing or reading ""The Gathering Storm,"" the first of Churchill's books on the history of the Second World war.",1471305600,2,1293,5.018691588785047

3888130,2,B002AMUDJY,This film was disappointing in several respects.  The narrative lacks any particular insights into a well known story and the acting has a pro forma quality to it.

This story really was about his relationship with his wife, Clementine, but the story tried to focus too much on the complex events that were occurring with WWII.  I don't believe that the issues were resolved or not given enough context and development to prove if his frustration was not really having a war to manage, after WWII ended, or if he really didn't love or understand his wife.

As much as he was loved by the British people, he was hated by ""colonials,"" and with good reason. Yet, he did indeed save Britain from a fate worse than death, not single-handedly, but with inspiring insight and courage and devotion to democratic ideals, in the face of impossible odds. Having been raised in post-war Britain, I am well aware of how much and how justifiably he was loved and cherished by almost everyone in Britain, whatever their political views. Yet, as shown eloquently in this film, he was defeated in a post-war election that paralleled the disgust with the status quo that we are experiencing again today. He was an outstanding democratic leader, and Britain, and the U.S. for that matter, could use someone with his abilities now.",1468627200,8,965,4.715976331360947

3888421,2,B002AMUDJY,"Into the Storm is a made-for-TV movie from HBO that tells the story of Winston Churchills years as Britains Prime Minister during World War II. It is a sequel to HBOs earlier The Gathering Storm. Released in 2009, seven years after its predecessor, Into the Storm has a different cast and director and very few of the fine qualities that made The Gathering Storm so good.

Into the Storms cast includes Brendan Gleeson as Winston Churchill and Janet McTeer as his wife Clementine. Other notable members of the cast include Iain Glen, Adrian Scarborough, Clive Mantle, and James DArcy.  The film was written by Hugh Whitemore (who also wrote The Gathering Storm) and directed by Thaddeus OSullivan.

Problems abound almost from the very beginning of Into the Storm. For some reason, OSullivan and Whitemore opted to begin their tale of Churchills premiership in July 1945, after the war in Europe had been won and at a moment when a national election loomed in Britain. From this singularly undramatic moment, the story flashes back to 1940, when Churchill was first asked by King George VI to form a new government. And it goes on from there

Into the Storm actually could have been a very good film, but its writer and director persisted in abruptly jumping times and places from scene to scene. (One perfect example of this has Churchill suffering a minor heart attack in the White House in one scene, followed immediately by a scene with him sitting in a hotel room in France awaiting a phone call.)  This made Into the Storm very hard for me to follow.

Add to that is the abysmal on-screen chemistry among the actors, especially Brendan Gleeson and Janet McTeer. These are two very fine actors that just didn't seem to click with each other in the scenes in which they appeared.

As far as the historical accuracy of Into the Storm is concerned, I have no complaints. Of course, here is a case where the five years of Churchills wartime premiership is condensed into a 95-minute movie, so there are obvious and necessary compromises; but OSullivan and Whitemore do present a creditable level of historical accuracy throughout the film.

Into the Storm is a lackluster and uninspiring film that just isn't very entertaining. Recommended only with strong reservations.",1466812800,,2271,4.865284974093265

The immediate concern is the fate of the British Expeditionary Force now trapped with their back to the sea. The evacuation at Dunquerque saved most of them. Churchill formed a unified government with the Labour party and was steadfast in refusing to negotiate with the Germans. He developed a personal relationship with U.S. President Roosevelt but England (as Churchill always referred to the UK) stood alone until the U.S. entered the war. By war's end however, Labour won the election and Churchill was out of office.

This applies at every level of government, Be it local or national. In contrast, We must not elect self-centered buffoons whose only motivation and qualification are money and availability. Every nation must go into the storm from time to time, and real leadership is required.

Not to mention the mangled and carelessly chosen history and helter-skelter back & forth ordering of events.

This movie could have been improved considerably by devoting much more time to Winston's relationship with his pet dog - which is my way of pointing out just how bad it is. I'd give it 1 star out of 10 but they did manage to randomly throw in some fine historical footage that was interesting to see. But seriously if you think you know anything about the Second World War and have not read Churchill's history, I think you will be overwhelmingly amazed at what you do not know.

When all is said and done,  I think that Mr. Gleeson looked more like Churchill.  Also, my jury is still out about mixing past and present.  Several times,  I was not sure which was which.  I have to say that it was the same when comparing Robert Duvall's portrayal of General Lee in ""Gods and Generals"" with Martin Sheen's in ""Gettysburg"".  My reaction was that Duvall  looked the part,  but Sheen had the voice (accent) and mannerisms better.  I dearly loved both, however.  But I digress.  I would hate to have to choose between the two ""Clemmie""s... both were excellent.",1463184000,,674,4.563025210084033

I have no qualms in recommending this film to anyone. Gleeson was magnificent as Churchill. The struggles of the war played heavy on the heart of Churchill and Gleeson's portrayal shows that in his eyes, his face and his brilliant phrasing of some of Churchill's speeches.

Enjoy and be thankful that the world had a man such as Sir Winston Churchill to help lead us through those darkest hours. Horrid times, to be sure, and ones which we should all work hard to prevent from happening again.",1463097600,2,769,4.485714285714286

The film does a great job putting together a good picture of the man and the actor portraying him is outstanding.

3889129,5,B002AMUDJY,"I've now re-watched both The Gathering Storm and this one, Into the Storm in the last 2 days.  They're both splendid.  Disagree with the reviewer who preferred the first movie.  Much as I like Albert Finney (he does American accents better than we Americans), and Vanessa Redgrave, I don't think either of them is any more captivating in their roles  for The Gathering Storm than are Brendan Gleeson and Janet McTeer in Into the Storm.  This movie was my introduction to Brendan Gleeson; I've since discovered him in other roles, and I'm just amazed how much into the character he gets.  Sometimes I didn't even realize it was Brendan I was watching until the credits rolled.  Into the Storm gets some of Winston's most famous speeches.  It also has a stirring musical score going for it, much more so than the composition for The Gathering Storm.  I can hear it in my sleep sometimes.  Both films are brilliant.",1453852800,,912,4.715189873417722
3889130,4,B002AMUDJY,"Insightful and evocative.  Mainly of interest to viewers thoroughly versed in Churchill's life during and after the war.  Many important events were either ignored or glossed over; the program dips in and out of Churchill's war time experiences without truly developing depth and context.
Nevertheless, a welcome addition and an important reminder of Churchill's vitality - and his vital importance to the salvation of the Free World.",1453852800,,434,5.462686567164179
3889131,5,B002AMUDJY,"Outstanding performance by Brendan Gleeson and supporting cast.  Thank God he was prime minister at such a critical time in history.  If Lord Halifax had been named prime minister instead of Churchill, the outcome of the war would have been entirely different.  We would all be speaking German.  The movie should be shown in classrooms across the United States to see a real leader in the most difficult of situations accomplish the impossible.",1453852800,,444,5.041095890410959

Too much to convey in too little time.  I suspect much was left on the editing floor.  For any student of history, worth a couple of very captivating hours. And one comes away with a better understanding of both the nuance, quirkiness, and magnitude of Churchill's persona and role in saving Western Civilization from a horrific ending.  Literally.

We keep retelling and retelling the WWII story frantically trying to find a new angle to tell the same tale.  And, I am growing weary of the tale after decades of these types of attempts. At some point in time we (as a culture) need to move on.  We are not that country anymore-- nor can we continue to define who we are by the valiant efforts of those who went before us more than 70-80 years ago.  The primary audience for these types of dramas are, for the most part, setting at home (or in a care center) recalling a moment of glory that was amazing-- but still one whose relevance is quickly becoming less and less relevant. Just--saying-- can we please move on and find other mythological heroes to examine?",1448496000,,879,4.515723270440252

3889411,1,B002AMUDJY,"Not the most honest portrayal of what this man actually was. I know Winnie is looked at like such a steadfast hero, but the truth of the man is that he was today's stereotypical ""chicken hawk."" Right in line with other ""leaders,"" he was an elitist right to his very end and never even remotely shared in the struggles and sacrifices of Britain's working class during WWII. Declassified documents now show that -- with the help of decoding -- whenever Churchill had advanced knowledge of German bombing runs over England, he alone left London for to stay with a friend out in the country. That's right, he wouldn't tell a soul before leaving town in his private limo.

That said, it is increasingly difficult to understand why films about Churchill keep getting produced in the same manner as ""Into the Storm."" Gleeson's portrayal is terrific, but when the story itself is patently untrue (like Spielberg's ""Lincoln""), it makes you wonder why such fantasy keeps getting churned out?",1441152000,2,981,4.874251497005988

3889469,3,B002AMUDJY,"This HBO drama covers the period between 1940 when Churchill became Prime Minister on the day the war in Europe started and the year following the end of the war when he lost his position to the labor party.  It moves perhaps too quickly from one strategic moment to the other over the course of WWII without much reflection on its effect on the central character.  The premise of the story is that perhaps no other member of Parliament had the grit and determination to lead England during these war years.  He was also exactly the wrong person to lead England in the years following the war when the UK was trying to rebuild itself.  You get the feeling that Churchill always had a clear picture of the survival of a sovereign England but little feeling for the citizens who lived there.  An interesting point brought out in the story, but not very clearly analyzed,  is that the nations at war avoided bombing centers of high civilian concentration during WWI but quickly abandonned this compunction during WWII.  Good performances by Brendan Gleeson as Churchil and Janet  McTeer as his highly intelligent wife,  Clementine.",1439769600,,1128,4.803108808290156

It held my interest and was (mostly) factually correct. There is one blaring (to my ear) flat-out historical inaccuracy, and that was when it was claimed that the firebombing of Dresden killed tens of thousands of civilians working in the weapons manufacturing industry. Although the firebombing of Dresden killed tens of thousands of civilians is completely true, they were not in the business of making bombs. Dresden was a completely neutral city in so far as the war industry was concerned. In fact, the carpet bombing of Dresden is one of the most senseless and destructive incidents in the entirety of WW II. It was not only a great loss to Germany, it stands out as a catastrophe to the world's architectural treasures. Anyway, except for that rather large egg, it was a good movie.

3889657,3,B002AMUDJY,"The acting, crafting and general filmmaking of this is up to HBO standards and well Done. Where this loses out is that it is carried out in a prescribed idological way in which it diminishes, or at least attempts to diminish, one of the most extraordinary men in the history of mankind. If you haen't done your history homework so much is left out that you would think he was just a fat dude who happened to be a Prime Minister. I mean that because it is the same  way another film tried to diminish Margaret Thatcher and yet another PBS documentary suggested Reagan had nothing  to do with the Soviet Union's demise. Sad really, that there are so many filmmakers out their using a subtle tactic to change history. In each case, as with this one, they barely pay attention to the war itself. Sure, the subject matter was Churchill during the war, but the actual war is presented as if  Churchill was some brainless man suffering from memory lapses and just happened to get luck in a historical and situation sense. Maybe they should  have prefaced it with Churchill battling the idea of Hitler being a man that could be dealt with against Chamberlain's refusal to accept the fact that he could not. Kind of like Obama and radical islam..... It is really quite remarkable they were able to get  away with it on Thatcher's economical successes, and now, Churchill giving the people resolve and winning a world war. The D-Day landings and the talk of Churchill not winning the war but instead making political speeches almost totally leaves out the  demonstration of this man's character and why he, along with us in the US were so reluctant. This was the man that constructed the landings at Gallipoli in WWI which was such a big disaster his entire career was pronounced dead. That is something that would make the best leaders reluctant. BUT he was a man of such integrity and character that he didn't run and hide. He went and joined the British Army fought the war with the same groups of men that he had earlier sent to their deaths. You will not find very many men in History with an education and social status that this man had who would do that. Nope, instead they try and give him this sort of ""a man managed"" character which makes him look subtly like a leftwings punchline cartoon character instead. Sad, but that is where our world is now going. Re-write history by diminishing historical figures that you don't agree with, but also can't flat out slander either.",1435881600,,2474,4.598639455782313

3889685,5,B002AMUDJY,"As hagiographic as it is, it must be admitted that Brendan Gleason turns in an absolutely incredible performance here as Winston Churchill.

Until I saw the credits I had no idea that the actor playing Churchill was the same man whom I usually know as a murderous Irish brute in other roles. It's a credit to the talent of HBO's stable of players that, even though there is a vague spark of recognition, I can never quite place where I'd seen them before. (For example- try and see how many Game of Thrones actors you can find in this production).

Yes, the hour and half show jumps around quite a bit and leaves out a lot, but it's not supposed to be the history of WWII. It is the dramatization of the myth that has become a dying nation's necessary lie. In stirring fashion, it excels in depicting a man and a nation at their most heroic, but unfortunately only hints at the Pyrrhic victory that World War II was for Britain.

Yes, a corrupt populace did turn against the nation's hero in his hour of victory and voted to become dependent, socialist slaves. But World War II was far, far more destructive than that. Churchill was a pugnacious, purblind fool who bankrupted his nation, destroyed its hard-won Empire, sapped its strength and consigned it to vassal status in an American Imperium. And for what? To destroy a country that every historian acknowledges had no aggressive intent whatsoever against Great Britain?

Even more than Britain's parochial travails, that horrible war is the direct cause of the impending doom of our entire race. The war was a victory only for an internationalist and materialist elite- of Capitalist, Communist, Socialist or Liberal denominations- that aimed for the regimentation, subjugation and amalgamation of the entire globe. One of the first orders of business was the destruction of the physical existence of the self-aware, advanced, proud and independent peoples of the Western World, which was initiated with nonstop egalitarian propaganda and deliberate open borders policies (the 1965 Immigration Act, in the case of the U.S.). Now, every White nation is being flooded with a tidal wave of Third World invaders, as the deracinated and degenerate peoples of the West cheer their own destruction. Does anyone think that English people would be getting beheaded by Moslems in their own cities if Hitler had won the war? The British people can thank Winston Churchill for ensuring the destruction of our people's last, best hope.

Two minor complaints, one historic and the other aesthetic: 1. the movie accurately depicts the scene where Churchill admits that he would jump at the opportunity to have peace by giving up Malta or Gibraltar. However, it then has Churchill shoot down that idea by saying that the Germans can't be trusted. He did not say that. I guess showing his willingness to negotiate would have killed the myth of the indomitable British bulldog this movie was trying to perpetuate. 2. The actor who portrayed FDR played him as a genial old cripple and not the kind of man who, after meeting him, Carl Jung described as ""perfectly ruthless, a highly versatile mind which you cannot foresee...a most amazing power complex...the stuff of a dictator absolutely.""",1411603200,,3228,4.926470588235294
3889686,5,B002AMUDJY,"Into the Storm is a truly well done story which documents Sir Winston Churchill's powerful struggle to defeat the Nazis and save his country.

Winston Churchill was often crass, often short tempered, but always focused in achieving his goal of defeating NAZI Germany and saving the British Empire.  Mr. Gleeson portrays all of these characteristics that were prevelant in Churchill.  The supporting actors of this film also do an outstanding job of showing what Churchill's family and friends were going thru during the war years.  This film does not dwell on specific years of World War II, but jumps ahead from 1938-1940 the beginning of the war, Dunkirk, and The Battle of Britain, to 1941 when the USA enters the war and you see the beginning of the friendship between Churchill and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, to the Normandy Invasion of 1944, to the triumph of Great Britain when Germany surrenders in 1945.  Between these film eras you see Churchill at the Tehran Conference when he, Roosevelt, and Josef Stalin meet to discuss the Normandy Invasion, to the Yalta Conference in 1945 when you see Churchill with a declining FDR courting Josef Stalin.  Then the post-war years when Churchill was defeated as Prime Minister and the Labor Party was victorious over the Conservative Party.  Winston Churchill was a ""war minister"" who led his country bravely during World War II, after the war thhough he was ""out of touch"" with public opinion and hurt his career in politics when he compared the Labor Party to the Gestapo of Nazi Germany.  This truely hurt his reputation with the British People and his wife warned him not to make that remark during a radio broadcast. But, he did and it cost him in post-war politics.
This is an outstanding movie that is suprebly acted by all, great sets and locations, and an interesting story of the triumph of Sir Winston Churchill portrayed excellently by Brendan Gleeson.  Well worth 5 stars!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1378252800,,2144,4.960893854748603

3889708,5,B002AMUDJY,"I was skeptical of spending almost 15 dollars on this second installment of the series. I shouldn't have had any doubts. I was concerned that I would not enjoy Brendan Gleeson as Winston Churchill nearly as much as I did albert Finney. After several minutes I didn't even notice that the actor have changed.

This movie actually has less Hollywood drama and more actual history than the previous installment. It was fascinating to be inside the War Room at 10 Downing Street. Seeing the decisions made the shape our world as we know it.

It was also commentary on recent ihistory with the vote of socialist power after World War 2.

I cannot recommend highly enough to purchase of this movie especially if you have waited for the sequel to The Gathering Storm.

This would make a fabulous Christmas gift to anyone interested in any sort of World War Two history.

His rhetoric and leadership inspired millions of people to fight against Hitler's war machine. Even so his people turned their back on him after the war was over.

This is the continuation of the HBO special ""The Gathering Storm"". I believe this is the better of the 2. Brendan Gleeson gives one of the most amazing performances of his career. I was completely blown away by this film. This movie shows how Churchill's prowess as a military commander became his political undoing, and threatened his marriage. This is one of the most under appreciated films I've ever seen. If you like history, or just a  good story this film will blow your mind.",1352851200,3,785,4.764705882352941

3889711,5,B002AMUDJY,"A film about the effect Winston Churchill had on his dear England as they hesitatingly went into WW2. Although different characters portrayed the real life players that they did in ""The Gathering Storm"", I found it did not affect the continuity between the two films.
  At first I was slightly confused because the film starts after WW2 when the Churchills were vacationing at an idyllic location on the French western coast. Here the angst is the anticipation of the results of the vote of confidence to keep him on as Prime Minister. As I watched, the delineation of the ""flashbacks"" became more clear due to the more business aspect tone of the film. This illustrated the struggle to keep up the morale of the English people as the necessity of War becomes clear and then the events in the war. After seeing ""All's Quiet on the Western Front"" I can understand why the majority of the British were desperate not to enter another devastating war.
My favorite part is when King George offered the British citation The Order of the Garter. Winston summed it up when he said calmly that he could not accept the Order of the Garter from the King when the British people had given him the boot.",1349740800,,1190,4.6350710900473935

3889713,5,B002AMUDJY,"Into the Storm--Churchill At War-- follows The Gathering Storm.  Churchill struggled to inform the nation that Germany was arming itself for war, but nobody was listening. He was basically put out to pasture. That, it seems, was just the kind of challenge the great Churchill needed. While constantly battling intermittent depression, Churchill fights to become relevant again. His wife, Clementine, stoically supportive has moments where her pain almost wins out over her devotion to her husband, but her courage comes through in the end just as his did. I recommend both The Gathering Storm and Into the Storm for a greater understanding of the history and heroes of that time. I found both to be inspirational.",1334448000,,713,5.146551724137931

I'm not sure if it is because Gleeson has always been one of my more favorite actors, but this film really worked for me. Beautifully played, with a to me quite emotional ending, but also throughout a very strong portrayal of a fierce, intelligent man, with his flaws, and his strength, and his relationship with his wife. Very good.

The film starts in the period just leading up to the war, with Chamberlain getting the sack and the far more useful Churchill taking over in a national government. It ends with his losing the post-war election, the film does not extend into his final years.",1317600000,,673,4.703389830508475

This appears to be a sequel, or more like a continuation, of THE GATHERING STORM, which was  about Churchill in the pre WW2 years. I have to ask myself if I would have given this another star had I seen it without having seen the other one, and I honestly don't know. I felt that there were jumps in time in this one which were too broad, but then again, WW 2 is a big subject, and unless you have several hours in which to portray it, or even one important man's participation in related events, I suppose it may be necessary to omit large blocks of time. Next comes the comparison-in this one, Brendan Gleeson (Churchill), and Janet McTeer had an uphill battle to begin with, if they were to compare favorably against the likes of Albert Finney and Vanessa Redgrave in the earlier production. In my opinion, they did not quite make the cut. One of the major online rating sites also has the first film rated higher, though not by the margin I feel is appropriate. Overall, I would say that WW 2 history buffs, and those with an intense interest in Churchill should make this a must see. For entertainment alone, there are other films, even other WW 2 films, which might represent a better investment of time.",1310860800,24,1340,4.425101214574899
3889719,4,B002AMUDJY,"This video is a very good depiction of a significant period in the life of Winston Churchill. In a sense, it is a sequel to the earlier video The Gathering Storm. Although the quality of acting in the previous work was better, this effort is worthy of viewing by those interested in historical figures, especially the iconic Winston Churchill. For all of his flaws, Churchill was an extremely important figure in the middle of the 20th century. I give this video four stars and the work five. Happy viewing and enjoy a little history on the screen.",1302825600,,548,4.65979381443299

3889721,3,B002AMUDJY,"Having watched and loved the gathering storm, I eagerly awaited the release of Into the storm and well, it was fairly good. The acting is good as is the filming but I didn't find the script quite as captivating as the former movie. The editing seemed a bit of a hotchpotch of flashbacks and jumps forward which work if you know the story off by heart but would leave some one who isn't an avid student of history a bit confused at times. I also thought the sequences were a little contrived in order to squeeze in every famous one-liner delivered by Churchill in one movie. I think as much as anything it needed to be longer to do justice to such an extraordinary period in history. Perhaps this should have been a ten part series rather than a two hour movie, or concentrated on just ONE event such as losing the election or the fall of Singapore rather than trying to cover them all in two hours. Having said that it is a well made entertaining movie that captured some if not all of the events and characters of the time.

Montgomery was a loser and second rate who got very, very lucky at El Alamein in North Africa. That was the ONLY battle that he won throughout WWII!

3889723,3,B002AMUDJY,"This is the second film that HBO have produced on the life of Sir Winston Churchill and Brendon Gleeson does a good job of depicting Churchill.  However, my personal preference was very much Albert Finney, who most certainly took the role of the Prime Minister and made it his own.

Despite the change in actors, HBO has done a good job reporting on the ten days leading up to Churchill's 1945 General Election defeat, however, the Churchill they have depicted in not the Churchill that existed.  Sir Winston Churchill may have, (on rare occasions), used choice words when upset, but swearing as a pastime was not something he was often given to.  Swearing shows a great lack of language command which Churchill never suffered from.

I am only disappointed from the language point of view and feel that although accurate history is very important to report, by including the bad language, the film cannot be widely seen by the younger generation.

Many of the moments when Churchill is depicted as swearing were personal entries and artistic license, as evidenced by the fact that Churchill was alone and there were no witnesses.

In my opinion, the language ultimately draws away from the important and interesting story that tells of those last trying days when Churchill was first Prime Minister.",1274745600,2,1299,4.931192660550459
3889724,2,B002AMUDJY,"Let me begin by saying that Brendan Gleeson's acting is one of the few things that saves what otherwise could have been a disastrous movie. For one thing, the story does a poor job of telling why Churchill was so instrumental to England's survival in WWII. The story is random and bouncing and really does a poor job of showing both Churchill's character and the events he lived in. The first film, ""The Gathering Storm,"" was told much better as it gave a firm view of Churchill and showed who he was and what he was trying to accomplish.

While I do enjoy seeing Brendan Gleeson act, Albert Finney did a much better job of catching Churchill's often difficult and brilliant spirit. The rest of the cast, except of Churchill's wife Clementine were almost wall paper.  The best role which went unexplored was Churchill's first encounter with  Montgomery. That bit was brilliant but went unexplored.

All in all, I found this very dull and a poor sequel to ""The Gathering Storm.""",1273536000,,977,4.695906432748538
3889725,3,B002AMUDJY,"Often a sequel falls short of its prequel. I have watched, and enjoyed, ""The Gathering Storm"" many times. My positive feelings about ""The Gathering Storm"" led me to purchase ""Into The Storm.""

My impression of ""Into The Storm"" is that it was created for those with short attention spans. Instead of a well connected theme, the movie presents many disjoint short interludes. Although it does have a few good moments, they are insufficient to raise the movie to an above average rating. Perhaps the best scene in the movie was the King's subtle method used to dissuade Churchill from going to Normandy with the initial landing forces.

Churchill delivered some great speeches to parliament - his oratory was real rather than the tinny rhetoric one hears from Obama - and the movie would have been improved had it included at least parts of these speeches.

Finally, a word about the casting. I thought Albert Finney in ""The Gathering Storm"" was a more convincing Churchill than Brendan Gleeson in ""Into The Storm.""",1270598400,2,1012,4.906432748538012

3889729,5,B002AMUDJY,"After watching the Gathering Storm we wanted to see what came next in terms of the life of W. Churchill.  We were not disappointed by this HPO production or the Gathering Storm, although I liked the actor who played Churchill in Into the Storm a bit better.  If you are a WWII or Churchill scholar you will most likely not like the portrayal of Churchill as it is mostly focused on the tough decisions he had to make under extradorinary conditions.  Historians like to put their political spin on world leaders.  I like to understand what they were up against and how it impacted them personally. It is so much easier to judge someone or the time they were in, in hindsight and from a safe historical distance.

After watching Foyles War, a 5 year series on British TV, I wanted to learn more about how the war was viewed from Hastings and the cliffs of Dover, what it was really like for the people that lived 21 miles from Hitler's conquests.  Foyles War is excellent as seen through the eyes of a police officer in Hastings.  These two HBO movies fill in the part about what the leaders were facing as they sent their young men to battle.  Both in this movie and in Foly's War they have reenact the fleat of boats, mostly fishermen, that rescued 330,000 men from Dunkurk with many of them loosing their own lives to save the troops.  In these days of constant bikering and selfish greed it is very uplifting to watch what simple people are able to accomplish when inspired by their leaders.",1262390400,,1493,4.479704797047971
3889730,5,B002AMUDJY,"An excellent HBO production on the life of Churchill during the war years following up on their terrific film, THE GATHERING STORM, leading up to the war years. I didn't think Gleeson was quite as outstanding as Albert Finney in GATHERING STORM or McTeer as Redgrave but they both gave excellent performances. There is no question that Churchill, warts and all, is one of the most fascinating men in modern history. In the GATHERING STORM we learn of Churchill's sense of destiny for his life. In this film we see why he may have indeed been destined for 'such a time as this'. The circumstances are overwhelming for Britain. The future of the country and the empire are literally on the line. The film begins with the very early stages of the war in 1940 and quickly flashes forward to 1945 with Churchill and family vacationing in France by the ocean, waiting for the results of the election for prime minister. These flashbacks and flash forwards are both the strength and weakness of the film. They show us the 'before' and 'after' Churchill but often make it a little confusing at first until you understand what's going on. It also helps to have some knowledge about Churchill and WWII as the scenes are usually fairly short and don't give a lot of context. What you do you get is some very interesting insights into the mind of Churchill in the various war situations. For example, when deciding whether to bomb Dresden, his military advisers are concerned about civilian casualties but Churchill shows no concern for civilians and we learn shortly after the decision that 58,000 civilians are killed and 200,000 lose their occupations due to the destruction of war factories. We learn that he has loved military strategy from a young child and people question whether this might just another 'game' for him. His relationship with 'Clemmy' is also a fascinating one. She is a strong person in her own right and without her, it is doubtful Churchill would have fulfilled his 'destiny' in the way he did.

The Man, The Myth and The Legend. This film does a very decent job with trying to show things that are not in the old black and white newsreels from history. Churchill was a great man, but he had his share of faults as well. The same as FDR did. History has declared their greatness, but also does not cover up their weakness either.

It's not a point by point documentry on his life, or his time as PM during WWII.  It seems to try to capture the spirit of the events of 1940 -45.  The British performances are very solid, they needed to do a bit better with FDR and did very well with Stalin.

You should also see ""When Lions Roared "" an NBC miniseries from years ago. All about the Big 3 with excellent performances.

Several men-perhaps hundreds of men can be said to solely responsible for the victory, but none more the Churchill. Of all the great generals;- Marshall, Eisenhower, and leaders FDR, and Truman; etc et al==NONE were greater or more indispensable than Churchill.
What I want to comment on is Brendan Gleeson's absolutely wonderful portrayal of Churchill. like most Americans I would guess, my first exposure to Gleeson was in ""Placid Lake"". I had no idea whatsoever he was such a great actor. Great in the classic sense of some of the great English actors. The ones who get Knighted.

  The Gathering Storm and Into the Storm are the very best of the movies I have seen about this important man, and I am going to make sure that my children and grandchildren have copies of these two great period performances.
  Having lived through that time in history as a child it made a permanent impression upon my mind, and the current generations seem to have no real understanding or interest in the subject. That is a dangerous form of apathy which the American people exhibited during that time until 1942 and the disaster at Pearl Harbor.
