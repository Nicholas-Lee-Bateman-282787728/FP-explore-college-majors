8646041,5,B00IXMF16K,"Yes, this is a 'great bad movie'.  I would put it up there in the hallowed halls on par with Troll 2 and The Room and Razor Sharp.

However, I also unironically love this movie.  This is a low-budget, independent film that, in the first five minutes, has a beat cop entering a portal to hell to battle occultists and demons.  And the demons are practical, stop-motion effects.  Sword fights, evil ninjas, gun fights, awkward love scenes, this movie has it all.

This was clearly a labor of love and it shows.  It's both kind of hilarious and kind of impressive.  Honestly worth every penny.",1516838400,2,590,4.552380952380952
