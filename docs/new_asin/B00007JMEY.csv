1813620,5,B00007JMEY,"This movie seque was great.  So often a sequel misses step from te original, but not this time.  Grandkids who watched this are 2 and 4 and they enjoyed it over and over and over.  Wonderful movie.  I recommend this one.",1060473600,11,220,4.2926829268292686
1813621,4,B00007JMEY,"This is a very good follow-up to the original. It has the charm of the original that should be enjoyed by the younger viewers. However, the drawings are a total departure from the simplicity of the original. That rough and innocent look in some ways demonstrates the delicate power of the original's script that made it so appealing and heartwarming. But there's enough warmth of the heart to go around in this one that most viewers shouldn't be disappointed. I suppose that if you grew up with the original you may still yearn for that beloved simply told tale. But remember that was your day. Now it's theirs.",1051315200,8,611,4.666666666666667
1813622,3,B00007JMEY,"We bought this DVD as an Easter present for our kids.  My wife and I both have very fond memories of the original, and I was curious to see how this one stacked up.  I really didn't think it was a bad movie at all.  It concerns the continuing adventures of Wilbur the pig, Templeton the rat, and the rest of the barnyard critters of the original, including Charlotte's three children that we met at the end.  There's a new baby lamb on the farm, Cardigan, who is ostracized from the other sheep because of his black fur.  Wilbur, a pig who definitely knows the value of friendship, takes the lamb under his wing (so to speak).  When a trip to the good old county fair results in Cardigan being sold to a neighboring farmer, Wilbur's concerns for his friend leads him, Templeton, and Charlotte's daughters on an adventure to find their friend.
The animation of the movie is very well done, much better than most direct-to-video releases, and the background paintings and such were also well done.  In that regard, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The voice-over acting was fairly faithful to the original, although I must admit to missing Paul Lynde as Templeton.  The songs in the movie are OK but nothing particularly outstanding.  I did notice, however, that time has been kind to Wilbur, melting quite a bit of weight off of him and giving him a nice cute patch of fluffy hair on top of his head.  Fern, Wilbur's human friend and savior from the original, also appears to have gotten younger, and her friend Henry Fussy is nowhere in sight.
Basically, this is a cute movie, but it is nowhere near the absolutely stellar quality of the first.  If you are someone, like me, who remembers the original fondly and think this might be a good movie for your kids, don't be afraid to pick it up.  Your kids will enjoy it.  However, if you are thinking that it will be as much of a classic as the original, I am afraid you will be disapponted.  Still, all in all, it is a decent movie on its own.",1051056000,16,1992,4.449035812672176
1813623,5,B00007JMEY,"My girls love the original Charlotte's Web (5&2).  I bought this hoping that they would like it and they LOVE it!  We have watched it several times already.  The new characters are great, the old ones are still there, and Templeton is as funny as ever!  The songs are sung around the house and the games on the dvd are also a hit. I recommend this movie to anybody of any age.",1049328000,,376,4.180555555555555

1813739,1,B00007JMEY,"We got this dvd because my son loved dancing to the preview of it, which was on another dvd we had.

We thought he would love the characters and the story. Turns out there is not much singing on the actual dvd (only that preview he saw)...so, it did not hold his interest. Our son is 1. perhaps this would be better for an older child.",1381363200,,335,4.075757575757576

1813788,5,B00007JMEY,"I loved this movie almost as much as i did the first one! Although some of the sounds and pictures were kind of goofy it was above all a good movie! I thought the fox was really cool! All the new characters are friendly and kind. This film is very innocent and like the first Charlotte's web, a touching moral about loyalty, and friendship. Again, Wilbur the pig, Gwen the goose, Templeton the rat, and Fern partake this extraordinary adventure along with some new characters. Farley the fox, Betsy the cow, and cardigan the lamb. If you ask me, its a heart touching movie you will want to watch again and again with your family!",1319328000,,629,4.478260869565218
1813789,1,B00007JMEY,My five year old daughter begged for this after seeing the original several times.  After about fifteen minutes she turned it off and made me hide it in the basement so she would never have to see it again.,1308614400,,206,4.282051282051282
1813790,5,B00007JMEY,"I bought this movie for my daughter because she loves the original, well she loves this one even more. She loves the lamb in the movie and all the songs and dancing. She asks to watch it over and over again. I think it is a fabulous movie for both young and old! Sure Fern has changed, but throughout the years doesn't everyone change? I think they just created her more grown up, she still loves Wilber and all the barn animals, but she starts to show interest in other things since she is older, basically its just what happens over time as young children grow. I would reccommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the first!",1299974400,,626,4.358974358974359
1813791,3,B00007JMEY,"Charlotte's Web was a great movie. Pinocchio was an old version, a little disapointed about it but is a good movie to teach children to be good.",1267920000,,144,4.37037037037037
1813821,4,B00007JMEY,"The item was shipped very fast.  The packaging wasn't sufficient, as it was sent in a bubble envelope, & I was afraid it was broke when I seen the package when it arrived.  It was ok, but didn't look it from the outside.",1229731200,,220,4.093023255813954
1813822,4,B00007JMEY,"Charlotte's Web 2 takes off from where the original ended - Wilbur, having learned the true value of friendship from the spider, Charlotte, puts the lessons he learnt in Charlotte's Web to good use. He befriends a lonely little lamb, Cardigan, and introduces him to Charlotte's daughters - Nellie, Aranea, and Joy. When Farmer Zuckerman sells Cardigan off, Wilbur and friends [including the rascally Templeton the rat] go off on an exciting adventure to help Cardigan.

Though Charlotte's Web 2 is not comparable to the original Charlotte's Web which is a stand-alone classic, it is still a pretty good animated feature with interesting characters, lots of songs, and most importantly, still manages to impart valuable time-honored lessons on friendship and the courage to follow one's heart and do what's right. Highly recommended for young viewers, especially preschoolers.",1221091200,,875,5.386861313868613

1813825,4,B00007JMEY,I bought it thinking I was buying the original and I was very disappointed. My daughter however loves it. She loves the animals and there is a very cute sheep named Cardigan that I think is the best part of the movie.
