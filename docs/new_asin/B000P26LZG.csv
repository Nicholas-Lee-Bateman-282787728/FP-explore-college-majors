2807311,5,B000P26LZG,"Great Disneyland souviner I once picked up at Main Street's Emporium, though for a much lesser price than here. Video moves briskly focusing on attractions laced together with the non-stop music of Disneyland, and climaxing with Fantasmic show, then into brief Main St. Electric Parade into fireworks finale. It all begins with an empty lot with Disney characters getting ready for a brand new day, and then the Main St. band greets the incoming guests with fanfare. Goofy, Captain Hook, Chip & Dale, B'rer Fox & Bear, Alice In Wonderland, plus Mickey & Minnie join the wonderful magic land salute. Great close ups of Pirates Of The Caribbean, and The Haunted Mansion!",1190937600,8,668,4.973214285714286

DISNEY - Please put this on DVD format!  Don't change a thing.  (Disney could produce a 2 DVD set with this original tour and one with the newer attractions.)",1499385600,,269,4.5625
