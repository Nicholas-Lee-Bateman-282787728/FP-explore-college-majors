8029162,5,B0002M5T1Q,"This production of Tosca, with Franco Corelli as Cavadarosi was the second opera I had ever seen.  But in reality, for me, it will always count as the first...as this opera led to my full on opera obsession.  The greatness of Corelli in this role cannot be overstated.  And the production is perfect; beautiful and atmospheric without being a distraction.

Puccini's Tosca is one of my favorite opera's, and that has much to do with this version.  I have watched at least five other productions, and none have come close for me.  I will admit, the sound and picture quality are not great, and leave much to be desired when compared to more recent Tosca's.  However, the quality of the singing and acting is awesome, a true piece of operatic history!",1345334400,3,749,4.67175572519084
8029163,5,B0002M5T1Q,"I saw this as a teen about 1960.  I became an instant Corelli fan and was lucky enough to see him live in Tosca about 8 years later with the famous, glorious, ""Vittoria"" that seemed to go around the world and back.  Never have I been in an audience so dumbstruck.  That particular performance I was delighted to find on cd and its even better than the famous Parma.
 Back to the dvd.  The quality is tolerable.  Filming in the actual locations is quite exciting.  The worst thing is Caniglia's singing....pretty screechy.  But Duval's acting compensates.  Our Scarpia is far too mellow (I have yet to find one mean enough).  For the era, this was a great effort, far eclipsing other filmed operas of the time.",1247443200,10,709,4.555555555555555
8029164,4,B0002M5T1Q,"As a person who believes that there is Franco Corelli and then there are some opera singers I was thrilled when I found that VAI had come out with this 1956 RAI film.  I have copies of the Bel Canto Society Tosca videos that are magnificent but after all they aren't DVD's.  The first copy of the DVD sent to me from VAI was damaged - seemingly a production flaw.  Their customer service was marvelous - with no questions at all they immediately sent me a replacement that plays perfectly.

The picture is wonderful considering VAI was still dealing with a source from 1956.  The color and clarity are far better than on the VHS copies.  The sound is wonderful but not noticeably better than on VHS but this is probably unavoidable.

Now we get to the reason for a missing star.  The synchronization of sound and picture is far from close.  I don't think this can be blamed on the lip-synching that must have been done as it is not nearly so noticeable on the VHS version.  With that caveat I still have to recommend this DVD.  It gives us one of opera's true treasures on the format we now all want.  The problem is it also makes me want to upgrade my TV set and DVD player. - More, please, VAI.",1095379200,27,1196,4.313901345291479
