7794126,5,0967991153,"I am a grandmother of a teenager with ADHD. I bought this DVD to help my grandson understand more about his ADHD from other teenagers and young adults with ADHD. I watched the DVD before giving it to my grandson and was very surprised of the percentage of students diagnosed with ADHD. I could see my grandson in a lot of the students with ADD.  Alex Zeigler did a fantastic job with the DVD, it was done well and is very informative. I believe anyone that has a teenager/student with ADHD and is struggling with it, needs to see this DVD.",1394236800,2,539,4.336633663366337
