The audio is okay at best, and really bad at times (like the author/instructor was in a windy parking lot while recording, lots of feedback and noise). For a ""beginners"" tutorial, there was also instruction whatsoever. I had no idea what I was doing. At one point, the screen goes black...there's a voice instructing you to do something, but there's nothing on the screen. Also, there were a lot of transitions that I wasn't prepared for because I had just gotten into the last position before being told to go to a new one! This definitely isn't worth $18. I hope this critique was helpful to not only the people interested but also the DeAnna Smothers. I hope she pulls this from the market and does it over in a higher quality version.",1485216000,,791,4.5
8547793,3,B00A7D2OEA,It's okay. The ladies voice is not very soothing. I prefer the Yahweh Yoga instructor at our church.,1471219200,,100,4.611111111111111
8547794,1,B00A7D2OEA,I wanted to love this DVD. I do love the Christian aspects and scripture but it is way to slow.  I will be returning it. tempted to try other DVDs but it cost me five dollars to return.  Update:  the company contacted me and offered me a choice of any of their cds for free.  Wonderful customer service!!!,1453420800,2,305,4.206896551724138
8547795,4,B00A7D2OEA,Excellent Christian yoga video. You will enjoy it. The only reason I rated it 4 stars is the audio could be better. But don't let that stop you from buying it.,1410652800,,159,4.161290322580645
8547796,4,B00A7D2OEA,"I compared the to the 1 hour version, and it is much more ""relaxing"" and slow. There was only one part towards the end that I felt my body ""working."" I prefer to move around a bit more, but if you're looking for a simple, quieter half hour, than this DVD is for you.",1397174400,,266,3.9444444444444446
8547797,5,B00A7D2OEA,"I totally enjoyed this DVD. It is great for body, mind and spirit. The center of my universe is The Lord, not the sun or the trees etc. and this DVD accommodates my needs.",1389139200,,171,4.0588235294117645
8547798,5,B00A7D2OEA,"This is probably one of the best daily yoga DVDs I could find. It starts off in a way that I could relax and get into my zone and then DeAnna takes you through a series of postures that caused a little sweating while still flowing very gracefully. DeAnna has such a wonderful yoga voice as well, very soothing and comforting.",1374019200,9,325,4.344262295081967
8547799,5,B00A7D2OEA,"I prefer a longer practice, but some days I'm lucky to get in a shower so this 1/2 hour version of my favorite class is perfect!  Still has all the components I love, but in a more manageable time frame.  DeAnna-you are brilliant!",1354665600,8,230,4.325581395348837
