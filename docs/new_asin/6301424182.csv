7811448,4,6301424182,"I think we expect films about gay people to be ""sexy"" and L'Homme Blesse is not. One reviewer mentions that in a simulated sex act one actor sucks his own thumb--as if this were incompetent film making rather than being the plot point it is. (The character is faking having sex--he refuses to have real sex with the main character though they are frequently in erotic situations.)

Without being ""sexy"" the film is erotic. But since the desire is unrequited, the ""cute boys in their underpants"" crowd will be disappointed.",1117324800,5,522,4.8
7811449,3,6301424182,"L'homme blesse (The Wounded Man) is a melancholy French film showing the progression from emptiness to hopefulness to despair of a young man seeking to build a new life, but with the wrong boyfriend.
 Henri Borowiecki (played by the best actor in the film, Jean-Hughes Anglade) coexists with his indifferent family in a city.  On a trip to the train station to see his sister off somewhere, he comes into contact with dangerous, sexy Jean Lerman (played by Vittorio Mezzogiorno) in a men's room and makes himself noticed by a rich voyeur, Bosmans (played by Roland Bertin).  Henri finds Jean irresistible and keeps going to the train station to seek him.  After a bit of gamesmanship, Jean takes Henri home, where Jean's girlfriend Elisabeth (played by Lisa Kreuzer) also lives.  Mutual mischief sets in.  Jean sets a trap for Henri, who falls in and tries to recover by recasting the deal and his relationsip with Jean.  Jean hides out.  Cute hustlers tempt Henri.  Voyeur Bosmans persuades Henri for a date, during which Jean shows up.  After Jean stages some hot-looking action, Jean and Henri flee.  Henri wants to get closer, but Jean plays one more bad trick on Henri.  Bosmans arranges a non-standard meeting of Henri and Jean and promises not to peek.  The movie goes to its climax.
The strength of the film is Anglade's ability to show the emotional arc of Henri's needy, desperate, but laconic character.  Henri doesn't feel comfortable opening up to others.  He talks some to Elisabeth and would like to be close to Jean.  Unlike the stereotypical French movie, there is not much theorizing dialogue; Anglade has to use his expressions and body language to convey his meanings, and he does it well.
The other main characters do all right, especially Vittorio Mezzogiorno (Jean).
Henri and Jean provide excellent skin shots and erotic action, Henri going the distance.
There were some unexplained items, for which I invented my own stories.  Since the characters reveal little backstory or talk about what happens when Henri is not present, the audience has to choose how to fill in the gaps.  What was the nature of the Bosmans - Jean relationship?  What motivates Jean's treatment of Henri?  Why does Henri's family say nothing of his going to school or getting a job?  Why does Henri have no friends his own age?  Why won't he go to a men's club?  Why was Bosmans seemingly so generous at the end? I'm not giving my answers.
The picture quality often seems grainy and not sharp, which are extra noticable in the many night or darkened room scenes.  If there were a remastering, it might make a difference.
There are no chapter breaks on the DVD.  The sole DVD extras are the trailers to six other movies.
I would have liked a commentary by Anglade and writer/director Patrice Chereau to fill in the gaps I mentioned above and also discuss the 1983 French take on bisexuality (Jean), gay relationships, public kissing, kids living at home, and the role of ID papers.  If there were a trailer, making-of, behind the scenes, deleted scenes etc., it would be even better.
This is a good movie to watch and then exercise one's imagination on.  Some relationships are better not started.",1074902400,9,3194,4.812844036697248
7811450,5,6301424182,"""L'Homme Blesse"" is a deeply affecting portrait of human loneliness and alienation that transcends its grittily realistic depiction of the French gay underworld of street hustlers and sex in dark corners. Its themes of isolation, unrequited love and the search for meaningful connections  are universal, and are displayed in this film with enormous sensitivity and power.
The main character's struggle is one that most of us have encountered; that being, loving someone who is clearly not right for us, who is trouble with a capital T, and who will eventually lead us down a dark and destructive path. But the character's gnawing hunger for affection and belonging blinds him to those simple truths. In one scene, the character, who turns street hustler and thief to please the one he loves, offers money to another man just for a kiss. His loneliness is tangible and pervades and drives the action of the film.
The ending of this film is boldly powerful and is consistent with the self-destructive road that the character is forced to take to fulfill his aching need for love. It demonstrates the very fine line between love and hate, between the need and the anger, between hope and hopelessness, and between self esteem and self loathing. Although unremittingly bleak and sad, the film is brilliantly directed and acted. It is a film that is both moving and harrowing.",1055980800,19,1371,4.960869565217391
7811451,5,6301424182,"Whatever else this film may be, it is basically the story of love denied and the incredible pain that denial causes. Heart-wrenching to watch. The entire cast provides incredible performances, especially Anglade as the  young, heart-broken Henri. The film really transcends it's homoerotic theme  to the larger theme of the horrible suffering of being unable to connect  with someone you are in love with, a theme seen throughout the film and not  just in Henri's tortured life. Excellent film...painful to watch...",959040000,11,515,5.320987654320987
