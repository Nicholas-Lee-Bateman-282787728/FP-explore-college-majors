I've been using this workout for 15 years, and STILL think it's the best of its kind. My ONLY regret is that this is not available in DVD, and is a dying breed. The Firm has continued to make workout videos, but this one is by FAR the best of its kind. They have not been able to improve on it with any of their new instructors, or approaches. I HOPE that one day the company will break down, and digitize this jewel.",1241827200,,695,4.346153846153846
8324813,5,B0001M3MZM,"They call this one a ""short workout"" - originally Volume 4 of the Firm classic total body workouts. It does give you a very thorough workout and it breaks up the routine so that you're doing short non-weighted cardio segment interspersed with powerful weighted segments. Lunges, plies, deltoids, biceps, triceps, lat rows, and a solid ab segment followed by a thorough stretch. I added this tape to my routine, graduating to it a couple of months after I had my son 16 years ago and found it to be not boring at all. That and a reasonably healthy diet caused me to drop 43 pounds in six months and I remained in solid shape by using this tape three days per week for several years. Like most of us, unfortunately I found myself dropping out of the exercise routines due to day-to-day life. But after getting a wake-up call and realizing that I'm in the WORST shape of my life, I broke it out again today, starting out slowly and with no weights (there's a segment at the end where they tell you how to start without getting sore) and I have to tell you I made it fine through it, I feel wonderful, and I wonder why I ever put it to the side.

The moves are fluid, safe, and easy to follow. The instructors aren't annoyingly perky. You do need a step-up box and some hand weights after the first week, but that's easy enough. It's a solid workout that delivers the promised ""Visible results within 10 workouts"". I just wish they'd bring it back and put it on DVD!",1200009600,3,1462,4.375
