3804386,1,B001UV4XBK,"Silly multiple frames make some scenes eerie, old footage that been seen a thosand times before, no real focal point, and all these things add up to a below average documentary.  The people who make HBO's 24/7 should go into doing boxing documentaries because their production from video, to audio, to themes is solid compared to second rate documentaries like this .",1250640000,2,367,4.919354838709677

3804390,5,B001UV4XBK,"This is a GREAT DVD - buy it!

Mike Tyson is so rare.  A ""thug"" who became the greatest fighter of all time.  He's a lion whose mind truly rages.  A raw individual.  You'll fall in love with Mike by the end of the film.  There's no one greater.  Don't miss this DVD.",1245888000,2,266,3.9056603773584904
3804391,4,B001UV4XBK,"In the classic book The Art of War, written over 2,000 years ago, Sun Tzu said: ""The battle is won or lost before it's even begun.""

In this movie, Tyson's public and private battles, successes and failures, wins and losses, show the truth of this saying.

Through it all, Tyson talks to camera, and his speaking style mirrors the relentlessness he showed as one of the greatest fighters ever.

As you watch the story gets more gripping, and it's easy to be amazed and perhaps a little horrified by both his blinding speed and ferocity as a fighter.

I can remember a coworker asking me one time, after watching Tyson demolish someone in half a round, if I would fight him for $4 million. I said no way. ""But you would get $4 million.""  I said if it was Ali I know he wouldn't kill me, so I might risk it because he wouldn't kill me, but with Tyson you would have no such assurance.

In life as in boxing, Tyson pulls no punches, and it's odd, and not a little surreal to watch him talk and hear the shocking and surprising things he has to say about Robin Givens, Desiree Washington, and Don King, not to mention his celebrated fights including the ones with Holyfield and Lewis, and with Berbick, where he was battling herpes.

It would appear that his mentor Cus d'Amato instilled discipline in him, and was a huge positive force in his life.  That story is very touching.

Late in the movie we see a segment where he play boxes with his young daughter, a beautiful counterpoint to all that's gone before.  I wonder if this is Exodus.  If it is, it's quite poignant.

If you get the opportunity, I recommend you go see Tyson while it is still in release.  It's natural to compare this with other fight movies, such as the Oscar nominated 'When We Were Kings' starring Muhammad Ali.

What makes this one so compelling is its unique narrative style, with Tyson talking, and the extreme nature of his successes and failures, interspersed then news coverage and segments of fights and incidents.  Those who see it will understand why I would not call this a documentary.  I hope you find this review helpful.",1243296000,36,2107,4.505263157894737
3804392,4,B001UV4XBK,"James Toback, the director of ""Tyson,"" has commented in interviews promoting this film that he sees Mike Tyson as ""a classically tragic figure."" The story, as presented here, of how he transformed himself from a lispy voiced overweight kid, who was regularly bullied while growing up in one of the toughest neighbourhoods in America, to a fighter, who at his peak was among the most dominant heavyweight champions ever, to the middle-aged man shown as he is today, his face wrinkled and his belly soft, his  fortunes squandered, and his sense of self publicly shamed innumerable times for various outrageous acts both in and out of the ring, is a tragedy in it's truest sense.

Toback has been friends with the former heavyweight champion for several years and it shows as Tyson unguardedly reveals to the camera the damaged contradictive person that exists behind the popular image of his merely being some kind of brutal animal. Other than the numerous segments of archival television footage showing Tyson in the ring, in interviews or being followed in public, Toback's documentary zeroes in on its subject and leaves Tyson the only person to appear on screen, his voice the only one that is heard.  Sometimes he is shown in split screen with snippets of his monologue looped to repeat or overlapped to form a sound collage, presumably to evoke the confusion in his obviously tortured mind, as he recounts the various losses he has suffered, the way he sees the scales of justice always balanced against him.  The result is claustrophobic.

Like any tragedy this is not an easy story to watch.  At times it feels like you are looking at the wreckage from a violent road accident: once you start looking at it you want to look away but can't.  Anne Carson suggests in her preface to Euripedes' classical Greek tragedy, ""Herakles"" (a play those who are interested in Tyson should read), that watching stories of other people who are lost in their grief and rage is beneficial for us.  It helps to cleanse us of our darkness.  If you believe that, you owe it to yourself to seek out this film.",1243036800,48,2094,4.778393351800554
3804393,5,B001UV4XBK,"I've seen tons of shows on Mike Tyson and am actually a big Tyson fan and I was hoping that this film would pay justice to such an intriguing story.  This film is very well done and captures all of what is Mike Tyson and in many ways that Mike Tyson documentaries in the past have failed to do.  While there is plenty of great footage of all of his fights and knockouts, training and of archive footage outside the ring too, a lot of the film is of Mike himself telling his story beginning from the time of his youth.

You can tell that Mike must have been very comfortable with the film makers because his story is told in such a raw and emotional fashion.  It seems like it must have been just a ""very good day"" for him to tell his story so well.  Humble and honest, Mike guides us through the different periods and events of his life and gives vivid and raw insights into his thoughts and feelings about them and about how he was feeling at the time.

It really was a very interesting story and my wife who previously didn't like him at all and every time there was something about Mike Tyson on tv she would always say ""There's that big jerk, what a low life.  Turn this off!"" was just fascinated by the film and you could tell that she really started to like Tyson after she got the chance to see what he was actually like and not as just the circus act that the media portrays him as sometimes.

Like I said, the film is also really well done which is so important to the entertainment value of any documentary or film for that matter whereas no matter how interesting the story, if the film is done poorly it's really not that fun to watch.  This film is highly recommended whether you're a Tyson fan or not.",1241568000,10,1715,4.204268292682927

Mike is a natural and compelling storyteller...profoundly (often painfully) honest. Imagine if  Shakespeare  was raised in a Brooklyn project and did a one man show about his life.

We are taken from his lowly days as a meek, fat kid who was bullied mercilessly,  to his rise to  the pinnacle of boxing world (heck, dare I say the sports world period), to his spectacular  fall courtesy of the likes of Robin Givens and, the devil himself, Mr. Don King.

The ninety minutes seem like nine as the viewer is completely absorbed in the experience.

From his victories to his downfalls Mike Tyson speaks out about his life. The first time I saw this it was on HBO about a year ago and I was completely glued to the tale. Over the years the media made Mike Tyson out to beat the greatest champion and then they made him out to be the greatest monster. What you learn from this film is that Mike Tyson is truly a misunderstood individual. A person who came from nothing and found someone whom he admired that actually showed him for the first time what it means to have someone that cares about you and believes in you. Mike goes on to tell the tale of what made him a champion and what caused the mold of a champion to break. The film is very direct and short on bs. Mike Tyson just tells it like it is.

3804490,4,B001UV4XBK,"After watching this movie, one of the things that struck me was how often in his career Mike Tyson would pick up the poor boxer he knocked out after his victory.  As one taken in by the propaganda of the ""brutal savage"" in the mid-1980s at the height of the fame and glory of Tyson, I think that this documentary does more justice to him as an individual.

Of course, much of boxing, is just that, propaganda designed to sell fights, so some of the other reviewers should have recognized this in their reviews; and Mike Tyson's entire story was not told, nor was it told in the best way; the director is occasionally slightly condescending toward him.

I think that he has matured a lot over the years and gotten some perspective.  This I think was very good for him.  I liked the fact that the documentary went into depth in his early life, and that he has a reasonable family life now.  Occasional crudeness comes through re: his Sarah Palin comment, but on the whole he was very poised and gracious and respectable for most of the movie.

So, it was good to see this side of him, the side that the boxing promoters were so eager to hide his entire boxing life, and the side that developed fully and flowered with some of the hard knocks he received and brought on himself after his boxing superstardom.  He was unbeatable in his prime, and one can only speculate how much different his career would have been if Cus D'Amato would have lived longer.",1329609600,,1451,4.449056603773585

You get interspersed fight clips as well as his out-of-the-ring life to flesh out the narrative but, yeah, it's Iron Mike opening up about all manner of things about the life he's led.

It's pretty raw and all the better for it. James Toback, tthough, never lets it get dull as he uses all sorts of quite cool film techniques such as picture in picture or multiple screen images as well as overlaps the monologues so they almost loop together like a music video. It's hard to explain well but you'll understand when you watch the movie.

The extras are basically Toback explaining the movie. One such extra has him at a screening on what seems like an Australian TV show (the presenter is Australian) but everyone in the audience seems to be British.",1328832000,,843,4.5394736842105265

3804506,3,B001UV4XBK,"I stepped into Tyson with a pretty distinct idea of who the subject was, where he came from, and what I thought of his legacy. Ultimately, I was hoping this kind of long-session chat in a comfortable place with the former champion would reveal some special insight into his complex identity and deliberately checked my preconceptions at the door to better facilitate an open mind. Turns out I really shouldn't have bothered. Despite his best intentions to prove otherwise, Mike Tyson comes across as a simple man who desperately wants to be deep but is either unwilling or unable to hide the truth. At the core of his being he's pure reflex, which is a trait that served him well during his days in the ring but left him ripe for coercion outside its boundaries. Phenomenal athletes rarely double as tangible role models, and Tyson himself offers dramatic proof of that fact. Little more than an ego stroke, the documentary focuses almost exclusively on the ex-champ's point of view and skims over or accepts thin excuses for each of the more intriguing moments of his life. The most surprising thing about it came from Mike's old training footage, and the realization of just how blindingly fast he really was at his peak.",1308268800,2,1223,4.773584905660377

3804508,4,B001UV4XBK,"Whether you are an old fan of Tyson or you can't stand the guy, if you go into this documentary with an open mind you'll love it and most likely come away with a fresh perspective on the guy. This documentary functions as an in depth and entertaining look at one of the biggest (and most controversial) sport figures of our times. The film is basically one long sit down with Mike, as he narrates us through his life in a very personal and honest way. As he speaks there is of course frequent intercut news and fight footage to accompany the interviews.

The movie successfully gets to the roots of Tyson's mad and often unflattering behavior, about halfway through the movie you'll start to realize you kind of understand why he is the way he is. You'll never see stuff like the Holyfield ear biting incident the same way again. The best thing about the movie is how Tyson seems to be able to step outside of himself to explore his behavior and persona in a surprisingly objective light, which is something I think most viewers will find refreshing. Anyone who likes a good character study should definitely check this out... I found it endlessly fascinating. 4.25/5 stars",1294272000,2,1173,4.6124401913875595
3804509,4,B001UV4XBK,"What I like about this movie is its palpable REALNESS especially with regard to its subject, an exceptionally intense and damaged human being who is allowed to pretty much tell his own story in his own words ... there is an almost autobiographical vibe going on here, as if we are watching a man trying to make sense of himself and his life right in front of us, reaching and failing at times, but impossible not to see his humanity in spite of the considerable darkness and shadows in his life.

Things I'll remember from this film:

- Hearing his voice change and break as he chokes back tears while talking about his boxing coach and surrogate father, Cus D'Amato.

- Hearing him describe his childhood growing up in an extremely tough neighborhood in a broken home, basically a completely vulnerable, helpless and terrified child who carried a deep primal fear of physical humiliation with him for the rest of his life.  Again, his voice takes on the high pitch and wavering tones of a frightened child.

- Hearing the rapid fire, disjointed and often incoherent jumble of his thoughts, it's easy to see how this lack of mental discipline/order was probably the bane of his existence.  The film emphasizes this with multiple simultaneous shots of him talking and jump-repeats him, as if you are listening to a broken CD that's skipping in one place on a track.

- Images of him in a designer suit standing on a beach with his hands on his hips and pacing up and down, small but free against the vast backdrop of sea and sky yet a caged man, imprisoned inside his chaotic head.

There were some nice clips of his fights but this isn't really a ""fight movie""---more of a case study.

I didn't really follow the Desiree Washington rape case, so listened to Tyson's insistent rejection of the charges having no idea whether to believe him or not, and the film makes no attempt to argue the case for or against him.  Ditto with the domestic abuse his first wife, Robin Givens, publicly accused him of...we only have Mike's side of the story.  This is consistent with the autobiographical vibe of the film, however.

Ultimately, we leave this film with a better idea of who Mike Tyson is than before, but there's plenty of space for ambiguity here.  Mike Tyson remains a mystery to us---and, I suspect, to himself as well.  In that respect, perhaps he is not so different from any of us at all.",1288137600,3,2392,4.597647058823529
3804510,3,B001UV4XBK,"Like a lot of sports fans, I followed Mike Tyson's career. The story of the delinquent from Brooklyn who became the heavyweight champ was tough to resist. When I saw all of the positive reviews of the film Tyson, I looked forward to watching it. After watching, I felt mildly disappointed; the media has covered Tyson's life with such intensity and for so long that nothing in the film seems fresh or revealing.

By any measure, Tyson is a great story. He's stood on the highest peaks and sunk to the lowest depths in his forty-odd years. For viewers who have are not familiar with Tyson, there is plenty to sustain interest. The intense coverage of Tyson has left reams of video that director James Toback weaves together to tell Tyson's story. However, viewers who are not boxing fans probably will find some of the slow-motion shots from Tyson's boxing matches to be grotesque.

The film also includes lots of soul-searching interviews with Tyson. Tyson struggles to put his life in perspective and makes some revealing comments; all too often, however, he blames his biggest failures on others. One problem with the interviews is that Tyson often slurs his words, making him difficult to understand. The slurring reminds me of Muhammad Ali at about the same age and it makes me worry that Tyson may also have brain damage from boxing.

Tyson's life has been so remarkable for so long that his story may be better suited to a book. I'm glad I watched this film; I'm just not as enthusiastic as are other reviewers.",1287792000,4,1517,4.716981132075472

Tyson makes me so proud for being a fan of boxing. It was fascinating to see and hear this man speak about his early memories. It was touching, and it can't get more real than this! Tyson is still a champion, always will be. Amidst the chaos in his head, his story is fiery and... human.

3804523,5,B001UV4XBK,"If you want to understand Tyson, then watch this film. It contains many fight clips as well as extensive interviewing of Tyson. It goes through Tyson's life from beginning to 2009. Mike Tyson's reign may not have been long, but he had something special, which I will call the Greatness Factor. At the height of his career, Tyson was undeniably GREAT! He took down the best fighters of his day, making them look like amateurs. When Tyson was in top shape, he was unstoppable. I see a parallel with Bobby Fischer, 1972 world chess champion. Fischer also possessed the Greatness Factor. Again, his reign didn't last long as he failed to defend his title, but in 1970 when he played the candidates tournament to see who would go on to face the then current world champion, Fischer annihilated the competition. He beat top grandmasters 6 wins to 0 losses. Similarly, Tyson beat top contenders (remember Sphinx) in the first round. He won the Championship against Berbick in the second round. Again, Greatness. True greatness comes when you are so far ahead of the competition that you more or less walk over them. Tyson and Fischer's reigns didn't last long, but it's ok because they gave us something much more valuable. They showed us true Greatness (in their sport, not their personal lives). Tyson will go down as a legend.",1280275200,,1322,4.777292576419214
3804524,2,B001UV4XBK,"If one wants to know the psychology behind a complex and largely pathetic person like Mike Tyson, Mr. Tyson is probably the last individual you should consult. His is not an analytical or honest mind. The monologues that comprise the vast majority of the minutes taped for this documentary are endless and cannot be trusted. What I hoped for here was historical analysis and that is not what Tyson, the movie, offers. Ten minutes of interview with our subject would be profitable but ninety minutes is a waste of everyone's time. I suppose this endeavor is deemed artistic and poignant by critics, but I disagree with such a conclusion. A worm's eye view remains the view of a worm. This film was a serious disappointment.",1280016000,3,722,4.784
3804525,5,B001UV4XBK,"I grew up watching Mike Tyson back in the days when his fights were free on HBO / Showtime.  They were always an event and something me and my friends looked forward to (accept after the fight when someone would pretend to be Tyson and someone else got to play his opponent).  So when I saw the Tyson documentary I bought it for the nostalgia of my youth.  At this point in my life I no longer thought Tyson was the badest man on the planet and even thought of him of somewhat of a joke (when you consider it his fights with Holyfield and Lewis plus his most recent comebacks).

However there is a lot to Tyson that people tend to gloss over and the reality is he is a very interesting person both in the good and bad sense.  Yes he has a past that is not very respectful and he seems to have a low opinion of women.  However this documentary really shows you how and why Tyson is who is is, and perhaps in a similar situation some of us would have made the same choices he did?

This is a movie that Tyson is the central character of and not a bunch of people sitting around remembering how great he was.  This is Tyson the man laying it out and being very open and honest.  I would have enjoyed this movie if I had never heard of Tyson but being a former fan I really walked away happy.",1274745600,2,1288,4.059288537549407

3804528,4,B001UV4XBK,"I watched Tyson from his glory years to his bitter and embarrassing end in the boxing world. In his hey day I don't think there was another boxer who gave us such a brutal display of raw power. This documentary is very good, but there are a few issues with it that kept me from giving it 5 stars. The biggest reason is that at certain points the producer uses a split screen with multiple bits of dialogue that over lap and this is not only distracting, but actually brings on unintentional humor as it makes it look like Tyson is just rambling! It's a heartbreaking story and all the makers of this film needed to do is turn the camera on. We don't need any optical tricks as Mike's tragic to inspiring and then tragic again life is more than enough to hold one's interest. I would have liked to have seen some more fighting footage too, but it's a very good documentary about a man who came so close to being the greatest boxer of all time.",1264377600,,942,4.268156424581005
3804529,5,B001UV4XBK,"This unusual DVD exposes Mike Tyson's many facets, as revealed mainly by his own candid reflections and reminiscences on his self and his life, a life which faced terrible adversity as a youth and has been a rocky road ever since.  Tyson speaks very openly about both the good and bad, perhaps because it helps him wrestle with his demons, maintain a connection with the better parts of his past, and achieve necessary personal growth.

Since it's really best for you to watch this well-crafted, gripping, and moving DVD to form the picture for yourself, I don't want to go into too many of the details, but let me at least say that you may find Tyson to be a very different person from the impression you formed through the media.  Yes, he indeed has his crude, egotistic, and aggressive side, but we discover that he also can be surprisingly humble, insightful, wise, loving, and humane.  Tyson isn't simply a caricature of a brute, but rather an intelligent and complex person who's pysche was damaged by his past, and who's now trying hard to heal and become a better person.  The story seems tragic in many ways, but Tyson is only middle-aged, so perhaps we can be optimistic about his future.

If you're a reasonably sensitive soul who wants to witness an intriguing way in which the human condition has manifested itself, I highly recommend watching this DVD.  It's a trip off the beaten path, but you may still find some of the scenery to be strangely familiar.",1264032000,4,1469,4.670542635658915

It was not a documentary where the subject is being interviewed and other people are interviewed and so forth, but this is the strong point. Tyson himself talks to the camera about his story, and this was edited very well with the archival clips, so the movie has a good pace and never drags on or gets boring. At the same time, its not very deep or far reaching in scope, so for those who are not interested in Tysons reflections on his life, they will be bored with this.",1263081600,4,541,4.262135922330097

3804554,5,B001UV4XBK,"Mike Tyson has been of the most controversial sports figure. His career started with awe and ended in a guffaw. His personal life was even more newsworthy than his professional life. This documentary shows us the softer side of this man everyone loves to hate. Tyson began his life as a scared kid in one of the meanest neighborhoods in Brooklyn. He turns to boxing because of a chance encounter with a boxing coach. He found a mentor in Cus D'Amato who takes him under his wings and coaches him to be the ferocious fighter that he eventually becomes. His death is the only thing that makes this man teary eyed and unable to speak. Once can see that he is still visibly shaken and unable to fill the gap that D'Amato's death ahs left in his life. The documentary starts with the Trevor Berbick fight and sort of chronicles Tyson's incredible force in the ring. HIs mottos was get in the ring and get the job done. One may be led to think this man was an animal but he was anything but. What made him vicious was a deep study of his opponents. He was let down by all the people in his life, whom he trusted but the man is not bitter. Don King and the women he allegedly raped are the only people he bad mouths in the documentary. Not that he considers himself to be any better, calling himself a jerk and a leech. ""Old too soon, smart too late"" that is how his life unfolded. The damage shown in the documentary is not just what he did to the opponents but what he self inflicted. This documentary is superb. So go out and rent it.....",1259971200,,1534,4.274914089347079

I was just as mesmerized with the director, James Toback, for his insight and directorial storytelling, albeit, through the confessions of an iconic Greek tragedy --Mike Tyson. What a powerful piece of documentary! What a bold look at the fierce dynamics of the unconscious rising to the surface of a perplexed mind, and, later, subdued by it. This documentary blew previous notions about the man into little pieces. What it did to one watching it was affect one deeply, and after all was said and done, just stare.",1258934400,,829,4.971223021582734
3804557,4,B001UV4XBK,"The reason to be afraid of former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson is he's afraid of you, afraid you are yet another who will hurt him, the 2009 documentary TYSON tells us.  Unlike many such films, the only narration comes from the subject, Mike Tyson.  As the prize fighter has been the topic of so much commentary -  some of it perhaps uninformed - that seems fair.  While TYSON features many film clips of the man's fights inside and outside the boxing ring, its original footage comprises Tyson reflecting on his accomplishments and failures.

In TYSON, Mike Tyson recalls he knew he'd won a boxing match before the first round when he saw an opponent's fear.  However, Tyson says his numerous well-documented incidents of misconduct also resulted from fear - his own fear of suffering more of the pain and humiliation he knew so well in childhood, between the broken home and violent community from where he came.

I remember seeing Mike Tyson on a television talk show early in his career as he was racking up victories on his way to becoming boxing's youngest heavyweight champion.  Humble and soft-spoken, he came across as a 200-pound puppy dog in that interview and I recall it so well, especially in contast to the ornery orator he became in the years that followed.  While you may know the death of mentor Cus D'Amato stifled the progress Mike Tyson (then just age 19) was making as a boxer, Tyson's testimony in this film shows losing Mr. D'Amato cost the young fighter the only family he knew.

With so much growing left to do when Cus D'Amato died, Mike Tyson fell prey to the con artists and freeloaders, TYSON recalls.  Just as one can't succeed without help, maintaining success requires support too, and without D'Amato the hands around Mike Tyson were not helping.

The Mike Tyson I saw on that television talk show had a family.  The Mike Tyson lunging at his opponents at fight weigh-ins was alone.  And, again, afraid.

What Cus D'Amato was to Mike Tyson's development as both a fighter and a man, the film TYSON is to understanding Mike Tyson.

3804559,5,B001UV4XBK,"Much more than a story of a champion fallen. This could be the story of so many men (titles not withstanding.) I was incredibly moved by this documentary. I had an eerie feeling from the directors' interviews -- how he revealed his motivations for befriending and peeling back the layers of Mike Tyson. [Just my opinion: More for his greed than for his art.] As for the subject of this film, whatever you walk in thinking about him, he will show you more of both -- good and bad. I feel this film could do a lot for so many of our young men - especially those who are engaging in violence [of any sort] to cope with their feelings; feelings of love and feelings of rage and their juxtaposition. A sum of many parts: this is a story of what child abuse can cause any boy in our society and one man that found a way to endure into his 40's. Activists and the social services address much about what girls and women endure, but this time we witness the possible result of the neglect, the lack of nurturing, the missing identity and the poverty in every manner endured by our boys -- and THAT IF they survive the hell -- will become our men. And, this is a story of redemption (the motives of the director aside.) If the director intended to exploit Mike Tyson, Iron-Mike dodged the jab. For women who have endured abuse by a wounded male or their own wounded father... you may find empathy-if you will. The reality that they abuse because they were abused isn't an excuse for their behavior -- it's an understanding that may bring you hope and healing.",1256601600,,1550,4.385416666666667
3804560,5,B001UV4XBK,"Michael Gerard Tyson is a damaged soul with a ferocious dark side; no one's denying that.  But in this short masterpiece, James Toback lets us know, in no uncertain terms, that this steely eyed, broken, disturbed hulk of a man--and would-be Greatest of all Time--is no monster.

In many ways this Hieronymous Bosch-like documentary answers not only the questions of boxing fans concerning precisely *why* the man with a left arm containing deadly titanium embarked on a campaign of personal, public, and professional self destruction; it also shatters the cruel image that the general public has of Tyson as a sociopathic animal.  Indeed, his name itself has become synonymous in everyday life with brutality, aggression, and rape (a rape which I highly doubt he committed).

Mike Tyson's psyche, compromised as it is by trauma, brain damage, mental illness, and post traumatic stress disorder was apparently on task for Toback's rigorous expose of the man's psyche.  There are times when he does come across as slightly inarticulate, archaic in the way he speaks (as the director noted in his ""Special Features"": ""Mike's relationship to language is physical, concrete."") Almost poetic, I'd say: Tyson tells the truth with an almost amusingly crude flair that one cannot help but find amusing.

Tyson grew up in a section of NYC that is uninhabitable for human beings (Brownsville) and the rate of survival is perhaps akin to that of humans living during the Black Death.  He recalls quite freely being beaten up, abandoned by his parents, and really being little more than a frightened child who wanted to little else but play with his homing pigeons, which he had in a small coop in the tiny, broken down apartment he lived in.  ""I never wanted to fight no one"", he says at one point.  ""Guys held us up at gunpoint, took our cookies, everything we had.""  One day, though, an older man started to hassle Tyson about his pigeons and calling him a sissy for having them.  To prove his point, he broke the pigeon's neck right in front of him.  Tyson learned to fight that day and beat the guy up so badly that earned the respect of the people in the area.

He gives a satisfying story about beating the hell out of Don King in front of a group of rich sycophants in Beverly Hills, but most of his life (aside from when he unified all the divisions by winning every belt possible) is tragedy.  He is proud, one can tell, of having done things in boxing that no one ever has before; but he is aware more of what might have been.

What I found most interesting was the technique Toback used.  One sees and hears Tyson on four different screens, his mouth, his eyes, a sort of sensory assault from the Baddest Man On the Planet.  This is also confirmed for me that Evander Holyfield, while still a great boxer, will do whatever he has to do in order to win.  The first fight he ""accidentally"" headbutted Tyson twice, cutting his eye and disabling him.  The second time he did the same thing, and Tyson's trauma from prison, his extreme rage, and his recognition that Evander Holyfield was being seen as ""the good guy"" even when he was fouling him on purpose all exploded into the notorious ""ear biting"" moment. Holyfield knew he couldn't win, and he was actually pretty successful at his Machievellian (not Christian) strategy: make Tyson look like a nutcase by provoking him, and then create the myth that he committed the foul in order to escape the fight. (Holyfield was no Muhammad Ali, and though Tyson mentions that they were friends, he does not once address whether he could have handled The Greatest in the ring.)

A fantastic film for boxing fans and *especially* non boxing fans.  Watch especially for the part where Tyson recites a poem by Oscar Wilde, which, believe it or not, he knew by heart.",1256428800,2,3802,4.704374057315234
3804561,5,B001UV4XBK,"Mike Tyson's reaction upon seeing this film for the first time was ""It's like a Greek tragedy. The only problem is that the subject is me."" This is a fairly accurate description. Tyson describes his desperate beginnings growing up as an abandoned child in the mean streets of Brooklyn. He says he was bullied mercilessly and this desire to never be humiliated again is what drive him to such ferocity in the ring.

A major turning point in his life was coming under the tutelage of his mentor Cus D'Amato. D'Amato taught him how to box. But more importantly gave him discipline and character, the sort of self-respect required to function as a man as well as a fighter. After D'Amato's death Tyson lost his spark, taking a road towards self-destruction that he seems to have never been able to leave.

The director James Toback traces Tyson's rise as perhaps the most dominating heavyweight champ of all time. The early part of the film is exhilirating and Tyson comes across a largely sympathetic and even inspiring figure. While the latter part of the movie documents Tyson's series of bad choices which led to his downfall. The overall portrait that emerges is of an immensely talented but seriously troubled individual who it's possible to both admire and despise but never forget about.",1256169600,,1291,4.83710407239819

I have come to realize three things after watching this documentary.  First, Mike Tyson could have been the best fighter ever, had he done a better job controlling himself outside of the ring (no question about it).  Second, the media seemed to have a good time portraying him as a jerk.  Third, he was only human.  I consider myself a good person, but I'm sure I would have made many of the same dumb mistakes if I were in his shoes.

I found myself feeling compassion for Tyson and believing he is actually a good person.  Perhaps he was just too successful at too young of an age?  Whatever the case, I would love to sit and enjoy a nice cold beer with the guy.

The documentary is told in Tyson's own words.  The documentary shows clips of many of Tyson's fights as well as telling his story about his childhood.

This is a very moving and very depressing auto biography on film.  I love Mike Tyson and it truly broke my heart to watch this.

We get a close look at his kids and see the fatherly side of him.  Along with his narrative, you see clips of footage from boxing matches, interviews, etc.  The infamous ear biting of Evander Holifield is analyzed and gave me a new perspective on that fight.

This is a self-portrait of and by Mike Tyson to which Toback has given form and style. The interviews were filmed over the course of five days while Tyson was in rehab for substance dependency. It took a year to edit. Often presented in split screen, sometimes with multiple voices, the style is intended to reflect the conflicting threads in Tyson's mind. I was surprised that technique came off so fluidly. There is some archival footage as well, but it is always Tyson's voice we hear.

Mike Tyson can always be relied upon to be candid, which tends not to cast him in the most flattering light. As usual, he speaks in all honesty in these interviews. I don't mean that he always speaks the objective truth, but I think he always says what he genuinely believes. But, in this case, as impolitic as his words may sometimes be, it doesn't always work against him. We see Tyson's rage, paranoia, and candor within the context of his experiences and life story. Mike Tyson has a mind that combines contemplation and primitivism in a unique and unexpected choreography -sometimes a dance, sometimes a war.

He begins with childhood memories of poverty in Brooklyn. First arrested at the age of 12, Tyson was introduced to boxing while doing a stint at Tryon detention center upstate. He speaks with great emotion of his first trainer and manager, Cus D'Amato, then recalls his rise to international stardom and the eventual deterioration of his personal and professional lives. He says what he thinks of women and sex, why he liked fighting, talks about his tattoos, the ear-biting incident with Evander Holyfield, and his rape conviction and years in prison.

I have no interest in boxing, but I did not come to this film a Tyson-hater either. The press' habit of asking Tyson provocative questions then conveniently using his frank answers to provoke a verbal lynching made me feel bad for the guy. ""Tyson"" leaves it entirely to the audience to draw its own conclusions about the man. The film has a broader audience than boxing fans and Tyson groupies. Never coy, it is an undeniably captivating and thoughtful portrait of a controversial figure, likely to evoke as wide a range of emotions in the audience as it does in Tyson.

The DVD (Sony 2009): Bonus features include 3 featurettes, a theatrical trailer (2 min), and an audio commentary. ""A Day with James Toback"" (16 min) spends a day in  Beverly Hills with Toback as he does publicity for the film, ending with its Hollywood premiere in the evening. ""Iron Mike: Toback Talks about Tyson"" (12 min) is a Q&A session in which Toback takes questions about making the film, reactions, and Tyson. ""The Big Picture Show"" (13 min) is another Q&A with Toback on a television program called ""The Fabulous Picture Show"". The audio commentary by James Toback is constant and a bit rambling, but he talks about archival footage, the impression Tyson makes, his interview technique, and offers some of his own analysis of the interview. Subtitles are available for the film in English and French.",1251504000,,3336,4.8558875219683655
3804591,5,B001UV4XBK,"Perhaps about 8-10 minutes too long but this documentary should reap n Oscar. Considering his social history it might not be. But after watching Tyson wax eloquent on a myriad of subjects, most notably on his new sense of priority and values, an award is probably not in his view.
Seems The Champ needed money and so agreed to his last three or four fights. Maybe he needed to catch up in that area once again, by co-Producing this film? Who knows?
What really counts is that he has re-invented himself as a Philospher and not one limited to his profession.
Sometimes his thoughtful statements are countered by admissions of illegal drug use and erratic behavior in many settings. This criminal aspect is not attacked head on, though -  he matter of factly asks, how could I put that garbage in my body? Not why does a guy who came from the back alleys, was happy to overcome that situation, always seem to return to them? The viewer wonders if he'll ever overcome that propensity, as  a middle-aged man.
The (recent) personal tragedy surely must have restricted the promotion of this project, so the person considering it's worth in lught of its' fast move into the retail bins should not be deterred.
Muti-effects are sometimes overdone, but the sound and editing is superb.",1251331200,,1276,4.7174887892376685
3804592,5,B001UV4XBK,"This is a very good documentary on the life of Mike Tyson, his early years as a kid in Brooklyn, his formative years as a young boxer under the tutelage of Cus D'Amato, his championship years and reign of the heavyweight division and his ultimate downfall from grace.  This is a very engaging in your face interview with Tyson, you get to understand the negative forces, poverty, limited education, that had such a traumatic impact on Tyson as a young person that carried over into his adult life, struggling with his inner demons.  At times I felt very sad for Mike Tyson but by the end of the movie came to realize that Mike is human and we do make mistakes during our walks in life and that forgiveness and love is what we all seek in the end.  Great documentary!!",1250812800,2,767,4.425531914893617
3804593,4,B001UV4XBK,"i`ve watched many mike tyson interviews and documentaries.like him or hate him when he is not on a wild rant you will find a very real person.what i mean is mike does not cover things he tells you exactly how something happened or how he felt about something,almost everytime.i enjoy how straight forward he is.the fights with holyfield were amazing i`ve never seen it like that before.not saying mike shoulda chewed on evander but holyfield was definitely fighting dirty and nothing was being done about it,so i could see where he got upset.like he said holyfield was intetionally trying to hurt him.those head butts are serious and can have you knocked out on your feet and he kept doing it.but seeing where he was at mentally during alot of this was interesting.like how he wasn`t the same mike after serving the sentence for the rape charge and how that whole experince effected him to this very day.it`s worth the buy.",1250726400,,923,4.775
8345054,3,B001UV4XBK,"Ok dvd. I bought it mainly because Tyson is my all time favorite boxer ever! He tells his own personal view of the business and people he's dealt with throughout the years. Opens up about his relationship with: Don King, Cuss D' amato and even goes in depth talking about his marriage to Robin Givens. He spoke on his dark period of being incarcerated for a rape conviction and coming out getting back on top winning another world title before being banned from boxing biting Holyfield's ear. It's a good dvd to watch and have in your collection, especially if you're a Tyson fan; Just wasn't as great as i thought it would be.",1523923200,,627,4.508771929824562
8345055,5,B001UV4XBK,"This documentary exceeded my expectations. The style it is film in can be at moments disconcerting, but it's lends a poetic feel to it. Tyson is blunt, but articulate. You gain in insight on a man that you may or may not like him, but you get the human side of the man. Like most people of power, right or wrong in his life, he has been misunderstood. Draw your own conclusions, though be ready to rethink what you may have thought prior to seeing this film. You will see Iron Mike in a new way.",1497312000,,495,4.166666666666667
