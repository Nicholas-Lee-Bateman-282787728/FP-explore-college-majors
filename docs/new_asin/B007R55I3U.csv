8521242,1,B007R55I3U,"hate it, hate it.  Corny, bad acting.  Need to be put on a shelf and never be spoken of again. Poor Chuck Connors what a waste of a good actor.",1379635200,,143,3.7333333333333334
8521243,3,B007R55I3U,"Shame about the film. Which is at best an oddball quirky almost student type film. The always at least interesting Chuck Conners. Is the most watchable thing in the movie. However the poor sound and murky picture makes this release almost unwatchable. I would advise any would be buyer. Not to pay the way too high price being asked. If ever available as a genuine release from a company that cares. At a far lower price. Well, perhaps then. But certainly not now and here.",1372896000,,473,4.576470588235294
