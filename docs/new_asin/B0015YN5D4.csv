8260530,3,B0015YN5D4,"Typical sleazy Isabel Sarli / Armando Bo collaboration.  Sarli plays a woman who falls off a yacht during a rainstorm.  She comes across a hermit who gives her shelter.  The hermit, played by Bo, has given up the corrupt world for prayer and reed farming.  Sarli then spends the rest of the movie flouncing around in the near-altogether, trying to tempt him.  Unfortunately she gains the attention of the hermit's farmhands, an unruly, brutish quartet that start to plan and bet on who gets the woman first.  The whole mess ends in tragedy.  The film has an abrupt ending and at only 51 minutes it is obvious that this has been edited to beat the band.  The film has some nudity.  The music is beautiful and atmospheric.  Argentine-made and dubbed into English.  The picture quality of the Something Weird DVD-R is OK.  Recommended for Trashy movie fans.",1407110400,,854,4.73469387755102
