8252817,1,B0013TP4VW,"The title of this DVD and the narritive that is associated with this DVD made me think that it was a historical study of Jamestown Colony with Christian content. Instead, it's a 38 min. (I have to admit after about 10 min. I had enough and turned it off) one sided statement of a pastor concerning a controversy that is associated with the 400th anniversity celebration. I was very dissapointed with this DVD.",1282608000,,409,4.616438356164384
