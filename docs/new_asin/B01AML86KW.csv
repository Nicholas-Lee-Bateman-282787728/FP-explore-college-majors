8747798,3,B01AML86KW,"I'd like to begin by stating that I very much appreciate an exercise DVD geared toward equestrians. I have several books in my library that offer a variety of ""riding specific' exercises, but having something on video wonderful.

These are no-nonsense exercises, reminiscent of calisthenics, with the sessions being brief and well-structured. The music is that non-stop, semi-frantic aerobic workout beat, but I've heard worse. The tone of the verbal instruction is neither bootcamp-esq, or incredibly encouraging. But overall, not off-putting.

Lots of squats, leg lifts, some basic arm ranging, and a lot of floor/mat abdominal work.

The not so good part is the lack of a proper warm up or cool down. I'm not sure if these were left out in order to keep the time to a minimum? But a person would want to be more knowledgeable in order to protect your body. Echoing this sentiment, I was very shocked that a certified personal trainer would leave out any and all (verbal or visual) tips on safe execution of the exercises.  Not once is there guidance on body alignment or safe positioning. So if this was your only point of reference for working out, there are an awful lot of helpful techniques to protect your body that are omitted.

The mediocre, for me, boils down to poor cueing. The instructor doesn't possess the ability to help you fluidly move from one exercise to the other. There's very little prep for transitions, which results in a stuttered / interrupted tempo. I have spent a lot of time in group exercise classes as a participant, and I also do a fair amount of teaching, so ""cueing"" is on my radar. (This is more annoying vs unsafe.)

My hope is this will pierce the veil for more equestrian based exercise videos to emerge. This has the good basics, but I see the potential for much improvement. Overall, I think that these were very expensive for the quality of instruction.",1517875200,,1896,4.765243902439025
8747799,4,B01AML86KW,"Excellent workout, well timed and executed. I do wish there was a quick run down of properly doing each maneuver (just a how-to), then the actual 20 minute workout. Trying to make sure I'm doing it right, and keep up, was a little discouraging. But I'll learn. I like the whinny at 10 minutes and again at 5 minutes- they keep you going :)",1467072000,,339,4.3125
8747800,5,B01AML86KW,"Great exercises.  Always different, so keeps me engaged.  The right level for my fitness, but if I have an off day I can follow the toned down version or go a little slower.  And if I ever get stronger I can follow a little more advanced moves.  If you want more than 20 minutes, do two sessions in a row.  But 20 minutes is just the right amount of time for me right now.  I am tired after 20 minutes, but not quite dead.  I have not made it to Vol 4 yet.  I am a very beginner rider, but I feel like these exercises compliment my horse riding lessons.",1464566400,,553,3.963636363636364
