1628070,5,B00005N5UE,"The information sections have been very helpful.  With this DVD you get it all, challenging, but not killer aerobics, strength training and relaxing yoga.  Kathy does it again with a very thoughtful, fun, helpful workout.  I would highly recommend it for anyone approaching or experiencing menopause.",1030406400,8,300,5.478260869565218
1628071,4,B00005N5UE,"You can rarely go wrong with Kathy Smith. Her videos are consistently well-produced, excellently choreographed (simple enough to be effective and easy to follow yet interesting enough to be fun) and effective. I get 90% of my workouts done with videos and she is really the cream of the crop especially if you're just getting started (she's great for intermediates as well). This video is not just for perimenopausal or menopausal women. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my menopausal mom and at 22, I use it more than her! The informative sections before and between the actual workouts are useful for people of any age. The nutritional tips are sound and the discussions about the cultural and personal meanings of menopause were interesting to me even if I am 30 years away from if myself. The cardio segment is the best. It's fast and thorough, it will really get your heart pumping, and I enjoy working out to it. I am less pleased with the strength training. It isn't bad per se, she's just done better. Some of the poses in this section may be too challenging for beginners and other moves aren't challenging at all. The one part of this section I enjoy is the Pilates part but there's not enough of it to consider it a thorough Pilates session. I'm not a big fan of yoga so her yoga section did not do much for me. However, if you're just starting with yoga, the majority of poses are possible. However, beware if you have not done yoga before or are inflexible because the last 1 or 2 poses are too difficult for beginners. You may want to try KS's TimeSaver Strength Training tape which contains upper and lower body and abdominal work in separate 20 minute sections and Kathy Smith's beginner's yoga tape. One more thing that gave me pause about this video is that KS has been releasing too many 20 minute cardio workouts. While this is enough of a workout to maintain cardiovascular strength and a weight you are already pleased with, if you are trying to lose fat, you need more than 20 minutes of cardio. I hope Kathy Smith will release more 40 minute cardio workouts as she has with her excellent Functional Fat Burning step workout. All things considered, I still think this menopause workout is worth purchasing. The cardio is great and the other sections are as well, I've just preferred a few other tapes she's made more. Kathy is the best!",1017792000,48,2362,4.58628841607565
1628072,5,B00005N5UE,"It's a great fun workout, the video is divided into 3 parts, areobics is fun, easy, but you get an excellent workout, part 2 strenght training also very good (if you like an intense total every part of your body this won't be enough). Yoga I don't do so I skip this part, the abs part is very good also. It also gives alot of tips for hotflashes.",1013472000,10,346,4.102941176470588
1628073,5,B00005N5UE,"Kathy Smith has always been an inspiration to me, but even moreso now.  This video has good, solid, useable information about peri-menopause and menopause and what to expect and how to cope.  Kathy's be-kind-to-yourself approach to fitness is comforting.  Her two assistants on the tape help as well because they seem like normal people, not super-bods.  The 20-minute segments make up a very good 60-minute workout, or you can break them up and do them separately.  Each 20-minute workout is good in and of itself.  I also appreciate the discussion at the end of the tape with the health care professionals who also dispel myths and give advice.  It's definitely money well spent.",1011225600,32,681,4.9734513274336285
1628074,5,B00005N5UE,"I purchased this DVD b/c it is a DVD.  I don't know why workouts keep coming out on VHS and rarely on DVD.  So, that said, I received this dvd today and did the 3 part workout: cardio, strength training & yoga.  Each section has an overview before you begin, Kathy lets the viewer know why it's important for the body while going through menopause.  She gives the cues before the moves, the moves weren't very difficult, thus, finally a workout I could do!  The cardio workout was medium-level, I was breathing intensely but certainly not huffing & puffing.  I thought the cardio was perfect.  It's only 20 minutes, so it would be great on a quick-workout day.  If you want a longer one, I suppose you could do the workout twice.  During the workout, Kathy voices over every now & then with little bits of info on menopause, such as ""did you take your vitamin E today"" and explains why vitamin E is good during menopause & other such tidbits.  The strength training workout lasted 20 minutes, you need weights & a chair and wasn't too difficult.  One nice thing is that a picture of a person's backside was shown to let you get an even greater knowledge of doing the exercise correctly.  The yoga workout was my least favorite.  I've not done yoga before but it just seemed like stretching to me.  There is a question & answer section for a doctor on menopause, and a group discussion.  Both informative.  I'm not going through menopause, I'm too young!  I just wanted to be able to buy a moderate-level cardio workout on dvd that I could do, that wasn't so choreographed & jumpy that I couldn't keep up.  This is it.  Although I'd rather see Kathy's ""Step Workout"" (the best workout!) on dvd, this one is a decent substitute until something better comes out.  So bottom line, a nice overall workout on DVD and it gives lots of nutritional advice & menopause information.  Just don't be put off by ""menopause"" if you're too young and not even thinking about it.  It's still a good, decent workout.",1008892800,63,1997,4.535014005602241
1628075,5,B00005N5UE,"I'm so impressed with this video that I have also ordered the book. I recommend it to every woman near or over 40. We are the most fortunate generation of women to have access to this much help to deal with the health concerns of our lives. I own a library of Kathy Smith videos that I've collected over the years. They have all been hours of fun exercise and helpful tips for good health, which has improved the quality of my life. Once again Kathy has released just what we needed to reach our fitness goals and improve our health. This time the focus is on improving the quality of life through mid-life and beyond. I am so thankful for all the work she's done but this program in particular is outstanding.",1008806400,41,710,4.345864661654136
1628083,5,B00005N5UE,This is the 3rd Kathy Smith DVD that I've bought and I love them all.  I like the variation and the intensity of the work out.  A must have!,1141862400,3,140,3.793103448275862
1628084,1,B00005N5UE,"well I guess I'm the odd one out as I really, really dislike this DVD. I love aerobics. in my search to find an aerobics DVD I bought ""Moving Through Menopause"" based on the other reviews on this site.

my complaints settle around the aerobics part of this DVD, but that is what I bought it for. the workout starts at a ridiculously fast speed with no actual warm up. the choreography is horrible! it manages to be boring, while at the same time having you jump around like a jackrabbit on crack. several times through the work out, when it's mentioned that a lower level of activity can be followed, the shot pans the woman doing the highest level. the rhythm and enjoyment of motivating yet fluid moves which I look to aerobics for is fairly absent in this workout. the focus on balance during the cool down is interesting and of worth. but that's the only thing I have to praise about the aerobics section of this DVD.

the presentation is flat. a workout DVD may not need to be a fashion show, but there should be some spark. after all, if it's any good the consumer will be doing it hundreds of times during their ownership of it. nothing in this presentation had that kind of spark. the most menopausal thing in this DVD is the women's attire. which may be a small thing, but combined with the rest is worth mentioning.

I gave this DVD a solid try. I've done the aerobics workout several times in the last 6 months and just keep deepening my dislike for it.",1141257600,12,1464,4.375
1628085,5,B00005N5UE,"My only regret is that I let this video sit for six months after buying it in the throes of misery:  hot flashes, night sweats, etc.  After finding a progesterone cream and some other supplements that helped, I forgot the video. Come wintertime and weather precluding daily walks, I finally got the video out with an apprehensive groan. Couldn't have been more wrong. Kathy makes movement fun and even inspirational. The workouts help me in ways that walking, much as I love it, cannot. So far I just do the cardio & yoga portions. The cardio makes me feel strong and energized. The yoga is so welcome - I love the stretching & the help with relaxation. Kathy's humble, folksy approach suggests she may have studied with someone like the wonderful Lilias. The only problem I have is the need to fast forward from the cardio to the yoga segments. Kathy talks about different menopausal issues and tips in between. It would have been better if the workout segments were together. Maybe next time?",1137628800,7,994,4.706896551724138
1628086,5,B00005N5UE,"I like working out at home.  Kathy Smith does an excellent job with this DVD.  It has many features, I can customize my workout each day.  She is professional, I can follow her and feel like I got a decent workout when I am done.  Also you get a lot for the money.",1120694400,3,264,3.9245283018867925
1628087,5,B00005N5UE,"Some reviews suggest that the moves aren't for beginners - I disagree.  If you could do all of the moves right away, what challenge would there be in that?  When I first tried the cardio workout, I laughed and imagined my horror if I was trying to do the routine in a gym full of people.  These moves aren't overly complicated.  Stick with it, and soon your confidence will grow as you are able to do first one move with Kathy and then another.  There are easy ways to take the level down during the routine and Kathy points them out. Today I did all but one sequence and know that I'll be doing that last one just as soon as my body finally accepts that it must do my bidding!  The cardio workout is low-impact.  My 42-year old knees complain a bit but only a bit.  Already in decent cardo shape from a year of walking and light weights, I use the 20-minute cardio workout on this DVD as a supplement to my other workouts.  The weight and yoga sections of the DVD are also excellent.  Kathy is a terrific coach - lovely and upbeat but never grating in a high-pitched cheerleader sort of way.  I highly recommend this DVD for anyone just starting back into fitness or as another tool for those days when you want some ""extra"" calorie burning and heart pumping fun.",1114473600,7,1264,4.313559322033898
1628088,5,B00005N5UE,"This is a very good workout for anyone who wants some intensity without the joint strain.  Kathy combines yoga, strength training, and cardio activities into an easy to follow and effective workout.  There is even an option to do the workout with music only (minus the verbal instructions).  As usual, Kathy manages this without sappy pep talk found in other workout programs.",1111622400,4,376,5.032258064516129
1628089,4,B00005N5UE,"I worked out to Kathy Smith tapes regularly for a long time. That was before I let myself go 5 years ago and gained 35 awful pounds.  Now, just starting out all over again at the age of 42, I could not keep up with the different types of steps being changed in this DVD and would have preferred it if she had stuck to a fewer number of moves a little longer, rather than having so many to learn/change so rapidly. I began cheating and just doing my favorties over and over before becoming too frustrated and stopping altogether.

I would recommend the Sansone ""Walking Away the Pounds"" DVD's for those (like me) who are very out of shape and just starting out again. It has a lot of basic steps repeated, with varying arm movements to get your heart pumping and body conditioned for the more moderate DVD's like this one.

However - I gave it 4 stars because of the menopausal informative sections and the great yoga section.  Also, because I WILL someday again be able to keep up with her.  But for the time being, this DVD is just too much.",1097280000,20,1042,4.323076923076923
1628090,5,B00005N5UE,"Wow, what a workout!  I've recently re-started my workout program and wanted something up-to-date and this DVD really delivers.  I'm in my forties, a bit overweight and don't like to do alot of jumping so this program is just right.  It has different intensity levels so you can work at your level of fitness, has a cardio, weight training and yoga section plus offers some helpful hints for getting through menopause.  The routine is interesting but not complicated and works both upper and lower body.  The chapter list allows you to choose where to start; each section is only 20 minutes so you can divide the routine if you're crunched for time or do the whole thing when you're not. I also like the real women Kathy has working out along side her, no fitness babes here!!!  The equipment is minimal; just some weights, a towel, and a mat or towel for the floor work.  I'm left sweaty, and worked out from head to toe but feeling energized and like I just did something great for my body, my health, and myself!!",1086048000,12,1016,4.549450549450549
1628091,5,B00005N5UE,"I was very impressed by this tape; both the exercise routines & the informational sections. If one's in a rush & wants to do the routines, obviously, skip the talk, but one should take the time at some point to listen to the informational sections...they're informative, important, & may provide many answers to those experiencing, or those who will experience menopause. The aerobic, weight, & yoga routines are again, great for beginner to advanced. Beginners or ""time savers"" can split the apprx. 20 min. each routines. If you have the time & are in shape, go for the gold! K.S.'s routines can be tailored from beginner to advanced. The informative tidbidts regarding health tips, etc. interspliced between & within the routines are inspiring, rather than annoying, & make sense. One feels great about working out, & if you are experiencing ""peri"" or full menopause, this is an excellent tape that will make you feel better about yourself both physically & mentally. I would certainly recommend this particular workout to either one's K.S. workout library, or one's exercise workout library in general.",1085961600,8,1105,5.110497237569061
1628092,5,B00005N5UE,"I'm really out of shape, though was very athletic in my youth (I'm now 57 years old).  As a recent birthday gift to myself, I bought 6 fitness videotapes from Amazon, and this was the second I put on.  And now that I met it, I'm not even going to bother to try the others until I'm really tired of this one.  Kathy Smith is wonderful -- intelligent but not schoolmarmy (as the first tape was)and challenging but not out of reach.  Kathy runs you through the beginner level and then proceeds to advanced level, but encourages the beginners to carry on at their level until they're (we're) ready to move on.  I don't like getting interrupted every 20 minutes for a health lecture, but I just fast forward to the next segment.  I like doing two 20-minute workouts (cardio and weights+bones), which just fits my schedule.  I'm writing this to encourage myself to stick with it, but if anyone can keep me conscientious, it's this excellent tape.  I strongly recommend it.",1066262400,11,966,4.575581395348837
7946146,5,B00005N5UE,"This is a GREAT DVD from way back, that is easy for a 65 year-old-woman like me who wants to keep moving. It's easy to learn and she gives three different ways to do the routines, with an older woman demonstrating on one side of her and a younger woman demonstrating on the other side. So, if you can't bend your knees into a squatting position, she shows you an alternative to keep moving and get through the DVD.There are also sections so you can trade off or do them all. Some are dancing moves, some are stretching moves, etc. I really enjoy this one.",1463529600,2,555,4.295238095238095
7946147,4,B00005N5UE,"I like Kathy Smith and I have been using her videos since the early 90s.  I always found her to be straight and to the point.  I don't like flash and a fashion show when I exercise, but someone who knows what she is talking about and really knows how to do a workout.  She is that type of instructor.  I let myself go for 4 years now an going through Menopause, so this tape was great for getting me back in shape.  It took a while to be able to do the cardio portion without becoming winded.  I know Kathy sometimes doesn't always start slow before picking up the pace, so I always stretch prior to jumping in to her routines.  But I like her style and have followed her for years and like her more than other trainers. She has helped me get back in shape and now I use this tape for my light workouts. It is worth having in your collection.",1423267200,,842,4.066666666666666
7946148,5,B00005N5UE,Who doesn't have twenty minutes to improve their physical and mental health? This DVD is not complicated or impossible. It's another fun Kathy Smith workout.,1412121600,,157,5.32
7946149,2,B00005N5UE,"I wished I had known the content of this dvd before I opened it. It is disjointed and difficult to get motivated to do the cardio portion.
I was hoping for a less complicated workout. Most of these exercise steps are leftover from the '80s. If I had known.... well.
And now I will have to resell.",1404259200,,296,4.2105263157894735
7946150,2,B00005N5UE,"I was in reasonably good shape, doing regular workouts with Kathy, but this video even at the beginning wore me out.  I was so disappointed because I believed she could help the ""older me"" as she had the younger.  It's on the shelf.",1386979200,,232,4.372093023255814
7946151,4,B00005N5UE,"This dvd is simple and low-key, but don't be fooled: you'll get a pretty good workout. I was actually in the middle of the second workout when I realized how sore my legs were getting. I think I might have to skip tomorrow as a result. But this will definitely be part of my rotation. The educational information mixed throughout the workout was a pleasant surprise, with a moment or two where I just couldn't help but giggle. It's a pretty good beginner-to-intermediate workout; and the yoga workout is especially a definite plus for stress relief after a long day.",1357516800,3,566,4.67
7946152,5,B00005N5UE,"This is the perfect movie for women who want a little exercise to stay fit without getting hurt. It is great for that. I bought it for my mother who is about 50. She's always been skinny, but never has worked out. She was started to get some belly fat, but didn't want a workout routine that would hurt or really push her too much. She does this 4 times a week and says it's perfect.",1316995200,,383,4.052631578947368
7946153,3,B00005N5UE,"I like this DVD Kathy has some good information about Menopause,
but I've been working out for awhile and it really isn't challenging
enough for me.  I use it on my days I really shouldn't be doing
weights because I've used one of my other challenging DVD's and I
should be giving my muscles a rest so I then do this one just for
some workout that day.  I really like Jackie Warner's workouts
and Kelly Coffey Meyer they are more my spead it just depends how
much of a workout you want.  This one is easy to follow.",1296691200,,515,4.181818181818182
7946154,5,B00005N5UE,"I was very plesantly surprised by this video and I learned a lot about peri-menopause and menopause itself, what to eat, what to do to help relieve symptoms, etc... it's extremely detailed and friendly.

The 3 workout segments are basic and short at 20 min. each - I liked the strenght workout the best. These shorter milder workouts are good for a day when I feel tired but want to do something good for my body.

Well done Kathy and thank you for talking about menopause!",1153785600,3,473,4.488372093023256
7946155,5,B00005N5UE,"I used to be neutral about Kathy Smith but this DVD really exceeded my expectations.  I bought it initially thinking anything I learned about hormonal imbalance and perimenopause from this would be useful, and I thought even a one time viewing would make it worth my while.  I was pleasantly surprised, and only wish I'd bought it back in my 30's!  It's packed with a wealth of information.  So much so, the DVD version is more practical so you can choose what parts to view on various days rather than having to fast forward through areas.

My favourite parts of this DVD are the comprehensive informational segments, tips, and interviews with various health experts, as well as the restorative yoga which feels absolutely wonderful and is terrific even for low energy days.  The benefits of the yoga postures are explained as you do them, which I found really helpful.  And the length of the practice is perfect - finally a yoga routine I actually can fit into a busy day!  I also like the setting, which is a pretty indoor set with Asian accents.

The cardio part I don't use as much as I prefer slightly more gentle cardio such as Leslie Sansone's indoor walking videos.  I have yet to do the pilates and strength portions, but on preview thought they looked really good and look forward to trying them this weekend.

For her presentation, comprehensive information and yoga segments alone, this DVD is well worth the price.  Kudos to Kathy Smith for doing such a great job and getting the right people together to get this much needed information out there!",1143849600,6,1562,4.702205882352941
