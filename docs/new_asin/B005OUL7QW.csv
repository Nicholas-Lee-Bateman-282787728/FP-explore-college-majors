4854862,4,B005OUL7QW,"I purchases these for a niece and nephew. Or really, I purchases them so that my sister and brother-in-law could have hours of peace from the backseat when they take road trips. This is one show the two kids agree on.  And it is SOOOOO many episodes. Great value for the money.",1370044800,,277,4.326923076923077

4854865,5,B005OUL7QW,This gets play pretty much every day or at least some disc in the Clifford series does. Recommended viewing for toddlers. Especially ones that love dogs!,1360627200,,153,4.923076923076923
4854866,5,B005OUL7QW,"We used to watch Clifford on PBS once the kids woke from their naps, but the time slot for the show has been changed. These are exactly the same classic episodes and now we can choose what ones to watch. Only difference is the speckle stories are in a separate area to watch so instead of them having 30min. straight you have to ""pick"" the two stories and a speckle one during that time.",1359417600,2,387,4.243243243243243
4854867,5,B005OUL7QW,This DVD has several episodes.  This was truly a very economic purchase.  A child can sit for quite some time and be entertained.,1359158400,,129,4.565217391304348

4854902,1,B005OUL7QW,"Sad to say, we're having the same issue as the other 1 star reviewer had. Sadly, I'm pretty sure we're past the return period. I'm mostly disappointed for our kids. They love the show and get really sad when it won't play. (Sounds like a silly thing, but we shouldn't have to deal with it. The same problem exists on one of the Care Bears Collection DVDs.)",1393977600,,356,4.3283582089552235
4854903,4,B005OUL7QW,"I purchased this for my3 year old grandson for Christmas because we can't find Clifford on tv anymore. It arrived on time and in great condition except for one thing. The first dvd in the case did not work at all, just a black screen. This is the one where Clifford gets picked by EmilyElizabeth I believe. I didn't want to deal with returning the whole set and disappointing my grandson so I called and they gave me a partial refund with no problems.we would rather have the dvd but oh well. Still wish I hadn't agreed to the refund as my grandson would like the full set I'm sure.",1389571200,,582,4.3
4854904,5,B005OUL7QW,Our little 2 yr old loves these DVDs immensely -had to buy a second set for backup as she pulls them out and carries the disk to whoever is nearby to load for her!  Great clean classic entertainment for little ones.,1388880000,,215,4.2439024390243905

4854908,5,B005OUL7QW,My 2 year old son is really into Clifford right now.  We love this box set.  It has 6 DVD's that have multiple episodes on them.  We were exactly sure what to expect since the product description didn't say much other than there were 6 DVD's.  It has been a great addition to our collection.  I would recommend this to other little Clifford fans.,1370476800,,346,4.34375
