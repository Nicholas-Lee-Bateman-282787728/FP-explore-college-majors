6936636,4,B00RYZFSZ6,"Blake Edwards perhaps can be better appreciated now in hindsight than ten or twenty years ago.  He came from the World War 2 generation and had a few more standard 'service comedies' under his belt, such as 'Mister Cory' and 'Operation Petticoat'.  But in this film he creates a meta-comedy about life in the war-time army, where everybody - the soldiers, the civilians, and even most of the enemy - only want to party and have a good time, and the real villains are the squares who insist on keeping to the official plan.  Being a Blake Edwards film, you can expect a few things: a great ensemble cast (including Dick Shawn, James Coburn, Sergio Fantoni, Aldo Ray, Harry Morgan and Carol O'Connor), a couple of huge and funny party scenes (no one in history did party scenes like Blake Edwards), some old fashion bedroom farce / door slamming comedy, plot twists flying left and right, and non-stop craziness.
This movie has the best starring role ever for Dick Shawn, a personal favorite who was usually used in much smaller doses.  But even Aldo Ray shines in this, as do most of the smaller parts such as Jay Novello as the Mayor or Leon Askin as the horny Nazi.  Everybody keeps switching sides as the farce builds and Edwards builds gags up for the entire length of the film.  This movie must have been a huge influence on 'Kelly's Heroes' since Carol O'Connor plays essentially the same role in both films, but he gets more to do in this one.
Not a perfect film, but a joyful romp that manages to be anti-war just as America was ramping up in Vietnam.  I highly recommend this to fans of Blake Edwards (this may sport his biggest cast ever).",1430784000,5,1648,4.5286195286195285

6936639,5,B00RYZFSZ6,"Kudos for Olive Films! This is one of my all time favorite James Coburn (Lieutenant Christian) movies simply because its pure fun to watch. I am going to give away my age but I went to the theater to see this movie growing up. When they tried to transfer the movie to the small scene they failed to include the subtitles. Scotti Vito (a real class act) is speaking his native tongue regarding the catacombs. If someone who never watched the movie will not get any sense out of the movie with a lack of subtitles. How are you going to know who is calling who a smuck! Scotti plays one of the bank robbers climbing around the tunnels dug under the town. If you don't speak Italian their scenes make no sense, especially when Harry Morgan (Major Pott which is ironic when he later became Colonel Potter in MASH) gets lost in the catacombs minus a few marbles along the way to qualify as a Section Eight.  Back in the day the subtitles were in white. Olive takes up the readability a notch by doing the subtitles in yellow. A great improvement! Its the way a war should be run. Taking coffee breaks in the middle of a fake battle! One big party with wine, women, and song! Dick Shawn was cast in the perfect part for his acting ability as Captain Lionel Cash (a by the book officer who slowly loses control of the situation and his sanity), Carroll OConner plays the normal role as the general (somebody call him Max!), Aldo Ray the rough tough Sergeant Rizzo, Jay Novello plays the Mayor, Sergio Fantoni as Captain Oppo (the greatest shot in the Italian Army!) and the list goes on of lovable character actors we always enjoyed growing up. Where else can you have the Italian Army not surrendering until you through them a party other than a Blake Edwards movie! Break out the popcorn, its movie night!",1428451200,12,1799,4.451515151515151
8696366,5,B00RYZFSZ6,"EXCELLENT blu-ray picture quality, just beautiful.  Especially for a 1966 film-- just sharp, colorful, and clean.

Funny film with some fine actors, notably James Coburn, Dick Shawn, Harry Morgan, and Carroll O'Connor.  If you haven't seen this, it's one for your WWII collection for sure.",1515974400,,289,5.377777777777778
8696367,5,B00RYZFSZ6,"A by-the-book Captain is ordered to capture a strategic village in Italy. The Italian soldiers are willing to surrender if the can have a festival first. The lieutenant (Coburn) convinces the Captain (Shawn) ""Wake Me When It's Over (1960) this is the only way.

Because of aerial reconnaissance they must look like they are fighting. To sort this out an intelligence officer, Potter (Morgan) is sent in and gets lost in the catacombs singing ""Peas pottage hot"". Mean while the festival gets complicated with the Mayors daughter.
