591774,5,6303198619,"Simon is a wise and healing ascetic who stands on top of a pillar in the desert. He shouts out his prayers, amusingly at times. On one occasion he starts a prayer, and then half way through says, ""I forgot the rest"". He also cures people. He gives a handless thief some new hands, the thief's wife then says, ""Now you can do the gardening"", and the man announces, ""I can now spank my son"". Some of the scenes reminded me of Monty Python's Life of Brian. Throughout the film Simon is visited, and tempted by Satan, who masquerades as a beautiful blonde woman. She entices Simon, and he repudiates her. The film draws to an outlandish and abrupt conclusion, probably because the funding dried up. A very funny and irreverent poke at religion from Buuel.",969494400,6,751,4.529411764705882
591775,5,6303198619,"""Simon Of The Desert"" is a brilliant parable that attacks religious fanatics head on. It was the last Mexican film by Luis Bunuel and he left that country with a blast, presenting an original and intelligent  dark comedy that dissects the blindness and misguidance of religious  fanaticism. Bunuel keeps the viewer gripped here soley on the script,  characters and performances. Silvia Pinal is devilishly entertaining (and  sexy) as the devil and the actor who plays Simon does an incredibly good  job. ""Simon Of The Desert"" clearly understands the mind of the  religiously-obsessed, who become so blind they come to think that they know  everything about what is holy and may even come to think that they are at  one with God. Bunuel's script is always alive in the dialogue and  situations, he adds neat little touches of dark comedy. The dark comedy  here is done with the wit of a master because you really don't notice it,  you see it as a part of the story. The movie may look simple, but it is  extremely complex. Like most of Bunuel's films, ""Simon Of The  Desert"" provokes thinking and questions. It is highly intelligent  because it raises issues. ""Simon Of The Desert"" is one of Luis  Bunuel's best Mexican films along ""Los Olvidados"" and ""The  Criminal Life Of Archibaldo De La Cruz."" The ending is also quite  hilarious and surprising. It is fitting that this was his last Mexican  film, because it showed he was ready to go back to Europe to continue his  line of masterpieces with works like ""Belle De Jour"" and  ""That Obscure Object Of Desire."" ""Simon Of Desert"" is  well-thought, performed and assembled. A great film.",964224000,2,1636,4.792114695340501

591890,5,6303198619,"Moving pictures merely repeat what we have been told for centuries by novels and plays. Thus, a marvelous instrument for the expression of poetry and dreams (the subconscious world) is reduced to the role of simple REPEATER of stories expressed by other art forms""-Luis Buuel.

Simon of the Desert (1965) was Buuel's final Mexican film before moving to France. His Mexican period is often considered a repository of ""anti-religious"" films, although a more apt description might be ""anti-ecclesiastical.""  This 45-minute pilgrimage is an incomplete work (due to haphazard funding), but even in its truncated state, it is a shockingly substantial work.

The ascetic fifteenth century Saint Simon Stylites (Claudio Brook) has spent his life atop a pillar in order to get closer to God. A wealthy patron has an even larger pillar built for the holy man and so, after six years, six months, and six days, Simon, reluctantly, comes down from atop his ivory tower, albeit briefly, to ""move up"" in the world. Detached irony abounds. As in Nazarin, Buuel presents a religious figure as a fool, but a stubbornly determined fool to be identified with and admired, with detachment.

Kurt Vonnegut once wrote an amusing observation about Christ and the Lazarus story. In his take on the narrative, Vonnegut imagined that, Lazarus' resurrection, it was the recent corpse, not Christ, who became the celebrity with the crowd. Leave it for the masses to look at the wrong end of a miracle every time. But, what Vonnegut was expressing was the inevitable chasm between prophet and audience.

Buuel also emphasizes contrasts. Simon's audience does not desire holiness. They  crave tinseled parody only because they do not know the difference. A handless man is resorted and immediately begins using his hand to slap an inquisitive child. Bunuel's integrity and convictions astutely critique, not the faith itself, but the contemporary adherents to the faith, who, with their short attention spans, pedestrian tastes, poverties of intelligence and of aesthetics, are rendered consumers of spectacle as sacrament. Bunuel's shift from the religious to the bourgeoisie was a natural development, seen flowering here.

The devil is, naturally, a woman, and Silvia Pinal agreeably fleshes her out.  She takes turns as a Catholic school girl, an androgynous messiah who performs a Janet Jackson-style wardrobe malfunction for the unfazed celibate, and finally as a mini-skirted Peter Pan, whisking Saint Wendy away from his Tower of Babel to a modern discotheque.

As with all of late Bunuel, he is no mere repeater of old narratives here. As St. Luis (and only a seasoned saint could be this irreverent), he spins a new parable, one that is organically textured and startling in its improvised finale. Bunuel was no hypocrite, and the unexpected loss of cash flow inspired a quixotic bleakness and an unequaled sense of purpose.

591891,2,6303198619,"The movie Simon of the desert is one of the strangest films I have ever seen. With the plot surrounding a ""pious"" man who lives on top of a pillar for years at a time, the plot is sure to get a little odd. I would not say that I particularly enjoyed this film because I don't think it was very sophisticated, but I could not help watching it because it was so weird. One of the most memorable parts, for me, was when a young girl comes and tries to seduce Simon. She walks up to him singing a song and continues to try to seduce him. Then suddenly she turns into an old woman. It was things like this throughout the film that were somewhat disturbing but interesting nonetheless. Another scene has the same actress that played the young girl and old woman. She is talking to Simon, atop his pillar, and trying to tempt him. Suddenly she kicks a goat which goes flying off screen. These oddities in the film left me wondering and kept my interest. The film goes on like this with strange things happening and by the end of it, the audience finds Simon and the woman in a wild club with people dancing to hip `60's music. After seeing this film, I really did not know what to think. It felt like the filmmakers used cheap humor to spice up a generally weird film that would not otherwise draw a large audience. Though parts of the film were pretty funny, like the scene where a man is healed and given back him formerly amputated arm only to slap his wife, overall, I would not really want to watch this film again. I would not necessarily recommend it as a quality film, but it is definitely interesting.",1305072000,,1603,4.293729372937293
591892,3,6303198619,"Simon of the Desert is a hilariously gripping Mexican film. This short forty-two minute film grabs the audience's attention with humor and an outlandish plot. This film is a great intro to Bunuel's film canon, as it centers on a man living atop of a column for six years in the middle of a desert. Simon prays for purification and is hilariously taunted and tempted by numerous people. A woman who I take to be Satan visits Simon three or four times and constantly tries to make Simon come down from the column. Perhaps one of the most memorable scenes is the scene in which people dance to `60s rock and are deemed indecent. This film is hilarious as it showcases an airplane flying overhead towards the end of the film. Bunuel greatly addresses social concerns of the 60s in terms of a very liberal society, a very open-minded society; with that he juxtaposes religion and morals. This film is very interesting and it leaves the viewers questioning and interested. The incorporation of temptation is interesting as Bunuel plays with what society deems as right and wrong. After viewing this film I wanted to watch other Bunuel films. It's so interesting, to me, that this film was made in the 60s and yet appears to have been made many years before. The acting, plot, script and cinematography make this film truly an original. I highly recommend this film to any and all who enjoy a good art film. The cinematography of this film is just beautiful and the film at times feels like a biopic. I would go so far as to say that Bunuel consciously involves the audience in that he initiates a dialogue between the screen and the audience, asking them to reflect on their own lives. This is one of the most interesting films I've seen. It's a great film and one that is in need of close study and discussion!",1304899200,,1805,4.574074074074074

A master surrealist, Bunuel places numerous moments of humor in his character's dialogue and situations. The devil shows up periodically to tempt Simon off his pillar in the form of a young woman, but Simon is steadfast in his devotion. The ending comes out of nowhere and I have yet to honestly figure it out (the movie was truncated due to loss of funding), though explanations of it range from a visual allegory for the end times to a trip through time to a modern day Simon, who sitting at his table and refusing to dance, is still metaphorically on his pillar.

591895,5,6303198619,"Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, the world renown Spanish director who had a successful career in Mexico and France is known for films such as ""Belle de Jour"", ""Viridiana"", ""Nazarin"", ""El angel exterminador"" (a.k.a. The Exterminating Angel) to name a few.  But what Bu&ntilde;uel is known for was his quickness of his filmmaking and ability to transcend from working in Mexican and French cinema, but also his dark humor and the fact that he is an atheist and is critical of religion.

One film that he uses religion to showcase his critical view to religion was the 1965 film ""Simon of the Desert"" which was the third film starring actress Silvia Pinal (""Viridiana"", ""The Exterminating Angel"") and Claudio Brook.  And produced by Gustavo Alatriste, husband of Pinal.

""Simon of the Desert"" is a dark comedy parodying Saint Simeon Stylites, the Christian ascetic saint who lived for 37 years on top of a platform in Syria.

In the film, Simon (played by Claudio Brook) has been living on top of the platform for six years, six months and six days.  Simon prays for God to spiritually purify him and it has become his mission to stay on top of the platform giving his life to God.  A congregation of priests are proud of what Simon had accomplish that they have built him a larger platform for which he can live, while supplying him with water and lettuce (which he prefers to only eat).  Simon's mother has also taken refuge near the base of the platform in order to be there for her son.

But Satan (played by Silvia Pinal) will do whatever he can to prevent Simon from accomplishing his mission and making him come down the platform.  The devil takes the disguise of a woman who sings and tries to use her body as a way to get him to stop.  The devil also uses a disguise of Jesus Christ in order to get him to stop.  The devil also possesses one of the priests in order to make Simon look like a fraud in front of the other priests.

But who will win in the end...Simon or Satan?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Simon in the Desert"" is presented in black and white (1:33:1 aspect ratio). According to The Criterion Collection, the picture has been slightly windowboxed to ensure that the maximum image is visible on all monitors.  Picture quality is actually very good for a film created back in 1965.  Blacks are nice and deep and Criterion gave the film a solid high-definition transfer.  The transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a 35mm duplicate negative and thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Restoration system.

I personally didn't see any major artifacting and the scratches and dust are so minimal that Criterion did a fantastic job on the video transfer.

As for the audio, audio is presented in mono.  According to Criterion, the soundtrack was mastered at 24-Bit from the 35mm optical soundtrack negative.  Pops, crackle, hiss and hum were reduced with an array of audio restoration techniques.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Simon of the Desert"" comes with the following special features:

  * A Mexican Bu&ntilde;uel -  (55:41) A 1997 documentary produced by Emilio Maill&eacute;.  Maill&eacute; goes into detail of the life of Luis Bu&ntilde;uel as he lived in the United States and then moving to Mexico and eventually the filming of ""Simon of the Desert"" and a tribute made for him.
  * Silvia Pinal - (6:39) An interview with Silvia Pinal recorded in Mexico City in January 2006 exclusively for the Criterion Collection.  The actress talks about her working relationship with Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and working on this film.
  * 28-Page Booklet - Featuring an essay by Michael Wood titled ""Damned if you do..."" about ""Simon in the Desert"" plus an interview excerpted from ""Objects of Desire: Conversations with Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, a compilation of interviews conducted by film critics Jose de la Colina and Tomas Perez between 1975 and 1977.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Simon of the Desert"" is a film that features very good cinematography. May it be from a far distance as you can see Simon standing on the high platform (yes, they actually created an actual stone platform that is still in the field today and can't be removed because it's so heavy) or closeups of the character's face.  Criterion's transfer is quite solid as you see the detail of Simon's hair waving in the distance and Bu&ntilde;uel was good in capturing just a little of Pinal's sexiness and not overdoing the temptation bit.

I have no doubt that this film was probably considered blasphemous at the time, in fact, Bu&ntilde;uel's first film with Pinal ""Viridiana"" riled up the Vatican that he had to seek exile in Mexico.  But that was part of Bu&ntilde;uel's perspective on religion.  He was an atheist at heart and took liberty of poking fun on Christianity.  Why would a man give up his whole life for a God that is really not doing anything?  I suppose Bu&ntilde;uel looked at Simon's worship as a waste of time and a waste of life and if anything, Bu&ntilde;uel was known to have debates and conversations with priests who were his friends on the subject of religion.

If there was one scene that stays in my mind, it's a scene where a family begs for Simon to ask God for his help.  A man who was caught stealing had his hands cut off and the family begs forgiveness and sure enough, after prayer, the man receives his hands.  And the first thing the man does after leaving is swatting his kid right in the head.

Aside from Bu&ntilde;uel's athiest view on religion, probably the most jarring part about the the film is that it would never be fully completed as producer Alatriste was unable to financially support the making of the film as the golden age of Mexico has come to its end.  So, in order to have some finality with the film, Bu&ntilde;uel came up with an ending which may or may not leave viewers satisfied but both Bu&ntilde;uel and Pinal have been vocal that they wished the film could have been fully completed and that the ending would have been different.

So, at 45-minutes long, ""Simon of the Desert"" is a low-tier Criterion release of an uncompleted film.  But do not let that deter you from this purchase because the film is still quite entertaining and I actually found it quite fascinating, even to its ending scene that was a bit awkward but at the same time, it was very 1965 and definitely an interesting moment of the film that just sticks out.  I found it to be quite fun although I really would love to know how Bu&ntilde;uel would have ended the film?

Overall, this is a solid release and for the lower-tier Criterion titles, this one comes with worthy special features and insightful and informative booklet.  You really get a bang for your buck as the special features and the accompanying 28-page booklet along with the film is well worth the price (especially when this DVD is on sale which I picked up for under $13).

If you are a Luis Bu&ntilde;uel fan or wanting a Criterion title that is low in price but yet big enough in content, ""Simon of the Desert"" is definitely worth having in your Criterion collection.  Recommended!",1258934400,,7105,4.7046925566343045

The Exterminating Angel ($39.95; Criterion) is one of the surreal provocateur's most accessible works, the amusingly scathing (as opposed to tiresomely scathing, which is where I often find Bunuel resides) look at the upper class by showing a dinner party where the guests simply can't leave. It's like a Voltaire take on Twilight Zone, with this simple premise taken to its logical extreme. The film looks great and extras include a substantial documentary from 2008 featuring arguably the greatest screenwriter (and certainly the greatest adapter) of all time, Jean-Claude Carriere among others, plus some other new interviews. But that's one of his most famous titles. Who but Criterion would also put out Simon Of The Desert ($24.95; Criterion),a 45 minute short about a prophet who camps out on a pillar for six years, six months and six days to show his devotion to G-d only to be sorely tempted by the devil.

591931,5,6303198619,"In perhaps his most overtly anti-religious-institution film, Luis Bunuel depicts a holy man who decides to live an ascetic life atop a column in the Mexican desert.  The story was inspired by the story of Simeon Stylites, a Syrian saint who allegedly spent 37 years living atop a pillar.  In Bunuel's story, Simon (Claudio Brook) finds himself tempted by Satan, who appears to him as a luscious blonde woman (Silvia Pinal).  Even though Simon performs miracles, the local priests are largely unimpressed and try to use him for their own purposes.  The movie incorporates elements of Bunuel's trademark surrealism, particularly in the wild ending.

With a runtime of just over 45 minutes, ""Simon of the Desert"" falls somewhere between a feature length and a short film, resulting in a lean movie.  The movie was originally intended to be part of a trio of shorts, and Federico Fellini and Jules Dassin were approached to direct the other two segments.  However, they apparently wanted to use their own muses (Fellini was married to Giulietta Masina and Jules Dassin would later marry Melina Mercouri) instead of long-time Bunuel collaborator Silvia Pinal, who balked at this arrangement.

The humor is most definitely anti-religion, especially anti-Catholic, so viewers should beware.  I'm not a fan in general of movies that explore religious themes, but Bunuel keeps it light and funny here, even when viciously skewering his subjects.  Although Bunuel had made several other anti-Catholic films in Mexico (e.g., ""Viridiana""), ""Simon of the Desert"" was extremely controversial and effectively ended Bunuel's career in Mexico.  Bunuel would then move his movie making to France, starting with the masterpiece ""Belle de Jour.""

The DVD includes two extras: an outstanding documentary delineating Bunuel's filmmaking in Mexico and a short interview with Silvia Pinal.  At 55 minutes, the documentary on Bunuel's Mexico phase of his career is actually longer than the movie it accompanies!",1242086400,,1986,5.306709265175719

But it offers his classic take on religious hypocrisies in a brisk 45 minutes.  The reaction when Simon produces his first miracle especially is one of the great moments in film.  (Really, there are so many wonderful small Bunuelian touches.  His take on the ""priesthood"" is hilarious.)  I could go on, but it's 45 minutes, just watch the damn thing!

591933,5,6303198619,"Forty-four years ago, Luis Buuel (1900-1983), the Spanish film maestro still living in self-imposed Mexican exile from Franco's rule, directed what was to become his most famous work of surrealism.

Buuel's last Mexican film, ""Simon of the Desert"" (Simon del Desierto), was originally intended to be a full-length feature film, but was cut short - literally - when the promised funding evaporated.  With about 40 minutes of scripted material in the can, Buuel radically altered the ending.  A change that ensured the movie's well-deserved acclaim.

Simon is based on Symeon the Stylite, also known as the Hermit of the Pillar (around 400 A.D.). He was one of the many ascetics who sought salvation by isolation and deprivation after the fall of the Roman Empire.  Simon chose to live atop a column, dependent on the good will of strangers for bread and water.

Like much of Buuel's work, ""Simon of the Desert"" is considered blasphemous by some.  The ""enfante terrible of surrealism,"" a name Buuel  loved being called, depicts a bearded, bedraggled Simon (a terrific Claudio Brook) atop his pillar for six years, six months, six days (uh oh, 666), when the devil periodically appears (a la sensuous Sylvia Pinal) and taunts him, hoping he will climb down.

 ""Thank God I'm still an atheist,"" Buuel was often quoted as saying.  But he was educated by Jesuits and steeped in religious myth, ritual and culture.  His mockery of organized religion is often inspired (no pun intended). Perhaps now more than ever as we are engaged in a global conversation regarding the effects religious fundamentalism  and fanaticism.

""Simon of the Desert"" comes to an abrupt and improvised ending that reminds me of the best of Rod Serling's ""Twilight Zone"" scripts.  Deeply moral and ironic, it's a jolting time-warp leap that gives new meaning to the emptiness of the post-modern age, the banality of evil and the superficiality of pop culture.

The new, restored, high-definition digital transfer is, as with all Criterion titles, as good as possible.  Extras include A Mexican Buuel  an 56 minute 1997 documentary and a new interview with actress Sylvia Pinal.  An included booklet features a new essay by Michael Wood and a vintage interview with Buuel.

For the serious collector of world cinema landmarks, this is one for the digital library.

591934,4,6303198619,There is much interesting and I found goodness in the picture.  The character Simon is wonderfully played.  He is taken away by the temptingly beautiful Satan to a sixties rock nightclub. Even though seated at a table it is as if he is still on the column in the desert.  He is still aloof from the surrounding world.  How interesting it is though we do not see him look up to heaven and pray to God while in the club.  While the director may be mocking the mysticism of Christianity in the end he has embraced it for all the clutter of the world has certainly effected good Simon as he is not speaking with God by prayer.  As for the Dr.'s review who says that Simon is smoking a cigarette in the club the Dr. better watch the movie again.  Simon is smoking a pipe.  A truly more gentlemanly way of enjoying the bad habit of smoking. All in all the coarseness of the other characters did not bother me but emphasized the goodness and holiness of Simon.  It is interesting that Satan is portrayed as a seductive woman. An echo of the blame on Eve perhaps? As far a blasphemies ... isn't that one other thing Satan is good at?  Enjoy the movie and learn.  Withdraw and pray in secret to God.  Thank you.,1216857600,,1202,4.269911504424779

We will pass the allusions to Jesus and his forty days in the desert. We will pass the hypocrisy of all those who come to the foot of the column to get the force Simon is supposed to conquer by his personal sacrifice that does not cost much to these hypocrites. The morbidity of this long description of years in the desert and temptations from Satan are finally ridiculed by projecting this ascetic monster into the younger generation of 1965 dancing the twist or some other crazy dance. He is the one who sits at a table, smokes his cigarette but does not dance. In other words he is the Fool who will never get the Fun and will Fancy he is Free and Famous if not Funny whereas he is nothing but F***D up.

591937,5,6303198619,"In an ancient, arid wasteland, the anchorite Simon stands day and night atop a giant pillar, scourging himself, rejecting his mother and surviving on a sustenance diet.  The poor of the area come to him seeking bleassings and miracles; the religious elders gain spiritual balm from his example.  Simon thinks himself unworthy to take holy orders, and is plagued not only by begrudgers who try to prove his hypocrisy, but by his own inner doubts, fears and distractions.  The chief of these latter are the temptations of the Devil, who comes to see him three times.  At first she is dressed in a sailor suit and suspenders; next as a lamb-kicking Jesus; and finally in a mobile coffin.
Bunuel is usually, simplistically characterised as an anti-clerical or anti-bourgeois satirist, but this is to miss the ambivalence behind a statement such as 'Thank God I'm an atheist'.  From the opening scene, Simon is compromised - he breaks his vigil to accept the gift of a wealthy benefactor.  His miraculous abilities don't change a barbarously unjust world in  which robbers' hands are lopped off, and the religious hierarchy have the murderous powers of the Inquistion.  His miracles don't transform the souls of those he helps, instead amplifying their material self-interest.  As MacHeath suggested 'Food is the first thing, morals follow on'.  There are doubts about Simon's integrity, the extremity of which is often comical, and which is powerless against the sexual petulance of the Devil.
Nevertheless, this very human frailty and hopelessness makes this lisping, Hispanic Charlton Heston quite sympathetic - he does have suernatural powers, which he uses for the good; and he is quicker to forgive than those in religious authority.  The framing of Simon against the sky constantly cuts him off from the desert world and community he looks down on, but he achieves, on occasion, an ecstasy they have no access to.
'Simon' is one of Bunuel's funniest and most perfect films, bursting with memorable scenes, such as the dwarf eulogising his goat's teats to an innocent young priest; the frothing exorcism of a hypocritical elder; or the dream-memories Simon has his former, youthful life.  The silent onlooking of his mother on the margins gives the film a melancholy, while the slow, steady camera moves towards Simon are appropriately dizzying.  Although this comic look at relgious fervour anticipates the irreverance of Monty Python's 'Life Of Brian', Bunuel never breaks the integrity of his world, never gives his characters a modern consciousness, is faithful to the look, smells, emptiness and sounds of the desert (crunching sand, whistling winds, bleating animals, bells etc.) and its people.",1015804800,17,2702,5.169724770642202

In lesser hands, the allegory would have seemed silly and cheap, but Bunuel actually has something to say and sets the stage very naturally for the audience to accept that everything may not be exactly as it seems.  It's best to watch without reading any plot summary of theory on what it all means.  It's up to you to decide.  Is this something that has never happened before in human history?  Has it happened hundreds of times?  Why did it happen to Simon in particular?  Was it a product of his behavior or his destiny from the very beginning?  Only God knows.",1463788800,,676,4.483606557377049
7840595,5,6303198619,"A beautifully shot, gently satiric, and often quite funny 45 min film of a man named Simon, who stands alone atop a column, day after day, year after year trying to please God with his ascetic sacrifice.  Meanwhile members of the Church come and go, trying to use Simon to their own ends.  Poor peasants come, receive miracle cures, and then start to smack their children and leave without even a thanks.  And finally the devil herself comes in various guises to try to tempt Simon off his tower in various odd, humorous and often quite modern ways.

Ever the atheist, Bunuel doesnt really make fun of Simon, in fact he seems to hold him with a combination of respect and pity.  Respect for his strength, pity because he can never really win, and is simply torturing himself to no real end..  Bunuel seems to be drawing a sharp line between faith and religion' --  faith is seen as a noble fool's errand, religion as a truly corrupting evil.

For a surrealist film, this is actually quite naturalistic in terms of the acting and many of the images.  And that works well.  The ending is quite odd, and was tacked on by Bunuel when he ran out of money, but the bizzare twist actually works, even if it is a bit more obvious than the movie that preceded it.

(mild spoilers ahead)

In the end, Simon could stand up there forever, but the world, with its lusts and selfishness will continue on, and I think Bunuel sees that as both good and bad.  The pleasures of the flesh aren't in themselves evil.  Its mans inability not to be cruel and violent thats the real problem -- and thats no more dealt with by standing alone on a column in the desert 2000 years ago, then by dancing the night away at a disco in modern day.  But at least the dancing is fun.

(end spoilers)

Some critics see this as Bunuel's greatest masterpiece, his purest expression of his deepest ideas.  Im not quite there, at least on 1st viewing, but Im not far away either.

Criterion's transfer is terrific, and while I'd love to see this beautifully shot film get a blu-ray release this excellent DVD will certainly do.",1462060800,,2089,4.464379947229552

Some of the images are truly disturbing, as Satan tempts him with hot flesh and through possessing a priest. The film is a short and it feels incomplete, as it ends on a bizarre scene that takes Simon from his pillar in the desert to a swanky nightclub. I read the filmmaker ran out of money to make a longer version of the film, and that's too bad. The film with some more content could have been truly superb.",1422057600,,540,4.152380952380953
7840599,4,6303198619,"I have been a admirer of Luis Bunuel films since the 1970s. this is probably in my top five of all his films. Simon is a saintly figure who lives a top a pillar in the desert. He is newly moved to an even higher pillar where he is exalted by local people looking to him for guidance and miracles. A man with no hands prays to Simon for new hands. Simon prays to the lord, and suddenly the guy has hands. As soon as he gets his miracle hands, he proceeds to shove his children around. Piety in a world of retched people seems to  be a Bunuel theme. Simon is tempted by the devil who appears in the form of a voluptuous woman played by Silvia Pinal (one of Bunuel's favorite actresses). Guess what?the devil eventually brings Simon down to earth, and the present. Only Silvia Pinal could pull it off.
When I saw this in a theater, the subtitles were almost unreadable because they were white on a B&W film. The new tiles are yellow with black edges and standout against the rest of the film. This is a short film, but other extra features including cast interviews are included to make this a full night of entertainment. Recommended to fans of Bunuel and black comedy and satire.",1410307200,2,1178,4.330316742081448
