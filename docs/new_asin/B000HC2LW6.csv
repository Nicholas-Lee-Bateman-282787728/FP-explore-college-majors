My fiance' and I do not watch (or even have) TV, and this is a wonderful addition to our evening entertainment.",1238716800,2,152,4.428571428571429
8138206,4,B000HC2LW6,"This is the BBC version of the same miniseries which was on PBS' Nature fifteen years ago. The American version, made for PBS' noncommercial format, was hosted and narrated by George Page and was about eight hours long on VHS.  This version is a total of only about 6 1/2 hours, which is why I couldn't give it a five star rating. The additional footage would have added so much more to the DVD set. There is also no bonus material about how this remarkable series was made.

However, I am very happy that this series is finally available on DVD. The programs are so enjoyable with their beautiful photogaphy, and the history is really interesting, especially of the Indians and the pioneers and their relationship to wildlife and the natural world. Nothing like this had been done on television before or since. This will make a unique addition to your nature/wildlife DVD collection if you love American history and wildlife.",1163635200,22,927,4.751552795031056
