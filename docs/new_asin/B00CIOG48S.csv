8582116,5,B00CIOG48S,Got this as a gift for Xmas...it's pretty cool. If you are a collector you will enjoy it.,1420156800,,89,4.0
8582117,1,B00CIOG48S,VERY disappointed. It was a gift for my son and it was made to look like something never before seen stuff. Well he has everything you could possibly imagine on AC/DC and really nothing new on here. He also thought it was terrible. What a total waste of money!,1377907200,9,260,4.326530612244898
8582118,1,B00CIOG48S,"This DVD/CD collection is misleading at best and a flat-out rip-off at worst!  The DVD contains early AC DC interviews which are mostly available on the Web, and the CD is a repackaging of pre-ACDC Bon Scott tunes, perhaps of archival interest, but having nothing to do with AC DC.  I feel robbed!!",1374883200,11,298,4.60377358490566
8582119,1,B00CIOG48S,Don't buy this!!  The DVD movie is only a couple of interviews that can readily be viewed on Youtube.  There are songs that you don't need to hear Bon sing - pre ACDC stuff.  I can't believe the false advertising for this item.,1374105600,17,227,4.232558139534884
