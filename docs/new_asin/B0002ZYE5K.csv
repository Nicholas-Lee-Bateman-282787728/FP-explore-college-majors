8035446,3,B0002ZYE5K,"Well, this may be one Steckler's best, and if it is I'm steering clear of the rest, but the movie is cheaply made and populated by a lot of non-actors acting in it.  Liz Renay was interviewed about it and she said ""Oh, THAT thing.""  I must say the DVD itself (Shriek Show) is very good quality.  Otherwise ... give it a skip.",1384041600,,325,4.126984126984127
8035447,5,B0002ZYE5K,"The Thrill Killers (1965) is one of the best, most original and highly influencial exploitation-horror films, ever. The quality of the film is really impressive! Excellent direction by Ray Dennis Steckler with tremendous camera work, full of invetive shots! The superb black and white photography is amongst the best i have ever seen, even compared to big budget films!! This is not a low budget movie, no way! The production seems to be ten times higher than any film that i have seen from Something Weird. The nice widescreen presentation also helps to appreciate and enjoy the film better. The transfer is not perfect, but the weaknesses add a grindhouse experience! A 60's cult Classic. Buy the box set which includes this film in its own regular case!",1369267200,,756,4.9140625
8035448,5,B0002ZYE5K,Awesome movie! one of ray dennis steckler's best movie's...i think this one and Incredibly Strange creatures. are his 2 best films period..highly recommended.,1365724800,2,158,5.913043478260869
