8662368,1,B00KX1UGX2,This dvd seems home made. I am disappointed at the quality and the length of the video. I love Randy Travis but this was a waste of money.,1434844800,2,138,3.9642857142857144
8662369,1,B00KX1UGX2,Do not buy this! A total rip-off! Poor quality sound and video clips. No interviews. Not as described!,1434326400,2,102,4.722222222222222
8662370,2,B00KX1UGX2,"The title of this dvd is really misleading.  This is not a documentary, it is just 10 concert clips of Randy's songs.  There are no ""rare interviews"" or ""in his own words"" other than Randy saying a few words before the song in Carlsbad Caverns,  Some of the video quality is really low.  Without the Tammy Wynette and George Jones songs, I would have given this dvd 1 star.",1434240000,3,373,4.36231884057971
