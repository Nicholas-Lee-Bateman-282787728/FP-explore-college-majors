8062871,1,B0009LIYKS,"I purchased this ""film"" for one reason:  The presence among its cast of Brooke Mills, once one of the more beautiful models in the ranks of those used by Peter Gowland, glamour photographer.  Ms. Mills, for all her gorgeousness, couldn't do anything at all to redeem this hopeless, cretinous, insulting, profoundly depressing piece of worm-ridden trash.  This slime-flick exploits rape, and makes it seem almost trivial. It has no real intelligence, continuity or charm of any kind. It disturbs, disgusts and darkens your day.  I will never take a chance on buying or renting anything from this nasty little genre again.",1305849600,3,620,5.108910891089109
