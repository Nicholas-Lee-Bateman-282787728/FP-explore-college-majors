213985,1,6300151484,"This DVD is NOT an official release. It is a full screen, video to DVD transfer and a terrible one at that. The tape the company used looks like a worn rental tape complete with tracking errors and audio crackling here and there.

Do NOT purchase this DVD, you will be overpaying for what basically is a bootleg.

By the way, the 1 star rating is NOT for the film itself - it is just for this release. Don't get duped into paying $30 for what bootleggers have been selling - with better quality tapes/cover art - for years. It's a rip off and it's downright criminal.",1312070400,30,567,4.289719626168225
213986,5,6300151484,First off this will be a review of the movie and not the DVD. This is a excellent zombie movie. Way better than I expected. The zombies look great. The makeup is perfect. No blue faced undead here. Ok one of them is but I kinda liked that too. Reminded me of blue frosting. Anyways the zombies are somewhat different than in other movies I've seen. They have almost a human element to them. They interact with each other and they have a sense of humor. The special effects were done well also. The scene with the iron was great. The washing machine scene was good too. Simple but what's left to the imagination is what makes the scene. If anything in this film is weak its the dreadful main characters. The brother and sister duo of Jeff and Zoe made me really root for the zombies. The girl next door April isn't much better. She's an idiot but super hot. Like 1986 hot. So I can't say anything for the DVD release since I watched it on the epix channel. For the price that the third party seller that amazon has fulfilled I probably never will see the DVD version of this film but I hope it contains everything I saw on tv.,1311379200,9,1125,4.261682242990654
213987,5,6300151484,"The Video Dead is a fun zombie movie from the 80's. It's a lot like Night of the Creeps and Return of the Living Dead, so if you liked either of them, you should like this as well. Not as much gore as I expected, but just as fun.",1292457600,,229,3.693877551020408

213989,2,6300151484,"The Video Dead (Robert Scott, 1987)

Somewhat surprisingly, The Video Dead is not the dumbest movie I've seen this month. In fact, it's not even the dumbest movie I've seen all day, though it was in the running for quite a while. Once you've been immersed in this mess long enough, however, if you're old enough--forty or so, old enough to have been in high school when it appeared--it develops of sort of nostalgic, if masochist, charm. It really is that dumb, and it transcends dumb into a sort of odd cheesy glory.

We open with a reclusive man getting a TV delivered. No word on why, as he's as confused as we are. Cut to that night, and a horrible scream. Fast forward three months, and a family is moving into the same house--well, actually, the advance guard of the family, consisting of college student Zoe Blair (Roxanna Augesen, who according to IMDB appeared onscreen only this once) and her high school aged brother Jeff (Rocky Duvall, who likewise never appeared onscreen again). While poking around in the house, Jeff discovers the TV from the first scene in the attic and brings it downstairs. Cue ominous music. We soon find out what happened to the guy from the first scene, as the TV, when activated, spews zombies. Yes, folks, zombies come out of the TV. While they didn't leave the house during the opening scene, they soon find themselves wandering around the neighborhood, killing the neighbors in amusing ways, while brother and sister try and figure out how to stay alive.

If you've seen a few late eighties horror movies solidly in the B realm, you've probably got an idea of what to expect here. Really silly humor, average-at-best special effects, a script that attempts to tug at the heartstrings (and most often fails), but, especially when compared to today's microbudget horror movies, competent acting, direction, and especially lighting. No parts that aren't too dark to see. Hallelujah! Of course, there's not a great deal here you couldn't miss, but it's still kind of fun if you remember it from back in the day, or movies like it. **",1228608000,2,2071,4.747222222222222
213990,4,6300151484,"Though an amateur film,this one is funny ,creative and just fun. It is not to be watched if looking for a serious zombie gore flick as you'll be dissapointed..",1197417600,,159,4.517241379310345
213991,4,6300151484,"I seen this movie a long time ago when I was younger and honestly I'm not ashamed to admit that I couldn't sleep with a TV in my room for a long time after watching it. Yes the acting is bad and yes the story is crap, but its all just plain old zombie fun. I recommend this to anyone who loves zombie movies regardless of acting and story. Watch it and then tell me if you can sleep in your house alone, with the TV in your room...",1189987200,,431,3.853932584269663
213992,1,6300151484,"This is one of those movies you use as a bookend, or maybe put under the leg of a wobbly table. If you come across this one, whatever you do with it, don't watch it. You'll regret it.

The bad acting at the beginning of the film tips you off to the crap that will follow. A man gets an unwanted TV in the mail. It won't turn off, even when he unplugs it, and the only thing it plays is a movie called ""Zombie Blood Massacre."" The zombies climb out of the TV and kill the guy.

Later, another family moves into the house. The parents are out of the country, so it's just the teenage son and daughter. The son discovers the TV, brings it to his room, and some weird naked chick comes out of it. I might mention that the zombie makeup is terrible, and while they don't talk, they're very cartoonish and have a really bad sense of humor.

Well the next time the Texan comes to visit, the boy lets him in. He tells a really ludicrous story about the ""video dead"" who believe they're still alive and get really angry when they see themselves in a mirror. So the way to convince them they're dead is to kill them like you would a person. Which lead to an almost-laughable scene where they're shooting zombies with bows and arrows. [groan]

Avoid this piece of zombie fodder at all costs. I don't know what the writer was thinking, or if he was thinking at all, when he wrote this. Boo!",1101945600,5,1378,4.188679245283019
213993,1,6300151484,"There's a magical T.V. that only plays zombie flicks. Some goober finds it and falls in love with a chick who looks like a man from the zombie movie. Then zombies arise from the t.v. to choke the living (not eat). So the goober, a cowboy, and some chicks must lure the zombies back in the T.V. set.
Do not even bother with this film. It's the most dumbest film i have ever seen. So bad that I rather be watching ZOMBIE RAMPAGE. It's an insult to zombie films everywhere.

7803903,5,6300151484,Everyone knows it's a lil cheezy... It's an old B movie Zombie flick! Half the people that gave this movie high reviews is because it brings back good old memories and at least for me it does!!  But it does have some other good qualities too!!.. it has some good Zombie make up and some decent settings like in the woods! Bringing back an old feeling from an old good memory is what counts the most!! ,1520553600,,401,4.2631578947368425
7803904,1,6300151484,"What drugs are other reviewers on who give this movie a positive rating? Apart from make-up effects on some of the zombies, which is just passable as OK, there is nothing positive to say about this movie. It has horrible acting, a stupid plot, plot-holes, makes little to no sense, and has a terrible resolve. It was like watching a horribly made porn movie with no nudity! At least the porno stars don't care if their acting is horrendous, so whats the excuse for the actors in this film?

The plot is stupid. A TV set allows zombies to come through and murder people. Now they've killed the first owner of the house, their after the next owner. Genius, right? It doesn't get any better.

Did I watch the same movie as others here? Or is their a low IQ convention in town who adore this film? Who can possibly stand the horrible acting in this thing? The terrible direction of zombies and a an overall predictable and stupid outcome.

Save your money, your time and your IQ, and don't bother with this one.",1489190400,,1007,4.461956521739131

To me compared to a lot of cheap cheesy zombie movies the video dead is one of the better movies with the walking dead and the thing that makes it different then the rest is they come out of a old television... The whole film i found to be Hilarious, the music was eerie to and makes the parts scary when you think of it as humor it really shows you the fear in it. Im so glad that after so many years of wanting this movie just to have the privilege of watching it i picked it out when i did back in 2007. I only watch on special accessions only....",1452124800,,673,3.8840579710144927
7803907,2,6300151484,"When you see that the two lead actors have never appeared in another movie, you should know exactly what kind of experience you're in for.

Unlike some of the other reviewers here, I won't recap the entire plot.  Why would you want to watch the film if you already know everything that's going to happen?  Suffice it to say that the plot is actually the best part of the movie.  It jumps into the main storyline quickly, drives forward at a steady clip, and mostly adheres to its own internal logic (although -- mild spoiler -- I still don't know how a character killed the first non-deformed zombie within the evil television's own realm).  But while the storyline was a highlight, there were numerous and significant problems with the film.

The acting is abysmal, to the point of unintentional hilarity.  The way the male protagonist tried to run away from the female zombie near the end of the film is worthy of its own specialized drinking game.  The film was clearly made on a micro-budget, although the settings and the zombie makeup were, for the most part, pretty solid.  The rest of the special effects, especially ones involving death scenes, were pretty bad.  I believe there were five major zombies depicted in the film, and one of the main male zombies was clearly depicted by a different actor in his first appearance than in the end.

Still, if you're a zombie movie junkie, there are some redeeming qualities.  While the first act and the denouement are both totally predictable, everything that happened in between was a total surprise to me.  That's what happens when you make a movie where zombies kill people by choking them, and they die from taking arrows to the torso.  There are even a couple of twists that will make you question your genre savvy.  So even though I gave this film two stars, don't be afraid to give it a try.  Let's face it... we've watched worse.",1421280000,,1890,4.647590361445783
7803908,4,6300151484,"The video dead was a okay zombie film. But you do have to remember that it's from the 80's. And it was a low budget film but i have to admit that they did one heck of a job. Plus this movie was lost like forever and then fangoria reviewed the movie. And now it's starting to get popular while shout factory is bringing out a blu ray release so thats i looked it up on you tube and found it. And you can tell it's from the 80's but my favorite part is when he cut the zombie up with the chainsaw but first he said the Texas chainsaw massacre was his favorite horror film has is mine.,",1411430400,,583,3.907563025210084
7803909,4,6300151484,"As this review is being written we're still attempting to understand exactly what it is that we just watched. To call this movie B would be an understatement of epic proportions as it would fall more into a D grade at best. To some this would be a turnoff, but for us this is a fantastic selling point. We've never strayed from a challenge. We believe this fearless movie viewing was established when we were just kids. That day we stumbled across a VHS copy of Wicked Games in our local video store set the tone for our movie viewing future. Even when the video clerk said ""I don't know if I can rent this out, I don't even know how this got here"" we didn't accept his discouragement. No sir! We forged ahead and watched one of the worst films to ever be created , and we did it with gusto. After that moment we just knew that finding the world's worst B's was going to be a lifetime hobby that's still going strong. We can assure you that if we stumbled across The Video Day all those years ago, it would have been watched with a great amount of laughs and may have even become legendary like a Wicked Games. Now just to be clear, this movie is absolutely horrible in every way possible. However, it is highly enjoyable when you're sporting a nice pair of rose tinted-B movie viewing glasses.

We'll do our best to explain this plot but can't guarantee it will make a whole lot of sense. We open with a couple of delivery men dropping off an unmarked box for some guy who looks like he hasn't seen a shower in a couple weeks. He reluctantly accepts and finds the package contains a tv. The tv turns on by itself and only tunes in to what appears to be a zombie movie. However, this tv is not of this world. Turns out the zombies use it as a portal to come through to our world and they kill the living, starting with un-showered slob. We awkwardly flash forward three weeks as a new family moves into the house. For some reason the parents are not around, but their kids Jeff and Zoe move in without them. These highly challenged actors are our main characters. This was probably the first and last time they got the opportunity to be labeled as ""main characters"" in anything. Jeff stumbles upon this tv in the attic and brings it into his room. Some weird guy with a cowboy hat shows up at the door talking about the evil tv, but Jeff's not buying it. Once the zombies start plowing through the house he reconsiders quickly. Eventually the cowboy reappears and he and Jeff team up to stop the zombie force. For some reason the zombies wander around the woods aimlessly despite knowing exactly where their victims live, so our demented duo hit the woods to stop the chaos. These two are the most incredible duo since Zap Rowsdower and Troy McGregor took the silver screen by storm. Now we're gonna go in there and take this place by storm. The acting between these two is so horrendous that you're brain will barely be able to process what's going on. In fact you'll be rooting for the zombies. These two puds are so useless that they make no progress and wind up being killed by the zombies they were hunting. This leaves Zoe to be the only remaining soul to save the day. She does this by inviting the zombies in the house for dinner and treating them like normal people. I guess they're like bees and won't attack unless they smell fear. When she invites them into the basement for dancing lessons, this actually happened, she gets them to pile back into the tv saving the day for the time being.

If you needed to watch a movie with crater sized pot holes and some of the film industries worst acting, then The Video Dead is an absolute perfect fit. Conceptually the film was fantastic with a pretty solid idea taking place. Having zombies plow through your tv is a situation nobody would want to be involved in. Somehow they managed to take this concept and mess it all up in the end. The movie consisted of about 10 characters total (including the zombies) in which not a sole could act their way out of a paper bag. The poorly spouted lines were a thing a pure hilarity at every turn. It almost appeared as if they were ad libbing, but none of them could be intelligent enough to pull that off.  At no moment will you really know what's going on, but that's the beauty of films like these. Forget a film you don't have to think about. With this one you won't even need to be conscious. Quite possibly the best part is when the cowboy ties Jeff up so he's dangling from some trees as human bait. This is to lure the zombies in while the cowboy picks them off one by one. When the cowboy takes an impromptu nap the zombies just about rip Jeff's legs off while he screams like a 5 years old girl. It is a classic scene that should have won multiple awards if the film academy wasn't so corrupt. We strongly recommend The Video Dead for one of those nights you need a mindless 80's B horror to take away an hour and a half of your life. At no point will it make sense, but you will laugh on way more than one occasion.",1369785600,,5023,4.307610993657505
7803910,3,6300151484,"A mysterious unmarked crate has been delivered to a houseowner as he opens it revealing an ordinary looking TV, it shows a zombie movie on TV yet however it has dark magic to it as it unleashes a magic force that brings the zombies out of the TV to kill the owner. Months later, a new family moves in the same house yet it's only a sister and her brother as he discovers the TV in his room. However, the undead are unleashed in the woods near the house as it starts killing off some neighbors as they must try to find a way to kill them to send them back into the TV.

This 1987 supernatural zombie horror film is typical of the low budget direct to video films of it's day yet it did had a limited theatrical release in some places. It has bad acting, a weak plot and some cheesy make-up yet there is some good dosage of gore like chainsawing, flesh-eating including that creepy nightmare of the Zoe getting her hand eaten off and all that with some nudity like a very sexy lady played by Jennifer Miro who comes out nude to seduce Jeff. This movie does have similarities to the Japanese ""Ringu"" movies but this was made years before that movie and i'm sure this inspired them big time, i remembered renting this movie when it first came out when i was 6 and thought it was decent.

I gotta say it's one of those so bad it's good kind of films that anyone can do home MST3K-ing with and it has never had a DVD release until now on the Video-Dead/Terrorvision double feature blu-ray/DVD combo pack from Scream Factory.",1367798400,,1518,4.285714285714286
