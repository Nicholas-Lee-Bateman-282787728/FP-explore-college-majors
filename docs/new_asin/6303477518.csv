7848588,2,6303477518,"I bought this looking for a skateboarding segment that I recall from MTV Sports. This didn't have it. However, it did have some cool segments from the long lost MTV Sports world. Only 2 stars because it didn't have the skateboarding segment which was a special. I really loved that original segment because it featured skateboarders in the midwest, skating an old refrigerator in a barn. It also featured music from Pennywise, and MXPX, which was awesome. Either way, this wasn't it. It's cool, but it's not the same, 2 stars only.",1442966400,,531,4.782608695652174
7848589,2,6303477518,"In the summer of 1996, MTV aired a regularly programmed show called ""MTV Sports"". Recently, I had unearthed a video tape that had some of the episodes recorded sequentially onto it. For example, one episode featured freefall photographer Joe Jennings training to BASE jump off of Angel Falls. A skating episode featured some hot venues across the country for skateboarding and agressive in-line skating. A snowboarding episode featured 5 people on a to-die-for road trip across the Rockies in an RV. Then, there was the Warped Tour '96 episode, and so on. I was hoping that those elements and their spirit would be the center piece of this video. Instead, all this extreme aficianado got  were snippets of these sports (much like an orphan being fed charitable crumbs). The most prominent feature of this tape was Dan ""The Ham"" Cortese's skit audition for a movie career. If anyone from MTV should happen upon this review, I recommend that you check your archives and re-release the 1996 episodes of ""MTV Sports"" onto video. If they'll put the f-cking ""Real World"" on DVD, then surely they can do the same for ""MTV Sports"". If anything, let Redline Sports Entertainment have the rights to distribute it onto video and DVD. It's just such a waste for that show to go into obscurity. I'm fervently of the view that it could compete on the shelves with all of the extreme sports videos that are being released even today.",1036108800,,1418,4.811475409836065
