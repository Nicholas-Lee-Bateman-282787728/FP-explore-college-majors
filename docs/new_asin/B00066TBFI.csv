8039356,5,B00066TBFI,"I was just sifting through a box of dvds I blind bought at an auction and came across this one. You can totally tell that it is just hot blondes showing cleavage while cleaning. What a joke! I love it. If you are an adult male getting off to this, please do yourself a favor and just buy a frikkin porno man! This is for the 12 year old who just discovered self pleasure and stole this from the local library, hoping his mama doesn't find it (or god forbid catch him in the act). ""Fun to know"" indeed.",1371600000,,501,4.070707070707071
8039357,1,B00066TBFI,"Unbelievable drivel.  I suppose it's possible that there is some human on this planet who, having just arrived from a distant galaxy, might not know how to do a place setting (""Forks and napkins on the left, glass and knife on the right"") or that you should use glass cleaner and paper towels to clean a mirror.  But for the rest of us, there's really nothing meaningful here.

This absence of information is, mercifully, not long nor well-presented.  The DVD has no ""Play Movie"" option and you are constantly left back on the menus to select the next vignette.  Each such segment only lasts a minute or two:  the shortest is 34 seconds; the longest 2 minutes, 11 seconds.  Total run time of the disc is only 19:41, well short of the listed 60 minutes.  As the other commentator noted, the narration is at best laughable; it simply cannot be taken seriously.

I do feel that one of the two actresses did try her best to make what she was doing somewhat useful, but it was a lost cause.  The other actress made little such effort, and her performance is more distractive than demonstrative.

A grudging star for decent production quality and the efforts of that one actress.  This is decidedly not worth the $15.99 (current) sales price, not even close.  You'd be better off spending $15 for a quick chat with a cleaning professional... assuming you truly have to be told to rinse out your sponge.",1191801600,,1396,4.603238866396761
8039358,1,B00066TBFI,"I borrowed this at the library as they were closing & obviously didn't look at it enough. This is for men only.
They only show you a woman using a vacuum on a couch, ceiling, drapes, etc. as if it was a new idea. They also show how to use a furniture polish on a dining room table, how to dust, how to clean a toilet. *Very basic limited cues, not for those actually looking for cleaning tips/secrets*
The difference in why it's for men is that the narrator is a woman with a very sultry voice sounding like she should be on a s*x B-movie. There are only two girls demonstrating & both look like cheap porn stars & act like them, looking at the camera, trying to look at hot as possible while using a toilet brush or vacuuming, licking their lips staring at the camera when they can, flipping their hair, etc.
All I could do was laugh. ""Oohh.... use the vacuum all over the couch, get all those... oohh... crevices.... oohh... use the vacuum on the ceiling... oohh... sponge off those kitchen cabinet handles, you dirty beast, you!"" LOL
I showed it to a male friend of mine for the laughs & though he admitted he liked the eye candy, he found it too silly to watch more then a minute or two.
I accidentally made it 3 stars... maybe it should get 1 star for originality & if it matters, 1 star for decent production quality.",1140998400,6,1323,4.274900398406374
