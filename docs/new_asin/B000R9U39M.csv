8463684,5,B000R9U39M,"These cartoons/animations/video performance art clips are incredible! Multiple artists show their best on this collection. There are 2 main sections to this DVD, ""loops"" and ""shorts"". The ""loops"" section feature video/animation loops, each as far as I can tell about 20 seconds long that display whimsical eye candy that will loop indefinitely. Very trippy! The ""shorts"" section shows amazing stories that fill your imagination.  The one very different selection but one of my personal favorites is ""Whispering Pines"". Showcasing the video performance art of Shana Moulton. While most this DVD isn't child friendly (ie. dark themes ) There are a couple that I think a child could enjoy. Mostly this is an DVD that will be enjoyed and understood best by adults. Ultra hip modern art.",1183075200,,782,5.2063492063492065
