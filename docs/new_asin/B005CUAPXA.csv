8465869,4,B005CUAPXA,"MINOR SPOILERS:

First and foremost, ""Fresh"" stands for Freshman.  IMO, ""Fresh Meat"" would have been a natural extension of the post HS graduate class for the cast of ""The Inbetweeners"".  Case in point, Joe Thomas from IB is one of the stars.

The basic plot revolves around 6-students(5-freshman and an upper class house monitor of sorts) starting their freshman year @ uni (AKA university) that couldn't get into any of the ""halls"" (AKA choice uni housing), thus are relegated to share an off campus house.

The show opens with the first new student arriving, walking into the kitchen to the site of the house monitor blow drying Peking Duck sans pants!

The humor is over the top crude and laced with sexual overtones while still being uniquely English.",1353283200,6,756,4.8671875
