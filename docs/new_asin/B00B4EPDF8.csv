5554568,4,B00B4EPDF8,"Appropriately enough, about the world's most famous Impressionist painter.

While definitely not for those who favor conventionally plotted drama or fast action, RENOIR consists of immediate realism and puts you right there with the Renoir clan on the French Riviera. It's the sort of film that could easily have been made overly artsy and dull, but it's neither.

The entire film takes place in 1915, toward the end of Renoir's life. The relationship between model Andre Heuschling and son Jean Renoir is, in many ways, more the subject of the story than the painter himself, yet Renoir himself is indispensable as ""the boss,"" a sort of god-like backdrop to the entire cast and story. Having said that, I must add that there is a fair amount on Renoir's artistic processes, and his philosophizing can be applied to all sorts of art forms besides painting. One of RENOIR's strongest aspects is its portrayal of a man who is obsessed with his work and has one thing that utterly consumes him.

Like many other French films, RENOIR succeeds in breaking all sorts of rules, among them:

--The plot is meandering and somewhat slice-of-life but still gripping;

--Andre, the ""girl from nowhere,"" and free but neglected youngest son Coco are characters that beg to be developed further, but at the same time, perhaps it's better that they remain mysterious;

--Lots of female nudity without it seeming the least bit gratuitous: After all, the subject is an artist who often painted naked girls;

--The mood is a successful mesh of somberness, poignancy, and (often laugh-out-loud) humor.

Just about every artsy clich could be applied to this film, but suffice it to say that it is a beautiful experience. Even simple colors come alive here for the audience as they did for Renoir himself. I'm a word person who's never been a big painting aficionado, but this film made me see the visual arts in a whole new light and may even have converted me to some extent. The soundtrack--quiet, unobtrusive piano scores in the background--also does a great deal to carry this film.",1377388800,64,2065,4.896848137535817
5554569,4,B00B4EPDF8,"This is a strangely unfocused film about two Renoirs (painter August and filmmaker Jean) and the woman who was something of a muse for both men. But the film can never decide which character and which storyline to explore. At first, it seems this is going to be the young model Andree's story, but other than being nude and free-spirited and inspiring love/lust in each Renoir she meets, we learn very little about her. So, we then assume this is going to be a portrait of the elderly painter (when the film begins he is 74) as seen through the eyes of his young model, but we learn very little about the old painter (other than the fact that he suffers from a debilitating and painful arthritis and that he must be carried to and from his atelier by a group of sturdy female servants who call him ""boss"" and that he lives for the look of light on naked female flesh). About a third of the way through this beautiful but desultory film August's son Jean after being wounded in WWI limps back to the family estate (which sits beautifully on the edge of the sea) and at this point it looks like the film is going to be about Jean's love for Andree but other than a few sensual moments together we learn very little about the connection made between these two. Its only in the afterword of the film, as the credits roll, that we learn that Jean and Andree made several (unsuccessful) silent films together after the war and broke up before Jean became a world famous director. So there is nothing all that compelling going on in this film or anything that seems to add to much -- just a few underdeveloped psychologies and the affect they have on one another for the time that they are together. And yet as soon as you leave the theatre you begin to revisit little bits and pieces. At one point in the film August tells his son Jean that one must not impose structure upon the world but simply float like a cork wherever life takes you ---it would seem that Jean took this advice (one of his most famous films is called The River) but it would also seem that the filmmakers took this advice and decided not to impose a conventional storyline on this slice of Renoir family history. I suppose one could look at this film as a new more honest form of biography/history in that the filmmakers simply offer a series of character impressions without insisting that any single one amounts to more than it does -- and I am inclined to think this is what this film is trying to do. So my first impression (that this film is unfocused, unstructured and slight) is slowly giving way to a second one (that life is unfocused, unstructured, and slight).",1376265600,3,2637,4.42798353909465

One of his sons is in the military and returns to recuperate at home from a bad injury to his leg.  He and the young model fall in love.

5554627,3,B00B4EPDF8,"As others have said, including those who like it that way and those who dont, this film is very slow moving. Yes, the photography is fine, though its mostly of the same scene. Yes, theres lots of nudity, but anyone familiar with the paintings of Renoir can hardly be surprised at that. What bothered me, though it may well be accurate, is the acceptance of domestic tyranny by the old artist, presumably on the principle that artists can do anything they like with impunity because, you know, they're artists. There is also a sad mood underpinning the whole, especially the situation of the young boy, which borders on child abuse, indeed today would constitute child abuse. The music, which isn't bad and isn't too prominent, enhances the sense of sadness, of ennui, though it also tries to imbue the whole with an elegiac overlay. All in all, despite the good acting, the beautiful scenery, and the pretty naked girls, we didn't really enjoy this film and turned it off around half way through. After all, we watch films for enjoyment  we met our distribution requirements many years ago  and this film was not enjoyable.",1482105600,3,1123,4.783505154639175

Too much time was focused on the Boss, the elder Renoir, who seemed rigid and one dimensional, and not enough attention to his relationship with the other people in his life.  At the end of the film I wondered if the Boss had any capacity for love of anything but painting.  The love affair between his son and his model, Andree, left me with many questions.  Both sons' characters merited more in-depth development.  Many of the scenes were  beautiful, however, and this was the film's redemption, in my opinion.",1477872000,,557,4.872340425531915

5554691,4,B00B4EPDF8,"Just as the trailer says, this is the story of the events in the summer of 1915, when Jean Renoir returns to the estate of his father, the world famous painter, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and meets Andre, his father's favorite model. Jean, is there to recover from wounds sustained in the still raging WWI. The movie is fictional in that the dialogue and the daily events of that brief time had to be created to try to give understanding to how Andre went from being the muse of the famous painter during the war, to the muse of his son, who became a world famous movie director after the war.

The basic movie (story, screenplay, acting) is average. But, the reason that I give it 4 stars overall is the cinematography of Mark Piz Bing Lee. Visually, this is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever watched. Every scene is meticulously set up, and bursting with the pastel colors used by the elder Renoir at the time. It was as if Mr Lee had channeled Jean Renoir to show how Pierre-Auguste Renoir viewed his world. In fact, I loved the cinematography so much that on my second watching of the movie, I muted the sound and just watched this beautiful movie in silence.

It is amazing that during a few weeks in the summer of 1915 a young women could emerge as the muse of a father and of his son, in 2 different art forms. But, that is what this movie is about... that transition. Be sure to read the dialogue at the end of the movie to know exactly what she did, and what became of her, and of the 2 artists that she so inspired.

5554707,4,B00B4EPDF8,"Pierre-Auguste Renoir, in his last days, is still at work, as the film presents him in this period piece. His hands are now ravaged by arthritis. This is not a personality guy-- not colorful, wise, endearing or simpatico.  Some of his behavior may have to do with his age and chronic pain, but the man we meet here is egocentric (not a rarity in some celebrated artists) and rather flat. The French countryside he inhabits is exquisitely beautiful. It shimmers and glitters in the sunlight, much like the Impressionist paintings for which he is beginning to be celebrated in his later years. He is, and this is the quirkiest and likely most offensive piece, surrounded mostly by his former models, whom he has bedded down and had children with. Some nurse and raise his children, others prepare his food and nurse him. If this is so, it is an important aspect of his history. Andree, a beautiful redhead, appears on the scene to become one of his last models. His handsome wounded son Jean returns from WWI to pair off with Andree. I'm definitely oversimplifying , but it's not a complex movie. It's good enough, though sort of a long moment in time.  The cinematography is brilliant, creating wonderful atmosphere. Tarkovsky, the great Russian director, believed of good filmmaking, that one could cut any piece of film and have a still fit for framing.  For succeeding in that, I praise and recommend this film.",1475366400,3,1413,4.782786885245901

Did you know that this movie was shot in film? What did I just said? It was not shot in HD it was shot with tones and tones of film stock.
The year was 2012 and they used film!
And the visual was just stunning to look at.
And then the Renoir the late period when he was already way old. He just wanted to draw picture of naked women. He wanted to draw a true beauty of the most beautiful thing in earth.
The most beautiful thing? Yes the woman is the most beautiful thing in this cruel dirty world. No one can deny that.
And then came along this beautiful young woman Christa Thret (LOL). She was just breatheless to look at. The beautiful body and cheerful personality eveyone will fall in love with.

Even his young boy falls in love with her deeply and finally has deep relationship with her. But then again he cannot beat her old old father who had at least thousand women in his life.
He was a soldier and couldn't deny the fact that the old man is not having sex with her or anything but ant that time it was more of a spiritual connection with painting with her clothes all off. The moment when she was posing in front of him was more then having sex.
He saw that.
That was why he went back to the war even if there was zero reason he should.
Then there were two of them left what will be happen next?

The movie is just so beautiful and the nude scenes are nothing to do with sexuality or make you arouse your apetite related to your fantasy something to do with your dirty laundry tissue thing.

As I mentioned before it was shot in film and it was not able for me to upconvert into HDMI and not look like HD image and more like analgue.
It was great that way. And old fashioned film style just great to look at.

The Renoir acted by Michel Bouquet sometimes was bearfaced sometimes humorous sometimes I mean at all times charming old dude.

The lady Christa Thret a girl to be loved with this beautiful rounded body let's say B cub sized breast just so artistic body pure work of god's figure.
It is just canvast if you just put the frame into her no need to shot or draw at all.

The guy who is in love with her Vincent Rottiers who has this deep dreamy eyes a poet himself no one can deny his beauty of youngness.

This movie deserves a better grade from imdb although it is more of a worldy rather then I donno Terrence Malick like holly.

5554736,5,B00B4EPDF8,"A beautiful and inspiring film.  I love the Impressionist paintings and always feel in awe of the creativity it took Renoir and Monet and the others to step out from the traditional styles.  This movie really beautifully shows so many insights into Renoir, how his incredible passion kept him going even as his body was failing and was in pain.  At one point in the movie his son Jean suggests maybe it is time to quit painting because he is so feeble and in pain.  And the elder Renoir replies something like, ""Pain will eventually pass, but beauty always continues on.""

First off, after watching the movie, I got online to find out more about it.  Much of the movie was written relying on the biography written by Renoir's son, Jean Renoir.  So it was written much of it was based on intimate knowledge of the great painter.  But the story itself is as much about the son Jean Renoir and his own struggles growing up with a father who is obsessed with is art, and also it is a story about the beautiful young lady Andree who is final model for Renoir, who inspires him in his last paintings.  She is a magnificent young woman, who is struggling on in her own right and wants to be an artist one day.  So you see this journey of the elder great painter, still inspired and driven to create.  You see his son who is a wonderful young man, awed by his father, yet struggling to find his own path.  And you see Andree who is passionate in her own right and trying to find her own voice.  And you see the sweetest of Jean and Andree discovering inspiration in each other.  They are all flawed and there are parts of all three characters which you don't like and yet you also love in many ways.  And the most inspiring thing to realize is that in real life, Jean and Andree went on to get married and make movies together.  Jean became a brilliant creator of movies, an artist in his own write, but uniquely different from his great father.  Andree became an actress starring in his movies.  Later in life their stories change, but the point is this movie, ""Renoir"" is a beautiful, haunting tale, and cinematically it so beautifully shot that it is almost like stepping into a Renoir painting.",1438819200,4,2190,4.418952618453865

5554749,5,B00B4EPDF8,"""Renoir""(2012) is directed by Gilles Bourdos. The movie is about the Impressionist artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and his last model Andree Heusching, also known as Catherine Hessling, during World War 1. This wonderfully slow paced film feels like a breath of fresh air bathed in sunshine and the beautiful environments of Renoir's house in the south of France overlooking the coast with its breathtaking views and lush forests. Watching this film is like taking a holiday. Its relaxed atmosphere takes us through some of the daily routines of Renoir's life as he paints and ruminates to those around him about what motivates him. Andree was his muse for the last series of paintings in his bathing cycle of paintings which he was to complete despite his frail health. His son, Jean Renoir, the future great director of French cinema becomes romantically involved with Andree, who would become his first wife and act in several of his early films after World War 1. Interestingly Gilles Bourdos used the services of a convicted art forger to re-create in live action the paintings of Pierre-Auguste Renoir. This film shows us in a believable and realistic manner how Renoir, the artist, was able to nurture his passionate and optimistic craving for life right to the end.",1430524800,,1271,5.028436018957346

If you pay attention to it, the style of Renoir's style of impressionistic painting was a metaphor for the whole backdrop of the movie and plot--so to speak. Renoir's style is more ""go with the flow"" and do not sweat the details. In contrast to that, his son's life was more structured and more tied into the whole political situation at the time.

5554780,3,B00B4EPDF8,"It's worth watching this oddly frustrating film, if only for the five star performance, as Renoir pre, by Michel Bouquet, one of the greatest French living actors. An old man himself, Bouquet retains total mastery of his craft, and shows the inner life of the nearly-immobilized painter through the slightest and subtlest of gestures. He deserves a prize for this role, in my view.

The rest of it has its moments: effective photography of the Provencal light and landscape is generally a pleasure to watch.

The character of Catherine/Andre, Renoir pre's last model, and first wife of his son Jean, is a problem for me. Historically, the persona is probably accurately drawn. The movie Catherine is physically attractive, somewhat cheap and vulgar, probably promiscuous, somewhat manipulative and ambitious, and without recognizable talent or distinguishing qualities of soul -- all this can be glimpsed in the actual silent films Jean made of the ""real"" Catherine -- and yet both father and son are in love with her. Then why isn't she more magnetic? My personal issue is that the Catherine character is onscreen a great deal of the time, both clothed and unclothed, but that, unlike Pierre and Jean  I failed to get very interested in her. Well, there is one scene, in which  she paints lipstick on Jean before stimulating him, that does generate a little spark...the rest, meh.  We are also led to believe or infer, via some mute and signifigant looks,  that Jean had previously been initiated into the mysteries of s*x by the previous model, Gabrielle.

Much of Renoir pre's spoken commentary on life and art is drawn, if my memory is accurate, from Jean's excellent book, ""Renoir mon pre.""  There is clearly an attempt here to make a ""serious"" film. If there were half stars on Amazon I would give this a 3.5.",1416960000,,1815,4.8892508143322475

I have sat practically frozen, in awe. Although a real movie with real people in it it looks and feels like a continuous painting, a work of art in constant motion. The actor's clothes are chosen to melt into the backgrounds, the folds in the skirts and blouses are as if painted on canvas with the stunning colors and shadows. The hats and the flowing hair so perfectly chosen as if deliberately like an artist would. Yet, at the same time everything feels so natural, so un-rehearsed. Nature jumps out from the screen and becomes part of your living room.....the streams, the trees and flowers....the accompanying music.
Amid all this there is a very interesting and educational story with Renoir most certainly the center of attention. Typically French, the body, whether naked or dressed is sensuous and beautiful....never offensive and in this movie also a feast for the eyes. For lack of any other word I'd like to end this commentary with the word  ""LUXURY"" as in luscious!!!.",1413158400,,1157,4.611650485436893

The film is superficial, it does not go deeply into biographical details of the main characters other than remarked disagreements both have on each other over most everything, this I did not know; I found Renoir's house to be the most attractive component in the film, although there is no descriptive photography of the house as a whole, only partial interior shots.

The property appears to be 20 to 40 acres in the south of France bordering on the Mediterranean and on exquisite natural surroundings, how
tantalizing is that?

The movie is watchable, but not absorbing or highly interesting, a lot of important information and turning points on the lives of these characters are either unbeknownst to the writers and director, or just simply neglected.",1411430400,,1024,4.873563218390805

5554808,4,B00B4EPDF8,"Beautifully photographed, the images manage to catch the essence of Renoir's use of color and light. In a way cinematographer Mark Ping Bing Lee is the real star of this film, creating an atmosphere that tells us more about the characters, and the Renoir's art than all the dialogue combined. (blu-ray is definitely recommended).

I also loved the performance by Michel Bouquet - in his 80s as the film was shot -as the slowly dying Renoir, battling to continue his painting until the last. With simplicity and economy. his eyes and gestures let us feel some understanding of the man and his art.

Additionally I appreciated the choice to just focus on a brief period near the end of Renoir's life, and his (platonic) relationship with his last muse, rather than the usual sprawling bio-pic approach.

On the other hand, I wasn't enamored by the script (or at least the English translation on the subtitles) which kept reducing much of what is said by Renoir and those around him to easy and generic statements about art, pain, joy, creativity. If the images capture the richness of the man's work, the dialogue is often the Hallmark card opposite.

Also, perhaps the most interesting part of the story, the return of Renoir's son Jean - who would go on to be one of the great film-makers of all time, from WW I, and his slow falling into romance with his father's muse Andree is jammed into the end of the film, and stays very much on the surface. You know something is amiss when the most emotion you feel in a film is at the cards just before the end credits summing up all the events you didn't see.

It's too bad, because if the human stories (and ironically both generations of Renoir did work that was nothing if not about humanity) had matched the beauty of the images this seems like it could have been a great film -- instead of a beautiful but somewhat hollow and emotionally remote one. Still worth seeing, just frustrating.",1409616000,5,1936,4.616279069767442

The story itself is about Auguste in his last years, and his relationship with his son Jean, who has been injured in World War I.  The story is not particularly complex, but it is such a rich reproduction of an era when modernity is encroaching on many old-world ideas.  Renoir's wife is dead, and he is tended to by a group of women with whom he has had previous dalliances.  A young, beautiful woman comes to Renoir's estate to be his model.  Her presence is like a spark of brilliant light for both father and son.  I think the movie is not absolutely pristine in historical truth, but it is close enough and certainly captivating enough that the small diversions from factual chronologies pale in the brilliance of the people and the settings.

5554844,5,B00B4EPDF8,"Renoir brings to the screen many beautiful scenes which have been painstakingly staged to make them look as much like an Impressionist painting as possible, with exquisite color and carefully controlled light. The cover of the Blu-ray depicts just such a painterly scene, portraying a young couple sitting in a sun-drenched field, with a lattice of leaves on slender drooping branches.

Pierre Auguste Renoir was, along with Claude Monet, one of the originators of Impressionist techniques in painting. The film chronicles a year near the end of his life, during the Great War, later to be known as World War I. Two of his sons were of military service age, the oldest being in the Air Corps, the second being in the Army, and after recuperation at home from a wound, the second son also joined the Air Corps. The story depicted in the film is centered on Renoir and his second son, Jean, who after the war followed his passion for film and became one of France's greatest directors.

Renoir was in his seventies during the time depicted in the film, old beyond his years due to severe rheumatoid arthritis which gnarled and crippled his hands. He had his brushes tied to his hands, and continued to paint. The makeup for Renoir's hands is so authentic looking that I wondered if the actor was actually afflicted with arthritis, but the extras reveal that he was not. The flow of action in this film is deliberately paced, realistic, and beautiful. Father, Son and The Girl are the main characters, the latter being a model for Pierre and a love interest for Jean.

The film Renoir carries an R rating due to numerous scenes of nudity with the posing of the artist's model or models, and a relatively few strongly worded expressions, none gratuitous and all befitting the moment.

It was beautiful, but it also presented a look into the man and his late life that was mesmerizing and had a haunting beauty that his paintings portrayed.  This wasn't the typical art appreciation video.  It was a true (I think) telling of the life of a very complex man and the people who loved him.  There were those that saw him as a path to a very comfortable and easy going life, and those that truly loved the man and dedicated their lives to his support and comfort.  There was the dark shadow of people who wished for whatever wealth he had, but this was not dominant to the story line.  In the end, there was much to love and appreciate in this old genius.  There were many questions about who, what, where, when things happened to his family and staff, but this was about his late life and did not dote on these soap opera-ish questions.

All in all, it was a very enjoyable movie.  Beautiful to look at and take a trip to the French countryside while learning a little art history.",1397779200,,1118,4.331730769230769

Just as much, an essential film for those who appreciate the work of Jean Renoir the film maker (the son of Renoir for those who did not know). The bridge between these 2 great artists is explored through the lens of an intriguing father-son film, with of course Renoir's model at the time who becomes the girlfriend of the Jean. Overall, a great film, beautifully capturing the feel if 1st world war era France. A delight for painters as well, and non artists seeking a glimpse into the life of the man behind so many wonderful works of art. Looking forward to the next film of Gilles Bourdos. Afterwards, starring John Malkovitch and Romain Duris is well worth checking out if you like the work of this director.",1396656000,,830,4.577181208053691
5554851,4,B00B4EPDF8,"This beautiful film tells the story of two Renoirs.  Pierre-Auguste (Michel Bouquet), the famous French Impressionist painter and his son Jean who went on to become an acclaimed filmmaker.  In 1915 the elder Renoir is an aging seventies-something, confined to a wheel chair, essentially infirm.  His hands are wrought with pain caused by ever more crippling arthritis.  Still he paints daily, with a cadre of maids, most of whom were once his models, helping to transport him to various locations on his estate on the French Riviera.  They tie his fingers together so he can hold a brush and wash them down with ice at the end of the day.

Renoir's wife has recently died.  He has 2 sons off to war against the Kaiser and a boy of about 14 still at home.  Looking for a young model, Renoir hires a young comely woman named Andree (Christa Theret).  If my facts are correct, in real life she would have been 15, but appears to be about 18 in the film.  Ms. Theret was actually 21 when the film was made.  I only point this out as Renoir's models were usually nude or partially nude in his paintings.  Andree becomes Renoir's muse and he finds new life in his work, even as his body continues to deteriorate.

Young Jean (Vincent Rottiers) returns home from the war to recuperate from a severe leg wound.  After some time Jean and Andree's love of movies brings them together.  The movie features some great photography by Ping Bin Lee, consistent with the great work of the master, Renoir.  Alexandre Desplat's score adds a nice warmth to the various scenes.  Fair warning however, the film is ploddingly slow.  There really isn't much going on.  Some squabbles, the youngest son getting into occasional trouble.  So action seekers or just people looking for some drama won't find it here.  Director Gilles Bourdos clearly set out to deliver a great film to look at.  The spunky Theret's interpretation of Christa does give the film a bit of flavor.  She reminds me of Brigitte Bardot's character in ""...And God Created Woman"" both in physical appearance and sass.

As a footnote Jean married Andree and she went on to act under the name Catherine Hessling and he went on to direct some great films including one of my favorites ""The Rules of the Game"" in 1939.

The Blu ray version of this film is a terrific transfer, properly showcasing the great film portraits of the French countryside.  Flesh colors are accurate.  The film has excellent clarity and detail.  Check out the various coats the men wear.  The audio is also very good with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track in French (with English subtitles).  The scenes along a river bank quietly show the audio dispersion to the surrounds as well as other mostly exterior scenes.

The soundtrack is sensitive and thoughtful, bringing internal mental states of the characters into one's own head. Contemporary Americans forget the power of thoughtful music in a film that is about people, not car chases down turnpikes.

I'm not terribly fond of Renoir's painting, but this treatment of him and his work is art in an of itself. One should watch this with no sense of needing to just get through it, but rather should savor it like a fine wine or an elegant meal. The portrayal of Renoir's emotional life is masterful even though it is understated.

The movie does a lot of things very well, telling the story in visuals instead of words, creating a beautiful yet believable setting, injecting interest and color with well-cast secondary characters, Jean Renoir's younger brother, Coco, is riveting. The problems come late in the movie when the slow-paced storyline, something I normally enjoy, runs out of momentum.

My main complaint is that while it is a very good film, it could have been a great film with a more disciplined director. Yes, I recommend seeing it. Using a convicted forger of Renoir's paintings to paint them as the viewer watches is pure magic. Visually, the film is intoxicating.

The story is how Andree Heuschling, Auguste Renoir's last model, and future filmmaker Jean Renoir's first leading lady, brings father and son together by inspiring them both in unique and different ways.

Though not shown in the film, the intimate and professional liaison between Andree and Jean falls apart in later years. He goes on to become one of the greatest film-makers ever and she dies in poverty. To the film's credit, hints are provided for both outcomes.",1390780800,,1201,4.995

5554864,4,B00B4EPDF8,"if you like Renoir's art, and I do, then you will probably like this film even though it is so slowly paced that one could make a bad pun about the time's passing like paint's drying.  this is a slice of the late life of the painter Pierre Auguste Renoir.  he is seventy four years old and in terrible health yet he keeps painting. his son Jean has joined him to convalesce in his home in the sunny south (gorgeous) as he was injured in WWI. it is 1915.

the remarkable thing to me was that though Pierre Auguste Renoir was a very great painter and quite obsessed with his art, he was not a monster to his children as so many great men are. Jean Renoir after the war would go on to become a renowned film director. he would write a loving biography of his father in his own older age and then be buried with him.

the best portions of the film though are seeing his paintings come to life.  his nude women are part of that summer as they bathe and frolic in the sun and water of southern France.  it is a golden moment in time even though it is surrounded by war which will not end until 1918. if one leaves Renoir's estate, the roads outside are filled with badly maimed soldiers. Renoir the painter is beyond all that of course as his body has him hurtling towards a very soon death and thus he cocoons himself among his art, his family and his retainers. the red haired actress picked to play the nude model is astonishingly like the woman in Renoir's last paintings.  the nudity in the film is the same as the nudity in the paintings.

IN REAL LIFE-- jean renoir would marry twice.  the first would be to an actress he used in his early films.  that  would last ten years.  they would divorce and then roughly a decade later he would marry again and stay married until his death. i'm not sure that this young model is supposed to be his first wife, the actress.  the timing doesn't fit his real life timeline but perhaps the director was using some artistic license himself. Pierre Auguste Renoir would die in 1919, four years after the time in this film.  WW I would have just ended. one can appreciate how little medicine and doctors could do for him in 1915.  his rheumatoid arthritis was entirely unrelieved, just for one. few seventy four year olds today are in such physical torment with the maladies that he had.

5554866,5,B00B4EPDF8,"Writer/director Gilles Bourdos (with assistance from Jacques Renoir, Michel Spinosa, and Jrme Tonnerre) bring us the incandescent beauty of a transcendent summer in 1915 in the Cte d'Azur when Pierre-Auguste Renoir began the denouement of the Impressionist period of painting. More than a simple story, this film is a recreation of the view of nature and of the human figure as bathed in that special light of the countryside of France. It is as much an artwork as t is a biographical view of one of history's great painters.

The Cte d'Azur, 1915. In his twilight years, Pierre-Auguste Renoir (Michel Bouquet) is tormented by the loss of his wife, the pains of rheumatoid arthritis severely limiting his movement, wheelchair-bound, and the agony of hearing that his son Jean (Vincent Rottiers) has been wounded in the action of WW I. His household is tended by maids who have been previous models, and his youngest son Coco (Thomas Doret) who suffers from the lack of attention from his still grieving father. But when a young girl miraculously enters his world, the old painter is filled with a new, wholly unexpected energy. Blazing with life, radiantly beautiful, Andre Heuschling (Christa Theret) will become his last model, who rejuvenates, enchants, and inspires both father and son. Returning to the family home to convalesce, Jean too falls under the spell of the new, redheaded star in the Renoir firmament. In their Mediterranean Eden - and in the face of his father's fierce opposition - he falls in love with this wild, untamable spirit... and as he does so, within weak-willed, battle-shaken Jean, a filmmaker begins to grow.

Bathed in the cinematography glow of Ping Bin Lee and the subtle, sensual musical score by Alexandre Desplat and greatly enhanced by a pitch perfect cast, this film is more of a mood piece than a biopic. At film's end we are informed of the lives of the characters; Jean married Andre and they made very successful films together until their divorce (Jean Renoir become one of the most highly regarded film directors in history, dying in 1979 - the year that the then destitute Andre died, Coco (Claude) Renoir gained fame as a ceramic artist, and the eldest on Pierre became an actor whose son became the brilliant film maker Claude Renoir). It is an important moment in the history of art and a quietly pensive study of the mind of artists and their models. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 13",1388188800,3,2444,4.900966183574879

Curtains calmly flutter, trees vibrate and bend and we hear it. The high definition image is something to treasure. Well, I want to view it on a frozen January day. All of the acting is perfect. Agonies of aging are experienced... to horrific limits. The stupidity of war is revealed from a distance. Music is wonderful. My opinion is that there is nothing in the film that should be kept from children. It's a valuable education on the physical beauty of human beings, and on the many layers of intelligence and decency of women. Old Renoir says that every woman... every one... deserves respect. He does not think of himself as an artist, but as a worker. The women who lovingly carry his chair to beautiful locations for him to work... have all had a part in cherishing him and his ability to nurture them and their children. There are mysterious characters like Jean's young brother. I won't interfere with the flow of this movie by talking about the truth of it all. After you have seen it. Look up the characters. See the films of Jean Renoir. Again, on the rating of the film. Yes, a parent will have to talk about what war is. But, just like the children in the movie... our precious children should learn these things so that they can help us stifle war. Five stars is the limit here... but this movie deserves a few extras.

A few days later: I have just viewed Jean Renoir's ""French Can Can."" It is available on dvd, blu-ray from France and also online from Hulu. It is truly amazing... and it is a beautiful reflection of what we learned from the 2013 ""Renoir"" film. In French Can Can, Jean Gabin plays a stage genius who loves women as instruments of beauty who he can teach to perform. The movie is about an artist who, like Jean's father... loves women. My favorite scene is Gabin sitting in a chair offstage visualizing exactly what is happening in the theater... and enjoying it. I can't think of another movie from earlier than the 1960s that looks so spectacular in use of color. It looks old style expensive. Jean is in the film. Edith Piaf is in the movie briefly... singing. The movie is pretty light and cheerful. There is the element of ""people's art"" that reveals Jean Renoir's attitude. What a wonderful follow-up to Renoir 2013. I have seen several other movies made by Jean Renoir, but I will be visiting all that I can now. French Can Can also gets all stars available from me. You will find a version of it on Amazon offered dvd with two other films including the ""Golden Coach""... which I liked very much 20 years ago.",1384128000,29,2710,4.508130081300813

5554877,4,B00B4EPDF8,"Directed by Gilles Bourdos, ""Renoir"" tells the story of the old age of the great ""French painter Pierre Auguste Renoir (1841 -- 1919) (played by Michel Bouquet) and of the coming-of-age of his son, the filmaker Jean Renoir (1894 -- 1979) (played by Vincent Rottiers). The film is set in 1915 as WW I rages, on Renoir's lovely estate in southern France. The catalyst of the film is the aging Renoir's last model, Catherine (or Andree) Heuschling (played by Christa Theret) who arrives unannounced at the estate on a spring day to become what will be Renoir's last model. A thin, willowy woman with light skin, red hair, and a fiery disposition, Catherine captivates the heart of the old painter who is referred to by the estate's retinue as ""boss"". She also captures the interest of Renoir's pre-adolescent youngest son who otherwise has little to do on the estate as his mother has just died and the painter is not much taken with the duties of fatherhood.

Midway in the film, Renoir's middle son, Jean, 22, returns to the estate with a serious leg wound. As with many young men, Jean has not found his path in life although he displays an inkling towards film. He too is captivated by Catherine, whom he ultimately marries, creating a tension between himself and his father.

Although it discusses war, age, youth, and art, the movie centers upon Catherine, in her character and her body. Large sections of the film are given over to Catherine posing nude for Renoir, to his inspiration and to that of the viewer. The film emphasizes the beauty of the flesh and on its transformation on canvas to art. Flesh, sensuality, and love contrast with the horrors of the war raging not far away. Both Jean and the younger Renoir son are smitten with Catherine as she poses. She is in disposition independent, somewhat calculating, and the possessor of a sharp temper.

The film moves slowly with little dramatic tension. The body of Catherine and Renoir's estate are the primary visual attractions. Still, the aging artist is portrayed sympathetically and well, and the film offers a glimpse into the future of Renoir's gifted son. Together with his films Jean Renoir would also write a biography of his father.

The movie is in French with subtitles. Interestingly, Bourdos hired a convicted art forger to recreate the many Renoir paintings shown in the course of the movie. He did a masterful job. This is a lovely film about a physically beautiful woman and her impact a famous father and son. The movie will capture for the viewer, as Catherine did for the Renoirs, the allure and sensuality of a beautiful nude female form.

5554878,4,B00B4EPDF8,"""Renoir"" (2012 release from France; 110 min.) is NOT an overview or bio-pic on the Impressionist painter's life. Instead, it retells one particular summer, set in 1915 in southern France. As the movie opens, we see a young woman named Andr&eacute;e (played by Christa Theret) approaching the house of the Renoir family. Possessing a stunning beauty, she was recommended to be Renoir's newest model. Renoir at that point is already in his mid-70s, and endures various physical ailments. In the house there appear to be a group of women who at one point may have been models but ended up staying as maids. We learn that Renoir has three sons, of which the oldest two are now fighting in World War I. Then about one-third into the movie, one of them, the middle brother Jean, returns home from the war, having been heavily wounded. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this movie is one of the most gorgeous looking movies I have seen in a long time. A number of the scenes recreate Renoir painting and to me it feels like every scene in the movie is like a painting come to life. Second, this movie moves as snail's pace, and I mean this as a compliment. It is, I suppose, in part a reflection of life a century ago, when everything moved slower and people had more time on their hands. Third, it takes quite a while for the movie to find its emotional footing, as in the first hour we simply get to know the various characters and how they fill their days. Fourth, WWI plays a major role in the movie, and in fact weighs heavily on the movie from start to finishg. Fifth, kudos to Michel Bouquet, a legend of French cinema (he was 85 when this movie was filmed), in the title role. To be that age and getting such a challenging role! Bouquet delivers a tour-de-force in my opinion. The other headliners (Christa Theret as Andr&eacute;e and Vincent Rottiers as Jean Renoir) are also fine but are overshadowed by Bouquet. Lastly, beware there is quite a bit of 'artistic nudity' in the movie (although I thought it was never gratuitous or offensive). Bottom line: this is a beautiful, slow-moving movie that gives a glimpse into August Renoir's later life. Be sure to stick around for the end credits as we are told what became of the various characters later in their lives. As a complete aside, the parallels between this movie and another recent French-language movie called ""The Artist and the Model"" (starring that other legendary French actor Jean Rochefort), which I just saw this past weekend, are striking.

I saw ""Renoir"" at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati in May of this year, and am glad to see that it has finally been listed here on Amazon as a future DVD release. When I saw it, I was quite surprised how packed the theatre was (mostly seniors, I might add). Regardless, if you are a fan of Renoir's art or simply in the mood for a slow-moving foreign movie that is a visual feast from start to finish, you cannot go wrong with this and I would readily recommend ""Renoir"".",1378425600,25,3119,4.567857142857143

The story itself was good, but I didn't think it was superb. At times it got painfully slow with the silent montages and sad music. But overall beautiful and worthwhile to watch.",1522281600,,369,4.967741935483871
