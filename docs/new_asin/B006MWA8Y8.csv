5006984,1,B006MWA8Y8,"I watched this movie recently and fully knew what I was expecting.  A B movie that was tongue in cheek and that would have a lot of laughs.  I was wrong.  The whole story was a waste of time, the monsters a joke and the characters-better off dead.  The premise is that a director goes into the woods to refilm his movie after he was told to put more sex and violence in it.  However, one by one the cast are being killed off.

I was disappointed with this and would urge you not to buy it-unless you want to waste an hour and a half of your life.",1335916800,,546,3.963302752293578

5006986,1,B006MWA8Y8,"Simply awful. *Spoiler Alert* (that you should thank me for and chose another Movie to kill 1 hour and 20 minutes of your life watching). Best thing is it wasn't long. The ""grainy film look"" I figured was the ""Movie"" with actors in the Movie they were out there to make...then the non-grainy was ""real life"". Even tho this had it's share of embarrassing boob shots & is one of those films I don't care if they all died in. The plot was all over the place, special effect I can do better on a tablet, and acting so bad it made me cry for my Mommy. None of it made any sense but we watched it b/c it appeared to be a ""monster movie"" my husband likes...not me as much and he even hated it.
Not 1 reason for these monsters and why do ppl continue to make crappy movies in woods (low budget I suppose) but this is as predictable as the others when everybody goes out of range of cell phones even...I hate that b/c it is exactly what cell phones to me are for...to call for help. But even a Spielberg couldn't save this mess. Really scroll past it and thank me later.",1483574400,,1061,4.130434782608695

5006991,3,B006MWA8Y8,"As a low budget movie that is trying to look like an old 70s movie, it did ok, though the worn-film look could get annoying at times. The film also uses rather low grade acting, though I am unsure if it is due to budget or an actual attempt by the writer and director to flesh out that low budget, cheap film feeling.
If you can stand the bad acting and like something that is somewhat experimental, give it a shot.",1481846400,,415,4.135802469135802

5006994,2,B006MWA8Y8,"Can't really say why I didn't hate it. The acting probably couldn't have been much worse. dialogue was stupid. I mean really stupid. Music was bad.  And why was the film so grainy and 1930s-ish? That was annoying. Special effects were especially silly, And why is it in zombie movies (although this was not a zombie movie) and slasher movies the characters never bother to wipe the blood off their face? However, there was something about it that made it bearable, so it is not the worse ever. ""Oasis of the Zombies"" - Your position is secure.",1480809600,2,543,4.597938144329897

5006998,1,B006MWA8Y8,"Yet another 'found footage' low budget movie. The more of these come out, the less 'ultra realistic' they come off as. Really bad acting, bad story... I could have filmed it with my cell phone and edited it on my computer over the weekend. There is this 'scratches' film effect to make the film look worn that must have been added on someone's home PC because the scratches look really fake and keep repeating.

Story disjointed with several ideas thrown in (or out, or up) to a largely incomprehensible mess.",1478044800,4,263,4.630434782608695
5007004,1,B006MWA8Y8,"ugh.

Let's see: Bad acting all around (save for Ariel, she was at least close to acceptable), ridiculous dialogue, horrible attempts at ""humor"", sex, hot girls, and creatures===all ingredients for the perfect ""B"" movie. Or, in this case, a D- movie. Just not enough here to hold your attention. The creatures' costumes were probably the most original thing, but the ""actors"" are so unlikeable that you just cannot have enough interest to care what happens to any of them.",1476748800,4,472,4.974683544303797

5007012,2,B006MWA8Y8,"Released in 2012, Monsters in the Woods is a micro-budget flick (costing a mere $30,000) aboutyou guessed itmonsters in the woods of Southern California that a film crew experience while shooting a low-budget horror movie.

I like the diverse ethnic cast, which is refreshing, but the shaky cam gets annoying real quick. There are a couple of cute girls, but no one to get overly excited over, although I like the Hispanic actress introduced in the second act. I also like the way the monsters are depicted, sorta half-human, half-spider and impressively diabolic all things considered. Near the end of the first act one of the main protagonists abruptly buys the farm and the reaction of the rest of the crew is unconvincing and a turn-off. The second act introduces two curious characters with head-scratching dialogue but, thankfully, the cool monsters are also introduced. Unfortunately, the proceedings and characters are dull, as written. Things finally perk up in the last act with revelations about whats really going on, but it cant save the flick from being what it ishalf-baked nonsense.

Theres enough good here for a quality monster-in-the-woods horror movie, but the filmmakers needed to take the time to work the kinks out in the story/script. George Romero did this with his original Night of the Living Dead (1968) and it remains a selling masterpiece to this day. The lesson? Dont rush off into the woods to shoot a monster flick, low-budget or not, UNTIL you have a well-written story with interesting characters. Otherwise you're just wasting your time and the time of anyone who views this harebrained drivel.

The film runs about 90 minutes and was shot in San Bernardino National Forest, California.

GRADE:  D",1470441600,,1733,5.045454545454546
5007013,1,B006MWA8Y8,"The story has strong possibility, with a film crew deep in the woods, suddenly under attack by actual monsters. It should have been a fun, entertaining, low budget, horror comedy. What happens is that so many ideas and elements are thrown together in a make-shift concept that falls apart mostly due to poor execution. The cast are not convincing- I am not even sure the actors really got what the director was going for with ""Monsters In The Woods"". The different concepts do more to crowd the film with indirection and distraction than to create a strong single, concise story arc.

The special effects used in ""Monsters In The Woods"" are by far some of the weakest. Even with cheap effects on a low budget, execution is crucial to pulling off the practical, and desired vision of he story. In the film things sort of look too dime store constume-y, than professional effects. There is nudity and screams galore. Blood spatters and monsters rage. However it isn't powerful enough to cover or over- shadow all the flaws this film gives us. Most notable a poor sound quality. Big no-no, and movie killer for even the best of stories with a decent budgets.

Overall, ""Monsters In The Woods"" teases an entertaining, homage to b- movie madness but fails to deliver. I followed the film's production and looked forward to finally seeing the finished product. Needless to say-I am disappointed. There is just too much that fails in this one for me to like the movie. Once again it proves the adage-""less is more""when it comes to concepts-put the more into special effects and sound. See the film if you just want to kill some time out of idle curiosity-but just be aware that it isn't J. Horton's finest work.",1431907200,,1704,4.714765100671141
5007014,2,B006MWA8Y8,"This is a film about making a slasher film in the woods. The regular photography is supplemented with hand-held cameras to remind us how bad these type of films can be. The plot also includes a battle of good vs. evil as the monsters are really hell hounds.

The dialogue was better than normal with some humor injected into the script. The director was of the ""Ed Wood"" variety.
