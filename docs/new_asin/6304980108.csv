He acted well in ""Sidewalks of London"", right alongside Vivien Leigh. This is one of my favorite movies now, and I completely enjoyed it!",1354579200,,291,4.509433962264151
8375356,3,6304980108,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand earlier today.

This film is interesting because it stars Scarlett O'Hara, The Hunchback Of Notre Dame and Professor Higgins before they became famous. Actually, Charles Laughton is the SECOND Hunchback, as Lon Chaney was the first in what is arguably the definitive version of Victor Hugo's classic novel (filmed in 1923 which launched him to stardom and he would become The Phantom Of The Opera two years later). The story is intriguing, but the script itself is somewhat muddled and meanders on endlessly without a clear resolution. View it once. Not Rated.",1335830400,,606,5.0
8375357,4,6304980108,"""Sidewalks of London"" (aka ""St. Martin's Lane"") is a 1938 black and white romantic comedy about the street performers (""buskers"") in London who earn their living entertaining the people who are waiting in lines outside theatres.

Charles Laughton (1899-1962) plays a busker who specializes in speech giving. Laughton is arguably the most capable actor in Hollywood's golden era. His performances in films such as ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1936) and ""Witness for the Prosecution "" (1958) are peerless, and when you consider he received best actor nominations for both films, separated by more than 20 years, this speaks volumes. He won the best actor award for his portrayal in ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" (1933) and gave unforgettable performances as Quasimodo in ""The Hunchback of Norte Dame"" (1939), Inspector Javert in ""Les Miserables"" (1935). Laughton is marvelous.

Vivien Leigh (1913-67) plays a dancer who makes her money as a pick pocket. Leigh is best known for her stunning performances in ""GWTW"" (1939) as Scarlett O'Hara and as Blanche Dubois in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951) - she won the Oscar both times. Eventually physical problems, a miscarriage, and the difficulty of living with husband Laurence Olivier would take their toll and she began a slow descent into madness. But here in 1938 she is great and the girl who Laughton takes in.

FWIW - the only real problem with Leigh's performance is that she is too old for the part which is written for a teenager. Of course this wasn't unusual for films in the 30s or later, for that matter. Leigh also played the teenage Cleopatra when she was 32, and looked even sillier than she does here at 25.

Rex Harrison (1908-90) plays a successful composer who meets Leigh by chance and helps her become a leading lady. Harrison made 50 films and won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for ""My Fair Lady"" (1964) and was nominated for Golden Globes for ""Cleopatra"" (1963), ""The Agony and the Ecstasy"" (1965), and ""Dr. Doolittle"" (1967).

American Tim Whelan (1893-1957) directs. Whelan began directing in 1928 and specialized in comedies like ""Larceny Street"" (1987) and ""The Divorce of Lady X"" (1938).

Eric Pommer (1889-1966) was a German producer famous for the UFA films like ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" (1920), ""Dr. Mabuse"" (1922), ""Metropolis"" (1927) and ""The Blue Angel"" (1930). When the Nazis took over he moved to the US and then to England where he made ""Fire Over England"" (1937)  which is the film on which Leigh met Olivier. He formed a production company with Laughton, The Mayflower Picture Corp., and together they made this film.

The film is great fun. The ""buskers"" are very entertaining, and Leigh gets a chance to show what a good dancer she was. Harrison is engagingly coy, Laughton chews up the scenery, and Leigh tries to make everyone fall in love with her.",1312848000,,2842,4.893970893970894
8375358,3,6304980108,"Without the incomparable Ms. Leigh, there would be no real reason to watch this film.  It is sluggishly paced when she is not onscreen, and it can be hard to care about the plot.  An interesting note, though, she sings!  Just a little.",973036800,,235,4.4186046511627906
