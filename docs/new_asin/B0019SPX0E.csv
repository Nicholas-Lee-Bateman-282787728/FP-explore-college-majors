3443488,5,B0019SPX0E,"I had so much fun hooping in my living room.  It was like being a kid again.  I laughed the whole time.  I think that I got more of a workout from laughing than the actual hooping part.

I suggest buying a large, weighted hoop.  It is way easier for beginners.",1253318400,3,260,4.019607843137255
3443489,5,B0019SPX0E,"I bought this DVD after working with Hoopdance for Beginners, which I loved because I learned basic moves with it. This sequel is the perfect next step up in my hoopdance workout routine. The moves build on the ones in the first DVD and the choreography helped me put together super-neat routines for my own enjoyment and fitness, and to wow my family and friends with.  I can't believe how much I've slimmed and my abs, hips and arms have toned!  My body finally has that buff, yet soft and feminine look that I've always longed for. Now, I meet regularly with friends and some family members for hoop workouts and free-dance sessions. This has become such a joyful and empowering part of my life that I've decided to sign up for the Hoopgirl teacher training workshop.",1245024000,7,770,4.613138686131387
3443490,3,B0019SPX0E,"This is specifically for keeping the hoop on your hips only.

The very end of the DVD shows some arm tricks during a performance piece, but not enough camera angles to learn it.  Poor costuming as well.  It is as if you are a really good hooper, you have to look like a cheap tramp.",1237852800,5,282,4.090909090909091
3443491,3,B0019SPX0E,This work out is great but someone who is a complete beginner in hooping is going to have an extremely hard time keeping up. I recommend mastering waist hooping before you try this. A great DVD for total beginners is Hoopnotica's Beginners Level 1. It explains hooping more thoroughly and you can go at your  own pace. I still really love the work-out that this DVD provides though and if you feel comfortable waist hooping while walking you'll find this one a fun challenge!,1236297600,21,475,4.654761904761905
3443492,5,B0019SPX0E,"In this inventive exercise DVD you get cardiovascular fitness, strengthening and energizing, and you'll burn lots of calories once you get the technique of Hooping down; this DVD is for beginners through advanced, with ""all ages, body types and ability levels"" benefiting from doing these movements. The hoops used are professional weighted hoops, wrapped in friction tape (helps to stick to your hips!).

Christabel Zamor is attractive and dynamic, and she gives us an intro, a warm-up, ""How to Hoop,"" ""Marching in Place,"" ""Step-Touch,"" ""Grapevine,"" ""Dance Party"" 1, 2, and 3, and ""Combinations"" which are essentially the ""Dance Party"" moves extended. You'll also get a ""Cool Down"" and a fabulous performance where Christabel shows us the 101 things one can do dancing with a hoop.

If you haven't done this before you'll start to feel the burn on ""the inch you can pinch"" around your waist in the ""How to Hoop"" section, and as the DVD progresses, you can almost feel your midriff toning as you dance. This is a superb exercise for your torso and especially your waist and hips, but you'll also get results for your shoulders, legs and arms.

Don't worry if you feel a little clumsy at first while you try to rotate the hoop and move your feet at the same time; with very little practice, you'll get the hang of it. The ""Dance Party"" moves are terrific, and once learned, you can do them to your favorite up-tempo music, and you can do it anywhere, as not that much room is required for this. A very few square feet in your living room will suffice, and you'll have a blast while you burn up all those calories.",1223164800,55,1612,4.689045936395759
3443493,3,B0019SPX0E,"This is a pretty good beginner DVD.  I'm recommending it to my Mom's church and to my sister-in-law and her kids.  We are going to get them all hooping in the next 2 months!  For myself, I've been doing this stuff since I was a kid.  If you are wanting to do the ""fancy"" stuff, this is not the DVD you want.  This is a good very low impact workout, not something to get you ready to perform.  It HAS inspired me to start hooping again!  Some of her costumes are super-cute, too.  I'm looking forward to a more advanced DVD from Christabel!  (She also has an infectious laugh!)",1222560000,38,576,4.2110091743119265

Presented by Christabel Zamor.
World Dance New York is back with great body politics aimed at improving the female mind and body.
This  workout program offers the benefits of working the body in circular motion which  massages internal organs and works the spine in circular fashion to improve flexibility.
This program runs approximately 58 minutes, it is for personal enjoyment, physical improvement, burns calories to promote weight loss.

Hooping? Don't be fooled, this is a total body workout, cardio included. This program is user friendly from all ages, and sizes and there is no wrong way to hoop. It would probably be great for mother and daughter teams, or anyone else needing to get up and exercise.
The instructor presents her program with familiarity and great energy. Her costumes and work out clothing are very striking, colorful. The backdrop is simple and unobtrusive, the lighting gentle enough to enhance the subject.

Included in the program:
Warm up- marching in place, lifting the hoop overhead, step touch, shoulder shimmies,
Learn a grapevine step
Basics-foot work -marching in place adding a turn add head movement, arm placement
Recovery technique-accelerating, spiraling, bend and blast.
Drills- segments of three speed variations,while using motions: pulsating the torso, swimming, offering and flowing.
Changing directions which are referred to as ""inflow and outflow""
Footwork and arm combinations
Cool down with neck and shoulder rolls, breathing, and torso drops and stretches, nice hip isolations and rotations.
A  playful performance by Christabel to inspire you to create your own hoop dance.
It is recommended that you purchase a professional hoop at [...]

The program begins with a simple warm up, then the steps are added gradually, along with technique and hoop recovery methods. You may choose your speed in the Dance Party segments. These are accelerated to speed levels for gradual build up. A short cool down follows, then a performance that is fantastic and motivating!
Long ago, hooping was a familiar trend for many of us and we could go on for hours. I am happy to see that it has returned. For this program, I recommend a professional hoop, since ordinary hoops are lightweight, and require much hip action for momentum. Overall, I felt this was a workout program with great benefits however:unclear is the comparison to yoga,
the ""keep smiling,""  by the instructor  I felt was more of a filler, distracting, and out of place,the hip rotations are finally explained at the end in the cool down section. Nonetheless, that is little to complain about in comparison to all that is offered.",1222560000,39,2654,5.17016317016317
3443495,4,B0019SPX0E,"I recently found out I am pregnant, so it looks like I won't be doing this for very long. However I will continue for as long as possible. The instructor is adorable, upbeat and thorough. Great video for beginners, and easy to learn if you definitely have the right size hoop. I always work up a good sweat and feel great after a hoop dance workout. It's honestly more fun and better than going to the gym.",1436227200,,406,4.285714285714286

3443508,2,B0019SPX0E,I would say this is a fast moving video that isn't well suited for beginners. It is much better suited for those who have a grasp of the basic hooping skills.,1378598400,,158,4.129032258064516

3443517,4,B0019SPX0E,"I actually bought this video for my daughter who hula hoops and is thinking of trying to get a job in a gym - we bought it so she could get an idea of how a hula hoop workout would be.

 You will get a great workout with this video, just make sure you at least know how to swing one - and I'm sure with practice you would be able to master it - and in the meantime just hula away the lbs!",1358985600,,388,3.607142857142857
3443518,5,B0019SPX0E,"I've been hooping for a couple months now and am still getting the basic moves down. I've gotten Christabel's Book, her hoopdance for beginners DVD, and this DVD. Of the 3 this is my favorite, because the music is a lot easier to dance to and have fun too, rather than the elevator music and the indian style music in the other DVD's. Also When she talks it's actually her talking while she's hooping which really helps me stay motivated and enthusiastic, while the other DVD's I have she's just smiling the whole time and has a pre-recorded voice that talks you through the moves, so you really don't get to see her bubbly attitude you see in this one.
  If you're just beginning to hoop it'll definitely take some practice to get some of these moves down, but it's a fun workout that will get you dancing around and having fun.",1358899200,,829,4.447368421052632

3443521,5,B0019SPX0E,"I am very satisfed with the Service, and satisfied with what is taught in the dvd. However it is a little Boring, as there is ony one person featured in the entire dvd, and the setting (which looked like an old scraggly club at 4am ) was very unappealing. The setting was not captivating but what you are being taught is. I think I am going to be looking for the next dvd at a better price soon. I saw there that there are atleast 3 women practicing the hoopdance and in pretty locations, so I think this will be more motivating. I did however love the music featured in this dvd and I enjoyed the 4 minute dance show she gave at the end. Shows you how captivating this hoop thing can really be. Also loved her outfits! I like to look nice when I work out as well, even in my living room. Makes me feel awesome(er) some how and motivated. Her clothings were very fun, tropic and went right along with her routine.
I think it is worth the buy and th price and seller here was amazing to me! Could not believe how fast it arrived!!
ps. This is perfect for beginners.  Never got to complicated, might want to get the intermediate for a bit more challenge if you already have experience. This is my first one and I am so excited for my hoop to come!!!!!!!!!!!
Maybe I'll get good at it and teach others t do it! :)
Enjoy!!",1296086400,4,1318,4.1686274509803924
3443522,1,B0019SPX0E,"""HoopGirl"" talked and acted SO phony that she got on my nerves too much to watch. I could not take her phony personality, horrible voice, and hooker outfits long enough to watch the whole thing. I sold my copy. She dressed like a stripper and talked like a Nursery School Show host. It was just to awful to take. I was utterly annoyed and grossed out.",1288569600,18,351,4.333333333333333
3443523,1,B0019SPX0E,"I have never known how and somehow thought this video would teach me. It explained what to do if it started falling, but how to keep it up in the first place was a mystery. Disappointing...",1286841600,3,189,4.277777777777778
3443524,5,B0019SPX0E,I have lost 25 pounds so far by doing hoop fitness. It is fun and time flies by while doing it. When I started hooping I would watch a TV show for an hour and just simply waist hoop in both directions. I wanted a guide for a workout while waist hooping. This DVD was it! I have 3 young children and I am unable to go outside or hoop in a space where I can swing a large hoop around. This workout gives me a high calorie quiet workout to do at night when my babies are sleeping. It is intense and takes time and patience to keep up. I find I get better and better everytime I do the workout. I highly recommend this DVD. Happy Hooping!!!!,1256342400,34,637,3.945736434108527

8275176,3,B0019SPX0E,This was just ok - somewhat underwhelming.

8275180,5,B0019SPX0E,"I got a Trim Hoop and managed to get to a place where I can keep it going around my waist for a little while, but I wanted something more interesting to do that would keep me engaged for long enough to get a real workout.  This dvd fits the bill for someone at my hooping level.  The instructor is encouraging and not intimidating, and the moves are doable but a definite challenge to my limited expertise.  It will be a while before I can make it through the whole video, which gets more complicated as it moves on, but after two sessions I'm up to a full 30 minutes (dropping the hoop fairly regularly).

For someone at an intermediate level, the dvd would be pretty good for drills and probably a decent workout.  I think it might be valuable for practicing, but you won't learn anything new.  She starts with a warm-up - no hooping, then basic practice going one direction and then the other, and then practice moving the feet, the arms, the head, etc.  It gets faster and more complex, but it never becomes anything advanced like some of those impressive videos I've seen on youtube.  Unless I missed something, you never have the hoop going around anything but your waist.

I do think the kind of hoop you have is important.  I like my Trim Hoop, but I'm discovering that it's a bit too big and heavy to get the most out of this workout.  The people who made this dvd also sell a smaller hoop, and I think I'll eventually get around to buying it.",1440460800,,1452,4.340740740740741
