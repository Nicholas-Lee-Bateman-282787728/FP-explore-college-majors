2430776,1,B000BNXD5A,"I cannot believe the reviewers who claim this is a good and historically accurate film.  Anyone who knows anything about what happened at Munich in 1972 will realize instantly that this film is a cheap dramatization designed to capitalize on interest in the recent terrorist attack at the Olympics.  This film absolutely sucks.  If you want the real story, read and then watch the book and film One Day In September.  Even the scenes in Steven Spielberg's Munich get parts of the story wrong.  Why?  I have no idea.  As if the real story wasn't dramatic enough that they had to change it.",1304899200,3,588,4.650485436893204

I was able to see this film, the tragic True story it tells of those Horrible events that took place In Munich, I have heard of Speilberg's Version of Events in his ""Munich"" and I have not seen nor do I plan to from what I hear Is His revisionist take on it.

2430780,4,B000BNXD5A,"I can tell you up front that ""21 Hours at Munich"" is a much more detailed look at that Olympic massacre in 1972 than you will find in Steven Spielberg's film ""Munich.""  In point of fact, Spielberg is not telling the story of what happened on September 5, 1972 in his film but exploring its aftermath.  This made for television movie aired in 1976 (in November, so it was after the Montreal Summer Olympics that year).  The release of the film two decades later was certainly motivated by the impending release of Spielberg's Oscar nominated film, but since it is an earnest dramatization of the events of that day, it will make an appropriate counterpart to the theatrical film.

The screenplay by Howard Fast (writer of the novel ""Spartacus"") and Edward Hume (""The Day After"") is based on Serge Groussard's book ""The Blood of Israel and focuses on what happened in Munich, part of what was then West Germany, that day in September when a group of Palestinian terrorists calling themselves Black September invaded the dormitory rooms of the Israeli athletes, killing two of them and taking another nine hostage.  Issa (Franco Nero), the leader of the terrorists, demands the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel, but Prime Minister Golda Meir (Else Quecke) flatly refused to deal with the terrorists. This left it to the German government to try and rescue the hostages.  Chief of Police Manfred Schreiber (William Holden) became the point man for their efforts, although Chancellor Willy Brandt (Richard Basehart) and Interior Minister Bruno Merk (Noel Willman) are involved in the fatal decisions as the lives of Jewish men are once again in the hands of the German government, this time with the whole world watching.  Having Holden take the lead role certainly invests the German effort with a level of competence, but this is not a story where the best intentions come to mean anything in the end.

If you were alive in 1972 then you probably still have a vivid memory of learning from ABC's sports anchor Jim McKay that despite early reports to the contrary all of the hostages were killed.  So it is given that when you watch this television movie that you know what is going to happen in the end.  At the time of the actual 21 hours of hostage drama we were only getting bits and pieces of what was actually happening, so ""21 Hours at Munich"" puts together the details in a vivid fashion.  But there is also a sense in which we watch this film trying to pick the key moments where things could have been different and all these deaths avoided.  I saw ""Munich"" today, and the first preview was for ""Flight 93,"" about the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania on September 11th.  I saw a television movie about the flight on cable last week and I found myself doing the same thing I did with ""21 Hours at Munich,"" trying to find a moment when if the passengers had acted the outcome might have been different (they waited until the plane was over rural country before making their move, sealing their fates while saving others, which is certainly their legacy).

A film that shows a group of men with their hands and feet tied being murdered by other men with machine guns and grenades obviously takes sides.  The film limits itself to this 21-hour period without getting into the politics that came before or after it.  Director William A. Graham (""Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones"") also takes sides by allow Issa to explain the goals and objectives of his group and people to the point that they become irrelevant because we can no longer get past the obvious fact that he and the other members of Black September are holding guns on hostages.  Then again, knowing that all of the hostages will be dead effectively poisons the pool.  But ultimately, ""21 Hours at Munich"" is a rather clinical record of what happened at that time and place, leaving the rhetoric and public debate to other films and other venues.",1139011200,42,3944,4.707848837209302

2430793,4,B000BNXD5A,"Television has always been quick to capitalize on real-life crime tragedies, and few such events were as earthshaking as the kidnapping of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics and the crime's eventual tragic resolution. 21 Hours at Munich is a surprisingly well made recreation of those events that boasts a cast considerably above the TV-movie norm.

William Holden stars as the German cop in charge of the investigation and negotiations, while Franco Nero plays the chief terrorist. Unlike Steven Spielberg's Munich, this movie concentrates solely on the crime itself, beginning by showing how the terrorists easily enter the Olympic Village and are able to subdue most of the members of the Israeli team. From there, it's a cat-and-mouse game of negotiations and threats between terrorists and police.

Holden is solid, and his casting was undoubtedly a coup for a TV movie of the week (the film was made immediately before he got his last Oscar nomination for Network). He makes no pretense at speaking with a German accent which some may find disconcerting, although if you are interested in what he is saying it shouldn't matter. His character is well aware of the importance of what they do and how the world will view it, which leads to eventual bickering among the police, military, and political leaders (including Richard Basehart as Willy Brandt).

Similarly, Nero is solid and grounded. The movie wisely avoids turning him into a wide-eyed fanatic; instead, he is a professionally determined man with a dangerous political agenda. By keeping the two leads as competent, solid professionals, the movie is able to build suspense, even if the eventual resolution is well known in advance.

21 Hours at Munich is a well grounded film that does not attempt to look at the wider picture of Mideast terrorism or the overall politics of the time. Instead, it's a solid, gripping procedural that, despite the limited budget of a TV-movie, succeeds at showing how a horrible crime happened step by step from beginning to end.",1387929600,6,2036,5.050595238095238
2430794,4,B000BNXD5A,"Interesting movie!  For as late in his career as william holden made this movie, it was done well!  I never knew what and why this attack at the Olympics happened.",1381104000,,163,4.4
2430795,5,B000BNXD5A,For a movie released in 1976 it still had an impact on me and gave me a good understanding of the incident. The actors portrayal was not over dramatic so it kept my interest with also adding actual clips from the 1972 Munich Olympics.,1378684800,,234,4.340909090909091
2430796,1,B000BNXD5A,"This is a low budget movie that is so ""see through""  .  . . . . . horrible acting ... poor set design",1363737600,,101,3.347826086956522
2430797,3,B000BNXD5A,"Obviously it's better to just watch Spielberg's ""Munich"". This movie is outdated by now. Sure, it deals with the arab terrorist attack on israeli athlete's, which is just as important to see in the 70's as in any other time. I just believe that when it comes to presenting history in an accurate and objective manner, Spielberg had more budges, better actors, and more movie experience in presenting a great depiction than this.",1363046400,,428,4.876712328767123
2430798,2,B000BNXD5A,"The best thing about this movie is that it was filmed at the actual places where the events took place. It is a very poorly acted movie. I suggest the documentary ""One Day in September"" which has a lot of actual news footage from the incident.",1357430400,5,243,4.304347826086956
2430799,1,B000BNXD5A,"After watching this movie for about 40 minutes, I had to turn it off because I was so distracted by the miscasting of William Holden as the German Chief of Police and Franco Nero as the Leader of (and Chief Negotiator for) the Palestinian Terrorists that I couldn't concentrate on the story being told.  Maybe my standzads are too high, but when actors portray characters of another country, I expect to hear accents and see mannerisms characteristic of that country.  Neither actor delivered in this regard.  William Holden played William Holden in this movie; every time I heard him speak, I had to remind myself that he was supposed to be portraying Germany's Police Chief, and not some American diplomat assigned to help resolve the Munich crisis.  Nero similarly failed to present a believable character; rather his French accent combined with the numerous close-ups of him (& his blue eyes) made me think of his role as Lancelot in Camelot (a characterization in which he was very convincing).  The movie (at least what I saw of it) did have some good points in authentically ""re-creating"" the clothing styles of the 1970's and in its ""snapshots"" of the Olympics environment, including its wide-angle aerial views of the Olympic Village & event spectators.  I also thought that the performances of Shirley Knight as a representative of the Olympics Committee and the woman who played Golda Meir were pretty credible.",1356998400,3,1422,4.9789029535864975
2430800,5,B000BNXD5A,This is an excellent video. It met all the expectations and I was indeed pleased. I also encourage those history fanatics to seek this video and follow the cause of history as it happened.,1347494400,,188,4.5588235294117645

Shirley Knight played an intermediary between the Arab kidnappers and terrorists and the Germans. Based on the true story, the film was shot on location in Munich, Germany. The actors did a fantastic job in recreating a harrowing ordeal where the end was just tragic.

The film has an all-star cast including William Holden, Shirley Knight, Franco Nero and Richard Basehart. The DVD doesn't come with an extra special features.

This is a dramatic recreation of the events that occurred in 1972 at the XX Olympiad in Munich. It was filmed in West Germany. The hope of the Olympic contests was to show how countries could live in peace while competing in sports. [Arent these sports a peaceful form of combat? They entertain people of all classes and countries.] Early in the morning of September 17, 1972 intruders scale fences to enter the Israeli compound with their luggage. They have military weapons! They use keys to unlock doors. One man tries to stop them at the door. Another escapes through a window to spread the alarm of Arab terrorists. Two men see a shooting! The Israeli athletes are rounded up. One man escapes, there is shooting! The German police are warned, they take action to isolate the building. The Black September movement has demands to release prisoners in Israel and give them an airplane to leave the country. Or the hostages will die! A woman Olympic security guard is sent to talk to them.

The building is surrounded. German officials try to speak to them and ask for more time. The Israeli government will not make any concessions because of the example it will set. This crime is a German problem says Prime Minister Meir. Do any of the captives need a doctor? The terrorists are warned they will all be killed if they kill the hostages. We are not afraid to die says a terrorist. We will be happy to oblige says a German official. They are offered cash and a safe exit if they free the hostages. Should the Olympics be cancelled? Or suspended? The terrorists want three planes to fly them to Cairo. They will accept one plane, but it will take time to prepare for a long flight. The Germans want to know how many hostages are alive. There are nine. The Germans also counted the terrorists. They want the Egyptians to save the Israelis when the plane lands in Cairo. This is refused; its not an Egyptian problem. A helicopter will transport the Fedayeen and the hostages to the airport. Trained marksmen will await them in concealed positions.

There is an underground passage from the building to where the helicopters are waiting. The leader inspects the helicopters, then asks for a bus for transport. He admits they plan to kill the hostages! What does the world think of their actions? The Germans plan to attack when the Fedayeen and the hostages arrive at the helicopters. The plane will never leave the ground. There are eight Fedayeen on the bus. It arrives at the field, they enter the two helicopters. They land at the airport. The helicopter pilots are taken hostage. There are no pilots on the plane. Weve been tricked! The sharpshooters start firing, not all targets are hit. They are told to surrender, but they keep shooting. The Fedayeen leader throws hand grenades into a helicopter, another man fires his machine gun into the other helicopter. The Bavarian police neutralize the remaining Fedayeen. Help us overcome hatred. Later the remaining Fedayeen were traded for captive Germans. They were treated as heroes when they reached Tripoli.

Since then the security at the Olympiads was increased. The world has seen more and worse massacres for political purposes. What can stop men who are willing to die to accomplish their mission? Only other armed men who can defend against these terrorists. There will never be any safe gun free zones anywhere in any town, now and in the future. This happened over 45 years ago, most people now alive weren't born then. This is a history lesson, we hope it will never happen again. What could have been done to save the hostages? By preventing it in the first place.",1452816000,,3662,4.726134585289515
