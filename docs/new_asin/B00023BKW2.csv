It is fast paced  (the DVD only lasts 10 minutes) unfortunately it goes into too much detail about the language. I was hoping it included a catchy song but it really is just instruction. Overall I would use it in my classroom as it adds a more creative element to teaching.",1209600000,,351,4.484375
