Evan made this as a high school senior project.  Throughout most of it, he was 17.  It won three awards at film festivals in the ""Documentary"" category - not the Student Film category.  He competed against the big boys.

Evan gets it right at the beginning - he calls it ""a love story,"" and it is.  His father is amazed that such a young man had such sensitivity to his subject and his interviewees.  It premiered in showings to 1,100 people.  It was fun as a dad to see people who came to see a ""student film,"" therefore not having especially high expectations, get sucked into the film in the first 30 seconds, and stay on the edge of their seats for the rest of it.

At the end, there was a cheering standing ovation.  Then Evan took the stage in the spotlight, and people remembered that this was a film made by a student, but by no means a ""student film.""  The place went nuts, and Dad was in the back row, tears flowing.  Proud doesn't begin to cover it.

Swanzey is a small town, and wants to stay that way - it wants to retain its Rural Character.  Nevertheless, it is full of interesting people, and we found many of them to tell stories.  I think you'll enjoy it.  We certainly enjoyed making it.

As of 10/2015, Evan works as an Apprentice Editor for documentarian Ken Burns.  Evan's dream-come-true.",1445385600,,1362,4.376
