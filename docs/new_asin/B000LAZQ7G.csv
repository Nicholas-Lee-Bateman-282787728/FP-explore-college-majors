8160482,5,B000LAZQ7G,This is a great video for teaching the outcomes of a healthy and an unhealthy diet and exercise program.  The video stars an African American family consisting of a mother and father with two boys in Elementary school.  They love to eat junk food and order food in most of the time.  The family learns how to eat right and exercise and how that new lifestyle will positively affect the way they will look and feel in the years to come.  I highly recommend this video!,1195862400,4,467,4.395348837209302

As a nutritionist, I loved ""the rules"" and beleve anyone can improve their health and diet by following the rules in this episode.  My favorite scene is when they discover that one of the family members broke the tv limit rule.  We all guessed who it was!!!",1178928000,5,401,4.527777777777778
