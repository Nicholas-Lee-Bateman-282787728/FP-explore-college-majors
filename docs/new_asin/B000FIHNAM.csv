8122958,3,B000FIHNAM,"We just watched this video with my kids who are 11 and 13. They loved the Shakespeare DVD and are hugely into history. This one isn't as comical as the Shakespeare show, but still funny. The guy who vomits was missed. There seemed to me to be more ""randy"" humor in this one.  Some of the humor points out our hipocrasy which makes for good conversation, but isn't as light as the Shakespeare version.",1265760000,,400,4.405405405405405
8122959,5,B000FIHNAM,"For anyone who has ever fallen asleep in history class...
You need to buy this DVD.
Reed Martin, Austin Tichenor, And Matthew croke are So Hilariously funny in this DVD. They cover over 500 years of history in only 90 minutes and do a lot of Audience interaction (Which, if you're Familiar with the Reduced Shakespeare company, is not uncommon.)
There is no Bad part. From the Beginning with the ""Amerigo Vespucii Operatta"" to the Suprise ""Special guest"" you will NOT be dissapointed.
MUST SEE.",1245888000,,494,4.823529411764706
