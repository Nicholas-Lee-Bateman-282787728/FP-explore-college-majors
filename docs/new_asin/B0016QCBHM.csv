8264130,5,B0016QCBHM,"Beautiful, visually stunning and incredibly sad.  This just might be the most heartbreaking movie I have ever seen. Poor Matsuko. What a tragic figure. I loved, empathesized, cared for, and felt sorry for Matsuko like no other character I've ever seen in a film. I can't believe more people have not reviewed this film. Its highly original and beautiful to look at but if you are looking for escapist entertainment this is not the film to watch. I loved the director's earlier film Kamikaze Girls but this movie is way beyond that. Matsuko gives so much to others, especially the men she loves, but gets nothing but abuse and tragedy in return.  As she asks plaintively more than once, ""Why?""  We often ask that question ourselves due to life  being so often totally unfair. But Matsuko has touched more lives than she imagined, even after her death, in regards to her nephew. It is truly about what you give not what you receive. I could not help but cry at the end.  This movie really moved me deeply.",1420243200,3,1003,4.612359550561798
