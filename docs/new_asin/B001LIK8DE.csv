8318158,3,B001LIK8DE,"In the third and final installment of Italy's 'Policewoman' series (the first two aren't available in NTSC format at time of review) starring the wonderful Edwige Fenech, the location moves to NYC for it's farcical premise to infiltrate the New York mob using Fenech and her partner to assume the roles of a mob boss and his moll. You see, as luck would have it, they just happen to be dead ringers for them (see where this is going? I thought you might). After the police imposters take their place, there`s little else to do except to resort to cornball antics, bathroom humor, cartoon slapstick and slurs at the expense of gays, blacks, stutterers, Arabs, American Indians, among others. (One could almost hear the ghosts of Moe, Larry and Curly nyuck, nyuck, nyucking in the background...) On the plus side, Edwige provides a stellar showing of her comedic abilities that saves the film at points, and wears several outfits that showcase her attributes admirably. She`s always a joy in her movies, even the bad ones, so if you`re a fan, it`s a no-brainer. I`m a fan, but I don't enjoy physical humor or sight gags much, so it gets tedious quickly. On the down side, she`s never nude except for a brief topless scene, but manages to be sexy regardless. If you liked the American 'Police Academy' series, you`ll enjoy this one. Me? I loathed them, hence the 3 stars, and they're all for Edwige Fenech.",1272844800,5,1403,4.7073170731707314
