431103,5,6302152496,This movie was very enjoyable. Anyone who has interests in WW2 and understands the similarities and differences between the US and UK will like this story. Very representative of the times.,922492800,3,189,5.129032258064516
431221,5,6302152496,"Opening Narration: ""From early 1942 until the invasion of Europe over a million Americans landed in Britain. They came to serve on other battle fronts or to man the vast number of U.S. bases in England. Hardly a city, town or village remained untouched."" Or as the Brits said about the American invasion of Yanks...""Oversexed, overpaid and over here!""  This is an excellent John Schlesinger portrayal of the interaction of deployed American soldiers with the British - in particular the British women - during the lead up to the D-Day invasion of France. It is set on an American base located near a small northern English town. The film is not rated as highly by the critics as some of his other films - ""Midnight Cowboy"", ""Marathon Man"", etc; but I think it tells the WW II story of Americans in Britain better than any other I've seen. It stars a young Richard Gere - whose star was ascending in 1979 - and an ensemble cast that included Vanessa Redgrave, Lisa Eichhorn, William Devane and Chick Vennera...all of whom deliver fine performances, with special kudos going to Gere, Eichhorn and Redgrave. The primary romance is between Gere and Eichhorn (in her first movie role); but the romance between a fortyish Redgrave and Devane also features prominently. There is some battle footage, but not much; this is primarily a romantic drama set in a wartime environment...and secondarily a social commentary about the effect of this kind of deployment on the civilian population. I enjoyed it thoroughly...and highly recommend it! -",1492300800,2,1533,4.918918918918919

I thought they only rated him so highly because he was so beautiful and  didn't bother with him back then.  However, between Hachi  and Yanks I am finding out he is just too beautiful inside and out  not  to watch his movies.  In this movie he shows such a wide range of emotion and I was shocked to see just how well he can relate sensitivity on the screen.  I loved this movie because the story was so interesting and I got to see his gorgeous face so many times.  He really is able to convey emotion better than anyone else on the screen.  It is a very touching movie and  the sets are so well done that you actually feel you are back in time.

431635,1,6302152496,"I've read all of the other positive reviews about this movie, YANKS, and based on those positive reviews, I bought this movie and was all for settling in for a good WW2 wartime tale.

Man, I have no idea what movie all these other AMAZON.COM reviewers are all talking about! Aside from some amazing British cinematography and some faithful WW2 set recreations and costuming, this movie is just plain boring! I mean, it literally felt like the movie was on for six hours and it felt like the director of this snooze-fest would never ever run out of film for this flick. This is truly a shame because there is the potential for so much great laughter, adventure, and some amazing wartime love affairs can be had here, but the story goes absolutely nowhere.

Plus, the cover is so misleading! There are no Nazis or amazing aerial dog-fights or stuff blowing up in this movie at all. Come to think of it, there are no actual combat situations in this movie...Well, other than some racist white U.S. soldiers almost killing another black American service man for dancing with a British white woman at a military dance hall. Yeah, that was a big turn off for me! Still, since the movie takes place in England, there should have been dozen of air raids and bombs being dropped all over London.

It would have been really cool and would've been way more interesting to show brave American soldiers defending British cities from incoming German bombers. Cliched as it sounds, there should have been single and pretty British women and lonely American soldiers  trapped under the rubble together, finding love, leaning on each other, trusting each other until help arrives.

Man...Let me stop trying to help this forgettable flop of a film be better. What's done is done. However, please do keep this film if you have problems sleeping at night. That's what I'm using mine for...Lol...",1386374400,,1875,4.7746913580246915

431638,3,6302152496,"I remember being disappointed by ""Yanks"" when it was first released in 1979. Now I have seen it again nearly 35 years later, and my opinion has not changed.

First, the positive news. The staging, editing, and photography are top notch, with a keen eye for period detail. Some of the acting is quite good too, especially Lisa Eichhorn (as Jean Moreton) and Tony Melody (as her dad, Jim Moreton).

But the negatives dominate. The script (by Colin Wellan and Walter Bernstein) is inferior in every way, with a predictable story and far too many stereotypes for my liking. Most of the Americans are loudmouthed braggarts, and I was just waiting for the inevitable scenes of racial bigotry that seem to infest all such tales of Yanks in Britain. It should have had no part in this story. Indeed, if the script had stuck to a love triangle among Jean, Matt, and Ken, all would have been much better -- instead of trying to tackle the whole of WWII in a single bite.

Dialogue is laughably clichd throughout, and I cannot understand why Richard Gere is considered to be a capable actor. Neither is William Devane much good here. Score big points for the superiority of British acting over the Americans. Worst of all, and a lethal weakness, I sensed absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between Mr. Gere and Ms. Eichhorn. How anyone could fail to fall madly in love with Lisa Eichhorn, in person or on screen, is beyond me, but Gere somehow managed to do it. What a dud performance. Too bad because his character could have been rather likable. Instead, all he ever talked about was Arizona, and I could not see any reason for Jean to have become interested in him.

Don't waste your time on ""Yanks"" unless you want to enjoy a nice performance by the sweet, lovely Lisa Eichhorn. I wish the movie could have been about Jean and Ken (Derek Thompson). Now, that would have been worth watching -- though of course the title would have to be changed!",1368748800,,1938,4.608695652173913

431643,4,6302152496,"This movie is a little fragmented, but the whole story is about the whirlwind impact of a huge number of GI's on a small English village. There is no war in this war movie except a little bomb damage. My husband kept waiting for something with action to happen, as it was a ""war movie"".

This not an action flick but a romance and an exploration of cultural contrast between the reserved English and brash Americans stationed at a base in Northern England. The English are noticeably worn from several years of war but have a dry sense of humor and keep pressing on regardless. You understand that the first World War had a huge local impact on the village and some of the older English, but not much relevance to the Americans. It's not their history and they are living in the here and now. The Americans are young and sometimes insensitive and boorish, sort of an early version of ugly Americans abroad. But they are also depicted as generous and can be considerate once they get a clue. Certainly they are also scared of what is to come and looking for distraction, especially with English women. The movie is about three American soldier's romances in England. The path of love is far from smooth for either side. This is a long film that leaves you wondering who might have survived, who returned with a war bride to U.S., or whether anyone ever saw each other again after that brief intense period.

Richard Gere is a very young man in this film. He acts his part, not a part written for a big star. And he is so fresh and attractive.

Period details are intermixed with a few anachronisms. I was convinced the the cooling towers in several background scenes were from a nuclear power plant. But coal fired plants of that era used the same design, so they are right in there with no explanation. There is supposed to be a longer version of 165 minutes vs. 138 or 139 minutes, but I have never seen it. It might fill in more back story details on the characters. It's a nice film for a leisurely evening's viewing. But it is a straight VHS transfer. There are no menu functions for subtitles, language or scene selection, etc.
There are no close captions on this DVD.",1360281600,,2173,4.482323232323233

431704,4,6302152496,"I had to view this movie for a college course on World War II. The movie was actually done very well. It seemed to portray the American Soldiers and their ""invasion"" of Britain in a accurate manner. For those wanting fast action and battles this is a fore warning, this movie is not that type of war movie. It all takes place in Britain while the American Soldiers are waiting to begin the Normandy invasion, showing how the locals felt about the brash and bold US Soldiers.
Overall, I liked it. There were a few sexual scenes, so I would not recommend it for kids or teenagers.",1349654400,,578,4.411214953271028
431705,4,6302152496,"This is a different kind of war movie in that is has little to do with war or the military. They are simply backdrops for the real theme of the movie which is, as the title states, the issue of Americans or Yanks in England during the buildup to Normandy who interacted with the locals. The movie begins with Richard Gere's unit arriving in northern England to join others already there. His character is a cook but that is really irrelevant. Very quickly the movie shifts from Army matters to situations in which he and his buddy start to date local women. There are three situations. A supply officer from the unit has been seeing an aristocratic local women who works for the Red Cross. Both are married. The woman's spouse is off to the war. Gere's buddy is a big talker who hooks up with an energetic local girl eager to meet an American soldier. Gere starts to date a reluctant daughter of shop owners who has her own fiancee away at the war. Most of the scenes in the movie are quite gray and the tone of the movie is reserved, if not depressing at times. As one would expect, many cross-cultural and separation themes are covered in the movie. Some of the scenes seem a bit too long and inconsequential while others are very touching and emotion-filled. The movie ends with the Americans leaving and each story having its own set of circumstances under which the cross-cultural couples part.

While I would not call the movie one of the most memorable war movies I have seen, it was certainly quite different than most. It made me want to know more about the issue of soldiers overseas who formed relationships with locals and what happened to these long-term. Often we think of war as being a series of famous battles and we forget the long weeks or years of preparation and the time spent getting by in foreign locales. This is a lesser-known Richard Gere movie. I had not even heard about it before seeing it advertised here on Amazon. If you enjoyed his work in An Officer and a Gentleman, you might like this movie.

It does not take the side of the American or the British point of view, which is great; it both upholds and points out the flaws of both. The atmosphere it creates of the time and place it is set in is amazing. The acting is mostly top-notch as evidenced by the Golden Globe nominations for Lisa Eichhorn and the BAFTA award that went to the late Rachel Roberts, not to mention the multitude of BAFTA awards and wins the film achieved. Some may not like the ending (which I won't reveal), but it is exactly how it should have ended and the viewer ends up feeling just as the characters and people who lived through these events had to have felt.

And if anyone can tell me the name of the hymn sung in the church scene as the Americans are leaving I would be most grateful!!",1327449600,2,897,4.215116279069767

There were so many G.I.'s that it ""seemed the little isle would sink"", so someone (I can't remember who) wrote. The leading roles played by Richard Gere and Eichhorn are perfection in themselves. Richard Gere is a sensitive, homesick soldier who has found the love of his life right there on British soil, and there wasn't a thing he could do about it. For people my age, being able to listen to the music brought back a thousand memories. The end of the movie is bittersweet.

431710,2,6302152496,"This film is chick flick lite set in the midst of gorgeous and stunningly accurate production details.  If you just turned off the sound and watched it you'd be fine and what's more, you'd also be able to easily follow the general line of the two romances, so called, because they've been done before ad nauseum. Substituting melodrama for romance, the two central relationships are unbelievabe, trite, and silly and each ""love scene"" is accompanied by jarringly tender music, just in case the viewer needs a cue. Richard Gere plays the same role he's played in so many other films -- ""It won't be long before you succumb to my intrinsic irresistibility and begin to love me as much as I love myself"" -- and one cannot possibly imagine what the gorgeous, classy Vanessa Redgrave character sees in the unattractive William Devane whose lines are equally trite and arrogant.  Sure, I get it, the Yanks were overconfident, but the screenwriters really bombed when it came to writing Devan's part.  Either that or he just bombed in the delivery.  Probably a combination of both.

The film often jumps from one scene to another with no apparent attempt at keeping alive an interesting storyline and the overblown music often threatens to smother the dialogue, which for Americans trying to understand real British actors can pose a problem.  As has been mentioned in another review, the enormous amounts of time that these soldiers spent on their new British girlfriends is way off the mark: apart from one very cool scene where a group of servicemen are obviously prepping for the invasion, these Americans do nothing but flirt and date.

The film, however, is loaded to the brim with realistic touches, so much so that it feels as if the viewer had been dropped into pre-D-Day Britain and which makes this a great film for WWII history buffs with a particular interest in this time/place.  And the acting, for the most part, is decent, especially that of Redgrave (of course) and Lisa Eichhorn, who both give very good performances. Why they fell for these particular Yanks is believable only because they were lonely but once begun, these romances are inspid and go nowhere. Perhaps the screenwriters ran out of time or the filmmakers were hoping that audiences would swallow anything when presented with a film about love and war.",1319500800,,2329,4.878481012658228

431773,5,6302152496,"I saw this film on HBO in the early eighties when I was still in high school.  I had a connection to this era as I was deep into American history and especially of this time. So I would consider I originally had a bias the first time I saw it.

I was enchanted by Lisa Eichorn, the character she played and the relationship between Vanessa Redgrave and William Devane.  It was nice to see a film about war, the vulnerability Brits must have felt with the Yank invasion and what everyone did to adapt.

The Gere/Eichorn relationship appealed to me at that age.  Looking back it was probably because of his generosity and sensitivity and her vulnerability. With Devane/Redgrave, it felt like I was watching 2 adults talking in a way that wasn't insulting to my age.  They seemed to mirror something real. Probably that walking of the fine line of desire and need.

I liked how Schlesinger treated his actresses.  That Devane isn't Hollywood handsome and that Redgrave enjoys the presence of his masculinity.  A smart woman knows how to lean into this (especially during hard times) in order to keep her spirit fed.

I watched the film on DVD last night.  The enchantment is still there.  It's lovely to see with the eyes I have now",1304380800,,1229,4.561643835616438

I found the scenes mostly authentic, yet some quite trivial sights jarred me out of that world of that time.  I won't mention them because, as I say, they're trivial, and I wouldn't want to spoil the experience for others who might happily miss them.
-
Though I say it was too romanticized, it seemed to hold admirably to likely events, including the male protagonist's indecision, then refusal, to consummate his relationship with his opposite.  The contact between North Americans and the English---people of cousin tribes---and the reactions and dialogue that flow from such meetings kept me interested and reasonably immersed in the story.
-
Real events would have painted a quite different picture, I think, and I have seen another movie set in that time and place which portrays a more true-to-life story than 'Yanks' does.  (One scene---in this other movie---is of a middle class Englishman arriving home to express revulsion at what he's just seen out in the street:  the presence of American soldiers of ethnicities that he believed to be inferior (in whatever ways), an attitude common, normal and unquestioned during those times.  Another is of a petite English girl being told by her buxom cousin that her American beau hasn't read her letters because ""he can't read"".)

It's an okay film (though rather depressing) as far as love stories go, but did the Yanks really have all that time to go to the movies, fool around with girls, go on holidays, go to pubs, dances, and parties, etc.? If so, I find it kind of surprising the invasion was a success. My father was billeted with a family in Wales during WW II and when I told him about all the time they spent fooling around he just laughed. He said they spent most of the time being taught everything they could be to be prepared. I'm sure they had some free time but I think it's overdone in this film.

431776,5,6302152496,"This film has always been rather special to me as when I was a 1977-1978 Audiology graduate student from Calif. @ Univ. Manchester in the north of England, I was one of the G.I. ""extras"" recruited in a Manchester ""cattle-call"" for real Americans (which in those days were a rarity in Manchester!) Our dept. secretary told me about it and needing a few extra quid, I got a G.I. haircut that first day I remember (back then neck length hair was the fashion, so at first it all was a bit of a shock). Myself and another few Americans (one whom I am still best friends with to this day)ended-up as being the ""regular"" extras and spent quite a bit of time in the film on location in both Yorkshire and London.  People might be surprised to know that this whole film was shot on a budget of only $6 million (which was actually quite a max for the majority of British films in the 70's so I am told).  Anyway, as an American having lived in England (as a student vs the film's soldier)I thought the movie was absolutely dead-on accurate and wonderfully filmed capturing both the American perspective and English perspective of the war period and how they intertwined.  The most amazing & serendipity aspect of this movie (for me) was that a fellow graduate student  S---- I had been dating back in Calif. and corresponding with while I was at Manchester, had asked me to look up her uncle who was a dentist in Liverpool, who was the brother of her deceased English Mom. (I had known S----sister J--years earlier in Jr High and knew their dad was an American from Arizona who had met and married an English girl during the war).  Well it wasn't till I got back to Calif. in '78 after filming wrapped-up that summer that I got back together with S---- and she told me about a writer interviewing her Dad some time back about his war-time romance (not knowing that the story would be an eventual screenplay). I just thought my review would be of interest to those who enjoyed the film and wondered if this was a true war-time love story, it is!

431777,4,6302152496,"In 1979 the nostalgia about the second world war was slightly displaced but could easily be explained by the defeat in Vietnam in 1975 and all the films about the horror this war in Vietnam was. Let's compensate slightly and enjoy WW2 when the Yanks were welcomed (kind of) in Europe and expected to give a good spanking to the Germans, if not the Nazis, or vice versa. But there is no Kwai river in Europe. So let us make it sentimental and evoke the meeting of the Yanks with their distant British cousins in England getting ready for the second front and then the third. So the whole film is given some life with its being centered on the relation between one man from Arizona and one girl from the small city where the Yanks are camping. Possible and impossible passion at the same time, possible in the mind and impossible in the body because of the immense chasm between the two worlds, the two civilizations. It is a little pathetic, and yet probably true. A culture that says the girl of another man is sacred and a woman from another world has to be tamed and introduced with time and in time, not taken and used for a short while and forgotten when departure day arrives. You add to that the difficult relation between some white GIs and the black GIs, plus the impossibility for the other white GIs who are not openly hostile to the black GIs, hence who are not openly racist, to prevent or stop the racist provocation and then fight. Does it make a good film? It would have been good in the 50s. But four years after the defeat in Vietnam it is slightly too romantic and even simplistic to really erase the humiliation of 1975. The film 30 years later becomes slightly too sweet to be digestible. For having lived up to 1965 with GIs in my city and having seen their disruptive presence every Sunday along the embankments of the harbor, alcohol, prostitution, and a few other things of the type, I can testify it was probably a lot more drastic and sinister in England, in war time, waiting for the front, knowing that they may never come back from it. The film then appears idyllic, and in a way weak.

Granted, the only time you see shooting is when they are training (with live ammo) for D-Day.  But it's a great insight into what life was like not only for the American troops but also for the British citizens when hundreds of thousands soldiers suddenly arrived in Britain.  Excellent characters just keep popping up, maybe for a scene or two, but you don't forget them (particularly the mourning father in the pub).

Great little love stories, too.  Richard Geer gives an outstanding performance as a man who struggles -- does he really want to go full throttle with a girl when he may soon die in combat, and she's already lost her fiance to the War?  William Devane also shines as the Army officer whose spends quite a bit of time with the very-married ""donut dolly.""  The other performance that stands out is Rachel Roberts, who is so not happy to see her daughter cavorting with a Yank.

This is a grown up movie like we rarely see anymore. It is made for audiences that know a little bit about love and life. The movie is character driven and based on a fine script. Every aspect of the production is finely mounted. Great performances also. Especially by the British players.

There are no extras on this DVD which is fine with me. It's not the greatest movie ever made and no one needs to know much about it. In my opinion, unless a movie is a time tested classic, the extras are just that. Extras. Sometimes the extras even spoil the illusion of our favorite movies.

This is a leisurely, realistic film that haunts the mind long after you've seen it with its atmospheric settings and its depictions of love under stress. The acting is uniformly excellent, with Lisa Eichhorn standing out as the pretty English girl torn between two men, one her hometown boyfriend, now fighting in Burma, the other a US Army sergeant newly stationed in England, played by Richard Gere. Then there is the often repressed, adult relationship between US officer William Devane and musician Vanessa Redgrave, both of them married, yet finding in one another a much-needed, if temporary, attachment.

Heavy on atmosphere, which is done quite nicely, and buoyed by good performances, the movie is low key, but resilient with the feelings of the British and the Yanks during this crucial time in WWII.  Richard Gere is very good as Matt, the sensitive, polite soldier who finds himself falling for English shopkeeper Lisa Eichhorn, but is afraid of the commitment once the relationship becomes serious.  Eichhorn is beautiful and parlays that fragile beauty into a sympathetic and engaging character.  The movie's other romantic duo isn't given as much screen time, but Vanessa Redgrave does a marvelous job as the Red Cross volunteer who is becoming close to dashing William Devane.  Redgrave's skills as a character actress enable her to bring more depth into the role than was written.  Two other performances of note are Rachel Roberts as Eichhorn's mother and Wendy Morgan as the bus steward who ends up marrying one of the Yanks (a comic Chick Venerra).

All the actors have a freshness in their roles.  I don't know if Richard Gere every played a more grounded, real character.  Vanessa Redgrave has a bittersweet role as the married woman who enjoys a dalliance with dashing American William Devane.

Although the writing is not going to set anyone on fire with excitement, the subject and the emotions of the characters are handled well. All the leads (Gere, DeVane, Eichorn, Redgrave) are at their best, although Eichorns performance does show some signs of the fact it is her debut.
The film works as entertainment rather than art, and is more an interesting study of the impact of loneliness than as a historical piece. In essence, the film could have been an hour long and acheived all that it does. Having said that, it can hold your attention for the full runnning time, and only one or two scenes are really unnecessary (such as the racist fight scenes at the dance).
Overall, I quite liked this film, and it was quite refreshing to have Yorkshire accented English people alongside Americans (although Eichorn's accent is terrible!) rather than the ubiquitous cockneys we usually get.
My main criticism is that it would work better on TV, by which I mean it is too fragmented. For instance the relationship between Redgrave and her son at school and the effect of an absent father figure, is touched on but not fully explored.  The characters could have been much better exploited in this format, giving the audience more opportunity to care and become involved. Mini-series, people!

Richard Gere is usually typecast as a stud, but in this film, he's more of a normal person, and he plays the part perfectly. This might be his best acting film.
The other actors are great, too: Vanessa Redgrave,William Devane, Chick Venerra, Lisa Eichorn and her parent, and her friend. The film is so believable and atypical of Hollywood films because the actors act naturally with no superficialities.
The plot is wonderful. My father was in England before the D-Day invasion, and he told me lots of stories about England. I've read that many American GI's actually fell in love and married English women, mainly because of the similarities of cultures and the nature of English women: they were sincere about love.
The music score is lush and tantalizing, reminding me of Aaron Copland's music. It greatly enhanced the movie's plot. I had just finished watching and adoring The Americanization of Emily, and watchingYanks was a real treat for me. Why doesn't Hollywood make more natural love story movies like Yanks, instead of weird provocative ones? Yanks should have won Oscars. I give it five stars.

I was a teen then, just beginning to develop beyond the juvenile taste in films, and this picture captured both my attention and (surprisingly) my heart. I'm sure that it greatly affected my views on relationships and romance.
The more I see YANKS, the more impressed I am by the subtleties at play among the characters. Several of the cast are particular standouts: Lisa Eichhorn, with her innocent charm and stunning natural beauty. William Devane, with his quirky humor and conservatively earnest manner. And then there's marvelously playful Vanessa Redgrave, who brings such vitality and spunk to her role (and painfully struggles to balance her loyalties and friendships with the men in her life).
Also, I don't think I have ever seen a picture that is more accurate in period detail -- and that includes TITANIC. The costumes, the sets and locations, the background props, and the photographic style of the movie are completely absorbing and will take you back to another era. It's gorgeous.

431831,4,6302152496,"I'm giving this release of 'Yanks' 4 out of 5 stars, mainly because the DVD doesn't feature any subtitles, closed captioning, or extra features/deleted scenes.  In any case, it is a rather poignant movie on a subject not depicted or given much mention in most World War Two films and history books: the romantic relationships between American servicemen and British women in late WW2, pre D-Day Britain.

'Yanks' is probably my one and only favorite film with Richard Gere in a starring role.  His portrayal of Sgt. Matt Dyson (a former short-order cook from Arizona) is very believable and quite sincere.  It is definitely my favorite Lisa Eichhorn film, as I developed a bit of crush on her after seeing this movie on HBO as a teenager in the early 80s.  Maybe it was her convincing and delightful British accent that did it for me--though later, much to my surprise, I found out she's really a ""Yank""!

Production-wise, the film features a very haunting and beautiful film score by Richard Rodney Bennett.  Anne Shelton's rendition of ""I'll Be Seeing You"" during the end credits is quite touching and memorable.

Wartime romance film buffs and Richard Gere/Lisa Eichhorn fans should definitely buy this DVD despite the lack of extra features, though there are rumors of a longer version of this film or over 30 minutes of deleted scenes in the studio vaults or somewhere in the archives of the film's director, the late John Schlesinger.  For now, this 2005 DVD version will have to fit the bill.

7821825,4,6302152496,"Its been years since Ive watched this movie. I enjoyed it immensely as Ive always been drawn to World War ll romance movies. This one was in the top five. But, that was when I had full hearing. I recently purchased this DVD to add to my collection. To my dismay this disc is not CC or subtitled so therefore I am unable to understand most of the dialogue. Reason being...I am now hard of hearing. The release date for this movie to DVD was 2010 which should have had both CC and subtitles. I will contact Amazon with my complaint.",1514678400,,530,4.257425742574258
