One great advantage to this Uh.... Movie is we get to see the hokey creatures up front. The story unfolds fast and the plot is set up front. Then we get to see it unfold. Sort of like an old Colombo (Peter Falk) show where everyone knows the culprit in advance. We also get some really bad background music with a 50's feel.

Professor King (Michael Whalen) dabbles with the forces of nature and gets the standard results. His daughter Lois (Cathy Downs) of course knows nothing about it; if she had only known in time. Lois and Dr. King are perused by a technical investigator, Dr. Ted Stevens (Kent Taylor.)

Someone is dispatching people with a scuba spear. Who and why. Just what is the secret?

I wanted to give this movie one star but on reflection I really watched it.

Remember:
