6075940,5,B00GHH9GXC,"I watched this as a kid and  thought it was okay. But watching it back recently as an adult I thought it was actually ten-times better! The storylines were a little more mature than you'd usually get in Power Rangers. Each episode is awesome. Bulk and Skull are at their absolute best in this series. It's actually one of the few PR Seasons that stands out in awesomeness. I recommend getting both volumes.

I'm not power rangers fan like my brother, I'm a transformers fan but power ranger is okay but I will get lost galaxy that is my favorite power rangers season next to in space. Sorry about back to the review, his favorite episodes where the golden ranger comes & the original red ranger (jason) becomes the golden ranger. Finally, I like to say is that I would put a 5/5 if I were my brother, but me I would say 3/5",1421452800,,559,3.9557522123893807

8623161,5,B00GHH9GXC,"""Power Rangers: Zeo, Vol. 2"" continues following vol. 1. Highlights of this volume include ""The Power of Gold,"" which introduces the Gold Ranger. For most of his early episodes, the Gold Ranger's identity is a secret, with Billy and Tommy's brother being likely candidates. In the end, it's revealed that an alien named Trey of Triforia is the Gold Ranger. He could not maintain the powers, so he transferred them to Jason, the original Red Ranger. ""The Lore of Auric"" follows Auric the Conqueror, a character similar to Ninjor from ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"" season 3. Beginning with ""Where In the World is Zeo Ranger 5?,"" Tommy falls under the evil influence of the Machine Empire and faces a dream version of his former White Ranger identity. The ""Rangers of Two Worlds"" 2-part episode brings back the Alien Rangers from ""Mighty Morphin' Alien Rangers"" to help Billy, who is rapidly aging due to Master Vile's evil spell in the Alien Ranger mini-series. The Alien Rangers and the Zeo Rangers team up to fight together in this episode. It is also the final appearance of David Yost as Billy (though he only appears in archive footage). Yost departed the show due to the harassment the crew put him through on account of his sexuality. ""A Brief Mystery of Time"" is basically a ""Groundhog Day"" episode of Power Rangers and a lot of fun. Finally, this season also sees a significant subplot with Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd, who work against the Machine Empire to steal the Gold Rangers powers.",1503792000,,1497,4.8062015503875966
