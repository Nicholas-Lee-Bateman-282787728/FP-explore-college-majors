8444769,5,B004W8EG2Y,"As one of the speakers says, ""Pay attention!...if Americans as a whole want to prevent people from making out like bandits, if they want a tax system that treats them fairly and for the good of the country as a whole -  you can't avoid it, and you can't just complain about it.""
I guarantee you that this DVD, which explains the tax system from its very beginnings and show us how it went so wrong, and what needs to change, will make an impact on you. The video also is extremely well done, with an appropriate balance of serious discussion, clever animations and graphics, and historical footage. It is a fabulous and crucial film. Please not only get it - have home viewings for everyone you know!
""If the taxpayers demanded it, the politicians and the political leaders would respond and we could get a dramatically better tax system for everybody."" This is a non-partisan video, and it is something we all need to ""Pay attention"", to.",1327363200,,939,4.589285714285714
8444770,5,B004W8EG2Y,"Thoroughly enjoyed this doc about the broken tax code and the solutions to fix it.  While I don't agree with all of the politics of the interviewees, I appreciate the way the filmmakers handled the wide array of opinion around the topic.  They maintained a level of objectivity that is commendable in the age of Michael Moore.  I recommend this movie wholeheartedly for anyone who likes smart topics explored with an open mind and proposing tangible solutions to a real problem.  The interviewees cover all the political bases and each is allowed 4-5 minutes of soapbox screen time to make their case for the perfect solution.  With Steve Forbes, Mike Huckabee, and Noam Chomsky, as well as the former comptroller General and former head of the IRS, the film doesn't lack heavy hitters.  The film gets a little slow towards the middle, but overall very enjoyable.",1318982400,,863,4.876712328767123
8444771,5,B004W8EG2Y,"I really liked this documentary... I certainly don't identify with some of the famous names that were interviewed in this but I thought the film makers did a great jobs putting together a well-structured outline of the salient points: how taxes evolved and why, why they're now unmanageable, the possible alternative strategies proposed by various people/groups (fair vs. flat vs. etc)... Highly recommend !",1314403200,3,407,5.375
8444772,5,B004W8EG2Y,"Having seen this film in an earlier format, I found it an exceptionally well constructed appeal for us, as a nation, to get on with tax replacement; reform is not enough. We've 'reformed' the tax code uncounted times and it gets worse with every recent supposed reform. This is an excellent production.",1313712000,3,302,4.826923076923077
8444773,5,B004W8EG2Y,"What a compelling, engaging film! I just filed my taxes for 2011 and it reminded me all over again how incredibly ridiculous our tax code is, and why this film needed to be made. The film does a superb job of explaining how our tax code has become so complex, and providing smart, credible solutions for reform we so desperately need. Perfect timing, for Tax Day. You don't want to miss this!!!",1302739200,12,394,4.486111111111111
