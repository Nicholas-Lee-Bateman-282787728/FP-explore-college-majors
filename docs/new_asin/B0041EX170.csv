So I felt that he came to deserve her and the she did not choose him because he knocked her socks off with his good looks and muscles. Neil's filling the role by underacting was great. And Miss Padukone was superb, showing anger, determination, and hope. I liked this film!",1325635200,2,445,4.439024390243903
4241849,2,B0041EX170,"In Lafangey Parindey, The movie was made well with good screenshots and a good plot. even the cast that was Deepika Padukone & Neil Nitin Mukesh were pretty good, however there were a few setbacks in the film. The story was somewhat stretched and N.N.Mukesh couldn't play the role of a rowdy or 'lafanga' perfectly. the same goes for Deepika. Even the dialogues were a little cliched. but all in all it was a good bollywood  movie with scope to have don eso much better.",1300579200,,470,4.529411764705882
4241850,2,B0041EX170,"He boxes blindfolded, she's a blind dancer. He teaches her to see, she teaches him to feel--at least, that's what the movie tries, and fails, to convey. In fact, there's very little feeling in this latest glossy romance to come out of the Yash Raj production house.

The problems begin with the casting. The elegant Deepika Padukone was perfect as the dreamy starlet in 'Om Shanti Om' (2007) and a chic urbanite in 'Love Aaj Kal' (2009), but here she's too polished and put-together to pull off a rough-around-the-edges, working-class girl. And Neil Nitin Mukesh--who was gripping as a scared-witless college student in the terrorist thriller 'New York' (2009)--looks more like Bambi than a boxer.

That's not to say that Mukesh's dewy doe eyes and perfect bone structure doom him to play innocent boys-next-door. He's done gritty before and done it well--as a thief in the film noir 'Johnny Gaddaar' (2007) and as a tortured prisoner in 'Jail' (2009). In fact, those roles were likely deliberate moves on his part to prove he can play tough despite his appearance.

But the Yash Raj lens emphasizes Mukesh's sweet, squeaky-clean qualities--as it tends to do with everything. The Yash Raj world is a rosy place--the colors are brighter, life more festive, and the people more charming than they are in reality. That isn't necessarily a bad thing--it can be great entertainment, which the studio has proven with many movies over the years--but when you're doing a film set in Mumbai's rough-and-tumble back streets, it feels phony. And it's a missed opportunity to capture the nuances of that microcosm.

It's a challenge to connect to such unlikely characters in a superficial setting, as evidenced by the fact that the characters don't connect to each other. The actors flounder with their static parts, and even they seem bored with the plot. Mukesh spends as much time blankly staring off into space as his co-star does.

""One Shot"" Nandu (Mukesh) is a street punk in a motorcycle gang who boxes for a local crime boss. He's blindfolded in every fight and takes plenty of blows, blood gushing from his nose and mouth, before knocking out his opponents with a single punch. (Afterward, amazingly, there are barely any marks marring his cutie-pie face.) While running errands for his boss, he accidentally hits Pinky (Padukone) with his car and flees the scene. She's blinded by the accident--but that doesn't stop her for a second from pursuing her dream of getting on the TV show ""India's Got Talent"" with her roller-skating dance routine. Wracked with guilt but unable to confess he's the culprit, Nandu helps her adjust to blindness and becomes her dance partner. Meanwhile, Nandu's boss lords the secret over him and a dogged cop won't give up looking for the perpetrator of the hit-and-run.

The climax is utterly predictable. Even so, the neat resolution manages to stretch plausibility.

So disappointed! I really wish it were easier to order the correct DVD on amazon.com, this is the second time this has happened to me.
The film itself is dramatic, funny and romantic, there are a few wonderful dance/song numbers and it has a happy ending. I highly recommend it!",1334880000,4,547,4.48
8412729,4,B0041EX170,"When one strives for redemption after destroying a life, how much does forfeiting one's street creds matter? ""One-Punch"" Nandu Kamtekar (Neil Nitin Mukesh) is a young Mumbai street fighter notorious for his one-punch knockouts... while fighting blindfolded. Reluctantly, he also runs shady errands for the local crime boss. When Nandu's moment of carelessness causes a girl to lose her eyesight, a remorseful Nandu befriends her. Except that the girl, Pinky Palkar (Deepika Padukone), a skilled ice skater, had dreamt of winning the talent show, India's Got Talent. That was supposed to be her passport out of the Mumbai slums. So just how far is Nandu willing to go to assuage his guilt? In the tough backstreets of Mumbai, being seen gliding around on skates can ruin a hard man's image.

There is ice skating and there is street fighting, and never the twain shall meet... except in LAFANGEY PARINDEY, of which clashing elements are embodied by a spunky dreamer and a laconic thug. It's partly inspired by ICE CASTLES and there may even be wistful whiffs of Charlie Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS (but that's probably stretching it). Let's not get it twisted. LAFANGEY PARINDEY belongs on a lower tier. It's a sweet but entirely predictable love story, and it comes with a bushel of faults.

I really liked the film's first half, especially those moments in which One-Punch Nandu applies unconventional methods in training Pinky to cope with her handicap (such as dodging a stanky sack of fish by smelling it as it comes swinging at her). I realize it's probably all very ""filmy"" (as they say in Bollywood) but there's an organic feel in how Nandu and Pinky's friendship evolves. I chalk it up to Deepika Padukone and what she brings to the table.

Even as Aishwarya Rai's star descends, Deepika Padukone shines brighter and brighter in my eyes. Deepika can be counted on to deliver a spirited performance; I think we've seen enough of her work now to acknowledge her range and her acting chops. With Aishwarya, Kajol, Preity Zinta, and Rani Mukerjee getting older, Deepika leads the next generation of top Bollywood actresses. I haven't even mentioned how absolutely gorgeous she is. With her co-star Neil Nitin Mukesh maintaining an earnest but subdued demeanor throughout, it's Deepika's spirited performance that drives the narrative. Her elegant looks undermine her role of a ghetto native, and yet there's a naturalness about her, a feistiness to her. If not for her taking matters into her own hands, One-Punch Nandu would still be this lump of silent pining.

The quibbles now. It's odd that even though Nandu persistently gets bloodied in his fights, his face barely registers a mark. It's disappointing that the fights themselves are so weakly staged. It pushes credibility that Pinky and Nandu could draw such stunned reactions from the television judges with the tepid skating routines they unveil onstage. The ending feels rushed, with everything falling too conveniently into place. Deepika's vibrant personality threatens to drown out Neil Nitin Mukesh's low-keyed efforts. I wish Farhan Akhtar had played the One-Punch Nandu part. He's got the right sort of edginess to him. I do recommend this movie for those who worship at Deepika Padukone's feet and providing that you lower your expectations a smidge. If you'd rather watch a film that matches Deepika's fight, then go dig up LOVE AAJ KAAL or OM SHANTI OM.

3.5 out of 5 stars for LAFANGEY PARINDEY. I was tempted to rate it 2.5 stars but Deepika's performance elevates the film. The DVD provides an option for English sub-titles, as well as the option to go straight to the musical numbers. These songs are generally likable, but my two favorites are the soulful and melodic ""Mann Lafanga"" and the bittersweet ""Nain Parindey."" There is also a Making of the Film featurette that runs 00:22:48 minutes (some of which is in English).",1332115200,,3896,5.006172839506172
