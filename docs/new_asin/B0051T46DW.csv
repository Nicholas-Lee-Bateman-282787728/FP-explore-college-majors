4526197,4,B0051T46DW,"If you're looking for action, POLICE, ADJECTIVE is probably not the movie for you.  But if you're willing to believe that real drama and on-screen tension can be created in the act of opening a dictionary, then here's a movie that might not only capture your attention, but keep you thinking long after the closing credits.

It takes a while for that dictionary to be opened, and up till that moment the pace is pretty slow as a Romanian cop tries to resist his orders to arrest a pot-smoking teen, who would face a seven-year jail term for pushing the drugs onto his two friends.  The cop has traveled abroad, you see, and he knows the laws in neighboring countries are far less harsh.  Why should he ruin a kid's life for doing something that is openly tolerated across neighboring borders?  Should he obey his captain or follow his conscience?  Who decides?  After plodding along for an hour plus, the final showdown - conscience vs. dictionary - is surprisingly gripping.",1264809600,8,975,4.7
4526198,4,B0051T46DW,"A young Romanian detective follows a high school kid -- suspected drug pusher -- as he goes to school, hangs out with friends, and occasionally smokes hash.  After several days of surveillance yield no leads on a supplier or any direct connections to illegal activity other than using, it's clear the kid is mostly harmless.  Sure, he's breaking the law, but Cristi, the detective, knows that most places in Europe possession of marijuana doesn't even warrant arrest, and suspects the law will eventually change in Romania.  While Cristi hesitates, reluctant to take responsibility for ruining the future of a young man, his supervisor wants results, even if it means bringing the kid in for possession, a minor crime, but one that could land him in jail for several years.

It's a simple police procedural film, with none of the hype or glamour or intrigue of even the simplest television cop show.  There are no car chases, no shoot outs, no rapid fire montages of strip clubs and shady deals.  The most dangerous weapon wielded in the climactic showdown is a dictionary.

8453271,5,B0051T46DW,"Is this Romanian film made in 2009 an allegory for the brutal secret police force maintained until 1991 under the autocratic rule of Nicolae Ceasescu?  The action is slow-paced, leading up to a brilliant ending (spoiler alert - I reveal the ending).  Sparsely and realistically photographed, the film exhibits a leftover cold war influence - a bleak and downtrodden environment whose inhabitants are inured to it's lack of beauty and sense of despair.  A committed young cop has a trivial assignment.  Unlike the rest of Europe, Romania has a ""no pot smoking"" law - and the punishment for being just a user can be up to 7 years.  This young cop must tail a high school student who shares some joints with friends outside school at lunch/recess.  He must build a case based on a putative ""friend"" snitching on the hs student .  This cop also has a mind - and a soul. (Is the cop the face of the new Romania?) He wonders about the motives of the snitch ""friend"".  He suspects the hs kid doesn't sell, just use.  He wants to prove that the kid's brother is the dealer.  He has a strong aversion to ruining the kid's life with a bust for a drug that might soon be legal.  He tails the kid dutifully for 8 days, tedious, mind numbing stakeouts in which the kid is found to be squeaky clean  except for the periodic joints at lunch hour.  Eight joints in 8 days are all that are uncovered and reported by the cop. He avoids meetings with his bureaucratic boss,

Meanwhile, the young cop has a home life (bright young wife, teacher, good cook) that is low on libido. Wife avoids intimacy with definitions, pedantics, word games.  Is she an allegory for the eastern european woman who eschews warmth and hides her feelings?.  Monotones are all this couple can muster when speaking to each other.  She says ""let's go to bed"" without making eye contact.  She says ""this isn't working (meaning us)"" the way she might say ""I hear it will rain tomorrow""

Winter is coming and the young cop shivers as he zippers up and hides in doorways at his various outdoor spying sites.  Is this tailing and spying by the  ""a-hem"" newer, kinder Romanian police an allegory for the brutal spying that lead to the imprisonment, torture and killings of thousands of ordinary Romanians by Ceauseau's police?

Ironically, despite the bleakness and monochromicity of the landscape, the film is filled with color and laughter when it shows groups of students. A sly send-up on what's to come.

The day of judgment arrives when young cop and his older peer are called in to Big Boss's office.  They must wait outside while the boss shows himself not above Ceauseau-era intimidation tactics - keeps them waiting outside and has his secretary bring the written report in ahead of them, so they can stew while they wait.  Once inside,young cop states his case - a young kid's life will be ruined, bigger fish to fry- if he has two more weeks to trail the brother he can prove the brother is a dealer, and the trivialness of the kids ""crime"".  Older, confident, good looking Boss (who was young himself when Ceauseau was in power) sits behind his desk on a chair higher than that of his cop subordinates (using subtle power and control methods) and appears to listen to young cop.  Boss wants a ""sting"".  Now.  When the young cop says his conscience won't allow  him to do that, the Boss systematically denigrates the cop's idea of a conscience, asking for his definition.  Then Boss skewers cops definition, pulling out a definition  of conscience from a dictionary - the ultimate authority, Killing him softly with the Authority of the Dictionary, then impaling his ideas. Great scene if you can stand it.  Meanwhile the co-worker apparently is there to get a lesson by example (see what will happen to you if you don't conform?) - c o-worker has to write the cops definition of conscience on a chalkboard (which he conscientiously does).  See, conscience doesn't count. Laws count.  And appearances count. I'm the Boss and I'm better-looking and better dressed and  older than you are.  Then a cringeworthy scene ensues when the Boss purports to teach the young cop the importance of the Law.  No negotiations about timing, or appropriateness of the sting are considered. The young cop must be taught a lesson and look up in the Dictionary the words for law, police, and even ironically police state etc. until the Boss wins.  The Boss is a bully. Not the old-school Ceauseau bully but a verbal and intellectual bully, breaking down the cops ""no""s, and ultimately threatening to fire him.  In the final scene, the young cop is at the chalkboard, outlining the draconian (and expensive) plans for a Sting on the hapless hs student.  He saved his job but at the cost of his humanity.  The message is compelling.

Worth watching twice. The spare scenery and nuanced scenes are splendid and thought-provoking.  Excellent film for psychology classes - much grist for the mill about the subtle use of manipulation, domination, intimidation and denigration.",1405641600,2,5015,4.734717416378316

The problem is that in Romania, possession is an automatic 7 year prison sentence...so legalization or decriminalization is almost inevitable.

And ""The Wire"" is now second to this one in my book if we're talking about being realistic. However ""The Wire"" would look like a Benny Hill show being compared to this one. If you're looking for shootout, SWAT, high-speed chases and exploding helicopters - you should look for it somewhere else.

8453276,1,B0051T46DW,"I cannot comment on how this movie turns out as I shut it down after 40 minutes, before a lethal attack of ennui drove me into the throes of certain death.  We watch a guy walk on city streets, few other pedestrians other than him, then we watch him wait, then we get to see him walk some more, and then we see him walking in another neighborhood, then we watch him walk, and then we watch him wait for awhile and then we watch him walk some further distances, and finally we see him go home and then, lo and behold, there's a break in the monotony and we spend several minutes watching him eat soup; and after that we watch his post prandial exercise routine as we see him walk some more streets, and some more.............

That is where I shut it down.  If you expect me to continue wasting my time watching an express train to the innards of monotony hell, you have another think coming.",1337904000,,891,4.260355029585799
8453277,4,B0051T46DW,"This is a special film that will certainly put off a large number of main-stream viewers.

It asks that you change the way you view a film - not dramatically, but decidedly. It is almost the opposite of an ""action movie"". Many viewers will dislike the film for that alone.

Secondly, it asks some important questions about authority, choice, and the strength of our own moral code in the face of societal forces (which may cause a conflict for us). In this particular case the societal forces are not necessarily wrong or evil, but they create a dilemma for the main character. I think that much of our lives fall into that area, where we need to make important choices but where there is no clear ""correct"" answer. It is usually not considered worthwhile to try to tell that type of a ""story"" in a film, unless the conflict is made to be somewhat dramatic. In this case the director does make the attempt, but strips out most of the outward drama.

In the end there is a resolution, but it not neat and tidy. To may viewers it will feel as though there was resolution at all, or that the resolution didn't ""mean"" anything. I don't think that the point of this is to tease or to torment the viewer. I think instead that the intent - to some degree -  is to have the viewer wonder about the open-endness of life itself. And of course it can present us with the opportunity to ask ourselves other questions. But some people just aren't looking for that type an opportunity in movie viewing at all...

If you approach this film with high expectations you will probably be let down. But if you can view the film in a minimalist manner it can be a rewarding experience.",1327795200,2,1664,4.42483660130719
8453278,1,B0051T46DW,"If you enjoy watching people walk, this is the movie for you. There are numerous long takes of no dialogue at all of an undercover cop following a possible extremely minor drug dealer in a small Romanian town.

On the back of the DVD box the writeup calls the movie a ""masterpiece,"" but maybe they meant like a masterpiece painting that just hangs there in a museum and does nothing, that's pretty much what this movie does. It tries to play up the fact that words have meanings that vary from the dictionary definition in real life. How profound! I don't need a glacially paced crime drama to tell me that.

Maybe Romanians have far greater patience than Westerners when it comes to storytelling on screen but basically this police procedural is as boring as pretty much any particular day would be for an undercover cop who has to tail a suspect and that suspect does nothing out of the norm.

The DVD itself has just the trailer as an extra but it does have a booklet that has an interview with the director so you can get at what he was trying to say with this movie. Personally, I think he failed as the thing plods so slowly, you can literally disappear for 20 minutes on end and come back to find...oh, yes, more of nothing has happened and you have not really missed a single thing. I know there will be ""fillum"" students and critics who will disagree with me completely and that I missed the nuances of this Romanian director's ""masterpiece,"" but masterpieces should not put viewers to sleep. That's all I'm saying.",1323820800,3,1524,4.5144927536231885
8453279,3,B0051T46DW,"The tag line to this Romanian film is `In a world where crime has no meaning'. I was keen to see this as it is from director Corneliu Porumboiu who did '12:08 East of Bucharest'.

This has a very basic plot in that a cop is assigned a case to target a drug dealer. He spends weeks watching him and staking out his house etc. He then files his report arguing for leniency as the law on drugs is so Draconian. His bosses take a more traditional police approach and he has a crisis of conscience. That is neither a plot spoiler or too short a synopsis as this is a basic film examining conscience. It is not a crime thriller or an action movie, despite having a gun on the cover, the dictionary it lies on is a better representation of this film.

Set in post Stalinist Romania, the settings are all bleak, rotting concrete and badly made roads, which add to the cold feel of the film. There is very little colour too so that when something bright -like a blue bucket- appears on screen I was immediately drawn to it. Whether that is intentional or a reflection on the greyness of the city is unclear.

There is also no background music at all, this adds to the feeling that time is passing slowly and there are many such devices which seem to heighten the mundanity of his job.

This film has many layers but you will have to dig to get them and at 113 minutes running time does seem overly long. However, when it gets moving, things change fairly rapidly. One of the things I love about World Cinema is the different approaches to film making from say Hollywood, but there are downsides too and this film for me required some effort. It felt a bit Kafkaesque so if that is your thing I am sure you will like this presentation from Artificial Eye.",1306627200,4,1745,4.310975609756097
8453280,4,B0051T46DW,"Minor spoilers (maybe major, depending on how you look at it)

Really won't have too much to say about this one... it was voted best film of the year (2009) by Film Quarterly, something that stood out in a year that had quite a few films I enjoyed.  I did have the impression that for most people, it probably was very slow-paced, although this was not a detriment to me, as more and more it hits me when I watch movies that they can parallel the cadence of reality without being dull.

The idea behind the film is that we are trapped in a web of words, the cages that have been structured around us may seem somewhat lax when you look at specific portions of it, but the overall apparatus definitely is much more constraining than it seems, especially when one wants to take moral or spiritual liberties.  The world has become bureaucratic and concrete, everything can be reduced to a verbal description (some would go as far as to say the unconscious is one big web of linguistic elements).  This definitely transforms anything ethereal into an insipid, lifeless description.  The main character (Christi, whose religious and sacrificial connotations never came to fruition) struggles to release himself from the death grip of conformity... he is rendered a slave to linguistics, something he has to question in a displaced manner when ranting to his wife about how the song she listens to makes no sense.

Anyway, he fights the powers to be with his sense of ""moral law"", but after being beaten over the head with his own idiosyncratic definitions of morality, he is given the choice between the chaos of a structure-less and self-defining moral code and the concrete, oppressive, mind-shrinking world of the laws of the physical world, which carry the burdensome weight of their own absurdity, gift-wrapped with the guise of wisdom.  He decision is the same one most people would make, it's very difficult to imagine any other outcome...",1287100800,3,1941,4.807807807807808
