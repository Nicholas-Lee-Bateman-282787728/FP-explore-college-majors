900587,1,6304601794,I love this movie. It makes my teeth hurt to think it is a rip off. But from the looks of it I can almost guarantee it is a fake. The last I heard Ted Turner was in the process of gathering votes to reissue it. Thinking this was the reissue I bought it. This is not a Ted Turner release. Or any other studio release. Don't buy this as the quality is no good.,1270252800,,358,3.7866666666666666
900588,3,6304601794,"This is a great movie..u can laugh with it and just plain sit back with a bucket or bag of popcorn and just enjoy it. It's certainly not the greatest odd partner cop movie but well worth watching, especially if ur a Lance Hienrickson fan.",1257984000,,238,4.311111111111111
900589,5,6304601794,"Get ready for fun and action as Lance Henriksen (Stone Cold) and Anthony Edwards (ER) take on a New Orlean's drug ring. Looking mismatched in the beginning since Edwards plays a cop from LA and Henriksen the bayou, you think nothing in common. But they team up together, Edwards being a good sport about the mishaps and Henriksen being the crazy cajun with an attitude, and wreak havoc where ever they go. It's great fun and a chance to see each of them stretch their talents. No disappointment here.",1003622400,7,500,4.629213483146067
900590,3,6304601794,"On the face of it Delta Heat seems sort of weak, but once you get past a silly plotline, you'll find that it's a lot of fun.  A cop from L.A. is murdered while working undercover in New Orleans.  His partner (Anthony Edwards) arrives and launches an investigation, and along the way is partnered with a former N.O. cop named Jackson Rivers (Lance Henriksen).  Once the two click, the story really takes on some life, and the byplay between them will have you grinning.
The feel of the film is absolutely Nawlins and the peripheral characters nearly steal the show. Nearly. I doubt anyone could wrest this film away from Henriksen, especially after the scene where he gets caught on the doorjamb. What am I talking about? You'll see.
If you like your cop flicks with some tartly comedic overtones, and you don't take it all too seriously, you'll probably like Delta Heat.",994723200,3,870,4.673202614379085

7874530,5,6304601794,"The pairing of Lance Henriksen and Anthony Edwards doesn't immediately seem to click if you are reading the jacket of a DVD. However, the movie itself is well done, hilarious in parts, using sight gags and plot development to keep you interested, laughing and involved. Betsy Russell and Linda Dona are the female leads and ""eye candy"", with Russell giving new meaning to a Bianchi holster. I very much enjoyed this movie and have never understood why it is relegated to ""sleeper"" status.",1401235200,,488,4.891566265060241
7874531,5,6304601794,"Hard to find older film. Glad to get my hands on it. Great price, delivered quickly. Quirky crime drama set in bayou swamps. Authentic setting, good humor. Good ""B"" film.",1359849600,,170,4.7
7874532,5,6304601794,"I enjoyed this movie,not because it was a great movie,but it was funny as heck. It had me laughing most of the time. I owe that to the interaction of Anthony Edwards' and Lance Henriksen's characters. I recommend this to anyone who is a Lance fan and loves to laugh.",1355702400,2,266,4.34
7874533,4,6304601794,"This is a good fun swamp/cajun/bayou adventure. A few holes in the plot, but it's very enjoyable. You can't go wrong with the ever crusty Lance Henriksen and where else are you going to see Anthony Edwards with a mullet?",1345593600,,220,4.525
7874534,4,6304601794,"Surprisingly good buddy/buddy flick with a proper blended mix of action, humor and movie plausible plot.

Re-screened as a fan of Lance Henriksen, but was pleasantly reminded how much fun you can have with this 80's flick. Now, before getting char-grilled and excoriated, I freely admit this is dated. Very much a production of its time. Honestly, one has to view it in that prism to really enjoy it. The eighties were a time of neon and synthesized everything - from lycra to hair gel - you have to absolve yourself from guilty pleasure in order to accept and enjoy.

Opens as a Los Angeles detective frantically calls his partner from a seedy New Orleans public phone. Just as he reaches the answering machine - a metal hook is impaled through his back. The dying detective falls to the ground and the phone's receiver is quietly returned to its cradle.

Flying in from the City Of Angels demanding answers is Det. Mike Bishop. He's determined to find his partner's killer no matter what the cost. But his fast-talking city slicker swagger is quickly cut down by everything and everyone. Not only is he unwanted by fellow police officers, who view him as an uninformed interloper, he sticks out like a sore thumb amongst the locals - quickly dismissed and ignored as an outsider by every citizen he encounters.

Desperate for any chance to help in the investigation - he's given one solitary lead. The person of interest is one Antoine Forbes, a fiendish criminal whose demented crimes include fabrication of designer drugs, mass murder and voodoo cannibalism - literally eating the hearts of his victims and enemies. It's also rumored that he made a pact with the Devil hisself.

The problem: The Antoine Forbes is dead.

Which leads Bishop to the last person to see Forbes alive. An ex-officer who lost a hand during the original investigation, former police inspector Jackson Rivers. After recovering from his wounds, he left the city a broken and embittered man; returning to his Cajun roots deep in the infamous bayou. And over the years has generated an intense resentment toward anyone and anything to do with the authorities, whom he believes collaborated with Forbes and ultimately betrayed him. It's Bishop's only hope - he has to ask the grizzled former cop to help pick up the trail and locate the psychotic scumbag who murdered his partner.

As the odd couple team up to hunt down a ghost, they delve into the lurid dark underbelly of New Orleans and the gator-infested swamps of Louisiana. Anthony Edwards plays his role as prissy city slicker with humorous conviction and Henriksen is completely believable as Jackson Rivers, one-armed swamp thing with a badge.

Exceedingly fun and entertaining if you can excise one's 21st century film bias.

Personal Note:

- Always thought the title could've incorporated the city and state abbreviation of each detective, but can't quite work out how to make ""LA"" and ""LA"" work without sounding like a creatively bankrupt Hollywood writer.",1340496000,,2995,4.912871287128713
