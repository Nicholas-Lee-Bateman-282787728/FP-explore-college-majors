4172029,5,B003QTDH4S,"I like others bought this for David Soul in Unsub.
I had never heard or seen it before. This was the
original CSI except much better! The writing and
story telling is done superb. I guess this show
was ahead of it's time people just didn't like it.
I wish they had more than 8 episodes. The other
rare shows never released are not bad but not
as good. The commish, wiseguy, hunter and
tenspeed and brownshoe are all good shows
you can get on dvd. buy this for Unsub.
note: commish pilot uses the same exact
plot as UNSUB's 2 part show about 2 kids
missing axed and burned in a tub and
buried in the country! Cannell didn't
mind reusing old scripts. great episode.",1341532800,7,663,4.26984126984127
4172030,5,B003QTDH4S,"I purchased this mainly for the series UNSUB. David Soul plays an excellent role as the head of a forensic crime team. This show set a presidence for all the forensic crime shows you see today. This DVD also contains many other of Stephen Cannell's (writer/producer) popular crime dramas such as 21 Jump Street, The Commish, Hunter,Greatest American Hero just to name a few. I am very pleased with my purchase and the quality is great. A welcome blast from the past you will definitely enjoy watching as much as I do.",1340236800,,517,4.630434782608695

4172035,5,B003QTDH4S,"Unsub: ""A special team of FBI forensics experts investigates serial murderers and other unsolved violent crimes.""

I only purchased this box set for the 8 episodes of the TV series Unsub. I recorded the episodes off TV when I was in my teens but I am so happy to finally have them on DVD...something I never thought would happen. Unsub was a crime show way ahead of its time and it's such a shame it never got off the ground...much more realistic than the CSI show's on TV these days.

I watched the episodes over and over on VHS...now I can do the same on DVD.

Highly recommended.",1282521600,31,582,4.37037037037037

4172037,4,B003QTDH4S,"Brought it mainly for the series unsub which we never got in Australia . Enjoying it, however throughout some of the DVDs and episodes there is some shakiness of the film which is a little off putting. We have a brand new multirrgional player so not sure why this is occurring. Other than that enjoying watching the old 80's crime shows!",1441670400,,337,4.540983606557377
4172038,5,B003QTDH4S,"I bought this DVD specifically for the 18 episodes of Missing Persons, which I had been unable to find on DVD anywhere else. So far, those are the the only discs I've watched. The DVDs are in good condition, no problems running them. The packaging is paper open-ended envelopes somewhat loosely secured inside a standard-size case. Not the usual, to be sure, but for the price vs disc content it's not unreasonable, and I expect to find the other discs in the same good condition as those I've watched already.

As for the content:  Missing Persons could have developed into a very good series if it had been given more of a chance. I am a fan of Daniel J. Travanti from his days on Hill Street Blues, and thoroughly enjoyed his character in this series as well. I will watch the other shows too, and if I like them it's an added bonus. The $15 that I paid was well spent, and the current $12.00 price tag is an even better deal.

UPDATE: I've watched a few more of the shows now, and - wow, can you say recycled script? The two-part episodes of Unsub and the two-part (only two) episodes of The Commish:  just watch one set, and then about the first few minutes and the last few minutes of the other set, and you're done. You know, I think they even used the same ""retreat"" location in both, and the same dog, and the same ""dredging"" equipment. Pretty lazy, Mr. Cannell, especially since I found it hard to believe the cops were that sloppy and stupid in the search - in both shows; you could at least have recycled a *great* script. I still think the package is worth the going price, but - jeez!",1440806400,,1598,4.352348993288591

4172048,5,B003QTDH4S,"My main interest in this set was because it included UNSUB. Sometime ago, I managed to record a handful of episodes of UNSUB from the original broadcast run. The set came packaged in a series of paper envelopes which are fitted into an extra-wide case. I don't really care for this sort of packaging. I haven't had a chance to review all of the episodes as of this writing, but, at least in one instance in the episode called ""Burn Out"", the original broadcast epilogue is missing from the official DVD release. It only amounts to about a minute and a half of content and its absence doesn't materially affect the main story, but, it was one of my favorite episodes, so, I did notice the edit.",1421712000,2,693,4.464566929133858

4172058,5,B003QTDH4S,"Fans of the most misogynistic, ripoff series on TV - Criminal Minds - should check out this set to see how the premise was done first, and infinitely better by Cannell. The set is worth its purchase for Unsub, the first of the profiler procedurals - a series that was shamelessly ripped off (and ruined) by Criminal Minds. The set contains all 8 episodes of this brilliant but cancelled series, which gives a five-star rating all by itself.

But the set also contains the complete eps of three other Cannell series that died too soon: Missing Persons (18 eps), Broken Badges (7 eps) and Palace Guard (9 eps) - plus fan favorite eps from a number of other Cannell series - the two part pilot from Wiseguy (the first serious mob drama on TV); Hot Pursuit (a two-parter from Hunter - the closest TV ever came to getting a Dirty Harry-type cop right on TV); My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys from Cannell's Greatest American Hero (still the best superhero satire ever on TV), and more.

Frankly, this is a set that suggests a five-star rating isn't high enough. A++",1366502400,2,1062,4.58421052631579

4172062,4,B003QTDH4S,I have only seen three of the movies in this series of Cannell's work. Usually everything he does is terrific and I hope the other stories are a bit better.  Maybe they just threw together some stuff that never made it on video.  I'll give it a chance but I expected more from SJ Cannell for he is truly a magnificant writer. I'm not really being fair so what the hell-give it a try; there's bound to be some good stuff for I don't believe he'd put his name on movies that are a bunch of crap!

4172064,3,B003QTDH4S,"I bought this set mainly for UNSUB, though I've enjoyed some of the other shows here and will eventually watch most all of them. However, having taped UNSUB when it aired on NBC, I was disappointed to find that the stereo soundtracks from the original broadcast are here all in mono. So much atmosphere gets lost by downgrading the sound. I can't say for sure about all the shows (I know HERO was too early for stereo), but BROKEN BADGES also aired in stereo but is here transferred in mono. (These broadcasts were genuine stereo too, not someone creating fake stereo from a mono track.) That's my reason for knocking the rating down to three stars.

I checked IMDB and all episodes of UnSub are there. I remember taping, on VHS, a few episodes from the series, but never thought it would ever come to DVD, now I have them and I could not be happier. You will also get a chance to see a few episodes of other Cannell Production favorites like ""Hunter"", ""Booker"", and Wiseguy.

Its a shame great shows are often overlooked. Thankfully this set exists. This is a jam packed collection of entertainment. You also get some great shows like the pilot 2 part of Wiseguy and also a 2-part episode of The Commish series which was one of the great shows of TV.

In TNG she was charming and easy on the eyes and in my opinion a talented actress.  In the Crime drama here she didn't have any of those qualities, apart from easy on the eyes.  She was just kind of there, on screen.  Overall, these are OK and I recommend for anyone who likes 80s television.  In the 80s, I liked some of these shows.
