These DVD's are a MUST or any true fan and they aer so darn fun to watch, one of the best shows I have ever had the privledge to watch! And I am so happy that I did! Friends rocks and I am glad we can watch them over and oer again!",1083888000,6,354,3.551282051282051
2013655,1,B0001M3MXO,"Did you ever have ""Friends"" that came over and stayed too long? These did. I know I'm in the minority when I say this but,I'm glad it's over! But is it really over? No! I'm pretty sure they signed a contract to run this thing until the year 3000(on every channel.) To be fair,I honestly tried to like this show when it first came on. I actually watched a few shows but I didn't care about Ross and Rachael. I just found it mind numbingly boring. I tried to find the humor when NBC renamed Wednesday ""Friendsday"" I just couldn't. I did find it interesting how much time was spent covering the series finale. When it went off I expected to hear thunder claps and trumpets blaring signaling the end or something. But it was just the end of a series and not even a good one. Oh well,all I can say is I'm glad these ""Friends""went home.",1083888000,7,830,4.2594936708860756

2013657,5,B0001M3MXO,"Here you go! All seven seasons of Friends on DVD!
Chances are though, if you are a big follower of Friends, you'll have noticed that each time a new season comes out, they realease all the seasons up to that point.
 So, if you're planning on buying all of them no matter what, and you want to do it all at once, you could just wait until all ten seasons are available in a big collector's pack. Or just get this one now and buy the last three as they are released.
  Any way you decide to do it, the price evens out. And all of them have the same features. That being said, this is a great set of laughs, and a great study of television genius. Enjoy!",1081728000,70,651,4.0310077519379846

8014374,4,B0001M3MXO,"I agree, the complete seasons of Friends on DVD is a must for any fan. Even though they are on cable in re-runs, it is still nice to have them all in their complete form.

But I do have to say, if you add up the totals of each set individually here at amazon.com, the total is cheaper than the set of all 7 seasons together ($210 versus the $220 price of this set). So in my opinion, buy the boxed sets, but by them each individually, it will save you some money!!",1104192000,2,464,3.989247311827957
8014375,5,B0001M3MXO,"Look Friends asolutley rocks, okay, it was really really good,and is really, really good. All the characters are so endearing you can't help loving them from first sight. Everybody loves them, enjoy young one for the friend are here to stay",1103846400,,240,4.878048780487805

8014377,5,B0001M3MXO,"""Friends"" was billed late in its career as the greatest television comedy series of all time.  This is highly debatable.  Nonetheless, it certainly holds its place in pop culture, speaking to thousands of the 20-something (and eventually 30-something) generation Xers who found themselves unsure about what life had to offer after college in the early 1990s.  For those who have lived in a cave for the past decade, ""Friends"" is about three men and three women who live/date/work/play in New York City. The show's foundation is the uniqueness of its characters -- a nerdy scientist, a struggling actor, and an internet geek (the three men) -- and a waitress/chef, hippie, and unemployed-daddy's-little-girl (for the women).  Sure, the characters seem a little cliche, but ""Friends"" had one of the best writing teams on television, so they made the situation seem somehow fresh.  The quality of the show did decrease over time, as ""Friends"" stayed on the air for about three or four seasons more than it should have.  The story lines slowly became stretched, forced, more unbelievable, and even downright corny.  But still, at least the first six seasons are near perfect, and even the rest of them are enjoyable for any generation.",1097280000,,1231,5.064356435643564
8014378,4,B0001M3MXO,"I think it's a good deal having all these seasons in one whole compilation, every person has it's own Friend's character, it's really sad that the curtain falls for the last time, anyway that's where this dvd comes in handy, can't wait for the last 3 season to come up.",1085011200,,269,4.4
8014379,5,B0001M3MXO,"Let me start by saying that Friends would be loved by everyone.  It's HILARIOUS, and it has a lot of drama too (well, not a whole lot).  Second, I know you can watch them on TV, but on TV they cut out a lot to fit in commercials, and you can see all that here.  Also, you can watch them all in order on DVD, where as on TV it isn't in order from the beginning.  get it. NOW!!!",1084492800,5,376,3.721518987341772
8014380,5,B0001M3MXO,"Why should you buy these DVDs when Friends is always shown on TV?  Well for starters the DVDs are uncut and you will never see these versions on TV.  Even the first season has minutes of extra footage, and with 7 seasons this adds up to a considerable amount.
I'd even recommend these to people who have gone out and purchased the first 6 seasons as Region 2.  The R2 discs before Season 7 were pretty poor both quality and price-wise.  Add this to the fact that as of Season 7, the Region 2 discs have 4 episodes a disc (4 broadcast, 4 uncut) and you are saving a considerable amount of money.  For the price of 8 episodes on Region 2, you get a whole season as a Region 1 boxset.
So Friends is over... but if you get these discs there is so much more to see.",1084060800,12,760,4.073825503355705
8014381,5,B0001M3MXO,"When TV shows are re-run after primary air, they edit out as much as 2.5-5 minutes of actual show in order to cram more commercials in.  When buying the DVD not only do you get the luxury of seeing them with NO commercials, but you are watching the entire episode as originally aired.  Not to mention DVD quality is the best quality available.  Re-runs over time begin to show their age in both video and audio quality.",1083888000,17,419,4.415584415584416
