7995939,5,B0000A59ZG,"These are very short, but informative segments on many of the ""great artists"" in history.  A must for those who travel and will see the masterpieces in various locations!",1311033600,,170,4.862068965517241
7995940,3,B0000A59ZG,"Tim Marlow is knowledgeable and passionate about art.  But I'm afraid these programs are spoiled by his words.  As if constantly pressed for time, he omits pauses between sentences and paragraphs, forcing one's mind to race constantly to keep up with him.  His English itself is surprisingly flawed, suggesting uncompleted lessons in grammar and syntax (compare Kenneth Clarke's ""Civilization,"" which is superb in all aspects except for its Islamophobia).  The camera is often used improperly: sometimes it shakes too much, other times it sweeps across a room too quickly, and at least once it is placed at his feet and is pointed upward at him for an effect which the producers presumably thought would be cool but which only comes off as pretentious, I'm afraid.  But the program is worth watching all the same, for Mr. Marlow is so good-looking as to compete with that part of the show that is beyond reproach, namely, the art.",1308009600,7,930,4.935897435897436
7995941,3,B0000A59ZG,Tim Marlow gives a good show but the bottom line is that he wasn't there when the artist painted these pictures. I get tired of people trying to tell me what a painter thought when he was painting a picture or why he did this or that. If you don't have a written statement from the artist or if you don't talk to the artist then it is only your guess as to what he was thinking when he painted a picture. Also when he tells us why the artist used a certain color instead of another color ...he just doesn't know...it's his opinion. Bottom line...was he there?,1266019200,10,559,4.185185185185185
7995942,5,B0000A59ZG,"All the bio's last no more than 30 minutes & start from childhood to death.
It goes into some deep details about the artists and who commissioned them.
Shows beautiful artworks, too.
I ordered these because I wanted to show them to the Elementary, Middle School & High School kids I work with.
Out of all the great artists listed I would only be able to show two artists because there is nudity.",1265673600,37,395,4.424657534246576
7995943,4,B0000A59ZG,"Tim Marlow is such a good presenter of art.  He unpicks the most intricate detail in a piece of work and explains the stories within a painting that otherwise would go unexplained.  I really enjoy the historical context which gives a picture of the life and times of the artist.  And of course where would we be without Marlow's explanation of the technical skill and immense talent of the artists?  When there's so much dross on TV these days, it's great to have a series  like this on DVD at your fingertips.",1245801600,13,510,4.5
