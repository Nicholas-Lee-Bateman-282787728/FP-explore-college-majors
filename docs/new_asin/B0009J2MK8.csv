2294159,1,B0009J2MK8,"This is the worst photography (or any other subject matter) DVD I have had the misfortune of paying for. It is contains pathetic, amateurish 'lighting' experiments.  The tawrdry model is full of body piercings and tattoos. The photographer parades around in a black, see-through stocking outfit in one shooting sequence, and then treats us to a view of her shrunken breasts when she photographs herself in blue light. I think the real purpose of the DVD was to give the photographer a means to exhibit herself when no one would hire her as a model.",1141430400,14,548,4.768421052631579
8061779,5,B0009J2MK8,"Photography Experiments is an inexpensive, yet useful guide for working with amateur models.  The primary focus of the DVD is on the relationship between photographer and model, and how to bring creative ideas to fruition during a photoshoot.  There is not a lot of photographic-specific technical information here... if you want f-stops and lighting setups, this is not your guide.  However, if you want sound advice on how to relate to your model... and get the most from your model during a photoshoot, this DVD is well worth the price.  ""Kudos"" to the Producer and the Distributer--Photography Experiments is a great value.",1202774400,2,627,5.117647058823529
8061780,4,B0009J2MK8,"If you're looking for a photography ""how-to"" video (or some kind of ""Playboy"" style video), you'll likely be disappointed with this DVD.  HOWEVER...if you're an artistic photographer looking for help with the creative side of your work - I think you will find it quite useful.

It starts a little slowly, but quickly takes off after just a few minutes!  I got a few direct ideas from it, but what was most valuable to me was help with ""thinking outside the box"" more.  I felt that this video was more ""inspirational"" than ""educational"" - which is really the more difficult material to find (IMHO).  Technique without creativity can only take you so far!",1202774400,2,653,4.743362831858407
8061781,4,B0009J2MK8,"I enjoyed this video.  Being we are in a technical world today I myself enjoy seeing techniques that are basic and that were done many many decades ago.  I enjoyed the simple lighting and effects you can get from just light itself.  This video is more in lines of showing how light and nude figure posing can be done.  It touches on costuming and effects such as body paint, outfits and posing in a figure nude artistic way.

I think mainly the ideas of using light in many ways is a good reference for this video, not as much camera techniques and settings.  A photographer will get that part of the photography.  This video shows examples of light and use of how simple old school studio work can be done.  I myself love early photography where there was a model, light, props.  This video is more on the artistic side, not glamour or playboy.  I enjoyed it and it will at least spark ideas you can use or modifiy to keep with the traditional art of photography.",1202774400,2,964,4.395480225988701
8061782,1,B0009J2MK8,"A fully regrettable purchase. Amateur in every respect. I wish it were a book, then I could rip the pages out and put them to use, one at a time... Don't waste your money.",1179360000,,171,4.0588235294117645
8061783,1,B0009J2MK8,"Obviously this DVD is on ""another level.""

I feel that the sole purpose in creating this DVD was to provide an outlet for the photographer's exhibitionism and various fetishes, which is okay for a soft porn flick in adult section. What is not okay is to present this DVD as a photography manual.

The only type of photographer that can benefit from this is an extreme beginner with no imagination, one who does not know that he can use a lamp, candle or anything else that shines as a light source. The narration is very mediocre.

The value I got out of the purchase of this title came in the second chapter. I had to laugh vigorously when I imagined myself and my photography colleagues dressed in the see-through fishnet overall outfit the photographer was wearing.

No disrespect to the photographer and her lifestyle, but I feel I was tricked into buying this DVD by its title.",1170547200,8,882,4.598726114649682
8061784,1,B0009J2MK8,"I really don't understand this DVD. The woman photographer is shooting Nudes and does not really explain anything, you don't really see any setups and she doesn't really explain the nature of her lighting.

Then she shoot her nude model while in the nude herself!!! How professional is that?

No value what so ever.",1167177600,12,315,4.814814814814815
8061785,1,B0009J2MK8,"I wish I would have noticed the negative review here before buying this DVD.  All I saw were the positive reviews.  How can anyone with any talent in photography give this a good review?!  It doesn't even deserve 1 star, but I'm forced to give it one by the Amazon system.

First of all, there was barely any mention of camera settings for the different shots she was doing.  Granted, the model was attractive, but the poor girl was working with a woman who would get an F in a photography class.  The photographer had no technical skill, nor an eye for photography.  Her ""experiments"" were a cluster ****.  Not to mention that the photographer, a 50's wrinkly and skinny woman, got naked in front of the camera every chance she got.  This DVD is nothing more than soft core porn, created so the old woman photographer can feel famous.  I pity the poor model who was involved with this.  Oh yeah!  And at the end of the DVD when it showed the actual photographs created, they were horrible!  The photographer had no idea how to frame a photograph.  She had no idea how to configure her camera to get the lighting right in the photos.  She had background clutter from her studio in all the pictures.  Just horrbile.

The ONE saving grace, is that when the model was posing herself, and not listening to the photographer, she posed quite beautifully, which gave me some ideas for new poses to suggest to my models.",1163721600,6,1412,4.496062992125984
8061786,4,B0009J2MK8,"This film explores creative experiments in photography, lighting, and costuming that you can do with models/amateur models, or that you might try with your wife or girlfriend.  I found that the film's narration was informative without being too technical, and the photographer explained what she was doing to the model she was working with, and us the viewing audience.  The film moves at a relaxed pace, to display the workings of a real time photo shoot in each experiment presented.  I found that one of the most valuable lessons shown in this film was how a relaxed and open communication with the model, can really bring out her sensuality.  Experiments is a sensual approach to photography.",1143936000,4,696,4.974137931034483
8061787,4,B0009J2MK8,"Anyone who's just getting started with photographing nudes or semi-nudes in the studio would find this video a useful reference. Each of the ten segments explores a photographic idea such as backlighting, shadows, costumes or candlelight photography that can be used as a basis for a singel photo session ... or combined if one has the time available. Obviously it would be impossible to fully explore all the possibilities of any one of the exercises in the context of such a video ... but that's the point. Each segment in the sequence provides a jumping off point for the photographer. It is intended to stimulate experimentation rather than to map out all the possibilities.

If one has many years of experience in the studio, perhaps this is not the most useful video but, for anyone in the early stages of their career, I believe its a good investment and worth reviewing periodically as a reminder that there are any number of techniques that one can use to achieve engaging results.",1143849600,4,990,4.823529411764706
8061788,4,B0009J2MK8,"The ideas and suggestions in this film are layered. The photo shoots shown are done at a thoughtful, real life pace. For the viewer to get the most from this film, it needs to be watched carefully.
The basic ideas are simple and easy to follow.  Beneath the surface are layers of deep and challenging inspirations.
The shoots, keep in mind, are at a thoughtful, realistic pace.  [...]
The photographer in the film is confident and absolutely a free spirit. [...]The blonde model is appealing, and I especially liked her in her sparkly lace open front gown. The outfit was strategically designed in the rear, managing (but only at times) to almost conceal her back side.",1143417600,5,669,4.758620689655173
