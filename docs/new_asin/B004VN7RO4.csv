4483563,5,B004VN7RO4,"What a wonderful collection of authors they assembled to pay homage to this fabulous, classic book. I loved To Kill a Mockingbird (both the book and the movie), and think it's one those rare occurrences where the movie is equally as good as the book. This documentary talked about both, and touched on the key parts of Harper Lee's life. There isn't anything new here. If you're a fan of Lee and her book, you'll know everything that is in here.

So why'd I give it five stars then? Because it is a lovely tribute to this important story. It is well done and has just the right amount of sentimentality.",1314921600,2,603,4.4324324324324325
4483564,4,B004VN7RO4,"Judge Jim Thomas, DVD Verdict-- Let's get the big question out of the way first: No, Harper Lee did not break her forty-eight year old streak and give Murphy an interview. In the absence of what certainly would have been the greatest interview ""get"" in recent history, Murphy at least brings a couple of new voices to the party: Michael Brown (a successful Broadway composer in the Fifties) and his wife Joy were friends of Harper Lee when she worked in New York City; for Christmas in 1956 they gave her enough money for her take a year off from her job taking airline reservations and write full time. In the years that followed the novel's publication, Harper Lee split time between living in New York City and living with her older sister, Alice Finch Lee, in her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama. Both the Browns and Alice agreed to be interviewed for the project, and between the three of them, we get a slightly better picture of Harper Lee. Those expecting some sort of cosmic revelation about Harper Lee's motives, personality, influences, or credit rating are likely to be disappointed--and to be fair, the film's title does lead you in that direction. Murphy finesses that failing with an interesting insight--when Harper Lee initially wrote the novel, she saw herself as Scout, but over the years, she began to see herself more as Boo Radley, who having given of herself, simply prefers to stay in the shadows from here on out. It is perhaps too romantic a notion, but there's certainly at least a grain of truth there. It also allows us to come to terms with the simple fact that Harper Lee will forever remain one of modern literature's greatest ciphers.

When not focused on Lee, the film examines the novel's enduring appeal. To that end, the film includes interviews with a host of writers and personalities, including Tom Brokaw, Oprah Winfrey, and Rosanne Cash, all of whom talk about the things that make the book or film so memorable. Many of the writers are from the south, such as Mark Childress (Crazy in Alabama), fellow University of Alabama alumnus and Malleteer. Many of the interviewees talk about specific scenes that stick with them, many even reading the passage in question; just as it did when I first read the book all those years ago, hearing passages, even single lines out loud bring the book alive. The interviews are contrasted with archival footage that illustrates more clearly exactly what the world was like when the novel was written and published, providing a better context for explaining the appeal.

The discussion of the film adaptation parallels that of the novel itself, but also looks at how specific scenes worked, how Gregory Peck approached the role of Atticus, and so on. Much of the discussion is built around an extended interview with Mary Badham, who played Scout. Notably missing is Robert Duvall, who inaugurated his film career with his portrayal of Boo Radley.

Technically, the disc is solid; the video is sharp (save the archival footage), and the audio is crisp and clear.

4483565,5,B004VN7RO4,"As another Amazon reviewer pointed out, this is MUST HAVE DVD for book lovers and anyone who - like me - returns to the 1962 film starring Gregory Peck on a regular basis.

That said, it was a challenge for Director Mary McDonagh Murphy to craft a documentary about an author (Nelle Harper Lee) who only penned ONE novel (but a powerful one!) and who has not given an interview in the last 45 years! To overcome this - and fill the 82-minute running time, Murphy interviews people close to Lee. There is the composer who gave Lee the funds to submit her book to the major New York publishing houses (four of who rejected the manuscript - boy are they sorry now!) while Lee was working as an airline sales agent. Then there is Lee's older sister, Alice, who, at 99 years old, is the oldest still-practicing attorney in Missouri! She has stories to tell! Nell Harper Lee still lives in Southern Alabama - though Murphy fails to mention that she had a stroke and is fighting blindness - and we hear from her long time Pastor and neighbor.

Because ""celebrities"" sell DVDs too, we hear from newsman Tom Brokaw, singer/songwriter Roseanne Cash and everyone's favorite book club hostess - OPRAH - as to how the book had a profound effect on them. It's interesting that when Oprah discusses the civil rights movement - some of which was powered by the story told in TKAM - she acknowledges that, by the time she was growing up, there were no ""separate"" rest rooms and lunch counters in her town.

Of course there are LOTS of scenes from the film - especially key moments - and the actress who played young Scout (the character that Lee based on her own life) reads passages from the novel. I found it fascinating to learn that author Truman Capote lived in the same small Alabama town as Lee and served as the model for the character Dill. (Capote broke off his friendship with Lee shortly after the novel was published.)

The bonus features on the DVD include 11-minutes of extended interviews (including four minutes with Oprah and a ""text"" interview with Director Murphy.

Speaking of the interviews, in a few of the ""studio"" interviews in the film there is the annoying sound of traffic going by. Very strange!

As I said at the beginning of this review, this a ""must have"" for avid readers and fans of TKAM. For others, this is about as complete a treatment as you will find of Lee and her novel. Murphy uses excepts from the last recorded interview Lee gave (for WQXR Radio in New York in 1964), and with Lee's current health there will certainly be no more.

4483566,5,B004VN7RO4,"What starts out as a few predictably effusive praises from fans, particularly Southern writers, quickly turns into something so much more.  Not only does the film explore familiar territory, such as the basis for Dill, Scout, and Atticus, it also explores the reasons behind Lee's seeming reclusiveness,and how she, through a surprising act of kindness, was able to write the book in the first place. Most importantly, however, the film depicts the impact the book had on a burgeoning Civil Rights Movement,  For TKAM fanatics, this documentary is a must see, but even more,  ANY TEACHER OF TO THIS BELOVED NOVEL SHOULD BUY THIS DOCUMENTARY.  Every student should see the section on Lee's bravery and her impact on the deep South in the early 60's. After reading the novel AND seeing at least parts of this important documentary, students will leave with not only a fictional paragon, but a real life role-model as well. That is why I  bought copies not only for my English Department, but for each of my sons as well.  Yeah.  It's that special.",1311206400,48,1045,4.837078651685394

4483568,5,B004VN7RO4,"""Hey, Boo"" is a documentary about the power of a book to shape our history (personally and collectively), and between its vivid footage and its stellar cast of stars, authors, and participants, it makes the case for ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" as our great American novel. The story of how the novel was written -- after friends of Harper Lee gave her the money to write for a year -- is told movingly by these same friends, as well as by Lee's sister, pastor, neighbors, and publisher, some of whom are now in their nineties. How wonderful that the director was able to get them on the record! The novel's reach from small town Alabama to the front of the civil rights struggle, to Hollywood, to the contemporary classroom, and to the work of other writers is impressive and inspiring, and ""Hey, Boo"" captures that. If you're a reader or a student of American literature, you need to see this. If you're a writer or a teacher, my guess is you'll want to own it.",1309737600,19,958,4.48

4483583,4,B004VN7RO4,"...""Scout, Atticus, and Boo: A Celebration of Fifty Years of To Kill a Mockingbird"" by Mary McDonagh Murphy will want to watch this DVD as it is based on that book. This film is by Mary McDonagh Murphy and like the book looks at the life of Harper Lee, her family and what has got to be one of the greatest classic American novels ever written. Harper Lee of course is nowhere to be seen in this production except in still photographs and film reels. It is a fairly good look at Ms. Lee's life from growing up to being a struggling writer to winning the Pulitzer Prize for ""To Kill A Mockingbird"".

In addition to that there are various people well known in politics, literature and TV and film who talk about how the novel ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" affected and changed their lives. By far the most interesting person who appears on this documentary is Alice Lee, Harper Lee's older sister. It is certainly interesting to hear her talk about their lives together growing up and their parents and of course Harper's book. It is worth getting this DVD if for no other reason then listening to Alice. Alice Lee passed away last year in November of 2014 at the age of 103 so I for one am glad this documentary was made before we lost Alice and before we would have lost all of her input in helping to tell the story behind ""To Kill A Mockingbird"".

For the serious fans of either the book or the movie or Harper Lee there probably isn't too much revealed in here that you may not already know. Still this is a wonderful film that has been put together that will still be enjoyable to watch and add to your video collection. If by chance you have never read the book or seen the movie then get yourself one or both of these and enjoy getting caught up in the lives of Atticus, Jem, Scout, Dill and Boo Radley. Then get this DVD about the story behind ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". The story behind ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is just as interesting as the story itself.",1424304000,,1954,4.336065573770492

4483592,3,B004VN7RO4,"HEY, BOO: HARPER LEE & TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a fine example of a documentary made with great passion and enthusiasm. Unfortunately it is not a fine example of a documentary. Apparently Writer/ Producer/ Director Mary McDonagh Murphy spent 20 years as a producer at CBS and has had three other docs on PBS. So what happened?

It seems that what we have in HEY, BOO is a failure to communicate. Perhaps Murphy needed another hand or two to guide her ship into port successfully. Shes clearly in love with her material, and in the absence of more objective influences, this film very nearly sinks.

There is no through-line to hold the content together. There are more talking head sequences in her interviews than Ive seen in a long time, and the interviewees do not seem to be well-guided  their content wanders back and forth. There are so many bits and pieces and snippets of things thrown in, when you get to the end, instead of the Wow! that youd like to give her, what pops into your head is What was the point of all that? HEY, BOO is a meandering structural mess and a bit frustrating to watch.

The main factor that saves Murphys film is the subject matter. While the bits and pieces and snippets are disjointed, they are truly fascinating and some of her talking heads really do have a lot of new things to say. The information Murphy offers up in her film is worth watching  almost every second of it. And I would not want any of it omitted. Unfortunately it required a stronger mandate and a finer hand in order to turn the great content into a great documentary.

I would like to say otherwise, but HEY, BOO: HARPER LEE & TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a brilliant opportunity tragically wasted. However, while it won't go down in history as a great work of art, as a source of education and information, its worth the effort.",1397433600,3,1834,4.476047904191617

Gregory Peck, Mary Badham and Robert Duvall  were blessed in their opportunities to play Atticus, Scout and Arthur Radley ... and we have been blessed in their portrayals.

The rest of ""Hey Boo"" is cluttered with needless readings from the book, too many clips from the movie, and some of the most mindless commentary by a hodgepodge collection of authors and celebrities. This could have been a far better documentary much like the one about Lee's fellow iconic southern author Margaret Mitchell.

4483607,5,B004VN7RO4,"First Run Features has scored another home run with its documentary Hey, Boo: Harper Lee & To Kill a Mockingbird. Anyone who has read the book (or seen the film) will recognize the title's quote, and to wax rhapsodic about the place of those two words in American literature has long been a critical parlor game, right up there with Huck Finn's ""Then I'll go to hell.""
  It's difficult to believe that it's been 50 years since Harper Lee's novel won the Pulitzer and, as this documentary points out, it's painful to remember the atmosphere of violent racism and segregation. It was a brave book to write at the time, but as Hey, Boo points out, too little has really changed since then. The outsider is still persecuted, it's still sinful and dangerous to be perceived as different and the great mob of (in)humanity still has an awful power to hate and destroy.
  The movie is peopled with quick comments, interviews and longer pieces by such celebrities as Oprah Winfrey, Tom Brokaw, Rosanne Cash and Scott Turow. The many years Lee worked on the novel, and her efforts (and ultimate failure) to create another novel, are touched on, as well as her joy simply in the art of putting words and sentences together and ultimate disdain for the attendant publicity and celebrity forced on an artist. Far from a recluse, with lots of friends and correspondents, Lee grew sick of having her words twisted and refused all interviews later in her life. (The 85-year-old Lee, wheelchair bound, partially blind and deaf and suffering from memory loss, lives in an assisted-living facility. She also told a close friend why she never wrote again: ""Two reasons: One, I wouldn't go through the pressure and publicity I went through with To Kill a Mockingbird for any amount of money. Second, I have said what I wanted to say and I will not say it again."")
  It's reasonably well known that Lee and Truman Capote grew up together, and the character of Dill was based on him. He dedicated In Cold Blood to Lee but, livid at losing the Pulitzer, he somehow suggested that it was he who wrote and shaped To Kill a Mockingbird. Checking out the opening few pages of In Cold Blood does, indeed, remind you of Lee's work.
  Under any circumstances, like the novel and movie version, Hey, Boo is a work created with a heart, soul and vision of what and who we really are, and what and who we really could be. Beautifully structured and incredibly sympathetic both to the author and her times, Hey, Boo: Harper Lee & To Kill a Mockingbird should not be missed.

With the exception of the interview segments with Harper Lee's sister, there's nothing worth watching.  It's safe to assume that buyers of this video would be familiar with the book, so why they would think we'd be satisfied paying $20 to hear it read aloud by others, I don't know.  I for one, would like my money back.  TIP --- For a great video with interesting background on Ms. Harper and the book, purchase the 2006 Collectors Edition of the film, which has an excellent special feature documentary.",1314921600,14,585,4.596153846153846
