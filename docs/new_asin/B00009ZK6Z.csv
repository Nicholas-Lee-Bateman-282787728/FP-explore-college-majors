7994466,1,B00009ZK6Z,"I needed a beginners instructional course. The first five minutes was all Lester Griffin fluff. The actual instructional parts were very fast and brief; no step by step teaching. Then the part with him in the pool?!? This was an awful waste of money. This man is not a teacher,he just created a DVD to show everyone what he knows, not how to learn. After the pool demo, there were some guys stick fighting, of course Lester was center stage. Then some shots of him in the ring. I am 52 years old, and have wanted to learn this art all my life. I learned NOTHING from this DVD.",1364169600,,576,4.293577981651376
7994467,3,B00009ZK6Z,"""Filipino Stick Fighting"" taught by Lester Griffins is a good beginners DVD.  Lester Griffins demonstrates basic blocks, strikes and combinations, as well as simple footwork to be used with these techniques.

The DVD runs about 55 minutes; about 30 minutes of which is good instruction.  There are several minutes of full-contact stick fighting shown at the end of the DVD (Dog Brothers stuff) which is worth seeing, but between these two segments is Griffins trying to demonstrate stick fighting drills in a swimming pool.  Training in water is a useful technique, but I felt the swimming pool segment distracted from the quality of an otherwise decent instructional DVD.

I have mixed feelings about this DVD.  Lester Griffins clearly has skill in stick fighting, and one can learn some basic techniques from studying this DVD, but there is nothing that makes this DVD stand out from other stick fighting DVD / Videos on the market.",1155513600,3,934,5.032467532467533
7994468,5,B00009ZK6Z,"Lester ""Surf Dog"" Griffin is still stick fighting, as he was at the most recent June 2005 Dog Brothers Gathering.  This tape is quite educational, as it shows the progression of protective equipment and weapons over all of the years of Marc Denny's Gathering of the Pack event.  Griffin demonstrates some of the Dog Brother material from basic drill to harder contact.  Every now and then, the otherwise serious-faced instructor injects some humor in his training, such as splattering a watermelon or training in the pool.  I was waiting for the pool to be drained to make way for the skateboards !  Perhaps we'll see some surf or skateboard fighting in his next tape.

The fellow is in great shape, and offers his training methods as well as some footage of Dog Brothers stickfighting.  This tape fills a niche between the usual FMA video of tons of techniques and the excellent Dog Brother instructional tapes which use fight excerpts as illustrations.

Overall, a good buy. There is one production issue with crackling audio when Griffin places a mask over his wireless microphone, but otherwise, this video is well-vtaped and produced.  The video and audio quality are pristine, though the the picture used to sell this product implies an older product.

Please update the picture to do your material justice !
