7420778,5,B014RDXCUA,The DVD is kick ass. An instant live classic by Black Stone Cherry. I've been a fan since the first album and this album/DVD only makes a bigger fan out of me. These guys absolutely kick ass live. This is Real 100% Rock n Roll here. No cookie monster vocals allowed. Buy this Dvd you won't be sorry.,1446163200,,299,4.172413793103448
7420809,4,B014RDXCUA,"It' s a very good bluray, I didn't like the fact that Chris doesn't sing ""Things my father said"" instead he let the crow sing it.......I mean such a good and classic song I want to hear Chris singing it.....but overall I'm pleased to have a live bluray of one of my favorite alternative bands.",1473811200,,293,4.345454545454546
7420810,5,B014RDXCUA,"Great live set from a underrated band. I've never had the chance of seeing them do a full set until now. I saw them on the carnival of madness tour in 2012 and there set was short but powerful. I just wish Chris wouldn't let the crowd sing quite so much but it's his stage. I suppose it's cool to hear everyone sing your songs but sometimes it's overkill on this DVD. All and all i highly recommend this DVD for hardcore or casual listeners, you will not be disappointed!",1457308800,,471,4.2444444444444445
7420811,5,B014RDXCUA,BSC Rocks!,1456704000,,10,4.5
7420812,5,B014RDXCUA,AWESOME. Love seeing these guys live. This is 1 of the greatest bands around. They always put on a great high energy show wether it's in front of 100 people in a basement in Detroit or 500 people in a bar in Flint or 1000's in a giant stadium. Keep it up.,1453161600,,255,3.923076923076923
7420813,4,B014RDXCUA,"These guys really know how to rock, & the energy they put into their show is outstanding. They also have some totally addictive songs in their repertoire. There are however a couple of reasons I won't give 5 stars for this Bluray, the main one being the highly frenetic editing. Few scenes last longer than 2 seconds, really seizure inducing stuff. The second is a personal pet peeve, that being Chris Robertson's habit of letting the crowd sing his songs for him. I can see that it's gratifying for a musician to hear the crowd singing their songs, but hey Chris,let the crowd sing WITH you, not FOR you.",1452556800,,605,4.559633027522936
7420814,5,B014RDXCUA,Such an awesome band to see live and the Bluray puts you right there in the experience. I have had the pleasure of seeing Black Stone Cherry live five times and what you see in the video is the high energy style that makes them one of the greatest bands around today.,1452124800,,267,4.153846153846154
7420815,5,B014RDXCUA,"Love this band and have seen them live a couple times; this is as realistic a representation of their show as you will find.

They sound great live and they always put on a great show. Not sure why the Japan release has 2 cds while the rest only have the 1, seems like in this day and age with the internet a release would be a release, but as a collector I ended up buying both.

no new material here, but if you like BSC you will like it.",1449014400,,440,3.8777777777777778
7420816,5,B014RDXCUA,Love Black Stone Cherry and everything they give to their fans this is just another way they show their love,1448409600,,108,4.45
7420817,5,B014RDXCUA,These guys are phenomenal. Get this blu-ray...you will not be disappointed. From the opening drums of Rain Wizard to the closing riffs of Lonely Train it rocks to it's very core. I just wish that we had more of them here in their home country and didn't have to have them play across the pond to have such a masterpiece .,1448064000,2,321,4.278688524590164
7420818,5,B014RDXCUA,"An absolute MUST HAVE if you have ANY interest in this kick a$$ band!

GREAT bluray audio.  Great video quality.

As is usual on great band DVD live shows, the band puts in extra effort/energy to sound good and play extended riffs to bring the crowd in to fever pitch with each song.

And if you know how this band plays Live in Europe....Great Crowds.....GREAT FUN!

(Watch the Download UK festivals on Youtube to see how they play live.)",1446768000,2,439,4.506329113924051
