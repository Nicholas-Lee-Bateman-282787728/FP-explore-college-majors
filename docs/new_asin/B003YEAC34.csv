8409107,5,B003YEAC34,"As a member of the Lutheran Church I found this to be a very good
documentary of the man from whom my faith was started.
I may buy another copy just to put in the Church Library.",1444953600,2,178,3.8378378378378377

8409109,3,B003YEAC34,"there is nothing really different in the story told about Martin Luther in this documentary..no additional information much..but does show Wittenburg  Germany a bit..but really most of the time will be watching a seemingly religious professer telling same ole story again about Martin Luther's stand against the Catholic Church.

It isn't that expensive at time of this review...so i think if you haven't seen it..it is worth it to buy it..but don't expect much from it.",1351900800,12,470,5.171052631578948
