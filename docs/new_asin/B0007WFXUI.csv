2246295,5,B0007WFXUI,"Absolutely fabulous collection for any TV-phile.  One of the great drama series form the fifties, this show featured many big stars of tomorrow before they were famous.  The stories were thoughtful and dramtic.  This is truly the forerunner of show like Hill Street Blues or NYPD Blue.  Good acting in a great script and a black and white film noir style, WOW.  As an added bonus, watch the original commercials.  My favorite was the cigaretee with a filter made of tobacco!  This is a lot of fun and enjoyment.",1155945600,28,511,4.674157303370786
2246296,5,B0007WFXUI,"I got this for the Shatner episode and ended up hooked on the show. There's so much here; fantastic cinematography of New York; early roles by excellent actors; great stories; fine music. It's not just a cop show, the stories are about the people. Also, the top 100 list of TV characters should have Detective Adam Flint and Lt.(?)Mike Parker somewhere, they are well-rounded, emotional characters in great contrast to modern police characters. Usually, I like sci-fi, but this is just great stuff for almost anybody at a nice price.",1130630400,18,533,4.933333333333334
2246297,4,B0007WFXUI,"Not only does 'Naked City' take us back to the days of B&W TV. It

harkens back to a time when being a police detective (on TV) was

not nearly as glamorous or humourous as they're often made to seem today.  Naked City was intended to give us (more or less) a

seemingly realistic look into the life of NY Police Detectives.  O how the dress, mannerisms, (not to mention the cars) have changed over the years.

If you're looking for detectives dressed to the 'Nines' or driving their own classic autos.... then Naked City is not for you.  But if on the other hand,  you're truly interested in what a typical day in the life of a NY Police detective may have been like.  Then Naked City is for you, it even comes with the series theme music, which once you've heard it.  Will echo and reverberate in your mind for a life time!",1126310400,14,825,4.264516129032258
2246298,5,B0007WFXUI,"Excellent DVD's.  Interesting characters and stories with old New York City as their fabulous co-star.  As with other programs of the 50's and 60's such as the Fugitive and Route 66, you get a vision of America that is past but not forgotten.  I give it 6 Stars.",1122940800,12,262,4.416666666666667
2246299,5,B0007WFXUI,"And thank you for continuing to release on DVD episodes of the greatest TV series of all time, bar none.  Brilliant, masterful, stirring and inspired.  This is what television can be, but so rarely is.  Image rather modestly doesn't announce the added bonus of the original commercials this time, as well as the original interstitials; for network, sponsor and the show itself.  All this looking brand spanking new, with great scripts, direction and guest stars.  Some of the most powerful and intelligent drama one could hope for, with surprising unpredictability.  More please.",1118448000,13,579,5.239130434782608
2246300,4,B0007WFXUI,"This is the predecessor to today's crime drama television, particularly shows like Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blue.  If you are a Law & Order fan, then Naked City is the show that was basically ripped almost shot for shot and line for line.  This is truly one of the best TV series of the golden age of television.  Dark, gritty, as true to life as it can get.  The real star(s) in this show were New York City itself, and the guest stars.  The recurring characters played by Paul Burke and Horace McMahon were really as much voyeurs as the at-home viewers.  Their characters, like the ones on Law & Order, really are there to service a plot.  We learn very little about them over the show's 4 year run.  They represent all detectives in the big apple, not just specific ones, who encounter 8 million different stories in the naked city.",1117065600,6,837,4.42483660130719
2246301,5,B0007WFXUI,"Image Entertainment must be pleased with sales of its seven previous four-episode DVDs. So pleased that it has released the first Box Set, comprising three DVDs - totaling twelve episodes from the 1961-62 seasons. At under $30 CDN, this box set is a bargain; especially since Image is ""playing fair"" by ensuring its content does not duplicate any episodes from the previously released single DVDs. Ironically, Disc 1 starts out with a weakly scripted ""The Fault in Our Stars"" that plays out like a bad Hardy Boys book. This is quickly forgiven when one sees ""A Memory of Crying,"" an stellar episode that typifies everything that makes Naked City more than just a police drama. Disc 2 starts with ""The Fingers of Henri Tourelle,"" a craftfully scripted whodunit, followed by ""Which is Joseph Creeley,"" a brilliantly conceived and executed (no pun intended) episode that belies the brain-dead and simplistic nature of most other police dramas of the early '60s. Best of all, a trite happy ending is omitted, and the viewer is left to make his/her own judgment in this legal and moral dilemna. All four episodes are exceptionally strong on Disc 2 and I would suggest saving this one for viewing last! Finally, Disc 3 contains another four strong episodes, none of which will disappoint. I was particularly touched by ""The Face of the Enemy,"" an episode laden with a strong message and a sympathetic bent for the tormented war hero. This viewer would give this collection a conservative 10/12 on episode satisfaction. Artwork and included literature is still modest, but Image has started to include original sponsor commercials and station breaks - something that will please the enjoyer of nostalgia. Overall, I would heartily recommend this Box Set 1 to any fan of Naked City, as well as those who aren't yet, like police dramas, but are sick of watching trite, predictable, and downright silly Dragnet re-runs and have much higher expectations of the genre. Naked City will meet AND exceed them by far.",1116806400,14,2001,4.958333333333333
2246302,5,B0007WFXUI,"Image doesn't even promote it on the packaging, but all 12 of these episodes include the original commercials.  There are spots for Raleigh cigarettes, Bufferin, AC spark plugs, Listerine and many more.  And, because Image went back to the original network prints to create these DVDs, they also include the original ""Brought to you by..."" billboards at the beginning and end of each episode.

I'm grateful to Image Entertainment for releasing NAKED CITY, and hope they'll release more episodes soon!",1115683200,74,500,5.225
2246303,5,B0007WFXUI,"Naked City is a tremendous TV show.  I just bought this set and I haven't been able to put it down!  Classic performances from Roddy McDowall, Jack Klugman, Maureen Stapleton and many others.  I agree with the previous reviewer.  Naked City is MUCH more than a typical police drama.  It is an influential drama that really shows both sides of the crime: from the police point of view as well as the criminal.  You see a lot of that in today's police dramas.  I have all the Naked City DVD's that have come from Image Entertainment and they should be commended for bringing out this collection to a new generation.",1115424000,9,613,4.5181818181818185
2246304,5,B0007WFXUI,"When people of a certain age talk about the golden age of television, they mean television drama (""Lucy"" aside, have you ever SEEN ""My Little Margie""?). And, when they talk about drama they mostly talk about the live shows, Studio One, Kraft Theater, etc. But only a few talk about what was arguably the most consistently best drama series of all; the filmed-on-the-streets-of-New York ""Naked City"", and, if they do, they talk about it as if it were a cop show. Sure, the regular cast were all cops, and, sure, the kick-off for each episode was some sort of crime, but calling Naked City a cop show is like calling ""Citizen Kane"" a movie about newspapers. The real Naked City was a series of stories (each week one of ""eight million"") about people in extremis. There were (mostly) dramas, there were comedies, and, in keeping with its era, more than a few ""Theater of the Absurd"" pieces. Just watch the first episode in this box set, ""The Fault in Our Stars"", and be treated, not only to a masterful performance by Roddy McDowall as an actor who will, literally, kill to perform, but by some of the most intelligent writing and direction TV has EVER produced. Add to that what is easily the most realistic study of police work and you've got a sure winner. If you can watch this episode and NOT want to see them all, then my friend, you don't know what makes truly great TV!",1115164800,104,1374,4.522088353413655
2246305,4,B0007WFXUI,"I read the warning that this and other DVDs may not function on DVD players / recorders that have been shipped to Australia. My DVD recorder is a Panasonic and the documentation does indicate that it will only play DVDs in this regional zone (which is different to USA). As I had previously purchased other 60's TV shows on DVD from Amazon (and they worked), I thought what the heck, give it a go. Much to my delight I am experiencing no problems.

Harry Bellaver and Horrace McMahon play great support roles to Paul Burke in this outstanding 60's series. That was my memory of the series and the reviewing confirmed my belief. Obviously those that were involved in the design of the packaging did not consider that the target audience had a clue who Paul Burke and the others were because none are featured on the cover and guest artists are featured instead. This is an insult in particular to Paul Burke who starred in a number of excellent TV shows as well as in motion pictures.

Enough of the negatives. The series is excellent and the characters are likeable and believable. Like most 60's TV shows, they get on with the story rather than waste huge chunks of each episode on the personal trials and tribulations of the key players.

Memory of course can play tricks and mine did. I would have bet money that there were 10 million stories in the Naked City but in fact there are 8 million. What a great line it was.

Buy and you will enjoy.",1209513600,5,1447,4.46969696969697
2246306,5,B0007WFXUI,I WILL BE BUYING MORE OF THE NAKED CITY SERIES AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. GOOD QUALITY. I AM A SATISFIED CUSTOMER AS ITS JUST AS IF I WAS WATCHING IT 40 YEARS AGO.,1208476800,2,161,3.909090909090909
2246307,5,B0007WFXUI,"The 138 episodes (all in B&W) of the police drama ""Naked City"" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1958-1963.  The series started in a 30-minute format (39 episodes), took a year long break and then returned in a 60-minute format.  The series was filmed in the old Biograph Studios in the Bronx, famous as the studio where D.W. Griffith got his start.

Image Entertainment's 3 DVD release ""Naked City - Set 1"" contains an assortment of  twelve of the hour-long episodes from seasons 2 and 3.  The titles, episode numbers, and original air-dates are detailed below.

Although the title makes it sound like a racy exploitation series it is actually the total opposite.  Many consider this gritty crime drama the best ever of its genre and the title reflects a focus on stripping away the glamour off NYC and exposing its ugly inside; at least to the extent that they could get away with on broadcast television during those years.

""Naked City"" is a follow-up to the 1948 film noir feature of the same name.  Both movie and television series utilized extensive location shooting and they definitely have a different feel than the Hollywood product of that era.  Also unusual was featuring jazz music by Billy May and Nelson Riddle.

The show never stopped changing its cast.  It was a bit like ""Police Story"" in this regard as it made its guest stars (it drew a lot of big names from Broadway) the show's greatest asset.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.

2246308,5,B0007WFXUI,"This film-inspired TV series was the bridge between movies and television.  It features NYC complete with returning WWII veterans, refugees, the city when it was discrete neighborhoods within all of the boroughs - and it is the Prototype for all police procedurals to come.

My family was involved with the Judicial System of Manhattan & The Bronx - and things had changed in the 1960s - but the remnants were still there.

Watch these films and see the interaction of blacks, whites, eastern europeans, hispanic and a dash of everything else.  The city wasn't the racist entity of the 1970s in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

This show starts with an introduction of what life on the streets was before TV - good life - kids playing, markets, people working and a story about living in the greatest city of them all at a golden time.

I remember two from childhood reruns - I agree with a prior reviewer that the show should be marketed in sequence - but I assume that some of the shows are harder to transfer than others and - perhaps a few have been lost - never the less, buy this set and the Criterion Collection Film of Naked City and you will be very pleased, indeed.",1183852800,8,1175,4.492957746478873
2246309,5,B0007WFXUI,"I originally saw this show in the mid-1990s.  I had never heard of it before but was absorbed by the stories and impressed by the acting.  The show wasn't on long and I never had a glimpse of it again.  When I saw the DVDs on sale, I was thrilled since I hadn't seen the show in so long but had fond memories of it's excellence.  After viewing the 1st DVD set of the show is no disappointment.  The show is every bit of good as I remember.  It's definitely one of the greatest shows ever made.
All of the episodes in this set are wonderful but my favorites are The Face of the Enemy and Oofus Goofus.  Both episodes provide a tour de force role for a great actor - Jack Warden and MIckey Rooney.  I highly recommend this set and hope you buy it soon.",1183248000,6,750,4.054421768707483
2246310,5,B0007WFXUI,It was really nice to see some ad breaks and commercials included in this series!  Superb example of the golden age of television.,1179100800,5,130,4.6521739130434785
2246311,2,B0007WFXUI,"This is the famous tv show in  which the narrator always said in the epilogue ""THERE ARE 8 MILLION STORIES IN THE NAKED CITY , THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THEM.""A more descriptive closing statement would have been ""there are 8 million neurotics in the naked city""..and  in each episode you get to see what finally drove them over the edge! On the plus side you also get to see many great actors cut their teeth  on demanding parts for each week the guest stars are the main focus  ; they have most of the lines and film time.. ahhh a would be  actors dream, and  that dream  was fulfilled too  , for the casting  right down to the extras  was surperb! Seeing nyc in 1958 is also nostalgic( i was born there in 53')and the black and white helps bring out the grim and grit that IS the concrete gray city of  MANHATTAN.

However, you may find that watching episodes about one irrational big city casualty after another DISTRESSFUL, DEPRESSING AND DRAINING! Never thought i could burn out from watching a T.V. SHOW but some shows are best watched once a week!  "" THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THEM""!",1178668800,7,1080,4.34
2246312,5,B0007WFXUI,"The gritty realism of police work filmed on location in the streets of New York, with terrific plots and great acting.  One of my favorite shows from the golden age of television.

I am just very disappointed that Image Entertainment did not produce this show in complete season sets, as they did with The Twilight Zone.  As it stands, there are 3 volume sets available that contain 12 episodes each and 6 additional sets that contain 4 episodes each.  For a total of just 60 episodes of this great television drama.  This show lasted 6 years and there were 137 episodes made.  Less than half the episodes are available on DVD.",1175990400,19,627,4.603603603603603
2246313,5,B0007WFXUI,"I had not seen a single episode of Naked City before ordering this set; I hadn't even heard of it before. I was very pleasantly surprised. The quality is uneven, as with any TV series: Some of the episodes suffer from convoluted scripts (""Let Me Die before I Wake""); weak humor (""Take and Put,"" ""To Walk Like a Lion""), or sentimentality; but for the most part they are absorbing and surprisingly gritty. ""Face of the Enemy,"" about a tormented war hero, ends with the deaths of eight people, mostly innocent bystanders--no big deal in today's TV dramas, but a veritable slaughter by the standards of 1961. Other episodes, like ""Which is Joseph Creeley,"" about a man driven to homicidal behavior by a brain tumor, are thought-provoking. The guest actors are mostly excellent--particularly Jack Warden, himself a veteran, who portrayed the soldier in ""Face of the Enemy,"" but also Roddy McDowell, Mickey Rooney, Jack Klugman, and others. The DVD presentation is fine--I especially liked the contemporary TV ads.

My only complaints: (1) Why can't Image issue the complete series, season by season, instead of just selected episodes? They seem to have passed over many superior episodes just because they didn't contain name actors.

(2) Lt. Adam Flint, with his looks of slack-jawed befuddlement, and gasping sincerity, annoys the hell out of me. So does his pert girlfriend, and their nauseating love-talk! But that's just me, I guess!",1171324800,10,1433,5.067796610169491
2246314,5,B0007WFXUI,"Excellent! ""There are 8 million stories in the naked city, THIS is one of them."" Intellegently written and well acted the stories aren't about the cops, but what makes NYC NYC, the people. It's a blast to see NYC circa 1960. Unlike a lot of shows shot on Hollywood lots this is actually NYC. The buses, taxies, stores, streets, famous and not. NYC is as much the star as the actors! I even got a kick out of the commercials! They were every bit as bad as I remembered, and clearly illustrate why the government came up with truth in advertizing laws!",1158105600,13,550,4.401960784313726

I was looking forward to watching the opening moment where a flyover of the city of New York is shown with the introduction narrated by the director.
