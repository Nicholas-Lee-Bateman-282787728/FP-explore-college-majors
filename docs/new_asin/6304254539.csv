7865752,1,6304254539,"This video is basically a biography of George Bernard Shaw, but not of the quality of A&E's Biography!  I was expecting to see a few scenes from Shaw's plays, but they are not shown and only barely mentioned.  Basically this video is just one unseen narrator telling the surface facts of Shaw's life as still pictures of Shaw and his family and associates are shown.  The only moving shots are some amateurish scenes of modern Dublin.  There are no interviews with professors or actors, just that one unseen narrator through the whole video.  Skip this one and wait for one by A&E.",991008000,7,581,4.6568627450980395
