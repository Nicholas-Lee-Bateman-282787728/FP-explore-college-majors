8313415,4,B001JP64P0,"THE VENGEANCE OF URSUS  (aka: REVENGE OF URSUS) opens w/ our mountainous hero, Ursus (Samson Burke) enjoying life on the farm, plowing his fields. After bidding farewell to his friend, Princess Sira (Wandisa Guira), Ursus returns, in order to save her from a band of ne'er-do-wells. Ursus decides to accompany Sira on her journey. This is a good idea, since the men that attacked her entourage were no mere bandits, but assassins! Along the way, a ferry rope ""accidentally"" snaps, sending Sira into the drink! Luckily, Ursus' mini-skirt doubles as a swimsuit! It seems that an eeevil, jealous relative has vowed to kill the unwary princess. Can Ursus see through the plot in time? Along w/ his irritating little brother -do all of these movies have insufferable kids in them?- , Ursus enters a tavern, only to twirl, toss, and twist men into pretzels, when soldiers arrive! Gathering some old friends, Ursus, the walking industrial furnace, sets out to help Sira in her hour of need. After several turns, so much treachery occurs, that it's hard to keep track of it all!  Ursus winds up undergoing a series of tests, that will either kill or exonerate him. A full-on rebellion takes place, resulting in a battle royal at the palace! In the end, Ursus finds his shirt, and there is much rejoicing...",1500854400,2,1298,4.842342342342342

8313417,2,B001JP64P0,Not the best print from a company thats usually reliable. Its choppy and looks like a dub,1483401600,,89,4.294117647058823
8313418,5,B001JP64P0,"Amazing transfer. The widescreen edition is the one you want. This might be the best transfer of a sword and sandal I have seen! Compared to the version in the Warriors Movie Pack, the difference is night and day. It must have been transferred on a top-notch telecine with a mint 35mm print and an experienced hand supervising the process. I wish the DVD had contact info, so I could call and encourage them to take on other Peplum projects. But as it's in the public domain, no company is given.",1480809600,2,496,4.461538461538462
8313419,4,B001JP64P0,"Great old fashion acting, and drama.",1473292800,,36,5.166666666666667

8313421,4,B001JP64P0,"This was another classic example of Italian film making. The main character was pretty much Hercules unchained only without Steve Reeves. the movie is limp sinked, naturally being Italian and all but unlike the other ones this one was kind of entertaining. Ursus is a bad ___ and he is exceptionally strong and the evil king was pretty much an American actor whom I have seen in other films. The ultimate tale of vengeance you just have to wait for it.",1440374400,2,452,4.592592592592593
8313422,4,B001JP64P0,"OK 60's English-dubbed sword-and-sandal adventure.  Ursus has to fight an evil king that is holding Ursus's sweetie hostage, the princess of a neighboring kingdom.  The usual grunts and groans.  The DVD-R, pictured below,  which I bought from Movies Unlimited is excellent quality with lovely color and a crystal clear picture.  Highly recommended for fans of the genre.",1419984000,4,370,5.421052631578948
8313423,3,B001JP64P0,"I liked the movie, typical sword and sandal fare. The only problem I had was with the star, Samson Burke. I didn't mind his stiff acting but I think strong-man heroes should sport a beard. I don't know, that's just me.",1413158400,,218,4.341463414634147
8313424,1,B001JP64P0,have a weakness to these type of Italian made movies--voices dubbed -but this is one of the worst made and acted movies.--save you money,1392940800,,136,4.708333333333333
