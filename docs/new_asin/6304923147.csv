7879788,3,6304923147,There should be a begining to this educational video and an end it does NOT show clothing or casketing the body which leave's this video unfinished.,1020470400,,148,4.730769230769231
7879789,1,6304923147,"Upon opening the video package and observing the length of tape, my expectation plummeted.  I knew this could not be the ""whole story"" and I was correct.  While presented with style and ""taste"" and interesting fact about the history of the subject, it nevertheless glossed over the details of the procedure and left almost everything else to the imagination of the viewer. Anyone truly interested in the process would want to see it from ""pickup of the deceased"" to ""disposal of the remains"". This video left a big gap, infact ""they"" may as well have saved the time and money invested producing this ""documentary??"" Do it RIGHT, that is film it as it happens in real life and forget the sugar coating!!!",1004486400,3,703,4.754098360655738
7879790,4,6304923147,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I purchased this a few years ago. Very little material has been available to the general public on the subject of embalming. It appears to me that the funeral industry doesn't want us to know.

This video gives you a behind the scenes look at what goes on in the prep room and shows some aspects of the embalming process.

For a video that is just under an hour I think it's done quite well and is very professional.

The video could be even better if there were restorative arts and casketing included, but the video would have to be longer.

In closing, I will say that after seeing this I decided that direct cremation is my choice over being embalmed. I think everyone should see a film like this to understand the purpose behind embalming, but also to be able to make an informed decision about whether or not you want it as part of your funeral arrangements.",1003536000,10,904,4.395209580838324
7879791,4,6304923147,"This is a good video for the average person who would like to know what goes on during a typical embalming operation. It is not really ""gruesome"", however it is graphic. If you are thinking about funeral service as a career it shows you the basics. If you are a presently studying Mortuary science (as I am) this is not the video to replace your embalming texts in preparation for finals!!!LOL!!.",986515200,6,396,4.591549295774648
7879792,5,6304923147,I work as a intern embalmer and the video is very good on  showing what is done in the prep room.,979862400,,97,3.619047619047619
7879793,4,6304923147,"I purchased the tape because I was very courious as to what actually went on in those Funeral Homes.  THis tape is very good.  It outlines the procedure step by step, and personally, it reminds me of my Anatomy class  when they spoke about the veins and arteries.  I urge anyone who is  courious just as i was to purchase the tape.  I wish there were others that  would actually go further with the preparation, ie: dressing and the  transport of the body after it was embalmed.  If anyone know of any other  tapes available, please post..  thanks",950054400,3,547,4.479591836734694
7879794,4,6304923147,It was very entertaining and informative video. It shows what basically goes on in the prep-room without getting to detailed. Good for the funeral student or the curious. I highly recomend it for everyone.,940464000,3,205,5.0588235294117645
