Andrews Blu-ray Review: If you are any kind of fan of the 1990s action films, then STONE COLD [1991] this one is an absolute necessity. The film that tried to turn legendary Brian Keith Bosworth, nicknamed ""The Boz"" who was originally a former professional American football player who played as a line-backer for the National Football League's  Seattle Seahawks who was thrust into an action star muscle hunk, and I have to express my excitement that this particular film has finally arrived and available on this brilliant 101 Films Blu-ray disc, which is all thanks to this brilliant British Company 101 Films, who now produces these brilliant cult classic films, and especially STONE COLD has been spending years out of print especially on an inferior DVD, where copies have been fetching upwards of large sums of money either on Amazon and eBay, now there is no excuse not to have it in your own Blu-ray Collection.

As most mainstream action films of this genre, which by the way, has for some time been going out of fashion, having been replaced primarily by superhero films and big budget films, getting further away from the kinds of things that defined 1990s action films at your local cinema, like iconic heroes, practical stunts and first-rate 2nd unit work and especially films like STONE COLD continue to age better and better. Sure, it's a product of its time, 1991 to be exact, otherwise known as the best year for action films ever, if for no other reason than the casting of Brian Bosworth in the lead, but director Craig R. Baxley makes films that are both incredibly efficient and accomplished while still making an action packed film that is deliriously over the top, and directs films, especially STONE COLD with lunatic competence.

STONE COLD has it all: bikers, bloodshed, babes, Brian Bosworth. There is a giant lizard, who is Brian Bosworths pet and men in bikini briefs. There's Lance Henriksen and William Forsythe trying to out crazy each other. There's Sam McMurray playing a cop. It's not an action film that moves in fits and starts, coming to life during the fights or shootouts and then grinding to a halt in the expositional scenes. It's entertaining all the way through, in part because of the colourful subculture in which the film is set and in part because Craig R. Baxley directs the whole film at the same wild, rowdy pitch, where you can practically smell the beer, cigarette smoke, bike exhaust and Brian Bosworth.

The film was a massive box office flop when it was released in 1991, grossing just $9 million on a budget of $25 million. It has since discovered a life on certain cable stations and home video, having become a cult classic of the genre and completing Craig R. Baxley's trilogy of awesomeness. I can see this being a film that required time to find its audience; it's too hard-core for the fair weather genre fans and got lost amidst the shuffle of great action films released that year. I'm happy to see this particular wrong being righted, even if it has taken almost 25 years to get there.

I love STONE COLD Brian Bosworth made a fantastic action star, and its a mystery why this star faded so quickly. Brian Bosworth made a handful of good action films like Back in Business and One Mans Justice, but Brian Bosworth eventually began starring in films that didn't give him the potential to onto greater films. Director Craig R. Baxley gives STONE COLD a verve no other director could have given it, and its filled with great moments, one-liners, and bad attitude characters that have their moments.

But best of all there is the awesome stunts! Bikes crashing out windows and exploding on helicopters! Chase sequences where bad guys smash their bikes onto oncoming traffic! When somebody is fighting in this film and they hurl somebody, and they really over the top throwing them! I mean people can really fly! These biker dudes entertain themselves by shooting bear cans off of their shoulders! With machine guns! Which again gives a totally fun action film that is well over the top, and totally crazy. The rest of the cast is composed of real life bikers, which adds a bit more credibility to the proceedings. There is this one scene where all the bikers are shooting their guns, and watching these two guys kicking each others butts like some type of Gladiator show or something, which is a great scene, everyone is crazy, all going over the top and out of control, so gotta give kudos to this film for making these scenes genuine by using real bikers. So all in all it is not a bad action film, actually it is pretty cool one from the 1990s! Which is right up there with Sylvester Stallones COBRA film? Good for a laugh, and definitely lots of good over the top fun.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Once again the cult film company 101 Films, has brought us STONE COLD once again with a brilliant 1080p high definition transfer that really stands out, and an equally impressive 1.85:1 aspect ratio and for the most part 101 Films has done a very professional job. Colours are reproduced very nicely and black levels look really nice and especially deep skin tones that are totally natural looking and detail is pretty strong throughout the film. On top of all that sharpness and contrast are equally excellent and there are no noticeable issues with any compression artefacts and the image presentation seems completely devoid of digital trickery like noise reduction or edge enhancement. Grain is slightly present throughout the film, but does not detract from a brilliant print overall, and the depth of the image remains impressive for pretty much the entire film. STONE COLD looks absolutely brilliant on this 101 Films Blu-ray disc release. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Once again the cult film company 101 Films, has brought us STONE COLD once again in a stunning 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo track, and the audio clarity of this Blu-ray disc is very good. The composed music score by Sylvester Levay sounds absolutely stunning and has a really decent range to it and the dialogue is very easy to understand. There are no problems with any hiss or distortion to note and the levels are properly balanced throughout the film. The sound effects have a massive punch behind them and the rumble of those motorcycle engines has good weight behind it and really gives your speakers a brilliant workout.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

A beautiful designed and printed Reversible Blu-ray Cover Sleeve.

A stunning colourful full-size cult Poster.

Finally, STONE COLD release is so awesome it deserves an amazing special edition Blu-ray release, but of course it means that now all of Craig R. Baxley's films are now available in 1080p HD, proof that we are living in the best of all times. Part of me never thought this day would come, but here we are, and its 1990s Action Day for STONE COLD is in my Blu-ray Collection, so make sure it's on yours too. If you enjoy old school action cult film of the 1980s, with all of the exploitation ingredients at play; then do yourself a favour and gun down STONE COLD; it's one of the best of its kind! It is also a stunner of an action packed film that will keep you on the edge of your seats in this guilty pleasure action packed film and this film is just way too much fun!

No-one under 18 should not be allowed to view this Blu-ray disc as this film is not suitable for children, because this film contains Very Strong Violence.

1366656,5,B00004X07E,"Brian Boswall makes his acting debut as Joe Huff, a ""tough guy"" Alabama cop. He's got a bada** mullet, typically walks around with a smirk plastered on his face, and wears earrings. Joe is currently serving a 3 month suspension for displaying excessive violence towards criminals. After stopping a supermarket robbery one night, Joe meets Agent Cunningham in a parking garage who blackmails Joe into going undercover for a certain mission, or he'll turn his 3 week suspension into 6 months without pay.

His mission is to travel undercover to Mississippi and pose as a biker named John Stone, to infiltrate The Brotherhood; a dangerous, white supremacist, militia-like gang, linked to the murders of several government officials and suspected of dealing drugs to the mafia. The leader of this group is a man by the name of Chains Cooper, an unnecessarily psychotic and violent man who--along with The Brotherhood is trying to be brought down the governor, Brent Whipperton.

Joe soon finds himself walking amongst a group of untrustworthy animals, mastering in cruelty and fueled by violence, greed, rage, and hatred. And if Joe isn't careful, he may very well just unwillingly find himself their next victim.

Overall: Stone Cold is an underrated, hardcore, 90s action flick. It doesn't just have explosions and gun fights to be cute. It has a solid plot that unravels with unbridled action. The bad guys of this flick really make you hate them and want to see them get their just desserts. Another thing I love, is that the one-liners in Stone Cold aren't corny. They actually sound really clever and extreme. A lot of the kill scenes in this film are brutal and raw. But it's the final action packed scene that really tops off this movie. Stone Cold moves at a fast pace--almost too fast, but it's one that will keep you intrigued beginning to end. I hope everyone in this film got paid extra for their spectacular performances. It's baffling to know that this movie did so poorly when it first came out and that Bosworth even got a Razzie award nomination for worst new star. Seriously, he wasn't that bad. Overall, you're not bound to find too many more action films that be on the same mega-macho level as Stone Cold. It just has everything to satisfy your action movie needs. It just disappoints me that Bosworth wasn't in more flicks like these back in the day. Overall, Stone Cold is a movie that you NEED to add to your collection. Whether you're a fan of 90s action films, Brian Bosworth films, or both; there's no reason for this not to be in your DVD set",1454803200,,2567,4.751121076233184

I'll bet all the pot bellied fat assed bikers in the world eat their hearts out wanting to be these guys! Henriksen  and Bosworth aren't your typical baloney armed zit faces you see posturing on their hack-imaged Harleys with their porcine honeys. For my money the best real bad ass biker was William Smith, he wasn't to shabby in Darker Than Amber with Rod Taylor either.

1366687,5,B00004X07E,"This is one of the most under-rated Action Films of the early 90's
(Along with I Come in Piece, Showdown in Little Tokyo, Split Second, &  If Looks Could Kill)
I seen this early on in  90's on a beat up rented VHS Tape and have loved it ever since
It's a Truly Perfect Action flick! It's violent and over the top fun
This was Former NFL Player Brian Bosworth first feature film (That was meant to make him a top action star)
Sadly it didn't which i honestly don't understand
He is awesome in this role his performance is really good for a green former football player
he carries a lot of this film and you'd never know this was his first major acting gig!
Brain plays  Joe Huff  a Alabama cop that is forced to go under cover for the FBI
to gather evidence against this Neo-Nazi Biker Gang known as The Brotherhood
This biker gang is ruthless they blow up one judge at the start of the film
The leader of the Brotherhood is the one and only
Lance Henriksen who plays Chains  (This is one of Lance's most under-rated performances it's so good he makes such a great ""evil"" demented bad guy)
One of his top lieutenants in the gang is Ice played by the great character actor William Forsythe
Another stand out performance all around he is scary in this film and so good
you also have a young Sam McMurray playing Joe's FBI Handler Lance (you might not know the name but, if you see his face you'll know his work he's done everything)
The film is a simple under-cover cop movie with tons of insane violence
Great action sequences and a super fast pace
I've seen this film at least 50 times it's such a great hidden gem of a action film that deserves more credit then it gets
The Original Cut would'be been NC-17 so the studio made plenty of cuts to get a Rated R Version
On IMDB it only gets a 5.8 (great example imdb is a joke as far as there ratting system goes)
It's at least a solid 8 maybe higher
It's a real alpha male film
It finally gets a much needed BR Home Video release thanks to Olive Films
It's bare bones but, in the US Better then the terrible MGM DVD put out years ago
There is a 2-Disc BR Set but, it's region (B) and super pricey
I was hoping this would've been released by Shout Factory in a Uncut NC-17 Collectors Edition but, no such luck
I only watched half the BR so far it's a pretty good HD Transfer there is no other HD version to compare it to besides the super expensive 2 disc (Region B)  version which i have put off getting due to the price!
Over all I'm happy to at least get a official BR version even though it's bare
better then nothing
It's 83min. long (They got so much action into that short amount of times It's incredible)

I Love this film to death they really don't make action films like this anymore 9/10",1440028800,,2744,4.195445920303605

1366700,4,B00004X07E,"Its quite a treat these days to see movies that lined the shelves of video stores during their heyday finding their way to blu-ray finally. For the most part these movies aren't classics that will be hailed at some future date in the Library of Congress archives but there were indeed part of the mainstay of those classic mom and pop stores of the past. Shelves then were not just filled with only major motion pictures releases but tons of movies that went direct to video but were quality made product anyway.

Such was the case with several films starring former football pro turned actor Brian Bosworth. His first foray into the silver screen came with this movie, STONE COLD, where he plays a Dirty Harry style undercover cop with the most amazing mullet ever seen on film. Bosworth stars as Joe Huff, a take no prisoners kind of cop on temporary leave of absence for insubordination. When the film opens hes seen shopping in a grocery store in the midst of a robbery/hostage situation. Ala every tough cop at the time he takes out the bad guys with ease only to be reprimanded because hes on leave.

When all is said and done Huff is approached by the FBI to go undercover for them on an important mission. A biker gang called the Brotherhood has been increasing their criminal activities to the point where theyve recently killed a judge who dared to pass sentence on one of their own in a murder case. Having stepped over the line the powers that be want them taken out at all costs. This is where Huff comes in. Riding his own bike, sporting a long black leather coat and endearing himself to the gang by helping in the midst of a fight that breaks out in one of their bars/strip joints, he gets an invitation to one of their outings.

While a weak member of the gang he helped thinks hed make a great prospect, sergeant at arms Ice (William Forsythe) doesnt trust him. As Joe Stone, Huff makes an impression at the outing by beating Ice in a race and by beating up their biggest tough guy in a hand to hand fight. The groups leader Chains (Lance Henriksen) thinks hed be an asset as well much to the displeasure of Ice. He gives Stone/Huff a chance to prove himself while at the same time running a background check on him with his own undercover person in law enforcement.

Stone/Huff helps when needed and finds himself in the middle of a confrontation between the Brotherhood and the local mob. In the middle of this confrontation he comes to the aid of Chains old lady Nancy (Arabella Holzbog) and the two begin to form an attraction to one another. In her case hes a possible way out of the gang, in his a possible weak link in the outfit who he might be able to convince to provide testimony to put them all away.

As the movie progresses the Brotherhood has set their sights on a state politician running for governor on a law and order platform. Promising to rid the state of this illegal biker gang he finds himself the target of their wrath. Just what they plan for him isn't revealed until the last third of the film. Will Stone/Huff be able to keep his cover long enough to stop this deal from happening? Will Nancy turn states evidence? And will a final confrontation between Stone/Huff and Chains eventually take place?

The movie offers a great combination of action, biker and undercover cop genres. It also presents Bosworth as a decent actor whose onscreen persona fit those direct to video movies, never quite being good enough to make it to major releases but solid enough to make a living as an action star in his own right. As bad guys Forsythe and Henriksen both stand out here showing why their careers have lasted as long as they have. Both continue to make movies and have added some fantastic characters to their list of achievements over the years.

Well made, well shot and filled with plenty of action, this is the type of movie that filled those long forgotten video store shelves that actually rented well when there. It was a time when viewers weren't sold only on the hottest Hollywood release but actually gave movies like this a chance when checking out the shelves. Many of those movies became cult classics in their own right and this was one of those. Olive Films has done a service to those who remember walking down those narrows sets of shelves that held hidden treasure by releasing movies like this on blu-ray. A fun time for those who loved these types of movies and one to add to the collection for those who miss those days.",1436313600,,4482,4.5055350553505535

If you liked ""Billy Jack"" and ""Roadhouse"" you are in luck.  This one has some great clich fights, chases love interests and all of the 80's bad production values that makes this a classic.  The costume designer won an Oscar for dressing up Bosworth in every bad choice possible from bikini briefs to a weird blade runner / civil war overcoat that would have been laughed at even in the real world of 80's crappy clothes.  This one was hard to find on DVD for a while but it has a special spot in my collection.  I wish Bosworth did more films.  With a bit better acting he could have been big.  He has a great screen presence and was tough in real life on the field.

The acting in the movie I thought was great but I've heard others say it sucks, I'm assuming that's their opinion because it's just simply an action movie with no uber deep story line behind it. Just a lawless biker gang doing what they do until someone tries intervening.

Brian Bosworth is not bad as undercover super-cop stone trying to bust a gang before they can carry out an insane plot that becomes a suicide mission as they storm the white house! Scene stealers Lance Henriksen and William Forsythe are the epitome of charismatic psychos. The stunts in this are amazing with people jumping out of helicopters, motorcycle crashes, falls, brawls, and not to mention all the explosions and gun fights. The dialog is right-on as the tough talk, insults, and comebacks fly fast and furious. The body count would make Rambo proud and earns its ""R"" rating. I would put this movie up there with the best of what Schwarzeneger could do at the time. Arguably Henriksen's greatest role as he uses every opportunity to tear up scenes. 16x9 dvd picture and audio is great but no trailer!",1229040000,,949,4.828220858895706
1366770,4,B00004X07E,"Obviously ""Boz"" hasn't made a career in movies any more than Howie Long did, but I love their movies. I personally think movies like this are just fun. Now granted the guys will probably like them better as their is lots of T&A in this one, but the acting isn't bad, and the sets and music are good. Brian Bosworth plays a cop on suspension that is coerced by the FBI to go undercover and join a biker gang to take them down. Lance Henriksen and William Forsyth do a good job of playing the bad guys. Having rode with the Salty Dawgs many many years ago and knowing other clubs I have to say this is fairly realistic biker movie. The meet in the movie reminded me of one of the barbeques I went to when I rode. The statement ""Colors never run"", is a code with all bikers and a fellow biker saved my life once so it isn't something you forget. Good quality DVD but no extras. Decent replayability.

1366774,5,B00004X07E,"At last, I can retire my played-to-death VHS recording from Cinemax. This is a certified 5-star great ""bad"" movie. Bosworth really can't act, and yet, he does a great job with the lead character. Arabella Holzbog REALLY can't act, which probably explains why this flick didn't make her a household name. Her presence is required to set up a pretty predictable plot twist that happens in the second half of the film. I won't give a spoiler, but if you don't see this one coming from a mile away, you probably haven't watched a lot of movies. No one's going to accuse the writers of pushing the envelope.

But the one-two punch of Lance Henriksen and William Forsythe as biker bad guys? I've seen a number of movies from both actors, ranging from big budget to no budget, and this one's my all-time personal favorite. Henriksen really chews up the scenery, savoring every last bit of bad-guy  bravado. Forsythe goes for the real 1% turf. Together, they're the reason why you'll watch this more than once.

Like any good ""bad"" movie, this one's going to require you to suspend disbelief, and on more than one occasion. There's an abundance of things ""blowing up real good,"" and lots of chunky, fuzzy rhythm guitar in the soundtrack.

Sam McMurray, as Bosworth's germ-phobic undercover sidekick, adds a touch of heavy-handed comic relief to the gunshots and roar of heavy metal thunder.

Drugs! Bikers! Undercover cops! Explosions! Face it, when you're flipping channels late on a Friday or Saturday night, this exactly the kind of flick you're hoping to stumble upon. Stumble no more.",1208649600,,1581,4.840740740740741
1366775,3,B00004X07E,"This movie is more like a typical Steven Seagal flick than, say, the Terminator or Dirty Harry films, or even Seagal's own Under Siege, and not because of the budget.  It just doesn't try to be anything better.  When it comes to plot, script, character development, and so on, not much effort is made to do anything more than the minimum needed to stick to the formula and get from one explosion and bloody confrontation to the next.  Which seems a waste to me, since the talent and money were there to make this a better movie, if anyone had cared at all.

As a corrective to the very high rating this movie has here, consider that the IMDb average viewer rating for it is currently 4.9/10, which is strictly mediocre.  (For comparison, Under Siege is rated by viewers at 6.2/10.)

To illustrate the needlessly weak points, this a movie in which if you need to get a submachine gun into a courtroom you just dress up like a priest and when the metal detector goes off, you show them your little cross pendant.  Need to get out of a flying helicopter?  Jump fifty feet down through some glass and you're fine.  Shoot at a car or crash a motorcycle and it goes up like it's filled with napalm and lit matches, every time.  Need to create some suspense?  Have someone call and say they've found that the driver's license records of the undercover hero are ""cross-indexed"" to another name.  Want to maximize the body count?  Why not have the bad guys actually succeed in killing all their targets before the hero manages to give them a taste of their own medicine?  (I think he did manage to save a secretary.)  Need a bit of romance?  Set it up, show the kiss, and just waste it at the end.  It's impossible to guess why the bad guys didn't just kill the hero like they did everyone else, except of course that he was the hero.  Some of the plot elements are only vaguely connected.

Well, you know if such things matter to you.

I mentioned talent.  On the plus side, Bosworth isn't a great actor, but he was good enough to be in a much better movie.  He's big and beefy and projects a suitably cool power.  The film has an effectively gritty look and feel; most of the supporting roles are well enough filled; the motorcycles sound great and you get to see them a lot; the action overall is pretty good, particularly the helicopter stunts (before the jumping out part).

If you don't expect much of what makes for a superior film, or if you take pleasure in the common defects of this kind of movie, you'll probably enjoy it.  Otherwise, don't bother.",1206403200,,2551,4.434408602150538

1366784,5,B00004X07E,"I think this early 90's classic speaks for itself. If you love great action movies or were a fan of the Boz this movie is for you. Fast moving great action all the time some cheezy lines but what do you expect it's a B movie with your basic biker plot. I personally have been waiting for this to come to region one as the non region dvd's it was available on were recorded very crappy.

As for the dvd itself I think it is very good for what it is. List price on most major outlet sites is $[...] and if you are spending $[...] that isn't bad for this product. It is important to remember that Stone Group Pictures Company originally put out this movie and went out of business shortly there after. This movie was shot in 1:33:1 and was bought out by Columbia pictures who is the company who brought it to HBO and let the movie be played for quite a few years through the early to late 90's. Although the movie was put out in a limited amount of theaters it's the main purpose Stone Group had was to sell it to cable TV so that is why it was shot in 1:33. Now the movie has changed hands again as MGM is behind the dvd. I agree with the other guy on here who complained about the widescreen version. It is crap a bunch of the picture is cut out but that is the best they could do to make it widescreen and these days that is all people want. To take a 1:33 image and reduce it to 1:85 or even worse in some cases as bad as 235:1 it kills the picture. You have to watch for this stuff if you are a widescreen buf. Usually it will say on the back of the DVD that it is ""matted widescreen"" which means they took a bigger image and reduced it to make it widescreen because the negative they had was not compatiable to be made into a true widescreen as is the case in this B movie flick. Anyway for those of you who love this movie set you widescreen TV to 4:3 mode put the dvd on the fullscreen side and sit back and enjoy the show. I did and enjoyed the movie for the first time in a long time because my VHS was shot and a region free dvd I bought of it looked worse than did that of my overwatched sometimes flickering VHS.

1366794,3,B00004X07E,"I used to have season tickets to OU games back in the heady Eighties, when I watched Brian Bosworth (""The Boz"") single-handedly dismantle opposing offenses.  My goodness, could the dude play.  And. . .having garnered All American honors and a Butkus Award for outstandig play at linebacker. . .the Boz cashed in on his fame and became a first-round pick of the Seattle Seahawks--where he promptly became one of the NFL's all-time busts.  But heck, his multi-colored mullet accompanied him to Hollywood, where he made his vintage film debut in this little action thriller:  STONE COLD.

Boz plays undercover cop John Stone with the same ""I'm-so-cool"" demeanor he employed at my beloved University of Oklahoma.  The guy actually has a screen presence, albeit a mediocre one, yet he had countless experiences to cultivate his persona in front of media cameras during his college and pro career.  He doesn't come across as wooden or stiff:  that was his NFL career.  Because of his ""free spirit"" image, officer Stone infiltrates a wild band of bikers known as The Brotherhood (not to be confused with ""The Boz""), a very bad boy gang of bikers in bed with the Mafia to deliver truckloads of drugs to sweat-soaked Bubbas along the Mississippi delta.  Boz does his thing--and of course butts heads with his anal and easily excited supervisor--while he sets up a phony drug deal that will incriminate The Brotherhood, the Mafia, and bad scriptwriters.  All of this shakes loose in a wild Courthouse climax that was fun to watch while simultaneously containing epic-like suspensions of disbelief.  For example:  Boz jumps out of a helicopter, crashes through plate glass windows, hits the floor, bounces up, knocks off a couple of bad guys.  At least he could have said, ""Ouch.""  But, after all, he's the Boz.

Bosworth's debut in STONE COLD mirrored his other Hollywood offerings:  very forgettable.  I happened to come across this little mullet fest while channel surfing.  It's actually good enough to stop pushing channel buttons to watch the unbelievable action, as the Boz muscles his hog (or his ""horse,"" as he calls it) through throngs of poorly-groomed and leather-infested bikers, many of whom haven't seen a dentist since FDR sat in the White House.  Co-star Lance Henriksen steals the show as Brotherhood leader Chains (gotta love that name), a cold-blooded, diabolical firebrand who somehow reminds me of my accountant.  Only Chains is more creative, yet I digress.  STONE COLD reminds me of Brian Bosworth's illustrious collegiate career:  one heck of a lot of action, but little substance.  But I really liked the mullets.

I think the makers of this film were trying to make a serious movie and that's what makes the movie even better!

Brian pulls off his character and I am surprised that he did not do a LOT more action flicks after this one.  What can I say about Lance Henriksen as Chains but he plays it absolutely perfectly!

It is good to have Hells Angels portrayed as villians for a change; because in real life they are seriously scary. Lance Henrikson is perfect as a laid bike pyscho;with a seriously short fuse!

1366804,5,B00004X07E,"Stone Cold is actually good if brawn over brains is what you look for in an action movie and those who like their violence thick and fast with a healthy amount of one-liners will love it.
All of the movie is over-the-top, and moves from start to finish very quickly without much time for a breather in-between various action sequences. Essentially the plot revolves around our hero detective who is a bit more brutal than most and who is given the task of infiltrating a rather nasty biker-terror squad who are involved in terrorism. So you get to see the cop do lots of bad things so he can join the group and then he does lots of bad things to them when he is on the inside. It is fun, far-fetched action all the way. Guys get shot and fly through the air. Everything gets blown up!
Just watch this film and enjoy it for what it is - high-adrenaline action that never takes itself too seriously. Good fun!",1073260800,,907,4.341176470588235

1366807,5,B00004X07E,"I was skeptical when i originally flipped through the channels and saw Stone Cold, starring Brian Bosworth, but as I curiously flipped to HBO, and watched for the first time, I was hooked. This movie has it all. Great action, the Boz ruining bikers, drugs, motorcycle chases, anything you want. This might be the most underrated movie of all time. With characters like the Brotherhood's biker badasses of Chains, Ice, Tool, AWOL, Trouble Owens, and even the meek Gut, contrasting with the righteous Joe Huff/John Stone Nancy, Lance, and the Mafia (originally introduced through Demechi, who introduces himself by throwing a grenade) this movie really is a great action thriller.
 And above all, the Boz delivers what I consider to be a very good acting performance. This still is a surprise everytime I see the movie. His dialogue is well delivered, the intonation of his speech is realistic, and his actions and movements are fluid.
 The bottom line is: I love this movie.",1062806400,,973,4.96319018404908
1366808,5,B00004X07E,"John Stone (The Boz) is a rough and tough undercover cop who has made a name for himself by cracking down on the motorcycle gang scene in Alabama.  After a supermarket scuffle, he comes to a crossroad in his life.  He can either take a four month suspension or accept a dangerous FBI assignment where he must infiltrate the notorious motorcycle gang know simply as ""The Brotherhood"".  Led by Mad ""Chains"" Cooper, it is well known that the Brotherhood plan on getting revenge on Prosecutor Brent ""The Whip"" Whipperton after he unjustly sentenced their fellow brother to death for shooting a priest in the stomach with a shotgun.  Stone accepts the mission and with the help from his buddy Gut, he quickly gels with the Brotherhood like melted cheese on a beef patty.  Chains eventually discovers that Stone is not the ""bulldozer"" that he once thought, but instead ""the biggest pork chop he has ever ate"".  The fight scenes following is where Boz's acting ability truly shines.  He is a fierce thunderstorm, where his fists are the thunder and his flowing blonde mullet is the lightning bolt of destruction tearing through the hearts of the Brotherhood.  I will not spoil the brilliant ending, but I will tell you that Chains and the Brotherhood are flying first class to Painville, and Stone is checking the tickets at the gate.
 Personally, this movie has given me much joy over the years and I am certain that it will do the same for you.  Not only has Bosworth's portrayal of John Stone shed light on the dirty underbelly of American society, but he has paved the way for other NFL linebackers to follow in his footsteps (Howie Long, Broken Arrow).",1056499200,,1650,4.7177700348432055

1366810,5,B00004X07E,"Stone Cold is perhaps one of the most brilliantly scripted, highly original films I have ever seen. It delivers on all angles. The Bos is a renegade cop recruited take out the dreaded biker gang, The Brotherhood. In order to infiltrate The Brotherhood, he devises a very intelligent, yet realistic scheme. He goes to their favorite bar, alone, and decides to hit on one of the leaders girlfriends. After doing so, he is naturally accepted as one of them. This movie has it all. The EPM Ratio (Explosions Per Minute) is a refreshingly high 2.6, which will satisfy every moviegoers desire for explosions and gratuitous vilolence. Fans of the Mullet Hairstyle will be delighted as The Boz has one of the finest specimens ever captured on film. The special effects are innovative and daring, especially the scene where the helicopter explodes BEFORE the motorcycle actually crashes into it. The 1991 Academy Award snubbing of this film is still seen as one of the greatest scandals ever in Tinseltown. Buy this movie and you will see what it is like to be Stone Cold!!",1032652800,,1064,4.819672131147541
1366811,5,B00004X07E,"I would like to know why some movies get re-released and some of them just get put on the wayside.  I have over three hundred and fifty dvd's now and let me tell ya, I've seen some that I couldn't believe were put on disc.  There are so many garbage films out there that have made the transistion to dvd and there are so many quality films that you can't find for under 50 to 100 bucks, either on e-bay or from the z-shops here at amazon.  I just don't get it!  You can't find ""Back to the Future"", ""Eddie Murphy's Delirious"", ""Toy Soldiers(1991)"", and you can't find ""Stone Cold"", which in my opinion is one of the most underated movies to come out of the ninty's.  But if you want the movie ""Frogs"", or ""Food of the Gods"", you just have to go on down to your local dvd supplier and there they are.  I think the people out there who decide what is put to disc and what isn't should really get some professional help.  Not to mention that you can't even find Stone Cold on vhs anymore.  It's just unexceptable.  I'm lucky in a sence, since I still have my vhs copy and it still play's great.  But for all the people looking for this movie and all those people who own a beat up copy, I hope eventually this is either re-released on vhs or perferably on dvd.  Alright enough of my complaining.  I really don't need to bother writing a review for this film, since it's so hard to get hold of, but I will anyway.  Boz is an FBI angent and is currently suspended when some of the head boy's in the department come calling.  They tell him that they can get him reinstated if he takes this job of going undercover inside The Brotherhood, which is a local biker gang.  Lance Hendrickson and William Forsythe are the two head guys in the Brotherhood and they are some nasty s.o.b.'s.  One of the members is given life in prision for blowing away a priest during a baptisim.  When the others learn of the verdict, they rig the judge's  fishing boat with explosives.  When the judge pulls the motor cord he is blown to bits. Now the senator want's to make a point and retry Owen, in front of the surpreme court,  seaking the death penalty. That's where D-Day comes into play(more on that later).  So not wanting anymore people getting killed, they send Boz inside to get these guys.  Boz fights his way in and gains the curiousity of Chains(Lance Hendrickson).  But one of the other members, Ice(William Forsythe) is skeptical about this guy who just walks in from nowhere.  Jump ahead-Ice finds out Stone's real identity and try's to get back to the compound to let Chains know, but Boz takes care of him quickly and we continue.  The Boz has this idea how to get The Brotherhood and the Mob at the same time.  He tells Chains he knows about a truck carring P2P, and he needs protection and a buyer.  Chains goes to the Mob to buy the P2P, and they are supposed to get both parties in the deal.  But things go wrong and Boz is told by the FBI that they want to pull him out.  He says he can't back out now and goes back to the compound to collect his money.  When he gets there he finds out that he has been discovered.  The Brotherhood is going to use him as a diversion for D-Day.  The day of Owen's trial(he's the one who killed the priest) they have a plan on how to get him out.  Ice dresses up as a priest and walks right into the courtroom.  They also have connections with one guy from the military, and get a chopper.  The diversion is that they are going to throw Boz out of the chopper with explosives strapped to him and blow him up all over the sky.  When the verdict is read, and Owen is given the death penalty, Ice pulls out a machine gun and wastes all of the surpreme court justices, the lawyers and anyone else in the room.  He frees Owen and they try to make their escape, but Boz has other plans.  He gets loose in the chopper and gets into the courthouse where the final bloodbath ensues.  I'm not going to tell you the ending, you have to watch it for yourself.  This movie is a definate must have, and I'm praying they put this out on dvd.  You will not be disappionted with this film, the acting, special effects, and story are all excellent.  With all the other garbage that is out on dvd now, this is one movie that deserves to be there.

Chances are, if you've bothered to read this review, you're the type of person who'll like ""Stone Cold"".  The special effects are good, the acting's not bad, and the one-liners are great.  Sure, sometimes there are explosions for no good reason, and the plot is as loose as a Miami Vice episode, but these are not bad things.  If you're tired of computer generated ""Matrix"" kung fu scenes, and believe that the glory days of action movies were best represented by Arnold's moving performance in ""Commando"", then this is the flick for you.

The movie flows perfectly from one scene to another and keeps the viewer interested throughout.  Lance Henricksen and William Forsythe, both excellent character actors, upstage Bosworth and steal the show as the evil leaders of ""the bayou chapter of the Brotherhood"", a wickedly convincing biker gang that's out to revenge the death of one of their members besides several other plots including their dealings with the Mafia in a drug deal.  There are many excellent lines throughout the movie,  some of which I have incorporated into my personal repertoire of quotable quotes.  Despite having watched the movie many times, I still enjoy showing it to friends and do so once or twice a year.

Of course I have my vhs copy,but hate to watch it,(tapes are like tires,every run takes its toll.)Who knows though,they have been resurecting long dead music from that time(some of it not worth the effort)so maybe they will realize there are still a few bucks to be made in this area too!

No two people can play diabolical bikers better than Lance Henriksen (Hard Target) and William Forsythe (Gotti). There's heavy metal, sex, murder, mayhem, doublecross and it just keeps going. ""The BosMan"" plays and undercover biker cop trying to infilterate a local biker gang who's selling drugs. But biker leader ""Chains"" (Henriksen) isn't one to be won-over easily.  The ending is a rowdy, murderous affair only the most destructive but creative minds could conjure. There is some hero worship footage of The Boz at the end but it seems to work.  A great touch was actor Sam McMurry (Raising Arizona), partner to the BosMan. He provided great comic relief as a hypocondriac.  Hey, this is one fun time.",1003622400,,891,4.842105263157895

Lance plays Chains Cooper, the leader of the local chapter of The Brotherhood and William Forsythe is his lieutenant, Ice. Nice working partnership both as characters and as actors playing off of each other.
