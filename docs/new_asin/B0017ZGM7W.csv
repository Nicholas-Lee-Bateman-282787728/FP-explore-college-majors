8267901,3,B0017ZGM7W,"This program provides a good, if brief, look at one of the world's most dynamic air arms, as it was in April 2008.  Of course, the program was subject to the censors, but there is still a decent level of content, including video footage of the famous raid on the Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981.  Particular emphasis is placed on the fact that the age of dogfighting between opposing fighter jets has largely been replaced by armed helicopter responses to rocket attacks launched from places like Gaza.

But I cannot give more than 3 stars to any video that represents such rotten value for money.  $17.95 for 12:32 is unacceptable.  Amazon needs to take $10 off of all of the 60 Minutes video series.  Then I might give it another star.

Note that all of these videos have sound recorded at a low level, and you'll have to raise your volume control substantially.  Be sure to lower the sound level back as soon as the video is over!

Also note that the cover image depicted here is not what you get; instead the video cover is a generic one with 60 Minutes' famous stopwatch.",1380758400,,1074,4.494845360824742
