1659225,5,B00005T32K,There are no words to explain how awsome these episodes are. Well the first episode is kinda boring. The music in these episodes is so cool. I really like the English version because of the music. If only they could put the music in the Jap one that would be awsome because the Jap music is not that great. Goku goes SSJ3 and everyone is amazed at how strong he is. Majin Buu killing Babidi is just priceless. I think this is by far the best DVD to date until the Cell Games with SSJ2 Gohan comes out. I have watched this over and over again and i still think it is so awsome. So to all of you who like DBZ get this and get it now. You won't be dissapointed.,1022371200,,658,3.992424242424242
1659226,5,B00005T32K,"To make time for Trunks to locate the Dragon Radar, Goku fights Majin Buu.  But first, he shows them all the stages of a Super Saiyan, that confuses Babidi very much.  Super Saiyan, then Super Saiyan 2... Then with an awesome transformation, Goku becomes a Super Saiyan 3 for the very first time in Dragon Ball Z history! This is an epic battle between Goku and Majin Buu, and ends with a surprise... Buu's mutiny against Babidi!",1021161600,2,429,4.558441558441558
1659227,5,B00005T32K,"I saw this tape and it was cool. Goku finally goes Super Saiyan 3, the transformation is awesome, and Goku sounds different after the transformation.  He sounds sort of like a cross between Nail and Goku and talks in a lower tone like Pikkon.  SS3 Goku (as you probably expect) is really strong but Majin Buu can still fight him evenly.  I thought it was funny when Goku kept on moving back and Buu was getting all mad because he couldn't catch him.  Majin Buu also kills Babidi at the end of this video too, because of Babidi's constant barking orders and calling Buu names.  So, I recommend this tape if you have been waiting desperately to see Goku at Super Saiyan level 3, and if you want some comedy, as well.",1017964800,2,714,4.378787878787879
1659228,5,B00005T32K,"This is onbe tape that will surely fly off store shelves eveywhere. I got an advanced copy and it's just as cool as I remember it in Japanese. Gohan continues his training on the World Of The Kais with Supreme Kai and Kibito as he readies himself to face off against Buu. Meanwhile back on Earth the mother of Idosa and Ikasa finally gets revenge against Trunks and Goten for beating her sons in the World Tournament...by telling Babidi where Trunks lives. Bulma's parents are still there and now they are in danger...so Trunks flies off to rescue them. But Goku knows full well Majin Buu will catch up to him...so Goku sets out to keep Buu busy...by having a show down with him. For the first time in the cartoon Goku actually names the levels of Super Saiyan. He shows them level 1 and then powers up to level 2. Then for the first time in Dragon Ball Z Goku, much to the dismay of Buu and Babidi-shows us there is a LEVEL 3! But will all the extra energy Goku is expending have a negative affect on his time left on Earth? All that and Buu tires of Babidi and kills him....now no one is left to control the monster. Yeah and Mr. Satan is in here too lol! This is a great tape with good plot advancement, super saiyan 3 and the meeting between Goku and Buu. Also pick up the last two tapes of the Buu Saga-Hero's Farewell and Emergence(Gotenks baby!) before the Fusion saga starts. KAMEHAMEHA!",1013731200,7,1395,4.3486590038314175

7953387,5,B00005T32K,I Love These VHS Edited Episodes of It. Thanks for Delivering This.,1518912000,,67,4.666666666666667
7953388,5,B00005T32K,"I recommend buying from this seller.
I am glad to see that the 4:3 or original version of DBZ is still sold.
Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,291,4.407407407407407
7953389,4,B00005T32K,"Episodes were cool. Last tape to complete the Uncut Majin Buu VHS Collection. However, Overall I give this 4/5 Stars.",1369440000,,117,4.9
7953390,5,B00005T32K,"While the rest of the Z fighters search for the Dragon Radar and train for the battle, Goku confronts Buu in an attempt to stall for time. He reaches a level that no one believed possible, Super Saiyan 3. Now that Goku has power like that, will he be able to end the monster once and for all? Or will he merely postpone the inevitable?",1355875200,,335,4.1692307692307695
7953391,5,B00005T32K,"Well, Gohan was nearly killed, and Vegeta was killed trying to stop Majinn Buu.  Now, it's Goku's turn in the ring, and with everyone in the world watching, Goku, having powered up to Super Saiyajin 3, battles it out with the fat pink blob.  The fight scene is AWESOME, and beyond words, as the two pummel each other, refusing to yield in battle.  It's not as good as Goku and Majinn Vegeta's fight in ""Rivals,"" and ""The Hatching,"" but it's definitely up there in the top five.  If you're a Goku fan(like me), you owe it to yourself to buy this volume immediately.  If you're a just plain DBZ fan, well, you still owe it to yourself to buy this one!",1067904000,,649,4.330578512396694
7953392,4,B00005T32K,"While Trunks is off searching for the Dragon Radar, Goku yet again ascends to a new level of super saiyan: Super Saiyan 3! With his new power, strength and speed increased, does Goku hold the key to victory or is he planning to stall for time while Trunks look for the Dragon Radar? I gave it 4 stars for when Buu punches Babidi's head off, which was a improvement if I may add.",1056585600,,378,4.191780821917808
7953393,5,B00005T32K,This DVD contains episodes that won't be shown in america until september!  And guess what...GOKU REACHES SIPER SAIYEN 3!!!!  It has three episodes.  I can't wait until the new DBZ season goes on tv this september.,1025308800,,214,4.888888888888889
7953394,5,B00005T32K,"I got hooked on the DBZ story eversince seeing the days of waiting for Goku to wake up and fight frieza!! And We finally get to see what Goku looks like as an SSJ3.  One of the best DVD's with all of the eps. looking pretty good.  If Goku could stay SSJ3 to fight Buu to the death, then Goku would have been able to kill Buu at this point. But you have to watch the eps. to find out what happens.  Definitely got my money's worth in Action for these eps..........A must see for SSJ fans.",1023494400,,487,4.0
