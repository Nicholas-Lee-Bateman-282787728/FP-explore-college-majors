Melissa Gilbert is awesome in her role as a Russian princess and to be honest, although I've always seen her in Little House and other series, I didn't realize it was her until I saw it the second time!  She's great and so are the other actors...not to mention the shots of Russia and Paris....must see!",1176336000,,346,4.40625
1232073,5,B00000JGE5,"""Zoya"" is the exciting story of a young Russian Countess who lives an easy and happy life in St. Petersburg...  That is until the revolution comes about.  To escape, her grandmother and her go to America where Zoya starts to lead an interesting and complex life.  With Ballet, marriage, children, and other once rich Russians this movie is one of the best!  Although I think the book was better...  The book had more interesting detail like Zoya's mother going crazy at the sight of her dead son.  But, I'm getting off the subject!  I totally recomend this movie to anyone who likes Melissa Gilbert, Royal Russia, or just a good old fashion love story!",1018396800,10,652,4.666666666666667
1232074,5,B00000JGE5,I am a big fan of Danielle Steele and without a doubt this is one of the best books that have ever been made into a movie...I am very sorry that it is out of stock to be able to buy it new...Melissa Gilbert does a superb job of playing the part she does and one could really feel her pain and she faced the challenges that came to her in this movie....Both my husband and I enjoyed the movie very much.....,999561600,11,406,3.9634146341463414
1232075,5,B00000JGE5,"Zoya was a ""moving"" experience.  The movie was ""just like the book.""  I'm so glad that the movie did not get shortened, this way we're able to view it and ""remember"" back to when the book was  read. Zoya was a beautiful story and I was glad to be able to relate to the  characters ""just like the book.""  Melissa Gilbert played Zoya  superbly.  I wholeheartedly recommend it.  Thumbs up to Danielle Steel once  again.",937526400,17,416,4.44
