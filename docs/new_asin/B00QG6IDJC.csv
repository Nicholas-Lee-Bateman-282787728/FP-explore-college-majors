6866906,5,B00QG6IDJC,"I love this show. Yes, the changes have been traumatic, but somehow it has survived. The mysteries are all really good, but it is the dynamics between the characters that really makes this show a winner.

The four originals, Dennis Waterman, James Bolam, Alun Armstrong and Amanda Redmond were wonderful, their interaction priceless. As actors have left and been replaced a new dynamic has emerged, one which reaches its fulfillment in the ten episodes that comprise Series 11. Are Tamzin Outhwaite, Denis Lawson and Nicholas Lyndhurst as good as their illustrious predecessors? That's a hard one... They are certainly different (as they should be). It is unfair to criticize them for not being the actor they replaced. Rather one must allow the new blood to settle and gel.

Were it not for Dennis Waterman, it would bear no resemblance to its original format, but given that he is still there, the new version invites comparison. I never liked James Bolum so Denis Lawson was an improvement, in my view. It is virtually impossible to replace the brilliant Alun Armstrong, but Nicholas Lyndhurst really begins to find his footing in these episodes (his disarming of a young punk in one episode is priceless). As for Tamzin Outhwaite? Well, NO ONE is Amanda Redmond except Amanda Redmond, but Ms. Outhwaite, despite some big high heels to fill, manages to make her role memorable and believable, which says an awful lot about her abilities as an actress.

NEW TRICKS 11 has pretty much run its course, with Series 12 projected to be the last, but it's still fun. Taken for what it is, with the new cast for who they are and not for who they are not, there is plenty here to enjoy.",1428969600,,1680,4.766323024054983

6866908,5,B00QG6IDJC,"As strong a cop/humor show as ever. Since 2003, this fast-pace old-guy investigation team includes the last remaining original cast member (Dennis Waterman) Gerry Standing, who, unknown to many, is the singing voice behind the series theme song. UCOS gets handed unsolvable cases, but new evidence suggests this Unsolved Crimes & Open Case team can get the job done right. Not without few mess-ups along the way, plus plenty of humor mingled with suspense. The episodes are now filled with many guest stars; only a few of my favorite are noted in the episode synopsis below. Although many original regulars have been replaced, the content remains as sharp as ever, and the replacements have proved their merit, advancing the series. Crime is suspenseful, old-guy investigators funny.
CONTINUES as one of my all-time TOP-10 series.

DCI Sasha (Tamzin Outhwaite) is now UCOS head; and don't tell the cast change nay-sayers, but I like her better. She and Danny (Nicholas Lyndhurst) were introduced to the team last season and Steve (Denis Lawson) 2 season past. DAC Strickland (Anthony Calf) has been with News Tricks since the 2nd season and is in half of these episodes.

SDH SUBTITLES FOR ALL EPISODES plus bonus
&nbsp;Bermondsey Boy
Gerry asked for help by Ralph Paxon (David Hayman -`The Paradise'), a friend whose grandson's death could have been murder. Amy Nuttall (`Downton Abbey') is engaged daughter Caitlin Standing in this and the 10th episode. DAC Ned Handcock (Barnaby Kay) gets involved much to the dismay of his ex UCOS head Sacha. He also appears in episodes 3 & 5.
&nbsp;Tender Loving Care
2010 young doctor's murder leads: Married Dr Laurence Devlin (Richard Dilland -`Casuality'), the victim's mother (Sian Thomas -`Vanity Fair'), & her husband Hugh (Oliver Cotton). Dan faces loss of daughter's presence. Steve's hooked gaming.
&nbsp;Deep Swimming
80s anti-nuke activist blown up may be murder, not an accident. What does the 2 opponents of the victim know? Mary Griffith (Kika Markham -`Mr Selfridge'), & lecturer Frances Kane (Clare Higgins). DAC Ned wants to rekindle the snuffed love-flame with DCI Sasha. Dan looks to downsize housing.
&nbsp;Ghosts
Nancy (Ann Firbank), 80 with dementia, reports a 60-yr-old murder. Steve's son nicked for weed resulting in an encounter with ex-wife Tricia (Julie Graham -`Bletchley Circle') and will again in episode 8.
&nbsp;London Underground
A sewer corpse connects to a 20 year unsolved case. Old case victim's, Ruth Shireen (Sophie Thompson `Emma') suggests an occult tie. Frasers played by Nicola Stephenson and Benjamin Whitrow.
&nbsp;Romans Ruined
Re-enactors, a Roman sword, & a 2008 headless corpse may or may not be connected (excuse the pun.) Imperium member Julia Kane (Liz White -`Life on Mars') is one member and Danny joins undercover. A busy time for Danny, will his institutionalized wife be released just as he finds a new significant other?
&nbsp;In Vino Veritas
A 2010 fire killed pub owner Richard Gibson (Philip Davis `'Bleak House' `Poldark'). Is the pub's pianist Jason (Tom Georgeson -`Bleak House' `G.B.H.') or brother Richard (Philip Davis -`Poldark' `Bleak House') arsonists? Missing barmaid is nicked. How will UCOS due in an athletic event Sasha enters them into?
&nbsp;The English Defense
A brick tossed at a moving auto has a DNA match to a chess player murder. See guest Nicholas Woodeson (`The Hound of Baskerville'). Steve puts his dad in a London hospice.
&nbsp;Breadcrumbs
Danny's amateur sleuthing group pal is dead; which leads to a 25-yr-old country killing. There you'll meet Caroline Tate (Emma Fielding -`Cranford'.) Gerry & Steve flat mates??
&nbsp;The Queen's Speech
3-yr-old time capsule reopens a teen death with little help from the teen's father William (Jack Shepherd.) Gerry attends a stag party. Sasha's romantic side flickers.

The New Tricks seasons continue. May they never end.

6866909,5,B00QG6IDJC,"I see that there are three reviews posted already about this Season 11 though it will not make it's Region 1 (US) debut until the end of April. I'm not sure what format those reviews are discussing. (I don't think it's steaming in the US yet). Anyway, as a journalist, I was provided with an advance copy and spent the last week enjoying the exploits of the ""new"" team. It was time well spent.

I'll make the assumption that anyone finding this review is familiar with the series and has watched most - if not all - of the previous 10 seasons.  (If not, do not pass ""go"" return to Season One and start there. Your journey will be more enjoyable.). Therefore you know that Dennis Waterman is the only original cast member still here. I - like others - were sorry to see the other two male actors depart but this season gives us a chance to better relate to the new folks.

Another reviewer misses Amanda Redman  - and so do I - but her replacement  -Tamzin Outhwaite - is really not that different. In fact, without giving much away, she has the same social life issues as Redman's character did. And the new brainy character Danny (Nicholas Lyndhurst) is a multilayered character as well.
Honestly, the weakest part s of the series (even before the original cast left) were the unsolved crimes. There are only so many ways to commit a murder and scriptwriters are constantly bringing in weird scenarios. (This time there's a cult that recreates Roman battles). And then there's the fake winery. But through all this the core cast of four keeps us both entertained as well as showing us the serious side of their personal lives. So, I see this season as the same as the previous ones , only ""different"" and I'm glad they continued it.

If you've read my other reviews on Amazon you know that I hate ""spoilers"" but here is a  small one which I hope will not deter you from this set.  Series 12 is being film now - so it won't make DVD till at least the end of the year. But the BBC announced that 12 will be the last season. According to most articles I've read, it is not because Dennis Waterman wants out but that every story has an ending (though Don't tell that to CSI which continues to breed new offspring!). And the writers and directors have 10 episodes to wind up the story.

The DVD (there is no BD) has one bonus feature. It's a new 22-minute featurette which contains interviews with each of 4 members of the team  plus their boss. Yes, they do spend a bit too much time showing clips from the episodes you've just seen but each actor really seems to know the ""back story"" to their character. It's not essential, but a nice touch. IMPORTANT ALERT: Do not watch the featurette until after you've seen the episodes. There are lots of ""spoilers"" there.

So, yes, this is not a perfect show but if, like me, you've come this far, hang in for another two seasons. It's probably worth 4.5 stars but I'll round to a full five. I like these guys!

I am addingthis additional info on March 14, 2015: The DVD includes the ORIGINAL UK episodes which each run 61 minutes. The shows aired on US TV were edited - I'm assuming for language. There is some graphic violence and no nudity but the S-word shows up about once in every episode.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6866910,5,B00QG6IDJC,"I love the new cast and encourage everyone to give it a chance. I know that change is hard, but the show is still well written and well acted. I loved the former cast, but found the ""old guy/sexy, but hard boss"" wearing thin especially as Amanda Redman was getting a little too old to rely on the sexy card. I found that the new cast forms a cohesive unit and there seems to be room to develop that relationship. I hope the series continues.",1425686400,15,441,4.2
6866911,5,B00QG6IDJC,"Well ok it isn' the old new tricks.  Personally I could learn to like the team except for the woman who took over the team.  Can't handle her BUT in saying that I will continue to give her a chance.  Reason:  Because this show, even with the changes along with reruns of Poirot, Frost, Morse, Lewis and a few others  STILL beats any of this crap realty show stuff we have darned near every hour of every day  So we rely heavily on these DVD's along with streaming with Roku.  Thank heaven for the British mysteries and comedies along with some others like (our) Columbo and a few other old shows.  No, this new ensemble is not the same, but we are trying to look at it as a ""new show"" (which it really is when you think about it) and not compare it to the previous years. They were great ones but they are gone. Thank heaven for DVD and streaming.  I'll give these folks a chance.",1425513600,49,880,4.190476190476191
6866912,2,B00QG6IDJC,"This was my favorite UK crime show. For many years it starred Actors: Amanda Redman, Dennis Waterman, Alun Armstrong,and James Bolam. Alun Armstrong was also given a splendid wife who had to endure his OCD plus bipolar personality. It made him the best cop but a really problematic person. The first five seasons of this show count as the UK's absolute finest about the old duffers in London policing solving all of these great cases. As the years went on, they all left except for Dennis Waterman. They were all replaced by actors who were ok but could not bring that great comedic ensemble timing to the show. It was while watching this season of the show that I finally gave up on it. My recommendation is not to watch this season until you have watched all earlier seasons of it. Truthfully you can stop watching the minute Alan Armstrung and his wife air their last episode in the earlier season.",1423440000,74,901,4.60248447204969

6867023,5,B00QG6IDJC,"I AM AMAZED. Me, Blimey Limey who hates change. Had a terrible time accepting the new Midsomer Murders and have just about come around. I loved the old New Tricks and when I saw the almost new cast I thought - yech. I LOVE IT. Just as much as the old one. All of them are just wonderful and beautifully right for their roles. Of course it was great to see Dennis Waterman again - they fit in so well and Danny - my kind of intellect as I was trained in body language among other  things. I bought it a while ago when my beloved John went into at home hospice. He died just over three weeks ago. As he didn't have an opportunity to see it, I started watching them this evening. I spoke to his chair and photographs with my usual comments and we really enjoyed it. It's a great series and sometimes it is very challenging to continue an excellent presentation with new people. Well done whoever did the casting here. With regard to Danny, Nicholas Lyndhurst, I seem to remember him as the creepiest Uriah Heep I ever saw. He freaked me out and I literally wanted to punch him, he was that good. I am not  familiar with Tamzin (what a smashing name) Outhwaite, nor Steve McAndrew but I am a big fan already. So, although I'd like to write more, and catch up with perhaps some old sharing friends on this page, I have to go back to watch another one. Wish there were more stars. for me, personally this came at the right time. Would like more Lewis to return but I doubt that will happen. Anyone tell me what else is new? I've been on care-sharing 24/7 so haven't been able to keep  up. Now I want to see some quality television and am an English mystery aficionado so any suggestions would be appreciated.

The ""new girl"" doesn't have the same edge, but she's getting the job done. The show seems to be showing less of its stars now, putting more time into the back story of the latest unsolved crime, which I think is pretty lazy, considering how few episodes we get each season. I'd like to see more of the Scottish guy; he's dreamy. It's still a good show, but not as good as before. I'll keep getting the new seasons, though.

But DO start at Season 1 and work your way up because those early seasons really establish the character of the UCOS team and are immensely fun!! Watch Seasons 1-10 so you don't miss DCI Sandra Pullman as played by the fabulous Amanda Redman who is the ""guv'na"" and foil for these wonderful men. By this 11th season there has a been a total shift-over to a new boss & crew except for amiable retired copper / maturing lady's man Gerry Standing (by Dennis Waterman) and the handsome, enigmatic big boss DAC Robert Strickland (by Anthony Calf) who oversees this successful Unsolved Crimes and Open Cases (UCOS) Squad .  Nuanced, fun performances this season by laid-back Scotsman Steve McAndrew (Denis Lawson) and intense polymath Danny Griffin (Nicholas Lyndhurst) who are new to the team. Ms. Tamzin Outhwaite as the new DCI -- Sasha Miller is different than her predecessor and equally well played. Not usually very violent, gory or sexually explicit - but this show has a bit of grown-up language and complex emotional content so this can be a fun series for the whole family if you have teens / tweens and up if you want them to see some fine adult drama/comedy and have the maturity level.

UCOS are a team now, and it's a treat to watch them brainstorm together. Of course, there are still the quirks and the ""problems."" The ""difficult"" ex, Gerry's East End redneck attitude, all that.

6867071,5,B00QG6IDJC,"I have been a fan of 'New Tricks' since I stumbled across it on PBS late one Sunday night while channel surfing a decade ago.
The more that I watched it, the more I began to think that Amanda Redman, James Bolam, Alun Armstrong and Dennis Waterman comprised an almost-perfect ensemble cast: Each member brought unique strengths to this quirky show about retired detectives working on cold cases under Redman's command.
When the cast began to change - first with Bolam's exit, followed by Armstrong's and Redman's departures - I began worrying that this excellent police series that successfully blends drama with humor was going to fall apart.
It didn't, at least in my opinion, primarily because the writers and producers were savvy enough not to try to recreate the same atmosphere that existed when the original cast was together. Nicholas Lyndhurst, for example, is the nominal replacement for Alun Armstrong's brilliant portrayal of the paranoid, former alcoholic Brian Lane, an exceptionally bright detective whose personal demons kept him almost constantly on the edge. By contrast, Lyndhurst's portrayal of Danny Griffin is understated. He is not prone to the sudden outbursts that Lane was although he is equally intelligent. Unlike Lane, he is a former member of the Met's Diplomatic Protection Service and can handle himself in a physical confrontation, as he shows on more than one occasion.
Tamzin Outhwaite, meanwhile, has taken over the team in Redman's place. Like Redman's character, Sandra Pullman, Outhwaite's Sasha Miller is strong minded and a crack detective in her own right. Unlike Pullman, however, Miller tends to be more at ease with her staff. She jokes more with them, for example, and is more inclined to allow her ""boys"" to follow their instincts rather than relying on strict procedure. She is also more physical than Pullman; she plays soccer, rows, runs for exercise and - like Griffin - can throw a punch (and take one) when necessity calls for that.
Sadly, this is the penultimate season for 'New Tricks.' I thought the new cast delivered a high-quality Season 11 and the cases that the team investigated were just as interesting as in previous years. Ratings fell during the season, however, so, apparently, the British viewing public didn't agree.
That said, I highly recommend this season for viewers who enjoy a good police procedural that mixes in just the right amount of humor with some very intriguing cases and an excellent cast.",1430956800,5,2474,5.0661764705882355

Honestly, I love New Tricks and you really do have to start at the beginning of the series because the characters are the ones who draw you into their mysteries.

As for scheduled programming, your only option for good Brit detectives is PBS and you can't depend on that so you'll have to get your own copies.",1430438400,,569,4.4423076923076925

6867082,5,B00QG6IDJC,"NEW TRICKS, Season 11, 2014.  As this eternally popular British television series returns, the old dogs, called out of retirement to solve cold cases  and learn new tricksat the London Metropolitan Police Forces Unsolved Crime and Open Case Squad (UCOS) find themselves a new boss.  Beautiful, sexy, younger DCI Sasha Miller (Tamzin Outhwaite, EASTENDERS).  Who keeps a watchful eye, in this cop shop, on her veteran detectives: the womanizing Gerry Standing (Dennis Waterman, THE SWEENEY), the Scottish Steve McAndrew (Denis Lawson, BLEAK HOUSE), and the brainiac Danny Griffin (Nicholas Lyndhurst, ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES).  The British mystery show's cast has changed over the years; yet they still solve daunting cases with their well-honed sleuthing skills and humor.  The production, which was seen on the BBC, has been syndicated to public television stations in the United States.  I received this as a review copy. The box set of three DVDs of approximately 610 minutes of entertainment.  It has subtitles, thank goodness, whod want to miss that quick cross-cutting London cop chat.  As extra, it offers a New Tricks: New Team featurette of 22 minutes.  Mind you, the credits warn that the series is  mature only: it contains coarse language and sexual situations.

This long-running, award-winning British series has been called an ""unstoppable ratings monster"" (London Sunday Telegraph). It is a drama with tongue firmly in cheek, deftly written and perfectly cast, a ""gale-force blast of fresh air"" according to Radio Times, U.K. The production, filmed in HD in London, gives us that great city in all its 2014 contemporary glory, with the Millennium Bridge, the London Eye. In Season 11, the team tackles crimes involving antinuclear protesters, ancient battle reenactors, an amateur sleuth, illegal immigrants, state secrets from the Cold War era. Excellent guest stars include the winning, always busy Julie Graham (THE BLETCHLEY CIRCLE); David Hayman (THE PARADISE); Amy Nuttall (DOWNTON ABBEY); Liz White (LIFE ON MARS), the veteran Phil Davis (WHITECHAPEL), the poor mans Michael Caine, most everyones choice for cockney actor every time.  The episodes are, with thanks to RLJ/Acorn:

Part of the tape includes words from a speech written for the queen during the Cold War, a speech which is still Top Secret. Gerry attends his future son-in-law's stag party; Sasha finds her first romance since her divorce from Ned.

In this affable high-quality police drama, called one of the UKs best loved, the question is: can this curmudgeonly trio of crime-busters learn new tricks to crack tough crimes, or are the old waysguile and hunchesstill best?  The plots are fresh, original, twisty, generally ingeniously solved.  Often funny, often resonant, shrewdly written with an eye and an ear on the days news and the contemporary Zeitgeist.  Many are powerful, evocative, riveting. I particularly loved Episode 5, London Underground, as I have long been fascinated by the great world-class citys historically-abused Fleet River. Found Episode 10, the Queens Speech rather overwrought, particularly for a British show.  I will readily admit a weakness for female headed cop shows, but I really loved this one.  And Ive never been more than half aware of it, never knew what I was missing.  Just think 10 series to catch up with.  What a wonderful fate!",1429401600,,6657,5.113573407202216

Gerry is the glue that binds the old team with the new team. This season doesn't disappoint either. We learn more about the new teams lives and they more or less get along at work. The old guys look after their new boss and vice-versa, just like they were a family. The writing (plots) is generally good as is the music, about the only strange thing is that Nick has an uncanny ability to learn anything overnight and be really good at it (i.e., sort of like a Pretender). Again, the new cast is different from the old cast and I have no idea what the chemistry was like between the actors but Gerry bridges the two different teams.
