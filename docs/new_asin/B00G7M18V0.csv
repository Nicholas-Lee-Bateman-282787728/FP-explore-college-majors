6062293,5,B00G7M18V0,"""Ripper Street"" is a gritty, fascinating police procedural set in the London of 1889 and 1890, immediately after the horrors of the Jack the Ripper murders.  Inspector Reid (Matthew McFaydyen) is the new boss of the Whitechapel Police Station in East London; the shadow of the Ripper, who was never caught, will fall on his cases and on his relations with the community and with his superiors.  Along with his tough deputy Detective Sergeant Drake (Jerome Flynn) and his American coroner Homer Jackson (Adam Rothenberg), Reid will attempt to enforce the law on some very mean streets indeed.

The show does a very decent job of replicating the East London of its time, with its poverty, rough rules, and rising social causes.  The forensics shown in the show are inevitably informed by modern practice, both real and fictional, but they help move the stories along in interesting ways.  The social causes built into the storylines are real enough, even if the perspective of narration is sometimes suspiciously modern.  Behind the drama of the crime of each episode are a number of backstories that play out, including the mysterious past and sometimes perilous present of Homer Jackson, the mystery of the missing and presumed dead daughter of Inspector Reid, and the ghost of the Ripper, whose crimes never seem very far away. Season One and Two are highly recommended as a gripping police procedural with a unique point of view.",1429574400,,1431,4.96652719665272
6062294,5,B00G7M18V0,"RIPPER STREET is a unique and exciting Victorian era police series ~ we were captured and held happily captive for each episode of the first two seasons of the show.  Remarkable sets and lighting enchance the experience. The acting by the principals as well as the guest actors is consistently of a high calibre, and the writing ~ oh, the writing! ~ is by turns exciting and frightening, painful and bittersweet, and always involving. We gladly returned to Whitechapel, to the poverty and crime, to the still-fresh memory of Jack the Ripper, to noisy music halls and bawdy women, and bloody fisticuffs in a dank back alley and the smells you imagine permeating everything. This is remarkable, memorable storytelling. So hike up your ruffles lest they get soiled on the cobblestones, walk carefully among the puddles and rubbish and join the hunt ~",1424563200,,847,4.923076923076923
6062295,5,B00G7M18V0,"I have to register first a couple of historical inaccuracies which will probably be irrelevant to most viewers. Firstly, Inspector Abberline was in his mid-forties at this time, so the actor appears a little old for the role. The real Abberline seems to have been a little more amiable and less obsessed than the character we see here. Secondly, the depiction of George Lusk and his Vigilance Committee is unfair. Lusk was a thoroughly respectable and responsible citizen, and the committee were not a collection of rowdies. His nominal successor, Albert Bachert,was working class and an agitator on behalf of the poor but there is no evidence that he was a rabble-rouser (See Jack the Ripper with Michael Caine, which conflates Lusk with Bachert and makes him an irresponsible demagogue).
What makes this worth five stars? Firstly the acting,which is excellent throughout. Secondly, the depiction of Whitechapel, which actually looks like a place where people live and work rather than the kind of dark fogbound wonderland we've seen too often in films on the subject. Thirdly, the characters. As in the series Rome, we are presented with unidealised characters with whom we can empathise, despite the fact that they are capable of some pretty dark deeds. In some ways Matthew McFadyen's Inspector Reid seems a little too modern in sensibility, but this is balanced by his willingness to use his sergeant to carry out actions for which he does not have the stomach, such as beating information out of prisoners. Similarly, the range of Jackson's analytical skills sometimes seems a little contrived, but the man himself is deeply flawed but fascinating. Probably the most sympathetic character is Sergeant Drake, a man whose chief skill is the ability to deal out violence, but who clearly wants to find a side of himself that is gentle and loving. His attempts to do so, and the pain and anguish they bring him, form the emotional core of several episodes. I haven't said anything about the actual writing. Some may find the show's tendency to have its characters express their personal philosophy with such frequency a little wearing, and I think one could argue that many of the long speeches they give owe more to Victorian fiction and melodrama than Victorian reality. But then this is fiction, though based on fact, and effective fiction at that.
One caveat: these programmes are full of murder and brutality, fairly explicitly depicted. This may accurately reflect the time and place, but  won't be to everyone's taste. If you can handle it, you'll experience some top-class drama.",1420502400,,2589,5.034965034965035

My thoughts Season one

The narrative is set in the late 19th century and the story begins with the tail-end of Jack the Ripper's terrifying reign of murder in the East End of London, however, the drama went on to examine multifaceted human motivations, to dissect the central characters and their lives beyond the police station. There is examination of what it means to be malevolent and/or human. The drama looked at the lives, and social ills of the people who lived in the area, and this was done through making the look and feel of the era in a really striking framework. For me the direction, writing and performance given, came together to make really interesting and finely tuned drama.

My thoughts season two

Set in 1890 - Season two of this series just gets better as the following episodes improved each time, due to the development of the three main characters and their backstories. While the history shown is reflective of the period, there are exceptions for dramatic effect. The historical backdrops to episodes in series 2 include Chinese immigration, the London matchgirls strike of 1888, electrical War of Currents, the Cleveland Street scandal, Joseph Merrick, known as the Elephant Man and the Baring crisis. Season really builds on the excellent foundations of season one,the texture and flavor of London's East End are brought to vivid life. All in all makes Ripper Street a compelling procedural - with great eye to detail from the evolving streets of London and the advent of technology at the time.

All highly recommended.
