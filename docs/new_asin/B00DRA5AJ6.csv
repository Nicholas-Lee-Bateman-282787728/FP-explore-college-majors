8596583,4,B00DRA5AJ6,"I have a feeling that this set was put together rather quickly for the holidays. The labelling mishaps are rather unfortunate (disc one does not contain #5), but they don't take away from the fact that this is a great set for a great price. This is the perfect set for any hockey fan who doesn't own any of the 25 individual DVDs.",1386979200,3,330,4.253968253968254
8596584,1,B00DRA5AJ6,"Has none of the original music....including Don Cherry's famous rap during Rock Em Sock Em 5.....not to mention they use the exact same music for almost every single Volume....

The packaging is overall a downright mess.....never making it clear which volumes are actually on what disc (ie disc 1 says volumes 1-5 on it, and it says that on the packaging, when in reality it contains 1-4)

Overall, if you are looking for Rock Em Sock Em has they were originally produced....this product is NOT what you are looking for.",1386547200,9,520,4.766666666666667
