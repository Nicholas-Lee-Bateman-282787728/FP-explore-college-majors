274681,5,6300248135,"I do not usually like horror films, but this one is so absorbing and well done that I find myself returning to it at least once every six months.  It is, of course, a remake of the 1958 ""The Fly"", which itself has  stood up very well.  This 1986 remake, however, is a much more  sophisticated and better written undertaking all the way around.  Advancement in film technology and special effects have been formidable  since 1958, and this film provides spectacular proof of it.  The plot, as  before, deals with a young scientist who experiments with genetic  transformation ---- with grotesque and ghastly results.  To watch Jeff  Goldblum metamorphisize into a fly during the course of this film is  fascinating, sometimes repugnant, and always convicing.  Goldblum does a  terrific job as the ill-fated scientist, and his transformation, while  sometimes difficult and unsettling to watch, is nevertheless wonderfully  human.  Geena Davis is no less impressive.  As his helper, love interest,  and ultimately, his source of merciful deliverance, she brings great  strength and poignancy to a role which could have gone for nothing.  This  is decidedly not a film for the squeamish ---- some of the footage,  especially near the end of the film, are pretty graphic and frightening,  but if you can countenance this, you will certainly find yourself moved by  a film which could scarcely have been improved upon.",944265600,,1413,5.065502183406114
274682,5,6300248135,"The 1958 remake of The Fly was excellent. This was a movie, not for a first date, but not a bad idea either. It told the story of Seth Brundle, a brilliant scientist who invented a genetic transportation device. One day  while he was experimenting, a common housefly got in the machine and our  story begins. He falls in love with a writer. When he starts to transform  into the fly, the story shows how deep the writer's love was for The Fly. A  little gruesome I admit but an overall winner.",943315200,,493,4.326086956521739
274683,3,6300248135,"David Cronenberg's 8th movie THE FLY, a remake of the 50's sci-fi classic, was his greatest box office achievement. The original script, penned by no other Mel Brooks, had passed Cronenberg's eyes along with Top Gun, Beverly  Hills Cop, and Total Recall. Cronenberg decided to take on THE FLY. The  transformation of Brundell Fly in the movie is not only grotesque, but  extremely believable. And this what Cronenberg does best. He gets you to  suspend your disbelief. THE FLY, falling middle ground as far as Cronenberg  goes is a little more mainstream than his other attemots. This movie,  however will be enjoyed by all horror and sci-fi types, not exclusive to  Cronenberg fans.",911260800,3,683,4.991150442477876

274737,5,6300248135,"In my opinion, this is David Cronenberg's best film because it is about a blend of a deeply emotional human tragedy and romance. A brilliant scientist, played perfectly by the inimitable Jeff Goldblum, creates a teleportation machine, which goes horrifically awry when he uses himself as a guinea pig. Great makeup, great acting and a terrific, tight script. Many of Cronenberg's films are antiseptic, nihilistic and cold in my opinion. But The Fly is packed full with humanity and the tragedy of this gifted scientist, his romance with a journalist, also perfectly played by Geena Davis (wonderful chemistry too), and the shocking results of a science experiment that unintentionally destroys the creator. Cronenberg's commentary is very insightful.",1508889600,,750,5.418803418803419

274740,5,6300248135,"True horror. On an emotional level. Yes, the movie has a gross out horror aspect that ramps up continually as is progresses. But where this movie truly affects me is the emotional horror. Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis are both so terrific (in very different ways) and have such amazing chemistry (they fell in love as they shot the movie) that as the final 30 minutes or so plays out, the movie becomes a Shakespearean tragedy on a deep emotional level. It's no wonder Howard Shore, who wrote the fabulous score, later tried this as an opera! One of the most devastating movies I've ever seen, and continues to be so. And that's a compliment. When a movie can effect you this deeply and viscerally, it's doing something right.",1507334400,,726,4.635658914728682

274742,5,6300248135,"What am I working on?

The Fly is a movie you don't forget anytime soon. It's a classic and it's a horror update done correctly. Directed by David Cronenberg, this could be his best movie.

This is the disturbing story of Seth Brundle, played with great expertise by Jeff Goldblum. Brundle is a brilliant scientist experimenting with the ability to transport matter through time and space. Like all great scientists, he is obsessed.
In a crazy accident Seth becomes fused with a fly & becomes Brundlefly. The transformation is gruesome, thought provoking, and disturbing. The Fly is thoughtful science fiction horror that question science, experimentation, and the unknown.",1502236800,,673,5.222222222222222

274795,5,6300248135,"I realized long ago no matter how old I got, my mind stayed 14-18 (48 now). So my boyish mind can never truly evolve past the sci-fi and horror genres. Boy am I thankful for that... I could never figure out which I loved best between those 2 genres and once I realized I could have both p-nut butter and chocolate simultaneously in a wonderful sub-genre known as sci-fi/horror!! The downside being that many times those two genres are not a perfect marriage. Thanks to a few of my heros John Carpenter, Ridley Scott, David Cronenberg I really could have it all in one film. It is the aforementioned Cronenberg who has brought us an updated version of The Fly and in my opinion, it blows the original out of the water. Jeff Goldblume is incredible as the fly and I cannot imagine it played better by any actor past or present. If this genre appeals to you, just a few of the must see movies are:

The Thing ('82)
Alien (NOT Aliens)
Predator
Invasion of the Body Snatchers

Along with The Fly, that makes up 5 movies that may very well hook you on Sci-Fi/Horror genre. Rest assured those 5 are hard to beat, but fear not there is much much more to discover beyond them.",1494201600,5,1167,4.373271889400922

274798,5,6300248135,"David Cronenberg's masterful 1986 retelling of Director Kurt Neumann's 1958 science fiction classic, ""The Fly,"" has to be the single-most powerful and emotionally draining film of its kind. It has, however, quite often received a surprising level of lukewarm praise, with some critics choosing to refer to it as simply ""good"" or ""better than average for a horror film."" And that, friends, is just plain and simply not true.

""The Fly,"" was one of the all-time greatest genre films to come out of 1986, aside from the obvious grand-daddy of classics which was...of course...the incomparable James Cameron action extravaganza, ""Aliens."" Thinking about it now, I'd actually take my long-standing praise for this film a step further and just call it one of the best ever made...period! You would be hard-pressed to dispute that because, when you get right down to it, there have been very few other films within this genre over the pursuant years that have been able to capture the sheer emotional impact of this one.

Jeff Goldblum, as far as I'm concerned, turned in the performance of his career with this film. He stars as Seth Brundle, a brilliant, lonely scientist on the verge of a discovery that will, in his very own words, ""change the world as we know it."" Geena Davis, in an equally excellent role, shines as a skeptical reporter who quickly falls head-over-heels for Brundle after he convinces her to check out his latest creative endeavor, a unique pair of contraptions he refers to as ""tele-pods"" that will essentially allow him to beam solid objects from one point of space to another. This, then, is precisely where David Cronenberg begins to wield his cinematic expertise. What begins as a love story, more involving and moving than you'd ever expect, quickly turns to tragedy when Brundle....in a drunken state of poor judgment....decides to test his invention on himself. Over a not too short span of time, through circumstances I won't spoil, he begins to lose all traces of his humanity and eventually comes to realize that he is changing form; in this bizarre case, into an entirely new breed of fly!

What really works about Cronenberg's approach are the impeccable actors, a series of gruesome and all-too convincing special effects, and an exceptionally well-layered script by Charles Edward Pogue that fleshes out the story in just the right manner. The screenplay wisely centers around the humanity of the whole thing and never loses sight of the focus, not once. Pogue zeroes the narrative around two people in love and the tragedy that befalls them. For while Brundle does eventually turn into a giant insect by the film's closing moments, it's all really just a metaphor for disease. It was made in the mid 1980's, after all, when the AIDS virus was still new and frighteningly mysterious. Cronenberg's gut-wrenching film, at its core, tells the story of a man being consumed by a terrible disease for which...like AIDS, at the time...there was no cure. And, the ending? Be ready, dearest friends, because it will hit you hard.

""The Fly"" stands, today, as an absolutely flawless film and a real treat for film buffs, horror fans, or those who really just want to watch a good movie. It's also probably one of the goriest motion pictures you're ever going to sit through. But, if you're willing to go along for the ride it offers, I don't think you will find much to dislike and I sincerely doubt you'll ever forget it.",1491609600,,3445,4.883760683760684

274907,5,6300248135,"I loved it and I thought they all did a great job on the movie. The effects were pretty good and still are. Being made in 1986, effects and CGI were still pretty new and in their infancy. To make this movie more realistic, they had to take a more ""gory"" style approach. I think they achieved that here. If you are squeamish, you may not like this version of The Fly. After Jeff's character risks a transit on himself between the pods, he finds he is changing in ways he thought not possible. He does some research on the transit and finds that an insect Fly got into one of the pods and basically blended with his DNA. The Fly's DNA is absorbed into Jeff's body upon transit and, in time, he begins the ugly transformation from Human to FLY, in large format I might add to the disgust of his girlfriend played by Geena Davis.

274908,4,6300248135,"The original film was the classic, this was just a remake.  The story is basically the same.  A self-absorbed scientist (Jeff Goldblum) cant resist flirting with and trying to impress a journalist (Geena Davis as Veronica).  He brags, he cajoles, come up to my lab, have I got something to show you.  Look, I can transport one of your stockings from here to there.  Really?  Wow.  Whereupon he suddenly turns coy, you cant report any of this!  Hubris leads him to make a horrible mistake.  He sulks, gets drunk, and decides to transport himself pod to pod.  Instead of taking precautions, checking his equipment, keeping his lab free of flies, the idiot makes the ultimate mistake and pays dearly for it.  But others pay far more for his arrogance.

Goldblum was the best obvious choice to play Seth Brundle.  Wild eyed, intense, his halting speech that rushes and slows for no apparent reason.  He was weird before he began to change.  Geena Davis had the thankless task of keeping the film grounded.  I respond more to her characters pain and horror than to Brundles belated regret and subsequent descent into madness.  He brought this on himself; she was just an innocent bystander.",1479340800,,1185,4.787128712871287

274946,3,6300248135,"It's hard to rate a movie like this.  In some way it's a grotesque, sleazy, disgusting, rated X parody of the original 1950s movie.  Sure, Goldblum's performace is very good -for what the role he is asked to play- and the horror elements are much more visceral and graphic and hard-core and 'realistic' than the '50s version.  The '86 version seems significantly more realistic and scientifically-thought out and plausible as well.

Ebert once said that ""every decade deserves its movies"" or something to that effect: For the better and worse this is atypical 1980s over-the-top gore and sleaze and thus to an extent -stupidity and desensitization as well.  The '80s produced a lot of good movies but an equally amount of stupid movies...and it sure was a lot dumber of a decade than any that preceded it (this country has only gotten dumber since)...

Given the combination of these factors -and the departure from the 'innocence' of the 1950s version- I give the 1986 ""The Fly"" 3 out of 5 stars...",1477267200,,999,4.812865497076023

275118,5,6300248135,"I really enjoyed this movie. There are so many rich levels of metaphor going on delving into themes of both disease and violation of both body and mind by foreign (not self) entities that literally tear the main character apart. It is great watching for just gross out horror fun, but the emotional depth of the piece adds a great deal more depth than the standard horror movie even begins to approach. It is a classic example of David Cronenberg's work and the intellectual and emotional awareness that exists pulsing under the surface of many of his works of art. Spider, A History of Violence, Dead Ringers, Existenz, The Dead Zone, and Naked Lunch are just a of his films that come to mind when it comes to truly astounding levels of depth. The Fly is much more accessible than these other films aside from perhaps The Dead Zone and works as a straight horror movie as well so is good for both silly squealing ""that is just nasty"" party nights as well as long discussions of interpretations of the metaphors under the surface of the story. There is a tragic, helpless element to the film that can be truly emotionally moving if the time is taken to look past the plentiful gore.",1463529600,,1182,4.553990610328638

275189,5,6300248135,"For all things considered in this Collector's Edition of THE FLY this is without a doubt a must for horror movie fans, for people who grew up in the 80's as movie fans in general, and for anyone who enjoys seeing the ""making of documentaries"" about the ""remaking of a movie"" with cast and Director interviews (David Cronenberg also made ""Scanners"", ""The Dead Zone"", ""Videodrome"" - early James Woods, ""Naked Lunch"").  Plenty of nice tidbits.
As it turns out Cronenberg was not original choice for THE FLY (1986) and there is a sad story behind original Director's exit.
And I had forgotten (at the time) the logical coup of casting actual acting couple Jeff Goldblum (first) and then, well, get his girlfriend, Geena Davis, her first really good role.  THE FLY is the movie that put her on the road to fame and stardom.
As for Jeff Goldblum - and I have argued this point before (with people who care too much about such trivialities) - he deserved an Academy Award nomination every bit as much as Anthony Hopkins would get (and win?) for ""Silence of the Lambs"" in that horror movie thriller 5 years later.  Goldblum's performance - and through ALL that eventual makeup - really was impressive (think how the screen ""demanded"" his convincing performance).  It is difficult to imagine Any other actor could have been Seth Brundle like it should have been done, in this truly great remake of a classic(but flawed) 1958 horror movie.  This really is an admirable modern treatment of a weird idea given a more realistic Scientific foundation.
This re-make, re-thinking of The Fly gives us a more Scientific ""plausibility"" rather than a perfect ""fly head"" appearing on human body like in the Vincent Price, Al Hedison, Patricia Owen version.  And don't get me wrong!  I like the original version.  A very fun, colorful, easy to watch 50's horror classic.

Also, if you remember the ""Exorcist"" (of course you do?) and the eventually famous 'deleted' ""Spider Walk"" scene that was shown years after initial release, THE FLY has the ""Monkey-Cat"" splicing-fusion scene that is laughably horrific and was left out of movie because a preview audience (basically) vehemently disapproved.  Brundle-Fly lost some ""sympathy"" votes in the brutal process.
As it is this COLLECTOR'S EDITION of THE FLY 1986 is Easily worth 10 bucks.  Gore, love story, and all.",1459382400,,2340,4.89873417721519

275247,4,6300248135,"While Videodrome is probably Cronenberg's  most characteristic film, The Fly is probably his best film. It reaches forward to the emotional dramas of the 2000s, and captures his earlier meditations on the mind-body problem, corporate control of public life, and the possibility of human transcendence through technology, or more accurately, through human thought. The Fly has an emotional resonance Cronenberg had not managed up to that point (The Brood, for instance, is oddly cold, considering its subject-matter), and is much more successful in this regard than Naked Lunch, or even A History of Violence. In the 2000s, critics outside of horror took an interest in Cronenberg and have largely celebrated his work. The Fly sits at an intersection before the mainstream opinion makers entered but when Cronenberg had perfected his vision.

The blu-ray transfer is better than could be hoped for from DVD, but it seems unlikely that it couldn't be improved. This film had wide release, and it is unlikely that a better source couldn't have been found, or that more effort couldn't have been expended for what is an important release. Darker scenes have almost uniform noise, and attendant loss of colour range, and only the tightest closeups are free of all artifacts. The image is nonetheless fairly clean and bright in well lit scenes. The audio is a simple mix reflecting the era for this type of film, and it is clear and adequate. Though there are reservations concerning the picture, it is unlikely The Fly will ever look better. Perhaps a 4K release might improve the source work, but it is unlikely that the expense would be considered and it really doesn't matter very much.

The extras are wonderfully generous and seem to combine all of the extras from previously released formats.

This is definitely worth buying.",1455840000,3,1827,5.059800664451827

This remake is rated R, and features gory special effects and makeup that were incredible for a mid-eighties movie. While this movie is nothing fancy in terms of plot, it nevertheless has great special effects and acting. Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis were perfectly cast for their respective roles, and have some good chemistry on screen. I really appreciated how the movie gets progressively darker as time went on. The first 30-40 minutes are lighthearted, and it almost feels like you're not watching a sci-fi/horror film. However, things change to darkness and an emotion-filled world of suspense and action. This is a movie that builds momentum, and director David Cronenberg rewards patience with a spectacular ending. I recommend this remake of a classic.

Produced by Mel Brooks production company, who also did The Elephant Man, they originally wanted David Cronenberg to direct, but he was busy with Total Recall. That project fell through for Cronenberg, as did the directed who was to replace him, so Cronenberg was back in. Jeff Goldblum takes the lead role of a scientist who develops a transporter. He tries it on himself and is fused with a fly catch in the transporter, eventually turning into a fly. This has the Cronenberg concept of metamorphosis seen in all of his movies and the classic Cronenberg special effects that will gross you out. They also used a rotating set built in a cylinder to get Jeff Goldblum, who is great, crawling down from the ceiling. A similar set was used in the hallway scene of Inception.",1436400000,,914,4.648148148148148

275423,4,6300248135,"David Cronenberg has his own style of filmmaking that pushed boundaries in many regards in science fiction. I feel he came to his apex with The Fly. This movie delves right into the implications of super-science gone wrong with the right amount of drama, horror and thrills. While it's not my favorite movie I do admire a lot of what it has going for. If you desire a bit more refinement in your monster/horror flicks The Fly delivers.

The original movie came out in 1958, and while Cronenberg's remake holds a lot of elements from the first film in many other ways it is a completely different animal. Think of it as a variation on a theme, but not so much that deems the movie to not be considered a remake. The Fly is about a gifted scientist (Jeff Goldblum) on the verge of perfecting teleportation (disintegration and reintegration of matter from one place to another).  In his haste to finish testing he accidentally lets a common house fly into the teleport chamber. The technology moves the matter on a genetic level and doesn't differentiate from two separate beings. So the fly's DNA is bonded with his. Slowly he starts to transition into something very different than human, and it worries his girlfriend (Geena Davis). This is the crux of the plot. It may sound pretty simple, but the devil is truly in the details.

The movie doesn't jump straight to ""mad scientist turning into mutant fly"" mode right off the bat. With this movie you are given plenty of time to follow the downward spiral of his experiments from a good starting point. We are introduced to Seth Brundle (the aforementioned mad scientist) when he has already perfected teleportation of inorganic material, but he is trying to create teleportation for humans. We get to see a bit of his creative process when perfecting the technology, and a decent excuse for his shortsightedness. After that we get a slow burn on the changes he undergoes, both physically and mentally. It's a well done roller coaster ride that gives you lots of time to soak up what's happening.

The characters are very well rounded. Brundle is well written as a kind of a shut in that lacks a bit of social finesse. Jeff Goldblum does a good job keeping the character intelligent while at the same time exploring the various levels of madness that come and go for Brundle. Geena Davis plays the girlfriend that lends a source of balance and levelling for both the viewer and the characters involved. Even the jerk ex-boyfriend (John Getz) is a rather complicated character that offers much more than just being a romantic rival. Basically you have fully rounded, three dimensional characters in a film genre where it's easy to veer off into stereotypes. This I feel is the greatest virtue of the movie. It makes all the other aspects of the film that much better because complex character development makes just about everything else more believable and engaging.

This being a monster movie how the monster is portrayed has a lot of weight, and The Fly is no slouch. Brundle's changes are like a step by step process, and the further he goes in the more grotesque and alien he looks. Teeth and other extremities start falling off. Brundle starts eating in grosser ways. Then finally his skin just falls off and you get the final monster. The make up and effects are very effective through this process, and the final creature does look cool and creepy. I do notice the limitations of the final creature in regards to special effects, but that is a sign of the times where puppetry and animatronics weren't on the same level as we see these days. It's a good call to wait until the finale to get to the final monster, and the way it's presented is great. Also I can tell they did the best they can to limit the amount of screen time on the creature, both for dramatic effect and I'm assuming also to keep the animatronic limitations from showing too much.

This Blu-Ray release is a pretty good version of the film, but I can't help it could be better. The video is indeed high definition and the images are a lot clearer and the colors a lot more defined, but if just feels like it could have been better. I have seen movies remastered from the 80's that have a good deal sharper image without removing the original film grain. It's not bad enough to not want this disc, but it would be nice to see a future release with a better remaster. Audio is clean on the TS-HD Lossless Master Audio 5.1, but this movie isn't super dynamic in audio so your milage may vary depending on your expectations. You also get Dolby Digital 5.1 in English with a mono Spanish and French track as well (subtitles in English, Spanish, Cantonese and Korean). The extra features are impressive for a movie this age. Here's what you get:

Audio Commentary - Director David Cronenberg gives a very interesting commentary, and you get some great material from him here.

Fear Of The Flesh: The Making Of The Fly - This is a massive documentary running over 2 1/2 hours long, and it covers just about every aspect of this film. It's a great look into how the film came to be, even if it gets a bit long winded at times.

The Brundle Museum Of Natural History - All the gory practical effects from the film can be seen here, including how they made it.

EPK Featurette - This is a promotional plug for the film dressed as a making of featurette. It's a vintage extra from back when they were releasing the movie.

Deleted/Extended Scenes - Six deleted scenes in various levels of production (a couple are storyboards) and quality (some are VHS level visuals). It's nothing the movie misses, and in fact are good to be not included in any director's cut. Still an fascinating view of how some scenes were interpreted before the final cut.

Test Footage - Just as it sounds. This is various pre-production footage or outtakes with some effects test and other snippets. It's a low quality transfer but is the best you will get.

Trivia Track - This is a Blu-Ray exclusive (the other features are on the DVD version as well). It's a pop up trivia track you have appear during the film. Not really much in the way of extra information you can't find from the other features, but it is a neat way to present the information.

Still Galleries  - Five photo galleries with tons of still images from production shots to promo materials.

Text-Based Extras - You get the complete short story, The Fly, written by George Langelaan that the movies are based on. You also get three vintage articles that were printed on  Cinefex and American Cinematographer back in 1986.

BD-J Flyswatter - Another Blu-Ray exclusive. It's a Java based video game similar to Whack-a-Mole, except with flies that you swat. Not much int he way of an extra feature... or a fun game.

Make no mistake. The Fly is a horror sci-fi film with all the gory bits and the shocking bits. However it has the character development that catapult it to a much higher level. Even if you aren't into gross special effects (and there is a moderate amount here) I think you would still find this a good movie to see. If you are all into horror films take note that this film is more like the classic horror film from ages past instead of the more recent types that try to shock and startle you or fill you with dread. It's still worth checking out, but just keep your expectations where they should.",1432771200,2,7374,4.585421412300684

The original is a Wayne Zalinsky story of a mad scientist building a teleporter because, well, what else is a mad scientist gonna do in his basement? Teleporter goes wrong and he becomes a fifties movie monster complete with all the rubber and foam that entails.

This version gives our scientist real motivation for inventing the telepods and then tries to extrapolate what really would happen if human and insect genes were spliced (in all its gory detail).",1427328000,,538,4.774193548387097

Plenty has been said of the frighteningly good special effects, and he chemistry between the leads, but the heart of the story is almost an update of classic monster movies like The Wolfman. At a brisk 95 minutes, the film is especially lean, and Howard Shore's score punctuates each moment with rising fear, ending with ultimate realization of deepest terror and sadness. The human drama is so strong that the gravity of the film sucks you into its world, populated by just a few main players. Almost Shakespearian in its conclusion.

275621,4,6300248135,"This is a great creepy gross-you-out horror movie. I'm only giving it 4 Stars because with the passage of time, the special effects are a bit stale. One can only imagine what could be done with this nowadays.

The 1958 original is something of a classic in itself. I saw it when I was a child and, believe me, it was scary, mostly because you did not see David Hedison's transformation until you were well into the movie. It was all about the anticipation. When ""The Fly"" is trapped in the spider's web, I didn't laugh. I recoiled in horror at its fate. THE FLY was also one of the most beautifully acted, produced and photographed films of it's Era.

I only knew David Cronenberg from VIDEODROME, a rather confusing mess of a movie. In this version of The Fly, Jeff Goldblum plays Seth Brundle, a bachelor. (In the earlier movie, the good scientist was married). This change in marital status allows for a romantic Liaison between Goldblum and Geena Davis, lovers in real life. The most frightening aspect of the remake is that Geena's character realizes that she is pregnant AFTER Jeff's transformation is known to her. Imagine that, if you will!

Jeff Goldblum is so good in this movie that most critics though that He would merit an Oscar Nomination for his -performance. A win would have made Jeff the only actor besides Frederic March (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) to win an Oscar for a Horror Movie. Geena Davis is equally good as Jeff's love interest.

The transformation from man to ""Brundlefly"" is frightening, disgusting and utterly repulsive as you would imagine it would be in real life, were such a thing to happen. The only flaw I notice now is that some of the armatures and much of the makeup is not as convincing as it was when this film was first made. Still, in all, THE FLY is a very scary horror movie.",1405555200,,1820,4.539634146341464

275633,5,6300248135,"The Fly is a very successful horror/sci-fi movie.  At the same time, it is a very atypical specimen in the genre.

It does not rely on the successes that often characterize a good film of the genre.  Firstly, there is very little technological gee-wizardry.  The only science fiction aspects of the film are the telepods and the gene splicing.  Secondly, there is very little suspense.  There are no scenes where the audience tenses in anxiety as a character slowly reaches out for a doorknob, etc.  Thirdly, there's very little shock.  I don't recall a single scene that tried to take the audience by surprise.  Lastly, no one is being killed, or in fear of impending death.

Instead, The Fly is Lovecraftian with its horror.  There is a terrific sense of tragedy.  A young, intelligent scientist has met a charming young woman and they are falling in love.  He becomes mildly jealous, drinks, and tests the telepods using himself as a subject.  From that point on the trajectory cannot be changed.  The glacial advance of creeping dread cannot be escaped.  Their new love must die, hideous, mutilated.  The promising young scientist is on a course he cannot alter, a course of slow, inescapable decay.  The audience is seldom scared, seldom frightened, but is constantly truly horrified to witness the slow progression of Brundle's affliction.

The Fly is truly an accomplishment in the genre.  It truly does more with less, in a subtle work creating more horror and loathing than can its most violence-packed peers.  You feel a connection with the characters, and so are stabbed with horror at their afflictions.  The film offers a great story, great acting, and great special effects.  Highly recommended for mavens of the macabre.",1405468800,,1735,4.947916666666667

275636,5,6300248135,"Gus Van Sant's 1998 film Psycho is an extreme example of the needlessness of Hollywood remakes. Too often are they bereft of their own identity which is a key component for any great and memorable movie. However, there are exceptions, such as David Cronenberg's The Fly, a remake of the 1958 Kurt Neumann film. Cronenberg's outing works because it has a strong plot that is heavily altered from the original and complex visual effects that couldn't possibly be pulled off in the 1950's. On this basis, it was a necessary remake. The story follows scientist Seth Brundle as he works towards creating a teleportation system that allows living matter to pass through unharmed. After successfully teleporting a living baboon, Seth tries it out for himself. Unfortunately, a fly was trapped in the pod with him and their genes were spliced upon reanimation. His transformation into Brundlefly is slow and painful, as is his girlfriend's mental anguish when she discovers she is pregnant with Brundle's child. The story is morbid, twisted, and totally gripping. Although the relationship between Seth and Veronica isn't entirely convincing, it' still enough for the audience to get sucked into the film on an emotional level. Chris Walas, legendary make-up/special effects artist, lends his disturbed brilliance to the look of Brundlefly, probably the film's most memorable aspect. The many stages of fusion are perfectly designed and thought-out for maximum grossness. Walas' work in the last twenty minutes alone are worth the price of admission. Jeff Goldblum as Seth Brundle comes off as a genuine mad scientist. The delivery of his lines and his body language and ticks bring a surprising amount of depth and sympathy to his character. Geena Davis as Veronica is tolerable. She doesn't quite sell the hysteria of her character but she is at least an adequate leading lady. John Getz is funny as the despicable Stathis Borans, Veronica's ex-boyfriend and boss. Tight camerawork from Cronenberg and Mark Irwin and an atmospheric score by Howard Shore shape The Fly into a superb 80's remake of a 50's horror film, to be enjoyed right along with the equally brilliant The Thing by John Carpenter.",1402358400,,2192,5.108635097493036

275661,5,6300248135,"I admit right away that I LOVE the Fly!  Sure now that I'm older the film's truly not as frightening as it once was.  Seeing a man gradually transform into a human-sized house fly day by day isn't something that can actually happen, but it sure is entertaining to watch.  In fact I'd go so far as to say the Fly barely feels like a horror movie to me now.  I've either watched too many scary movies over the years and simply got used to them or maybe the actual horror elements of the Fly just don't hold up like they once did.  We *are* going back to the mid 80's after all when cheesiness in movies, TV shows and music was running wild.  Either way, who cares?  This movie is flat out exciting.  The writing is almost spot-on perfect.  It succeeds at everything but freaking me out.

It's about a man who creates a teleportation machine that enables one object to go from one machine to another.  He lives inside an apartment building and meets a journalist woman who can't wait to write an article about this.  Eventually the man gets a little impatient and perhaps arrogant and wants to risk the potential consequences by putting *himself* in the machine.  He insists on finding out if he can go through with the teleportation and walk away without any side effects.  That my friends, is a BAD idea!  And wouldn't you know it?  An innocent little fly happened to be inside the machine and sticking to the side of the window while the man was busy going from machine to machine.  No big deal right?  It's just a fly.  What's the worst that can happen?  Oh I dunno... everything.

Anyway the man steps out of the machine and believes he's perfectly fine.  However, after a while the fly similarities begin to develop for the man.  Slowly but surely, he becomes a fly!  He doesn't realize it at first however.  He just chalks up his unusual body-changing symptoms and hyperactive admiration for lust as something that can be dismissed.  This all probably sounds really cheesy to read but the movie is actually really well-done in the storytelling department.  You'll want to stick with this one until its conclusion to see what finally happens.

I guess my memory isn't as good as it once was.  Even though it's been over 20 years since I last watched the Fly, I could have sworn there was more development in how the man changes into a fly than there was, but last night while watching the movie it seemed like it was, well, not incomplete per say, but like there were a few details and segments eliminated.  Not sure if this particular version sold on amazon has any missing scenes, and I don't even know if scenes were deleted at all in *any* version for that matter.  It's probably just an episode of forgetfulness I'm going through.

Either way, my dad loves this movie as much as I do.  I remember he'd watch it on laidback Sunday afternoons in the late 80's/early 90's.  Highly recommended entertainment but don't expect it to be as terrifying as you probably remember it (or especially if you're seeing it for the first time).  On a final note while laying in bed watching this movie at 3 in the morning last night, my attention is temporarily forced towards the outside of my bedroom window where I see a green light raining down from the sky.  It was a shooting star (unless someone was shooting fireworks at 3 in the morning when it was 0 degrees outside... nah!)  Haven't seen one of those in years.",1391126400,3,3412,4.498371335504886

The film has his signature doughy rubbery visual sensibility but anyone who has been following him since Scanners should be used to that.  Hell, even Crash has that. and their aren't even any mutated physical transformations in it. Special effects are not why you see his movies.

275664,5,6300248135,"Having seen a few other David Croenberg films such as Videodrome and eXistenZ, I half expected the shocking visceral universe that would be created in this film. Whether it is the pulsing veins on top of the sexually stimulated TV set in Videodrome, or the organic fleshy pistols in eXistenZ, or the gradually evolving human fly in this film - Croenberg shows us images that we find nigh impossible to forget. Amazing cinematography and viscerality seem to come second nature to the likes of David Lynch and David Croenberg. The Fly and its universe sucks you in from the very beginning. The characters in the film are believable and likable, yet have their flaws and undesirable characteristics as we all do. In that sense they are very human and relate-able. You care for them, you care about their work and discovery/inventions, you care about the relationships they forge with each other, and you care for their physical and mental health throughout the entire movie. Both Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis's characters have their strict agendas and desire for work-related accomplishments and recognition but the relationship they develop complicates the completion of those. Jeff Goldblum's home and laboratory transform, just as he does, as he changes into Brundlefly. His changes aren't merely physical in nature, which is on its own a fascinating transformation to witness - he changes emotionally and mentally throughout the film. Each time he is visited by Geena Davis's character (and by us as the audience) we have absolutely no idea how he has changed since the last time we saw him, and there is a fear associated with that unknowing and mystery. This film is so much more than shock horror. One might see it on a commentary on people with addictions and how it affects those around them. A film we can both learn from and be entertained and fully engrossed by. It is definitely a film that creates an entire world to explore, remember, and revisit.

As usual, Cronenburg makes  excellent use of special effects, technology and atmosphere.

Goldblum's performance is powerful, as he battles the rapid changes in his physical condition, due to an experiment gone horribly wrong.
Geena Davis's eyes have the perfect expression of awe and fear as she watches his metamorphosis.... in fact, this is very much a retelling of Gregor Samsa's fate in Kafka's great horror story.
Also, this movie was released in 1986, when the AIDS crisis began, I think this adds to the tragedy of the story, as Sci-Fi often comments on current affairs.",1387497600,,637,5.057142857142857

275672,5,6300248135,"When I was small, I had nightmares about Brundlefly jumping through the window and kidnapping me. This movie is still truly disturbing after all these years, and this is Cronenberg's genius here--he knew how to make horror disturbing (something that even the most graphic of thrillers today have forgotten how to do effectively). Also, the film has an excellent idea of how to incorporate science fiction and fantastic elements into a script that works--a story that is set in reality but has one particular element in it that could only have escaped from someone's fantastic nightmare. I find the film moving, and Goldblum's performance overlooked even today, and yet most people only remember the disgusting parts. If there is a criticism of Cronenberg's enterprise, it is that his film feels and looks cold, from the 1980s modern dcor of Veronica's apartment/office areas, to Seth's dirty, grunge-tinged warehouse/apartment. This device is effective, but it is also draining--""The Fly"" is too brisk, too concerned with its cold science, to ever really get into the characters deeply enough or to present us with a story that provides criticism of a world view that posits scientific fact above everything else in life. However, this movie is still unforgettable, and since it's a childhood favorite, I can do nothing but love it.
As for the DVD presentation, this one is a keeper. The audio/visual layout on the first disc is fine, with the aspect ratio correctly transferred and the Cronenberg audio commentary worth your ears (at least once, c'mon people!). The sound is fine as well. Also, the second disc is worth your time if you are a nerd about sf/horror films like I am. The documentary about the making of the film is cool, and you get the great Brundlefly natural history museum piece which I find interesting (but, again, I am a nerd). If you are looking for the AMC documentary ""The Fly Papers,"" you will need to seek out the special edition DVD of ""The Fly II"", but other than that every great piece on this film is included on this second disc.
Overall, if you are a fan of the film, get this edition. I have not seen the film on BluRay, but I cannot imagine it adding much to the experience. These were the days of puppetry (which I still miss greatly), NOT CGI crap, so you (if you are a young person) might be disappointed with the special effects. But of course this is a love story. The reason not everyone can respond to it is because it is a Cronenberg love story, where the world is a colder place, and where (without syrup) we watch a loved one disintegrate and die of cancer (in effect) before our very eyes. This is Cronenberg's version of a Hollywood love story. Yet, for all of that, it remains a science fiction classic for a reason. Donut, anyone?",1387152000,,2779,4.720164609053498

275687,5,6300248135,"I feel as if anyone besides Cronenberg had made this movie, it would not come close to the singular effective vision he pulled off with this remake. During the early to mid 80's, Hollywood saw fit to do remaining's of old horror classics like The Thing, The Blob and Invasion of the Body Snatchers. I have watched all of these on multiple occasions and was gleefully pleased with each re-imagining. With each remake, the teams behind them were able to capitalize on an old story and not just revitalize them but, strictly my opinion, make them better. It's unfortunate that that same rejuvenation nowadays is put to completely unnecessary reworkings of the likes of Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm street, which both thought that turning things up to 11 would delude the audience into thinking that a) that's what movies nowadays need and b) that the originals needed fixing.

Now it was not as if audiences anywhere were clambering for an update of the Vincent Price film of the 50's but with an insatiably unique mind like Cronenberg behind it, it's a melding of two great artistic sources. The story is essentially a detailing of how greatness and power can and will always be man's downfall. Now what makes it watchable is how we can get swept up in the promise of power by the hands of a sympathetic, charismatic and brilliant scientist along with his equally sympathetic, brilliant and charismatic girlfriend.

The movie is labeled as a science fiction/horror film and believe me, and it makes that abundantly clear, but after watching it again you can see what attracted Cronenberg to this material, which is just as fascinating to us viewers: the fear of being alone, the exhilaration of discovery and the unknown, and the dread and horror of bodily invasion/mutilation.

While most of these themes have been on display in countless amounts of science fiction/horror movies, this one is able to make abundant strides in trying to grasp these longings of human discovery and ultimate failure.

I cannot give enough credit to the fantastic casting of Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. What makes this movie work on the base level is their relationship and how it elevates this film above most of the generation because of how unforced and genuine seeing these two doomed lovers interact. These characters are all we as an audience need to be able to digest and chew on until the grotesque transformation sequences that fill the latter half of this movie. I will say that every time I watch this movie, I make sure to eat way prior to it.

275715,4,6300248135,"When will Amazon ever separate reviews of BluRay discs from those of the Standard Definition DVDs?  When will most reviewers stop writing book report summaries of the plot and their opinions of the acting.  If I am interested in buying a blu ray DVD it is because I have already seen the movie and liked it and may already have it on a Standard DVD and want to know of the quality of the BD transfer.

For an older movie, the blu ray transfer is not bad at all.  It is not an outstanding transfer but one that really was, for the most part,  free of film grain and artifacting.  The colors of the video transfer do not pop as the movie was shot and its colors were muted in post production editing.  Many dark scenes but they did not hide the details which were pretty sharp to my eyes,  All in all, a pretty decent job.

The audio is DTSHD 5.1.  There were some excellent scenes with great use of the discreet channels but, for the most part, this movie is very dialogue driven and the surrounds infrequently needed or used.

The only extras, other than commentary, were trailers for other movies, and an annoyingly silly fly swatter game.  I hate buying a movie with advertisements for other films. When Blu Ray first came out the public was promised incredible extras, and, yes, sometimes we get them, but not on this disc.

For the $6.00 I paid for this, it was worthwhile to have and a decent transfer to boot, but it will not be your demo disc to show off your system.
All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.
Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

I admire the way this skips the typical pleasantries and dives right into the action, omitting any back-story to commence with the freak show everyone in the audience came to see; expertly streamlined, it's non-stop substance without a dull moment. Despite the occasional campy slip-up, the primary storyline has actually aged surprisingly well and still plays as an eye-widening exhibit of suspense and repulsion. Jeff Goldblum, with his quick lip, piercing eyes and slightly inhuman appearance, was seemingly born for his role as the bright, socially awkward science geek-turned guinea pig that sparks the entire affair. Despite a throwaway evil ex-boyfriend angle that lingers around its fringes and a title that shamelessly gives away its biggest moment, this remains an unpredictable thrill ride of an experiment with a one-track mind, a few serious questions about the rate of scientific progress and some great visual effects.",1329868800,3,1005,5.490322580645161

275722,5,6300248135,"David Cronenberg's version of George Langelaan's classic science fiction story plus a second disc loaded with special features makes ""The Fly"" Collector's Edition DVD well worth owning. ""The Fly"" also happens to be one of the 20th century's great morality plays.
 Jeff Goldblum plays physicist Seth Brundle, who is experimenting with teleportation. The fire in his mind for this idea blinds Brundle to the fact that he's playing with fire. His name conveys tragedy. Seth was the third son of Adam and Eve (see Book of Genesis), the one to cover over the tragedy of Cain and Abel. ""The Fly"" teaches that human nature can just as easily lead to destruction in the sons of Seth as it did with Cain. ""Brundle"" is pretty close to ""blunder,"" tipping us to the scientist's eventual downfall. But thinking deeper within the context of the story, we discover an even greater insight, one that the Jewish High Holiday liturgy teaches but we flawed humans seem to forget between one Rosh Hashana and the next - you cannot sin repeatedly and repent. In other words, sin deforms us and it's extremely difficult (for most, impossible) to become whole again. Seth's teleportation pods and the breakdown of his body and mind (superb makeup and special effects) comprise a wonderful parable of this.
 Despairing about love (caused by not being at peace with the complexities of human relationships) is an easily overlooked but key element in Seth's undoing. On the surface most viewers will realize the wisdom of don't drink and teleport.
 ""The Fly"" is a pro-life movie. Seth's plea to Veronica (Geena Davis) not to have the abortion - ""Please don't kill me"" - is deep pathos and very moving.  Veronica's admirable love for Seth amid worsening circumstances will ring true to all those that have cared for someone through cancer, AIDS, or some other debilitating illness. Figuratively, Veronica grows wings of love and her continuing visits to Seth's lab amid increasing danger and sadness establish the truth of what Beatle George Harrison once taught - ""There's more to it than just these bodies of ours.""
 Cronenberg expertly builds the horror (Veronica's ""Be afraid, be very afraid"" line works better than a thunder clap) and he doesn't skimp at the end. Broken bodies and wounded spirits are before us as the curtain falls. Masterful from beginning to end is Cronenberg, who personally rewrote Charles Edward Pogue's screenplay. No words necessary to convey the great lesson at the end of ""The Fly,"" just as true today as 25 years ago when the movie was released - sin kills but if we're humble and loving enough G-d gives us wings to rise above.",1328400000,3,2634,4.896860986547085

275727,4,6300248135,"""The Fly"" is one of the best written sci-fi stories ever told concerning the dangers of humankind's inherent impatience daring to play 'God'. Both movie adaptions of the story (starring David Hedison in 1958 and Jeff Goldblum in 1986) are well done. The first had a more Shakespearian slant as far as tragedy, since the protagonist had a long and loving marriage and a son he doted on. However, it lacked in the science application of melding two entities on a genetic level. The second, in my opinion, nailed the science of a gradual mutation of those entities, but it lacked the tragedy of the first, since the wife and son were now replaced by a girlfriend, which muted the tragedy effect. If someone could combine the best aspects of both adaptions, they'd have themselves one hell of a movie.",1301616000,,797,4.7

I thought it was one of the strongest endings of any film, and certaintly the strongest of any scifi ending. It has an amazing cast including Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. It was also gory and almost disturbing which I found suprising.

275729,4,6300248135,"I remember seeing this shortly after it came out in 1986 (oh there's no point in being coy, I'm 40.)  I didn't like it.  Now, I appreciate it a great deal more.  Why?  I think there are a number of reasons.  For one, I hold director David Cronenberg's work in high esteem. At age 15, I don't think I was ready for a departure from the norm, a horror film that was artistically surreal as many of his films are.  Now, I'll gladly take something as fresh and innovative as this over the typical Hollywood sci-fi tripe any day.  I also think having an affinity for Kafka's The Metamorphosis doesn't hurt.  After all, that's what this is...a re-telling not just of the original film The Fly but of Kafka's man-turned-insect, becoming even further removed from a xenophobic society than he already was.  This time, the story is told almost through the drug-saturated lens of the 1980s.  That brings me to my final point: the character of Seth Brundle.  Back in my mid-teens, there was no way I could appreciate what it was like to have a job, to struggle for something I really wanted, to fear for those I love that they might be hurt either on accident or on purpose...or worst of all, by me.  In fact, his whole impetus for going through with his teleportation in the first place is to impress a woman, desiring her love.  It's a human tragedy and you really get that coming through from Seth Brundle.  As Brundlefly, he repulses you at every turn, almost bringing up a new and more horrific attribute of his new form (e.g. the vomiting) with each now scene in his slow, downward spiral into flydom.  Jeff Goldblum gives a performance that makes you feel simultaneously disgusted by, angry with, and heartbroken for him all at the same time.  It is overwhelming at times, thought-provoking for the majority of it, and never once does it let your attention wander away from the screen.  I am glad that I can finally see this film for what it truly is: a triumph.",1300924800,3,1958,4.517045454545454
275730,5,6300248135,"This review is for the Fly Blu Ray edition. I am going to be honest and tell you that I saw The Fly in theaters when it first came out and I had not seen it again until recently when I bought the Blu Ray from Amazon.com for $8.49 on gold box deal. I love science fiction and I think the story is a timeless classic about a man who turns to a monster, in this film, as result of an accident during a scientific experiment.

It is a very well-made film where all aspects of film making come together to create the intended effect. Visual effects are stunning, specially makeup. I am glad that they did this movie back in 1987 before CGI became the dominant visual effect tool. If this movie were made today, they would probably use CGI to create the monster visuals instead of using makeup and I am afraid it would have lost some of the organic effects which can be created only through makeup. A great horror movie needs a great score and the Fly has a great score portraying the tone of the story perfectly.

I am also impressed by the number and the quality of bonus materials and special features. There are several documentaries, when played all, over 2 hours. There are deleted scened, feature commentaries, behind the scenes footages, and many more. Bonus features exceeded my expectations. I own many fantasy-horror movies on Blu ray and many lack quality bonus features. The Fly is definitely an exception.",1300579200,8,1413,4.515625

However at least this movie is cleaned up with no defects like lines and dirt , like on lets say 'kellys heroes'  this is a older movie that looks good on blu ray. The grain isn't a problem to me as it was part of the film, so this blu ray edition is well worth owning. This type of release is the LEAST we should expect , a clean print! The movie itself is a classic remake of a classic horror movie, in fact someone should take all three of the original fly series and put them on a two disc blu ray set!  that would rock.
This movie has never looked better and this is it's a clean print so no anger should be directed to it. If you want to rant about a bad print go to 'the terminator'  or 'kellys heroes'  there's no excuse for dirt on blu ray prints or LINES , this one has none of that so there should be no one star reviews about the quality of this blu ray.

275734,5,6300248135,"Let me state from the beginning that this is my favourite film of all time. I am a huge movie buff and have a massive library of dvd's, and yet somehow this still remains my number one. There are many reasons for this- film races along at a terrific pace throughout and is the perfect meld of sci-fi, horror and drama. The direction by David Cronenberg is simply sublime. Jeff Goldblum, Geena Davis and John Getz are all perfectly cast in their roles. The effects are still strong and hold up nearly 25 years after the films initial release.

The story follows Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), who is working on something quite big- a pair of telepods that allow for instant teleportation. The film begins with him inviting the lovely Vernonica Quaife (Geena Davis) back to his apartment/ lab to see what he has been working on. She is amazed at what she finds and the two of them decide that she will follow him and write a book about his invention. Before long the two fall in love, and her boss (John Getz) gets extremely jealous of this; beginning an intriguing love triangle. In the meantime, something went wrong when Seth Brundlefly teleported himself for the first time. Something got in there with him and went undetected, causing genetic splicing between himself and a housefly. From thereon things get extremely weird, and gory...

I cannot rave about this film enough. Jeff Goldblum gives one of the truly quintessential lead performances in his role of Seth Brundle- from his nerdy, awkward beginnings to his horrific demise in the final third. I won't spoil anything for the uninitiated other than to say this is like a superhero movie gone wrong. Instead of becoming selfless and heroic as a result of the splicing incident, he becomes hell-bent on self preservation. The movie has been seen as an allegory for everything from AIDS to heroin addiction.

As for the blu-ray transfer - it really is quite impressive. The effects look terrific in high-definition, and though it will not become a show-off disc it is a vast improvement over the previous dvd releases. The extras are the same as the special dvd edition that was released a few years back, and there is the addition of a new trivia track. When you consider that one of those extras is a 3 hour-plus documentary about the making of the film, this becomes a no-brainer.

Sure, at first you're flying around like a monkey from the rafters, and rocking and rolling the king-size with your Cassanova wiles. But soon enough, you despise other flesh, mumbling in the dim static, acid-reflux in overtime, dribbling all over your sugar cakes. And your acne has gone plaid.

It is by now fairly well known that Nancy Reagan was a scriptwriter on the latter installments of the ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" franchises (as well as ""April Fool's Day"" and ""Happy Birthday to Me"") during her ""Just Say No"" campaign in the 1980s. Nancy would come up with the goriest ways to kill wayward teen campers loose from too much reefer, while having tea with Anhk, who was in charge of Ronnie's naptime bed-wetting vision quests. These experiments were crude, but effective while humans were consigned to live in a clunky, pre-Internet world.

But it wasn't until ""The Fly"" -- which I at first mistook for a conspiracy involving scientists, under the command of the corporations, turning the populace insectile, a people consumed only with consuming, and rotting in self-made, technological wastelands -- that I began to realize that drugs aren't cool.

Believe it or not, 1986's David Cronenberg film, ""The Fly"", is both a masterpiece and a remake at the same time, and here's the story:

Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is a scientist working on a world-changing invention. He has developed a working teleportation system! With two intimidating telepods connected to a high-tech computer, Seth can send objects from one pod to the other by teleportation, but his crux is the human issue. Flesh in general, actually, which only confuses the computer thus far. Enter journalist Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis), who gets involved with both Brundle's invention story and Brundle himself. It's this love story between Seth and Veronica that is the strength of the picture, no small part being the unwelcome third party of Veronica's ex-boyfriend/boss, the insufferable Stathis Borans (John Getz). However, the core of the film is Brundle's transformation story, an allegory for aging, disease, and death. You see, as Seth and Veronica's relationship blooms, his project's development seemingly benefiting, a wrench is thrown into the gears in the form of a tiny insect. An otherwise harmless housefly just happens to fly into one of Seth's telepods as he decides to test it out on himself, and the confused computer ends up merging the two, sending Seth into a downward spiral of physical and mental decay and distortion that at times is more than a little difficult to watch. And you can imagine how hard it must be for Veronica, who soon discovers she is carrying Seth's potentially affected offspring.

Remakes and sequels are rampant these days, with the big Hollywood studios only wanting to take a chance on films that should guarantee some solid returns, and a lot of film fans seem to be more than a little put out about it. Granted, they can feel very uninspired, and many such films, especially the remakes, aren't worth the price of a ticket when you could probably own the usually superior originals for just as much. However, there probably aren't many better cases for the ""remake"" than Cronenberg's take on ""The Fly"". The first film version came out in 1958 and spawned a couple of sequels. It definitely had its cheese factor, but myself and many others still enjoy it today. It was bizarre, but very entertaining (as the bizarre often is). The remake takes the same basic premise of a scientist getting into his teleportation pod with an unnoticed fly and coming out in a bad way for it. However, at the same time, it is so very different and adds so much to the story. It's so much more than just an update. As I mentioned before, and as the director points out often in his commentary on this blu-ray disc, the film is largely two things: A tragic love story and an allegory of aging and death. In fact, it wasn't intended so much to be about disease, but the heightened fear of the AIDS virus at the time of the film's release certainly made it seem that way, especially considering the make-up effects used on Jeff Goldblum throughout that did take disease into account as an inspiration. Anyway, this combined romance story and personal disintegration story is so masterfully presented in ""The Fly"" that it is without a doubt one of the most unforgettable films you'll ever watch! The Oscar winning effects are high on the gross-out meter, but nothing about this film is over-the-top (deleted scenes aside), unless you count a very disturbing childbirth dream sequence. The troubling thing about The Fly is just how realistic it all is, and it IS downright horrifying. Actually, if I had one gripe about this film, it's that I do wish the final incarnation of Brundlefly looked a wee bit more like a fly, though Cronenberg insists that he wanted it to keep the ability to convey emotion. I still think body language could have said enough and Seth should have turned out even more fly-like, but it doesn't affect the movie's excellence and it remains a masterpiece to me.

The performances in ""The Fly"" (the cast is very small) are outstanding. Of course, Jeff Goldblum always is a treat to watch. The writing at times is sheer poetry. The music is excellent and I already mentioned the Academy honored effects. This is one of those sci-fi/horror films that really does the genre a service by going all the way as a work of storytelling art. The Blu-Ray is no slouch either. The film looks and sounds better than ever and there is a wealth of bonus features, including a very lengthy making-of featurette and a director commentary. There are also galleries, a fly swatting game, and pop up trivia, though the pop up trivia isn't really worthwhile if you listen to the commentary and watch the making-of. Trailers, at least one Easter Egg, and other bonus features are also included. I didn't really understand the Personal Scene Selections feature or how it was different from the regular Scene Selection. Over all though, a very impressive and highly affordable Blu-Ray release I definitely recommend. Sci-Fi horror fan or not, if you are trying to build a genre transcending library of the best films ever, you've got to have a space somewhere for Cronenberg's ""The Fly"".",1258502400,,5309,4.851157662624035

275745,5,6300248135,"David Cronenberg took the same approach as John Carpenter did with his remake of ""The Thing""; he created a film that is every bit as unique as the original film returning to the themes that interested him. The screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue and Cronenberg focuses on Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldbloom) who creates a device to teleport things but he's failed at teleporting humans. Science writer Ronnie (Gena Davis) chronicles his attempt to figure out why he can't transport humans. He licks the problem and foolishly decides to make himself the first human test subject. When a fly accidently gets into the telepod, the computer combines the DNA of Seth and the fly creating a bizarre hybrid in the process.

The blu-ray looks good but not as brilliant as I had hoped. Keep in mind that the source is over 21 years old. The fly does look better than the DVD with a sharper image, better depth and detail but it doesn't look as good as a more recent film. Make no mistake though it IS an improvement but it's incremental not a huge leap.

We get all the extras from the previous two disc edition including the excellent documentary on the making of the movie. The new extras here include a swat the fly game (which like the annoying ""Build a Gort"" a game on ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is a waste of resources). We also get a good trivia track and blu-ray search index. All the other extras including the commentary tracks and featurettes are ported over from the regular DVD.

While the Blu-ray transfer here isn't a huge leap compared to the DVD (I suspect the previous high def remaster that was prepared for the DVD reissue forms the basis for this version), it does look better than the DVD. It's a pity that Fox didn't elect to do an upgraded high def transfer but what we do get looks quite good. The film which came out during the beginning of the AIDS epidemic was seen as a metaphor for that outbreak the film manages to touch on a number of common themes in Cronenberg's work. It's a terrific film that manages to be creepy, humorous and touching. I'd give the film five stars, the transfer three and the extras four.",1239753600,,2132,4.518134715025907

275749,5,6300248135,"I wasn't expecting much from `The Fly'.  I actually thought that it looked rather corny, and I loathe the actor that is Jeff Goldblum almost all of the time so it was really a stroke I luck that I decided to even give this movie a try.  My friends were all talking about it one day and I felt left out, beings that I was the only one of us who had yet to see it and so I rented it and watched it and, get this, loved it.

The film centers around brilliant scientist Seth Brundle, a man on the verge of greatness.  He invites journalist Veronica `Ronnie' Quaife back to his place to see the glorious invention he has been working on, and once she witnesses its potential she becomes absorbed in Brundle's life.  Brundle has created a device that can transport matter from one pod to another.  The machine is not able to handle living matter yet, but that is a bug Brundle is working out.  When Brundle finally does decide to test his machine on himself he finds that the results are much more than he expected.

Cronenberg brilliantly crafts `The Fly' into a top notch horror film, a film that is as scary as it is dreadful; as gory as it is detestable, but it also has a beating heart, and that is not something a lot of films of this nature possess.  As Seth transforms into the dreadful Brundlefly we see his mental capabilities leaving him, and as he turns into something dangerous to the ones he loves (namely Ronnie) we can see genuine humanity in his fight to save her (and eventually himself).  There are moments towards the end of the film that recalled `King Kong' to me, watching Ronnie crumble as her beloved is destroyed before her eyes.

One thing I noticed that I thought was really interesting was the fact that in the opening scenes, where Seth is showing Ronnie his work, their eyes are glossed over and practically bulging from their skulls.  They truly appear to be `buglike' and I really think this small detail adds layers to the films depth of character.

So that brings me to the acting.

Like I mentioned on the outset, I generally loathe Goldblum.  He is usually a very annoying actor in my eyes.  Here though he is spot on perfection.  This was truly the perfect role for him.  Every one of his usual mannered ticks are in full form here, but they work beautifully.  I truly can't see anyone else playing Seth.  Geena Davis is also wonderful here.  I actually love her as an actress and think that she has continued to deliver film after film.  As Ronnie she brings a true raw emotional connection to the film.  Without her dedication to her performance the films moral would have went unnoticed, but her believability as Seth deteriorates before her is really what solidifies this films greatness.

So, in the end, `The Fly' is truly one of Cronenberg's finest films, it may even be his best (I openly admit to not having seen all of his work, but of what I have seen I think this, along with `A History of Violence' is my favorite).  `The Fly' is truly a brillaint horror film, but even more than that it is a brilliant film; period.  Cronenberg has a way of getting under our skin and festering, and `The Fly' is no exception to that talent.",1217980800,4,3170,4.422413793103448

275755,5,6300248135,"A scientist on the verge of a technical breakthrough, is stymied by his failure to understand the body in other than intellectual terms.  His affair with the reporter who enters his life to document his discoveries awakens him to the power of the flesh -- but the flesh is nothing if not unpredictable and irrational and a ""fly in the ointment"" changes the outcome of a pivotal experiment, leading to disastrous concequences.  The Fly represents a perfect blend of Cronenberg's b-horror sensibility and his obsession with the overlap between man and machine, flesh and technology.  It takes what might have been a fairly campy remake of a fairly campy horror film and elevates it to a whole new level, giving it an intriguing science fiction premise and a horrific conclusion.  Jeff Goldblum gives a brilliant performance, among his best, as a cerebral scientist who is gradually overcome by the flesh in the form of libidinal urges.  The special effects are just right -- not enough to overwhelm the story, but sufficiently convincing to horrify.  I saw this with a large group very recently, many of whom had never seen it before, and there were uncomfortable laughs and gasps in all the right places.  What is even better, as we talked about the film afterwards there was a lot to say.  The Fly is right up there with Alien and Blade Runner and Total Recall and the Thing as one of the very best genre films of the 1980s (or of any decade for that matter -- I can't think of anything in the 90s, except for the Matrix, and maybe Pan's Labyrinth in this decade, that matches these in terms of the combination of both thrills and intellectual excitement).",1208131200,22,1656,4.705882352941177

This was not the first Cronenberg film I had seen, but the fact that he directed it with his trademark weirdness made it all the more effective. The original ""The Fly"" was a pasty bit of horror obviously dated by the time I first saw it. Though it was a good film, it lacked that certain element that this new version displays in spades! It departs from the original film fairly early on, but for good reason. We see first-hand the dangers of messing around with
Mother Nature""!

Jeff Goldblum as Brundle, is a geek who works for a company at the forefront of scientific discovery. He has recently built a device that will make obsolete any and all present transportation systems. Geena Davis plays a reporter of a science magazine assigned to cover a convention dealing with scientific breakthroughs.
 After meeting, ol' Jeff's hormones are overtaking his reason, and invites Geena to his ""abode"", which is not much more than warehouse space! He shows his new invention to Geena, who promptly reports it to her Editor. While he gets to know her better, he is wary of her involvement with her magazine, so makes a deal with her. For exclusivity, she tells NO one about his invention.
Jealousy rears it's ugly head, and Brundle, in a fit of drunken confusion, decides to give the device it's first ""human trial"" (the previous trials ended in rather horrifying fashion). It's successful! There's only one problem....You guessed it, a fly was with him during the trial!
All appears well, at first, but as time passes, Brundle begins his ""transformation"". In Cronenberg fashion, we are witness to what has to be the most disgusting mutation in all of film history!! Even after all these years, I have found no other film that tops it!
Though the Hedison/Price version of ""The Fly"" was a very good film from the 50's era, this version is vastly superior. There was a sequel, which dealt with Brundle's son, which was O.K., but a bit inferior to this film. Again, we have another Cronenberg jewel!!",1206230400,,2163,4.689473684210526

275760,5,6300248135,"An outstanding example of a remake that surpassed its predecessor, Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" is at once a sci-fi thriller, a grueling gothic horror tale and a tragic romance, with a visceral edge that can still make some viewers cringe and wince. As star Geena Davis observes in the supplement: It's a Cronenberg movie, so you're gonna get a bit wet.

In summary: Seth Brundle, a brilliant, isolated researcher, has developed a system that can teleport an object through space by disintegrating it in one spot and reintegrating it in another. ""It'll change the world as we know it,"" he explains to Ronnie the tech journalist, who further rocks his world by falling in love with him in the course of covering his project for her magazine. Problem is, he has not yet been successful in teleporting any living subjects ... without nasty results. Inspired by Ronnie, he reprograms his system to get ""crazy"" enough about flesh to dis/re-integrate life effectively, and is successful at last. Unfortunately (also because of Ronnie, in a fit of jealousy), he briefly abandons rationality one evening and teleports himself.

In addition to a newfound surge of near uncontainable energy, Brundle eventually notices a change coming over him; skin discoloration, hair and nails coming loose, and a viscous white fluid discharge all over. He discovers that another organism, an ordinary housefly, was teleported with him and introduced into his genetic makeup, and that he will ultimately transform into some other life form, part insect, part human. The outcome is ultimately horrific as the filmmakers and performers take us through each stage of Brundle's grueling mutation into BrundleFly.

That's it in a nutshell. Jeff Goldblum's Oscar-nominated performance as Brundle is unforgettable and (along with Chris Walas' eye-popping effects makeup and prosthetics) is what elevates this 1986 version far beyond Fox's earlier attempt. Director Cronenberg was never one to shy away from gruesomeness in film, and you can almost feel what is happening to Seth as he changes, one thing that makes this film hard to recommend as ""entertainment"". The Blu-Ray HD transfer is outstanding, though maybe not crystal clear 100% of the time, rich and textured and brings this dark tale to ferocious life.

The supplement included, ""Fear of the Flesh"", is a full length love letter to fans of this movie, touching on every step of its history from the original director and why Cronenberg wasn't available at first, to a ghastly upbeat alternative ending that was (thank God) scrapped. The Butterfly Baby .... yeesh! An interesting side note is how the gorgeous Geena Davis began her career with her role as Ronnie. There's the rotating room from scenes where Brundle climbs the walls and ceiling. And yes, of course, generous looks at the prosthetics and puppetry that make up The Fly's nightmare final act. It's both the movie and the book of the movie in one package which, again for fans, is well worth owning.

This bug has flown a long way since its first appearance as a short story in Playboy in the 50s; in that sense, the mutation has been beautiful indeed. An immaculately packaged classic, for those with plenty of time and a strong stomach.",1199059200,3,3225,5.043151969981238
275761,5,6300248135,"Gorgeous 80's power couple Geena Davis and Jeff Goldblum bring their A-games to this Cronenberg helmed update of the campy sci-fi classic.  I have no qualms in this case saying the remake far outshines the original.

A scientist (Goldblum) dedicated to developing ""Telepods"", machines that can transfer any object or living creature from one location to another (part of his motivation for wanting to eliminate the need for conventional vehicles?  He has motion sickness), meets a spunky journalist (Davis) at a corporate party and invites her back to show her his creation.  Problem?  The machines do not react well when attempting to ""transport"" any kind of living creature (they have not yet been tried on a human being for this reason).

Romance between the two ensues much to the chagrin of Davis's ex (John Getz, who does fine work as well), and Goldblum is inspired to cure the bug (you'll pardon me using that expression) that kept his machines from being able to transport living matter.

In what could be a PSA for ""Don't Drink and Teleport"", Goldblum decides to teleport himself after knocking back a few due to jealously over Davis and her ex's relationship.  Guess what got into his pod with him?

This is a standout film for all time, featuring top-caliber performances and Oscar winning make-up and special FX, although if you are looking for mindless gore that won't get to you on any other level, you should look elsewhere.

It's done in the perfect light, with, surprisingly, some issues that are relevant today.

Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is a very determined scientist thinking he has the answer to everyone's problems.  He feels his discovery will change the world.  Before he can tell anybody, he has to make sure it works.  When he tests himself, a fly is also inside, resulting in the creation of 'Brundlefly'.

This two disc set includes a commentary from director Cronenberg, deleted scenes, most of which are still in rough form.  There's also three featurettes documenting the three transformation processes.  Included are the script, plus documentaries and other promotional material.

275765,5,6300248135,"I'm old enough to remember seeing the original movie of The Fly in theaters. I remember being disappointed because Vincent Price played a nice guy, and also because the rubber fly head was cheesy even by 1950s standards. Also, I kept wanting to yell at the screen ""If he's got the fly's head, he's got a fly's brain so how can he write stuff?""

David Cronenberg's remake is lots better, even though the basic ""science"" is just as silly (even if the fly ""fused"" with Seth Brundle in transit, there wouldn't be enough fly DNA to take over Seth's body, nor would fly DNA be likely to bond with human DNA). Basically, Cronenberg does ""Love Story"" by way of Frankenstein: nerdy scientist meets hot reporter, they fall in love, he messes with nature and becomes a 185 pound fly. Because Cronenberg underplays and maintains a naturalistic style, it all works.

When you get quirky Jeff Goldblum and quirky Geena Davis (who were lovers when they made the movie) as the couple, you get quirkiness cubed, and the cuteness factor actually helps, since you like these weirdly self-absorbed characters. John Getz as the third side of the love triangle plays it straight, grounding the feyness of the other two. Carol Spiers' gorgeously lit and claustrophobic sets create the mood, and the gooey, lumpy, disintegrating body parts created by Chris Walas (who designed the Gremlins) provide the horror. And the most wonderful thing of all is that the film runs 95 minutes! Cronenberg did not feel the need of every director these days to bloat a story into a two and a half hour torment.

The second disk on the DVD has a making of documentary that runs longer than the movie! Oddly, Cronenberg does the commentary track (which is absorbing and informative) but doesn't do any interviews. Some of the doc is interesting, but I didn't feel the need to spend so much time with the wounded ego of the original writer whose screenplay was rejected, and I didn't need quite so many minutes of on the set hijinks. But how the makeup was created (especially the fly vomit) and how they made Goldblum walk on the ceiling were definitely worth seeing. One weird thing for me: Goldblum on the interviews has a crewcut and reminded me so much of the late Tony Randall (Felix in The Odd Couple on TV) that it was freaky.

Anyway, this is a taut, emotionally satisfying, beautifully constructed movie. When you hold it up against the meretricious splatter/torture movies that pass for horror today, The Fly seems a masterpiece. Dare I suggest that the DVD should generate a lot of buzz?",1193702400,3,2557,4.726457399103139

275767,5,6300248135,"Seth Bundle (Jeff Goldblum)is a scientist with a special teleportation device that can teleport molecular structures and one day he experiments with it until a fly accidently gets in the machine with him and fuses with him. A beautiful jouranlist (Geena Davis) falls in love with him but notices strange things happening to him as he grows sicker and weird looking every day like if he was decaying but he's actually mutating into a weird fly-like creature.

A powerful and horrifying sci-fi horror shock-feast from Canadian sci-fi and terror mastermind David Cronenberg is an excellent remake of the 1958 horror classic of the same name. It almost tops the original in any way, the film has melodrama mixed with disgustingness and gore added, the make-up effects by Chris Walas are stomach churning for it's time and still are effective especially the vomiting on doughnuts scene. There's terrific acting by the cast, David Cronenberg himself does a excellent cameo in a really horrific nightmare sequence that will have you squirm. This movie isn't for the squeamish but it's a tragic and very interesting movie that will leave you disturbed and it's one of Cronenberg's best.

This 2-Disc DVD has excellent picture and sound with awesome extras like audio commentary, three documentaries, alternate ending, deleted scenes, storyboards, script comparisons, rare test footage, the original short story that started it all, Cronenberg's story rewrite, interactive articles from two magazines, promotional featurettes, still galleries, TV Spots, Trailers and Teasers.

275768,5,6300248135,"It's been over 20 years since this movie was made, but the special effects are still amazing and the story is an entertaining - and disgusting - as ever! I watch it about every 5-7 years. It's utterly fascinating, but it is so uncomfortable to watch at times I always wonder, as I am viewing it, why I put myself through this each time! The original movie, with Vincent Price, is ""dullsville"" compared to this re-make.

Things can get really disgusting as Jeff Goldblum ('Seth Brundle"") slowly turns into a huge fly. The transformation is very gross in certain spots, and certainly gut-wrenching to witness. You can just feel his girlfriend's anguish and horror as she witnesses Goldblums' incredible physical and mental change. Geena Davis gives a convincing performance in that roles as ""Veronica Quiafe.""

The story is not just a dumb horror-creature movie, but an intelligent science fiction tale with both leading actors excellent. I don't Davis ever looked prettier, too. John Getz also is good as her magazine boss, ""Stathis Borans."" Those three characters dominate the film. I can't even remember anyone else in here.

The ending is stunning, almost leaving the first time viewer in shock. In fact, by the end, this movie will have you emotionally worn out.",1189209600,,1265,4.9575471698113205

It rises above the source material in so many ways, and injects alot of Kafka-esque black humor. EVERYONE in this production is at their best.

Not for the squeamish. A couple of truly repulsive makeup effects, here. The arm-wrestling scene still makes me wince.",1187913600,,416,5.0
275770,4,6300248135,"I, like many of the other reviewers, am not a fan of remakes. I mean, how many different ways can you tell a story without eventually corrupting its original intrigue? All too often, the remade product is a watered-down version of the original, barely resembling the initial plot and hardly worth the ridiculous ticket prices or the two hours of viewing time. Then we have the exceptions to the rules, which The Fly (1986) certainly is. This movie is a complete remake in the sense that Cronenberg's screenplay did not attempt to copy any of the elements created by Neumann and Clavell in their 1958 thriller of the same name. Instead, he incorporated 80s era scientific subject matter--DNA recombining, high-tech computers--with a touch of romance and changed the tone of the story but without abandoning the ""don't-try-to-play-God"" theme that made the original worth its salt. Of course, he did have his moment when he included the most famous line from the `58 version--""help me""--into his movie but who could blame him? I said that line for weeks after seeing the original!

The stars of The Fly (1986) help move the plot along at a steady pace and keep you wanting new information. Though the chemistry between the leads is unmistakable, Jeff Goldblum carried this film above and beyond what it should have been and placed it in a category all its own. Just watching him morph into the fly was so intense! His physical contortions, his ticks, his dry sense of humor and his understated demeanor truly outshined the other cast mates.

This flick is one of my favorites, as is the original, or should I say the first version, since The Fly (1986) is a new story all its' own. You'll find nothing water-downed about this film and nothing lacking. Well, almost nothing. I could have used another scene or two with Goldblum's shirt off but hey, that is an entirely different topic!

Enjoy this movie.",1185062400,2,1900,4.804281345565749
275771,5,6300248135,"David Cronenberg's remake of The Fly is one of the incredibly few times a remake tops the original in every way, shape, or form; and remains one of the absolute best films of Cronenberg's career.  Jeff Goldblum stars as a brilliant scientist whose experiment goes awfully awry, and soon enough he is transforming into a an insect-like creature; much to the horror of an investigative journalist (Geena Davis) who he has been romancing, and who is also carrying his child.  Like many of Cronenberg's other films, The Fly is a grisly allegory disguised as a horror film that's hard not to forget.  Goldblum gives what very well may be the best performance of his entire career, and David is excellent as well.  The makeup effects are brilliantly realized as well, with plenty of skin crawling and horiffic moments peppered throughout the film.  This Two-Disc Special Edition features an excellent commentary from Cronenberg, as well as various production diaries as well that are quite insightful.  All in all, The Fly remains one of the best films Cronenberg has ever crafted, and one of the most visionary films to come from the genre as well as one of the few times a remake tops the original in every way, shape, or form.",1183507200,,1223,4.8

said hhhmmm. Have not seen this one in awhile so slapped
it on. This is a remake that is so far supior to the ORIG.
I won't even go there for I will be lynched by every
die hard 50's sci/fi fanatic,which is a good point
is The Fly sci/fi or horror? HORRROR BABY,PURE HORROR
Jeff Goldblum gives his best performance(he was so good

all the same style,he does not go out with friends?
he does not have any friends all he has is his keen

feel for Jeff especially when he is deteriorating

the Oscars did not take notice of his performance

David Cronenberg's ""The Fly""(1986) - is a remake of the 1950s movie of the same title in which a scientist is turned into a half- man, half-fly due to a fatal defect in the matter transmitter. In his remake, Cronenberg piles the eye -popping, jaw-dropping, and stomach-churning effects on the top of each other as the body of the unfortunate, mad but brilliant scientist (Jeff Goldblum in the role of his life -I've never seen him better) is hideously distorted and he is losing his humanity turning into the insect of the title. ""The Fly"" is a truly visceral experience which the director himself sees as a metaphor for aging: ""In time we all turn into monsters"". This very impressive movie is a classic of a ""the fatal error of a mad scientist"" sub-genre, ""Everybody's a mad scientist, and life is their lab. We're all trying to experiment to find a way to live, to solve problems, to fend off madness and chaos"" (David Cronenberg).",1177804800,,965,4.710059171597633
275789,4,6300248135,"Seth Brundle (Goldblum) is a scientist who might just have invented the world's first teleporter. The only bug (pun intended) is the fact that it doesn't handle flesh and live teleportations. Ronnie (Geena Davis) is a writer for Particle magazine and will stay by his side, documenting via video his attempts to break through. Upon successfully teleporting a baboon, Seth gets cocky and decides to try and teleport himself; a fly slips into the pod while he teleports. At first, Seth finds newfound strength and agility, but pretty soon he's changing for the worst.

This is one of Cronenberg's best films, masterfully directed and executed. It's also Jeff Goldblum's finest performance to date! Not content on doing a mere remake (the original Fly (1958) is a much different film starring Vincent Price), Cronenberg brings this film to the next level--literally. It's filled with deep human drama and let's not forget the award-winning special effects! Top notch effects contribute in putting this film ahead of the pack of other mid-eighties sci-fi/horror flicks. The film overall has aged well (it's already been twenty years) if not for the eighties fashion statements.

I'm having a hard time figuring out which it is more; a sci-fi or a horror film? I guess it's a fusion of both (I gotta stop these bad puns!). Whether you see it for the first time or revisit it, Cronenberg's The Fly is a great gory, character-driven, profoundly human film. The second disc is chock full of special features: various documentaries and a making-of, screenplays, the original short story on which the original film is based, trailers for all the Fly movies ever made, deleted scenes, and much much more.

Well, had she known, i'm sure she would not let her 6 year old son watch that flick.  The main thing I remember in this was the guy getting his arm torn off and the baboon getting pulverised.  Those are pretty gross scenes.

However, i did buy this recently, and realized, yes it still is gross, it did not age extremely well.  But, I must say, Jeff Goldblum was pretty good.  He was a bit too quirky at first, but I figured they wanted him to be this geeky guy so that when his fly-like abilities started kicking in, it would show the extreme opposite of what his original character was.  This would also cause sympathy towards the end even though he became, basically a dick by the middle of the movie.  I suggest buying this, especially Cronenberg fans.",1169337600,,920,4.265895953757226

When I first saw it at 12 it was SO scary I could not even watch the final transformation sequence at the end. This is the ONLY horror film which I could not watch from start to finish. Even to this day I never look at flies the same way. I've discovered that I like horror films that are scary enough to get my adrenaline pumping but not enough to make me feel disturbed for a long time afterwards.

The acting is superb, the special effects look real, and the script is good. In fact, if anything it is too perfect because if it wasn't I wouldn't have to take it so seriously! The reason why I'm giving it 5 stars is because, quite frankly, it deserves it as it is a genuine horror movie that does exactly what it sets out to do: scare you and disgust more in 2 hours than what your imagination could do in 2 years.

I'm a bit late in singing the praises of this DVD since it came out last year already but as of late, I've been watching this film a lot because of how well produced this DVD is. They really did a good job with this disc and they finally gave the film the treatment it deserves. The picture is nice and clear and the 5.1 mixes (Dolby Digital and DTS) are pretty sweet. So what that translates to is that what was disgusting before in this film is made to be utterly revolting now. Vomiting never looked and sounded so clear before now, especially as it eats through the flesh of a poor guy's hand and foot!

This disc is loaded with special features and if they release this down the road with more stuff, I won't believe it. You get a Cronenberg commentary which is nice because his commentaries are always an enjoyable and informative listen. There are great featurettes, interesting deleted scenes, scripts, texts, pictures and a fantastic, lengthy making-of documentary which is worth the price of the disc alone. If I had to complain, I would've liked to see something said about Howard Shore's music for the film but they really don't make any mention of it. It's a very minor complaint and nothing that hurts the disc overall.

The Fly is a pretty nasty film and I think on that we can all agree on that. Few movies are as revolting as this one, that's for sure. But underneath the viscera, you have a very intelligent, thoughtful and genuinely moving film that has great performances by Jeff Goldblum in the title role, Geena Davis and John Getz. I really appreciate this film and I'm glad that they took the time to produce this edition to properly compliment it.

275798,3,6300248135,"Alright, it's about time I got around to writing another review that everyone is gonna hate, and where I don't actually say anything.  Good times.

'The Fly' is probably the best known Cronenberg film, but I sure as hell don't think it's the best. (In fact, I think it's the weakest I've seen from him apart from maybe 'Shivers', and that's got its incredibly low budget and Cronenberg's relative lack of experience to excuse many of its problems.  And thinking about it a bit more, I think I probably actually do like 'Shivers' slightly more.)  Basically, it's a character study with dull characters, a monster movie where the monster doesn't do much of anything.  Admittedly, I'm biased as I didn't get around to really watching this film until after Jeff Goldblum had grown unbearable due to his playing the same damn role a couple of time in various summer blockbuster times, but he's still pretty damn annoying no matter how you look at it.  And that's just one of the concerns, though probably the biggest.  It's like this: His transformation into a fly isn't really all that interesting in and of itself, having no real rhyme or reason and neither he nor the Geena Davis character are particularly likable.  So basically, in this movie there's stuff happening up on the screen, but I don't care about it. (And, seriously, there really isn't all that much going on on the screen, at least not 'til the very end.)  And frankly, the fx just isn't very cool.  The problem is conceptual rather than in the execution, meaning that the fx is actually well done, but the designs are stupid enough that it doesn't much matter.  So basically, the monster is kind of lame, and the random gross out moments didn't impress me all that much, for the most part.

Anyway, the film never quite gets boring, but I sat there pretty much the whole time waiting for it to really get good, and it never happened.  It has got it's moments, however.  When the Goldblum character first really starts to transform is pretty amusing, particularly when he goes out to the bar and breaks the dudes arm and steals his woman, as flies are won't to do.  Also, the part where Geena Davis dreams she gives birth to a big maggot is pretty awesome.  But other than that it's just kinda vaguely interesting.  I get the feeling you're supposed to feel sad at the end, but I didn't much care.  Again, I just didn't find Goldblum or Davis to be terribly sympathetic, so who cares what happens to them.

Still worth a rental, I suppose, but my standards are low.  Still, you'd be better off going with 'Videodrome' or 'A History of Violence' or 'Scanners' or 'The Dead Zone' etc.

Grade: C

P.S. David Cronenberg has directed a film named 'The Fly', and a film named 'Spider'. Ha!  That one's also a bit overrated too, I think, by those who have actually seen it i.e. no one.",1145750400,3,2841,4.582178217821782
275799,5,6300248135,"I don't know why but I never was a big fan of David Cronenberg's films. Besides the frequent sex and T&A, I thought Crash was terrible and I never liked History of Violence. The Fly however was a blind buy, one of those frequent mentions on great sci-fi movies so I thought well why not and sure enough I found a great film and a surprisingly emotional one at that. It is sci-fi and it's got great makeup but it's also at times touching and even slightly disturbing.

Seth Brundle is a non-social scientist working on a scientist that in his own words ""will change the world as we know it"". Meeting with reporter Veronica, he shows her his invention: a teleportation device capable of sending objects from one pod to another. The 2 hit it off romantically and the kink the machine has works but one night while drunk and upset, Seth goes into the teleportation pod, unbeknownest a housefly went in with him. Coming out he finds a greater sex drive and athletic ability. But he keeps changing, where he'll become something else entirely.

In probably his best performance so far, certainly his most memorable, Jeff Goldblum is absolutely perfect as the awkward Seth and tragic as the ""Brundlefly"". Geena Davis is well-cast as well and there's not a whole lot of cast members besides certain bit players. The makeup is quite excellent as well being very well-done and grotesque. This is the 80's so it might not have the polish of today but it still comes across anyway.

What's handled remarkably well is that it doesn't just become a monster movie solely. There's regret and angst and it gets into the sadness of turning into a fly, or at least loving someone turning into a fly. The ""insect politics"" scene is a good example of this, as well as the end, which I won't spoil but it's touching and tragic at the same time. Besides the whole head exploding thing, I thought Scanners kind of sucked and besides James Woods, I found Videodrome kind of boring. The Fly however is a director coming into his own. Kind of like Peter Jackson doing Heavenly Creatures after a series of gory films.

It's certainly one of the better films of the 80's, Cronenberg's best and a sci-fi classic so there's not a whole lot of reasons left to persuade you to buy this.",1145404800,7,2252,4.566831683168317
275800,4,6300248135,"There's a fascinating film on this DVD, and it's not necessarily the popular David Cronenberg gross-out pic from the mid-'80s. David Pryor's smart and emotional DVD docu takes almost three hours to cover the story of a ""horrible mess"" of a project that resulted in one of the decade's top films. Pryor had plenty to work with: the tangled tale of the script; Mel Brooks' role as horror producer; the sudden death of the original director's daughter; the wooing of Cronenberg; the real-life romance of stars Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis; and Goldblum's miseries inside the rotting human-fly getup.

Cronenberg provides thoughtful and easygoing commentary. Revisiting the film, he was ""really struck by how disturbing and emotional"" it remains. He and other principals on the project see it as a love story, not straight horror. Cronenberg's  direction of the film was partly a reaction to the death of his father, to cancer.

""The Fly"" DVD really takes off on disc 2, packed with imaginative and interactive extras. Among the many highlights is the reconstruction of the notorious cat-monkey fusion scene, deleted as too sickening. Cronenberg's script and the original ""Fly"" short story are included.

The video is first-rate despite a few dropouts: Colors on the blood and guts look nicely saturated. Images are 1.85:1, as shot. The sound gets an upgrade from the previous DVD with the addition of DTS. Audio is mostly solid but stressed at peaks.",1133136000,6,1448,5.071428571428571
275801,5,6300248135,"The Fly is a classic movie, a one of a kind gem that you rarely come across. It is Croenberg's piece of genius. To tell you the truth, I wasn't looking forward to seeing it. I thought it would be cheesy and not scary at all. Well, it's not cheesy and isn't scary. So, the horror section label doesn't give it that much justice. Yet, it is more a horror movie than anything else. The fact that it isn't scary doesn't take away from the movie whatsoever.

The movie has a nerdy scientist (Jeff Goldblum) trying to impress a reporter (Geena Davis) by showing his new invention. This invention is rather incredible. He has managed to teleport things from one probe ot another. He is now trying to do the same thing with animals and maybe even humans. They both fall in love and become partners as well as lovers. But the scientist tries to go through the teleportation process. It would have worked but a fly went in with him. At first, nothing's wrong. On the contrary, he thinks that he has know obtained super abilities from it. Until he starts changing and goes insane.

The development of the scientist is trully brilliantly executed. He is having a good time with his abilities..maybe too good a time. But then he becomes depressed, obsessive and crazy. Jeff Goldblum gives a riveting performance..his best. He plays the role with extreme perfection.

Geena Davis also does a nice job. Their relationship is excellently portrayed and shows how much they care for each other. And in the end, this allows the movie to be sad and tragic.

The makeup gets an A for effort and brilliance. For 1986, this is trully amazing how they show the different stages of the scientist's transformation. And in the end, his fully transformed body is excellently made. Awesome.

Now to my favorite aspect of the movie: the score. Trully brilliant and very powerful..it sets the mood for the movie and is what changes one scene to the next.

275802,4,6300248135,"Remakes and sequels are mostly blatant attempts to cash in at the box office. Few ever repeat the original thrills. Oddly, a very few, such as ""The Godfather, Part II"" and Philip Kaufman's remake of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" are better than the originals. Canadian director David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of the cheapo 1950s horror film ""The Fly"" is now another. Although it isn't the ""masterpiece"" its makers and some critics claim, it surpasses the first film in its science, story plotting, social commentary and sheer moviemaking skill (see the director's 2005 ""A History of Violence"" for evidence of that.)

Jeff Goldblum, who also was in the ""Body Snatchers"" remake, plays a nerdy scientist and Geena Davis a reporter who is chronicling his ""telepod"" experiment, one which will change world transportation forever. The actors, who were dating at the time, have real screen chemistry. Their emotional bond is both terrifying and touching when his experiment goes grimly awry. The pre-CGI special effects are truly special, and the tinkering with human genetics is weirdly current.

The new Collector's Edition DVD is well worth upgrading from the original DVD.

It includes a well produced 2.5 hour long documentary similar to those found on the Alien and Gladiator DVDs. In addition to that documentary there is another on the films special effects.

There are numerous Deleted Scenes, Film Tests, Movie Articles with interactive pictures and video, Theatrical Trailers, TV Spots, Original Making of Featurette and more.

And probably the best of all, A new Director Commentary from David Croneberg.

275804,5,6300248135,"Arguably David Cronenberg's magnum opus, 1986's THE FLY is a remake of the classic 1958 Vincent Price vehicle that updates the story to reflect current advances in genetics, chemistry, and computer technology.  So the story of a physicist who is merged with a common housefly is more scientifically plausible, but that's really not Cronenberg's motivation for shooting this remake.  In most of his films, Cronenberg shows a fascination with psychological metamorphosis, especially that of an individual who makes a 360-degree change, and THE FLY is no exception.  Here, Cronenberg concentrates on the changes--physical, to be sure, but more importantly the intellectual and emotional--that a hapless scientist suffers as insect DNA slowly encroaches upon his human identity.

Cronenberg's film has often been likened to Kafka's THE METAMORPHOSIS, a story in which a man changes into a cockroach.  In some ways the two are similar, but whereas Kafka's tale is a satirical metaphor of individuals who sacrifice their identity and independence for the sake of their family or for the good of society, Cronenberg's opus is instead an allegory that reflects the effects, both personal and social, a debilitating or fatal disease.  For this reason, the film is more raw and primal, exploiting the common human fears of incurable illness, aging, and other physical malfunctions.  And as fans of the director's signature already know, Cronenberg underscores his message with plenty of gallows humor and lots of well-executed and gory FX.

The acting in THE FLY is also top-notch and helps to keep the audience engaged in Cronenberg's study of disease-induced decay.  Jeff Goldblum delivers an excellent performance as nerdy Seth Brundle, the unfortunate morphing scientist, and Geena Davis runs the gamut of human emotions portraying Brundle's journalist girlfriend, who watches helplessly as her boyfriend literally goes buggy.  John Getz also does a great turn as Davis' smarmy editor and former lover.

The new two-disc DVD from Fox is much better than the previous digital release.  The digital transfer is cleaner and crisper, primarily due to a higher bit rate, and a commentary by director Cronenberg himself is included.  While it does not come paired with the Chris Walas-directed sequel as it did before, it does come with a second disc that is chockfull of cool extras, including some deleted and extended scenes, an alternate ending (actually a coda of sorts that, fortunately, was dumped during the post-production process), and a few interesting documentaries.  Very much worth the price of admission, even if you already have the earlier double-feature disc in your collection.",1128470400,4,2684,5.359523809523809

- Seth Brundle tells girlfriend Veronica Quaife to bug off, for her own good, as he slowly loses his remaining humanity & embraces his darker side, mutating into ""The Fly""

David Cronenberg's classic 1986 remake to the 1958 Vincent Price classic, ""The Fly"", has been re-released by ""20th Century Fox"", in a 2 disc edition that is easily the definitive edition of the remake to ""The Fly"". This is one must own disc.

""What am I working on? Uh..., I'm working on something that will change the world & human life as we know it.""

""I have a feeling you don't get out much.""

""You can tell that?""

""yeah.""

""Your making a mistake. I think you want to talk to me.""

""Sorry, but, I have three more interviews before the end of this party.""

""It's something that will change the course of humanity & the world as we know it.""

""They all say that.""

""Yeah, but, they're lying. I'm not.""

After meeting him at a recent science expo/convention, reporter Veronica Quaife decides to take scientist Seth Brundle up on his offer - to show her his invention that will change the course of humanity. Upon arrival at his lab, Brundle shows Veronica his invention - a teleporter that can transport objects from one place to the other in a matter of seconds. Their is a catch, however:

  ""I can only teleport inanimate objects.""

  ""Well, what happens when you teleport living things?""

  ""Not while we're eating.""

Seth convinces Veronica not to do an article for the magazine she works for (headed by her ex-beau Stathis Borans), but, instead, write a book about the whole experiment from the early stages to the present. With a current breakthrough, thanks to Veronica, Brundle ""teaches"" the teleporter to understand the complexties of living tissue. Also, a strong romance blossoms between the two.

When the breakthrough that Seth needs happens (a successful teleportation of a living animal (in this case a baboon)) it's time to celebrate.

But, not if Stathis Barons has anything to say about it. Veronica finds a portfolio with sketches of cover artwork from her magazine with Seth & the teleporter on them. Veronica thinks that Stathis is trying to get back into her good graces & calls off the celebration to deal with Stathis once & for all. Stathis tells Veronica that he did some background checking on Brundle & decided to give him a choice article in an upcoming issue. Basically, if the only way of keeping Veronica in his life is to work with her on a professional basis, then that's what he will do.

Seth, celebrating on his own by doing champagne shots, gets a little jealous, as he gets wise to Veronica's romantic past with Stathis.

""From ""the desk of Stathis Borans""..., How about ""under the desk of Stathis Borans?""

Totally inebriated, Seth apoligizes to his baboon subject for destroying his brother in an earlier experiment & then, recklessly, decides to take the final test - human teleportation, with him as the subject. The experiment is a success - at first...

Over the next few days Veronica notices a rapid change in Seth. He gains superhuman like strength, with an increase in his sex drive. Also, odd prickly, hairs start to grow from a cut on his back. Veronica gets a sample & has them analyzed, with the results being that the hairs are insectoid in nature. Short tempered & hyperactively skittish, Seth has Veronica thrown out of his lab & has the book deal terminated. The honeymoon is over.

""There was an old lady who swallowed a fly, perhaps she'll die.""

Seth does some further investigation of his own &, to his horror, finds out that he wasn't alone in the transmitter pod during the teleportation. A common housefly had made its way in & got trapped inside the pod with him.

""The computer got confused... -there wasn't supposed to be two seperate genetic patterns - & it decided to..., uhh... splice us together. It mated us, me & the fly. We hadn't even been properly introduced.""

Seth's body gruesomely deteriates & mutates, as he tries to figure out a cure for his cancer before he loses all senses of his humanity & mutates into a monsterous half-breed between Brundle & fly.

The 1986 remake of ""The Fly"" is one of those very rare remakes that does the impossible. It surpasses & outdoes it's original.

Cronenberg does a great job at directing & this is, argueably, his best film to date. Goldblum, Davis, & John Getz give great performances with Goldblum being the stand-out. Almost anybody can wear the makeup, but, with those fly-like twitches, & the aches & pains of mutation, Goldblum gives ""The Fly"" its much needed buzz.

The score is written & composed by Howard Shore & I consider it to be one of the London Symphony Orchestra's underated performances (the Orchestra also performed with John Williams on ""Star Wars"", ""Jaws"", ""Superman"", & ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"").

Mel Brooks' movie studio ""Brooksfilms"" was the major backer on the film, with ""Fox"".

David Cronenberg was the first choice for director on the project, but, was unavailable at the time trying his hand at directing ""Total Recall"" for Dino DeLaurentis.

Robert Bierman was then hired for directing chores. But, when a horrific family tragedy called him back home, Bierman backed out of the film & with Cronenberg having problems of his own with DeLaurentis, Cronenberg easily slid into the director's saddle on ""The Fly"". It's been 20 years since ""The Fly"" went into production &, to this day, Bierman has yet to see the film (he's reminded too much of his daughter's death & the circumstances surrounding it, including this film & his association with it).

After an extensive Cronenberg rewrite of Charles Edward Pogue's screenplay, Jeff Goldblum was hired to portray the doomed scientist. Goldblum was dating Geena Davis at the time & she auditioned for the role of Veronica. She was the first one to audition & the producer's sized up her audition with the other actresses who tried out & no one could beat her. She got the role unanimously.

Makeup effects master, Chris Walas started make-up preparations for ""The Fly"" when he got a call from Steven Spielberg to work on ""Gremlins 2"". Walas politely declined & his reward was an Oscar in make-up effects for ""The Fly"" (although, I'm not too sure if Walas & Spielberg have ever worked together again on any other project).

The opening title shot with the fluttering of green wings that changed into the film's title was actually taken from the coming attractions trailer to the film, after Cronenberg saw it & liked it so much that he used for the opening title shot.

The film opened on August 15th 1986. Total box office gross was roughly 40 million dollars (""The Fly"" was released the same weekend as ""Manhunter"" (the Hannibal Lecter film).

Audience reaction was mostly the same. Gross! ""People"" magazine dubbed ""The Fly"" as the gross-out movie of the year. I saw ""The Fly"" on opening weekend & people were so grossed out. Especially, the scene when Brundle lends an ear to Veronica, & in return she hugs him on the same side! It was the exact same reaction that Geena Davis describes in the documentary. People were so grossed out that you couldn't here the next three lines of the film. I think one lady left when Brundle-fly finally transforms into the space bug at the end of the film.

This new 2 disc DVD edition is awesome. In a world where movie studios take their old films & practically hurl them onto DVD, not caring about quality & prosperity, film wise, it's nice to see a release like this.

Disc 1 to ""The Fly"" has the film in the widescreen format with Dolby Digital 5.1 & DTS 5.1 (yes!), with a director's commentary by Cronenberg.

Disc 2 has the three production documentaries that can be watched seperatley or viewed in a branching version (easter egg #1: using your DVD remote go to the documentary main page. Highlight the word ""Play All"" at the top & then hit left. If done correctly a green fly should appear. hit play/enter & Jeff Goldblum reveals how he feels he was destined to play the lead role in ""The Fly"". One word describes the whole moment - ""Halloweeners""! Absolutley, hilariously, bizarre & only Goldblum could tell it).

""The Brundle Museum of Natural History"" featurette has Chris Walas showing all of the props & clay maquettes used for the film.

Deleted scenes consists of the infamous & gruesome ""Monkey-Cat"" sequence (easter egg #2: using your DVD remote highlight the ""Monkey-Cat"" sequence entry on the deleted scenes menu, but, don't hit enter. Instead go left. If properly done a green fly will appear. Hit enter & you will see the original video of Brundle-fly demonstrating how his vomit-drop is used. This is the same video Stathis watches at Veronica's apartment), a scripted, but not filmed, scene where Brundle-fly attacks a bag lady using his vomit-drop, & alternate endings with Veronica having a dream of a butterfly baby.

There is also test makeup footage, George Langdon's original short story, with tha film's two screenplays by Pogue & Cronenberg.

The set is rounded out with the usual trailers (easter egg #3: again, highlight ""Play All"" & go left with your remote. Hit play/enter & the disc takes you to a trailer menu of the three movies that were released in the summer of 1986 from ""Fox"": ""Big Trouble In Little China"", ""Aliens"" (woo-hoo!) & ""The Fly"" (duh!). This egg was also used for the 2 disc S.E. version of ""China"" a few years back), still galleries, 2 FX articles & advertising from around the world.

This DVD re-release of ""The Fly"" is worth catching. Fly strip optional.",1128297600,23,9657,4.7321002386634845

Before that there's an intrigueing love-triangle set up and your usual jealousy, stalking, and going to the ex-boyfriend for help.  Seth could've been experimenting with a new hangliding system and gotten bit by a desert rat and slowly decayed, Davis losing the man she loves.  Instead it's sci-fi, which opens the door to more gut-wrenching moments like in the last fifteen minutes.

Which is where the core of the screenplay steps in.  The ending is so barbarically violent, that one can't help feel emotion and be stunned into silence.  By the fade you will definitely do a big exhale and ""Hoo boy, what a ride"".  But as someone once said, ""Pain equals emotion.""  And, boy, does it ever in the final section of this film.

275807,4,6300248135,"Based loosely on a 1950s sci-fi film of the same name, ""The Fly"", is a well paced film that emphasizes character development. The background of the principle characters adds a richness to this film. Like we know them, and should pray for thier survival. As unlikely as the story is, our dis-belief is suspended, thus sending us to the underworld of science, where mistakes remain undisclosed.

The plot is simple enough. A well known scientist toys with the idea of molecular transportation, inwhere NO errors can be made. The slightest mistake will prove lethal to the test animals, or change them into something the world has never seen before. (Ah! So that's what happened to Stephen Hawking!)

By credo, Researchers are not to use themselves as subjects, because in so doing, objectivity is cast to the wayside. Scientists are like any one else: they want to be right.

A Scientific accident occurs and sets forth a most hideous result, as the Researcher takes on the form of a severe lepor. His girlfriend tapes some of the transistion, but clearly becomes ambivalent towards re-entering the nightmarish truth she can see evolving right in front of her. She begins to fear the possibility she's also infected, and begs for her life.

One body part after another drops away from his form. Where are his features?

Overview: very impressive special effects considering the film is 20 years old. Great casting! Creepy music! Terrifying in much the same way as ""The Exorcist"".

And you have fallen in love with him, while seeing him slowly mutate into a fly, such as losing his teeth and nails and climbing the walls.

This is the jist of this story for poor Geena Davis whom plays this writer, and David Goldblum plays excellently the unfortunate man who morphs into the fly.

Jeff Goldblum is a scientist called Seth Brundle, living in a condo. But when he is working on a teleporting experiment, he accidently merges with a housefly. Geena Davis is Veronica, she has fallen in love with him, and has yet to know that he is transforming. Soon, Seth starts to get bad skin, his nails start to fall of, and he begins to get stronger, and Veronica expects something is wrong.

She tries to get the help of her ex-boyfreind (John Getz) and stop Seth for good.
This is a gory film, with a sickening ending and lots of disturbing scenes, but it can also really touch you, you can see how much pain Seth and Veronica are going through in the movie.

But this remake was so much better than the original and the acting was so much better that I had no choice but to give this film five stars. But I have to say that after the first time I have seen this film, I was literlly sick to my stomach, but that only goes to show you that the make-up was that amazing. I am not a fan of Jeff Goldblum's, basically because most of the time his acting is kind of dry and dull, even though he can play a pretty good ""brainy"" character, but I really liked him in this film. Yeah is playing a somewhat dull-brainy-dry part, but he doesn't play it dry.
  Jeff Goldblum is in the role of Seth Brundle, a scientist who does his experimentations with these two tripods. The process is to put one thing into one tripod and put something else into the other and the two objects or animals transport to the opposite tripod. One night, while doing the experiment on himself, a fly became trapped in the tripod Seth was in. The fly's DNA had mixed with Seth's causing him to become part human, part fly. Geena Davis plays Veronica ""Ronnie"", Seth's girlfriend. She begins to witness Seth's gruesome transformation. Then, Ronnie reveals to ex-boyrfriend, Stathis Borans (played by John Getz), that she is pregnant with Seth's child. She decides to go tell Seth, but by then, Seth is in one stage away from becoming a complete human-fly being. She goes in and has a talk with Seth, but after seeing what Seth has become, she decides not to say anything about the baby to Seth. Instead, she finishes the conversation with Seth and runs out to tell Stathis that she wants an abortion. Seth, hearing this from the roof, builds a third tripod and kidnaps Ronnie. With the third tripod, he can put Ronnie in the first, himself in the second, and then Seth, Ronnie, and their unborn child will come out of the third as one. Ronnie wants no parts of it and that is when Seth transforms one last time into the most horrifying, but most disgusting creature this world has ever seen, which leads to a heartbreaking conclusion that will leave you breathless, and also have grabbing a bottle of pepto.
  Yes, this film is very gruesome, but I really enjoyed it. The acting was unbelievable, the make-up was incredible. What's not to like? The movie even won an Oscar for Outstanding Make-Up Effects. Watch this film and I guarantee that you will enjoy it.",1081987200,2,2421,4.470588235294118

I like how director David Cronenberg combined a tragic love story with the sci-fi/horror story. The love story gave the film an extra layer of depth that you wouldn't expect from a horror flick. This is one of the few horror films I've seen that is emotionally moving. ""Poltergeist"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" are other examples. Goldblum gives his character, Seth Brundle, so much humor and pathos that we still care about him even when he transforms slowly into another being.

I watched the classic original on tv when I was a mere tadpole, and for the next ten years my brother could have me in tears with the mere words ""Heeeeeeelp meeeeeee!"" Sure, it was a bit corny in the special effects, but it had real horror, real relationships, real reactions. This remake, on the other hand, goes all out in the gross department, mostly centered around the Fly's regurgitating on various proteins so he can then consume them and various bits of his body dropping off at inopportune moments. They aren't so much horrifying as they are nauseating, but that's not the real failure here. The real failure is in the lack of any sincerity in the relationships that are portrayed in the film.
For some odd reason, they tried to make this a love story. Well, they failed there as well, because there are no real reactions here. The scene that best sums up the improbability factor is one in which Davis's character gets her first real look at the transitionary monster Goldblum's character has turned into. Upon tenderly reaching up to cradle his face in her hand, she winds up with his ear in her palm. With lukewarm reaction to this rather shocking event, she then goes on to press her cheek to the space where the ear had been. Now I know what it is to love someone, and if my husband's ear popped off in my hand, I would likely not go screaming into the street, but you can bet I'd drop that sucker and perform the dance of ""ew ew ew"" to the other side of the room, and I certainly wouldn't go nuzzling the spot where it had been two minutes later. My suspension of disbelief only goes so far. I really cannot buy the relationship I'm handed without seeing this woman popping two handfuls of valium before she heads in to check on her boyfriend. Everyone here seems to have such subdued reactions that drugs are the only plausible explanation.
This film falls far short of a true horror story, and even farther short of a love story. Give it a miss and watch the original instead. The corniness of a bygone era is much more acceptible and less likely to leave you whimpering ""Heeeeeelp meeeee!""",1030752000,17,2151,4.475826972010178

275836,4,6300248135,"Even if this film is a remake, it is a masterpiece. The main theme is that of the extreme dangers of science, which is in the line of many films by David Cronenberg. The stakes are high : teleportation. Such an invention would make all means of transportation obsolete, hence transform our life completely. The scientist in the film is finally coming to the possibility to teletransport living organisms. So he tries it on himself.
But , and this is the second theme, computers are not intelligent, which means they can only solve the tasks they are proposed with the instructions they have received. Here the computer has the mission to teletransport what is in one  pod  to the second  pod , which it does. The accident is that the hero enters the first  pod  along with a fly. Never has the computer been told to differentiate the two organisms, which it does automatically since it analyzes what it has to teletransport, but it has not been told to keep the two organisms apart, so it teletransports the whole load (man + fly) as one unique load and it decides, on its own, to fuse them into one single organism and hence to integrate to DNA and all genetic elements of both organisms into one. It fuses the DNA of the fly into the DNA of the man. The point is that the fly is an insect, hence it is a lot more powerful than the man : insects have a DNA that make them able to survive in extreme conditions. So the fused being sees the DNA of the fly take over the DNA of the man. The man becomes a fly. ...
This film was made before our ability to clone living organisms but it deals with the same problem : science, when it tampers with  natural  processes, can produce monsters. What is our responsibility in front of that ? Forbid scientific experimentation, which is impossible because too many interests are at stake ? Impose strict procedures, which is very difficult too because some scientists work in isolated conditions, and some of those strict procedures might make some experimentations impossible, and science is by definition always going beyond limits ? We are doomed to produce monsters and monstrous beings and scenarios. There is no protection against that. That is the lesson that comes out of the film : kill such monsters, kill such beings and destroy such scenarios. But do we have the right to do this ? Can we in any way stop scientific work and progress in the name of a norm that is supposed to be either natural or divine ? The film evades the religious approach, but it is always at the back of our consciousness.

275837,5,6300248135,"I saw this movie and was creeped out the whole time. The first half shows how Seth Brundle is a sweet, loving person. But in the second half, he becomes obsessed with turning into a fly.  In the beginning, we are at a party and Seth is chatting with Veronica, a reporter for PARTICLE, a science magazine. She tells him that she wants to do a story on this thing that will change the world for the better. She goes and sees that he has built a telepod machine that tears down matter, and then rebuilds it. She decides to write a book about the whole thing.  As she is starting to get romantically involved with Seth, he is fixing the machines so that it can transport animate objects. He succeeds in doing so, and he tests it out. But there is a problem: a fly goes into the pod with him and there is no way that he can get out. But of course he doesn't know a thing about it. When he comes out, he feels like a million bucks. Then he begins to do excercises that he never did before, like doing push-ups while in a hand stand! But soon Veronica starts to notice that he is acting odd, having the will to have sex for hours at a time, and eating a huge amount of sugar. And he is also starting to grow hairs that are analyzed as insect hair. He begins to be frightened as he is gradually going hideous. Veronica cannot help him because she doesn't know what is happening. Seth looks up what happened when he went through, and he sees that a fly and his DNA got joined to form one. He then knows that he will turn into a FLY! He then looks on the bright side, maybe he can become a politician. But then Veronica finds out a terrifying fact. But to find out, you have to rent the movie or buy it. It is worth it, unless you are not into that really gross stuff that some people like. Check out the original version of the FLY. They are both well made and thought up. Get them both so that you can compare the two. You will be pleasantly surprised to find out that the only similarity is that the man teleports himself and a fly. There are two completely different plots. And both are very sad, including the later version. The special effects are much better in this version because they had more money and the right equiptment. Check out the final product of the BrundleFly, it is pretty cool.",983664000,,2291,4.180995475113122
275860,2,6300248135,"The original was OK, but this was a disaster!  Jeff Goldblum, as usual, plays a very boring scientist who invents a matter transformation device that gets his DNA mixed up with a fly's, that's pretty much all there is to it, nothing else happens except his girlfriend decides she wants an abortion.  The SFX were fake and unbeliveable and unlike other people I never felt sick to my stomach once in this movie except twards the acting.  See the original, this one is not worth supporting.",972777600,4,488,4.651162790697675
275861,4,6300248135,"The Fly is a 1986 re-make of the 1958 Sci-Fi/Horror classic of the same name. It's better and more enjoyable than the original and is an impressive film made way back in 1986. The story is fairly simple. Seth Brundle is a Scientist who is working on the ""Greatest Invention In The History Of Mankind"". It's a teleprotation device that can easily and instantly take you to wherever you wanted without having to take a Cab, Plane, Helicopter, and so on. He tests it on a few objects (a meat steak and stocking) and they work fine. However, when he tries it on a Baboon, things turn a little ""Inside Out"". He tests it on himself and it works perfectly. So he thinks, because a common HouseFly very stealhly snuck  in the pod with him and merged it's DNA with Brundle's.  The result: Half-Man, Half-Fly, Total Terror. Brundle soon transforms into the monsterous BrundleFly. For a re-make this is pretty damn good. It packs terrific special F/X and they won an Oscar. They deserve every once of that Oscar. The frightening BrundleFly, acidic Fly Vomit, burnt body  parts, disappearing bodies. The acting is also great. Goldblum delivers what is quite possibly his best performance in his career (next to his role in the original Jurassic Park). Cronenberg's direction is very top-notch as well. The music is also superb and the cinematography is wonderful and downright mind-blowing. The best part of The Fly is easily the intense finale. I won't spoil it for you, but it'll scare you stiff. This is all in all a superb re-make of a good film that's better and more enjoyable. I would've given it five stars if it moved at a faster and better pace and the ending wasn't so inconclusive. Check it out when you get the chance (but DON'T watch the TV-ized version).
The DVD is VERY bare-boned though. All there is is a Theatrical Trailer, a few production notes, and that's pretty much it. However, it does have a very crisp picture and excellent sound.

275863,3,6300248135,"Creepy film from David Cronenberg, who has made a specialty of creepy films (Dead Ringers, Scanners, Existenz). Jeff Goldblum stars as Seth Brundle, a scientist who is mastering teleportation, but who accidentally  crosses his genetic code with a housefly's, creating a terrifying hybrid.  Geena Davis plays a reporter who is slowly falling for Goldblum, her  subject.
This is Goldblum's best performance of his career. An actor who  often seems laid-back, Goldblum here is anything but. His intensity shows  as a man who undergoes a terrifying transformation into a disgusting  creature. His anger and frustration cross with his scientific visions, and  he thus creates a very sympathetic character. Additionally, the makeup  artists created truly amazing effects and deserve every ounce of the Oscar  that they won.
That being said, it is unfortunate that the script is  obvious and by-the-numbers. You can see the resolution coming a mile away.  It feels like most of the energy in this film went into the effects and  technology, instead of the script.",963878400,6,1056,5.25748502994012
275864,2,6300248135,"This could have been a good movie. Unfortunately, it exemplifies in my mind the trend toward the disgusting in contemporary American films. There is genuine chemistry between the two main characters, but the reliance on  gross special effects undermines the movie",962755200,5,263,5.414634146341464
275865,4,6300248135,"A skillful remake of the Vincent Price classic, with its simple story line essentially intact, Cronenberg's Fly is both emotionally involving and literally repulsive.  Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis exude a real chemistry,  which goes a long way in evoking sympathy from us as the viewer.  Goldblum's repugnant transformation has that car-wreck quality to it; it is  both stomach-turning and fascinating at the same time.  I found the last  third of the film to be over-the-top in a way the film avoids for its first  half, which is unfortunate.  There is obvious skill, care and attention to  detail in virtually every frame of this movie, and it is difficult not to  appreciate.  Too, it engenders a deep sadness, even while you might want to  throw up.",959126400,,754,4.896825396825397

Cronenbergs remake of THE FLY is brilliant (and in my view the only good cronenberg film). Jeff Goldblum plays Seth Brundle who's  life falls to pieces (literally) after experimenting on himself. Brilliant  make up effects and very gory I recommend to people with a strong stomach.  I'd advise your not eating dohnuts when watching this film!",948844800,,436,4.945205479452055
275869,4,6300248135,"The Fly is loosely based on a short story by George Langelaan. Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is working on a matter transmission device. If his work succeeds, it will revolutionize the transport industry and change the  world forever. He has already succeeded in transporting inorganic objects  and he has ironed out the glitches with organic matter. Now he can test the  machine on himself. Unfortunately, Seth failed to notice the fly that was  in the machine with him...
After the experiment, Seth undergoes a  gruesome change. The DNA of the fly has become mixed with his own, causing  him to slowly  mutate into something almost too horrible to describe. He  gains all the charateristics of a fly: tremendous strength, ability to  climb walls, and an insatiable craving for sugar. Seth's girlfriend (Geena  Davis) can only watch in horror as he becomes a hideous monstrosity.
Not  only is this film nauseating and graphic, there is  a sense of tragedy too.  If Seth's excitement had not got the better of him, he should have thought  of giving his machine a fail-safe mechanism, so that the machine would not  work if more than one creature was in the booth. You wonder how long the  creature Seth became would have lived for. Flies only live for a few days,  so maybe this creature would have had a short lifespan, which would make  its misery mercifully brief.
I think some of the effects were  unnecessarily over the top, but it's a clever story. It's a good idea not  to be eating while you watch this film.",947116800,,1515,4.731800766283525
