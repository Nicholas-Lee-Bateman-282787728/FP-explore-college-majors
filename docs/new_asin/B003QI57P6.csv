8402324,4,B003QI57P6,"An evil stepmother turns eleven princes into swans, and their sister rushes to rescue her dear brothers in this film based on Andersen's fairy tale.

Made in Tallinn (Estonia - USSR) in 1988, the film was remastered for this DVD release.

Its runtime is 102 minutes. It's a fun film to watch for those who are fluent in Russian or are learning Russian language. The audio track is Russian. But there are English and Russian subtitles.",1368921600,,434,4.697368421052632
