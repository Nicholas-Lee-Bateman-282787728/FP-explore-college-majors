8021410,5,B00023JD2G,"very well explain and works great if you want a one on one session with the instructor and don't have one close, Its easy to follow. I have taught martial arts for over 30 plus years and i buy videos to get new ideas on teaching as well as a way to study motion. Great Job !",1376784000,9,274,3.824561403508772
8021411,4,B00023JD2G,"This DVD is authentic Shaolin Gong Fu. I can attest to that. With the dearth of
authentic Shaolin and Ba Gua Zhang DVDs on the market this DVD is a necessity.
The teacher is a superior martial artist as evidenced by his other DVD clips on
YouTube. This DVD is a must have for a martial artist.",1282608000,16,293,4.157894736842105
8021412,5,B00023JD2G,"The White Crane is a southern chinese kung fu style, and Dr. Yang's presentation sets the standard. As the Long Fist style forms a backbone for many northern chinese arts, so the White Crane style is a parent art from which many southern styles developed (including Wing Chun, Japanese and Okinawan Karate and  famous family styles like Hung Gar, Choy Li Fut, etc.) so it is worth studying.

Included are sections on basic training (drills that break down the standard stances and techniques into simple easy to understand movements) and application drills (chi sao or sensing drills). The large number of practical applications derived from these basics is simply amazing.

This is mainly a reference material, as Books and DVDs do not make good primary instructional material for martial arts, so plan on attending a seminar or finding a good local school to get the most from this DVD.",1105056000,36,888,4.946308724832215
