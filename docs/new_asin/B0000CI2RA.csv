7999490,4,B0000CI2RA,"This film is a slice of life picture of an average Bolivian curandero. As the other review mentions, it may not be stunning cinematography, or full of scenes of fascinating rituals. But as a student of the shamanic cultures of this region, I found it had a lot to offer. Among the things I found interesting was the herb identifications, the demonstration of the use of guinea pigs in diagnosis, and the scenes of festival celebrations. While this movie isn't going to knock your socks off, it deserves 4 stars and I hope more film makers will be inspired to produce documentaries like this one.",1163203200,5,595,4.6761904761904765
7999491,2,B0000CI2RA,"(if i was to give it another rating it would be 1 star)...bad photoquality, bad quality all the way.  if you have serious interest i shamanism steer clear! it could have been cut down to about 15-20 minutes of useful information, but the quality of the pictures is totally crap - amateurish! the shaman in this documentary is fine enough, but doesn`t give the impression of being of the most advanced (not the one you travel half the world to see in person). sympathic and straightforward, honest..but more a traditional curer/curandero. this movie gives nothing to the ones interested in the study of consciousness. very disappointing!  made of and for people with little knowledge and interest i shamanism.",1134777600,3,708,4.991525423728813
