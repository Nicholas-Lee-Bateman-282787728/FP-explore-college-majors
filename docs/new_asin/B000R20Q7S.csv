8198376,4,B000R20Q7S,"Season 2 is definitely better than season 1. The mini-series of ""Done to Death"" murder mystery was pretty funny. There were more skits in season 2 as well compared to season 1. They seemed to learn from season 1 and greatly improved the shows content.",1430265600,,251,4.6
8198377,5,B000R20Q7S,"Series Two, that's Season Two to North America, keeps the fabulous Ronnies paired up for action, well, comedic action, laughs, laughs and more laughs.

Barker and Corbett are unlikely buds just looking at then, but buds they are.  It's way to see the friendship as they work.  The ""together"" part always seems genuine.  Both actors are gifted comedians.

The Two Ronnies was always a part of my viewing when I lived in the UK.",1423872000,,426,4.702702702702703
8198378,5,B000R20Q7S,"I love this show very funny. The box came a little cracked but apart from that the item & discs were fine & worked great . The packaging the DVD came in was packaged very well compared to others I have received. You can't play these discs on a USA DVD player, you can however play them on your computer though. I would def recommend this item.",1390348800,,343,4.134328358208955
