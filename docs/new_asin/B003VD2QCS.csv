8406675,5,B003VD2QCS,The original Van Wilder is totally hilarious...and VERY off color!  Guess that's what makes it fun.,1521158400,,99,5.1875
8406676,5,B003VD2QCS,"Van Wilder is one of those films that I rarely admit to enjoying. Although its humor could be considered juvenile, I don't care. It is disgusting in some areas, but I enjoy Ryan Reynolds so much that I don't care. Don't expect rocket science, but enjoy this for what it is: silly, dirty fun.",1518393600,,291,4.407407407407407
