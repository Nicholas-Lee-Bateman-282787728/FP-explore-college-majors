8088093,5,B000BKSJD4,"Basically I ran across one volume at the library, and loved it enough to buy the set.  I have been extremely pleased.  So much so that I am also ordering the second season.  The only drawback to the series is the language, which at times gets a bit profane, but fortunately only on the lesser curse words.  No truly foul and maloderous language.  A very funny story of the chaotic adventures of the rebelious daughter of a police family who always ends up being good, even if she has to be bribed on occasion to do so.",1188259200,,518,4.298969072164948
8088094,4,B000BKSJD4,"I adore this anime, it's funny, smart and just so cute.  The dub is also excellent with great voice actors like Luci Christian and Chris Patton(both from FMP.  The whole Shibuya scene is quite realistic.  I know since I've been there. Ran, Miyu, and Aya are just so spunky and funny.  I can't wait for the next season.",1160611200,2,318,4.431034482758621
8088095,3,B000BKSJD4,"While the show is just GREAT ( I<3 Japanese gals or ""gyaru""...), they cut the special features!  Wah???  Part of the delight of this seires was ADV's ""Super Gals Explain it All!""  I miss!

Also, we STILL don't have ALL the eps in America.  Oh well, this is the cheapest, most complete, leagal collection you're gonna find in America.",1146182400,4,333,4.576271186440678
8088096,5,B000BKSJD4,"This is a GREAT series, with fun visuals, memorable characters and high entertainment value. It offers a look at certain aspects of modern Japanese life which are not often talked about, which alone makes it a must for both anime fans and Japanophiles in general...and the ongoing conflict between World's Greatest Gal Ran Kotobuki and her arch-rival Mami Honda is classic. Video quality is excellent, which is an iron-clad rule for ADV, and I hope that they will release the rest of the 52 episodes of this outstanding anime series before too long, as it is highly addictive, even to a 50-year-old guy who mostly likes Horror and Sci Fi titles...buy!",1138492800,12,651,4.873873873873874
8088097,5,B000BKSJD4,"Though I haven't seen the whole series, this show is a great anime for teenage girls. Ran Kotobuki tells life like it is and encourages her friends to be true to themselves. It's fun, hip, and enjoyable. Can't wait for December when it'll be released",1132099200,4,250,4.5777777777777775
