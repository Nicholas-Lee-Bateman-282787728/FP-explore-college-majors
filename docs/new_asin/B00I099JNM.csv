6245064,3,B00I099JNM,"You have to be a big Jack Lemon fan to really enjoy these 4 movies. Not his greatest works, but not bad. I had never seen these movies before, and since I like his later works: The Out of Towners, The Great Race, The Odd Couple, It Happened to Jane.  I thought I would give them a try. Not bad, but not great. One theme throughout the 4 movies -  sexual obsession. Peter Falk was excellent in LUV.",1411344000,3,397,4.076923076923077

6245066,5,B00I099JNM,"At first glance this may just seem like a set of old movies they are trying to pawn off for $9. But, let me tell you it's a great set of classic movies. The type of movies you just don't forget.

The first Under the Yum Yum Tree, has Lemmon as an ***Spoiler Alert*** unscrupulous womanizing letch who will go to any length to make his conquest. He is the owner and landlord of an apartment complex. Thinking he is renting to two beautiful girls, he rents to a coed and her boyfriend, who have decided to live together on a platonic basis. From there the comedy and hijinks ensue. Foiled quite frequently by a cat. Joined by Paul Lynde and Dean Jones, this is one great movie. Easily worth the price of the entire set.

The second movie is ""My Sister Eileen"". This movie befuddles me as to why it was included in a set to showcase the talents of Jack Lemmon. You see, he was in the movie maybe a grand total of 15 minutes. Two or three minutes well into the movie, then a couple of minutes here and there. To make matters worse, this was a musical. As stated in my review of the ""Jack Lemmon Showcase Volume 2"" I don't particularly care for musicals. That having been said, I did watch the entire movie. The story is about 2 sisters who came to New York from Ohio to find their fame and fortune so to speak. One is an actress, the other a writer. The actress is pretty, the writer is homely. Lemmon plays an editor who is mislead by a story written by the homely one about the pretty one, into believing everything in the story is about the homely one. Yeah, things get confused. There are some fine dancing scenes. The choreography is great. There are some great supporting actors like Dick York and others. Who knew that Dick York could sing? Back to the story. The story however, is weak, and preposterous. This movie does not belong in a set like this.

The third movie ""PHFFFT!"" is about a divorced couple who fall in love again. The story shows us their divorce, how they met and married, how they tried to live apart, how they tried dating again, and how they realized they were still in love with each other. In that order. Lemmon plays the man in the couple. This is a great showing of the talent that Jack Lemmon has as both a comic and a serious actor. I would label this movie more of a dramedy than a comedy.  The story is solid, the movie is good. A great addition to the set.

The fourth movie is ""Luv"", with Jack Lemmon and Peter Falk playing off of each other. Let me just say that this is a goofball movie in the vein of ""Love American Style."" Here Jack Lemmon plays a man who is basically a nut. Peter Falk plays a man who loves a woman who is not his wife, and wants a way to get his wife to divorce him. Enter Lemmon, Falk driving across a bridge encounters Lemmon about to jump off. He talks him into coming home with him and meeting his wife, who he does not love. He eventually convinces Lemmon to meet and make his wife fall in love with him. Lemmon does, they marry. Falk marries the woman he loves, and both find out that their new spouses are not what they wanted, nor who they expected. Falk and his first wife meet, and determine they are still in love. Now, they have to find a way to get rid of Lemmon so that they can remarry. ****Spoiler Alert Over*** There are some extremely funny moments in this movie. Both Lemmon and Falk are excellent. This film certainly lived up to showcasing the amazing talents of Jack Lemmon. However, as a story it was not very good. Certainly not very enjoyable. It's a shame because I became very excited to see Peter Falk in the movie.

Buy the set for the first and third movies, individually they will cost you substantially more. Watch the second and fourth for kicks. Of course if you do buy them individually, you will get a nice dvd case, with Jack Lemmon's signature as well as extras.

6245071,5,B00I099JNM,"I've never owned any of these four Jack Lemmon films, so when Mill Creek decided to put them all in one package at a ridiculously low price, what did I do? This is of course a rhetorical question, because obviously, what I did was buy it.

Artistically, these films are solid studio product from the 50s and 60s, which is to say they are all eminently watchable. It helps that Jack's costars in this set include Kim Novak, Betty Garrett, Judy Holliday and the ever-brilliant Elaine May, whose presence in the 1967 film adaptation of ""Luv"" is a welcome distraction from the film itself.

In addition, all four films are presented anamorphically in their proper widescreen formats, and thus, the picture quality is quite good.",1401840000,21,724,4.784
