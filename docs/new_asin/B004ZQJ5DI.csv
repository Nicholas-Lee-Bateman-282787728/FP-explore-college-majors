4510566,5,B004ZQJ5DI,"In the early days of Australian television one of the highlights was ""Have Gun Will Travel"".Now that I have retired it is great to sit back and once more enjoy those moments from my youth. A great package.",1342656000,7,205,4.421052631578948

Paladin: I don't think you got a very good look at this gun while you had it. The balance is perfect. This trigger responds to a pressure of one ounce. If you look carefully in the barrel you'll see the lines of the rifling. It's a rarity in a hand weapon. This gun was handcrafted to my specifications and I rarely draw it unless I mean to use it. Would you care for a demonstration?

My husband & I love this DVD set of ""Have Gun Will Travel"". It's the original shows plus little ""wire paladin"" options to read more about the episode's cast. This show ran from 1957 - 1963. I hope the final season (season 6) will be available on dvd when we finish watching all of these.  We're almost finished watching the first season.  My husband was a small child when this tv show originally aired & I wasn't born for another decade & don't remember any reruns so I've never seen it before.  I am pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoy it.  My favorite episodes always end up being the ones that were written by Gene Roddenberry (later wrote original star trek tv series).  Another option on the dvds is ""Spanish subtitles"" for the episodes.

By the way, I've finally figured out from one of the episodes in season one that the show is supposed to be set in 1875.",1342483200,2,1341,4.40080971659919

Many times one has fond memories of the older TV programs. When they are finally distributed and bought, it is a shocker to find that they are sophomoric or just long cigarette commercials. Well this time you will not be disappointed.

Each episode must find a conflict and solve it in an extraordinarily short time. Each with a moral and still maintain the entertainment value. One of the ways this is accomplished is the use of a wide spectrum of writers; many of the stories are adoptions of classics or became classics of other programs and/or movies.

Is it possible for a series to get better instead of fading to the mundane? Yes the second season has dropped the extras, with the exception of a quick synopsis of plot and actors, in place of packing in the stories at six or seven a disk. I press the play all button. I will not go through the list of actors as it is fun to be surprised.

One of the finer points of this series is that there usually is no clear cut hero or villain as the characters and themes of the stories are as complete as many ancient myths.  We can see virtues and faults in everyone and many times there is no such thing as a clear-cut winner or loser.

Paladin (Richard Boone), a well chosen name as on a chess board there are many moves available, lives in San Francisco and most people assumes he has investments all over the west as he is taking frequent trips to protect them. We know different as ""Have Gun Will Travel"" he makes his fortune on his many skills.  Every once in a while we get a gimps of his past as we know he went to West Point and can quote many ancient writings and wars. He has an uncanny way of knowing what the meanings of names are. Yet who ever he really is many people are better off for knowing him. And so are we.

A side benefit is recognizing the list of star (actors) and stars in the making.

8450346,5,B004ZQJ5DI,"HGWT was a terrific tv series when it aired in the late 50's.  Half hour shows were tightly written, well directed, morality tales with excellent actors.  You'd be hard pressed to find at tv series today that delivers as consistently good entertainment as HGWT did in its day.  My only complaint about the collection is that there were 2 copies of disc three, season one but no disc one.  I was able to purchase the episodes on disc one from ioffer.com and the entire Rifleman series with Chuck Connors for an excellent price.",1359590400,,526,4.623655913978495
8450347,5,B004ZQJ5DI,Really great set for any western lover. This show was one of the best western TV shows. I would recommend this box set.,1358640000,,119,4.217391304347826
8450348,5,B004ZQJ5DI,"I watched a lot of television in the 1950s and 1960s.  The shows that hold up best today, after repeated viewing, are Have Gun -- Will Travel, Star Trek, and Perry Mason.  Two of the three had scripts by Gene Roddenberry.

Why the great shows of the 1970s and 1980s are harder to find than the earlier shows is a mystery to me.  Where are DVDs or Blu Rays of Lou Grant, L. A. Law, and the rest of Hill Street Blues?",1355443200,,415,4.024390243902439
8450349,5,B004ZQJ5DI,"This was my most favorite TV Western growing up in the 50's (Have Gun Will Travel).  This box collection is very high quality and I have enjoyed it immensely.  My initial concern was the rather large investment cost ($172.).  I would have felt better having the opportunity to have bought the original 6 disc box set of season one only at first.  As it turn's out, I've enjoyed the whole 5 season set and probably would've purchased it all over time anyway.",1349308800,,457,4.536585365853658
8450350,5,B004ZQJ5DI,One of the most amazing television shows of all time.  We have the first five seasons and we have been waiting for Season 6 to complete the series.  We certainly hope to see Season 6 this year. We are very interested to see the episode about the origin of Paladin.,1347580800,5,264,4.26
