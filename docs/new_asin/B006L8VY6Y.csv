8500277,5,B006L8VY6Y,"I have to admit that I am not an exercise geek, and this video fits perfectly well for my needs. I am a healthy senior, and this video keeps me healthy. I can work up quite a sweat, and the video is the ideal length to ensure that I get a workout in before I go to work.

And I do like Gin Miller - she is such a motivator. And down-to-earth and so sincere.",1353110400,8,357,3.76
8500278,4,B006L8VY6Y,"This short workout is very simple and basic, with easy to follow basic moves.  It's a mix of cardio and just a little bit of strength training.  As a male, I found the strength training portion a little too easy, basic and short.

It is an easy intermediate workout if you do the low impact moves and lighter dumbbells. You may make it more intense by wearing the optional weighted vest, jumping on the high impact moves, and using heavier dumbbells.  Besides dumbbells and the optional vest, a bench or chair is required, and a towel is recommended.

Gin Miller instructs and demonstrates in a basic and simple gym setting with a clock counting down the time.
