I only speak English & I found that there was too much English spoken in this movie, it detracted from it somehow. The first Korean things I watched were Secret Garden, My Girlfriend is a 9 tailed fox & You're Beautiful...so maybe I'm spoiled.",1371168000,4,377,4.323943661971831

4048504,4,B0031B0XR0,"I think the highest of Korean movies and have enjoyed many whilst quickly reading the subtitles.  About Korean movies, I enjoy the humor, the culture, the 'familyness' of the movies, the production, the fine actors, and secretly am working towards learning the language.  This was a sweet movie.  I elected to watch it but wasn't expecting that it was half in English.  The storyline is an odd mix and sometimes confusing but it held its own throughout the movie.  It was for me a fusion of western values of a romantic comedy with Korean values.  Having never been to Korea I am putting a happy spin on it because for me it wasn't a pure Korean movie but a very nice Korean movie.  Daniel Henney was great and I'm going to insist my wife watch ""Shanghai Calling""...  Give it a watch and enjoy...",1370217600,,796,4.5174825174825175

4048507,5,B0031B0XR0,"""The funny thing is, after all that's happened, I still miss the old me."" -- June

This light and romantic confection from South Korea is perfect when you just want a scrumptious treat rather than a full meal. Filled with a breezy charm, and an adorable performance from Korean pop star and actress, Uhm Jung-hwa, it is often funny, and sometimes tender, yet never forgets that it is a sweet romantic comedy. By never trying to be more than it is, it succeeds in being one of the best in that genre. Director Sang-woo Kim's 2006 film was released in time for Christmas moviegoers to enjoy the mood the season always brings. While the story itself has nothing to do with the holidays, the tone and atmosphere of the film was a good fit a Christmastime mood. Opposite Jung-hwa, is Korean-American actor and model, Daniel Henney. The role was a good fit for him, and he comes off well as a stoic and somewhat calculating corporate shark, charmed by the cute Jung-hwa, just as the audience has been.

Lovable and sweet Min-joon, whom everyone calls June, is wondering if she can find a love that doesn't leave her lonely. Dumped twice, she is on the verge of it again when she crashes into Robin Heiden's car from behind. Well-dressed and very much in control, he speaks fluent English, refusing to speak Korean. June pretends to only speak Korean, unaware he is her new corporate boss. This multi-language film, with Robin speaking English and June speaking Korean, proves charming, and is often cited as a factor in the film's success. Robin deliberately picks her as his new assistant, and she begins to feel like James Bond, in a world of corporate spies. Robin is very much in the mold of an up and coming corporate raider, and plays his romantic life in much the same manner. When she is dumped for the third time, he offers no shoulder to cry on, but chastises her for bringing it on herself.

Her attempts to win him over so he'll pay up and apologize for the awful things he said to her are often humorous, and never fruitful. Plans A, B, and C all fail, but after a truly funny scene at a party, where another bet is made, a kiss occurs which changes everything. His attempts to remake her into a player able to manipulate love, and win her boyfriend back, has an unsettling effect, however, on both he and her. She discovers that her sweetness and honesty may be working against her in the game of love, but she'd rather be the old her than this new girl. She also discovers the reason behind Robin's cool exterior, amidst a corporate takeover. While we've all seen this before, there's a bit of a twist, as is often the case in Korean films, and enough sweetness to make the journey worth while. Definitely the flip side of the more serious romanticist cinema Korea has made their own over the last decade, this one is breezy and enjoyable on a much lighter, less serious level.

Uhm Jung-hwa's captivating performance, and a cheery atmosphere, with just the right songs mixed in, make for a pleasant time at the movies. A definite charmer, deserving of an A+ rating as a date movie. Fluff, but tremendously enjoyable fluff, proving once again just what a force South Korea has become in the film industry.",1276992000,28,3214,4.584347826086956

4048511,5,B0031B0XR0,"This is a hilarious korean movie starring Daniel Hanney and Jung-hwa Uhm.. I have watched this so many times and each time it is refreshing and funny. it is a light romantic Comedy, with Daniel Hanney playing American Korean Directorof a compamy(Robian Heiden ) who visited the Korean office to conclude a deal of taking over a Japanese company, and on his first day has a car crash with a very distracted Miss June (Jung-hwa- Uhm) Miss June pretended not to speak English and had been skiving off work with an alleged appendix operation , when in reality she had jetted off to Hong kong to meet her  dodgy boyfriend, only he was a no show. Little did she know that the man whose car she dented from behind and whom she told she does not speak English was none other than her new boss. Of course he requested her immediate assignment as his assistance and this was when sparks began to fly. After several put downs from him, she enlisted his help to learn how to seduce a guy  by treating them mean to keep them keen. With his help while spending time together she gains some insight and the  silent battle begins to seduce Mr. Perfect, will she succeed or is his heart scared for life? This was light, funny and romantic. Daniel Hanney is American Korean in reality who does not speak Korean very well, so having him speak in English while others spoke in Korea was funny. He spoke occasionally in Korea and very well in Japanese, so that gave the movie a bit of a flavour. It is a feel good rom com that will have you in stitches when you see the expletives that came out of miss June during a drunken birthday party.",1475280000,4,1619,4.39

4048543,2,B0031B0XR0,"Corny, awkward, and silly are the perfect words to describe this movie. If you're an astute movie critic, you would agree. Why is it corny, awkward, and silly? Here's why:

1. It has a predictable story (i.e. girl bumps into guy's car, they're strangers and don't know that they're going to work together and eventually fall in love but have other ""lovers"" along the way). Corny.
2. The male lead character is (in real life) half Korean and half Irish, but the embarrassing thing is he does not speak Korean throughout this movie (except for one phrase toward the end of this movie). How embarrassing and awkward.
3. The female lead character is literally a sight for sore eyes, because her short hair makes her look like a man. Awkward...

Instead of this corny, awkward, and silly Korean movie, watch these legendary Korean movies that are in the top 20 Korean movies of all time; ""Castaway on the Moon"", ""Shotgun Love"", ""Love Impossible"", and ""The Art of Seduction"". You're welcome.",1433721600,,985,4.788235294117647

4048553,5,B0031B0XR0,"A romantic movie with two main character : a girl lacking self-confidence and a man who hides a secret behind his seducer mask.
This movie is really all romantic. You'll see the two characters evolved as their lives becomes interlocked as she's trying to prove him that she can be loved for who she is and as he tried to prove that she can't have a steady relationship just based on love because she has no self-respect.

The two actors are pretty good and the story isn't linear. I saw this film several times and I still find new element in their expressions that add to the  whole story. I advice you to see it several time since at the end you understand some things you can checked on your second review :)

Be careful for French people like me, the English translation is just for the korean part. Some terms can be difficult to understand as they are related to the economical and society world.",1424563200,2,902,4.421686746987952

Confession -- I didn't even make it to the end so I'm not sure if he confessed his love to her. I actually don't care one way or another.

4048585,3,B0031B0XR0,Not a great movie but I like Daniel Henney and Uhm Jung Hwa.  This was a silly romance but I got through it because of the stars and the acting.  Some may even like the story.,1379721600,,175,3.8333333333333335
4048586,4,B0031B0XR0,"Isn't this every girls's fantasy: a gorgeous boss, a great job, and your dad as your best friend? What's not to enjoy?  I suspect some of the translation does not cross over to English perfectly, but the premise of boy meets girl, boy chases girl, girl chases boy, and multiple timing mishaps, is universal.",1378252800,,307,4.685185185185185
4048587,5,B0031B0XR0,This is a great movie for non korean speakers that are trying to learn or interested in korean movies/tv dramas.  I first watched this through a friend.  After watching it furthered my interest in korean drama tv dramas and movies.,1378080000,8,231,4.75
4048588,5,B0031B0XR0,loved Daniel Henney. The best part is that the movie isn't slow or boring. its overall a very cute movie.,1377820800,2,105,4.3
4048589,5,B0031B0XR0,"The movie was so cute! I have never seen the actor, but he is definitely really handsome. Good ""feel-good"" romantic comedy!",1377475200,3,123,4.904761904761905
4048590,3,B0031B0XR0,"Oh jeeze!  The South Koreans have a thing for cheesy romcoms.  It's always the same.  Handsome, cold, unattainable man falls for goofy, love sick girl, who is beautiful, but of course she doesn't know it.  Please.  She manages to win him over with her zany, ""lovable"", clueless antics.  Again, please.  This move was TOTALLY predictable every step of the way.  The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because of Daniel Henney.  He just happens to be one of the most beautiful men in the world. **sigh**",1377388800,,504,4.573033707865169
4048591,5,B0031B0XR0,Good movie. Good acting and good themes. Another good South Korean film. Me and my wife enjoyed the movie. It's a nice watch.,1376179200,,125,4.478260869565218
4048592,5,B0031B0XR0,"I really enjoyed this movie, it was really cute. It also helped that the main character was extremely attractive. I will be watching this movie again",1375315200,,149,4.769230769230769
4048593,5,B0031B0XR0,"Although I watched the film for Daniel Henney, I was surprised he played such a cold, calculating jerk (so it seems). I know people rag on his acting because he was a model first, but I thought he did a good job. Jung-hwa Uhm stole the scenes, and she was magnificent. Adorable, flighty, feisty, she had me laughing throughout the film. It was definitely a date or chick flick, but a very enjoyable one.",1375142400,,403,4.45945945945946
4048594,5,B0031B0XR0,"Based in Korea for a temporary period, Robin Heiden, an American managing director meets June incidentally before understanding that they work in the same company.
June is a desperately romantic woman who is cheated by her boyfriend. Robin will help her to radically change her behavior with men by giving the rules of the game of love.
Impossible for a woman aged between 15 to 70 not to love this great romantic movie. Dan Henney is the sexiest man in the world and we all would like to take June's place.
I was pleased to watch a Korean production for a change and liked the way Korean actors speak Korean and Henney English. Very good movie.",1374192000,,645,4.568965517241379
4048595,5,B0031B0XR0,"Very interesting the performance of Daniel Henney.

I didn't know the actor, but it was a wonderful surprise. I hope to see him play drama pictures some day.",1373846400,,157,4.607142857142857
4048596,3,B0031B0XR0,"Really quite feeble. It does have good bits. The female lead is decent and tries her best, but she's let down by a threadbare script and a uninspiring male lead.
The male lead also only speaks in English throughout the whole movie, I was surprised how annoying that got. If they had just changed up the male lead and had someone work on the script to fix the worst of the it, could have been a decent movie.",1373241600,2,407,4.230769230769231
4048597,5,B0031B0XR0,I thoroughly enjoyed this Korean love story.  Handsome actor and cute actress with good acting. Interesting glimpses into corporate Korea as well.,1372550400,,146,5.636363636363637

8386831,5,B0031B0XR0,"gotta love it.  a very entertaining comedy / romance.  the two actors are perfect for each other, the script and plot believable, the supporting actors very good.  very fun to watch",1513814400,,181,4.774193548387097
8386832,5,B0031B0XR0,"Honestly, I really wasn't sure if it was a Korean flick or not at first.  Roughly half of it was spoken in English.  It is fun, hilarious, and has a happy ending.  My favorite scene is where June was wrestling her brother for 3 bucks.  That alone earned 5 stars from me.",1506384000,,270,4.134615384615385
8386833,5,B0031B0XR0,one of my favorite movies!,1502409600,,26,4.4
8386834,4,B0031B0XR0,"Well what else is there to say but Daniel Henley. Okay, maybe more but it was a good comedy. While the story and plot has been done many times before this was an okay spin. The leads gave good ranges in their roles and made it fun to watch. Easy Thursday night movie.",1499299200,,267,4.056603773584905
