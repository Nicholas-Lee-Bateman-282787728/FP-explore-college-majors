8258916,1,B0015LMOJ8,"This collection is made up of half hour b&w crime oriented TV programs from the very early days of commercial TV. Except for Dragnet, I doubt if any but the most dedicated TV buff or historian ever heard of these short lived TV series. The programs were probably saved using the kinescope method--filming the program off a TV screen. The images are grainy and faded. Whatever good acting talent are in these shows is wasted on trite plots and bad writing. The price for this set is cheap enough. But your time and money is best used elsewhere.",1375833600,,543,4.551020408163265
