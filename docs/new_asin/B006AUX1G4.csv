She is a friendly, down to earth instructor. I look forward to popping these in the DVD player. An hour very well spent. Her method for getting into the splits really works. I also learned some great neck and shoulder stretches that have decreased pain in both areas.",1421452800,,404,4.785714285714286
8495848,5,B006AUX1G4,I benefited quickly from these routines and they are slow paced so ANYONE can follow along. I also love that I've been using these DVDS for a year now- beginners can use it AND intermediate people can still benefit and continue to grow.,1397520000,,236,4.511627906976744
8495849,4,B006AUX1G4,"The routines are great and she explains why each stretch is getting you closer to your goals. My big complaint is that there is no audio countdown of each stretch so when holding it you must watch the screen which is annoying and sometimes cheats you of a deeper stretch. Also, the music is horrid and just repeats throughout the video and on the next one as well.

Overall, I say buy them, mute them, and have a stopwatch ready.",1366416000,4,429,4.3625
