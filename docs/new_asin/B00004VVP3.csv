1358197,4,B00004VVP3,"Although I wondered why just these four subjects were selected for a boxed set about the Bible, I found almost all four very well done, well-acted, well-produced and surprisingly more elaborate and lush than I expected. Genesis was somewhat slow and plodding with odd juxtapositions of Biblical times, modern near-Eastern life and even shots of Manhattan; it was the only one of the four I didn't care for and could have been presented with more passion and less avant garde camera techniques.

Nonetheless, the other three were truly excellent, with just a couple of Scriptural slips that can be easily overlooked in order to enjoy the larger picture. Ben Cross as Solomon was a casting coup. His acting is nothing short of stellar.

I'd like to see more of the Old Testament stories produced by the same team, such as perhaps Exodus, Joshua, Isiah, Daniel and Jonah. For the next group of Biblical stories, should there be one, it would be valuable and exciting to have some important New Testament stories such as the various gospels and maybe even Romans, if it can be done.

""Revelation"" has still not been done in any decent way on film and that, too, would be a superb story to tell if done by the same team that did this 4-story boxed set.",979084800,19,1247,4.684931506849315

1358310,1,B00004VVP3,Esther dvd did not play. Guessing it was from a different region than 1 since there are tons out there in spanish. I threw it out.  Gensis movie had horrible music thoughout the entire movie. Threw out.  Other 2 are pretty good. But when you pay for 4 and only get 2 good dvd's the whole thing is a rip off.,1380844800,,307,4.016393442622951
1358311,5,B00004VVP3,"I really enjoyed these DVDs.  Many of the other Bible DVDs aren't true to scripture.  They add or leave out important information to make a good movie.  Others are truer to the Word but simply aren't good films.  I really enjoyed this series.  Good actors/actresses, very good representation of scripture and nice films.  I had been looking particularly for a film about Esther after doing an in depth study of the Book of Esther.  I watched 3 other movies that didn't even come close to the scripture like this one...and I really enjoyed watching it.  Very pleased that I bought this! Thanks!",1378425600,,593,4.745098039215686

Surprised that there were no ratings speaking about more than just ""license"".  Where on earth does God present himself as a little girl's voice?  In Benny Hinn's bedroom while he seeing little angels and/or describing us as ""little gods""?  I have to say I am dismayed (although it is what we are to expect), of the amount of false Biblical portrayals and books.  I'll give some more info later.",1262995200,3,533,4.5473684210526315

1358489,5,B00004VVP3,"To get a real-life, detailed, and accurate account of the stories of the heroes/legends in the Old Testament, this series is exceptional.

Realism is only matched in quality by the other Bible Colletion series, which has Joseph, Abraham, Jacob, and David.

Care to detail is really the greatest asset, and the performers are chosen with great care. Musical scores are terrific.

Want a portrait of today, with greed, avarice, and discontent? This is a great way to see that times may change, but,people will never change.

  The redemption of each character is riveting, and hits to the heart of every viewer. I hope they do more of these.

Only widescreen would be an additional asset.",1140048000,6,686,4.913043478260869

1358492,5,B00004VVP3,"Now I have to say that 3 of these movies are absolutly great, but the genesis one is a stinker! Esther, Jeremiah and Soloman are all dramatisations of the Biblical stories with great actors who put in brilliant performances. Genesis is a bunch of weird looking guys just walking around with a boring narration. And the narration does not even match what is on screen half the time. If Ed Wood did a Biblical epic it would look like Genesis!

1358494,4,B00004VVP3,"A magnificant set of movies packaged into one deal.  Who said bible based movies cannot be good?  The most interesting of these movies was the Jeremiah film.  These films crush the horriable (yet loved) ""Left Behind: The movie"" apocolyptic style films.  The only reason I give this series a 4, is because I feel the scenes could have been shot a little bit better with the camera, and parts of the Solomon film were a bit boring.
It would be nice to see more films like this.  I'm glad these movies exist.  I think it would be great if we saw more movies based on the books of the prophets, and maybe a movie or two based on the book of acts/pauline epistles (although that could be a bit confusing for people who are not familiar with Christianity).",981072000,14,750,4.398550724637682
