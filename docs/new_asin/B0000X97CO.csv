Delivery was quick, but I was horrified to find out that I received a BOOTLEG copy of this movie. The cover almost looks like the original, only a cheaply printed xerox copy with faded colors. The movie is also in Fullscreen, cover art visibly patched non-factory style onto the disc (DVD:R). The movie is heavily pixilated, hard to watch. The image is so blurry, it's almost like watching an old VHS tape.
I am outraged. Don't want to bother with the return. The cost was $5:97 total, so not worth the hassle. Buyer beware!!

Quick update:
I forwarded my review to ""bargainmovies"" the same day and they graciously offered a refund to settle this situation.
They claimed that they had no idea it was a bootleg. Be it as it may - make sure not to order this specific title so you won't repeat my mistake! And I still want the ""original"" copy of this film for my collection!!",1266364800,,1064,5.37125748502994
8004239,5,B0000X97CO,"This is a fantastic slice of non-stop, high octane, martial-arts, comedy horror thriller in the vein of Van Helsing and Underworld and even the Blade movies. It's a film that entertains and doesn't take itself too seriously. And if, like me, you thought Underworld and Van Helsing were great concepts ruined by poor execution then look no further for how this kind of film should be done.

Of course the plot doesn't bear scrutiny; something about a European vampire killing off vampire royalty to collect their blood in order to open an ancient and sacred book that grants a vampire daylight immortality (!) Nice. And continuity's dubious; at the start of the film our hero and his sidekick have trouble fighting off 10 vampires by the end vamps are being despatched in the dozens and our two heroines (KPop stars and both excellent to boot (Imagine Atomic Kitten doing Ultraviolet. It just wouldn't work!)) have strength and endurance beyond their perfectly formed but still small and dainty frames.

But none of this detracts from the overall experience. The fight scenes are fast and furious and, yes, over-the-top, with some superb CGI/wire work interplay. The comedy includes direct parodies of more famous films along with plenty of inter-character rivalries. The first meeting and subsequent fight between the two female leads is hilarious. The actors themselves also appear to be having a ball and their enthusiasm's infectious. So long as you've checked your brain out at the start you'll be hollering along in joy. The vampires are also wonderfully characterised. The Royal Prince living in his hi-tech coffin refusing to lower himself to actually sucking blood: He'll have his decanted by a servant, thank-you-very-much! And the way they move is captured perfectly; exactly how I envisioned Count Dracula in Stoker's novel: like a malevolent Spiderman!

It's also worth noting that Charlene Choi is some of the prettiest Asian eye candy around :o)

And it's got Jackie Chan in it.

So in conclusion, it's a must. I can't think of a better way to waste an hour and a half and I'm pretty sure this film will be taking several more hours off my life. Not that I mind in the slightest. It's so enjoyable I've even ordered its two sequels, sight unseen!",1225152000,,2260,4.936842105263158
8004240,5,B0000X97CO,"This vampire action comedy is one of my favorites for the very fact that I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire movie. First of all, the characters are memorable, contributing a myriad of classic scenes. Charlene and Gillian are naturally cute, charismatic, and humorous. This movie was my first exposure to them, and all I wanted to do was reach through my television screen and give them a REALLY BIG HUG. The remaining cast did well in their supporting roles, including Jackie Chan, Karen Mok, ""The Duke"", Josie Ho, Edison Chen, Anthony Wong, and the vampire bad guys (one of which looks eerily familiar to Will Ferrell). Even the abominably horrible Ekin Cheng was good in this one. Good characters are important, of course, because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things interesting between action sequences.

And speaking of action, this film has plenty of it. More importantly, there is an emphasis of quality in the fight choreography. One aspect that helped in this regard is the featured weapon of the protagonists - a sword with a retractable spear-ended rope. This weapon, in and of itself, opened up a variety of moves that would have been otherwise impossible. Josie Ho and Gillian Chung, in particular, perform some wicked aerial maneuvers using these devices.

In addition, the swordplay is superb, and is highlighted by two great sword fights - one taking place during the opening train station sequence and the other occurring in the church finale. In fact, the blade-wielding maneuvers showcased in this film put some other highly overrated fan favorites to great shame, and I truly feel sorry for those who would cite the horribly choreographed garbage seen in Ashes of Time, Storm Riders, or A Man Called Hero with the well-planned, precisely executed sequences seen in The Twins Effect. It's not even close.

This film was so good that it actually set me up for being disappointed at other Chinese movies with the same actors and actresses. This especially applies to Ekin Cheng, whose other films almost always suck - and yes, this includes the obscenely overrated and exploitative wuxia crap mentioned in the previous paragraph. Even The Twins have never been able to match the value of this movie when both were lead actresses in a film, although they have managed to hit some good films when either one or the other takes the leading role (e.g., Beyond Our Ken, Good Times Bed Times, House of Fury) or when one or both are in supporting roles (e.g., Colour of the Truth, New Police Story, Just One Look). The Twins Effect 2 should have been a direct sequel, instead of a family fantasy. I am still yearning to see Charlene and Gillian team up and kick some butt in another movie, but the fact remains that The Twins Effect hits on all cylinders, optimizing their charisma while avoiding a descent into annoyance (as in Protg de la Rose Noire).

All in all, this film has everything one needs to be entertained. And may I remind the reader that it is precisely this - ENTERTAINMENT - that judges the greatness of a movie, more so than artsy dramatic elements or meaningless awards from established academies of critics who usually have no idea what they are talking about.

In the end, the Twins Effect is a CLASSIC not to be missed.

Rating = 5/5 stars

P.S. - The Hollywood execs decided to slaughter this film when it was released in the U.S. by renaming it The Vampire Effect and cutting out 20 minutes of footage, which includes parts of the action scenes. However, the final fight of the U.S. version does have a better soundtrack than the original version. Therefore, I purchased both versions, which allows me to first watch the original until about the 1:20 mark, and then swap discs to watch the final fight on the U.S. version.",1166054400,4,3788,4.800613496932515
8004241,3,B0000X97CO,"Note: Chinese with English subtitles.

'The Twins Effect' is a suprisingly enjoyable film designed primarily to cash in on the popularity of the Asian pop singing duo ""Twins"" comprised of Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung. The two attractive young ladies fight their way through vampires, boyfriends and each other in high style with great special effects and fight sequences that won't disappoint.

Directors Dante Lam and Donnie Yen surrounded the duo with an excellent cast which includes; Ekin Cheng, Edison Chen, Mickey Hardt and a brief but memorable cameo by Jackie Chan as himself.",1150934400,3,587,5.23404255319149
8004242,5,B0000X97CO,"((First off, having read a few other reviews, you really shouldn't compare Hong Kong films to American Hollywood films. Please be aware that while many of the Chinese actors speak English and some were even born or schooled in America, the cultures are vastly different. Westerners may not ""get"" Eastern humor or references all the time. This does not mean Asian films are subpar by nature; It just means you may have to pick up some Eastern background to fully appreciate them. Doing so is worth the effort.))

As my first forray into the world of the uber-cutsie Twins (took me forever to figure out WHY this was called the Twins Effect), I have to say I was impressed. I am familiar with Eastern vamps (they are hideously ugly and hop. Yes, they hop) and the usage of a Western vampire was a very intriguing twist. Granted, most Westerners who see this movie will have no idea that this is an odd mix, but they chose a marvelous actor, Mickey Hardt, to play the Duke and I found the five sons of the Vampire King needed to open the Vampi Bible ""Day for Night"", was a suitable plot device. I liked that one of the Western-style vamps was also Chinese. The Vamp King is apparently quite profilic and likes variety; More power to him. The Vamp Prince, Kazaf, played by Edison Chen, was likable enough but stereotypical in that he was 'good' and refused to suck human blood despite the instructions given to him by his manservant and bodyguard, Prada, played by the inimitable Anthony Wong. Wong did a wonderful job, as per usual, and ended up one of the more enjoyable characters in the movie. Ekin Cheng, (ever a proponent of the Twins) playing the Vampire hunter Reeve, was likable enough and actually performed better than usual; he was less wooden than I think I had ever seen him. The Twins were okay, too, though nothing out of the ordinary when compared to other Hong Kong actresses, though they seem fairly natural at acting in a convincing manner. Donnie Yen adds impressive fight scenes/choreography and co-directing. Jackie Chan gives a good guest appearance and is always a welcome sight, as is the lovely and talented Karen Mok, both who are personal favorites of mine.

All in all, this movie was impressive. I have seen it perhaps half a dozen times from purchase date so far and have recommended it to others. (But not the American version! It cuts out some good stuff, even though it does add maybe 11 seconds of footage you won't see in the Chinese version.) The end battle in this movie is really well-done. Biggest complaint I have is the unnecessary narration from Reeve in the beginning. I hate devices that don't follow through in the movie or are just thrown in because the writer is too lazy to incorporate into the dialog or action. Very annoying. In the end, though, I give this one 5 stars; it was truly entertaining!",1132876800,3,2845,4.620553359683795
8004243,4,B0000X97CO,"Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung- two of Chinas biggest pop stars(aka TWINS) must stop the ""Duke"" from openening ""Day for Night""(vampire bible) which will give him control of the human world. Don't let the fact that these are two pop stars trying to fight vampires repel you. The film is actually pretty good- believe it or not. They have actually been in quite a few films and do pretty well. Along with Jackie Chan(small cameo scenes- not too much fighting), Ed(ison) Chen(my arch nemesis), Ekin Cheng(who is in numerous other TWINS movies), and Anthony Wong. How can you go wrong. Watch for the fight between TWINS(choreographed by Donnie Yen)- its pretty impressive-even though they have no martial arts training. It is essentially a teen film but it has good action and TWINS so its a must. P.S- watch out- TWINS are addictive. Seriously.",1074384000,3,842,4.895104895104895
