7789563,5,0780621239,"Bhutan seems like a pretty nice place, a tiny mountain kingdom of just over half a million people rated the happiest country in Asia and eighth happiest in the world by Business Week magazine. Even so, Bhutan is neither Shangri-La nor a living Eden.  The country has its own set of problems, most notably discrimination against ethnic minorities, a closed political system, religious restrictions and alcoholism.

You won't learn anything about any of these human issues in this National Geographic feature, which focuses almost exclusively on the flora and fauna of the Himalayas.  There is a small bit on the migration cycle of nomadic herdsmen, but their lives are presented within the context of the rhythm and cycles of the natural world.  If you want to learn something about politics, history, or Buddhism, you'll need to look elsewhere.  If you'd like to know a little about the snow leopard, the goat-like bharal, the red panda, or the golden langur, this is the film for you.  If you can get past the pretentious title, you'll find the photography and music (both modern and traditional) beautifully genuine and genuinely beautiful.

7789565,5,0780621239,"This video in the ""Living Edens"" series is an interesting mixture of Buddhist philosophy and superb nature photography.  More than just a natural history video, it seeks to show how the people of Bhutan live in harmony with each other and with all sentient beings, i.e., the birds, mammals, and other creatures of the land.  In Bhutan, ravens and cranes are sacred, and even have their own monasteries, where the monks welcome them back each year.  Because of the Bhutanese ecology-friendly way of life, the country is a haven for many species that are found nowhere else in the world.  The chance to see them on film makes this video a real treasure.
One very creative feature that I like is the way in which the film goes back and forth between watching a Bhutanese artist paint a mural, and footage of the actual plants, animals, or places in the real world.  We see the artist mixing vivid colors, then see those exact same colors in nature itself.  In the end, the mural ties everythig together into one harmonious whole.",1006128000,7,1026,4.6722222222222225
7789566,5,0780621239,"If you are trying to research Bhutan, you know by now that information is a bit scarce, so I've used this video to round out my knowledge of this gorgeous country in preparation for a trip. The photography is exquisite--one has to wonder how long this natural paradise can survive in the modern world. It is easy to romanticize Bhutan--it is easy to forget that the people are poor and the life hard. But the natural beauty and wildlife shown here are unrivaled.",998352000,4,462,4.578313253012048
