8603563,5,B00EBFSDDQ,"A very good friend of mine recommended this movie and I was not disappointed. The Encore of Tony Duran is about a guy who is down and out and the struggles he faces with himself and the people around him. A very heartfelt movie... but, hilarious at times. Great acting and outstanding directing. I loved it!",1380153600,,307,4.5
8603564,5,B00EBFSDDQ,"I was worried when I bought this that it might just be a lifeless feel-good movie, which isn't my bag, but then I started watching it.  My goodness!  This movie had grit!  And the lead actor nailed it!  When all was said and done I felt like Tony Duran was a real guy, a guy with all the ugly shadings of a true human being, and that he was the only true kind of inspiration: fat, ugly, sweaty and messed up, just like all the rest of us.  Great movie!",1377561600,3,452,3.977777777777778
