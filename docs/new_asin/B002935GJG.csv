3876076,1,B002935GJG,"Total waste of your time. The story is very familiar by now. College partying, a few topless women, normal teen movie stuff. All the cast is unfamiliar. Women are not even decent looking. The entire movie is boring to say the least. It never grabs your interest. How people like this mindless crap I will never know. Lots of decent movies in this class, this isn't one of them.",1263945600,10,377,4.478260869565218
3876077,1,B002935GJG,"Do not rent this movie! I love ""silly comedies"", but this is a horrible movie. It looks like someone shot it with a handheld camera over the weekend. Horrible lines and horrible acting. Please save your money.",1258761600,14,209,4.675675675675675
3876078,2,B002935GJG,"This is a college frat house party film, so in that aspect it gets one star for almost feeling like a docudrama, and the supplements are more thorough than one would ever normally see for a film this low brow - so it gets one more.

This Johnny Lechner is apparently a legend in the college community for his ability to ""get high school chicks"" even into his fourteenth year of going to college. The story follows two underlings as they navigate the tribulations of college partying as taught by this Lechner guy (who has apparently made it onto Letterman in the real world). I suppose if I were in college and felt that all females are there strictly for being naked, having sex, then disposing of them for more ""high school chicks"" - then I might dig this film. There isn't really any acting or competent camera work, this is just strictly a 24 hour frat house party caught on film.

The supplements contain 5 minutes of alternate/deleted scenes, 5 1/2 minutes of John Reisig's stand up (a couple light laughs), two different commentaries that were as enlightening as one can expect for this, and a 20 minute interview with this Fossil (Lechner) guy. Essentially he relays the importance of his lifelong pursuit of going to college, getting high school chicks and drinking.

The film is amateurish, and caters to those that feel college is nothing more than a ruse. It might appeal to those that want college to be that way or they dream about how to score all the hedonism possible while forging scholarships and using the system. I can watch a film for entertainment purposes, but it has to have some value, and there is no value here. Film stock is bad, the camera out of focus through most of the film, the sound is wretched and the cover art is ripped from Girls Gone Wild. Enjoy.",1248739200,14,1787,4.5607476635514015

3876125,1,B002935GJG,"This movie sucks, and is waist of money. I thought it was one thing, and was other. The acting is poor, the story is typical of party life of college students, and the two main characters wanting it to end. And has low budget written all over it, I'm happy I didn't waist anymore than $2 on it. It was even worth that.",1398124800,,318,4.063492063492063

The movie is kind of lame, has its moments, but when I hear the music in it I cant help but watch this thing! Anyways rent it on netflix...I think it can even be streamed on your tv from there, but buy the music of Clear Conscience!! Well worth it and in 2011 they are going to be HUGE!!
