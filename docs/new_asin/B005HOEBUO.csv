4702587,5,B005HOEBUO,"THANKS, WARNER ARCHIVE, FOR BRINGING TIM HOLT BACK... Back for those who had the opportunity to enjoy these ""B"" westerns--now considered by a great many fans as ""Classics""... and for a whole new generation to enjoy.  Having purchased Volume 3 previously, my review for this terrific set of films is the same--both sets of these Tim Holt westerns, beautifully restored by Warners, are a joy to own and enjoy.

A whole new generation, or more, now have the opportunity to see and enjoy thirty of Tim Holt's so-called ""B"" westerns, originally released by RKO Radio Pictures. Warner Brothers has made available, from the studio's archives, 30 of his movies from the mid-1940s through 1952. Though some sixty years old, these DVD transfers look and sound GREAT! His career has, unfortunately, too often been dismissed as second rate; but, as one who grew up watching these films, Tim Holt was a hero and a role model for myself and countless other kids. Sadly, this man--a World War II hero--passed away at a young age. But he left a great legacy!

4702588,5,B005HOEBUO,"These Tim Holt Movies are very good. Warner Brothers should be glad they have so many good ""B"" westerns. Just give us other good western hero's, like Johnny Mac Brown, Lash Larue, The Durango Kid (Charles Starret), Jimmy Wakley, Bob Steele, Stoney Brook (and company), Wild Bill Elliott, The Three Mesquiteers, Alan Lane, and Don ""Red"" Barry.  And made them alone, like ""Tim Holt"" volumes, and PLEASE DO NOT CHARGE TOO MUCH, I would really like that. THANK YOU",1327536000,11,460,4.822784810126582
4702589,5,B005HOEBUO,"As a fan of cowboy Westerns, I found that Tim Holt movies were often a bit more adult than the standard juvenile fare. Surely Westerns were made for the kiddies in the 1940s, who flocked to movie palaces to watch Hopalong Cassidy and Roy Rogers. But Tim Holt Westerns were made for adults as well as children. Turner Classic Movies has aired a number of them in the past and even with Turner in High Def, the quality was so-so because the studio kept turning to the same masters year after year.

Thankfully, this five-disc set has the same movies but transferred using today's latest technology and equipment, and are obviously from the 35mm nitrates, so the picture quality is better than what you see on Turner! Warner Archive came out with three sets and all of them are just as gorgeous as this volume.

By the way, Warner Brothers has been releasing these DVDs in DVD-R format. Regrettably, a friend of mine who bought a set and watched it wanted to resell it. After all, he didn't want to keep it, just watch the films and then put the DVD set back up on Amazon as ""used"" and at a discount. Someone bought the set and filed a complaint, stating they were bootlegs because they were DVD-R format. Amazon.com acknowledges and discloses the fact that these are DVD-R format, but when the customer complained, Amazon kicked my friend off their site and he cannot buy anything from Amazon.com any more. This is a shame and unfair to my friend because it's the very same item Amazon shipped to him. Small suggestion: If you decide to resell your Tim Holt set, consider reselling it elsewhere.",1322006400,17,1593,4.585964912280701
