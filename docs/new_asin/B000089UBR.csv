1834318,2,B000089UBR,"Story:2(could have been a WHOLE lot better,not chopped up in a hurry and not having such a pointless and stupid ending,leaving you in the dust...*grumble*)
Art:4(Ohhh! How I hate their faces!!! They are so chubby and long!!!! ggrrr...dont ask why but Mustsumi reminds me of this annoying girl at school,but the art of the anime makes her look exactly like her...grr)
Music:4(okay,not too many new songs,but the one that was new sorta stinks...-_-'..Keitaro,Naru and the others sing it..)
Characters:3(too easy going,unlike the manga...*whispers* you can tell I love the manga,huh?)
Sounds:5
Okay,first let me say what I have to say about this DVD/video. The manga is soooo much worth reading than this 'movie'(they turned my favorite kawaii volume into a pointless piece of you know what!). Its boring,but if your a real Love Hina faniac and have money to crash then I guess this is for you.
The movie starts out intresting,making me excited if this is a good movie. I think one of the highlights of this movie is that...*smirks* Mr. Akamatsu himself makes a appearance....he kind of reminds me of a few other manga artists out there who 'accidently' show up in their works...*coughs* Miho Obana *cough*
Keitaro thinks he failed his entrance exam so he runs off for a job that he has no idea about and ends up on a island,rescued by the very-suspicously-looks-like-Shinbou,Nyamo,and then Naru and the gang tries to bring him back....
....the sad thing about this movie is...its so unrealstic! It has no plot,the way the end up on the island is so unbelieveably stupid and corny (in the manga Suu did not fly on a man-made turtle! Or Naru sky diving! They all went by plane! Which makes the manga seem a little more realstic! The people making the anime must have skipped through the manga and made up everything and the ending...)
To me,if you like this story,the manga is much more uncut,funny,and the art is goregous ^_~! I love the way Akamatsu draws his characters! Also his stories are much more enjoyable and not butchered like in the manga,and dig this,its a whole lot cheaper than the anime! Uh oh...I'm getting off the subject! ^-^'
They should have not ended the series the way they did. They should have waited and finished the story AFTER THEY COMPLETED THE WHOLE SERIES,NOT FINISHING IT IN THE MIDDLE! We would have more earned stuff for our money! ^^ Oh well,thank god for manga!(uh oh! I said that word...*tsk* *tsk* :P)
Anyway if you really need some Love Hina before the OVA,then by all means you will enjoy at least some of the movie...^_~!",1053907200,3,2558,4.8159090909090905
1834319,2,B000089UBR,"Love Hina - Christmas Movie provided the closing remarks.  It gave what viewers wanted by letting Keitaro and Naru join together as a couple and fellow students at the college of their dream.  It was nice to see that they decided to finish the series in good note in which Episode 24 didn't.  BUT...
Instead of leaving the series at the top of shape, they decided to milk it as much as it can.  And the result is Love Hina - Spring Movie.
Unlike Christmas Movie, this provides no additional plot, nor extra material such as Episode 25 (it is useless, however).  It is covered with sameless that starts to wear thin, and 45 minutes of movie starts look as if it would never end.  I can't see any justification of purchasing this movie, since this is pointless part of the series.  Very disappointing.",1047859200,7,799,4.506944444444445
1834320,3,B000089UBR,"Don't buy the Love Hina Spring Movie DVD for the special. This single, 45 minute Spring Special (affectionately renamed 'Movie' by Bandai) starts strong but ends weak and turns the original manga story it was based on into a joke.
Instead, buy this disc for its features. This DVD has all the bonuses that we've been waiting for and denied since the series was released, including textless openings and closings to the series, the textless ending to Episode 24, and the textless ending to the Spring Special itself. Still, the price is pretty steep for just a bonus disc that has a single 45 minute epsiode on it and extras, but we can always hope the price will come down.
So if you're going to buy it, buy the DVD for the features to complement the series, and considor the 'Movie' an extra bonus.
...And don't worry, this isn't the end. The OVA Love Hina Again will be released soon enough and it puts on a rather nice ending to the anime series.",1045872000,12,949,4.491329479768786
1834321,5,B000089UBR,"Following after the events of the TV series and the Christmas Special, this is when Keitaro, Naru, and Mutsumi are getting ready to take the entrance exam to Tokyo University again.  The Spring Special also focuses on Shinobu, who is still struggling with her feelings about Keitaro and her own self as well.  With great confidence about Tokyo U this time around, Keitaro dreams about his and Naru's future in the middle of the exam and falls asleep.  Thinking that he fails again, he runs away to an island in the Pacific with Naru soon after in hot pursuit to bring him back, neither of them knowing their fate about Tokyo U.  The residents of the Hinata join in the search as well, learning about a turtle civilization, and a girl named Nyamo who has a dream.  What will become of our Tokyo U candidates?  Will their dream come true?  Definitely another part of the story to add to your collection.  And hopefully, we'll be seeing the final OAV of this great series Love Hina Again soon.",1044230400,13,990,4.553672316384181
1834322,4,B000089UBR,"While there are three oavs after this spring special, this is really the last love hina installment that captures the original feeling of the series.  I saw this a while back fan-subbed and I really thought it was great.  I won't give away anything, but I will say that one plotline is finally brought to an end.  It is probably unlikely that you will enjoy this dvd as much as you should if you haven't seen the rest of the series that comes before it.  One complaint I have is that the specials were released seperately when they could have very easily been put on a single release.  That's marketing for you though.",1043884800,7,618,4.433628318584071

7981389,5,B000089UBR,"SPOILER:
So this special happens after the Love Hina regular series and the Christmas special. It comes in when the group attempt to get into Toudai. It's a wonderful special and I love the characters.
I am sad to say that the anime was planned for 52 episodes but ended with only 26 and these specials are to supplement the loss.
Overall I am satisfied.",1388620800,,354,4.461538461538462
7981390,4,B000089UBR,"Ok, this one follows up directly after Love Hina Christmas Movie. Naru admitts her feelings but not to the person in which it matters the most. This movie has some nearly kiss moments and a bunh more comedy and problems of the heart. Welcome back the gang from the Love Hina series. This is a must have for followers of this great anime. Wach in order for a more comprehensive and emotional value. 1) Love Hina the complete series 2) Love Hina Chrismas Movie 3) Love Hina Spring Movie 4) Love Hina Again series.",1381104000,,511,4.446808510638298
7981391,4,B000089UBR,"Keitaro bombed his entrance exam again, and in a fit of depression he runs away. The girls rack him down on a remote desert island. That's pretty much it.

I have always really liked Love Hina, but this is the weakest of the series. It has the comedy you would expect, but it's just not as interesting. It definitely doesn't have the impact of of the Christmas special or the series. Even so if you like the Love Hina series then this movie will most likely entertain you.",1350777600,,472,4.363636363636363
7981392,3,B000089UBR,"The LOVE HINA SPRING MOVIE follows the CHRISTMAS MOVIE, and there are certain Web critics who don't particularly like this one, apparently because they feel that SPRING suffers by comparison with CHRISTMAS. Maybe so- I've got the CHRISTMAS MOVIE on order- but on its own terms, SPRING isn't bad, if you liked the series- it has about the same mix of the incredibly silly on the one hand (flocks of flying turtles) and some semi-sweet romance on the other (our heroine Naru obviously has warmer feelings toward the hapless Keitaro than she did in the series, even though her feelings still largely manifest themselves through slapstick violence.)
The story: Keitaro's trying the Tokyo U. exams again, and starts daydreaming during a ""killer English exam"". By the time he snaps out of it, he's only got minutes left to finish. Convinced that he didn't pass, he once again runs away, this time to an island called Parakalese, where he joins a Shinobu-lookalike native girl named Nyamo in her search for her grandfather. Naru angrily goes after him, and the rest of the Hina Apartments ladies follow suit.
The SPRING MOVIE has quite a bit more romance than an equivalent amount of the series (there are actually a couple of near-kisses here, and several nice moments between Naru and Keitaro on the island), but like the series it occasionally nearly drowns in its own absurdity. So again all I can say is: if you liked the series, you'll be OK with the SPRING MOVIE.",1242259200,,1463,4.809523809523809
