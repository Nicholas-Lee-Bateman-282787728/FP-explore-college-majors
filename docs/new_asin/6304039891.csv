767838,5,6304039891,"a spectacular dvd based on a great book.  the claymation within is beautiful and looks like an old painting.  this film adaptation leaves nothing to be desired, and i'll never be able to read the book without picturing its beautiful images.",1240099200,4,240,4.829268292682927
767839,5,6304039891,"I saw this when it first came out over 20 years ago and I have been looking for it for quite a while. Although the film is a short it follows the story fairly accurately. It is more than amazing claymation, the backgrounds are equally amazing with swirling patterns in pastels, acrylics and water colors. This story is truly delightful, important and heart-wrenching. Do not simply dismiss this as a simple children's tale, adults need this more than most kids.",1180483200,8,461,4.775
767840,5,6304039891,"This trippy claymation adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exupery's classic tale of The Little Prince is both stunning to watch and emotionally memorable. The narration by Cliff Robertson helps keep the story going, and since most of his dialouge is straight from the book, it provides the insights and intricacies of the human heart that can never be perfectly transferred to the screen.

The way that this adaptation makes use of color and sound could only be from the 70s, and while this is clearly a children's short film, adults can enjoy it too. Much of it even seems specifically made for those viewers who may be in an altered state of some sorts.

For those who like the book, this is a great transfer to screen, entirely unpretentious and childlike in it's presentation, in the same way the book is.",1175817600,15,805,4.742857142857143
767841,3,6304039891,"Few seem to remember this claymation version of ""The Little Prince,"" which unfortunately isn't too surprising, even though the art itself is executed wonderfully. The original book is much too strong to be solidly translated into a narrated eye-candy short. This was bested a thousand-fold both by the other work of Will Vinton's studio (see ""Martin the Cobbler,"" ""Dinosaur,"" and perhaps even the California Raisins specials) and by the animated show a few years later, which proved far more poignant despite the target audience of children. While ultimately better than the '74 live-action movie, it does nothing more than add an abridged, artsy spin to a story that's superior in its original text format.

Those who love claymation and/or anything having to do with The Little Prince will find more to savor here; devotees of the original book or the animated ""The Adventures of the Little Prince"" may see this as a denigration in an artful guise.",1167350400,2,950,5.050955414012739

767844,2,6304039891,"I recently bought this video here at Amazon[.com] after reading the three wonderful reviews.
But this video wasn't what I had expected.
In my opinion, there's quite a few things that make this video a poor choice:
The video is about 27 minutes long. The actual story is more than 2-3 hours long if read through straight, so this video cuts out more than 2/3 of the story from the actual book. I think the story in this video is hurried, which leaves no time to ponder for the imaginary young minds. The video & sound quality is very poor as well.
I recommend getting the Little Prince software by Viva Media/Tivola instead of this video. I think the software is exceptionally good since it includes the book with animation, and it doesn't sacrifice any part of the story.",1051660800,17,771,4.553956834532374
7860088,5,6304039891,This was a childhood favorite that I only had on VHS.  When I discovered this I had to have it on DVD!  The story is incredibly deep and was influential in how I saw the world growing up.  This is a must have for any fans of the Little Prince!,1510617600,,243,3.82
7860089,5,6304039891,"As a high school teacher, my students are at first ""shocked, slightly freaked"" by the colorful clay, but a few minutes in and they are totally engaged.  What I love about this is that it does a great job at covering the whole story in a short time.  Other full length versions really drag.  My students read excerpts (but not the whole book) and then watch this to have it all come together.  Then they can watch the new version that isn't completely true to the book and ""get it.""",1479081600,,481,4.311111111111111
7860090,5,6304039891,This has always been my absolute favorite rendition of this story. I love the claymation. And growing up this was the first time I had ever even heard this story. It will always be the first thing I think Of when thinking of The Little Prince. And I will absolutely be showing my kids. When I have kids...,1461456000,,305,4.275862068965517

7860092,4,6304039891,"Thoughtfully brought to lilfe through Claymation animation, Antoine de Saint-Exupry's book comes to life through the narration of Cliff Robertson.

7860093,5,6304039891,"Has become my brilliant 10 yr old granddaughter's new fav book. This kid has read, re-read and can tell you full stories of ALL CS Lewis Chronicles of Narnia. Imagination huge which I love and nurture. She had her grandmother read it first. Could not stop. Now she re-reads going to bed early read all of it, sleep every other weekend now. Strange I never knew of the book; my wife loved it as a child. I have movie, from tv, first book, and now this version. GREAT!",1415145600,,466,4.306818181818182

7860096,2,6304039891,"Having recently purchased most of Vinton's classics, and being a big fan of ""The adventures of Mark Twain"", I was a little surprised by this one. Children are unlikely to fully understand ""The Little Prince"", unless they are somewhat like the Simpson's Martin Prince. Watching this was for me one of those wtf (why the face?) moments. It was just, well odd, but not the sort of fascinating odd, that would see me watching this again.

These films, along with Martin the Cobbler, are only 27 minutes long. And it's about a boy, from another planet, who misses his talking flower. Enough said.",1273276800,,591,4.737864077669903
7860097,5,6304039891,This is the best animated version of my favorite book ever. I love the narration by Cliff Robertson. It's so entransing. My children love it.,1269043200,2,141,4.68
