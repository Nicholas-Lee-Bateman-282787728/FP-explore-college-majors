8563039,5,B00B5UBDNC,"Since there's very little information on the Amazon webpage about this 4-DVD set of Mozart piano concerto's, I'm posting this review primarily to get you the details. This 4-DVD set is a Bargain, price wise, and it makes a great gift idea for sure. The other interesting thing, is that you get to see an assortment of well-known pianists, back in their younger days. Almost all the performances are from 1990 and 1991. So this is a re-packaging, reissue, of material EuroArts recorded back in the day. The video is standard def., but it's fine. They had already figured out the camera needs to be on the piano keyboard & pianist, cutting to the orchestral instrumentalist when he/she has a bit. The audio choices are PCM Stereo, Dolby 5.1, or DTS 5.1.

Here are in order, the concerto's, the pianist, the orchestra, the conductor:

Piano Concerto No. 9 , K.271, 'Jeunehomme' / Mitsuko Uchida / Mozarteum Orchester Salzburg / Jeffrey Tate
