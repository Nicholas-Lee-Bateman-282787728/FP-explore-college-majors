5463275,4,B00AOCDE8O,"I saw this film at the Rehobeth Film Festival and loved it.  When I watched it a second time with my husband, it was disappointing.  Maybe because I already knew the story line.  My husband thought that the story was too contrived and most of the actors looked way past the 75 years they were portraying.",1361145600,,304,4.392857142857143
5463276,5,B00AOCDE8O,"ALL TOGETHER (Et si on vivait tous ensemble?) is an important French film written and directed by Stphane Robelin that addresses the ever more important question of aging. People are living longer and while that has its benefits it also poses problems not only for the aging population who must learn to cope with their diminishing facilities but also for the families of those who may not be content with their fading importance and individuality. In other words, how will we each cope with getting old without loved ones that are willing to hold our hand and be comfortably at our side until the end? Films such as this are being created more frequently (The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel form this year also addressed similar issues as The Bucket Plan and other in the recent past). Where ALL TOGETHER differs is in the honest way the feelings and expectations and coping codes are managed with dignity without losing the lightness of comedy.

Annie (Geraldine Chaplin) Jean (Guy Bedos) are a married couple who live in a home large enough to accommodate others: their grandchildren no longer visits, a fact the Annie feels could be rectifies by building a swimming pool but Jean objects:  Claude (Claude Berhnard) is reaching 75 and since his wife died he has been satisfying his needs with hookers until a heart attack impedes his performance abilities and he must seek pharmacologic enhancement;  Albert (Pierre Richard) has Alzheimer's and is increasingly forgetful while his wife Jeanne (Jane Fonda) is hiding the fact that she has terminal cancer while at the same time planning her own rather lighthearted pink coffin funeral. These five 70ish people have been friends for over forty years. But they are growing old and old age tends to be synonymous with reduced autonomy, loss of memory, illness, retirement home and, worst of all, separation. One day, one of the five friends suggests saying no to isolation and loneliness: what if they lived together? How this group of friends, with their accompanying old secrets and jealousies, interact in the new development of living in Annie and Jean's home - with the added assistance from young ethnology student Dirk (Daniel Brhl) who happens to be writing a thesis on the aging population - results in many credible, tender stories of need and interaction in the `golden years.' An uplifting film about the better aspects of growing old - with friends.  Grady Harp, October 12",1350691200,6,2431,4.950980392156863
5463277,4,B00AOCDE8O,"Yes, this is what we all must face eventually.  Lovingly handled with such honesty so as to not be maudlin. More true to life than ""Marigold"" and thereby not as depressing in the end.  We need more such films.",1350604800,,209,4.333333333333333

5463285,5,B00AOCDE8O,"Very well done movie that was enjoyable to watch.  French film with subtitles.  Addresses the issues of the increasing mental and physical frailties of the elderly plus the wrenching emotion of loneliness and social isolation that sometimes attends one's final years.  Jane Fonda's character has terminal cancer, her husband is in early stages of dementia, another gentleman is rehabilitating from a heart attack.  If this sounds depressing, well there is hope and laughter in this film as a group of elderly friends decide to live communally in a single house.  A young grad student joins them to gather data for his thesis and he becomes a helpful and compassionate member of the group.  Funny, sad, hopeful and worth watching.  These old people are young at heart and still need love, respect, touch and dignified treatment.",1401667200,3,827,5.0814814814814815

5463287,5,B00AOCDE8O,"This is a lovely little movie. It touched on age in a way that makes it endearing, frightening, nostalgic, sweet, frustrating, lonely, vulnerable, uplifting, even surprising. There is a quiet carpe diem quality to their days that comes across as sublimely real. It's a strong cast, one of the glories of age, a realized self, but Jane Fonda and Geraldine Chaplin are especially evocative as Jeanne and Annie.",1396656000,,408,5.014705882352941

5463289,4,B00AOCDE8O,What a fantastic cast.  This was a very funny movie that had a lot of great surprising turns.  Need a quick laugh?  This is a good one.,1383004800,,135,3.925925925925926
5463290,4,B00AOCDE8O,"Five older friends, choose to live together instead of living in nursing care facilities. Their children are opposed to their ""living"" ideas. It is a peak into the future for most people. Their health deteriorating, they realize that they should be there together to bolster each other up and encourage each other in their late life.

In the process of living, a young man helps them and writes his thesis on their life, documenting their hardships and their joys. His conversations with the character Jeanne embarrasses him as she talks of sexuality freely.

Even if you are not (like me) a fan of Jane Fonda for political reasons, still enjoy the movie and all its realistic situations. It is sad that some people think that the elderly lose their sexuality and become a-sexual. In fact it is not true and this movie makes these people in their 70s more approachable and real. It might offend some but it is real.

Leaving the water in the tub running to overflow, forgetting and repeating sentences, doctor visits, pains and aches, medications distributed, all these situations brings this reality closer. It was well done without horror. As true to life as possible with some drama for entertainment, this is a good movie.",1381276800,,1226,4.856459330143541
5463291,5,B00AOCDE8O,"I watched this on Netflix streaming last night and now I want to own it. I will show it to the film club I run in my senior community, on End of Life Concerns. Over all, the concerns of old people, about their own debilities, about needing loving friends, about dying was well done. I thought there was too much emphasis on sex in old age, but Jane Fonda's chats with the young ethnologist on that subject were surprising and delightful. What guts she has! Her character's husband had dementia, which was played too much for laughs; I thought he needed to be institutionalized (or euthanized; that would be my own preference).  It was fascinating to listen to Jane Fonda speaking very good French. She lived in France when she was younger, married a French film director, Roger Vadim. They had a daughter, Vanessa, now Fonda's closest friend, I've read. Geraldine Chaplin, Charlie and Oona's daughter, was raised in Europe. She shows up in American movies speaking American, Spanish movies speaking Spanish, French movies speaking French. When will she get around to Dutch or Polish? This film is a welcome fresh take on growing old and dying. If I hadn't already willed my body to medical science, I would opt for the pink casket.",1373328000,,1231,4.752336448598131
5463292,5,B00AOCDE8O,"So beautifully acted, directed, scripted and edited it is near perfection.

It is first about friendship and the courage of fidelity and compassion in long friendship with those fast losing their mental and physical abilities. The surprising last scene of this movie is such  a powerful and uplifting expression of that it pried  my heart open in huge deep sobs of gratitude. It is secondarily about five aging friends who commit to trying to help each other face disability together at home and not in a nursing home.

Definitely one for a home library and a great gift for your local community library.  Also a great page opener for support group or family discussions about the increasing difficulties of living alone without support at home and a great proposal, consideration of possible joint living situations with people we cherish.

And who knew Jane Fonda spoke such flawless French!!!",1372291200,,895,5.013513513513513
5463293,4,B00AOCDE8O,This movie is a very different story about five active senior citizens in France. I love  the interacting between the main characters.,1371600000,,134,5.090909090909091
5463294,4,B00AOCDE8O,"Jane Fonda, playing Jeanne in this French film is searching for her coffin, she wants 'something jollier', something in pink!  'All Together' is a film about five 70'year old long time friends. They're all getting older, some becoming forgetful, some ill and they need each other.

The USA film about growing older, needing help and assistance and the love of friends. The philosophy rings true, but there is a lot missing in this film. Jane Fonda is the liveliest, who brings humor and love to the group. Her husband, Pierre Richards, plays forgetful, Albert. Geraldine Chaplin plays Annie and her husband, Guy Bedos, plays Jean. Claude Rich plays Claude, the old Bon vivant who lives alone and is the incentive for moving in together. Of course, incidents happen, tempers fray and life is not a bed of roses. A tragic incident brings them all together, finally, and it left me wondering who will be left, ad who will take care of the last one.

Terrific acting, but the storyline needed a great deal more. Something was off, the individual acting was superb, but not all together.  I, too, wanted something jollier!

5463296,5,B00AOCDE8O,"Good script, good acting, about the hang-ups, trials and tribulations, and ultimately about the bonds of friendship of this group of long-time friends in a French town. A terminal health condition, sexual triangles and confisions, Alzheimer's, insensitive sons and daughters, memories and illusions are cleverly mixed into a sensitive and touching tale.",1367798400,,353,5.8076923076923075
5463297,4,B00AOCDE8O,"""All Together"" is the tale of two older married couples, Jeanne and Albert (Jane Fonda, Pierre Richard) and Annie and Jean (Geraldine Chaplin, Guy Bedos), and two friends who move in together thinking they would be better off taking care of each other than relying on an assisted living facility.  Enter a young Hungarian graduate student (Daniel Bruhl) who films their experiment in senior living for his research project while also serving as unofficial caretaker.

Director Stephane Robelin includes a number of funny scenes of seniors behaving badly, but the film goes deeper than easy laughs.  It is about holding onto one's dignity as one ages when society treats senior citizens as nearly invisible.  The discussions of the group cover self-dependence, illness, sexual desires, and unexpected revelations. The ensemble work of the cast is terrific.  Fonda looks at least 25 years younger than her 75 years.  This is her first French film since 1972, and her French is precise and natural.

Special features on this DVD release, in French with English subtitles, include a stills gallery and theatrical trailers.",1365379200,,1118,5.212290502793296
