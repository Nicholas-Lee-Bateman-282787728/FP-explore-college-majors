2651433,5,B000I2J6MS,"I have been looking for the True Life Adventures on DVD for a long time.  I called Disney a few years ago and then said that they at that time had no plans of producing them.  So I looked on Ebay for used 16mm sound prints will little findings.

I'm very glad that they are now producing them on DVD they quality of the picture and sound is much better that the 16mm prints that I remember in garde school.  A job will done and a long time waiting..",1169164800,28,449,4.01123595505618
2651434,2,B000I2J6MS,"Ever since ""The Jungle Cat"" aired on Wonderful World of Disney when I was a child, I have been trying to acquire more of these wonderfully photographed wildlife ""documentaries"" in the True-Life Adventure Series.  They are obviously staged, but well done for the times.  So why only 2 stars?  Another reviewer has written that Disney does not discuss the fact that they killed a few dozen lemmings in the making of ""White Wilderness.""  It is not confirmed that Disney knew what the principle photographer was doing, but it seems that, if that were the case, they would not be afraid to discuss the issue.  I am not buying this volume, as I would never want my children to learn myths (that lemmings commit suicide) about the animal kingdom, and I do not want Disney to think that I condone what they did.  For more information about ""White Wilderness"" and the forced lemming suicide, see [...].",1168819200,10,893,4.7290322580645165
2651435,3,B000I2J6MS,"This is a wonderfully created documentary, that is why I gave it 3 stars. I did not give it 5 stars because nobody, and particularly Mr. Roy Disney, mentions (explains) a word about highly spoken about and written about controversial lemmings scenes when the supposedly suicidal animals plunge off the cliffs to the ocean and die. The Internet is full of stories telling the grim scenario about how the lemmings were bought by the Disney filmmakers from the innuits, scared, and then PUSHED OFF the cliffs to photograph the lemming's mass suicide - thus creating a, as it appears erronious, theory just to be perpetuated for years by medias. IS the lemmings suicidal scene a fact or an uneasy to explain by the Disney executives self-created myth that should be explained to the audiences as soon as possible to avoid backlash of hate letters...

Personally, as a parent, I would feel much more comfortable watching this films with my children knowing that certain scene ought to be skipped so the young minds do not learn false facts... never mind the reasons why the facts were falsified - that is somebody elses job.",1168128000,13,1119,4.828125
2651436,5,B000I2J6MS,I remembered these from my childhood. The quality is excellent. A must own for anyone wishing to own high quality nature footage. I bought all 4 collections. I recommend them all without reservation. You won't be disappointed.,1165881600,18,226,5.135135135135135
2651437,5,B000I2J6MS,"mit vielfach bahnbrechender Kameratechnik. Man kann Disney schon als den Vater der Tierdokumentationen bezeichnen - das berhmteste ""True Life Adventure"" ist brigens ""Die Wste lebt"" (Living Desert). Interessanterweise habe ich Anfang dieses Jahres begonnen, die Filme, zu denen ich im Bertelsmann Lesering erschienene Bcher aus den 50-er-Jahren habe, berall zu suchen. ""Tal der Biber"", ""Land der Bren"", ""Wunder der Natur"", in welchem man sich brigens auch auf die Erkenntnisse von Max von Frisch bezieht, und wie sie alle heien. Kopfschttelnd musste ich feststellen, dass es diese preisgekrnten Filme nicht einmal auf VHS gibt, geschweige denn auf DVD. Unfassbar!, dachte ich, sind die wahnsinnig? Wie knnen sie nur solche Juwelen der Filmkunst vermodern lassen? Dann habe ich hier beim amerikanischen Amazon langsam Suchergebnisse reinbekommen ""True Life A... + Disney"" ohne nhere Information, was sich darauf befinden wrde - 4 DVDs. Ich dachte sofort: Das sind sie! und habe sie gleich vorbestellt. Mit den Monaten kamen immer mehr Informationen + sogar Bilder der DVD-Hllen dazu und jetzt muss ich sagen: Ich kann's gar nicht mehr erwarten. Das sind ja alle Filme, die damals unter dem Titel ""Abenteuer im Reiche der Natur"" gedreht wurden! Ich freue mich schon so! Ich kann schon halbwegs Englisch, aber in Deutsch ist es doch leichter fr mich. Aber gut: Yappadappadu!! :-)",1161302400,13,1375,5.429906542056075
2651438,5,B000I2J6MS,"I can't wait to see the original film again. I remember seeing the lemmings plunging into the sea. Thus was born the inspiration for the great PC game, Lemmings. Nevertheless I love this movie. I hope that they don't cut the lemming sequence. Disney has promised a full restoration. Other animals that left a strong impression on me were the musk oxen in a circle being blasted with an Arctic blizzard. Also the lives of polar bears and walruses among others are filmed. The hardships of an Arctic existence were beautifully photographed.",1160611200,12,538,4.858695652173913
2651459,1,B000I2J6MS,"I absolutely love Walt Disney World, I go every year, and I especially appreciate Walt himself. But what I will not take is the form of animal abuse that was put into this movie. What people don't know is that  Disney paid kids in Churchill, Manitoba, to catch lemmings, then transported them to non-habitat in Alberta where a turntable flung them off a cliff and into ""the sea"" by the dozens. See for yourself: [...]",1320105600,5,417,4.56
2651460,5,B000I2J6MS,"The reason TLA Vol 1 and Vol 4 are out of print is because they both had issues and require replacement disks to fix the issues.  Prowlers of the Everglades had two of the color channels reversed and Secrets of Life is supposed to transition to widescreen for the final reel. I'm guessing Disney must have pulled them from stores and discontinued them. I think it is unfair to charge exorbitant prices for a defective disk that requires replacement.  Hopefully they will eventually be released on Blu-ray someday.  If you've seen the restored Grand Canyon on the Sleeping Beauty Blu-ray, you'll know the improvement would be well worth the effort.",1318550400,14,647,4.863636363636363
2651461,5,B000I2J6MS,Educational entertainment of the best kind for the whole family and in fact for everyone. And volume one was extremely difficult and costly to find but well worth every dollar spent and without the Amazon Network It would have been next to Impossible to obtain a copy,1295222400,,267,4.702127659574468
2651462,4,B000I2J6MS,"I really don't know what to say about True Life Adventures volume one. I love wildlife and I grew up with Walt Disney so when I found out Walt Disney had made wildlife documentaries I was very excited. Look I know everyone is sick of the lemming controversy, but I just don't understand why anyone would do this. In the program ""White Wilderness"" a scene depicts a mass lemming migration, and ends with the lemmings jumping off a cliff to their deaths in the ocean. Now the program never says the lemmings are attempting suicide, they say when many of the lemmings encounter water during their migration, they may try to cross, but if the water they attempt to cross is too wide they will sooner or later drown. The actual problem with this scene is in the actual shot not the narration, it has been said that the lemmings were pushed in the water by a rotating platform installed by the Walt Disney film crew. But many people hastily blame the entire Walt Disney Studios for this, but you can't blame an entire studio for a few filmmakers' mistakes. Now look, despite this scene's inaccuracy, we must remember these programs helped people develop a love for animals. True Life Adventures was a breakthrough in wildlife documentaries, and the footage is still amazing.

This collection is truly impressive. Walt Disney's Legacy Edition resembles Walt Disney Treasures but the real difference is in the packaging. Very creative and durable to say the least, and it will indeed look impressive on your shelf. A ""passport"" is placed inside the tin can and it shows where each film from volume one is located. For the beginning of the disc, there is a short introduction by Roy Disney and after that you can select four True Life Adventures, which I'll list below.

White Wilderness (1958)

Water Birds (1952)

Beaver Valley (1950)

Prowlers of the Everglades (1953)

But those aren't the only wildlife documentaries, for some strange reason two of the wildlife films aren't credited as a True Life Adventure but their filmed exactly the same and Winston Hilber still narrates. They're included on disc two and they are;

Mysteries of the Deep (1959)

Wonders of the Water Worlds (1961)

While this set does not have an extensive amount of bonus material, there still is quite a lot. ""The Crisler Story"" is a behind the scenes look of the filming of ""White Wilderness."" The Crisler's filmed scenes of ""White Wilderness"" and this excerpt from the Disneyland TV show shows the struggles they went through. There also is a short feature with Roy Disney at Disney's Animal Kingdom. He meets a few animal trainers and there birds. Now if you want to learn more about the actual True Life Adventures series, ""Filmmakers' Journal"" is the feature for you. It features interviews with some of the filmmakers and composers. It's only twenty-three minutes but I learned quite a bit. There also is a tribute to the director of the True Life Adventures series, James Algar; it's very brief but interesting. Also included is a feature entitled ""Collector's Corner"", a Disney historian shows us some of the rare collector's items from the True Life Adventures series, and last of all the original theatrical trailers for three of the films is included. So as you can see, these bonus features are very interesting and they'll give you some insight on this very interesting wildlife series.

My love of animals made me buy True Life Adventures, and my love of animals makes me easily take off a star because of the lemming scene, but it still has its place as one of the most important wildlife documentaries ever made.",1279670400,5,3599,4.79967689822294

2651464,5,B000I2J6MS,"Disney's True-Life Adventure Series is truly timeless!  It is sad to hear that they have stopped producing them.  They are a wonderful way for children, particularly urban children, to learn about the natural world in which they live.  I used them extensively with my primary level students and they always enjoyed them AND they always learned something new each time they saw one of the episodes. Winston Hibler's narration is perfect.  Every grandparent should have this whole set to show their young grandchildren.",1274140800,3,517,5.192771084337349

2651466,5,B000I2J6MS,"I've read the criticisms of these sets, and agree that many scenes are probably staged, some to the detriment of the animals.  However, the True Life adventures are well done and loved by children and adults.  They are not preachy and they do not tell us of the evils of man.  They simply encourage a love of nature and the wonderful world God has given us. Kids will hear about the way mankind has misused nature from other sources and because of the love of nature they developed, in part, from this series, perhaps they will be motivated to do something about it.  I wish the execs at Disney would create more just like these.",1196380800,5,629,4.443478260869565
2651467,5,B000I2J6MS,"Disney did a marvelous job on restoring these nature classics, I get transported back to my childhood everytime I watch them. They are far more interesting than todays so called wild life shows, as they concentrate on the wild life and not some self centered celebrity host (no offence to the memory of the late great Steve Irwin). Now to the ""but..."" part. Does anyone else but me find that Disney did a LOUSY job on the packaging? Cheap cardboard and plastic containers, that cannot be displayed properly on a bookshelf with the other Disney Treasures! What was wrong with the original clamshell cases? I was thoroughly p.o'd with the packaging, however the movies are excellent. 5 out of 5, Packaging 1 out of 5!!!!",1188691200,4,718,4.752
2651468,5,B000I2J6MS,"Could you rate it a 10 or 100. Who couldn't love Disney's True Adventures. Yes, there is even a whole channel for animal adventures now, but they were the first--and they were the best. They are pack in a great package; durable and imaginative. The added interviews and backstage scenes are great. I can remember seeing them on their program (in black and white) when I was in first grade. They are wonderful. It was a treat to learn about the couple who filmed them too. Spending years and years filming things they thought was funny or interesting. Then bringing them back and someone putting them together into a story that is loved forever. I have all four of them. And we watch them over and over.",1187913600,7,702,4.535433070866142
