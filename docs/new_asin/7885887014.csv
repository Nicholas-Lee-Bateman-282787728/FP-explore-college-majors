1140860,5,7885887014,"I put this movie on par with ""Twelve Angry Men"" for its characterizations. And it is the characters of any great movie or novel that we remember, with the plot being secondary.

I watched this movie way back in the early 1960s on our old B/W Zenith TV. And this movie was fascinating then to me as a teen-ager.  Later on, when I enrolled in a journalism program, I recommended this film to our class as required viewing.  But the teacher was not at all warm to the idea.  Can't imagine why. :-)

This is Kirk Douglas at his very finest. If you liked his son, Michael Douglas, in ""Wall Street"" check out this flick for an earlier rendition of what was/is wrong with the world of journalism.

The quality of the recording has deminished over the years but not the content.

I know most of the lines off by heart but they still have an impact that is both gripping and bitingly satirical.

This isn't just one of Billy Wilder's best it surely ranks amongst the best 1950's Americana made by anyone.

1140864,5,7885887014,"This film was way ahead of its time, as were most of Billy Wilder's movies. I saw it for the first and only time on TV in the early sixties when I was 12 or 13 years old and it had a profound affect on me that has led me on a search for this great film on DVD. It is a fascinating study of some of the least admirable aspects of human nature. I won't say too much because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but might otherwise be a Billy Wilder fan who never had the opportunity to see it. But you don't have to be a fan of Billy Wilder to enjoy this hard-hitting, insightful, prescient film. I still have vivid memories of parts of this movie even though it has been over 40 years since I saw it. It rings truer today than it did in 1951 or in the early sixties when I was fortunate to see it. A rock solid 5 in my corner of the movie universe. Enjoy!",1149465600,2,873,3.8287292817679557
1140865,5,7885887014,"This is a great, great movie...bringing together two geniuses of cynicism, Billy Wilder and Kirk Douglas, at their most cynical.

Even more important, along with two other 1950's masterpieces, All The Kings Men and A Face in the Crowd, The Big Carnival is a devastating commentary on populist media.  With the election-swaying power of present day pundits like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'reilly, this sort of uncompromising exploration of American culture has never been more relevant, or needed.",1104624000,7,494,5.32051282051282

The sad truth is that ACE was way too ahead of its time, offering nothing but grim cynicism and brutal reality. Nobody wanted to see the awful effects of media sensationalism until the 1970's.",1093478400,7,457,4.871794871794871
1140867,5,7885887014,"Billy Wilder made this film after Sunset Blvd(1950) and before Stalag 17(1953), two of his most popular works. He once referred to ""Ace"" as ""the runt of my litter"". It is one of the most brilliant films to come out of Hollywood in the early 1950's.
The idea of a newspaper man covering the story of a trapped miner, exploiting and managing the ""rescue"" in order  to sell the story to  the media, was way ahead of it's time, which is why the picture flopped at the box office.
The people at Paramount don't seem to value the artistry inherent in this masterpiece. They  probably only look at the numbers and figure, ""well, it didn't make any money in 1951, so it won't make any now if we release it on DVD""
But they are wrong. This is a cult classic and on every film buff's must-have list.
Besides the acting and direction and the bitterly pungent screenplay, the arid b&w cinematography of Charles Lang and the moody, impressionist, noir music score by Hugo Friedhofer are absolutely perfect for this story.
By all means, write a letter to Paramount Home Video and demand that this film is given a DVD release. You can get their address from their website. I wrote them last year and they said there were no plans to release it.  So that means waiting for it to show up on Turner Classic Movies, where I last saw it about 3 years ago.
But if they get enough letters, well, you never know...............",1052697600,17,1403,4.46875
1140868,5,7885887014,"ACE IN THE HOLE (the studio renamed THE BIG CARNIVAL when it bombed upon rerelease) is Billy Wilder's forgotten masterpiece.  Along with Ernst Lubitsch's ONE HOUR WITH YOU and the films of British comic Will Hay, this has long topped my own personal wish list of films that have never been available either on DVD or VHS in the United States (Hay's films are at least available on DVD in Great Britain).  To have it appear at last not only on DVD but in a two-disc Criterion edition is truly a wish come true.  This will easily go down as one of the most important DVD releases of 2007.

This is among Billy Wilder's greatest films, though this has been long forgotten because the film bombed so badly at the box office (financially it was by far Wilder's worst film, lossing a great deal of money).  Anyone who has seen many Billy Wilder films knows that he had a dark side and that while he would turn out many of the greatest comedies in the history of film, he could also turn out some of the bleakest films ever made.  Moreover, even some of his comedies contain many cynical elements.  ACE IN THE HOLE is the most despairing film Bill Wilder ever made.

The plot is simple.  A former ace reporter is so far down on his luck that he has taken a job on a tiny New Mexico newspaper.  When a man gets trapped in a mine collapse, he sees an opportunity to resurrect his career.  On the inside, he crawls through the collapsed mine to the spot where the miner is trapped, interviewing him, bringing him food and water, befriending him, and giving him hope and comfort.  On the outside, he has an affair with the miner's wife, writes a series of stories about the miner that creates a national media frenzy, and manipulates rescue operations to delay the man's release by a few days so that he will have more time to milk the story.  The great tension in the story arrives from his cold-blooded manipulation of the man's situation on the one hand, and the enormous guilt he suffers from the expressions of friendship and appreciation from the man who is trapped.  Meanwhile, outside the mine, thousands and thousands of onlookers collect, to the point where it has become a virtual city, complete with souvenir sellers and even carnival rides (hence part of the meaning of the original title).

Kirk Douglas has made very, very man great movies in his great career, but I am not sure he was ever better than in this one.  Although the movie has a cast of thousands, there are only three truly crucial characters:  Douglas's reporter, the man trapped in the mine, and the miner's wife.  But of the three, it is Douglas who has to carry the film on his back.  And he does so magnificently.

In every way, a very great movie.  My hope is that it will come to be recognized as the great film it is along with other box office failures that have since come to be recognized as classics such as BRINGING UP BABY and THE GENERAL.  This is a film that simply must be seen by every fan of the movies.",1027728000,48,2990,4.4178832116788325

1140959,5,7885887014,"So, you wonder how the convoluted, off the track ""news reporting"" of today came to be? Billy Wilder had it figured 56 years ago. I first saw this film as part of a college Journalism Ethics class in 1967. It burns the soul like a cauterizing welding torch even today as I watch the journalism trade that I ended up working in devolve into the Fox/Hannity/Limbaugh/CBN/Hooray for Trump because he brings us all such good ratings mentality of modern times.
Doughas and Jan Sterling have never been better.
PARENTS: Modern rating would be a PG. Hays code standards of 1950 keep bad language out and suppress the sexual innuendo of some of this story. One nasty man-slaps-woman scene.

1141019,1,7885887014,"The Big Carnival (that's what it was listed as in the T.V.Guide) was a favorite of my sister Susie and I when we were kids, we never missed it.

The fun in collecting DVD's is finding movies like this, and adding them to my collection. This film was a tuff one to add, i could never find a copy for less than 20 bucks (i'm a bargain hunter) until yesterday when i found a clean Criterion copy for $7.99 at Atomic Records in beautiful Burbank, California! ... a copy was finally mine! ... one to show my grandchild, if i ever have one! ... and then to my horror ... i went home and watched it!

Before my eyes, one of the most ridiculous, unbelievable movies unfolded in front of me! .. Kirk Douglas plays a big time Reporter who now works for a small newspaper, that allows him to insult the Boss, and every employee, for e reasons that are never quite made clear, everyone just sits there and takes it from this absolute Gas Bag of a man!

So Chuck Tatum grudgingly accepts an assignment reporting a rattlesnake hunt, on his way to the event, he runs across an unusually relaxed woman who tells him her husband is trapped in a mine near the miserable roadside dive they now live, Chuck decides to check it out, crawls in the mine, finds the unlucky schmuck who will now be dependent on Chuck, who will become the man in charge of the entire rescue effort!  and as we will soon find out, saving this mans life is not at the top of Chucks priority list! . aside from bringing the guy coffee and CIGARS!  Chuck spends most of his time corrupting the Sheriff and the Driller, having hot, steamy, tension filled non-sex with with the victims apathetic, hot blonde wife!  who is Chucks equal opportunist! . and writing sensational headlines for what is now the biggest story in America  so Chuck decides to take the most time consuming and worst approach to bring this man out alive  so that Chuck can bask in the limelight, a little while longer!

Now I know 1951 was a long time ago, but I refuse to believe everyone around Albuquerque, NM was that stupid!  to let one loudmouth city boy push them around, is absurd!  i could not in any way believe this movie!  Ive decided Im not going to show it to my grandchild, if i ever have one!

1141026,5,7885887014,"Get this story line right out of todays mad social media driven desperate cry for recognition in a sullen, indifferent world.  A hard-nosed, hard-hitting newspaper reporter who liked his liquor, liked his women, liked to live close to the edge on a story, hell was willing to go over the top six ways to Sunday in order to sell the bosss newspapers (and he was not particular about which boss as long as he go that by-line, got that big fat check). Get this too was willing, way more than willing to throw the truth out with bath water in order to keep the story humming for a few extra days, or until the juice was sucked out of the damn thing. Of course guys (gals too but our protagonist is a guy on this one) like our boy, Chuck, Chuck Tatum, maybe you read his by-line when he was riding the big wave, who live for wine, women, song and a big chunk of fame have a habit over going over the edge a little too much for the city editors of most newspapers taste which has caused him to be thrown off half the best newspapers in the country.

As we hone in on the story line Chuck is cooling his heels out in Albuquerque, on some nowhere square dink newspaper where the editor/owner thinks you should tell the truth straight and without the garnish, funny guy right. Finds himself out there where the states are square and the people left to their own resources by their own choice had better treat one another square, and be square or else. So our big city reporter was just looking for that one little story to ride him back to the big time, to easy street, what the heck maybe to that Pulitzer Prize that has eluded him all these years.

And lo and behold out in the middle of Podunk on his way to cover yet another hoe-down or picnic in the boondocks Chuck gets his lucky break, a story a real live human interest story, the kind that people stop whatever they are doing to follow, the one that has them on the phone telling one and all their exact opinion of what is happening, with baited breathe. Here is the beauty of this one, a guy, a regular Joe (although his name is Leo but nobody cares about the name as much as the one-on-one human interest about what is happening to some poor sap who is in more trouble than they are, not much more was caught in a cave looking for relics around the mountains which the local Indians, oops Native Americans, you know the native peoples and needs help getting out, help which in the normal scheme of events would take a few hours and done. Except our boy Chuck smelled this for a million dollar story anyway you cut it, a story that every poor sucker who reads the newspapers form Podunk to New Jack City could relate to, if he can keep the thing alive long enough to draw an audience. So the catch is too get the guy out, but not too some. Through some very devious methods and some pure high-handed power-plays Chuck shows his reckless expertise, gets so wrapped up in the thing that he can see the bright lights of the city as fast  as he can write, and finagle things so that he gets exclusives, the almighty exclusives that separate the pros from the amateurs in the newspaper business. The key though was to keep that story going and that is where everything turned to dross in the end. See Chuck ordered the rescue crews to do the rescuing of poor sap Leo the long way round, you know, to keep the story going, has the crowds attracted by his stories coming out to observe the human drama in person on edge, has made the whole thing a  media circus. Key to that was getting Leo tough/hard as nails/sexy snake of a wife to work the ropes with him. And she, Lorraine, like all blonde Lorraines played her part well once our boy Chuck who, frankly, seemed to have been hard on his women, got under her skin (and gave her the franchise in the gathering circus end of the game). Of course there was a down side to Chucks scheming since Leo refused to cooperate by getting a little short of breath waiting for that long way around digging to get to him, yeah the poor guy  folded up under the cave-in pressure and didn't last long enough to get the big headline. Great big fifteen minutes of fame story if there ever was one.

Sounds like any other news story of today 24/7/367 media frenzy of the moment though, right. Wrong this is the skinny, the real skinny this one came in 1951. This one is famed director Billy Wilders (he the super-max daddy director of the close up sordid underbelly look at old time Hollywood in Sunset Boulevard) Ace In The Hole as he takes a big swing at the newspaper business in the days when that medium ruled the roost of mass communication and when like today with the expansive social media mega-reach the notion of all the news that fit to print hinged on how many paper it would sell. Kirk Douglas as the cranky, over-the-top news hound Chuck gives a very good performance here as does Jan Sterling as Lorraine, that hustling wife of poor old Leo. Hey, I didn't tell you the ending, the real ending not poor schmuck Leos running out of air but Chucks. In the end Chuck got religion (helped by a friendly mortal wound from Lorraine when he decided one more time to play rough with her), see before he too passed from the scene he realized that he had gone over the edge, had set something in motive better left to the fates. Yeah, thats the real cautionary tale sixty some years later.",1440979200,,5372,4.323412698412699

""Network"" may be mad as hell and ""A Face in the Crowd"" may show that we are all ""guinea pigs"", but none of those films come close to the venom, the precision, the bile and the relevance of Billy Wilder's ""Ace in the Hole"". A visionary film noir that came out over 60 years ago, this morbid masterpiece by one of the greatest directors of all time could have come out today and still seem germane, especially in the age of the Internet and social media.

What is so great about ""Ace in the Hole"" is the lack of sentimentality. There is no one to root for, not a single person to identify, no hero to relate to. Nobody in this film is good: not the idiot crowd who buys into the story, not the corrupt sheriff seeking positive publicity, not the wife seeking to make money, not the gullible construction contractor who continues to dig from above and slow down the rescue process and certainly not the amoral news reporter (played by Kirk Douglas, in probably his greatest and most ferocious performance of his career) who exploits an innocent victim to get his story first. This is a nasty, repulsive film, destined to invoke disgust at the characters who have no moral decency and turn a person's tragedy into a grotesque spectacle for their own amusement. Does this all sound familiar? To anyone who has read about the scandals, the tragedies and the gossip epics involving the likes of Michael Jackson, Terri Schiavo, Mumia Abu-Jamal and Daniel Faulkner, Trayon Martin, Watergate, the Iran-Contra affair, Casey Anthony, the Presidential elections, Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky and most recently, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, it should.

""Ace in the Hole"" is the kind of film that Hollywood could never made today, not because it is antithetical to what we think of Hollywood movies, but because when we watch ""Ace in the Hole"" and we see ourselves, we can't watch and deal with it. You look at the scenes where the public is having fun at the expense of one person's suffering and then you watch the reporters obsessed with stories, the Internet news sites and its ""opinionated"" comment sections that distort them and the ungrateful attention seekers who perform ""selfies"" in the midst of a serious event today and a film once dismissed as overly cynical and exaggerating now seems prescient and prophetic. It is an angry film, but a damn honest one.

Of all the Billy Wilder films, ""Ace in the Hole"" was the film I've been trying to get for years and Criterion delivers the goods with this impressive Blu-Ray/DVD edition. In addition to excellent image and audio qualities, the supplements are equally impressive. There's a 1980 documentary film centered on Billy Wilder and how he worked within the Hollywood studio system, a collection of excerpts from an archival interview with Wilder at the American Film Institute in 1986 and an afterword by director Spike Lee discussing the film and how that (along with ""A Face in the Crowd"") remains important to this day. ""Ace in the Hole"" is truly a film that belongs in every movie lover's collection, especially if you love Wilder as I do.",1417996800,2,3201,4.753597122302159

ACE is a film so hard-hitting that it chills some 60 years after it's release; a film so cynical, acidic, and brutal that it has survived the test of time - indeed, becoming more relevant every day it ages. Billy Wilder's story of journalism and the media gone wrong is one that holds special weight in our modern society, and everything from the acting, to the razor-sharp script, to the cinematography and score (To this day, I still remember the tune to ""Leo, Leo, Leo, Leeeooo!"") comes together to make an unforgettable gut-punch of a  masterpiece.

Kirk Douglas's electrifying performance as Chuck Tatum is still among cinema's greatest. In particular, it is his moralless, qualmless opportunism that sticks in the mind: ""I can handle big news and little news. And if there's no news, I'll go out and bite a dog."" The film centres around Douglas's character, a washed-up, cynical journalist who, when working for a small-town news agency, finds his big break: a man stuck in a cave. Exploiting the situation for his benefit, the incident spirals out of control into a media circus.

This is but the stage for a razor-sharp, darkly comic, exquisitely constructed masterpiece from Billy Wilder. Wilder above all directors had that talent to make his films ""stick"". 64 years after Sunset Boulevard hit theatres, we are still enthralled by that story of forgotten fame, and 63 years from the release of Ace in the Hole, audiences are still having their insides turn and jaws drop, at the sight of a Ferris wheel being set up outside a cave inside which a man is being slowly suffocated.

If you have not seen Ace in the Hole, I can only encourage you to do so immediately.

A man from New York walks into an Albuquerque newspaper to see the owner. Charles Tatum tells of his experiences as a reporter: fired from eleven newspapers. He wants a job at $60 a week. [Is he too arrogant?] He is sent to cover a rattlesnake hunt. Bad news sells best. They stop at a store for gas. The police go to an old Indian cliff dwelling, there was a cave-in and Leo is trapped. Tatum volunteers to go into the cave, searching deeper and deeper. He finds Leo pinned under a rock. More help is needed. Help will arrive, this will be a big story. Leos wife will depart for another place. Tourists drop by. Do newspapers slant the news to gain readers?

Visitors pay to drive to the site. This news is terrific! [Note the old cars.] Will Tatum profit from his work? Mrs. Cusack offers advice. Tatum gets job offers from big-city newspapers. There is a new song about Leo Minosa. A train brings tourists. Can they send a priest to Leo? Can they rescue him by morning with a new method? No. Will Tatum get a surprise from Leos wife? He fetches a priest. Rocks fall in the tunnel. Leo does a confession and gets the Last Rites, then dies. Tatum announces this news to the crowd. The circus is over. The crowd disperses. Tatums teletype machine is removed and he is fired. But he has work to do. The area is deserted. Back at the Albuquerque newspaper he collapses.

This cynical movie is worth watching once for its stark, pitiless treatment of some newspaper reporters. It goes against the popular assumptions of its day when most newspapers were locally owned and operated instead of being owned by a big corporation.",1389916800,,1650,4.475083056478406

When a local man hunting for ancient Indian treasures is trapped by a cave-in under tons of stone, Kirk seizes his chance:  He repackages a small private tragedy as the human interest story of the century.  The cave-in becomes a Hopi curse, the victim's vulgar, greedy wife becomes a luminous almost-widow, and what should be a straight-forward rescue effort morphs into a massive engineering feat that may or may not redeem poor Leo.  Kirk is absolutely mesmerizing as the devious, trickster journalist.  I was captivated by the entire film, eager to discover how it would end and the fate of all the characters.  I discovered ""Ace in the Hole"" while researching film noir, but it doesn't fit easily into that genre.  Released in 1951, it feels extraordinarily prescient for its time, as Kirk's publicity efforts succeed in repurposing the accident as a sort of primordial reality show gobbled up by millions of gullible Americans, the ""Save Leo"" extravaganza.  It may be 60 years old, but the film has much to say about how ""reality"" programming can twist and transform the truth into something far more complicated and sinister.",1363392000,,1261,5.0

Kirk Douglas eats up his role as a reporter who will stop at nothing along the way to reverse his fortunes.  However, he is not a two-dimensional character in this regard because he treats serious, decent people in a serious, decent manner, and twisted and evil characters with force.

Douglas's character finds his character too late as an innocent dies, and through this we see a contrition that is believable.

The American people and persona play an important role here, and we see a pre-Wal-mart era of Americans that would be right at home in the People of Walmart website.

Wilder points many fingers as the cause of the tragedy, from cowardice to avarice on the part of individuals, organized groups, America and the pursuit of wealth and fame.

Tatum doesn't fit in with a newspaper that prides itself on honesty, integrity and the truth, so it's time for Tatum to create a sensational story that will bring him the fame and glory he deserves - or thinks he deserves.
On his way to cover a mundane story, Tatum arrives at an isolated outpost where the owner's son is trapped in a cave-in. Here is Tatum's chance at glory as long as he can make sure the rescue is dragged out as long as possible. There is a human interest story bonanza here--the worried parents and wife--all waiting for a successful rescue. Tatum convinces the rescuers to try a more dangerous and time-consuming rescue.
Suddenly, this quiet roadside stop turns into a circus. Yes, as the crowd gathers, the circus sets up rides outside the cave as a man desperately awaits rescue.
Tatum's hard core heart softens somewhat as he talks to the trapped man who is grateful for Tatum's friendship and help. Little does the trapped man know that Tatum is to blame for his continued misery.
ACE IN THE HOLE shows the dark side of human nature. Here we have people willing to sacrefice and innocent man for fame and money. Douglas gives a remarkable performance as the reporter wrestling with his conscience.",1334534400,2,1420,4.638888888888889

1141453,5,7885887014,"Kirk Douglas is one of those actors who is not afraid to take roles in controversial scripts - as early as 1953, he plays a lonely Jewish holocaust survivor in ""The Juggler"";  he accepts the lead role in ""Spartacus"" and makes sure the blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo receives a visible, listed credit;  he plays a WWI French officer in ""Paths of Glory"" who delivers strong anti-war statements; he plays a cowboy in ""Lonely are the Brave"", using his wits to try to help his friend break out of jail for being convicted for assisting illegal immigrants.  And now..in ""Ace in the Hole"", he plays the part of a loathsome, self-interested news reporter willing to put an injured, trapped man in mortal danger so as to restore a failing career as a washed up reporter.

Kirk Douglas' portrayal of this slimy yet charming reporter punched me in the gut. I felt I knew this man and I could imagine being in the same room with him...hating and liking him at the same time. The reporter he plays is so believable, so goal oriented, so manipulative, so strong. I never saw a movie in the last several years with such powerful acting - foreign or domestic.

Other actors in the film perform unusually well.  There is the father of the trapped man - played by John Berkes - who embodies grace and simplicity in his desire for the well being of his son.  And there is the trapped man himself - played by Richard Benedict - who mistakenly believes that the reporter is his comrade and is sincerely trying to save his life.

The truth, of course, is that the reporter is dragging out the rescue operation, and putting the trapped
man in risk of dying before the operation is completed.

Perhaps the most scathing indictment of the film is not the critique of the reporter.  We all know single
men or women who put their interests above others.  It it is the film's indictment of the way in which
so many Americans are fascinated by disasters - willing to gawk, or even profit, from the ruin of others. [If you have never seen it, that theme was brilliantly depicted in the noirish film - ""The Set Up.""]

1141546,4,7885887014,"Billy Wilder's 1951 film ""Ace in the Hole"" is a cynical, noir-ish tale about cunning newspaper reporter Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas), who stumbles upon a rescue operation to free a man trapped in a cave, then manipulates events to make the rescue take much longer than it should.  This allows him to file many more stories about the rescue effort, increasingly lurid and sensational, enhancing- as planned- his own reputation as a reporter who sells papers.

While a fairly riveting movie, laced with style and dark humor, in the end the story might be a little dark for its own good.  While the film functions as one of the earliest warnings that the growing mass media of the mid 20th Century might not be entirely altruistic, by having such a bleak conclusion to both the central plotline and the path of reporter Chuck Tatum (don't worry, i won't get more specific than that), the result may have been somewhat counter-productive.  The film, being perceived as too depressing, failed at the box office, limiting the effect of its message.

Also limiting viewership at the time was the possible sense that the film's criticism of the media, while worth considering, might have gone a little too far. After all, while no one would doubt that newspapers and the other major media in 1951 wouldn't hesitiate to sell more ads if a disaster they were covering increased their audiences, would they really put people's lives at risk to keep the disaster from being addressed?

Of course, ""Ace in the Hole"" is also the story of one reporter and his personal decisions, so even if the central message is somewhat overcooked, the movie still works fine as the story of Kirk Douglas' Chuck Tatum character, and the events he sets in motion.  You can always enjoy the movie just on that level, and take as much of the media-criticism theme to heart as you deem appropriate.

Not surprisingly, ""Ace in the Hole"" looks and sounds wonderful on the Criterion DVD I watched, and, also not surprisingly, there are a variety of wonderful extra features on the second disc, as well as a decent commentary track by film historian Neil Sinyard on the disc containing the movie.  My favorite among the second-disc special features was an almost hour-long program, produced in 1980, featuring extensive conversations between Billy Wilder and film critic Michel Ciment.  Mr. Wilder tells some great stories to Mr. Ciment, providing wonderful insights into the creative process and motivations behind his many films.",1291161600,,2492,4.911904761904762
1141547,4,7885887014,"I grabbed this because of Billy Wilder in spite of the dreary picture on the cover and the presence of Kirk Douglas.  Douglas was good, though, as the brash, desperate journalist with the morals of a rattlesnake.  He was handsome and charming enough to keep me watching even though I quickly tired of his one-tone delivery.  (loud)

I live in New Mexico and found the local color interesting although it's been a long time since we've seen Native Americans in full dress on the streets of Albuquerque.  The locale did add to the drama.  Jan Sterling was perfect as the peroxide blonde who was eager to get out of the family trading post.  She was a good match for the journalist and I wondered if there would be more between them.

The story was simple but it unfolded very well.  I was happy to see the Douglas character show another side of himself towards the end.  One felt that he had genuine feelings for the fellow caught in the mine, even while he was busy exploiting him.

It's not a film that  will enlighten you as to the venality of politians and some journalists; that's not news.  But it's well told and photographed.  The fact that it is dated adds to its charm.  It's definitely worth a look.",1287792000,,1208,4.477064220183486

1141549,5,7885887014,"This is a review for ACE IN THE HOLE, a 1951 Paramaount Pictures release directed by Billy Wilder.
ACE IN THE HOLE'S release on DVD was by Criterion in 2007. ACE IN THE HOLE, later retitled and rereleased as THE BIG CARNIVAL was something of a financial and viewed somewhat as an artistic flop back in 1951. Many of Billy Wilder's successful pictures up to that poiint had a large dose of humor in them. the only kind of humor to be found in ACE IN THE HOLE might be called black humor, not exactly the thing that has the audiences rolling in the asiles.

ACE IN THE HOLE is about a down on his luck ""bigtime"" newspaper reporter, Chuck Tatum, played by Kirk Douglas, who's been stuck on a small Arizona newspaper for over a year and wants to return to the big time.
Finally , on his way to a cover a rattlesnake chase, he stumbles onto a story with potential. A young tourist spot operator has been trapped in a cave while looking for old Indian relics. there's no way to get him out without calling for help, manpower and some power equipment which will take a few days to organize.
In the meantime reporter Tatum is lining up the wire services and other news outlets, all having to come through him to get to the story, sure that this is his big chance.

After a couple of days, everything is starting to fall into place, the men, rescue equipment, and most prominently of all, the news services, reporters, and plenty of tourists amusements to keep everyone usefully, and profitably occupied. Eventually it's decided to take the longer way in to rescuing the trapped young man, after all it's probably safer, those old mine timbers are pretty wobbly, and certainly slower. In the meantime the consessions keep selling and everyone but the trapped young man is having a good time for himself.

As ACE IN THE HOLE progresses to its logical conclusion, the story and characters get more darker and bitterly cynical with the passing of each day as virtually everyone realizes this is as much a grab for the contents of the cash register as to rescue a trapped explorer. Ultimately, even Chuck Tatum gets sick of the situation
and after the conclusion of the rescue effort Tatum meets his ironic fate at the hands of the trapped man's wife. A bitterly dark finish to a film that's almost a 3-ring circus of cynicism.

1141551,4,7885887014,"This hard-to-see film finally came to TCM in 2007 and then to DVD a short while later in the year, pleasing a lot of classic film and film noir fans.  Criterion does its normal job of giving us a superb transfer.  Yes, their discs are expensive, but you get what you pay for, usually.  It's especially good to get well-photographed films like this looking sharp on our TVs.

As for the story, I found the fist hour to be riveting with crisp dialog, interesting characters, and some nice camera shots by director Billy Wilder and photographer Charles Lang. Kirk Douglas was intense as ""Chuck Tatum"" and Jan Sterling (""Lorraine Minosa"") was pure film-noir platinum blonde with attitude.

Then, the next 40-45 minutes disappointed me, to be frank. Tatum slowly softens to the point where the film loses its edge, going from an adventure story-film noir to more of a melodrama. Sterling's character almost disappears from the screen, which doesn't help. However, with 10 minutes left in the film, a shocking scene with her jolted me back to full attention.

The acting is superb, not just with the two leads but with all the supporting actors, led by Porter Hall, who played the newspaper editor ""Jacob Boot."" I also appreciated the sarcastic comedy in here as Wilder and the screenwriters parody the ""carnival"" atmosphere which develops when a tragedy occurs and people make a financial profit out of it. As the days linger on and the man in this story clings to his life trapped deep in a mine, the circus atmosphere grows. Hence, the second title of this film: ""The Big Carnival.""

That latter title was used when the film bombed at the box office in America the first time it was shown. Later, it was reissued under that second title. It still bombed. However, today it seems to be getting cult status.",1247011200,2,1802,4.738019169329074

1141553,4,7885887014,"After a long wait for the Criterion edition of 'Ace in the Hole', I must say that I am not disappointed.

As a follow-up to the quintessential Wilder film, 'Sunset Boulevard', 'Ace' works well as a companion piece. But the message is also more poignant and universal than in 'Sunset'. 'Ace' is all about greed and hubris. This is fairly obvious but what strikes me the most is the incredible visual symbolism of such themes (the constant tightening of the hole in the cave throughout the film and the 'headline' in the closing shot of the film). For a script that was uncompleted before Wilder finished shooting, the story is well structured and thematically consistent.

That being said, I got the feeling that the last third of the movie was written on the fly. The film is still thematically correct but the climax was somewhat predictable nevertheless. Some of these notions are touched on, with much verve, in the Criterion edition's commentary. I must agree to some degree because I felt similar to the commentator when I first viewed the film (w/o commentary).

Despite these minor setbacks, the film is otherwise masterful, filled with Wilder's virtuoso dialogue and camera (Wilder isn't noted as being particularly fancy with the camera, but this film has plenty of shots that call attention to the story and it's themes). 'Ace in the Hole' is truly a lost masterpiece from a prolific and legendary film maker. Not to be missed!",1228089600,,1437,4.857142857142857
1141674,5,7885887014,"In 1950 Billy Wilder was riding high. Fresh off the enormously successful Sunset Boulevard, the German-born Wilder decided to make a very different film; one somewhat critical of the society of his new home, the United States. That film was called Ace in the Hole.

The movie concerns Kirk Douglas as a down-on-his-luck reporter who has been fired from just about every major newspaper in the country. Starting with New York, he's gone from large market to small, and now has ended up in Alberquerque. He's a self-described $250 a week reporter, but settles for $60 a week, and makes it clear at one point he'd be willing to take even less.

But his character, Chuck Tatum, has dreams. Yes, he does. He dreams that one day, the Great Story will drop into his lap. A story that will let him write his way out of the situation he's in, one that will let him write his own ticket and get back to New York.

That Great Story drops into his lap one day when, while on the way to cover a rattlesnake hunt, he stops at a gas station and finds out there's a man trapped in a nearby cave. He boldly goes into the gave, meets Leo Mimosa (Richard Benedict), the man trapped inside, and smells a story.

Immediately he begins to sabotage the rescue efforts. When the engineer in charge of getting Mimosa out explains that it might take most of a day to get him out safely, Tatum conconcts a much more convulted rescue plan, one that will certainly take days. Days during which he can write a great story about this poor man trapped in a mountin. A story that will finally take him back to New York.

Along the way he meets the slightly corrupt sheriff (Ray Teal), who is more-than-willing to help him, figuring the attention boosts his chances of getting relected. Also present is Mimosa's wife, Lorraine (Jan Sterling), who can't stand her husband and wants to leave. Tatum practically forces her to remain, saying the story works so much better if there's a grieving wife at home for him to focus on.

As the days roll past, people begin to show up. First just a family on their way to a nice vaction, who end up settling in for the long haul. Before you know it, the entire area is filled with cars, as people come from miles around to witness this great story. Eventually a large carnvial builds up around the site (in fact the movie was, at one point, called The Big Carnival). Access to the cave area, once free, goes from 25 cents a car to 50 cents, and then to a dollar. The gas station is making money hand over fist. Tatum is being courted by New York. Everyone is benefiting. Everyone but Leo.

Things begin to change in the life of everyone involved, including Tatum, when Leo starts to get sicker and sicker. Tatum quickly realizes the story doesn't work if the man in the cave doesn't make it out alive, and starts to try and change his tactics, only to find out that it might be too late.

The story is based to a great extent on real-life events in 1925, when a man named Floyd Collins became trapped in a mine. It also put me in mind of those stories back in the late 80's and early 90's, where it seemed like every week some kid was getting trapped in a well. If nothing else, this movie shows well that the media circus that errupted around those wells was little different from what has gone before.

When the movie was released, it was largely panned. Many people seemed to think it was overly-cynical and presented an image of America as it wasn't. The film also failed miserably at the box office. It did get an Oscar nomination, for the screenplay, but lost. Most people today have never even heard of the film, and that's a tragedy.

The movie was recently released on DVD by the Criterion Collection and turns up on Turner Classic Movies from time-to-time. It's an exceptional film, with stunning cinematography, great performances and a wonderful screenplay. It feels amazingly modern despite being 57 years old.

Roger Ebert said of this movie:

""Wilder, true to this vision and ahead of his time, made a movie in which the only good men are the victim and his doctor. Instead of blaming the journalist who masterminds a media circus, he is equally hard on sightseers who pay 25 cents admission. Nobody gets off the hook here.""

He's exactly correct. The public that eats up these stories is every bit as culpable as the journalists who create them. If we ignore these stories, they'll go away. Instead the public lavishes attention onto them, encouraging the worst in journalism. On the plus side, at least in this case, it makes for a wonderful, if sometimes hard to watch, film.",1220659200,4,4597,4.504201680672269
1141675,4,7885887014,"Ignored, unappreciated, even despised by the majority upon its initial release, Ace in the Hole is a bold social critique that pulls no punches.  This movie holds up the public mirror and tries to make people see just how much they suck.
Kirk Douglas delivers another fearless performance as Charles Tatum, a shameless big-city reporter that has been exiled from several lucrative jobs.  So he retreats to a small town newspaper gig in New Mexico, in order to reestablish his career.
Tatum hates his new job, and desperately searches for the big break that will propel him back into the limelight.  That moment eventually comes when a mine collapses, trapping a worker inside.  Tatum takes charge of all the relief efforts, not out of concern for the desperate man inside, but for the fame that accompanies this tragedy.  A media frenzy ensues.
One moment that illustrates Tatum's arrogance--other reporters try to move in and capture some of the news coverage.  One says ""We're all in the same boat"".  Tatum's cynical response was ""No, I'm in the boat.  You're in the water.""
This movie is an excellent display of humanity's overall decline of morality.  How vanity supersedes compassion.  How humanity has lost touch with one another.  I'm not trying to sound judgemental, heck I'm ignoring all company policies and personal job responsibilities by writing this review.  Nobody's perfect.  But this is a great movie, with powerful but controlled acting and a significant message.

1141677,5,7885887014,"Ace in the Hole (Billy Wilder, 1951)

Thank heaven (or Criterion) for a release of Billy Wilder's notorious and brilliant Ace in the Hole for the home video market. As topical as it may have been fifty-six years ago, today it has an unprecedented relevance to American society. It's rare that a film's importance grows over time. This is one of those cases.

The story centers around Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas in the performance of his career), a disgraced newspaper reporter who finds himself working in the backwoods world of Albuquerque journalism, covering compelling news stories like a rattlesnake contest. While on his way to cover one such story with cub photographer Herbie Cook (Green Grass of Wyoming's Robert Arthur), he stumbles into something much bigger: Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict), who owns a service station/knickknack shop in the dusty little town of Los Barios, has gotten himself trapped in a mine collapse while looking for Indian relics in a cliff dwelling to sell to tourists. Rather than simply helping the guy out, getting one story, and going on with his life, Tatum-- desperate to get back in the good graces of the Eastern papers with a strong series of stories-- concocts a plan with the corrupt local Sheriff (Ray Teal) to keep the story alive for a week. In the process, he manipulates everyone around him, including Leo's cynical yet nave wife (Jan Sterling).

Wilder takes the idea of the media circus to new heights here (including having an actual circus on the grounds during the latter half of the film). Ace in the Hole is a relentlessly pessimistic film in which no one cares about Leo Minosa the human being, only about Leo Minosa the story and what each person can get out of it. Leo's wife wants a way out of hicksville, as does Tatum (and, to a lesser extent, Herbie); the sheriff wants re-elected; the head engineer of the rescue team wants an exclusive on the fat contracts that come with the sheriff's re-election; even the competing papers' journalists, who are the only people in the film kinda-sorta set up as the good guys, just want the story, and their editors eventually want Tatum. After a while, news stops being news and starts being entertainment. (Note that Wilder has no illusions about this from the get-go; the first story Tatum files has less to do with Leo Minosa than the Indian curse that Minosa believes trapped him in the shaft.) This, of course, is exactly what's been happening to American culture since not long after Watergate.

Topicality, though, is not the only reason to watch Ace in the Hole. Wilder was one of those great directors, now an endangered species, who could do anything (and often did); the melodramatic Ace in the Hole was bookended by Sunset Blvd., the finest piece of film noir of all time, and Stalag 17, the movie that (loosely) formed the basis of the television show Hogan's Heroes. Imagine a modern director filming three so widely differing movies in a row, not to mention having all three of the movies, fifty years later, being known as timeless classics of filmdom. Wilder got the most out of every actor he ever cast in a movie, and knew where to put the cameras and how to film the shots so that all that acting talent could be showcased in the finest possible way. A Billy Wilder movie is filmmaking at its best, and Ace in the Hole, finally available again after languishing in obscurity so long, is ample evidence of that. **** ",1198108800,3,3437,4.740802675585284
1141678,4,7885887014,"Ace In The Hole (aka The Big Carnival) was directed by my hero, Billy Wilder. He is the genius who gave us Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard and Some Like It Hot - three of my all-time favorite films. Ace In The Hole, however, suffers from the over-the-top performance of Kirk Douglas who manages to play every scene with clenched teeth and boiling-point anger. His early scenes in the small newspaper office in Albuquerque are so over-played that he comes off like a man in need of a straight-jacket rather than a job. I believe it would be a more powerful film if his character were a little more sympatetic initially, thereby shocking us once his dark side is fully revealed. As it stands now, we are not surprised at the depth of his depravity because of Douglas' inability to bring some subtlety to his performance. Having said all that, there is much here to recommend...some solid acting performances and a powerful story of greed and power and how contagious corruption is. Jan Sterling stands out as the cold and indifferent wife of the man trapped in the cave. She delivers the only funny line in the movie, ""I don't go to church. Kneeling bags my nylons."" She can be seen in Caged and in her Oscar-nominated performance in The High And The Mighty. In closing, I would like to say that I think William Holden would have brought more subtley and dimension to the lead role.

1141679,5,7885887014,"Kirk Douglas stars as smug and unscrupulous newspaper reporter Charles Tate in director Billy Wilder's 1951 film noir classic ""Ace in the Hole"".  This film created on the heels of Wilder's fantastic ""Sunset Boulevard"", while well acted and contrived, bombed at the box office.  The social commentary presented in the film, perhaps touched a raw nerve in the viewing public.

Douglas finds himself down and out in Albuquerque, having been bounced from numerous prestigious positions from influential newspapers.  He begs the local editor for a job hoping to uncover a story that will propel him back into the limelight.  As luck would have it just such a situation arises as he's out covering a local interest story.

An Indian curio shop owner Leo Minosa played by Richard Benedict becomes trapped in a cave-in while collecting artifacts in a underground Indian burial ground.  Douglas stumbles across this and meanders his way through the honeycombed underground lair to meet the trapped man, all the while scheming to turn his misfortunate to his own benefit.  Douglas coercing the cooperation of a corrupt local sheriff manages to totally control the entire media coverage of the event.

Working in concert with a mining engineer Douglas helps devise a questional rescue effort which will take many days to rescue poor Leo Mimosa.  More than enough time for Douglas to exploit the circumstances and turn it into a media circus.  Mimosa's ex-dance hall wife Lorraine played by Jan Sterling is only too happy to go along, hoping to turn a tidy profit by the rush of onlookers and passersby patronizing their curio shop and restaurant.

The events turn preposterous as a carnival complete with circus tents and rides pops up right beside the rescue effort obscuring the fact that a trapped man's life hangs in the balance.

Douglas finally receives the accolades he desires and his old New York job back when he learns that the trapped Minosa is dying of pneumonia.  It's too late for penitence when Douglas realizes that the delays he caused in the rescue effort directly caused the demise of the man.

The clairvoyant Wilder in his film touched upon a topic that still is in the forefront of the media coverage of today.  Sensationalism still sells newspapers and television time.  The O.J. trial and coverage of Operation Desert Storm both bear testament to that fact.",1192492800,,2371,4.99236641221374

So, it was with a bit of caution, and a subjectively negative opinion, that I went into Ace in the Hole.

All I can say is that I absolutely love it when something like this happens; I got into a film expecting something and get something entirely the opposite.  The last time I saw a film that hit me with such force was a few months back after my initial viewing of Bresson's Au Hasard Balthazar.  In the end both films left me completely open mouthed, unable to express how amazed I was at their power.  This has definitely made it's place into my top 10 of all time.

For pre-method acting days, the performances are utterly impeccable, not cardboard like some of the other Hollywood productions of that era.  Kirk Douglas was absolutely captivating as, quite possibly, the first anti-hero, a man who you love one minute and then despise the next.  Everything about the film, the pacing, the cinematography, the score, is superb, and without fault.

Yes, it is an intensely cynical film, and that is one of the reasons I adore it.  I prefer my films to have a sense of reality, to depict what would REALLY happen, not what some schmuck Hollywood screenwriter would like to happen in some fantasy world.  So, it's with the combination of cynicism, misanthropy and reality that Ace in the Hole really shines in comparison to most ""the media is evil"" films.

Truly a film that should be viewed by every living human being, more than once.",1191801600,4,1713,4.5227272727272725
1141681,2,7885887014,"SPOILER ALERT: THIS REVIEW REVEALS THE END OF THE MOVIE.

""Ace in the Hole"" is legendary; for years, while it was hard to find, its many boosters praised it as a caustic and fearless expose of American tabloid journalism. In fact, though, ""Ace in the Hole"" is a predictable, ham-handed, bombastic, manipulative B movie that ""exposes"" more about its boosters than about American culture.

""Ace""'s first five minutes telegraph the entire movie - you don't need to watch it to see how anything will play out. ""Ace in the Hole"" is a fantasy for the kind of male who uses the word ""sheeple,"" thinks that he is several IQ measurements superior to the mass of humanity, and looks down on humanity with its stupid values like religion and family. ""Ace"" plays to the man who thinks he, or another Nietzschean superman, singlehandedly orchestrates all human activity, and that the rest of us are just marionettes jerking around at the end of his strings.

The viewer is supposed to believe that sleaze-ball journalist Tatum (Kirk Douglas) exercises hypnotic power over all humanity. This is completely unbelievable, except, again, to people with some fantasy of hyper-potent men. Douglas gives a performance so over the top it would be vulgar in a telemundo soap opera. Douglas' eyes pop out of his head; his veins pop out of his neck; his lips turn prehensile; he chews up the scenery like a teething infant who is the reincarnation of a man who starved to death. Not a single other character in the movie serves as a foil to him -- everyone else is a puny, fearful, clueless, bland midget next to Douglas. How could any intelligent viewer's attention be held by such a stacked deck?

""Ace""'s boosters insist that it was a prescient film that accurately depicted media carnivals like that over the Duke Lacrosse Case. Not so. The Duke Lacrosse Case was interesting and can hold your attention; ""Ace"" is not and cannot. Mike Nifong, like Tatum, conspired to damage other, innocent people in order to aggrandize himself. But Nifong, unlike Tatum, was up against three-dimensional human beings who could thwart his designs, thus making that story *interesting.*

The B-movie-style stacked deck of ""Ace"" is made very clear when, in a relatively early scene, Douglas strikes an armed police officer and that police officer stands stock still, never responding. The only person who could believe that scene is a viewer utterly invested in the fantasy macho omnipotence Wilder invests in Tatum, and/or someone who has never actually met a cop. You want to find yourself on your stomach on the ground with your wrists handcuffed behind your back? Strike a cop as Tatum does.

Similarly, Tatum's ability to orchestrate the rescue effort of a man trapped underground, making sure that rescuers won't reach him in sixteen hours, as they'd proposed, but in seven days, is beyond belief. The authorities had to know that, in addition to Tatum, there were other hungry press circling like sharks, and those reporters would soon enough discover Tatum's deadly ruse, and metaphorically or literally lynch him and his co-conspirators.

In the end, Tatum has a moment of truth and reveals that, all along, he was the only person in the world with any sensitivity and integrity. He receives a fatal stab wound, and, superman that he is, his shirt is not torn, and he bleeds a teeny amount; he goes on to march around, call an end to the circus he started - the carousel and ferris wheel actually stop for him --  and makes a rousing speech to the masses.

Though dying, Tatum doesn't stop there. He confesses his crime. He mentors a sweet young lad. Then he finally falls in the most cinematically dramatic pose possible. This movie wants, very badly, to have its cake and eat it, too. It's not a mockery of American tabloid entertainment, it *is*, in its heavy-handedness, manipulation, loudness and complete lack of surprise, with a big, strong, male superhero at its center, American tabloid entertainment.

Check out Fred MacMurray as Mr. Sheldrake in Wilder's ""The Apartment."" MacMurray never flairs his nostrils once, and no kettle drums announce his dastardly schemes, but his depiction of cynical evil is lightyears superior to that of Douglas / Tatum in ""Ace in the Hole.""

I love Billy Wilder; that's why I wanted so badly to see this movie. Here the master doesn't misstep, he thuds. In one scene, I *knew* how the scene would end even as it was beginning - the end of the scene would be a shot of the side of a bus, and then a shot of a woman's back as she returned to a building. Nothing surprised me here.

Given that, I started thinking about the movie, and the director, even as I was watching the movie, never a good sign. Wilder's family was murdered in the Holocaust. It is often commented upon that Wilder never made a Holocaust movie per se, but that themes appear in his work. For example, in ""Emperor Waltz,"" an Austrian nobleman tries to drown puppies because they are not pedigree. I wonder, though, if ""Ace in the Hole,"" with its depiction of most people as terribly hollow and venal, mere shadow-like followers of a superior, and monstrous, leader, is not Wilder's Holocaust film.",1191715200,19,5179,4.813273340832396
1141682,5,7885887014,"Criterion's DVD release of this classic film from 1951 is a great gift to Billy Wilder fans. It's a hard-boiled tale of an unscrupulous reporter that cuts straight to the rotten heart of the news media, where information management and sensationalism have overwhelmed the simple idealism of ""telling the truth."" Kirk Douglas is terrific as the man who engineers a news event to advance his own career and creates a media circus in the process, at the expense of another man who lies trapped and dying in a cave-in. Meanwhile, Jan Sterling, as the other man's wife, turns in a performance that's even more nakedly self-serving.

Set in what is supposed to be the New Mexico desert, the on-location photography is startlingly realistic for a film of this era. As the story evolves, the visuals and camera movement take on the scale of an epic. The grim vision of the movie and its cinematic style put it in league with films like ""Citizen Kane.""

1141783,4,7885887014,"As a resident of Albuquerque, I can vouch for the scenery and feel of the movie.  Although now a relative metropolis of about half a million people, shortly after World War II Albuquerque was about 1/10th that.  No one captures the spirit of the late 1940's and early 1950's better than Wilder, and no one does a better job of portraying why seeing it from a distance is far better than living in it.

Douglas is a ""Douglasified"" (there is no way of better describing the over-the-top, can-do, hyperactive he-man character that was Kirk Douglas' trademark) newspaper reporter whose ambitions and ego were too much for the larger newspapers back east.  Douglas' drive, ego, ambition, and greed caused him to play too fast and loose with ethics even for the larger newspapers accustomed to pushing the ethical and legal limits, and ultimately cause his demise with the ""small town"" newspaper in Albuquerque (about as far from civilization as Wilder knew America could imagine).

Unfortunately, the movie's message is once again prescient, since at no time since Wilder's 1950's has the message about journalists' selling out for greed and blind ambition been more applicable than to our embedded corporate propagandists with their burgeoning bank accounts and ethical bankruptcy.

I rate it four stars instead of five because of what I feel was an unnecessary diversion into a romantic disaster by Douglas' character, but one could argue that it goes hand-in-hand with the characters other multi-dimensional defects.",1190505600,4,1514,5.159183673469387
1141784,5,7885887014,"The audience that loved Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard"" (1950) turned on his ""Ace in the Hole"" one year later. Watch the movie and you can guess why. It was easy for middle America to enjoy a decadent Hollywood get its just desserts. When Wilder turned the mirror onto middle America itself, they didn't admire their own reflection.

""Ace in the Hole"" endures, however, for some of the same reasons as Sidney Lumet's ""Network"" (1975): what was satire 30-50 years ago has become reality. In a world of Fox Network and 24-hour infotainment, ""Ace in the Hole"" is immediately recognizable and could have been filmed yesterday. It's a good thing it wasn't, because there aren't any Billy Wilders around, who directed without fussiness and wrote scripts with razor blades. As a peculiar kind of film noir, this is a movie that had to have been made in black and white. And it's hard to think of an actor in our day who could have played as well this movie's loathsome yet recognizably human lead as did the young Kirk Douglas. As with all Criterion editions, the bells and whistles glisten: particularly the film's pinpoint restoration, the commentary track, and a terrific filmed interview with Billy Wilder at the American Film Institute.

Roger Ebert has noted that, as a German emigr to the United States with the onset of World War II, Billy Wilder loved his adopted homeland but never accepted as truth America's dangerously pious myths about itself.

But what shocks me is it was made in a time that reporters were heros, and movies showed everyone else as in the wrong.  This one specifically attacks the everyman.  Applying it to our modern obsession with lawsuits of celebrities, the amy fisher's of the world, and you get a movie decades ahead of itself.

Everybody loves to rubberneck...

Billy Wilder has to be given credit for even trying to make a flick like this, let alone pulling it off and seeing it released. Wilder is one of Hollywood's true geniuses; few other directors could or would have made this honest a film.
As usual for Wilder, the snappy dialogue is occasionally hilarious.

1141787,4,7885887014,"Stating that any one movie is ""the most cynical"" is highly subjective.  There is a lot of competition! Yet ""Ace in the Hole"" has to be considered one of the most biting of releases. Kirk Douglas finds himself in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a former big city hotshot reporter caught in a downward career spiral.  He lands a job at the local paper, ambitiously determined to claw his way back to the big time.  When a man is trapped in a mine cave in, KD senses his big chance. KD aggressively manipulates the story and shamelessly drags out the rescue effort to get rehired at a New York tabloid.  This reviewer is not a big KD fan but one has to give credit where it's due - he is perfectly cast here, never wavering throughout the film. The supporting cast including Jan Sterling, Ray Teal and Porter Hall are excellent. They play the trapped man's venal wife, the feckless sheriff and KDs straight shooting editor. Legend has that KD was concerned that he was overplaying his role, bur Director Billy Wilder ordered him not to let up. Other reviewers have compared AH to other Wilder classic such as ""Double Indemnity"" or ""The Lost Weekend"". Such accolades belong in the eyes of the beholder but to even drop such a mention is a high compliment indeed.

1141790,4,7885887014,"Leave it to legendary filmmaker Billy Wilder to expose the base nature of tabloid-style journalism with a shrewdly observant eye on human foibles laced with his trademark take-no-prisoners wit in this criminally overlooked 1951 film, his follow-up to 1950's classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunset-Boulevard/dp/B00003CXCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunset Boulevard</a>. Co-written by Wilder with Walter Newman and Lesser Samuels, it's a relentlessly cynical look into the extremes that one ruthless reporter takes to engineer the story of a man trapped in a cave-in into a national media circus. The amazingly prescient nature of the film is what makes this film ripe for rediscovery now, especially under Wilder's astute cinematic guidance.

The downbeat story focuses on Chuck Tatum, an embittered character made of the same morally tainted cloth as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Double-Indemnity/dp/B00005JNG5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Double Indemnity</a>'s Walter Neff and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunset/dp/B00003CXCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunset</a>'s Joe Gillis. He has been kicked off the staff of a major New York newspaper and relegated to working out of a small-time Albuquerque news office. Professionally desperate and an unbridled alcoholic, Tatum smells a story with potential when he and his young apprentice happen upon an isolated trading post and find out the owner, Leo Minosa, has been trapped in a cave where he was scavenging for ancient and possibly valuable Indian artifacts. What happens after that is the gradual disintegration of Tatum's soul for the sake of sustaining his story of the trapped man on a national scale, a shamelessly manipulative ploy that lasts nearly a week.

Similar to Elia Kazan's media-skewering masterpiece, 1957's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Face-in-the-Crowd/dp/B0007TKNHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Face in the Crowd</a>, Wilder places culpability not only on the people reporting and distributing the news but also on the ambitious local authorities and a public hungry for a human interest story with a heroic rescue. What makes Wilder's film more of a struggle to watch than Kazan's is that none of the significant characters approximate a human conscience, at least until one has reached an irredeemable point of no return. As Tatum, Kirk Douglas has played variations on the heartless heel, most notably in 1949's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Champion/dp/B00005Y6ZV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Champion</a>&nbsp;and 1952's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bad-and-the-Beautiful/dp/B00005U2KI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bad and the Beautiful</a>, and here he matches those sharp portrayals with his typical powerhouse verve. Jan Sterling turns in a snarling, unapologetic performance as Minosa's slatternly wife, bleached blond Lorraine, who matches Tatum's soulless center.

Film scholar Neil Sinyard provides an insightful commentary track on the two-disc 2007 Criterion Collection DVD set. There is also a 1980 documentary on Wilder, ""Portrait of a '60% Perfect Man': Billy Wilder"", which features extensive, in-depth interviews with the film master by film critic Michel Ciment. There is also a 1984 interview with Douglas, as well as an excerpt from the 1986 American Film Institute tribute to Wilder and an audio interview with co-screenwriter Newman. Director Spike Lee has been recruited to provide a contemporary perspective in an afterword, and a stills gallery and the original theatrical trailer complete the extras.",1188259200,5,3786,6.834368530020704

Kirk Douglas gives the performance of his career as Chuck Tatum - a manipulative, unethical reporter who turns a New Mexico cave-in disaster into a full-blown media circus.

I had high expectations, as the film sits in the middle of Wilder's string of masterpieces and near-great films from 1944's Double Indemnity to 1961's One, Two, Three. The film is darker than any other of Wilder's work's, partly because it is unleavened by humour or by having a sympathetic character who isn't a dupe.  Kirk Douglas is ferociously self-serving, and brings the intensity of his 40s and 50s roles without the conscience or the warmth.  The other characters are stereotypes or plot devices, and the film seems schematic at times.
Despite this, the cumulative effect is stunning, and the huge set pieces of the crowds gathering outside the cave unforgettable.  With Michael Powell's Peeping Tom and Chayefsky's Network, here are three films that predicted all the tawdry, amoral pervasivesness of modern media and reality tv.",1187913600,3,892,5.089041095890411

1141854,5,7885887014,"Are you grinning because I say it's a religious, deeply spiritual film? Well look at it from my point of view (maybe even Wilder's point of view). What does the mount look like with the big drill sitting on top of it, and trying to save (physically) a man trapped deep underneath?

Why does Wilder focus so much on the contrast between the fake and mean wife and the religious mother, her dying son and tender-hearted brother? How about the meaning of the snakes in the story, and that the corrupt sheriff has a rattlesnake as a pet with him most of the time? What role does the kid-journalist play in the story, having to decide between following Tatum (evil maybe?) and the small town newspaper (good, perhaps?)

Why would Wilder make the role of the man trapped in the hole in the mountain so obviously religious? ""Forgive me Father, for I have sinned"" were his last words. Is that not important in the film? Why then do people only focus on the media circus, on the social aspects of the film? Becuase, perhaps, people don't like to think they may be part of the crowd? The same crowd who gathers to have fun while watching a man die. Would you crucify Christ again if He showed up for a short visit?

The film is a pointing finger to you and me, folks. Don't look the other way. Don't blame the world for what you help to do.

Billy Wilder most Christian, or spiritual film. A critic of the media, social hypocrisy? No, that's only the surface. What I see is 2 worlds living together made up of lost souls and saved souls. For those who live on the fringes of both is this film dedicated. People like Mr. Tatum (Kirk Douglas) who have lived on the wild side and know the dark in-and-outs of corrupt and hypocritical society, not only the media but society as a mass of sinful persons. He lived in it, was part of the gang and since he wasn't faced with nothing better lived up to its expectation, he became a master reporter who almost sold his soul to the business. Almost, because when he meets this small town newspaper who won't admit anything but the Truth on its pages, a glimpse of the other side enters his life, a glimpse of salvation. Kicked out many previous big papers due to his bouts of alcoholism he ends up here, to his luck, that is... to his death and resurrection as a new man. he will have to pay with his life, but as the Christian teaching goes: Those who will want to save their life will lose it, and those who will want to give it up for the sake of Him (God) will save it.

Of course most people won't see this message here, a deeply spiritual message that poises a question to each viewer: Are you part of the crowd who congregates to see a dying man and enjoy the show, shed a hypocritical tear and live on, or are you willing to give yourself up in order to save your soul? For Mr. Tatum is took a lot of thinking and a lot of twists and turns to make him realize which was the best option. It didn't have to end up like that but better that that lose Salvation.

One of the best 10 films ever.

The extra disc has a fine conversation piece by Wilder and small comments by Mathaus and Lemmon. Wilder is really himself here, and enjoys the talk.",1186358400,9,3178,4.277870216306156
1141855,5,7885887014,"It would be easy to dismiss ""Ace in the Hole"" as a work of cynicism if their weren't so many resounding truths in it.  It was definitely ahead of it's time.  The film I think I would compare it to would be ""Network"" in it's forboding depiction of media manipulation.  I think the film's relative obscurity lays in the fact that director Billy Wilder doesn't lay the blame squarely in the lap of journalists.  The mass public can be blamed for allowing themselves to be taken in.  Wilder has concocted dialogue here that has the sting of arsenic.  If you don't get the point you weren't paying attention.  There are few redeeming characters here with the exception of an editor played by Porter Hall and they're drowned out by the sideshow atmosphere.  Kirk Douglas commands the screen as Chuck Tatum, who not only covers the man trapped in the mine story but orchestrates the ensuing circus.  Tatum's reasons for being a journalist are for anything but altruistic reasons and Douglas perfectly conveys the character's self-loathing.  Jan Sterling is equally good as the trapped man's wife who quickly forgets his plight to cash in on his misfortune.  What I found interesting is Joe Public is represented by Frank Cady better known to most people as Sam Drucker on TV's ""Green Acres"".  Such a kindly fixture would be the face of the gullible populace.  Billy Wilder's screen canon is so impressive and varied that it's difficult to say where ""Ace in the Hole"" falls.

The most plausible explanation I can think of is that the newspaper biz paid someone off to keep quiet as to how great this movie is.

1141858,5,7885887014,"KIRK DOUGLAS was always a dependable actor and occasionally brilliant when he had a good script and a good director. Here he has both, and he's in his element with Billy Wilder's direction making the most of a cynical story of a reporter exploiting human drama for his own benefit.

JAN STERLING, as the trapped man's wife, matches Douglas for toughness every step of the way. ""I met a lot of hard-boiled eggs in my time,"" she tells Douglas, whom she sees through with his scheme of profiteering from the accident. ""But you're twenty minutes."" A few more cynical remarks and he's smacking her across the face twice.

No one looks any good, as far as the characters go. The gawkers are shown to be the sort that stare at accidents and are soon turning Sterling's tacky establishment into a gold mine. The cynical screenplay catches all of the nuances of the exploited situation and Douglas comes up with remarks like, ""Tomorrow that will be yesterday's news and they'll wrap a fish in it."" As the arrogant man who delays the rescue to milk the situation for the most he can get out of it, KIRK DOUGLAS gives a riveting performance as an opportunistic heel. He never tries to soften the part, nor does director Wilder ever shy away from exposing the hypocrisy at work.

Still a very timely story and expose of hypocrisy on several levels by the press and public. RICHARD BENEDICT as the trapped man and ROBERT ARTHUR as a naive young reporter are both excellent in strong supporting roles.

1141860,5,7885887014,"There's always a reason why undiscovered masterpieces should remain undiscovered; usually it's because upon discovery, they prove to be less than masterpieces. However, make no mistake: the recent release of Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole proves that the film is a masterpiece, unquestionably the crowning jewel in the career of the man who brought us Sunset Boulevard, Some Like it Hot and The Apartment. Why then has this film been all but completely unavailable for the last 50 years? Maybe because, although a masterpiece, Ace in the Hole is a bitterly toxic masterpiece, one that makes us all look at ourselves and the way we allow, even encourage, the media to exploit us and the truth to maximize profits. It's the tale of a venal and amoral newspaperman, played venomously and brilliantly by Kirk Douglas, who, down on his luck, stumbles on a story in the desert. A down-at-the-heels resort, an ancient Native American gravesite, has trapped the proprietor in a cave under a mountain. A quick rescue and a single day's news is the logical solution. But logic isn't always profitable; extend the rescue for days, weeks if possible, draw a crowd, build the story, make it last, sell newspapers, make money. What does it matter if some poor schmuck is slowly being buried alive? Parlaying the story, controlling the story, until every big city newspaper will pay anything for the exclusive dispatches, that's the trick. Let it attract crowds; they will spend money; hell, they will even build a carnival with a Ferris wheel. Suffice to say, Ace in the Hole is not a pretty story. Wilder made this film directly after Sunset Boulevard and just before Stalag 17. When the film tanked, Paramount in its wisdom figured that women wouldn't go to see it because they thought it was a gambling movie, so it was re-released as The Big Carnival, equally unsuccessful. Given the audience in 1951, the title wouldn't have mattered. When Wilder was refused his profit sharing on Stalag 17 to pay off Ace, he became so angry he left Paramount. And the film was buried, but not forgotten. Once seen, this masterpiece can never be forgotten. And that's some news.",1185580800,4,2153,4.869209809264305
1141861,5,7885887014,"ACE IN THE HOLE (1951, Paramount) is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made...and one of the bleakest.  In it, Billy Wilder explores the way an ordinary man can become a bizarre media hero and attract hundreds of spectators to a freak show.  Stuck in Albuquerque, cynical reporter Chuck Tatum (a never-better Kirk Douglas) sees a chance to ride back to the top of the journalism world with the story of a man named Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) trapped in Indian caves out in a desert town called Escudero.  Milking the story for all it's worth, Tatum and Leo both become national media superstars.  Stuck on the sidelines inside a desert trading post is Leo's non-grieving wife Lorraine (Jan Sterling).  Tatum beats her up a few times and tells her to play the grieving widow.

This is a dark and uncompromising movie gem that director/producer/co-writer Wilder got made exactly as he wanted inside a studio system (no mean feat!) because he had just done the magnificent SUNSET BLVD.  (The ACE screenplay was Oscar-nominated.)  The B&W cinematography is brilliant, and the lighting inside the cave is a wonder.  This is a tough movie even by Wilder standards, and it sadly gets better with age in terms of what it says about media worship and journalism.  There is even a theme song, ""We're Coming to See You, Leo"" sung by a cowboy amid literally hundreds of curious people.  The source material is a 1925 mine cave-in with a guy named Floyd Collins.  Also outstanding are Porter Hall as Tatum's Albuquerque boss and Bob Arthur as Herbie the photographer.  If you can stand the unrelenting cynicism, ACE IN THE HOLE is a masterpiece.

It is also now out (AT LAST!) from the prestigious Criterion Collection with a ton of disk two bonuses:  a superb 60 minute chat with Billy Wilder about his entire life inside his office, inside his art-laden apartment, and at a beach cottage; a 1958 chat with Kirk Douglas and a short audio-only conversation with co-writer Walter Newman; a 1986 conversation with Wilder at the American Film Institute about his whole career; and a new video afterword by Spike Lee, who adores the movie.  Disk one includes a digitally-remastered print of the movie, as well as the original theatrical trailer and an audio commentary by film scholar Neil Sinyard, which I did not play this time.  As if all this were not enough, there is also included a mock newspaper bonus with new appreciations by critics Molly Haskell and Guy Maddin for a movie that was a box office and critical disaster in 1951 and retitled THE BIG CARNIVAL for a time.  Leonard Maltin still calls it by that title and still only gives it a *** review.

This Criterion edition is worthy of a movie knockout that will leave you floored by its raw power and uncompromised darkness.  More than any other movie I can think of, ACE IN THE HOLE really tells the truth about the media and way journalism can sometimes create superstars and draw huge crowds of spectators from reporters walking over everyone to get to the top of the game.  Better have smelling salts handy for the bleak ending.",1185148800,5,3089,4.736448598130841
1141862,5,7885887014,"Following such masterpieces as Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard, Billy Wilder's lesser known and widely underappreciated film noir Ace in the Hole retained the bleak and somber outlook on humanity of its predecessors, while weaving a brilliantly stark drama of murderous ambition and selfish ingenuity. With a tour de force performance by Kirk Douglas, Wilder's 10th film reveals a fascinatingly powerful social commentary on the sensationalism of the press and the morbid infatuation of the media.

Charlie ""Chuck"" Tatum (Kirk Douglas) is a fast-talking, hard-hitting, arrogant, and ambitious New York newspaper reporter who's been fired one too many times and winds up penniless in Albuquerque, New Mexico where he strong-arms his way into a job writing for the local paper. Biding his time for one big story that will push him into the spotlight and possibly get him his fancy New York job back, a year goes by with only ""good"" news (""bad news sells best, good news is no news"") leaving him little opportunity to regain his notoriety. On a routine assignment, Tatum happens upon a story worthy of his nefarious talents - an unfortunate treasure hunter, Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) is trapped in the crumbling caves of an old Indian tomb, and Chuck knows just how to spin the story. Recalling the big news success of an earlier, similar incident, Tatum quickly begins setting in motion plans, contacts, and influences to drag out the one-day rescue operation into a seven-day catastrophic media circus in the hopes of drumming up publicity to suit his selfish ambitions. But he may discover too late that the price of human life in the chaotic ""big carnival"" is worth as little as his own soulless intentions and that he is as cut off from redemption as Leo is from the hope of escape.

As astoundingly potent and commanding as Wilder's theme of media corruption is Kirk Douglas' performance as the headstrong Charlie Tatum. Paralleling such determination and cynical bravado as Gary Cooper's Howard Roark and Orson Welles' Charles Foster Kane, Tatum runs the show and holds complete control over the disastrous situation, from those in charge of the rescue to the town Sheriff to even the other reporters and their access to information. Rarely does such a uniquely abrasive and stunningly charismatic character come alive on the screen. Add to this the fact that he is corrupt in his morals, unethical in his tactics, deceptive in his manner, and dishonest through and through - he is ultimately the ""bad guy,"" and yet he commands such presence that we follow his actions with both disgust and admiration, and simultaneously condemn and cheer him on. He is an antihero of the most extreme degree, but also a tragic one whose faults are numerous and whose final revelation comes too late if ever at all.

As corrupted as Tatum is, so too are the others that stand to benefit from Leo's predicament. The rescue operation planner is easily convinced to use an alternate method of excavation, one that will delay success long enough to create a media frenzy and false sympathy. The town Sheriff seeks re-election and Tatum agrees to portray him as a savior and dedicated worker for the people in exchange for story exclusivity. Even Leo's ""caring"" wife only stays to extort the influx of travelers who wish to view the proceedings, and Charlie's young assistant Herbie quickly becomes engrossed in the excitingly hectic and escalating hysteria. No one is saved from the corruption of the media and its deceitful promises, and as Wilder suggests, so too is the audience for participating in this carnivalistic spectacle.

In a cryptic retort to Leo's tragic circumstances, Tatum states that ""I don't make things happen, I just write about them."" An ironically foreboding statement, and one that reflects society's infatuation with ""bad news"" and the media's willingness to deliver it. The rescue attempt rapidly escalates into a three-ring circus with Tatum's sensationalistic exaggerations and buttered-up reporting, and then becomes one literally when Mrs. Minosa allows a carnival to set up at the mountainside to increase profits (a double-entendre for the film's second title, The Big Carnival, one as ironically befitting as its original). In a moment of blood loss and mental clarity (should you choose to see it as such), Tatum realizes the damage he's done to create his ""Great Human Interest Story,"" but as he attempts to rectify what he can, a far grimmer truth reveals itself - no longer does anyone believe him, even in his utmost sincerity. And in a dramatic closing scene that rivals any in cinematic history, we witness our antihero's revelation of his own humanity lost in the quest to exploit another's.

As with ""If...,"" ""Army of Shadows,"" and a half-dozen other films, the ever-reliable Criterion has once again brought us a classic that, for whatever reason, went way too long without a home release. For all the great films he made (""Sunset Boulevard,"" ""Double Indemnity"" and Best Picture winner ""The Apartment"" among them), Billy Wilder doesn't get mentioned as often as he deserves when critics rattle off the names of the finest directors in cinema history. A reassessment of this forgotten film, however, should help the status of Wilder's reputation. (Much) Later remade by Costa-Gavras as ""Mad City"" and based loosely on the real-life story of Floyd Collins, who was trapped and later died in a cave in Kentucky in 1925, ""Ace in the Hole"" was well ahead of its time in its exploration of media ethics and America's fickle fascination with human interest suffering.

1141985,5,7885887014,"After many years of legal haggling, this mind-boggling film is finally available to the public. In it, Wilder translated his love-hate relationship with America -- its exuberant optimism and repressive conservatism, its inspiring idealism and appalling commercialism -- into gripping, hilarious, and heart-breaking drama. Despite a sparkling script, irresistable pacing, and A-list actors in some of their finest roles, it was all much too much for 1951. In 2007, it makes Michael Moore look old hat.

The profound effect this movie has had on my attitude towards the greedy and the exploitive in our society is enormous.

Kirk starts out needing a job, any job even if he feels it is beneath him. Gets the job and plays ""the news story game"" but finally sees what he has created in getting ""the story"". The ""big carnival"" atmosphere makes you cringe you are a member of the human race.

1141989,5,7885887014,"At last, at last, Wilder's finest film, ""Ace In The Hole"" (AKA ""The Big Carnival"") is released on DVD. For those without TCM (it's been run several times in the last month or two), you will now finally be able to see a film swimming in deep cynicism as well as experience one of the coldest characters every recorded on film - Jan Sterling's ""grieving"" wife. She is the female mirror to Kirk Douglas' down-on-his-luck, cruel Chuck Tatum.

More relevant in these media-frenzied times than when it was made, ""Ace. . ."" still packs a wallop in reminding us of the power of the press to manipulate (in Tatum's case for self-aggrandizment).

I first saw this film when I was about 8 or 9 years old. I couldn't grasp the story's nuances, but it sure put the zap on my pre-pubescent head.

Wonderfully acted from a great script under Wilder's sure hand, ""Ace In The Hole"" is a cinematic treasure not to be missed. (Especially for Wilder fans.) This is Wilder's masterpiece.

Thank you Criterion!

In short:

Reporter Chuck tatum (Kirk Douglas who's been kicked off every major US paper) ruthlessly exploits a man trapped in a cave he chances upon while on his way to cover a rattlesnake hunt (how fitting) for an Albuquerque daily. While an engineer promises to get the man out in hours, Reporter Tatum, and a corrupt sherrif, lean on the engineer to bore through rock. A process that'll take a week.

Tatum sells the story to the majors who lap it up. When the news breaks nationwide, thousands descend on the disaster. The scenes of the carnival invited by Leo's wife (Jan Sterling) to set up and cheesy country western singer twanging a guitar while singing about poor Leo (the trapped man), are powerful.

O Leo, Leo, Leee-Oooo

We're Coming Leo",1177804800,5,1742,4.648208469055374
1141990,5,7885887014,"First of all, I want to remind people how amazing it is that Wilder managed to get this withering assessment of capitalism and the mass media made while deep in the bowels of the McCarthy era (1951) when anyone who didn't wave their pompoms for the great US of A and everything it stood for, usually got hauled in front of a Congressional committee of some sort or other. As miraculous in its own way as Marcel Carne's ""Children of Paradise"" getting made during the Nazi occupation of France.

Now how can you look at the Tatum character today and not see Karl Rove? Amazing!

This movie seamlessly weaves a great story into several still-timely themes, such as the mining of tragedy for profit; the distortion and manipulation of reality by the mass media for profit and circulation; the exploitation of the environment and disrespect of native peoples; the human foible of scrabbling onto the coattails of a media event for the mean purpose of self-aggrandizement.  Man, this film is a veritable treasure trove of significant cultural phenomena.  And to think it was made BEFORE television, satellite and the Internet! Wow.

The picture's literal ""Ace in the Hole"" is young Leo Cole, a young miner trapped by an avalanche in a mine shaft.  He becomes Tatum's ""ace in the hole"" for a big story and self-glorification.  Cole, in his native goodness and naivete, is almost a Christ like figure, totally beyond and ethically superior to the maggots swarming about his fate.

If this picture doesn't break your heart, you don't have one.",1175385600,4,1534,4.82824427480916

Now more than ever the similarity between  real life and the media is reflected in this classic. I could go on and on about Kirk's great performance and Billy Wilder's great direction, but I would rather let the movie speak for itself.

Enough of my whining, here again are some other classics that deserve to be put on DVD ASAP!

Ride The Pink Horse

The Great Sinner

The Actress

I'll stop there for now.  But if anyone knows where we could write or vote on a selection of movies that have yet to be put on DVD, please let me know.

7900505,5,7885887014,"Review of Ace in the Hole
Hot Toasty Rag, January 4, 2017

Billy Wilder, Lesser Samuels, and Walter Newmans screenplay was nominated during the 1952 Oscars, but no other element of Ace in the Hole was honored that year. For the life of me, I cant see how An American in Paris beat this masterpiece out of a golden statue.

Kirk Douglas plays a hotshot journalist who, due to his somewhat difficult personality, isn't working for a big newspaper anymore. The only job he can get is in the small town of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Kirk is desperate for a big story, and when Richard Benedict, a local townsman, gets trapped in an old coal mine, he decides to turn the accident to his advantage. Before long, other news outlets are jumping on the story and tourists are putting Albuquerque on the map.

Did you see All About Steve? Remember the second half of the film where Sandra Bullock gets trapped in the abandoned mine and all the newspeople exploit her situation for their own benefit? If you thought the social commentary aspect of that quirky comedy was interesting, youll love Ace in the Hole. Granted, this movie is a heavy drama, so its very different, but the story is one gigantic diatribe about peoples selfish nature. Sometimes social commentary movies are tough to take because either the humor is distorted or the metaphors are too obvious, but Ace in the Hole nails it. This movie is fantastic, even though youll probably feel like you need a shower afterwards.

Kirk Douglas gives a fantastic, multi-layered performance thats one of the best in his career. In my humble opinionand this comes from decades of crushing on bad boysno one makes anger look as good as Kirk Douglas. The sexual tension between him and Jan Sterling scorches off the screen. If you didn't think Kirk was a total hunk before, you absolutely will after watching this movie.

But enough about the eye candy. Youve got plenty of other reasons to watch this film, and I recommend you do the next time you're in the mood for a movie that really matters.",1515024000,,2037,4.662952646239554

7900507,4,7885887014,"Nobody comes out of this story looking good, except perhaps for the victim.

The carnival atmosphere is almost heart wrenching. And some amazing lines:

""I don't bother to go to church. Kneeling bags my nylons.""

""Bad news sells best. Cause good news is no news.""

""I've done a lot of lying in my time. I've lied to men who wear belts. I've lied to men who wear suspenders. But I'd never be so stupid as to lie to a man who wears both belt and suspenders.""

""Human interest. You pick up the paper, you read about 84 men or 284, or a million men, like in a Chinese famine. You read it, but it doesn't say with you. One man's different, you want to know all about him. That's human interest.""

Wilder at his most hard and sarcastic.
