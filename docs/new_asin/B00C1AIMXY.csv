5685224,5,B00C1AIMXY,"Curious George is the cutest monkey in the world. Two DVD set of whole season 6 in the price of one, is a definately MUST buy!! Buy this for your children, they will love it, guarantee!
Is true that there are repeated episolds already from other DVDs in here. But if you are true Curious George's fan, you will buy it. Again, 2 disc in the price of 1 disc, so why not buy it for your children.",1370304000,2,393,4.051282051282051
5685225,3,B00C1AIMXY,"I don't have the complete episode list handy, but I know at least 5 or more of the episodes on this set were on previous DVD releases.  I went to Target today to pick this up, and glad I looked at the list on the back, alot of the titles sounded familar, so I didn't buy it.  I looked at some of our other George DVDs mostly the most recent 2 or 3 sets and saw some of the same titles.  I don't really track how a season of these PBS shows are structured or what's from what season, but I sorta assumed when I saw this title announced it would be all new content.  Glad I didn't buy it without seeing the episode list.  So just a word of caution.

School of Dance, DJ George, Sock Monkey Opera, George and Allie's Automated Car Wash are on Volume 20 ""Dance Party"".

We really love the earlier seasons though, seemed like the stories were much better and more down to earth.  As with any show quality drops so far in as they run out of ideas and need to come up with weirder stories and add new and sometimes annoying characters (Ally Whoops anyone?).  I love that they put out Season One as a complete season and wish 2-5 would come out soon.

George Buys a Kite, and Train of Light are on Volume 19 ""Saves the Day""

Ok, so 6 are duplicates that I can confirm.  I just checked the episode listings on the backs of the 3 most recent releases before S6.",1370304000,17,1351,4.095057034220532

5685240,5,B00C1AIMXY,"Cute show.  My two-year-olds love it.  The man in the yellow hat isn't very bright, because he never learns not to leave George in charge.  We get bored enough ourselves watching it that we start dreaming up things to wonder about, like if there's something going on between the man in the yellow hat and Professor Wiseman ;-)  This is a very calm, gentle show for small children.",1465084800,,380,4.544117647058823

We watch all of the seasons on Netflix at home, and this collection has been well-received in the back seat on some long road trips.",1425513600,,417,4.726027397260274

5685279,2,B00C1AIMXY,Giving it a 2 instead of a 1 because it's nice to get all the episodes to a season in one spot even if it does have repeats.  Would have been a 5 except for the live action segments are missing.  All the previous Curious George DVDs for the television show have included the accompanying live action segments showing kids doing something based on a concept in the show.  These are not included in the DVD and as such the old format of the first 19 bright yellow DVDs is a better format..,1421193600,4,487,4.21505376344086

5685299,5,B00C1AIMXY,I have no idea why Season 6 is less cheaper than other seasons. This is a great selection of shows that is entertaining and educational. I am glad my son enjoys this monkey so much. He has watched these 2 dvd's often and the selection between the shows is great so he is not asking for a new dvd after a show or two.,1401062400,,316,3.953125

We don't let our one year old son watch much TV but this is one of two exceptions (The Cat in the Hat Knows A Lot About That being the other) and he absolutely loves it.  Great stories, many good lessons and a very positive overall message.  As many have pointed out the DVD does not include the live clips of the school kids between episodes, as the PBS series does.  It is slightly missed, but definitely not worth skipping the DVD set for.",1382745600,,485,4.182795698924731

5685313,5,B00C1AIMXY,"I really like having a whole season, 22 stories, on 2 DVDs.  Curious George stories are wonderful for small children -- no violence, very positive, educational and entertaining.  Children relate to Curious George who is small, has limited communication skills, wants to help but sometimes messes up.  My grandson loves watching the shows and I enjoy watching them with him.

I recommend this DVD to anyone with 2 - 6 year old children.",1378598400,,435,4.917808219178082
