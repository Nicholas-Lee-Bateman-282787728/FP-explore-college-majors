5453415,5,B00AMSM9EK,I've been looking for the 1970 Version of out-of-towners since I was a kid and it's taking me about 15 years to find it I'm so excited and pleased with this product,1418860800,,164,4.15625

5453417,5,B00AMSM9EK,"We have viewed the Original(1970) version, and also the 1999 version with Goldie Hawn & Steve Martin. The story is absolutely hilarious, with lots of laugh-out-loud scenes. We like both versions, and Steve Martin & Goldie Hawn can always spice-up comedy. Acting Performance is Superb in both editions, and the funny story entertains throughout. If you want a few laughs, this movie will satisfy throughout. It's the kind of comedy that you can watch over-and-over, and still enjoy. Highly recommended!",1415318400,2,501,5.275

5453420,5,B00AMSM9EK,"The DVD was in great condition.  The packaging was very nice.  I know I will enjoy it, but at this time I have not had time to watch the movie itself.  It looks very clean and I am sure it will be okay.",1392336000,,202,3.6511627906976742

I would recommend this to my friends.",1388793600,,169,4.121212121212121
5453422,5,B00AMSM9EK,The original one was really hilarious but the second one was garbage.  Don't waste your time buying the double feature. Just get the original one.,1381363200,2,146,4.84
8554151,5,B00AMSM9EK,"One of, if not THE best Neil Simon work.  Nothing against the later version, but nobody compares with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis.",1527206400,,131,4.695652173913044

The original & the remake in one package.

A must have for your library.

8554160,5,B00AMSM9EK,I enjoyed the original but it is great having the new version also. Each shows the same plot but with a different slant on the personalities the actors portray. Goldie and Steve do a good job of adding their own unique personalities to the characters.,1426550400,2,251,4.6
