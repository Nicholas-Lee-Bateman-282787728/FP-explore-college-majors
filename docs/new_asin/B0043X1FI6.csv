Specific""nuggets""of info contained in this DVD include something every Detroiter knows to have been true,such as the""unique""and EXTREMELY effective way the""Y.B.I""would""recruit""youths Downtown at the Ethnic Festivals,by walking up to them,slapping them in the face with a""knot""of dollars,then throwing this WAD of cold,hard CASH at their feet,and saying:""Come and""roll""(sell drugs)for me,right NOW,and that money is YOURS to KEEP!!"" Hey,it sure beat the heck outta the recruiting methods of the Armed Forces!! Butch Jones was SO""careful""in keeping HIS hands""clean""throughout""Y.B.I.s' domination of Detroits' narcotics industry that he""forced""the D.E.A to have to CREATE/concoct a law SPECIFICALLY to convict HIM!! So was born the""R.I.C.O""drug laws that could charge the""big men""behind major criminal enterprises,though they're never actually seen personally breaking a SINGLE law,or handling even a GRAM of dope!! ""Y.B.I. also STARTED the whole""bling""lifestyle(before it was even CALLED such)waaay back in '75,before lil'troll-looking country boys began rapping about being:""Blinged-out""and""hot"",as they brought""EXTRAVAGANT""living ""in-style""by strutting through""Northland""shopping-mall in '86 wearing SEVEN-HUNDRED and FIFTY dollar""Guess""denim jean/jacket sets HEAVILY-embellished with bright-red COBRA-skin""on the fringes,as well as BIG patches of red cobra-skin at the knees and elbows,to match with the red snakeskin bordering the edges of their""Cazal""frames,as $200.00""MCM""monogramed caps with brass""authenticity plate""crowned their heads,while a $10,000.00 GIANT 14k yellow-gold,diamond and ruby encrusted elephant-head medallion methodically swung from a 50-inch long,THICK and HEAVY""Turkish-Link"",while their left pinkie was""BURDENED""by the weight of an eighth of a POUND diamond speckled 14K nugget ring!!  Hailing from an oft-maligned and poverty-ridden city like Detroit,where there is/was little or NOTHING,to ""take pride in"",the""Young Boys""under the leadership of Jones began to take GREAT pride in personal APPEARANCE,a trend which continues in Detroit to THIS very day,as the young men here can be routinely seen wearing THOUSANDS of dollars worth of designer clothes,like""Versace"",""Pepe Jeans"",""Mauri""and""Mecca"",expensive anaconda baseball caps and even THOUSAND-dollar alligator GYM-shoes,while""marks""in other regions of the nation,think they're actually""dapper""in crusty denim jeans and an UNDERSHIRT!!
