8547069,2,B00A6QPHCY,Did not play in my DVD player. It would only play on my computer. Was not the Tree Fu Tom we watch on Sprout.,1459296000,,109,3.5833333333333335
8547070,5,B00A6QPHCY,"So good to have a DVD that doesn't have violence and weapons, includes some exercise and requires feedback from the kids watching it.  My kids are often playing ""tree fu tom"" outside as well.",1394582400,,191,4.617647058823529
8547071,1,B00A6QPHCY,this disc was not advertised with the fact it only can be used on certain machines..my grandson loves this show and was in icu in hospital I thought this would cheer him up and I was disappointed  that we told him it was coming and then could not produce..just disappointed ..u should advertise this correctly,1384819200,3,309,4.618181818181818
8547072,3,B00A6QPHCY,"We couldn't play this on our DVD player in the US.  We had to use our XBOX to play it.  Also, if you're looking for the American version, this isn't it.  Tom has a British accent...which confused our kiddo.  By cartoon #3 he was used to it, but it is a bit different.",1380758400,3,267,3.981132075471698
8547073,4,B00A6QPHCY,It is a great DVD for children only problem its on the PAL system and can not  not be played in Canada unless you have a player that converts it. That was really disappointing.,1362009600,5,176,4.176470588235294
