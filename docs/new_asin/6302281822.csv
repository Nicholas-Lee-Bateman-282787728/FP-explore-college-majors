447773,3,6302281822,"This under-rated film in the Astaire canon deserves another look.  Not for its mediocre merits as a musical comedy or its sparkle-less gaucheness as a romantic comedy.  No.  This is one of the great explorations of the Astaire persona.  Mr. Top Hat and Tails is put in a squalid army environment, and roundly subverts it with lies and disguises, injecting the surreal, and having startling homoerotic dreams.  Furthermore, the 'gentleman' persona is exposed in primitive conditions is exposed as mendacious, cynical, cowardly, downright unpatriotic.  Extraordinary.",982108800,5,565,5.588235294117647
447774,4,6302281822,"The best of two pairings of Astaire and Hayworth on film.  Though Astaire and Rogers claim primacy amongst dancing partners, it is hard to imagine any actress who generates more heat and  incandescent charm onscreen than  Hayworth.  As lovely as he is talented, she holds her own surprisingly  well in a film that finds Astaire spending most of his time in a stockade  for going AWOL or somnabulent mishaps and mayhem.  His centerpiece number  ""since I kissed my baby goodbye"" by Cole Porter might be his  greatest solo  number of the 40's, beginning as a sly and ingenious bit of  improvisation.  The film also benefits from a superb supporting cast with  Robert Benchley as Astaire's unctuous boss who attempts to pursue Hayworth  while covering his adultery by passing off an unwilling (bold plot device  for the breathing world) Astaire as her boyfriend.  Astair e was eager to  work with Hayworth due to his friendship with her father (a fellow  choreographer) and it's not at all hard to discover why.  A goofy mid-war  comedy well worth using to stave off any rainy day.",946425600,27,1077,4.813186813186813

447868,3,6302281822,"Plotwise, I didn't find this film as well-structured as the films Astaire did with Rogers in the previous decade. It is a screwball mixed with slapstick comedy which leaps from place to place at a fast pace. At first, the relationship between Robert Alton, choreographer (played by Astaire) and Sheila (played by Hayworth) is strictly professional. From the stage, they end up in a night club, then Astaire ends in the army, where he realizes that he loves Sheila. Although the plot takes these enormous, incredible shifts, as a car zigzagging on the road, I still was able to enjoy this film. It was fun and many of its humorous scenes made me laugh. First of all, the musical numbers are great: a dancing duet with Astaire and Rogers followed by a dance number which includes a chorus dancing mixed rhythms by Cole Porter; Astaire dances with chorus Shootin' the Works for Uncle Sam; performs two solos in the (racially desegregated?) guardhouse accompanied by black musicians playing and singing Since I Kissed my Baby Goodbye and March Milastaire; and two more Astaire/Hayworth duets dancing to the tunes of So Near and Yet so Far and The Wedding Cake Walk. These numbers are excellently performed and why should I expect less from Astaire. Hayworth proves that she is a great dancer and actress. Another thing that keeps this movie alive are the humorous moments. Whether it is a scene where a cop attempts to give a parking ticket to Astaire for parking near a fire hydrant, the antics of the tongue twister Cliff Nazarro, Astaire's nightmare of being attacked by a rival with a pitchfork, Astaire's theft of a Captain's uniform and being caught at it, or the many ways in which Astaire lands in the guardhouse, the film remains fun between the musical numbers. Thus, even if I don't find this movie as good as any of the Astaire/Rogers movies, it is still good enough to be watched and enjoyed because of the great musical numbers, Astaire and Hayworth, Cole Porter's music, and slapstick comedy.",1464134400,,2003,4.808695652173913

447907,5,6302281822,"there are those glorious technicolor musicals by mgm, the war-time betty grable + carmen miranda by Fox, the grittie biopic musicals by WB and then there are the Rita Hayworth Columbia musicals. This is one of the first musicals that Rita stars in as the lead (her previous musical, ""My Gal Sal"" being more of a supporting role) and what better way to be a leading lady in a musical than with the leading musical actor of that time, Fred Astaire.

It's hard to believe that the slender, sophisticated precise dancer like Astaire could have chemistry with the explosive, raw Latin energy of Hayworth's, but despite their age difference, they are absolutely stunning together. Their numbers are rather few, a short tap routine (which emphatically proves Rita's innate sense of rhythm), a latin rhumba number, ""Near yet so far,""  that is pleasantly long and romantically sweet, and the final ra ra ra number, complete with an ENTIRE chorus in wedding uniform.

It's a completely unbelievable plot, but there are certainly some zingers of a line and all characters are likeable.

NOW, if you were to ask me which i thought was the better astaire/hayworth movie between the 2 they shot together, I prefer this one.... there are a couple more routines in ""You were never lovelier"" and a better score, however ""You'll Never Get Rich"" has this quaint, charm of a musical that's similar to slipping into a snuggy~

Rita would claim that shooting this film into the days of ""Cover Girl"" in 1944 would be some of the happiest years of her life. It shows.",1439856000,,1543,4.785714285714286

448016,3,6302281822,"This cross between a backstage musical and a service comedy isn't one of either star's greats, but it nestles rather comfortably in the middle of their cvs as the kind of glossily executed forgettable studio fayre that fills in an hour-and-a-half pleasantly enough. The title sequence is probably the most memorable thing about it - the credits appearing as roadside signs - and the initial mistaken identity plot could have just as been tailored for Fred and Ginger, but Hayworth is particularly stunning to look at and Robert Benchley offers good comedic support as our hero's duplicitous producer. Columbia's general stodginess with musicals is not quite so apparent here, although with the exception of a guardhouse solo the numbers do lack the panache of the RKO or MGM films. Nonetheless, it's still light and amiable formulaic entertainment.

Columbia's DVD has a decent but not outstanding print and includes the original theatrical trailer",1361404800,,948,5.2368421052631575

This dance I could endlessly rewind to it again and again.  Raising her shoulders and putting her head back is Rita's dancing trade mark done from her early years.  I would recommend this movie to those who love to see dancing at its best.  The story is also quite good and simple comedy will never go astray.,1349568000,2,441,4.329268292682927
448020,3,6302281822,"Despite a promising combination of talent in providing the film score (Cole Porter) and principals (Fred Astaire paired for the first time with Rita Hayworth) I never found this movie really held my attention. There were no hit songs, though `Dream dancing' and the appropriately titled `So near yet so far' came closest. The dancing was excellent and Hayworth proved herself to be at least as able a talent as Ginger Rogers. The ensemble number `Wedding Cake Walk' that was staged by Robert Alton was also quite memorable; but this was not a film I would rush to see again. I felt the Astaire-Hayworth pairing worked much better in You Were Never Lovelier.

448022,4,6302281822,"You'll Never Get Rich(released Sept/41)is a better than average vehicle for Mr. Astaire,and is one of two films he would make for Columbia and with the same artist,Rita Hayworth. After having just finished working with the Artie Shaw band and Burgess Meredith in Second Chorus,he was on hiatus and out playing golf when three offers came in,two from Columbia(this and You Were Never Lovelier) and one from Paramount,Holiday Inn. Upon ""Rich's"" release the film did great box office and assuaged ""moaning minnie""(Fred's sister Adele's 'endearing' term for her brother)that all was still good in the Astaire universe.
The plot involves Astaire as dancer Robert Curtis who works for company owner Martin Cortland(the ever amusing Robert Benchley).Cortland has a wandering eye and his 15 year marriage is always a divorce away as he showers bauble's on every new chorus girl that catches his eye. Rita Hayworth as Sheila Withrop is just such a new dancer in the company and Cortland buys a bauble for her. However his wife,due to a flustered mix up of Cortland's own making,is on to his newest ""tryst"".His excuses t his wife are getting lamer and they are now starting to put Robert into harm's way. In fact when Robert is enlisted to help Cortland weasel his way out of his predicament with Sheila and wifey,Robert is eventually ""threatened"" with a gun by Sheila's boyfriend so Robert decides enough is enough and he enlists in the army.
Robert isn't exactly GI and gets on the wrong side of the sargent more often than not. One day he spies Sheila on the base and from then on he is hell bent on seeing her no matter the consequences. At one point he even goes to the extent of stealing a captains uniform and arriving at the home in which she is staying at in the camp. His act is soon outed as he finds out Sheila's boyfriend is a real captain. As a result of this and other faux pauxs he seems to spend more time in the guard house than out. Through it all the two fall in love,Robert of course before Sheila but Sheila comes on strong in the end.
Robert's old boss Cortland comes to the camp wanting to put a show on. Of course he enlists the aid of his old pal Robert...a for-free and talented performer. There is more,as Cortland has found a new ingenue  and wants HER in the lead instead of Sheila. But Robert is insistent on Sheila and it is around this time Sheila has freely admitted her affection for Robert. But a bracelet in Robert's apartment off base(he has to go AWOL to get there)with the initials of Cortland's ingenue,is found by Sheila. She wants nothing to do with him from that moment and this infuriates Robert to do a little blackmailing of his own starting with sicking Cortland's wife on his old boss.
The big show comes and Robert,unbeknownst to Sheila,has planted a real preacher into the show to marry them. When Sheila finds out she is beside herself. In the end Cortland comes clean with what exactly has been going on,revealing to Sheila it was HE who planted the bracelet meant for the ingenue and that Robert had nothing to do with any of it. Robert and Sheila live happily ever after.
There is nothing terribly inspiring with the plot,but there are some good sight gags off and on and Rita and Fred have some good chemistry together. There is also nothing inspiring about the music either,coming from Cole porter no less,but Fred as always could sing the New York phone book and it would sound great. During their first meeting Rita was awfully shy about working with Mr Astaire and Fred put Rita at ease as much as he could,such as talking about her father who he knew from vaudeville. Fred would say later that Rita was one of the fastest on the uptake of all of his partner's when it came to learning a dance routine. A few rehearsals,a break for lunch and when they returned she would have it nailed. Rita was terribly shy off camera but Fred was amazed that when that camera rolled this alter ego,so to speak,popped out of her and she became the actress we all see now. It's what brought her to the attention of studio owner Cohn in the first place. It was a pleasant shoot all around and Fred enjoyed working with Robert Benchley too. The feeling was quite mutual. Watch for a cameo appearance by Buster Keaton's long time associate Harold Goodwin in the scene in the house where Astaire gets outed as not a real captain.
Technically speaking the movie is generally clear and crisp but the film does show its age and has a few rough spots throughout and needs a good remastering. Having said that,the film stock in the 40s during wartime was not of the highest grade and many films of this period have the same problems,especially graininess. There are no extras except the trailers.
All in all not a great Astaire entry but an above average film with lots of humour throughout,and as usual no one could touch the peerless Mr Astaire with his terpsichorean feats of wonder. The film did so well the second one with Hayworth was a natural result. Recommended.",1336953600,,4996,4.6008968609865475

448055,4,6302281822,"Okay, let me bring you up to speed on the obscure meaning of the headline. See, a while back I was smitten by a film star, an old time black and white film star from the 1940s, Rita Hayworth. The film that sent me into a tailspin: the black and white <em>noir</em> classic Gilda where she played a ""good"" femme fatale who got in a jam with a no good monomaniacal crook. But that part is not important femme fatales, good or bad, get mixed up with wrong gees all the time. It's an occupational hazard. What is important though is that I got all swoony over lovely, alluring Rita. And as happens when I get my periodic ""bugs"" I had to go out and see what else she performed in. Of course Lady From Shang-hai came next. There she plays a ""bad"" blondish femme fatale (against a smitten Orson Welles). And now this film under review, You'll Never Get Rich. We are caught up.

Now the plot line here, the never-ending boy meets girl plot line that Hollywood mass-produced (and mass-produces) is pretty simple, except that it takes place in getting ready for World War II America and so military preparedness is part of the backdrop (although obvious this is before Pearl Harbor, after that event such shenanigans would seem unpatriotic). Broadway show dance man Fred Astaire is smitten, very smitten (join the line, Fred) by chorine dancer Rita who also has a sting of other men eating out of her hand, the important one being Fred's devilish Broadway boss, a married, a very married, shirt-chaser. And from there the hi-jinks begin leading to Fred's departure for the army as a refuse, and eventually, as those Hollywood boy meet girl things often did to the altar (in an unusual way here though, I`d say).

But forget the story line here. This thing, and righteously so, is strictly about Fred's dancing, dancing alone, dancing with a partner, dancing up a wall (oops that was another film) but dancing with so much style it is impossible to keep your eyes off him (saying how did he do that all the while). For style, grace, and physical moves every one of those guys you see on shows like Dancing With The Stars, well, just tell them to move on over, and watch a real pro. Hey, wait a minute, what about Rita? Ya, what about her. Here she is just along for the ride. She almost looks ""clumsy"" compared to him. She, however, has other charms, okay.",1292803200,,2345,4.515294117647059

448060,5,6302281822,"This is an excellent musical starring Fred Astaire with Rita Hayworth. Rita Hayworth proves that she is as good as Ginger Rogers in matching the dance steps or singing with Fred Astaire; the chemistry is great in spite of the fact there is 19 years of age difference. Rita and Fred look adorable in the dance picture, which won the hearts of Time magazine and they printed that on the cover page. The movie is well directed by Sidney Lanfield, and strongly supported by the music and lyrics of Cole Porter. There are two numbers of much interest: Astaire's solo dance in the guardhouse with a black jazz chorus called the Delta Rhythm Boys and ""Since I Kissed My Baby Goodbye."" The other number is Astaire and Hayworth's dress rehearsal ""So Near and Yet So Far,"" which shows Hayworth in a sheer black gown: They look beautiful together. The big finale is the ""Wedding Cake Walk"" with a chorus of war brides and soldiers, and Astaire and Hayworth dancing on top of a huge tank.

The plot of the movie is not so interesting; it shows Astaire as Robert Curtis, a Broadway dance director leaves the stage when he is drafted into the army. Rita Hayworth plays as Sheila Winthrop, a dancing partner of Curtis, and engaged to a captain in the army. Both her fianc&eacute;e and Curtis serve in the same army camp. When Curtis realizes that he is in love with Sheila Winthrop, hatches a plan to marry her. In the big number ""Wedding Cake Walk"" the two is supposed to marry on stage and the wedding ceremony is conducted by a real justice of the peace. The trick works and Winthrop suddenly becomes Mrs. Curtis for real, and she accepts that! This somewhat unrealistic considering the fact Sheila is engaged, and in love with her fianc&eacute;, Tom Barton (John Hubbard), but she is glad to become the wife of Robert Curtis!! The main attraction of the movie is not really the story but the dance and music of the two stars of the story. This movie is highly recommended to all fans of Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth.

448061,4,6302281822,"Barely five minutes into the film and only thirty seconds long, a small jewel is not to be missed in this vintage 1941 musical, as it ranks among the best dance numbers to be seen from the golden age of Hollywood. It's where Fred Astaire casually asks Rita Hayworth to follow him on a complex tap routine set to Cole Porter's ""Boogie Barcarole"". That Astaire performs flawlessly is to be expected, but the stunning 23-year old Hayworth is startling in her precision and lan. Not only is she absurdly beautiful in her crisp rehearsal togs, but she matches Astaire step for step with unbridled confidence and with her long, gorgeous gams perfectly synchronized with his. The rest of the number, performed with an army of similarly dressed dancers, is not nearly as exhilarating especially since the fusion between boogie-woogie and classical feels forced.

The movie itself, directed by Sidney Lanfield and written by Michael Fessier and Ernest Pagano, is a silly mistaken identity affair that feels lifted from one of Astaire's earlier pairings with Ginger Rogers and then retrofitted into a military theme. Hardly a stretch, he plays Bob Curtis, a Broadway dancer and choreographer who works for philandering producer Martin Cortland, played by Algonquin wit Robert Benchley. Cortland has his eyes on chorus dancer Sheila Winthrop and attempts to give her a diamond bracelet until his wife Julia mistakes the gift for her. He pretends the bracelet is from Curtis, which of course, leads to larger complications, especially when Curtis gets drafted and his superior officer turns out to be Sheila's intended fianc. Off the dance floor and in her first leading role, Hayworth, already in her 38th film, is charming as Sheila, although Frieda Inescort easily steals all her scenes as the deadpan Julia, a perfect match to the acerbic Benchley.

Lowbrow comic shenanigans are interspersed with the Robert Alton-choreographed musical numbers. The highlights are an impressive Astaire tap solo set to ""Since I Kissed My Baby Goodbye"" and two more duets with Hayworth - the alluring rumba, ""So Near and Yet So Far"", and the infectious ""Wedding Cake Walk"" where the pair get married amid a dress-alike chorus, do a mean Harlem shuffle and tap-dance atop a white cake shaped like a tank. In fact, opening two months before Pearl Harbor, the film portends the upcoming war with similarly patriotic ensemble numbers like ""Shootin' the Works for Uncle Sam"". The 2003 DVD includes trailers for this film as well as two classic Hayworth vehicles, the career-defining&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilda/dp/B00004XPPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilda</a>, and future husband Orson Welles' pulp classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lady-from-Shanghai/dp/B00004W229/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lady from Shanghai</a>.

I have found that the dancers after Ginger are much better in all respects.  Fred and Rita are just terrific together.  I also purchased their second movie, You'll Never Be Lovelier"".  What class!!!!",1179360000,2,356,5.068965517241379
448063,3,6302281822,"Released shortly before America's entry into the war, Columbia's ""You'll Never Get Rich"" is one of Fred Astaire's better films during the relatively dry period that extended from his last RKO film with Ginger Rogers to his first films at MGM...

Since leaving RKO and Ginger Rogers, Astaire had danced with Eleanor Powell in ""Broadway Melody of 1940"" and with Paulette Goddard in ""Second Chorus.""

In ""You'll Never Get Rich,"" he had a new partner in Rita Hayworth: a lushly beautiful redheaded actress who was being prepared for stardom in mostly low-budget films... She was a talented dancer who had worked with her family for many years in a vaudeville act called the Dancing Casinos...

""You'll Never Get Rich"" cast Astaire as Robert Curtis, a Broadway dance director who is drafted into the army... He becomes involved in an on-again, off-again romance with Sheila Winthrop (Hayworth), a beautiful chorus girl whose fianc is a captain in the army... The not-very-interesting plot is often interrupted for musical interludes... Astaire and Hayworth dance together twice--to the sensuous Latin beat of ""So Near and Yet So Far,"" and in ""The Wedding Cake Walk,"" a military finale which has a chorus of war brides and soldiers, plus the two stars, dancing atop a huge tank...

Astaire and Hayworth make an attractive dance team, although Hayworth seems a bit too formidable, too ""grand"" for Astaire's self-effacing style.... Astaire also has several numbers without Hayworth: most notably, a dance in a guardhouse to the song ""Since I Kissed My Baby Goodbye,"" in which he combines several kinds of dazzling footwork...

""You'll Never Get Rich"" is lightweight but amiable entertainment, and it kept Astaire dancing...",1168905600,,1715,5.154676258992806
448124,4,6302281822,"There can only be one Ginger Rogers. But after her, Rita Hayworth is an excelent partner for Fred Astaire. I have never been a fan of the ""military"" comedies or dramas, but this one is full of good moments. Ritas' performance is incredible and her timing is marvelous. They could have easily become the new duet for musicals in the fortys. It is a shame they only made two movies together.

In a few words, an excelent movie, beautifull dancing and a great chemistry between Rita and Fred. I truly recomend this film.",1142726400,5,517,4.559139784946237

448126,4,6302281822,"The picture quality on this dvd is excellent, much better than the video; it's well worth the price.

I have always enjoyed this film. It steps away from the elegance of the Fred and Ginger classics, yet it's breezy style is refreshing.
Fred's character is less high society...he enlists in the army as a private! That gives him a chance to engage in some wonderful Three Stooges-type comedy and gags with his supporting cast, including Robert Benchley....all the while Fred's being pursued by that luscious love goddess Rita Hayworth!!

Just the footage of Rita in this dvd is worth the price! A vibrant, sexy, beautiful woman. I also consider her to be Hollywood's best female dancer, i've never seen anyone so graceful.

Astaire and Hayworth are a stunning match on the dance floor, and you can actually see the joy between these two as they dance together effortlessly. Check out that first wham-bam Fred-Rita tap duet WOW!!  then there's their soaring, sensuous latin themed dance to Cole Porter's ""So Near and Yet So Far"".  Nothing is more fun than watching incredible choreography being danced with full abandon!!

 Fred also has TWO great tap solos and a couple of dances with the chorus. Wall to wall dancing throughout!! For musical fans who love dancing this film has tons of it!! It's a must have!!",1124064000,4,1310,4.8475336322869955
448127,2,6302281822,"This is not one of Fred's better efforts,  the dancing is so so and Rita Hayworth is among his poorest dance partners.  Lacks the glamor and sex appeal of the Astaire/Rogers films.  In spite of these shortcomings the film is worth watching.",1123545600,3,240,4.666666666666667
448128,4,6302281822,"I'm one of those for whom a second tier Fred Astaire film is still more enjoyable than just about anything without him.  And there is no question that Fred is at his best in this one.  Unfortunately, he just isn't given first-rate musical material around which to wrap his massive dancing abilities.  His partner is the extraordinarily capable Rita Hayworth, who spent her teenage years as her father's dance partner in the years when she was both abused by him and when she looked completely Hispanic (plastic surgery, skin lightening, and dying her hair transformed Rita Cansino into Rita Hayworth).  They really do make a nice couple, though Fred had the rare ability to make almost anyone look like they were born to dance with him.
The plot is fairly silly, but anyone who loves thirties and forties movies knows when to cut a film a bit of slack.  The cast is not outstanding beyond Fred and Rita, with the notable exception of Robert Benchley.  This was actually a crucial point in Benchley's career.  He had throughout the thirties maintained a dual movie career as the star of a string of hysterically funny one reelers, in which Benchley instructed the public on ""How to"" do things, such as ""How to Vote"" or ""How to Read.""  He actually made one of the first talking shorts still to be seen occasionally, ""The Sex Life of a Polyp"" (1928, a short that obviously couldn't have been made after 1934 and the imposition of the Code).  Benchley also made a host of appearances in rather unimportant films during the decade.  Starting with Hitchcock's FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, however, Benchley began appearing in much higher quality films, including such gems as THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR (in which he plays Ginger Rogers's nemesis) and I MARRIED A WITCH.  Unfortunately, he died in 1945.
The film was also extremely crucial for the career of Fred Astaire.  He had ended his mythic partnership with Ginger Rogers only two years earlier, and his two following films were both disappointments.  SECOND CHORUS was probably the worst film in Astaire's career, and BROADWAY MELODY OF 1940, while containing many wonderful moments, teamed him with legendary tap dancer Eleanor Powell.  Emending my statement above, these two did not mesh as dance partners.  Powell was too individual a performer, and excelled as a solo dancer, not as part of a team.  They also failed to generate any romantic chemistry.  YOU'LL NEVER GET RICH, while not a massive success, nonetheless reestablished him as a romantic dance star, and made six more films before his ""retirement"" in 1946 (he broke it as a favor to Gene Kelly in 1948 when Kelly broke his leg and was unable to film EASTER PARADE--the film ""unretired"" Astaire and he went on to make ten more musicals before retiring as a dancer).
So, this won't be the greatest musical anyone has ever seen, but it certainly won't be the worst.  No Astaire fan would dare to miss it.",1073260800,41,2908,4.805220883534137
448129,3,6302281822,"""You'll Never Get Rich"" is the first of two musicals Fred Astaire made with Columbia's resident bombshell - Rita Hayworth and although it's light, breezy and brimming to the ceiling with comedy and music - ironically, there's not much for the lovely Ms. Hayworth to do, except tap one solo and dance all too briefly in a contrived song with Astaire.  The plot focuses on Astaire's employer - Robert Benchley, whose roving eye gets him in perpetual hot water with his wife.  Currently, his eye is on Sheila (Hayworth).  But an unlikely affair begins, then stops, then starts up again when Sheila realizes she's falling in love - not with Benchley, but Astaire.  How's it end? - with music, fun and good humor; all main staples of the Hollywood film musical at its zenith.
TRANSFER: Well, considering the pure garbage Columbia has been giving classic film buffs of late (Talk of the Town, You Can't Take It With You, The Awful Truth) this DVD is looking pretty snappy!  The gray scale is accurately rendered - though several scenes look as though second or third generation film elements were used instead of an original camera negative.  There is a definite grain structure to this presentation.  Apart from that, the usual aliasing, edge enhancement and pixelization that has accompanied many Columbia titles is thankfully absent herein.  The audio is MONO but very nicely balanced and - for its vintage - natural sounding.
EXTRAS: ONLY A COUPLE OF THEATRICAL TRAILERS!!!
BOTTOM LINE: The follow up to this movie (You Were Never Lovelier) is far more engaging musical entertainment but this film showcases Astaire's tapping at some of its very best and it's refreshing to see the lovely Ms. Hayworth in fine comedic and dancing form!  Recommended.",1067040000,23,1747,4.935153583617748
448130,4,6302281822,"YNGR is the first of two films which paired Astaire and Hayworth as dancers, and I initially thought it was the lesser of the two pairings. But I have to admit this film- which puts its audience squarely into the start of World War II- is quite sharp, script-wise, and quite lyrical, music-wise. Astaire's dance director shows an early but distant attraction to chorus dancer Hayworth (and vice-versa), but is drafted into the Army (not to mention repeatedly banished to the guardhouse for various insubordinations) before they can live happily ever after. They were a sweet coupling (despite their 19-year age difference) and Hayworth, as others have mentioned, was quite a revelation as a tap and ballroom dancer. All of their dances are performances only, not love scenes (which are the duets I have always preferred), but they are sensational. The requisite 'big number' is the finale, the ""Wedding Cake Walk"" (you'll do a double-take at the last image of the tank-shaped wedding cake), and there is an ensemble dance at the start of the film called ""Boogie Barcarolle."" But two numbers stand out: Astaire's solo dance in the guardhouse, sung by a black jazz chorus (uncredited, but I believe called the Delta Rhythm Boys) and entitled ""Since I Kissed My Baby Goodbye."" It has a marvelous grace and elegance, not to mention a sensational vocal by lead Delta man Lucius Brooks. The other number is Astaire and Hayworth's dress rehearsal ""So Near and Yet So Far,"" a stunning rhumba which shows off Hayworth in a sheer black gown and expands into intricate layers of choreography. This is one of the last films to show Ms. Hayworth as a brunette; shortly after this outing she began doing Technicolor films, and her tresses went red forever after. Their follow-up film, ""You Were Never Lovelier,"" had more of the standard romantic shenanigans and more lyrical dance numbers, but this first one was more screwball comedy and, in a sense, more of a challenge to pull off.

448131,4,6302281822,"Fred Astaire meets the draft in this pre-war comedy, featuring Rita Hayworth as a chorine who capures his heart, although she naturally already has a beau, presenting Fred with a challenge he must overcome between stints in the stockade for going AWOL and various other infractions of military law.  This tart, well-scripted comedy is a little light on the dancing, but features some of the best, briskest dialogue that came Astaire's way, and a fine supporting cast, including the famous Hollywood ""double-talker,"" Cliff Nazarro, going through his routine in numerous scenes.  Hayworth dazzles, as usual, and Fred is in top form.  Cole Porter's compositions for this film are not his best work (in fact, I don't think a single tune stuck in my head after watching this one), but they don't detract from the overall charm of this super-fun, class act classic film.  Definitely recommended!",1054425600,3,889,5.110344827586207
448132,4,6302281822,"Not only did Fred Astaire get Ginger and Cyd, he also got Rita Hayworth. But he is so charming in this, you believe he can get Rita, and she is stunning as ever.
Fred starred in two movies with Rita Hayworth, this and ""You were Never Lovelier.""  The second beats this margially, just by having that cute matchmaker plot.  But in a lot of ways this movie is almost the better one.  The songs in this one don't come almost out of nowhere and the lipsyncing isn't downright obvious.
The writing in this movie was superb, witty lines all over the place.  Not forced lines, hoping to be quotable, like you see in the movies today.  The doghouse part in the movie was so lovable, didn't seem to look too much like punishment to me.
Martha Tilton sings a song at the end as well and definitely stands out.  She didn't seem to be a miscelleanous musical singer...too professional.",1053043200,51,872,4.452830188679245
448133,3,6302281822,"This Cole Porter musical is one I've beening trying to get my hands on for a long time. Well, I finally saw it, and I must admit, I was somewhat disappointed. Now, don't get me wrong. I love Cole Porter's music. He's my favorite composer of all time. I love watching Fred Astaire movies, even ones without Ginger Rogers, ""Three Little Words"" or ""Royal Wedding"". But, there's something about this movie that's missing.
 The beginning of the movie is fine. The story starts out with Robert Benchley (Playing an owner of a theathre Martin Cortland) who has a weakness for the ladies, despite the fact that he's married. Well, Cortland (Benchley) finds himself in trouble when his wife (Frieda Inescort) finds out about his advances, and not to mention a present to Sheila Winthrop (Rita Hayworth). Trying to clear himself, he tells his wife that he of course has no interest in any other woman, and that the present was really given by the director of the theathre, Robert Curtis (Fred Astaire). All of this sounds good, and it is enjoyable to watch. There are also some pretty funny lines along the way, but, the film has no sparkle. And, there are no songs!! Only 3 songs are sung by people, the rest are used for background, or danced to.
 One of the reasons I like to watch musicals are for the songs, but, when there are no songs, how can you call it a musical?! Plus, there doesn't seem to be anything special in the dance scenes between Astaire & Hayworth. There's no glamour to it. And the songs are not at the first rate level we'd expect from Cole Porter. The only song I enjoyed was ""So Near and Yet So Far"", which is kind of like the movie itself. It comes close to being great, but, it escapes itself. The film did have one song that was nominated for an Oscar, ""Since I Kissed My Baby Goodbye"", which Astaire does not sing, only dances to. The rest of the songs are ""The Wedding Cake Walk (Which is sung), Dream Dancing ( A charming song, that no one sings in this movie), & ""Shootin' the Works For Uncle Sam (This is sung by Astaire, only it's second rate Porter, at best).
 Since there are a few things about this movie I don't like, you have to be asking yourself, why am I giving it 3 stars (Which on my scale is a recommendation)? Well, I do think people should see this if they get the chance to. There are some funny moments to the film, and hearing Astaire sing ""So Near and Yet So Far"" is enjoyable. And the solo dance numbers by Astaire are fun to watch. The movie is not a total dud, but, we all know Fred Astaire has done better.
 Bottom-line: A somewhat enjoyable musical with a score by Cole Porter that doesn't quite hit his high level. Some good dance solos by Astaire, and some nice one-liners by Benchley give the film it's charm. Worth a look.",1032825600,2,2773,4.389105058365759
