2634705,4,B000HDRB6G,"I guess I never saw the final season of the show when it was in its first release because I don't remember any of the episodes. I own the other five seasons, so you can tell I'm a big fan of the series in general. I've watched most of the shows now on this 6th season set and I was really surprised. I kinda expected the last year to fall off in quality and to rehash a lot of the same schtick. But so far I've really liked every episode. By this time in the series the actors are all very comfortable with one another but the relationships don't feel stale to me. If you are inclined to like some of the other seasons, then you might want to take a chance on this one as well.",1170892800,25,677,3.948905109489051
2634706,5,B000HDRB6G,"Now that I have the complete set of 3rd Rock from the Sun in my collection I can disconnect the cable.  There is absolutely nothing to watch on TV anymore.  3rd Rock is sort of I Love Lucy if you were space aliens and the entertainment factor hits the top of the yardstick. There seem to be no taboo areas as far as 3rd Rock is concerned as they explore just about everything humans do, and they do it in the funniest ways.  I recommend 3rd Rock to anybody and everybody, you will never be bored; nor will you stop laughing at the antics of the High Commander and his crew.",1168473600,5,573,4.1441441441441444
2634707,5,B000HDRB6G,"We watch this as a family, with great enjoyment. JL & Co. do a great job of unpretentious fun combined with dealing with issues the kids can relate to, and benefit from. It is impressive, the skill they put into making it look easy.",1168473600,4,232,4.295454545454546

2634709,5,B000HDRB6G,"I have nearly every season of 3rd Rock.  This whole ensemble group is hilarious!  It was the perfect blend of slapstick and comedy mayhem.  In my opinion, it is the funniest sitcom ever!  If you're blue, buy SEASON I---- and get ready to laugh!",1166227200,6,244,4.4772727272727275
2634710,5,B000HDRB6G,"Here it is the sixth season of 3rd Rock from the Sun, 20 complete uncut episodes in all.  The season starts off with some very comical episodes, Fear and loathing in Rutherford, Red, White, & Dick, and Dick Soup for the Soul.  These are three of my favorite episodes, each containing many laughs.  From Dick finding out he is Canadian to Tommy's Sally assisted hazing in college.  The rest of the episodes each have their moments, as do all the episodes in the 3rd Rock from the Sun series.

Video and audio quality is excellent, no complaints.  Bonus features aplenty once again, but lack of a special Blooper section is a disappointment as they were very comical.  The alternative show ending introduction part 1 and part 2 are excellent bonus features additions however.

Do yourself a favor and complete your collection of 3rd Rock from the Sun, or use this release as an excuse to buy the complete series.  You will not regret it.",1165104000,13,935,4.652439024390244

2634732,3,B000HDRB6G,"As a long time 3rd Rock fan I will admit that this season is the lest appealing of the series. Tommy has gone off to college, and with him out of a good chunk of episodes you can tell that the writers weren't sure what to do with everyone. Lots of episodes felt like these lovable characters were chickens with their head cut off. Sometimes they'd have to relearn things they've gone through in previous seasons. Even out of this disappointing season, I thought the last four episodes were a great send of to this group of aliens.",1464652800,,530,4.418367346938775

2634762,3,B000HDRB6G,This is not a review about the show which is a definant 5 stars but for the crappy shell casing.  Both 3rd Rock and Roseannes rerelease of DVDs have been like this.  It's a one slot case with DVDs stacked in in a flimsy case.  Very cheap.,1423353600,,238,4.0212765957446805

2634770,4,B000HDRB6G,Really good copies of the episodes.  I still think these are the syndicated copies so they're a little shortened but high quality.

2634778,4,B000HDRB6G,"First off, my rating of this get's a star off because of the lack of bloopeers. You advertise bloopers, you better have them off. Shame Mill Creek, shame. Otherwise, same, well done season sets like the rest of the series. For soms reason, the fact that they knew they were being cancelled made them even funnier than before. It's quite a memorable, relentlessly hilarious season. On the subject of the series finale.....it was quite solemn wasn't it? I mighf preferred the alternate ending. It waa sooo Dick. Poor Mary.",1402358400,,520,4.853932584269663

2634781,3,B000HDRB6G,"First off, let me state my 3-star rating is strictly for this DVD set, not the show itself. The show I would give a 4-5 rating. It was a lot of fun to watch again after all these years and I still find the ending to be sad :(

As for the DVDs, my Disc 2 tried to skip on several episodes (Season 5 did the same thing) but I think the biggest issue was the false advertisement. The special features very clearly stated ""Season 6 Bloopers"". So where are they? I don't know about anybody else's set, but mine clearly states there are bloopers but I don't have any on any of the discs. :(  Between the disc problems and the lack of features it clearly states were supposed to be included this set had me disappointed, but it was well worth the $6 still either way to watch again after all this time.

For those who do buy this, if you were like me and saw an extended ending to the final episode when it aired on tv, it is included on the last disc in Special Features as the ""Alternate Ending"".  (No spoilers for those who don't want to know).",1389225600,,1040,4.108374384236453

2634785,5,B000HDRB6G,I have those old bulky dvd box set of 3rd rock sun shows but one..

2634788,5,B000HDRB6G,"If you want to laugh at silly, I mean silly, humans pretending to be aliens.  Than this show is for you. Don't let the cast fool ya, these guys are utterly humorous.  Even the supporting cast like, Don (Wayne Knight) and Nina (Simbe Khali) and Mrs. Dubcek (Elmarie Wendel).  This is a show that will have you doubled-over crying from side-splitting comedy. Such a rare breed of show.  Truly in a class by itself when it comes to original humor and delivery.  3rd Rock has NEVER not made me laugh.",1375315200,4,496,4.466666666666667

2634802,5,B000HDRB6G,"I loved 3rd Rock when it aired ten years ago (or more) so bought all six seasons on DVD when they came out.

2634807,4,B000HDRB6G,"With out giving the ending away, I will say that the ending is highly depressing.  They could have picked a better story-line.  On a positive note, I enjoyed Season 6 far better than Seasons 4 and 5, as the Sexual innuendo was TOO MUCH in previous seasons.  I like to watch this sitcom with my Son, and I hate feeling awkward when something explicit is said, especially since it's not funny half the time.  Comedy can be great with out all the filth.  The cast was brilliant.  I wish they would reunite.  :)",1361664000,2,507,4.387096774193548

Fortunately the show when out on a high unlike so many show that run until every nickle of advertising and budget are completely used up.

2634814,5,B000HDRB6G,"From Season 1 to 6, this is a terrific program.  There are no real extras other than interviews with cast members and guests about the characters they portray and some reviews of some of the episodes each season.

I would recommend 3rd Rock to anyone who likes farciful humor...... once you get to know the characters (particulary Dick), you really feel like they are the relatives you always enjoy from a distance.  John Lithgow must have studied John Cleese and Monty Python before this show was put together.  They are like twins separated at birth.  Mr. Cleese has a guest spot on the show, and you can see the mutual affection.

Note:  Amazon said they have to ask for reviews of each season when you purchase a television show with multiple seasons.  So please excuse the repitition in my review.",1360022400,,802,4.678571428571429
2634815,4,B000HDRB6G,"The product itself was perfect.  The DVD package and DVD weren't damaged in shipping, were both in good shape, and came in a timely manner.

The show itself?  Kind of a let down, really.  I've been waiting for the last two seasons of 3RFTS to come in for quite some time.  I was in high school and college when the show aired.  So I'd missed a lot of the episodes, and was especially excited to get to see the series finale.  I'd read syposes online, but most descriptions weren't very... well, descriptive.

What a disappointment.  Most of the espisodes in the final two seasons lacked the whacky camaradarie you see in the first four seasons.  I'm not sure if the writers were just running out of ideas, or if the actors were tired.  But they just don't seem to have the same ""feel"" as the first four seasons.  And there seemed to be a lot holes in the story line.

****SPOILER ALERT****

That Dick and Mary did not stay together was not necessarily a shocker - their relationship was always a bit tumultuous - it was disappointing that they string the relationship along a further two years with no real progress, and end the series with Mary laying on the ground with the keys to the car in her hand.  The show purports that above all else, they NEVER take themselves seriously.  But as many of Dicks rash decisions were based on his love of Mary, to so swiftly agree with Mary when she gets cold feet left me wanting.  The fact that Dick never really, truly considered staying behind was equally frustrating.

The same goes for Sally and Don.  The transition from them just not being able to end things with each other to an almost Casablancaian salute, ""I'll call ya'"" was swift, and unfulfilling.  After years of being on-again-off-again, I was surprised that Sally (yes, even as the Security Officer) didn't at least allude to the fact that she was an alien, or that she didn't decide to stay.  Again, I realize that they are - of a sort- minions who follow orders.  But they also showed several occaisions of rebellion.  That they so easily bowed to command was contra to their characters, I felt.

The characters Harry and Tommy were always more slapstick than substance throughout the series.  They added a necessary dose of healthy ""stupid laughs"" to the show.  Additionally,  Tommy's character added the youth-perspective, as told from an elderly alien, which I found clever.  But in the final season, Tommy's absence both physically and as a character is palpable and leaves a dent in the flow of the show.  And Harry's character is just dragged along for the ride.  He becomes a shadow, ever present in the ""world"" of his shipmates but severely lacking in any substance - comedic or otherwise.

If you've made it this far through the review, I thank you for your patience.  Having said ALLLL of the above, one cannot add that to NOT buy the final series if you've got the others is just asinine.  Despite it's flaws, it does wrap the series up in a little, bulgy purple, tubular package.  And besides, if you DON'T buy it you won't get to see the alternate ending that the show decided not to go with and which I found to be PERFECT (naturally).",1359849600,,3160,4.564056939501779
2634816,4,B000HDRB6G,"My husband and I watched the whole series a couple of episodes every night while eating supper.  The first couple of seasons were quite hilarious, but then it seemed to slide into nothing but sex. Such a shame, it was such a novelty.",1359763200,,233,4.4186046511627906
2634817,1,B000HDRB6G,"Let me start by saying i love amazon and i love this show, but when you buy mill creek entertainment dvds, you get what you pay for.  I bought this entire series in the mill creek version and over half of the discs FOR THE ENTIRE SERIES were scratched to the point where one or more of episodes skipped.  Some even caused the dvd player to lock up and take me straight to the menu, and these came BRAND NEW FACTORY SEALED from amazon.  And no, i don't have a cheap dvd player, its a brand new Sony blu-ray/dvd player that i have zero trouble with.  I am assuming the reason behind so many scratched dvds is the fact that all the discs are put in little cheesy paper sleeves.  I would stay away from the entire mill creek product line as they package their dvds in paper sleeves, guarentee them to scratch.",1359590400,2,805,4.235294117647059

I love the goofs/outtakes etc and was looking forward to that on this DVD (this feature is on other seasons) but it was lacking.
