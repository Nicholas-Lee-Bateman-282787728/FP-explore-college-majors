8225520,3,B000WTZ6B2,I think that this video is OK for a person just beginning a fitness program or just beginning a pilates-style program.  I don't find this program to be all that challenging and I have already had to order more advanced band workout videos.,1203638400,7,239,4.558139534883721
8225521,5,B000WTZ6B2,The best parts of Knight's workouts are that the workout is a bit slower than the other DVDs I've tried and  she makes a point to keep instructing you how to breathe. I feel that my workout is more focused and less rushed and that I'm actually able to do more because I'm using the correct breathing techniques.  I'm new to pilates but of the various DVDs I've tried this is by far my favorite.  After Knight's workout I feel stronger AND kind of relaxed from the breathing.  I've just ordered her other pilates DVD to see if it's as good.,1203292800,9,539,4.306930693069307
