I have seen it start to finish countless times.  I discovered it while in a deep depression and watching it always manages to remind me of why I want to live.  Ignore the over the top makeup of one insignificant character, and focus on the vibrant background, the relatable characters, and art depicted through the film, and you'll fall in love.",1518220800,,520,4.619565217391305

8458128,5,B0055E0JV6,This was a movie I watched on Netflix so i had to but the video copy. I was not much of a spanish movie watcher but since I watched this one I have found myself renting more and more spanish titles and it comes with subtitles for those who don't understand the language.,1396483200,2,270,4.113207547169812
