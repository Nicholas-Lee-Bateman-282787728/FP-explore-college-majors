8279606,5,6303365736,"Killy only does the inro and trailer section. Jens Husted and Chris Ryman skiing together,as in their Black Diamond video, do the demonstrations. Sybervison presents the skiers perfect turns from all angles, in slow motion and reverse photography so the viewer can see how all body parts work together in linking short and medium radius turns on moderate, steep, mogul and powder conditions. The Killy and Black Diamod tapes are both excellent. The music is great as well. Even though the tape was made 15 years ago the form is timeless. Watch this video several times a week during the ski season to implant the image of perfect turns in your head. Ski and watch again. You will improve. Add to this video Ellen Post Fosters Skiing and the Art of carving which describes the subtle differences with the new shaped Skis and your collection of training videos will be complete.",980121600,4,876,4.80794701986755
