4500361,5,B004YM6IZ6,"Best show to come a long ever! It is more realistic and believable. Fiona and Michael need a little more romance. Best of all,it is interesting enough for both men and women to enjoy together. Being Irish born,I can relate to them. We started watching it because there was nothing better on. And boy were we glad there was nothing better on. It has become our number one show,the only one we hate to miss. I can't wait to see the next episode. A big thank you to the writers and especially the actors who do an awesome job. Your fan sewma",1312588800,8,538,4.284313725490196

4500363,5,B004YM6IZ6,"Season 5 BURN NOTICE, Episode 2 BLOODLINES--Sexy, fun, action adventure shows that are eye candy and a distraction from the state of the world hardly ever unfold into real drama that takes your breath away. This particular episode of BURN NOTICE crashes into that barrier and blows it to smithereens. Having followed this program since its inception, I was more than steeped in the background of the main characters. It will certainly enhance your enjoyment of this if you know that the main character, Michael Weston, comes from a home where his abusive father ruled the roost. He is forced by deadly circumstances to treat his mother like his father did with necessary force. Sharon Gless steps up front and center with this well written episode that showcases her character's toughness. It outpaces her previous role as Christine Cagney by leaps and bounds. Don't get me wrong, she did stellar work in that role but this role is a treat for the audience and loyal fans of this show as well.

Wonder if Michael would go off the deep end if Maddie, his mom, were buried alive with a cell phone to keep her alive as her air runs out as he searches for her? Aside from Sharon Gless the emmy for writing such an epsidoe should go to whoever scripted this. A brave but very fulfilling journey and unexpected surprise that just ups the entertainment quotient of this fine series that much more.

Since I watched it on Amazon Video On Demand with a season TV pass, the only suggestion I would make is for them to show the trailer for the next episode. If I have a season pass it will wet my appetite. If I don't, it will entice me to get one so I don't miss any of the action.",1309478400,,1671,4.493421052631579

4500388,3,B004YM6IZ6,"My 3 stars are for season 5 only, I thoroughly enjoyed the preceding seasons and I haven't started watching the remaining yet, but I hope they revisit the quality of the first few. The writing for season 5 seemed sloppy and often disjointed, sometimes to the point of insulting the viewer's intelligence. Details were often overlooked, or overexplained due to the unrealistic nature of the episode. They also really seemed to push low-key liberal propaganda on topics like gun control, funny since the show relies on action-packed shoot-outs in every other scene, and others like portraying militias as ignorant hicks with no sense of honor or duty to country (not denying that some wannabe militias are just that, however, not all are that way), two instances of attacks on the 2nd amendment. In retrospect, the show seemed to become more political with each season. Something else that takes away from this season is Michael constantly condescendingly yelling at the bad guys, more so than in any of the previous seasons, like in every episode. While it isn't directed at the audience, it still gets annoying fast. It's as though the yelling is a distraction from the poor script writing and thin, predictable plots. Then to top it all off, the backwards plate carriers Michael's team is wearing in episode 18, the drag handles go in back, not the front. I'm hoping that season 5 was simply an anomaly as the show started out on fire (in a good way), but with the in-your-face product placements and obvious liberal propaganda, I'm not so confident that is the case, and maybe explains why it only lasted 2 more seasons.",1467072000,,1622,4.859205776173285

4500396,3,B004YM6IZ6,"It pains me to give Season 5 of Burn Notice only 3 stars but that's how it looks to me.  The first three seasons were impressive, original, and entertaining.  The show runners took a risk bringing in another character with Jesse Porter in Season 4 and upsetting the dynamic of the team but it worked out OK.  This season finds Michael with a foot back in the door of the CIA and with a new female agent handler who is pretty annoying.  Jesse is no longer working for the feds and has a gig with a private security company that apparently has pretty liberal policies with how employees spend their time.  We are also treated to more of Michael's mother Madeline and her getting improbably involved in more of the capers which was already overdone after season 4.  My problem with the show is that it's too much with the uber villain who has the goods on Michael and can manipulate him to do their bidding. Burn Notice is at it's best when it's Michael and the team helping a ""client"" out of a jam. All of the contrived drama with these super villains becomes fatiguing and become a distraction from what made the show great.  This go round yet another guy who was part of the cabal that burned Michael comes out of the woodwork and sets up Fiona for blackmail in order to control our hero.  Hopefully things improve in the 6th outing but given we end with Fiona surrendering to the Feds and likely going to prison I'm not optimistic.",1458691200,4,1432,4.418250950570342

4500422,5,B004YM6IZ6,"Some shows stretch their premise and credibility beyond the point of believability, thereby ruining the fun and driving off the audience.  For season 5, Burn Notice tweaked the basic story slightly and managed to be even better as a result.

That also means the review will spoil the end of season 4.  Theres no way around that.

Season 5 picks up a few months after Michael Westen (Jeffrey Donovan) has gotten back into the good graces of the CIA.  While hes not fully back on active duty, hes been involved in missions to help take down the organization that burned him.  It looks like theyve got them all, but something doesnt feel right to Michael.  His friends Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell), Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar), and Jesse (Coby Bell) tell him to let it go.  Even his mom Madeline (Sharon Gless) thinks its a chapter he can put behind him.

And then his contact at the CIA is murdered and Michael is being framed for it.  Obviously, someone isn't quite done with him.

Meanwhile, Michael still reluctantly takes on cases to help people who are being threatened by dangerous criminals.  Over the course of the season, Michael and his friends take on human traffickers, a loan shark, corporate spies turned hostage takers, and a diplomat dealing in illegal blood diamonds.

Okay, so for the most part this season feels like business as usual.  Michael and his friends go up against dangerous criminals and use their spy skills to take them down against overwhelming odds.  The little tweak is that now Michael is at least working unofficially with the CIA, something hes been working for since season 1.  Frankly, the story of his burn was becoming so convoluted; it needed a reset and somewhere new to go, so Im glad they took this step.  For the first time in a couple seasons, I was able to follow that ongoing part of the story from week to week and get sucked into the show all over again.

Of course, the case of the week aspects of the episodes are as strong as ever.  If you just watch to see Michael and the gang take down the nasties they go up against week in and week out, you won't be disappointed at all.  There are still plenty of explosions, gun fights, car chases, and impossible odds  everything that keeps my heart pumping for the run of an episode.  Basically, you get an action show each week.

By this point in a series, the actors and writers know the characters, and thats certainly the case here.  While the show is definitely more focused on plot than character, we still get some amazing character moments that remind us why we care about the core characters.  And the actors do a great job of bringing those moments and all the others to life.

Season 5 actually consisted of 18 episodes, two more than usual, and all of them are present in this four disc set.  Of course, you get them with wide screen picture and full surround sound.  In the way of extras, there's an extended episode, gag reel, deleted scenes, and a featurette about the villains of the show including interviews with the actors who played them.

So if you are a fan of Burn Notice, youll need season 5 to get the next chapter in Michaels life.  And youll enjoy every thrilling second of the journey.",1431993600,,3200,4.553415061295972

4500468,5,B004YM6IZ6,"This season starts happy, Michael is back with the CIA, living with Fi but worried Vaughns organization while hurt is not destroyed.
Unfortunately, Michael is right!
Anson, played by Jere Burns, is the most freighting villain we have seen in the series.
Framed for the murder of a fellow agent, Michael must direct the investigation away from him while trying to find the killer.
Additionally, Fi is framed by Anson forcing Michael to do assignments for him.
As always, multiple story lines interact to create a series of problems and adventures.
Sam, Jesse and Fi continue to be Sam, Jesse and Fi doing what we enjoy seeing them do.
His mother Maddy takes on more responsibilities as she become more involved in the action.

The well-written single episodes make real contributions to the season story and the series story.
This is a season of conflicts with the cast getting to display their acting skills.
As Ansons net closes on Michael and Fi are pushed in a direction they don't like.
The season finial is excellent both as an action story and for what it reveals about the human side of the characters.",1409961600,,1109,4.776041666666667

I love the characters and they're all there with some new ones, but the story has stopped.

4500485,5,B004YM6IZ6,I've been a fan of burn notice since day one. I finally decided to collect the series on DVD. I love all the action. The actors work well together. It always keeps you wanting more. I don't know maybe it's just me but Jeffery Donovan gets sexier each season and Coby is just as hot.,1402963200,,282,4.1454545454545455

4500488,3,B004YM6IZ6,"I like the series  and have since the start.  However, in this season a couple of themes started to develop which is did not like.  In an attempt to stick with the formula of essentially wrapping up each episode, the scripts started to get too fantastical and farfetched.  The other thing that was troubling this season was that we start to see a dark side to Michael, nothing wrong with that.  However, there didn't seem to be much moral weight to it.  He does some pretty awful things and the show glossed over some of this.  I think it would have been better of these things created more dialog amongst his friends, I think Sam and Jesse would have called Michael out and pushed back more on some things.

As to my comment about the episode formula, I am happy to say they really changed things up for the next season.  There is even some mention about Michael having sort of gone off the rails.  I certainly think that Season 5 is worth buying.  Yet, if you start to think the series is wearing thin, take heart the following season redeems it all!

My rating of 3 stars is relative to the Burn Notice series as a whole, NOT as a comparison to TV in general,",1400976000,,1162,4.328703703703703

4500545,5,B004YM6IZ6,"First off, I've completely fell in love with Jeffrey Donovan in Burn Notice-- he's fashionable and awesome.  His character of Michael Westen is downright awesome and amazing!  Hats still off to Sam as he spends most seasons in the background but he is a funny and loveable character.

This season shows a darker side to Michael, more geared towards his CIA days and reconnecting with ""old friends"".  But with the show's major arc (Who burned Michael and why?) inevitably coming to a close, things do get darkest before the dawn.  Fiona's character also grew immensly in this season, she is always kick butt and edgy, she shows female strongness and empowerment- she holds her own and I think it's amazing they finally made a character on TV that isn't ditzy- someone who's intelligent and knows how to get the job done, and handle the big artillery.  Jesse grew a lot on me this season- before I didn't care much for him as a ""burned agent"" or his character, but he really stepped it up this season and I grew as a fan of his.  Sam Axe is always a favorite, I wish he was able to step more into the light and have a bigger role like in season 1 and 2.  This season was thilling, and action packed, this show never lets me down!",1370995200,,1227,4.4222222222222225

Someone makes him the asset and it is killing Micheal and those around him - until the season final episode and we will have to wait until the next season comes out-

Excellent season - we see more of Jessie and Fi is ohhhh so important to Micheal it will have to be big to get those 2 apart.

Movie (aka the dvd set) wise - there are some more feature than there were on the earlier dvd sets.

Movie is a great set for Burner Fans!

The intriguing relationships and emotional scenes provide a diverse and moving experience for the viewer against a back drop of fast paced action and ever surprising outcomes. For this viewer, Burn Notice is simply the best program on TV.",1361836800,,313,5.1568627450980395

It takes place primarily in Miami and has all the elements of great story-telling.  In addition to various ""missions"", the characters are really well developed and mature over the course of each season.  I won't explain ""burned"" -- it might make one more person watch to find out!  This is a series for both men and women.",1361491200,,448,4.632911392405063

It' still entertaining, (although the acting is really falling off--probably because the writing has become just plain awful) but we are officially done with the show after this season (and reading reviews that say season 6 continues on the slide downhill). It's such a shame... the writing in the beginning was so fun and cohesive, but at this point the characters are doing things that are not consistent with their character, some of the fun plot lines are gone, and the character of Michael is not fun to watch anymore at all... I didn't think it would be possible to not like his character anymore, but he's turned into a total jerk and we were actually rooting for the rest of the gang to move on and leave him behind. The writing seems like it's been handed off to a group of high schoolers to finish--like they don't understand the character and don't have the insight to understand what made the show enjoyable to watch. Too bad, because it was SUCH a fun show during the first 2, maybe 3 seasons.",1359331200,8,1254,4.363247863247863

4500651,2,B004YM6IZ6,"This season the show has finally turned into the over the top, under funded spy show my friends and I were always scared it would become.
Burn Notice had been an enjoyable show about relationships and Michael keeping himself in the light by helping others. Well, they've pretty much ditched the helping others part of the show, and Mike is devolving into a ""do anything that it takes to get what I want for the good of me"" character/spy. Bruce Campbell has been pushed back and as such, much of the humor has vanished from the show, and when they do use him, it's to cover up plot points they can't/won't explain. ""We need this really hard to get thing....oh hey, Sam, you still hanging around in the background? ? You have a friend who can take care of this, right?""

The final straw was bringing in Anson. It's not like Mike hasn't been outmatched before, but it was pretty much him vs the U.S. govt. At this point Anson knows all, sees all, can manipulate time and space to be wherever he needs to be when he needs to, to heck with things like needing to drive. Why he needs Mike and the team to do anything never makes any sense, as Anson is SO powerful, that he's a dozen steps ahead of them all the time. This season they really turned the show into over-acted, implausible farce, and it's a shame, because it used to be a fun show. The first 2 seasons were so much better.",1358812800,,1379,4.324324324324325

We thought that was the end - when Michael was invited back to the CIA - and were thrilled to find out there was a 5th season.  The main attraction of this show, in my opinion, is the relationship among the main characters - they remind me of the mod squad.  We can put up with Sam's ridiculous beard and Mom's occasional bad hair days, but Michael Weston has to look good, and his hair was just too bad to put up with.  A pity.

However, I cannot recommend buying this DVD set due to packaging issues and poor video quality.  Considering I own seasons three and four on DVD, I was expecting the same level of quality with this DVD set.  Instead the disks are no longer fastened on a hinged clamshell making it cumbersome to read the episode listing inside the packaging.  This also makes it inconvenient to remove the disks since they overlap each other.  (To take out one disk, you may need to remove another disk.)  Furthermore, unlike seasons three and four, the video quality of this set does not look like your typical DVD quality.  It looks way too compressed.  Either a lower bit rate or a poor quality compression codec was used when these disks were created.

4500780,3,B004YM6IZ6,"What changed this season? A new producer? Something? I watched seasons 1-4 in preperation for season 5, and was immediately struck by jerky, badly cut filming during scenes, stiff character postures, terrible dialogue and a wooden serious atmosphere. I felt like characters had turned into charicatures of themselves, trying too hard, acting over the top, ect. Example: Fiona had turned into a girly girl more concerned with her hair, clothes and vacation spot than anything worth while. She's always been a fashion minded, at times femanine woman, and I find no fault with that, because she always had an edge and a strong attitude, a strong person.

Scenes were rushes, clipped and jumped from face shot to face shot on who ever was talking. I didn't see any of the nuances that I had come to enjoy with Burn notice, the facial expressions and subtle tones of voice that conveyed more than words alone could. I went online to see if I could figure out what, if anything has changed, but in the end it doesn't really matter I suppose. Overall, I am very disappointed in Season 5 so far.

Okay, so the season has gotten a little better as it has gone on, or maybe I've gotten used to the ""different"" prsentation. I'm feeling a little more invested in the plot and I'm feeling more interested in the characters. The narration has also improved (those times when there is a few seconds of freeze frame and Michael gives us a bit of explination or insight into spying and such which were one of the best points I felt). I've upded my review by one star.",1345852800,8,1550,4.61231884057971

4500783,4,B004YM6IZ6,"I'll say up front that I've been a fan of this series since season one. The concept of a spy who is tossed aside mid-assignment by some unseen person who then tries to redeem himself and find out who burned him was an original concept. The lengths that the series has gone to stay fresh and change up the bad guys from season to season has made it remain constantly interesting and suspenseful as well as providing a mystery that is solved one small piece at a time.

Along for the ride are the same cast of characters that have been there from day one. Gabrielle Anwar as Fiona Glenanne or Fi, Michael's love interest from the past is a woman with a past and a love of heavy armor. Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell) is the old friend and ex-Navy SEAL who has been around Michael longer than anyone. With the exception of Michael's mother Madeline (Sharon Gless) who continues to discover more about her son than she would like. And coming along for the ride from season four is Jesse Porter (Coby Bell), the ex-CIA agent Michael burned but who he helped regain his standing. This cast of characters and actors is a dream team always delivering the goods and never failing. It is this core group that helps make the show so wonderful to watch.

But a perfect cast without a decent plot won't get you anywhere. The writing on this show is amazing. The quips tossed out by Michael and Sam are funny but my favorite part is the descriptions used to tag various characters such as ""Julio, not a nice guy"". Okay that's a bad example but once you get into the series you'll know what I'm talking about.

Season five kicks off with Michael somewhat back in the good graces of the CIA. Not completely taken off the burn list, Michael is assigned a handler to keep him involved and out of trouble named Max. Unfortunately for Max, someone kills him and set up the evidence to point straight at Michael as the assassin.

Agent Pearce is assigned to find out who it was that killed Max. Unable to turn to her for help, Michael and his group are trying to discover the same thing. At the same time a man who helped Michael get out of jail takes up much of Michael's time as well. Certain that this man is behind it all or at least a part of the organization that did him wrong, Michael plays out his options hoping to get enough evidence to take them down.

The season ends with the actual man behind it all, the one pulling all the strings, meeting with Michael and forcing his hand. He wants Michael to take out the CIA team he's working with and to come work for him. But Fi has plans of her own when it comes to helping Michael.

The twists and turns of this main plotline are interwoven with Michael and his group helping other people in need as well. It's not always just about the CIA or the covert organization beneath it all, its often about helping some poor shmuck out of a jam as well. Sometimes these are friends or acquaintances and other times its someone Michael isn't quite fond of. But a case never seems to get turned down and the group always comes through in the end.

This series looks great, is acted great, written great and best of all entertains from start to finish. Season five takes Michael into a whole new world of good guys and bad guys and as has happened before who he thinks is at the core of it all turns out to be just another pawn manipulated by some higher power. As season six has begun on TV we find out more layers beneath these layers as well. I know the series will end one day. Let's just hope that the conclusion is as suspense filled as the series has been for 5 seasons. Once again, this is one to own.",1344470400,,3629,4.312316715542522

4500843,4,B004YM6IZ6,"James Donnelly's review is pretty much right on in my view.  (I, too, felt Jesse introduced a bit of a weak note.  But he's great in a supporting role if used sparingly.) The trio is great and you don't want to screw up a good thing. I got the feeling they thought Season 4 was it and this is a bit of surprise, but I don't follow the biz closely enough to really know.  At any rate, very glad to see this excellent series continue (now that Season 6 is a done deal).

It's a challenge to keep a series going for more than a few seasons -- coming up with new ideas and interesting plots...where to take it all?  So they have to go somewhere new and a bit darker makes sense to me.  But I hope they don't lose the campy humor that's at the heart of this and keeps it fun.

However it goes, you have to say these guys put together one of the best new action series in a long time.  Kudos to whoever green lighted this one.  The experience of all involved really makes it work.  These guys know what they are doing and they never forget their mission - to entertain!

4500846,4,B004YM6IZ6,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS

Michael Westen (Jeffrey Donovan) has a plan. He's got a NOC'list. He's teamed up with CIA'agent Max (Grant Show) to capture, imprison or kill anyone that burned him.
When the show began in 2007 we met Michael who had received his Burn Notice, because he was considered unreliable. In other words he was terminated, without access to cash, contacts or influence.
He finds himself in his hometown Miami, Fla. He turns to his old girlfriend Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar), a retired Navy SEAL Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell) and Madeline Westen (Sharon Gless) his mother, to try to find who burned him and why. In the meantime, he essentially does private detective / bounty hunter work to fill the cupboards.
By season five Michael has got to all responsible for burning him except for one high-ranking operative. When that operative is trapped he chooses to commit suicide instead of being captured. Michael can't believe it, fearing he'll never know the whole story about being burned.
A few episodes later Michael loses his only confidant in the CIA Max. Not only that but Michael is being framed for the murder.
I like that the series uses first-person narrative (including frequent voice-overs providing exposition) from the viewpoint of covert-operations agent Michael. Some people don't. I really like Jeffrey because he appreciates his job with Burn Notice.
""I grew up really poor. We grew up on welfare - a single mom with three boys. We didn't have anything. Christmas would come around, she'd rewrap gifts she'd given us before. We moved about 10 times in my childhood. When you come home from school and the lights don't go on, you think: We're moving! You can't pay electric bills on welfare. We became very frugal,"" he said.",1343779200,2,1779,4.93

In the show's fifth season, audiences get to see Michael in a new light as he is finally back in at the CIA, allowing him to do more sanctified missions, travel to different locations, and have an overall different sophistication to the job, all the while twisting in his own MacGyver ability. This season, even more action and more bad guys come into Michael's life, all the while the connection between Michael and Fiona is explored.

4500895,3,B004YM6IZ6,"I enjoy action stories if they are clever with a semblance of logic.  Stories based upon problems created to generate special effects or which postulate a situation that proceeds in a direction not endemic to the character or based upon a faulty premise I believe are the result of lazy writers.  Many of the sub-plots are interesting enough to rate the three stars, but the conclusion spoils the whole show for me.  This season of Burn Notice had the potential to end the ongoing soap opera plotting of the mysterious and omnipotent overlords preventing Michael from realizing his true calling and bring a fresh set of circumstances to the story, but the writers decided instead to focus on a single entity as the personal antagonist instead of a nebulous group with ties to everything.  Frankly, this ending was needless and poorly plotted and with such a weak premise I expect the next season to be as lame.  Given the known and assumed history of Michael, a single opponent in easy grasp could have been handled any number of ways such as drugging, legal entrapment, setting another opponent against Anson, or just getting a video confession with various tools, but instead we are left with a weak and unbelievable ""hero"".

Fiona as a character becomes more developed, while Sam Axe and Jessie become two-dimensional.  Again, the stories are tending towards comic book while Michael loses his integrity and the trust of the viewers.  If the writers cannot summon any more creativity, they should end the series and start something new.",1341792000,4,1539,4.915057915057915

If you want to see Michael, the savvy, talented spy we have all come to love, somehow, get played like a puppet for most of the season, then this is the DVD for you. He is pawned over and over by Anson, a man who comes out of nowhere, has no organization and few allies and yet somehow he manipulates anyone and everyone who crosses his path. That's not all, apparently he knows everything about everybody AND knows all of Michael's covert jobs and somehow makes Michael do all his dirty work.

Michael, whimpering through most of the season, caves and turns to a little puppet around this guy. But that's not all... somehow, Fiona, our tough little lass that would rather die fighting, SUDDENLY decides to cave in and TURNS herself into the authorities. The Fiona I knew would put a bullet into Anson before doing some crap like that and get this... THAT is how the season ends! Fiona goes to jail as we see Michael standing on the corner sobbing like a little girl, meanwhile this Anson guy is fine and dandy.
This season is so unbelievable compared to previous seasons, and so weak! If you're a true Burn Notice fan, it will turn your stomach! It truly is total garbage. True fans, do yourself a favor and avoid this season at all costs. It ruins a fine show.",1340409600,6,1472,4.333333333333333

USA Network sure got it right! Love the show, love the charachters. I've told everyone I know to tune into this show.

In this season, Michael Westen gets reinstated with the CIA, albeit as an unofficial asset, in order to bring down the network that burned him. Things are finally coming together: he's back in with the CIA, slowing regaining his status; he's back together with Fiona; he's getting closer with his family...things are good! But unfortunately, Michael's agency contact Max is murdered and it looks like the killer made it look like Michael Westen killed him instead. So Michael must conduct his own investigation, so that he can prove to the CIA that he wasn't involved!

But the second half of the season is a doozy! Once Max's murder is solved and Michael is cleared of any wrong doing, Larry (Dead Larry) comes back, having escaped from prison in Albania, with a job for Michael: break into the British Consulate to steal data. And he's brought someone along to help: a seemingly unwilling accomplice named Anson Fullerton, a defense dept. psychiatrist, who has the security clearance to get them into the building. But things take a turn for the worse when Fiona, intent on getting Michael to safety and stopping Larry, detonates a small charge, just enough to stop Larry, but an even bigger bomb goes off, killing Larry and two security guards also. It turns out that Anson is behind it all and is part of the organization that burned Michael and now wants Michael to work for him in order to bring to organization back online. If Michael doesn't do what he wants, Anson will turn over the evidence he has to frame Fiona and she will go to prison for life! What does Michael do? Save his girlfriend? Or refuse to negotiate w/ a terrorist? Either way, the consequences are bad and Michael faces a moral dilema!

4500993,5,B004YM6IZ6,"For the first two seasons, I thought this was far and away the best show on tv.  I love spy thrillers anyway, and this blend of espionage and humor seemed perfect.  I thought the writing fell off a bit in the third season, and I really didn't like the introduction of the Jesse Porter character into the series in the fourth season.  I thoroughly enjoyed the relationship between Michael, Fiona and Sam, and didn't want to see another character thrown into the mix to disrupt things.  I even felt mother Madeline's character had outlived her usefullness (and still do) but I've grown to like the Jesse character and enjoy his interaction with the other three.  I really enjoyed season five, even though it had the potential to be a disaster.  The whole premise of the show is Michael Westen being burned from his agency and out in the cold and how he deals with that.  With season five, he's back with the CIA (in a manner of speaking) and I was concerned this would destroy the whole reason behind the show.  Not so.  The team behind Burn Notice did a wonderful job reintegrating Michael into the intelligence community and yet still keeping him as sort of a rogue character.  I do wish Grant Show's character could have stuck around a little longer.  I thought he made a good partner for Michael.  But I understand that his demise propelled the season storyline, so I understand.  I think Anson Fullerton is a great bad guy, and have enjoyed his scenes with the group.  I like the idea of one last bad guy from the group that burned Michael, and one who was there from the beginning.  Overall, I really enjoyed season five, and thought it was their best since the second season.",1336089600,,1680,4.553333333333334
4500994,5,B004YM6IZ6,"This latest season of BURN NOTICE, one of the best TV shows on the air right now, was decidedly different in tone if not in execution as Michael Westen, Fiona Glennanne, Sam Axe and Jesse Porter face a much more insidious threat than they have before on this show, and this show has seen plenty of threats.

We begin with Michael being embraced once again by the CIA, under the purview of his old handler Raines (the always great, but sadly under-used Dylan Baker) and while he's in a probationary period, he's putting all of his old skills to work with his new partner Max (Grant Snow) and has a new case officer, the sharp and attractive Agent Pearce (Lauren Stamile). He's living in something resembling bliss also, with Fiona moved into his loft, desperately trying to make the place more hospitable. Sam is back down to his ""fighting weight"", as we saw in the tie-in TV movie THE FALL OF SAM AXE, and Jesse has a flashy job with an independent, high-profile security contractor. Madeline is also dating!

The first few episodes of the season deal mostly with Michael sliding comfortably back into working as a spy again, bantering with his pals, becoming somewhat domesticated by Fi, and outwitting the bad guys. Things turn for the worse with a shocking death that Michael is intended to be framed for, and our heroes scramble to track down the real killer, while keeping the intrepid Agent Pearce off their backs. This leads once again to another showdown with Dead Larry (the sleazy and great Tim Matheson in his recurring guest role) who is forcing Michael again to do something dangerous and traitorious (like stealing secrets from a foreign embassy), as they race to save the life of an innocent woman who is engaged to a psychiatrist named Anson (the GREAT Jere Burns) who has been kidnapped by Larry. As we find out shortly, Anson's fiance is already dead and when Fi tries to save Michael using small amounts of explosives (and as an ancillary bonus, get Larry out of their lives forever), the detonation seems to cause greater damage than anticipated and kills the small unit of innocent security guards in the building. Fi is utterly shocked and haunted by this; especially since she's never wrong about the explosives she uses. As guilt begins to bear down on Fi and the rest of the team, it is revealed that Anson is actually the man behind all of this. Anson is the LAST one of the group that burned Michael; he was the one who had Michael framed for a fellow agent's death, and he set charges in the embassy killing those guards to frame Fi, and unless Michael uses his regained CIA security to help Anson achieve his goals, he will release the evidence that will link Fi to the deadly explosion. The questions then become: How far will Anson make Michael go, and how can Michael defeat him when he proves time and again that he holds all the cards? Also, can Fiona live with Michael doing these things to protect her?

As you can probably tell from that summation, this is a considerably darker tone than any previous season has taken. While Michael may deal with psychopaths and international assassins and shadowy cabals on a weekly basis, never has a threat emerged in a more frightening and more immediate fashion as Anson. Being a psychiatrist, Anson is able to probe deeply into Michael's mind, shaking his faith in himself, and is also able to predict Michael's moves before he does them. That element of prediction is brought into shocking relief when it comes out that Madeline's boyfriend has been spying on Michael at Anson's behest. Even more shocking than that are certain truths about Michael's father.

While the primary cast members continue to work extremely well together, the biggest coup of the season is Jere Burns as Anson. He plays this part to perfection, and what's fun about him is his willingness to be in physical danger when he confronts Michael. Burns is not in any way a physically intimidating actor and he uses that as a strength during his scenes with Michael and the gang. Anson isn't afraid of Michael because Michael knows that the danger that Anson can put the people he cares about in.

As far as our primary players, Jesse is more or less persona non grata in this season, which is actually something I consider to be something of an asset. It's nothing against the character or against Coby Bell as an actor; I just don't find Jesse to be a truly necessary part of the team that showrunner Matt Nix has crafted over these five seasons to be three of the most unique and consistently entertaining characters on television. Jesse seemed to be shoe-horned in when he was introduced as kind of a sequel to Michael Westen, and his absences during this season certainly were not glaring. In the episodes he's in during this season, he plays usually a small but integral role, and that's how it should stay. Jeffrey Donovan gets to play things not quite so close to the vest this season and he really pulls off a difficult job of having to be less of the gang's stoic anchor and man of action, and it gives way to frustration, paranoia and fear. Gabrielle Anwar is still incredibly appealing and flirty and sexy (although I do think she should have a burger every now and then) and she's also dangerous as ever, but her more constant interaction with Michael does start to show and gives her character more dimensions to play at. BRUCE CAMPBELL IS SAM AXE. That's all you need to know about him. He's possibly the one person you would want backing you up for all of eternity. And most importantly, I think it's a sin that Sharon Gless hasn't been nominated for awards for every single season. Her performance and her character are the emotional core of this show, and if that goes, the whole show becomes something less, and the great thing that Nix is doing is giving Madeline more to do, which means Gless has more screen-time and we have more time to bask in the greatness of her character and her performance.

For all of the seasons of this show, I always felt that if the show got too dark, it would start to lose much of what makes the show such a breezy and effortlessly entertaining hour. This season of the show shows it at its darkest yet, and it does go to places that you wouldn't have expected it to go, but with the show's major arc (Who burned Michael and why?) inevitably coming to a close, things do get darkest before the dawn. I still think this show has a few seasons left in it, and I'm sure that Matt Nix will keep things moving and maybe allow our heroes to have things be a little easier. This season, however; they have it harder than ever before, and considering the events of the season finale, it might get harder and darker still.",1335830400,47,6715,4.591666666666667

Thankfully the writers make the heavier side of the relationship implied and not forcing us to participate like in other shows on television. My children love the show and watch it with me so the heavier side is well within the bounds and obscured enough to not interfere with the plot.

The main characters have strong moral values, that always look to do what's just and fair by the people they come across. The individual characters work well together and though their interactions are adult, it's not raunchy.

4501085,3,B004YM6IZ6,"I am a huge fan of this show, but I don't completly agree with the other reviewers about how great the last season was.  It was still very good, just not like it has been in the past.  The only real standout in this season was Gabrielle Anwar's Fiona.  You were able to see new depth to her character that you hadn't before.  In past seasons she was always willing to do whatever it took to help their clients, but the show never explored her as a person.  This season we were better able to see what she was willing to sacrifice for the greater good of those whe loved, even if it was her freedom.  This was a big turnaround for someone who I always thought was a little selfish and narrow minded.  Like I said she was always willing to do whatever it takes, but usually in her own terms.  She relentlessly pursued her relationship with Michael, but she would always threaten to walk away if he did something she didn't like.  While the changes in Fiona were good, I did not always like the changes in Michael.  Too many times this season, he went too far, and sometimes it looked like the othere could never pull him back.  I think the she runners were trying to show us what he was like pre burn notice now that he was back with the CIA, but I still did not like the changes.  These things I could have forgiven and still given the season 4 stars, but the worst part was the shows under utilization of Bruce Campbell.  I felt that Sam spent most of the season in background.  I think that he is one of the best parts of the show, and I hate that he was only used for occasional comic relief.  All in all, I still love burn notice, and faithfully await the next season.",1325116800,51,1671,4.19435736677116
4501086,5,B004YM6IZ6,"I had been getting a bit tired of Burn Notice.  It was becoming too obviously formulaic and the antagonists were getting sillier and sillier.  Each season the people Michael's team was fighting against became ever more powerful - they could circumscribe world governments and they became less and less believable as time went on. What new super power of evil would the team be fighting against next, I asked myself after Season Four - the Devil?  I stopped buying the DVDs after Season Two - But.  I can't wait for Season Five to become available.  The creation of Anson as the antagonist is inspired.  He really could qualify as the Devil; he is so believable that it is chilling.  He has tied the previous four season together as we get glimpses into Michael's past.  The use of a highly intelligent, skilled psychologist as Michael's foe, bringing the evil back to one man, makes the series believable again.

If you think of Anson as Archangel Lucifer and Michael as Archangel Michael - the two ultimate warrior foes - we could be set for an heroic battle in the next season. I can hardly wait for next summer.",1324598400,53,1114,4.642857142857143
