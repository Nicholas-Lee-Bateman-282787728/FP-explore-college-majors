8445204,5,B004WJV77A,I only was able to view the In Search of Mozart because the In Search of Beethoven DVD was defective.  I would not buy from this seller again.,1439078400,,142,4.071428571428571
8445205,5,B004WJV77A,I really enjoyed them but thought they would be better. No subtitles except when someone is speaking in a different language. I saw Mozart and his music hosted by Peter Ustinov on cable and Beethoven also. I enjoyed them a lot better. You can see Mozart and his music hosted by Ustinov on youtube. I also recommend Mozart on Tour available on dvd right now on Amazon. It is a musical tour of his travels with excellent musicians playing on it. I really can't get enough of Mozart and Beethoven. If you enjoy Haydn there is a really good BBC biography of him on youtube also.,1425859200,3,574,4.4245283018867925
8445206,5,B004WJV77A,Masterful insights to the musical geniuses.  Astounding observations I'd never heard of before.  Knowing more about their lives makes me appreciate their music more.,1407196800,,165,5.833333333333333
8445207,5,B004WJV77A,"This documentary is exactly what you need for a biography of a classical composer: It's not your common 60-minute 'episode'. First of all cause it's longer than 2 hours. But also the descriptive analysis by conductors, musicians, and musicologists is as subjective as it's supposed to be. They provide a viewpoint that only someone that plays, feels, and hears music as it is intended to be played, felt, and heard. It's both melodically and harmonically analyzed. And what greater demise can afflict a man that lives by hearing that the loss of his hearing!!! That's like a violinist prodigy and genius to learn one day that at some point in his life he will completely lose use of his hands!! And yet still defy the gods and fate and still be able to compose and conduct with no hearing left in his being!! Mein Gott!!",1374105600,3,820,4.662068965517242
8445208,5,B004WJV77A,"A lean line through the lives of two of the greatest, with excellent commentaries. The slightly ironic Ax and the solid Norrington stood out for me in their perceptiveness.

Music and life are well connected and I enjoyed the extra disc with full musical presentation, as the documentary just highlights parts of pieces.
The combination is a good purchase as it allows to compare the two musical giants and as both composers are dealt with excellently.

The life of Beethoven is the more convincing, perhaps because it is such a great story to tell, the exuberant young man turning into the struggling one with his encroaching deafness.
 The part on Mozart is also superb in parts but his travels come less to life than they could have. It is still an excellent video.
 The independently purchasable disc on Haydn is also good but, just as the music being less enticing for me, the disc was a little less satisfactory. I wish there would have been one disc on Schubert; that would complete the great Viennese, the only one born there of the three.
In order to supplement by reading I recommend the psychoanalytical Solomon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beethoven/dp/B007IKKKS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beethoven</a>, or the lighter&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tassilo-s-Vienna-Violin-Fresh-Classical-Music-Guide-Times-Places/dp/B00BYHJ5OK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tassilo's Vienna Violin/ Fresh Classical Music Guide/ Times/ Places</a>&nbsp;including  most of the Viennese composers.",1367712000,9,1579,6.291666666666667
8445209,5,B004WJV77A,I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in good music.  The background covered for both has been well researched and presented.  Brilliant!!!!!!,1355702400,2,152,5.565217391304348
