8098957,5,B000CGX7ES,"The 1930s were the golden age of westerns for a reason. Hollywood knew how to make them well and they churned out a ton of them.

Of course, all these films have teh same plot - the hero leads a bunch of dudes in white hats against a villian and his guys in black hats.

It's hard to mess up this formula too badly and the Lightning Carson series, including this film, does a good job of it.

In this one Carson's son gets framed for a robbery he didn't commint and Carson heads out and captures/kills the bad guys.

Then the credits roll.
