1936859,1,B0000E6FOJ,"""Final Stab"" and ""Leeches"" are very good movies by the same director of this movie, but this movie was horrible. It is appropriately named. You would have to be on speed to watch this demonic monstrocity. The acting was not very good. The story was not well written. The climactic fight scene at the end was not very exciting. There was really no one to root for in this film. I received my copy on dvd yesterday. I watched it today. The garbage man will pick it up tomorrow.  I cannot wait to get this garbage out of my house. It is not worth renting; certainly not worth buying. It does not deserve one star, but tht is the minimum I can submit. Don't buy. Don't rent.  So much of this movie was pointless. Even though the director is gay, what was the point of all the guys going around shirtless? This same gay director made a great movie  with ""FINAL STAB"" and a good movie with ""LEECHES"". ""Shreiker"" was a decent movies as well. ""Voodoo Academy"" was pointless yet a decent story. The write up is the reason I bought this movie. Watching it is the reason I am throwing it away.",1118188800,,1082,4.320197044334975
1936860,1,B0000E6FOJ,"If you've watched director David DeCoteau's previous movies (The Brotherhood series, The Frightening, Leeches), then you pretty much know what to expect:

1) buff young studs running around in their underwear for no apparent reason

2) slomo sequences that are so dull and repetitious, and used mainly to add minutes to the movie;

3) plots with holes the size of the Grand Canyon;

4) lots of bad acting;

5) awful music of any genre.

SPEED DEMON is no exception, although this is one of his less entertaining films.  The others at least had some modicum of suspense and/or horror.  This movie has no suspense, no horror, no real gore, no sex scenes (unless you count the numerous times the boys spread some kind of blood all over their buff chests.  DeCoteau is obviously a director who caters to his alternative lifestyle audience, and while I have no real problem with this, he should at least make the movie a lot more interesting than this dull dud.  The identity of the speed demon is so hilarious, it defies belief.",1110585600,3,1024,4.702247191011236
1936861,5,B0000E6FOJ,"HOT GUYS DRIVING CARS WITH THEIR SHIRTS OFF, HOT GUYS RUBBING BLOOD AND MOTOR OIL ON OTHER GUYS CHESTS, SHIRTLESS HOT GUYS RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES WHILE BEING CHASED BY CARS, HOT SHIRTLESS GUYS JOINING HANDS IN SATANIC RITUALS, NEED I SAY MORE. THIS MOVIE HAS TO GET TO THE CASTRO THEATRE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND IT WILL BECOME A CULT CLASSIC!! THE PLOT, OH YEA THE PLOT. WELL JESSE (COLLIN STARK) COMES BACK FROM COLLEGE AND FINDS THE SHIRTLESS HUNKS ALL WORKING ON CARS AND ATTENDING SATANIC RITUALS, WHILE THE TOKEN GIRL WHO SORTA LOOKS LIKE BUFFY HANGS OUT WITH THEM. THE MURDERS BEGIN AND THE ONLY LINK IS THAT ALL THE GUYS ARE SHIRTLESS AND RUN OVER BY A CAR DRIVEN BY THE SPEED DEMON.",1078099200,4,688,4.425196850393701
1936862,1,B0000E6FOJ,"Where to begin?
Simply, this movie was terrible! For one, the very, very bad acting. Jesse (the good guy) felt stiff and fake. In the beginning of the movie, his brother's car blows up while he is in it, and Jesse, while witnessing this, just looks on for several seconds, casually brushes his hair back, then finally starts screaming for his brother. Come on!
Otto, the bad guy, was monotone throughout 99 percent of the movie! Even when he is angry, he keeps the same vocal tone, like when he started yelling at his girlfriend, Natalie. Show some emotion in your voice!
And you wouldn't believe the death scenes! One guy gets run over by a car, but he just drops to the ground by the side of the car while it is driving past! It shows him in pain from being run over, but when the killer goes to retrieve him, there isn't any blood, bodily injury, or even tire marks on his body. AND YOU SEE THE GUY BREATHING!
The plot was also terrible. Otto keeps on talking about racing and how he has his speed demon (a medallion with a demon head on it) to help him go faster to win races, and throughout the movie, he keeps boasting about how he's the fastest, but there is only the one race scene that Mike, Jesse's brother, races in before he dies, and the race looked terrible. The cars were going 30mph! And there are not any races after that. I'm not a big fan of car and racing movies, but after watching this, I'm starting to think that 'The Fast and the Furious' was a good movie!
Do not watch this terrible movie. Bad acting, bad plot, even bad music! I even got a headache from watching this movie!",1075593600,3,1600,4.301324503311259
1936863,2,B0000E6FOJ,"I have seen almost all of David Decocteaus films, and I am a huge fan of The Brotherhood Trilogy, Voodoo Academy, and The Frightening. However, his last 3 releases have been huge disappointments. Lacking all the pieces that made his first films so campy and enjoyable. His films starting with Leeches have gotten worse and worse. His latest is Speed Demon. His so called version of The Fast and the Furious with some horror, and barley clad men thrown in there. The plot is rediclulous. The acting atrocious. The charaters names are hysterical! Clutch, Wiper, all different parts of a car. The plot goes nowwhere, and the film goes along so slowly that you don't even care who the killer is. Let me tell you,there is a twist, but its pretty obvious who it is, if you can pay attention long enough. Fans of David Decocteau may find this film enjoyable, especially for the beefy men in their underwear, but they certainly won't make one of their favorites.",1070150400,3,954,4.684523809523809
8001940,4,B0000E6FOJ,Good movie with a lot of potential to be better; still worth it for fast cars and bountiful shirtless studs!,1486684800,,108,4.45
8001941,5,B0000E6FOJ,"Not scary or graphic, but weird... not Stephen King weird but just weird.  I saw this movie when I was a kid on TV (it was called Strangers in Town) and it deals with witches and the occult.  Pretty cool 80s flick if you're not into gory or extremely scary movies.",1369699200,,264,4.1568627450980395
8001942,3,B0000E6FOJ,"The key to enjoying this movie is to treat it as a comedy. It actually is very successful at evoking the campy silliness of many 70's low-budget ""horror"" films. This is a great movie to watch when you and your friends all want to do commentary like on Mystery Science Theater 3000.",1267747200,,281,4.423076923076923
8001943,3,B0000E6FOJ,"i just love about all david's  movies.  this had a little better story and
some very good/gorgeous eye candy for viewers.",1251072000,,121,4.714285714285714
8001944,5,B0000E6FOJ,"I love david coteau his films are daring and diffrent,and defintely threating to those who can't take male nudity.it seems more acceptable when girls run around naked screaming and lesbians kissing but when guys do it in film its gross and stupid.loli love your films David i will support you all the way keep up the good work. I highly recommend this film to those who like traditional 80's horror but in coteau style,the girls will defintely like these films...check it out his movies are fun and not to be taken to seriously....David if you read this or anyone that knows or works for him gives a vampire film in your style...Thank You",1203638400,4,638,4.654867256637168
8001945,5,B0000E6FOJ,This very homoerotic is suprisingly good. It does have a story that does keep you watching the movie as well as plenty of good looking eye candy. Very recommended.,1159574400,3,163,4.655172413793103
8001946,1,B0000E6FOJ,"What a disappointment. A bunch of guys walking around with no shirts on and rubbing each other with motor oil so a speed demon will make them drive fast. Where are these sissy boys going in such a hurry, to their boyfriends house? Sick crap that I could not sit through.",1153180800,,270,4.313725490196078
8001947,3,B0000E6FOJ,"Like any David Decoteau Movie......there are plenty of good looking guys running around in tight boxer briefs for no apparent reason except for the viewer to see.

There is at least a small story line here, but it is so predictable that you know exactly what is going to happen. There is also some good gore which is what most people are looking for in a horror movie, but this one is not scary.

Turn done the sound...and just watch the eye candy",1126051200,3,447,4.373493975903615
8001948,1,B0000E6FOJ,"Some local racing gang worships a speed demon to try and get more speed.  My suggestion is to quit prancing around with no shirts on and work on your car.  The cars in this movie were bone stock '70 Chevelle, '71 Charger (which didn't race and wouldn't have been much anyways since it was also stock), some eighties Camaro, 5.0 Mustang, and another '70 Chevelle that was black and suppose to be one bad machine, though it was cammed it lacked high compression and was obviously not a high performance machine.

One race in the movie between a '70 Chevelle (the owner just tuned the Fuel Injection on it by the way) and a stock '85 or so Camaro, that was outfitted with Nitrous, and had the original skinny wheels.  Yawn.

The gang in this movie wants the speed demon because they made their car as fast as they could and looking for the next rush.  They don't need a speed demon they need a Summit Racing catalog... and maybe a Barry Grant ""Demon"" carburetor...  The cars in this movie sucked.

Don't rent this movie, avoid at all costs.  bad acting, script, etc, the whole thing.  If you're like me you wanted to watch it for the cars.  Don't, rather, drive down the freeway and look at the other cars driving alongside you, you'll get more excitement that way, seriously.

If you really want to watch a car movie, try ""The Wraith,"" which was also bad but at least the cars in it resembled hot rods, or, better yet, try ""Two Lane Blacktop"" which begins with a '70 Dodge Daytona, Hemi Cuda, and a 55 Chevy street racing in the first 2 minutes of the movie, 100x more the action in all of ""Speed Demon.""

Don't watch ""Speed Demon"" even if you get a kick out of bad acting and bad plots.  This may be a movie for girls who like to watch guys with no shirts spread blood all over their chest.  That's about all I could imagine actually enjoying the movie.",1120348800,,1852,4.358600583090379
8001949,1,B0000E6FOJ,"Speed Demon is a terrible film.  A gay version of The Fast and Furious.  There's only three women in this film and they wear more clothes than the guys.  The dudes worship an engine block and they like to smear ""motor oil"" on each others chest while they play ring around the roses wearing nothing but jockeys and socks.  Dude there is nothing cool about this movie.  To quote the director in the commentary sums up the entire movie,""I don't like guns or violence, this is the last time I'll use one in a movie.""

The movie is only 70 minutes long (with credits and padded out scenes).  One part of the movie that troubled me was when the ""hero"" and his girl were having ""sex"".  The girl's bra remained on the entire time.  Who in the hell does that?

More camera molestation from David DeCoteau.  He makes Victor Salva's films seem straight.

Bad stuff, avoid like the plague.",1119744000,4,877,4.446540880503145
