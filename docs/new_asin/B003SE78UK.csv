BEWARE! ILLEGAL COPIES!!!

The quality is awful, and you don't get any interactive menu screen. You just have to accelerate through all the episods again to get to the further episods, etc...

This set just has never been released - by the way, this page has been created by some seller and not by Amazon -, all the discs are illegal copies, that should be destroyed or handed over to the FBI, or to your creditcard company if you need to press for a refund.

NEVER return this to your seller who says you won't get a refund if you don't return it - you'd be breaking the law yourself, and the seller has no right to retrieve something he must not sell again. By holding it, you also keep a proof that this was an illegal copy.

Tell them one is advised by ebay and Amazon to hold on to the offensive material that steals artists (like Mary Louise Parker! ),  in case either ebay, PayPal, your creditcard company, or the FBY, or all 4 of them, ask you for it as evidence of illegal copying.

Really, you should report this seller.  If you report them to ebay or especially PayPal, their account will be blocked and they will be unable to communicate with any of their new customers anymore nor be able to fulfill any new order that comes through following this, and so bad feedback will start to accumulate and their account will be ruined, make them aware of that.

Demand an immediate, totally hassle-free, refund without having to return this illegal material. Say if they need proof that this was an illegal copy, you'll be sending it to one of the above-mentionned companies for them to confirm to the seller that it was an illegal copy indeed.

You have no reason to let yourself be intimidated because the power is all on your side here; the FBY is absolutely drastic in reacting to reports of illegal copies, film unions are supers-strong - the strongest unions perhaps of all trades in the world!

And remember, if you buy this illegal set with this knowledge, you are being dishonest yourself, and stealing an industry and artists, and undermining a system that supports quality of broadcasting, and fairness. You become an accomplice and, if it can be proven that you knew, you become liable to prosecution too.

Also beware any Region-0 discs : in this series, none has been officially/legally released in region 0.

STOP selling or buying illegal copies! You may get caught; by buying it on ebay especially you can easily be traced, and the item repossessed by the FBI, and you could be incriminated of keeping & not reporting an obviously illegal copy that has no working titles menu.  The FBI has waves of catching  'SMALL FISH' to make BIG public examples of even small fish!!...",1269561600,17,2697,4.58004158004158
4187935,3,B003SE78UK,"I just received this item. Season 1-5, 18 disks in one set. It literally IS 18 disks...in a box. You open the box and out falls 18 disks, each one in a sleeve. No cases, no booklets - just a box with 18 disks in it. If you search around you can find this set very cheaply and if you are a big fan of weeds and simply want the episodes and don't mind putting them in a CD case, this set is for you. Otherwise, purchase Seasons separately

UPDATE 2012:
I have long since gotten rid of this set. It was obviously bootleg as it had commercials and homemade menus - I don't know if they all do or I just got scammed - oh well. buyer beware.",1268611200,20,635,3.9224806201550386

4187940,5,B003SE78UK,I just ordered the eighth season of Weeds and I have been watching the all of the seasons once again. This is an amazing show that is fresh and bold. It seems to reinvent wifh each season. We find a women who had a nice life up until her husband drops dead while out for a morning run and that is where the story starts. Wanting to keep everything they have as a family she starts selling weed for money to take care of her family. Things just don't always works out for Nancy. It isn't so much that she is bad at what she does but her family and friends just seems to do what ever is needed to just screw everything up over and over again. It is really amazing what this family goes through in each season. The biggest thing about this show is you must watch it from the beginning because each show is needed to get the next one. Each episodes builds to the next. It gets better each time I watch this show; I think this is the fifth time watching it all the way through I'm enjoying this more than ever before. The storyline movrs along at a nice pace going to places you would not think of. Great show but this family is not Ozzie and Harriett.,1360800000,,1147,4.102222222222222
