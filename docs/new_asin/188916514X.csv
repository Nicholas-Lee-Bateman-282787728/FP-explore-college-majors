202049,5,188916514X,"Excellent!! Fantastic!! I have tried several yoga classes but always felt unsatisfied with my progress. Then I found this 'STEP by STEP' dvd by Yoga Journal and it's perfect as it allows you to continue to practice at home as well as your classes. It's so good that you could even start as a beginner using this dvd without going to an outside classes. (I do however suggest you find an instructer as it helps you perfect your poses and ask questions on your technique). But I still highly recommend this dvd since you can start working on you stamina, strength and flexability in the comfort of your own home!!",1093132800,15,611,4.5636363636363635
202050,5,188916514X,"I became an instant devotee when I first saw Natasha in action. I'm usually not one for fitness videos, but when a friend insisted on having me watch Step by Step, I was instantly hooked and bought it for myself.

I've attended yoga classes for years, but I didn't realize how much I still had to learn about the basic poses until I saw and heard Natasha's instruction. I've been recommending this video to all my family members and friends - especially the ones who have never before practiced yoga. To me, the Step by Step series seems like the perfect way for a beginner to precisely learn the basic poses, and at home with privacy.

Not only is Natasha supportive and graceful to watch, but you can watch her assistant modify each pose - a huge benefit for someone like me with shoulder pain and tight hamstrings. In fact, everyone who thinks they can't practice yoga because of body pain will be thrilled to learn they can modify the poses and still get huge benefit from it. And, there's tons of other helpful content on the DVD. In one section, a doctor talks about the medical benefits we derive from doing each pose as Natasha is demonstrating the poses. I knew yoga was good for me, but now I know WHY it's good for me!

If you couldn't tell, I'm really excited about these DVDs -- series 2 & 3 are equally excellent! Yoga Journal puts out the series and, if you've seen the magazine (it's been around for umpteen years), you know you can trust them with all your yoga needs. Enjoy!",1092009600,14,1492,4.437956204379562

She also takes the time to explain the name and meaning all poses and small tips about the exercise flash on the screen. once you have mastered all the poses. There is an non stop yoga workout that includes all the poses you have already learned..once you have mastered the beginner DVD you can progress to the more advanced dvd.

Each practice runs 20 minutes and covers all the bases. Vol. 1 is the most beginner friendly, focusing on standing poses and sun salutations.  Vol. 2 focuses on forward bends.  VOl. 3 focuses on balncing poses, i.e. handstand, headstand.  These are excellent if you don't have much time for your practice. Typically during the week I choose a 20-30 min. program and an hour or so on the weekends.  These are a great addition to any collection.",1081641600,47,580,4.989583333333333

202062,5,188916514X,"I find this set to be absolutely excellent. The instructor, Natasha Rizopoulos is top notch for her form and technique as well as her instruction.

According to her bio, Natasha is steeped in the classical yoga styles of Iyengar and Ashtanga. Her fluency in these methods (which are paradoxically quite different, primarily in pace) colors her instruction in a beautiful way by outlining the aspects of proper alignment for the poses slowly (a characteristic of the slower moving Iyengar style), while her execution exhibits the fluidity, ease and effortlessness of her background in the Ashtanga style while never getting too fast or overwhelming for the beginner. Her demonstrations that are found at the Title pages of the three DVDs showcase her excellent proficiency and mastery of the Ashtanga style. It's really inspiring to watch her perform some of the more advanced poses, jumpings, and balances in these demonstration sequences to give the viewer something to aspire to while being exposed to the art, beauty and grace of a master yogi practicing her craft. Natasha moves with the grace of a dancer, as one reviewer compared her movements to ""ballet."" Simply astounding and beautiful!

I honestly don't understand why some reviewers are complaining about this DVD being not for beginners. I find Natasha's instruction incredibly clear and precise. She always encourages the viewer to pay attention to her assistant, Jason who modifies a lot of the poses, while she takes the time to discuss proper alignment and correcting common mistakes on her other assistant, Autumn. In addition to the invaluable ""Instruction"" portion of the DVD is a pose library in the ""Chalk Talk"" section where there are more useful tips given on accuracy and proper alignment in the poses while correcting common mistakes. The other part of this DVD that is extremely helpful is to watch the ""Practice"" portion of the DVD along with the Medical Commentary by a qualified doctor, Timothy McCall who offers additional insight and cautions throughout the Practice segment.

As with any DVD, I'd recommend watching it in its entirety before attempting to follow along in your own practice!

While all 3 DVDs can virtually be used by a beginner by following along using necessary modifications (using blocks and straps wherever necessary. Lowering from the knees rather than fully lowering through Chaturanga. Opting to go into Baby Cobra rather than Upward Facing Dog, etc.), paying attention to the precautions given throughout, and opting to stay in ""preliminary"" or ""preparatory"" stages of poses, I'd recommend only following along with the first DVD for the absolute beginner. The second and third DVDs contain some advanced poses, and to incorporate so many rigorous poses in a single routine requires years of dedicated practice. I'd suggest using the second and third DVDs as a ""reference"" for a long while rather than as a ""practice routine"" you can attempt and follow along. There are a few poses in each, though, that one can incorporate into their beginner routine. Namely, Sukhasana, Virasana,  Dandasana, Janu Sirsasana, Paschimottanasana, as well as inversions (though one should exercise caution when attempting these and opt for HALF Plough, Ardha Halasana, by placing feet on a chair if feet cannot reach floor) such as Sarvangasana (Shoulder Stand) and Halasana (Plough Pose).

I really appreciate the ""traditional"" vibe of the instruction through the use of Sanskrit terms with explanations, the movements flowing in a classical fashion, Natasha linking/joining her hands using classical methods, the setting and music giving a more traditional outlook to a North American practice of this wonderful ancient Indian practice. Natasha inserts traditional yogic wisdom tastefully throughout the DVD without being overbearing or dogmatic. You still get the sense of it being a physical practice while getting a little taste of the traditional, philosophical, and spiritual aspects of this wonderful practice. I also appreciate the melding of a slow ""Iyengar"" pace to develop awareness of alignment and balance while connecting poses in a smooth, flowing practice that serves as the foundation of Vinyasa forms and the rigorous and intensive Ashtanga style.

The best parts of these DVDs are the Instruction, the Chalk Talk, and the Medical Commentary. While the 20 minute practices are sound and are efficient for those with a busy schedule, I find it to be quite short. Perhaps if you adapt the practice of the first DVD to include some of the sitting postures and Inverted postures I mentioned earlier before finishing with Savasana would allow for a more complete yoga practice...

I hope this review helps!

202068,5,188916514X,"I read that some beginners found this DVD to be too difficult and not truly for beginners. I am not a beginner but also not-not a beginner. I have taken one yoga class and  have attempted other at home DVD's that I found slow and boring. This DVD pack is a set of 3. The first DVD obviously sets the tone and teaches you the foundatioal poses of yoga. I did it this morning and I LOVE IT! I am a thin somewhat flexible person with a very small yoga background. Just above a beginner maybe...and this DVD is the best I have seen so far. Natasha not only shows you the pose, she demonstrates by showing another person doing it wrong and then correcting them so they do it right. There is even options for those less flexible. After going through all the poses with variations for almost everyone, she then has an option to just do the poses straight through. I read a few folks complaing that they had to wait for her instruction and they grew restless but there is an option to just do the poses once you feel you've got it down. She is the real deal, follow her instructions ( listen to your body, go at your own pace, don't judge yourself) and you'll be levitating in no time. Serioulsy, she is legit.

202071,2,188916514X,"I agree with the other reviewers on this issue. I suspect the instructor is such a pro she can't relate to what a true beginner needs to hear and learn. She has two other instructors in the room with her, one of whom (Jason) is supposed to represent modifications a true beginner can make. I wish they'd thought to film the pro and Jason side-by-side, but Jason is way in the background, hidden behind the pro's head. (Seriously?!! No one caught that?) After a few sequences, the pro goes over to Jason and quickly shows the modifications .... but I needed those from the beginning! I don't want to see the pro glide through her poses, I want to see Jason do the modified poses several times. Then for aspiration's sake, go ahead, show me the pro. In addition there's no talk about what you should buy to help, such as Jason's blocks (I grabbed some bricks, probably not what they had in mind). A true beginner's video should start with equipment. What mat? What blocks? State the objective of each position and slowly break down each movement step-by-step, giving you time to look and adjust. Introduce common issues (tight hips, tight shoulders) and how you can modify. Point out common problems (like try to keep your hips square by these means etc.). I have an app on my phone that I've learned a lot more from. I can play the poses over and over again in short sequences. FWIW, I have a long athletic background as a competitive cyclist and can easily adjust my position if someone points out what I need to do. But this video is not what I'm looking for.",1354060800,2,1560,4.496478873239437
202072,4,188916514X,"The tapes are good for reviewing your postures if you do not attend classes and learn yoga on your own. Natasha presents clearly and her directions for good postures are clear and easy to follow. I wish the practice sections were at least 30 minutes instead of 20. Some days I just want to practice, and the practice flows are a bit too short for me. And the instructional flows are too slow if I do not want to review my postures.

202075,5,188916514X,"This was my second try at a workable yoga video to (jump)start my practice.  I've seen others since.  I'm now buying this for friends as gifts.  It is very concise, very clear, particularly about safety (maybe too much so), and extremely informative with all the extras.

Here's the deal, if you can't sit cross-legged (half lotus) and can't do a single pushup, then you definitely need to ""watch Jason"" and do the modifications, or even make them more extreme.  My skinny-and-adorably-wobbly daughter couldn't join me until she was 7, but she did what she could and then scooted back & forth under my down dog when she got overwhelmed or bored.  The mods are there, though, and with a little thinking, even if you find the Wii Fit too challenging, you can do most of what's in this set if you properly modify it and work up to what Natasha is doing.

Conversely, if you're fairly fit, you'll get the gist of healthy yoga and the start you need to get a regular practice under way.  It's also great for getting back on the wagon if your practice has slipped.",1334534400,4,1058,4.531578947368421
202076,5,188916514X,"Natasha Rizopoulos is a fabulous instructor, and I love all three of these DVDs.  I used the ""follow Jason"" option when I first started.  He shows the viewer how to safely modify the poses with blocks, straps, and folded blankets.  I followed him for about four months (2-3 times per week), then I moved on to follow Natasha.  Then, I tried the #2 DVD, following Jason at first until I felt comfortable with the poses.

The only criticism I have is for the #3 DVD.  I would highly suggest you find a qualified instructor to show you the proper alignment for some of the more advanced poses on it, such as shoulder stand and plow.  I have heard that neither of those two poses are safe for anyone, even an advanced student, because of the way they bend the neck.  So proceed with caution.

For anyone who says that these DVDs are not for beginners - patience!  I could not even touch my toes for several months, bending straight over.  So that was my big victory!  Yoga is to be done to make you feel good, both mentally and physically; not for instant results.  My opinion is that these are great for beginners.",1329696000,4,1111,4.413793103448276
202077,3,188916514X,"There seems to be a good amount of controversy over whether this is a ""beginner"" DVD, and I think it's a question of how you define beginner. I think this is an appropriate DVD for someone who has taken four or five classes *at least* and preferably worked with a simpler beginning DVD at home. Even then, it will be most appreciated by Type A people who want a good foundation in proper yoga form and are interested in a more athletic, and less meditative, type of practice.

I first tried this DVD after having taken one class. I'm a fairly athletic and ambitious perfectionist, and even I was simply overwhelmed and frustrated. I was shouting at Natasha ""you BITCH,"" and I finally turned it off and did a simpler enjoyable video at my level, the one by Ann Richmond, also on sale at Amazon. I tried this video again today after two more yoga classes (I've taken a total of three) and after having done the Ann Richmond DVD with great pleasure four times. It was hard work, but I was able to follow the instructions and get something from the DVD, and I did enjoy the 20-minute routine. I only cursed at Natasha once, and I will do the DVD again.

The video is clearly aimed at people who already have some foundation in yoga. Natasha focuses obsessively on proper form in each pose, but gives little help to the actual beginner. In the three classes I have taken (all at a resort with a very mixed level of student) the instructor always started by saying something like, ""leave your inner critic at the door,"" and ""don't push yourself"" or ""each person will come to his or her expression of the pose for today, and that's okay."" Another thing I learned from the classes and another video is that you can start in a less extreme version of the pose, and gradually move further into it with each exhale. This has been the single most important thing for me in starting my practice--and Natasha doesn't explain that.

She creates a fairly difficult routine, then she turns to the camera and says basically, if you can't do what I can do with my amazing body, here is what Jason does. And then the video shows Jason looking awkward and dorky. I felt like the dunce of the class, there in the corner with Jason. For my first approach, I would have much preferred a simpler routine I actually could do!

However, if you've been doing yoga for a few months or years and want to do rigorous work on basic poses, this is a great video. I will be using it and working with it intensely for the next few months. I have to breathe deeply and meditate first so that I don't shout obscenities at Natasha.",1265500800,21,2593,4.418410041841004
202078,2,188916514X,"I found the #1 DVD at the library, and watched the instruction last night. Let it be known that I am a TOTAL beginner, with no prior yoga experience except for what I have done on the Wii Fit, which really can't be called yoga.

I find it interesting that so many of the positive reviews for this DVD claim it's great for beginners, but at the same time, they also say they have previous experience in yoga and/or fitness!

Well I am truly a beginner, and while I enjoyed the DVD, I found it to be way above my abilities.

I found it very difficult to ""watch Jason"" as he was rarely in the actual instruction shot. It would have been nice if she showed Jason's demo BEFORE she started the pose. Jason did the demo after I had already tried it myself, and it was frustrating because I wasn't sure if I was doing the poses correctly.

She moved much too quickly, and I found myself needing to rewind to keep up. At that point, I gave up, and figured I would try it again if and when I gain more flexibility and experience.

If you are already in really great shape with great flexibility, then you will find it easy to start this series. If you are like most people who are just beginning your fitness journey, then hold off on this DVD until you gain more experience.",1265241600,22,1266,4.236514522821577
202079,5,188916514X,"I have been practicing yoga on and off for 5 years, but seriously for the past 6 months.  I purchased this video set mainly to see the detailed instruction on the proper postures (asanas).  It is absolutely superb in that regard.  Natasha has a wonderfully soothing voice, and the pace at which she moves is perfect.  You get to stay in the posture long enough to really work at getting the most out of it, making small adjustments, but you don't get worn out.
Throughout Jason is demonstrating optional variations for just starting out, especially if you are not flexible enough to get into the deeper pose, or do not yet have solid balance.

You get a huge amount of very good instruction here for a small amount of money.  cannot recommend this highly enough.",1264636800,4,762,4.607407407407408
202080,3,188916514X,"For those of you who bag on the begginers comments my chosen title was for you. Anyway.....I feel it is worth adding my two cents here; I am a very new beggining yoga student and found this is NOT for me... ""yet"". If I wanted a DVD that would show me all the poses for the routine to follow, without getting to the routine until much later, this would be the DVD for me. However I do not want to just do the poses one at a time for a few weeks then again try to follow the instructor as she quickly (without much description from pose to pose) moves on while I try to catch up. As a begginer I feel I have an idea of what many beggginers may expect; 1) I would prefer a slow enough pace to allow me the time to move from pose to pose. 2) a clear verbal description of what movements are necessary to enter the next pose. This way I don't have to be distracted watching every toe, arm, and leg movement of the instructor, which she takes for granted. In my opinion she doesn't take into account the actual begginers needs - for example she often gives the name of the next pose without the way to achieve the next pose. 3rd) a program that varies depending on my flexability, strength, and conditioning (asking too much here I know). At this point I am going to take a class, even though I bought this ""begginer DVD set"" to avoid the cost of classes and travel time. To give you an idea of my abilities; I am 41 yo 6'1"" 220lbs, surfing for 25 years, mtn bike, and have been told by my tennis instructor I correct body mechanics issues quickly. In closing this DVD set will be great after I don't have to focus on watching the instructor, have the breathing technique as second nature, and poses the flexability that allows me to quickly move from pose to pose. Good luck if you buy this DVD as a begginer - just plan to take some classes too unless you spend many hours trying to overcome the above mentioned issues I have run into.",1257465600,67,1931,4.1796246648793565

202089,4,188916514X,"I borrowed the first video from my library and really liked it so I decided to buy the entire set.  It is easy to follow along, especially when telling you how to position parts of your body for each pose. It's great for becoming more flexible - I am a runner and it is helping other areas that I neglect.  I do agree with another reviewer that you do have to be 'in shape' to do this - you should be involved in some type of exercise.",1194566400,7,435,3.9885057471264367
202090,5,188916514X,"I have no idea what avocat is talking about. I am wondering if we even have the same video or the person never looked at it in full. I don't see how doing a sun salutation is advanced. While to 2nd DVD (intermediate) includes stuff like shoulder stands, headstands, and crow; it walks you through the process including something called chalk talk that shows you common errors and how to fix them. While these poses do take some amount of strength and balance, there are warm-ups and modifications show. I always recommend going to an in-person beginning yoga class before using any video, this is actually one I would ""watch and study"" BEFORE even going to a class. Why? Because I learned more from this video than I ever did in any, of the many classes (at least 30), I took including over 10 different instructor with a least a half dozen different styles such as
Kundalini, Bikram, Iyengar, Anusara, Jivamukti and Yin.

In fact, I think watching this video should be a required by all yoga instructions on how to do poses right and help others correct theirs.
Out of all these classes I took most paid very attention to helping the class do the poses correctly. Unfortuely, In most of the classes I've been to the instructor just shows the poses without even looking up to see if people are doing it right. I am amazed I didn't get hurt in some of them, even when the instruction did pay attention to these more complex and potentially dangerous (for an unskilled, unfit beginner with limited flexibility and balance) poses. I know I wasn't doing them right and I defiantly now see how I could over time develop injures from repetitive doing poses (including the basic variety of sun salutations) wrong. It's now also no mystery to me now how people get injured in yoga so easily even when their not pushing too hard especially if they have some kind or physical limitation.

The 3rd DVD video is advanced in the selection of poses, and nothing I would encourage an beginner to do. You need lots of classes (and/or videos) and a good deal of strength and balance to do these. However, when you are ready, the instruction is excellent. However, I will say that I wish this series had more poses for the inflexible and not so strong beginner. I would thrilled to see them release another DVD (or set) with a bunch more of truly beginner poses. I can understand why they choose these however, because these are poses are often done incorrectly and that have the most chance for error and injury.  All in all it's definitely worth the price for just the chalk talk. You can always buy the DVDs separately, and get just 1 and 2 or even just rent it from Netflix.",1194480000,52,2660,4.549060542797495
202091,5,188916514X,"DVD 1 - Inspired Instruction

Yoga can help you fully relax and prepare for meditation or just feel more relaxed while reading or cooking. Your mind will be cleansed and while the world surges around you in all directions, there will be an inner calm you can carry with you all day.

Natasha Rizopoulos has a beautiful teaching style that allows you to fully experience the body mind connection. She encourages you to experience yoga in order to balance your life. After watching her Yoga demonstration you may start to think of Yoga as an art form and not just an exercise routine. She turns yoga into ballet and her upper body strength is astounding.

This DVD has interesting menu options. There are really two main parts:

A 35 minute Instruction Session - You explore the postures in depth
20 minutes of uninterrupted flowing practice

You can follow the Instruction Menu, Practice Menu, go straight to the Yoga Chalk Talk (a great way to explore the poses) or Medical Commentary. The Practice menu has four sections:

Begin Practice (Different from Begin Instruction)
Follow Jason - This is an excellent option if you want to use props like blocks.

Practice with Medical Commentary - A discussion of the nervous systems of the body and why stress hormones can affect your immune system.

Practice without Music

If you are completely new to Yoga, you might want to start with the ""Begin Instruction"" for the first few days (so your wrists get used to the poses) and then move on to the Begin Practice or practice along with the Chalk Talk to master the poses.

Natasha Rizopoulos teaches you about ujjayi breathing, then teaches you how to move skillfully into downward-facing dog, cobra, upward-facing dog, simple cross-legged pose, chair pose, plank, warrior I, warrior II and extended (right) angle pose.

You will need blocks and a mat for the first practice session. The orange mats, rich wood furniture, lamps, sage walls, sun filtering through lavender shades and a beautiful wood floor make this a beautiful and inspiring space in which to develop your own home practice.

DVD 2 - Hatha Yoga for Flexibility

I'd consider myself to be intermediate and the workout on this DVD seemed to be an intermediate workout with some challenging bending and twisting poses. It is a healing workout that may be enjoyed by intermediate yoga students who are looking for challenging backbends and twists.

I'd ""highly"" recommend buying two beveled foam yoga blocks (if you have yet to buy them) and a yoga strap along with this DVD. Modifying the balancing poses with props is advised.

This DVD has interesting menu options. There are really two main parts:

A 35 minute tutorial - You explore the postures in depth
20 minutes of uninterrupted flowing practice - a vigorous vinyasa flow sequence

Begin Practice (Different from Begin Instruction)

Follow Jason Crandell - This is an excellent option if you want to use props like blocks. Jason demonstrates modifications for those who have less flexibility.

Practice with Medical Commentary
Practice without Music

DVD 3 - Finding a Balanced Life

This DVD is for students of yoga who have mastered the first two instructional sessions. The third DVD is a challenging and healing workout that may be enjoyed by intermediate yoga students who are looking for challenging balance poses that increase your focus and energy.  Upper body strength will be especially important in this DVD.

During the handstand section, I had a good giggle because I could not get upside down on the first few tries and then my feet made a rather loud noise as I finally was up against the wall. I think I may have startled the neighbors. On subsequent attempts, I was able to get upside down more easily when I used a little momentum. While upside down I could really feel the weight of my body and some of the exercises may be slightly wrist intensive if you have not been doing yoga for a few years.

This DVD has interesting menu options. There are really two main parts:

A 35 minute Instruction Session - You explore the postures in depth

Natasha Rizopoulos teaches you about how to use a wall to assist with balancing upside down. She gives safety tips and modifications. I personally think this is intermediate to advanced or can be done by individuals with good upper body strength and balance.

202092,5,188916514X,"I don't normally leave reviews, though I do rate many of the movies I rent on Netflix. I started doing yoga several months ago after seeing the show Namaste Yoga on FitTV. I followed it every day for a few weeks and felt that I really needed more instruction on understanding the poses and making sure I was doing the poses correctly. I've rented movie after movie after movie on the subject of Yoga, and I must say that I have enjoyed it the most.

This is a beginning Hatha yoga instructional movie which teaches the building blocks of the Hatha yoga asanas (poses). There are two other DVDs as part of the series, each with progressively more challenging poses. The instructor (Natasha Rizopoulos) is absolutely perfect. Her voice is calming and relaxing, yet firm. There are two main sections: 1) instruction, and 2) practice. The instruction section features Natasha and two other individuals, Autumn and Jason. Each asana is very clearly demonstrated by Natasha, who then has Autumn repeat the asana. Autumn shows how to position each part of the body correctly, and also illustrates incorrect alignment versus correct alignment - in essence, helping you pay attention to what is correct and what is not correct. Jason modifies each of the asanas with simple props so that individuals who are less flexible and need assistance flowing into each asana can follow his lead. I really can't think of a more clearly illustrated and wonderfully presented instructional series for beginners to Hatha Yoga. Now, when I follow along to the Namaste Yoga show on FitTV, I enjoy it so much more as I am confident that my positioning for the asanas are correct.",1191196800,21,1654,4.84452296819788
202093,2,188916514X,There is nothing beginning about this DVD set.  I was really disappointed.  The instructor is way beyond advanced and does nothing to help the beginning yoga student.  I sent my DVDs back in for a refund.,1190160000,14,204,4.611111111111111
202094,5,188916514X,A must have...and at this price I stole it!  Really good DVDs and loved the price thanks amazon.,1187568000,3,96,4.333333333333333
202095,1,188916514X,"This video is the slowest pace video ever. I understand it's supposed to be somewhat relaxing but, they go over the same stuff over and over and it's completely boring. I can't beleive Yoga Journal recommended this video. It's terrible.",1168300800,4,236,4.925
202096,5,188916514X,"I have been doing this particular practice 2-3 times a week at home for over a year. I have been a yogi for 30 years and this is one of the best CD/DVD yoga practices I have ever encountered. It is safe yet challenging. Natasha's verbal guidance for each pose is enlightening and provides excellent support for consistently good practice. I have developed upper and lower body strength/musculature, and balance that I never thought possible. Natasha's voice is soothing and uplifting to listen to and I have yet to tire of it. I use the CD version, but the video version is excellent also.

This series will be a worthwhile challenge for beginners and  a welcome approach for intermediate and advanced practitioners. As an experienced yogi, I highly recommend this to anyone interested in engaging in a balanced, safe, challenging, and enlightening practice.",1154563200,10,858,4.993006993006993
202097,2,188916514X,"I am not so thrilled by these DVDs (although I haven't made it to the third one yet).  I like the idea of the ""chalk talk"" and Natasha R's corrections to her assistant ""Summer,"" but for some reason Natasha's style ends up seeming condescending to me instead of supportive and encouraging. I also agree with the previous reviewer that something does not look right about her elbow alignment, so much so that I don't even like to watch her.  Although they are packed with good information, these just aren't DVDs I look forward to using.  I like Tracey Rich's ""Original Total Yoga,"" Suzanne Deason's ""Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss,"" and Patricia Walden's ""Yoga for Beginners"" much better.",1134000000,12,690,4.880341880341881
202098,2,188916514X,"I'm amazed that Yoga Journal would produce a video series for beginners using poses such as up dog, down dog, upward facing bow, and sun salutes A&B. Although these poses are well known they are amongst the most difficult poses to do correctly. Most beginners are too weak and/or too tight to do these poses properly, even with the recommended modifications. I'm a yoga studio owner and I've taught beginners for years. It's the rare beginner that can properly do these poses.

It's important that instructors understand the concept of ""beginner mind"". Whoever produced this video simply doesn't get it! Most of the languaging is decent enough but some if it is very high level and would only make sense to someone that's been practicing asana for a while. Additionally, in the opening clip of each DVD, Natasha is shown doing poses completely inaccessible to the vast majority of intermediate students, let alone beginners. I suppose watching Natasha perform perfect asana is meant to inspire. However, ""beginner mind"" rarely goes there. ""Beginner mind"" usually hides do to fear and doubt when witnessing poses they can't possibly do. Oh, and one last thing...Jason, the yogi doing the modifications is no doubt a highly advanced practitioner and in no way is using the props in the same way a beginner would use them. Hmmm....nice going Yoga Journal!

By the way, a yoga therapist might be able to help Natasha stabilize her elbows. She practices asana with amongst the greatest degree of hyperextension I've seen.

Beginners, I highly recommend you consider Sara Ivanhoe's excellent 20-Minute Makeover series. She's knowledgeable, refreshing, and ego-less in her approach. And no....I'm not Sara Ivanhoe, her mother, or her agent!",1127433600,32,1733,5.138297872340425

Thank goodness I also purchased ""Yoga Zone - Premiere Collection (Beginners)"" this set is a MUST for those of us who are starting from yoga baby steps.  I will definately keep this set and use it after a year of building my practice and some strength building!",1121904000,12,609,4.428571428571429
202100,5,188916514X,"I've seen many other yoga videos and this trilogy is the best by far.  Professionally produced and directed, well-choreographed, Yoga Step-by-Step takes the beginner through the basics, first with a lesson, then progresses to a flowing practice that is just right for someone starting yoga.  I found the chalk-talk section of the DVD's particularly helpful in perfecting my form for specific poses; the DVD is even programmed to link the chalk-talk back to the lesson.  Also included in the DVD's are medical explanations of yoga poses and how they benefit the body.  The array of options are impressive.  You can watch the practice with or without music; you can watch just Jason, the poor guy who has to do all the poses as a true beginner, using blocks, straps and modified poses.  The trilogy is also produced to focus on particular aspects of yoga--Strength & Stamina (vol 1), Bending & Twisting (vol 2) and Balancing Poses (vol 3).  After viewing numerous videos and DVD's on yoga, my wife bought the entire set of three.  We're no longer beginners, but we find that Natasha's sense of breath and timing is superior to other gurus.  To make the workouts more challenging, we'll do the practice sessions back to back.  I give Yoga Step-by-Step our highest recommendation.  5 Stars.",1112486400,18,1286,4.907407407407407
202101,5,188916514X,"I take yoga as a P.E. class at my high school, and for the first few introduction weeks of the class we used the sitting and standing routines. This video is fantastic! After just two weeks of the standing poses, I noticed an increase in the firmness of my muscles and my ability to hold myself up longer. I also enjoyed this series because with each pose, Natasha says both the Indian name for the pose along with the English translation, allowing one to know the poses whether in a traditional yoga class or a more modern one. I would recommend this to beginner and intermediate students.",1110067200,15,590,4.5233644859813085

The DVDs have all sorts of added value showing how to modify the exercises if you're a beginner. The medical commentary points out potential issues to be aware of as a beginner. You can get the whole three volume set for just 50% more, or you can start with the first one and see if you like it. (That's what I did) This set of DVDs is great and inspired.

7800976,5,188916514X,"I was gifted this set from a friend who had moved on to a more advanced yoga practice.  At 62 I have always said that I would begin yoga when I was older and not able nor want to do those more intense cardio/wt lifting workouts.  I was wrong, I should have started using yoga years ago to help me with those types of workouts.  Yoga is NOT fluff and woo woo, it is challenging and works your body in a surprisingly wonderful way.  I have tried other yoga dvds but had questions as to how I should correctly position myself so as not to hurt my back in particular.  Natasha is a most excellent teacher and explains exactly how and which muscles to adjust and how to position yourself in the pose.  I am so thrilled with this series and have no doubt that I will continue with a yoga practice long after I've gleaned all information, and there is a lot, offered in this series.  There are so many options offered as to how to view the program allowing you to start at a very beginners practice, and beyond.  The information alone is gold. Don't give up, practice even just one or two moves along with Jason who demonstrates the modifications. Yes she does move on to a more advanced poses, but that is exactly the point.
