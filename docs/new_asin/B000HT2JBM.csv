8459250,5,B000HT2JBM,"I actually got this DVD as a gift and was very pleasant with the quality of the DVD and variety of exercises offered in this excellent box set. It consists of 3 different DVD's: traditional ( approx 50 minutes)

Foam roller(approx 60 minutes ) and mini ball (approx  60 minutes). It made my workout even more efficient and diverse.

The DVD's  include a beginner and an intermediate session. The instructor has awesome form, and she explains things well. Modified versions of the exercises are explained visually and encouraged for those who are just starting. I kept using one title for a week and alternated between the two other ones. I feel stronger already. If you have been intrigued by Pilates but don't know if it's for you, check this one out.",1165276800,6,752,4.717557251908397
