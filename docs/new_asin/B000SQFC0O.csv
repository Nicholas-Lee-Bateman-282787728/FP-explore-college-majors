2888615,5,B000SQFC0O,"The video quality on this season is crystal clear. I found myself taking in all of the props on sets. This feel good sitcom really starts to take off in season two.

 In ""This Year's Model"" Elyse and Mallory are in a mother-daughter modeling contest and end up shooting a frozen food commerical in the Keaton's kitchen. This is one of the my favorite episodes where Meredith Baxter Birney really gets a chance to shine.

In ""Baby Boy Doe"" Skippy who is adopted decides to meet his ""real"" (birth) mother and in the end is happy to be able to go home and have ""real"" dinner with his adoptive mother. I know i will be buying every season of this show as soon as  it becomes available.

Season 2 comes with a few extras ""The Making of Family Ties"", ""Michael J. Fox: The Best Gig In The World"", ""The Year of The Beard"".

I have not watched the extras yet but, look forward to doing so.",1192752000,8,880,4.271084337349397

2888617,5,B000SQFC0O,"Family Ties is one of those rare television shows that combines comedy with heart. The series made a super-star out of Michael J. Fox (Alex Keaton), and allowed him to shine in each episode. Each episode has plenty of laughs, and there is usually a moral to be found; although it isn't heavy-handed in its delivery. Family Ties is a funny, warm, and ""homey"" sitcom- a very rare occurence in today's television world.",1185494400,3,416,4.712328767123288

2888683,5,B000SQFC0O,"This series holds up! I found myself laughing aloud (while many other sitcoms didn't really stand the test of time).

Michael Gross's expressions are priceless, as are the comic timing of Michael J. Fox and Meredith Baxter. Top form from writing to subject.
A great schtick moment, has a friend of Steven's saying ""Don't call me Buster, Keaton."" Steven: ""I'm not calling you Buster Keaton."" Right in the middle of a dead serious conversation. This is the genius of Gary David Goldberg and having the talent to pull it off. Especially in the Christmas episode where it gets really outlandish. I loved this season.",1410220800,,612,4.884615384615385
2888684,5,B000SQFC0O,I like this series because of watching Michael J Fox before he diagnosed with Parkinson's Disorder.,1408579200,,99,5.25
2888685,3,B000SQFC0O,"Love the show, that's why I ordered the DVDs, however, from season three on there are episodes missing, episodes that are from other seasons, and it upsets the viewing pleasure.  Andy will be of preschool age in one episode, the very next show he's only one year old, then the next he'll be in preschool again.  Mallory is dating Nick, then an episode will show up from two seasons prior when she broke up with Rick and Alex is fixing her up, then there will be another old episode, and then it resumes with her being with Nick again in the correct season.  Jennifer is in high school is season 5 but there are two episodes of her 13th birthday party mixed in and it's painfully obvious she's younger in those than the rest.  Ellen was gone in last season, but she's here in season 5!  It's rude for the production company to not give a you-know-what about continuity when we're paying for these shows.  So, the two stars are for the lousy arrangement, the episodes being mixed up and in the wrong seasons, not just within one but within several seasons, and the interference in viewing pleasure, not the show itself or the DVD quality which are both great.",1396569600,,1157,4.485714285714286
2888686,3,B000SQFC0O,"I believe that as of the second season, Family Ties was a GOOD family sitcom, but not a great one. In the second season, the story ideas are good, but the writing quality is uneven. The cast is good, with the standout being Michael J. Fox as Alex. I found the second season of Family Ties to be just mildly funny. For one thing, I often saw a gag coming before it happened and that drained much of the humor away. The picture and sound quality are fine, although I should note that I watched these on a standard definition TV.

There are several second season episodes that I enjoyed a lot. I thought that ""A Keaton Christmas Carol"" was a good and funny adaptation of the Dickens story. ""Lady Sings the Blues was also one of my favorites. ""The Graduate"" gave us a look at Alex's ego problem, and a realistic ending where he had learned how to suppress that. Episodes like these show how good Family Ties can be, but there aren't enough great episodes in the second season to make it a great series.

I was disappointed that politics was fading away by the second season. I had heard that the show focused on political and social issues as ""All in the Family"" did. The first season had a fair amount about politics and political issues, like the episode where Steven's father came to visit, and the political differences between them led to a big conflict. However, in the second season politics is just occasionally mentioned, and only 2 episodes focus on it. ""Ladies Man"" deals with the Equal Rights Amendment, but even there the story is really more about how Alex treats a girl who is an ERA supporter. And ""Lady Sings the Blues"" focuses on Elyse singing folk songs like ""Blowing in the Wind"" with their social and political implications. For some reason, by the second season the producers decided to have Family Ties deal mostly with family issues. The opening credits of Family Ties reflect this change in emphasis, since the opening credits in the first season include several scenes of the parents' counterculture past, but by the second season such scenes are gone. Focusing on family issues is fine too, but I had hoped for a more political show.

The second season DVD set has several nice extras. Especially good is the featurette on ""The Making of Family Ties"" that includes comments by producers and cast. There are also interesting segments on ""Michael J. Fox: The Best Gig in the World"" and ""The Year of the Beard"" (about Michael Gross's decision to grow a beard for the second season).

I'm only reviewing the second season here, but I'll add that the writing quality improved markedly by the third season.",1394150400,2,2623,4.622317596566524

Aside from the first episode and the Christmas one(which was too silly), I enjoyed every episode of season 2. The one with Tom Hanks was pretty powerful as well as the one where Judith Light guest stars. If I were to ask for something, I would have loved to have some commentary tracks.

2888696,4,B000SQFC0O,"This 1983-84 Season of FAMILY TIES is when this show about a midwestern family and their move in the USA from the cultural liberism of the 1960's and 1970's to the conservation of the 1980's which particularly expressed through the relationship between young Republican Alex Keaton(Michael J. Fox), the materialistic young lady Mallory(Justine Bateman), the athletic tomboyish Jennifer(Tina Yothers), the independent architect Elyse(Meredith Baxter), and the local TV station manager Steven(Michael Gross)that all lived in suburban Columbus, Ohio.

This 1983-1984 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch FAMILY TIES at 8:30 PM right after THE FACTS OF LIFE at 8PM every Wednesday night on NBC which was of course before FAMILY TIES was moved to Thursdays on Thursday January 5, 1984.

As a matter of fact; this was the season when NBC had moved FAMILY TIES from Wednesday nights to Thursday nights since it was moved to Thursdays in the Winter of 1984 in the middle of its 2nd Season.

FAMILY TIES was also an instant smash when it made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982 and had even won numerous awards, including 3 consecutive Emmy Awards for Michael J. Fox as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series along with the fact that FAMILY TIES ran on NBC from 1982-89 with 180 episodes throughout its whole 7-year run.

This 1983-1984 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 11 years old in the 5th grade and when NBC's motto was ""BE THERE"", which was NBC's slogan from the Fall of 1983 thru the Spring of 1984.

FAMILY TIES also had a lot of Hollywood stars appear on this show before they were famous and/or during the early years of their acting career like

*Courtney Cox whom is best known for her role as Monica Geller on FRIENDS had co-starred as Alex's girlfriend(Lauren Miller)in the last 2 seasons of FAMILY TIES

*Christina Applegate whom is best known for her role as the ditzy blonde bombshell(Kelley Bundy)on MARRIED WITH CHILDREN had appeared as Jennifer's pal(Kitten)in the episode ""Band On The Run""

*Tom Hanks appeared in the first 2 seasons as Elyse's alcoholic kid brother(Ned)

*River Phoenix had appeared in Season 4 as a 14-year old math-whiz who develops a crush on Jennifer after a math tutoring session with Alex

*Stephen Baldwin whom is the youngest Baldwin brother appeared as a member of a therapy group Alex and his girlfriend attended

*Corey Feldman appeared as a 7th-grade classmate of Jennifer's in the episode ""The Disciple""

*Crispin Glover whom is known for his role as the geeky George McFly in the movie BACK TO THE FUTURE had appeared in the episode ""Birthday Boy""

The improvement in the quality of the second season of ""Family Ties"" over its first is remarkable.  Tighter, more purpose-driven scripts with crisper comedic elements combine with a main cast who is really finding their collective chemistry.  While Michael J. Fox is becoming even more and more the star,the actors and elements around him are fast making the series as a whole iconic.

The season kicks off with an excellent premiere called ""Tender Is The Knight.""  Here, Mr. Fox's Alex P. Keaton is confronted with an attraction to liberal free spirit Carrie Newman, a temporary houseguest of the Keatons.  This is a problem for the more buttoned-up Alex, and the great script is both humorous and poignant.

A telltale creative innovation this season is finding excellent stories for the core actors and solid ones for the suppporting cast.  In one classic episode called ""Baby Boy Doe"" Marc Price's Irwin 'Skippy' Handleman discovers he's adopted and meets his birth mother.  In another one called ""Go Tigers,""  nervous prospective student Alex is at a Princeton interview while an elated Mallory wants to surprise a boyfriend who is a student there.  The whole season is marked by extreme balance and creative skill.

Check out the second season of ""Family Ties.""  This is the one that made the series a classic.",1278892800,3,1333,5.031963470319635

2888701,5,B000SQFC0O,I have been an ardent fan of family ties since the 1984s and I literally grew up watching Family Ties. I simply love this movie as it is awesome and stupendous!!!! Season 1 is good and season 2 is better and of course the rest of the seasons are better and best. It is worth buying these seasons as they show how to cherish family bonds. The family orientation and how they go through thick and thin together as a family is simply mind blowing. I take my hats off to the script writers. The dialogues are witty and good time sense of homour. Watch it!!,1245024000,,552,4.216981132075472
2888702,3,B000SQFC0O,"Been a long time.  This was one of the TV shows my folks used to let us watch when we were little and we did enjoy it then.  So with fond memories  I ordered this set.  However, as is sometimes the case, memories didn't quite live up.  At this point (about 5 episodes into it), the scenarios are pretty silly, there's a lot of bad jokes.. It's got it's moments, and kind of feels like seeing an old friend but unlike some programs that I buy more than one season of (Cheers, Three's Company, Sopranos) I think one season of Family Ties is gonna do it for me.  I don't know, there's still something about the show.. could be that opening song.  I guess I don't regret buying it.  And it's getting better as I reach the 6th episode (Speed Trap).. I'd give this episode alone 4 or 5 stars while the five episode before that 3.  I'll probably watch disc 2.

*** OK, I just finished watching the rest of the season and it was great. I've just ordered Season 3.  I will say although I wasn't that impressed with most of the episodes on disc 1, Family Ties hits its stride in disc 2 and keeps up the great writing and acting for most of the rest of the season.  I was hooked midway through disc 2 and finished the rest of the set within a week.  Great show and great to revisit Alex P Keaton and the family again.  He was so intelligent and had such a charisma, as did the mother and everyone actually.  Great show, lots of extras, and definitely deserves more than my stingy 3 stars. Looking forward to Season 3, although I'm nervous about picking up season 1 if the first few shows of this season are an indicator of what came before.",1229990400,2,1629,4.209677419354839
2888703,4,B000SQFC0O,"The second season of Family Ties flows better than the first one and this is a really heartwarming and funny sitcom.

Michael J. Fox is clearly the star here and his Alex P. Keaton is an irresistable character. He can be smug, arrogant, insensitive and downright mean but he always sees the errors of his ways and in the end is a completely likable character. Michael Gross, the weakest link on the first season, is much better here (and he looks much better with that beard) and the rest of the cast is good.

Mostly these are fluff episodes on the second season that are enjoyable but on occasion they deal with important issues. Tom Hanks is outstanding as Uncle Ned who it turns out has a serious drinking problem. Steven Keaton considers having an affair and I felt that episode handled that situation well enough. The least favorite here is the christmas episode where Alex sees the future ""Scrooge"" style.

The supporting character Skippy is starting to grow on me, I found him quite intolerable in the first season.

All in all, as a family sitcom Family Ties scores high. It's nice, cute and always enjoyable. A nice escape from the harsh realities of the real world.",1220832000,3,1176,4.639423076923077
2888704,5,B000SQFC0O,"Family Ties - The Complete Second Season is just as good as the first season, maybe even better. The writing, storylines, and flawless acting is what kept this show alive for seven seasons. Justine Bateman really finds her nitch this season, I just adored her as dimwitted Mallory Keaton. My favorite episodes include: The Homecoming, This Year's Model, Speed Trap, Say Uncle, Ladie's Man, and Baby Boy Doe. I highly recommend season 2, you won't regret it!",1211673600,,457,4.9480519480519485

2888706,5,B000SQFC0O,"Family Ties really began to hit its stride in the 1983-84 season.  There are many standout episodes, including Alex as Scrooge in ""A Keaton Christmas Carol""; Alex & Mallory's trip to Princeton (""Go Tigers""); another memorable guest apperance by Tom Hanks (""Say Uncle""), to name just a few.

The real treat in this set is the inclusion of several bonus features, after the bare-bones release of season one.  ""The Making of Family Ties"" offers both recent and vintage interviews with the cast.  Unfortunately, neither Meredith Baxter-Birney or Justine Bateman take part in the new material.  Michael Gross and Michael J. Fox talk with pride and passion about the show, and you may not even recognize Tina Yothers now.

There is also another brief segment with Fox, and ""The Year of the Beard,"" in which Gross waxes nostalgic on his choice to grow a beard during the summer 1983 hiatus.  Episode promos are an added bonus, and really took this viewer back to those great NBC Thursday nights.

As Marc ""Skippy"" Price puts it, Family Ties is the perfect 80's time capsule.  Yet, it doesn't really seem that dated.  The humor and heart of the show are timeless.  And we fans are fortunate that Paramount is giving the series the respect it deserves on DVD.",1197849600,7,1250,4.794392523364486

8206264,5,B000SQFC0O,"""Family Ties"" was a brilliant sitcom and rose higher in the second season. Alex is a high school senior with dreams to go to an Ivy League university like Princeton or Dartmouth. Mallory (Justine Bateman) is a sophomore with neighbor, Skippy Handelman (Marc Price). Young Jennifer (Tina Yothers) played baseball with Alex as a coach.

The casting was superb with veteran actress, ""Bridget Loves Bernie"" star, Meredith Baxter Birney as Elyse Donnelly Keaton, the mother, wife and architect. Theatre veteran Michael Gross played Steven Keaton perfectly. There was such chemistry between these two. Michael J. Fox played conservative Republican Alex P. Keaton. Justine Bateman (Jason's sister) was solid and perfect as Mallory. Tina Yothers was unforgettable as Jennifer.

The second season had great guest appearances like Judith Light, Tracy Nelson, John Putch, Crispin Glover, Talia Balsam, Jami Gertz, Daphne Zuniga, Carolyn Seymour, John McCook and others. Skippy was played by Marc Price. Priscilla Morrill reprised her role as Elyse's mother. Tom Hanks played Ned again, Elyse's brother, in an Emmy worthy performance. He played the brother in the first season.

I enjoyed the extra special features like the making of the show. The series brought back plenty of memories from the eighties television comedy. The DVD set has four DVDs with special features including ""Michael J. Fox: The Best Gig in the World."" and the ""Year of the Beard.""

The cast of the series was perfect in casting. Too bad, it felt that Michael J. Fox became a movie star. I felt Michael Gross and Meredith Baxter Birney were sorely ignored by the Emmys and Golden Globe Awards. They were just as important and essential to the success of the series especially the chemistry between Gross and Birney's characters. I have to say how hard it is to see Fox now in 2017 than in 1984.

The second season was the year of the beard with Michael Gross. He was beardless during the first season. During the hiatus, he played in an Off-Broadway play with the beard in the second season. I love seeing the cast members like Fox, Price, Yothers and creator Gary David Goldberg in recalling their memories. Michael J. Fox kept his third billing despite earning Emmys and awards. He became a movie star while doing ""Family Ties."" Michael Gross kept working onstage, film and television. Meredith Baxter Birney became a television star while doing television movies on hiatus from the series. This series was truly blessed with a gifted cast and crew to make unforgettable memories.",1495843200,,2545,5.05
