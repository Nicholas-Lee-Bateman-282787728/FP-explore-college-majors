7507004,5,B017IXVSBG,"You definately need to know your scripture to enjoy this, but it is excellent and worth watching. If you haven't read Genesis through at least once, this movie will make no sense to you. If you know Genesis well, you will really appreciate this movie and the deeper meaning being teased out of the story.",1472256000,6,304,4.545454545454546
7507005,5,B017IXVSBG,"Between the interwoven stories, beautiful videography, and ethereal music, this movie tells the Biblical tale of the book of Genesis. Through lives big or small, through experiences that might seem momentous or mundane, the tale is told of how God is present in our daily lives: mercy, love, beauty. I know I will be watching this more than once; there are so many layers to this movie. Do you need forgiveness, or need to forgive? Are you in what seems to be an impossible situation, through your own fault or not? Are you empty, blind to the beauties of this world or its Creator? Open your heart for a moment and seek Him through this spiritual work of art. He loves you.",1471910400,4,674,4.532786885245901
7507006,3,B017IXVSBG,"I enjoyed this movie but the case said ""2-disc set"" that included both a ""family friendly"" version and a director's cut.  There was only one dvd in the case - the family friendly version.  Just saying - you should make sure your descriptions and cases match what's inside.

Movie was worth watching though.",1470873600,3,306,4.735849056603773
7507007,5,B017IXVSBG,"Talk about a breath of fresh air!
Genesis (the movie) forces you to rub your eyes and look with a new, heart-tugging, visually-stunning perspective at the first book of the Bible.

Its very clear the filmmakers are thoughtful, careful readers of the Biblical texts who set out to unveil the book of Genesis as the beautiful, magnificent story that it is - they succeeded in a big way.",1458777600,5,384,4.647058823529412
7507008,1,B017IXVSBG,I don't know how these people above read the bible or not. The movie really confused that was out of sequence. This is worth and worth. Do not buy it. Unbiblical movie.,1458172800,,168,4.28125
7507009,5,B017IXVSBG,Really interesting and fresh approach to Genesis. The movie is out of sequential order but it all works together in the end.,1457395200,4,124,4.681818181818182
7507010,5,B017IXVSBG,Two Word review: Great Movie,1457222400,2,28,4.8
7507011,5,B017IXVSBG,"Visually beautiful movie with high production values, and what's more, it's Biblically accurate which is more than I can say for most, if not all, movies which claim to be based on the Bible.",1457049600,5,191,4.647058823529412
7507012,3,B017IXVSBG,Nice movie,1512950400,,10,4.5
7507013,3,B017IXVSBG,"Visually pleasing. In some stories the actors wore garments from the era;  in others more like what farmers from the early  20th century. Its best to read the book of Genesis in the bible for yourself, because this movie is not an accurate retelling. And the parts that were left out are important parts.  The book of Genesis is easy to read and it is a rich story. You will be satisfied with the authentic stories as they are recorded in the Bible.",1508630400,3,449,4.385542168674699
7507014,1,B017IXVSBG,If I could I would rate this -5.  It is extremely choppy and in accurate!  There is no plot or climax of any kind.,1505952000,,114,3.7083333333333335
7507015,5,B017IXVSBG,"This film about genesis  moves through the  frames with song and story moving back and forth through time but always with God at it's center  without giving away too much, the stories tell history of the Jewish people the music is stunning, the acting will leave you in tears  because your heart will be moved so much, the scenes have to be filmed on site as to give richness and detail to each frame to be able to pull us in. the way it does. it's over two hours and plays as if it was 45 minutes. I'm going to rewatch this over and over and over again.",1501459200,2,554,4.101851851851852

7507017,3,B017IXVSBG,Slow.,1495756800,,5,5.0
7507018,5,B017IXVSBG,Beautifully written and poetic. The narration weaves such a great story that makes all the patriarchs feel very human. The strongest part of the movie are characters you can trust and even relate to their struggles. This is the best genesis movie I've ever seen or heard.,1494892800,2,271,4.787234042553192
7507019,5,B017IXVSBG,"Really moving and thought provoking. Showing the men and women of biblical narrative as a little less larger than life -- and a lot more in need of God's grace, wisdom, courage and love.",1490400000,2,186,4.5
7507020,5,B017IXVSBG,Great,1486857600,,5,5.0

7507024,5,B017IXVSBG,It's very good and the story has a great way of getting you there. Back in that time.,1481932800,2,85,3.7777777777777777
7507025,5,B017IXVSBG,Beautiful way of telling the amazing stories in Genesis..loved this.,1481846400,,68,5.9
7507026,1,B017IXVSBG,"I never wrote a review before, but I had to warn prospective watchers that this movie jumps around giving small scraps of poor acting with horible direction. I really wanted to watch the story of Genesis with a loved one and this movie was the worst I've ever seen. Please go elsewhere if you want an enjoyable bible story.",1479427200,,323,4.491525423728813
7507027,4,B017IXVSBG,"I love this movie! I only wish it didn't skip around the biblical timeline so much. It would make more sense if they kept things in order. For people without a good understanding of the Bible, might not ""get it"".",1479168000,,212,4.325
7507028,1,B017IXVSBG,"Sorry this movie did not do the Bible justice, a very slow dud",1478304000,2,62,3.8461538461538463
7507029,3,B017IXVSBG,"The title is ""The Book of Genesis"" but Moses is depicted and he isn't in Genesis but rather Exodus...",1476748800,2,101,4.368421052631579
7507030,1,B017IXVSBG,"This movie was totally NOT biblically correct, nor any of the costumes or the environment such as the houses etc.  not worth the money at all!!!!",1476403200,,145,4.576923076923077
7507031,3,B017IXVSBG,"The movie's plot of retelling the iconic tales of Genesis (Adam & Eve, Cain & Abel, Noah, Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph) is mixed up and out of order, and the design of the sets, costumes, and visual effects look cheap. Overall the film is great in terms of cinematography, acting and dialogue. I would personally say that the film is not really exciting but it does give a great message about God's love for man.",1473465600,,410,4.48
8739459,5,B017IXVSBG,"Seriously awesome!! I even cried they some areas.

Im fully bed ridden right now, going on 4 years and it really helped me see goodness they my hardships, it told the Genesis story so different then Ive seen so far.

Its a gotta watch.

Have no idea how one could rate this a 1??? Maybe its their first time hearing about God or got offended somehow?? Idk",1535587200,,355,4.268656716417911
8739460,1,B017IXVSBG,"Too American in fashions, mannerism, and style. Not great performance",1525478400,,69,6.0
8739461,2,B017IXVSBG,"This movie is mostly made for screen...a lot of important details were left out, details that help explain what were going on in that time better. It is better to read the book for yourself and not base Genesis solely on this film...huge let down.",1524182400,,247,4.511111111111111
8739462,1,B017IXVSBG,"This movie is all over the place. I cant even keep up with who is who. Im not racist at all but we have got to do better with casting biblical movies.
Their clothing looked like it was from slavery days and they have Jacob wearing boots. This movie is NOT biblically accurate. The poetry throws me off every time. Joseph is supposed to be unrecognizable yet they have him looking clearly the same throughout its story. In my opinion, its not a good movie therefore, I couldn't finish it. Read Genesis in your bible for the real story.",1523059200,,534,4.404040404040404
8739463,5,B017IXVSBG,Love this movie. Its like poetry in action.,1522627200,,43,4.5

8739465,1,B017IXVSBG,"It was all over the place...the clothes, furniture, pretty much everything in the storytelling of the events of Genesis were ""off"".  Disappointment",1516752000,,147,5.681818181818182
8739466,5,B017IXVSBG,"Although the scenery, props and costumes weren't accurate chronologically in history; the point was made very well! If you listen to the tale by the narrator, it was a story told about Genesis, the whole Book of the Bible. and I thought it was refreshing and well done.",1516492800,,269,4.625
8739467,5,B017IXVSBG,WOW! I loved the way this movie poetically put together the lives of those whom the Bible talks about to show that even through their mistakes God was always there. Because Sin entered the world we have trials and temptations. We were in need of a savior. The lives of those portrayed seems to combine with the lives of us in the world today. You just have to watch it. This movie will touch your heart!,1516320000,,403,4.315789473684211
8739468,1,B017IXVSBG,Is not The real Genesis of the Bible tell Forget it I won't watch I just want to watch the real thing because of the world and thinking they live is not as the same we live today even more after Jesus came to earth this what I call a fake movie.,1515024000,,245,3.730769230769231
