6797680,5,B00PCKG2IW,"""Bleeding Hearts"" is a Magnificent Visual of Madness, HORROR, & Humor !!!
The Violence is BreathTaking & the Laughs are Abundant !!!
The Cast is Astounding; With Robert Loggia, Charles Durning, & The CandyMan HimSelf, TONY TODD !!!
The Rest of the Crew is Equally Proficient, With Dustin ""Screech"" Diamond & Some of the Most Beautiful & Sexy Women in Films ToDay !!!
  Standing Out Among These Ladies are MELANTHA BLACKTHORNE & SEREGON O'DASSEY !!!! > They are Equally Charming, Lovely, & Stacked Like Goddesses !!!! > Their Acting is Incredible; & They Go from Giggling SchoolKids to Raving MANIACS in a Matter of Seconds !!!
  I was Pleasantly Astounded with the Pace & Timing of the Film > With Every Second being Filled With Action, Suspense, Humor, & Those
Ravishing Naked & Semi-Naked Ladies > Often, All of this at Once !!!
  I Strongly Recommend This Flick; & I'm Looking Forward to Seeing these Wondrous Ladies in Other Films >

6797683,3,B00PCKG2IW,"Overall, Bleeding Hearts will fail to meet the more serious horror fans expectations, but for the peeps-especially the guys-that like shameless cheeky horror, this film offers more than enough camp, fetish, flesh, blood to entertain. The acting is just as you would expect, less is not more in this situation, more is more when it comes to the melodramatic delivery of the cast, witty dialog, insane atmosphere, and campy vibe. Bleeding Hearts, as I said earlier, isn't as strong a film as Scavenger Killers, but the familiar actors, and twisted humor of Vecchio and Robbins is very much present. - See more at: http://asouthernlifeinscandaloustimes.blogspot.com/2015/01/my-review-of-bleeding-hearts.html#sthash. 2Z4gx91l.dpuf",1429142400,5,726,5.923809523809524
6797684,4,B00PCKG2IW,"I really don't get why this movie has gotten such bad reviews. What were the other reviewers expecting? I picked it up because I got another movie by the same production team called Scavenger Killers and enjoyed it. Is Bleeding Hearts a cinematic masterpiece? No. Is it a fun, over-the-top horror movie with tons of nudity and gore? Yes. One piece of advice: give it a chance. The beginning of the movie is the weakest part, but after you get past the initial scene it goes in a very different direction and picks up a lot of steam.",1428969600,6,532,4.438775510204081
6797685,1,B00PCKG2IW,Awful,1428278400,,5,5.0
6797686,1,B00PCKG2IW,This movie was dreadful. It made very little sense. The acting was abysmal even by B movie standards. There was a ton of idiotic filler to pad the movie's length.  I can honestly say this was the worst movie I've seen in a decade. I regret that I sat all the way through it wondering if something would get better. I've seen college film projects that were a thousand times more coherent. What a waste of Tony Todd!,1426550400,4,415,4.32051282051282
6797687,1,B00PCKG2IW,"This movie was so low budget that I knew within the first 3 seconds it was going to be horrible. I used to run a video store so low budget doesn't always mean it's bad, I've seen some very good low budget movies, so I tried to give it a try but I honestly didn't make it past the first 5 minutes before turning it off. It didn't take long for me to decide that this movies wasn't worth wasting precious time out of my life that I would never get back as it is bad enough that I wasted money on this movie that I will never get back! In the few mins that I did watch I'm not sure that what I saw Amazon would allow written. It has a lot of crazy religious rantings in the begining, lots of pot usage, something that may or may not have been hallucinations evolving Santa clauses ""thing"" being a big candy cane, sexual content, & to top it all off it was shot so low budget that it looked fake, like people walking in front of a camera. If you know your movie rating there's what you call B movies and so forth I would rate the filming of this item a Z!!! Like I said all of that in the first 5 mins was way too much for me and I did not want to waste my time! Hopefully this post can keep others from the same fate!!!",1423353600,10,1216,3.887550200803213
8687379,4,B00PCKG2IW,"There should be no unrealistic expectations when folks choose this movie, it's obviously not a serious attempt at film making. It's got good skin, a fun plot, and remains irreverent throughout. It's also got a surprising number of cameos proving how desperate ""stars"" well past their prime can get.",1494547200,,298,5.1020408163265305

8687387,1,B00PCKG2IW,"Wow, this was lame. Though it's always fun to watch beautiful ladies abuse dudes in bondage, this is like a movie that ran out of steam on a weak premise and then tried to be a different movie instead - the problem is that that was also a poorly conceived movie. Looks like they had fun making this, but if they had tried harder, it might have been an interesting film.",1456876800,,369,4.211267605633803
