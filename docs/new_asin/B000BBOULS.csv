2410763,5,B000BBOULS,"I started watching the first season last night. And I have got to tell you DICE is truly out of this world. The action, the drama, and last but not least the High Definition Graphics are excellent.

2410764,5,B000BBOULS,I don't know why D.I.C.E. didn't stay on Toonami very long that's the reason why this show is not living the American dream. This show got a lot of robot vs robot violence.,1141430400,,172,4.242424242424242

2410787,5,B000BBOULS,"Andrew Dice Clay is now a classic comic like Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy and Sam Kinison. We have all lost Robin and Sam and Eddie doesn't seem to go in front of the camera anymore. But Dice is still making a go at keeping his era of comedy alive. It is very dirty but that seems to be quite common these days. So he fits in as far as that goes but he also brings his physical presence to his show. His wife Natasha Leggero really makes it complete. And she like Dice deserves a chance to keep everybody laughing.",1481500800,,514,4.15
2410788,5,B000BBOULS,This show is brilliant and hilarious. Definitely not the annoying Dice from the 80's.,1481241600,,85,5.142857142857143

2410791,5,B000BBOULS,"I grew up up in the 90's and saw all of this guy's stand up on cable...so when I say don't expect it to be the same humor, I mean that.

This is a realistic, modern Andrew Dice Clay who is playing himself in a not too drastic, over-the-top way and it really entertains.  It's more simple than that, but let me say, it's a well-written show with different minor actors (spaghetti waiter from It's Always Sunny) and other personalities giving support to guide this show to the level of entertainment I expect from Showtime.  This freaking thing delivers on so many levels, please give it a chance before you dismiss it.  There is a lot of great comedic timing and the first show in the series has a gay wedding theme that pretty much sets the precedent that this isn't just going to be your regular Andrew Dice Clay outing.  It's comedy for everyone.

Please give it a chance.  It's not the alpha male Dice Man you know from HBO in the 90's, it's way better than that.

If you need a reason to watch in order to get familiar, watch the episodes with Adrien Brody.",1478476800,2,1061,4.350253807106599

2410853,5,B000BBOULS,"i am a liberal arts graduate, bernie supporting woman of the 80's/90's and it is so great to see dice back. i always loved him because seriously, who takes this stuff seriously? and it is funny as always. i think he must have partnered up with a great writing team and producer to guide him through the TV series thing versus stand up and the craft work shows but it is still the classic dice man. and forget all the critics, i liked ford fairlane and casual sex. those few moments of vulnerability shown in those 2 films (yeah i called them ""films"") are present in a somewhat (but not too much) self aware dice of 2016. highlights for me: the entire adrian brody episode, dice's response to his girlfriend when offered a ""pity BJ"" and the season finale. it is NOT for everyone and you only need watch the pilot for the purposes of set up, definitely not a pilot that ""grabs me"".....",1461888000,,883,4.390243902439025

2410866,5,B000BBOULS,"Clay should be commended on his courage to share with us his struggles with falling from the very top of the mountain, and presenting it in such a way only the Dice Man could. The blend of the 80s Brooklynite, tough-guy persona metamorphosed into the aging, quirky, Jewish male is nothing short of brilliant. The old comic material comes through as almost fresh as applied to an entirely new stage of his life. The new material (such as resigning to his limitations, control in his relationship, lack of work, gambling, etc) is fun and hilarious. The writing and the acting in the series is top shelf. Take note: Dice remains committed to the most crude (blue) of comedy; however, I think this time around he actually pokes fun at how primitive, misogynistic, and sexist his persona presents itself. Tune in for guaranteed laughter.",1460505600,5,832,4.825174825174825
2410867,5,B000BBOULS,"So, I was born in 85.  I was not old enough or around to see Andrew Dice Clay.  I have heard about him though.  So, I see this show is coming on.  I recorded it and could not stop laughing.

The show is simple and easy to follow.  From the episode I watched, there is really one thing going on.  From that thing, he did stuff to try to solve the problem.

I did not know that all the episodes were available.  Now, I shall watch them all tonight.

Oh, it seems that this is the type of show, in which you really have to pay attention to the words the guy speaks.  It is quick witted and always in the moment.",1460332800,2,608,3.901639344262295

But it is better now, we all got old. I think the writing is superlative, Dice's delivery is at another level, more nuanced, like all tge great comics that at some point turn a stand up's need for perfect time, into something that clicks in front of the camera. This time nobody can confiscate my Dice tapes.... that's great too",1512777600,,522,4.623655913978495
