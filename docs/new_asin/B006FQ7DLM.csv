The sets are performed in a good normal walking speed and not so fast that you can't follow.  The set was then presented in slow motion that was not blurred by someone with their finger on the slow motion button.  The techniques were clear and easy to follow presented multiple times.  I believe the instructor spoke English but I can't recall whether he did or not.  The subtitles were grammatically correct and not written in gibberish or by someone not familiar with the style

I admit since I could only find one computer to play the DVD that I have yet to view it from start to finish so this is only a preliminary review but in all a nice video",1367712000,,890,4.188235294117647
