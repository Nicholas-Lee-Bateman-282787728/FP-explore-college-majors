Good luck with that! now that Warner Archive is releasing this on dvd due next month (May 2014).  Hmm, let's see...$80 for a ragged faded print of the film on tape...or twenty bucks for a great-looking copy on disc?  Decisions, decisions!",1397260800,5,382,4.352112676056338
866638,5,630441143X,"I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was gorgeous in this
Film as she played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry a
robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist. Harry goes to a
funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a ride. When
things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to
figure out the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with
the help of Vittorio De Sica to from there on mob. Rest a sure that no
matter what the gang goes after that the outcome is never the same and
will keep you on the edge of your sit. The rest of the out come you
need to watch for yourself. As far as Raquel goes if you're a fan of

866639,3,630441143X,"Robert Wagner is the attractive young gangster / jetset hipster, and Raquel Welch is his groovy chick along for the ride. Vittorio Desica (who was a famous actor in Italy)does a great job acting the part of an ageing Italian gentleman. I first saw this film with my Dad who was a big fan. My dad grew up in Italy in the area where this movie was filmed (Naples), so watching it gave him a nostalgic feeling. Reasons to watch this movie: great scenery of southern Italy, Desica's acting, and the uniqueness of the film: you won't EVER see a comedy movie nowadays, filmed on location with such good actors, and with such a simple yet amusing storyline.",1149033600,6,650,4.516949152542373
866912,2,630441143X,"Mincing no words this movie is a colossal bore.  Save for Vittorio de Sica and Edward G. Robinson  the characters are noxious none more than Robert Wagner and the heist at the center of the film is pure cookie cutter.  Raquel Welch's function  is to ride shotgun and slip in and out of skimpy outfits and swimwear.  The Italian scenery is nice but not enough to keep you awake. Even the Animals title tune is mediocre.  Welch fans should skip this one and check out ""Fathom"" where her physical assets are more highly exploited and she's given something of substance to do.",1435881600,5,572,4.5588235294117645

866921,4,630441143X,"[The Biggest Bundle of Them All - 1968 - Widescreen 16x9 presentation - 108 minutes]

Warner Archives has done a laudatory remastering of this film - the colors vibrantly brilliant, the audio crisp and clear, a proper aspect ratio, and a truly wonderful release after all these years languishing in obscurity. Its audience may be limited today, but for fans of 60s films, heist capers and Raquel Welch, it really couldn't be more welcome.

The opening song is sung by Johnny Mathis, the title track written and performed by the Animals, and the flicks soundtrack done by no other than the legendary Riz Ortolani - musically impressive by any 60s standards.

The films true stars are Vittorio De Sica and Raquel Welch, as they command more screen presence than all else combined. De Sicas comedic scenes are the true hilarity here, and Miss Welch dons numerable curve-embellishing outfits and bikinis that astonish your attention in every frame of the film, reminding us just why she wore the crown of sexiest siren of the sixties bar none. Though Robert Wagner gets top bill on the DVD (but Raquel gets the headline bill in opening credits as she was more widely known and had more screen credits under her butt, and what a magnificently glorious one it was) due in part to his success as Al Mundy in TVs It Takes A Thief, his character here is highly unlikable if not downright obnoxious.  It also shows how limited his acting chops were - he was a charming but one trick pony for certain. Unfortunately, Godfrey Cambridge is underutilized as the token buffoon, but Edward G. Robinson still has the wily wit to carry off his few scenes commendably. Theres even a small cameo by Victor Spinetti (a mainstay in most Richard Lesters 60s flicks) as an dodgy pilot near the end that adds additional mirth to a film thats not as funny as the DVD info would have you believe. Thats not to say it doesnt have its merits and charms, it certainly does, but hilarious its not. Most films from this time period loose a bit of their lunacy, like most others do, but its still  fresh air to those of us old enough to remember what those cinematic times were like. As a kid, I couldn't get enough of them, and still enjoy them for what they are and don't fault them for what they're not. Make any sense?

As far as plot, Harry (Wagner) and his five bush-league cohorts kidnap retired mobster Cesare Celli (De Sica) in hopes of some easy cash, but Cellis too much of a credit risk to be ransomed at any price. Supremely insulted by this realization, Celli offers to lead these ragtag amateurs on a worthy heist in pursuit of The Biggest Bundle of Them All, a train robbery worth millions. (Yeah, Im painfully aware how many times weve heard this plot before, but the Italian scenery, De Sica and Raquels costumes compensate us for sitting through it once again). They enlist the experience of the Professor (Ed. G. Robinson) to assist them in lifting approximately two tons of platinum in transit on a train. All they need is some start-up cash, some firepower, a truck, a tank, an airplane, a fence and a considerable skill set. You figure out where this all goes askew, but enjoy yourself in the process.

A 3  star flick elevated to 4 solid stars for reasons outlined above.",1401321600,24,3262,4.612068965517241
