The names of each machine was explained as it showed how it worked.
The segments were just the right amount of time.
My grandson loved it",1313020800,,184,4.285714285714286
8048274,5,B0007LFPP2,"My son is almost 2, and we just watched this for the first time tonight.  We both loved it.  The video is narrated by children, but is not childish at all.  The language is accurate and easy to understand.  The only words on screen are the main labels for the items; e.g. ""boat"", ""bulldozer"", etc.  We are watching it for the second time now, and I predict many future watchings.

Really excellent work!",1301011200,,403,4.4520547945205475
8048275,5,B0007LFPP2,"We were told about this product from a friend.  She let me borrow it and we had to go get one of own.  My 4 year old loves this video and I love it because he learns so much from it.  It takes you through each of the pieces of equipment and educates your child about each one.  Before we start the video, he wants to collect his boats, planes, motorcycles, etc so he can go along with the video to identify the different parts of each one, like the jets on the plane for example.  If your little one is into equipment and you like videos that are interactive and learning then this is a good choice for your family.",1168300800,4,615,4.049586776859504
8048276,5,B0007LFPP2,My 3 yer-old son enjoys this DVD together with Opposites DVD. I wish I had it earlier for him,1166745600,2,93,3.9473684210526314
8048277,5,B0007LFPP2,"The ""Motorized Madness"" is excellent, it has 10 machines such as ""airplane, bulldozer, dump truck, backhoe loader, helicopter, bucket truck, boat, motlecycle, fire truck, and bus."" It also explains each part of the machine, like the wings, propellers, engine, cab...

The bumble bee ""Opposites"" video is also great. My 18-mon son can both say and read all 20 words in it within 2 weeks: ""in,out; yours,mine; fast, slow; up, down; top, bottom; on, off; go, stop; big, little; yes, no..."" The best part of it is that the words are supper big and bright in the full screen! When demonstrate ""mine & yours"", there is a animated little person draging the big purple word ""mine"" to himself; then that little person pushing the word ""yours"" to another person. Every word is so well illustrated in the vedio! My son loves it.

The baby bumble bee surely produce the best of the best infant and kids reading program vedios in the market--as good as Dr. Titzer's ""Your baby can read 1-5"" DVDs and Dr. Glenn Dorman's ""How to teach your baby to read"" book.

I love ""Opposites"", ""Motorize"", ""Actions words 1-3"" and ""vocabulary builders 1-5"" the most. Highly recommended!",1126137600,5,1157,4.833333333333333
