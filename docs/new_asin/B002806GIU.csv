I usually like to ""see"" instruction, but this DVD is poor quality. She does show and explain each exercise,but that is just it...She never really gives you a 30 min workout. You would have to fast forward thru each explanation to get the workout in. Plus, she repeats herself over and over! It almost makes you want to throw your tv out the window! :) I can't say if this routine works, as I've yet to stick with it, but I will keep trying! I'm pretty much willing to try anything at this point!",1247702400,45,632,4.231404958677686

8355304,3,B002806GIU,I bought this book to help with my diastasis recti. I did not like how the book was written. First the format would have been better if she would have made out a schedule. ( for example week 1 do 3 sets of elevator exercises).  She list these exercises and describes them and gives you a number. If you Pritchard the DVD this is a 12 week workout I believe. The number of repetitions is not realistic. I do not have time to do a 1000 of any exercises. You really have to concentrate to isolate these specific muscles so there is no way I would have time to do these. My OB/GYN advised me to have corrective surgery because no exercise will heal a diastasis recti.,1481241600,,663,4.2204724409448815

8355307,5,B002806GIU,"The DVDs being sold on Amazon are the OLD versions of it and are sold at triple the price of the UPDATED VERSION !!! This now has an exercise routine at the end of the DVD.  You know it is an updated version if you see on the cover in the title Diastasis Rehab in front of  Lose  Your Mummy Tummy.  You can get the UPDATED  DVD on my Tupler Technique website and the website of all the Tupler Technique Trained Professionals for $25  or less if you buy it in a package with the guidebook and splint.

The Lose Your Mummy Tummy book is also out of date and I do not support this book.  Julie Tupler, RN",1406764800,25,601,3.991596638655462
8355308,5,B002806GIU,"I am a mother in my 30's with three children (within 3 1/2yrs of each other).  My 'baby' is now 4yrs old and I am SICK of looking pregnant!

I read reviews on the ""Lose Your Mummy Tummy""  book a few different times in trying to find an answer for my diastasis.  Each time I was turned off by the negative reviews and the people saying the program was no more than sucking your tummy in several times a day.  I did that (sucked my tummy in, a lot) didn't work.  And for new mothers, which I am not.

Everywhere else I turned it seemed it was absolute that there was no way to correct separated stomach muscles other than surgery, period, end of the line.

I went for two tummy tuck consultations over 2yrs and though I was really tempted I ended up deciding it wasn't worth the huge cost, the unsure outcome (may not be able to wear a bikini anyhow--scar could be high or belly button unattractive), and the huge scar...plus the stigma that goes with having a tummy tuck and plastic surgery in general.  I also found out that I do also in fact have an umbilical hernia.  I thought that I just got stuck with an outie belly button from pregnancy.  So...I decided to have that surgically repaired because there are risks that come with leaving an umbilical hernia untreated and the scar was small.

While waiting for my upcoming surgery I decided to throw caution to the wind and spend the $100 on the dvd, splint, guidebook and resistance band.  Even though that is still a lot of money to me with young little girls to take care of, it's a whole lot less than a $7-8k tummy tuck.  Figured winter was a great time to give it a try.

It arrived a couple weeks before my scheduled hernia surgery and I thought I would just start it before and pick it up again after.

The splint is a newer version I believe.  It's good and solid.  It rides up, which is annoying, but I see no way to prevent it.  Your hip area is wider than your rib cage so when you sit and stand and bend and move it's gonna come up.  Keep adjusting it.  Over and over.

The video is very thorough.  It is not meant to be the kind of video you work out with-but one to teach you the methods, lessons, and reasons to do what you need for the program to be successful.  Pay attention-there is a lot of information.  If you don't have the guidebook that tells you what to do each day of each week, write down what she says to do on the video.  The video is long and dry--you don't want to have to watch it over and over so take good notes.  Julie is not the new, fun, cheerleading type personality that we have come to expect with a lot of work out videos.  She is serious and to the point.  Not great for entertainment value but important.

People complain about the amount of exercises you have to do.  It seems like a lot on paper, but it's not that much really-they don't take that long.  I do morning ones on the drive to work,  my mid-day ones when I'm sitting in the office, and my evening ones on the car ride home.  They aren't easy and you have to focus on breathing and doing them right-difficult at first--but gets easier.

As far as people saying it's ridiculous and too restrictive--ie- you have to get out of bed certain ways, can't be in certain positions, and be cautious about your day to day activities, I understand-but, that's the way it is.  Sorry.  Yes-you can ignore what Julie says--but you aren't going to get good results--she tells you these things because they are important.  Not much worth having comes easy and I am taking this seriously.  If 18 weeks of repetitive exercises and body awareness gets me my flat tummy back I am in!

People always want programs to be enjoyable and sometimes they just aren't.

So, on to how it's going so far.

I am AMAZED at how quickly I saw results!  AMAZED!!!

The first day after wearing the splint my tummy was much smaller and my hernia was fading (completely unexpected).

Day two I measured 3 inches smaller around the middle (top, middle, bottom, 1 inch each)!!!!!  3 inches--I am not kidding you!  AND my outie was an innie!!!

Seriously, I promise!
I don't know Julie and have no reason to support her other than to want to help people who were as frustrated with their body as I was.

Now, I know if I stopped now it'd all sag back out to where it was--but that is pretty promising stuff!

I mean, I was a runner, a Jillian Michaels 30-day shred girl, tried pilates, did zumba, weighed less than I did in high school, everything and neither my belly button nor diastasis ever budged.

I have hope that this will actually work!!

I canceled my hernia surgery and am going to give it my best.

I will keep you updated down the line...I just wanted to post a little more information for people like me who have been looking for help!

ps--I think it is imperative that you have the splint btw.  Yes, it's making Julie money--who expects her to do this all for free?  but I think it make a HUGE difference--it reminds me to keep my tummy in during the day and is supportive (also I can't binge on food anymore because there is no room!).

*3 week update
Going well...splint is annoying of course--especially as I overeat over the holidays and it makes me feel chunky, lol...but I'm wearing it 24/7 other than showers.
I lost an inch around the top, middle and bottom measurement of my tummy and the huge thing is the depth of my connective tissues.  I couldn't even feel I had any before but now the tissue is so close to the surface that it's hard to feel the seperation of muscles (which is down from a 4 fingertip width to 3.
I am still very please and pushing on.
My tummy looks better than it has in 6 years!",1354752000,119,5648,4.294507575757576
8355309,4,B002806GIU,"I bought both the book and dvd. And I found that the book was not sufficient as I could not understand the certain exercises. The DVD makes it very clear how to the exercises,but there is not a single workout session that you can follow through.instead there is lot of explanations between each exercise ,so if you are trying to follow them after you understood how to do them you keep forwarding and pausing which is kind of annoying. My suggestion for improvemnets:have one whole section explain all the moves in detail.have a second section,the beginners routine,that you can actually work with,no explanations. Then have the advanced section next in one complete recording with no explanations.if possible,add the prenatal workout as another section(this is a separate DVD,but the moves are very similar,so why not put them altogether)
then have an efficient menu that jumps to each section.",1328745600,10,895,5.095238095238095
8355310,5,B002806GIU,"I admit that Julie's personality is a bit dry, and that the quality isn't all that good.  But if  content is important to you, you won't be sorry.  I disagree that she should be doing the exercises with you.  This isn't that type of video.  If you follow her program the whole way through you have to do this several times a day. It would be impractical to pop this video in 3xs a day. The beauty of this program is that you can do it anywhere.  You don't have to be laying down, in front of you TV like you'd be for a typical ab workout.  I'll also say that I am a firm believer in this program.  I lost 2"" the first three weeks.  And that was all from my stomach flattening out due to my ab muscles actually doing their job of holding my internal organs in.  It had nothing to do with any weight loss, as I never lost a pound.  Again, this is not a weight loss video, so don't expect that here.  I recommend this to everyone I know.  I tell everyone about it. Btw, if you had a long labor, where you stalled at the END, it most likely was due to your diastasis recti.  I'd highly suggest you try this program.  It might save you from an unnecessary c-section.",1317945600,22,1161,4.052863436123348
8355311,1,B002806GIU,"I felt like I was watching a video from 1972...it is so outdated.  I actually couldn't even get through the whole thing it was so boring.  If you are looking for something fun and upbeat, look elsewhere.",1286755200,7,203,4.45945945945946
8355312,5,B002806GIU,"I have both the Lose Your Mummy Tummy book and dvd. I prefer the dvd as you can see the exercises being performed properly. I first used it five years ago when I had my daughter, and still use it today to keep my abs flat. I use the dvd mainly for the abs and pelvic floor exercises. I find the tupler technique much more effective than traditional situps. I even ordered more copies for friends all the way from US to UK.",1263945600,31,422,4.096385542168675
