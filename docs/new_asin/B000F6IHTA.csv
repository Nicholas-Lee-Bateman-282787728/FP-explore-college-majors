2553056,4,B000F6IHTA,"Putting aside the irrelevant argument as to why Criterion chose to add this movie to their collection, just sit back and enjoy the cheesy ride that is ""Equinox"".  Sure it's a B-movie but Criterion really hasn't skimped on other offerings.

I appreciate that Criterion includes the theatrical 1970 release (version 2) as well as the original unseen 1967 film, ""Equinox:  A Journey into the Supernatural"" (version 1) that served as its source.  Version 2 is not a remake but a reconstruction; Jack Woods, the 1970 director makes use of scenes and situations from the original, adds on some new footage (generously giving himself a lynchpin, yet ludicrous, role) and the whole version ends up a big mess.

The 1967 version clearly stands as the winner.  The story is tighter, the characters better developed (just little moments like Susan rooting through David's glove compartment for a headscarf adds more dimension), the dubbing less strained and we get two sequences that work so much better than in the later version:  the appearance of the flying demon is better played out and more chilling, and the succinct voice-over of Professor Watermann describing his encounters with the mysterious book works perfectly.  For some reason, the voiceover in version 2 is given to the character of David in the movie who reads a similar, but not identical, explanation in a deadly monotone.

It would be fun to play a drinking game as to all the times Vicki's hair length changes from shot to shot (she's wearing a very obvious wig in the 1970 scenes; I like to imagine the actress had grown long hippie hair by the time of the reshoots), Frank Bonner grows sideburns, or Jack Woods throws himself in front of the camera contorting his mouth to show just how evil he is.  Oooo, scary.  Not.

Thanks to Criterion for including both versions, something that wouldn't be done by most studios.  Plus, there are lots of great extras, contemporary interviews with the actors, short films that make this DVD worth every penny. This film isn't just worth seeing for the fun effects, but for some much-needed light entertainment when you've had enough of Bergman.",1150416000,13,2145,4.908587257617729
2553057,3,B000F6IHTA,"Let's face it folks. This film is a classic. It was made by a bunch of college age kids for $6500.00 in 1967. Dennis Muren, Jim Danforth and David Allen got their start here and look where they went. They had a great idea for a film that was almost impossible to make for that kind of money even back in 1967. it was shlockmeister Jack H. Harris that bought it and added new footage and released it in 1970. Now Criterion is bringing out the ultimate edition this month. Not only will it have the 1970 version Jack Woods and Jack H. Harris put out, but the original '67 version. The extras on this disc are fantastic. There's Allen's infamous ""King Kong"" commercial (infamous because the animation was so good, people forgot that it was selling Volkswagens).It has all sorts of interviews and two commentaries. Not to mention several other rare shot films made by the same cast and outtakes and deleted scenes. How can you top that for the price? It's a good student film for the time period it was made in. However, the only way you can judge it is to watch it for yourself. You either like it or you don't. There's no in-between. I'll take the animated blue ape over any CGI Jurassic Park dinosaur anyday. Hats off to Citerion for taking obscure films like this and turning them into gems. I've been waiting for an ultimate edition of this film since I was a kid. And I was 10 when Jack H. Harris released it. I saw it at a Drive-In Theater. Anyone remember those?",1149984000,6,1466,4.393382352941177
2553058,2,B000F6IHTA,"Back in the pre-Star Wars days when kids like myself where so starved for a monster fix that we would eagerly endure films such as this just to get to the ""good parts,"" barely cognizant of the more numerous ""bad parts,"" or at least not caring about them, Equinox was one of those films you would stay up all night long to catch a glimpse of, happy even to find a black & white image from it in the pages of Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine. Post-Star Wars, when big budget sci-fi, horror, and fantasy films became a Hollywood staple, primitive films like this one were completely forgotten - some might say deservedly so. However, now that the glut of fantasy themed films has made people utterly incapable of enjoying the simple charms of films like this one it's tempting to give it more credit than it deserves simply as an act of defiance against the soulless CGI-drenched product of today (my two stars are for the effects, the Lovecraftian theme, and the appearance of Frank ""H. Tarlick"" Bonner). I seriously doubt anyone honestly holds the opinion that Equinox is a good movie, by any stretch of the imagination, though there are more things to enjoy about motion pictures than what we might consider ""good"". It is worthy of a first year film student, if that. Equinox is not without enduring, or perhaps merely endearing, ""good"" qualities. The special effects, for example, while primitive, were done by some of today's special effects pioneers (by the way, I always remembered this as a Jim Danforth picture more than a Dennis Muren, am I wrong?). Equinox features some cool stop motion and a little Lovecraftian horror, slight though it may be, and it boasts the presence of the great Frank Bonner, who would later go on to embody one of the greatest characters in TV comedy - the infamous and irrepressible salesman, Herb Tarlick, from WKRP in Cincinnati. If you're like me, when you watch Equinox you'll find yourself checking for Herb's famous white shoes and white belt whenever Frank appears on screen. The oddest thing of all about this DVD release is that it is from Critereon. A Criterion edition of Equinox??!! If there is a Critereon edition of Equinox, why can't I have a Critereon edition of Point Blank or Miller's Crossing, not to mention a thousand other films that have either been released in shoddy editions or not at all. Where's my Critereon edition of A Thousand Clowns? As fun and innocent as Equinox might be to its fans, should any exist, it's clearly more deserving of a 9.99 cheapo release, not this red carpet treatment. I will be surprised if anyone but overaged, still nerdy after all these years fanboys, a bizarre Critereon completist, and heavily funded library will purchase this disc. Naturally, I will be the first in line.",1149724800,11,2772,4.753112033195021
2553059,3,B000F6IHTA,"Creature Feature. Chiller Theatre. The Late Movie. These were all hosts to The Evil Dead inspiration Equinox.

Four teens on a picnic meet a wacky scientist who claims to be in possession of The Necronomicon (that book from the Evil Dead movies!). He reads from it and demons attack.

Man, I'll tell you what. Equinox scared the crap out of me. Me...a young child at the time who dutifully went to Sunday school every week to learn that God is good and the Devil is bad. Then along comes this movie with demons and some climactic threat that ""in 100 days and 100 nights"" (or was it years or months or hours???) demons or the Devil will rule. That was some heavy, scary stuff for a 1970s child who thought that the only monsters were TVs black and white Frankenstein, The Wolfman, Dracula, Godzilla and King Kong.

Today, a 5 year old can watch edited versions of The Exorcist on regular TV. And Equinox compared to The Exorcist is like comparing Scooby Doo to Wolf Creek. So, yes, this movie for its day was a real scarefest for a child....And, no, I don't recommend that kids watch The Exorcist. But this movie is more for someone that wants to reminisce; it's not for anyone who wants to see a really good, old movie.

Today a child (or an adult) is more likely to get nightmares from The Wiggles than from Equinox. But if you're a collector and you've been waiting for this...go for it.

But what's with the price?! At the time of this writing it was more than $20. That price spells rental at best.",1149552000,,1502,4.427536231884058
2553060,4,B000F6IHTA,"I have only fleeting memories of this low-budget epic (remembered fondly from numerous showings on San Francisco's KTVU Channel 2's Bob Wilkins' hosted ""Creature Features""), but that fact notwithstanding, even though I've not seen the flick in decades (two, to be exact), I'd searched virtually EVERYWHERE for a copy, either on VHS or DVD, with no luck (apart from the guy on eBay hawking bootlegs which he promised were in an exceedingly crappy condition).

 So it was with a great deal of excitement that I finally learned this thing was finally being released as part of the Criterion Collection. I've no idea whether it will live up to my admittedly hazy memories of it as being an ultra-cool Monster Mash, or if it will turn out to be a horrible disapointment, but here's to Criterion for having the cajones to give this a proper DVD release.",1147219200,31,847,4.794520547945205

2553064,4,B000F6IHTA,"I myself am one of those who love this film - both for it's creative use of effects, and the gumption of the people behind it. One thing I'll state right now - I'm not a *Criterion* fan, especially with the prices they tend to offer. Still - this was a movie I basically HAD to have. It will never reach the heights of ""Aliens"" - nor will it fall to the depths of ""Dragon Wars"". I prefer to think of it as a learning platform (since I've got a yearning to get into the film making field - and have locally made several excellent contacts.

The film itself really isn't too bad. In fact, it's quite a step up from several independent films I've seen from local film makers - especially the special effects, which were quite innovative. The story is a little bit on the *meh* side, but tolerable. If anything, a few chuckles would/should be expected when viewing it.

Where this edition shines is the assorted outtakes, commentaries and interviews - as well as deleted scenes. As I've mentioned, I really think of this as a learning platform.

Finally - I also have recently invoked the film's title when reviewing various locally produced films. Most of the time I either like or dislike a particular item - but occasionally there's the middle-of-the-road offering. In that case, I have developed a minor catch-phrase: ""Well, it's no Equinox."" I then leave it at that. Does that mean the film I'm reviewing is good? Does it mean the film is bad? I leave it to the reader and viewer to decide.

Personally - if someone is thinking about working on a film project, I really feel they could benefit from watching this and it's various extras.",1455235200,2,1638,4.523648648648648

2553069,5,B000F6IHTA,"THE EQUINOX is a high-concept, $6,000 budget (!) wonder that basically tells the same story as Sam Raimi's wildly over-the-top offering, THE EVIL DEAD, only without the hyperkinetic camera work and gore FX. Think of EQUINOX as EVIL DEAD if it were done by Ray Harryhausen. Kids enjoying an afternoon picnic in the wilderness accidentally gain access the Necronomicon, (literally, the Book of The Dead), and when they innocently speak a few incantations aloud, they unwittingly unleash supernatural forces that try and destroy them. Can they escape???

THE EQUINOX is an important film for the fact that it goes to show that anyone with a vision (even if it wasn't crystal clear) and access to a movie camera could see their dreams realized on the big screen. Shot on a budget that today might pay for a pair of Robert Downy Jr.'s socks, this movie helped launch the careers of three of Hollywood's best special effects technicians. The ringleader of this film was a young Dennis Muren, who would go on to win multiple Academy Awards working for ILM, the premier F/X house in Tinsel Town. The other two names, you may not be as familiar with: David Allen & Jim Danforth. Regrettably, Allen & Danforth never achieved Muren's level of acclaim nor success. For years these two continued to quietly hone their skills, establishing a reputation as the go-to guys for low budget, hands-on stop-mo F/X. And special mention to actor Frank Boers Junior, would go on to achieve stardom (working as Frank Bonner) a decade or so later, acting in the popular 80's sitcom ""WKRP In Cincinnati,"" where he portrayed station sales manager and all-around lovable jerk, Herb Tarlek. Bonner would quietly slip behind the camera, where he continues to work today.

The Criterion Collection, a top-tier releasing company most often associated with obscure arthouse titles and subtitled foreign films, is NOT just a snobbery supplier, despite the lofty insistence of several reviewers here, who must have a hard time fitting into the same room with their overinflated egos. Criterion, God bless 'em, also maintains a respectable ""guilty pleasure"" selection that's sure to tickle fans of B-film shockers, with a small-but-impressive offering of genre titles. Among them: Carnival of Souls, Fiend Without A Face, the 4-film Monsters & Madmen set, the original 1954 Godzilla, and more. The crew of Criterion knocks another one out of the park here with the release of THE EQUINOX. This 2-disc box set contains two different versions of the feature film and is chock full of all sorts of bonus goodies as well. The first disc contains the slightly longer, heavily-altered 1970 theatrical cut of the film that was overseen by B-grade film maestro Jack H. Harris. The original 1967 cut of the film is thoughtfully included too, for the first time on DVD. Frankly, the theatrical cut looks pretty amazing. Criterion did a terrific job restoring this version, with a hi-def remaster that makes all previous releases look decidedly lame in comparison. Colors are bright & bold, blacks & mid-tones are strong and the clarity is surprisingly sharp for a film originally shot on 16mm. Soundmix is good too. This release is like a kid's dream come true: to see the goofy home movie that you & your pals made on summer weekends treated like it was the latest tentpole blockbuster from Steven Spielberg. The second disc contains a wealth of supplements and snippets from Muren's personal stash of trash (outtakes, test footage, stills & promo material, trailers & radio spots), along with fresh interviews from the cast & crew.

This film is a lot of fun and it's interesting to see the ingenious creativity utilized by Muren, Allen & Danforth to realize their vision.  Some of the end results aren't so hot, some are cool, and others are surprisingly impressive. The flying demon is a fearful creation and the giant blue ogre is an ambitious concept as well. Sure the film is rough around the edges, (even the slightly more polished 1970 cut), but that's what is so great about this little wonder. It has an almost palpable feeling of raw energy & excitement that shows through in every frame. EQUINOX isn't some soul-less modern summer franchise film financed by a massive corporation run by clueless executives who know nothing about the movie business. It wasn't conceived & written by committee, trying to include (and appeal to) every age group & demographic in a shameless attempt to insure maximum box office returns. It wasn't overseen by 10 different producers who never even met one another, except via teleconference or Twitter. And, thankfully, the visuals weren't massaged by an army of SPFX technicians slaving away at powerful computer workstations situated in F/X houses around the globe, tasked with polishing & refining each and every frame of the film to flawless, sanitized, mass consumption-approved perfection.

If you like low (and NO) budget films, stop-motion monsters, the supernatural, or every tried your hand at movie-making as a kid, then you will probably love the Criterion Collection release of THE EQUINOX. To those elitist snobs who only enjoy artsy-fartsy fare... well I'm sure there must a sadly serious little French film about a suicidal sunflower and the autistic aardvark who loves her ...just waiting for you & your phoney friends to faun all over. <insert raspberry sound effect here>

2553077,4,B000F6IHTA,"Four friends, David, Vicki, Jim and Susan, head out into the woods to visit David's professor, Dr. Waterman. They find Waterman'home destroyed, the professor missing, and a mysterious book. It soon becomes apparent that in meddling with the book, Waterman accidentally opened a portal to another, hellish dimension, and now the demon Asmodeus (posing as a park ranger) wants to acquire the powerful book. The four friends must fight against a variety of ghoulish monsters sent after them by Asmodeus, and eventually Asmodeus himself, in order to make it back to civilization alive.

Often considered one of the best-worst movies of all time, Equinox was a student film made by a young Dennis Muren which producer Jack Woods picked up for cinematic distribution, casting himself as Asmodeus and shooting some new scenes. On the one hand, this seems like a strange movie for Criterion to release, especially in a two-disc set, however despite its ineptitude it features some charming stop-motion animation for the various monsters (and some impressive forced-perspective shots to turn an ordinary stuntman into a blue-skinned giant) and it's also certainly worthy of being preserved if only because Dennis Muren and his friends had such a piddly budget to work with that it' a miracle they even had a completed (albeit rough) film, even before Jack Woods came along.

Criterion's DVD of this film has the works. On the first disc there are two versions of Equinox. The first is the Jack Woods-produced, somewhat redone theatrical release most film buffs know of or have seen. The second is a true treasure, though. It's Muren's original, unaltered cut of the film from before Woods reedited it! Complete and uncut! While they don't differ overmuch in terms of story, the pacing and order of some scenes is different. Most noteworthy is the fact that in Muren's cut, the character of Asmodeus is not present and Jim is possessed rather than murdered and replaced. Both versions of the film have insightful and fun audio commentaries.

The second disc is a treasure trove of extra stop-motion footage and outakes and documentaries, some test footage of ""Taurus"" (one of the monsters, specifically the one featured on the DVD cover) and a comical short film called ""Zorgon: The H-Bomb Beast from Hell,"" made in 1971. All in all, this is a Criterion release worth owning.",1313280000,3,2365,5.043478260869565
2553078,2,B000F6IHTA,"Yes. This is an amateur endeavor. Yes. Some of the people involved ended up with great careers. Yes. Certain things were accomplished with a miniscule budget. No. This is not a good movie.

Forrest J. Ackerman introduces the movie and lays the groundwork on how these youngsters were fans of his magazine and were inspired to make movies. How they went out and did so with little in their pockets. This is a sizable achievement given everything, but it just isn't that good. No artist bats a thousand. Not even when they have the best talents in the industry going to bat for them. We don't give them a break when things don't work out so I see no reason to do so here.

Here's the scoop. A college student has an appointment to meet one of his professors at the professor's home somewhere in the hills of California. Said student brings along a friend, two girls and a pic-a-nic basket and attempts a rendezvous. The professor's house is destroyed. The foursome hears crazy laughter from a nearby cave where they retrieve an ancient book from an all to tidy cave dweller. A creepy forest ranger is hanging around, and all manner of monsters and mayhem ensue.

Ed Begley Jr. did the camera work. Pre-WKRP Radio Frank Bonner is the buddy, Academy Award winning special effects wizard Dennis Muren did the more than decent, zero budget effects. But the script isn't that good. Frank Bonner does a decent enough job considering it was his first credited roll, but the rest of the cast is pretty lousy. They shot it up in the mountains, probably for budgetary reasons and to make sure nothing got in the way during the shoot. You get a lot of footage of people running up or down slopes. It just doesn't make for exciting film making.

We also have here amazing FX with rubber duckies or something. Monsters from Id or whatchacallit Lovecraftian horror pits. Even the famous Grimoire Book which dredges up the monstrous rubber duckies.

2553080,5,B000F6IHTA,"This set has the 1967 version, without the evil forest ranger, and the 1970 release with him, plus a few other changes. Both version are cool, but I prefer the forest ranger version which I call Osmosis because I can never remember his screen name which refers to the devil. The original version just had the fabulous four young tourists fighting the demons wanting the book of evil that landed in their grasp per an old crazy coot hidden in a dark forest mountain cave. The second incorporates a forest ranger on top of horse who oversees the predicament and is in charge of that forest.  There are various edits between the two movies, but the most outstanding is the addition of the forest ranger, who shall remain nameless because I cannot pronounce his name, and the scene when one of the male tourists transforms into the devil because his presence has been replaced by that being.  The transformation in the 1967 one shows him evolving into the flying demonic, and the second has him turning into Osmosis, and then becomes the demon.  I actually like the first transformation better in the 1967 version, but the ranger is a welcome addition to the second version that I still prefer the 1970 release, although the first transformation was much better.
The only thing that disturbs me in these kind of pictures isn't the budget, the effects, or scenarios, but it's the reason why people in this sort of situation are drawn to enter dark unmarked caves, and build their own torches to do so even when danger is afoot.  I would have so went back to the car at the first hearing of the cackling voice of laughter coming from the inside of the cave without hesitation.  These people even went back to find the disappearing castle in the unusual part of the region.  I don't mean to be a bum sport, but let's get the hell out of here before we wind up in it would be my philosphy. Nuff said.  The movie makes it's point both ways, and its not hard to understand that this came from a student film project that blossomed to the big screen, long before Blair Witch Project which I don't particularly like because they don't show anything but massive paranoic screams at the air.

What are the odds? Anyway, EQUINOX always stuck with me, like a really good childhood nightmare. Having just watched it again, I can say that it was a real treat. Criterion has gone out of their way to make this the ultimate, definitive version. There are both the original 71 min. (1967) and 82 min. (1970) releases, and both are excellent! Each has something the other does not, making them complimentary to each other. The wonderfully inexpensive, genius stop-motion monsters are a tribute to Ray Harryhausen by college kids who made a movie for well under $10,000! The plots of both versions are basically the same, w/ some different editing and characters (Asmodeus) thrown in. While the '70 version (EQUINOX) is a bit snappier, it doesn't include the Frank Bonner transformation scene from the original! So, watching both films was a must (at least for me). The second disc is packed w/ extra-extras, like short films, test footage, etc. If you are a general horror maniac, a fan of stop-motion, or just enjoy grim stories w/ cool monsters, then this belongs on your shelf...",1264464000,,1397,4.776859504132231

2553085,5,B000F6IHTA,"Truly one of my favorite guilty pleasures, this collaboration by Dennis Muren and Jim Danforth before they became anybody at all hardly seems worthy of the Criterion treatment, but who am I to say?  It's fun to see both the theatrical version and the little-viewed original film side by side--I can't say which I am partial to, having grown up with Jack Woods' rendering, but the original flick certainly has its rough charm, and it's hard to say whether or not Woods actually ""improved"" it.  The thing was made for about $6500, features Frank Bonner way before WKRP, filmed in Bronson Canyon (take yer pick from a multitude of cheap horror flicks from 1950 on), highlighted by some imaginative early SF efforts by Muren and Danforth; there is a love-hate audience for this thing, some who worship and others who just don't get the hype.  It took several summers to make, hairdos change back and forth, the acting is atrocious, the story could occupy maybe a paragraph--and yet it is one of my favorite films. If you are looking for intellect or DEEP MEANING, look elsewhere; instead grab a beer and a bag of peanuts and pop this one in and put your mind in neutral.  Classic fun at the movies.  One question: Why was Skip Shimer's voice dubbed over in Woods' version?  Maybe I missed this in the commentary.  Can anybody tell me?",1261008000,2,1330,4.6581196581196584
2553086,3,B000F6IHTA,"This is the movie that inspired the Evil Dead. This movie has some great monsters and demons brought to Earth via Necronomicon passages. This one has all sorts of beast, I liked the flying Red Demon , but there are other 2 legged and 4 legged monsters. Jim Danforth did the effects. This has gotten a well deserved reputation for being a great cult film. It is a fun B movie, but it is really well done. This DVD was one of the biggest hits from Criterion when it came out - it contains 2 versions of the movie. I will say the original version from 1967 is way better with more monsters,better continuity, and a better pace, call it a stronger movie than when they reshot it for the 1971 re-release. The other version is the more common version with scenes re-shot over the course of 4 years, contained a devilish character called Asmodeus and just all sorts of wild edits and you can see the characters get older,younger & older again. This is a low budget movie, not an all time classic,but certainly a popular cult monster movie. It was originally released in a huge ""big Box"" VHS from Wizard video,under Equinox and later the Beast. It is better & more fun to watch than the Day Time Ended and other Charles Band movies. It is also fun to watch both and see the differences between the 2 versions of Equinox. Most of us like the original version better. Like monsters ?  Like some camp to it ? Like stop motion ?

This movie was way more entertaining than I figured it would have been...

This set is amazing...with both versions of the film (including the previously unreleased original cut) and a short film...as well as featurettes and commentary, and lots more...

2553089,3,B000F6IHTA,"This movie could almost be considered a best-of compilation of previously-discovered visual effects, cult film conceits, and camp. The story itself is reminiscent of old movies from Attack of the Gila Monster to Haxan, the imagery covers the world from Godzilla and King Kong to Vertigo, the themes include creepy castles, desert wastelands, and Satanism, and the characters run from one situation to another with careless abandon as they commentate on the very things that are happening to them with a weirdly analytical mindset. The movie precedes the career of its visual effects creator (who went on to work on Star Wars and Jurassic Park, to lend Equinox some credibility) and its plot foretells the later Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 of Sam Raimi. That said, it's not all that interesting.

Basically, a group of four kids go out to visit a professor friend of theirs, only to meet with horrors involving a Satanic book, a creepy park ranger, a kooky old geezer, and spectacular (and mostly claymation) monsters. By today's standards, it's a pretty slow movie as it pretty much doesn't mind taking the time to let the camera linger on the special effects or, worse, on the dialog. There's an interesting sub-theme about religious symbols as a sort of metaphysical chemistry, and for what it's worth the characters are a lot more aware and intelligent than most horror film fodder. Unfortunately, that only gets the movie so far, as its creativity still serves a ridiculous premise that is, to most b-horror film buffs, all too familiar. In that way, it really is like listening to a best-of CD of a certain era or sensibility: you've heard it all too often before and the real joys are more often on the lesser known works.

2553090,5,B000F6IHTA,"When I decided to review EQUINOX in its Criterion release I was all hyped up and ready to go. I should have done it then rather than wait until The next day. Why? Because on that morning I learned the sad news of Stan Winston's death at the relatively young age of 62. For those of you who might not know (and why are you reading a review of this type of film if you don't know who he is?)Stan Winston is/was the Academy Award winning special effects genius extraordinarie who thrilled you with JURASSIC PARK, WAR OF THE WORLDS, CONSTANTINE,the latest INDIANA JONES flick and countless other classic films of the genre for the last 20 years, including one of my favorites PUMPKINHEAD, which was also his directorial debut. His death marks the beginning of the end of an era, and its just to sad to even contemplate. Winston had nothing whatsoever to do with the making of EQUINOX but he shared the same spiritual fathers as the kids who produced this film, namely; Willis O'Brien and Marcel Delgado the men who gave life to the original KING KONG and Ray Harryhausen who created the 7th VOYAGE OF SINBAD, JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, et.al.

O'Brien and Harryhausen were probably every bit as much of an inspiration to a young Stan Winston as were to the young creators of EQUINOX who, in 1967 when the film was finally sold to Jack Harris for distribution were still in their teens. Things were so much different then. Thanks in a very large part to Forry Ackerman and the Super 8 camera kids really could make their own monsters and their own movies and then maybe even have them featured in a national magazine for others to see! And if you weren't into film production, well, you could print your own fanzine. Heck, anybody could do that! And just about everybody did. This is the wotld that spawned the likes of Stephen Spielberg, Stephen King, George Lucas, and namesless nerds without end who happily spent every waking hour with their friends either talking about monster movies or actually trying to make them. Eager little geeks bent over hand-sculpted models of dinosaurs that they moved ever so slightly and then tried to capture on a single frame of film with a cameras that simple weren't equipped with that capability yet. Didn't matter thought, they kept trying. Why? Because they were in love. In love with monsters, in love with movies, in love with the process of making movies and nothing could stop them.

As it turned out nothing did stop the guys who created EQUINOX--Mark McGee who wrote the original story has a career as a sometimes actor, author, and screenwriter today and is best known as a scholar of ""psychotronic cinema."" Jim Danforth who did the matte paintings was already a fairly well established effects man. David Allen (who died sadly died of cancer in 1999) co-directed as well as working on the effects, and later became a very well respected effects man. His career was decidedly at odds with Dennis Muren's. Allen perferred working on low budget projects because he felt it gave him more creative control He also chose to stay with the kind of work that allowed him to have a hands' on approach. Dennis Muren, on the other hand, is the most successful of the group. After EQUINOX he went to work on STAR WARS. Today he is Supervisor of Visual Special Effects at Industrial Light and Magic, has nine Academy Awards, and a star of his own on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Some  AMAZON reviewers have been puzzled as to why Criterion has given this films the big treatment. Others seem to actually be angry about it, while still others regard the film as ""cheesy."" I think Dennis Muren's connection with the film alone makes it significant in cinematic history. While making this film Muren actually developed a camera/effects trick betweeen classes in school that PREDATED one that excited the film community when it was used well over a year later in 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY! Its actually a very technically accomplished film, but since it didn't have more than a $6,500 BUDGET let's just call it cheesy and go and see CATWOMAN again. That had a nice big budget.

I'm a low budget fan, nothing puts me off faster than a big budget flick with hype to match. Now that doesn't mean that I'm looking for camp or so-bad-its-good flix to ridicule, because I'm not. I've never laughed once at EQUINOX. (I'll admit to smiling once or twice at the cute little octopoidal monster that demolishes the Professor's cabin.) I just prefer movies where I feel that everyone connected with the film is doing everything they can to make the movie work. That's not the feeling I get with a big budget, high-concept, Computer Generated everyday piece of Hollywood trash. CGI in particular has been known to make me think violent thoughts. Its cold, sterile, and distracting. It constantly calls attention to itself in the worst possible manner--like your best friend's spoiled brat. While CGI has attained an undeniable level of techical proficency it has yet show creativity in any sense other than in problem solving. That's because the people at the keyboards are still just your average computer wiz with no real gift for making their creations relatable. There is no feeling of humanity in their work, nor is their any artistry or even any originality. (How many times are we going to see monsters that harken back to that image of the giant maw openning wider and wider from THE MUMMY? No originality!)

Give me a movie as good as EQUINOX any day of the week, one that's made with all the passionate exuberance of youth. I bet Stan Winston liked this one too.

By coincidence it popped up on a late-night horror movie show hosted by Philly's local Elvira knock-off, Stella(Karen Scioli) that came on after Saturday Night Live.  I found the film engaging but hadn't thought about in years until Criterion had the chutzpah to release it alongside their other masterworks.  The Criterion disc includes both the rough cut delivered by director Dennis Muren and the polished version that includes new footage shot by director Jack Woods.  Personally, I give both versions the pass.  Muren's version could have used some editing but you can't help to admire the teenager's inginuity that became apparent later in his special effects work.  Woods version fleshes out the story but remains true to Muren's intentions.

2553094,1,B000F6IHTA,"Equinox (Jack Woods, 1969)

Oh, my. Oh, my oh my. What on Earth were Criterion, long the bastion of great film in the DVD release world, thinking when they picked this one up for distribution? Yeah, you have a built-in cult audience thanks to fantasy god Fritz Leiber having a small role. And you'll probably pull in some film historians looking for uses of stop-motion claymation long after the fifties. But the average Criterion fan will (I fervently hope) look at this and have exactly the same reaction I did. It's painful.

The basics: An old professor (Leiber) summons two of his students, David Fielding (Edward Connell in his only screenrole) and Jim Hudson (WKRP in Cincinnati's Frank Bonner), to his remote mountain cabin. Jim decides to bring along his girlfriend, Vicki (Robin Christopher, who was also never in another movie), and they bring Susan (Barbara Hewitt, who was never... oh, you get the picture), a blind date for David. When they get to the cabin, they find it destroyed, and a rather suspicious-looking park ranger named Asmodeus (Jack Woods) hanging around. While looking for the professor, they stumble upon a cave, where they encounter a crazy old man who gives them an ancient book. In it, they find some of the Professor's notes, and eventually figure out that the Professor has unleashed something horrible, and that they have to stop it--if they can.

Not a terrible premise, and it presaged a lot of the Satanic Panic movies of the seventies, but bluntly, every one of them I've seen did it better. Yes, even The Devil's Rain. Everything about this movie is thoroughly terrible--bad acting, bad direction, special effects that look as if they cost no more than ten bucks a pop. I'm willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt and blame the bad lighting and the bad sound on degraded masters, at least. Still, this is only worthwhile if you're a huge fan of Satanic Panic movies, and even then, I'd save it for the bottom of the pile. *",1181433600,7,1975,4.7354651162790695

The original has an eerie music score, and if you can imagine a crossbreeding between HORROR HOTEL and JACK THE GIANT KILLER, then you're getting the picture (no pun intended). The remake/upgrade/whatever you wish to call it is quite good in its own way; Woods' portrayal of Asmodeus is psychotic. See both!

In fact, this is why I am giving it 4 stars - if it were just the movie I would give it 3. One really has to be a fan of the movie to purchase this edition, but it's well worth it.

2553098,5,B000F6IHTA,"EQUINOX was made by professionals (Jim Danforth) and semi-professionals in the mid 60s for a budget of something like $6500.  Dennis Muren later found an independent distributor, Jack Harris who bought it from him, shot extra scenes and released it to theaters and the career of special FX legend Dennis Muren was born.  Since it originated on 16mm, one would expect copies of the original film Muren shot to be hard to come by and they have been until now.  The fine folks at Voyager/Criterion Co. have given EQUINOX the best treatment a film like this could ever get.  First of all, print and transfer quality is the best you will ever see of this film.  Secondly, you get commentary by Muren, Mark McGee and Jim Danforth as well as Jack Harris and Jack Woods.  There are extras that are pure gold to stop-motion fans like the King Kong Volkswagon commercial done by the late, great Dave Allen.  There are also stop-motion tests done with the puppets that would appear in this film and stills, interviews and trailers.  It's a stop-motion fan's dream come true.

The original Evil Dead?  The original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""?  ""Panic from the Year Zero""?  ""The Tingler""?  There are so many horror (and sci-fi) films to choose from, many of them obscure and/or forgotten, that could of been dusted off  and given the always impressive (and expensive) Critereon treatment.  But by choosing films like Equinox or ""Fiend without a Face"", I feel the Criteron bunch are wasting their expensive bullets on titles that are probably best forgotten.  I understand that with Equinox there is some history and context to consider.  But is it enough to say that this film would influence the makers of the Evil Dead series?  That, to me, is less than a footnote - and I love the Evil Dead series.

On the good side of things, Equinox is never boring. It does have its mild, B movie charms - in a Mystery Science Theater sort of way.  You will find yourself taking the parts of the wisecracking robots about 5 minutes into the movie.  Jack Woods as the possessed park ranger, Asmodeus, is a drooling hoot.  The ""special""effects (complete with strings) are also pretty funny. The quality of the picture, given the film's budget basement history, is a minor miracle.

2553101,4,B000F6IHTA,"Including Equinox in the Criterion collection is gutsy but completely in keeping with the jazzy and independent nature of that company (has anyone noticed the inclusion of the lesser Fiend without a Face or the Warhol monster films??).  Many people are bemoaning the fact that some finer films have not received the Criterion treatment but Equinox does rest comfortably in the collection and not just for fans or hardcore completists.  It's good to also remember that the company often allows the producers to pick their own projects that they feel passionate about to lavish their attentions on, this creates an idiosyncratic but fascinating catalogue of films.

I had never heard of Equinox before Criterion put it out (although I had seen some stills of the Taurus monster from it) and I am not a Criterion completist and I really fell for this film. I watched both versions (the original and the theatrical release a very nice extra!!) within days of each other. The movie is a crude attempt at a horror/monster film but it is made with the passion of talented hardcore fans.  It hits all the cliches yet it has an irresistable naivete. I got a shiver of pleasure every time it pulled a monster or a photographic trick out of its hat (and there are a considerable number of tricks in this zero budget film that are impressive).  There is a wonderful can do spirit that hangs over this film both in its amateurish acting and its ingenious effects.

The filmmakers poured all of their passions into this little film and it shows.  In that way, this highly personal film is more at home in the Criterion Collection than the coldly calculated films of Michael Bay.  It also has an ambitious narrative arc that establishes a certain amount of tension that keeps you going through the first (and most tedious) part of the film.

 The film looks good and though the film stock obviously was in bad shape but still this master features nice deep colors and generally good contrast.  The extras are all great.  Including the afore mentioned two (and very different) cuts of the film each with its own commentary track.  Criterion explores the science fiction/horror fan base that fueled interest in film and special effects all through the sixties and seventies and gave rise to the current crop of effects wizards who are currently ubiquitous in the entertainment world and shines a light on early effects processes.  I especially enjoyed the tributes and examples of the animator David Allen's work.

A really, really cool release and I'm glad such a small personal work is included in the Criterion Collection.  This movie is about loving movies as much as any other release and allows Criterion to give tribute to a whole other group of filmmakers who have influenced cinema.",1154390400,20,2774,4.832980972515856
2553102,4,B000F6IHTA,"It's been a long while since I've watched the original 1967 cut of EQUINOX, and only then on a very poor-quality VHS, so it was a treat to watch it and the 1970 theatrical version more or less back-to-back on DVD. The release version is a bit more streamlined, though that doesn't necessarily mean polished. It's almost as crude as the original, but with a tightened structure that is sometimes an improvement, sometimes not. It's fascinating to see how the later-filmed scenes were blended with the original, and after viewing the 1967 version, they seem terribly obvious.

The Lovecraftian element of the movie is appealing, even though it was supposedly made without any direct knowledge of Lovecraft's work. The loneliness of the movie's setting and the script's gradual revealing of dark, forbidden things conjured by a magical book certainly hearken back to Lovecraft's most notable tales. And while many compare EQUINOX to THE EVIL DEAD, the two films are not all that similar -- though one gets the feeling that the former might have indeed inspired Sam Raimi.

EQUINOX is the perfect flick to bring back memories of the good old days of Saturday horror matinees and drive-in movies. If you've never seen it, it may leave you with a totally different impression than those of us who loved it when we were kids. In fact, you'll probably wonder what the hell the fuss is about. But in its way, it paved the way for a lot of modern H/F/SF cinema, and certainly put such talents as Dennis Muren and Jim Danforth on the celluloid map.

2553104,5,B000F6IHTA,"Ever since I saw pics in Famous Monsters magazines, I had always wondered when I'd get the chance to see it. I finally saw this movie in the early 80's when late night tv brought it to my living room screen and I could not stop watching this movie, even though vcr technology and poor reception at the time didn't give the best pic, but it was good enough.

I loved the story! I was always surprised as to WHY the 4 people would stay after seeing monsters and murder, but it works.......IN THE THEATRICAL VERSION.

The Muren version just was missing that extra to make the movie work, and make logic out of the characters behavior. While dubbed voices are amusing, they actually played it better and made more sense in the theatrical release, especially David's character. The real voice made him sound a lot less intelligent as a character, and Jim was the smarter of the two in the original movie.

In the theatrical release, Jim seems like he's following David's lead, as Dave deciphers the book, figures out WHO Asmodeus really is, and finds himself the remaining character till the end. David's voice over also sounds more concerned than the party guy image of the original.

I think the addition of Asmodeus enhanced the film. It was a bold move that in my mind, payed off and added something other than monsters popping up into the story. You actually had the source of pure evil in Asmodeus's character, and not just conjured up beasts trying to get the book.

The music was better also, and it added to the intesity of the situations. The original falls flat in many of the tense sequences because of the lack of musical buildup.

The extras are awesome and are as complete as one could want. Someone mentioned this movie deserving the cheapo sales treatment. I feel it got what it deserved. This is exactly what any fan of a movie could want. This movie is intended for film buffs, and many films packaged nowadays are for people who want the cheap thrill without any history on the film, because they don't need it or want it. Anyone interested in Equinox knows what they want, and this addition fills in the blanks that you knew where out there, such as the Muren original.

If you have ever been interested in this film, I'd say to buy it. The fact that it's two movies on disc 1, and disc 2 is jam packed with hours of material to watch and read through makes it worth the price of admission. Also, the smart shopper will find this title for closer to $25 than $35 if you look around.

I think anyone who could give less than 4 stars for this complete of a package never really was a fan. If you know the movie, how could you really expect much more than what you got when you opened the package in the mail?",1152057600,7,2722,4.43
2553105,4,B000F6IHTA,"Call them litmus tests. There are certain movies, TV shows, bands and books that, if you like them, make you a bit of a misfit. But, misfit or not, you LOVE them. You believe everybody should love them, but not everybody does. You want to be around other people who love them. If you try to turn other people on to these things, it goes one of two ways: A) They laugh and tell you how weird you are for liking this, or B)They love it too, and you have a friend for life.

The first reaction, unfortunately, is more common; that's the way this misfit business works. It can be heartbreaking, like the time you tried to get that happening girl to like the Cramps and she asked if you could play some Air Supply instead. But when you meet a fellow misfit? When you connect with that bent soul who understands the difference between Just Schlock and Transcendent Schlock? When you find that cute girl in the Ramones shirt who understands that three chords and lyrics about surfing are better than 50 chords and lyrics about wizards and demons? We're talking soulmate.

And speaking of demons, the new, two-disc set for ""Equinox"" is chock-full of 'em...and is about the best litmus test to come out this year for separating fellow misfits from the folks with whom you may need to reconsider your friendship. It's not that this is a good movie. By any reasonable standard, it's probably not good.

But ""Equinox"" sits among that rare class of films to which reasonable standards don't really apply, that place where good and bad collide head-on to create something that's fun, messy, amateurish, sloppy, inspiring and unforgettable all at the same time. Not everybody will like it, of course, for on the face of it, ""Equinox"" is nothing more than a cheap 60s horror flick. Cute girls. Bad acting. Plenty of monsters.

It's the 'plenty of monsters,' though, that makes this movie such a gas for all the misfits of the world. Monsters, after all, are the cornerstone of a REAL horror flick. None of this demented-guy-in-a-hockey-mask crap! Forget those monster-free Edgar Allan Poe flicks. I'll say this one time: with only a few notable exceptions, HORROR MOVIES ARE BETTER WHEN THEY HAVE MONSTERS. And, boy howdy, does ""Equinox"" have some good ones! There's the big reptillian gorilla thing. The flying demon. The Green Giant (though he sure looks blue to me). These were all created, of course, by Dennis Muren and friends, long before he would go on to win Oscars and work on SFX blockbusters such as ""Star Wars,"" ""The Abyss"" and countless others. For ""Equinox,"" Muren and company scraped together a few thousand bucks, made a few puppets and managed to shoot a minor classic in somebody's back yard. Talk about the DIY ethic!

But monsters without context do not a classic make! ""Equinox"" goes the 'professor-who-dabbled-in-things-beyond-his-comprehension' route to get the mayhem rolling. In this case, it's one Dr. Waterman who's gotten his hands on some ancient Satanic text and decided to give demon-conjuring a whirl. Not a smart move, but we wouldn't have horror flicks if characters didn't do monumentally stupid things now and then, so I'll have no complaints. Most of the movie is filled out with four California teenagers battling the monsters Dr. Waterman has stirred up, all the while trying to steer clear of the devil himself who arrives on the scene cleverly disguised as a park ranger.

Even if you're an ""Equinox"" lover, the movie itself is just part of the fun of this set. There are lots of short documentaries with oodles of info on the production. (Your reaction to the revelation of various SFX secrets will almost certainly be both ""God, that's cheap"" and ""Hey...these kids were pretty clever!)You also get tons of stills, commentary, and even the full, original version of the movie from 1967 before additional footage was shot for its theatrical release in 1970.

So go for the full-on ""Equinox"" litmus test. Have some people over for a screening. The folks who are glued to their seats as the closing credits roll are friends you'll treasure for life. And the ones who roll their eyes when the girl wants to go to Dr. Waterman's to get a Coke? The ones who say, ""I'm soooo sure"" when the devil shows up wearing a Smokey the Bear hat? Let them go, dear misfits. Just let them go.",1151539200,91,4300,4.748326639892905
2553106,5,B000F6IHTA,"The first time I saw this was just a couple of years after WKRP IN CINCINNATI went off of the air and I remember how cool I thought it was when I saw that Bonner, the guy who played HERB on WRKP was one of the main actors in this film. They eat Kentucky Friend Chicken and I think it's funny that they don't recognise the name MISTER ASMODEUS. At the time that I rented the film I was a teenager and played a game called DUNGEONS & DRAGONS and in that game ASMODEUS is a devil which made it seem funny to me that the park ranger had such an obvious name. I love the stop motioin animation. The ""APE"" is my favorite with the flying devil as a close second. The bad acting is what makes this film so cool. It's definately one of those 'so bad it's good' movies.",1151366400,4,759,4.0
2553107,5,B000F6IHTA,"After almost 4 years we finally have Criterion's DVD release of Equinox.

Dennis Muren & friends ambitious home brewed 16mm special effects showcase that was later revamped and expanded for theatrical release by Schlockmeister Jack Harris & director Jack Woods. We are treated to both the the 1970 theatrical release and Dennis Muren's original 1967 (My favorite) version of the film.

As a huge fan of the film I'm extremely pleased with Criterion's treatment of the film. Especially, the very generous bonus material featured on the second disc. For me it's literally a dream come true.

I'd  personally like to thank Brock DeShane, the Criterion folks as well as everyone involved in producing these discs.

I'll be the first to admit that Equinox as a whole isn't a great film, the SPFX are where it shines. It was a huge inspiration to me years ago as an aspiring animator/filmmaker. It's the ultimate home movie. The story behind it's making is almost more important than the film itself. It's a great example what can be done with very limited resources and a lot of talent and imagination.

I give the DVD a 5 star rating purely on it's overall presentation. The extra's are outstanding! While the film itself I'll grant 3 stars.

I do highly recommend this DVD set to fans of the film. It's a huge upgrade from the bootlegs that have been floating around on eBay the last few years.",1151366400,6,1391,4.746887966804979
2553108,5,B000F6IHTA,"This is one of the best ""do it yourself"" low buget movies of all time!

 Shot at a cost of $6,500, this movie is the best example of low

buget movie making there is. (with the exception of Night of the

Living Dead, that is.)

 I saw this film when I was 15. It was double billed with the

movie ""House of Dark Shadows"". That was back in the days when

movie theaters had only one screen. They would pair two movies together for one price! (a nice practice that I would like to

see come back!)

 Anyway House of Dark Shadows, (a movie version of the old afternoon horror soap opera)was suppose to be the scarry

movie. But Equinox frighten the ""H"" out me! I had nightmares for

weeks after seeing it.(my mother banned me from watching horror movies for two months!).

 I'm glad that this great movie has now been released on to dvd.

But I'm not so thrilled that its Criterion who is releasing the the film.

 While it will be given the first class treatment that it deserves by Criterion,

I frankly dislike the high prices Criterion charges for its dvds. $40.00 is a lot to spend for a two disc set.

 Such prices are more often reserved for boxed sets.

But if your're a real fan of classic B-movies. Then the price

is well worth it.",1151020800,8,1239,4.268398268398268
2553109,5,B000F6IHTA,"For anyone who has spent countless Sunday afternoons watching B-horror movies featuring the marvelous stop-motion animated creations by Ray Harryhausen on the Creature Double Feature, Equinox (1970) is a movie made for you. Quite simply, as Forrest J. Ackerman says in his introduction, it is a film made by teenagers, starring teenagers and for teenagers. Equinox was shot on a shoestring budget of only $6,500 and is a loving homage to stop-motion animated films like King Kong (1933) or those of Harryhausen. This film harkens back to the good ol' days when you could catch classic (and not so classic) B horror films on television. In short, it is a comfort movie for the horror fan.

The stop-motion animation is pretty good considering the non-existent budget. Equinox has that feel of a movie that was made by a bunch of friends on weekends. It is not the primitive, Harryhausen-esque creatures that are scary but the inspired performances of the old man in the cave and Asmodeus who are very unsettling in their own unique way.

Equinox has all the cheerful cheesiness of an Ed Wood movie complete with clunky dialogue and wooden performances and yet this is part of the film's low budget charm. So, what makes it worthy of its entry into the Criterion Collection? Well, aside from a notable appearance of Frank Bonner (who would go on to greater fame with the popular sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati) it is also the debut of Dennis Muren who helped out on the film's creature effects and co-directed. He would go on to considerable fame and fortune with his work on the Star Wars films.

The first disc kicks things off with a ""Video Introduction by Forrest J. Ackerman."" The legendary magazine editor gives Equinox an enthusiastic endorsement and conveys his undying love of B-horror and sci-fi movies.

There is an audio commentary for Equinox by director Jack Woods and producer Jack H. Harris. Both men provide a wealth of low-key insights into B-moviemaking.

Also included is a commentary for the original Equinox...A Journey Into the Supernatural by producer/co-director/effects technician Dennis Muren and writer/co-director Mark McGee. They look back with fondness at making this movie on a shoestring budget in what was clearly a labour of love.

The second disc begins with ""Monstrous Origins,"" a collection of outtakes and test footage of the actors waiting around or little bits that weren't used. Also included is a pretty funny pool party scene and very cool flying demon animation footage. There are also tests of a stop-motion puppet named Taurus escaping from a zoo and going on a rampage.

""Dennis Muren Interview"" sees this veteran effects technician talking about his life-long love of monster movies and special effects. He started making his own movies when he was a kid and praises Ackerman for his support and encouragement.

""Cast Interview"" features new interviews with cast members Frank Bonner, Barbara Hewitt and James Duron. They all talk about their experiences working on this movie with obvious fondness.

""Zorgon: The H-Bomb Beast from Hell"" is a 1972 short film shot by Kevin Fernan and features several Equinox alumni, including Mark McGee, Jim Danforth and David Allen with creature effects by a young Rick Baker. This is an amusing, funky homage to monster movies of the 1950s with lots of cheesy charm.

""David Allen Appreciation"" pays tribute to this legend of stop-motion animation that died in 1999. Included is a sample of rare work like a fairy tale called ""The Magic Treasure"" that is beautiful in its simplicity. There is also a commercial he did for Volkswagen that is a loving tribute to the original King Kong movie.

""Equiphemera"" is a collection of production stills, promotional art and many articles documenting the making of the movie.

Finally, there is a trailer (that proudly proclaims it being shot, ""In Supernatural Color"" and two radio spots.",1151020800,9,3906,5.020092735703246
2553110,5,B000F6IHTA,"Equinox is the story of the little film that could... and did. The story behind this film is probably far more interesting than the film itself and has been meticulously documented in both versions as released theatrically by producer Jack H. Harris and director Jack Woods and also Dennis Muren's original directorial cut The Equinox: A Journey Into the Supernatural (it's a travesty that George Lucas isn't giving both versions of his Star Wars films the same caliber of historical preservation). The fact that it was produced as a Criterion Collection release is a testament to the passion of the film makers and also its beloved fans. I never saw this film until my friend Brock DeShane, who contributed the essay included in the commemorative booklet and undoubtedly the biggest Equinox fan, showed me an old VHS copy. My immediate thought of it was pure low-budget amateur schlock, but as I watched it, I began to see the film's unique charm. It is Home Movie-making 101 at its finest and it was a film made by innocent and naive kids who were inspired by the legendary stop-motion special effects magic of pioneers Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen.

The truth is, Equinox would probably have not been released on DVD, if at all, and if it eventually did would have been given the minimalist movie-only Goodtimes treatment if not for Brock's valiant efforts whose passion and persistence helped to champion this film as a first-class Criterion release. The result is nothing short of an archival tribute to those whose careers this film had launched: Dennis Muren, the visual effects wizard behind Star Wars, Terminator 2 and The Abyss and the late David Allen whose stop-motion work on The Primevals remains unreleased to this day. Famous Monsters of Filmland editor Forrest J. Ackerman endorses the film with his warm acknowledgment of approval and provides the uncredited ""Voice on tape recorder"" and despite the forgiveably poor acting, Frank Bonner (credited as Frank Boers Jr.) at least went on to make a respectable name for himself with WKRP in Cincinnati.

It was two years ago that Brock and I were scratching our heads together over dinner wondering why Equinox had not been released on DVD which prompted him to get the ball rolling and the result has exceeded just about anyone's expectations with probably one of the most comprehensive Criterion Collections ever produced. Not even my Criterion DVD for Spartacus is as thorough and comprehensive as this. I simply must applaud the efforts of everyone involved in the production of this DVD for bringing Equinox out of the shadows of its forgotten purgatory and back into the spotlight so it can be preserved, admired, cherished, and yes.. even laughed at... for generations of film fans for years to come. Just as Equinox was inspired by the legends who pioneered the special effects of cinema, hopefully Equinox will live on to inspire young amateur film makers to pick up their cameras and craft their visions with whatever tools are at their disposal and innovate future generations of creative talent just as it may or may not have been directly influential to Sam Raimi and The Evil Dead, although the resemblance to which is unquestionably obvious. The stunning retro cover art by Tavis Coburn encapsulates the film's pulpy phantasmagorical essence. From the packaging to the presentation, Equinox is passion preserved in a keepsake DVD box (action figure not included).",1150761600,27,3448,5.015706806282722
2553111,5,B000F6IHTA,"When this movie was originally released, I saw it at the local theater with my older brother and his friends (I was only in single digits age-wise and it freaked the heck out of me). I've seen it recently and, while it's not hard for my adult self to recognize some bad acting, stilted dialog, and gaping illogicality in the plot line, there is still something genuinely bizarre about this film. It just feels like it was made in a different reality on some alternate, creepy astral plane... all of which is in danger of being blown when you recognize that one of the characters is Herb Tarlik of WKRP in Cincinatti fame! Still, I love it and will gladly plop down the money for this release. I remember being freaked out by the scary park ranger, and I certainly dig the blue giant and the winged devil-bat... great stuff! Cheers to Criterion for putting this out. They're sure to get some flak from the stuffed shirts who think that only subtitled art films should get the Criterion treatment, but I'm glad they ignored that contingent and decided to put out this truly unique little gem of a B-film.",1150675200,5,1102,4.542713567839196
