7904741,4,B000006QE5,"I showed this biography before reading The Hound of the Baskervilles with my lower-level freshmen.  They were having a hard time understanding that there really was no person named Sherlock Holmes who solved mysteries.  Even  with this bio clearly making the case that Sir Conan Doyle created Holmes, they still don't want to believe it.  Oh well...I really enjoyed the video!",1369267200,,376,5.114754098360656

7904743,5,B000006QE5,"Presented as an authentic biography of Sherlock Holmes -- with only occasional lapses to suggest anything less than historical accuracy -- the highlight of this program is footage from a BSI dinner at which David Burke reprised his role of Doctor Watson and regaled his dinner companions with stories of his years with Sherlock Holmes.

This same program is also available as a bonus feature on ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sherlock-Holmes-Collection/dp/B001TE6P78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sherlock Holmes Collection</a>,"" starring Peter Cushing.  That set gives you 5 BBC adaptations -- plus this same program -- so I'd recommend that collection to fans, instead of this stand-alone release.",1264464000,8,744,6.356435643564357
7904744,5,B000006QE5,"I have long been a fan of Sherlock Holmes, and long been a fan of the A&E Biography series.  I was surprised and delighted to find this production, and felt that it served to show the Sherlockian/Holmesian issue of the reality of Sherlock Holmes in its very existence -- A&E's Biography series rarely recounts the life of a fictional character.  Yet Sherlock Holmes has been a reality for many fans since the early stories appearing the Strand magazine more than a century ago.  Even despite the fact that 221B Baker Street, Holmes' upstairs lodgings with Mrs. Hudson, is also a fictional address, nonetheless the Royal Mail delivers cards and letters on a regular basis to the business that operates in the location where 221B Baker Street might be (and, depending upon the business located there, there is a desk and secretary charged with responding to the correspondence to Holmes and Watson).  There are a number of followers of Holmes who strive to put Holmes into real history - to locate the 'real' Holmes, as if all the stories were done in code, hiding the identity and actions of a real Holmes in the past.

This biographical sketch includes information about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the author of the stories, as well as figures who inspired him (most especially the Scottish doctor Joseph Bell, one of Conan Doyle's professors, who himself was an expert at observation and drawing conclusions on the basis of them).  It traces the development of Holmes through magazines and novels, then into radio, film, television and more.  Holmes now exists in cyberspace, in cartoons, in comic books, and, perhaps most ironic for the quintessential English character, in dozens of languages around the world.  Holmes inspires not only fans of mystery fiction, but also has inspired generations of law enforcement professionals who look to Holmes for investigation techniques and reasoning models.

Any fan of Holmes will love this biography, a video compilation or sampler of many of the highlights.  Those new to Holmes will find items of interest, and help put the stories in context, and perhaps help to explain the continuing appeal of Holmes as generations continue further and further from its Victorian origins.",1148860800,15,2220,5.024523160762943
7904745,5,B000006QE5,"At first, I was afraid to purchase this video, as I feared it might present some lame, cheesy actor to portray Sherlock Holmes.  Also, I knew nothing about its contents...but I have taken my risk, and am very glad that I did.
This 50 minute video features the remarkable David Burke, who starred as the first Dr. Watson in the Granada Television series opposite Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, playing his old role again as the good doctor in his later years.  This alone is good enough reason to purchase this item, but there are many more delightful features which adds to the quality of the film, including few film footages (with sound) of commentary by the Great Author himself, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  But I do not want to give away everything to take away from the unexpected delights you'll find in this video, so I'll keep my silence about the rest.  Just know that if you are a Sherlockian, you will definitely not be disappointed by this film.",1028592000,6,956,4.605882352941176
