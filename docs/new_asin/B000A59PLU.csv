2359271,4,B000A59PLU,"As far as animated Batman series go I much prefer the series that ran during the '90's on the WB rather than the current incarnation. In fact I've only seen a mere handful of the new series and just wasn't inspired enough to tune in for more.  Well, if this direct to DVD movie is anything to go by I may have to change that attitude.

I had no intention of buying this DVD (no really, I swear I didn't) but something made me take a chance on it while I was picking up the other Batman DVD releases on that fateful Tuesday afternoon.  Frankly I'm glad I did because ""Batman vs Dracula"" is really a dang good animated Batman adventure and a fine Halloween treat to boot.  Now I won't claim it to be perfect (because it isn't) but it is a more than decent direct to DVD release.

The story involves Joker and Penguin escaping from Arkham Asylum in search of a treasure hidden within the depths of Gotham Cemetary.  The Joker/Penguin alliance falls apart and it is the Penguin who stmbles not upon the treasure but the remains of Count Dracula himself.  In true Hammer film style Penguin accidently resurrects Dracula, becomes his thrall and the two begin to unleash a reign of terror upon Gotham City as the Count begins to transform its citizens into vampires.  The creation of these ""Lost Ones"" is blamed on the Dark Knight and he begins to realize he has more on his hands than the average maniacal super villain he usually has to contend with.  The irony of two individuals who use a bat as their avatar to achieve their ends is not lost upon Dracula (or the writers) and he soon sets out to destroy the Cowled One.  I won't go into any more of the plot, you get the general idea.  However I should point out that the writers have included a few more story threads and plot twists than what I've revealed here and thats what makes this film both enjoyable and a bit frustrating.  On the one hand there is more substance to the story than I would have expected for what is generally considered ""kiddie fare"" and while there are some good adult oriented story ideas and concepts they aren't always as fully explored as I would have liked.  Still, its hard to fault this film too much.  I can tell that the film makers were genuinely enthusiastic about the project and that really comes across in the final product more than any flaws and plot holes the film may have.

A word of warning to parents of small children.  This film does contain considerable amounts of blood and violence not to mention the sheer creepiness of many of the vampire scenes.  If you have little ones who are easily frightened you may want to pass on this particular Batman adventure.  When I say that the vampires are creepy I mean just that.  There were one or two moments when even this jaded horror movie junkie got a goosebump or two.  The sight of a vampire Joker lapping blood up off the floor (while not the creepiest scene in the film) is one I'll not get out of my head for awhile.

As for the DVD itself: the transfer is good and crisp and the sound is presented in Dolby 5.1.  No widescreen unfortunately.  A few meager extras such as the voice actors hamming it up, a science vs superstition segment, and trailers round out the supplemental features.

Bottom line: this isn't the greatest animated Batman yarn out there but it is a good thrill ride none the less.  It offers more substance than many films of its kind and will appeal to adults and older kids alike.  I can't reccomend it for sensitive younger viewers but for the older kids and adults who would like a good Batman Halloween treat you can't go wrong with this one.",1129680000,53,3618,4.419306184012067
2359272,5,B000A59PLU,"I was really excited when the series came out originally. I loved the original BTAS, and was pleasantly surprised with ""The Batman."" My wife and I have Saturday morning ""The Dude"" dates to watch the episodes together!

It was an extremely dark animation, and that is how it should be. To see what happens to the Joker is worth buying it alone.

GREAT MOVIE! It would make an incredible live action film. Think of it, it would be the perfect combination of ""Blade"" and ""Batman Begins!""",1129593600,,484,4.616279069767442
2359273,5,B000A59PLU,"This feature film is much better that the TV series it is based on. Some readers might not know that this film is not related to the original Batman: The Animated Series that ran from 1992 to 1998. This is a much more action driven series that focuses less on characters and more on fight scenes. These ideals translate into this new film. This DVD in not rated but if it did come with one it would be PG-13 due to the amount of action-violence, disturbing imagery, and blood. Yes, this movie is about Batman fighting the legendary Dracula so it's to be expected that there would be a lot on blood on screen but it is still shocking to see so much blood in this cartoon movie. The storyline borrows heavely from vampire movies of the past but it steals a lot of it's plot from the live-action Blade Trilogy. As a big Batman fan I must say it's impressive to see him go up against Dracula bat-to-back, so to speak. The animation is impressive to watch and the voice acting is very well accomplished. I'm glad the Batman legacy in being upheld by this film and the excelent live action Batman Begins.",1129593600,3,1098,4.387254901960785
2359274,3,B000A59PLU,"Honestly I watched all of the movies based off of the animated series and I have got to say that they started to go down hill after Mask of the Phantasm. I did like the Batman Beyodn Joker's Return, though. I would like to give this one a chance, although, after watching the Mystery of the Batwoman I thought that they royally screwed up. The story was blanned and the voice acting was only so-so. I am hoping that they do a better job with this one. I like the 90's version of the animated Batman.",1128816000,,499,4.208333333333333

2359292,5,B000A59PLU,"One of the most underrated and underappreciated animated movies that DC has ever pushed out, ""The Batman vs Dracula"" delivers on the goods and leaves you very well satisfied.

This movie is awesome with its visuals, dark tone, and overall atmosphere. *WARNING* not recommended for younger viewers without parental guidance due to its scary visuals, violent situations, and a few scenes with more blood than thought necessary.

Plot summed up quickly: Dracula is woken up by The Penguin (on accident) and decides to make Gotham City his new kingdom as The Batman tries to figure out a way to stop him and cure all the innocents that have been transformed into vampires.

This movie follows the mid 2000s series ""The Batman"", which I recommend watching as well. My main complaint with the series as a whole is some of the character designs and Mr. Freeze's backstory ruins his character story. But once you look past that it's a truly wonderful series. Everything that was awesome in the series is definitely present in this movie, which takes place somewhere between seasons 1 and 3. You have the flashy movements, well animated action, fantastic voice acting as well, but since this is an unrated animated feature they were able to up the anty a bit and add very nice visuals with the vampire minions, lots of neck biting, and a nice touch with when they use darkness in this film.

My recommendation for watching this is if you get a chance switch your tv's video setting to monochrome and enjoy this as a black and white film, you will be pleasantly surprised.",1472515200,2,1562,4.774074074074074

2359312,1,B000A59PLU,"I will admit right now that I have some (negative) bias towards DC and this cartoon generation of Batman, so you are free to take my review with a grain of salt if you feel like you must.

Everything is wrong with this movie - from the nonexistant plot (I am to understand this was supposed to be based on a good comic book arc - however I have not red it) in which Dracula's coffin is for whatever reason ""relocated"" to Gotham City to the odd continuity problems (Why did Penguin end up in Arkham Asylum with the Joker?); Also, Robin and Batgirl are not in this movie either.

*Spoiler Alert*

In the movie Dracula for some reason needs a human to guard him during the day, which ends up being Penguin for some odd-ball reason instead of someone that isn't incompetent, although Joker is turned into a vampire.

Dracula's plan is simply to turn the world into vampires - and apparently he has no plan on what to do as far as sustenance once everyone in the world is a vampire - but before he does that, he wants to reincarnate his wife whose body was turned into ash. For whatever reason (even though his wife would take the shape of her old self) the only person he deems a worthy vessel for her soul is Vicki Vale - with no real explanation as to why.

The movie will end just as you think it should - Batman cures vampireism using the joker as test subject; And Dracula is defeated using his ""only"" weakness, sunlight...which he gets immolated from no where else but the BATCAVE (which is underground non the less).

I very much disliked the entire series of ""The Batman"" - however I think if they made this movie follow the non stupid series that succeeded it (Beware the Batman), I think I might have found it a decent movie.

I'd only recommend this film to viewers that liked ""The Batman"" or kids below 10 years old; I don't think any other demographic would find it very interesting.",1436832000,,1892,4.373219373219373

In all honesty, I can understand why this movie wouldn't be for everyone, but I say give it a watch. Its worth a viewing at least once. I'm glad I got this.

2359359,3,B000A59PLU,"This was a made-for-video feature, and the only animated extension of the early 2000's series, The Batman. Running for five seasons, this was helmed by some of the creators of Jackie Chan Adventures, which helped add a lot more physical action to the Batman animated history. This was also somewhat inspired a trilogy of DC Comics' Elseworlds comics beginning with Batman: Red Rain where modern day Batman has to stop the king of the vampires.

Set sometime probably before Season 3 of The Batman TV series, Joker and Penguin break out of Arkham Asylum each on their own to find a lost mafia treasure buried somewhere in Gotham Cemetery. Batman stops Joker who seems to die, while Penguin uncovers a tomb in the cemetery that happens to house none other than the dried up corpse of the actual Dracula. Apparently, after he was defeated by ticked-off peasants centuries ago, instead of just throwing his body into a volcano or exposing it sunlight, the went through all the trouble of locking him up in an iron coffin and sending it all the way from Europe to Gotham City as American was colonized. Penguin accidently gets some of his blood conveniently dropped into Dracula's husk which revives him, and he hypnotizes Pengie into being his personal Renfield. Drac begins to feed off Gothamites, thus turning them into ghoulish vampires too, and the police blame Batman as the one for the disappearances for these ""Lost Ones"". Dracula also sets his sights on Vicki Vale, who here makes her first animated appearance, as Vicki herself is trying to become Bruce Wayne's love interest. Joker comes back, and Drac changes him into a vampire, only to get later captured by Batman and taken back to the Batcave so he can use him as a guinea pig for an anti-vampire cure. Batman finally creates a vampire vaccine, and tracks Dracula to the cemetery to turn his army of darkness back to normal. Bats then baits Drac underground to the Batcave, and uses a special solar generator to disintegrate him. This frees Penguin from Dracula's control, who ends up taking the rap for all the missing persons in Gotham, thus freeing Batman of any blame.

This was a decent outing for The Batman storyline, even though its possible to have done it without Joker or Penguin who are just there to pad out the movie. The addition of Vicki Vale was okay, even though she ends up having no appearances again after this movie, similar to Detective Yin from the first two seasons of the show who was built up to be a reoccurring character and ally to Batman and was just dropped after Batgirl was added to the roster. The animation was slightly above that on the TV show, although it could have used a better soundtrack than all the damn guitar strumming that they use in every damn scene. This movie was brought up in a single issue of The Batman Strikes spinoff comic that takes place during the movie. It's worth downloading, or at least maybe in one of the double-feature DVD sets which include other Batman animated movies.",1421971200,,3000,4.712380952380952

2359396,3,B000A59PLU,"This film is only o.k. and not more than that. The drawing was crude and unsatisfactory, based on The Batman TV series from 2005 (which I never liked). Voice cast is from The Batman TV series, not Batman The Animated Series of the 1990s, which is a disappointment. No one else can do The Joker like Mark Hamil. I miss him as The Joker. This film does have Tara Strong as Vicki Vale--she used to do Batgirl in the 1990s series. The film has extras with directors, producers, actors discussing the movie and the characters. The extra features were few in number, but useful.
  The Penguin (Tom Kenny) resurrects Dracula, who for some reason is buried in Gotham City's cemetery. Penguin becomes his manservant as Dracula vampirizes the city. The lost ones become vampires (who resemble zombies here). Bruce (Rino Romano) has to figure out how to cure the humans, which has to do with creating a serum that changes them back That part was interesting. But defeating Dracula takes several tries, with several failures. Finally Batman uses his artificial solar projector to defeat Dracula. Just flash the sun on him. Vampire movies have repeatedly shown that ultraviolet light destroys vampires. Bruce should have figured that out in the beginning.
  The film includes the character Carmilla Karnstein as the bride of Dracula, which has been done in many other vampire films. So the conflation of Le Fanu's Carmilla with Stoker's Dracula has been done before. Boring. I found the film to be slow, and crudely drawn, and lacking in originality. Fans of vampire films will find nothing new here. I was especially irritated by their rendering of The Joker--too grotesque and are you kidding me? But the producers said they wanted to see what would happen if The Joker became a vampire. And, the best part was that Batman captured the vampirized Joker and used him as a guinea pig to find the cure. He had to cure The Joker first before he could cure the rest of the people. Lots of fighting--with deliberate parallels between Batman and Dracula are drawn--even to how they got around Gotham City by catacombs.
  on the whole a mediocre movie--not as good as some other Batman films (such as Mask of the Phantasm, which was much better, in fact SubZero was better than this)",1399939200,,2264,4.792307692307692

2359460,2,B000A59PLU,"The Batman vs. Dracula is unfortunately neither a well drawn cartoon, nor a good story. Let me say first that I do like many cartoons based on various comics. I am not against animation. But The Batman vs. Dracula is just poor quality and awkward all over the place.
Bruce Wayne's appearance is very strange and alien. He is almost a caricature. Crooked nose, strange face. To it this kind of art is simply doing a disservice to the DC comics. This is the case with other characters in this movie as well. Worst of all is the depiction of the Joker. He is simply an entirely different character in this movie. He walks without shoes sits in a pose of a caveman, slouching, doing all sorts of crazy acrobatics, and he is dumb. It was just very unpleasant to see such character deformation in Batman vs. Dracula.

The plot also, seems to have been created either for the youngest of viewers or for some limited audience. It is incredibly cliche. The dialogue is just too simplistic and sounds like saturday morning cartoon for younger audiences. Pretty much from the start and throughout the movie you know what is happening as the characters explain every thing they are about to do, why, where. It is almost as if they are aware kids are watching and have to explain so people do not get lost.

Basically I'd say, while The Batman vs. Dracula is watchable, it is not a pleasant experience most of the DC universe cartoons are. I would watch everything else available and watch this only as the very last resort.",1388793600,,1511,4.551470588235294

2359462,4,B000A59PLU,"Truth be told, the story was solid enough that it really didn't need the Joker or Penguin. They could have been replaced with any character and still this would have been a great story! I think and even better one!  I was really taken by how the writers explored the metaphorical similarities between the characters and their somewhat synergetic mythos. This could have been a great live action movie. The treasure sub plot wasn't necessary and I think it took away from the Vickie, Batman, Dracula triangle. I don't necessarily mind the Dracula in Gotham idea but it wasn't unreasonable for Bruce Wayne to have traveled to Transylvania either for some scientific or charitable reason. So many things could have been explored by dropping all of the Joker / Penguin scenes and spending more time on Dracula and Batman. Anyway, there are plenty of reviews that tell what happened in the story I just wanted to spend some time on what direction I would have taken as a comic book writer.",1388102400,,984,4.754385964912281

Having said all that, and having stripped you of some pride, you MIGHT be able to approach this cinematic take on Batman with a little bit better attitude. It's a good film. The animation is fantastic, and the story is really well done. I feel this is film is the HIGHLIGHT of ""the Batman"" series. I, for one, enjoyed ""the Batman"" series for what it was. I did not try to compare it to anything or feel that it violated any coveted rules about who Batman is as a character. As I said, people take this stuff too seriously. Guess what happens when ""they"" ""violate"" what Batman is? They always return to form. So how is a departure a bad thing? And really, why are we looking at comics to remain rigid?

2359660,4,B000A59PLU,"I am someone who has never fond of Warner Bros. The Batman.  It just always struck me as trying too hard to be different from the classic DC Animated Universe incarnation of the character, never knowing whether to be serious or silly- but one thing was for sure, and that's that the show produced lots of ideas that lent themselves to merchandising. In all honesty it was an okay superhero cartoon, but it seldom felt like Batman to me.  An occasional episode would pop up which did a good job of capturing the spirit of the character, but for the most part the series came across as being more style over substance.

Now that brings us to The Batman's straight to TV/DVD movie- a feature which boasts a title I never thought I'd see taken seriously outside of a Silver Age comic: The Batman versus Dracula.  And...It's actually a remarkably well made piece.  It isn't a great animated feature on the levels of Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, or Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, nor does adding Dracula to the Batman universe really add anything, but what The Batman versus Dracula does do is successfully focus on what works in its animated series while shaving off most of its weaknesses.

The movie was of course produced solely for the novelty of pitting the Dark Knight against the Prince of Darkness, but the team behind it does give it their all and creates a solid action film out of what could have easily been a cheesy Halloween special for the series.  Dracula is treated as a serious villain, and even given a healthy dose of character.  I like how the Count takes an interest in Batman as a fellow creature of the night.  Sure, it ultimately ends in a typical superhero versus super villain style fight, but at least they did treat the Count with the respect he deserves.

I have been critical of The Batman, and still stand by many of my gripes with the series, but that shouldn't impact your enjoyment of this movie.  Yes, the Joker shouldn't look like a monkey, yes Tom Kenny's voice work as the Penguin can be grating at times, and it isn't nearly as strong as the Bruce Timm/Paul Dini helmed series from the 1990s.  But, what The Batman vs. Dracula does give the viewer is the best of what this incarnation of the Dark Knight has to offer. If you, like myself, aren't a fan of The Batman's take on this universe this movie won't change your mind.

For what it is I thoroughly enjoyed The Batman vs. Dracula and would recommend it to any fans of the character or animation.  Odds are, even if you're not a fan of The Batman, you'll find yourself thoroughly enjoying this action packed face off.",1341532800,,2612,4.518046709129512
2359661,5,B000A59PLU,"(Continued from my reviews on The Batman - The Complete Season One & The Batman - The Complete Season Two)

I made ""vs. Dracula"" the third part of my review progression on The Batman, simply because as I watched through the series, I watched it between the second and third seasons. Chronologically, that is where it seemed to fit best. Realistically, it was released to DVD, and subsequently aired, a few episodes into Season Three, though it also could have fit between the first two seasons or anytime during Season Two.

To keep with the comparing to B:TAS, it's no Mask Of The Phantasm or Return Of The Joker (Batman Beyond), but I really enjoyed this DTV movie. Perhaps, I'm slightly biased, as I like stories about vampires. Because there was more time for story development, it has that advantage over any episode of the series, even the two-parters, though I did feel the plot dragging in places. Another thing it has in its favor is, though it aired on TV, it was still DTV and took some liberty in being unrated here in the States. That helps when trying to satisfy an older audience, though I think some of the content is a little much for the 7 year old plus crowd I referred to in my review on Season One.

Besides the obvious main villain, The Joker and Penguin are also featured in this film. It also contains Vicki Vale's only prominent animated appearance. (After this was released, she made small ""cameos"" in the DCUAOMs Superman/Batman: Apocalypse and Batman: Year One). When it is revealed how Dracula ever came to be in Gotham, it is very conceivable. As I touched on briefly in my review of Season One, gadgets, and the science behind them, are a major part of the whole series, especially early on. That being said, science plays a major role in The Batman's treatment of the circumstances at hand, which always makes a good vampire story better, in my opinion.

In summary, this was one of the highest points of the series, though there have definitely been some stand out episodes that are up there, too. I rate all the seasons at 4 stars, simply because you have to take 13 episodes at once. Truly, some episodes are fives and some I rate less than four. If you only watch one item from this series, this movie is what I would suggest. If I had not liked what I had seen so far, this film would make me go back and try it out again. Again, the little bat-tikes might need to be some years older before watching ""vs. Dracula,"" but it's sure to appease the older fans.",1330473600,4,2493,4.496688741721854

Excellent flick, and while its not quite one one might expect if one follows the dark night animated series (such as the new justice league from 2006 and such OR the original batman from 1999 < before it became 'batman and robin' for a while), but its more of stepping into a movie tie in with the ""The Batman"" new series.  The joker isn't what he was, nor is the penguine ( again, these are re-envishionings of the original characters and such) but I honestly think that when the joker is turned, he becomes even MORE enjoyable.. and personally, I am impressed that he's insanely clever that when he goes hunting for blood, the first place he hits is a BLOODBANK.. no more corpses or such.. but hundreds of gallons of blood at his whim.  definetly doesn't leave an easy trail for authorities.

2359671,4,B000A59PLU,"This animated film is thoroughly a product of The Batman television series.  The greater your familiarity with this particular Batman and his style, the greater your enjoyment of this animated feature will be.  Batman vs. Dracula begins with the untimely death of the Joker.  Left without his nemesis, Batman is exceptionally brooding.  But when people start disappearing and the culprit is a recently awakened Count Dracula, the Dark Knight finds himself completely outclassed by a phantom of the night much more powerful than himself.  With Dracula amassing an army of the undead, Batman certainly has his work cut out for him.

Batman vs. Dracula deftly explores the connections and similarities between the Prince of Darkness and the Dark Knight.  This supernatural enemy provides a great challenge for Batman, as if Bruce Wayne is confronted with ""the terror of the night"" Batman seeks to embody.  As Dracula himself says, ""Thanks for keeping the legend alive, Batman.""

Batman vs. Dracula features some great action, music, acting, and artwork that I've come to appreciate through The Batman television series.  I highly recommended this for Batman fans, and definitely a must-see for fans of the show.",1278720000,,1208,5.244791666666667

We weren't disappointed. Predictable and hazyplot, yes (Dracula doesn't seem too surprised to wake up in a modern city nowhere near Transylvania), but also excellent animation, some awesome, atmospheric music and a really cool Batman, and even more awesome Joker. This is a movie that teens will really enjoy, I guess (my roommate and I both agreed we'd have absolutely adored this movie if we had been thirteen!). This is also rather gory for a Batman movie which is to be expected but most of the vampire attacks are not shown directly (the camera zooms to a view of the Gotham skyline while the screams die off, or else quickly switches to a shadow on a nearby wall, of Dracula feasting on his victim).

In all, a movie for fans and teens. Fans may want to know that this movie features the Jerry Maguire line ""You complete me"" between Batman and Joker that was used to great effect in the Dark Knight.

2359723,5,B000A59PLU,"In all honesty, I figured the plot for The Batman vs Dracula would be a bit farfetched and unbelievable but, much to my surprise, it was anything but. It's much more Mature and adult-oriented, in my opinion. The story begins with Penguin finding out about a treasure that was buried in a Gotham Cemetary. Only the Joker knows of the treasure as well. Yet, while Joker is squaring off against The Batman, Penguin finds its' whereabouts. Unknowingly, Penguin cuts his hand on his umbrella and brings Dracula back to life. Soon thereafter, Penguin becomes a slave to the Prince of Darkness &, in no time at all, Gotham's Denizens starts becoming an army of the undead for Dracula. Heck, The Joker even becomes one. Vicky Vale, Bruce's love interest, figures in there as well. From that point on, it's a race for The Batman to come up with a solution to the problem and face off against Dracula.

Rino Romano, Alastair Duncan, Peter Stomare all do amazing voicework in this feature-length animated film.

2359724,3,B000A59PLU,"So here's The Batman's first attempt at a stand alone feature length movie,  and while it is no Phantasm (arguably the best animated Batman movie ever), it doesn't fall flat on its face either.  It actually raises the bar for the series and the tone is consistently dark throughout.  I let a lot of the things that bothered me slide (still can't get used to the new Joker, Penguin designs/voices)  and just enjoyed the movie on its own merit.

Citizens of Gotham go missing whom the media have dubbed ""The Lost Ones"".  Batman does his best to track them down, while getting attacked by vampires at night.  He knows what is responsible, but has to prove it, and by doing so, prove his innocence in the matter.  Dracula is a great villain and definitely worthy of Batman's skill.  Penguin and Joker also play supporting roles here but not to the point of outshining the titular villain.  I was a little dissapointed that Gordon didn't make an appearance but Alfred picks up the slack.  Vicky Vale also appears as Bruce's love interest/damsel in distress, but she's pleasant and voiced by Tara Strong (TNBA's Batgirl) so I didn't mind.

It's pretty predictable and I never once had any doubt how it would end, but it was fun while it lasted and the action between Batman and Dracula was well storyboarded.  I was a little surprised that they didn't really shy away from the violence as there is some decent blood gushing moments.  Also a bonus was that it was a solo Bat tale, so no sidekicks to steal his thunder.  A decent first outing for a ""The Batman"" feature.  If there's another, there's definitely room for improvement, but they could do a lot worse too.",1203379200,2,1659,4.610921501706485

Brilliant is up there with sub zero, superman batman movie but not mask of phantasm or return of the joker, but hey they were from the divine bruce timm batman, this is great fun though.

2359726,3,B000A59PLU,"Although it is rather serious in tone and deals with vampires and the undead, The Batman vs Dracula just seems to childish and too cartoony to be really effective. The color pallet is suitably drab and washed out and it does have a decent amount of atmosphere but I can't help but think that it could have been better if it just didn't seem toned down.

I prefer the 90s series of Batman, which had an overwhelming amount of darkness and Gothic pathos. This new THE Batman series appears to be reconfigured to appeal to kids who weren't even born in that decade. I know it's a clich to moan that animated shows were always better when my age-group were kids, but it's so true.

The Penguin and The Joker (now looking like a cross between Krusty the Clown and The Predator) escape from Arkham (there's something new) and make their way to a hidden treasure trove in the cemetery. But the bird stumbles upon Dracula's tomb (why he is in Gotham is not explained) and resurrects him by accident.

But The Batman doesn't approve of a Vampireman stalking his streets and a drawn-out conflict with a predictable and hokey ending fills up the rest of the movie. It's fun, it's entertaining, but it's just not the Batman I'm used to.

The DVD is in good looking 1.33:1 full frame with Dolby 5.1 sound and a fair amount of extras. But why, in an age of almost every household having a widescreen TV (be it HD or not), animated features such as this are STILL being transferred in full frame is beyond me. I am willing to be that BvsD was drawn and storyboarded in 1.78:1 widescreen. So why not give us an anamorphic transfer Warner?",1194480000,6,1622,4.469594594594595

Darkness blankets the city and the caped crusader is all who stands in the way between Dracula and the city's doom.

Wow. That was my first reaction when watching this. This direct-to-DVD release doesn't view as your standard Batman cartoon. This truly is a monster tale and views more like a horror movie than a superhero flick.

The vampires in this film are scary, looking like something between a vampire and a zombie. Dracula himself is neat, trim and suave, yet carries a presence of death.

This DVD also introduces Batman's love interest, Vicky Vale (who appeared both in the comics and in the 1989 movie). I have yet to discover how much of a role she will have in the half hour episodes of The Batman series (I have only watched up to season three), but it was great to see her on screen. It was also wonderful to see Bruce Wayne dealing with a female lead in a realistic way and having once again come face to face with Batman getting in the way of his personal life.

A surprising touch to this film was the Joker, not so much the character but what happens to him. Cool indeed.

This is a solid Bat flick, one which is meant for an older audience, definitely, not for kids. 13 or 14 and up, I'd say.

Batman vs Dracula is ""The Batman""s growing the beard moment.

I won't get into the details here, other already have.  But I will say this.  The Dracula of this episode is no mere plot device or one-dimensional monster. He is intelligent (he figures out who Batman is) and deadly.  This not a troubled Gary Oldman Dracula, sexy Frank Langella, or a scene chewing Rudolf Martin, this is an aristocrat returned to see an usurper to his throne and deals with him accordingly.",1178582400,2,668,4.773913043478261
2359752,4,B000A59PLU,"Summary: It's a typical night for Batman: when Penguin and Joker escape Arkham, he tries to capture and bring them back. Well...not this time. In his attempt to get the badguys, he watches as Joker plumits to his doom, while the Penguin stumbles across an odd gravestone which he believes contains valuable treasure -- WRONG! Unfortunately for Penguin, he happens to unleash the vampire lord, Dracula, onto to Gotham City. Now Batman has his hands full from keeping the city from turning into vampires -- all the while -- trying to keep his date, Vicky Vale, from falling into the wrong hands.

My Opinion: This definetely isn't your average Batman movie to watch, and even though (like the rest of The Batman episodes) it has great animation, but the story could use a little tweaking. I mean -- come on, Dracula just 'happens' to be in Gotham City, New York? That just seems a little too coincidental, if you ask me. It would make more sense if Batman had to go to Transylvania for some reason (like on a mission/bussines, or something like that).

If this movie is supposed to be diverted towards younger children (like around 10 years), then they need to tone down the 'blood' content in this. Don't get me wrong, vampires are all about blood, but I think they showed it a little too much. For example, there is a scene where Batman fights off a vampire Joker at a blood bank. When Batman slams into a shelf of blood viles, the whole thing tilts to the side and starts pouring down on the walls -- and even Joker himself -- like some kind of waterfall; and you even witness the vampire Joker drinking it off the walls and floor -- now that's just gross!

The vampires, even Dracula, are down right creepy in this movie, so I do give credit to the animators on that one. What's also creepy, is the fact the vampires can see a human's 'heartbeat'...oh yes, that's creepy. What creeps me out the most in this movie is that vampire Joker. He's got to be the scariest vampire in the movie. If you thought he acted demented and weird in the regular cartoons, you're in for a big surprise when you watch this movie!

Overall: Even though I think the creators took some things a little too far in this movie, but overall, it's not a bad movie to watch (especially when it comes to be around Halloween)! This movie also brings out Bruce's/Batman's character a little more, like why he can't have a serious relationship with a woman.

Also, even though this is just my opinion, but I wish Joker was in it more (since I'm a big fan to the new animated Joker and all). Hopefully, the creators will think about doing a movie all about the newly animated Joker. Now I think that will be a movie worth seeing!",1174089600,,2698,4.486761710794298

That would have made more sense because he could face more danger with a gypsy and maybe a werewolf or too, an even zombies and more monsters.  I think that would have made more of an intensted storyline.  I love the idea of the joker becoming a vampire. Know wonder so many people are afraid of clowns lol. He looked really sick looking. The one part, I thought I got a really good kick out of what how they made Penquin was like Reinfield in the original Dracula story.

Another reason is that the new series just isn't as good as the classic 1990s version. Nevertheless, on a whim, I purchased this animated movie and, to my surprise, ended up enjoying it. The Batman meets his perfect adversarial foil in the sanguinary Count, who taunts our hero: ""Try as you may, you cannot out-bat me."" This version of the Caped Crusader might be younger and, therefore, not as experienced or battle tested, but the same intensity and obsessive brooding are present. Definitely, he broods more here than he does in his regular series. True, Rino Romano isn't Kevin Conroy, but there's an earnestness and a certain timbre in his voice that made me not be as critical as I might've been. By the same token, Kevin Michael Richardson isn't Mark Hamill, but I actually relished Richardson's different take on the demented Joker, whose latest incarnation here seems to be more formidable than ever.

The storyline: The Joker and the Penguin's escape from Arkham Asylum accidentally leads to the resurrection of Count Dracula. Soon thereafter, Gotham citizens, dubbed the ""lost ones,"" alarmingly begin to vanish. When the Batman investigates, he ends up clashing with the original bat-man, who then proceeds to convincingly stomp on him in their first tussle. Nevertheless, the Dark Knight is intent on not only defeating the master vampire but also on curing his infected victims. However, as the plague of vampirism continues to contaminate Gotham and the ranks of Dracula's children of the night swell, the Batman realizes that time is indeed drastically running out. But can his specially crafted arsenal of garlic bombs and antidote bullets save the night and Vicki Vale, on whom the Count's covetous eyes have set? And where do the Joker and the Penguin fit in all this bloody mess?

At 84 minutes, BATMAN VS. DRACULA is an eerie, atmospheric film which might prove to be too intense for the tots. There are moments rife with neck-sucking and visions of blood rampantly gushing, pouring, and dripping. But the more adult audience will find this dark adventure of the Batman to be diverting stuff. There are neat battle sequences between Drac and Bats somewhat done ala MATRIX style. These confrontations are executed in such a way that the viewer is made fully cognizant of just how vulnerable the Batman is and how precarious is his situation as he tries to hold his own against the supernaturally powerful Dracula, who can willfully disrupt the senses and move in a literal blur.

BATMAN VS. DRACULA is perfect Halloween fare; in fact, this dvd was released about two weeks before Halloween. The voice acting is good, if not stellar. The animation is decent, on par with the Batman's current series and is reminiscent of the JACKIE CHAN ADVENTURES, which isn't that surprising when you factor in artist/animator Jeff Matsuda, who had a hand in crafting both shows. Anyway, it's a pretty entertaining animated movie, and, based on my enjoyment of it, I just might have to give THE BATMAN another chance.",1164499200,9,3328,4.960573476702509

2359757,5,B000A59PLU,"It just sounds like a bad idea.  Anyone remember ""Scooby Doo Meets Batman""?  That was my attitude going in.  But I admit, I was wrong!  The Batman vs. Dracula is a first-rate animated adventure, and stays remarkably true to the character as envisioned in the somewhat underrated ""The Batman"" series.

I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but let's just say that the legendary count considers Batman as something of a kindred spirit.  I initially thought it seemed unnecessary to include the Joker and Penguin.  But their presence serves the story well, and makes for some fun AND creepy moments.  In fact, for a ""kid's movie,"" this gets pretty intense.

I know one criticism of the new series is that it tends to emphasize action over character development.  But when you see the superbly-paced first battle between Batman and Dracula, you'll be so caught up in the action that you may not have time to think about anything else.

All in all, a terrific effort.  I hope to see more feature-length adventures of THE Batman.",1155340800,3,1033,4.709497206703911

There is a big plot line that has to do with Dracula, which seemed ludicrous, but surprisingly turned out very well. It flew right into the story and gave a good introduction to Vicki Vale.

2359775,4,B000A59PLU,"The newest animated version of Batman has been put to the ultimate test. His own made for video feature.

If you haven't read what I said regarding this new dark knight animated series. I suggest you read my review of the first season of this new Batman. (Under The Batman - The Complete First Season (DC Comics Kids Collection). If you haven't the next paragraph  will be an abridged repeat of that.

 This new version of Batman year one is good animation . It is better than most of recent cartoons that is out there. This is a cartoon version of the film Batman Begins, it works in some ways and fails in others. This Batman may have the cave, the tools and the toys-but he is very green and still learning how to put it all together. The modern day non art demo of this cartoon works as well. The voice talent for this Batman is first rate. Now the BAD news, the animation of most of the Batman's arch-villains seem off in my opinion... too weird and strange from the classic Batman Mythos-the Comics of old. Remember this isn't your father's Batman

Now that we are up to speed of what I think of the new Batman. Lets tackle this Made for video DVD.

This pairings of the Dark Knights is a great feature, playing on their dark nature of Dracula  and Bruce Wayne's nativeness as the New Batman. The sub plots with Penguin and Joker mesh well in this story line. The ending came too pat and quick for me, I wished it left it open for an animated  sequel.

The voice work on this feature is great, not so Hollywood as Batman the Animated series made for DVD movie ""Secrets of the Batwoman.""  The  Animation is interesting and works on many levels. It doesn't hype itself to grand levels. but better than most of the new  animation shows on Cartoon Network. The story line has been treated in comics (the graphic novel Red Rain), but this DVD goes further and makes this animated work special. It impressed me and I don't impress that easy

In my opinion,  the wide-screen version of this cartoon  should have been in theaters next to BATMAN BEGINS as a second feature. On second thought, get it and do that yourself!

2359776,5,B000A59PLU,"This production was a LOT better than I thought it would be.  I wish I could give it more stars.  One of the best Batman productions ever.  I was completely mesmerized.  I DO like the new series.  Remember all those who squawked in 1992 when Batman: The Animated Series was coming out, thinking it would not be successful?  Since then we have also had the edgy Batman Beyond animated series.  It takes guts, vision, and true creativity to keep the Batman legend alive and fresh.

Batman Vs. Dracula has superb, stunning animation.  Gotham City has never had more depth.  You really feel like you are there, even more so than BTAS.  The story is about Dracula being resurrected accidentally in Gotham City.  He soon seeks to contol the city by turning it into a legion of the undead.  While posing on the Gotham social scene as Count Alucard, Dracula falls for Vicki Vale, and wants to make her his bride.  Batman, the ultimate disciple of science, must try to stop the Prince of Darkness and rescue his victims.

The action and scariness intensifies majorly as the film goes on.  Towards the end, I was majorly creeped out and almost crawling the walls.  Because of the real horror here, (and lots of blood) parental guidance is necessary!

Heck, why just take my word for it?  This is from [...]

[Synopsis: ""['The Batman vs Dracula'] is genuinely one of the best I've seen this year. My brother, who is in the die-hard ""The Batman will never be good"" group, enjoyed it as much as I did.

So, I guess that means I'm required to HATE the new animated Batman movie and series?  Hell with that.  Director Michael Goguen and his talented team have made a very exciting and visually stunning movie that defies expectations.  Batman vs. Dracula may sound like an odd premise, but they really make it work.  On top of the slick and dynamic animation, they create a story that is scary and intense while keeping itself rooted in the level of reality we've seen in Gotham City (check out the DVD extras with science vs. superstition documentary).  They've even kept it watchable for children.  My 3-year-old daughter adores the movie and I don't feel guilty showing it to her since (little spoiler ahead) The Batman cures the vampire victims near the climactic ending.  I'm not a plant, just a middle manager living in Florida, but I wanted The Batman team to know they're doing a good job from someone in the demographic who is most critical of their work.  I adore the Bruce Timm Gotham Knights-style animated series and would love a lot more of it (JLU nothwithstanding) but Goguen, Capizzi, Romano, and company are doing a great job and I'll be getting all their DVD sets to put on the shelf with The Animated Series from the 1990's.",1137542400,,1400,4.704918032786885

Second, they truly believe that people will believe that Dracula would be brought from Transilvania through Gotham Pity. C'mon, this is truly for people with no brains! So this is no Batman, its Batkid!

Let's see... here we have the Benguim and the Dorker being dominated by the mind of Count Dragula. So Batkid will have to pursue them to save Gotham... hhh... d... help me, uncle Alfred, I have mental problems! I forgot that he is a vampire, that's why I'm hurt so bad. Oh, I brought the Dorker to my cave... Yuck, he smells awful! Please, help me, I'm just a dumb kid who wants to get a girl called Vickie, but I have to fight this vampires first. Oh, yeah. We are all inside the Matrix, so we can make that crazy things, like slow down the time we flip on the air, or even dodge punches and bullets... d!!

The animation is awful, the plot is uninspiring. The producers simply destroyed the famous characters from Batman's mithology. I suggest you to leave this fake Batman and save your money to spent in a real Batman movie instead of this garbage, something inspiring, creative and mindblowing, like Mask of the Phantasm. In Mask, we have no Batkid, but Batman. No Dorker, but Joker, and insane as ever! And we have a truly story, not this scribble.",1135814400,3,1340,4.46530612244898

Immediately, I picked up my two seasons of the 90's Batman TAS serie and my four animated movies for him to watch. So I put him to watch the first season of Batman TAS. And guess what? He LOVED IT! He also told me he wanted a copy! He told me as we was watching ""Uncle, I like this cartoons more than the ones on TV"".

2359799,5,B000A59PLU,"When I first heard of this, I was pretty sure I'd like it.  But damned if I didn't love it.

First thing's first:  This is not the Dark Knight of Batman: TAS.  This incarnation is less dark.  He's a younger version.  He's not jaded or grumpy, and his stories are very action oriented.  I think it's a mistake to say this series isn't as sophisticated as Batman: TAS.  At first, I thought that, but the more I watch it the more it impresses me.  The Batman is not as complex as B:TAS, but it's really grown on me.

And this movie is a great illustration why.  It could've been so lame.  I remember when Spider-Man fought vampires in his most recent cartoon series.  They couldn't even say the word ""Blood"".  How can you do a decent vampire story with that kind of constraint?  Thankfully, B vs D doesn't.  There's blood.  And lots of it.  And dozens of creepy vampires.  And some truly excellent storytelling coupled with superbly animated action scenes.

There's so many great moments in this film that I can't even begin to describe them.  Nor would I want to spoil them.  But I'll give one:  Penguin makes a great Renfield.  That's all.  The rest you have to find out for yourself.

The Batman isn't Batman: TAS.  But if it was exactly the same, why would I bother watching it when I already own TAS on DVD?  So go in expecting a lot of fun, and you won't be disappointed.",1131321600,7,1374,4.366533864541832
2359800,4,B000A59PLU,"Well, first off, this movie DEFINATLEY didn't suck. I, a 23 yr. old fan of Batman, really enjoyed this film. I'm not a nerd or a crazy fan boy, but this was a solid effort. The animation, the fights, the story (of course it wasn't an amazing story, but is kept me captivated).

Honestly, I wish some of these scenes could have been adapted  into live action. The fight scene with Dracula on the rooftop, the huntdown for Joker in the lab, and the final battle between Bat and Drac would have me salivating if it were live action. These animated fight scenes are, without a doubt, FAR superior to the fight scenes in Batman Begins. I mean c'mon, could any of you actually see what was happening through all that blur in Batman Begins? If you could, I envy you because there were probably some good moves in there, but who knows...

Yes (back to Batman vs. Dracula), the story is kinda stupid at certain moments such as: Dracula's relocation from Transylvania to Gotham, Penguin being Dracula's tour guide through Gotham, Batman using his phenomonal detective skills to figure out that Alucard is Dracula backwards, etc... But we must remember that us 20 something year olds are not the target audience. This is for the kids man.

Actually though, I don't know if it's exactly suitable for the little ones either. There are a lot of creepy parts. Not for us no, but for kids that have a bed time and still wet their beds, yes. Which leads me to ask: Did anyone else think that little girl singing under the street light was scary? I did. Creepy kids creep me out. Remember those stupid little girls in the ""Nightmare On Elm St."" movies that would play jump rope and sing? I STILL have nightmares about those creepy little broads man!

Anyway, the stuff I found cool in Batman vs. Dracula would probably be scary to my nephew (then again he's a little wimp so I don't really know what to tell you... sorry).

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and will watch it again in the near future. I really would have rather seen this movie as a live action film. Yes, I said it! Hey, if they can make Dracula go toe to toe with Blade in a crappy film called ""Blade:Trinty""... Then there's no reason this animated film couldn't have been made into a live action film. Sound like something a nerd might say? So what... Batman vs. Dracula rocked and Blade:Trinity STILL sucks!!!",1130630400,5,2365,4.514018691588785

The movie moves along at a brisk pace so not to bore. It could be a little violent and creepy for young children though. I got the dvd for $10 I would not have bought it for $20. My son who is 9 really loved it. So I guess the youger fans will enjoy. People who want more depth or reality might not care for it.

The movie even throws  in a few cliche plot points that aren't even relevant to the plot, as if the writer just like them enough to want to include them. The dialog is filled with just the sort of ham you'd imagine, but it's so uninspired that it's devoid of any fun. There's nothing interesting or creative about how Dracula is portrayed, or anybody else in the film for that matter.

This movie also features the worst portrayal of Batman I've ever seen. He comes off as being really dumb, and socially clumsy when not in costume. Overall, he actually comes off as being a bit girly at times. Some character development or backstory for him is hinted at occasionally, but never actually made part of the story.

2359803,2,B000A59PLU,"This film is a complete and utter destruction of the Batman franchise.  Based off the legend of Dracula, this film molds Dracula's legend to fit its own legacy.

In the movie, Dracula has been transported to Gotham sometime within the past three centuries from his home town.  Though it explains for why he's in Gotham, the theory is completely and utterly ridiculous how he is buried there.  He lies in a tomb underneith Gotham Cemetary which seems to be specially designed for him and is directly linked to the Gotham City catacombs.

Although mystical occurrences are common in the DC Universe, Batman has never been prown for magic and mystic.  This movie pushes the limits of Batman's mystical knowledge and the Batman legacy as he faces up against some of the strangest things usually present in a modern horror flick.  These things, however are not suitable for the Batman franchise.  This includes zombies, mystical control, and magic.

The Batman franchise has never been known for these things before, so why add them now?  As a kid, I would imagine that Batman would face off with villains such as Dracula, Blody Mary, Candy Man, Freddy, Jason, and Michael Myers; sure this things are great in our imaginations, but when cultivated into a movie the thrill and excitement is lost due to the fact that it's not meant to be; especially in this specifc context.

The movie is designed to be a horror film in itself most of the time; however, it doesn't establish it as that for the most part.  The coloring and animation style used in this movie establish it as a childrens film.  There isn't even an attempt to portray the Batman as a dark figure in a vile and terrifying atmosphere.  For having a tragic past, Gotham has seemingly taken on a new light.  The colors used for the most part are truly vibrant, unlike the 1990's counterpart where the colors were dark and grim (where this sort of a movie might work if done properly).

This film has no backbone to it.  It makes the same fatal error that a lot of the 1990's and prior superhero flicks did, which was to assume that the viewer knows the villains and the hero.  That is where this film truly goes wrong.  It establishes Batman as Batman, not as Bruce Wayne; only referring to his grim past two times as a filler.  It uses the Penguin and Joker to move the story forward, and the film doesn't even take even a second to analyze the mentality of any of the characters or establish their relations.  In fact, this movie plays on the entire concept of knowing the history of all villains used, giving Dracula only a mediocre background history.

They establish the Dracula as nothing more than a blood hungy fiend, which is one of the many misconceptions done with todays media.  It teaches our children that Dracula is something that he truly never was: a power hungry fiend.  Though only through world literature will the true Dracula be portrayed, rather than the misconception portrayed in this film and others.

Overall this movie is a poor attempt to revive an already failing show after destroying all that Batman has come to be known as.  Though the movie does have its up points, the majority of it relies too much on the hunt for Dracula extending what would be best suited as a 30 minute special into an hour plus movie.",1129939200,8,3297,4.631669535283993

2359805,5,B000A59PLU,"Because I am not really a fan of the new ""THE BATMAN"" series, I was not looking forward to this feature film. However, having read so many good reviews on it, I decided to plunk down $20 bucks and give it a chance. I AM GLAD I DID!

As far as compared to the original Batman animated series storyline in terms of the animated films, I would have to rank it either third or tied with Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker (Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm WILL ALWAYS BE number one to me)! Though not rated, I wouldn't recommended to young kids. Much like ""Phantasm"" and ""Return Of The Joker"", I would only recommend it to young teens or adults that are fans because there are some intense scenes in it.

As for the film itself, I think the makers of Blade: Trinity could've took notes on how to really bring out Dracula as THE BATMAN's version is very good! It sticks to the legend but goes about it very smartly and even educates on what's fact and what's fiction on vampirism! I was also surprised to see the introduction of Vicky Vale, one of the few characters that the original Batman: The Animated Series DIDN'T use!

I also find this version of Batman has a bit more of a lighter side than the one we are used too but still retains a lot of the ""dark knight"" side. The use of Vale to show the conflict between his own desires and his commitment to being the champion of Gotham was well done too. While I would've liked to have seen it explored further, this wasn't about Bruce's love life so I can live with what was shown.

Another thing I hated about this version is their Joker! But, on the plus side, I DO like their version of The Penguin! In this feature, I think both are handled well. The Joker is probably at his most frightening and slightly disturbing in this one! While not on the level with the classic Mark Hamil version, he comes very close here!

As for the fights, they were handled well and it made sense too. Batman basically had to use smarts here because while he is the ultimate of physical perfection, Dracula IS Dracula so physical strength, endurance and even weapons wouldn't be enough this time around!

Overall, I think even detractors of THE BATMAN series will like this feature! I am not a fan of the new series BUT I certainly DID like this piece! Worth the money!",1129939200,19,2295,4.350467289719626

Don't get me wrong, the Batman I grew up with was the animated series, and that show still has my favorite animation. Yet I do like the way they put together the drawings in this one. The Joker had my eyebrows rise when I first saw him, but after a wile I thought; ""This isn't bad at all."" All though he's not Mark Hamill, this Joker gives a darker tone to the character, wile still keeping him traditional. His voice is deeper and more throaty, with a hint of Mark Hamill inspiration in some parts. Not to shabby!
This film is not rated but if I were to give it a rating I would say; Sometimes PG, sometimes PG-13?? There are some ruff parts, all though you can tell they kept kids in mind. I would not recommend this film for anyone under 9 years old. (Maybe even 10??) There are more blood moments then I thought there would be. YET THEY DON'T SHOW ANYONE BLOODY!!! DON'T GET ME WRONG!! This is NOT a horror film believe me!! This is NOT another Gotham At Gaslight! This movie IS meant to be enjoyed by most kids. Yet would not recommend for tots though. Like I said, several parts with blood, also some Zombie moments. (Also, fare warning! There is a part where they show a little girl as a vampire, zombie, thing. It is brief though so don't hold your breath!) All together this is a great film, and I would really recommend it!!!",1524096000,,1655,4.175
