We ate up the first two seasons and now we're all hooked, but where is season 3 and all the rest?  Eddie Haskell was barely in season 2, so we're looking forward to the rest of the seasons where he was presumably more prominent.  Hurry!",1217030400,5,349,4.088235294117647

3427154,5,B001992NZG,"Season 3 is arguably the best overall season, although the best episode will have to wait until season 4(In the Soup). While they are highly structured episodes, they all feature Beaver in some of his most awkward situations.  Recently, 3 of the cast members have stated that seasons 3 through 6 will come out in next 3 years-although possibly not with Universal.  Official Season 3 announcement should come in November or December for an early 2009 release date. My only worry is that they will do the volume system-which is a consumer ripoff!

Nearly all episodes (except for a handful for each season 3-6) are available to watch online at Netflix, included in membership.  I just watched episodes from seasons 3-6, commercial-free, 24 minutes each.  I've been a Netflix member for years, gotten irritated at Universal like everybody else waiting for years for Seasons 3 and beyond after buying Seasons 1 and 2, and was shocked to discover by accident today that the episodes are available to view at Netflix!

I found out afew years ago that it was out in America on dvd I was over the moon, it had been over 40 years since I had seen one episode, now it seems the wait is starting all over again for me-Why Are We Waiting!!!!!!!!!!, I do feel sure that if we did ""Leave It To Beaver"" we would have the rest of the seasons by now.",1216339200,2,527,3.8440366972477062

3427190,5,B001992NZG,"I loved this show when I was a kid. I was in Beaver's age group when it was telecast in prime time back in the early 60s It was so refreshing having a TV show that was seen from the kid's point of view, unheard of at the time. It is no wonder it has survived the test of time. I have purchased all six seasons on DVD and whenever I get a little nostalgic, I watch a few episodes and my mind goes back to that innocent time.",1498694400,3,423,3.764044943820225

Beaver gets into all sorts of trouble with his friend Larry. Wally begins to get more interested in girls and Eddie is his typical too polite self to Mrs. Cleaver. So sit down in a comfortable place and enjoy another great season of the classic show.

They aren't thrilled with this news but their parents insist that they attend.  Well, after the first Saturday they decide it will be their last.  Mrs. Prescott, the dance teacher, is a hoot as she tries to teach the youngsters some dance moves and social graces.  She reminds me quite a bit of the school principal, Mrs. Rayburn.  The following week, Beaver and Larry pretend to go but hide out behind Anderson's barn instead,eating bolony sandwiches that Larry has in his pocket and getting into some other mischief.  Of course, the Cleavers find out.",1457740800,,727,5.008333333333334

I enjoy these early episodes when the Beaver was cute and always getting into trouble. The stories are all golden with a moral to the story that both parents and children seem to learn.  This type of television writing was subtle about sending us a message or making us think about everyday life situations.  Sitcoms like: Father Knows Best, My Three Sons, and Leave It To Beaver were all excellent about showing us the American way of life.  The Andy Griffith show and Real McCoy's also brought family value situations along with comedy to the Television screen.  The 60's were a special time for growing up and learning some of these family values which should carry over to this day.",1438992000,5,781,4.630434782608695

Again I'm in the middle of buying a TV series when seemingly out of the blue they release the entire collection at a reduced rate (not only Leave it to Beaver but many others).

The quality of the transfers are outstanding considering the age of the show .... I like that Shout Factory put single sided discs instead of the two sided discs done by Universal for the first two seasons ....

3427457,5,B001992NZG,"Well well, what do we have here, another great season set of an iconic 1950's/1960's television show? Why yes, yes we do, I shouldn't have to speak about the greatness of this show, most people already know how great this show was/is, especially in a time where sitcoms are boring and stale (my opinion of course), it's great to see all these great old sitcoms getting their due on DVD, such as 'I Love Lucy' a few years ago, 'Mister Ed' 'The Lucy Show' 'Here's Lucy' and 'Leave it to Beaver', and in my estimation, Shout Factory! has done a great job with releasing season sets before (like All In The Family), and the 'Leave it to Beaver' seasons are no different.

Right of you'll notice a great packaging, with the clear hard plastic case, and inside you get 6 DVD's housed in sturdy holders, and a booklet telling you which episodes are on which discs, original airdates, explaining what the episodes are about, guest stars and more, now let me get on to the content of this set which is of course the episodes themselves, now I noticed Universal released the first 2 seasons of this show, but didn't release anymore, so Shout Factory! got the rights to it I'm guessing, so that they could finish releasing it, but I think they have released the first 2 seasons in their name as well with 'The Complete Series' box set, now I don't have that, all I have is seasons 3 and 4, so with that being said, the content, you get all 39 episodes of the third season, and they are all completely restored and remastered, and boy you can tell, most of the cuts and tears have been removed, as well as the grain, a few spots you can notice a few rips and a little grain, but with a show that's over 50 years of age, they did a fine job remastering these, the rips and grain that you do see at times is pretty minimal, you only see it in certain shots, no gripes with me when you see how great most of it looks, crystal clear, and the picture literally jumps right off the screen, even though this show was of course shot in black and white, it makes no difference, the picture still jumps off the screen, so remastering job? 5 stars all the way, I cannot complain, and the audio is crystal clear as well, gone of course are the original mono tracks, and it sounds superb, so audio? 5 stars as well.

So yeah, I guess you could say I'm very pleased with this, and will be purchasing the rest of the seasons eventually, this is a great old show, and it's gotten the recognition it's deserved on DVD finally, so if you're looking to get 'Leave it to Beaver' on DVD, you cannot go wrong with these Shout Factory! season sets, they are well worth the price at about $25.00-$30.00 depending on where you get it, Amazon here has this season at $25.00, which is a very reasonable price considering I paid $30.00 at Walmart.",1297036800,6,2807,4.354961832061068

3427477,5,B001992NZG,"Some people said that this was too wholesome even for the 50s.  I don't know, I led a pretty calm childhood and it still had a decent amount of yelling, etc.

Some reviewers say the Cleavers were ""too nice"" to be real.  OK.  Maybe.  Come on, TV SitComs are fantasy.  But I saw a fair amount of yelling, and some REAL tempers flare during the Third Season.  It just wasn't peppered with vulgarities as most shows are now.  It was ""true"" to the public morality of that time.  At least, as I see it.

LEAVE IT TO BEAVER is still around where other shows have disappeared from the radar JUST BECAUSE they were unique.  How many shows from the 50s are still being shown?  You can really count them on one hand, no?  I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners and Leave It To Beaver...(Still can't figure out why the owners of ""BURNS AND ALLEN"" have refused to air these on a regular basis or even tried to release them on DVD.)

That is a testament to the really high quality entertainment value of this program.  LITB will never get old because it was a slice of life we can all relate to...and will continue to do so.

 It took them years with Leave it to Beaver and I still don't know if they came out with Mama's Family Season 2 yet. Anyway Sony released I dream of Jeannie and Bewitched fairly fast and Paramount with I love Lucy was also released fast.

I am giving this a 5 STAR rating based on the classic television show, not on the DVD set because the DVD set has not been released yet. I am also not posting my rating on how slooooow Universal is to releasing the set.

I will not post all about the shows, etc since it has been done allready but I will revise my review when I receive my set and have the entire Season watched and let you guys know all about the quality of the discs and any bonuses if any, and etc.... A great cover art also!!! :)

3427514,5,B001992NZG,"Folks:  I love ""Leave It To Beaver"" and have been absolutely disgustipated with Universal for their ridiculous policy of leaving it (as well as many others, evidently) high and dry after releasing only two seasons.  But whatever you do, DO NOT order the ""complete"" six season set from the biggest crooks on the web, ""[...]""
They may very well have changed their name by now (as they oft-times to, just to confuse the gullible consumer), but avoid any ""complete"" sets like the plague.  I had the same problem with the ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" series, which Universal also had the rights to (I believe), and found a site that claimed to have ""all 456 episodes on
37 DVD's"").  After spending $130.00 for that seemingly great bargain (more fool me), I waited two months to receive my package, only to find that while there were indeed 37 DVD's, there were only 164 episodes included, with five
episodes repeated and four DVD's totally worthless due to breakdown and glitches.  They were ALL recorded off a
Canadian TV outlet and are of HORRIBLE quality.  Their website looks quite professional, but do not be fooled!
I'm hoping that we'll get the remaining four seasons of ""LITB"" in our lifetime, but please don't make the same mistake I did with ""AHP.""",1262649600,30,1252,4.8
3427525,5,B001992NZG,Why is Universal not releasing the rest of the series?  Is it because not enough people appear to be willing to buy?  What can we do to convince them we're out here and ready to spend $$$$ on such a classic series?,1257033600,4,214,4.071428571428571

Please do not waste my time, if they are not going to be released, then notify me that they won't.  This way, I am not waiting, month after month, year after year.",1254096000,3,375,4.054054054054054

To Beaver"", and I would love to have every season.  But the bottom line is
that the studio will not continue to release it on DVD (and believe me, I
would buy every season in a heartbeat [I already own Seasons 1 and 2, which are the only ones released]).  A previous review stated that there should be a statement for the release of Season 3 in September - October; well, it's nearly November and I haven't seen anything yet.  Please everyone, contact Universal studios and demand that they release at least Seasons 3 and 4 (Season 4 includes one of my favorites -- the Soup episode)!!!  Please do not give me a negative review on this; I just wish
everyone would get Universal Studios to get their act in gear!!!",1225238400,49,787,4.29054054054054

Anyway, by researching I found that you can get seasons 1-6 (all in one box set) on a few websites. Heres one: [...] - check it out!
