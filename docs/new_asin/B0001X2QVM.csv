8017516,2,B0001X2QVM,This is a 1980's kitchy comedy but the picture quality stinks. It looks like they are trying to go for something but the production quality is terrible.  Who produced this movie?  See Lar Park Lincoln before she got into horror films and of course there's Eva Gabor and Lu Leonard who are real pros.,1366156800,,299,4.518518518518518
8017517,4,B0001X2QVM,"Oh my goodness, this a horrible movie from the eighties.  It was purchased as a present.  However, the VHS copy we recieved was in excellent condition, if not like new, and the movie gave a few good giggles at what the eighties was like.",1327536000,,237,4.363636363636363
8017518,3,B0001X2QVM,"PRINCESS ACADEMY is one of the lesser titles in the canon of 80's comedies (this one has dated rather more shockingly than most), nevertheless it's still quite an amusing romp.  Eva Gabor leads the cast as the Countess Von Pupsin, head of the fashionable Von Pupsin Academy, which prides itself on educating the most well-bred of young ladies.  Enter newcomer Cindy Cathcart (B-movie starlet Lar Park-Lincoln) the sole scholarship student who soon finds herself caught up with the other sex-starved students in trying to improve their extra-credit `activities'; in addition to overthrowing their evil and corrupt matron Fr&auml;ulein Stinkenschmidt (Lu Leonard).  As you can probably imagine, this movie won't challenge your mind.  It's merely an entertaining little diversion which will really only be appreciated by it's faithful legion of 80s' kitsch fans (like myself).  Originally rated R.  Also featuring Richard Paul, Badar Howar and Carole Davis.",1118016000,4,954,5.5
