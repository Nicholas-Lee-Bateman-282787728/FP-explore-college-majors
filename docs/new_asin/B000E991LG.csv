8107661,5,B000E991LG,"A great presentation of data and facts.  Similar to another reviewer, there is much content (including video evidence) of recent events that I was never aware of.  I won't give anything away here, but will just mention that it is quite incredible.  Production and quality are top notch.  5 stars.",1203033600,,296,4.86
8107662,5,B000E991LG,"Hi
I found it most interesting, and there was an update of activity that I wasn't aware of.  A bit more infomation on Agriglyphs or Message ones would be most welcome. Noting there seems to be an average one such a year.  The rest of the crop circles, some prove a challenge to work out there meaning.  For those who do the research-You do a good job.  Keep up the good work.  Most appreciated.
Kindest Regards

If you are not familiar with the crop circle phenomena, this is a great way to start, before you get any other dvd with more talk and less footage.  enjoy, grab it, get familiar with the subject and you are ready to see other dvds on the subject.",1184889600,6,292,4.105263157894737
8107664,5,B000E991LG,"If you are interested in the phenomena of Crop Circles, this DVD is a great place to start.  This documentary examines all the terrestrial explanations including plasma vortices, hoaxers, etc. Each is, in turn, dismissed as inadequate.  The very important distinctions between hoaxed and genuine circles is examined at some length. And then there is the Dave and Doug story.  In 1991 these two pubmates convinced the mass media that they were behind the mystery in the fields.  The question, of course, is why did the media pounce on them?  And the answer is because they were the first and only down to Earth explanation; hence, mystery solved.  But the real hoax perpetrated by Doug and Dave was on the media itself which with thoroughgoing gullability accepted their version of events and declared an end to the story.  Henceforth the news could dismiss the story.  But despite the mass media's long standing disinterest, the story goes on and the mystery deepens as the evidence accumulates and the studies intensify. The bottom line is that either there is a ""natural"" terrestrial cause for the crop circle, or there isn't. And if there isn't, then that opens up a new can of worms that most people would rather not peer into.

A number of experts, including the well-known Colin Andrews and Michael Glickman, are interviewed and each adds an informed perspective on the complex puzzle that are now referred to as ""agriglyphs.""  For instance, Dr. Nick Kollerstrom, a Fellow at the Royal Astronomical Society, uses the complex designs of crop circles to teach a ""holistic geometry...that shows us a different experience of mathematics...""  Indeed, new conceptions of math and physics seems to result from the study of these cereal pictograms, especially, as Dr. Kollerstrom notes, ""in the past 12 years"" when the complexity and progressive themes of the formations provide a window into new areas of mathematical study.  New geometric theorems and correlaries have been deduced from the study of the abstract configurations of the circles.  Despite this, the media continues to persist in its obstinant refusal to acknowledge the investigations that mathematicians, physicists, botanists and other researchers have been conducting for at least the past 15 years.

In sum, this DVD is a fascinating account of a phenomena that refuses to go away, and seems to point to only one conclusion - that an intelligence greater than our own is behind these curious and sublime marvels.",1154131200,17,2480,5.091358024691358
