7897390,5,6305908435,"Excellent representation of the genre of burlesque, with good joke skits.  The musical numbers cannot be matched today, and that is a loss!",1168387200,,139,5.043478260869565
7897391,5,6305908435,"Bettie loses some ""coolness points"" when she dances, but if you go into frame-by-frame mode on your DVD player it's obvious that each frame of her dancing would have made a great still shot in and of itself. Proof that she was a great poser, and a lousy dancer, but as she has said herself, she was ""far from being a professional dancer"". Still, she is very appealing, despite the fact that neither my husband nor myself could contain our unabated laughter during her dance scenes. Her sparkle and sense of fun are evident throughout, she is in great shape, and her ever-changing and playful facial expressions are absolute treats to see.

Plus! You get to ""Hear Bettie speak!"" in addition to seeing her jump around - uhhm I mean dance.

The best part of the DVD is, yes of course, the silent, black and white arcade film loop of Bettie made specifically for those old-time coin-activated viewers....Bettie gyrates up to a point, then the screen is suddenly blocked out with a caption telling the viewer to insert coins to see more of the film. This of course occurs at a regular basis throught this particular short, as it did when those types of films were originally shown. Classic camp!

There are also appearances by a rather famous, albeit scary-looking drag queen from the time, and some professional strippers who could have passed for male drag queens...but I bought these really just for the Bettie Page segments; these two DVD's are a must-have for Bettie Page fans.

Viewing these will most likely result in the viewer alternating fits of laughter with admiration for the beauty and playfulness of Bettie Page in her prime.",1100995200,4,1635,4.76678445229682
7897392,5,6305908435,"More delightful Bettie Page in a variety of teasy routines and charming ""come-ons"". You can see why she is a cult item now. There was no one like her. The rest of this DVD is devoted to corny routines with the exception of the notorious Lili St. Cyr---a legendary stripper of the time. She is beautiful and her vignettes are classy and professional. She, like Page, was also a favorite of photographers---most notably Bernard of Hollywood.  This is a must for nostalgia buffs and a rare look at what used to be called ""burlesque"".",1036022400,3,530,4.638297872340425
7897393,5,6305908435,"This DVD is a time piece about a gone art -- burlesque!  It is excellent -- from Bettie Page to Lili St Cyr (who is more beautiful than I realized), this DVD has all the kitsch of a bygone era!  Also included with this DVD is a skit from ""Striporama"" where Bettie Page speaks!  The quality is superior to that in Striporama (which you should avoid like the plague).  This DVD is not for someone who wants a strip film, but rather is for the lover of a lost art form -- burlesque!",1001462400,3,479,4.118279569892473
7897394,1,6305908435,"Unspeakably awful! There's very little of Bettie, and a great, great deal of excruciatingly cornball late-'50s style variety ""entertainment"" that you might imagine might be cute and  endearing but most emphatically is not. You'd have to be a great deal  hornier than I was to find Lily St. Cyr's strip tease arousing, and the  only notable musical performer is a woman with an extraordinarily huge  head.  If you've never trusted another review in your life, trust this one:  you might as well throw the money away.",964569600,43,515,4.930232558139535
