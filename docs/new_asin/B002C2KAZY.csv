3902884,5,B002C2KAZY,"This DVD has the fairy tale story for all of the main characters, as well as a few of the songs in the special features section. If you've never seen 'Super Why' before, it's a reading/educational cartoon that goes over sounding words out, the alphabet, spelling, and reading. Each episode starts out with one of the characters having a problem, and they go into a fairy tale that can help them solve it. The fairy tales are all altered to fit the episode, but the base of each tale is usually the same. At the end of the episode, they go over the problem again, and how to solve it, as well as a moral.

The DVD also has some games and printable activities that you use, but I've never personally used that section.",1358553600,2,716,4.343283582089552

3902886,5,B002C2KAZY,"I have two young sons, aged two and three. I don't like to let them watch tv very much, but since I work full time from home it is occasionally unavoidable for me. This is the greatest show. It is so educational. After watching it a few times, my son learned to say the entire alphabet. Now he is three, and he can spell the words ""sing"", ""hiccup"", ""spell"", and a few others. He can identify at least half of the letters in the alphabet as well. My young two year old repeats everything on the show as well, and is pretty close to saying the alphabet.

If you're going to let your kids watch tv, I would recommend this show over anything else, including Sesame street. It is completely focused on letter identification, spelling, reading and rhyming. On top of that, it teaches important lessons such as the importance of books and how to problem solve. I absolutely love it!",1322265600,3,875,4.434782608695652
3902887,3,B002C2KAZY,"First DVD I received didn't read after a few show times, requested for 2nd DVD.

My son loves Super Why, disappointed that some couldn't be played.  But I show him Super Why on some other channels too.  So it's not a big problem.  Just that it's not durable.  Not sure if any other DVDs have the same problem by the same manufacturer.",1318377600,,402,4.391891891891892

3902891,5,B002C2KAZY,I bought this to add to my sons (2yrs) videos.  We don't get PBS anymore and he loved this show so since we are no longer able to watch them on TV owning them was the next best thing.  He loves the alphabet part Alpha Pig and to dance along with them at the end of the show.  It is very entertaining and educational.,1285113600,2,316,3.90625
