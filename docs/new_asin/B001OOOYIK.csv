8331000,1,B001OOOYIK,"There seemed to be no attempt to digitally remaster this film to DVD.  The story treatment of Poland's first christian King (Miesko) was very poor despite the fine cast.  I hope that someone like Jerzy Hoffman (who directed the 'Fire with Sword' and 'The Deluge') does a remake. Miesko and his son Boguslaw the Brave both forged Poland into a powerful European state, which subsequently became a powerful empire stretching from the Baltic to the Black sea during the golden age of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

For people of Polish extraction like me or for those very few others in, the English speaking world, interested in Polish History this film is disjointed and not pleasant to watch.  It also requires a prior knowledge of Miesko and his deeds to follow what is going on.
