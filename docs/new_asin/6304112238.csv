785982,5,6304112238,"This is a well-written story about ordinary, decent people, and a very well-acted ""little"" film that simply doesn't beat you over the head with how good it is. Watch it more than once. The characters, and the tough, real life financial and personal dilemmas and choices they struggle with, will hold your interest even after the movie is finished. To dub this a mere ""coming of age"" tale is to miss the point. As our country is once again peopled with those whose lives have been forever changed by the hard consequences of war and/or economic crisis, this movie is both timely and worth appreciating. I highly recommend this film.",1248566400,15,631,4.745454545454545
785983,4,6304112238,"This is a good coming of age movie.  David Arnott did a great job portraying a kid trapped in a difficult living situation with a mom who's stripping for money and a dad who's divorced from his mom and living in a monestary after suffering post traumatic stress from the war in Nam.  The movie did run slow and the ending was kind of abrupt.  Overall, I'm glad I purchased the movie and I'll watch it again.",1197676800,5,407,4.259740259740259
785984,2,6304112238,"Hawn is a single mother trying to raise her 12-year-old son by bartending, waitressing, and stripping in a small coastal Florida town in the summer of 1969 (there are various mentions of the impending Apollo 11 moon landing and the war in Vietnam throughout the film).  The son, struggling to deal with his mother's nightly activities and a weakening hope that his father will return, tries to raise money to help his situation by ripping off a drug smuggling scam and selling the goods on the side. The Florida scenery is very appealing and well shot by former award-winning cinematographer-turned director Chris Menges, but what might have been a touching story gets bogged down in a somewhat convoluted and hard-to-swallow plot. The talents of veteran actors Goldie Hawn, Keith Carradine, and Arliss Howard are wasted here, and young David Arnott gives a particulary wooden and at times annoying performance. Based on a novella by Scott Sommer (he also wrote the screenplay).",1103500800,3,978,5.074534161490683
785985,4,6304112238,"If you do, you'll be in hog heaven as Hawn portrays a piece of beach trash who tries a little late to mend her ways.  The relationship between her character and that of her son, who looks to be around 11 or 12 in the film, is one of the enduring accounts in the movies of a mother trying to stay too young and a boy overcome by urges he didn't know he had.  The young actor who plays the boy, David Arnott, does a fine job maneuvering between trying to be just a kid and having to deal with unexpected adult complexities.  He breaks your heart as he attempts valiantly to be the father to the eternally youthful and hedonistic character Goldie Hawn plays, she should be the mother but she doesn't know how to.  And Arliss Howard is in the movie too, always underrated, with killer looks and a mean streak that gives him a bit of Warren Oates-like excitement.  This movie tries to stretch Goldie Hawn's acting chops a bit but I think people will always prefer her in kind of ditsy comedy roles.  This one hit too close to home for her many fans to enjoy it, and there aren't really enough boy-watchers out there to have made this a huge hit on account of the then-unknown David Arnott.

It's the kind of American movie that was being made in the age of the New American Cinema of the 1970s, a character-driven study of laziness, cruelty and unexpected courage, more akin perhaps to SUGARLAND EXPRESS or SHAMPOO than to any of Goldie's other films.  She and Arnott should team up for another picture today, it could be a hit, if enough marketing muscle is leveraged to get those asses into the seats as they say.",1096588800,26,1610,4.361204013377926
785986,2,6304112238,"So-so movie with so-so acting - think of an unsuccessful cross between one of those many made-for-television grade-B drama films on the Lifetime Channel and an ABC Afterschool Special and you have a general idea what the film is like.
See on cable if you must, don't waste your time renting it out or buying it.",1039046400,4,311,4.571428571428571
785987,3,6304112238,"Goldie Hawn plays a single mother who resorts to stripping to support her son, played by David Arnott. In fact, the movie centers on David and his coming-of-age. Nothing really new here, but the film has a good heart (which it wears on its sleeve often enough).
Certainly this is not a great movie, but the Key West locations are beautiful. It's summer all the time there, and you can practically feel that muggy heat coming through the screen. The film has a languid (okay, slow) pace, befitting its 'life is a beach' flavor. Goldie looks great and the performances are fine. It's just unfortunate that the trivial story fails to develop the dramatic tension required of a better film. So basically this will appeal to fans of Goldie Hawn, movies set on the Florida coast, and lovers of old Mopars (Goldie drives a really cool '59 DeSoto). Made me wish I grew up there. :>",933120000,16,873,4.602564102564102
786110,1,6304112238,"Crisscross, 1992 film

This story is set in 1969 Key West Florida. A divorced woman has a 12-year old son. We see their personal life at home. His mom and her friend go to a ""key club"". The son sees his mom perform. Then he hitches a ride to Miami to find his dad, who works as a gardener in a monastery. They talk about the past. His mom comes to take him home. Can they all talk? No. ""Someday you'll understand."" The father talked about his past (a veteran of Vietnam and an Annapolis graduate). On the way home their car stops and they talk about their past life. Can Christopher repair the carburetor? [The news on TV dates this story.] Christopher goes for a boat ride with his girlfriend, he will deliver a few fish. But he discovers something inside one fish!

The recipient notices a missing fish. ""The dog ate it."" Christopher tells his mom he knows about her other job. He looks at the plastic pouch. [Is he wise beyond his years?] Christopher worries about his mom's dancing. Emmet tells him to dump that white powder and he does. His mom washes clothes at a laundromat. [Does this story drag on?] She meets a man there. Christopher talks back to his mom. [Is this leading to a tragedy?] Later Christopher offers to sell drugs to two strangers. Can they make a deal? Yes. They watch the moon landing n TV. [This wasn't cost-effective so it was never done again.] Christopher works at cleaning a pool. Later he visits his girlfriend. They are alone together. The next day he meets those two men who want to make a bi g deal. Can he do it? Later he sails out to visit a shrimp boat for a ""pickup"". But his fish are stolen by two masked men! Christopher has to explain his loss to the recipient. There is conflict. Joe comes to his aid.

At night Christopher rides a bicycle to the meeting. Those two men know his name! [My suspicions about this pair were correct.] There is another surprise about his mom's boyfriend. Whose fault was it? Now Christopher is in big trouble! He is fingerprinted. ""Drugs ruing people's lives, just like the war in Vietnam."" Joe talks to Christopher's mom. ""So long."" They move to a trailer park where his mom is happier.

There isn't much to like about this movie. Christopher seems to know too much for a 12-year old boy who doesn't have older male relatives or friends. Could a 12-year old boy know how to fix a carburetor? Only if he had older friends or relatives who could teach him. Would this boy get involved in a serious crime? His relations with a young girl also seem anachronistic for that time (and probably today). What was the purpose of this movie?",1371513600,,2603,4.439330543933054
786111,4,6304112238,"As an adolescent therapist, I've enjoyed watching films showing young males and females negotiating adolescence.  With Goldie Hawn doing her usual good job, she added an extra positive performance.  The young actor, David Arnott, is a bit wooden in his first movie role, and I don't think that he went on to an acting career.  But his naive, good-intended efforts to help his mother financially are presented in a natural, fresh way.  It's a good, simple family movie, especially, for those with young teens.",1366761600,3,508,5.011904761904762
786112,3,6304112238,Story line was depressing to say the least.  Not Goldy's best that's for sure. If your bent on seeing this one than purchase is the only way.,1362873600,,141,4.222222222222222

786114,4,6304112238,"I really liked the feel of this movie. Having been a teen in the mid 70's this movie had a very real feel for me. From what I understand this movie was meant to be a dramatic vehicle for Goldie Hawn, who at the time was best known as a comedic actress. While Goldie did a very good job the real standout in this movie was newcomer David Arnott who played Goldie's son Chris. He seemed to be a ""natural"" in front of the camera. While I wouldn't describe him as a great actor, the role he played was so close to who he was it was a very convincing performance. How unfortunate that this was the only movie he ever made, he definetly had alot of potential.",1338595200,2,653,4.109375

786118,4,6304112238,"This is an honest and loving movie that deals with life right up front.  It's a true testament for trying your best, perhaps failing a little but not backing down when things go wrong.  The challenges to this role that Goldie created were breathtakingly brilliant.  I recommend this movie especially to single mom's who go through life trying to do their best for their kids.  I think Goldie will become one of your heroes.  You do what you have to do to raise your kids.  You may lose sight once in a while, but you can't be where the kids are all the time and you have to trust them and hope they do well.  They may take the wrong road, but it is the love of a mother that brings them back to living life correctly.  Bravo, Goldie.

The young actor was very good, but, I don't remember him ever acting again, though he was made famous for this role.
