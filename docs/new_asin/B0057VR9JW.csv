8461163,4,B0057VR9JW,"My son loves this movie.  When I first saw it, I wasn't much of a fan -- it's very Mater-centric.  But I've warmed up to it after seeing it again.  There's a lot of really goofy lines, and just about everyone in the film is completely oblivious to amazingly obvious things, but hey, it's a movie for kids, much more so than the first one was.
I bought the UK region-free import sold here, and it played fine in my (USA model) PlayStation 3, so I'm very happy getting it for half the price of the US release.  It is marked region-free (shows A, B, C on the back), and the picky PS3 didn't complain (probably because it's 24 frames/sec like the theatrical release, so no issue between 50Hz Europe and 60Hz USA -- it's neither).",1491436800,,725,4.3088235294117645
