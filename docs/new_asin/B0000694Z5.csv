1729657,3,B0000694Z5,"This 30-minute claymation film has characters from many different sci-fi universes going against eachother. Some of the jokes are very funny, but many miss their mark. Most of the bad jokes come from Darth Vapor, who farts when he breathes. Other tired moments come from a terrible parody of the baby from ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" He smokes a cigar and swears at Kwirk and Spuck. The humor is absent in his scenes. But most of the other jokes work, especially the E.T. vs. Predator scene! Also, the spoof of Darth Maul is a hoot!",1032480000,7,529,4.578947368421052
1729658,2,B0000694Z5,"It seemed like a great idea - to meld all the classic space operas into a short animated film parody.  So what went wrong?  The animation is crude but entertaining, but alas the story is leaden and the 'humor' can barely induce a snicker (and I tested this one on my ""hey, we'll laugh at anything"" gang).  Watched it once, donated it to the library.",1027900800,,349,4.338461538461538
1729659,1,B0000694Z5,"On paper this looks good: take some of the most recognizable characters from science fiction, give them funny names a la Mad Magazine, and create 30 minutes of hilarity.  The only real problem is that the creators of Star Warp'd forgot to do anything remotely funny with this series.  Darth Vader is represented as ""Darth Vapor"" and uses ""the dark smell of the Force.""  This basically means 30 minutes of fart and poop jokes.  If that's your idea of a good time, it's your money...",1027555200,3,481,4.623529411764705

7964956,4,B0000694Z5,"If you are a science fiction fan (and I guess you would be if you are interested in this product) this thing is an absolute HOOT!  Not only does it send up Star Trek and Star Wars, but there are lots of cameos from several other sci-fi favorites.  If you want something similar, check out Star Wreck Zone.  It also pulls back the curtain and reveals that the mighty OZ might just be wearing second-hand shoes.",1358208000,,409,4.355263157894737
7964957,3,B0000694Z5,"This video is kinda funny, but I would rather have it out of the house.  Should have rented it ...or lived without it.  Thumb wars is funnier and a better spoof on star wars.",1223942400,,174,4.088235294117647
7964958,4,B0000694Z5,"The other reviews here already cover the basics. Yes, there are childish fart jokes (which seem lame to me). Yes, the storyline is kind of basic and the humor falls flat in places.

But, I gained a new appreciation for the movie when I watched the behind the scenes and listened to the commentary. I love working on my own projects and I love to see a small number of people do big things. The entire movie seems to have been created by 6 people on a very shoestring budget. I feel different about the movie because of that.

Some people wouldn't judge a movie in that way. For those types of people this movie is probably 3 stars. (And that's what I was going to give it before listening to the commentary.) If you give extra appreciation to projects done by small numbers of people then I think it's worth 4 stars.",1203897600,,816,4.326797385620915
7964959,3,B0000694Z5,"Star Warp'd is a clay/computer animation parody based around Star Trek, Star Wars and a bunch of other sci-fi flicks.

Captain Kwirk and the team aboard the ""Constiliation Prize""  find themselves going up against a farting Darth Vapor and his goons. something about a rift in time that makes the unbelievable happen or something. Robocop ends up against the Terminator and E.T lays the smackdown on Alien. A few laughs here and there but overall the whole thing goes for about 30 minutes, then goes into part 2.1 and 2.2 that last about 30 seconds and leave it like there will be a sequel.

I guess maybe that was there intent, but I felt like the movie had no ending.

Quite frankly, I'm ok with the fact that I hired this, but if I'd bought it I'd have felt ripped off, because this is more like something you'd enjoy finding as a bonus feature in a video to something like ""Team America"", ""Disaster"", Robot Chicken or even something to find on youtube.

Although it's nicely done and looks good, it just isn't long enough to be a DVD on it's own. Like I said, it should be something as a bonus feature.

It also has a boring featurette that goes almost longer then the movie itself.

Buy it if you must own every parody ever made, or are a die hard fan of Star Wars/Trek parodies, but euhh, it's nothing really special and could have been a lot better. rent it to find out what you'd think if you're interested to find out. Some good laughs, and some lame ones, but it needed to be a full length feature film rather then a DVD for what seems to be a pilot episode that never made any more episodes.",1179014400,,1601,4.352348993288591
7964960,4,B0000694Z5,"Unlike some of the other reviewers here, I liked BOTH this film and ""Spaceballs"" -- for different reasons.  ""Spaceballs"" is live action satire with plenty of Jewish in-jokes (""Druish princesses"" and all).  It is exactly what we have come to expect from producer Mel Brooks.  ""Star Warp'd,"" on the other hand is a fan-produced parody that is low-budget, low-tech and, in places, low-brow in its ""Dark Smell of the Force"" fart-and-poop humor -- but I found it funny just the same.  (After all, ""Spaceballs"" stooped to low-brow puns, too -- only they were mostly sexual double entendres.)

Granted, the claymation is rather crude.  If you watch the behind-the-scenes feature included on the DVD, you will see that parts of this were literally filmed in somebody's  garage.  Other parts were generated on home computers.  The puppets were made out of Sculpy, and the sets were put together in a couple of days by guys pulling all-nighters (by their own admission.)  If you read the credits, you'll see the same half-dozen or so names over and over, filling in all the different production roles -- that in itself struck me as a hilarious satire of blockbuster movies.

The producers themselves called this ""guerilla filmmaking"" and it should be viewed as such.  A film by fans for fans.  As such, I think the primitive puppets and homemade sets only add to the satire.  This is definitely not the slick product of Paramount or LucasFilms.

For all its primitiveness, ""Star Warp'd"" does do some original things in terms of effects.  It's the first claymation I've seen that combines realistic CGI with puppets.  In the opening scene we see a parody of the Star Wars crawl text.  (When Spock asks ""how did we get into this situtation?"" the captain tells him to read the crawl on the viewscreen.  Later on, when there's a dogfight, the ships fly through this same text -- after all, it must still be floating around out there somewhere... or was this a reference to ""Contact"", the film where old TV broadcasts were eventually picked up by aliens in star systems light years away?)

Next comes the title, ""The Fandom Menace,"" and a pretty good rendition of Dark Vapor's ship chasing the ConsolationPrize (The Enterprise with propellers!) From here, it cuts to the Trek puppets -- but only two of the ConsolationPrize's crew, because, as they explain, the rest just weren't in the budget.  Future scenes combine CGI with physical sets, spoofing Star Wars, Star Trek, The Terminator, X-Files, RoboCop, 2001, etc. and ending with the destruction of the Terrible Thing that caused the rift in the Space-Time Continuum in the first place.  (Sorry, no spoilers here --you'll just have to watch the movie for yourself.)",1124582400,12,2704,4.896703296703297
7964961,5,B0000694Z5,I don't remember laughing harder than when i watched this movie.  This movie is awesome.  A must see for fans of Star Wars/Star trek or any sci fi,1040774400,6,146,4.178571428571429
7964962,4,B0000694Z5,I thought the movie was great.  Involving all those characters in one movie was brilliant.  I recommend it if you want to laugh at some stupid stuff or just laugh in general.,1037059200,6,174,4.40625
7964963,3,B0000694Z5,"This 32 minute Claymation movie, which bears all the signs of being a student film project produced on a budget of four packs of bubblegum and a cheese sandwich, does have a redeeming virtue.  Unlike the live-action, multimillion dollar budgeted Spaceballs from Mel Brooks, this offering by Pete Schuermann & his band of fellow SF fans is moderately amusing instead of draggingly dull.  It's clear that they, unlike Brooks, actually understand the genre, a necessity before it can be sent up.

The plot is simple.  A warp in the fabric of spacetime has thrown Darth Vader, James Kirk and Mr. Spock (Star Warp'd uses satirical names, but it's easier to write it this way) into our universe in the present day.  Kirk and Spock are informed by 2001's Starchild that the Monolith controlling spacetime is broken and they must fix it before the multiverses fall into a state of complete higgledy-piggledy.  (Starchild sounds and acts remarkably like Sean Connery, by the by.) Vader summons the Alien, the Terminator and the Predator to fight for the Bad Guys; while Kirk and Spock summon Robocop and E.T. to fight for the good guys, and they have it out in a way that suggests Celebrity Deathmatch at the World Science Fiction Convention.

The action is mostly an amalgam of the high points in Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back; but there are cameos and homages to The X-Files, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Austin Powers:  The Spy Who Shagged Me, The War of the Worlds, Dr. Strangelove, T.J. Hooker and even the old Roadrunner-Wile E. Coyote cartoons.  The most satisfying moment, however, may be in the tag, where the Starchild requires both sides to cooperate in the elimination of the greatest menace the universes have ever known.

All in all, it's moderately amusing and fun to watch to pick up the references.  Best viewed with a bunch of friends after consuming a six-pack of beer and with popcorn to throw at the screen.",1035849600,29,1985,4.8088235294117645
7964964,4,B0000694Z5,"There are a lot of parody films out. The bulk of these are sci-fi parodies, poking fun or hilariously saluting great sci-fi movies. Many of them are just plain awful, with terrible writing and bad acting. STAR WARP'D isn't like that. The acting can't be bad because it's just a bunch of clay puppets and the writing is great, stealing not only characters but lines from great movies as well.

Now, granted there are a lot of poop jokes here. Farting falls in the realm of very crude, low brow humor. It's the kind of thing that little kids find funny. It's also the kind of thing that shows you aren't taking yourself too seriously, thereby avoiding possible legal troubles while at the same time expanding your potential market base.

Anyway, the plot of the story basically has characters (well, they are warped versions of the characters) from several sci-fi movies in the same universe because the space-time continuum has been torn apart by a mysterious object, a Monolith. The good guys from Star Trek are trying to keep the Monolith from being stolen by the bad guys from STAR WARS. What ensues is cool, hilarious parody.
The DVD includes a four-minute preview of the possible upcoming sequel, an audio commentary by the film's makers, and some behind the scenes footage.",1034985600,12,1278,4.778280542986425
