8748936,4,B01AYQRK3E,"A very well-constructed, thought provoking film. So interesting to see how three couples who are all friends get together expecting a relaxing weekend ,and end up really dealing with important issues that they have a couples ,and are able to resolve them .All three couples seem to really love, not only each other, but their partners. As result the weekend is a great catalyst to resolve issues that any couple could face at times.

Beautiful Fire Island after tourist season, bits of humor in the dialogue ,and some surprises along the way make the film enjoyable on many levels. Would recommend this film to anyone, regardless of their sexual orientation, wanting to learn about how to communicate about thorny issues with their partners, and resolve the issues through remembering the love they have for their partners and friends.",1475625600,3,835,5.050724637681159

8748940,1,B01AYQRK3E,"I saw this film on Netfix, but because there aren't many reviews here I wanted to offer an opinion. The setting, (couples ferried away from the big city to Fire Island, The Vineyard, Hamptons, or wherever-doesn't really matter, we've seen it a million times), is hackneyed. Also, hackneyed, the underlying reasons for the getaway--relationship rescues.  The couples are boring, uninteresting and the acting uninspired. We are not the least bit interested in them. Heck, the actors are not that great to look at--yes, superficial I know, but in the absence of character development, what's left! While relationship work is difficult, this film does not provide ANY insight on how the work might be different. These couples are very immature, petty, petulant and go round n round and never break through with any meaningful evaluations or reflections regarding their relationship stalemates,  until at the end they make a very ridiculous and obvious discovery, which was actually telegraphed loud and clear in the first two minutes of the film. I absolutely saw this coming. Frustratingly, the
discovery does little to propel these couples out of the core of their stale relationships, but it provides a slight comic relief from the boredom of watching this film.",1466121600,3,1261,5.206896551724138
8748941,3,B01AYQRK3E,"This movie is a bit depressing...Explores a variety of issues people have in relationships...quite realistic, but sort of depressing...on the other hand if you are into it, might get four stars",1462406400,,193,5.258064516129032
