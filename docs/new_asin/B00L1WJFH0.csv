8663242,3,B00L1WJFH0,"First of all the title claims five movies. that's not correct. there is only two whole movies and five shorts. now with that's out of the way, let me tell you my opinion.

The titles are:
1) The Dead Outside
2) Not Even Death
3) Plague
4) Zombeer
5) Skin of Your Teeth
6) Stag Night of the Dead
7) Zombie Harvest

first the two whole movies: The Dead Outside, Stag Night of the Dead

The Dead Outside wasn't really about zombies so much. Acting was so-so and the story was dull. didn't see much infected until the end and even then they weren't zombies but rather just crazed people. I'd skip this movie. Your not missing much

Stag Night of the Dead is I'm guessing a UK movie. Even though it isn't Shawn of the Dead, it does offer a decent story with a plot twist in the end. The acting was good and the storyline was a little bizarre. There isn't much zombie killing but a far share of zombie attacks. SO I would watch this one.

Last the short films: Not Even Death, Plague, Zombeer, Skin of Your Teeth, Zombie Harvest

These are short films that are at most 15 minutes long. if you want to watch all back to back then I'd suggest choosing Skin of Your Teeth then it will go through each film back to back. They are made by an independent film company called Vanguard. The zombie makeup is a lot like the kind you could buy at Halloween but it doesn't really take from the stories. After watching I have to say they are all decent in the story department. As their name would suggest Zombeer and Zombie Harvest aren't golden but offer a little comedy to the Zombieverse. Not Even Death offers a side of the one fool trying to hope for a cure for a loved one. Skin of Your Teeth and Plague are about survivors to the Zombie Apocalypse. These two I have to save could have been made into full featured films and I would have watched them. These two almost make the pay worth it, just a shame that they are only 10-15 minutes long.

My over all opinion is if your looking for a Walking Dead or Shawn of the Dead, I wouldn't bother. However if your looking for a Zombie set for the Zombie collection then you might want to give this one a shot. I have to say I don't regret buying this set. It was entertaining and something I recommend for those lazy days of moving watching. I wouldn't buy a HEAVY price for this but if it's cheap then I say go for it. The 3/5 is just because while it isn't surprising that there aren't any hidden treasures like you'd might like, there are some decentness to some of the works. like I said Stag Night of the Dead, Plague, and Skin of Your Teeth are good so it was worth the price.",1417824000,,2617,4.201195219123506
