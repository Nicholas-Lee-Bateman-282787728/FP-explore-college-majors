8059481,5,B0009DWW5O,"Nido Qubein is amazing. Every time I've heard him in person, (or via CD or DVD), I walk away as a better person and stronger leader. This training session is in classic Nido style, so keep your notebook handy since he fires idea after idea at you, with powerful principles to light your fires of personal motivation and keep you focused on lasting success. He is a masterful communicator and you won't be disappointed because you'll stay so involved in his transformational teaching style that you'll want to watch it any time you need to creatively think outside the box to be your personal best.",1219449600,,597,4.695238095238095

of English and only $50 in your picket . . . that same individual
is now a multi-millionaire, international consultant, author, and
lecturer.

I recently got to hear him speak on an inspirational CD, NIDO
QUBEIN LIVE! . . . subtitled HOW TO GET ANYTHING YOU
WANT: PROVEN STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS & SIGNIFICANCE,
it promised much . . . though I'm not quite sure I can now get
quite anything I want, I did nevertheless pick up many useful
tips and/or reminders of things that I should be doing.

Among them:
* Value is the ability to solve problems.

* If you want to be happy, hang around with happy people.

* I read newspapers at night. I read books and listen to tapes in the
morning because they inspire me.

* Every day I call on four or more of my clients.

* I treat all of my customers as if I'm going to lose them.

* The easier it is for somebody to duplicate what you do, the less
valuable you've become.

And my favorite that I'm going to start doing right away:
* I've gotten rid of my alarm clock and replaced it with an
opportunity clock.",1211587200,3,1113,4.241706161137441
