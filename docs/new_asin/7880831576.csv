7900446,5,7880831576,"You're Beautiful is the best television series I have ever had the pleasure to view! The stars are
handsome and talented. Park Shin Hye's character is cute and innocent. This series has everything;
comedy, drama, good scripts, and great songs. It is no wonder that this show has a worldwide
fan base, and memorabilia that sells out in record time!",1309651200,,347,4.8
7900447,4,7880831576,"A great movie with alot of drama.  There were ticker tape banners on the bottom of the screen that appears to be stock market information.  Very annoying.  Disc 7 and 8 English translation were poorly done (typo errors and wrong context).  Also, the Korean names were changed to Chinese names in the last two disc.",1301184000,3,314,4.654545454545454
