8637800,5,B00I099JFK,"What is there to say except this is a great documentary on the greatest president in my lifetime. And considering that the last 7 1/2 years has been a slooooowww, painful walk through hell with a completely incompetent traitor posing as the POTUS, I purchased this to remind myself how I felt years ago--patriotic and proud. Ronald Reagan was a true leader. He made America BELIEVE in ourselves, our values, our constitution, and our place in the world hierarchy. Sadly, that is all crumbling before our eyes. The silver lining is that at least he is not here to see it. He deserves better. We all do.

The DVDs are roughly 6 hours of speeches, memorable moments, and commentary from some friends, colleagues, and media. Very interesting to hear these other people's perspectives on his policies and values--- both personal and professional. A great introduction to President Reagan possibly for younger people who were not blessed to have lived during the 80's. Sure, the past wasn't ALL good, and yes, President Reagan did make mistakes....but considering the vast contrast to today's world---I'd say it was the most hopeful time in the last 50 years.",1461196800,6,1153,4.943298969072165
8637801,4,B00I099JFK,A very good and complete biography. However it does come off like the videos you watched in school. The second disc with all the speeches is fantastic.,1455580800,,151,4.62962962962963
8637802,5,B00I099JFK,This is a unique review of the life of Ronald Reagan.
