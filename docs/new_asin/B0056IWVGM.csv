8459685,5,B0056IWVGM,"Serbian Scars is an intensely atmospheric piece.  There is a distinct visual style at play here.  Michael Madsen is at the top of his game as the protagonist.  The editing is top-notch, keeping the audience involved from the beginning frame.  The terrific multi-layered score also elevates the film.",1371340800,,299,5.166666666666667
