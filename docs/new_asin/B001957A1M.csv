3422626,1,B001957A1M,"Based on other reviews I expected good family entertainment. Sadly, this show
offers only disgusting, failed attempts at humor along with a script that's
painful to watch. We consider this purchase a complete waste of money.",1293494400,,224,5.25
3422627,5,B001957A1M,Far better than any of the several Rin Tin Tin films I have seen earlier.  The plot and acting are excellent.  A great kids / family movie.,1293148800,4,139,4.111111111111111
3422628,5,B001957A1M,"I bought this film for my grandson and didn't expect to enjoy it so much myself.  It's a sweet film, all the more interesting being it is based on the true story of Rinty.  Not only is it entertaining, especially so for dog lovers,  but there is nothing in it that would keep you from sharing it with children of any age (no bad language or the usual hollywood crap)  I would recommend this film for anyone with children to add to their movie library.",1260748800,5,451,4.270588235294118
3422629,1,B001957A1M,"Since this movie's creation and release I learned that it is not a Rin Tin Tin dog in the movie, but dogs from a Bolivian breeder.  It is not based on the actual Rin Tin Tin line and is a total shame on the trademark name of Rin Tin Tin.  This is a lawsuit in the making and I only hope the owners of the REAL Rin Tin TIn do something about it.  You can go to the actual Rin Tin Tin web site and find out  that the makers of this movie knew at the time that they were violating the trademark and released it anyway.  The entire movie is a lie that can only hurt the Rin TIn TIn name.",1253923200,3,583,3.7459016393442623
3422630,5,B001957A1M,"As a Baby Boomer I grew up with Rin Tin Tin on Tv and on the big screen. I did not hope for much when I ordered this film but I really enjoyed it and have viewed it multiple times. I have ordered it for gifts as well. I hope this company will take this team and do more fun movies with this team and represent Rin Tin Tin to several new eploits in the future. Buy it, Keep it!",1233014400,12,376,3.7125
3422631,5,B001957A1M,"I am very pleased with this DVD and with the folks that I bought it from. great transaction. Thanks. And the movie is a delight, especially for us who loves GSD. I recommend it to all.",1231459200,,184,4.138888888888889
3422632,5,B001957A1M,"Very cute. I loved the dog in this movie - I wish I could have one just like him. This is a good one to sit down and watch with the whole family on a lazy Sunday afternoon. This dog is smart! And he looks out for people, like his master and the boy who gets lost - a really fun and loving story.",1225324800,13,295,3.625
3422633,4,B001957A1M,"First Look brings us a fantastic family film based on the classic Dog ""Rin Tin Tin"".
I def recommend this movie for the kids, it felt like a classic tv show with nothing but clean fun and laughs.
The dog(s) are completely entertaining.

I really enjoyed it and it will serve well to introduce new kids to the story.",1223164800,10,315,4.338983050847458

3422650,4,B001957A1M,"Thoroughly enjoyable, Finding Rin Tin Tin served a small story in a big helping. Big movie production qualities showed throughout the film set in World War I. Perhaps best of all, this tale brings a forgotten story to the forefront. From the time Rinty was found and saved by Lee Duncun (played convincingly by Tyler Jensen) to where he becomes the best-loved dog ever in Hollywood (sorry, Lassie), one is captured by his daring-do in times of peril and the warmth of his personality.",1425945600,2,484,4.773809523809524
3422651,1,B001957A1M,"Truly appalling. The approach, script and production are terrible. Saying the film is geared for children and thus can be played 'broadly' is a rotten excuse. Don't talk down to children: they'll sense it, and adults hate it. The recent 'Lassie' film shows how a story about a dog can be done respectfully. Inspector Rex has garish murders and nudity to denote this is adult entertainment, not really necessary I feel, but helping to let us know that this is not cutesy pie rubbish for the lowest common denominator. Steven Spilberg's 'War Horse' was trite but sincere: maybe he could have a whack at 'War Dog'!",1425168000,,611,4.773584905660377
3422652,4,B001957A1M,Based on a true story.  No wonder Rin Tin Tin set the bar so high,1423958400,,65,3.3333333333333335

3422655,1,B001957A1M,"Although we watched it all the way to the end, it was way too cheesy for us to recommend. I imagine kiddos would like it and find it funny.",1413676800,,139,3.8275862068965516
3422666,4,B001957A1M,Retro movies remind me of the type of movies I saw as a young person. RinTin Tin is a gorgeous animal and evryone in the movie was personable. Based on a true story.,1413676800,,165,4.03030303030303
3422667,5,B001957A1M,Kids loved it! It kept my interest too.  Funny and the dog was adorable.,1412812800,,72,4.142857142857143

3422675,1,B001957A1M,"Sounded like it was based on the true story of Rin Tin Tin, but it was pretty goofy at times.  More like a kid show.",1408406400,,116,3.64
3422696,3,B001957A1M,I've raised GSD's for 32 years and currently have one from a rescue kennel. I enjoyed the movie but because I'm pretty familiar with German Shepherd dogs I thought it was not quite a true depiction of the breed. It also appeared more than one dog played the part of the adult dog.,1407715200,,280,4.30188679245283
3422697,5,B001957A1M,A great movie with quirky comedic touches that the whole family will like.,1407542400,,74,4.769230769230769

3422700,3,B001957A1M,"A vintage movie, great for young children, not at all like the TV show, a lot of slapstick comedy",1406505600,,97,4.157894736842105
3422701,5,B001957A1M,Good movie for all,1405728000,,18,3.75
3422702,3,B001957A1M,Was disappointed by the locker room humor. The military officers didn't seem believable.,1404864000,,88,5.846153846153846
3422703,3,B001957A1M,The story line was good but the comedic parts were so fake that we finished watching it just to see if it would continue to make us shake our heads. We thought it was a serious war time movie not an attempt at a comedy.,1404691200,,219,3.888888888888889
3422704,5,B001957A1M,My granddaughter love this movie! It was great she love it. I hope you give a try very funny loving movie.,1404000000,,106,4.095238095238095
3422705,2,B001957A1M,"I watched this, because I love dogs.  Maybe children may finding this entertaining.  I found it rather corny, silly and some the special effects were so fake.  It was ok.  I was disappointed in the over all quality of the film.",1403827200,,227,4.463414634146342
3422706,3,B001957A1M,"Was just trying out Prime.  Selected this movie as trial.  Cute movie, sweet  theme.  Can't beat a dog hero with a sense of humor.",1403827200,,130,4.291666666666667

3422708,4,B001957A1M,Nice movie to sit down and watch with the grandchildren. They laughed and enjoyed the movie a lot and I could watch and be entertained also. Movie was made in the fashion of the golden age of Hollywood .,1401667200,,203,4.230769230769231
3422709,3,B001957A1M,I am a new member of Prime so I started with some free movies.  I liked it because it was an interesting story and I love GSDs.,1401408000,,127,3.7037037037037037
3422710,2,B001957A1M,It is funny to watch movies like this one that for example have 1928-1930 cars during WWI.  Childish filming is not desired and demeans the old Rin Tin Tin character.,1401235200,,166,4.533333333333333
3422711,5,B001957A1M,"This movie was delightful, lighthearted, funny, entertaining and for those who want an escape this was it!  You can't hlep but smile.",1401148800,,133,5.045454545454546
3422712,5,B001957A1M,Everyone will enjoy this movie as it has it all and Rin Tin Tin was a wonderful character. Wish there were more movies like this,1399939200,,128,4.16
3422713,1,B001957A1M,"Well, I was expecting something a bit more mature, in depth realistic biography of one of Hollywoods biggest animal stars.  instead, I mostly watched a pratfall leaden, overly childish fable about the finding of Rin Tin TIn.  the actors did their best with the script, which wasn't much, sad to say.  the characters were either made up out of whole cloth and out of a pantomime, or to noble and broad to be real.  there were NO in between characters, either completely evil or white charger good.  and how did the mute slavey little boy to the evil fat cook ever get out of development?  so much slapstick and schtick even for Laurel and Hardy movie.  I think they tried to ""tug at the heartstrings"" with fabricated myths when the truth is much more touching and interesting.  I was VERY disappointed with this movie, so much I kept fast forwarding thru the cook beating the boy scenes and then thru the evil American captain scenes until I finally just gave up and turned it off.  I would recommend you skip this horrible movie and go and read Susan Orleans book.  It's VERY well written and much more interesting.",1399334400,,1115,4.585858585858586
3422714,3,B001957A1M,I thought this movie was going to be kind of a history of Rin Tin Tin.  I liked it but there were too many parts that were obviously not things that really happened.  Probably ok for children who don't know anything about Rin Tin Tin.,1398988800,,234,4.177777777777778
3422715,5,B001957A1M,Was Avery good movie. I had never seen this before and didn't know it was a real dog. Thank you,1398470400,,95,3.8

3422727,4,B001957A1M,"The movie props were very obvious, and the backdrops were so fake.  The acting was also horrible, and the scene with the crying child could have been more convincing if he had more realistic tears..",1393632000,,198,4.6571428571428575
3422728,5,B001957A1M,The kids couldn't stop laughing...and it is cool that the movie is based on a true story.  I would recommend this movie.,1393286400,,120,4.454545454545454
3422729,4,B001957A1M,"my granddaughter enjoyed watching Rin Tin Tin and went home and explained the whole show to her mom..
there were a few spots that were unbelievable but entertaining...",1392768000,,167,5.0
3422730,4,B001957A1M,An enjoyable family movie you do not have to worry about content.  Spurred a little history question from Grandson even.,1392681600,,120,5.0
3422731,3,B001957A1M,The story was good but they could have left out some of the crude remarks.  I would not recommend this to parents.  It was good quality and came very quickly.,1392595200,,158,4.233333333333333
3422732,4,B001957A1M,"Good movie though some of the stunts are a bit sad, but keeping in mind that it was made several years ago I enjoyed it and the action kept the young one watching it with me entertained",1392422400,,185,4.027027027027027
3422733,5,B001957A1M,"Well done modern remake of this family classic! Done for a younger audience with family friendliness in mind. Perfect for the dog lover with a family, or the older kid at heart. If you remember the old serials, you will love this one!",1391990400,,234,4.465116279069767
3422734,4,B001957A1M,"For those who love dogs and a not quite accurate account of WWI, this is for the entire family. Keeping and training a German Shepard pup isn't all that simple but it offers lessons for us all. Of course Rin Tin Tin has a story complete with a French soldier's good luck charm, a 'little boy lost,' a greedy cook, and a German soldier (POW) who knows how to help. A soldier's tale that warms the heart. There are the good guys, the bad guys and a way to tell the difference!

One reviewer commented that it 'was a bit over the top.' Of course it is but in a good way. Good cast and well presented.

Another review mentioned how much Rin Tin Tin was incorporated within the history of television. Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, The Lone Ranger? An era remembered, a past to enjoy and an introduction for those who haven't met the past.

Definitely recommended and grandchild approved!",1390176000,,879,4.41358024691358
3422735,5,B001957A1M,My son started watching this movie on his kindle.  He has watched it at least five times in the last five days.  Very good movie for kids! ! And adults with a heart.,1389052800,,165,3.9696969696969697
3422746,5,B001957A1M,Great movie it's a must see for all who used to watch rin tintin as a kid. Good story and gives back ground about the dog,1387152000,,121,3.6923076923076925
3422747,2,B001957A1M,"I love dogs, but this movie was hookey. It was set in WWI but had cars from the late 20s. Too much was implausable.",1385942400,,115,3.8333333333333335
3422748,2,B001957A1M,"Low production quality, lots of historical errors, and pretty campy.

3422749,4,B001957A1M,"While the historical look at WW1 was interesting to the adults, the heart warming story of the puppy caught the children's attention.
The fact that the story was based on fact was a plus.",1381622400,,187,4.529411764705882
3422750,5,B001957A1M,Great movie for the family or anyone.  A true feel good movie that you can watch over and over.  Highly recommend this one,1380412800,,122,4.260869565217392

3422752,4,B001957A1M,"I really, really enjoyed this one and could relate as I am an animal lover and he would have won me over also. It also shows how we should treat one another (people) and not judge. There is good in all people no matter what or where they are from or what nationality they are. When fighting a war men become pawns of the two countries and men fighting or disagreeing. Doesn't mean that the men fighting all feel the same.",1377216000,3,421,4.209876543209877

3422789,3,B001957A1M,"This is good family fun, that is if you believe 2-dimensional characters performing slapstick humor is your slingshot to the simpler times.  I didn't grow up watching the 3 stooges, but my uncles did.  Therefore, it is always good fun in the family when you have somebody who can reminisce about this type of comedy, but it doesn't really resonate with me.  FYI, I watched Disney and Ghibli Studio productions growing up; and Ghibli productions in general all have very complex character developments with very moving plot lines.  I guess I was hoping to find the same in this film, because after all who says kids can't appreciate complex characters and storylines!

All in all, a good relaxing evening if you've got nothing better to do.",1357689600,,739,4.833333333333333

I can remember watching descendents of Rin Tin Tin on TV when I was growing up so knowing the story of the original Rin Tin Tin is great.",1302480000,,245,4.020408163265306
3422795,5,B001957A1M,"The naysayers can spew whatever they like, but this was an excellent family movie.  IT was not meant to be ultra-serious, but meant to bring joy, and at times, laughter to the entire family. Ben Cross does a wonderful job as the trainer, showing that character's love for the animals throughout.  He teaches valuable lessons about respecting animals, and since I am part Native American that was a very important aspect of the theme to me.  The cast was very conscientious about what was to be brought to life in their characters.

This movie is great for kids of any age and I highly recommend it.",1295222400,5,598,4.613207547169812

Considering it is a movie set in the midst of WW1, I think they did a great job sheltering younger audiences from the horrors of war while telling the endearing true story of Rin Tin Tin.

Our dog enjoyed it, too!",1519603200,,353,4.348484848484849

8271901,4,B001957A1M,"Rin Tin Tin is one of the most popular legendary dogs often compared with Lassie, Hachi. The dog is best known as the Hollywood star dog appearing in a number of films during 20s and 30s. This Rin Tin Tin, however, is loosely based on real story. But besides the fact, that the German Shepherd was found in France during World World I by American Battalion soldiers and sent to the U.S. The exploits shown in this film are most totally a fiction. (Saving a penny is the biggest reason, I guess). The film captures the good ol' film style during the golden age of the Hollywood reminding me of Keaton and Chaplin.

It is very entertaining film for the dog lovers.",1462320000,,662,4.426229508196721
8271902,4,B001957A1M,"A heart-warming story filled with realistic World War I scenes in France sets the tone for discovering the true story of the most popular dog star in Hollywood, along with Lassie. Tyler Jensen plays the role of Lee Duncan, the American pilot who found the young German Shepard. Rin Tin Tin survived a bombing at the dog kennel in a very touching moment; Duncan's work to save him while a war progresses really tears at the heart. Jensen's ability to express happiness alongside of emotional pain shines remarkable; it's not an easy feat. He is one of the better young actors for this genre. The professional French critics wouldn't like it, seeing that it reflects happiness and love. This film, however, inspires and uplifts a viewer unless so crusty of soul that love of a dog and it's partner doesn't move you.",1460246400,,813,4.732394366197183
