I recommend this film for every fan of this great artist.",1370304000,,129,4.909090909090909
5528930,5,B00AZ43C5Q,I am a Jazz pianist and vocalist and I have been a fan of Erroll Garner FOREVER. It is HIGH TIME a documentary came out about this amazing artist. I am so pleased to be able to learn more about his life story. This is a great DVD and a MUST SEE for Jazz fans and musicians.,1366934400,2,273,3.807017543859649
5528931,5,B00AZ43C5Q,Erroll Garner has been overlooked for many years. I'm glad after 36 years since he passed away he's finally being recognized for the great musician he was.,1366588800,2,155,4.777777777777778
5528932,5,B00AZ43C5Q,"There are probably 50 film documentaries on Louis Armstrong and probably as many about Duke Ellington but this is the first one about jazz pianist Erroll Garner. As the film's director explains in fine-minute ""Director's Commentary - one of 4 short bonus features on the DVD - he heard Garner's classic song ""Misty"" while he was in film school and, in searching, found no full biography of Garner in either book or film form. He was lucky to find Garner's sister as a source of family stories about growing up in Pittsburgh and some early family photos. The project started in 1996 and wasn't completed until 2011. Director Brady was able to obtain extensive interviews with musician/author/""Tonight Show"" host/comedian Steve Allen (a huge Garner fan) and jazz pianist (ragtime to bop) Dick Hyman. There are also interviews with record producer George Avakian, tap dancer Maurice Hines (who choreographed a piece dedicated to Garner) and Woody Allen. Jim Doran who wrote a book about Garner's music career (but not a bio) as well as Garner's last bassist add to the interviews. There is performance footage (mostly from European TV - licensed from Reelin' in The Years who released it as part of their Jazz Icons DVD series. No full performances are here. The film runs just 53 minutes.
The bonus features include the above mentioned five-minute commentary, ""extended interviews"" with Allen and Hyman (about 2  minutes each) and a two-minute clip of Doran explaining the ""possible"" origin of Garner's best-known composition, ""Misty"".
Very-well and long overdue, this DVD is a must for jazz fans. It's the first in what appears to be a ""jazz"" series of DVDs coming from First Run Features (similar to their ""food"" series of documentaries). I, for one, can hardly wait.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5528933,5,B00AZ43C5Q,"A fascinating documentary on one of jazz music's greatest geniuses, featuring fine interviews with celebrities, family, and other jazz legends. A pleasure from start to finish. Thanks to the filmmaker for this timely and important work on one of jazz music's neglected giants. If you love Erroll Garner's amazing music, you will thoroughly enjoy!",1363824000,8,346,5.425925925925926
5528934,5,B00AZ43C5Q,I had the pleasure of meeting Erroll in 1955 when I was a graduate student at the U of Pittsburgh.  And then again around 1970 was able to sit and talk with at the Ramada Inn in St. Louis.  He will forever be my favorite.  I have most all of his LP's & CDs.,1415145600,,257,3.7222222222222223

5528936,5,B00AZ43C5Q,"I don't pretend to be very knowledgeable on the subject of Jazz or music in general but I know what I like when I hear it.  And I've heard an awful lot over many, many years.  I wore out my first of album of ""Concert by the Sea"".  (Thank goodness CD's came along.)
So I am a long time fan of Errol Garner.  This documentary alternately made me smile and brought tears to my eyes and frequently brought back wonderful memories.  At the same time it left me wishing for more - if only there were more out there somewhere.  This is not a concert, although there are many snippets of old favorites.  It is life story with many facts I was previously unaware of.  I absolutely loved it.",1400716800,5,681,4.224806201550388
5528937,5,B00AZ43C5Q,"I got this for my fiance, who loves Erroll Garner, and he loved it (he didn't know it existed until I bought it for him)...so I am giving it 5 stars!!!",1395619200,,151,3.903225806451613
5528938,4,B00AZ43C5Q,"This documentary filled a need left by the paucity of much in terms of biographical material (as noted in other reviews). Some of the interview footage (such as the clips with Mike Douglas and Johnny Carson, brief as those were) shed light (however unwittingly) on the more profound questions of actualizing abstractions (issues all composers, poets, sculptors, painters and even software designers grapple with in the course of unleashing creative juices).",1385424000,,457,5.450704225352113
5528939,4,B00AZ43C5Q,I liked it but it wasn't long enough and didn't have enough full performances. Could have delved into his past a little more.,1384905600,,125,4.478260869565218
5528940,5,B00AZ43C5Q,"I had the pleasure of seeing Errol Garner at the St. Denis Theatre in Montreal in 1959. What a concert. I have been a fan ever since. Concert by the Sea. My all time favourite.
The story was well done. 5 stars.

The musical examples as well as the interviews, with special attention to the latter, were in a form that I have never seen before. I have researched Erroll Garner in the past and was never able to find the personal
statements let alone the video interviews with this obviously very gifted man.  This is a must have for any fan of Erroll Garner.",1429920000,,418,4.4868421052631575
