The overall TV series is a good replica of Ancient Rome with accurate clothing, houses, and the speech was very well narrated.",1528502400,,294,4.462962962962963

8394580,5,B003CYOOE4,"I have watched the 1st season of The Roman Mysteries and I enjoyed the stories.  I must confess that i learned something about Rome and the people who lived, as portrayed, at that time.  I enjoyed the performances by all the actors, especially the four principles (the four children).  The writing and direction were excellent.  I read a review of this series and the reviewer said that this series was for children.  And this reviewer was critical of a couple of the children.  I disagree.  If this series is for children, then I must be one of them.  As for the actors portraying them, I thought all four of them played their roles magnificently.",1495756800,,648,4.62280701754386
