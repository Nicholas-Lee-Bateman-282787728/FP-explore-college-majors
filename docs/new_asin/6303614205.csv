I've kept the item because I don't have the time to return it. I communicated this to the seller; the seller merely offered an apology which, as a gentleman, I accepted but, I'd hoped they'd offer me a refund but...no such thing happened. A word to the wise. I've no intention of buying anything from this seller again.",1408924800,,509,4.483870967741935
