4112283,4,B003DW1EC0,"I am intermediate-advanced in Pilates. I was in search of a true pilates workout that flowed from one move to the next with little down-time. I also wanted more advanced moves to work up to, such as corkscrew and jackknife. This routine has all of those things, and goes at a pace that makes you sweat and feel like you are really using your strength through the entire workout. I have been doing the video about twice a week intermixed with my other workouts, and my core strength is greatly improved. My one complaint is 2 or 3 times in the workout she does stop to explain something that takes much too long, and her student is just lying there. I find myself either continuing the previous move, adding one of my own while she talks, or if my remote is nearby, fast forwarding. But VERY solid workout for someone seeking a challenge.",1380326400,9,837,4.477124183006536
4112284,5,B003DW1EC0,"This series/ instructor is wonderful.  She is calm, statuesque, and patient - at the end of her workouts, you feel like you've worked oput with your best friend rather than having been pummelled by some hyperperky blond thing that makes you feel inferior no matter what you do.  This series is perfect for all ability types because she is so good at explaining everything she does, and you can go at your own speed.  I lost 12 lbs. the first 2 weeks and was amazed to find that one could sweat like a dog on the space of a mat...",1361059200,12,529,4.27
4112285,5,B003DW1EC0,Great video. Well instructed. Jennier always does a nice job in educating her viewers. I would recommend this video for sure.,1354492800,2,125,5.0
4112286,4,B003DW1EC0,Good workout but you need to be an advanced level to enjoy it.  I wish Jennifer Kries would explain less and do all the movement one after the other.,1335225600,,149,4.137931034482759
4112287,5,B003DW1EC0,I have been doing Pilates dvds with Jennifer for over 11 years. THIS DVD TAKES IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL! I highly recommend it for anyone ready to amp it up!,1281398400,5,153,3.967741935483871
4112288,5,B003DW1EC0,"I am relatively new to pilates, and have been using Stott for about three months. With the Stott advanced I was getting to the point of the workout being exhausting but productive and do like the DVD
When I bought Jennifer Kries Pilates III I did enjoy the fast pace and did feel totally regenerated without being exhausted
So now, you can mark me as a JK fan and I would like to see more DVDs like this from her",1279238400,7,412,4.1625
4112289,4,B003DW1EC0,I really like this workout but Jennifer moves too quickly from one pose to another and it's hard to follow her.,1277510400,3,111,4.333333333333333
8394988,5,B003DW1EC0,Jennifer Kries always has quality material. This dvd is NOT for a novice. She always has great curing.,1503792000,,102,4.722222222222222
8394989,3,B003DW1EC0,"For a level three it's not that challenging. Plus, I wish instructors would clue in and stop instructing for first time viewing. They never seem to realize that you're going to be watching the video multiple times and the introductory cueing is going to get tedious. There's a lot of stop and go due to talking from the instructor in this and a ton of referencing to t the levels that came before. I never watched those levels so it's a little irritating. I would expect each video to stand on it's own and to be presented in a way I want to do again and again. The workout is okay. If you're advanced, this will feel like a beginning level. I hardly broke a sweat.",1493251200,3,665,4.285714285714286
8394990,4,B003DW1EC0,"I love Jennifer Kries' style and Pilates workouts and have many of her DVDs.  This is a great faster pace you would find in a Pilates class.  I was expecting it to be a longer workout than 35 min though (the DVD says 1hr total, with a 9min extra workout). But it leaves enough time to add another activity and still get a good solid Pilates workout in.  My favorite DVD is still her Pilates Precision Toning and Sculpting.  It was the first one I bought years ago and still the best one (also has more reps per exercise).",1463270400,,521,4.232323232323233
8394991,2,B003DW1EC0,It is not as advertised.  The product came on time and was well packaged but it was not as advertised.,1435536000,,102,4.1
8394992,5,B003DW1EC0,"After consistently working out 3-4 times a week for 5 years doing mostly barre (Physique 57, Tracey Mallett, Tracy Anderson, Jennifer Galardi, Barre 3, etc., along with more conventional fitness dvds from Jillian Michaels and Jari Love, among others), I found this high level of pilates refreshing and challenging in just the right amount.  But what I'm happiest about is that all the moves are easy on my knees!  I'm 55 and all those squats and lunges from the past 5 years are starting to take their toll so it's nice to take a break and work the muscles and flexibility in a new way.  I highly recommend it!",1417478400,7,610,4.577981651376147
8394993,5,B003DW1EC0,Jennifer does an excellent job of instructing you to do moves the correct way without hurting yourself.,1416441600,2,103,5.117647058823529
8394994,5,B003DW1EC0,Tough workout. Very challenging for balance. Worth the money.,1407715200,3,61,5.888888888888889
8394995,5,B003DW1EC0,"It really spices up my usual Pilates routine I've been doing for years.  This one adds some fun new challenging moves the old familiar moves.  And I like Jennifer Kries.  I've been using a lot of her workout programs including the older Method programs.  She is as always perfectly beautiful, elegant, and professional.  Love the workout.",1407715200,2,338,4.964285714285714
8394996,4,B003DW1EC0,Great.  Have Jennifer's Perfect Mix and Precision and use them all the time.  This had some knew and harder moves.,1405036800,3,114,4.65
8394997,4,B003DW1EC0,whoa!!!! This DOES work your abs.  I like Kries very much and am of moderate fitness and I can't finish the routine yet.,1404604800,3,120,4.217391304347826
