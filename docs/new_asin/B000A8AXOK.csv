8076215,4,B000A8AXOK,"This package is a real bargain. Released by Diamond Entertainment in 2004, you can now find this set of FIVE films on 2 DVDs, professionally packaged, for about six bucks (everyday price) at Dollar General stores, which is where I bought mine.

The films included are:

(disc one)

1. Death Rides a Horse, (1969, 115 minutes)

2. God's Gun, (1975, 93 minutes)

(disc two)

3. The Grand Duel, (1973, 92 minutes)

4. Kid Vengeance, (1977, 61 minutes)

5. Beyond the Law, 1968, 78 minutes)

All were filmed in Italy with certain scenes of ""God's Gun"" and ""Kid Vengeance"" being filmed in Israel. Jim Brown also stars in ""Kid Vengeance"".

All five films are in COLOR and the aspect is FULL-SCREEN. You can expect standard formula Spaghetti Westerns, pretty bloody and violent for both the era and the genre.

The discs themselves have interactive menus with some film information, facts and trivia, and a Lee Van Cleef biography. There is also a ""Direct Scene Access"" feature to have immediate access to favorite scenes. There are no alternative language options -- all five films are conveyed in English.

The prints of all these films are somewhat less than perfect (""mediocre"") but the sound quality is fairly good. The video is pretty clear, somewhat grainy at times, but there is also the occasional glitch in the film, nothing too horrific.

While there is no Clint Eastwood in these 60s Drive-in Theater films they are still well-worth watching if you're at all a western fan. Lee Van Cleef pretty much nails the viewers' attention and not one of these movies lacks for action.

A great bargain for this unusually low price -- highly recommended.",1212624000,,1648,4.839285714285714
