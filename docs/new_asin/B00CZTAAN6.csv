8587995,4,B00CZTAAN6,One of the better movies. Still predictable.,1414886400,,44,5.428571428571429
8587996,5,B00CZTAAN6,"Great Movie.  Lots of action and intrigue!  I know it was an independent film on a relatively small budget, and what they were able to do with it, rivaled the Hollywood production companies.  I would definitely watch more from this director.",1411603200,,241,4.829268292682927
8587997,1,B00CZTAAN6,"Thought I loved low budget SCIFI!  Guess I was wrong.  I so wanted to find a silver lining in this junk but it simply wasn't there.  I guess the problem with the whole thing is that is so somber that you really don't connect to any of the characters.  You kind hope they all will evaporate or perhaps turn in to vampires.  Maybe even a zombie.  But alas, they proceed to the very end as simply pathetic actors playing out an even more pathetic plot.  Really bad.",1383868800,3,462,4.241379310344827
8587998,1,B00CZTAAN6,"This film is designed for the ""AM America"" crowd, particularly that one guy who keeps calling in about how the government is controlling weather using Tesla Coils. Looks like he got a camera for Christmas. Now the problem is NOT the government controlling the weather by heating the ionosphere, it is that rogue element that is causing disasters. Our group is tasked in trying to find counter measures to what is happening and save California before they get shot.

This is apparently the middle of a trilogy of stories which include the film ""Skyhook"" and ""Sons of Liberty."" Christine Kozlowski a former Miss Mississippi, plays scientist Maryanne Brown. She spends her time working on magnets instead of taking showers. The acting was noticeably bad. The dialouge was rather boring. There are two couples who work together at the facility, but they live dormitory style, a clear indication this production is extraterrestrial in origin.  There is an evil doer with a Jamaican accent so bad they use subscripts. In order to look official the film gives us the location and time, example: Kansas City, Missouri. 16:23. No sense locking us in with a date or a year.

The film has no character build up, apparently assuming everyone saw ""Skyhook"" a project which plays a role in this film but is lost to everyone except for that person who saw it...most likely the same AM America Tesla call-in guy. Indeed the film is designed for a narrow audience, and by narrow I mean one guy and I am not him. I'm the guy who sells plans for a frictionless perpetual motion machine;) Tesla Coils indeed.

Oh yes, the camera man sucked too. Please, in the future put the camera on a rolling tripod instead of having it sway in the office scenes so I won't get motion sickness.

Cheap special effects, brought back memories of those sex rays in ""Flesh Gordon."" Thanks, I guess.

Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Implied off screen forced lesbian sex with an awkward ""Gamesters of Triskelion"" cut away. Sorry, I needed my obscure Trekkie reference fix after this.",1381017600,,2056,4.810198300283286
8587999,1,B00CZTAAN6,"I have to say this was a terrible movie. I made it through about 15 minutes. There were 2 bimbo scientists that did not fit the casting of this movie at all. I was waiting for them to say ""Whatever"" at any moment. It could have been a good movie.",1378598400,4,246,3.94
8588000,1,B00CZTAAN6,"The Phoenix Rises is poorly scripted, rambles and is confusing. It is impossible to follow. The actors are so poorly cast it is distracting. The women playing scientist dress and look as if they are in high school not professionals and the acting is horrible at best. I would NOT recommend wasting your time watching  this movie. It falls far below rotten tomatoes.",1378166400,5,365,4.7936507936507935
8588001,3,B00CZTAAN6,An interesting movie that tries to blend a lot of high end technical science with action to keep you entertained and continue watching. The action scenes and editing style made it a lot more interesting to watch and helped with pacing through the slower dialogue heavy scenes explaining the technical aspects. Enjoyable for the price and a better independent movie than most crank out.,1376265600,2,385,5.03125
8588002,3,B00CZTAAN6,I enjoyed the film...although it was a bit disjointed in parts.  The action was good.  The flash scenes were a bit much.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more action but for a science fiction film I didn't feel insulted.  Instead it played a lot like a TV show.  It was worth the rent.,1376092800,4,291,4.035087719298246
8588003,1,B00CZTAAN6,This is the most boring film I have ever seen. It is a 7 day rental because I doubt it is humanly possible to watch more than 20 minutes of it without falling asleep. Watching my hard drive being defragmented is much more interesting than watching this flick. The good news is that if you buy this movie you can throw away your prescriptions for sleeping pills. Over the long run this movie will save you a ton of money otherwise spent on prescription sleeping aids. That is the only value in this poor excuse for entertainment.,1376006400,3,528,4.453608247422681
