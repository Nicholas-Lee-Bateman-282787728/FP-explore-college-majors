8105714,5,B000E4LK74,"I have just watched the One Day in Ping Wei With my family.  I enjoyed it enough to write my first Amazon review ever.

I am not Chinese, but I travel on business to China twica a year.  I have watched many videos and clips with my family in order to share with them ""what it's like"" when I am there. This video is as close to being on the street in China as you will find.  I have grown weary of travel videos telling me how to get a taxi to a tourist spot, or how to find the best spa on the best dollar.

I Loved the video it shows the simple hopeful life lived by the common people of China.",1259366400,5,595,3.8048780487804876
