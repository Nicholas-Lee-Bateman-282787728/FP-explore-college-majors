Too bad there are people out there who externalize there own fears onto some unseen, oppressive and ethereal collection of imagined villains or sociological contenders. This sort of ""art"" has ALWAYS been meant to capitalize on the hysterical and aimless emotional wanderers who's only fault is not having enough self-worth to NOT be deluded into the first unbelievable concept they are presented with. The sort of people who produce and spread this vapid drivel are no better, in fact they are probably worse, than the grand and overly-imagined conspiratorial organizations they lay claim to have uncovered. Oh and the production was sub par. This was obviously made for people with little-to-no thinking skills. Terrible for me, you and society at large. Bad product too. Looks like they banged it out in a weekend with complete disregard for polishing or cinematography.",1472256000,,949,5.129032258064516

I don't think he'd like someone charging so much for something he has free on You Tube.  I've seen him at a conference, giving away DVDs... And you can sign up for Bethel Churches Prophetic Research Ministry where you get monthly DVDs for free.",1451001600,,371,4.333333333333333

8488947,5,B005Y013G6,"I found Pastor Michael Hoggard to be well versed on many subjects, and an excellent speaker.  This video opened my mind to many ideas that I have not been exposed to before.  An excellent addition to my 'man-cave'.  I am glad I purchased it and wish Pastor Hoggard and all other living souls on the forsaken planet, GodSpeed.",1391990400,,325,4.568965517241379
8488948,5,B005Y013G6,"Is America's beloved and patriotic Statue of Liberty really a universal symbol of hope and freedom as we have long been led to believe, or is it a representation of something else? If its true meaning is something else one must posit the question ""just want might that something else be""? Pastor Mike Hoggard firmly believes he knows the answer to this question and his comprehensive, in-depth analysis on `American Goddess: Lucifer's Torch' will leave you shaken, bewildered and wondering why in the world haven't you heard any of this before. Of course asking the question ""why haven't you heard this before"" opens up another line of inquiry leading to possibilities that you may not want to postulate.

Hoggard presents his conspiratorial thesis in the faux newscast format that has become so popular in Christian television productions in recent years. However any similarity between mainstream secular news and this program ends with the visual accouterments. This 110 minute DVD takes the viewer on a journey down Alice's proverbial rabbit hole that would leave author Lewis Carroll shaking his head in amazement. Prepare for an utterly fascinating and immensely disturbing examination into a satanic conspiracy encompassing the mysteries of ancient Babylon, freemasonry, eastern mysticism, Luciferian Illuminsim and the coming New World Order.

Pastor Hoggard contends that the Statue of Liberty is in actuality the physical representation of the Babylonian Goddess Semiramis and incorporated into her interior and exterior frame are secret signs, symbols, numerological correspondences, structural measurements and angles that unveil a dark occult message and sinister plan for mankind's future. If you've waded into the murky waters of secret societies and hidden agendas before you already know that there are a plethora of conspiracies one can chose to believe and even more theorists willing to espouse them. Unfortunately much of the data being distributed is highly subjective and problematic in nature; historical events, clandestine meetings, inter-dimensional beings, arcane texts and tomes and all the political intrigue one can conjure up. All the necessary elements required for great conversation but not much else.

What makes this particular program so gripping and frightening (yes frightening) is the fact that there is nothing in Hoggards' presentation that requires such a leap a faith into a subjective universe. What Hoggard has to share can be corroborated by the existence of a specific, physical object that we can personally visit and check out for ourselves.  Everything he says can be validated by a detailed, logical and academically consistent examination of the information provided by Lady Liberty herself. Ultimately the viewer is left to ask themselves ""how do you argue against something right there before your eyes""? The answer is you can't and acknowledging that fact is nothing less than devastating.",1340236800,4,2946,5.468131868131868
