7077258,3,B00V8SIMJO,"I will admit, I fell asleep watching this movie, despite being a fan of most of Tsui Hark's films since the early 90s. However, I'm not here to review the movie. I'm here to tell you about the format of this particular blu-ray set (the 3D listing in case these reviews are all mashed together). One thing I didn't count on was that this package ONLY comes with the 3D version. That's a rarity these days, to find a 3D movie that doesn't come with the 2D version. So, buyer beware, if you're ever in the mood to watch this film without the glasses, etc., make sure you pick up the Western 2D blu-ray as well.",1446422400,6,607,4.241379310344827
7077259,1,B00V8SIMJO,This is a 3d movie. ONCE again the scum in America has sought fit to ROB us of a 3d blu ray release.  This must STOP.  do not buy this version.  I have a allregion 3d blu ray player so I will buy the TRUE 3d  version from Europe.,1446076800,2,229,3.6122448979591835
7077260,1,B00V8SIMJO,"ALL AROUND DUMB! Never watched more that 15 min and am asking for a refund. I love this TYPE movie, but this to ME is more a a comic book.",1445126400,,138,3.6333333333333333
7077261,3,B00V8SIMJO,Fun action movie!,1440806400,,17,5.0

7077263,4,B00V8SIMJO,Very enjoyable movie. Normally I don't watch subtitled movies as I find the subtitles distracting. Not so with the Taking of Tiger Mountain. Actually I found the subtitle dialog to be excellent.,1439596800,,194,5.09375
7077264,2,B00V8SIMJO,"Some actions were okay, some of them were really silly.  The best scene was with the tiger but you can skip the rest of the movie.  Overall too much of communist era propaganda, just tells me how much government censorship exists there.  Reminds me of old soviet union movies.  I am sure our socialist government would really love watching this one.  Just instead of bandits put rich people on the mountain and make it a must watch movie in school.",1438473600,,448,4.55
7077265,2,B00V8SIMJO,"I like the story, and the fact that it is based on an actual event.  But not he best-made film.",1438214400,,95,3.75
7077266,4,B00V8SIMJO,enjoy it. would recommend.,1435968000,,26,5.75
7077267,3,B00V8SIMJO,"Positive:
  Good CGI, enough to make it a barely believable background and action scenes, but not great.
  Loosely based (meaning embellished for entertainment purposes) on post WWII varying factions vying for power in China as Japanese occupiers were being driven out.
Neutral:
  Interesting tie in with contemporary descendent revisiting and re-imagining that period.
  Acting, dialogue, script, filming, all acceptable and pretty standard, straightforward, but nothing jumps out as being incredible. It almost felt as if it was a Communist Party sponsored politically correct promotional film.
  Rather than being a serious historical docudrama it seemed more like a lighthearted fantasy story.
Negative:
  If looking for historical accuracy, then other than someone infiltrating a gang to spy with some sort of positive outcome for his efforts, it came across as an imaginative fantasy which may be all that a viewer is interested in.
  Misleading cover art.",1435968000,9,962,5.590277777777778

7077273,4,B00V8SIMJO,My wife and I liked this movie but we watched it over the course of 2 days. Normally we watch Chinese movies start to finish especially if they have subtitles cause we can't stand a dubbed movie. This one kept our attention and the end of the movie was a trip!,1434412800,5,260,4.117647058823529
