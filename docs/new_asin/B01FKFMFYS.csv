8760911,5,B01FKFMFYS,this dvd is just like being at the beach.  the videos of the waves and the beach are gorgeous. And the sound of the waves are very relaxing too. I also want to point out that the videos are not only of different beaches but are also different times of the day. This dvd is very well done. I'm very pleased.,1507507200,2,306,4.016393442622951
8760912,4,B01FKFMFYS,I was hoping for a little more noise and action in the waves.  Otherwise it was beautiful especially to someone who wants very soothing pictures and wave sounds.,1496793600,2,161,4.75
8760913,5,B01FKFMFYS,Very calming! Almost like you're there!,1484611200,,39,5.666666666666667
8760914,2,B01FKFMFYS,The videography is good but the ocean sounds overlay is disappointing. Would be a 5 star product of they used actual sound from ocean your watching. It's painfully obvious when the sounds and pictures don't agree/sync.,1483056000,12,218,5.083333333333333
8760915,3,B01FKFMFYS,"The video itself is beautiful but the water and wave sounds are not realistic. Anyone who has been on a beach, has seen & heard the waves crashing, can tell these are just sound effects and added into the video after the fact. Kinda disappointed.",1477267200,10,246,4.488888888888889
8760916,3,B01FKFMFYS,Disc one is very good. I did not like the second disc. It showed more trees than water and I wanted more water views.,1475539200,8,117,3.9166666666666665
8760917,5,B01FKFMFYS,I love the beach! You can pretend to be on vacation in your own home. Disc 1 has still backgrounds with beautiful wave views. Disc 2 has multiple beach scenes...beach/sand/tropical forest. I love the beach with the mountains and clouds in the background. You can choose between wave sound or waves with music. Playing these discs with the wave sounds makes the house seem peaceful.  The beach always relaxes me.,1469664000,4,411,4.871428571428571
8760918,5,B01FKFMFYS,"On these two DVDs you find different shots of wonderful beaches. You can choose between Mediterranean or tropical beaches, both with the sounds of the waves or relaxing music. I especially liked the Mediterranean beaches with its foaming waves and the magnificent light of the setting sun. The DVD of tropical beaches with green palm trees and white sand can immediately contribute a holiday mood. These are two great DVDs with which you can relax really well.",1466208000,5,460,4.987012987012987
8760919,5,B01FKFMFYS,"Two discs of rich colorful blue waters and several sandy beaches complete with the relaxing sounds of the ocean waves or soft music.  I really enjoyed this set.  Some of the scenes reminded me of the lovely turquoise waters and white beaches of the Caribbean.  No shaking video, professionally filmed and over two hours of quality beach footage.

Great for relaxing or meditation.  I really enjoy this type of DVD while going to sleep.  They loop automatically so no interruption in your tranquil beach visit.",1464220800,9,509,4.929411764705883
