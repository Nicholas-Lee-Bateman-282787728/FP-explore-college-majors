7897759,4,6305943729,"Pretty good early 60's Italian-made, English-dubbed horror film.  The story is somewhat convoluted, but it involves a creepy castle with the requisite dungeon, ghosts, walking suits-of-armor, and a giggling deformed madman who indulges in torture.  The quality of the Image Entertainment is very good.  Highly recommended.",1434758400,2,322,5.956521739130435
7897760,5,6305943729,"This is the type of old B/W horror movie you love to watch. Great plot, good acting and you don't dare take your eyes off the movie from the start to the ending. I gave it  five stars because of the movie itself, its that good however the picture is only fair the sound is very good. This picture should be remastered to make it what it shoud be. None the less you will like it. Its that good even with the fair picture.",1415232000,4,420,4.0

7897762,4,6305943729,"I totally enjoy these old black and white creepy,spooky,campy haunted castle movies. The characters and story line are not important it's just harmless fun compared to the downright ugly gore movies of today. If your a baby boomer who went to the movies every weekend when you were a kid you may enjoy this. Also the music score is so strange you gotta love it......",1348876800,6,366,4.6461538461538465
7897763,2,6305943729,"OK - it's not THAT bad, but this very minor entry in euro-horror surely lacks in entertainment value.  Except for a few delirious scenes of women tied up and tortured by the disfigured man-creature, this movie is mostly just a big giant bore.  Characters talk endlessly as the mystery unfolds.  Is the lead woman the reincarnation of a long-dead ancestor????  Who cares.  Ya, it's that story you've seen a million times...you know the one - where the painting on the wall resembles the lead character.  Z-z-z-z-z-z-z.  Skip this Tomb of Torture and seek out the Bloody Pit of Horror instead!  The DVD has no extras.",971654400,18,615,4.79047619047619
