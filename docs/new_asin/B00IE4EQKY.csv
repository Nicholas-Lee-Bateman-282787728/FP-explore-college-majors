8641389,5,B00IE4EQKY,"This is my all time favorite syfy channel movie. I searched high and low to find this title. I had all but given up hope of getting my hands on a copy. It took me from 2006 until 2016 to find this on dvd because it had no American release. This DVD will NOT work in a standard American DVD player but will play in my Xbox 360, my ps4, and all of my portable dvd players with absolutely no problems",1509148800,,397,3.9135802469135803
