5404808,5,B00AADADXQ,Intense movie. Very provocative.,1412121600,,32,7.25
5404809,2,B00AADADXQ,"I really like the main actors, the subject matter is interesting, the first twist was surprising, and the movie started very strong. It was therefore very disappointing to witness the storyline get lost a 1/3 through and look for itself for the rest of the movie. I do not think that it is an editing issue. I think it comes from the screenplay itself.",1387238400,,352,4.515625
5404810,3,B00AADADXQ,"An interesting nicely paced non-boring movie, but there was nobody in it that I liked, cared about, or rooted for.

 I thought the caper part of the plot had some holes in it, but it was a slick film. The acting was okay but like I said there was nobody I liked or cared about and the characters were not very deep so neither was the acting. Real bad casting.

The old alkie news editor came close to lighting up the scenes as he dug and dug through the lie but then he's just chopped off and drifts away; interesting tension was wasted.

An OK movie, see it.

5404811,5,B00AADADXQ,"If you loved ""The Talented Mister Ripley"" or just enjoyed it you should enjoy this as well. The cinematography is striking and the premise is thrilling. An upscale family man creates a big problem for himself and decides to change his life. In doing so he causes more problems for his new identity. Sometimes you just can't get out of your own way!
I really like this film. Some of the moves made are unbelievable but I was surprised, excited, and pulled in without ever being let down.",1372982400,2,486,4.534090909090909
5404812,5,B00AADADXQ,"I bought this movie exclusively on trailers that I saw of it. It has turned out to be far, far more than I expected and also introduced me to another French actor who I will be looking to see more of.

An affair, by Paul's wife, is the catalyst for what is to come: a jealous rage, that turns into murder, which breaks up a family and plunges him into a life of lies and hiding. His talent as a photographer, which he had put on the back burner for more job security (being a lawyer in Paris), is forced out into the open as a man in hiding. It is heartbreaking to see him leave his children behind, not wanting them to grow up being known as the sons of a murderer. He fakes his own death trying to close that life he left.

But his talent is undeniable... and he finds himself in a impossible situation when the man he befriends causes his photographs to be seen by a gallery owner. She recognizes his talent and does a show for him... with one alarming problem: people want to SEE the photographer. Knowing he cannot do that, he is forced to flee again and books passage on a cargo ship. When he witnesses a cruel incident aboard ship, and takes the pictures to document everything, he is thrown overboard, in the middle of the ocean, along with the stowaways. His life and one of the stowaways is saved by a member of the crew, who, unwilling to let him drown, throws a life raft overboard. When they reach land, he sends the surviving man into town with his film & he takes the pictures to a local news agency... thus bringing light to what happened to them... and what became of so many others.

While he deserves to be punished for the crime he committed, I feel, even though he is still in hiding, he has earned the right to a new life.",1369958400,2,1744,4.2155688622754495
5404813,3,B00AADADXQ,"""The Big Picture"" (""L'homme qui voulait vivre sa vie"") is a French adaptation of the book by American novelist Douglas Kennedy. Paul Exben (Romain Duris) is a high-priced Parisian lawyer married to Sarah (Marina Fos), with two young children and a posh home in the suburbs. Paul gave up his passion, photography, to make money in the family law firm, now owned primarily by Anne (Catherine Deneuve), a friend of his deceased parents. But Anne has given Paul some bad news, and Sarah is increasingly disinterested in her husband since he adopted a pragmatic approach to life. Just as Paul tries to rekindle their stale relationship, he suspects that Sarah may be having an affair with a local  photographer Grgoire Kremer (Eric Ruf). When an accident changes everything, Paul decides to pursue a new life, reluctantly but also with a sense of recapturing the freedom he lost.

There isn't anything particularly bad about ""The Big Picture"". There just isn't anything interesting either. I've seen this plot too many times before. I had a sense of dja vu while watching it. There is a twist toward the end, but the writers drop the ball and cop out on the ending. The situation with Anne feels contrived and is superfluous to the story. I didn't buy the hotshot lawyer with a permanent 5 o'clock shadow and responsibilities that seem limited to babysitting a trust fund baby with a video game addiction. As for the main plot points, the film tries too hard to make petty problems out to be serious existential crises. One might argue that Paul has real problems after the accident, but not before. Mostly it's just predictable and mediocre. Mostly in French with optional English, English SDH, and Spanish subtitles. The MPI 2013 DVD includes a theatrical trailer (2 min).",1368662400,3,1769,4.8737541528239205
5404814,4,B00AADADXQ,"Paul Exben (Roman Duris) has it all, a lovely wife, great job, bags of cash, great home and yet he seems a bit insecure. Catherine Deneuve plays his boss Anne, she has a terminal illness and is about to leave her controlling share in the company to him. So he is about to gain even more albeit with the loss of a caring friend.

He loves his two children and put on acts of capriciousness to endear him to them, which seems to have the opposite effect on his wife. Then he starts to notice subtle changes in his wife's behaviour; Sarah (Maria Fois) seems to be on a short fuse when ever he is around and more relaxed around a certain other man. This man is a jobbing photographer Gregoire; Paul is a rich amateur who had once held ambitions of being a good photographer himself once upon a time.

Then her sudden new taste for New Zealand `Cloudy Bay' and long lunch engagement gets him more suspicious. Things come to a head at a dinner party where one sauvignon blanc too many leads him to act the oaf. The following day spur of the moment decision start a series of events that even `The A Team' would be hard pushed to put right.

This is a well crafted drama with an under lying current of tension that lends more to a thriller than a life tale. The ever presence of photography runs through out and acts like a thread tying all the disparate parts of the story together.

It is beautifully shot too, with some almost iconic shots and great use of scenery and space. The acting is all well above average and Roman Duris does a particularly good performance. Director Eric Lartigan has made a beautifully filmed, challengingly framed and original piece of cinema. Some may find the plot a bit of a stretch, but it is dealing with a situation that few people would ever find them selves in and I found it very entertaining.",1364688000,8,1826,4.377581120943953

8549106,3,B00AADADXQ,"Stupid story but engrossing film. Interesting views of Montenegro. The film's Preview Summary writers: ""...handsome Parisian lawyer..."" It is an unfortunate fact that in the movies, there remains a gender dichotomy: this dude is, in my opinion, another unattractive male actor women are expected to find superficially attractive. C'mon Summary writers: ""ugly"" and ""beautiful"" are subjective. You lost this film a whole star with your shallow advertising.",1523923200,,454,5.791044776119403
8549107,5,B00AADADXQ,"It was like watching multiple movies in one. Unexpected. Loved it! Heads up is a french movie (audio) with English Subtitles so to be comfortable , change the settings and put big subtitles if you don't like the ones that come with it.",1517616000,,235,4.488372093023256
8549108,4,B00AADADXQ,Ive seen this one before but since its all but impossible to make any comments on movies (like Ive seen it or Im not interested like the old days in Netflix) I started watching it again. We remembered some of it once we got into it but it was good so we watched it again and were not disappointed. When a reviewer states it doesnt have in closure I have to wonder if were talking about the same movie. I don't want to give any spoilers but I thought it stopped at the right spot and the ragged looking Frenchman had learned something finally. The only drawback to this one is the lead actor but I guess looking disheveled and unkempt must be the new norm for French cinema. Its well done and kept our interest and thats all I expect from a movie.,1511049600,2,746,4.1875
8549109,1,B00AADADXQ,"Nothing redeeming in this story, just a frustrating web of deceit. Didn't like it.",1498348800,,82,4.928571428571429
8549110,4,B00AADADXQ,"A wholly understandable story in that human insecurity is an ugly, dangerous, and deadly dog when it gets a neck hold on someone regardless of race, religion or nationality. Emotional betrayal is the worst kind and it inadvertently illustrates the difference between a man's possessiveness (physical) and a woman's (emotional/intellectual) as shown here as murder. It is also a mediocre story about a selfish man starting over by disappearing - leaving his own kids behind and fatherless  - and as a fugitive who will ultimately be wanted for homicide, there is no surprise there thus the ending was perfect. It would have been more interesting to see him try to change his appearance and play the new ID by shaving, haircut, suit, etc., instead he became one of the photographs that made him a celebrity,  a static speck of time in a place then...the blackness of anonymity.  Nice cinematography. Beautiful places.",1467331200,,915,5.046357615894039
8549111,4,B00AADADXQ,"Excellent film with great acting, cinematography and a solid story line. Goes a bit over-the-top towards the end though, they didn't need to extend the story quite that far. Still a great film.",1457136000,,193,4.878787878787879
8549112,4,B00AADADXQ,"We love Romain Duris and have thoroughly enjoyed many of his films including Paris, Heartbreaker, L'Auberge Espagnole and its follow-up Russian Dolls...and most emphatically ""The Beat that My Heart Skipped.""  ""The Big Picture"" is another winner in that stretch.  Even when Duris' characters are not fully likeable (and he definitely straddles the line here), you find yourself rooting for him.

This well-plotted thriller is adopted from the novel of the same name by Douglas Kennedy.  The life of Duris' Paul Exben -- already in tumult due to an impending breakup of  his marriage and ownership changes at work -- takes a sharp, shocking turn for the dark and desperate thanks to a fit of anger that goes horribly and tragically wrong.  A quick thinking Paul ""solves"" the bloody aftermath but at the expense of his normal life in the environs of Paris.  He ""Splits"" (pin intended) for Croatia.  Can Paul make a clean getaway or will his past catch up with him? Watch to find out!

Good here as always: Niels Arestrup, whose character may not be the drunkard he appears on first glance.  That piercing gaze and foreboding manner...he's intensity personified, so good in 'A Prophet' and again with Duris in ""The Beat My Heart Skipped."" I love seeing this guy pop up on screen.",1436400000,,1275,4.861111111111111
