8319441,1,B000OCXM0E,"Ultimate crap collection is more like it. The same films are recycled over and over again by Mill Creek Entertainment. This collection makes me laugh especially because it shows Peter Cushing in the middle of the front of the dvd cover, and the image  isn't even from a movie, it's actually from a television show that Hammer made called Hammer House of Horror, and the episode is Silent Scream. So don't buy anything from Mill Creek unless you buy one of their 100 movie packs, but then you will own everything they have ever released, so you won't ever have to buy another set again.",1356220800,8,585,4.571428571428571
