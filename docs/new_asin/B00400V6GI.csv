4237602,2,B00400V6GI,"If you expect something as good as the ""In Concert"" productions such as CHESS or LES MISERABLES, you'd better think it twice. Voices are wonderful; yet, the production is average, Mr. Michael York's comments throughout the whole concert on the events that are supposed to happen on stage (but you don't see) are quite disappointing. The point is that you don't have the whole production: it's a sort of sypnopsis of the play which include some of the best songs but, in general, it lacks the splendour and magnificence of previous ""in concert"" productions. In other words, it looks to me as something rather poor. Not really impressive, really.",1326153600,7,644,4.91743119266055
4237603,4,B00400V6GI,"We were fortunate to see the first preview on Broadway of ""A Tale of Two Cities"" in August 2008.  To view this concert version brings back such wonderful memories of a superb cast and recall the magnificent staging.  I remember sobbing tears of sadness in the final 20 minutes of this production and it had the same effect as I watched this DVD.  Such a wonderful piece of music and singing.  Thank you so much for recording this concert.  On another note, I hope a film company will film ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" with all optional endings.",1308355200,2,544,4.510204081632653
4237604,4,B00400V6GI,"I saw the Broadway production of A Tale of Two Cities twice, and found it quite moving and well done.  There are some lovely songs, and the musical does justice to the Dickens classic.  I am glad that the musical has been preserved on video with this concert version, which features several fine performers from the Broadway cast, most importantly the terrific James Barbour.  The concert version obviously has been cut down from the full Broadway production, with Michael York providing narration to fill in any gaps in the story.  While I missed some of the musical numbers from Broadway that were eliminated, as well as some of the visuals from that production, the concert version still effectively tells the story and ultimately proves to be both powerful and moving, with the music clearly contributing to and enhancing the emotions and mood of the story.  I'm happy to recommend this DVD.",1291593600,11,895,4.900662251655629
4237605,5,B00400V6GI,"I was lucky enough to be able to see this show during its far too brief Broadway run. I was so taken with A Tale of Two Cities and so moved by it, that I returned to see it a few additional times. I can tell you that the audience members around me were just as touched by this fine musical as I was. It's a great story that both makes you laugh and brings you to tears. The score is exciting, intelligent and extremely memorable. As a New York City resident I see a lot of theater and truly it was as good a theatrical experience as one could hope for. Until the show is revived, it's fortunate that we have this PBS special to enjoy this fine work, and luckily most of the very talented Broadway cast is present here as well. Great voices and great acting abound. I'm glad I got to see the show and I recommend this DVD for others who did and for others who did not get the opportunity.",1289174400,14,887,4.045454545454546
4237606,2,B00400V6GI,"I can only assume that this DVD is an attempt by the producers to make some money on a show that is unlikely to ever make money in a theatre. The only really positive element in this musical is the basic story-line culled from Charles Dickens' extraordinary novel. The score sounds like second-rate Frank Wildhorn (which for many will translate as third-rate); the production values are minimal; and the interpolated readings by Michael York trying to fill in the narrative are just embarrassing.  If you saw this show on-stage and enjoyed it, by all means buy it as a souvenir. But others should sample it first. Bottom line: Although it desperately strives to be another LES MIZ, it's not.",1395273600,,691,4.80672268907563
4237607,5,B00400V6GI,"This play was epic in its staging and perhaps therein lies the flaw of the production. A Tale of Two Cities was one of the most expensive productions on Broadway when it premiered and tickets sales were just not enough to sustain it. I was privileged to have been at several performances including the last, and was disappointed when the cast did not reunite for a soundtrack. Though you can purchase the concept CD- it does not include James Barbour as Sidney Carlton, who reprises the role for this DVD concert. There is no substitute for Barbour's voice and a record of his performance is worth picking up this DVD alone. The DVD is a live performance of a concert version of the play, the actors are in costume and act out shortened versions of the scenes that contain music. One let let down of the concert is that some of the really large company numbers are either cut short or cut out altogether- my favorite being the holiday song ""Round, and Round we Go."" But as I was expecting never to see this play again after it fled Broadway, the DVD is an unexpected delight! A Staple for any Broadway aficionado's collection!",1387756800,2,1126,4.551724137931035
4237608,5,B00400V6GI,"While the concert version of Tale of Two Cities is a musical masterpiece, it pales in comparison to the astonishing Broadway production of the play which continues to dazzle audiences around the world.  In time it will return to Broadway to finish it's interrupted run, interrupted by the unfortunate timing of the economic collapse.  When it does don't miss it.  In the meantime Jill Santoriello is a rising star who is exploding on the highly exclusive and prestigious Broadway musical scene.  Buy this and listen and you will become a fan as well.",1382054400,,550,4.881720430107527
4237609,5,B00400V6GI,"Unfortunately I did not get a chance to see this show during its run, but being a huge fan of James Barbour (mainly for his run as 'The Beast' in 'Beauty and the Beast on Broadway') and having grown up loving the story of 'A Tale of Two Cities', I purchased and fell in love with the cast soundtrack very quickly.  So purchasing this DVD was naturally the next step!

I do have a few things I didn't especially care for; I could have done without Michael York's constant narration, there were a few songs (although minor ones) removed that I wish they would have kept in (mainly 'Defarge Goodbye'), and I definitely would have preferred a filming of the full performance over a concert. But while I don't feel it had the impact of other musical concerts such as 'Les Mis 10: The Dream Cast', the performances of the actors made up for it.  Especially James Barbour as Sydney Carton who stole the show with highlights such as 'I Can't Recall', 'If Dreams Came True' and the Finale.

In all, a great way to spend an evening at home, and in my mind, a must have for any musical lover!",1369267200,4,1081,4.36318407960199
4237610,4,B00400V6GI,"This concert reminded me of the Tenth Anniversary Concert of Les Miserables. The actors are amazing, but it isn't the complete musical. That being said, it still moved me to tears a couple of times because of the superb way the actors (James Barbour in particular) play their roles.",1359072000,,282,4.775510204081633
4237611,5,B00400V6GI,"This is an INCREDIBLE filming of a beautiful production! The cast is stunning and the leads are simply fantastic.  Brandi Burkhardt, Natalie Toro etc. give show stopping performances. I absolutely wept at the film's conclusion. The music is incredible and breathtaking.  The plot is intricate and well establish through song.  However because it is the concert version it is simplified greatly and Michael York narrates some key plot points but the essence of the piece is there. I was never able to see it in New York so I am extremely grateful they released this.  In my opinion, it is MUCH better than the concert version of Chess. Hands down, 5 stars. I watched it this morning and will probably watch it again tomorrow it was so good.",1356480000,,739,4.75
4237612,5,B00400V6GI,"The In Concert edition of Tale of Two Cities The Musical was an exceptional production with extremely high caliber voices, acting, and well thought out interspersed narration. Kudos to the composer, the director, and the sound people. And James Barbour was absolutely phenomenal.",1352764800,,279,5.511627906976744
4237613,5,B00400V6GI,"This costumed concert performance is an excellent demonstration of the music and plot of the popular Broadway show ""A Tale of Two Cities"".  It must have been a wonderful show to see during it's run.

The book and score are good, and the cast is great.  Every actor is spot-on, and their beautiful voices are top notch.  There is something exceptional about the show's lead, James Barbour.  Whenever he enters a scene you forget you're watching a show and get caught up in the story.  And then he sings.  It is not exaggeration to opine that there have been few such magnificent voices.

The story, by Dickens, rings gloriously through this production.  And the end of the show -- very faithful to the source material -- is as powerful as the end of the book.  (If you know the book, you understand what high praise that is.) It's rapturous.",1342915200,,840,4.577181208053691
4237614,1,B00400V6GI,"i thought it was the actual musical, but i guess im just dumb. it has some clips of the musical and stuff but thats not what i was expecting",1338681600,,140,3.8620689655172415
4237615,4,B00400V6GI,"It is not often, as much as I love and collect good drama, especially set to music,....to not be even able to finish watching it. phoo. I think collectors should know.

I apologize right away-I had such a good time ripping this one up...I went too far! ( chortle ). Those of us who collect opera, e.b. have found ourselves very pleasantly surprised at the marvelous productions.  And frankly, spoiled. Fabulous camera- artists all, same for costume, singers with strong clear voices,opulent  set, directing. You really can't get by with something sort of cobbled together like this.
Please don't take this too seriously. The phenomena is that with movies that show L.A. sliding into the Pacific...it is so difficult to pull off on a little
stage...and impress anyone. ""Musicals"" per se, don't seem to have a heart beat, and we need to do all we can to save them.
I'm reviewing ""Memphis now...and it too, with some impressive production values...people appearing out of a hole in the stage, etc....the lead white guy is so creepy...like walking on tip toes through a culvert...as a white person, I'm embarrassed for our race. ( he he...now see. this is not as serious

as I make it out. This is just for laughs. Trust me, they'll geet better at making musicals...or please...some similance of bel canto? Is that asking too much?

Music is such a personal thing, you may like this. But for me, when you see some of the greatest vocalists of our generation singing...well, let's say Mario Frangoulis...A) you like him immmediately. B) He is opening his mouth wide for an ""Ah"", very round for ""Oh"", lips protruding for ""U""... with virtually every note sung with enormous beauty and clarity...and so on.

Here the actors, all limeys, who imagine themselves to have cornered the market on speaking the King's English...when the fact is ,  they are deplorable at it. Contractions like
""Weren't"", or ""shan't"" were practically invented in the British Isles. So it isn't surprising that they contract every word they can, without moving their lips  (stiff upper lip, Jeeves ).
The fatal flaw in this production is the assumption that every uttered syllable is clearly registering with the listening audience. It is not! Not with contrived accents, stilted utterances, made slovenly by drunkeness ( the central feature of and perhaps the identifying trait of the Brit ). This production starts with a scene of a ( imagined ) wine wagon wreck and massive spillage, with the huddled , ragged masses licking the wine from the muddy street...streets that served as pathways for animals brought in daily for slaughter, and refuse also thrown from windows, and god knows what else. That's real appetizing- but hey! it's alcohol !...and that is only the start of the 'festive' foul drunken revelry. All the while the orchestra is dutifully doing its part, chorale group in slightly off syncopation as usual...and the utlimate coup de grace....no subtitles! Of any kind, for any nationality!
In a word, you will not understand a word of it. The music is not so bad. I feel sorry for the composer and the orchestra. The art director ( along with the cheapskate  producers ) should be thrown into that slurry in the Dickensian Streets of London, along with its inebriated hordes of godless humanity. ( holding up a filthy tankard : ""To Darwin !...Here here!"")",1327708800,2,3338,4.904255319148936

8411564,4,B00400V6GI,I bought this because I love J Mark Mcvey's voice. I have all his albums so far and wanted to see him in a role. It is similar to Les Mis in time period and theme . He is an old man who was in prison ( sound familiar) and is reunited with his daughter and finds life anew. This version is narrated by Michael York and it helps keep the theme on track . Mr McVey doesn't have a large part but it's not a bad play just probably a tired theme because it was after Les Mis (I believe).,1440201600,,481,3.772277227722772
