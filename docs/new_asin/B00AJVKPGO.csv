5444161,4,B00AJVKPGO,Danny is an alien not of this galaxy even. at this point im just filling the required space for the comment,1358812800,2,107,4.142857142857143
5444162,3,B00AJVKPGO,Petulant attempt at intellectual sensationalism was it that therm was in an altered state... Hopeful of achieving fame from a dimmed down American dream. The thunder just did not follow this lightening!,1358208000,,202,5.34375
5444163,5,B00AJVKPGO,"Great film, not much to say other than watch and appreciate.  Danny Way is a true legend in action sports, not just skateboarding.  Great editing as well!",1357862400,,154,4.666666666666667
5444164,5,B00AJVKPGO,A great addition to the skate doc genre. Stands well next to Dogtown and Bones Brigade. Way is an engaging protagonist well drawn through interviews with those who know him. And the last act (the jump) is pretty tense.,1357516800,3,218,4.615384615384615
5444165,5,B00AJVKPGO,"Was blown away. Talk about overcoming obstacles. I am not a boarder, nor into extreme sports, but was hugely encouraged by the life of Danny Way to keep going for your dreams, and above all, keep getting back up. If anyone has been through a rough time in life, and wants to throw in the towl, or just wants to watch an amazing flick about a guy doing the impossible, watch it. You won't regret it.",1355443200,4,398,4.25

5444167,5,B00AJVKPGO,I wish more quality films like this existed these days. If you are independent minded and you like those who think outside the box it's highly probable you won't be dissappointed.,1355011200,2,179,4.806451612903226
5444168,5,B00AJVKPGO,"first off..im not a skater by any definition of the word.
i used to hang out w a couple of skaters, but im not one.
.
i don't even know how i heard about this movie, but im a fan of documentaries and it looked interesting when i ran across the trailer a few weeks ago.
then yesterday i saw something about it. probably on fb or instagram or something.
i searched amazon and there it was.
click. rent.
i made a big salad and parked in front of the tv.
wow.
great movie. quite a story danny way has. the movie was shot well, the interviews were good and the ending shots in hawaii are incredible. i wanted to see more but the way it ended was cool.
it left me wanting more, which i think a movie should.
.
rent it. buy it. either way, its good.
make a salad when you do.
mine had 4 kinds of peppers in it, including sweet, green, hot and sport.
salad was great too.
movie was better though.
.
watch it.",1355011200,,900,4.0055555555555555

5444170,5,B00AJVKPGO,"This is an incredible documentary of an extraordinary athlete.
Highly recommend this one to all sports fans, not just skateboarders.
I loved Danny Way's journey and his passion and do consider him
the absolute master of the sport. Highly recommend this to everyone.",1371945600,,265,5.186046511627907
5444171,5,B00AJVKPGO,"good documentary, paid to rent this and found it on netflix the next day. :( still a good purchase, but too much product placement, like in any skateboarding feature",1369267200,,165,4.724137931034483
5444172,5,B00AJVKPGO,"Highly recommend this documentary to everyone who has ever set foot on a skateboard, and anyone else who knows of Danny Way, or has an interest of any kind to skateboarding, or extreme sports. The digital download quality was amazing on my 27"" iMac. All around a great film, and easily helped me become an even bigger fan of Danny's achievements and determination.",1367798400,,364,4.7936507936507935
5444173,5,B00AJVKPGO,"truly incredible. Danny Way might be the most inspirational skater ever. no one even come close to the sheer drive, balls and imagination of this guy.
he is proof positive of resilience, overcoming incredible personal and physical challenges. Danny Way is not just a skateboarder, he is a true hero.
I met him when he was 14 and touring through Texas, and even then, he was a force of nature. I've never seen anyone with a more insatiable drive to progress and raise the bar
in ANY sport(u hear me Kobe?). He's a testament to the level of abuse the human spirit can handle and still get back up and trying. he has been aptly named ""The Terminator"". whatever life throws yer way,
just keep getting back up. great film guys..!",1366070400,,724,4.534351145038168
5444174,5,B00AJVKPGO,Very well done! Very encouraging and inspiring! It shows how anyone can overcome anything if they set their mind to it!,1364515200,2,119,4.714285714285714

5444176,5,B00AJVKPGO,Great movie!!! Way is a bad ass!!! Crazy that there is this whole other level of human being walking among us...,1362355200,2,112,4.380952380952381
5444177,5,B00AJVKPGO,I felt like this movie was motivation and inspiring. I have always been a big fan of Danny Way! They did a good job with this movie.,1360454400,,132,3.925925925925926
5444178,4,B00AJVKPGO,"This is a well designed documentary covering one person's quest to break new ground in his sport and how his life experiences from a very young age shaped his drive and need for achievement.
I was never a huge Danny Way fan because we are the same age.  I thought he was great, but there was no hero worship.  If you grew up enamored with the skateers of the 80's this documentary will not hit all the same emotional notes that Stacy Peralta's amazing Bones Brigade documentary did, or for that matter, the biopics for Gator and Christian Hosoi.
What this movie will do, though, is thoroughly entertain you with rare skating footage and grab you at an emotional and mental level with the very personal behind the scenes biographical information that was largely taking place outside the public's eyes.  Danny overcame some great odds to become so successful. Most people who grow up in similar circumstances travel down a very different path.",1359590400,,942,4.766871165644171
5444179,5,B00AJVKPGO,This movie was very good! This movie was great to watch with my twelve year old who loves to skate! Amazing skater.....,1359244800,,119,4.454545454545454
8552736,5,B00AJVKPGO,"To anyone who skateboards, or even if you like a good ol fashion autobiography type documentary- this is a good one!!!

8552743,5,B00AJVKPGO,"Great documentary on one of the best skaters ever. Danny has the kind of guts and determination that most people can only dream of having. He does things on a skateboard that just don't seem possible and has set the bar very high. In my opinion Danny Way, Tony Hawk and Rodney Mullen are the best to ever step on a board.",1408147200,,321,4.193548387096774
