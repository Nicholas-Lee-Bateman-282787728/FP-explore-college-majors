3984986,1,B002TLRGA0,"For those curious as to whether Satan's Wife exhibits Mya's customary substandard quality, I'm sad to report that it does.  The image looks like it was pulled from an old bargain VHS tape recorded in the EP mode.  As with many of Mya's releases, there are no extras at all (not even a trailer), and you get two audio options: Italian with no subtitles and dubbed English that is very poorly voiced. The best thing you can say about the picture quality is that the aspect ratio seems to be correct--frequently not the case with Mya DVDs.

The picture and sound quality are both bad, and the movie itself is not much better. I watched the English version, and I got the impression that that the lines were designed to fit the movement of the mouths rather than reflect what was written in the Italian script. The basic plot involves four women who had a one-night stand with Satan long ago, renounced their allegiance and now must pay the penalty, a penalty that comes in the form of one of the women's daughter, now a teenager and looking to avenge the insult to the Evil One.  Admittedly, the actor playing the daughter is pretty creepy (and her bad dubbing actually makes her creepier), but her lines are so overblown and the situations she finds herself in are so convoluted, you can't take them seriously.  In fact, the death of one character late in the movie is so illogical, you get the feeling that the actors were simply making it all up as they went along.  The film also features a number of ""special effects"" (such as people disappearing and reappearing for no real reason) that will make you miss the high standards of 1960s TV shows like Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie.

Now take a look at the box cover and the tagline ""The devil has never been hornier."" You may think you're going to get a lot of nudity.  You don't.

The plot itself is negligible, as it is in many of these Italian Exorcist/Omen rip-offs, but many of the scenes (especially those which involve the Charlemagne swords) play like Saturday Night Live parodies of these kinds of movies. It's nice to see John Phillip Law paired again with his Danger: Diabolik co-star Marisa Mell, but the opportunity to put the two together is wasted.

We begin with a long dance sequence in which the women give themselves to the devils, but they all sport big smiles, as if they're showgirls auditioning in Vegas.  We end with the very 1970s ""shock"" ending, which isn't so much of a shock as a relief that the movie is over.  Basically this is a waste of your money and a waste of your time.",1266278400,23,2558,4.501079913606912
3984987,1,B002TLRGA0,"I haven't seen this DVD, but I have (unfortunately) bought many other Mya titles in the past.  I won't ever do that again.  Can you say ""rip off""?  I have no idea where they get the rights to these movies...but I'm guessing it's from bottleggers around the world.  Picture quality sucks on Mya DVDs.  Subtitles appear and then become squiggly unreadable worms on the screen.  The video flips and buckles just like an old VHS or Beta tape.  Why?  Because they are cheap and make no effort for quality...and they still charge too much for a piece of crap.  That other reviewer must have been eating mushrooms...and you notice there was no mention of picture quality?  Buyer beware!",1265846400,13,679,4.677966101694915
3984988,4,B002TLRGA0,"I actually found Satan's Wife (USA) (DVD title) (1979)  film quite entertaining by distracting my attention from what burdens or distresses me (Old Latin, seafood, pending legislative activity and George Walker Bush). Had anyone other than John Phillip Law (Danger: Diabolik! ) played the role of the Exorcist, I think this film would have collapsed.

The plot has more than its share of weaknesses, which is common among films involving Italian Exorcist rip-offs (especially those containing Satanists, occultism and Female nude scenes) --seriously, just go back to the day before it all occurs and deprive Satan of power!) and it dragged on a bit towards the end, which I found very unsatisfying. It's still worth a look if you're in a demonic possession mood but it's more Italian devil scandal than Exorcist.

Maybe in the 70's it was a good Exorcist-copy film but not now, now it's just late '70's shoddy devil madness.",1265328000,6,924,5.026143790849673

8380243,3,B002TLRGA0,"Oh MYA! ... MYA has built a reputation for itself by releasing rare, much sought-after Spanish cult horror titles in terrible bargain-VHS-type quality but with extremely high special-edition-type price tags. Well, Satan's Wife looks truly awful! Murky, dark, grainy, blurry - a bottom-of-the-barrel offering from whatever source they happened to pluck up. Also, the film has two audio options - English dubbing and Original Spanish but with NO subtitles (really, for the $25 list price, lousy picture and sound and NO extras, the LEAST they could/should offer was subtitles)!! However, the movie itself is pretty interesting. A group of ladies make a pact with the devil, but then decide to renege on their end of the bargain. All is well until one of the girls' daughters begins to act devilish. Things play out almost like one of those all-too-common made-for-TV movies that were so abundant in the wake of ""The Excorcist""'s success. Except for the extra doses of nudity and all around weirdness that build up to an eye rubbing finale pitting naked evil daughter against naked formerly-evil mother. Who will win?? Finding out the answer to that question involves a lot of work viewing this movie with its shoddy-ass presentation that makes even the worst offerings from one of those ""Mill Creek"" 50-movie box sets look high-definition by comparison. Only for hardcore genre fans!",1336003200,2,1381,5.142222222222222
8380244,1,B002TLRGA0,"DO NOT BUY THIS! This is the very sought after, rare Italian Horror thriller cult classic featuring Lara Wendel, Anne Heywood and Marisa Mell. The problem is, the quality is equal to the garbage quality VHS DVD-R you probably already own.  Why Mya DVD doesn't understand that the people who would buy this already own a poor quality copy and if they took the time to track down a good print and remastered it, they would sell 5 times as many copies.  DVD labels like this confuse me. It show how they have no idea how there audience is.

NOTE TO MyA DVD.... listen, we already own poor quality copies of the movies you release... we want high quality copies. We do not need another poor quality copy of your films.  You are not selling these to people who know nothing about the movies. Those people do not want your movies.  The people who want your titles already know about them and want remastered and preferably restored copies.  Releasing this garbage won't help you.

8380245,3,B002TLRGA0,"Here we have one of the most bizarre films of the occult which could have been a minor success if the storyline wasn't so muddled and slipshod.  It has an outstanding group of actors: Anne Heywood, Valentina Cortese, Frank Finlay, Irene Papas, John Phillip Law, Ian Bannen and the stunning Marisa Mell; a funky music score by Stelvio Cipriani which borrows from the Goblin score for George Romero's 'DAWN OF THE DEAD' and wonderfully surreal cinematography from Guglielmo Mancori who did his fill of Spaghetti Westerns but the film just doesn't gell.  The real flaw is the transfer.  The reviewers are quite right, it looks like a second generation VHS bootleg which fluctuates from light to extreme dark making it difficult to appreciate some of the images.  The film is directed by Pier Carpi who also wrote the book 'L'OMBRA NELL OMBRA'of which this version also bears the title.  It should have been called 'SATAN'S DAUGHTER' because the character of Daria is the offspring between Satan and a human host sent to Earth to kill the pope.  It's a shame, the film looks like it could be a decent, little time waster but in this condition, its hard to tell.  The 3 stars are for some of the images and music.  For Euro-completists only.",1292112000,6,1236,4.742990654205608
8380246,2,B002TLRGA0,"MYA must be an acronym for 'Mislead Your Audience' because, with very few exceptions, all of their releases are sourced from the WORST possible prints - they appear to be 3rd generation VHS copies, with rolling picture lines, glitches and blemishes galore, poor audio, no contrast, washed out or flaming 'hot' colors, you name it - if it's anything that makes your viewing experience painful, it's right there.

It appears to be a goal or hidden agenda of theirs - even when they re-release movies on the now-defunct NoShame label, whose audio and video were impeccable and had tons of extras, MYA finds a wretched copy  of  the film and releases it bare-bones - no featurettes, trailers, bios, filmographies,  inserts, etc. AND they're charging Criterion release pricing for these atrocities!

Another despicable, deceptive practice of theirs is to re-title a film and use a different cover on the release, so you think you've stumbled onto a rarity to add to your collection, only to find out when you get home that it's something you already have; only your copy is far superior. And I've purchased more than one flick that's been edited, apparently with a chainsaw, to add insult to financial injury. One bummer after another...

So what do we, the poor slobs who keep them in business, do about the heinous crimes committed against us?  I, for one, tire of lambasting them here on Amazon (read all the reviews I've written about their releases), so I'm calling on you to join me in BOYCOTTING MYA COMMUNICATION releases until that time comes when they begin respecting their core audience, the rabid fans of all things Eurocult, Gaillo, Eurosleaze, Crime Dramas and Eurohorror. Fight the future, my friends, and hit them where they've been nailing us - in the pocketbook.

Sorry I'm not reviewing the film, as it's barely watchable due to all I've referenced above, but it's a stinker as well. Which is a real drag seeing as I love Marisa Mell, and her paired again with John Phillip Law ('Danger Diabolik') gave me high expectations, which were lowered by the time the opening credits rolled due to the wretched picture. Save your coin and search elsewhere for your enjoyment.
Divorce yourself from 'Satan's Wife'.",1283385600,12,2220,4.9013333333333335
