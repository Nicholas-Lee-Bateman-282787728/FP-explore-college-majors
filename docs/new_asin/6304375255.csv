854852,3,6304375255,"A classic comedy about the world famous robbery.  Peter Falk is a petty thief who realizes how easy it would be to rob the Brinks company. ""I own this joint"" Falk says after he takes his crew through the building on a tour to prepare for when they will come back. Where is the DVD of this movie?  Very funny and well acted by a cast of name actors, Peter Falk, Peter Boyle, Warren Oates, Paul Sorvino etc.  The problem here is that this DVD version is not from a studio pressing.  It was burnt by Amazon.com, I'm assuming with permission from the studio.  The movie is wide screen but this version is a squeazed together 4X3.  I set my TV to ""stretch"" and the picture was perfect.  Also the sound goes in and out I have to keep adjusting the volume.  Finally there are no menus at all, and no closed captioning.  The movie just starts with the FBI copywrite warning.  I'm keeping this movie because as flawed as this DVD is it is the only copy I have of this classic movie.  I would like to know why Amazon is selling DVDs that are no better than bootlegged versions of movies, and why isn't Universal honestly giving this movie a proper release.",1116720000,15,1146,4.308411214953271
854853,4,6304375255,"THE BRINK'S JOB is a suspenseful crime film inspired by the sensational Brink's robbery in Massachusetts after World War II. In some respects it is reminiscent of TOKAPI.Peter Falk heads an excellent cast which also includes Warren Oates, Peter Boyle, Alan Garfield, Paul Servino and Gena Rowlands. Warren Oates plays the part of the infamous Specs O'Keefe.
THE DEER HUNTER dominated the Academy Awards competition in 1978. THE BRINK'S JOB failed to receive any nominations but it was still a fairly entertaining movie.",1079308800,6,519,5.265060240963855
854854,5,6304375255,"The Brink's Job movie is about the 1950 Brink's robbery in Boston.  Peter Falk, Peter Boyle, and Paul Sorvino (yes, Paul Sorvino, MANY years before Goodfellas), are three of the low level crooks who mastermind the robbery of a Brink's location in Boston.
Brinks Job is funny and entertaining, and at times it is edge-of-your-seat exciting.  There is great dialogue throughout, especially from Peter Falk's character, Tony Pino.  There are superb supporting performances throughout.  The plot moves in a great rhythm; it held my interest from start to finish.  The movie really had the flavor of Boston, too.
I am a fan of many of the actors in this, such as Gena Rowlands, also wonderful as Tony Pino's wife.  Sheldon Leonard turns in a good performance in a smaller role as J. Edgar Hoover.
After I watched the film, I read that Brink's Job was directed by William Friedkin, director of French Connection and The Exorcist, two more great movies of that era. It's no surprise that Brink's Job turned out so well.
If you like crime caper movies, you ought to take a look at Brink's Job.

855025,5,6304375255,"Interesting period film starring Falk and Boyle. Great period feel, fun, but credible at the same time  Entertaining account of one of the greatest robberies of all time. Peter Falk, as a master mind thief instead of his usual role as a genius detective, what more could you want?  Peter Boyle and Warren Oates head an all-star cast in this rather amusing account of the Brink's office robbery in Boston in the early 50's. See how they do it, and, almost, get away with  it. Watching it, you'll be pulling for the ""bad"" guys for a change.

I would call it a low key action drama thriller. ""The Brinks Job"" isn't so much about an ingenious robbery. Truth be told anybody at the right place and time with pliers and a pair of tweezers could have pulled off ""the crime of the century"". It isn't so much that the caper was so ingenious but that the powers that were Brinks would allow themselves to be vulnerable to neighborhood mugs. Brinks' reputation was on par with that of General Motors, U.S. Steel, and Pan Am. That probably explains why the government invested 25 million dollars to a heist that netted 1.5 million dollars and were only able to recover $50,000.00. This is an eminently enthralling film.

I don't know anyone who dislikes this film. It's not The Godfather but still its an enjoyable well made film to enjoy!",1431302400,,1327,4.582278481012659

855157,5,6304375255,"The Director found a way to essentially make a Black comedy out of a serious crime - to include the viewer in the gang, in a way.

Astonishing period detail - a feast for antique car fanatics!

What a cast! Do I n eed to reel off the names. Peter Falk absolutely great - maybe his work in The Rat Race is comparable. We see a typically bravura performance from Paul Sorvino, twelve years shy of ""Goodfellas"". Warren Oates, is amazing as the the eccentric genius...a true war hero...who has zero *civilian* common sense. Will he be the one ""to crack""?

One of those films to be enjoyed at any time; to be discussed in almost any social setting.

Where's the DVD?",1282176000,7,661,4.39344262295082
855158,5,6304375255,Other reviews are right on the money. Brinks got kicked in the teeth cause they let their guard down.  Some petty operators were able to boost the money becuase Brinks relied on their big name and past success to intimidate would-be crooks.  I heard these guys lived on the money the rest of their lives without showing off.
