7900382,5,7885142469,"I considered Gallants to be the most fun I've had watching a new movie from Hong Kong or China, in a very long time.  If you are a fan of the old Shaw Brothers studios (and independent) kung fu films of the '70s and early '80s, this movie will give you a feeling of nostalgia.  The opening theme music is a nod to that of Fist of Fury (a.k.a., The Chinese Connection).

Leung Siu-Lung (a.k.a., Bruce Leung, Bruce Liang) in particular hasn't missed a beat with his physical martial arts skills, and Chen Kuan-Tai has a great chance to showcase his acting ability.  I won't go into the details of the story, only that Gallants has some very funny moments, and some sad moments as well.  It's a fairly nondescript homage to the kung fu movie genre that also feels like a farewell to that era.  These film veterans were at their peaks at a time when the industry was loaded with talent.  Unfortunately, there is no comparable younger generation of onscreen kung fu performers who will be taking their place.

Other old-time Shaw Bros actors featured include:  Lo Meng, Chan Wai-Man, Susan Shaw (Shaw Yin-Yin, virtually unrecognizable as the sex siren who seduced Fu Sheng's character in Chinatown Kid, back in 1977), and Ku Kuan-Chung in a walk-on as a police officer.  Teddy Robin-Kwan is excellent as the old master who awakes from a coma after 30 years.

The version I purchased is the 2011 Region 1 release by Tokyo Shock, and the transfer is beautiful, with no flaws that I could detect.",1331856000,,1488,4.598484848484849
7900383,4,7885142469,"Imagine my surprise when I put this DVD into my region 1 DVD player and it would not play. When I put it into my all region DVD player, however, it would play, but only after a fashion. At various point in the DVD, it skipped and hung, which makes me suspect that this is a bootleg DVD. If you only have a region 1 DVD player, do not buy Gallants from ECLECTIC GOODS as it will not play. If you are concerned about buying bootleg goods, I would also steer clear of ECLECTIC GOODS as I have no confidence that this is a legitimate copy of this movie.",1318636800,,549,4.045871559633028
7900384,4,7885142469,"This is a great ""throw back"" to the good old 70's kung fu flicks. The plot is somewhat standard, but I think that's intentional. The action sequences are good, but a little sparse. The overall tone is playful. The real beauty of this film, to me, is the production value. Great colors, lighting, cinematography. The filmmakers took care to give this movie a kung fu ""feeling"". If you enjoy the culture of Hong Kong cinema fan you'll enjoy this movie. If you're just looking for straight up action you might be a little disappointed.",1303257600,,532,4.670212765957447
7900385,5,7885142469,"Directors Clement Cheng and Derek Kwok have a winner on their hands with this feel-good martial arts movie that stars some of the old Shaw Brothers actors in very appropriate roles considering their age. The plot is described on this Amazon page so I won't get into that. I will say that the action delivers. The spectacular kung fu was choreographed by the renowned Yuen Tak, who wisely rejected fancy wire-work, offering instead sparring sessions which are realistic and extremely riveting to watch. The actors (most of whom have so many years of experience) put together some credible and exciting martial arts moves for the screen. Editing is also wonderfully done so that we get the best views at the front seats of a bout without the usual MTV-styled quick editing nonsense. I guarantee no matter how many martial arts films that you've seen, the action sequences in Gallants will still blow your mind away. This DVD itself is great. It is a dual layer disc, and the picture is sharp. The audio is available in both the original Cantonese and Mandarin dub, with excellent English subtitles. There are a number of English subtitled special features available including Photo Gallery, Trailer, Making Of, and Music Video",1282608000,,1224,4.946601941747573
