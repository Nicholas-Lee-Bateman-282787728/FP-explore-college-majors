7129676,1,B00WAZHRIG,"I can't even begin to describe how awful this movie is. It's so sad, because people spent a lot of time, effort, and money on a movie that makes absolutely no sense. The plot barely exists, only to build to a climax where nothing really happens. The acting is really awful, and tragically it never gets to be so bad it's charming. The writer-director-star who plays the director of the Millwood center really stands out as the worst of the worst. He brings every one of his co-stars down whenever they appear with him on screen. Off camera, I don't know what he was watching but you can see that his actors are being completely misdirected by someone still stunned by the fact that someone is actually paying him to do this. Combine that with terrible editing and some genuine My-First-Sony grade camera work, and you've got a movie that is almost physically painful to endure. I really wish I could un-see this movie.",1441584000,6,918,4.603658536585366
7129677,2,B00WAZHRIG,The movie the The Orphange is a very bad movie. The script could have been better and the acting was terrible.. Save your money do not purchase this movie.,1439164800,6,155,4.379310344827586
7129678,1,B00WAZHRIG,"Poorly made movie with really bad acting. This is not the same movie as ""The Orphanage"" (2007) which I have never seen, but has great reviews. The movie jacket is the best thing going for it, and the young male star of the movie was a better actor than any of the adults. Bad story, poor acting, and the movie jacket was the scariest thing about the film. Absolute waste of time.",1437868800,9,379,4.277777777777778
7129680,1,B00WAZHRIG,"Worst movie ever. There is no plot. Feel like this movie, was half written. Why market a movie that only has parts of the story. Low budget film with low budget actors except for Nathan and the therapist. Wish I could give no stars..",1471564800,3,233,4.318181818181818
7129681,2,B00WAZHRIG,"""The Orphanage"" and ""The Institute"" are the same film. It is titled ""Milwood"" [sic] at IMDB as a 2013 film. The repackaging and renaming of the product failed to improve it for some reason, but did increase sales and rentals.

Nathan (Christian Goodwin) arrives at the Milwood Institute after his parents die and he didn't get his puppy. He is cared for by child counselor Judy (Michelle Romano) the closets thing to eye-candy and the not so caring dean (Jimmy Scanlon). He is bullied by Tommy (Adam J. Freeman) until they both wind up in the bad boy ward, rumored to be haunted.

Nothing to see here, mini plot spoiler, it is not haunted. In fact this should not be sold as a horror film, but is more akin to a ""Lifetime"" drama (which I find to be a horror for a different reason).

Guide: Redbox $1.60 US rental. 1 F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1471564800,3,842,4.419354838709677
7129682,1,B00WAZHRIG,This movie was absolute garbage. If you buy it please do us all a favor and throw it in the trash. I had really high hopes for this movie just to be let down like a really bad tease. I gave it a 1 star just because there isn't an option for anything less.,1471392000,3,255,3.740740740740741
7129683,1,B00WAZHRIG,"Atrocious exercise in emotional child abuse has a child named Nathan who has lost his parents and been sent to a state run (?) orphanage where he is bullied by students and punished for responding to the bullying by the even worse staff, who are indifferent, incompetent or even worse bullies than the children.  The whole thing is designed to make the audience frustrated and angry but an idiot could elicit those emotions with little dramatic purpose or finesse, which is what is done here.  If there is a more artless and ugly exercise in pointless emotional manipulation than The Orphanage to come around in recent years then I haven't seen it.  This is just a bad and stupid film, horribly written and directed and pure torture for any viewer unfortunate enough to sit through this garbage.  Don't make that mistake.",1467158400,5,821,4.801418439716312
7129684,2,B00WAZHRIG,"This is not a horror movie. More like an open-ended drama. This movie is full of hints and suggestions - Never does it say in script or in picture what really happens. Also, there are slightly disturbing scenes, but absolutely nothing, and i mean NOTHING scary as far as a horror movie is concerned. This movie is set up to be appreciated only by the few who enjoy this particular type of movie.",1454025600,2,395,4.424657534246576
7129685,5,B00WAZHRIG,"It's a really good movie.
The other posters did not pay attention....it's the kind of movie that leaves things open to interpretation.
The cops blasted the dean in the head because it was apparent he was part of some kind of bizarre plot to lobotomize kids for heaven knows what reason. As far as why the children act like loonies in ward b who knows. I thought it was a good movie.
It's true that the acting isn't too great in certain respects but it's kreepy as heck.
Watch this at 2 AM and tell me it doesn't freak you out. What would be good would be an explanation by the director as to what happened to the kooky ""dr"" and the rest of the staff at the institution.",1449619200,2,669,4.1937984496124034
7129686,1,B00WAZHRIG,"When I was in the video store with my family, I happened to look at a movie called, The Orphanage. I thought maybe this was like, The Orphan, where the girl is actually 40 years old and decides she wants to kill her host family, but with a 10 year old boy in an orphanage who seeks vengeance on the staff of the orphanage who have killed him or let him die, as what the cover leads you on to believe. This movie was so terrible that my sister and I both just went along with the reality of this just being the Chi-Mo Chronicles (Child Molester Chronicles) because of the simple that it wasn't scary AT ALL, just some trippy pedo-induced movie about a director who needs to learn a thing or two about personal space with minors and with his anger problems. Every time we tried to figure out the plot, it completely swerved into something that had no purpose in the movie. This was just pure awful. I was extremely disappointed with this movie as should the directors and producers... Nice touch with the unnecessary music.",1448496000,,1021,4.407407407407407
7129687,1,B00WAZHRIG,"*Spoilers ahead--but I'm saving you an hour and a half that you'll never get back*

With it being Halloween last night, my sister and I hit up our local video store with the intention of renting Guillermo del Toro's 2007 horror film The Orphanage, which had largely positive reviews on IMBD, Rotten Tomatoes, etc. Instead, the video store employee gave us this pile of steaming garbage. About 5 minutes in we realized we were given the wrong film, but we decided to tough it out, despite the dissent of my teenage niece and nephew who both said ""OMG, this looks like a horrible movie."" Well...they couldn't have been more correct.

As am optimist, I try to see the positive in everything, so I feel obligated to say at least one good thing about this film. The movie jacket is pretty interesting, and that's about it. Also, the young male actor who plays Nathan in the movie gave what was practically an Oscar winning performance, compared to the band of adult actors--who must have been rejected from every community theater production in the country.

Bad acting, a laughable screenplay, and there is virtually no plot--other than the much repeated vague notion from an overly helpful child therapist that ""there is something very wrong at this place."" This movie consists of the young lead being yelled at by the creepy orphanage director for basically existing and him awaking startled on multiple nights to a shadowy figure in the hallway. It was spoken aloud that the orphanage was haunted, but that plot point never really went beyond the appearance of the shadow figure. Then it was hinted that there might be some kind of pedophile ring involving the institution's director and doctor, which came from a couple of very uncomfortable scenes of unnecessarily close contact with the young lead that made me want to call Chris Hansen to tell these gentlemen to ""Have a seat right over there."" Finally, within the last 20 minutes of this disaster, it was revealed that the doctor was lobotomizing the kids who even showed the slightest sign of acting out, and this was apparently the plan for Nathan all along. We then learn from a rushed soliloquy from the male lead had been working all along with the child therapist and who I'm guessing was the property's gardener (his position was never really revealed--he was just kind of there) to bust the place for its cruel practices. This results in the police rushing in as Nathan is on the operating table and blowing the brains (or what looks like to be confetti, red dye, and corn syrup) out of the director in the dramatic conclusion.

I just...no. There is so much confusion. It's as if a D film student at a community college decided to hit the bong, write a horror screenplay, and shoot a film over the course of a few days with random people on the street. Please don't waste your time.",1446336000,15,2845,4.71830985915493
7129688,5,B00WAZHRIG,I love this movie so much! I rented this movie and after viewing it. I went and bought it immediately. Just when I thought I had the movie figured out it would twist on me. Great acting! Michelle Romano is awesome in this film. A must have!,1443744000,5,240,4.127659574468085
8712714,1,B00WAZHRIG,"Holy Crap!  This movie is a total embarrassment!  I am afraid to go to sleep to tonite, not because this movie was scary but because I actually watched it for 15 minutes!  I fear for my judgement!",1485561600,,196,4.243243243243243
8712715,4,B00WAZHRIG,"Seems to me all the bad reviews are coming from people who text while the movie's on. There was nothing the matter with the acting. The actor playing the lead character was outstanding. You could not ask for more from a young actor playing this kind of part. It wasn't the greatest movie ever made, but the movie held its own. It will keep your interest if you are actually watching the movie and paying attention.",1483660800,,414,4.4605263157894735
8712716,1,B00WAZHRIG,"The movie is essentially a crescendo to nothing. The summary of the movie states that the boy's experiences unleash a sinister evil that no one saw coming and no one could control. Simply put, this does not happen. It's 88 minutes of a boy being yelled at in a mental ward and 2 minutes of the people responsible being arrested. Not bad enough to be good, just lame.",1482969600,,366,4.397058823529412

8712719,1,B00WAZHRIG,"Director Jimmy Scanlon clearly tried to mislead viewers and we confused this movie with the highly IMDB reviewed 2007 movie of the same title.

And it's not even one of those movies that's ""so bad it's good"". No. It's just plain bad.",1476230400,4,371,4.552238805970149
8712720,1,B00WAZHRIG,By far the worst movie ive seen,1473465600,2,31,3.5714285714285716
8712721,1,B00WAZHRIG,"ZERO Star Rating if possible. I rented this from Redbox. This movie is a waste of 91 minutes of your life. The ONLY 5 star review MUST have been someone involved in making the film. No wonder there is no name associated with it. Read the reviews of others who have watched if i have not already convinced you NOT to buy, nor rent it. Watch the other movie called the orphanage. This movie really is a waste of more than just 91 minutes of your life. Wasted time going to redbox, time searching for a horror movie, time entering in my zip code, swiping card, writing this review, returning the movie to redbox... I want to save you from all the forms of wastefulness this movie will cause you and your family, not to mention any mental deterioration in sitting through it thinking things weill get better. A true waste of redbox space as well.",1472860800,3,842,4.403846153846154
8712722,1,B00WAZHRIG,"You know how they say people always have regrets right before they die? Well, I would like to help people avoid having watched this movie be one of the the things they regret on their deathbed.

Amazon really needs to allow zero star reviews. Even a zero star review is way too good for this movie. It actually caused us mental anguish to watch this movie. So why did you watch this movie to the end if it was really that bad, I hear you saying? There were a couple of reasons. I'm sure you're familiar with people saying that something was so horrible but they just couldn't look away? This movie was like that, but even that probably wouldn't have kept us watching the movie until the end. The second thing is that I think the people who made this movie knew just how awful it was so they decided to try and deceive people into watching it. We thought we were watching another movie with the same title that has very good reviews. This was not just a silly mistake. If you do a search on the Internet you will be hard pressed to find this movie. Only the other movie with the same title comes up. THIS movie was renamed to give it the same title as the good movie with the same name. There is all kinds of deception involved with this piece of garbage that doesn't deserve to be called a movie. It gives home movies a bad name.

Let's start with the picture you see here with the little boy holding the knife. There is no one like that in the movie. Then there is the description of the movie that describes the boy who actually does appear in the movie as evil. He is NOT evil in any way. At least I have never heard anyone describe victims of child abuse as evil.

The movie itself is literally bad in EVERY way. I have never seen a movie so comprehensively bad. The cast is clearly not comprised of actors. Apparently, whoever made the movie just asked some friends, and maybe family members, if they would like to be in a movie. They probably worked for free, but they were still overpaid. They can't act at all, none of them. They also have no personality. There is nothing even remotely interesting about any of them, it's like they had their personalities removed. The camera work looks like it was done by a monkey. The sound is a joke. It sounds like it was done in a bathroom. The music appears to be a guy occasionally playing on the piano. It's terrible. The only good thing you can say about this movie is that it will eventually end after what seems like five hours. (Even though it's only ninety-one minutes long.)

Watch the other movie with the same name!",1472256000,4,2574,4.31198347107438
8712723,2,B00WAZHRIG,"Misleading pic on DVD case makes you think it's going to be one of those haunted orphanage stories.  NOPE.  It's more of a drama about the adults taking any kids they deem to be bad and, well, just think of what happens to MacMurphy at the end of Cuckoo's nest.  The acting from the young boy playing the lead character is the only good thing here.",1472083200,,348,4.242424242424242
