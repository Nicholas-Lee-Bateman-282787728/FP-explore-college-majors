Where today's movies depend on CGI, sex and violence, Miss Stanwyck was the movie.  She could do it all.  This DVD shows it, too.",1414022400,9,261,4.608695652173913

5837847,5,B00DNQA16G,"Four movies selling for less than the price of Virginia Wolf alone. It was a no brainier for me. The other three movies are typical Burton /Taylor forbidden love stories. Comedians was a somewhat interesting view of Papa Doc's Haiti. Alec Guiness role seemed odd and poorly edited for continuity.. Sandpiper is sort of a throw away. Have not watched VIP, but it appears to have fair reviews. The gem here is Virgina Wolf. An aging couple verbally tearing each other apart as well as taking prisoners. Remember these were all A list movies, so they run about two hours each. You may want to fast forward thru them.

5837859,5,B00DNQA16G,"Miss Stanwyck is brilliant in all four of these films, even though I had absolutely no interest in the Annie Oakley movie. It was still watchable. There is no such thing in my experience as a bad Barbara Stanwyck movie. I ordered this set for Baby Face and East Side West Side. I have a great attachment to both of these films.

Insofar as the packaging I wish TCM and other such vendors wouldn't sell sets like these without a divider, and all four movies squeezed together onto one ""button"". Got to maximize those profits right? Oh well. Still highly worth it. (smile).",1458950400,,571,4.543689320388349

5837864,2,B00DNQA16G,"well, Liz never was a great actress but boy oh boy......what lame movies."" Who's Afraid..."" is the best of the lot. Richard Burton seems to lose his acting greatness when he's paired with Liz. Don't get me wrong, I love Liz, as she was one of the perfect commodities of the 50's Hollywood era.
I also want to say that I hate the packaging.....all four cd's piled onto each other! what's that about?",1447718400,3,398,4.465753424657534

5837874,4,B00DNQA16G,"This is a great movie collection for anyone who loves watching Taylor and Burton films. Nice to see that Amazon has even discounted the price, just in time for the holidays.

My fav of these films is The V.I.P.s , I thought Liz Taylor was especially good in this one, not so great in the Sandpiper. Richard Burton could pretty well just talk about anything in a film and I'd enjoy it, that man had the sexiest voice of any actor I think, ever to light up a movie screen. ;-) They both looked so great in these movies too, at their peak professionally and obviously the chemistry was there, given where they were at in their relationship during this time, in real life.

I'm taking off 1 star for the way these DVDs are packaged, all placed on one spindle inside the case. Why TCM does this, I don't know. It's not optimal packaging that's for sure and without care, SO easy to scratch a DVD while taking them on and off this spindle. That is something that really should be looked at.

Other than that, great collection, great price and good reproduction too although at times the volume did go up and down a  bit, while watching The V.I.P.s. That could be our TV though, it's kind of ancient. ;-)

8595270,4,B00DNQA16G,"I guess I wouldn't have gotten this if it weren't for ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,"" which has to be about the best adaptation of a stage play to the screen in all film history.  The performances are absolutely spectacular, and the impact of the play is totally intact.  But the other movies are well worth seeing as well, filled with some of the top talent of midcentury, like Alec Guiness, Eva Marie Saint, Louis Jourdan, Peter Ustinov.  The Sandpiper was written by Dalton Trumbo, with a nice plot which nonetheless creaks a bit with Hollywood trying to represent the hip artistic counterculture of the '60's.  I especially liked ""The Comedians,"" from a Graham Greene story about Haiti.  Not the best Graham Greene adaptation for sure, but plenty interesting.  If you bought ""Virginia Woolf"" separately, the price would be about the same.",1528243200,,844,4.908450704225352
8595271,5,B00DNQA16G,"These 4 films shows Elizabeth Taylor at her mature best, especially since with husband Burton she found the perfect artist/personal match for her talents, which did not shy away from very important human concerns.

8595276,5,B00DNQA16G,"I'm only echoing those who have written for many years that Barbara Stanwyck was a very talented actress--of the golden age of cinema and ever, really. As a woman, I love Stanwyck's portrayal of strong women who face challenges straight on and overcome setbacks and tragedy with a sense of courage and vulnerability that she could tap into just as well as being defiant. I won't summarize the films because I don't understand why one should ruin endings, give play by play details and so on for someone who is thinking of buying the product. I will say that this set really does give a sample of the range that Barbara Stanwyck had as an actress.

- ""Baby Face"" is a precode and was pretty racy for the era but is very interesting today as her character makes a new life for herself by getting even after having been on the other side. I saw this years ago and enjoyed seeing it again.
-""Annie Oakley"" is a biopic of the early part of Oakley's career with a bit of fiction to go with it and enjoyable.
-""My Reputation"" I saw some years ago and was my least favorite out of these films simply because of certain parts in the writing. (I am a writer and tend to pay close attention to scripts when watching a film.) But I did enjoy Stanwyck portraying a more timid woman and found the contrast of the values of the 1940s on certain topics vs today interesting.
-""East Side West Side"" is one of my favorites out of the set. I had never seen it before and loved the dialogue, the character development and so on.

Overall I would suggest this set to fans who don't have these films in their collection, which was why I purchased this. Or to introduce the work of Barbara Stanwyck to someone as a gift. Some other great films of hers to see are ""The Lady Eve"" , ""Sorry Wrong Number"" and ""Ball of Fire"" but she had such a long career and worked in other genres, such as westerns. Hopefully it'll be only instinctive that you'd want to further explore her work beyond this excellent set.",1493424000,,1980,4.377717391304348
