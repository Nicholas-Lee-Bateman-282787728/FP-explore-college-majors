4672020,1,B005F3XV4Y,"How could you take such an excellent book and rewrite the entire thing, changing the moods, relationships and basically, the entire plot, save the imaginery friend?  Who would take such wonderful dialogue and narration of the book and replace it with a Hallmark Channel chick flick?  This should've had the feel of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" about a halfway frumpy girl who lives in the shadow of her mother, then reaffirms who she really is with the help of her best friend from childhood.  And it was supposed to be a romantic comedy.  This has little to no comedy and the lead character is at times creepy.  She was supposed to welcome him, not think he's stalking her and threaten to mace him.  The movie is ho-hum.  Read the book and enjoy at for what it was supposed to be.",1319328000,2,779,4.4822695035460995
4672021,5,B005F3XV4Y,"saw this first when it came out last dec. 2010. fell absolutely in love with it,,, was so pleased when they put it on dvd! i never get tired of seeing it! lazy sunday afternoon love story.and the ending is perfect:)",1319328000,,215,4.2682926829268295
4672022,5,B005F3XV4Y,"I absolutely love this movie. The characters have great on screen chemistry which makes this movie all the better to watch. If you like movies about friendship, true love, or are a fan of James Patterson then you will love Sundays at Tiffanys. This is one of the better movies that I have seen in a long time.

Short Summary (May Contain Spoilers):
Jane's mom doesn't pay her much attention as a child so she has an imaginary friend named Michael. They do everything together until Jane gets to be a certain age. Years later Jane is engaged to Hugh and another man comes into Jane's life. Now Jane must decide whats real and whats not and who she wants to be with or who she doesn't. Can Jane finally find true love...

I have read the book as well as watched the movie. Granted the book and movie differ some but it is still an awesome movie. I have come to realize that movies cannot do books total justice because there is not enough time to do so but it comes pretty close. If you are going to compare book to movie word for word then you will be disappointed but if you are willing to have an open mind I think you will love Sundays at Tiffany's.",1318204800,10,1151,4.251141552511416
4672023,2,B005F3XV4Y,"I liked the book a lot. The story was beautiful. But this movie didn't do the book justice. Not only the story about the imaginary friend was wrong (he stays at a constant age), and the actress who portrays the mom character was a bad choice... The character in the book was much better!",1318032000,3,287,4.333333333333333
4672024,5,B005F3XV4Y,"SPOILER ALERT: It won't win any Oscars (unless I was giving them out), but this is a dreamy, romantic movie. The female lead (Alyssa Milano) was raised by a detached mother and she found solace in the love and friendship of an imaginary friend (Eric Winter). When she turned a certain age he had to leave (not sure why, it was just time). She never got over him and always longed for him. Well, eventually she got engaged to someone else and was about to get married to please her mother and meet social expectations. Somehow the male lead was able to come back as a real person just in time to try to win her back. The story is about how true love never fades and how the power of love can overcome anything. I definitely cried at the (happy) ending.

*This movie was made from the book, but I haven't read it becuase the reviews made it sound kind of weird (he fell in love with her when he was an adult and she was a child), but the movie has none of that. He is a little boy when she is a little girl and they age at the same time.",1315267200,30,1035,4.073529411764706

4672104,3,B005F3XV4Y,"Low budget made originally for TV movie very lightly based on a top selling novel back in its day of the same name by James Patterson and children's author Gabrielle Charbonnet.  Most of the plot of the novel isn't followed in the movie and the movie has major changes such as Michael who was the same age throughout the novel who is the invisible friend/babysitter, is now the same age as Jane the little girl when she was 10 (was 8 in the book) when he walked out on her life and 20 years later is the same age as her as an adult.  The movie doesn't make you wonder if Michael is a real person and thereby a creepy threat and it's just Jane's mind that thinks he's invisible because he has told her he is imaginary and if fact is simply not spoken to most of the time by others because he's hired help. Or if he's actually as he claims and Jane believes, an imaginary friend. In the movie we have no doubt that no one else can see him when Jane is a child and he acts surprised that a truck driver can see him when he reappears as an adult 20  years later.  The movie just sets up the storyline that he is an imaginary friend and has returned, although it never really gives a satisfactory explanation as to why or really even attempts to.  Because of these factors the movie becomes a very predictable story line, what you assume will happen at the start is how the movie plays out.

Like most TV movies this one follows the formula of unknown actors to keep the costs down with the exception of a well known face from a former popular for a few years TV show to get viewers to watch it.  This one has Alyssa Milano from Charmed as Jane. She portrays a perfectly likable Jane but again one that's nothing like the book.",1476057600,,1722,4.2

Sure, it's unrealistic, but I don't generally watch movies because they're true.  I watch them to take me away from my life for a couple hours.

4672174,1,B005F3XV4Y,"Sunday's At Tiffany's started out with an okay, though far-fetched, premise which indicated potential for a decent, feel-good movie. It seemed to me that a movie about a woman whose childhood imaginary friend becomes a real man she loves would be family friendly, what with the adorable children and the childlike innocence later portrayed by Michael, the imaginary-turned-real man. He misinterprets innuendos with the innocence one might expect from a childhood imaginary friend, yet--SURPRISE--he has sexual relations with the protagonist, who is engaged to another man. Infidelity is portrayed to be completely okay; Even though we are given to understand that the protagonist's fiance is not of shining character, at least he was faithful to her, from what we see in the movie. Yet, somehow his inability to tell the protagonist her favorite color is a worse offense than her infidelity, which has absolutely zero consequences. Unrealistic (and not just because of the Pinocchio'esque storyline) and disappointing.",1436400000,3,1018,5.490445859872612
4672175,4,B005F3XV4Y,"I love the movie. My only complaint is the dvd version compared to the television version is much darker. There are parts on the dvd that are hard to see. Since I recorded the movie on my tv off of LMN, I know what the parts look like that are dark. I know it's not your fault. I still love the movie. I have told many of my friends about this movie and was considering buying another for a gift, but I'll have to think about it due to the darkness.",1435708800,,449,3.9450549450549453

The acting is superb as Alyssa Milano stars as Jane Claremont and opens the movie at age 9 as she goes to Tiffanys in New York on Sunday, every Sunday as a young child, with her mother and imaginary friend, Michael. The movies spans over a twenty year period, Jane from age 9 to 29.  At age 9, Michael leaves Jane only to show up again when Jane is 29 and engaged to be married.  All grown up, Jane is living in the real word--she thinks, only to have Michael reappear to help realize what true love really is.  A must see!",1400889600,,585,4.15929203539823

My only regret is that the movie could have done without the ""bedroom"" scene, then I would have allowed a child to watch it with me.  That sex scene was just so unnecessary to the story that I toke a star off for that alone.

When Michael comes back as a human adult, and he can't let go of the little girl he knew, it comes across as weird instead of endearing. And when the leads finally get together, there is chemistry but there is still this nagging part that says that this is really weird.

4672361,2,B005F3XV4Y,"Watched this movie last night.  Previously read the book.  Comparing the two I was afraid that the movie wouldnt do the book justice and basically the book *was* better, but the story overall lacked in so many ways.  *Spoiler Warning* The movie didn't spend as much time as the book did on the yearly Breakfast at Tiffany's or it being her birthday, so the meaning was lost unless you were familiar with the book.  This was the same for the jewelry store scenes also.  So the viewer might wonder why they keep mentioning repeated visits to these places when you only see a few visits.  I was also afraid that the age choices they chose for the main characters would be too young, but Alyssa Milano pulls it off very well.  Her mother (Stockard Channing) didn't age throughout the movie.  She was old when the movie starts out years prior, and she appears just as old 20 years later. Although, she did replicate the mother in the book quite well on screen.  There was one moment during a wedding scene where the mother says to the approaching florist ""no more carnations, we need yellow roses!"".  The florist is HOLDING YELLOW ROSES! so did Stockard get her line wrong or did the prop crew hand her the wrong flowers?  I am thinking it was the prop crew since the official wedding flowers are yellow roses. The movie/book was frustrating as Michael returns 20 years later, and just when Jane falls in love with him, he tells her he must leave her AGAIN. Having her heart ripped out at ten years old was bad enough, but to have it ripped out again just didn't make any sense.  So why did he return?  They never say.

*FAMILY ALERT* This movie, its cover, and its story seem fine enough for family viewing, but be forewarned there is a lovemaking scene that leaves nothing to the imagination.  While they are fairly covered with a white bed sheet, Janes bare legs are out of the sheets and bent while Michael is naked down to his lower waist and thrusting upon her.  The scene seems to go on forever and just sits on this image for too long.  We get the idea, and its a little much.  This is also taking place while Jane is engaged and to be married to another man in only a few more days.

Eric Winter who plays Michael is very good, as is her friend Kristen Booth.  I didn't care for Ivan Sergei playing Hugh.  The movie runs about an hour and a half though I wouldn't want to watch it again.",1327449600,4,2391,4.37641723356009
4672362,5,B005F3XV4Y,"As if Audrey Hepburn didn't make Tiffany's special enough, here comes this enchanting Lifetime movie to do its part. Peep the premise: In New York City, each Sunday, little Jane Claremont and her self-involved mom (Stockard Channing) follow a tradition of visiting Tiffany's. It's at Tiffany's, back when she was five and three quarters years old, that the lonely Jane first met her imaginary friend, a boy named Michael, and they've been tight ever since. Except that on her tenth birthday, when the clock struck 5:15pm - which is the moment she was born - Michael went away. And Jane Claremont had to grow up.

Twenty years later, life could not better be for Jane Claremont (Alyssa Milano). She has a successful career managing her mom's often sold out theater. She lives in a spacious New York apartment. She's engaged to Hugh, a handsome, much-in-demand actor (Ivan Sergei). Her nuptials less than thirty days away, the only thing she's stressing about are those nagging final wedding planner decisions (she's yet to pick out the flowers, the cake, the wedding dress...). These are good problems to have.

Into Jane's perfect life steps her childhood imaginary friend, Michael, now all grown up and making chaos of serenity. Michael (Eric Winter), for his part, is mystified by the fact that he's human now, that he's not a kid anymore and that everyone can see him. Rumors of his state has spread like wildfire in the guardian angel community. A fellow imaginary friend reminds Michael: ""We come when they need us and we leave on their birthdays."" Michael can only assume that Jane desperately needs him for something, although Jane at first warily eyes him, like he's a stalker. But Michael's right. Jane needs him, needs her best friend. She just doesn't know it yet.

I didn't expect to find SUNDAYS AT TIFFANY'S as enthralling as I did. But I easily got caught up. Very loosely based on a book by James Patterson and Gabrielle Charbonnet (apparently, only the basic premise and the two leads' names survived the adaptation), this is an irresistible romantic Christmas movie, and I'm a bit put out that I saw it only after the holidays. First off, the two kids actors - Emily Alyn Lind and Gage Munroe - who play the younger Jane and Michael have terrific chemistry. They effortlessly establish the closeness between Jane and Michael. When Michael has to leave, Emily Alyn Lind' tearful reaction is heartbreaking. The kids set a fairly high standard for Milano and Winter to match.

Match it they did. Milano and Winter are naturally great together. Alyssa Milano tones down the sexy somewhat, and she's more effective for it, playing a normal, level-headed career girl. Don't let me mislead you, though, she is still flat out gorgeous. And, throughout the film, she also gets to demonstrate her comic chops. Eric Winter, meanwhile, is just disarming. He brings a charm and exuberance to his role, and it's fun watching his character experience what it's like to be human, to taste food for the first time, or even get slapped. My girl went all ""Awww, so cute!"" when he busted out the MC Hammer moves in that bar. SUNDAYS AT TIFFANY'S won't surprise you much and, no, it doesn't really explore the mythos of Michael's guardian angel role in depth, focusing more on the romantic aspects of the story. At a certain point, if you hadn't yet sussed out which way the wind was blowing, you had to have had a clue, finally, when Jane arrived home and Michael's painted her apartment and fixed her shower and cooked for her. He confesses: ""One of my assignments was Martha Stewart's daughter."" This show of kindness just may be enough for a girl who's about to get married to reassess her life. Meanwhile, Ivan Sergei perseveres with his third wheel role, and it's a bit of a shame since his character of ""Hugh the vain actor"" isn't so bad a fella. I liked him more than Stockard Channing's Vivian (Jane's mom) who could teach Hugh a thing or two about being self-centered.",1326844800,,3975,4.781659388646288

I am thankful when Lifetime or Hallmark makes a new movie, gone are the days when we could enjoy movies of the week, they have been replaced with reality shows and other crap,  Clearly the book has more substance and yes they changed most of the plot, but I do love a cheesy love story on a Sunday afernoon.

4672368,4,B005F3XV4Y,"This movie is different from the book of the same name in almost every way.  That, however, does not a bad movie make.  If one treats the movie and book as separate entities, then one can better judge each.  This movie is about a very serious woman who has lost touch with all of her childhood innocence and fantasies.  From age five until her tenth birthday, Jane had an imaginary friend named Michael.  They did everything together.  They are so close that they even finish one another's sentences.  They make up stories about people they observe and are, in every sense of the word, best friends.  On Jane's tenth birthday, at Tiffany's, Michael must leave to go on to be with another child.  Jump 20 years into the future.  Jane is a grown-up, beautiful professional woman in Manhattan.  She is the theater manager at her mother's theater.  She is very serious and focused on her career and upcoming wedding.  Michael returns as a grown-up and attempts to pick up where they left off when he was forced to leave 20 years earlier.  Their renewed friendship begins slowly and then picks up again almost where they left off.  In this case though, they find themselves falling in love.  Jane once again gets in touch with feelings, emotions, and a sense of fun and adventure that she thought she had lost.  Long story short, Michael is forced to leave her once again and Jane finds that she cannot go through with her scheduled wedding and leaves her groom at the altar, literally.  Michael doesn't leave and the two live happily ever after.  I couldn't bring myself to give the film five stars even though I liked it immensely.  It is a little cheesy, but an excellent movie for a hopeless romantic like me.  It is one of those movies that makes me feel good when I watch it and for that reason I recommend it.",1321833600,,1811,4.544891640866873

I've had this movie recorded and saved on my DVR for almost a year, waiting for it to be released on dvd so I could add it to my collection of Lifetime movies! It's just one of those cute, feel good, makes you believe in love again kind of movies. It's also a nice reminder that it's okay to act like a kid every now and again no matter how old you get! If you have read the book but have yet to see the movie, do not watch this in hopes it will be just like the book. I'm not sure why they always make so many changes when taking a James Patterson book and turning it into a film but it never fails with them. In this case I may be one of the few, but I actually prefer the movie over the book and think it would have gotten better reviews had they just used a different name and gave credit to James Patterson for the idea for the movie. Anyways, with that said, if you are simply looking for a chick flick type of movie that will make you laugh, cry, get goose bumps, and in your mind think ""aww"" several times over then this is the movie for you. Kick back, grab a bowl of ice cream, a fuzzy blanket and enjoy!",1321747200,10,1220,3.9433198380566803
4672370,1,B005F3XV4Y,"I would most certainly not recommend this movie. It is so different from the book in every way. We miss out on key moments in the developing relationship between michael and Jane. A lot of people felt like an adult being the imaginary friend of a little girl whom he later falls in love with would be too disturbing for the movie; so instead they chose to go with michael being portrayed as a little boy, and when he comes back into Jane's life, he is pretty much a little boy thrust into a man's body. You can imagine the awkwardness of watching them sleep together. The whole storyline was strange. All of the scenes we loved in the book, the rollerblading scene, Hugh turning out to be a complete jerk and getting punched by jane, the trip to nantucket, even the death of vivienne was left out of the movie.

Needless to say, this is an absolutely wonderful and whimsical movie if you haven't read the book, however those who have read it, are in for a disapppointment. The characters all have the same names, but that is where the similarities to the book ends. I was very disappointed in this movie.",1321747200,5,1104,4.438423645320197

It picks up again when Jane is an adult and Michael finds himself back in her ""world"" and in her life. Jane has moved on but Michael hasn't. This is a heartwarming story about self discovery, with a happy ending.

Original: This was such a creative idea. I love those movies that combine creative themes with imagination and a happy ending. Although the ending was predictable, it was a feel good movie.",1319846400,,578,4.7227722772277225
4672373,4,B005F3XV4Y,"Alyssa Milano returns with another delightful, and of course, predictable, romantic comedy(RC)- predictable yes, but with a interesting premise.

Summary: we first see the heroine as a lonely child at Tiffany's with her solid but dry mother(Stockard Channing).  The little girl has a boy friend with her.  We find out he's imaginary; her best and probably only friend, and now because she's turning 10, he's leaving her.  She's heartbroken-> cut to 20 years later, now grown up, engaged to handsome, successful actor(Ivan Sergei), her imaginary friend(Eric WInter) returns to her, also grown up. Conflict and fun ensues.

This is a by the book RC:  1. Pretty woman engaged to the wrong person.  Watch her fiance.  Every conversation, one way or another, turns back to him and his life.  It's hilarious.  2. Her real love pops into her life magically; also, there's a small back story about imaginary friends, and the work they do, etc., and 3. There's romantic, heartfelt turmoil- she becomes totally confused about what to do, who to be with, or what's really important in life.

Every RC has a premise, and this one's good, far-fetched more than usual, but enjoyable.  Is the imaginary friend real, will he stay, will love blossom, or will she stay in the 'real' world and do the right thing as per her mother?

The film is well shot and mostly well scripted.  There are a few holes(I know it's fantasy!) especially at the end and how quickly they wrap it up, and there are a couple of really sappy parts- almost groaning, not quite, but over all it's funny and sweet.

Not exactly family friendly, they show a quick bedroom scene- could have easily left it out; however, there's no nudity, violence, or significant language.

In a way, Eric Winter's character remains me of 'Elf'.  Innocent, naive, caring to a fault, stuck in New York City during Christmas season.  Maybe in a hardened, beat-up world and economy with rough and tumble relationships, we all could use more imagination and TLC!

Based on the other reviews: 'read the book= hate the movie'.  Hmmm, maybe I'll read it?",1319587200,,2085,4.836158192090395
