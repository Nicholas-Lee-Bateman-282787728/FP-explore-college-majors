5009163,4,B006OEPRT0,"This movie feels like an 80s horror movie, albeit better. It took some time to develop the characters and try to make them feel real before the killings take place. I felt sorry for a few of those characters when they died.

Sure the movie is gory at times, but it did not over did it. The killings were quick as well. It got over with quickly and moved on top the rest of the plot.

The only thing bad was that the twist at the end, like in all of these movies, was telegraphed at the beginning of the affair.",1327017600,4,510,4.03960396039604

Of course I enjoyed the surprises the first time though, but once you know all the plot twists and character motivations, the second time through is quite a treat.  Each time I watch, I notice more layers of meaning.  Special features make the DVD a worthy purchase, including:

5009166,1,B006OEPRT0,"I wrote a review of this and it never made the site. Because I'm guessing the guy who ""directed"" this mess flagged it, I will keep writing one until it's up. There are three ""reviews"" of this mess. 2 are from people who are praising it to high heaven, like this was Citizen Kane. Both ""reviews"" are up before the movie was out on DVD. Both ""reviews"" are so over-the-top it's embarrassing. They both have ONE review to their credit. This movie. Clearly it's people who worked on the movie. This is NOT well acted, directed and there is ""history lesson"" here. Incorrect Donner party stuff and then it just becomes a terrible written and directed slasher movie with cliched characters that make you wonder if they were making it up as they went along. This movie was supposedly made for $300,000 but if they spend $500 I'd be shocked. It's absolutely terrible. The fact people with NO other ""reviews"" in Amazon are here attacking me shows you it's just folks who worked on this garbage.

Again, proof that people who worked on these crappy shot on video, cast by craigslist awful ""movies"" should NOT be allowd to comment on them here.

The guy ""Michael Defillipino"" or whatever he's pretending his name is can flag my review until the cows come home, I will just repost. This is America.

5009167,5,B006OEPRT0,"Through my work with [...] I have learned so much about Donner Pass before the movie was even near release. My excitement was definitely peaked and I was thrilled when I was contacted to host an advance screening of Donner Pass online. The movie will not dissapoint! For being shot in about 18 days, this film looks and sounds amazing! The cast all pull in great performances and you may even recognize a view of them from their appearances on well known television shows. The writing is incredible because Donner Pass is not an average horror film. It also contains history, mystery, and drama and it all comes across so perfectly on screen. And it has a stellar plot twist! The film will engage you from start to finish and leave you wanting more. So what exactly will you get if you purchase Donner Pass? - some blood and guts, tiny bit of nudity, some facts about history, your daily dose of soap opera, suspense and thrills, and a movie that you will want to put in your DVD player again and again. Everyone, cast and crew, involved with Donner Pass put a lot of effort into this film and it will not dissapoint!",1326412800,6,1117,4.480392156862745
5009168,1,B006OEPRT0,"I know horror is a very subjective genre. Some prefer slow burns, some gore, some suspense, some paranormal or monsters or slashers. But I'm honestly confused as to the positive reviews of this film. It felt like a freshman year film project. The acting is bland, characters are perfect stereotypes of every cabin-in-the-woods-type film you've ever seen, suspense is totally nonexistent, setting is without even a hint of atmosphere, plot holes larger than my fist. I cannot really figure out what people liked. Even for the b-grade mindless teen slasher genre, this is still painfully subpar. I assume the professor failed the student filmmaker. Unless this isn't a student film, in which case...yikes...",1398124800,,705,5.247787610619469
5009169,2,B006OEPRT0,"Donner Pass (Elise Robertson, 2012)

I've seen any number of reviews of Donner Pass that all seem to center around the same idea: good story hamstrung by bad acting. I'm not convinced this is the case on both counts; at least two of the actors here turned in performances that I quite liked (even if I found one of the characters portrayed an intolerable ass), while there were a number of aspects of the story I found infuriating. That said, the main mystery here is a pretty nice twist on the wild-mountain-man theme, and if you're looking just at that aspect of it and squinting right, okay, I can see where those reviewers are coming from. One way or the other, though, we're all ending up in the same place.

Plot: Thomas (Grey Sheep's Erik Stocklin) is the new kid at an exclusive private boarding school. In an attempt to make friends, he invites some of his classmates for a weekend of skiing at his parents' cabin in the infamous Donner PassMike (Madison County's Colley Bailey, who should refuse to take any more parts in movies with geographical names), Mike's girlfriend Kayley (Best Night Ever's Desiree Hall), and Kayley's friend Nicole (The Purge's Adelaide Kane), an ice queen who hates pretty much everyone except her boyfriend Derek, but who, Mike assures Thomas, is a good person to know if you want to be part of the inner circle at their school. All seems to be going well, at least where skiing is concernedas they get to the place, a blizzard is on its way inbut eventually, Nicole's boyfriend Derek (The Echo Game's Dominic DeVore) shows up with a couple of similarly drunk lunkheads in tow in the form of A. J. (TV character actor Brandon Morales), A. J.'s girlfriend Valerie (Zombies! Zombies! Zombies!' Krystal Davis), and Brody (This Tunnel South's Antontio Trischitta). Of course, rumors circle that Donner, the head of the party who were forced into cannibalism during a similar blizzard, is still alive and hunting. The group pass it off as an urban legend...until things start happening that lead them to believe that there may, in fact, be someone out there who's interesting in having them for dinner.

While eventually, a lot of the seemingly odd pieces of the movie are explained (for example, Thomas being a doormat far beyond the line where anyone else would have snapped), that doesn't excuse them stretching the boundaries of disbelief a great deal farther than the good portion of the plotline warrants. Topping that is that for the most part, the script, based on a story by first-timer R. Scott Adams, gives us a whole lot of characters so hateful you'll be rooting for them to die, one by one. The only sympathetic character, aside from Thomas (and you pity him more than sympathize with him), is Kayley (who is really kind of doing the same); Hall's performance works here. The other solid one is from Colley Bailey, despite that his character is exactly the kind of guy you want to expend your first punch on. Three characters, however, do not a movie make. I wanted to like this a great deal more than I did. * ",1393545600,,3058,4.699626865671642

5009171,4,B006OEPRT0,we had some time to kill so we watched it and found it very entertaining and rather well done compared to some horror flicks we have seen lately.  my only regret was a sarcastic comment I made at the beginning of the movie about one of the friends and it turns out I was correct in my assumption which was sort of a bummer since I guessed the whole movie...it wasn't hard to guess either but a little more mystery would have been nice.  anyhoo....it is a straight forward flick with not a lot of sex and not a lot of pointless banter.  the acting was ok for the most part...a few of the actors were pretty lame but they ended up dying so the movie improved.  I liked the way it was filmed....you could see what was going on the whole time.  often when movie are done the dark/night portions are difficult to see what is going on with the characters...no so in this movie...it was well lit and the viewer had no troubles telling what was going on.,1377993600,,946,4.233333333333333

5009174,5,B006OEPRT0,"I bought ""Donner Pass"" (2012) blindly, thinking it was a film about the Donner expedition that resorted to cannibalism to survive the winter of 1846-47 because a pass in NE California was blocked with snow. Well, it starts out that way, but the story soon shifts to the misadventures of a modern-day group of youths who stay at a vacation cabin in the dead of winter where someone or something starts viciously mauling the kids one by one. Ah, this made it more interesting (I really wasn't in the mood to see a depressing tale of Winter survival through cannibalism anyway).

Gorgeous redhead Desiree Hall shines as the female protagonist and there's at least one solid male protagonist as well. One guy -- who's family owns the cabin -- is an awkward misfit; and the good-lookin' brunette he's sort of set-up with disdains him (cutie Adelaide Kane). The social dynamics get real interesting when a second group of uninvited youths join the party and tensions start to flare. I've been in situations just like this and it rings true. Dominic DeVore stands out as one of the bad dudes.

Although I label ""Donner Pass"" a slasher adventure, it's just as much a monster flick, even if the ""monster"" turns out to be human, which I'm not saying. So, really, this is just a classic creature feature utilizing the true story of the infamous pass.

I'm giving it a fairly high rating because it's a good modern example of the slasher genre. Everything jells together for an effective horror romp in the California wilderness (shot at Big Bear Lake, San Bernardino National Forest and Monterey Park, California). Another plus is the awesome song played during the opening & end credits -- ""High Ground"" by Orenda Fink.

The film doesn't overstay its welcome at 90 minutes.

GRADE: B+ or A-",1374883200,,1780,4.766233766233766
5009175,3,B006OEPRT0,"Donner Pass is basically yet another slasher/horror film involving teens having to find a way to escape the dangerous predicament of a killer being on the loose (this time out in the snowy mountains of a log cabin where the killer is roaming around).  Nothing really noteworthy or original occurs that you haven't already seen a thousand times in other horror films.  It's pretty average.  The acting is probably the biggest offender however.

Apparently the storyline is basically comparable to a zombie or vampire movie in that a strong, uncontrollable craving for blood results in a desperate need to kill people so the killers have fresh blood to feast upon.  The explanation for these events is really drawn out and lacks suspense, to be honest (due to being nothing I haven't already seen before being the main reason).  The unimpressive acting by the killer combined with the fact he's speaking incredibly soft during the final 15 minutes made it almost impossible to understand what he was saying.  Even worse, you don't really care about any of the teenagers because basically none of them like each other anyway, so why should *we* like them?

The murder segment where the one teenage boy urgently has to use the bathroom so he jumps out of the hot tub and leaves his girlfriend behind is probably the worst one.  He walks away only about 30 feet with his back turned while taking a leak, all the while his girlfriend is silently being killed in the hot tub, lol.  He's shocked when he walks up the hill and returns.  I don't know about anyone else, but if I were his friends, I'd have assumed *he* was the one who killed his girlfriend.  The one with a man having an axe slammed into his neck while stuck in the side of the shed isn't bad, though.  The eye-bulging facial expression of his is hilarious!

So yeah, this is basically another predictably made horror film.  I think Donner Pass would have benefited by keeping the characters of the first 5 minutes intact- a bunch of wild mountain men, instead of the usual predictable cast of clueless, party-happy teenagers.  You see the mountain men illustrate the legend from over 100 years ago, and the plot should have kept the mountain men without switching to the present time and the teenagers.

The acting is really atrocious, which is probably the worst aspect of Donner Pass.  The mediocre killings, the plot being a culprit of the same old/same old, and the really lousy acting really makes this film less than necessary to watch, however when you combine everything together it's still passable and above average due to managing to keep the suspense alive for the most part, hence my 3-star rating.  No higher than a 3, though.  Nooooo way.",1372636800,,2711,4.7398720682302775
5009176,3,B006OEPRT0,"History is about to revisit itself on an unfortunate group of teens who make the mistake of partying out in Donner Pass, where the legend of George Donner is not only alive, but hungry! After a gory opening, DONNER PASS introduces us to a an obnoxious group of utterly predictable teen stereotypes, and it is downhill from there. Having learned nothing from SCREAM, these mindless characters break every rule in the Horror handbook and beg for some unstoppable force of nature to put them out of their own misery. Help arrives in the form of history's most notorious cannibal, and once the deaths begin, they are fast, furious, and full of blood. At least the film makers had the sense to play this as a simple, honest Slasher with no pretentious hangups, because neither the film nor the characters contain any depth to them whatsoever. The expected ""twist ending"" is broadcast from the very first moments that we spend with the teens thanks to a few obvious clues. To its credit, however, the young cast members take on their roles respectfully, and the film is both cleanly shot and nicely edited. The Slasher crowd might find some bloody entertainment here, but otherwise it is safest to heed the film's warning and PASS.

The gore is about an 8 out of 10 and it's done well..

I read some of the reviews and they gave much too much away.
It has some interesting characters and some really annoying ones but it brings out the basic slasher movie roster of teens and 20 somethings..

5009183,1,B006OEPRT0,"Positive:
For once a movie prop crew actually costumed the actors appropriate to the period. I actually thought, briefly, the movie might have potential.

Negatives:
(1.) The usual horror movie formula of 20-somethings aged coeds off on a ski journey to a remote cabin. How creative!
(2.) Another in a long, long list of similar movies where the cell-phone is out of range. There are actually web sites devoted to that one movie hook. A list that approachs a hundred.
(3.) Usual victims casted as not too desirable that will be our victims. Usual dispatching tools in the woodshed, basement, etc.
(4.) Usual car isn't drivable. So victims have to hang around. Ha ha.
(5.) For some not well explained reason there's a vampire connection only in this case you just have to swallow the infected blood. Never explained how it started except that Donner - oh yeah, remember it's the title to the movie, was infected and spit it onto the one survivor of the Donner Pass breakfast club. Well, he somehow lives forever as long as he sips a little human blood. Why don't they just invest in a blood bank. Whole lot easier.
(6.) Ends as usual with a lone survivor and bad person is unaccountable for - did I hear sequel?",1327622400,3,1210,4.627906976744186

While not as gonzo as his films can be, I would liken it to a Rob Zombie film where you can sense the excitement and love for the genre in tiny details. The film has a little bit of everything, and although I wouldn't usually consider that a good thing, here it's done so well that it comes together nicely.  It starts with a historical perspective of the setting's notorious past. It then jumps to present day and slowly, smartly builds tension subtly revealing more and more things that just aren't right.  It then busts wide open delivering a lot of gruesome gore and also delivers a nod to the rape/revenge sub-genre.

The movie does have a fair amount of gore in a few of the scenes, although thankfully that wasn't what was happening in the majority of the movie since they kept it mostly to the scenes where it was necessary to tell their story.

8501868,4,B006OEPRT0,"Though undeniably cut from the slasher mould, Donner Pass rises above most other films of its type thanks to a serious approach and a fine cast. Based upon the legend of the Donner Party, the film gives us a new explanation for what really happened to those stranded people and how the same fate still stalks others who wander into Donner Pass. Script and direction are extremely well executed, and the relative lack of camp combines with the cold, dark, and isolated environment in which the plot develops to create an atmosphere of genuine suspense. The actors do a fine job all round, especially Desiree Hall as our main character and ultimate Final Girl. Ms. Hall's character is likable without being too good to be true, and so emerges as a real flesh-and-blood character we want to see triumph, even when it appears all hope for her has vanished. The rest of the cast does an admirable job as well, and the script fosters a sense of disaster by creating a group of people who are all consumed by various competing agendas and who are often not very likable. This adds an interesting group dynamic and an extra layer of danger--not only are the characters threatened by the mysterious killer, but by themselves as well. Special effects are very minimal, confined to a few bloody kills, but since the story relies more upon mystery and suspense than gore to generate its scares, the relative lack of visceral visual FX is hardly anything to complain about. Donner Pass may be a low-budget slasher movie, but it also proves that even within those confines it is possible to make a quality production.
