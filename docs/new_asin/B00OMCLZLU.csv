6756433,1,B00OMCLZLU,"I got through one criminal story in the first episode and decided this series was terrible. Can't believe it made it past the first season, let alone the pilot.",1423872000,,160,4.551724137931035
6756434,4,B00OMCLZLU,"Anyone labeling this ""poor quality"" and ""dumb"" ought to look at the date that it was created. It was created back in the 1990's. For heavens sake, it won't have the same HD quality that newer shows do.  I give it 4 stars because for when it was made -- it is good and the quality is fine.",1423267200,6,288,3.9655172413793105
6756435,1,B00OMCLZLU,OMG. I almost blindly bought season one thinking it would be like world's dumbest on Tru tv. It is not like that show at all. It's reinactments showing what happened. I'm really glad I only bout one episode instead of buying the entire season. My suggestion is to just buy one episode before you buy the whole season.,1423008000,5,317,4.482758620689655
6756436,1,B00OMCLZLU,"It's unbelievable to me that this was a 4-season series on TV.

Segments were usually either police officers telling the story in an interview (the stories came across like corny dumb criminal one-liner standup jokes)...
Or they were choreographed in re-enactments that were so badly acted that even when they weren't labeled 'actual re-enactments' it was obvious that it wasn't actual footage. On top of that, because it was so poorly re-enacted, it felt like bait and switch because the majority were not labeled as such.

Editing was also poor in that there were on-film notes against a black screen about when to cut to commercial breaks, when to show teaser clips of upcoming episodes, or when to show sponsored ads. This show may actually have been more interesting if they'd had real commercials, teasers and sponsored ads.

Lastly, the most interesting parts were a couple short segments of actual security camera footage + voice narration. If there'd been more of these, it would be worth a watch.

I wasted 25 minutes watching the first episode and another 8 minutes writing this review. I want those 33 minutes of my life back. Please don't let my sacrifice be in vain. Stay away from this show!",1422144000,38,1206,4.868292682926829

6756448,3,B00OMCLZLU,OK it's not great but it's not horrible either. I mean it's about stupid criminals not rocket science so I don't know what people expect but I think a lot of people giving it poor reviews have way too high expectations. I mean it's not high brow entertainment but if you want to watch something that'll just give you a few cheap laughs and not have to think too much and make you shake your head about human stupidity this is all right.,1513900800,,436,4.265060240963855
6756449,1,B00OMCLZLU,Half these guys are just a matter of unfortunate circumstsnce. This isn't a show abut criminals. Just lame cops looking for publicity. BAD. BAD. interesting but lame.... shoot the horse amazon.,1513296000,,193,5.258064516129032
6756450,4,B00OMCLZLU,"It's dumb, and it's fun!

This is not a show that takes itself seriously, the criminals do stupid things and the host presents them with just the right amount of cheese. This is a show that sometimes does ""genuine re-enactments"" of traffic accidents with Matchbox cars and in an interview with an officer from  Roswell, New Mexico they have a UFO fly past.

Take this show in the spirit it's intended, have a laugh at the expense of some stupid criminals, and be glad you aren't one of them!",1512086400,,491,4.49438202247191

6756456,3,B00OMCLZLU,Guess they never told the dope dealer who tossed the pistol they couldn't decide whether it was a .40 or 10mm that they are essentially the same round. Sadly that also shows the stupidity of the cops who couldn't tell the difference between a 10mm a .40 and a 9mm which the pistol actually was......

6756474,1,B00OMCLZLU,this is not worth a review...,1475884800,,29,4.0
6756475,3,B00OMCLZLU,This show is very silly and majority of bad reviews are on target. I give this a 2.5 rating in all reality because it can be mildly amusing and a good way to pass the time at times. The re enactments are so extremely cheesy and the host can be pompous I'd say. The jokes are more often than not really bad. Some of the cops stories though are interesting and even funny at times. I certainly would never recommend spending money on this but if you have prime like I do and are in the right mood or really love cop stories it might be worth checking out. 2.5 stars from me flat out.,1474070400,2,581,4.060869565217391
6756476,1,B00OMCLZLU,Dont watch this expecting real situations of stupidity. These segments were reenacted for comedy purposes. I didn't get past the first episode.,1467590400,,143,5.545454545454546
6756477,1,B00OMCLZLU,"Terrible. Just terrible. This comes across as some early 90's college kids attempt at making a tv show. Reenactments were bad, camera quality was terrible so it was hard to determine if they were trying to convince us this was real footage or bad acting reenactments. After a couple moments I thought for a second this MAY be corny and stupid enough to be ridiculously funny (as some ppl have said) but alas, even I do not watch things this bad. There's terribly good stuff in this world, this doesn't qualify to me. Maybe if you're 13 looking for a show to cackle at and joke at the poor animation but as an adult it just reminds you of wasted technology and time and annoys you lol. There's also way too much dead time and stalling and back and forth between story telling and reenacting. I don't even trust the security camera footage provided tbh lol. Nor do I trust the douchey police officers they have telling the stories. It feels like one big over exaggerated tell-all. Lots of terrible background music and wayyyyy too long introduction songs between episodes. The intros were practically longer than the terrible episodes' air time. Ugh! I'm annoyed recalling all this just to type it lol. Do not watch this unless you're 13 years old at a sleepover looking to critique a corny show.",1467244800,,1294,4.630434782608695

6756488,2,B00OMCLZLU,"Basically you have Popo's story time here.  I watched the first two stories, and was mildly amused at them, but what did it in for me was the smug atmosphere of the show.  I'm not a criminal, I have no family that is a criminal, so it's not a bias speaking here.  It's just that these are the stories of people's lives, and obviously these people haven't had a fluffy existence in life to get where they ended up.  I realized it felt really classless to be mildly amused at the tragedy of someone else's life.

I gave it 2 stars only because I believe the intent was benign.",1452470400,,574,4.229357798165138
6756489,1,B00OMCLZLU,"Really awful. I love dumb criminals stories, but these are presented in the worst possible way I have ever seen. These people are presenting dumb criminals on video because they finally found someone dumber than themselves. I even feel like I lost a few IQ points in just watching one episode. I was hoping as each segment went by that somehow it would get better, and it did not get better but sometimes it did get worse. One Star is not low enough. I give this a NEGATIVE 5 STAR RATING!!!!!!!!",1452470400,,495,4.450549450549451

6756495,1,B00OMCLZLU,"I agree that the quality shouldn't be criticized, its merely an aspect of how old this show is, though that's probably the only reason we now have it on Prime... even as part of the Prime package this isn't worth watching - this is some seriously trivial stuff, I couldn't finish the first episode. Black & White video of a guy cooking crack with two undercover cops, well... first they blurred the faces, understandable but that accounted for 80% of the image, so you're left watching a blurry nothing, plus there's no sound - just that super annoying narrator who sounds like his last job was at the circus - then it ends. Yep, that's it. The ""apparent"" joke was that the guy didn't know he was being filmed... seriously? The police officers telling stories would be fun over a beer but not on a TV show.
