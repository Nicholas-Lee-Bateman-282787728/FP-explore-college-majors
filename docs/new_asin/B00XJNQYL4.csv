8716088,5,B00XJNQYL4,"This is a very powerful, honest film about Janis-without all the hype and ""legend"" surrounding her nowadays. It shows Janis as she really was (I almost said ""is"") a young woman with an outrageous amount of energy, strength, and intelligence, trying and at the end succeeding to get her message across about life, love and yearning- yearning to know it all, do it all and have it all. She almost DID have it all in my opinion, impressively at the tender age of 27 when she left the world to beyond. She wanted so much more out of life than she could find, as her hopeless drug and alcohol addiction proved. She was blessed with so much intelligence and awareness (very rare in musical artists, especially NOW) that she did not know how to deal with what was constantly running around in her head- especially when she was alone. Heroin shuts off bad feelings with a feeling that everything is fine until it wears off. The same may be said about alcohol but in both cases when you are ADDICTED it becomes Russian roulette (take it from personal experience, ME). I had a friend who intentionally took his life via the needle. I really don't think Janis intended to take her life THAT VERY NIGHT, but she knew and wanted a short life and knew it was a matter of time before she died. Thus the ""Good time Janis"" image she created. Her demons of never finding one lover forever or contentment constantly haunted and motivated her. I believe her performances on stage were the only thing that gave her contentment, where she could release all that pent up feeling with such beautiful, stunning talent. I learned a lot from her, and think the sad story can be turned into hope, joy and true love for each other and the choices we make in life. She made quite an accomplishment for a 27 year old gal.",1475193600,,1790,4.493865030674846
