8450942,5,B00508VT8Y,"Love this series especially with Johnny.  He encourages but isn't bugging you all the time.  They are a good pace, nice scenery and for me 35 minutes on my elliptical is all I can do at least for now.  Just wish he would do a Paris one.  I have several of this series and no dud yet.",1456012800,,283,3.912280701754386
8450943,5,B00508VT8Y,Very nice video. I enjoy it very much.,1409702400,,38,3.875
8450944,4,B00508VT8Y,"Beautiful scenery, but the pace was way to fast for me. I felt that I was constantly trying to catch up. I also did not like how the camera moved off trail or how it would come to a complete stop at the edge of a cliff to take in the view. Makes it hard to keep a rythym going.",1393200000,2,277,3.6333333333333333
8450945,4,B00508VT8Y,Great views that definitely helps with the monotony of running on the treadmill.  As with my other virtual run video I wish they didn't have to cut and fade in spots. I like them do much that I am looking to buy more virtual running videos.,1390953600,,240,4.217391304347826
8450946,5,B00508VT8Y,This is one of four Virtual Active dvds that I use when I get on the elliptical machine. Great for enjoying beautiful B.C. and getting your 30 minutes of activity in! Well photographed and can be used with or without narration.,1368835200,,227,4.560975609756097
8450947,5,B00508VT8Y,"I am new to the virtual outdoor exercise realm but I am totally hooked after using the two vids I purchased from Virtual Active: the Wild California Run and the American Northeast Run.  I am using an elliptical trainer and to keep it as realistic as possible, I set it for an intervals course.  This worked perfectly with these videos.  I started with the two that most appealed to me initially, but I have to say that I am going back for more -- several more.  Yes, each one is only 35 minutes long, but I can repeat the course as many times as needed or switch to another course (on a different run) to keep the workout going longer.  The scenes are amazing and the effect is very realistic, decent even on my 15"" laptop screen, and I am really looking forward to trying these out in front of a larger flat-screen set.  It's neat to see others on the trail getting out of my way as I jog through the various scenes.  I found myself instinctively grasping the handrails on my trainer more than once as the footage ascended a rocky incline or traversed a questionably-safe bridge, inducing a momentary illusion of unsteadiness.  The camera, however, is remarkably steady despite the coverage of some pretty rugged terrain.  I found that the pumping beat of the music was so-so with regard to matching the pace of the movement, but one can always substitute one's own soundtrack or switch to the DVD's natural sounds instead.  I definitely recommend Virtual Active training videos and plan to stock my own shelves with almost all of them.",1340496000,3,1537,4.576642335766423
8450948,2,B00508VT8Y,"I bought this video so I would have something to look at while using my treadmill. The problem is that video goes too fast. I wanted something that moved slowly and captured nature. I wanted to hear birds and pretend I was out hiking/ jogging. However, the video jumps around to different sites and goes way too fast. It makes me dizzy. I would have preferred a video that focused on a simple hike in one place, with all the sounds that would have come from being there, that was also slow-paced so that I would feel relaxed while exercising. This video did not do that for me.",1328313600,3,577,4.351851851851852
