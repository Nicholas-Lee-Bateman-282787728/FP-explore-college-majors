7877056,5,630477401X,"This is a very ""non-Hollywood"" movie. Story is about a young, seemingly autistic girl, and a slightly older woman who helps her. Has one of the most evil villains I have ever seen in the movies. Very Southern  story - reminds you of Faulkner. Virtually all the authorities come off  looking terrible. The social worker is especially bad. Extremely optimistc  film in the end, however. Shows the redemptive power of love in fighting  evil. Its a don't miss - but don't let young kids see it.",933033600,3,490,4.662790697674419
