8514283,5,B007C7FFRM,"I used this DVD as part of a 4 week presentation on Messiah at my church. I could not believe how many of the people loved the DVD. They want me to do it again next year and make it a tradition. I can join Ivars in his sigh when he turned to his choir - ""eternity"" is a long time. I surely will do it next year and on, as long as the church members ask for it. I am glad I came across this recording. My only wish would be to have the camera on Ivars for his entire directing - what a great Handel he makes.",1451260800,3,507,3.6605504587155964
8514284,5,B007C7FFRM,"I guess it is not possible to fully appreciate this remarkable DVD without experiencing the live performance itself. Sing along ""Messiah"" is a 28-old tradition in pre-Christmas Toronto, the same choir, orchestra and the same conductor dressed in a perfect baroque costume, Believ it or not, there are people who attended all the performances, year after year. I would say the Tafelmusik brings their very dedicated fans the experience that is totally unique.",1390176000,,458,5.287671232876712
8514285,4,B007C7FFRM,"We bought a Sing-Along Messiah for ourselves, and liked it so much we bought one for our grandchildren in Minnesota. They invited 15 friends over for a Sing-Along Messiah party - the next day a couple of their guests e-mailed them ""Hope this is the beginning of an annual tradition.""

This is really well done - orchestra, soloists, audience & conductor are obviously having a marvelous time. The conductor is excellent - and funny! We love the whole thing. Wish we could be in Toronto some year and participate ourselves!

I'd have given it five stars except that the sound and picture aren't quite in sync - I don't know if it is just our copy? After a few minutes it really didn't bother us.",1388361600,2,694,4.544
8514286,3,B007C7FFRM,"My VCR and TV are no longer talking so my VHS version of the Messiah Sing-In from San Francisco is lost. Looking for something to sing with while baking cookies I bought this. I was disappointed. Although there were some good choruses to sing along with, most not even half were on this DVD. I was disappointed as for years I've song almost every chorus in the Messiah. This DVD only whets your appetite to want more.",1387584000,5,417,4.428571428571429
