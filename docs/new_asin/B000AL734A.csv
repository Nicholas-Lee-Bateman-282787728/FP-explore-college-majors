8078704,5,B000AL734A,My 2.5 year old grandson really seemed to enjoy this old time favorite. It brought back memories for me.,1445990400,,104,4.526315789473684
8078705,5,B000AL734A,Thank You!!!,1412812800,,12,5.5
8078706,5,B000AL734A,My husband watched this show when he was growing up.  I bought it for christmas & it arrived in time to go under the tree.,1389571200,,122,3.88
8078707,5,B000AL734A,"This is safe viewing for even the youngest toddlers and preschoolers, and is an exceptionally well-written children's collection, packed with timeless moral themes. There are many wonderful ""takeaways"" to be gleaned from the adventures of Davey and his big, goofy dog, Goliath -- humor, love, learning, music, friendship, simple examples of God's hand in our everyday life, honor, philanthropy, integrity, stewardship, servitude, and even some real-life lessons in the School of Hard Knocks.

I am no expert, but I believe this is what was commonly referred to as Claymation. Despite having originated in the 1960s, these renderings are of decent quality and have been very well received by my children. We have the set of four DVDs and enjoy watching them over and over again. In total among the four DVDs, there are (22) 15-minute episodes, and (4) 30-minute specials.

Highly recommended; watch them together and be blessed!",1295308800,,927,5.256756756756757
8078708,5,B000AL734A,Love davey and goliath.  So will my grandson when he gets older. Great dvd.,1235606400,,75,4.357142857142857
8078709,5,B000AL734A,"I watched this as a child and when I saw it had been released on DVD's I got it right away for both of my God Children. I love the lessons it teaches about sharing, being kind to others, telling the truth. The animation is just as interesting as it was in the 1960's. It is produced by the Lutheran church but it doesn't preach any specific religion at all. Just what children today need. I highly recommend this whole set.",1216598400,,423,4.234567901234568
8078710,5,B000AL734A,My son enjoys Davey and thinks Goliath is soooo funny.  It's great to see another generation enjoying this wonderful television series.,1200700800,,135,5.428571428571429
8078711,5,B000AL734A,I'll be completely satisfied when I own all Davey + Goliath Volumes.,1180742400,,68,4.75
8078712,5,B000AL734A,"Same as with the first 3 volumes, all of which I have, I loved them then and still do now. I would watch them on Sunday morning and go to church afterwards. I can't wait to have them all on DVD and relive every good memory from that time.
UPDATE: I will be buying the Holiday Specials, too. The shows do go rather quickly and are timeless without ever being boring. I am sure the books are good as well. But, the DVDS/VHS are just as good.",1172620800,,439,4.057471264367816
8078713,5,B000AL734A,"This item is set to release 11/18/2005.  But also scheduled to release in October/November, 2005 are Volumes 2, 3 and the Holiday Spectacular.  What isn't clear so far, is that the Holiday Spectacular IS Volumes 2, 3, and 4 in one package, according to the distributor's website: Starlight Home Entertainment.  So save your money and just buy the Holiday Spectacular 3-disk set.  You get 18 15-minute episodes, plus three 30-minute Holiday-themed episodes (Halloween, Christmas, New Years) for a total of 6 hours of viewing",1125532800,11,523,5.190476190476191
