2729844,5,B000MFPVOS,I wish that this TV show would never end and keep going. The stories that people have told are truly amazing. The survival tips are an extra bonus.,1384041600,7,147,4.285714285714286
2729845,4,B000MFPVOS,"these episodes are super suspenseful & intriguing the first time you see them, but they are completely un-rewatchable so consider that before purchasing a DVD set.",1376870400,,163,5.3076923076923075
2729846,5,B000MFPVOS,WOW IS ALL I CAN SAY !!!!,1374710400,,25,2.7142857142857144

2729848,5,B000MFPVOS,"My 6 and 7 year old sons just love the shows from this series. Yeah, i thought they might be a little too young to watch them. I was wrong. No nightmares. No fear in them. They just love to learn that they need to be prepared for anything and that they must be prudent and careful. Yes, they are children but these shows ingrain into their young minds the need to be careful.",1362355200,,375,4.081081081081081

2729850,5,B000MFPVOS,This is one of those shows where you just can't stop watching. I probably cringe 5 times at least during each episode. This show is very well done and covers just about every nightmare situation. I find this show to be better than most horror movies when it comes to inducing fear. What is more scary than being lost in a tiny boat at sea and waking up in the middle of the night to see a huge barge heading straight towards you? This show should be required viewing for people who love adventure. Sometimes it is just the smallest mistake that will make or break your fate.,1338681600,3,574,4.324074074074074
2729851,2,B000MFPVOS,"Contrary to the description above, this dvd does not feature any of the originally broadcast jungle survival segments presented by Mykel Hawke. For some reason, Discovery channel, in all their infinite wisdom, have decided it would be for the best if they remove these parts entirely, so they can only be watched in low resolution on youtube. Thanks guys!",1326585600,3,355,5.033898305084746

8168369,5,B000MFPVOS,I love these series of how people survive from very real trauma. My whole family loves them and we sit down for hours and am very fascinated. Thanks for the opportunity to order them I was very pleased to receive them and how it was received. I will use this seller again.,1408406400,3,272,4.25
8168370,5,B000MFPVOS,One of the best shows ever.  The story telling is great but what really sets this show apart is the realistic reenactments of the situations.  It really is top notch and very believable.  Highly recommended.,1403395200,3,207,4.857142857142857
8168371,4,B000MFPVOS,"The main reason I bought this was the episode named ""Jaws of Death"" which I thought was on the season compilation. Sadly, it was another show entirely, named with a similar title. I meant to write DISCOVERY and ask them if I could just have the video file as long as I had proof. The show (not listed on the DVD jacket at all) was a show tied to ""I Shouldn't be Alive"" but was not the initial show that I wanted- Oddly enough, it was something like ""Science of Survival:Jaws of Death"" None of the other episodes had this show format. The rest of the episodes on the season were all there and accounted for but not Ep. 6. Those ""Science of Survival"" shows were another title entirely so it seemed like it was the fault of the company that designed the DVD left it out on accident, wrote the seasons with a misnamed episode.",1402272000,,822,4.2756410256410255
8168372,5,B000MFPVOS,It was everything I expected!  Shipping was fast and the product was worth the price.  Recommend to the adventurer in your life.,1387843200,3,128,4.7727272727272725
