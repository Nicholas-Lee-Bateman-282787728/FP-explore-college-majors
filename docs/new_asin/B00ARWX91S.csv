8557195,5,B00ARWX91S,"The Play With Barney DVD was entertaining. It had some really great lessons, fun imaginative play, and encouraged being active. Its everything I have learned to expect from Barney. The songs, the dancing, the kids and the fun loving dinosaur, Barney, always do a great job capturing my boys attention.

My favorite song on this DVD is the Cleanup song. For some reason signing this song really motivates my son Samuel, whos five, to clean up. Wesley, whos one, is a little young to get the concept of cleaning up although he imitates what we do and it does actually seem like he is trying to clean up with us. Now I can learn all the words to the song! (Although I know I could have easily looked it up.)

Are there parts that get annoying for the adults? Well, yes if you think kid shows are annoying, but its not made for adults! It all for the kids! Speaking of kids, I appreciate that the cast is not just dinosaur characters, but kids too. We do not watch the show that regularly, but it seems like they do change the kid cast to keep it current, diverse and interesting. It makes it feel like anyone can go play with Barney if they just imagine.

Play With Barney is another great DVD. My kids loved it! I feel safe and comfortable when they watch it because I know what to expect. I can always rely on Barney!",1362441600,2,1316,4.319838056680162
