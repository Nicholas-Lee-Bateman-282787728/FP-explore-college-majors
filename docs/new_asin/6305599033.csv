1047421,4,6305599033,"Not too shabby, though it did drag a little in the beginning. The ending makes up for it though, left me thinking about it long after it was over.

1047422,4,6305599033,"Pretty much the purest horror film I've seen in a while.  There is no pretention here as to character development, or deeper meanings--just straight out tension from start to finish.  Of course, the usual drawbacks struck me in this as in most horror films:  if they only had a gun, for starters.  Problem solved. Secondly, once I had been threatened by a person, and I got them at my mercy, I would bash their brains out without a second thought (why, oh why do the protagonists ever have a qualm about destroying a murderous, sub-human creature that has terrorized them and would kill them in a heartbeat if they could?).

But all that aside, this movie was better than I expected.  The setting is a half-derelict old isolated country mansion, which won from me a couple of stars right there; and all in all, the victims exhibited somewhat less stupidity than one normally sees in such pictures, mainly because the pace of the film left them little room to think.  Relentless--that is a good word to describe this picture.  Once it gets going, there is really no time for thought, just action.  As long as you expect no great depth, and just want a film to keep you in definite tension for an hour or so, this will do you just fine.",1520553600,5,1234,4.5225225225225225

If you cleaned your toilets or washed your dog or folded laundry instead of watching this movie, you'd make much better use of your time.  If this terrified European audiences, that's ridiculous -- which European audience was that?  A bunch of tweens who've never seen a horror film in their life.

Stephen King points out that horror fans have to be patient, comparing us to gold miners endlessly swirling water and gravel in our pans, on the alert for that tiny sparkle and having to suffer a lot for that one glimpse at times, and he's right.  I gave this movie every chance I could.  I didn't find one tiny particle of gold.  Zero.

Why is it so bad?  It's absolutely predictable, with annoying characters, and uses all the cliches of horror films from decades past without generating one spark of fear, only annoyance that I watched it -- fast forwarding all the way -- and I'm even taking time from my sickbed to write this review, which I hate doing and which pisses me off even more, just to warn other viewers off.  Unless you're a tween who's never seen a horror movie in your life, go ahead, but really, kid, finish your homework instead.  Write that term paper.  You'll respect yourself more.

The final outrage:  the attempt at a scare  near the end (yes, I'm going to spoil it in some part, and you're welcome; at least you don't have to see it):  ""They didn't want to plaaaaay.""  Spooky!  Nnno.  Not in the slightest.

Then the fear factor of the unknown quickly fades to become frustration and boredom when the story reveals that the events are all perpetrated by children.  The level of anger and lack of realism completely deflates any hope this movie ever had of getting two stars.  For me, it's the sheer ignorance in the lack of realism or believability that makes all prior events fall flat - the size, shape, speed, strength, everything about the ""people"" that were creating the suspense couldn't have been achieved by children.  As a matter of fact, the camera angles and figures used weren't children - i.e. the figure moving in the background of the dark living room or the figure standing in the hallway outside of the bathroom.

I did this with THEM. It is a French movie with English subtitles. Fortunately the dialogue is not so complex that the subtitles are problem. In fact the dialogue is extremely simple. And there is very little of it.

For the first 40 minutes of the movie, during the buildup to the climactic second act, there was very little of anything other than slice of life activities of the male and female leads in the quiet of their home.

Somewhere around 40 to 45 minutes into the movie, the first signs of something going wrong occur. It seems that there may be some intruders on the property, and possibly in the house. For about the next 10 minutes we see the leads looking very helpless, and sporting expressions of dread. Again, this is a French movie, so of course they would not have firearms. Apparently they had no knives, bats, pepper spray, or other useful home defense weapons.

If you've read this far, then you probably don't mind spoilers. But I'm going to go ahead and give you a spoiler alert anyway. The ""THEM"" in this movie turned out to be some school-aged punks out to terrorize the couple live in the house. I found this out by fast forwarding the movie from the 50 minute mark to the end. It was just that boring.

I had hoped for much much more from this, and was expecting some kind of alien critters, but instead I get a bunch of teenage French hooligans.

As I said, the dialogue is inane and almost nonexistent. The acting is totally nonexistent, and raises questions as to why a grown man and woman would respond to different sites and sounds the way these two do. It's almost as if they are mildly retarded adults who think and act with the cognitive skills of perhaps an eight-year-old.

I have a keen eye for detail, especially when it comes to observing the design and layout of the French school and the French farmhouse in which the couple live. Having the visual access to the inside of those two structures was the only thing about this movie that I did like.

It has the typical grainy look of a non-American film, and appears to been shot with a handheld camera. All scenes were very shaky, enough so that it was uncomfortably noticeable. The audio was equally poor.

Unless you have an interest in the design and layout of older French buildings, this is probably going to be a very big waste of your time. I waited until it went on Prime, so it did not cost me anything except for about 50 minutes or so of my free time.

I hope this will help you to make a more informed choice, so that you don't waste your hard earned money, or time, with a movie that will not bring you a high level of satisfaction.",1502928000,2,2780,4.391050583657588

I understand that all movies require some suspension of belief, but some of the actions these people undertook during their harrowing ordeal were just mind boggling.

Just a couple of examples/tips should you ever find yourself under siege by murderers: Get a damn flashlight. If/when you receive an injury that affects your mobility, do not try and outrun your perfectly healthy pursuers. If you manage to get away and hide from them, don't have a loud ass argument about what you should do next, in fact, just keep your mouth shut. When you run out of options, fighting is better than screaming your head off at they take you down.

I won't spoil the surprise for you, but the reveal at the end just makes the above mistakes all the more infuriating.

From the onset the mood leading us into the 'true' telling of an incident is far more troubling than the typical viewer realizes.  I know.  In 1960 I grew terrified of being in the bathroom after watching Hitchcock's 'Psycho' at the tender age of 5.  Who'd have known a single black & white movie preliminarily desensitized an entire culture of Americans to the reality of the ever pervasive 'criminal mind' living among & within us?  This film's overly toned shadows set the mood for the nicely executed soundtrack and there were no issues with either editing nor sound which is rare nowadays.  Considering the countless movies I've seen in the genre of 'scary' very few have ever come close to any kind of adrenaline pumping anticipation that this move captures.  Both actors were exceptionally amiable and compelling.  IF you think you are a true connoisseur of the genre than you will enjoy this rare little gem.  The idea of 'intrusive invasion' lends a 'supernatural' quality that does exist wherever schemes of malice are entailed.  I appreciated the elusive chase leading bit by bit to reveal, like 'Psycho', a completely disturbing fact that 'a pack' of youngsters could be so terrifying.  The spectacular house and it's surroundings were so glorious I kept thinking; ""Two people living their dream away from and outside of our fast-paced, rat race world.""",1500681600,2,1526,4.968503937007874

First off, let's talk about characters.  The two main characters in the movie can be completely summed up as ""foreign school teacher and author"".  That's it, that is the entire depth of their characters.  There is no development, there is no emotional subtext, and there certainly aren't any actual characters in the movie.  This movie did nothing to pull me into the struggles of the protagonists.  I'd say they are about as shallow as a kiddie pool, but at least a kiddie pool has enough depth for me to drown myself.  If the movie put some actual effort into getting me invested in the characters, maybe I would have enjoyed this movie.  There are some genuinely neat ideas here that can actually create a lot of tension, but the movie is trash and so these ideas are wasted.  The most egregious offense, however, is that it isn't even fun.  I can overlook the bad parts of a movie as long as I am having fun.  I can say that I enjoyed watching a movie if my friends and I can riff on it and create our own entertainment.  Unfortunately, this movie isn't even that.

Psycho school kids ""playing"" (read: Killing) for kicks and giggles.
Using their knowledge of an ancient tunnel system, they terrorize and eventually
murder a young schoolteacher and her boyfriend by entering their spooky, old remote home (aren't ALL
 spooky old homes ""remote?"") through the tunnels-make scary noises-stab the boyfriend in the leg-chase the
girlfriend up, down and everywhere, until she too, ""gets it.""
The pacing was slow, slow, slow-and attempts to ""hype it up"" fell flat.
The entire film had an amateurish quality-starting with a ""film-making #101""attempt at 'foreshadowing-'
as said schoolteacher drives by a car 'accident' being investigated by police, et.
WE know what happened to the driver and her daughter-but no one else does......(SFX-'Twilight Zone Theme')
Finally-a particular ""quirk"" of mine.....editing mistakes.

she doesn't (a haunted grocery bag?)

1) a bunch of young teenage boys did it.

OMG, ok, for srs, listen alright?  Basic plot setup is boyfriend and girlfriend live in her large mansion in rural Romania.  One night, they go to bed.

SRSLY!  THAT'S the setup!  THAT'S what girly and loverboy do that makes the bad stuff start happening.  ANYway...

Girly doesn't really get all the way asleep before we hear noises and she begins to suspect someone/ones is/are lurking about the property.  She's right.  She wakes Loverboy up and they go investigate, and in the dark in the yard, we see her car being stolen.  Loverboy chases after it because he's a man and doesn't catch it because he's French.

Little while later Girly is on the phone with people we assume to be the authorities, but it's like the middle of the night and she says she's gonna hang up and call during the day because ""The Papers"" were in the car.  She says at one point that She can't believe she left them in there, that it was stupid of her, but I don't understand that because it WASN'T stupid of her to assume that her mansion in the Middle of Nowhere in rural Romania would be a safe place to park her car.  Who is going to fuck with it?  THIS is a problem.  This is a problem because for no reason we are ever given, the car is fucked with.

And don't you dare give me that look, that house WAS DEFINITELY in the middle of nowhere, otherwise Girly and Loverboy would have run somewhere for help!  The director NEEDED the mansion to be both in the middle of nowhere AND near public drainage and running buses, that was the twine and old chewed bubblegum that kept this plot TOGETHER.

ON WITH OUR TALE...

After hanging up with the authorities or whoever, Girly and Loverboy hear noises and figure out that they are not alone in their house, and eventually the chase begins, through the house, up to the creepy attic, through a room that I am going to call the Many Hanging Plastic Sheets Room, out of the house, through the woods and aforementioned public drainage, by this point we know it's boys doing it, there's some soft core dungeonesque torture, then Loverboy dies and Girly runs on through the sewers, ending trapped at a dead end grate that leads to the outside, but only if you exist in either a liquid or gaseous state.

Magic letters at the end of the movie tell us that the bodies are found later, and that when the boys who did it were found and caught, their explanation was that """"THEY"" (like the title of the movie) wouldn't play with us.""

Now.  This is the ""Audience Participation"" part of my review.  (you're the audience part)

Ask yourself.  How scary was all that crap I just wrote up there?  WAS it scary?  Or was it a bunch of nonsense mashed together with no clear motivation behind any of it?  Cus WHY?  Don't ask me ""why what?"", why EVERYTHING!

There is absolutely no gore in this film, which I'm sure some parents out there will appreciate, and tries to be very Hitchcockian in its suspense building that seems rather forced rather than artistic or haunting.  At no point was I or anyone I have shown this film ever scared or on edge.  It is one of the films where you scream at the sceen because of how ridiculous they are behaving in the situation.  So much so that it elevates fear, because you are thinking, if I were them, this would be a piece of cake if I just did literally anything other than what they are doing.

Those reviews may turn some away from this film when it's outright incorrect and very odd. But in order to help here I have to include some minor spoilers. So if you plan on watching this anyway despite the few and far between bad reviews then there is no need to read any further. If you might not be planing to watch this film possibly because of some of the negative reviews and don't mind seeing some basic spoilers then read on. THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERS: Several members didn't like this film because they didn't buy the idea that the people who were targeted by these unseen attackers wouldn't have tried to defend themselves and arm themselves with some sort of weapon. I don't know what film these individuals were refering to because not only did one of the people under attack arm himself but he killed two attackers and used two different weapons to accomplish it. Several other members claim you never really see the attackers. Also not true. They are indeed seen several times, even their facial features. Someone else questioned why they didn't use their cellphone to call the police because they did in the begining of the film. The people who had the cellphone were not the same people under attack later in the film. And they seemed to be blocked by a horde of attackers who prevented them from getting to the kitchen to grab a butcher knife or some other more common weapon. Power was cut, so they couldn't call the police, though they tried. So that sets the record straight. Ok so now that maybe I have convinced you to give this film a chance, the reviews that called this movie a solid, scary nail biting film were all correct.

I've been wanting to see ""Ils"" (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Them/dp/B0037K5U1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Them</a>"") for six years now. I knew the genre of ""Peaceful Couple Gets Hassled by Scary Mean Kids"" is best done by the French, so I took a giant leap of faith and downloaded (""rented"") Ils via Amazon's Unbox/Video on Demand/Amazon Instant Video and my netbook didn't explode.

Renting via Amazon's myriad of Downloadable Content (DLC) options (pick one), I was under pressure to view the program within a certain period of time. I made it with two minutes to spare.

Another reason I was anxious to see Ils was because, oui, it was in French with NO English dubs but with ""burnt in"" English subtitles. Amazon has been notoriously negligent to offer optional subtitles with a majority of their English-speaking downloadables or streams.

Sorry about that. Back to the movie. Spoilers, perhaps. The first unfortunate serious wound to the male (""Lucas"") of our stalwart couple seemed more like an accident which branded him to hobble forth throughout the rest of the movie. The second incident which involved our heroine ""Clem"" also seemed like an accident - and I cheered. You will, too.

Throughout the rest of the film, Clem showed enormous amounts of resolve, courage, and she *knew* that big-a** house, including the seemingly endless underground corridors and dripping cesspits.

Make no mistake about it. Ils is perfection in this ""homey-life-turns-to-merde"" ouevre. There are more unspoken frightening grunts and noises than dialogue, which are interspersed just right with short music cues (NOTE: During the end credits, there is a beautiful piano quintet piece that deserves to be heard).

Both Michael Cohen and Olivia Bonamy were sympathetic characters (I didn't like what was happening to them. Oftimes I want the ""victims"" to be at least inconvenienced). They drew me into their realm of terror. I was on edge.

Atmospheric visually and aurally, Ils defines this genre of home invasion better than any other film of its type.

""Ils"" is not ""Frontieres"". Nor is it ""Martyrs"", ""High Tension"", ""The Last House on the Left"", or ""Straw Dogs"".

It's not as extreme as the films I just mentioned, but simply the very best of its type. Viva La France.",1348617600,3,2328,5.284552845528455
1048747,1,6305599033,"Yes, now I know why this turkey was going for peanuts in the bargain section of my local FYE.  But since the slipcase was plastered with so many blurbs from rave reviews I felt that perhaps whomever sold their copy to the store might not have known what they were ridding themselves of.

Lo and behold, this movie isn't just bad, it is insultingly bad.  Next time I smell rotten eggs wafting from some diseased kitchen or sidestep a steaming pile of doggie-do in the street, I will think of this movie. It isn't ""chilling,"" and it has no ""nerve jangling shocks"" or ""incredible tension"" as the blurbs proclaim. To say that ""This film nears perfection in almost every aspect"" is ludicrous.  One thing essential for a one-note story of this type is for the audience to believe in the protagonists.  But Clem and Lucas are two of the most unbelievable people I have seen in a movie in ages.  They just don't convey anything....except that they are acting-by-the-numbers in an attempted shocker of a horror film.  But apart from the lousy acting and the M. Night Shamalynesque shock tactics, the movie is (quite literally as it turns out)simply the cinematic equivalent of one's going through a Halloween haunted house and corn maze and being chased and shocked by a bunch of teenagers in hoods and masks and with neutered chainsaws and rubber hatchets, all paid to give us that much needed catharsis in this insane, horrific, warped day and age.  Except that a movie should be more than a trip through a Halloween haunted house and corn maze.

In all honesty, there were several moments in the movie that I had to fast forward through - it dragged that much!  But even zipping along it was still way too long.  THEM was part of my Halloween line-up, sad to say.  Two days ago I watched a movie shot in 1963 called THE SADIST.  It is broadly similar to THEM in its basic theme and situation.  But THE SADIST is everything this film is not: it is ""nothing short of chilling"", has ""incredible tension"" and ""nerve jangling shocks"" and ""the film nears perfection in almost every aspect.""  Wait a minute!  That's what THEM was supposed to be!  Well, it ain't.  THE SADIST is.

I was so disgusted with THEM that I thought about reselling it to FYE for the ""used"" bin.  But I didn't want to have some other poor soul buy it - nor could I think of one friend or enemy to whom I could just give the film and thereby inflict it on them.  No.  So...I just tossed this into the trash. Where it rightly belonged.",1347408000,7,2494,4.507795100222717
1048748,3,6305599033,"I first heard about this film as being the basis for The Strangers so, having liked that film, I decided to give this one a shot. It started out promising enough but somewhere near the middle it ran out of gas and simply bogged itself down with situations that it's American counterpart did better.

  The story is simple.  A husband and wife spending the weekend in a huge estate out in the country are being menaced by what appears to be some malevolent presence in the surrounding woods.  Too bad no one warned them of the murders of a woman and her teenage daughter the night before on the road coming up to the house.

  The setting was creepy enough, the killers were frightening (especially when you finally see them for what they really are).  The problem lies in the victims. They just weren't very likable.  The wife was a teacher who pretty much hated her students and her husband was a coward.  And these are the people we're suppose to root for?  At least with Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman, despite their faults, were sympathetic people.  With these two, I was ready to kill them myself.",1343001600,9,1100,4.522842639593908

We get just the right number of scenes to establish the humanity and vulnerability of the young couple here, before their harrowing night begins and they are forced to fight and run. The plot is familiar. The big surprise is the reminder that so much edge-of-your-seat suspense can be created with elements as simple as flashlights -- and sympathetic characters, brilliant cinematography and artful direction. What ultimately gives this film its edge is its connection to our deepest fears, rather than any traditional horror movie moralizing. While comparable in some ways to Blair Witch, I liked Them better. If you're looking for subtle, memorable storytelling, here's a winner.",1342656000,,855,5.248175182481752

1048751,4,6305599033,"If you've ever been spooked by the feeling of being alone at night inside a shadowy, silent house, ""Them (Ils)"" will remind you of that primal fear. The story finds a young French couple in their large, somewhat dilapidated estate in Romania suddenly woken in the night by noises, and lights flashing through their windows, followed by a cut in their electricity. Pretty standard stuff, but the cinematography and editing of this story is top-notch. The suspense during the first hour is excruciating.

What lets the film down is it simply gives too much power to the villains. As with the ""Friday The 13th"" movies, where killer Jason Voorhees becomes an almost  omnicient, omnipotent, godlike entity with each successive sequel, the dark forces here (I'm not telling!) simply know too much about how to scare, pursue, and harm. And when the identity of these ""dark forces"" is revealed, the audience might feel a little cheated; their brilliance in doing what they do just doesn't seem possible.

Still, that tension and dread in the first hour makes it well worth seeing for scare fans. If you liked ""The Strangers,"" give this one a look.",1339372800,,1139,4.891191709844559

This is the idea that is explored by ""Them,"" a movie that introduces us to a young couple who live in a secluded home in the woods.  Much of the early part of the story focuses on the uneventful details of their lives: driving home from work, eating a meal, watching TV, and preparing for bed.  But this couple is about to experience what is anything but an uneventful night.  Once begun, the terror (and tension) never lets up!

1048819,5,6305599033,"A French production, co-written and co-directed by David Moreau and Xavier Palud, Them (2006) is an extremely effective tale of suspense, where a young couple in their home, face terror from an unknown source.  Having to read subtitles, should not keep you from seeing this fine film, where much is communicated without the benefit of dialog.

The opening sequence nicely establishes an atmosphere of danger and suspense, as a mother and daughter meet a mysterious fate alongside a road late at night.  Living in the same area, at an isolated country residence, are Clementine (Olivia Bonamy) a teacher, and Lucas (Michael Cohen), a writer who works at home.  After turning in for the night, the couple awake and discover someone in the process of stealing their car.  They call the police to report it stolen, but after getting no immediate action, they head upstairs and return to bed.

Upon hearing noises downstairs, Lucas investigates, and is wounded in the leg.  Upstairs, Clem barely manages to avoid losing an eye, as someone attempts to break into the bedroom.  Lucas returns, and the couple barricades themselves inside, as someone tries to break-in the door.  Retreating to the bathroom, Clem climbs up into the attic and is chased and attacked, but manages to strike back and defend herself.  While the intruders are momentarily disorganized, the couple flees into the woods.  Pursued by several figures Lucas and Clem separate, and try to make their way to safety.

Filmmakers Palud and Moreau decided to make home invasion the theme of their film, and came up with a winner.  The story is supposedly based to some extent on actual events, but there are very few specifics revealed.  Keeping the threat nebulous and veiled, helps to maintain the suspense and intensify the terror.  So much remains a mystery, even to the very end.  Who is involved, how many, and what their motivation is, are all questions that not clearly answered.  The uncertainty adds to the unsettled feeling the movie leaves you with, as the viewer is left to provide their own answers to many questions.

Despite the unknowns, the central story holds together pretty well.  The actions and behavior of the couple in dealing with the threat, go a long way in selling the credibility of the story.  Towards the end, reality does start to get stretched a bit too far, with Lucas going from being barely able to crawl, to becoming mobile enough to track down a car, and engage in some major climbing.

Olivia Bonamy and Michael Cohen both give very believable and moving performances that easily transcend any language barrier.  Bonamy in particular, has the ability to make you feel what her character is feeling.  Extraneous dialog is kept to a minimum, as the characters seem behave, and react to situations in a natural way.  The affect the realistic nature of the film had on the two actors' demeanor, is candidly discussed in one of the bonus features.

While not a perfect film, Them pretty much achieves all that it was intended to do.  It is a fast-paced, tightly wound suspense thriller, that leaves the viewer in a bit numb with shock at the end.  The abrupt conclusion, results in a feeling of unease that stays with you for some time.",1312070400,,3230,4.8574040219378425

This French film had received quite a bit of attention & buzz as a real suspenseful and effective low budget ""nail biter"" of a horror movie. I'm just now getting around to checking it out. I personally found it quite competently shot,edited and well acted, and NOT at all suspenseful or terrifying. Perhaps i'm just jaded and/or desensitized from years & years of watching this crap,but during the entire running time I just felt like i've ""seen it all before"" (albeit this time subtitled).

It's not at all bad, it just isn't exactly very good or original either. The ""twist"" ending seemed rather implausable to me, but is apparently based,somewhat, on real actual events. As potentially thought provoking as the ending might be for some, it still doesnt help the rather pedestrian ""home invasion"" retread that precedes it. My advice would be to rent it first and judge for yourself before adding to your collection.",1307750400,4,1070,4.747311827956989
1048821,1,6305599033,"A FOREWARNING. THERE ARE GOING TO BE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW:

For being what looks like a low budget horror film, it is well acted by the protagonists; you don't really ever see the antagonists. And for the most part it is well filmed. To be honest, at the beginning of the film there are some genuinely good moments of terror. Yet, the more I watched the more irritated I became. I realize that with watching any movie there is always a suspension of belief, especially when it comes to those in the horror genre. But, I slowly began to be more and more frustrated with the couple being terrorized.

Firstly, you get your typical introduction to the lead characters. The lead female is a french teacher in Poland and is irritated with how her students act. Her husband, the lead male role, is a writer; the couple appears to have a great and loving relationship. This is about as much as we learn about them before they start getting terrorized. Not really much to go on or even try to build some sympathy towards. One glaring thing was the house that this, what would appear to be a low income family, are living in. The house is mansion sized and the apparent attic alone is the size of my house. But, that is neither here nor there, this just gives them more room to run around screaming there heads off. Let me preface this by saying that, if I lived in the middle of nowhere and someone was playing with the power to my house by flicking it on and off, it would definitely be a frightening experience. ""Them"" steal the couples car, cut the phone line, and can what seems to be, access the houses power from outside to turn it off and on. There is obviously more than one person conducting this home intrusion, hence the name ""Them"", and not knowing who or what you are up against can add to the harrowing experience.

During the course of the evening, the husband catches a glass shard in his upper thigh and is now impeded by this injury, making escape much more difficult for the two of them. At this moment in the movie I really started to become irritated  with the husbands character. The couple escape the house, all while the husband is limping and bleeding, and boy in true horror fashion he milks the crap out of this wound. The couple reach a fence, which appears to be quite the impasse. The fence couldn't be more than 8 feet high, and the husband refuses to climb over it. Stating that she should continue on without him and go get help, while he hides. I get you have an injury, but if really are afraid for your life you are not going to let a wound that didn't pierce anything vital impede your progress. Especially, not a fence that is only about two feet above your head, hell any somewhat fit man can use pure upper body strength to get themselves over. Yes, it's trivial, I know but in instances like these it just make me wonder.

To further add to the frustration, his wife in mid escape instead of trying to run away stops and hides when she clearly could have just kept on trucking and got help. Needless to say she gets captured by ""Them"". The husband then hears his wife's screaming and runs off to aid her, no longer impeded by his before crippling wound. He comes across one of his aggressors and kills them with a tree branch, low and behold he finds out that it's just a child no more than 12 years old. As the viewer, I had surmised this reveal a lot earlier, but now knowing that the people pursuing you are no more than children this should give you the edge. Sure, there might be 4 of ""Them"", but you are a full grown large adult male. In my short experience in life, I know for one simple fact that I could take on 4 children with no problem, I do it on a weekly basis with my family. The husband, eventually in pursuit of his wife, gets taken down by a 10 year old while climbing a ladder. The child stomps on his hands until he is forced to let go, he falls about 10 feet and then is dragged off by the other kids. That was just about the last straw for me. There is no way a 10 year old, under any circumstance, is going to force a man off a ladder. Grab the kids leg and wish him happy trails as he plummets to his death. Needless to say, the wife backs herself into a corner arms reach from salvation and gets herself dragged off into oblivion.

There are definitely a few more instances which raised my ire, but I just wanted to glance over the ones that really got at me. I don't like giving things away, hence the warning at the top, I just hope that this review prevents people from making the same mistake I did. I believed every review on here, friends also recommended it, I was surrounded by people telling me this is one of THE BEST HORROR MOVIES EVER. I wish someone had honestly told me how bad this really was, but then again I probably would have watched it anyways. Sometimes you just have to find things out for yourself.

Not slasher/bloody scary, but the type of movie that creates an atmosphere of fear, then takes you a step further, then a step past that to the point that you get chills down your spine.

The last tape I watch is the one I think will be the scariest and the first tape I watch I think will be the least scary....you get it.  Well, out of five tapes, I had this one at number four.  Let me just say, I should have watched this one first.  I expected so much from this DVD. This was supposedly ""near perfection"" and ""terrified Europe"".  Where was the perfection? What was so terrifying?  I don't get it.  A couple is terrorized by unseen (until the end) persons. The whole tape is them running all over the dark house with a flashlight.  You couldn't see what the heck was going on.  It was a bit irritating! I was so disappointed, but glad I didn't buy it! At one point, it was so boring, I started doing housework.

THEM suffers from the same improbable actions of the victims that destroyed THE STRANGERS--which is yet another movie about two people trapped in a house by unseen force.

The husband goes to investigate in the pitch dark--without a flashlight or any kind of weapon. Although they have a cell phone, they only use it once--and then it's forgotten for the rest of the movie.

This is what drove me crazy--throughout the entire movie, neither the man nor the woman ever arm themselves with even a butter knife or a nail file--until the very end when the man does finally grab a crowbar for defense.

One would think that living out in the middle of the woods with no neighbors that you'd at least have a hunting rifle, a bow and arrow or a BB gun.

Another foreign film that actually deserves 1 star but is some how praised by morons makes it to 4 star average ratings is beyond me. This film is a waste of time and I've seen better action on those made for T.V. horror movie shows they show on the Chiller Channel.

 Where was the film? Where was the story? What did I just want 60minutes of my life on?

 ""Them"" is only a 1/4 of a full length movie with all the important pieces cut out. Watching this movie is like catching the second half of a real horror movie. The characters you never get to know. You just see that one works as a teacher whom hates kids and the other is a writer... but somehow together they make enough to live in a mansion. I thought it was a hotel at first because it was so huge and had so many rooms... but then I realized it was a house. I spent a majority of the movie wondering how much do these people make to own a mansion. Then before I realized the movie was already over.

Yes this film is short and since it's so short there's not much to talk about. If you want to know what ""Them"" is... it's just a typical ""hide and seek"" the victims hid while the killer seeks them scene stretched out over 40 minutes. The first 20 is them talking about nothing. I dunno the woman comes home from work the guy talks about his laptop... they make dinner...watch tv..go to bed.. all takes like 20-30 minutes and then finally ""Them"" actually starts.

If anything this half assed excuse for a movie only pissed me off. How can something so uncreative and bland get so many raving reviews? There's nothing in the movie to rave about...It's not even long enough to remember. I honestly wish there was maybe just one thing in this movie that made it note worthy but everything in here I've seen before. This film is a clear Knockoff of an m.knight shyamalan movie... except he actually tries at least you can get a plot and 2 hours worth of film off him.

Nothing was more annoying than watching 2 people I could care less about run for their lives while making the most idiotic decisions. I mean I know Europe bans guns but atleast buy a sword.. a bat... kitchen table leg... or something to defend yourself with. The entire film I just kept thinking... are these people dead yet...and when will the credits roll. It's bad watching a movie knowing that the best seen is the one that happened 5 minutes into the movie. After that it's all down hill from there.

All I can say is that if you want to waste your money buy ""Them"" if your looking for an actual movie this isn't it. Not scary... not brilliant... not anything worth talking about. I'm sure I will forget this film... but I will always remember the money I wasted.

Tonight proved to be a little different when the old boy stumbled across a french film called ""Them"" on the sundance channel and got introduced to one of the scariest films yet to date. Now we have seen horror in all genres from the hilariously bad to the really horrific and have to say this one will stick with us. Right from the chilling opening scene we were gripped and had to watch further to see what this film had to offer. Honestly this was the wrong one to watch right before getting some shut eye.

Taking place in Romania a woman Clementine and her beau Lucas are planning to have a nice quiet evening in. They live in a very isolated mansion located deep in the woods with no neighbors within an ears reach. After having dinner they decided to get to bed to be bothered by a strange phone call. From there it all starts going down with her car being stolen, flashlights in the windows, the t.v being turned on downstairs as just the start to their horrific night. We don't want to spoil anything further because this one is a must watch for any fan of suspense.

Them honestly was one of the most intense films we've ever seen that didn't rely on anything more then atmosphere. If your some lunatic gore seeker then you're not going to enjoy this one because you won't get any cheap scares. This one plays very heavy on you mind and will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire way through. The ending is more disturbing then anything, especially when you discover who ""Them"" turns out to be. If you're in the mood for a true scare then pick up Them, lock you doors, hit the lights, and get down on the floor for a real treat.

The story proper begins the next day as we meet a young teacher and her boyfriend who live out in the countryside, near where the stalled car incident happened.  As night falls, they think they are alone -- but soon they are under seige by something, someone, or what, we don't know.

Of course, the key question in this kind of film is, ""Who will survive?""  Second is ""Who or what is doing these terrible things?""  The final answer is totally unexpected.  None of us in my household saw it coming!

But what this film has going for it most is the unrelenting sense of nemesis, doom, entrapment.  If you enjoy a good thriller, this is the perfect film.",1268006400,,873,4.354037267080745
1048898,4,6305599033,"Them / Ils is a brisk thriller/horror film, another European shot at the scary movie genre, heavily inspired by those gritty American horror movies of the 70s.

A young French couple live outside of Bucharest in an enormous, dilapidated house.  She's an elementary school teacher, he's a writer.  (Not sure if such homes are that cheap in Romania or what, or maybe they had an inheritance, or maybe the middle of nowhere locale means it's that cheap, but never mind.)  One evening, they make some dinner, they make some love...and then the terror begins.  They get a strange phone call...they wake up to strange noises...then their car stolen, and people are outside the house shining lights through the windows.  Then the people break into the house...who are they?  What do they want?

Most of the film then concerns the couple's attempts to outrun and escape and battle the intruders.  The house is enormous with various levels and wings that are either under construction or condemned, there's a large wooded forest nearby, there's some kind of massive, medieval sewer under the woods, I mean, this is a real boon for horror movie sets.  Once the terror begins, the movie does not let up and is pretty effective.  Both of the leads are good and believable, and the horror-movie-logic is pretty decent...in other words, they are not incredibly stupid, which is what most horror movies require the characters/victims to be.  Granted, I couldn't understand why they didn't use their mobile phones to ring up the cops (who are, an earlier scene shows us, unavailable anyway), but I guess the remote wooded location, and the land-line-being-downstairs-in-the-dark bit limited their communication...but still, I thought Europe, even on-the-edge Romania, would have better mobile service.

Again, the movie is quick (under 80 minutes), but it's pretty eerie, and there is almost a complete absence of gore, meaning the filmmakers had to use [gasp] suspense and action.  There is a bit of a twist, but nothing that will ruin the story for you...in fact, it's pretty creepy, and even more so if you know anything about Romania.  I have read an online review that rips the film for really being about modern French anxieties and the downside of being part of the European Union (fears of foreigners, Romania being a backward place, etc), but much of that may go over the viewers' head...unless you do have modern French anxieties.

When you watch a foreign film with subtitles (no dubbing, please), always remember that they just seem better than their American counterparts...because they're in a foreign language.  Remember that someone walking around the woods going, ""Mom, are you there?"" has been done many times before...but when done in Romanian, in the opening scene...well, you might think you have a recipe for a real gem.  Just temper your expectations.

It's a good movie, a very solid thriller with some scares, something rare in this day and age of Hostel killers and buzz saw obsessions.  The DVD has a good making-of featurette, another short concerning the composer (good minimalist work amidst the creepy sound effects), and another bit of behind-the-scenes for a particular sequence.  The DVD starts with a couple of trailers...including one for the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre(!)  Were they advertizing a new edition DVD?  Or just getting you in the mood?",1262908800,,3374,5.061482820976492
1048899,3,6305599033,"Let's see now ... the story is almost non-existent and soon telegraphs its intentions. There's a pretty minimalist approach used throughout, with just a handful of actors, one or two locations, and almost no music. It succeeds in being moderately suspenseful although it does take a while to achieve this. The revelation, although disturbing, is quite prosaic and left me feeling a little cheated given the ominous mystery of what had gone before. So, in summary, this is a simple, moderately effective chiller that doesn't leave much of a mark. Also, although it claims to be based on true events, Googleing the victims' names produced (at date of writing) nothing except information relating to this movie, which makes me wonder ...",1255305600,,734,5.074380165289257
1048900,4,6305599033,"Intro: A mother and daughter are driving along a road when the car breaks down. They are being terrorised by someone.
Main part: A French couple, Clementine and Lucas, is living in the suburbs of Bucharest, Romania. Clementine works as a teacher and Lucas is a writer. It starts as Clementine is finishing the school day and is returning home to Lucas. As they are getting ready to go to bed, they are disturbed by a dog barking. Lucas goes outside and gives it a treat. Was this an essential happening? No, but it explores the character and personality of one of the protagonists.
Later that night they hear movement in their house. The TV is on and they hear foot steps. Lights shine through their windows. When Lucas goes downstairs to check it out, he is attacked and his leg is wounded. Meanwhile Clementine is being harrassed by someone turning the door knob to her locked door. When Lucas returns to her, they flee and are being pursued by someone. Who are the people terrorising them and what do they want?

This is a wonderful and terrible film. Based on real events, it's dark, grisly and very scary. There is violence in this one, but it's not a gory movie as such. If you're looking for a splatter film, then ""Them"" is not for you. Them is atmospheric and realistic. The protagonists are 'real' people, not some super heroes ready to spring into action. They are terrified and they have every reason to be. It's easy to identify with Clementine and Lucas.
When we learn who is behind the terror, the senselessness of it all, the terror is all the worse for it, at least that was my reaction.

I've noticed some reviewers calling it unrealistic. This is based on a true story where an Austrian couple was killed by 3 teenagers in their vacation home in the Czech republic. Based on this and other real events around the world as well as knowledge on pack mentality, I'd say it's definitely not far out.
Why they chose to have this one set in Romania, however, beats me.

The DVD also contains some nice special features as well, including Clementine's sister doing a TV appeal for anyone knowing anything about the disappearance of her sister to come forward with the information. In addition to the making of Them, trailers and The awful truth (about Romanian street children).

I recommend this one for everyone who has the patience for a chilling and scary movie that is more quiet-mannered than your usual horror flick.",1250812800,,2434,4.627314814814815
1048901,3,6305599033,"Just for kicks, THEY make noises in the night; they surround, they torment, they threaten, they hurt.  ""Them"" tells the apparently true story of a seemingly banal evil that terrorized locals in a rural area outside of Bucharest, Romania.  Rather than gore and exploitation, the filmmakers make inventive use of their camera and lighting and shadows and sound to create a serious atmosphere of dread.  It works, and gave me the same chills I had watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>&nbsp;for the first time: a sense of something ominous and intelligent and evil, that was somehow real and existed in the same plane as the documentary-style footage, that could be either human or something more.  Yes, I was definitely creeped out.

I'd heard about this when it first played at festivals, and meant to see it ever since.  I like to keep up on foreign films, both arthouse and genre.  Still, I had the bad taste in my mouth after watching this one that comes when I see ""true crime"" specials about sadistic criminals on television.  Yes there is evil out there, and it is for the most part only a step away from ""normal.""  Still, in retrospect I wish I had the couple of hours I spent watching this back to spend on something that I could build on.  Or, rather, I wish I'd been able to walk away from this one with something valuable; not a ""moral"" since there's nothing more tedious than a film that tries to teach a lesson, but some new insight.  While the filmmakers tastefully avoid gratuitous violence or nudity, this is still not so far off from the nihilism of the so-called ""torture porn"" of films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw/dp/B0006SSOHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel</a>, which I've seen enough of (including those two) to decide it really is not my kind of thing.  Tied to that is that the main characters in the film are developed only slightly, not enough for me really to gain an appreciation of who they were or what their connection was.  Yes they could have been anyone, and that's part of the point, but they weren't just anyone and to watch a story like this with sufficient interest I have to know enough about the characters to care, and I didn't really get that in this case.  The female lead, Clementine, is a French teacher in Romania, frustrated by the rudeness of her pupils, and seemed much more active than her lover, Lucas.  When things start to happen he takes the lead, but only reluctantly, as if he knows that's what a man's supposed to do and does it.  The motives of ""them"" are meant to be inscrutable, and I understand that, but it leaves things pretty empty and hollow and unresolved.  That's not to discount the accomplishment of the filmmakers; they set out to tell a story that would scare the pants off of me and they came pretty close, and are obviously talented.  If you're in that kind of mood, and if you like this kind of thing, you're likely to appreciate ""Them.""  It's not for me.",1249516800,,3266,5.246153846153846
1048902,4,6305599033,"I mean, this movie is VERY different from your typical Hollywood kind of suspense- the kind of suspense Them offers is more, well, authentic, frightening, and interesting.

One thing that made the movie quite disturbing is that, I was never really sure if the man and woman constantly being attacked were actually being attacked by invisible demons, or if the trickiness of the camera work MADE it look like the children were invisible demons.  I'm pretty sure by the end the answer is revealed.  I won't spoil it for you though.

Whatever the case, there were some downright freaky moments throughout the movie.  It's pretty much nonstop heart-racing action as soon as the woman picks up that phone.

This movie does one thing extremely well (and much better than most Hollywood movies) and that's BUILD SUSPENSE.  You were never quite sure when the children were going to make an appearance, whether it was when the man and woman were trapped inside their home, or when they were outside making their escape through the forest.

The ending is a bit shocking to me.  You won't get a typical ending that's for sure.  You have to read the dialogue at the bottom of the screen as the movie rolls along because the characters don't speak in English, but the second half of the movie doesn't have a whole lot to read anyway so it's no big deal.

This is definitely a different style of horror than what my American buns are used to, that's for sure.  I probably need to get warmed up to this authentic foreign style of horror to appreciate the atmosphere better though- it still appears somewhat like a low budget flick to me, whether it's intentional or not.

Still, a really good movie that does many things right.",1249344000,3,1712,4.666666666666667

1048988,2,6305599033,"Clementine and Lucas, a French couple living in a remote house in Romania, are terrorized by a group of strangers who seem determined to kill them.

With a running time of only 74 minutes, ""Them"" can best be described as a traditional horror movie with all of the unnecessary bits cut away. The vast majority of the film is made up of Clementine and Lucas being terrorized by ""them"", and these scenes of terror are very good. They are well made, tense scenes that other horror directors could learn a lot from. However, one of the ""unnecessary"" bits that was omitted from this film is the initial character development. We are introduced to Clementine and Lucas and told that she is a teacher and he a writer, but that is about it. The result of this is that when these characters are terrorized, the audience doesn't care. Similarly, no background is provided for ""them"". Admittedly, at the end it becomes apparent that this is for shock value when the nature of ""them"" is finally revealed, but for the preceding 70 minutes, not knowing who ""they"" are, or even having a vague idea, again leads to us caring less for their victims.

Even though it claims to be based on real events, the general plot of ""Them"" is not original and I have seen many films almost identical to this one. One such film is the highly underrated ""Vacancy"". Anyone considering watching this film is recommended to watch one of these other films instead.

1048989,4,6305599033,"The best thing 'Them' has going for it is the pacing, which is exactly what many people will think is the worst thing.  If you are more in tune with the fast paced horror of a '28 Days After' or  the 'Underworld' saga, then this movie is probably not for you.  If, instead, you appreciate slow and steady tension that builds thoughout the movie, then you'll find a lot to like with 'Them'.  That's not to say that it treads on any new ground necessarily, but only that the directors make excellent use of the techniques available to tell their fairly predictable horror tale.

The movie follows Clementine, a French language teacher in Romania, and her writer boyfriend Lucas, who are terrorized one night by unknown tormentors in their isolated country home.  As I said, nothing new here that hasn't been done from as far back as 'When a Stranger Calls' from the late 70's.  Except this time it's based on a true story, and directors Moreau and Palud make the most of it with great camera work and editing.  Both Olivia Bonamy and Michael Cohen as the strangers in a strange land turn in excellent performances as well, and honestly, I rooted for them all the way up until the end.

Several things added to the baseline creepiness of this movie, none of which would top watching this all by yourself, late at night, in a country home far from any help.  Knowing that it was based on true events is downright morbid and chilling.  Also, the director's judicious use of music adds another layer to the tension by not overplaying their hand (I'd have to watch it again, but there's very little I remember for a soundtrack so to speak.  Only the sound effects from the woods).

Patience is the word here, as it does take several minutes before the main story gets going.  I felt that the added wait only added weight to the tension, but I give over my suspension of belief pretty easily to the filmmakers.  It's up to them to lose me.  More discerning viewers, or at least those that the directors have to work hard at getting their attention, may want to take a pass on 'Them'.  For the rest of us though, it's definitely worth renting.",1238544000,14,2134,4.515625
1048990,4,6305599033,"Ils (David Moreau and Xavier Palud, 2005)

Okay. While I will not take back everything I have said about the inverse relationship between the publicity a French horror film receives in America and its quality, I will say that Ils is the first example I have come across of a French horror film that got a pretty heavy publicity push in America when being released on DVD that's actually good. (By ""good"" here, read ""effective and actually halfway scary"".) But, you know, it's a seventy-seven minute film, and twenty-three minutes into it (that's damn close to halfway), I was still wondering when the actual movie was going to start. Interestingly enough, and this is one of the things that really tickles me when it happens (I tend to think of this as the director having a mastery over pacing), about ten seconds after I thought that, the movie kicked into gear. And the second it did... wham. (So tell me, why is it that Moreau and Palud, who were given the thankless task of remaking The Eye, did such a bad job with that one?)

The plot: a French couple, Lucas (Little Jerusalem's Michal Cohen) and Clmentine (Jefferson in Paris' Olivia Bonamy) are looking forward to a quiet evening alone in their new, and quite spacious, digs outside Bucharest, Romania. Problem is, there seems to be a gang of nasty, murderous rogues roaming the countryside. We meet them in the extended opening scene, which shows a mother and daughter running afoul of them. This night, they've decided they're going to play with Lucas and Clem. The rest of the film, fifty-four minutes, depicts the terror Lucas and Clem are put through at the hands of their attackers.

Unlike many films of this sort, Ils does not rely on gore (think Inside) or cheap jumps (think Vacancy) to scare the viewer; while both of these things do appear, as they do in almost every modern horror film, they're used judiciously, so that they actually work for the first time in years. It has all the atmosphere of the better, underrated French horror films of recent years (Calvaire, Saint Ange, and Sheitan all immediately come to mind), and that's what really drives the suspense. (As for the Big Reveal[TM], I find it hard to understand why anyone, especially in America, would consider the ""twist"" aspect of the identity of the killers at all shocking.) Thinking back on it, I can't remember a French film, save Saint Ange, I've liked better than this one in recent memory. Very good stuff; give it a shot. *** ",1238371200,2,2471,4.712962962962963

I checked out the positive reviews on Amazon and it sounded like it was going to be a classic horror movie.  This movie will receive a negative review from me and I find it hard to believe that someone would actually be shaking with fear after watching this movie.
  This movie had the approach of everything happening step by step like a novice guide to making a horror movie.  Part one, watch the mother and daughter's sterile tragic demise.  Part two, understand what your leading bland female does for a living before she goes home to her man.  Part three, get to know the boring leading male before he has dinner with his lady.  Part five, they are invaded by ""THEM.""  Part six, they try to escape from ""THEM.""  Part seven, see ""THEM"" leave the scene of the crime and it's the end of the movie.  What a waste of time!
  The scare factor didn't work when you were reminded that this was based on an actual event.  The leading couples were generic and there will be absolutely no emotional investments in their character development department.  Their only purpose in this movie is to be scared, run and hide, and try to escape for help.  I won't reveal the group of people who comprise of ""THEM,"" but since I'm one foot taller than most of my attackers, I'm going to run after ""THEM"" and make ""THEM"" scared for ever trying to mess with me.  You'll know what I mean after finding out who ""THEM"" group of people are.  I've seen other movies of these type of attackers that creeps me out.

  It was extremely irritating for me to hear the couples running inside the house or even to hear ""THEM"" running around loosely inside the house.  It wasn't creepy and it was no different from hearing someone banging the hammer over and over far too long to the point where you remove the hammer away from this person and zonk them over the head with it for being such an annoying pest!  When the couple are running outside, the running sound effect was horrendously fake and embarrassing to hear.

Here we have a little film called Them.  Though not a long film (maybe an hour and a quarter at most), we have nonstop suspense and guessing from the pre-credit beginning to the shocking ending.  This is a story of a young French couple living in Rumania, where the young woman works as a French teacher.  Luckily for them, it seems, they were able to rent a beautiful manor house in a secluded and quiet country wooded setting.

But what they thought would be a young couple's life of bliss turns out to be a horrific nightmare where they along with the audience just doesn't know who or what is behind their lurid predicament.  Are our antagonists common burglers who happen to choose the wrong house?  Do we have some form of cult or occult group lurking out in the middle of the woods?  Are our young couple just being harrassed by some indigent folks?

No matter what, whatever is out lurking around their home and whatever they want, soon turns into a life and death struggle for the young couple.  Escape to a population center is the only thing that will save our protagonists ... or so they think!  And that leads to the unbelievable ending ... what was out there and why they were out there.

Them claims to be based on a true story, and whether true or not, any speculation from the audience works to the film's advantage.  It follows a woman named Clementine and her husband named Lucas.  Clementine is a teacher who recently moved from France to a rural part of Romania.  The film opens with a scene that will tell you right off the bat what the film's intentions are but this only serves to heighten the degree to which the film's suspense is a massive success.  Clementine and Lucas are disturbed at their quiet and isolated home late in the evening and the disturbances escalate gradually and intensely.  Them seems like a 45 minute movie and I mean that as a huge compliment.  There hasn't been a more effective thriller in a few years and it's all done with very little violence, at least when compared to some of the other films that make up this recent wave of solid French horror films (i.e.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/-l-intrieur/dp/B00125WATQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8""> l'intrieur</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Haute-Tension/dp/B000ARFPMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Haute Tension</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frontire-s/dp/B0014VPFVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frontire(s)</a>).

The French have always made great films and we've seen transgressive French films surface more and more frequently over the last ten or twenty years (I think of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Irreversible/dp/B00009W0U4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Irreversible</a>&nbsp;and some of Catherine Breillat's work).  To see French cinema excel in this particular genre is no surprise and although Them's themes of paranoia and isolation are certainly in tune with this, it notably lacks the shock-factor that the more obviously violent associated films have.  It makes up for all of that by serving up top-notch suspense.  In fact I'd rather see horror go this route than the gore and splatter-fests that clean-up at American box offices this time a year on an annual basis.

This film makes no direct commentary but there are small voices denouncing Them as an indirect commentary and example of French fears regarding European Union expansion.  An interesting angle and critique of a film that may or may not actually even know better.  No worries; here in the states and perhaps everywhere else, the film will for the most part serve its purpose of sitting you down and taking you for a ride.

It is one of a long, long line of offenders which gives the villains superhuman powers of perception and movement when the villains are themselves not superhuman beings.  They are, in fact, quite easy to kill--when you can catch one, which is rare because they have such abundant ""magical"" powers.

Make your villain supernatural--with the attendant powers--or don't.  This movie is complete trash.  I got suckered into renting it because the back blurb told me it was scarier than Saw and Hostel.  That's not hard, since neither of those movies was scary--they just covered up their lack of subtlety with large amounts of gore.
""Them"" covers up its lack of plot with large amounts of screaming, blinking lights, and shadow-antics perpetrated by the mysteriously omnipotent killers.
I used to wonder whether amanita muscaria grew in France.  Now I know that it grows in abundance, since the writer, the director, the producer, all of the actors, the gaffer, the best boy, the set designer, the costume designer, and all of the makeup artists were obviously feasting on massive amounts of it from the time this piece of trash was conceived until the very end of production.

Yep, magic kids!

First there was INSIDE, the shockingly gory preggo-slash flick, then Frontier(S)-an almost Texas Chainsaw Massacre-ish flick and now THEM!

This film, unlike the other two mentioned is not quite as gore-driven and far more psychological. I don't really want to get in depth about the plot since you can read about it above or from one of the other various Amazon reviewers who have taken there precious time to sum it up, but I just felt I should write a review merely stating that I thought it was well worth my time...which is rare with film (ANY film-not just horror!) these days.

Them captivated me and held me in it's grasp the entire time.

Another winner from the best makers of horror out there....The French.

Another surprisingly spooky fact about this film is that it was based on true events.

The only downside to the film, which is why I took a star off, was that it (just like most other French horror films) just doesn't have the ""happy ending"" feeling that I usually like in horror.

Not being familiar at all with the story, I was able to quickly deduce from the poster that the perpetrators in this were going to be kids. This is really the big denouement/shock of the movie. The rest is very standard fair. The opening sequence was well done and very suspenseful. After that we lull into 20 minutes of ""get to know the main characters."" These people are dull and uninteresting, and nothing is done to make them seem more real than the people in a newspaper story. After that we get the terroizing of the couple by the perpetrators, which is also well done, but nothing new. Once it is revealed that children are doing these things, are leads do not seem shocked, surprised, curious, or remorseful. Very strange.  Not to ruin it for anyone, but the ending is not the usual hollywood cop out (""Invasion"" anyone?) that we see. Unfortunately, it is also not very satisfying either.

The only thing this movie has going for it is that it's (supposedly) based on a true story. In the terms of cinematography, I can't find anything redeeming here. What amazing sound and camera work are all these people talking about? It's filmed with a shaky handheld camera and, while featuring a creepy setting, comes nowhere close to what I'd call great camera work. The sound would be effective if it wasn't such bad quality. At one point one of the characters goes, ""Did you hear that?"", and I had to crank the volume all the way up just to be able to hear what the heck they were talking about. And finally, I don't understand how this could seriously scare anyone. It's unsettling, yes. It's disturbing, given the final revelation. But terrifying? Alice In Wonderland is more terrifying than this. It's basically one long chase scene that uses just about every typical horror movie cliche, starting with the unseen attacker and ending with cookie-cutter characters. The entire movie is one huge cliche from start to finish. It's been done a billion times before (not to mention, better). I should have read the reviews and all the excited comparisons to High Tension before I picked up this tripe - because High Tension stank, and not surprisingly, so does this.",1217030400,6,1358,4.758474576271187

I rented Them without realizing that it was the basis for The Strangers, a film I saw last month and considered a highly effective and terrifying film about a sadistic and macabre home invasion at a secluded country house.  The premise for both films is almost exactly the same, except for the actual characters and the location of the action (U.S. as opposed to Romania).  Whereas The Strangers is more brutal and ominous, Them is a bit more restrained and economical, it's running time about 1 hour 15 minutes.  The tormentors are barely seen; they are but footsteps, fleeting silhouettes and blink-of-an-eye apparitions down long corridors.  This is highly effective direction and works to the films advantage, especially when the viewer is finally allowed to see who the perpetrators are and left to assume the possible reasons for this ruthless act of torture.  The actors are superb, their terror almost palpable.  There's some visual ambiguity designed to trick the viewer through the eyes of the protagonist and they work especially well.  The director knows only to well how to set a mood of hold-your-breath tension.  An enormous country house in which only two people live, offers an extra large canvas on which to project a threat around every corners and in every doorway and he takes full advantage and delivers the goods with extreme assurance.

1049174,2,6305599033,"In the ""If this Dacha is rockin', don't come a knockin'!"" category comes this French horror flick by Xavier Palud & David Moreau (who went on to helm the execrable US remake of the Korean horror flick ""The Eye""---which alone should tell you all you need to know about ""Ils""), which chronicles a day in the life of perambulating, exceptionally photogenic Frenchies Lucas & Clem and the horrible thing that befalls them when they mistake of answering the doorbell one spooky night in Bucharest.

And no, it's not pizza delivery.

""Ils"" wants to be the next hyperkinetic French freakfest, like Alexandre Aja's supremely brutal and belligerently nasty ""Haute Tension"": in that way, ""Ils"" is like your little brother. It wants to be cool, hip, happening. Only its your little brother, it just doesn't have the horror Daddy pants to carry it off, and worse still, it's hobbled, freakishly, by an opening Minivan massacre that is carried off with such creepy efficiency that it makes everything that comes afterward taste like cinematic chicken.

SHORT REVIEW: Yeesh. If your idea of a great time is watching a couple of Frenchies run and hide and run some more up and down the same dark corridor, you'll dig this flick! It's just like the French in World War 2! Otherwise avoid with extreme prejudice.

LONG REVIEW: Yeesh. This movie contends that when people shine flashlights through the windows at 3AM, any normal person is going run screaming around the house in mortal terror. I've never heard of Death by Flashlight, though I would be willing to give ""Ils"" the benefit of the doubt if the movie were actually scary.

The flick is creepy, and well shot, but the central conceit: that the main characters are huge weenies with all the spine of a toadstool---is just one I couldn't clamber aboard. For instance: at one point the hubby is barricaded in the toilet, pretty much in a fetal position and gibbering in fear, while his wife is thrashing around in the attic above the john (I didn't get it either. Romanians). She sees somebody's foot, just a few inches away from her face: ie, one of THEM! In her attic! Wearing a SHOE! Probably holding a FLASHLIGHT!

This is meant to be a high-tension scene, the very height of terror.

This might have sent the Frogs into vapors, but I don't think ""Ils"" will play well over here. It's just not believable. For one thing, Americans own guns. Lots of guns. There are about three of them for every one of us, which is a pretty civilized ratio, frankly. So the American version of ""Them"" goes like this:

1) THEM shine their flashlights into JSG's window at 3AM

2) JSG responds in kind with a barrage of 9MM hollow-point ammuntion

3) Flashlight boy, perforated with a ton of new air holes, gets quiet

4) Roll credits

Another problem with ""Them"" reminds me of Stephen King talking about horror and the unknown in ""Danse Macabre"": the horror writer or director knows that fear of the unknown---of the possibility of an 80 foot bug behind that door---is far more terrifying than the Bug itself. But at some point, the director *has* to open the door and show the Bug.

And in ""Them"", it ain't a very big Bug. It's a real downer, actually, a 100 kiloton nuclear downer, that makes Clem and Lucas seem even sillier and (if it's possible) even *more* French.

Another thing: any time you're trying to pull off a stalker/slasher flick, it's critical to have a firm handle of movie topography. On a basic level, think the Friday the 13th series: if you see the Killer with the machete waddle into Bunkhouse #13 and switch off the light, then the Creep Quotient is gonna be *very* high when Amy the pretty Head Camp Counselor sidles over to #13 for a shower.

But Palud and Moreau play fast and loose with movie geography, so it not only becomes impossible to really sympathize with the main characters or feel their terror, but even to figure out if this is the movie you started watching---apparently 3-room bungalows in the Bucharest suburbs come with nuclear missile silos, generator bunkers, and a cave tunnel system included. Who knew?

""Ils"" is 90-minutes of standard stuff you've seen done (better) a million times before. The real horror is that truly unsettling European cinema like ""Calvaire"" and ""Seul Contre Tous"" languish in obscurity when hackwork like this gets a full court press. Doorbell ditch this one.

1049175,3,6305599033,"My fellow Amazon reviewers are split on this French/Romanian fright flick. They have all presented their arguments and justified their reasons for liking or disliking this film. Amazon friends; Dave K and M didn't care much for this film while Mike Liddell and Puzzle Box stand behind this ""goreless"" entry into the horror genre. All of them have written excellent reviews. I recommend reading their reviews if you (ever) do finish reading mine.

THEM (Ils) is a French/Romanian suspense thriller which is the handiwork of David Moreau and Xavier Palud. Suspense is difficult to do, it involves the right timing, with the psychological aspect  observed; otherwise it will end up a bit too cheesy and ineffective. Lately, Hollywood has done the cheap way out; filming gruesome gorefests that seems to be desperate attempts to induce psychological whiplash. The elements that made Hitchcock and John Carpenter films so successful are becoming rare; oftentimes nonexistent, modern filmmakers tend to rely too much on visual manipulation. ""Them"" at least, tries a different approach, and makes an attempt at psychological horror without wallowing to blood and gore. The fact that the film is a fictionalized account based on true events took me aback, but one thing I know, the directors really didn't know what happened so consider this film an informed (if over exaggerated) guess.

Plot: Clementine and Lucas are young lovers who live outside the outskirts of a Romanian town. She's a teacher and he's a writer, they live a happy, quiet life in the countryside. But little do they know that the night will bring them terror; they've surrounded by unseen assailants. What do they want? What would it take to escape THEM?
Pretty simple premise, right?

Please be advised that I have no idea of Romanian lifestyle nor do I consider myself an expert in horror films. Moreau and Palud aren't reinventing anything with this outing and while it may be a decent attempt in recreating actual events, I have mixed feelings about the film. I've mentioned that suspense should be handled carefully and I believe the most effective way to induce such viewer reactions and interactions (you wouldn't believe how involved I was when I saw ""Halloween"" and ""Psycho"") is by emotional content in forming an attachment to the leads.

True, the filmmakers probably didn't want the film to be a commentary on how bleak the situation in Romania is, as to why the antagonists are the way they are or if the couple did something wrong to deserve such treatment (I can`t back this up any further without spoiling the film), but I really had a difficult time connecting to the two protagonists. What it does is attempt to intermingle the emotions of the viewer with that of the two leads. Obviously, the directors' intentions are to sidestep character development in order to deliver a thrilling experience. They waste no time in setting things up with very minor character background then they grab you by the throat and squeezes tightly; the film never lets up with its intensity. From then on, the film is reduced to a number of chase sequences that it becomes an average cat and mouse game that uses the same formulas that we've all seen before. The sequences reminded me a lot of the film ""Vacancy"".

To its credit, the film does have its share of nice set designs. The house that Clem and Lucas are living in has an eerie feel and emulates a very claustrophobic feel. The way the film is shot has a ""greenish hue"" that those familiar with Japanese Horror films would know what I am talking about. This is a nice touch that it adds a feeling of dread and bleakness in the proceedings. The performances by Olivia Bonamy and Michael Cohen (Clem and Lucas respectively) are quite decent. Clementine is a ""screamer"" that does add to the terrified lady bit and Lucas has a quiet personality. The directors did try to intermingle our emotions with those of the protagonists, with some success. The mingling of emotions between the viewer and the leads to promote terror is a clever style if done right; we can care about the characters even if they are a bit hollow and underdeveloped. All in all, I did enjoy the ""unknown"" attackers gimmick up to the ""shocking"" climax.

David Moreau and Xavier Palud aren't reinventing the horror thriller genre, ""Them"" is a modest attempt from Romania (or is it France?). However, I did feel like the filmmakers were relying too much on how the Press probably sensationalized this fact-based affair in Romania to bring people in theater seats that the script was too predictable and full of holes, it did feel that it suffered from lack of research on what really happened. Still, I can see why this film would either be loved or disliked by its viewers. The film did successfully induce a feeling of a dreadful situation that emulates an eerily intense feel and the identity of the antagonists is very disturbing. ""Them"" is a straightforward chase film losing any excess meat such as intricate storytelling and character development...
Enjoy it for what it is, a 77 minute thrill ride! (includes credits)

1049176,4,6305599033,"French couple Clementine (Olivia Bonamy) and Lucas (Michael Cohen) are living near Bucharest, Romania. Clementine teaches at a French school and Lucas is a writer trying to work on his latest story but is struggling with writer's block. One a night in the middle of October a mother and daughter are involved in a car accident near where Clementine and Lucas are living. They are safe after the crash, but the mother disappears and the daughter is later strangled in the car. Clementine passes the accident scene on her way back from school the next day. That afternoon she and Lucas enjoy a playful evening of eating, laughing, and love making. Then Clementine hears some strange noises. She wakens Lucas and they investigate only to find Clementine's car being stolen. The lights go out, the phone goes dead, the strange noises return in force, and seemingly alien lights are seen outside of the house and shining through all the windows. The couple find themselves at siege and fighting for their lives as they are invaded and attacked by THEM.

With a running time of less than eighty minutes, THEM is an incredibly short film. However, it's also a highly engaging film. Basically, the movie revolves around two people being stalked and hunted in their own home by beings that aren't revealed until the end. The filmmakers did an excellent job of making Lucas and Clem seem like two very real and likeable people. They are a happy and young couple, deeply in love who seem to enjoy life. What happens to them, is so very frightening because it ties into one of the deepest fears that people have, the fear of one's home being broken into and not being able to do anything about it. The film also works so well because it relies upon some real old-fashioned Hitchcockian suspense: the mood is set more by sounds and things not seen than by anything that is seen; the imagination can create images and a mood more horrific and unsettling than anything than can be captured on the screen.

As horrifying as THEM is for most of the movie, I have to admit that I was disappointed by the reveal of who the ""them"" turned out to be. I'll try not to give anything away, but the filmmakers seem to have been trying to tie another fear people have as well as touching upon a political and socioeconomic issue that is affecting countries around the world. Despite the disappointment, the ending images are almost as horrifying because even though the story is fictional (it claims that it is based upon a ""true story"" though there is no such evidence), it is something that people believe could and may already be happening.

1049276,2,6305599033,"There is a whole lot of hype surrounding Them and while I can understand why so many people liked it, but for me it just never really works and I can honestly say for the majority of the movie I was actually quite bored. Them runs at only about 77-minutes, but at times it felt longer. Them takes sort of the basic slasher movie element, but rather than make a splatter flick it's much more of a suspense/thriller. I was hoping the movie would be more than it was, but in the end it was a by the books movie.

There really isn't any plot at all, which is something a lot of horror movies seem to not have a lot of the time, but I'd rather have a weak plot rather than no plot at all. If this was a splatter flick the lack of plot wouldn't be a big deal. Now I know some people are probably thinking there wasn't enough deaths and gore and that's why I don't like it. That cannot be any further from the truth seeing as most of my all time favorite horror movies feature little blood and quite often not even a high body count.

For a movie like this to work for me I have to care about the characters. If I dislike them or don't care about them whenever they are in danger the suspense won't work and that is why I didn't like Them. The characters in my opinion were just flat out boring. They have no depth and honestly nothing they say or do is very interesting. Once the movie gets going I didn't care enough about them to feel the suspense and tension when they are in danger.

The screenplay written by David Moreau & Xavier Palud wasn't bad or anything, but it was just simply boring. I felt they created two of the most boring characters and the conversations between the two are sleep inducing. Nothing they say or do is interesting at all and they have no depth to the characters as well. Again I go back to what I said before I don't care about the characters any possible suspense or tension will be lost. If the characters died right away or lived I simply didn't care and again all the suspense and tension is lost. The script wasn't poorly written, but it was just boring.

David Moreau & Xavier Palud also serve as the directors and they do fair a lot better. They show a lot of potential, but are hurt by their script. I will say the movie is rather intense; by the 30-minute mark the home invasion happens and it never lets up until the end of the movie so they had the right idea, but again they were failed by their script. I do think the filmmakers have potential though; there was a good set up on the suspense and had I liked the characters I probably would have been on the edge of my seat the whole time. But once again I have to say it; all this is lost since I didn't care about the two leads. As I said there is some potential, but they do need to work on a few things in my opinion. In a sense it's the same scene over and over again. Hear a noise and run away, hear a noise, run away.

The twist in the movie I personally did not like at all. I really don't see anything scary about it. I couldn't help, but sort of laugh. Some people like the twist and thought it was creepy. I suppose in a way it is. I don't wanna give it away so I won't say much, but I suppose it is creepy, but they didn't exactly strike fear in me.

Them is the type of movie you're gonna watch and either be bored like I was or you'll love it. It really seems to be that type of movie. If you are one of those that will love the movie you will be held in suspense through out the movie. There are a lot of positive reviews and while I may disagree I can totally understand why so many people loved it. Again you'll either be bored or love it.

Overall I thought it was a nice try and was an intense flick, but the characters just didn't do it for me, therefore the suspense was lost on me.",1207267200,7,3792,4.054739652870494

Don't get me wrong it was good for what it is, solid direction, good acting, and great atmosphere, but it was just more of the same to me, no story, just tension and nothing else. Maybe I'm being hard on it, but I've heard a lot of hype surroundind this flick. Overpriced and a way too short of a running time in my opinion. Worth a rent.",1206748800,5,772,4.443661971830986

1049280,4,6305599033,"Writer and Director team David Moreau and Xavier Palud know fear and have made a tense horror film with moments of greatness.  They know it's not what you see that scares you but what you don't, tapping into childhood fears such as the dark, strange noises, and thinking you've seen something which helps with brilliant camerawork.
The film starts in Bucharest Romania with a mother and daughter arguing in their car when they have a car accident.  The car accident in itself is scary because the filmmakers have chosen to do a documentary style which adds that, this is really happening feel along the lines of Tobe Hooper's classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  That real feel is appropriate being we are told at the beginning the film is inspired by actual events and again reminded in greater detail about said events at the end, so you can't necessarily repeat this is just a movie to yourself.  As a side note the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie trailer plays automatically once you put in the dvd and is also freaky and gets you ready for the film, but back to the accident.  The mother crashes her car into a utility pole and gets out to open the hood while her daughter starts the car, we can't see the mom from where the daughter is and she suddenly stops responding.  When the girl gets out to look she cannot find her mom so she calls mom over and over to the dark woods and finally a voice other than her mom's answers back from the woods.
The next scene we meet Clementine (Olivia Bonamy)  a beautiful school teacher from France who is finishing up a long day and heading home to her lover Lucas.  On her way to their secluded new home which they appear to be renovating she sees police and tow trucks tending to the car mentioned above which crashed not far from their house.
A conventional scene of Clementine and Lucas joking around and eating dinner shows an intimate side of the characters which invites us into their lives.  Following dinner Lucas doses off on the couch only to be awakened by a stray dog barking who visits from time to time. Lucas goes outside to provide the dog with a snack and then heads to bed.
What follows is a home invasion that is done with some of the most effective scares I've seen in this area of horror.  First, before Clementine heads to bed she receives a strange phone call, after which she is awakened by a car radio outside, their house is far from the road and secluded so this alarms her, all this is done ever so subtly and realisitc.  She wakes up Lucas and they both go downstairs turning on each light as they go, like most would.  When they look out their kitchen window they notice Clementine's car has been moved.
It is subtle real scares like this that are terrifying because we can put ourselves in those situations.  The actors are great and in the making of documentary we learn that Olivia Bonamy who plays Clementine had a fear of heights (which she had to overcome in the film utilizing this fear for the part) and mentions this film is the only one that stuck with her after it was over, adding it's hard to sleep at night.  There is also a scene of her crying but not for the film, from exhaustion and injuries she got while filming, and being in a constant state of tension.  Also on the making of documentary there is no joking or laughing, everyone took this film seriously and it shows.
I give this the highest recommendation possible, this horror film is a must own.  This is not in your face blood and guts, it's tapping into hardwired fears of the unknown and evil that exists that there are no answers for.  I feel the film will get scarier on multiple viewings after knowing everyones fate.

1049281,5,6305599033,"I have no idea how it will play on DVD, but this was easily one of the scariest movies I have ever seen in the theatre. It is extremely simple, quite short and consistently tense and unnerving almost the entire time. It ranks with the best scary movies of all time and, as others have noted, easily the best of the genre since The Descent...and without the gore.",1206316800,3,362,4.338235294117647
1049282,3,6305599033,"I hit the lights, snuggled close to my someone special, and prepared to watch this movie.  Oh boy, it started out pretty damn creepy.  I found myself watching behind my hands a couple times.  I guess it had a lot of potential, then BOOM.  We find out what THEM are and I laughed kinda.  I mean totally foolish.  I am a Mom to 4 kids and let's say it takes more than THEM to frighten me.  Hahaha, oh boy, SO MUCH potential and ability to be a SCARY, truly terrifying movie, all gone to waste.  Too bad, I wanted to like it.",1206144000,6,522,4.049019607843137
1049283,4,6305599033,It had to happen sooner or later. An American remake of this film entitled The Strangers stars Liv Tyler and is coming out this Spring or Summer. Too bad most people won't see the original version first.,1205884800,2,203,4.513513513513513
1049284,4,6305599033,"In French-Romanian thriller ""Them"" (""Ils""), a French couple Clmentine (Olivia Bonamy) and Lucas (Michal Cohen) are living alone in a big, old mansion in the Bucharest suburb surrounded by the woods. When the night comes, Clmentine and Lucas are terrorized by the presence of ""Them"" roaming outside, waiting for the chance to invade their house.

The simple story works. Actually, the storytelling of ""Them"" is very orthodox with its frightening introductory part that sets up the tone of the entire film. Though some of the techniques to scare audiences are not exactly new, the director team David Moreau and Xavier Palud successfully build up the tension of each scene with clever use of authentic locations of Romania and grainy, brooding photography.

""Them"" is free from boring dialogues and flashy visuals. Gore is almost non-existent, but that makes this atmospheric thriller scarier and more intense. The stylish 77-minute film is a realistic take of one scary night, tightly edited and well-acted.",1205625600,5,1006,5.28125
