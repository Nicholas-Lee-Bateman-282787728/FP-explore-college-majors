5685111,5,B00C1AIMXE,"This 3D Blu-ray release is stunning! The image is crystal clear with excellent contrast and black levels. Soundtrack is also very strong. But the 3D is extraordinary! Some of the best I've ever seen, and much better than a lot of 3D films recently issued. Jack Arnold understood the 3D process and how to fill the space between the screen and the audience. Bubbles, fish, silt, spear guns, clouds of Rotonol all find there way into your lap. It's terrific. And the Creature costume has never looked as detailed as in this beautifully restored print.

Highly recommended!",1370304000,15,570,4.876288659793815
5685112,5,B00C1AIMXE,"I remember my mother gathering my 2 brothers and me, decked in our PJs, into the family Plymouth and heading to the drive-in movie theater.  I was a kid.  It was a big deal.  It was 3-D!  Among others on the bill, was the ""Creature From The Black Lagoon.""  The 3-D gimmick has come and gone a few times since then and appeared to have made a real comeback recently.  Yet, checking out the Sunday ads in the paper (Best Buy, Fry's, Target, Tiger Direct), there was not one featuring a 3-D TV for sale.  In any case, I watched this Blu ray disc in good old fashion 2-D and it looks better than ever.

The story centers on a group of scientists who find a large webbed hand and part of an arm in the Brazilian Amazon.  Believed to be a water creature, scientists who are also scuba divers are recruited.  Among them are David (Richard Carlson) and Mark, his boss (Richard Denning) both playing for the affections of statuesque Kay (Julie Adams).  While the story is pretty much a straight forward beauty and the beast, director Jack Arnold and his team create an above average ""horror"" film.

The movie was essentially shot in two locations.  One was the Universal Studios lot and some of the shots are well done, but others are limited to the technical capabilities of the time.  All of the underwater filming was done in a Florida grotto and they are remarkably well done, especially when you remember that the film was shot in 3-D using the big and cumbersome cameras of the era.  The creature, even with a rubber suit is plenty creepy given its human characteristics.

The most memorable scene (and yes, one I remember as a kid) is when Kay decides to go swimming in the lagoon in her white, and brief for the day, one piece suit.  With the camera in the water shooting upward to the surface we see the shadowed silhouette of Kay gracefully swimming across the surface. Yeah, that got my attention, then and now...and more importantly, that of the creature. Director Steven Spielberg must have remembered that scene too (see ""Jaws"").  This goes on for a while and the creature joins in, swimming upside down below Eve.  Great swimming by Ricou Browning who played the creature in the underwater scenes.

While the creature manages to kill a few crew members, it was he who was attacked first and he doesn't seem to have menace in mind when it comes to Eve.  Mostly we are sympathetic to his plight.  He's lonely.  He wants a friend.  My only complaint with the film  is that each time the creature is featured, we get a menacing, shrill brass section musical blast.  It's very annoying and unnecessary given the otherwise excellent score.

The Blu ray version is currently available as part of the Universal Classic Monsters box set and will be available as a stand alone disc in June, 2013.  The transfer has a 1080p resolution and is in black and white with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  While not quite up to the quality of some of the earlier films in this collection, the film still looks very good.  Detail is excellent although there are brief moments of glitchiness.  Never sure if this is the adaptation or a problem in the original print being used.  In any case, it was never a big deal for me.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio Mono (2-channel)and is very good.  The dialog is clear and properly centered.  As noted above the music can startle at times but that was the intent unfortunately.  Ms. Adams screams are excellent.  Extras include a documentary about the production and include the still fit and beautiful Julie Adams, Browning, Ben Chapman (the land based creature)and others.  An audio commentary track is narrated by historian Tom Weaver.  Some ""Creature"" trailers, photos and a short about Universal's back lot round out the extras.",1365638400,,3754,4.62178517397882
5685113,5,B00C1AIMXE,"It is the bane of all great creatures to seek beautiful women in white bathing suits. Especially if you think you can retaliate those fools that try to capture you.  Just be sure that they do not ask you to STICK around.

Screen play by Harry Essex, Dr. Carl Maia (Antonio Moreno) finds what appears to be a fossil of an undiscovered creature in the Amazon. Soon we will realize that the creature may not be as extinct as the doctor assumed. On a return expedition we find one of the scientists is a beautiful girl Kay Lawrence (Julia Adam), ""You guessed it"" she is in a white bathing suit. The creature never stood a chance.

In the movie ""The Seven Year Itch"" (1955) Marilyn Monroe feels sorry for the creature ""He just craved a little affection""

You cannot go wrong with a Jack Arnold directed film. And Richard Carlson ""It Came From Outer Space"" (1953), is a good good-guy.

5685122,3,B00C1AIMXE,"Creature From the Black Lagoon, 1954 film

The opening scenes show an explosion. The planet Earth was created then cooled down. Rains created oceans. [Where did that water come from?] The ""struggle for existence"" led to many generations of creatures. [You hear the cry of a kookaburra, a bird found only in Australia.] An explorer sees a strange creature's hand in shale. Then a similar live hand is extended from the water! Down below the kelp grows. A scuba diver ascends from the deep waters. [Note the projected background behind their boat.] That hand belonged to an amphibian. A scientist talks about future space travel. Back at that site the creature attacks the two who watched. A boat transports the scientists along the Amazon river. They find the dead men. Where is Kay?

The scientists use a pick and shovel to dig into that shale. A sieve separates the dirt. Can they search further upstream? [Would scientists travel unarmed into a wild land?] The boat sails into the Black Lagoon. They explore the waters. Underwater photography shows their actions. Suddenly we see the creature! The men gather samples. The woman goes for a swim. [No fear of leeches?] The creature swims after her. She senses something. Then the net captures something very heavy, but it escapes. The men search the lake again. The creature is seen and swims away! They pursue and shoot a spear into him. [No blood leaks out."" ""It appeared to be human."" [Note the large 5x7 negatives used.] The comango fish has lungs and can breathe air. They hear a scream. A man tells of a demon, a man-fish. Captain Lucas has a powder that is used to catch fish, rotenone. It causes paralysis. Mark keeps his Winchester handy.

At night men stand guard with rifles. [Too many?] The creature appears at night, then swims away. David and Mark follow it. The creature appears on land. ""We've got him."" David wants to stay behind to finish their work. At night the creature escapes and attacks a man. They decide to leave this place in spite of Mark's objection. But a log blocks the exit and it can't be lifted. The scientists quarrel over who goes first into the water. The creature swims away to attack Mark. They are still trapped. Can they mix a solution of rotenone? David goes below to clear the tangle, it is pulled away. But the creature grabs Kay and dives into the water. David goes into that grotto to find Kay. The creature appears, but the other men shoot their Winchester rifles and drive him away into the lake. Is this the end?

This was the first underwater 3-dimensional movie. It was filmed in an undeveloped part of Florida for the underwater scenes. The rest was filmed at a back lot in Hollywood. The music was used for the spots that had no dialogue because it was underwater. There was a problem in 3-D movies when the two films were out of synchronization. The first threat from a creature from the sea was recorded in ""Beowulf"" in the Dark Ages.",1499644800,,2939,4.657032755298651

This is by far my all time favorite of the Universal classic monsters. I got this blu-ray 3-d copy for a steal at less than $10. As a digitally remastered version, watching it on a modern, HD 3-d TV took the movie to a whole new level. This is how 3-d movies should always be done. Not over the top, but tons of little effects. The underwater sequences will make you want to brush the algae and particles aside, the Big Bang sequence at the beginning is stunning by today's standards in 3-d, even in B&W. Other small, but highly effective visual effects make this, IMO, one of the greatest 3-D movies ever made. My wife and I were both blown away by the quality and 3-d effects.

5685173,5,B00C1AIMXE,"1. ABOUT THE 3D: This is a true 3D movie, not like the post 3D conversion done after the movie is made like how todays movies are done. If you don't know the difference, buy Predator 3D. This movie was shot in 2D. 25 years later they then use a software to convert the movie to 3D. The same process done to all modern day 3D movies. Basically, it takes the flatten image in the front and separates it from the background. Both images still look flat, but it adds depth between the 2. Then buy this movie and see what true 3D looks like. Everything from the people to the background show depth and things actually pop out of the screen.

2. ABOUT THE BLU-RAY: The quality of the blu-ray was exceptional. This is not one of the movies that took the basic dvd quality movie and put in on a blu-ray (like Hang Em High or Double Impact). The film was crystal clear. That, alone, made the purchase of the movie worth it.

3. SPECIAL FEATURES: The special features were very informative about the making of the movie. I'm one of those people that love to know how the movie was made. From the 3D process, to creation of the creature, locations and more.

Buy this 3D Movie for the following reasons:

1. Great horror movie
2. Crystal clear Blu-ray quality
3. REAL 3D
4. Excellant special features",1415577600,3,1289,4.358333333333333

5685180,5,B00C1AIMXE,"I saw this movie in 3D as a child.  Frankly, I would not have taken my kids or grandkids to this movie at the age my parents took me, but that's another story.  The 3D comes across fine on my Vizio 3D TV, but I really don't understand why it wasn't released in HD Anaglyph 3D with the original glasses (or you can buy a bit more rugged red/cyan glasses for $3 or $4 a pair).  Then any Bluray player and HDTV could display it.  I think they missed a lot of sales doing it this way.

Anyway, my 8 year old granddaughters may just be old enough for this now, so we're ready when they come for their next sleepover.  If you have never seen this movie, you need to buy it.

Being over the age of 14, I'm not really a fan of 3-D. However the presentation tonight was in 3-D and I enjoyed it.  In this movie 3-D effects are not over utilized as they are in more modern films.

Some of the dialogue is hokey, and the characters inconsistent and stereotyped.

Still, the whole thing is good fun, and it has its moments. Julie Adams in that white swimsuit is magnificent, and the cinematography of her swim scene with the creature under her in the water is marvelous.

The 3D is effective, and it reveals those scenes in which the actors are obviously on a soundstage, in a tank of water, with a fake, projected backdrop. You can tell the backdrop is flat and a projection.

5685214,5,B00C1AIMXE,"For a million years there has been legends of half-human/half-fish humanoid creatures  who have survived since the dinosaur age. A group of people like Dr. David Reed (Richard Carlson) with his fiancee Kay Lawrence (Juliee Adams), Dr. Carl Maia (Antonio Moreno) and others have discovered a bizarre fossil as they go into the Amazon jungle to see if this kind of creature still exist, yet a Gill-Man is still alive as it sets his eyes on Kay as he falls in love with her and kidnaps the woman yet her boyfriend with others must try to save her.

One of the greatest sci-fi and horror films ever and the last Universal monster icon movie ever in the franchise which began with the 20's versions of Hunchback/Phantom of the Opera then with Dracula in 1931. Universal had box-office success with the 3D Sci-fi joint ""It Came from Outer Space"" and they decided to do something different, Jack Arnold who directed this film had a concept for a film that is inspired by South American legends of gill-men and the 1933 classic ""King Kong"" especially the old story of Beauty and The Beast. The performances with style and atmosphere are superb, not only those but it gave an iconic monster in both the sci-fi and horror genres as the Gill-Man has became a beloved icon like the other Universal monsters making him a hit character as he is in merchandise over the years and even had a popular show in Universal Studios. The film was a box-office hit and one of the first major 3D films, this movie is a great work of horror/sci-fi cinema that is very influential.

I do own this in the Universal Monsters collection BD set as i gotta say this BD offers solid picture and sound with both 2D and for the first time in years, the 3D version which requires a 3D TV with glasses and a 3D BD or PS3 for the effect. The features include ""Back to the Lagoon"" a retrospective documentary from 2000 about the film's legacy, production photographs, commentary by Film Historian Tom Weaver, 100 Years of Universal: The Lot feature and trailers to all the Creature films.",1372896000,2,2049,4.592896174863388
5685215,5,B00C1AIMXE,"I have been a fan of the Universal Studios Monsters all of my life.  I have also been interested in 3D images and film since I was in elementary school.  It is no surprise that I remember when a local television station and a local convenience store (for the glasses) presented the second Gillman movie in 3D.  Like the moviegoers in the early 1950s, the television audience was required to sport the red and blue glasses, and hopefully forget that their eyes were viewing the film through two radically different colors. That situation has not only been eliminated with the Blu-ray remastering of this classic, but the sharpness and the 3D depth are quite stunning.

My expectations were high and I was not disappointed.  Other reviewers have noted that at times the images were not aligned.  I noticed this occurring very rarely with air bubbles and underwater vegetation.  The 3D lends itself to the typical early Hollywood ""suspense-building"" horror genre without becoming overly hammy or relying on objects being suddenly tossed at the viewer to get a cheap reaction.  The sound is not horrible, I believe it was simply what was available.

In Summary:  This 3D Blu-ray really captures a moment in time.  Although it can now be enjoyed in crisp B&W, I can still imagine all those 1950 teens screaming and / or cuddling while sporting their red and blue glasses.  If you are a fan of the Hollywood classics, you won't be disappointed.",1372377600,,1438,4.8244897959183675

The 3D effect is throughout the movie's entirety. The film is sharp and clear throughout, and the dimensionality is extraordinary! The creature, fish, swimmers, the sets, etc are all filmed in 3D greatness. The levels of black and white are wonderful. Got this as part of the multi-disc Universal monsters set, but looks like you can get the Creature by itself. GREAT job by Universal! Now, we need ""It Came From Outer Space"" done at the same high quality in 3D!!!",1371600000,,594,4.5607476635514015
5685218,5,B00C1AIMXE,"Today is the first time I've seen Creature from the Black Lagoon in 3-D since it was released in 3-D back in 1954. That was nearly sixty years ago and I was only 12 years old the first time I saw the film. I saw nearly every 3-D film released in the fifties and loved them all, but Creature was one of the most memorable. I read a lot of science fiction books when I was a kid, and I was convinced that during my lifetime I would own a giant flat-screen TV that would hang on the wall and show pictures in color and 3-D. Today, as I sit watching the 3-D Blu-ray disk of Creature on my flat-screen 60 inch plasma 3-D TV, I know I'm finally living in the future of my childhood dreams.

I'm not going to comment on the story or the acting in this film, because most people have seen Creature on TV and there is nothing new I can add to what has not already been said about the movie after nearly sixty years. Therefore, my review will focus on the technical aspects of the new Blu-ray 3-D disk. The first thing I want to point out that this is not the cheesy and inferior 3-D you watch with red/green cardboard glasses. This is real 3-D on a special 3-D Blu-ray disk that requires a 3-D TV and the special 3-D glasses that came with the TV. Except for being in black and white, the 3-D on this disk looks exactly like the best 3-D films shown in theaters today. A standard 2-D version of the film is included on the disk in case you don't have a 3-D TV, but you won't be able to see the film in 3-D unless you have a 3-D TV and use the glasses that came with the TV.

The restoration and the 1080p HD transfer is so good that the film looks like it was shot this year. The 3-D and the general picture quality are as good as what I recall seeing in the theater when the film was new. In a word, the quality of the 3-D image on this disk is excellent. Although Creature was not shot with anamorphic optics, it was not uncommon in the fifties to crop a standard 35mm image in the camera for widescreen projection. Creature was composed for a projection mask that's very close to the 16:9 aspect ratio of today's HDTV and the transfer on this DVD preserves the widescreen aspect ratio of the original theatrical presentation. It was unusual for 3-D films in the fifties to be photographed in black and white, but Creature was shot in black and white and the Blu-ray disk is true to the original. I'm glad they didn't colorize it, because color would spoil the creepy atmosphere of the lagoon. Some 3-D films also had multi-channel stereophonic sound in 1954, but Creature had a mono soundtrack and it has been faithfully preserved on the Blu-ray disk.

This film probably has some of the best stereoscopic photography of any 3-D movie that was made in the fifties or at any time since. The out of screen effects are particularly well done. Most 3-D films of that era relied on the actors to throw objects at the audience to show off the out of screen 3-D effect. While there are some throwing scenes in Creature, most out-of-screen effects in Creature are more subtle than that. The underwater stereo photography is particularly stunning. My living room was transformed into an aquarium, with fishes swimming all around me while bubbles floated inches before my eyes. In the above water scenes, the shimmering river seemed to flow out of the screen and into my living room. Even in scenes where actors are only talking, the solid roundness of human faces and bodies is noticeable. It's like looking at objects in a mirror. That level of realism seems to be missing in the 3-D movies made today, where close-ups of faces look flat.

The camera rig built by Universal was a superior piece of engineering. Most of the 3-D camera rigs in 1954 were so heavy and bulky that the camera could hardly move, but Universal made one which was not only waterproof, but small and light enough to be maneuvered underwater. The universal rig was also capable of extreme close-up 3-D photography. One scene in Creature shows an extreme close-up of the fingers of a human hand in 3-D. In contrast, Alfred Hitchcock had to have a giant finger and telephone built by the prop department to film the close-up of a hand dialing a phone in Dial M for Murder, because the Warner Bros. 3-D camera was incapable of taking extreme close-ups without causing eyestrain.

Finally, we get to the extras and commentary on the disk. There is an interesting Universal short on the disk, which covers the history of filming Creature and it's complete with behind the scene photos and interviews with actors who were in the film. Both stunt men who wore the creature suit are still alive and had interesting stories to tell. I wish they had included some information about that amazing Universal 3-D camera rig, but I realize that most people are not that interested in technical details about the camera.  The optional running commentary track is full of facts, but the rapid-fire delivery of the narrator sounded too much like the pitch man on a late night infomercial. The Blu-ray disk also features an optional sound track in French.  If you've never seen Creature in 3-D, then you've never seen it.  This disk is available at the bargain basement price of $14.96, so anyone interested in owning a classic 3-D film on Blu-ray 3-D would be crazy not to buy it.",1371340800,,5321,4.461459403905447
5685219,5,B00C1AIMXE,"This is part of the classic monsters set which I own. However this deserves a separate review because Universal really did a great job on mastering this in 3d.  This was shot in native 3d and that makes it a better looking film that some modern films that are shot in 2d and then slung out in 3d.  This 3d looks really clear and well done and the movie is a classic horror film. The monster is not unsympathetic either as it is defending it's territory against the encroaching humans.  The sequel was shot in 3d and hopefully they will put that out in 3d as well. the second sequel 'the creature walks among us' is in 2d. Sadly there are very few movies from the 1950's on 3d blu ray.  And universal could do a boxset of 50's 3d films as long as they do it right!.  ""dial m for murder' , the other 1950's 3d flick  out ; has many scenes where the 3d is ghosting and such. this has very few 3d problems like that. Maybe a scene or two. And that may depend on your tv. All in all this worth getting and 3d fans should love it as well as fans of classic sci fi and horror.",1371254400,,1069,4.018867924528302

If you watched ""20 Million Miles to Earth"" on blu-ray, which is an absolutely incredible restoration, then you will also enjoy this blu-ray as well. Highly recommended if you did not buy the Universal Monsters Box Set on blu-ray!",1371081600,,389,4.735294117647059
5685221,2,B00C1AIMXE,"The star rating does not apply to the movie itself.  It remains a solid '50's monster movie classic.  Unfortunately, the 3-D version audio cuts in and out frequently, to the point where I ended up switching to 2-D for the remainder of the movie, and it worked just fine.  No audio issues, and the picture couldn't be crisper or clearer.  And it looked terrific in 3-D too, with the exception of some occasionally shaky images. I'm not sure if I'll return it as damaged just yet, but I didn't experience any problems on the other two Blu-ray 3-D titles I purchased before this one, ""Top Gun,"" and ""Dial M for Murder,"" and verified my Blu-ray player has the most current firmware.",1370995200,,678,4.578512396694215
5685222,5,B00C1AIMXE,"Just received the 3D version of Creature from the Black Lagoon.  Let's keep this simple for those who enjoy these types of films.
Multiple kudos all around, from the widescreen presentation to the clarity of detail and sound.  But the real story is this: The 3D is fantastic. It is on par with AVATAR and/or LIFE OF PI.  Well worth the wait. Now, let's hope Universal does a similarly stellar job on REVENGE OF THE CREATURE, and IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE.
UPDATE: I saw this in the theater when in first came out in the early 50's (in 3D of course). I just wanted to add that this is not, under any circumstances, a ""MONSTER"" movie.  The only monsters in this trilogy are the human beings who hunt, agitate, harass, and brutalize an innocent creature that was merely standing his ground.  SPOILER ALERT:  This is the only horror trilogy in which the creature, fed up with humans interfering in his life and the ensuing torture he had to endure, actually commits suicide. How sad.",1370908800,2,978,4.56
5685223,5,B00C1AIMXE,"I have always been a huge fan of this film so when the 3d blu ray came out in the Box Set, I had to buy it.
Universal has taken a pristine print of the film, digitally cleaned it up and they have released it in it's original Non Anaglyph 3d format.
Yes this is the format it was shot in, the same one we use today, only cheap second run theaters got the red/blue red/ green prints.

But I had to right a review based on seeing a ton of modern 3D films and specials. I was Blown away by Creature, because it has the best 3D effects I have ever seen on the screen.
Yes, better than converted films, Pixars , and even better than Avatar. Instead of just adding depth, stuff looks as though it is literally coming out of the screen at the veiwer, which is something modern film makers should take to heart. Sure you vistas looks cool, sparks from explosions come at the camera, but have you shot a spear gun at the camera lens, had your monster's hand reach out of the screen? Nope. this is 3d at it's best.",1370304000,6,1003,4.091370558375634

8576156,3,B00C1AIMXE,"A remarkable fossil is discovered (and almost destroyed) in the Amazon, prompting an expedition to find the rest of the creature that is supposed to link land and marine animals. Dr. Carl Maia assembles a team to do this, including ichtyologist Dr. David Reed, Dr. Mark Williams the investor, and Kay Lawrence. When they arrive, Dr. Maia's assistants are killed by a living version of the fossil, who fixates on Kay while trying to kill all the other members of the party. Can the expedition trap the creature alive and escape with their lives?

The Creature from the Black Lagoon was never one of my favorite Universal monster movies, but I hadn't watched it since I was a child. However, looking at now, it's an enjoyable and complex film. First, there's the contrast between the main men in the film. David Reed and Mark Williams couldn't be more different. Reed focuses on scientific findings and breakthroughs while Williams is in it for money, fortune, and fame. In the modern ""remake"" The Shape of Water, he has a lot in common with Strickland while Reed has more in common with Hoffstetler, the Russian undercover agent that does what he can to make sure the unique creature lives. Unfortunately, much of this film is Reed and Williams posturing, arguing, competing, and swimming around, which gets old pretty quick.

Kay Lawrence is a much more interesting character than I remember. All of the iconic pictures of her are with the Gill-man carrying her and essentially being a damsel in distress for her boyfriend to save. While this is true of the last half of the film, the first half has her challenging men in authority and making some surprisingly modern life decisions. Kay works with Dr. Reed and although she isn't a doctor, she is educated and goes on the expedition as another scientist. When Maia says Reed doesn't look like an ichthyologist as an attractive, fit young man, Kay counters with a sassy remark. She and Reed have chosen not to marry, a controversial decision for the time, and seem to be financially independent of each other, although Reed currently makes more money. Kay doesn't sit quietly and let the men talk like other heroines of the time.  Reed supports her completely and never admonishes her. Their relationship looks healthy by todays standards and that's saying something since the same isn't true for many films today.

The Creature itself is fairly sympathetic, as most monsters are in the Universal canon. He is the last living member of a race of amphibious humans. The expedition is invading his home and he's defending it as he always has, giving rise to myths and rumors of a cursed lagoon. When he sees Kay, he develops feelings for her, swimming beneath her while she swims along the surface of the lagoon. This scene is beautiful and shows the humanity of the creature. I can see why Del Toro wanted to make a film where they end up together. Of course the Gill-man kills quite a few of the expeditions' lackeys, usually defending himself. The Gill-man design is as recognizable as Dracula or Frankenstien, which was created by Millicent Patrick and a team of designers. Unfortunately, George Westmore wasn't happy with sharing the limelight with anyone else when Patrick went on a press tour as The Beauty who Created the Beast, denying that she had anything to do with the creature design. He refused to work with her again despite her giving him credit during the tour, ending her career at Universal. She had worked there for years contributing to designs and it's such a shame that her career was ending by a jealous man.

The Creature from the Black Lagoon is an undeniably cheesy movie that has the marks of a Universal monster movie. The creature is sympathetic and the leading woman breaks social norms. The cheesy aspects had the theater laughing, especially when the Gill-man theme played so many times, an unfortunate studio decision, or when shots were obviously recycled several times. The film is impressive for the time, especially in regard to makeup. I liked it so much more than I expected. I had the wonderful opportunity to see it at the Egyptian Theater, along with a Q&A with Guillermo del Toro and Doug Jones and a double feature with The Shape of Water. Del Toro spoke at length how it imspired him as a child and how it informed not only The Shape of Water, but other of his films where monsters prove to have much more humanity than the people.",1525305600,,4427,4.759114583333333

8576161,5,B00C1AIMXE,I was around for the 3-D craze of 1953-54 and saw many of the films in the theater. I missed CREATURE and IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE and was glad to see them released on Blu-ray. Both films were from Universal and are by the same director. The 3-D is very effective in this film with the under water scenes standing out. This is NOT designed for red & blue glasses but requires a true TV/Player set-up designed for 3 Dimension. In my case I use a Epson projection system and it works amazingly well.,1521936000,,497,4.242105263157895
