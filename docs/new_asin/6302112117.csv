423435,5,6302112117,"Excellent. It doesn't get much better than this fact based story of General  George A. Custer's life and indian wars  of the 1870's and 1880's. Custer is legendary in western history for being  a dire enemy of  the american indian.  His disire to rid the american west of  it's  indigenous people proved to be his  undoing the battle of the little  bighorn area south of modern day Billings, MT.,ending a 10 year army  campaign to eliminate the indians from the last frontier. Gary Cole was  wonderful as the flamboyant cavalry officer tasked to rid the likes of  Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull and other war cheifs of the era.  Based on  Evan S. Connell's excellant  best-seller book. Co-starring Rosanna  Arquette as Lizzy Custer and Dean Stockwell as General Phillip Sheridan.  Rodney Grant plays Crazy Horse. In the  tradition of Dances With Wolves  and the  Last of The Mohicans this movie won't  disappoint if you like  westerns and history of the period.",922233600,2,959,4.826086956521739
423466,5,6302112117,I have not as yet watched this DVD on the topic but have played the 2 set VHS tapes many times.  Possibly the best movie on the Custer story.,1489190400,,141,3.8620689655172415
423467,5,6302112117,"The only available DVD release of this epic and sweeping portrayal of the end of the Plains Indian wars is welcome news to fans who have been frustrated at the lack of action in North America.  This Region 2 release from Spain does include the option to hear the original audio track, so good news for English-speakers and the original  audience for this 1991 American mini-series (only two parts, really, so more like a single long movie a la ""Gettysburg"").  If your DVD player can play multi-region discs, you're all set.  My only negative comments would be that the transfer is good but not pristine -- this looks to have been mastered from a second-generation source, not original negatives; perhaps a print made for European theatrical or broadcast use.  And I noticed that the audio and picture were not quite  in synch for a short segment near the end, beginning toward the end of the battle of Little Bighorn and extending into some final scenes.  These are not major flaws, and this set still represents an improvement over the VHS release overall.  Perhaps a genuine American studio edition can follow in due course now?

This film has been reviewed many times under its VHS listing so no need to go into elaborate detail here, but it is worth repeating what a stellar production this is:  from the brilliant cinematography to the superb costuming and the wonderfully lyrical soundtrack;  the script is dramatic and  intelligent;  and the acting usually first rate.  The parallel narratives of Libby Custer and Kate Bighead illustrate the opposing viewpoints of the white and red man and showcase the tragedies that resulted.  Custer is shown as a multidimensional character, true to history, neither golden hero nor raving madman,  but a gifted and flawed military leader who is far from the Indians' greatest enemy during this period.  His chief adversary, Crazy Horse, is a more elusive figure but as much as we know about him is presented with care and sympathy.  The Sioux who stand in the way of the US government's determination to ""tame"" the West and exploit its resources fully are the victims of a relentless expansionism and the climactic showdown with Custer and his 7th Cavalry on a hot summer day in the  barren Montana hills is truly their last stand as much as Custer's.  Few historical  battles have ever been better recreated onscreen than here -- all the troop movements are accurate and the action is intense and mesmerizing, filmed skillfully and evocatively.  Everything from the division of the 7th Cavalry into separate columns, Reno's heedless charge, Benteen's obstinacy, and what we *think* happened to Custer's command is memorably captured.  ""Son of the Morning Star"" remains one of the best Westerns ever made and a powerful depiction of one of history's most legendary events.",1488499200,5,2817,4.946808510638298

423473,4,6302112117,"I remember watching this long ago on the small screen and was very impressed. It seemed to capture nuances of the main characters, including the Sioux and Cheyenne. I'm sure artistic license was taken at times, but a very riveting final product, in particular the culminating battle at The Little Big Horn. A bit more editing (different camera angles of the same Sioux warriors, attempting to look like another group) may have given the battle a bit more depth, but how Custer and his men were overwhelmed, and the fear and chaos portrayed by the 7th cavalry gave one a feeling of what the experience may have been like for those involved.

I grabbed a video cassette while the prices were still reasonable, and viewed the movie via an lcd projector. It would be much improved if reissued on DVD/blue ray. The soundtrack, though a bit overwhelming at times is very good. Overall, perhaps the best rendition of Custer and all the major antagonists and protagonists one can find on film.",1476316800,3,985,4.760233918128655
423474,5,6302112117,"The story follows the career of 'George Armstrong Custer' (Gary Cole) after his heroics in the Civil War.
'George Armstrong Custer' was a fearless cavalier in battle who acted uponhis own instincs rarely taking the
advice of others.
He is assigned as Colonel with the 7th Calvary, his task, to control the native population, by transferring them if
possible to reservations, if they fail to comply they are seen as hostile.
Which often lead to 'Custer' leading his blue-coats as dawn approached attacking Indian Camps often killing both
woman and children in addition to the warriors.
The colonel was always supported in his chosen career by his loving wife 'Elizabeth'(Libby)(Rosanna Arquette) through
what was fast becoming turbulent times which saw his suspended and re-instated on two occasions by the Politicians
of the day
The Indians had many broken promises from the white government which lead to warriors such as 'Crazy Horse'
(Rodney A Grant) having little faith in those that stole their lands and wanted to change those that once roamed
free into the white way of life threatening hundreds of years of tradition and beliefs....'Crazy Horse' wanted only to
fight back.
When 'Custer' himself makes a vow to Sioux-Chief 'Sitting Bull' (Floyd Red-Crow Westerman) he is warned, break
your word, you and your blue-coats will die at our hands.
Of course, 'Custer' who had to follow directives from higher powers was unable to keep the promise he'd made..
which lead to the showdown at the Little-Big-Horn on 25th June 1876....'Custer' had split his force into three, one
led by 'Major Reno' (Michael Medeiros) the other by 'Captain Benteen' (David Strathairn) who in truth had many
recurring issues with 'Custer'....the decision to split his force to try and locate the Indian Encampment was to prove
fatal for 'George Armstrong Custer' and his troops....they were hugely out-nubered.
'Reno' had tried to come to their aid but was cut-off ad attacked, 'Benteen' who had warned 'Custer' not to split
the force did not come to their aid......Several tribes who had once fought each-other down the years had joined
forces ...a momentous victory......but in truth the war for the Indian-Nation was over.
This two part made for TV series was first aired in 1991.....The Story is told from both perspectives by 'Elizabeth
Custer' from her husbands side and for the Indian-Nation by 'Kate Bighead' who through a 10 year spell had seen
'Custer' on several occasions including attacking her village and indeed as a resident on a reservation (voiced by
Buffy Sainte-Marie) (who many will remember for her recording of 'Soldier Blue')
I have seen many films depicting events at the Little Big Horn, for me this is far and away the best version screened
to date.
Remember seeing the series when first aired, bought the VHS when released but was disappointed with the picture
quality, was pleased when i had the opportunity a few years back to buy it on DVD (pictured below) sadly this proved
to be of poor quality (though the story can be followed)
Hopefully one day, a quality release of the series will become available.",1474848000,2,3116,5.029013539651838

423553,5,6302112117,"This is the ONLY movie produced that follows the written accounts of the Custer story. I was surprised at some of the nuances they included in the movie like the rifles that didn't work for the soldiers. They had to manually pry out the spent shells from the chamber i.e. the rifles became one shot rifles. The Indians had newer, better rifles. The scenery was perfect, the staging was perfect. Not like the silly Hollywood version with Joseph Cotton or Robert Shaw version. (Of course Errol Flynn's movie is strictly Hollywood but I like Flynn so excuse that movie.)PBS put out a good video with some good insights into personalities and conflicts. This Video is well worth your time and money. It follows the book and is truly enjoyable.

Anyone in KU see Comanche, a survivor of the Custer conflict? I remember viewing this horse when I attended the University. He lived a kings life after the battle  I think at Ft. Riley till his death.",1423180800,3,941,4.662650602409639

423580,5,6302112117,"Whether ostracized and satirized (a la LITTLE BIG MAN) or romanticized (THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON), the last military engagement of U.S. Army Colonel George Armstrong Custer, and what is essentially the turning point in the American Indian Wars, has rarely been accurately portrayed on film. Until now.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-The-Morning-Star-VHS/dp/6302112117/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of The Morning Star [VHS</a>] is one of the most balanced and authentic portrayals of The Battle of the Little Big Horn. Based on Evan S. Connell's non-fiction&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-the-Morning-Star-Custer-and-the-Little-Bighorn/dp/0865475105/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of the Morning Star: Custer and the Little Bighorn</a>, SOMS was one of the last dramas of the TV miniseries era.  And it used that platform to maximum effect, presenting not only a very close approximation the battle itself but chronicling the turbulent social and political events that led to it.

The miniseries largely tries to present a balanced view of Colonel George Armstrong Custer (an American historical figure who has gone through several rounds of either being hailed a national hero or scorned as a genocidal egomaniac). Told told through the perspective of Custer's wife Libby and a Sioux villager named Kate Bighead, Custer is pretty much presented as a complex human being. His frustration with Washington's bureaucratic expediency and his relegation to austere frontier postings leads him to undertake drastic measures to ensure some degree of personal and professional success.

Actor Gary Cole plays Custer as more of an opportunist. He attains national celebrity by fighting The South in the Civil War. Then, he turns the same energy and recklessness towards the next enemy: Native Americans. SOMS shows Custer as an exacting taskmaster to the men under his frontier command, yet also as a man who doesn't hold himself to the same standards (as he deserts to return to his sick wife, for example). Custer takes a curious interest in the Native American lifestyle, even fathering a child by a Native American woman and outing their mistreatment by the Grant Administration on the reservations. Yet, he still viciously enforces the national campaign of Manifest Destiny that removes them from their land. And, Custer turns on several key political and military allies, making him disliked by not just Native Americans but by white power brokers.

Since SOMS was a contemporary of DANCES WITH WOLVES it also authentically  presents the life of Sioux warrior Crazy Horse and some of the polemics within the often divided Sioux Tribes. It also dares to show how some Native Americans collaborated with Custer (serving as Army scouts, for example), thus helping to alleviate the prelapsarian myth that the demise of the Native American culture can be totally blamed on whites. This is a relatively small segment of the miniseries, but a nice perspective of the Sioux.

As for purely military depictions, the miniseries is very precise. The 7th Cavalry is shown wearing a variety of fatigues, not just the stereotypical navy blues. Custer himself is not adorn in the inaccurate buckskin wear of many paintings of the event. But instead, he wears mostly a navy officer's shirt, red scarf, a slouch hat, and fringed white trousers into battle. The Sioux use not just bows and arrows, but repeating rifles and handguns. And though recent archaeological digs of The Little Big Horn site show a much less concentrated ""last stand"" point, the 1990's miniseries still captures the frenetic fight and flight of soldiers faced with an overwhelming, unified Sioux force.

SOMS is not only the best depiction of The Battle of the Little Big Horn, but it is one of the best examinations of the often convoluted political decision making on both sides that leads to war. So when Custer finally tries to capture the Sioux encampment and the Sioux spare no pity in annihilating his command, the viewer fully understands why it occurred.",1408924800,,4124,5.515822784810126

The film covers 1866 (creation of 7th Cavalry by congress) to 1877 (Crazy Horse being killed resisting arrest at Fort Robinson). The film literally shows the changes in U.S. Cavalry uniforms, weapons, and equipment during that time. The beginning of the film has soldiers training with 1865 Spencer carbines, pecussion revolvers, and rawhide covered 1859 McClellan saddles. They are also in left over Civil War uniforms, as is correct. Later in the film they show them with 1873 Springfield carbines, 1873 Colt revolvers, and leather covered 1872/1874 McClellan saddles. They are also wearing Pattern 1872/1874 uniforms.

They literally used two seperate sets of props for this film. Someone really took their time and did a good job on that end of it.

423647,3,6302112117,"One would believe that this was a great movie about Gen. George Custer, if one didn't know the history of the battle. Undoubtedly, this movie was outstanding in terms of its directing, acting, and in its scope. Being a military historian and a combat veteran, I was very disappointed in many of the depictions of the characters. Let's face it, from all accounts that I have read including the transcripts of Maj. Marcus Reno's court martial, Capt. Frederick Benteen was the one who saved what was left of the 7th Calvary. He was one of the few US Army officers there that performed in a heroic manner. Without his unfaltering leadership, the whole regiment would been wiped out. Of course, Benteen hated Custer, because he knew the difference between a blow-hard and a real commander. Moreover, neither Benteen or Reno were responsible for Custer's demise under the circumstances that Custer's incomprehensible and irresponsible orders had put them. And yet, the movie accuses them of such, which was disproven at Reno's court martial.

Actually, Custer was a third rate officer and a fourth rate commander, whose undeserving reputation as a great commander has been kept alive by those who have ignored the Indians version of the battle. Any commander that would divide his force against a superior force is begging to be defeated. Before and during the battle, Custer divided his forces on four different occasions, while knowing full well that he faced a far superior force. His men hated him, his officers hated him, and his own president hated him. He represented the same attributes that our military forces exhibited during the Vietnam War, the arrogance of ignorance. However, much like Hollywood's other mislead efforts into history, it's a great movie so long as one doesn't care about the actual facts.",1362873600,2,1813,5.023255813953488

423689,5,6302112117,"This is incredible! Originally broadcast on tv in two parts, it is the most historically accurate Custer movie yet. And it's told from both sides - the white and the Lakota. Gary Cole is great as Custer. The entire movie is superbly cast, except for Rosanna Arquette as Mrs. Custer. Mrs. Custer was a beautiful woman with a sparkle in her eye - and was fun! I found Ms. Arquette to be very thin and colorless. But the others - Tom Custer! The not-so-brave Reno. David Straithairn's performance as Captain Benteen! Every character I watched was outstanding, which makes me so wonder why Arquette was cast as Libby Custer.

Such attention was given to historical detail. One scene features the soldiers at Fort Lincoln having a dance on a wooden platform. The song played sounds very much like one that Custer's real band played. Custer's real voice was supposedly a little high and maybe nasal a bit, and he stuttered if excited. He did grow up near the WV line in Ohio, when he wasn't in Monroe, MI, so maybe he had a little Southern accent. But I don't know where they'd find a macho actor like Gary Cole that would have that kind of a voice, or even want to do that type of voice.

An action-filled, excellent production that students can watch and learn - and one that you probably would find yourself watching with them - again, and again and again ...",1317945600,9,1356,4.530612244897959
423690,5,6302112117,"The most accurate film done about that fateful day at The Little Big Horn and the events which lead up to it. Custer was no saint like the Flynn movie They Died with their Boots On by far, but he was also not remotely the villian Hollywood made him out to be since the fanciful fiction of the film Little Big Man. As far as what we know about the actual battle, it is about as accurate as historical assumptions can conclude. Take a film like Dances With Wolves, and Son of the Morning Star is far more accurate. For instance, the Lakota Sioux were the aggressors and not the Pawnee. The Sioux were imperialists by nature, but so is America in our actions one could argue. It shows the strife the Northern Plains tribes had to endurewith there very world crumbling around them and the patriotic characer which was Crazy Horse. It does seem to shelter President Grant and even Sitting Bull to an extent of their short comings (and if you read books on the subject, you would know what I mean) but this allows the viewer to concentrate on a difficult matter of two cultures clashing without throwing in two many variables. One can see the pain in both sides of the events and how they unfolded from beginning to end. It is a complete joke that this is not on DVD. Highly endorse this film to anyone with interest in the Plains Wars...they even give proper respect and insight into the Crow and Ree scouts who were also part of the 7th calvary.

Gary Cole, who played Custer, was excellent in showing the various sides of Custer ranging from brashness early on, to mild indecision when it came to the actual attack on the Sioux village. The movie also covers Major Reno's charge along with Captain Benteens activities. The Indian side is also told in the movie.

423696,4,6302112117,"Having seen many many movies dealing with Custer, the 7th Cavalry, the Native Americans and the Little Big Horn battle.  I'm generally puzzled as to the motivation behind the production.  Usually there is some political statement being made that has little to nothing to do with actual history or the participants (ie Little Big Man, the movie not the book was really about VietNam).  I see no motivation here except to make a movie.  My favorite 'old' feature is They Died With Their Boots On.  Lots of fun to watch but light on facts. It is a good example of don't get your history from a movie.

Son of the Morning Star is the best movie on the post war life of George Custer made to date.  It is the only one I've seen where one learns that he had brothers, sisters and nephews (very probably nieces too).  There were other participants though that were left out (Capt. James Calhoun, Custer's brother-in-law and Capt. Miles Keogh, a member of Custer's inner circle, both important and both killed with Custer), such is Hollywood.  The movie is mostly conjecture but has liberal amounts of fact and old rumors (Reno was drunk [un-coroberated by his fellow combatants] and George fathered an indian child [highly unlikely]).  The acting is decent, it looks good and the props and costumes are right.

While by no means perfect, it is entertaining and worth the several hours it consumes.  If you're really looking for history, read a book.",1294704000,3,1442,4.724

Tom Custer didn't have a Henry or Winchester repeating rifle, although Armstrong had a rolling block Winchester single shot sporting rifle. Everybody else carried single shot calvary versions of the trap door Springfields with the exception of two long range rifles that Reno's Company M had (Sgt. Ryan had a Sharps with a scope, and Capt. French had a 10"" longer infantry version of the trap door Springfield).  Most of the bodies on the hill and ridge were stripped naked and extremely mutilated, with Tom Custer head smashed to the thickness of a man's hand. Keogh's body was left unmolested. The Sioux and Cheyenne took 1/2 hour or longer creeping up from the village and fought mostly from protected gullies until the critical charges against Yates, then Keogh and finally Custer.",1278720000,12,908,4.973684210526316
423741,3,6302112117,"George Armstrong Custer was as controversial in life as he was in death, and more than 100 years later remains so. Each generation rediscovers him and then reinvents him to suit their sociopolitical mores. Thus he has appeared in many guises - the hero (Francis Ford in ""Custer's Last Fight"" in 1912), the swashbuckler (Errol Flynn in ""They Died with Their Boots On"" in 1941), the Indian sympathizer (Robert Shaw in ""Custer of the West"" in 1967), and the villain (Richard Mulligan in ""Little Big Man"" in 1970). Of all his film treatments, Gary Cole's portrayal in the 3 hour made-for-TV film ""Son of the Morning Star"" (1991) is probably the most balanced.

The film traces the steps of Custer and Crazy Horse (Rodney Grant) leading up to the Little Big Horn, and narration is done by Custer's wife (Rosanna Arquette) and by an Indian (Buffy Sainte-Marie's voice). The film is based on the 1984 critically acclaimed best-selling book of the same name by Evan Connell.

The role of Custer was originally intended for Kevin Costner but he was busy making ""Dances with Wolves"" so the versatile Cole took over. Cole has had a very active career in TV - Vice-President Russell in ""The West Wing"" (1999-2006), Harvey Birdman in ""Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law"" (2206-7), Wayne Davis on ""Desperate Housewives"" (2008), Andy Klein on ""Entourage"" (2008-9), Mike Brady on ""Family Guy"" (2000-2010), forensics expert in ""The Good Wife"" (2010), etc. His film career has been more limited, including a few Brady Bunch spoofs and supporting roles in comedies like ""Dodgeball"" (2004), ""Talladega Nights"" (2006) and ""Pineapple Express"" (2008).

Rosanna Arquette is best known for her Emmy nominated role in the TV movie ""The Executioner's Song"" (1982) and her BAFTA winning performance in ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" (1985). She's the granddaughter of raucous comedian Cliff Arquette who lit up the Jack Paar Tonight Show from 1958 to 1962 as ""Charley  Weaver"", and the subject of the Toto Top 10 hit "" Rosanna"", a distinction she earned because she was dating one of the band members.

Dean Stockwell makes a few brief appearances as General Phil Sheridan. Stockwell began acting as a child in the 40s and has been in more than 100 films, earning 4 Emmy nominations for ""Quantum Leap"" (1990-3), an Oscar nomination for ""Married to the Mob"" (1988) and winning twice as Best Ac tor at Cannes (""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" in 1962 and ""Compulsion"" in 1959). Stockwell always gives a good performance, but I liked him best in Dune (1984) as the villainous Dr. Huey.

David Strathaim appears as Captain Benteen.  Strathaim is best known for his outstanding performance as Edward R Murrow in ""Good Night and Good Luck"" (2005), and the fact that he didn't win an Oscar is a reflection on the academy, not the actor. He's also given great performances in ""LA Confidential"" (1997) and ""City of Hope"" (1991). He's a favorite of director John Sayles who cast him in several films including ""Brother from Another Planet"" (1984), ""Matewan"" (1987) and ""Eight Men Out"" (1988).

The TV film won 4 Emmys (Costuming, Makeup, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing) and was nominated for a fifth (Hairstyling). In 1991 the major Emmy nominated miniseries were ""The Josephine Baker Story"", ""Leona Helmsley: Queen of Mean"", and ""Sarah Plain and Tall"". At 3+ hours it's a little long, and often the action is slow to develop. The film straddles the line between drama and docudrama, and while the domestic scenes are interesting, fans of westerns or actions films may find them boring. They do help to paint a full picture of the times, and certainly give us an aspect of Custer's life that hither fore has not been covered. It's interesting to note that following his death, Custer's wife wrote several books about him and their life together, so there was plenty of material available.

If the direction is not exactly taut, the photography is beautiful and the music is good. The use of alternative narrations to describe the same event is brilliant, and I wish it were used more often. There is probably a good 100 minute film here, but you'll have to endure187 minutes to watch it.",1278720000,7,4143,4.898716119828816

In one story, Gen Custer and his cavalry visited the Fort before the Big Horn campaign.

423749,5,6302112117,"As a writer of historical pieces concerning American History, I found that this made for television film, ""Son of The Morning Star"" to be about the best you're going to find on the life and times of Lt Col George A. Custer.

Nothing's perfect of course, as if you're looking for absolute accuracy concerning an event that happened over 140 years ago, well good luck, but specifically as the treatment of Custer in this film and particularly as they present the battle at the Little Bighorn River, well, I found it to be probably as historically accurate as anyone could hope for.

I have a personal connection with this particular event, as my Grandmother was friends with Elizabeth Custer during her later years and I have a photograph of my Grandmother and my father (when he was 17 years old), sitting on their front porch (1928 in Missouri) with Elizabeth Custer.

I personally have been to the Little Bighorn Battle Field National Monument on numerous occasions and have park permission to walk out onto the areas normally off-limits to the general public (I have proof of a distance relative who died on Calhoun Hill). How the actual battle played out, has always been a point of controversy, but having spent so much time there, walking and observing, as well as having many long conversations with several local individuals (Native Americans), I have my own opinion as to what happened there. Considering that Native Americans have continued the concept of recording their history orally, my conversations with one gentleman, who is a blood descendant of the Oglala war Chief ""Little Big Man"", who was riding beside Crazy Horse during the battle, I have a slightly different perspective than most on what actually occurred over those 2 days (June 25-26, 1876). Add to this the two year (1984-1985) archaeological dig, following the grass fire which uncovered the entire area surrounding ""Last Stand"" and ""Calhoun Hill"", we now have a far more accurate idea of how the battle itself played out.

Because it is known, who had what rifles or pistols and what their calibers were, the two year (84-85) study revealed some rather startling results. At the position where Lt Colonel Custer fell, they only found 17 cartridges associated to the 7th Calvary, including 4 of the 17 cartridges having come from a .32 caliber pistol. The ""only"" person in the 7th Cal who had a .32 caliber weapon was Colonel Custer himself (the Army pistol carried by members of the 7th was either a standard issue 1861 Colt Army .38 or the 1875 Army Colt single action .41). Colonel Custer carried a custom pair of 1851 Navy Colts in .32 caliber (with a centerfire conversion). The remaining 13 cartridges found were 45-70 caliber, which was solely used by the 1870 Springfield single-shot Carbine used by the US Army at the time. Within a 100 foot radius of where Custer fell, just over 2,100 cartridges were found, all in 44-40 caliber. 44-40 is consistant with the 1861 Henry repeating rifle, the 1866 Winchester, and the 1873 Winchesters the Indians were armed with.

The administrators of the National Monument (Crow Nation), currently believe Lt Col Custer was probably one of the first to die at Last Stand Hill. Based on the oral history of the Indians directly in the fighting, at Last Stand and Calhoun Hills, as several have stated the fighting there lasted ""as long as it takes a man to eat his lunch"".

Considering the low number of cartridges (Army) found at the battle site, this would be consistant with the oral history of Little Big Man, who stated he, Crazy Horse, and Roman Nose (with about 30 more in their hunting party) had just returned from a hunt to the east, when they rode up and over Last Stand Hill and ran directly into Lt Col Custer and his dismounted men firing on a small group of Indians coming up the hill from the west. It is also known now, because of the 84-85 dig, that those Indians coming up the hill on foot, were firing with 1861 Henrys, this was because they also found more than two dozen long brass tubes in the dirt. These long tubes held up to 15 44-40 rounds and were used as ""speed"" loaders, but they ONLY worked with Henry rifles, as '66 & '73 Winchesters are loaded through a side plate, while the Henrys loaded by sliding a thumbtab and twisting the outer barrel sleeve, then you would just drop rounds directly into the magazine.

The full length ""white"" buckskin outfit, worn by Lt Colonel Custer that day, can be seen at the Little Bighorn Battlefield museum, next to the cemetery.

I can tell you that if you have ""any"" interest in American History and particularly the history of 19th Century Indian Wars, well I highly recommend this VHS tape of ""Son of The Morning Star"" and like many here, I too wish it would become available in DVD format.",1246579200,,4784,4.707287933094385

This depiction smashes the old tale of the plains-indians as rutherless savages, but as a mobile civilization trying (unsuccessfully) to stay one step ahead of the white man's movement west. Gary Cole plays an outstanding George Armstrong Custer while unfortunately, the supporting cast representing the other pro-anti Custer elements are portrayed as thumb nails devoid of development or an understanding why they felt the way they did towards Custer.

none of us were there when it happened. Many of us think we know the
truth more than others because we are historians, teachers or history
buffs. We can research it to death as I have throughout my life and
read all the books. (see ""Where Custer Fell"" by James S. Brust). But we
can't go back in time to 1876 and watch it unfold before our eyes and
see what really transpired. So if you think Custer was a hero or idiot
or goat during the LBH battle...well no one knows for sure. Reno and
Benteen did not know what wrong either and they WERE there.

One story said that the Last Stand battle itself took about as much
time as it takes for someone to eat lunch.

""Son of the Morning Star"" is the best movie version yet of the battle.
At least it looks like the Greasy Grass plains of Montana and not in
the desert area of Monument Valley!!! Custer was not fighting southwest
Indians like the Apaches either (see earlier film versions) So at least
this movies attempts to be accurate in some ways.

423823,5,6302112117,"I wholeheartedly concur with the previous reviewer. This is the most historically accurate film version of the events leading up to the battle of the Little Big Horn and the battle itself. The film makers went to allot of trouble to portray all parties in a fair way. The story is more or less 'narrated' by both Custers wife and a Cheyenne woman who had survived the Sand Creek massecre and had witnessed Custers demise on 25 June 1876. This is beautifully done in that one gets the subjective views of both sides of the conflict. Ultimately the sympathy the viewer experiences, quite correctly, lies with the Indians. Although the film is based on the story of Custer (his Crow name 'son of the morning star'), it goes way beyond this. It is the story of the Lakota and Cheyenne people at the very end of their independance. It accurately portrays the politics behind the US government's deveopment of 'indian policy'. A number of events involving Grant, Red Cloud, Sitting Bull and Custer give the viewer historical insight into why things turned out the way they did. The conflict between Custer and his officers whilst on expedition is also portrayed as it may very well have been. I always appreciate it when people speak in their native language. This is well done in terms of the appropriate use of the Lakota and Cheyenne languages. There is no over dramatization of events; this a serious film.

423830,5,6302112117,"General George Armstrong Custer and his famous ""Last Stand"" at the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876 in Montana has proven to be not only one of the most controversial events in American history, but has been the inspiration for countless books and films and continues to fascinate people today.
""Son of the Morning Star"" is the 1991 made-for-cable film starring Gary Cole as the arrogant and flamboyant General Custer, fresh from his victories during the Civil War and now sent West to subdue the Plains Indians in the bid for western expansion by a growing United States. Custer is idolized by the American public, but often despised by his own men, particularly Captain Will Benteen, who sees Custer as a egotistical fop more concerned with his own glory than with his own mens' lives.
Custer and the 7th Cavalry are sent west to force the Cheyenne and Lakota Sioux onto reservations, thus opening up their homelands to prospectors and settlement. The Indians however, fight back. Following his bloody ""victory"" at the Wachita River and numerous other exploits, Custer is sent by President Grant to pacifiy the Black Hills Region of the Dakotas, and to crush the growing Indian resistance there. This proves to be his last campaign, leading to his reckless bid for glory and fame at the Little Big Horn where thousands of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors lead by Crazy Horse annihilate Custer and the 7th Cavalry.
Though a great victory for the Indians, as so many times in the past, even this stunning achievement only strengthens the Army's resolve and would lead to the end of the Indians way of life. Custer has been romanticized as an American hero by some and decried as a murdering villain by others. The man and the battle continue to haunt us and this excellent retelling of a momentous event in the history of the west is well done and well worth watching.",1045180800,17,1876,4.775384615384615

Gary Cole looked more suitable to be riding a Harley, zipping around with his mouth agape. Arquette was her usual air-headed self, and did a grave injustice to Libby Custer's memory. Some of the supporting cast was wooden as is the case in some of these biopics, as they seem to be just filling the space of real characters and are usually portrayed with not much personality of their own. As all Custer historians know, everything concerning the movements of the five troops with Custer is purely speculative. After passing
 the bluffs no one saw them alive and their movements have been the subject of hot debate for many years.  The Hollywood version portrayed here is as good as any, and the terrain should look familiar to anyone who has spent time at the Battlefield, as it was filmed a short distance away, showing that rolling, treeless terrain that is easily recognized. Thumbs down to the costume designer who came up with the supposedly buckskin outfit Cole wore. It looked like the bleach bottle got loose in the wash. in truth the troopers were dirty, grimy, and on a day that had temperatures in the 90's, Custer would surely have not been zipping around in a full, well tailored buckskin outfit.",1018569600,8,1346,4.690677966101695

  The film portrays George Custer soon after the American Civil War was over and Custer is ordered to report to the central plains to help maintain the peace between the white immigrants and the various Indian tribes.
  I especially liked the sets of this film which looked more authentic then previous films concerning the Little BigHorn battle. Fort Lincoln located just out of Bismark, North Dakota was Custer's home base. The Fort Lincoln setlooked very similar to the real thing. Another major asset to the film  is the Indian perspective to the film. It shows their side and the casting was excellent.
  One critical thought is that the part played by Tom O'Brian playing Charlie Reynolds was called by another name in the film. This could have been easily corrected to  maintain historical accuracy. Charlie Reynolds was a major figure in the last Custer Campaign.

7821112,3,6302112117,"RELEASED TO TV IN EARLY 1991 and directed by Mike Robe, ""Son of the Morning Star"" chronicles the story of George Armstrong Custer (Gary Cole) after the Civil War and to his death at Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876. The story is narrated from the different perspectives of two women: Custers wife (Rosanna Arquette) and a Cheyenne woman, Kate Bighead (Buffy Sainte-Marie/ Kimberly Guerrero).

This was originally shown in two parts on TV 2.5 months after the theatrical release of 1990s Dances with Wolves. Kevin Costner, the star of Dances, was even the first choice to play Custer, but he opted for the superior project.

Speaking of Dances with Wolves, Son of the Morning Star is very similar in tone, as well as other realistic Westerns of the general era, like Conagher (1991). But, despite the gushing of fans, it aint no Dances with Wolves. Its just nowhere near as absorbing; and is more akin to semi-tedious history lessons like Gettysburg (1993) and Geronimo: An American Legend (1993). If the creators wouldve cut out at least an hour of material it wouldve made for a more compelling watch, but they HAD to fill out two 2 hour spots (with commercials) to make it a 2-part mini-series.

Still, its a fairly interesting history lesson and superior to absurd Westerns that tackle the same subject, like Custer of the West (1967). Everything leads up to the Battle of Little Bighorn in the last quarter of the movie and its worth the wait. At a certain point you can see on Custers face the horror that there were just too many fired-up Indians and he & his men weren't going to make it out alive. Its as if he was thinking: What the **** did I get us into? The humbled man was 36 years-old.

THE MOVIE RUNS 3 hours 7 minutes and was shot on private property near the Little Bighorn National Monument in Montana close to Billings, where a fort was built for $200,000, and South Dakota at Buffalo Gap and Badlands National Park. ADDITIONAL MAIN CHARACTERS: Crazy Horse (Rodney A. Grant), Capt. Benteen (David Strathairn), Ulysses S. Grant (Stanley Anderson), Gen. Sherman (George Dickerson) and Gen. Philip Sheridan (Dean Stockwell). WRITERS: Evan S. Connell (book) and Melissa Mathison (teleplay).
