1219835,3,B00000IBMB,"We were all sitting around at a party trying to remember what movie the scene of a man pouring a bowl of cereal over a kid's head came out of.  ""Sitting Pretty"" turned out to be the answer and, since I'd never even heard of it, I got a copy.  It was fun, if a tad dated (even though it was probably very forward thinking at the time it was made).  What happens when a man tries to take on the role of nanny back in pre-sexual revolution

America?  Pleasant, if not brilliant, comedy.",1132790400,2,483,4.095744680851064
1219836,4,B00000IBMB,"Sitting Pretty is the first Mr. Belvedere movie.  Robert Young (Father Knows Best) and  Maureen O'Hara (Miracle On 34th Street, The Quuiet Man), typical American parents living in the typical community of Hummingbird Hill, need a babysitter who can handle their three irrepressible boys.  Their advertisement is answered by professional genius Lynn Belvedere, played perfectly by Clifton Webb.

Webb had previously starred in mysteries like Laura and The Dark Corner, but really left his mark with roles like this one, the fathers in Cheaper By The Dozen and The Titanic, and John Philip Souza in Stars And Stripes Forever.  It's primarily his talent - you'll easily beleive he's a jack of all trades from babysitter to beekeeper to novelist to genius -  that makes Sitting Pretty and other Belvedere movies still worth watching today, though of course he couldn't carry the movie alone without the tremendous support of great actors like O'Hara and Young, and Richard Haydn (Ball of Fire, Five Weeks In A Balloon) as a snoopy gossiping neighbor. It's the latter's activities that cause the most trouble and humor, raising questions of impropriety about Belvedere's residence in the young couples home.",1126569600,3,1202,5.2020725388601035
1219837,5,B00000IBMB,"This movie is nice for the whole family, very funny and laughable about a family that needs a babysitter. Then the fun begins. Clifton Webb is delightful as the babysitter, and seems to know alot about children and everything. Maureen O'Hara & Robert Young are the parents, who actually need help, their are many other actors and actresses who help make this a fun and enjoyable picture. Our children and grandchildren loved this picture, it shows in my era there were funny pictures of the 40's. Shirley Frye",1123804800,,509,4.795454545454546
1219838,5,B00000IBMB,"This is one really good picture-it should be on DVD hope it will

in today's world...",1110844800,2,214,4.461538461538462
1219839,5,B00000IBMB,"It is a farce/comedy. The story has mystery, romance and humor. What it lacks is the harshness of the movies today. A brief escape to a sweeter time. I love looking at the decor their home. Very enjoyable.",1053907200,45,205,4.421052631578948
1219840,2,B00000IBMB,"The jack of all trades and self-proclaimed genius Mr. Belvedere is appealing enough, but can a stiff man with admitted contempt for children be truly loveable?  None of his unconventional methods of child discipline would account for the doting behavior of the three boys, and that's mainly why I can't recommend this movie.  Every character has their appeal, but as a group, it's difficult to believe they interact as well as they do.  And the problems that do crop up are equally unbelievable: How could Robert Young be jealous of a rigid fop like Mr. Belvedere?  The fantasy of an uber-nanny appearing mysteriously to enrich our lives and control our household is worthy of a suburban comedy like this, but the story here just doesn't use the possibly delightful premise as well as it could.  The ending is much too pat without the absurdity that a Preston Sturges would make of it (like the dual marriage at the end of Palm Beach Story).",986860800,3,941,4.748466257668712
1219841,5,B00000IBMB,this is a wonderfully funny and entertaining movie.clifton webb is great  as mr. belvedere. robert young and maureen o'hara were also terrific as the  parents of the 3 boys. also if someone knows where i can get the 2 sequels  on video  mr. belvedere goes to college mr. belvedere rings the bell i  would appreciate it very much.,968803200,31,329,4.603448275862069
1219842,5,B00000IBMB,"This is not a particularly well-known movie any more, but it is a great film worth buying and enjoying. Clifton Webb plays the prissy and effeminate Mr. Belvedere, a no-nonsense butler who moves into Robert Young  and Maureen O'Hara's home to watch their bratty sons. Webb immediately  instills discipline into the home and the boys end up adoring him, even if  he is a martinet. The hilarious scenes he finds himself in...  delicious!
Clifton Webb's comedic timing is underrated and the plot  twists and ancillary characters will entertain and delight you throughout.  This is one of the best sleepers from the 1940's and will have you laughing  from beginning to end.",964224000,97,669,4.972972972972973
1219843,4,B00000IBMB,"Clifton Webb launched his famous ""Mr. Belvedere"" character in this film, which, in turn, launched a highly successful series of movies in the early 50's and a semi-successful sitcom in the early 90's. Webb's  Belvedere is uptight, prissy, unflappable, and decidedly unamused in even  the most farsical situations which, of course, adds to the fun. One can  imagine Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock recreating the role. It's an early look  at the new-fangled (at that time)concept of baby sitting, brought about by  women's new freedom to explore options outside the home. Richard Hyden (the  voice of the Caterpillar in Disney's ""Alice in Wonderland"") and  Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch of the West in the ""Wizard of  Oz"") are wonderful in supporting roles as nosy neighbors.",923961600,,775,5.144

1219985,5,B00000IBMB,"This movie is absolutely hilarious, especially if you like witty dialog. Clifton Webb delivers the lines perfectly, and the lines throughout the movie are truly laugh out loud funny. His name is Lynn Belvedere who applies for a babysitting job through the news paper and is hired by Maureen O'Hara who thinks he is a woman. When he arrives at her door she is dumbfounded and the hilarity begins. As he straightens up the bratty kids he is also writing a novel about all the goings on in the small town exposing all the hush hush nonsense. Robert Young and Maureen O'Hara are great as the parents and their kids are pretty darn funny too. Mr. Belvedere claims he is a genius and there doesn't seem to be anything he doesn't know about and has literally done everything and seems to be great at it. I could go on and on and tell you everything about the movie but honestly it's a lot more fun to just watch and not have a clue what's coming next, because this movie is funny from the beginning to the end, and you can watch it often because it is so witty.

1220036,5,B00000IBMB,"Sitting Pretty is a comedy about suburban couple Tacey and Harry King (Maureen OHara, Robert Young), who need a babysitter for their three sons. Tacey puts an ad in the newspaper for a live-in babysitter and gets a reply from Lynn Belvedere. Tacey arranges for an interview at the house and is surprised to see that Lynn Belvedere (Clifton Webb) is a man  not just any man, but an eccentric genius with wide experience in various fields. Mr. Belvedere manages to bring calm to the household and works wonders with the children. Things go awry, however, when local gossip Clarence Appleton (Richard Haydn) spreads rumors that Belvedere and Tacey are carrying on an affair.

A show business adage is that children and animals will always upstage an actor. Nothing could be further from that in Sitting Pretty. Mr. Webb handily steals every scene hes in with a supercilious, no-nonsense attitude that undermines popular thinking on child rearing. Hes the textbook curmudgeon, fully expecting the boys to adhere to his rules, regulations, and time schedules. Of course, the laughs come from the frequent clashes between his theories and actual practice. Eventually, Mr. Belvedere shows that he doesnt have the cold heart his demeanor suggests.

By the time he made this picture, Webb was a veteran of show business. He worked as a professional ballroom dancer, appeared in several operettas, starred on Broadway, made short films for the Vitaphone Corporation, and returned to movies in 1944s Laura, for which he received an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor. He starred as John Philip Sousa in Stars and Stripes Forever (1952) and appeared in The Razors Edge, Three Coins in the Fountain, Womans World, and The Man Who Never Was. He was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for Sitting Pretty.

There are no bonus features on the unrated DVD release.",1482710400,,1859,5.006472491909385

1220230,4,B00000IBMB,"This is the 1948 black and white comedy that showed that brittle Clifton Webb could be an excellent comic actor, and established him as the original Mr. Belvedere in this film and two sequels as well as setting him up for other light roles in films like Cheaper By the Dozen and Mr. Scoutmaster. Perfectly cast as the sophisticated, acid-tongued Waldo Lydecker in Laura, Webb was the least likely person one would hire as a babysitter, hence the comedy. He is more than amply supported by Robert Young and Maureen O'Hara as the King's, a young couple with two children who pleasantly seem to still have a lot of romance in their marriage; and Richard Haydn as the biggest twit of a  neighbor imaginable.

Complications ensue when Tacey King (O'Hara) places an ad for a babysitter after several failures and hires ""Lynn Belvedere"" sight unseen thinking lynn is a woman only to find arrogant, know-it-all self-described ""genius"" Mr. Belvedere at her door. He soon takes control of the household and sets things in order, winning the respect of the King's two boys as well as Mr. and Mrs. King themselves. But everything is not sunshine and flowers on Honeysuckle Hill, as neighbors snoop and gossip and outlandish fantasies rule the day.

Most people seem to absolutely love this film, but even though I'm a big Clifton Webb fan I just really like it. The reason is that I have difficulty accepting part of the premise, that the two boys totally take to Mr. Belvedere and completely change their formerly disruptive ways for him. Belvedere is played as pompous and stern, though just to the nice side of those qualities. He's almost as insufferable as Monty Wooly's Sheridan Whiteside in The Man Who Came To Dinner, but manages to also project enough warmth to come across as a good guy. Still, I have trouble imagining boys liking someone who tells them to chew their food ""28-times exactly"". I guess you just accept it somehow.

At 83 minutes it's a lot of fun and will keep you laughing.",1446336000,3,1988,4.736994219653179

1220370,5,B00000IBMB,"Here is the classic comedy side of Clifton Webb in the DVD version of the movie, Sitting Pretty.  Clifton Webb stars in the lead role as the self described genius Mr. Belvedere who is researching a book on life in the suburbs during the Post World War II Era.  Robert Young and Maureen O'Hara are the parents of three difficult children.  To compliment part of the research for his book, he accepts the job as babysitter for their three children.  The boys soften Belvedere's stiffness and genius protocol with hugs and affection to the extent of great hilarity.  The humor really goes airborne in this comedy when Belvedere publishes all the dirt in his book as another part of his research covered the double standards and undercurrents of mischief in the lives of surrounding neighbors.  This is outstanding classic humor with nothing x-rated, the whole family can enjoy today as well as those of us who grew up during that era of the 1940s & 1950s.  I believe the real message of humor in this movie is some things about human behavior never change.",1423267200,,1053,4.690217391304348

- Tacey: ""And may I ask what your profession is?""
- Mr. Belvedere: ""Certainly. I'm a genius.""

Sitting Pretty turned out to be unexpectedly 1948's critics' darling. It earned Clifton Webb an Oscar nomination for best actor as well as garnered him his most defining role. He plays Lynn Belvedere, jack of all trades and, apparently, master of all of them, too. When he deigns to respond to the want ad for a nanny placed by a despairing Tacey King (Maureen O'Hara), it sets into motion events that would topsy turvy the suburban community of Hummingbird Hill.

Needless to say, Mr. Belvedere isn't quite what Larry (Robert Young) and Tacey King, parents besieged with three rambunctious brats, were anticipating in the way of a nanny. Lynn Belvedere presents a chilly, superior disposition and a startling admission: ""Mrs. King, I happen to dislike all children intensely. But I assure you that I can readily attend to their necessary, though unpleasant, wants."" In the face of such supreme poise and show of confidence, the Kings fold like a lawn chair. Belvedere moves into 21 Carver's Lane and soon takes charge of the household and tames the three misbehaving young scamps and that colossal, undomesticated dog.

Although Maureen O'Hara and Robert Young do good work here, it's clearly the Clifton Webb show. Note that Webb, before this movie, had come to occupy the niche of the effete gentleman of questionable morals in a series of noir pictures and melodramas:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laura/dp/B00AHEDAQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laura</a>&nbsp;(1944),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Corner-Fox-Film-Noir/dp/B000B8380A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Corner (Fox Film Noir)</a>&nbsp;(1946), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Razor-s-Edge/dp/B0007PALVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Razor's Edge</a>&nbsp;(1946). In 1948, the movie-going audience weren't prepared for Webb's sudden swerve into inhabiting the role of the haughty yet surprisingly sympathetic and badass babysitter. The critics made much of his performance as Belvedere, and the gush is warranted. Clifton Webb is sublime here.

But credit, too, the inspired script, adapted from Gwen Davenport's 1947 novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belvedere/dp/B001OC9GNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belvedere</a>&nbsp;(which she'd in turn adapted from her unpublished play ""Squatter's Rights""). There's this wish fulfillment in play because who among us doesn't wish to get away with unfiltered behavior? Delightfully, Mr. Belvedere doesn't have a filter. This leaves him free to dispense certain truths, except he says these with such wit and polish, it's, well, endearing.

Although, let's face it, sometimes the clever bon mot isn't a match for the visceral gag of a grown-up's retaliation of dumping a bowl of oatmeal on an ill-mannered child.

Turns out, the suburban community of Hummingbird Hill isn't as serene as we'd assumed. There's a host of busy-bodies engrossed in gossip-mongering, and the story's central conflict revolves around that. The specific culprit is the Kings' nosy neighbor, Clarence Appleton (Richard Haydn). He's that prissy odd duck what reads your mail and wanders into your yard and is all up in  your business. He's certainly not above spreading vile rumors about the Kings and their peckish nanny. But, no worries, this is a comedy, a sparkling comedy. Domestic disputes are soon put to bed, scandals sorted out, prying neighbors get their comeuppance, and the big mystery revealed surrounding what exactly Belvedere was up to in his free time. Along the way, we're treated to this superior nanny putting deserving people down with clever barbs. Sitting Pretty was so well received it launched two sequels - 1949's Mr. Belvedere Goes to College (with a 20-year-old Shirley Temple) and 1951's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Belvedere-Rings-the-Bell/dp/B0089BSMDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell</a>&nbsp;- and there would've been more films except that Webb put his put down, not wanting to be typecast. Ha! Too late for that, Mr. Belvedere.",1405382400,,4389,6.197044334975369

This gives him time and the wherewithal to research and to write a book, and when it is published, it creates an uproar among leading citizens. Naturally he is threatened with lawsuits, and things get out of hand when everyone finds out who the main source of his information was. It was the neighborhood busybody, and he is put to flight by the offended parties. Perhaps the best scene is where he teaches a little boy not to throw oatmeal at people, and he does this by dumping a bowl of oatmeal over the little boy's head.

The best part of this film is the ever growing list of specialties that Lynn Belvedere (Webb) claims to have mastered, including fisticuffs when his dopey employer (Robert Young as Harry King) grows increasingly jealous over some incredible gossip concerning his wife (the effervescent Maureen O'Hara as Tacey King) and Mr. Belvedere.  That the idiot husband could ever entertain such a preposterous accusation is fabulous fun.  This is a great indictment of gossip and those who indulge in the hope it might be true.

1220615,5,B00000IBMB,"The movie Sitting Pretty was one of a handful of movies that I found and considered myself very lucky. I hit the jackpot! It is another wonderful black and white movie. Clifton Webb, Maureen O'Hara and Robert Young are cast perfectly for their roles! Clifton Webb plays the role of a genius to a T. He can really carry off the ""I know everything and can do everything, so you should listen to what I say"" type of person. He comes off a little annoying but once you see that he really knows what he is talking about then you have great appreciation for his talents.

 In some ways I think this movie takes a look into a number of family homes. A mother who has her hands full with three active children, a dog, a home to maintain, cooking, cleaning and to top if off being the ""perfect"" corporate wife. I use the term corporate wife because part of her role includes going to the boss's house for a formal dinner and then playing cards. Her husband Robert Young is a lawyer working at a firm for a lecherous boss who has a Puritan like standard of behavior for his employees but not for himself. The boss's wife meanwhile is clueless about her husband's behavior at the office and thinks that he is the pillar of the community. There is a nosy neighbor who seems to take pleasure inserting himself in every situation with his neighbors then spreading gossip throughout the community. Like the old saying goes "" What comes around goes around"" Mr. Belvedere ( Clifton Webb) sets things right and all facades of these characters are exposed especially the nosy neighbor. So many life lessons can be learned in these old movies.",1372118400,,1623,4.498305084745763

Also love the fact that the kids in this film are not portrayed as '40's-era ""perfect"" children, but are as rambunctious and misbehaved as most young boys. Very enjoyable and funny film.

The man had a way of making any role that he played a unique experience that makes a quality re-make of his role impossible.  His approach in this movie that at times seems to be the only sane person in the household that he has rented a room in is classic comedy of a style that is slowly being lost in the modern movies of today.

As the numbers of people that have a VHS player grows smalled, the chances of missing such a funny and well acted comedy will be lost if they don't get it on DVD soon.",1298332800,,627,3.9133858267716537

I saw this movie many, many years ago. I enjoyed it then and enjoy it just as much now. Clifton Webb is outstanding as a live-in baby sitter, Mr Belvedere, in charge of three rebellious kids. His criptic manner is a joy to behold and would sort out many problems in today's PC world in bringing up kids. The scene that has been etched into my memory all of these years is of the baby throwing porridge over Mr Belvedere (Webb) and Belveder's response of planting the bowl of porridge on the kid's head.  He also has a novel approach to sorting out the neighbourhood busy body and various other pious citizens.

1220693,5,B00000IBMB,"First by today's standards Prim Proper 1950's era movie Sitting Pretty is like way way dated so buy this video with that fact firmly in mind.  I number among those who love some of the older black and white movies.  This movie is about a Nanny named Lynn Belvedere who sight unseen was assumed to be a proper woman governess for 3 active little 1950's era boy's.

This film occurs in the beginning of the golden heyday of post World War II 1950's Suburban Sprawl out of the city but still near the Beltway - America.  A typical 50's suburban family complete with working father and housewife mom need a nanny for three boys who prove too much for any ordinary donestic. In comes Lynn Belvedere sight unseen and seemingly the perfect woman for the job that is until of course HE shows up!

Lynn Belvedere arrives a man who despite his self professed genius does not truly ""LIKE"" children.  Lynn Belvedere understands children diving into their proper rearing with an good engineer's sense of goal oriented purpose.  Misunderstood at first the children eventually come to love Lynn Belvedere and settle down.  Lynn Belvedere soon works is way into becoming part of what makes the family function correctly and is accepted by the parents with loud encouragement from the kids, bird and dog!  Lynn Belvedere cares for the children's health welfare and safety but love affection and such other matters are things he leaves to parents.

Lynn Belvedere has some pretty strange habits like standing on his head to acheive inner peace.  Taking walks (constitutionals) to clear the mind.  Chewing food a specific number of times to aid in proper digestion dictums he insists the children follow and they do even the baby tries to stand on his head in his crib.

Like any other 1950's suburban neighborhood this one was a regular Payton Place type hot bed of wagging tongues, shallow minds and idle gossip into which our family is soon enmeshed, NOT in a good way to say the least.  Nosey neighbors and puritanical community morrays shared by town hipocrytes force a few innocent situations to a head as sharp tongued lamers put an unplesant and incorrect spin on nasty gossip spread aboout inappropriate goings on between Lynn Belvedere Nanny and the lady of the house.

However Lynn Belvedere self professed Genius is not one to be out done as he blows the lid off the quaint peaceful polite society by writing a Tell ALL Book about the towers of moral rectitude in the town as he shares in accurate detail each of their personal failings.  In Lynn Belvedere's book he chonicles the real trueful shameful goings on in the town and even though names were changed everyone knows the character in the book modeled after them.  Lynn Belvedere's book about his experiences and findings regards the goings on in the small town becomes a hit and the fun goes on from there.

Sitting Pretty really does need to be released as a DVD because it is totally awesome for fans of movies of this era.  This is a harmless movie that just makes you laugh.  This movie is not great film but it is a nice helpful tonic for a rainy day when you just want easy laughs while you emerse yourself in a bygone 1950's age that never really was the Norman Rockwell, Suburban Utopia depicted here.  This movie is cheap innocent fun and to me that makes it worth a five star rating.",1136160000,21,3344,4.653061224489796

7909833,5,B00000IBMB,"Delightful story about a writer(Clifton Webb) who, through a misunderstanding, rents a room with a family(parents; Maureen O'Hara and Robert Young) in a small town, post WWII.  Unbeknownst to the family, he's writing a tell-all book about life in the small town.  Upon moving in, it immediately becomes apparent that the single and highly cultured writer will clash with the everyday existence of family life.  The writer takes all in stride though and even rises to fill additional roles as baby-sitter and house-keeper.  He becomes a fixture in the household, even beloved by the children.  The REAL fun begins when the book comes out!
Clifton Webb is his usual impeccable, worldly and well spoken self.  Maureen O'Hara is probably the best looking mom on this 1948 block.  Robert Young is a bit of a drip in this one, as he's always coming home from work tired and finding trouble afoot.",1519948800,,890,4.8933333333333335
