8636889,2,B00HWGT31C,Why pay for a show on a channel subscribed to under your cable provider...not happy because I love this show,1528848000,,108,4.45
8636890,2,B00HWGT31C,Awful and depressing. Can't imagine why anyone would watch this,1518480000,,63,5.4
8636891,4,B00HWGT31C,"The first three episodes that I have seen are really pretty good. Other reviews I'm seeing here don't seem to even apply to season 8, so it doesn't make sense that they are here.",1516838400,,178,4.264705882352941
8636892,4,B00HWGT31C,"Season 8 remains consistent - compelling stories told in a compelling way. This is one of the better series on television today. The episode about the guy in Syria bothered me, though. The person they featured, a salesman/photographer from New York, just seemed totally devoid of any capacity for introspection. He basically wrote off his fellow captive as a waste of life because he had never seen ""Scarface"" before - probably because he had done other things with his time such as learning five languages, including Arabic (of some value in Syria, I would think) and obtaining a Ph. D. He also jeopardized his fellow captive's life by insisting on a brazen escape and then leaving him behind after the other guy helped him out of the cell window. At the end, I would have expected some life-lessons learned, perhaps some modesty or reflection - such as maybe realizing how naive he had been to leave his sales job and his gym membership and jump into the middle of a complex civil war that he was totally ignorant about, or being thankful that his recklessness didn't end up costing the other captive to be killed after he left him behind. This guy and his shallow ""America Rules!"" attitude is the reason a lot of people abroad have a negative view of America. An interview with the other captive would have added a lot more depth and perspective to this episode.",1516579200,,1365,4.691666666666666

8636894,1,B00HWGT31C,"I bought it. ONLY because I couldn't see the names of the episodes. Turns out, season 8 is either a re-run of past seasons or there's other places to get it. The price is insane. You get 7 or 8 episodes. You do the math. Divide total price by number of episodes. Then, tell me if it's worth that much per episode? I DONT think so. Last item I will EVER buy from Nat Geo.",1397174400,10,370,3.9466666666666668
