8611559,5,B000IFRRYY,"This DVD is an expose of the 12-step syndicate in San Francisco County. At a regular meeting of the Drug Abuse Advisory Board, Jack Trimpey proposes that when agency clients repeatedly fail addiction treatment programs, they be provided information on self-recovery through planned permanent abstinence, i.e. AVRT.

The Board's urgent, contrived reactions are absurd and tragic, making this a classic, social documentary. This DVD is a great way for anyone, especially public officials and administrators, to finally see why public funds for addiction treatment programs are a very poor investment.

Mr. Trimpey's eloquent presentation exposes the cultural barriers to self-reliance that are the root cause of mass, runaway addiction to alcohol and other drugs. You can learn new dimensions of AVRT to overcome your own addiction treatment disorder, because we are all the ""untreatables"" who are the subject of this important historical event.

PS: Amazon made me rate it, I was going to leave that up to other viewers. However, it really is a 5 star production that anyone interested in addiction and recovery must see.",1188172800,,1195,5.478260869565218
