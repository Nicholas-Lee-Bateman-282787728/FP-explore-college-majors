Trying to explain the threat and the reality of this was complicated.  This DVD did the trick.",1401062400,2,191,4.617647058823529
4665028,5,B005E7OUOG,"Excellent for ages 3 and through third or fourth grade...they approach people unknown, people the kids know, etc. Tips on things even like tricks ppl play our tips for answering for etc. In Non scary way. Add a bit of humor, visuals that would capture the age appropriate attention so the info gets digested....very well done and strongly recommend for parents to use as a discussion level set.",1398556800,,394,4.8088235294117645

4665031,3,B005E7OUOG,"We have the other Safe Side DVD and loved it, so now that my children are older I ordered this one.  Unfortunately, it was ""really lame"" (for a 10 and 8 year old) and not as well produced as the other.  I did not feel that it gave any advice that I couldn't have given on my own, though it did do a good job of driving home the fact that the person you THINK you are chatting with on the web may be completely different than who that person really IS.

The other Safe Side DVD, by the way, is fantastic.  It gave us lots of info and even as a parent I learned from it.",1346025600,3,568,3.8290598290598292

It's quite joky/goofy but covers the basics for safety at at good level - enough to drive home the point and get kids (and parents)thinking without being too scary.
