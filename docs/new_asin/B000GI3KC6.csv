8132573,4,B000GI3KC6,"This is a short (1 hour) black & white from 1940.  The leading man & lady appeared immediately, and grabbed my interest.  He, a happy drunk cowboy out having fun with friends;  she a spoiled rich beauty just off the train from Boston, way out of her element near Arizona's border with Mexico.  Both characters rise well above their introductory scenes as conflict with a crooked Sheriff and the local bad guys brings out the best in our leading couple, in spite of the leading man's alcohol habit.  The movie isn't long enough for us to find out whether he can stay dry, so we get a more realistic, yet still upbeat, ending.

Typical of movies from before WW2, the jumps between scenes may seem a bit harsh, but they do keep things going for good reason.  This film attempts to reduce a book to one hour.  The book ""The Light of Western Stars"", by Zane Grey, was first published in 1914.  This 1940 film presents only enough high points from the book to present a story.  I'd like to see a remake with 21st century technology.",1477612800,,1026,4.438502673796791

8132577,2,B000GI3KC6,"B-westerns such as Paramount's 'The Light of the Western Stars' were cranked out in the '30s and '40s like Bosco.  And although this particular picture boasts the cachet of having best-selling author Zane Grey and prolific film and TV director Lesley Selander attached to it, the result really isn't any better or worse than the hundreds of other oaters produced during the period (routine storyline, cornball dialog, overtheatrical performances, bland camerawork, etc.), making for little more than a fun and forgettable 65-minute trip down nostalgia lane.  The print offered on this Lionsgate DVD, while not restored to any appreciable extent and showing signs of wear throughout, is still fair to good in terms of audio and video quality.  2 stars overall.",1348272000,2,759,5.256198347107438
