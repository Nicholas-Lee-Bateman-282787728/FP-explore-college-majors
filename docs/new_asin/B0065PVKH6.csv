4961309,5,B0065PVKH6,"This is a spinning workout that takes you through some scenic views of Ireland (cities and landscapes) which lasts approximately 50 minutes.

What's interesting in this video is there is no warm up or cool down, so to speak.  I've purchased two other Spinning videos (both with Josh Taylor as the instructor) and in both of them it's set up  an a classroom style, with about 10-15 students on their bikes.  He starts off each of those videos with properly getting on the bike, making sure it's set up, and then slowly starting to pedal-not so in this video.  The second you hit Play (with or without music), you're pedaling right away.  Note that it doesn't start out tough...light resistance, so it does give you a 5 minute warmup where you're just pedaling.  Anyways, I like this better than the classroom style videos he has done.

Throughout the 50 minutes, you go through a variety of scenes and you go through some hills/climbs and different cadences.  It's a solid workout.  You finally push really hard at the last 4 minutes and then you take the resistance off and pedal for about 3-4 minutes.  Again, in his other videos...you pedal for the same 3-4 minutes with no resistance, but then everyone in the class gets off their bikes and he takes you through some stretches.  Not so on this one.  He basically does the pedaling with you, then tells you to make sure you stretch, thanks, and goodbye.  Again, I like this better as I used to turn the other videos off and do my own stretching anyways.

Another positive thing about this DVD is the layout.  Looking at the TV, you have the scenic view taking up the whole screen, and then on the left is an overlay with Josh Taylor facing you, doing the same workout as you, and guiding you through it.  One the right is a big display listing the Time, Cadence, Seat Position, Hand Position, Heart Rate %, and Resistance.  It's all laid out there for you.  One complaint I had on the other DVD's is that you never knew how much time had elapsed or what the current heart rate should be.  Not so with this DVD-it updates real time throughout the workout, which is very helpful!  One user commented saying that these two overlays took up too much of the screen...I don't think so.  Besides, they have some opacity to them, so you're getting the scenic view the whole time anyways.

I'll be honest, I didn't care *too* much for the scenic Ireland views...for me it was more about the workout.  Josh is a great instructor and having all the tools needed for this workout right on the screen was quite helpful.  I like the no-nonsense approach to this DVD and hope others in the future incorporate it.",1357430400,21,2649,4.537974683544304
4961310,4,B0065PVKH6,"Really like the instructor and the idea for riding with something to look at while hearing the instructor is great. Wouldn't rate the top star because I would have like some more commentary related to the scenery, not just the hill, or dale!",1357084800,,241,4.627906976744186
4961311,5,B0065PVKH6,Great Video!! Well worth the money and the views are great.  Felt like I was in Ireland unit I looked out and it was snowing in Colorado,1356652800,6,136,4.037037037037037

4961313,4,B0065PVKH6,Pretty but not as realistic as I thought it would be.  The heart rate info is helpful but I would rather not see the guy on the screen for the entire ride.,1355875200,,155,3.84375
4961314,4,B0065PVKH6,"Just ok. Too many visual interruptions, scenery is not that great, the footage does not always match cycling tempo. The coaching is helpful and motivating.",1355011200,,155,5.24
4961315,2,B0065PVKH6,"I have to say I am not a fanatic about spinning but i do like bicycling. I have never had a dvd of this sort so I was taking a chance in ordering this video. My expectation was to have an on-screen full view of the road tour but I was immediately disappointed. The screen is sort of split in 3 sections. On the left 1/3 you have the instructor constantly facing you as he spins his stationary bike while giving you some motivation. And nooo....I don't want to continuously see the guy's face distracting me from the view of the Ireland sites. That section of the screen is also gray and shadows the view of the Ireland tour. The middle 1/3 section of the screen is where you actually see the road in front of you and various views of Ireland. The tour is shot in regular video pix. It is not high quality or High Def etc etc. Now, the right section of the TV screen is also gray like the left, gives you spinning data (i.e. speed, difficulty, time etc etc) and shadows the tour so again you don't see much of Ireland. VERY annoying. I gave it 2 stars out of compassion for the instructor's hard work, sweat and dedication during the work out.",1354406400,138,1142,4.243119266055046
4961316,5,B0065PVKH6,"My wife bought this for me to use with my new indoor trainer. The format kind of put me off at first, mostly during the warm up.after we got done with that I started sweating pretty good and didn't care about the format. By the end I was panting and struggling with the out of saddle work. Overall a good video. I think I'll still enjoy it and it'll still be challenging for awhile.",1353542400,2,382,4.175675675675675
4961317,5,B0065PVKH6,"As far as I'm concerned, any spinning DVD with Josh Taylor as the instructor is a winner.  I have several of his DVDs and this one certainly lives up to the others.  This is a beautiful indoor ride through the streets and trails of Ireland with Josh sitting off to the left throughout the ride, offering his usual encouragement and biking tips.  As always, I look forward to purchasing future Josh Taylor DVDs.",1347408000,12,410,4.589041095890411
4961318,5,B0065PVKH6,"The instructor is Josh Taylor, who is a big name in spinning but he comes from a road bike and racing background and the workout he puts you through makes that apparent.

The workout is about 50 minutes. He puts you through a warmup and a cooldown, and between there are 3 tempo sections with recovery periods between them.

The tempo and recovery sections varied, and matches the terrain on the video, it feels like you are on a ride with Josh. Flat sections, seated and standing climbs, it has it all.

He provides motivation at times in the workout where you may feel like fading a bit, so it keeps you focused. And more importantly he gives you tips and reminders on form, breathing and staying hydrated.

There's telemetry on the right portion of the screen so you'll always know your target cadence, heart rate and resistance level.

I have another video that's in a class setting but I prefer this format much more. I hope he makes more of these vidoes!",1340236800,54,960,4.526011560693641

4961320,5,B0065PVKH6,"Love this Spinning Ireland's DVD.  Love the music, the coach, and the info on the side.  Great work out.  Some reviews didn't care for the coach on the side, as you can see from my picture, he is not distracting at all. Great DVD and use it often.",1499385600,3,247,4.104166666666667
4961321,5,B0065PVKH6,"I really love this workout! I include it into my fitness regimen every week. What's great about the DVD is that the difficulty of the workout changes as the Ireland terrain changes. One moment you may be riding on flat roads and then next moment your are climbing rolling hills. This all occurs while riding three intervals (ranging from 7-12 minutes). What is great is your view of Ireland scenary and the roads you are riding give you the feeling that you are riding on the roads as you can view the road ahead of you. What is also great about the DVD is that the range for RPMs and percent of maximum heart rate (MHR) is displayed on the DVD so you can monitor your performance. I completed the workout a few times without those tools but I found that it was important to monitor both RPMs & percent of MHR as it provided me with a more effective workout. Also, Josh Taylor does a great job of motivating and challenging you throughout the workout. One of the better spinning DVDs!  Well worth the money!!",1490745600,,1008,4.419354838709677
4961322,4,B0065PVKH6,"These are not as good as the Big Island Hawaii videos you can get. Some of the video is poor quality, shaky and bothersome, especially when they pan off the road and show buildings or scenery. The music is pretty good, and at times, excellent. The instructor takes up about a third of the screen and he looks awkward hanging in the air riding his cycle. I wish he just spoke and coached and we had more video of the scenery, more like the Big Island Hawaii video which is simply just a better overall production. That said, I like the video and use it as a part of my workout routine.",1488412800,,584,4.223214285714286
4961323,2,B0065PVKH6,Not very good at all. The 'ride' rarely is continuous and it's rarely from the point of view of the a 'real' biker. I wanted to feel like I was riding in Ireland...I didn't.,1486944000,,173,4.117647058823529

4961334,5,B0065PVKH6,"Excellent spinning video.
What you see on the screen is 85% moving along Irelands roadways with about 15% panning around on scenery  [more on this later] Superimposed on 1/4 of the RH screen is the instructor on his bike...on the LH side is recommended cadence, tension and heart rate recommendations by % of your max.
What you hear is calming musak type music appropriate to the ride along with just enough coaching and instruction.
 I am  casual cyclist with many spin classes under my belt and this is an excellent vid for hard core and beginners alike. The instructor gives the perfect balance of instruction and motivation without being a nag or talking too much. About the only folks that wouldn't like this are folks that need heavy metal motivational music with the instructor screaming in their ear- GO FASTER!

I think the only improvement  would be the too fast panning in a very small % of this vid that can be disorienting. Producers of these vids should have the instructor viewing the same scenery we see to give a better experience. This one does a good job, much better than riding at home while watching a program or movie.",1449273600,2,1141,4.685
4961335,5,B0065PVKH6,"ok. I read tons of reviews on tons of spinning dvd's including this one.  I WANTED to love it, as the idea of focusing on the road ahead of me instead of a ""class"" of riders seemed great.  I read a review of someone who hated the three way ""split"" screen (it's not split), someone said the guy is corny and talks too much etc.  The split screen reviewer really had me unsure I must say, but knowing return policies being so easy, figured what the heck.  So I DO enjoy this dvd alot!
PRO's:
THE VIEW: It's is a full screen of the Irish landscape and roads with the instructor on one side (you can still see the full images behind him, so it really doesn't cut  off the full view), and stats on the other side, again, you CAN see past them to the landscape behind.  For me, he says just the right things to keep me motivated.  I do like being able to see him ride, because i try to match my cadence to his. I don't have a digital anything on my bike... and i dont' mind the stats on the side, they remind me what to be doing and help to distract, but I can also ""look thru' them to see the views that i bought it for.

THE MUSIC: Typically I like to hear fast paced alternative rock for spinning...but somehow the soft irish music playing on this dvd worked just fine.  I wanted the distraction of the road so I could look at  a curve up ahead and think.. OK just keep standing until that curve!.. and that is mostly what I got, was idea of riding down this road and ... ""just pedal faster till that street sign"" that we all need to keep us going.

CON:  I gave 5 ""i love it"" stars, because i more than ""like it"" which is 4.... if i could remove just 1/2 a point I would and here is why.  The idea of riding along a road and using landmarks and curves and trees and bushes for 'carrots' to go further and push harder for just a little bit longer, is the purpose of having a cd like this (for me).  There are many times that the open road ahead will cut away to churches and cathedrals and other Irish landmarks that yes are beautiful... but take my focus off of that ""tree"" that I was pushing hard to pass... then I kind of mentally have to start over.... I don't get that part at all, a little bummed.  The other thing that I'd like to have seen is the roads match the class.  When we increase resistance to get up a hill, switch the road ahead to a hill so we can be climbing towards the crest of it!!  Some times you can see the road is going at a downhill grade and it doesn't match the cadence of the class.",1443398400,4,2510,4.018108651911469
4961336,4,B0065PVKH6,"A very engaging workout for spinning, just wish it had a second workout on the disc as well",1439337600,,91,4.111111111111111
4961337,4,B0065PVKH6,I am not a spinner. I have a Schwinn Airdyne exercise bike and really like this DVD. Josh Taylor does provide warm up and cool down and excellent coaching along the way to keep me moving in cardio range through the 50 minutes while I enjoy the sites in Ireland. I would recommend this to other people and I would definitely purchase other spinning DVDs with Josh Taylor doing road tours in other places.,1437868800,,403,4.45945945945946

4961348,4,B0065PVKH6,"I didn't really like this video at first, because of the non-ability to turn off the images of the instructor and the ride specs- I wanted to see more of Ireland, but just hear the instructor.  I still think they should change the format and allow that.  But I've used it several times now, and it's growing on me.  If you are looking to just enjoy a virtual scenic ride, this may not be for you, but if you want to add a spinning workout to your library where you are getting a bit more interesting scenery during your spin workout, you might like it.  The more I use it, the more I like it- but of course there will be a point where I memorize every comment Josh the instructor makes.  I am going to add more of these to my library so I have more variety, but until then, I'm getting good use of it.",1434844800,,801,4.076433121019108

Ive seen some videos on youtube that are good, but I cannot stand up and pedal like a mad woman yet.  This video has mostly a seated standing climb and is just right as far as tempo and resistance goes for a beginner.  I only gave it four stars because you can turn the music on and off, but not the instructor.  However, they have fantastic bonus features on how to make sure you are fitted to your bike and beginners instructions on how to ride it too.  Super good bonus features.",1418947200,,627,4.056910569105691

4961390,2,B0065PVKH6,"This is a weird cycling DVD, because the video is more like a tourism show that does not match the intended ride. The idea behind cycling videos, at least for road cyclists like me, is to try to immerse yourself in a simulated ride, where the audio and the video are in sync. Sadly, that does not happen here- the flow of the ride is constantly interrupted because the camera cuts to unrelated images while climbing a hill, for example. Though not completely worthless, this DVD's incongruity takes most of the value from what could have been a good training experience.",1393632000,,570,4.653465346534653

I have other Spinning DVDs but this is my favourite. I hope he does more like Ireland!!
Obviously you have to go at your own pace with anything, but he's like your own personal cheer leader. I would recommend
this DVD highly especially for your first, it makes all others pale in comparison.",1391040000,,414,4.763888888888889

Yes, he is on one side of the screen and the stats are on the other, but I really liked having the info and instructor to use as a reference. The video has a small rest about 30 minutes in. It's a great place to stop if I don't want to do a 45 minute workout.",1390780800,2,354,4.0

4961401,1,B0065PVKH6,"I got this one for Christmas with the hopes of keeping up my training as the weather gets worse.  This is not what I had in mind at all.  For those of you hoping to have a GoPro tour of Ireland with maybe some suggestions of what level of resistance as the terrain changes, that is not the case.  One part of your screen is the trainer....that you cannot turn off.  The middle part of the screen is the road ride that was shot from a car.  The last part of the screen is suggestions made for resistance, speed, heart rate...that you cannot shut off.  The most frustrating part is that it is only one 50 minute ride.  ONE!!!  I am sure there is s whole lot more of Ireland to see then in one 50 minute bike ride.  There are better DVD out there and then there is also free YouTube indoor trainers to view to help with your training.  This one needs to stay one the shelf.",1389052800,,870,4.094674556213017
4961402,4,B0065PVKH6,"There are a lot of negative reviews and well, in summary, I gather they don't grasp the concept of ""spinning"". This isn't meant to be a slow video of a grand tour of Ireland- it's meant to be a video that makes you sweat and go through the motions of a spinning class while AT THE SAME TIME distracting your mind with views of Ireland so please ignore the complaints about the screen set up- it is absolutely necessary as this is a WORKOUT.
That said, he's pretty funny, at times annoying and his time doesn't really seem to be matched too well with the clock but I keep at eye on the resistance on the right and enjoy the view of Ireland as I sweat through the workout.
I typically use sufferfest videos so this is for my easier days but it still is a hard workout. My legs look the best they ever have- slim and toned. Bye bye pockets of fat!!!!",1388620800,,847,4.170731707317073
4961403,1,B0065PVKH6,"Freaky how the instructor was super imposed on one 1/3 of left screen...floating in space riding on bike. Right 1/3 of screen has instructions on gear, effort, etc. That left tiny area to actually see Ireland.",1387929600,,209,4.833333333333333

4961405,4,B0065PVKH6,Not HD or anything fancy but its pretty fun to watch with some really great interval training.  Will definitely help maintain my legs over the winter months.  Enjoyed the views of Ireland very much.  Can't to bike out there for real!  ;),1387065600,,237,4.571428571428571
4961406,4,B0065PVKH6,"Overall I have used this DVD several times with doing my own spinning.  I have to say the music along with Josh Taylor can be goofy at times but he does have good instruction but just sometimes says cheesy motivational stuff along with his facial expressios can be funny.

The video is a good 50 minute workout from warmup to uptempo intervals to the final climb.  The video or footage is again ""ok"" and at times feel like I'm just watching a separate video shots of Ireland while Josh is doing his instructing.  I just purchased some other home spinning video workouts so will compare but I would say overall a good buy for the workout.

** Update**  I have used this DVD now several times and I like it.  Good workout.  Again the video shots are ok and for the most part they repeat scenes but Josh Taylor does a good job during video keeping you motivated and discussing what you are doing at time.",1386460800,4,901,4.385542168674699

4961409,1,B0065PVKH6,"I was looking for a video with beautiful scenery that would compensate for the boredom of riding my exercise bike. So much of Ireland is beautiful, you'd think it would be easy to feature scenery that would transport a viewer away from the drudgery of cycling exercise. Unfortunately, this DVD just doesn't do the job. And the constant exercise commentary is beyond irritating.",1384819200,,377,5.0

4961413,5,B0065PVKH6,"I'm fairly new to spinning and I found the dashboard feature on this DVD to be very helpful. Much better than the Italy Rides DVDs, which pretty much leave it up to the rider to determine the intensity of the workout.",1380153600,2,217,4.317073170731708

4961415,4,B0065PVKH6,"I've used this DVD a handful of times now, and I have to say, each time I like it a bit more. I enjoy the instructor and find him
encouraging without being annoying (that's something I CANNOT say about a few of my other Spin DVDS) and he makes me want to push myself. The time goes quickly. I Spin with a fan blowing in my face, just for atmosphere, LOL.

If you are a Spin enthusiast like I am, and you've been Spinning to the ""same ole stuff"" for many years, try Spinning Ireland.
It's delightful. I am hoping that the company adds many more of these excursions because I will DEFINITELY be purchasing them.

  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I wished the weather was brighter- but hey, it's Ireland!",1377475200,7,725,4.2700729927007295

4961419,3,B0065PVKH6,This video provided a solid workout however I think I enjoy other workouts videos better.  A sustained 12 minute climb at the end is killer.,1370390400,,140,4.6
4961420,3,B0065PVKH6,"As far as the workout itself goes, this dvd is fine.  I would prefer it to have onscreen info about time remaining in each interval, though.

The reason it only gets three stars is that it really isn't much of a road tour.  The actual road video segments are repeated and there are random scenes of fields and cathedrals.  When you are ""on the road, "" there is little correlation between what you're seeing and the instructions of the video (climbs vs. flats).

I much prefer the Rides dvds.  These let you follow along on an actual ride with a group of cyclists.  The onscreen info is excellent and the video gives much more of a ""you are there"" feeling.",1369612800,30,655,4.408333333333333
4961421,4,B0065PVKH6,"Overall this is a very good spin workout as I just finished my first ""ride"" through it.  Josh gives great instruction and always gives you options if it is becoming to hard or too easy.

I must say that my shirt was soaked through by the end of the ride, which was great.

One of the drawbacks is that there is pixelation on my large HDTV.  Enough to notice it and be like, wow what a great opportunity to show off the landscape, wonder why they didn't?  Also, you're riding along a road then it switches to a view of a castle or square or something...kind of odd.  I guess I was expecting more of a true ""on the road"" experience, but overall am happy with the workout.",1368835200,,669,4.1875
4961422,5,B0065PVKH6,Pop this DVD in for a change from the regular spinning DVDS and see some scenery of Ireland.  Josh is one of our favorite trainers from the spinning collection.,1368835200,,160,4.517241379310345

4961424,4,B0065PVKH6,"so far, this spinning exercise is moderately difficult. it keeps me at a steady pace-- there are hills and sprints.
i like the hour length and it is helpful to be able to see Ireland's beautiful views.

4961428,4,B0065PVKH6,"I bought this to go with my LeMond RevMaster pro for those days I can't make it to spin class or want to do another workout at home.  I agree that the instructor does talk a lot.  My favorite Spin instructor at the gym does as well; I think the difference is that my ""live"" instructor is humorous and doesn't try to be a guru all the time.  I got an excellent workout because I stuck to the recommended RPMs and made sure to use my resistance wisely.  I gave it four stars because the scenery transition is a little jerky and sometimes the scenery doesn't match the ride.  But it was lovely.",1365120000,,591,4.1946902654867255

You can see Ireland on the full screen. The instructor is on the side giving you full view.  It was epic being able to ride my bike in my living room and travel to another country.  It's also a super workout.  The instructor is a unique and let's say 'deep' individual.  I quote: ""close your eyes and feel your body connecting to your bike'.  Interesting.  But he's hot so it's ok.  I highly recommend!!",1362096000,20,562,4.3076923076923075

I only wish there was a way to do a full scenery screen with workout commentary. Or just have the instructor on the left so you can keep up with his cadence and remove the right screen info since he tells/shows us when to increase resistance, cadence and stand up. That is the only reason I did not give this a 5 star rating.",1361318400,,444,4.056818181818182

Years ago when I was in fantastic and racing (though i never raced that seriously) i used spinning as a way to stay in shape.  Well years have gone by, menopause hit, the pounds have packed on and my old rear hasn't seen a spin class in years. However, I decided as a present for myself this year for my birthday to get myself two spin bikes. One fore me and one for my daughter.  I bought quite a few videos including the Mindy mylea videos. This one is my all time favorite.  I find myself always gravitating back to this one. It's a really tough work out, but doable!

It is clearly professionally videotaped without the chatter or shaking of other DVDs.

Music is very Irish, upbeat, and in keeping with the level of work.

Josh is a very good trainer, tough but positive.  No suffering here, just hard work and fun.

The heart rate, cadence, and perceived level of exertion does not crowd the screen.

The target cadence and heart rate are continually displayed on the right side of the screen, with a 1st person POV display most of the time.  I also enjoy videos that are follow traditional ""a bunch of people in a room,"" but this is by far my favorite and I look forward to anything else that follows this formatting.  Listening to the instructor throughout the video does not annoy me, and that is a huge plus :-)  There is a nice mini cool-down session just around 25 minutes, so if I am short on time I can call it quits there.
