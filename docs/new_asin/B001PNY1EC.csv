4906468,4,B001PNY1EC,"This movie is a bit of a sleeper.  It is quite entertaining, and the chemistry between the main characters is an on-screen success.  While there is no trailer for it, it is one worth watching through.  If you are looking for a steamy on-screen romance, this one is not it, as it centers around a storyline with an actual plot.  If you are looking for a same sex movie with a cast who can act and a plot not set in a bar, this one is for you.  On the down side, there are a few disconnecting scenes towards the end where the movie does not present a transition to the audience, so you are left to some guessing as to how point A to point B actually connected.  Otherwise, it is a very charming and entertaining movie.",1389225600,,716,4.1521739130434785
4906469,3,B001PNY1EC,"It was okay but I've seen better.  predictable and not well acted. I've gotta say though, with not a lot of lesbian movies out there this one doesn't totally suck.",1388275200,,163,4.433333333333334
4906470,3,B001PNY1EC,"It's quirky, I'll give it that. Scarlet is a good person, though she tries to hide it. We don't really see the other woman, in any depth until the end, but we know she's a good person too. The minute they bring in a man to buffer the zone of okness between two women, especially in a lesbian film, I groan and think about turning it off;  comments about the man being 'like a brother' make it worse. Does one really think that screwing their brother is a good explanation for not doing the same to the woman in front of them?
Still, I continued to watch because I wanted to see when Rosita would lose her accent. I secretly suspected she was Russian the whole time. I was gently surprised and happy when the two women developed some intimacy and Scarlet allowed herself to have some fun.
Was happy with the conclusion, though would have been happier if the conclusion happened about midway and went on from there, not for the sex, which is fairly non-existent, but for the deeper happiness and intimacy they gave each other. Maybe watching a movie about deep happiness, intimacy and romance would be boring. If you have tendency to see lesbian film as generally abysmal, I recommend. It's why I gave it three stars. I wasn't counting the minutes for it to end. There is a light-hearted quality. My opinion...",1387929600,3,1308,4.518987341772152

4906472,5,B001PNY1EC,"This was an extremely entertaining movie. It was funny,  romantic, and the actors did a good job portraying the characters. I will buy this movie so I can watch it again and then pass it along to friends. If you like romantic comedy, I recommend that you rent this movie. There was a delightful chemistry between the two female lead actors. I also liked it because it had a happy ending.",1384732800,3,387,4.450704225352113

4906474,4,B001PNY1EC,"Without a trailer it is often difficult to know what you will be getting.  I am glad I rented this movie.  I would recommend this as a light hearted story.  There were a few spots that seemed choppy, but overall it is worth a look.",1375401600,2,231,4.088888888888889
4906475,5,B001PNY1EC,"this movie had no trailer so I did not know what to expect. I selected it based on the two sentence description alone. To my surprise this film was well done! The storyline was well written. the actors were superb. there was character dynamic. The cinematography what flawless. Oh, and the movie was funny!! Also, it is one of the rare lesbian-themed films where there is a happy ending. I highly recommend it!",1324080000,10,410,4.63013698630137

4906477,5,B001PNY1EC,I thouroughly enjoyed this movie and have watched it several times. It is both light and funny. And the girl gets the girl in the end. How could anything be better.,1252368000,6,164,4.32258064516129

4906479,3,B001PNY1EC,"Spoiler: I really don't know how to rate this movie--I liked almost everything that actually made it into the film, but there is a gaping hole where all the plot resolution should be. It seriously feels as if the makers could not figure out how to solve the problems they had set up and just decided to skip to a wordless and beautiful happy ending. I am glad I watched it, but it left me gibbering in indignant disbelief.",1423008000,,422,4.3544303797468356

4906483,5,B001PNY1EC,"I thought this movie was hilarious.  Scarlet, a cold, calculating matchmaker, meets warm, affable Sabrina, the pseudo-actress/chef.  Scarlet's heart begins to thaw as she and Sabrina become closer.  I laughed a lot as I watched the movie.  A movie's supposed to make you feel emotions, whether they're good or bad, and ""What's Up, Scarlet?"" did exactly that.  I definitely recommend seeing this film.",1416528000,,400,5.285714285714286

4906485,3,B001PNY1EC,"For a lesbian movie, it is almost Oscar worthy, for a general movie... well, it is just OK if we are being generous. In short, there are plenty of other lesbian movies that suck way worse than this, I mean come on girls, you know deep down inside most of the films, god how I hate to even call them that, in the genre are gawd awful. But alas here we are, a market niche that is so desperate to see any sort of warped, funhouse reflection of our lives on screen, that we rate anything where we aren't the serial killer/stalker/mentally  ill character at least 3 stars. Come on, you know I'm right.",1413676800,,597,4.2368421052631575

4906490,2,B001PNY1EC,"Successful business-person crosses paths with a talented but down-and-out actor/chef. What starts out initially as a resentful, guilt-driven accommodation turns into a close friendship and then loving relationship. I'd like to see a well-done movie based on the same premise. It would probably be entertaining.

To be fair, the acting in this movie was all fairly well done. I didn't even realize a favorite of mine, Jere Burns, was in it until I started watching. The rest of the cast handled their roles reasonably well too, not counting the accents.

But the accents were the least of the problems. Though, I guess there was some amusement value in trying to guess how Sabrina was going to sound the next time she talked. The thing I couldn't figure out is, why do all these characters have to have accents? I mean, it's not like there was anything in the story that even relied on the character nationalities.

The broader issue was just the ham-handedness of the plot. The movie feels more like a point-by-point taxonomy of standard plot devices, than a smoothly moving story-telling. Main character is all work, no play. Check. Overbearing, critical mother. Check. Slacker, womanizing brother. Check. Generosity repaid by overstaying one's welcome. Check. Gradually working one's way into the other's heart. Check. Remarkably unlikely coincidence of events turns into a fracturing misunderstanding. Check.

The best part was when Sabrina cooks a meal for Scarlet and against all odds (given the hackneyed approach to the rest of the film), Scarlet's reaction was ""it's like canned minestrone, but better"". And, at least it had a happy ending.

But in the end, I found myself wishing I'd watched something else.",1406332800,3,1716,5.114285714285714
4906491,1,B001PNY1EC,Ten minutes of this was too much unless you want to learn new ways to use foul language.  Lousy acting and stupid story.,1402099200,,120,4.217391304347826
4906492,1,B001PNY1EC,I kept waiting to see where the movie was going to go.  The acting was poor.  The story line poor.  I hung with it thinking it was going to go somewhere but remained disappointed through out the movie.,1398729600,,201,4.2368421052631575

4906494,3,B001PNY1EC,I honestly just watched it because my name was Scarlet. The movie was OKAY. It was very predictable at points; especially after the brother calls Scarlet a lesbian.... The characters weren't really realistic. It was dramatacized a lot.,1392336000,,235,5.2105263157894735
4906495,5,B001PNY1EC,I really liked this movie  and both these women were excellent and the humor was good and also very serious,1391385600,,107,4.35
4906496,3,B001PNY1EC,"This film has some nice moments and the two actresses each have charisma although maybe not as a couple.  The mother and brother characters are a bit over the top, the accent slips in and out for the one actress but what keeps this from being a good movie vs. an okay movie is the editing especially at the end.  It's worth a look but probably not one to rave about.",1390867200,,366,4.140845070422535
