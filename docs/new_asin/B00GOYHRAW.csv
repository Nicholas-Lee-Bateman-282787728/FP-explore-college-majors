8625902,3,B00GOYHRAW,"VCI Entertainment usually releases wonderful DVDs with excellent prints, extra features, etc. sadly these ''new'' EL SANTO releases are a big disappointment. bad enough there are no theatrical trailers or photo galleries for the films, but they have absolutely NO SUBTITLES!!! how are English speaking people supposed to understand what is being said if they are not fluent in spanish? im very surprised VCI Entertainment would put out these lackluster DVDs just to make a quick buck. they could've at least tried to put in a little effort in them. a missed opportunity. :(",1392854400,16,573,5.1063829787234045
