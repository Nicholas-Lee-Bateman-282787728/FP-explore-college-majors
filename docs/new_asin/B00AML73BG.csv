5451302,5,B00AML73BG,"Timeless Media Group (TMG) will soon be releasing yet another great, nearly-forgotten television series that hasn't seen the light of day in fifty years. Well, fifty years is long enough to wait for this television gold mine.

After legendary actor Lee Marvin appeared in the TV crime classic ""M Squad"" and in numerous motion pictures, he decided to delve into another television series. This time he was the host of a syndicated series that first aired during the 1963-64 season. That series was titled ""Lee Marvin Presents: The Lawbreakers."" (also known as just ""Lawbreaker""), produced by United Artist Television.

There were a total of 32 episodes, each being 25 minutes long without commercials. All 32 episodes are included in this collection. One thing that is not known at this point is whether this collection will be in color or black and white. It seems that the series was filmed in color, and some cities' local television stations broadcast the series in color, while others broadcast it in black and white. In 1963, there were few color sets in homes, although those numbers were increasing at a large rate annually thanks to ""Bonanza"" and ""Walt Disney Presents,"" both early color series.

Also, filming a series in color for future color broadcast was not a new concept.  The last three seasons of  ""The Adventures of Superman"" were filmed in color, and all episodes of ""The Cisco Kid"" were filmed in color. Some TV markets with the equipment to broadcast in color in the 1950's and early 1960's did so to attract a wider audience and achieve higher ratings.

*UPDATE* There is a ""Lawbreaker"" trailer on the Timeless Media Group website that is in color. The colors are somewhat faded and the picture quality is not in a ""restored"" condition, but there is a good possibility that the ""Lawbreaker"" episodes will be presented in color as the producers intended.

As for ""Lee Marvin Presents: The Lawbreakers,"" this series was filmed documentary style with all stories carefully based on true police situations, oftentimes featuring the actual police personnel involved and the procedures and techniques used.  This real-life footage is edited in with recreated scenes, much like the reality crime shows of today.

While some of the episodes involved murders, robberies, and kidnappings, there were also plenty of other stories that focused on other areas of law enforcement. In fact, each featured city's law enforcement agency in the series was allowed to select a true crime story that it wanted to be told.

Here are a few sample episodes: ""The Miami Story"" is about the Miami police racing against the clock to find a bomb hidden in a synagogue; ""The Milwaukee Story"" tells of the Milwaukee police searching for a female gang of armed robbers; ""The Burbank Story"" is about Burbank police efforts to save a young boy who has fallen over a cliff; and ""The Dallas Story"" is about the Dallas police attempting to end a hostage-taking situation.

TMG is currently offering several other series from television's ""Golden Age"" that are anthology series with episodes based on true events. They are: ""West Point,"" ""The Lawless Years,"" and ""State Trooper"" and they are all excellent entertainment.

So if you are a Lee Marvin fan and you like your vintage television series with a lot of fast-paced action based on true events, then ""Lee Marvin Presents: The Lawbreakers"" may be just what the forensic scientist ordered. If we keep supporting companies like TMG, Shout! Factory, TGG, Image, and others then, hopefully, they will keep releasing these wonderful old series from American television's rich past.",1358640000,45,3617,5.030100334448161

5451326,4,B00AML73BG,"This series has not been aired since 1964.

It was the originator of the law enforcement documentary re-creations now common place on cable TV (48 HOURS, CITY CONFIDENTIAL, UNSOLVED MYSTERIES, etc.), but with a very unique twist.  The episodes (using a particular case from a city in the USA) had the ACTUAL officers/agents involved in the case ""acting"" out their own parts.  Hence, very bad acting, but still a historical piece of policing from 50 years ago.

One of the cases picked (from Miami in 1962) is of significant importance to me, as I never knew this video (nor the series) existed until last week.  I discovered my Dad (who died in 1992) played a very prominant role in this 1964 episode.  He never spoke of his work (or about this case) nor did he ever mention portraying his own self in the series.

Among other things, it was a true mind-blower for me!

I will definitely have my 3 children watch the grandfather they never met on TV in living color.

A family heirloom to be passed down to future generations of my kin, indeed.

If you are into documentaries, then this is a time capsule of how America's law enforcement departments handled crime in the early 1960's.

Very recommended!",1409961600,8,1203,4.654028436018957
5451327,1,B00AML73BG,"This show is terrible. Yeah it has Lee Marvin but it's not M-Squad. It's one of the first color broadcasts but the color is washed out. It's a ""pioneer"" show with real perpetrators, cops and victim which led to all the stupid ""reality"" cop shows. Marvin sits in a room with a TV monitor asking questions about a crime...the participants are the real people and therefore are terrible actors. I watched one episode and immediately sold it to a local exchange. Didn't even want to waste time trying to return it. Too bad I couldn't give it ZERO stars.",1409702400,2,549,4.555555555555555
5451328,5,B00AML73BG,"Here is an intelligently produced TV series, more of a docudrama/reality program, based on true crime files of various police departments across the nation. Several factors make this show unique. It is hosted by Lee Marvin who himself was known for playing criminal types and yet, ironically, does a very job in the role of host and narrator of this true crime TV show that recounts some of the nations' more interesting crimes of the late 1950's and early 60's.

This show was produced during the Kennedy administration and it is interesting to see all the old styles of cars, clothing, technology, etc. Marvin himself hosts the show from what appears to be some sort of set or room filled with the latest in TV technology at that time, in order for him to recount these harrowing stories. Unique aspects about the show are the people who reenact the scenes, many of whom were the original victims, cops, investigators, attorneys, eyewitnesses, etc.

Many of the convicted criminals were interviewed as well from the prisons they were eventually sent to and some were interviewed by Lee Marvin himself via remote control video teleconferencing, if such a thing existed back then. Or at least they made it appear that way in the editing. It still served to be very interesting.

This show was televised a few years before Dragnet but was not a drama like Dragnet, who always used actors. I particularly liked Lee Marvin's own analysis of the crimes his show recounted and his own statements, which seemed to be very original and spontaneous, though I suppose he had time to think beforehand what he was going to say because the show was not a live broadcast. All in all, Law Breaker is a very interesting docudrama of the early 1960's crime sprees that plagued America.",1407974400,,1769,4.79344262295082

5451333,4,B00AML73BG,"wow, what a walk down memory lane...pre-dating modern true crime shows like American Justice, The New Detectives and Forensic Files, this show was clearly ahead of its time...a strangely reverent Marvin (forget the tough guy cop of ""M Squad"" or the villianous Marvin from countless westerns) walks you through a crime/crimes each episode in a particular city...the acting in some of the re-creations is horrible, but that's okay in this context (nostalgia)..even a few of the actual criminals are interviewed by Marvin, acting here as an annoyed citizen..at the end, he speaks with either the police chief, sheriff or police director, each time addressing him as 'sir'..glad they released this set",1395878400,3,697,5.288288288288288

5451335,5,B00AML73BG,"This program is much like a time machine about crime and law enforcement of half a century ago in the USA.  From the historical viewpoint I find this most illuminating.  The DVD for an early colour TV program is of good quality.  Of course, the presence of Lee Marvin having 'no nonsense' interviews with actual criminals, adds greatly top the series.  Great stuff!",1389830400,,365,4.746031746031746
5451336,5,B00AML73BG,"I had a role in one of the segments of this series back in 1963. ""The Providence Story"" That was long before VCR's & DVR's. I've been looking for a copy for many years. I contacted United Artist and had a friend who is a movie director look into it with no results from either. I gave up about 20-25 years ago. While looking at Lee Marvin info on the Imdb web site I saw the series listed in his credits and it was highlighted. I clicked and it got me to Amazon and there it was as a new listing. Needless to say I was very excited. It had been 50 years since I'd seen myself on television. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. The seller was spot on with delivery and I wouldn't hesitate to buy from them again.",1378944000,7,708,4.028368794326241
5451337,5,B00AML73BG,"i didn't know that lee marvin hosted lawbreaker until earlier this year.  i found the series to be interesting to watch.  having the actual crime victims involved in the reenactments of the crimes adds to the drama of the stories.  actual police officers who were on the police force in their town or city at the time played either the crooks or murder victims in the reenactments of certain stories.  in one story, a disabled cop was protrayed by his brother in the reenactment.  true, the acting isn't professional, but that's because the people aren't actors.  the actual criminals involved in some of the crimes were interviewed.  some seemed remorseful of their criminal behavior, some were not.  one of the female criminals played herself in the reenactment under the surpervision of her parole officer.",1376092800,9,809,4.985074626865671
5451338,5,B00AML73BG,One of the first reality-based TV cop shows.  Great cast.  A real winner in my book.  Get it now. Yeah.,1375574400,3,103,4.05
5451339,1,B00AML73BG,"I consider the money expended on this incredibly tedious & boring series a total write-off, and my 'one star' rating of it far too generous! This is not a drama series featuring the esteemed talents of Lee Marvin, but rather a hokey reality show where Mr Marvin interviews ostensible criminals, victims, and enforcement officers. If you must purchase this DVD, wait for it to go on sale for under $2, unless you suffer from insomnia and are seeking possible non-medical solutions to assist you in falling to sleep!",1371340800,4,514,4.8522727272727275

5451342,5,B00AML73BG,"Lawbreaker host Lee Marvin interviews convicted criminals, often still in prison.  Sixties breaking news crews provide some of the footage; the rest are recreations.  Also interviewed are the victims & the policemen who captured the lawbreaker.",1368403200,2,244,5.75
5451343,3,B00AML73BG,"This set is PRESENTED by Lee Marvin. It is NOT a docudrama, but Marvin introduces you to the people actually involved in the case, & the acting parts usually include the actual people involved in the case, thus, the acting is usually pretty TERRIBLE (& that's being nice). Would have been much better if the story had been acted out, with real actors. The interviews with the bad guys (usually from prison) & other actual people involved is rather boring. I really couldn't recommend this to anyone. It's just not a good format.",1365984000,18,528,4.688172043010753
5451344,5,B00AML73BG,"I found this program to be unique because being made in the early 60's, it is in color, and used the actual party's involved in the crimes when possible. Marvin runs the show from his little studio, and it is interesting to see the crime story's through jailhouse, police, and victims interviews. They also do reenactments using these people, so while the acting isn't the best, it's still fun to watch. The picture quaility varies, but considering that they dug these out of the archives, I find it to be pretty good. I also like that they tour the major US cities, so you can get cross-section of crime and law enforcement techniques during this time period.",1364688000,14,660,4.64957264957265
5451345,4,B00AML73BG,"When I first saw this set come out on Amazon. I thought it was a show in the same vein as Lee Marvin's M-Squad series. But this show is different! You might say it was a precurser to today's reality shows. Using real crime stories with the
actual people involved. Featuring a different story from both major & minor cities
across America during the 1960s. A sort of time capsule look into just how the problem of urban and youth crime
was. And still is today 60 years later!
PS. It is also a look into just how awful looking 60s fashions were. Not to mention how really ugly American cars were too. Even though a mint condition 1963 Chevy Impala with original equipment. Would
be worth around $75,000.00 today!",1364601600,7,710,4.469230769230769
