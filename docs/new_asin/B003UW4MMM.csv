8406246,5,B003UW4MMM,I ve done argentine tango for 15 years.  every week for the last 7 years. I've been teaching for the last 2 years.  2 mins in I said this is a good disc.  this is a adv beginner disc.  someone with no dance or no tango experience will not be able to appreciate the quality of this disc.  I buy a lot of tango discs.  I lend some out to students. some I don't care if they don't come back.  this one I would have to purchase again if lost.  nothing is perfect.  like the dance itself this disc is masculine based on the lead with little on the follow.  this is not abnormal as most discs produced in argentina are not heavily invested into the woman's part in the dance. I don't think this disc is produced anymore so get a copy before they are all gone. also this disc is in open embrace and almost all intermediate dancers dance close embrace.  long beach ca,1396396800,,859,4.114457831325301
