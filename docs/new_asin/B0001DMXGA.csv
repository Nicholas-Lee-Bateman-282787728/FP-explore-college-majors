8011006,4,B0001DMXGA,"The White Gorilla (1945)

Comprised of two films, one being a short/silent film made some time around the 1930's, and the second being made in 1945, with narration overdubbed over the original silent.

Starring the then big star Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan, The White Gorilla was a land mark horror film.

Africa's fate is decided in a final face off between a rare white gorilla is excommunicated from the rest of the gorillas due to his outlandish nature and appearance. As the white gorilla is forced to live a life of solitude, the time by himself turns him into a primate hating, killing machine. As he returns to face his former tribe leader in one last showdown things begin to get interesting.

For 1945 this is a surprisingly well written plot and and entertaining film. For fans of classic horror, The White Gorilla is right up your tree.",1212883200,3,841,4.700680272108843
8011007,3,B0001DMXGA,"Strictly guilty pleasure. Round up your friends, get them pleasantly sauced and let it rip. This is an ""interactive"" experience: one of these god-awful movies made out of thin air that requires you jive at the screen. To complete the setup of the evening require that your guests come in 1930's Hollywood jungle get-up...",1178928000,2,321,4.962962962962963
8011008,5,B0001DMXGA,"""White Gorilla"" is actually two movies in one, with the present-day footage shot around a  silent serial made twenty years before. The silent feature, ""Perils of the Jungle"" stars Frank Merrill, the fifth screen Tarzan, and concerns a young woman and her father, who are searching for treasure in the African jungle. They encounter Merrill, a strange jungle boy (Bobby Nelson) and his mother, who is the priestess to a cult of tiger men. They worship the stature of a Cyclops, whose arms are moved secretly by the jungle boy.

As if that wasn't enough, the `present day' story concerns a guide (Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan) who arrives injured at a trading post. He was injured by the legendary white gorilla. The gorilla was cast out of his family because of his color and takes out his anger on everyone he encounters. He narrates the tale of the silent feature, witnesses the battle between the black gorilla and the white gorilla (also Corrigan), and does other silly things as he reacts to twenty-year old footage. Watch two men in gorilla suits fight it out. Watch our narrator as he reacts to unseen footage. Watch the bad acting of those in the trading post. Total entertainment! A film that would've made Ed Wood, Jr. jealous.",1106179200,3,1228,4.76056338028169
