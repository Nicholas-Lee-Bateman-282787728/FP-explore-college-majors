I remember watching Tom Green several years ago when I was 8 or 9. I didn't understand it then, but this is just the funniest thing I own. It's too bad, Tom should have stuck minimal publicity and maybe his show would still be on. But no, MTV had to make him a big star and put everywhere you look. And now people recognize him. At least I've heard that's how his show ended. But you've still got Hollywood causes cancer released in 2004. His newest bit.",1121212800,,659,4.272
