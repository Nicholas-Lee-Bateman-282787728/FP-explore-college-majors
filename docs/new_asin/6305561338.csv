7891478,4,6305561338,"First off, I noticed the huge improvement of graphics in this movie compared to its predecessors. The art wasn't bad in the other films, but this one just looks newer. This one follows the same structure as all of the previous movies, and this episode's ""woman-in-distress"", Emily, is actually good looking, unlike Nina from .357 Magnum, and she looks like a woman, unlike Emi from the Motion Picture! Million Dollar Conspiracy is almost as good as Bay City Wars in the humor department. The climax was disappointing, because City Hunter is put up against a guy who's just plain ... at fighting, and an idiot at everything except building exploding toys. The final part of the climax was cheesy (and I'm usually cheese tolerant) and totally predictable. Also, the dubbing for the supporting roles is surprisingly corny this time and the action scenes aren't that great by City Hunter standards. On the plus side, the plot is pretty good and it kept me more interested in what would happen next than the Motion Picture or .327 Magnum ever did. There are actually a few good plot twists on the way, too. Due to its shorter length, the story is faster-paced, which is also a good thing. It's a fun, fast City Hunter story that all fans should pick up.",992908800,,1248,4.703196347031963
7891479,3,6305561338,"This is the third of the City Hunter OVAs, and has substantially more story than the previous OVA, Bay City Wars.  If you have seen the City Hunter series before, you will feel like this story is predictable, leaving you somewhat not interested in the rest of the story.  Persevere, please.  People who have not seen the series perhaps will not be as disappointed.  Again I feel this stroy is not particularly suited for an OVA.  There are plenty of other stories in the series which are worthier of the OVA treatment.",979689600,,518,4.586956521739131
7891480,4,6305561338,"I must say that I am a rather die hard fan of City Hunter, lets face it I actually bought a copy of ""City Hunter: 357. Magnum"" and I will say that I was not dissapointed with ""City Hunter: Million Dollar  Conspiracy"". Once again Joe, a.k.a. City Hunter is caught with a  beautiful woman who needs his help, what's new? Acctually the new part is  that she is actually going to pay him, one million dollars, yet is she  evrything she say's she is. As a deadly hitman from L.A. arrives in L.A.  Joe is a about to gain more than he bargained for, this is not including  the number of times that his partner Kori beats the living hell out of him  with a giant hammer. The animation is the same quality as ""City  Hunter: Bay City War"" which for those of you whom have not seen that  title the animation is average. The music is o.k. For those of you looking  for high level energy with a great shoot out that is almost reminisent of  the great John Woo this is a great film. The comedy in this volume is  proble the best in the series since ""City Hunter: the Motion  Picture"". Not as much action as the other videos in this series had.  Yet this is made up with the story line that is not as predictable as the  other plot lines in this series. Warning this video contains brief nudity,  violence, and language.",961200000,,1305,4.222672064777328
