8604024,5,B00ECXJC1Y,"This is Rene Clair at his best: A new version of the Faust story with Faust and Mephisto both played by the same two actors. Mephiisto traps Faust into signing a contract and changes shapes with him, so that everyone thinks that Mephisto is the real Dr. Faust.  This leads into a different, but satisfying ending.",1461456000,,313,4.589285714285714
8604025,3,B00ECXJC1Y,"I first saw this movie (a retelling of the Faust story) around 1950, when I was a teenager, and it became my favorite movie.  I saw it at least three times.  I found it exceptionally funny.  In recent years I tried to see it again, but found no version with subtitles, so when this version appeared I immediately rented and watched it.  Frankly, I was disappointed!  I really couldn't see what I had found so funny all those years ago!  Still, it is nice movie that reflects the era when it was made. .",1433894400,,502,4.287234042553192

8604029,5,B00ECXJC1Y,"This is the first of three masterpieces - and perhaps the greatest of them - in which Rene Clair found a new style.  (The successors were LES BELLES DE NUIT and LES GRANDES MANOEUVRES.)  Penelope Houston compared them to the eighteenth-century French contes philosophiques.  (Why are there no italics available on this site?)  Clair should, indeed, have filmed CANDIDE (and Gerald Philipe would have been perfect casting).  Alas, after MANOEUVRES Clair reverted to his 1930s style, with PORTE DES LILAS, and very tired it looked.  It was my personal misfortune that I had bought Gaumont's edition of LA BEAUTE DU DIABLE, and struggled with the French subtitles for French sourds et malendendants, before I learned of the almost simultaneous appearance of the Cohen edition.  In spite of what I have said about a new style, Clair's best Hollywood film, I MARRIED A WITCH (restored by Criterion) is similar to BEAUTE in its characterisation of the Devil's representative.  The warlock father in WITCH, and Mephistopheles in BEAUTE, display a comparable glee in their mischief.  (The special meaning of 'la beaute du diable' - the  transitory bloom of a young girl not otherwise beautiful - does not seem to have anything to do with the film.)  There is a good dvd of GRANDES MANOEUVRES, a film whose use of colour is in the Jean Renoir - or Vincente Minnelli - class.  There is a blu-ray of LES BELLES DE NUIT, available from French Amazon.  It does not say that it is restored but it seems likely.  Unfortunately, there are French subtitles only. Also unfortunately, it would not play on my player.  I told French Amazon, who sent another which wouldn't play either.  Gaumont, who issued it, have ignored my request for an explanation.  There the matter rests.",1391126400,3,1759,4.908474576271186
