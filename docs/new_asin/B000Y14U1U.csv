Saint Bernadette, born Marie-Bernarde Soubirous (January 7, 1844 - April 16, 1879), was a miller's daughter from the town of Lourdes in southern France --- Her real Occitan name is Maria Bernada Soubirous, aka Bernadeta (little Bernada). From February 11, to July 16, 1858, she reported eighteen apparitions of ""a Lady."" --- Despite initial skepticism from the Roman Catholic Church, these claims were eventually declared to be worthy of belief after a canonical investigation --- After her death, Bernadette's body remained ""incorruptible"", and the shrine at Lourdes went on to become a major site for pilgrimage, attracting millions of Catholics each year --- On December 8th, 1933 she was canonized as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

She was beatified in 1925 and canonized in 1933 by Pope Pius XI, not so much for the content of her visions, but rather for her simplicity, humility and holiness of life. She is the patron saint of sick persons and of Lourdes --- Released to honor the 150th Anniversary of the apparitions at Lourdes -- Director Robert Darene

8230656,5,B000Y14U1U,"You can't compare this version to the well made Song of Bernadette, but I still like it very much.  In some ways it is more mysterious and peaceful than the Song of Bernadette.  Buy this movie not as a comparison but as a great stand alone movie.  The acting is great.  I have bought several copies to give as gifts.",1512864000,,316,4.216666666666667

8230658,4,B000Y14U1U,"This is the famous story of Bernadette Soubirous, a young girl who lived in poverty in Lourdes, France during the mid nineteenth century. She had 18 visions of the Blessed Virgin Mary in a grotto used as a garbage dump, and is responsible for having a cathedral built there. She also dug up the spring that still flows with water that has curative powers.

This story has been told many times, and there have been many movies made of it. This one tells the details of the story fairly accurately, but it is not the most memorable. The actress who portrays Bernadette is an excellent actress, but she does not at all resemble the dark-haired fourteen- year- old of the Pays-Basque region of southern France. This film gives the details of the story, but it is by far not the most moving version.",1398470400,,794,4.5524475524475525
8230659,4,B000Y14U1U,"I have the films, Bernadette starring Sydney Penny and Je m'appelle Bernadette starring Katia Miran. I bought this DVD to add to my Bernadette collection.  I did not expect too much as it was made in 1960 and was in black and white. After viewing the film I am quite surprised, I really enjoyed it. It's very difficult to have an actor play Bernadette as she was only 4'7"" tall, although Danielle Ajoret did not resemble Bernadette she played a very good part in my opinion, especially the scenes in the Convent @ Nevers.  The black and white setting suited me just fine as it seemed to depict the aura of the times.  The film itself was surprisingly very historically accurate, more so than the 1943 Song of Bernadette which was ""Hollywood"" made.  I recommend this movie for people who want to know more about Bernadette; her life, her struggles, and her piety.",1361750400,6,862,4.61437908496732
8230660,4,B000Y14U1U,"this is one of our least favorite stories of Sainte Bernardette Subirou - although we like it, is also rather short and a blonde St Bernardette with blue eyes just doesn't make it for me....",1361491200,,190,4.457142857142857
8230661,3,B000Y14U1U,"This was inspiring film - black and white version.
I did enjoy watching it.
Although, I thought it was the coloured version on
that is always shown on TV at Easter time.",1306454400,,169,4.3125
8230662,2,B000Y14U1U,"It is an okay movie.  It pales in comparison to The Song Of Bernadette, which won four (4) Academy Awards (1943).  The script in this movie needs to be revisited and the director more sensitive to the subject matter.  Plenty of parts left out and the movie suffers from it.  You need to see The Song Of Bernadette to understand the difference.  You will probably buy the version as I did.  It is remarkable and a classic.",1241308800,3,421,4.402597402597403

8230665,4,B000Y14U1U,"Though produced in 1962, the b/w French film `Bernadette of Lourdes' has the look and feel of a much older film. If I were to have ventured a guess I would have said it was produced sometime between '35 and '39. This ""feel"" of greater age seems to add to the overall feel of sanctity and Catholic spirituality that pervades this film from beginning to end.

Believer or not, the viewer cannot hep but perceive a sense of the eternal in this traditional and reverent adaptation of the life, visions and vocation of the beloved Saint Bernadette Soubirous who was graced by 18 apparitions of a beautiful ""Lady in White"" in 1858.  Daniele Ajoret's portrayal of the poor, ""good for nothing"" peasant girl named Bernadette is endearing, believable and spirited.

My Rating: `Bernadette of Lourdes' is definitely geared to a specific audience (i.e.: Catholics) but that doesn't mean there isn't something of value here for the seeker or just plain curious: -4 1/2 Stars-.",1218326400,13,963,4.859756097560975
