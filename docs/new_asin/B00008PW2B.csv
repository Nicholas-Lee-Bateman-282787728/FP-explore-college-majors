To have an effective routine that can be done in 10 minutes is extremely helpful, and to have one that is as effective as this is really welcome!

 Noelle starts with the hundred, which to me is an almost magical exercise. I can't think of any exercise that warms me up better than this and I always like Pilates programs that start with it (I have many that are excellent programs, non-traditional pilates, that don't start with it so it's not always a given).

 After that she continues on with the rollup and other exercises from the stomach series such as the single leg stretch, scissors, criss cross etc..

 There are also some unique versions of exercises, such as a bridge type exercise where you lift each side of the hip one at a time in the full bridge position. It is a very interesting variation on a bridge that really warmed up that area in a way that I've not encountered before.

 Also there is a leg raising exercise where you bend one leg, place your heel of the opposite foot on the knee of the bent leg, scoop up and then do leg raises. This is something I've never seen in any of the Pilates programs that I have and I have quite a few.

 All in all, for a short program, you get a nice focused workout that is very effective.

 Noelle is a really enjoyable teacher, she has a lot of energy but doesn't cross the line into being overly peppy. I found her to be very motivating to work with and her instructions were clear and to the point which made the practice really flow.

 Other ten minute Pilate programs I'd recommend are the ""Quick Fix-Pilates Abs"" and the ""Quick Fix- Total Mix"" which has  four ten minute Pilates and four-ten minute Yoga routines which you can sequence using a ""blender"" which lets you select three programs in any order.

 Also, Liz Gillies Progressive Pilates Target Tone DVD is an excellent DVD w/ four Ten Minute routines that focus on Abs, Hips, Buns and also a Total body workout.",1161907200,7,2143,4.423469387755102
