194645,4,1573471917,I am Jack Deth and I'm about to take you to the world of Trancers. Trancers are demons who love world domination but future cop Jack Deth won't alow it. Watch this movie as Jack Deth kicks serious booty. This is a good movie and the music is wonderful. Not everyone will like this though. Mostly adults but I found this a thrilling adventure for all to enjoy!,1010188800,,359,4.294117647058823
194646,4,1573471917,Great movie to see but see this one to understand the story better than watching the second first. lol I was hooked by the second and wanted to see the first.  Great sci-fi movie to see,1008633600,,185,4.138888888888889
194647,4,1573471917,"I really enjoyed the second movie ""Trancer's 2: Return of Jack Deth"" which got me hooked to Trancers. ""Trancers"" is a great sci-fi  movie to watch, and hope others care to watch it.",1008633600,,181,4.484848484848484
194648,2,1573471917,"After waiting years for a excellent copy of one of my favorite movies, I  was very disappointed when I received this in the mail. First of all, this  is advertised as WIDESCREEN when it is NOT! There is no Widescreen version  of this available. There is also no full moon featurette on trancers either.  secondly, halfway thru the movie I notice the screen going black for a  couple of seconds. No biggie.. Later, after the end credits come up, The  Vestron Video Logo comes on, then it says  END OF SIDE TWO!!! This DVD is  nothing but a copy of the Laser disc transfer that Vestron did quite a few  years ago. The quality of the print is not very good, color is weak and  images not very sharp, with the film having several cig. burns in it. Come  on Full Moon, get your act together, and spend a few bucks to do this movie  justice. I would much rather see a widescreen version of this than any of  the other so called sequels..One nice note, the flip-side of the DVD does  have over 40 trailers for all of the other Full-Moon Videos, but if they  look anything like this one, I will not spend the money.",965606400,28,1107,4.280193236714976
194649,3,1573471917,"You can say what you like about this film, but you have to admit it is fun. I had been trying buy it for years and was pleased to see its release on DVD. On the DVD its self there isn't much, the picture quality is okay,  but who knows where they got the footage from. It fades to black from time  to time like its taken from a TV version with the Ad's cut out. And it  still has the 'cigarette burns' in the corner ever real for the  Projectionist. All i can say is, can we have Trancers II now?",963792000,,496,3.8333333333333335
194650,3,1573471917,"I mean, so much is really missing in this movie. that I would usually mark and give horrorble grades for...
But as people said... One thing that has not been lost. I just had plan out fun watching this movie.
Tim like many  say, even though his Hands WERE acting MESSED UP when driving that car. Is  a man I really wish I've seen alot more of in action films. with the right  direction's he really could be (What Dollman was actully trying to be) The  next Dirty Harry.
ANd one thing.. DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN! HELEN Hunt! Now  I've never seen many of her early movies. I do like her acting.  She is  well deserved of her acting fame. but DAMN SHE IS SOOOOO GOOD LOOKING IN  THIS MOVIE!  I'm just like damn! I never would have thought she ever  looked this GOOD! I mean she looks ok intodays standards. and I Really  enjoy her personality. in any thing that's what really works for me.
but  had to commet on that.. OK now back to the movie.
This movies special  effects.. when I first saw them, I said right away.. You got to to kidding.  as the movie wen't on, I got into it more. and more and more. I have bought  all but 5 right about now.. I have only watched this one.
But I'm looking  forward to actully viewing all 5 of them....",960595200,2,1231,4.1525423728813555
194651,4,1573471917,"TRANCERS holds up as a low-budget guilty pleasure even 14 years after it was first released. Tim Thomerson gives a dopey tough-guy-heroic performance and manages to slyly parody noir tough guys at the same time. Helen Hunt is sexy and droll and, even at a young age, provides glimpses of  the accomplished Academy-Award-winning actress she would become. Her  emotional range and flair for comedy help elevate TRANCERS above the 100  other TERMINATOR type movies that came out in the '80s.
The screenplay by  Paul De Meo and Danny Bilson is really the best thing here. It mixes humor  and sci-fi action and manages a few fresh touches, which given the  time-travel plot is truly impressive. Veteran schlockmeister Charles Band  somehow generates visual atmosphere despite the $1.98 budget.
If you like  dashes of smart humor, check it out. In terms of its cheesier moments, my  favorite is the unintentional ""flying car"" effect ... Thomerson  and Hunt being towed in a tiny convertible for a routine driving sequence  on a camera-trailer so high off the road they look like they're levitating  (while a two-handed Thomerson ludicrously swings the steering wheel side to  side as if he's riding the bumper cars!).
Overall, inventive in an  enjoyably dumb way.",954201600,2,1257,5.068292682926829
194652,4,1573471917,This movie really was great in a way. The plot and premise are very intersting the acting par with any Shwarzenegger film. But the directing was awful! It would have been a much better and probably more succesful  comic book series. Overal a worthwile movie. It's great their putting it  out on DVD never in my wildest dreams!. I mean the video has been out of  print for years!. Thomerson rocks!,953856000,,396,4.549295774647887
194653,4,1573471917,"TRANCERS is the first in a 5 movie series (thus far)that deals with time travel, mind control, and a cop with attitude...Jack Deth. Jack's mission is to hunt down and destroy the member's of a psychic cult of  ""zombie-like"" creatures called TRANCERS. The movie takes place in  2247 and in 1985 with Jack Deth going back in time to destoy the evil  Trancers.
This movie is filled with action and some pretty good drama,  but is not a big budgited movie. If you enjoy time-travel, sci-fi and  action you would enjoy this film. It also stars Helen Hunt in the early  days of her acting profession as Lena, Jack's friend and co  ""Trancer-hunter"".",911779200,,642,4.628318584070796

I originally purchased this movie because it got good reviews and I have always enjoyed Tim Thomerson's acting, he usually plays the tough guy and has the attitude to pull it off. I'm not a huge sci-fi fan but I do enjoy a well told, and well acted tale. Trancers is fun and entertaining and I'm sure I will watch it again.",1472688000,2,466,4.367816091954023

Not only does it combine elements of Blade Runner, The Terminator and Dawn of the Dead (there are zombies in this by the way) but it also captures cult favorite actor Tim Thomerson and legendary B Movie Director Charles Band at their absolute peak. What makes this one even more
impressive is the fact that it was made for less than $1000000 and has a pre Oscar winning Helen Hunt. Also spawned 5 sequels.",1471737600,4,500,4.566666666666666

194680,5,1573471917,"This may be one of my new favorite guilty pleasures. Right up there with ""Big Trouble in Little China."" In fact, if you liked that movie, I think you'll like this one (and vice versa). Both have that weird, rather unique feel of a live action cartoon, and of the movie-makers not really taking themselves too seriously. The whole thing seems to parody itself, but it does so with a lot of joy and good fun. Like in Big Trouble in Little China, there are some good one-liners and some genuinely good acting to round the whole thing out.

If you want a serious movie, that makes sense and is in any way plausible, you are way, way off course.
If you're a fan of all things sci-fi, and don't mind movies that poke fun at themselves, I think you'll like this.
If Big Trouble in Little China had a threesome with Blade Runner and Helen Hunt, Trancers might be their delightfully weird offspring.",1446768000,,890,4.426829268292683

194682,5,1573471917,"I just finished watching it and I haven't looked anything up or done any searches, but there has to be a clutch of people who were involved in all three of these films. I'm a fan of Terminator and a bigger fan of Blade Runner.  Trancers contains Themes and Story Elements from both of them - and, I think it's certainly a much funner story. While it's not up to the same technical level, that has to just be budget related. It's not a cheap knock off either.
It avoids cute ""in"" jokes about the '80s, and silly paradoxes like other time travel movies. It doesn't have big special effects by any means, and that's fine.  Helen Hunt is/was quite a looker! Tim Thomerson is great.  You've seen many of the other actors and actresses, probably dozens of times. Plus Punk (mild) versions of Christmas Standards!

194684,2,1573471917,"Trancers has its fans. I am glad for them, that they not only have this one, but many other ""Son of Trancers"" movies to choose from. I can't even dance around this--Tim Thomerson is terrible. Why would newly minted actress Helen Hunt spend even ten seconds with him? No paycheck could be large enough. It isn't all bad. The 80s vibe is delicious, and there are a lot of great outfits and nostalgia. The plot isn't the worst ever, but every time Tim is called to carry a scene, my brain implodes rather than watch him. Tim on a moped is my favorite scene, as it showcases the absurdity of him trying to make this storyline into a believable premise. This movie needed a full on motorcycle actor to pull it off.",1445731200,,709,4.378787878787879

Not because it's the best movie ever - but because it was a pretty typical movie set from the future to the present which was the past released in 1984. Yes, exactly. Helen Hunt (who's just a year younger than me) was in this and I'm surprised I never saw it - then again this was my senior year in college and I was watching ET over and over. It is by no means the best story - or the best acting.. but seeing how things were in - scenery, etc... was fun.

194723,4,1573471917,"It's not often that you'll run across a low budget gem similar to The Terminator, in fact it almost never happens. While this is not necessarily an example of that happening it is a pretty cool trashy 80's sci-fi flick that deserves some recognition. No doubt hugely influenced by Blade Runner, the first few minutes of this movie shows off a pretty creative futuristic world haunted by things known as 'Trancers', not quite Replicants and not quite zombies.

If you can allow yourself to enjoy a movie that was clearly made off of an incredibly low budget ($300k) with pretty cheesy and clich dialogue (part of it's charm) then you'll appreciate what Trancers has to offer. You'll also get to see a very young (and pretty) Helen Hunt doing a movie that she probably tried very hard to bury in her filmography.

After quitting the force in disgust, Deth is brought back in order to locate, capture, and bring in an infamous, super-criminal named Whistler (Michael Stefani). This is of special interest to Deth, since Whistler murdered his father. The problem is that Jack must go back in time, to a pre-quake Los Angeles. All the way back to 1985! He assumes a pre-arranged identity, complete w/ girlfriend, Leena (Helen Hunt). Jack -now in the body of Phil, an ancestor- finds out rather quickly that Whistler's zombie minions, known as TRANCERS, are everywhere. Leena gets caught up in the adventure, and they're off! Like a crazy combination of BLADERUNNER, THE TERMINATOR, and NIGHT OF THE CREEPS, this is easily the best movie that Director Charles Band ever made. Some of the ideas, like the time-slowing, ""long second"" watch, and the method of time-travel, pre-figure some well-known images from THE MATRIX. One cannot watch this without thinking ""Hey! That's bullet time!"". TRANCERS is a low-budget movie that makes every penny count, and it's a lot of fun to watch! Some classic scenes include the killer waitress and killer Santa.

Telma Hopkins, Art LaFluer and child actress Alyson Kroft all deliver pivotal supporting roles that round out the TRANCERS world in humorous and compelling ways.

It's nice to see this film get a solid release that treats it with respect and caters to the fans of the franchise. TRANCERS should entertain you IF you don't go in expecting a zillion dollar tentpole feature. It's slick little B-film fun that works extremely well in spite of its budgetary constraints. 4 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers):  In the year 2247, retired police detective (trooper) Jack Deth spends his time diving for trinkets in the sunken ruins of Los Angeles. (L.A. sank along with most of the west coast during ""The Big Quake"" at some unspecified future date.) Jack's old boss tracks him down and informs him that Martin Whistler, a notorious criminal whom Jack thought he'd killed long ago, has managed to escape into the distant past. His scheme? Eliminate all three members of the current ruling High Council tribunal by killing their ancient relatives, thereby wiping out the government of 2247 and opening the door for Martin Whistler return and take over as the undisputed ruler of Lost Angeles. He's already killed one of the descendants and is gunning for the other two. Jack volunteers to be sent ""down the line"" to catch Whistler and bring him back - on his own terms, of course. Our scruffy, disillusioned future hero is going to have his hands full in the distant past of 1985; the relative that Martin Whistler has taken over is a high-ranking L.A. police official who's anticipating Jack's arrival - and is prepared to stop him at any cost.

Traveling to the past, Deth inhabits the body of his ancestor, Phillip, a journalist. Fortunately for Jack, Phil's latest one night stand is none other than a young, vivacious Helen Hunt (Twister, Mad About You, As Good As It Gets, etc.). She plays Leena, a quirky punk girl who has a seasonal job as a photographer/helper elf at the North Pole Christmas display at a local shopping center. When Jack drops Leena off at the mall he's viciously attacked by the department store Santa who's been turned into a ""Trancer"" (a sort of zombie) by the evil Whistler.  The 'tranced' Santa recognizes Deth and tries to kill him (much to the horror of several little kids waiting to get their picture taken with Ol' Saint Nick!). Afterwards, Jack is forced to tell Leena the truth about who he is and what he's there to do, in order to convince her to guide him around the city and track down the future leaders' relatives. Obviously skeptical at first, Leena is eventually convinced by Jack's reasoning and agrees to help. (Seeing her co-worker turn from jolly Kris Kringle into a rotting homicidal maniac before her startled eyes probably didn't hurt either.) With Whistler hot on their trail and time running out Jack & Leena attempt to locate the two remaining relatives of the future high council members and stop Whistler, who meanwhile continues to recruit & convert weak-willed people into violent killers that he sends after Jack & Leena. Further complications ensue when Jack finds himself unwittingly falling for the innocent, free-spirited Leena. He realizes that if he survives this mission he'll be forced to make a difficult choice: return to the future where he belongs ...or remain in the strange and unfamiliar past with Leena.

THOUGHTS: Charles Band's Full Moon Pictures give us one of their best offerings with this Blu-ray release of 1984's ""TRANCERS"" - an engaging time-travel adventure that's a film noir tribute to the Sam Spade / Phillip Marlowe films of the 1940's by way of Blade Runner.  Tim Thomerson is terrific as the sweetly named Jack Deth. Helen Hunt turns in a spunky, energetic performance as Leena. Thomerson has lots of charisma and he and Hunt have great chemistry together. The other cast members (including Art LaFleur & Thelma Ritter) give pretty good performances, with a standout being the amusing Biff Maynard as one of the future leader's relatives; a former big league pitcher who fell on hard times and now lives in a skid row flophouse. Standard by-the-numbers direction by Charles Band and typical Full Moon/Empire ultra low budget sets & VFX are weak links, but I must admit that some of the low buck trappings are actually pretty creative, given the budgetary limitations. The film is fun and certainly must have struck a chord with people because TRANCERS has spawned seven(!) sequels at last count.

THE BLU-RAY: Picture & sound quality of the hi-def release of TRANCERS is decent but nothing to stun the senses. Video portion is solid, with minimal artifacting & pixelation. (This is a good thing since much of the film takes place in dark buildings and at night.) While the film looks better than a standard DVD, it's certainly nothing like the ultra-sharp picture you get in expensively restored films like GONE WITH THE WIND or BEN -HUR. But keep in mind that this is a low budget film from a small company. I wasn't expecting anything amazing, and that's exactly what I got. LOL. Sound levels are strong & consistent. Some nice bonus features really up the value of this Blu-ray release of TRANCERS. Among them are a newly shot retrospective piece, a full-length commentary track with Tim Thomerson & producer/director Charles Band, archive interviews, a still gallery and a separate short sequel film ""Trancers: City of Angels"" which reunites Thomerson & Hunt, along with original film co-stars Thelma Ritter and Art Lafleur. CITY OF ANGELS is minimalist fun, just like the main feature itself.",1426636800,5,5521,4.892094017094017

Tim Thomerson is an actor who should have had a bigger career (or at least become a bigger star) he has kind of a Robert Mitchum swagger coupled with solid comic timing.

Amazon streams it here (as of December 2014) in the old Academy aspect ratio of: 1.37:0 (aka 4:3)

This means, it is being presented in either Full Screen (un-blocked) or, even worse, Pan&Scan. Either way, it's horrific!
The movie probably is in HD but who cares when you're not seeing the proper aspect ratio?!!!

194979,4,1573471917,"In the early 1990s, my Friday and Saturday nights were spent at home watching movie after movie of whatever I could find in my local video store. I would first scour the shelves for the newest horror, sci-fi, or action flicks and then move on to older or lesser known titles. Thus, my love affair with Full Moon Features and straight-to-video fare began.

I would literally scoop up anything with a Full Moon logo on it and spend hours in the dark of my living room devouring Subspecies, Puppet Master, Demonic Toys, Robot Jox, and anything else I could get my hands on. The Trancers movies were among those B-movie gems I would pick up.

Full Moon Entertainment recently released Trancers: The Ultimate Edition on Blu-ray for those of us wanting to relive the dawn of the straight-to-video age and hopefully introduce these priceless films to a whole new generation. Lets face it. Without Charles Band and Full Moon Features, there wouldnt be the Asylum, SyFy Channel, Anchor Bay, or any other independent genre companies giving us Sharknado, Mega Piranha, and Metal Shifters.

Jack Deth (Tim Thomerson) is an Angel City trooper sent back in time to the Los Angeles of 1985. He is assigned to inhabit the body of his ancestor in order to find his arch-enemy, Whistler (Michael Stefani), who turns people into zombies. Deth must stop him before is able to kill all the ancestors of the members of the future governing council.

Trancers: The Ultimate Edition is a perfect example of everything Full Moon and Charles Band was creating in the early and mid-1980s. Its obvious they saw blockbuster films and wanted to make their own low-budget versions of them for genre fans to enjoy. After all, once you saw Blade Runner, The Terminator, and Total Recall, where could you get more of those types of entertainment to enjoy? Band and his army of filmmakers filled that niche perfectly.

You don't get any more 1980s than Trancers. As the director and producer of the movie, Charles Band injected it with as much noir flavor as he could wring out of Blade Runner without being sued for plagiarism. Youve got the long trench coats with the added flare of shoulder pads. Couple that with weird bolos, shirt collars, and ties and you have a futuristic beat cop ready to take down any zombie or android he comes up against in the past.

Lets not forget Helen Hunts crazy puffed-up hair and her fixation with punk rock. Just like Kyle Reese in James Camerons The Terminator, Jack Deth somehow makes his way into a nightclub to enjoy some tunes from a bygone era as he pursues his murderous target. Like they say, Imitation is the greatest form of flattery.

Although Trancers has been remastered in high-definition, the video quality is far from perfect. The picture is still better than its ever looked before, but contains some pops and scratches here and there. Its about the best you could expect from a B-movie which was probably not always stored under the best of conditions. Its presented with 5.1 stereo surround which will give viewers a more immersive experience when it comes to all the laser fire and environmental sounds you expect from a sci-fi flick.

The bonus material for Trancers: The Ultimate Edition will make collectors happy. Audio commentary is provided by Actor Tim Thomerson and Director / Producer Charles Band. Daniel Griffiths Trancers featurette and a rare interview with Tim Thomerson, Helen Hunt, and Megan Ward are included. The complete Trancers: City of Lost Angels segment from the anthology film Pulsepounders is found as well. It doesnt appear to have been cleaned up or remastered at all. A rare still gallery rounds out the special features.

Trancers: The Ultimate Edition is unrated, but would be worthy of a PG-13 if put before the MPAA. There are some adult situations with no nudity. The language and violence is what you would expect from any genre movie these days.

All in all, enthusiasts of 1980s B-movies will love ""Trancers: The Ultimate Edition."" The film is filled with fun practical effects, film noir overtones, and plenty of action for everyone to enjoy. Even with a less than spectacular video transfer, its an essential item for any sci-fi devotees home entertainment library.",1412121600,8,4227,4.858333333333333

194988,5,1573471917,"Scrap the old DVD release of this classic film which is in Full screen anyway
and get this all new ULTIMATE EDITION of TRANCERS Supervised by Charles band himself
an All new High Definition transfer in Widescreen format, incredible picture quality
Definitely an improvement from the DVD release, the picture quality looks very clear and crisp on blu-ray
the old Stereo Audio track has been Digital remastered on this blu-ray
and a brand new 5.1 surround sound Audio track has been added to this blu-ray aswell
the new 5.1 Audio mix does sounds pretty Good but not amazing
actually the new HD picture quality looks amazing, better than the Audio mix

There is also all new special features for this blu-ray edition
an all new making of featurette with new interviews with Charles Band, Tim Thomerson
and Writers Danny Bilson and Paul De meo
this featurette only Goes for 15mins but very interesting interviews about the Making of Trancers
it's stated as a Documentary on the Menu, but it's actually just a featurette that goes for 15mins
there's rare interviews with Tom Thomerson, Helen hunt, Megan ward
which is actually just a 4-5mins Promo for the film Trancers 2 that's all it is.
there's also a new Audio commentary by Charles band and Tim thomerson
there just reminicing about the making of Trancers during 1985
during the commentray it seems Charles band has amnesia and can't remember filming most scenes
and can't remember casting Helen Hunt which is Tragic,
Tim thomerson remembers filming the whole film and Helen Hunt so he refreshes Charles band's memory
so the Audio commentray maybe a waste of time, it depends whose listening to the commentary i guess

what is also included in the special features
is the so-called lost Trancers sequel City of lost angels which was filmed 1-2years after TRANCERS 1 was released in Theaters
but for some reason was never released to the Public
i do think one of the reasons why that is, this lost sequel only goes for 25mins max
so it's 25mins of extra footage really which could have been included in the original TRANCERS film i think
the TRANCERS runtime only goes for 77mins so 25mins could easily been added to that
it's an interesting mini sequel, the plot connects between TRANCERS 1 AND 2 which was filmed in 1990
you can make up your own opinion of that
this mini sequel is Included in the special features in widescreen format of course just Digital remastered
there's also a rare still Gallery aswell

so if your a big fan of TRANCERS like myself, Definitely get this blu-ray edition, worth the money for sure
scrap the old dvd release and ignore the other bad reviews about this film
those other reviewers don't know what they're talking about they're obviously not fans of the film
i gave this blu-ray edition 5 stars for sure.",1407369600,38,2790,4.760330578512397
194989,5,1573471917,"I was nine years-old when I saw my first Charles Band feature; I will never forget it because it was also my first 3-D film.  The movie was METALSTORM: THE DESTRUCTION OF JARED-SYN, and it blew my mind.  Without realizing it, I was immediately a fan of Bands work and would go on to watch many of his future titles.  But one movie that continuously eluded me was TRANCERS.  I cant tell you how many times I picked it up at the video store, but then put it right back down.  I wanted to watch itbut usually found other titles to watch instead.  I wish I had watched it, though, because I was missing out on an 80s science-fiction classic.  The fine folks at Full Moon have released it on Blu-ray, and it will be a fine addition to any movie-lovers library.

It still amazes me just how much Band can accomplish with a minuscule budget.  The guy is as masterful with money as Lloyd Kaufman!  This is a huge testament to how far a man can go when he has a vision and direction.

TRANCERS is shot well and looks good onscreen, although it has the typical early 80s feel to it.  This is not a negative by any means, but you cannot expect big-budget style from films like this.

The acting is good, with both Tim Thomerson and Helen Hunt bringing their characters to life with vivid detail.  Both were practically screen vets prior to shooting this film, however their onscreen chemistry makes it feel like we are seeing them for the first time.  And Hunt portraying a punk girlwell, that is definitely a sight to see in its own right!

The special effects in TRANCERS are what you would expect from an early 80s film, however they are quite impressive when you consider the budget.  This was made years before CG was prevalent, so the production team did a good job with what money they had.  I particularly like the car that Deth pulls up in during the opening scenes; it has a very MEGA FORCE type feel to it.

The story itself is very intriguing, and I like how it uses time-travel as a backdrop instead of focusing on it as a primary plot component.  Also, the concept of how they travel back is original and fun; I would very much like to inhabit one of my ancestors bodies for a while, just to see how life differed back then.

TRANCERS is a big win for me, and seeing it on Blu-ray is a real treat; the HD looks and sounds great.  If you're a fan of Full Moon films or 80s features, this is a definite must-see.",1407283200,5,2413,4.292035398230088

194999,2,1573471917,"This would have made an outstanding 1950s Sci-Fi flick, because that was probably the decade when most of these actors were in their prime, and the special effects were 1950s cheesy.  However, it was made in 1985, the same year as Back To The Future and at least one Star Trek movie.  This movie doesn't compare well to either one of those, but a guy who drives a futuristic car that looks a lot like a customized early 'fifties Mercury can't be all bad, and it did feature a young Helen Hunt and a 1957 T-Bird with a very rubbery steering wheel.

The movie starts in the 23rd century, when everything will look exactly the same as it did in 1985 except for the clothes, the obvious result of a steep decline in fashion sense, and all of the cars by then will be designed to look like 1950s hybrids.  The bad guy, called ""Whistler,"" is supposed to be dead, but he turns out to be very much alive, and has gone back in time to 1985 LA to snuff out the ancestors of all the people who have been giving him such a hard time in the 23rd century.  How do the good guys, Jack Deth in particular, find out that the Whistler is alive and what he plans to do to them?  He conveniently tells them all about it at the beginning of the movie in a ghostly video he apparently made with an old Super-8 movie camera.  If he hadn't told them, of course, he could have completed his dastardly deed quickly and quietly and nobody would have been the wiser.  Of course, that would have ended the movie before it ever got started, so we can't allow such nonsense to interfere.  Instead, we'll have to make do with the dumbest Sci-Fi villain ever created.

This is a low-budget movie and it looks it.  To make it worse, the copy I viewed looks as if it's a copy of a copy of a videotape of a TV broadcast, complete with ghosting from bad reception.  But even a clear, widescreen version would have done little for this movie.  It has a few laughs, and a few good moments, but it's definitely a below-average movie for its time.

The quality is very good considering the source.  Full Moon have done a pretty good job restoring it.  It's a filthy, damaged dupe to be sure, but still very watchable.

There are a few el-cheapo choices made though.  An establishing shot of LA, for example, is represented by a slow zoom into a still photo (and features location/date text that is wrong.  McNulty mentions the year 1988 several times, but the caption reads 1986.)  There are also two transitions that look like someone hit the ""make wipe transition here"" button.

195055,2,1573471917,"My review is for the 2010 Echo Bridge release of Trancers. Trancers is a great 80's sci-fi classic about a cop from the future, Jack Deth being transported back to the 1980's to stop Whistler from wipping out the members of the counsel (from Deth & Whistler's own time). Whistler uses the body to one of his ancestors to ""trance"" people to do his bidding. Trancers themselves have a yellowish zombie type look. Trancers is just a fun campy 80's flick. I give the movie itself 5 stars, but the dvd version stinks! The picture itself if blurry, as if it was out of focus, and of the course the famous bar scene where the picture goes black for a few seconds. If you still have a vcr I'd suggest purchasing this on a vhs tape until a decent dvd release appears, that's what I did.",1308182400,4,777,4.328767123287672
195056,4,1573471917,"Charles Band's 1985 TRANCERS - though it has a kind of nifty concept and some fairly strong science fiction ideas to play around with - ultimately doesn't even pretend to be serious, thought-provoking, or about much of anything other than action and thrills, and surprisgly enough it delivers pretty well. I say ""surprisingly"" because most of what I've read about it is pretty bad, and director/producer Band is known mostly for his shlock empire Full Moon Features, which produces stuff to rank alongside Troma or Asylum - junk that knows it's junk and is very much made for the lowest common denominator.  Not that I don't enjoy that kind of stuff sometimes (ok, a lot of times) - but usually it ends up in the so-bad-it's-good territory.

But this early film has a certain amount of grit and devil-may-care attitude, very much buoyed by Tim Thomerson's performance as a world-weary future cop named Jack Deth who specializes in ""burning"" trancers - zombies created artificially through the psychic powers of arch-villain ""The Whistler"" - and who is sent back in time to 1985 to stop the fiend when the whole future L.A. power hierarchy is threatened by the Whistler's trip back to kill the ancestors of the ruling council. To travel into the past Deth uses a drug to enter an ancestor's body - and he ends up in that ancestor after a night of passion with Leena (a very young and very very pretty Helen Hunt), whom he quickly develops feelings for, and who he ends up needing to help him find his way around L.A.

Thomerson basically does a low-rent noir PI impersonation here - think Charles McGraw or possibly Robert Ryan, if you know your classic film noir (and if you don't, and you love this film, you should - leave a comment and I'll recommend you some, ace) - and he's a lot of fun. The futuristic slang he uses sounds just about as out-of-place in 1985 as 1950 slang would, and that's a nice touch. Lots of neon, lots of cheap and grungy sets and locations, and plenty of humor and odd touches of sci-fi here and there which help camouflage the rather poor fight scenes and low budget. If you go in with no expectations as I did, I think you might have a lot of fun with this. I'm sure I'll watch at least the first of the many sequels at some point; now I kind of wish I'd gotten one of the DVD packages with the first three films.

DVD NOTE - as others have pointed out, this is a full-frame transfer of laserdisc-era quality, so it's hardly immaculate.  But somehow with a low-rent cheapie like this, it adds a little charm, and perhaps a hi-def transfer would expose the cheap FX more for what they are.  In any case, recommended for all lovers of 80s sci-fi cheese.",1303776000,2,2682,4.519587628865979
195057,4,1573471917,"Any real fan of low-budget sci-fi and horror has to have a soft spot in his heart for Charles Band, the crown prince of B-movies who is perhaps best known for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puppet-Master-Collection/dp/B003YGC7IA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puppet Master Collection</a>, and 1985's Trancers is one of the films that helped put him on the proverbial map.  This film, packed with quotable cheesy lines, some gloriously bad acting, and oftentimes laughable special effects, went on to inspire multiple sequels - but the biggest thought this movie inspired in my head was ""Man, Helen Hunt was pretty hot back in 1985.""  In fact, Hunt's character's inexplicable attraction to clumsy, middle-aged oafs from the future had me wishing someone could transport me back in time to that year, as well.  What's Trooper Jack Deth got that I don't have?  Oh, yeah - a watch that can stop time for ten incredibly long seconds and a mission to kill Whistler's mother's son.  Whistler, of course, is the evil genius who killed Deth's wife and has now gone back in time three centuries to 1985 to kill the ancestors of the three Council members who run Angel City.  You know the old saying - if you can't beat `em, go back in time and kill their great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfathers (and, of course, be sure to tell them exactly what your plan is in advance, especially if they think you're already dead and no longer a threat to them).

I guess I should explain that ""trancers"" are the murderous, weak-minded slaves (or ""squids,"" in 23rd century parlance) whom Whistler has put in a trance - they do his bidding until they're killed (or ""singed""), at which point they spontaneously combust radioactively for no apparent reason.  I should also point out that there's one big catch to traveling back in time (or ""down the line,"" as Deth would say) - you can only do so by taking over the body of one of your direct ancestors.  This works out great for Deth, as his crusty ancestor had just scored with Leena (a very young Helen Hunt), and Whistler, whose ancestor is a high-ranking detective - but not so much for Deth's blowhard boss who shows up later to yell at him.  Anyway, Leena actually buys Deth's crazy story about being a cop from the future, and the two of them set out to find the two surviving Council member's less than illustrious ancestors before Whistler gets to them.

Of course, the story begs several questions.  For instance, why not go a little bit further back in time to try and save the first Council member's ancestor?  Come to think of it, how do they even know about the first Council member since the death of his direct ancestor means he suddenly never existed?  You just can't let yourself get bogged down with this kind of thinking, though.  Just sit back and enjoy Deth's battle royales against an elderly waitress and a mall Santa, revel in Deth's punk rock -dancing prowess, watch him drive the heck out of a convertible even on perfectly straight roads, and laugh at all of the intentional - and unintentional - comic moments on display over the course of the film's relatively short 76 minutes.  This is Grade A B-movie cheese as only the legendary Charles Band can deliver.",1287532800,,3290,4.943738656987295

195059,1,1573471917,"Let me start by saying I love ""Trancers"".  ""Trancers"" is a great, fun movie.  However, this review is solely based on this DVD release, which is an Asian import edition.

Those of you familiar with the official U.S. DVD of ""Trancers"" probably already know of its problems.  It's nothing more than a direct transfer from the old Vestron LaserDisc.  It's presented in open-matte fullscreen, has a great deal of compression artifacts, and has an obvious transition midway through where the LaserDisc was flipped from side 1 to side 2.  Furthermore, there are some problems with the telecining which are not present on the original LaserDisc.  In other words, it is one of the worst looking DVDs ever released.

Well, unbelievable as it might seen, this import DVD is actually even worse.  My guess is it is based on the U.K. DVD release.  It seems to initially come from the same NTSC LaserDisc source...which was then improperly converted to PAL...and then improperly converted back to NTSC.  Ugghhh, what a mess.

Moral of the story:  If you are looking at this as a possible upgrade to your disappointing U.S. DVD of ""Trancers"", you can forget that idea.  And, if you're looking at this as an alternative to purchasing the official U.S. DVD, I would not recommend it.",1278115200,5,1267,4.832558139534884
195060,3,1573471917,"Representative of a certain segment of science fiction/horror films from the era, Trancers (1985) is campy, heavily atmospheric, fun, B movie.  Featuring looks at the underside of Los Angeles, including the punk scene, Chinatown, and the skid row district, the action is often punctuated by a pulsing, spacey, `Tangerine Dreamish' soundtrack.  The special effects are rather modest, the fights are kind of lame, and the main villain, a pretty boy without much gravitas.  What makes the film work is the hero's deadpan straightforward approach to his mission, and an engaging performance, by the adorable Helen Hunt (Mad About You).

Time travel involves the administering of a drug, which allows the traveler to go back, and occupy the body of a familial ancestor.  Trooper Jack Deth (Tim Thomerson) is a law enforcement officer from the 23rd century, sent back to Los Angeles in the year 1985, to locate a criminal known as Martin Whisper (Michael Stefani), who is occupying the body of an LA police detective named Weisling.  Whisper has strange psychic powers, which enable him to take control of a person's mind.  His victims are known as trancers, and their help, Whistler/Weisling has begun eliminating the ancestors of key government officials from the future.  Part of Deth's mission, is to try and save the lives of two remaining ancestors.

Trancers look like normal people, but Deth has the ability to recognize them.  Before heading into the past, Deth is given doses of antidote, which permit a return to the future, and a special `long second' watch, that elongates time.  Deth assumes the identity of his ancestor Phil Deth, arriving in his LA apartment, where a girl named Leena (Helen Hunt), has just spent the night.  It's the Christmas season, and Leena has a job as a Santa's helper at a mall.  Santa turns out to be a trancer, and tries to strangle Deth, who is forced to kill him.

From here it's the fairly typical, hero on a mission, while girl falls in love with hero, story.  Lenna is young and extremely hot, so what she sees in the scruffy Deth, is kind of a mystery.  Thomerson at 39, easily looks old enough to be Hunt's father.  Parading around in a trench coat, Deth isn't quite up to speed with the LA lifestyle, and he realizes that he needs Leena's guidance.

Deth gets a lead to Hap Ashby (Biff Manard), the last surviving ancestor, and manages to save him from elimination by Weisling, and his cop buddies.  Speeding through the darkness on a moped, down the back alleys of LA, is about as exciting as things get, as the action is not particularly well staged, and Deth isn't much of an action hero type.  The long second bit is used twice to save Leena's life.  The second time, involves Deth going from a rooftop to the street, and is accomplished with great visual economy.  The film's conclusion seems rushed, and is somewhat anticlimactic and weak, like a TV movie.  This sets the stage for the many Trancer sequels, none of which would feature the future academy award winner, Helen Hunt.

While Trancers will never be mistaken for Blade Runner, it has an interesting premise, and is an entertaining time if you don't expect too much.  A limited budget, and lackluster story development, unfortunately prevents Trancers from being a better, and much stronger film.  Tim Thomerson has the Jack Deth character nailed down, and his relationship with Leena, is the highlight of this cult favorite.  Hunt manages to be charming, without being too sappy, and even this early in her career, you can see there is something quite special about her.

This edition has been out for several years, and the image quality is rather disappointing, looking much like 80's era VHS.  The presentation is fullscreen, with no subtitles.",1273795200,,3759,4.847962382445141

195069,4,1573471917,"I remember seeing Trancers on cable back in the mid-eighties. This film, although a very cheap B-movie, has got so much style that you can't help but love it. Obviously, the movie ""borrows"" much of its style and visuals from Blade Runner as well as the characterization of the protagonist, Jack Deth, but even so, Tim Thomerson's performance, a brilliant soundtrack, and a VERY original plot and story line combine to make Trancers a cult classic. The sequels never quite measured up to the original (which is usually the case), so the first film alone is worthy of any DVD collection.

195077,4,1573471917,"""What kind of name is Peter Gunn?"" ""What kind of name is Jack Deth?"" is just one of the memorable lines you will see in this low budget 1985 cult thriller ""Trancers,"" starring the ever reliable Tim Thomerson and a struggling Helen Hunt. ""Trancers"" spawned five sequels, all of which never quite duplicated the fun of the original. I saw somewhere on the Internet that Thomerson is the ""King of the B movies,"" but ""Trancers"" is the one film he made that stands head and shoulders above all others. If you draw a blank with the name ""Tim Thomerson,"" you most likely saw him in a few bigger budget pictures, such as ""Air America, ""Uncommon Valor,"" and ""Who's Harry Crumb?"" He's done television work as well, appearing on ""Xena"" and ""The Days of Our Lives."" Once you recognize Thomerson, you'll remember his appearance in numerous films. Helen Hunt should need no introduction, but the fact that she appears in this low budget film is oddly jarring. Hunt went on to appear in two ""Trancers"" sequels before moving on to ""Mad About You"" and eventual stardom.
""Trancers"" opens with a futuristic L.A. The majority of Los Angeles sits under water, a victim of a massive earthquake. A council rules the remaining areas of the city, but their reign is under fire by a man named Whistler, an evil psychic with the ability to put certain weak-minded people (called squids) under a ""trance."" Whistler hopes to overthrow the council with his trancer shock troops. Trancers tend to be rather ugly blokes, with crusty looking lips and yellowish skin. The council dealt a series of blows to Whistler and his movement with the help of trancer hunters like Jack Deth. Deth and his fellow officers move around the city, hunting down trancers in order to kill them. Jack refers to this process as ""singeing"" because a trancer shot with a gun burns away, leaving only a black, ashy outline on the ground.
After Jack quits the force over a dispute with his boss, he's suddenly called back to duty when an emergency arises. It seems Whistler sent himself ""down the line"" (read: time traveled into the past) to Los Angeles in 1985, where he hopes to hatch a plan that will doom the council and allow himself to take over. Jack Deth must now follow Whistler back in time in order to put an end to the nightmare of the trancers. When Jack goes down the line he meets Lena (Helen Hunt), who quickly becomes a part of the mission to track down Whistler. Predictably, a romance springs up between Deth and Lena as the two race around L.A. battling Whistler's new batch of trancers.
It's difficult to tell if ""Trancers"" is a serious science fiction film or a sly spoof. There are a lot of gags and jokes centered on Christmas in 1985 Los Angeles, especially with Lena's job as an elf at a department store. I don't want to spoil this scene for you, but it is one of the funniest things I've seen in awhile. Imagine a battle with foam candy canes, a set of antlers, and a falling Christmas prop and you'll get the idea. This battle in the mall also leads to one of the funniest lines in the film when a lady calls security on a walkie-talkie and squawks, ""Security, we've got trouble at the North Pole."" If the idea of a singed Santa named Murray appeals to you, buy ""Trancers"" right away.
There are other elements in this film that might appeal to the dedicated cheese lover. Watch how Thomerson drives the car; his hands twist and turn the wheel but the car continues moving in a straight line. Then there is the deadly effect of a tanning booth, which apparently can radiate enough heat to singe a raincoat or burn hands. Jack's special watch, which can freeze time for ten seconds, seems to stop time for minutes. These are small problems that instead of detracting from the film actually serve to add a chuckle or two. Arguably, the biggest joke in the film is the trancers themselves. They aren't that hard to kill, don't look particularly scary or dangerous, and have absolutely no powers whatsoever. You'd figure that at the very least the trancers would possess some sort of psychic power with which to threaten our heroes. You'd be wrong. These guys are so weak you could kill them by hitting them over the head with a rolled up newspaper. Be sure and watch for Deth's first encounter with a trancer in the diner of the future L.A.; I laughed for a long time over the uppercut he delivers to an old waitress when she turns out to be a trancer.
""Trancers"" is actually entertaining overall, with an occasionally cool soundtrack, funny dialogue, and better acting than one usually finds in a movie of this caliber. I really enjoyed Thomerson as Jack Deth; he's fun to watch and actually makes you root for his character. It's too bad the people who made the DVD didn't take the film seriously, as the transfer is fuzzy, there's a dead spot in the middle of the movie, and no commentary. What the DVD does have, amazingly enough, is a whopping FORTY-FIVE trailers on the reverse side of the disc. Sure, the trailers are for low budget clunkers like ""Puppet Master"" and ""Robot Wars,"" but it's still great to watch them. For the price, ""Trancers"" is well worth the time. Hopefully, the rest of the series will come out on DVD soon.",1059004800,49,5202,4.576634512325831
195078,4,1573471917,"And he's never even been here before!  Classic quotable ad line for the cult hit Trancers back when it played in theaters in 1985.  Yeah, Trancers really played the big screen venues back before video ate up the grindhouse theater chains that booked these exploitive little trash movie gems.  Charles Band (of Full Moon fame) created his own little movie studio, the now defunct Empire Pictures, which scored a megahit with Stuart Gordon's Re-Animator and, from 1983 until 1988 (or 89), released many a great piece of low rent cinema, Trancers being one the tiny studio's bigger non-Stuart Gordon hits (Ghoulies was the other one).
Jack Deth is an Angel City cop tracking down the last few Trancers, people who have become mental zombies enslaved to their psychic leader Whistler, who Deth singed (slang for dispatch revolver style) on one of the 'Rim Worlds'.  But it turns out that Whistler is not dead, he has gone 'down the line' to wipe out the current Angel City Council members family lines.  Deth has to go back in time, to 1985 Los Angeles, and snag Whistler before he rewrites the future to his power mad liking.
Although Trancers has plot holes and paradoxes you can drive several highways through, the script manages some real wit and fun with its premise and character actor Tim Thomerson is obviously having a blast playing Deth.  The Full Moon (now Koch Distributing) DVD is just a copy of the Vestron Video laserdisc release, presenting the movie in full frame and offering up some bios and filmographies of the various actors.  40 trailers for most of Band's Full Moon output is offered on the b-side and that makes this disc all the more worth having.

195079,2,1573471917,"This film is often compared with other films, especially Ridley Scott's `Blade Runner', but I'd rather pit it against that movie's source, Philip K. Dick's novel `Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' In `Trancers', Tim Thomerson plays Jack Deth, a future cop not unlike that book's Rick Deckard in that he hunts down people who are thought to be human but aren't, Deth being (in theory) more able than others to make a distinction between a human and a Trancer. Unlike Dick's Replicants, Trancers are `tranced' humans, but by virtue of this, they are not really human anymore. The man responsible for these manipulations is a power-hungry figure named Whistler, a Trancer himself; the Trancers feel the need to protect their boss, unlike the Nexus-6 Replicants, who rebelled against their `maker' for the limits he had imposed on them. The biggest mistake of `Trancers' is to devote only scant attention to the title-creatures and most of it on Deth, a one-note character with almost none of Deckard's self-interrogations about identity and reality. The time-travel element is marginally interesting, but it's usually played for laughs; meanwhile, the best scenes are those that at least try to tackle the most interesting implications of the material, but there aren't too many of them. My advice to those who considered seeing or buying `Trancers' while wanting more than just easy thrills would be to read Dick's aforementioned novel, which turns some of the ideas on which `Trancers' rests into perceptive philosophical reflections instead of mostly mindless entertainement.",1040774400,,1579,5.24505928853755

195081,5,1573471917,"A science-fiction fantasy adventure set in Angel City (Los Angeles) in the year 2257. Jack Deth (Tim Thomerson) is a Trancer-hunter. Deth's mission in life is to hunt down members of a phsyic cult of zombie-like creatures called Trancers, under the control of a man named Martin Whistler. However, Whistler has escaped back in time to become one of his ancestors, in 1985 Los Angeles.
I like to say this is the Evil Dead (or Army of Darkness) of the Sci-Fi genre. Evil Dead is acclaimed as being one of the best horror movies for what it could do with its low-budget, Trancers does this in the same fashion. Tim Thomerson plays Jack Deth, who could go one-on-one with any hero in any movie. Deth has some great lines in the movie which are often quite funny, if your name was Jack Deth, you know you would talk in the 3rd person don't you!?
The special effects, although not great by todays standards, do get the job done. The soundtrack to this movie is also pretty good. The movie itself gets a full 5 out of 5 stars, although the DVD could have been much better. This is a must for any action or sci-fi fan to put into their collection.
Overall : 5/5",1023408000,4,1153,4.392523364485982
195082,4,1573471917,"I came across this movie years ago when I was into a ""B"" movie rental frenzy.  This is a really fun movie as long as you go into it expecting a ""B"" movie.  Just don't take everything so seriously and enjoy the cool characters.  Jack Deth (Tim Thomerson) is a trooper/cop in the future, after the big earth quake that distroyed Los Angeles.  His task is to eliminate the trancers, mindless zombies controlled by an evil character.  Jack Deth dispatches the trancers with Dirty Harry like accuracy.  Sent back into the the mid 80's to chase our evil villain, Jack Deth finds himself in a relationship with the very young and beautiful Helen Hunt.
  Their is one spot in the movie that really caught me off gaurd, I wasn't expecting a moment of really fine acting.  There is a scene where Tim Thomerson tells Helen Hunt that he doesn't want her to come with him cause he doesn't want her to get hurt, and she replies ""You love me"" and he say's, ""That's what I just said wasn't it?""  Well, maybe it's just me but, I thought it was a really good scene.
I recommend this film for anyone who enjoys light hearted movies.  Take a leave of your senses, you need a break from reality.  After all, where else can you find such cool lines like, ""Dry hair is for squides"".",1020038400,,1259,4.379310344827586
195083,4,1573471917,"In the mid 80's many low budget companies popped up that were sponcered by major companies.  These were excuses to produce a huge load of garbage to earn some extra revenue.  One of the companies, and at the time one of the best, was Full Moon Entertainment.  They specialized in the Horror and Sci-Fi genere.  One of their all time greats was Trancers, which has since become a worthy cult classic.
The movie stars Tim Thomerson (WHo was also in Air America, Near Dark, Dollman) as Jack Deth, a Trancer hunter in the year 2285.  Trancers are basically these Zombie like beings made by a psychic maniac known as Whistler.  Whistler has gone down back in time to eliminate the Council members ancestors. The council is basically the rulers of the world.
This movie also stars Helen Hunt as Jack Deths love intrest when he goes back to stop whistler, in the year 1985.  THis also stars Art LeFleur and Telma Hopkins.
The plot may sound cheesy but for the msot part it works out just fine.  This even stands against a lot of the stuff produced today.  This is one of the few low budget direct to video films that is truely great.  For the best part on DVD the theme music is played on the menu which is great in itself.
A must own for any one who likes a good sci-fi film.",1015459200,4,1269,4.361702127659575

7798558,5,1573471917,"First off.  Don't look at this as anything other than a cult classic B Sci Fi movie.  No magnificent Shakespearean dialog.  No Oscar winning special effects.  No Inception type plot twists.  It's just a straightforward anti-hero cop, madman trying to take over the world, good guy wins, bad guy loses, movie.  Love the retro noir feel of it.  With the old classic private eye setting (with of course the 80's retro music and style tied in), you really start rooting for Jack Deth.  I will always have a copy of this movie for when I just want to watch something mindless to enjoy.  Jack Deth rocks.  Just wish I could find a digital copy of City of Lost Angels.  Then I would be ecstatic.",1493856000,2,688,4.467741935483871
