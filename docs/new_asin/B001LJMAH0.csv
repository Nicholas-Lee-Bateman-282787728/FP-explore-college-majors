3683830,1,B001LJMAH0,I'm no prude or I wouldn't have ordered this but it is just too obscene to be funny.,1258156800,,84,3.7222222222222223
3683831,5,B001LJMAH0,"I had seen ""Breaking the Rules"" way back when I was in High School.  I thought it was great then.  The other on here, well, when he's out there with a band I was worried, but then the comedy kicked in and all was good.  I've never laughed this hard.  Sam on CD is WAAAAAY different than Sam live.  Sam on CD is good, but this is even better.  With Sam, it's better when you have the visual.  Sit back and laugh.",1246665600,,411,3.9390243902439024
3683832,3,B001LJMAH0,"It arrived fine, but the content is not that good - the Breaking the Rules is the same as that video, but the other is Sam Kinison playing in a rock band - pretty weak.",1241136000,,168,3.8285714285714287
3683833,5,B001LJMAH0,"this is classic sam, some of the material is old, and the quality is not very good,(sound fades slightly) but it is a inside look at the genius of a legend that is still missed today. Sam was a professional at his craft and even when he was a little trashed, he could get his feet under him and end up giving a good performance. the timeline of this material in conjuction with other work he has done helps you figure out this comedic icon. Great DVD for your sam kinison collection.",1235952000,,483,4.260869565217392
3683834,4,B001LJMAH0,"Sam Kinison: Unleashed, features three acts from different parts of Sam's career. ""Breaking the Rules"" was filmed in 1987 and shows Sam on the stage with his beret, microphone and gargantuous scream. He tears through classic bits such as being married twice and the life of Jesus Christ. ""Family Entertainment Hour,"" filmed in 1991, shows a 'clean' Sam (off cocaine, according to him) with a rock band, walking wife Malika and her sister Sabrina around on leashes. Here he tackles subjects such as rap music sucking (right before introducing rapper Ice T in the crowd) and Richard Simmons.

Die hard fans of Sam Kinison will buy this DVD but won't find much new here, but casual fans will enjoy some vintage Sam. Anyone who has heard any of Sam's four cds - Louder Than Hell (1986),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Have-You-Seen-Me-Lately/dp/B000002LEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Have You Seen Me Lately?</a>&nbsp;(1988),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leader-of-the-Banned/dp/B000002LJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leader of the Banned</a>&nbsp;(1990) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-from-Hell/dp/B00008NGCB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live from Hell</a>&nbsp;(1993) - will certainly hear some of the same jokes on this DVD.

The bonus material is a poorly filmed set (sometimes with inaudible audio) of Sam lazily doing some of the very same jokes from the two other features.

Overall, though, for a man who has been dead for 17 years, Kinison's voice was loud enough to echo into 2009.",1233100800,,1626,6.553488372093023

8318285,4,B001LJMAH0,Very entertaining although some viewers would be alarmed if they don't have thick skin. Sam was surely the KING of SCREAMERS.,1363996800,,125,5.0

8318287,4,B001LJMAH0,"I picked this up yesterday and took it home putting it into the player as soon as I walked in the door. I ended up watching it 3 times in one day. I laughed so hard. I am 38 and remember his performances from late-night tv and seeing these 2 performances on DVD was so cathartic. I laughed until I cried sometimes. There are outtakes that people have said the sound faded but that's why they were outtakes. If you listen, you will still get the jokes even though they sound fades in and out. Mic's in those days were not as good as today. You can't blame Sam for the equipment.",1278979200,,577,4.160714285714286
