8272380,4,B00197YZA4,"The music and performance are, of course, exquisite. Maya Plisetskaya is superb, and the rest of the production is also most excellent. Unfortunately, on today's high-definition viewing devices, the record appears somewhat limited. It looks like something that was taken in television film format, turned into VHS, and then turned into DVD format. This is not a high-resolution recording by any means.",1482796800,,401,5.483870967741935
8272381,5,B00197YZA4,"I am not a ballet critic but I feel that I had to tell of the joy to watch this dvd. surely it is not of the quality of today's renditions, but I must say, the most wonderful part is to see the audience and to see the joy that they feel to watch this magnificent creature. for what else but to bring pleasure to others, and this she has surely done. I cannot get enough of her! I had  the pleasure to meet maya plisetskaya on several occasion and my heart hurts to know that she has passed from our lives. she will live on and no one can replace her. yes, there are many other dvds of this ballet. among them .fonteyn, makarova, ulanova, zakarova, but if you love ballet this will surely tear at your heart. I will cherish it for many years to come I will add this today. I watch this dvd over and over and I will never have enough of this beautiful creature who sadly has left our lives. perhaps we are too critical of things and should just be thankful for the gifts that maya and others like her have given to our lives. be grateful for the small things that god gives to us!",1444435200,3,1078,4.061032863849765
8272382,5,B00197YZA4,"It was exactly what I expected: imperfect, aggravating, strangely edited; but withal, totally worth it for the historical record of perhaps the greatest Odette/Odile of her time.",1436486400,,178,5.62962962962963
8272383,5,B00197YZA4,"Was so happy to finally find this old ballet with Russian Company that I saw years ago on PBS. Gift I promised my daughter over 35 years ago, but could never find for a reasonable price. Thank you so much for this treasure. She was both surprised and happy when she received it.",1403654400,,278,4.264150943396227
8272384,1,B00197YZA4,"I'm a big fan of Maya Plisetskaya and was willing to buy anything that might present even portions of her fabulous dancing. I knew this was an incomplete ballet because it was only 88 minutes of a 3 hour ballet, but not only was it cut up, the music was not synchronized with the snippets of dance that were included. Different dances are popped into and out of and intercut with shots of audience members who were clearly pre-selected. There are very few of Maya's dances on screen and not one is shown in its entirety. I have to confess that I didn't watch the whole thing because it was making me tear my hair out after about 40 minutes. What a disappointment! Only buy it if you're interested in seeing Soviet society and not dance.",1302048000,10,736,4.419117647058823
8272385,4,B00197YZA4,"The dancing was incredibly beautiful.  Plisetskaya is one of the greatest ballerinas in ballet history.  However, there was too much unnecessary focus on the audience.  I wanted to see dancing -not the audience.",1297209600,6,211,5.333333333333333
8272386,5,B00197YZA4,"Historic performances must be evaluated utilizing entirely different criteria from those applied to contemporary works. To judge a recorded performance from the past using modern audio-visual standards is to entirely miss the point of historic art preservation. Even precious snippets of performances, however poor the quality, enable us to time travel back to an earlier era in which artistic practices were markedly different from today's. These differences, however, in no way diminish the gifts and genius of earlier talents.

These older and sometimes extremely rare artifacts are a spectacular opportunity for those of us who appreciate having these otherwise lost cultural treasures salvaged and preserved.

In this case, we have the legendary Maya Plisetskaya - youthful, beautiful, and phenomenally flexible, charismatic and dramatic, in the quintessentially Russian Swan Lake.

The sound and picture quality are by no means inadequate. It is a stunning experience just to be able to see Plisetskaya in her milieu at the Bolshoi, creating two completely different characters - one vulnerable, magical, the other seductively evil and predatory. Her gracefulness, her almost supernatural ability to incarnate the soul of a bird, make the cuts and audience shots irrelevent.

In fact, for those who truly appreciate history - cultural and political as well as artistic - this video is priceless. We see the Soviets at their propagandistic best. It's as if we're seeing two videos - one an historic ballet performance starring one of the 20th century's immortal artists, the other an adroitly executed and subtle propaganda film - in which the well-groomed, appreciative audience from all classes in this classless society is as much a part of the performance as the dance.

Besides Plisetskaya, the other stars of this film are the audience and the stage crew: beautiful young intellectuals mingle with sturdy loyal Party members. The less elegant but apparently no less artistically informed workers, both in the audience and behind the curtain, seem to appreciate ballet as much as the intelligentsia in the boxes. We even see Maya, behind the scenes, relieved and gratified to receive the loving approval of the woman who helps her change her costume. After all, in this vast social experiment, all comrades are equal....

The conducting of the Bolshoi orchestra is excellent. The conducting often makes a huge difference in ballet, although it's not often commented on.  Historic ballet performances can have faster, more propulsive, rhythmic conducting, while contemporary ballet orchestras can be so slow and agonizingly boring.

The dancing is in this Swan Lake is consistently superb. The jester has the outstanding athleticism and power we associate with the Russian school. The Rothbart plays out his death scene with such dramatic potency that the audience explodes with spontaneous applause.

Yes, there are cuts; yes the film quality is not Hollywood. But to have the opportunity to view Plisetskaya at the Bolshoi, in her radiant youth, and in the stellar role of her career is priceless. I highly recommend her autobiography ""I, Maya Plisetskaya"" which, with candor and passion tells the story of the grinding struggles that even artists at the highest levels were forced to survive in the Soviet Union.",1226448000,49,3324,5.352490421455939
