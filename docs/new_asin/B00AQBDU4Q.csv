5469846,4,B00AQBDU4Q,"'A Late Quartet' is a film about professional musicians in their 25th year of making music together. It is a masterful film that displays the humanness of the four participants in the quartet.

 Philip Seymour Hoffman, plays Robert Gelbart, the second violinist. Christopher Walken, plays the oldest member of the quartet. He plays Peter Mitchell, the cellist. Catherine Keener, plays Juliette Gelbart, and plays the viola. Mark Ivanir, plays Daniel Lerner, who is the first violinist.  They are all members of the Fugue String Quartet, a world-famous ensemble based in Manhattan.  Peter, noticing some weakness in his fingers is diagnosed with Parkinson's, and the world as these renowned musicians know it, falls apart. He suggests they employ another cellist to take his place. This opens up the floodgates of missed opportunities, jealousies and family dynamics. This vibrant group of professionals slowly falls apart.

What is most extraordinary, beside the marvelous actors playing these parts, is the extraordinary music they play. Close-ups provide a look at the handwork and the intricate musicianship. What we have here is a family of 25 years who are going through cataclysmic changes in their relationships. Robert and Juliette find their marriage is in trouble, their daughter is in an affair with Daniel, and their life's work is in question. Christopher Walken plays his character, Peter, with exquisite perfection. Calm, collected, the adult in the group, makes the decisions that steers the quartet in the right direction.

The Fugue Quartet is shown in rehearsal and performance, as they prepare to present Beethoven's String Quartet No. 14, Op. 131. this is a work with a funereal ear. Peter wants this work to be his final performance , and thus gives Walken the time to show dignity of his character.

This film shows remarkable performances by these marvelous actors. It is a film to be revered.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-11-13",1360540800,3,1955,5.243589743589744
5469847,5,B00AQBDU4Q,"This movie was easily my favorite of 2012. The script is very good, and presents believable characters and evolves the story in an interesting an meaningful way. Christopher Walken is especially good here -- I loved the way he portrayed his character so realistically. The movie has some very memorable moments, but the ending is especially effective in the way it combines the music and the story's finale. If you like intelligent, and well acted movies, you don't want to miss this.",1360454400,,484,4.914634146341464
5469848,4,B00AQBDU4Q,"This film deals with a fictional classical string quartet. They are trying to work their way through Beethoven's astonishing Op 131 string quartet. Those not familiar with classical music can still enjoy this movie because its not just about the music they are playing. Its about the player's realtionships and what it takes for four people to come together and have their performances express the intentions of the composer. This not just deals with playing the notes but the player's ability to express the meaning, emotion and nuances that the composer intended. It will never be possible to get in to Beethoven's head, so to speak, but great players can come close. The problem that is happening in this movie is that the behavior of the players threatens to dismantel the quartet. One who is married has a one night stand. Another takes up a doomed relationship with the daugther of two that are in the ensemble. The key player, played by Christopher Walken (a great performance) is dealing with the onset of Parkinsons and has to deal with his situation and what the group needs to do to stay together. The whole thing becomes a real mess but, as viewers will see, the players figure out how to get it together (we think) and go on. At the end I wondered if they could really stay together. But, during a performance when Waklen has to call it quits they all touch the score of Op 131 meaning that great music will sound great only if the players are unified and can work togther. Also, as Walken says in the movie, the players have to respect the music. This is a good movie and classical buffs will get special pleaasure out of it. I gave it four stars out of five as I thought the story is a little soap-opera-ish but that's OK. Its still a good movie. After I saw this movie I grabbed my copy of the op 131 and played it. The movie helped me understand it better. It should be noted that ths film also has special insight into great paintings. There is a scene is a museum that I loved. Also, its worth mentioning that the great classical mezzo-soprano, Anne Sophie Von Otter, has a very short cameo. Too bad she did not have more screen time. She is the best. BTW, another reviewer said that Melissa Leo is in this movie. She is not. What movie was he watching?",1360281600,4,2272,4.47710843373494
5469849,5,B00AQBDU4Q,"I have to admit that I do not have an extensive knowledge of classical music nor the commitment, involvement, and dedication it takes to be a part of a musical ensemble, but after watching this film, I have a very strong sense.

5469850,2,B00AQBDU4Q,"I had to comment on this film because everyone else is praising it. The only reason to see it is to watch Melissa Leo. Otherwise, an unfocused, predictable script has everybody solving their problems with just a little sex--except Melissa Leo. Walken is the only grown-up guy in the movie. It's not about classical music either, as the title would suggest. The film is well-scored, but it's basically melodramatic claptrap.",1360281600,5,423,5.057142857142857
5469851,5,B00AQBDU4Q,"While I never saw this movie in the theater, I heard that it was a very well produced and directed film. in watching the film itself I have to say that it was very well done. You have to know that the movie itself is a bit deeper than I would have first anticipated, but this deeper nature within the film is offset by the amazing acting of both Christopher Walken and Philip Seymour Hoffman. You're drawn into the cell and into the life of Christopher Walken's character and the medical issues that he is dealing with that is leading to his retirement. Yet, the movie so much more than just the drama of the health issues surrounding Walken's character. The movie itself explores so much about human relationships and group dynamics and a it is through these relationships that you truly get to understand the importance of the Quartet itself within the film. overall this is a movie that I would encourage all to watch as it is full of amazing acting performances as well as a plot and underlying message that should be shared with all.

*I received a copy of this Blu-Ray in return for an honest review, but this did not impact the words that I shared with all of you above*",1360195200,10,1177,4.449074074074074
5469852,5,B00AQBDU4Q,"A surprisingly simple yet ""complicated"" movie that IMHO was one of 2012's best. The aging leader and cellist (played by Christopher Walken) of a classical ""String Quartet"" finds that he must retire due to the onset of Parkinson's Disease. What now? Well, the ""second violinist"" (for 25 years ...) played by Philip Seymour Hoffman takes the opportunity to suggest to the first violinist that he'd ""kinda like to play first violin on occasion."" The first violinist (played by Mark Ivanhir) a true virtuoso and perfectionist is aghast. The second violinist's wife (and viola player rounding out the Quartet) who's spent her entire adult life playing in this Quartet and, in fact, only met her husband through their playing in the Quartet together kinda agrees with the first violinist :-) ... What now? ;-) What a GREAT story about human / Community dynamics and Life ;-) ;-)",1359936000,29,872,4.97945205479452
5469853,4,B00AQBDU4Q,"""A Late Quartet"" (2012 release, 105 min.) brings the story of the (fictional) ""Fugue String Quartet"", portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman as Robert, Christopher Walken as Peter, Catherine Keener as Juliette (wife of Robert) and Marc Ivanir as Daniel. As the movie begins, we learn that Peter has the beginnings of Parkinson's disease and possibly the end of his musical career. Peter contemplates a replacement so as to assure the contunity of the quartet. Robert at that point voices his long-held frustration of ""just"" being second violinist and would like to share first chair with Daniel, much to Daniel's dismay. Robert and Juliette get into a huge argument about it and when he feels like she doesn't ""have his back"", Robert has a ill-fated affair with a younger woman. Juliette finds out and promply kicks him out of the house. Meanwhile Daniel fall for the charms of Alexandra (daughter of Robert and Juliette). At this point we are about half-way into the movie. Will Peter recover from his illness to bring one last live performance? Will Robert and Juliette reunite? Is Daniel's relationship with Alexandra doomed? Will the Fugue String Quartet survive? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: the acting performances are ACE throughout this movie, none more so than from Philip Seymore Hoffman as the wounded husband and frustrated musician, and in my book better than his much hyped performance in ""The Master"" earlier this year. But check out also Christopher Walken as he stares into his mortality, just superb. If you don't care much for classical music, save yourself the trouble as classical music is front and center throughout this movie (the CD soundtrack of this movie, bringing original music from Angelo Badalamenti, best known for his ""Twin Peaks"" work, and the other assorted classical music is superb too).

Bottom line, I enjoyed this movie both for the music and the acting performances, and hence ""A Late Quartet"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1356480000,87,2057,5.047058823529412

5469863,5,B00AQBDU4Q,"An all star string quartet.
Philip Symour Hoffman now a dead great actor. Cathrine Keener a hidden great actress. A great living figure Christopher Walken and a great figure Mark Ivanir (Schindler's List, The adventrue of Tin tin,  Mr and Mrs Smith). They were once a great string quartet.
Now Christopher Walken just figured out that he is in Parkinson's Disease and has to retire, Cathrine Keener is having problem with marrage with Philip Symour Hoffman(since Philip thinks that his wife is not supportive and he has sex with this arab woman once and  she finds this out)  and Mark Ivanir is as a teacher of a daughter of Philip and Catherine is having sex and deep relationship and knowing this the team is crashing down.

You know if the worker is together 9 to 5 for 4 seasons, it is not easy out there.
Everything should be together share, carefull with everything. Look at each other, share things, no secrets.

More problem is Philip and Catherine has three problems. Chatherine thinks that Philip is not the one who can step up to the leader of this team  from second violin to the first as the leader. 2. Since he finds this out he is having an instant sex with this arab lady and she find this out, She wants to leave him. 3. Another team member is having sex with his pupil their daugher and both Chatherine and Philip are about to kill him about it.

Knowing all this slowly fading figure  Christopher Walken is all so sad. This is suppose to be his last concert.

They cannot even have the proper rehersal.

Now the final concert, he is having his hands numb and couldn't finish his tune so very sad.

It was the late Quartet's final act.

The story is nothing flamboyant or anything but very delicately woven song and you will love it so much if you are a classic music lover or any music lover.

Each charactors are doing their job so well that you will even think that they are shooting a documentary.

5469868,5,B00AQBDU4Q,"Composers of the greatest classical music purportedly felt that chamber music, particularly the string quartet, allowed them the best opportunity to present their most focused and personal expressions of human interactions and emotions, virtually allowing a conversation between disparate voices either in unison or opposition. Among the best and most familiar composers of string quartets were Joseph Haydn (68 string quartets), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (26), Franz Shubert (at least fifteen) and Ludwig Van Beethoven (16).  Beethoven in particular is credited with developing the genre in an experimental and dynamic fashion, especially in his later series of quartets written in the 1820s up until his death. It is Beethovens late quartet, the String Quartet No. 14 in C minor, Op. 131, composed in 1826, the year before his death, that provides both the background and the structure of this 2012 American drama film co-written (with Seth Grossman), produced, and directed by Yaron Zilberman. The film uses chamber music played by the Brentano String Quartet and especially, Beethoven's Op. 131. (The film was released in Australia as Performance.) In the film, the (fictional) Fugue String quartet approaches its 25th anniversary. The onset of a debilitating illness to cellist Peter Mitchell (Christopher Walken) forces its members to reevaluate their relationships. After being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, Peter announces his decision to play one final concert before he retires. Meanwhile the second violinist, Robert (Philip Seymour Hoffman), voices his desire to alternate the first violinist role, long held by Daniel (Mark Ivanir). Robert is married to Juliette (Catherine Keener), the viola player of the group. Upon discovering Juliette does not support him in this matter, Robert has a one-night stand. Further complicating matters, their daughter, Alexandra (Imogen Poots), begins an affair with Daniel, whom her mother once pined for. Yet bound together by their years of collaboration, the quartet will search for a fitting farewell to their shared passion of music and perhaps even a new beginning. Walken, Hoffman and Keener each give career-topping performances here. Walken, in particular, surprises with a subdued sensitive performance as the groups pater familias. Ethan Hawke was original cast as the fourth member of the quartet but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts.  Ukrainian-born Israeli actor Mark Ivanir ably completes the foursome, and young English actress Imogen Poots is a jarring contrast to the group as the daughter of Hoffman and Keener. The film is, as is the quartet itself, filled with turbulence, darkness, anger, romance and, at last, resignation, and is, even for the new-comer, a perceptive look into the inner workings of this musical genre and the musicians who perform it. A Late Quartet received generally positive reviews.",1466035200,4,2890,5.506756756756757

5469877,4,B00AQBDU4Q,"This inter-generational musically themed story doesn't altogether avoid moments that are more soap-operaish than truly dramatic, but that's not the fault of a fine cast.  Catherine Keener, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Christopher Walken are almost iconic figures, to slightly different audiences, I would guess, but they work well here, and Mark Ivanir, an actor hitherto unknown to me, holds his own in this company.  They are the Fugue Quartet, together for 25 years, and they are facing a crisis: their founding spirit and cellist, Peter (Walken), has been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, and it's clear that the quartet, in its original form, is going to have to change (by taking on a new cellist or perhaps disband altogether.  In prospect is a concert featuring the Beethoven Op. 131, one of his late quartets, and Peter would like that concert to be a farewell performance for him.  He's taking drugs for his disease, but these are not going to cure him, and he faces that fact with realism.  Peter is about 30 years older than the other quartet members, maybe in his early 70s.  The other members are Juliette (Keener), the violist, and Robert, the second violinist (Hoffman) who are married to one another and have a daughter, Alexandra, who is a violin student of Daniel (Ivanir), the quartet's first violinist and an old love of Juliette's.  I'll just say here that all of the actors impersonate musicians in performance in a totally convincing way.

Quartet playing might be thought of as the epitome of sacrificing ones own individuality for the sake of a larger aim -- the creation, as a group, of something beautiful, and something beautiful that has lasted, that has an almost transcendent aura about it.  Great art, they say, doesn't age -- but people do, and they change, and sometimes, as with Parkinson's, the change is beyond a person's control -- and it's change that threatens the quartet.  Peter has already experienced it painfully, in the recent loss of his wife, and he hasn't totally recovered from that when the Parkinson's hits.  The effect of Peter's diagnosis has an effect on the other quartet members that's analogous to the effect on Peter of his wife's death.  They're shaken, and their individual needs, desires, and insecurities make themselves manifest to an extent of even affecting the way they think about music and each other as musicians.  The actors make this effect quite credible psychologically, and the idea that some kinds of art -- a collaborative kind, like music -- are dependent for their continuation on finite human beings is powerfully made.  People are vulnerable, and art can suffer, for other quartets, whatever their virtues, will not be producing exactly what is special about this one.  Peter seems particularly attuned to the pathos of this circumstance -- although, to the credit of the screenwriters, he doesn't articulate his concerns so crudely.  Walken, playing somewhat against type, is still severe, but he's kindly and not arrogant, and he creates a memorable character -- the one who is suffering but who nonetheless has to keep recalling the others to their larger purpose.

Avoiding spoilers, I'll just say that all the others behave very badly -- even cruelly -- and the sense of self-assertion, of their putting their own ostensible needs and desires first, is strongly communicated, although the bad behavior is credibly tied to character and you might, like me, feel that some kinds of behavior are crueler than others.  Personal relations are strained to breaking point, and thus the musical collaboration is threatened too.  It's in some of the scenes of strain that what might be called predictable notes are struck, but the acting carries conviction nonetheless, and the movie makes its effects in a way that doesn't seem merely manipulative.  The music of the Op. 131 is heard throughout (along with some other things) as if reminding us what's at stake and reminding us too, if Peter is to be believed, that it represents a beauty that has been made from pain, strain, and struggle.  It's not a great movie, but it's not bad at all.",1448668800,,4121,4.96943231441048

And it could have been really good. The idea is terrific. I'll bet the studio and producers rushed it into production and onto the screen. (Or maybe they're just not very good)

Philip Seymour Hoffman scores again! Another on screen love scene with a beautiful actress. How does he get these parts? He and Christopher Walken were great even in this near mess. Catherine Keener and Mark Ivanir (unknown to me) were good, but not great.

Imogen Poots is sooo aptly named. Her acting is nothing but poots. It really stinks. As actors, she and the guy she becomes involved with had NO chemistry, and as characters, their becoming involved was totally unconvincing and contrived. Shame on this director.

One pitfall of this kind of movie is having actors who don't play stringed instruments plays SO MUCH on screen.

5469909,5,B00AQBDU4Q,"When I bought the Quartet I saw this one and I read the reviewers I was interest to by this movie.
The story was about a quartet who wants to play in their 25th Anniversary .The cellist Peter played by Christopher Walker is diagnosed with Parkinsons and decided to play for the last time, at that moment the group falls into a crisis for different reasons . Robert (Phillip Symour Hoffman) wants to share firs violin with Daniel (Mark Ivanir) who has an affair with Roberts daughter .Robert himself married with Juliette (Catherine Keener),the viola player has a one night stand with a flamenco dancer, and Piter is fighting with the diseased to be able to play in the quartet.
The movie also reflects the differences between a soloist who plays with different orchestras and quartet musicians who has to perform with the same colleagues and develop complete harmony.
When the moment of the last quartet arrives all members get together to play leaving behind all the misunderstanding and problems. At one point of the performance Peter wasn't able to finish and stops to say good by to the public and another cellist takes over to finish the piece with the rest of the group and with the music they reunite to start a new beginning.
It is a very beautiful movie, where the music is playing an important role in the story",1419120000,,1321,4.67381974248927

5469922,3,B00AQBDU4Q,"Why oh why do movie makers choose to use non-musicians to try and pretend they are real musicians?  This is a fairly interesting, sensitive story, but that really ruined it for me (full disclosure, I'm a professional violinist).  The actors look completely inept in the scenes when they're supposedly playing their instruments.  Then, when Christopher Walken's character, the cellist, cannot complete a concert because of his Parkinson's disease, they bring on a young student who IS a real cellist, and a great one, and it makes the contrast even more silly looking.

My next rant is about music movies showing a teacher and student, the student plays one or two notes, and the teacher starts to go on and on about playing with ""feeling"".  No teacher in my entire experience has ever done this, so I have no idea where they get this idea.

I have the utmost respect for the actors involved, and that part of the movie was convincing.  But (final complaint) Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character, the 2nd violinist in the quartet, decides that he's had it with being ""merely"" the 2nd violin, and wants to advance to 1st violin, another ridiculous idea, in my opinion.  In quartet repertoire, you're a cog in the wheel, and you play your part to fit with the other parts; there is no ""better"" part - they're all equal.  And once you understand your contribution, it would be very difficult to change to a different voice in the whole.  It would be almost like starting over in the learning process.

I love that a movie was made about a string quartet and the challenges it faces, and I love that they based it on one of the master works of the repertoire, a late Beethoven quartet.  But even if the acting hadn't been as strong, I still believe it would have been better served to use real musicians with real career issues, which in themselves are pretty interesting.",1407369600,,1866,4.690184049079755

5469928,5,B00AQBDU4Q,"Impeccably well-made film.  I agree with everything positive written by the five-star reviewers before me.

This film made me realize anew the tragic loss of Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Though all of the actors in this film did a fine job, Hoffman's acting rose to a level beyond the rest.  Omg:  the scene at Sotheby's when he confronts his wife (Catherine Keener's character) as to whether she ever even loved him, or simply married him because he had gotten her pregnant?  You could SEE the raw and naked vulnerability exuding from his face -- SO moving, SO realistic.  RIP, Philip. Your talent will always be missed.

There are so many details in this film which I loved, including when Hoffman's deflated character comments to the man who just outbid him at a Sotheby's auction, ""Congratulations:  you just purchased a magnificent violin for $25,000 AND kept it from being owned by a real musician.""  (Or something like that)  That's exactly the type of politely-delivered cutting remark I myself might have made.

Several reviewers have warned that you should stay away from this movie if you do not like classical music.  I do not agree with that advice:  appreciation for classical music sometimes takes awhile to cultivate but is SO worth the effort.  Not only does listening to the complex musicality of classical music build neural network connections in the brain (a good thing) but enjoyment of the music increases with repeated exposure.  The more you listen, over time, the more you enjoy it, understand it, and are able to be deeply affected by it.  And it has zero calories! (smile)",1402531200,,1596,4.895522388059701

5469930,5,B00AQBDU4Q,"I loved everything about this movie and could tell that the actors had taken time in learning to convincingly 'play' their instruments, though the soundtrack was the Brentano Quartet.

The only thing I didn't like was the buffering every five minutes - it took forever to get through the movie.  I think that this probably has something to do with our modem but it would be nice if Amazon prime would give me a chance to get a new modem and watch this again without having to pay for it twice!",1400889600,,493,4.406593406593407
5469931,5,B00AQBDU4Q,"I raise that question, because when you look at the people who made it, everything else they've done has been B-movie schlock or worse.  Then this revelation comes out with a knowledge and passion for classical music beyond compare.  At the end of it, I turned to my musician wife and asked, ""As a layman, I felt like I was watching a documentary.  How right did they get this?""  She said ""Spot on.""  Every one of the quartet was spectacular as was the daughter.  It was great and sad to see Philip Seymour Hoffman in one more great roll, and Christopher Walken as the cellist?  Are you kidding me?  He was spectacular!  Totally believable and compelling.  And his story of his encounters with Pablo Casals?  That's what story telling in movie making is all about.",1400803200,3,764,4.5851851851851855
5469932,4,B00AQBDU4Q,"""A Late Quartet"" is, on the surface, about a string quartet that has performed together for 25 years, but it's really a drama about the relationships that develop over such a period of time. These are actors who have reached the pinnacle of their careers: Philip Seymour Hoffman as Robert, Christopher Walken as Peter, Catherine Keener as Juliette (wife of Robert) and Marc Ivanir as Daniel; and each of their depictions of the characters are spot-on and completely believable.

As the movie begins, we learn that Peter, the eldest member of the quartet, has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and, when he realizes he will no longer be able to perform, suggests a replacement for his role as the cellist in the quarter. His illness and impending departure from the quartet he formed a quarter of a century ago brings up an emotional outpouring among the other 3 members, who now have to face the uncertainty of change. The back-story of each of the individuals and their evolution together is shown through various dialogues and viewing of tapes from interviews of the quartet.

Although the premise seems like it would result in a boring movie, the relationship drama is riveting and so well-acted that you can't help but feel empathy for each of the characters. The settings in New York City in winter are quite beautiful. The music is, of course, first rate; and the actors really studied their roles in order to act convincingly with their instruments. In the final scene, I could detect that they weren't actually playing the instruments, but it was a minor flaw in a beautifully performed drama.",1400716800,,1607,4.882783882783883

Peter must come to terms with his mortality and his desired legacy. When Peter announces his plans to retire, the quartet either has to find a new cellist - this is what Peter would like - or they must disband.
The second violinist (Robert, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) is married to the the violist (Juliet ).  They have a talented daughter, Alexandra (Imogen Poots), who is a protege of the first violinist, Daniel (Mark Ivanir), which only complicates matters.
Daniel had never married; he has devoted his life to the quartet. Robert and Juliet question the acceptance of the roles they have held for so long, and the crisis in the quartet leads to a crisis in their marriage. Meanwhile, their daughter is coming into her own, and discovering her own abilities and desires.

Long suppressed tensions come to the surface as the quartet's survival is brought into question.  The group dynamic is in emotional crisis mode as it becomes clear that more than the music is at stake and in play.  Even though the music is wonderful and authentic (performed by world class musicians), it does not distract from the melodrama that unfolds before you, during rehearsals, and sometimes with great hurt and anger exposed.  The music is the context in which their lives are being torn apart while each character craves an expectation for change and is often met by someone's need to maintain their group's status quo.

And could have been solved so easily. The mother (Keener) just sees Daniel's car parked outside her daughter's apartment, walks away, and whatever material provided in that scene could be provided later.

Not surprisingly, A Late Quartet has a magnificent soundtrack featuring Beethoven, Bach and Haydn chamber music, performed here by the Brentano String Quartet. The lush, emotional score is composed by the wonderful Angelo Badalamenti (remember, Twin Peaks fans?)  It's also good to see Keener and Hoffman paired again after co-starring in Capote, this time as a husband and wife whose own marriage, much like the professional marriage of the quartet itself, is tested to its limits. And finally, there's New York City itself that infuses the film with a heady charm, from the classrooms of Julliard and the wintry landscape of Central Park to the concert stage at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  All in all, a very satisfying and enveloping experience.

5469966,4,B00AQBDU4Q,"It works beautifully as a story of putting aside one's personal drama for the sake of one's art and the continuity of an artistic tradition, in this case a string quartet. In terms of the personal story, I almost wish the plot had focused on the trio of Robert [Hoffman ] , Jules [ Keener] and Peter [ Walken ]. The dynamic between them was fascinating and the performances beautifully nuanced.  Additionally, it would have made for a tighter plot.

Though young musician Alex and older, perfectionistic first violin Daniel are competently played, their story is cliched - older man becomes liberated by way of relationship with a young free spirit, and the intrusion of their affair has a distracting effect.

 However, watching the interaction between Keener's Jules and Walken's Peter is fascinating. He is the spiritual leader of the group, her surrogate father and  her rock.  He is the one she interacts with physically, feels for, weeps over and is most attached to. In the end her regard is so great, she volunteers to care for him once he becomes immobilized by Parkinson's. While she is invariably kind and polite to the others, he is her greatest love. Strangely her husband, Robert  [ Hoffman ], is more envious of Daniel and hurt by his own position as second violin and the fact that she endorses it than he is of her love for Peter.

5469985,3,B00AQBDU4Q,"""A Late Quartet"" may serve as a showcase for the great talent of the actors involved, especially that of Christopher Walken, who was often typecast as an eccentric or tongue-in-cheek villain, but Yaron Zilberman's feature debut film just needs a story that is richer and more powerful, as well as characters that are more interesting and credible.

""A Late Quartet"" revolves a world-renowned string quartet that has been playing together 25 years - Juliette and Robert Gelbart (Catherine Keener and Philip Seymour Hoffman), Peter Mitchell (Christopher Walken) and Daniel Lerner (Mark Ivanir). When cellist Peter is diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease, he decides to retire. The shocking news only makes the other members articulate something long pent-up inside their mind. So will they manage to keep the quartet together?

I didn't find the film particularly dismal. Viewers would find it fascinating - or painful - to see the selfish tendencies in the film's characters (except Walken's) that lead to ego clashing. The portrayals of them are fascinating because of the actors' fine performances. They are also painful because, well, these characters are so horrible.

But in what way? Here is where the film disappoints, at least for me. The film relies too much on melodramatic exposition to further the story. One character sleeps with someone. Then another character does the same. I thought there would be something insightful about the life of professional musicians in the film's story. Once again, Christopher Walken provides it, but not enough.

So, this is what I think. If you are an avid Christopher Walken fan like me, don't miss the film. If you are not, well, the acting is fine anyway, if not the drama.",1375660800,4,1725,5.128113879003559

5469987,3,B00AQBDU4Q,"I had such high expectations for this movie. And why shouldn't I? A Late Quartet boasted a great cast and promised a moving story set to great music. Sadly, it did not deliver.

The story of the death of a string quartet as it had existed for 25 years and its rebirth in a new form should have been beautiful, powerful, and emotionally charged. Instead it basically fell flat.

Overall the story dragged and the acting was only adequate. Even the always wonderful Philip Seymour Hoffman delivered a sub-standard and unsatisfying performance. The result was an emotional vacuum which was not made any better by the choice to use very minimal background music until the end of the movie. I know, I know, using music is a cheap way to give emotional punch to a mediocre film. I know this, but I don't care. In this case, it might have helped.

Although I did find the movie sadly lacking, there were a couple of high points. One was a lovely and very moving performance by the young Imogen Poots and the other was a truly surprising performance by Christopher Walken. Now, I do love that man, but I don't generally associate him with great acting (perhaps undeservedly). In this case, the passion he displayed in his performance saved the movie for me and in the end I actually cried. Admittedly the music likely also helped at that point, but I give Walken the majority of the credit.

Sadly, Walken and Poots had only limited screen time and until the last 15 minutes of the film I was mostly looking for something else to occupy my mind while I waited to see what would happen. The upshot is that I cannot recommend this movie.",1375228800,,1627,4.5426621160409555

5469991,5,B00AQBDU4Q,"Peter(Christopher Walken), the cellist for the Fugue String Quartet, has been diagnosed with early stage Parkinson's Disease.  He tells the other members of the group his intentions to retire and he is already grooming a replacement.  This sets up a string of events within the quartet both professional and personal.  There has been a percolating resentment by Robert(Philip Seymour Hoffman), the second violinist, toward Daniel(Mark Ivanir), the first violinist.  Robert feels he and Daniel should alternate chairs as well as take more artistic chances.  Juliette(Catherine Keener), violist and wife of Robert, sits by in angry silence.  Outside the group Robert has a one night stand with a flamenco dancer which Juliette finds out about and throws him out.  Daniel meanwhile is developing a relationship with Alex(Imogen Poots), daughter of Robert and Juliette.  This may all sound a little melodramatic but it's not really.  The inner workings of the quartet mirror those of any group of people who've worked together a long time.  The cast is uniformly excellent but Walken is the glue that holds the film together.  While he's dealing with his illness as the sage elder and de facto leader of the group it is he who has to navigate the quartet through the rough waters.  I won't even pretend that I know much about classical music.  My attraction to the film was the presence of Walken.  I can correlate this film to the dissolution of pop groups like the Beatles who became undone when internal and external distractions caused them to go their separate ways.

The acting was superb and the music was delightful, but for me the most important part of the movie was the message: the sum is greater than the individual parts.

The only way a quartet works is by each person bending and flexing and being willing to compromise and acknowledge and hear the needs of the other people involved. If that doesn't happen, it's an imbalanced seesaw that could crash.

Although the quartet played classical music, this film made me think about bands like the Beatles and the Stones and even some local Canadian ones I've followed over the years where members have started to hate each other. They go solo for a while, but they're never quite as good by themselves as they are when they're playing as part of the whole. But much like marriages, some people - I would venture to say many, if not most - cannot go the distance over the decades.

Rather, this film utilizes the group dynamic of a string quartet to show true human emotions and relationships, making it university relate-able. In all, it is an acting tour de force, with the handful of lead players showing us everything they've got in a film portraying five people struggling to express what they're really feeling.

Mark Ivanir plays an appropriately intense fourth to the string quartet and the young Imogen Poot more than holds her own with this group.  Hoffman is just so good as the somewhat ordinary guy who is also a fine musician; his humanity really grabs you.  Keener is more lovely than ever---she ages like fine wine.

5470014,4,B00AQBDU4Q,"This is one of two 2012 feature films with ""Quartet"" in the title. Last week I watched (and reviewed here on Amazon) the singularly titled ""Quartet"", directed by Dustin Hoffman, about a quartet of retired opera singers who attempt a reunion after many years. This film, ""A Late Quartet"" is about a string quartet that, after 25 years of playing the same music, pretty much the same way that has to deal with change.

I liked this film, but certainly not as much as the aforementioned ""Quartet"" - a film that got a number of Oscar nomination - but I did find it entertaining - in a melodramatic way. I see there are 80 reviews posted as I write this (though many are from the theatrical release) so I won't repeat what others said (or try not to) and concentrate on the home video release - in this case the Bluray version.
I also recommend that, if you like classical music,  you will enjoy this film but try not to read reviews containing plot spoilers. Yes, you now know this is a melodrama but you'll enjoy it more if you don't know the trigger actions before you watch it.

With a superb cast of actors (has Phillip Seymour Hoffman made a bad movie yet?) including Christopher Walken in an out of character role (well, for him) as a low-key cellist, the acting is a step up. The fact that each of the four actors in the quartet, plus British actress Imogen Poots  (who also has to ditch her accent), has to pretend that they can really play during the concert and practice scenes, shows their dedication to a part.

I did notice that image moved from dark to light (and back again) but it could be my TV - though other recent BDs haven't acted that way.

The BD (and maybe the DVD) has one Bonus feature: The seven-minute featurette - ""Discord and Harmony: Creating A Late Quartet"" which includes interviews with all the major cast members and the film's writer/director, along with scenes from the film. It's interesting but not essential  to enjoyment of the film.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Philip Seymour Hoffman is also excellent as the second violinist who desperately wants to be first violinist of the Fugue Quartet.  The side plot with Hoffman's daughter having an affair with the first violinist is formulaic and creaks (judging by Hollywood movies young women always have their eyes out for men in their late fifties,early sixties - a male fantasy indeed), but the rest of the script is intelligent, witty, and obviously a labor of love on everyone's part.

There's also a good bit about art-in-general, the competition, pretensions, power struggles, and most importantly, the basic purposes of music, painting, and writing. Juliette and Peter's visit to the art museum is perhaps the most memorable part of this film.

Plenty of interesting stuff happens here, with several tight interrelated threads. Still, those wanting fast action, wide scope, and/or big, big dramatic conflict may find A LATE QUARTET a trifle dull.

Even though it's a film about a string quartet, the mood would probably be enhanced by more silence in the background. The constant sad classical music--sorry, don't know the correct term for it--during tense moments between the characters just adds to the melodrama. Since the plot and dialogue are melodramatic enough as is, less would be more in these areas.",1369872000,,1061,5.162790697674419
5470021,2,B00AQBDU4Q,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

 Of the 31 reviews of 'A Late Quartet' at Metacritic, Yaron Zilberman's first feature chronicling the trials and tribulations of a string quartet, 11 were mixed. Approximately five reviewers gave the film a 50 out of 100 score. Typical of these lukewarm reviews were opinions like Nick McCarthy's of Slant Magazine who found the film to be a ""muted soap opera"" and the New Yorker's David Denby, who found it ""conventional"".

On the surface, Zilberman attempts to emulate the films of Ingmar Bergman, who often utilized classical music as an integral part of his narrative and focused on characters who were musicians. Indeed, Zilberman's fictional 'Fugue Quartet' dissects Beethoven's Quartet No. 14, Opus 131 throughout the film. Beethoven's unusual instructions to play the piece without pause figures prominently in the plot (indeed, Christopher Walken who plays Peter Mitchell, the founding member of the quartet, intentionally pauses during the performance to announce that he's retiring and handing over the reins to real-life cellist, Nina Lee, whose Brentano Quartet is responsible for the film's soundtrack).

Despite all the attention to Beethoven, there is very little sense in this film that we're truly privy to the behind-the-scenes look at the denizens who inhabit the classical musical world. There is an interesting interlude where we get to observe a Sotheby's auction for a rare violin. But most of the film focuses on the machinations of characters who could be part of any venue. What's more, Zilberman, who sticks to conventional melodrama here, fails to infuse his characters with any true idiosyncrasies. The characters pretty much are defined by the overblown crises that beset them.

The inciting incident of the film of course is Peter Mitchell's diagnosis that he has Parkinson's Disease. Walken as Mitchell has little to do except attend classes for Parkinson's patients as well as ending up in the middle of the various arguments between the other members of the quartet.

Then there is Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Robert Gelbart, who resents playing second fiddle to Mark Ivanir's Daniel Lerner as well as having an ill-advised affair with a fellow Central Park jogger, after wife Juliette (Catherine Keener) refuses to take his side in his conflict with Lerner. Lerner makes his own contribution to le grand soap opera, when he beds Robert's and Juliette's daughter, Alexandra (played by the perky Imogen Poots). There's also a subplot involving Alexandra, who resents her mother's damning advice concerning her affair with Daniel.

After Robert and Daniel engage in the expected fisticuffs, somehow the quartet reconciles and are able to see off their mentor, with aplomb. Don't ask me exactly why the reconciliation takes place as it's clear director Zilberman's big blast of emotions between the principals, is enough (in Zilberman's mind) to cover for the lack of an explanation as to why the quartet decides to ultimately carry on.

Ivanir as Lerner probably has the most interesting role, the taciturn perfectionist who falls for his uninhibited student. What all the characters could have had more of, is of course, a little humor (where was Woody Allen when you needed him?).

Zilberman manages to extract some neat and intense performances from the star-studded cast but without an inspired script, don't expect many fireworks. 'A Late Quartet' is a conventional piece that will keep your interest but veers too often into the arena of standard melodrama, where one is hoping for something a little more creative and iconoclastic.",1369785600,3,3635,5.230240549828179

5470028,4,B00AQBDU4Q,"A New York based classical string quartet faces new challenges as they approach their 25th anniversary together.  Peter, in an amazing performance by Christopher Walken, is the titular leader and cellist.  Still mourning over the loss of his wife, a prominent opera singer, he discovers he has a debilitating illness that will force him to step down from performing.  The group plans a farewell concert timed with their 25th anniversary.

All is not well with the rest of the group and Peter's eventual departure motivates Robert (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the second violinist, to insist that he get opportunities as the first violinist.  Currently that chair is, and always has been, Daniel's (Mark Ivanir).  Rounding out the quartet is Juliette (Catherine Keener) who is also married to Robert and is the group's violist.

Directed by Yaron Zilberman who also co-wrote with Seth Grossman, the movie could have devolved into a real yawner, but the interaction between characters is wonderful to watch.  Walken in particular struck me as authentic in what would seem to be counterintuitive to his persona.  In a scene early in the picture he talks about his new found malady, which is hanky worthy and unusual.  Not only because it's Walken but because we hardly know this character at this point.

The other actors work the script as well.  In a scene with Robert and Juliette, Robert asks Juliette if she ever truly loved him.  The long pause and eventual answer hits Robert in the gut and Hoffman's face signals the pain.  Ivanir, usually a little seen character actor, gets a meaty role as the youngest of the group and the anal perfectionist.  His confrontation with Robert is further complicated by Alexandra (Imogen Poots), the 20-something daughter of Juliette and Robert.  She is smitten with Daniel who is also one of her violin instructors.  This is a wonderfully constructed film, full of great sets and long pieces of Bach.

In a word: yes.

'A Late Quartet' is storytelling at its finest. All the ""drama"" unfolds from our characters. It is them and their actions that propel us forward. It also features Christopher Walken at his best. I don't recall a performance like this from him in years. With Catherine Keener and Philip Seymour Hoffman, you know what you are getting. And Mark Ivanir is not simply the necessary fourth piece. All four are the glue that keeps the film together, and everyone's performance is directly responsible for how well the story comes across to us.

Still, every competent string player I know laughs at the attempts made here. The acting is superb on all fronts except their playing. The story is good in that it gets into the personal group dynamics of a quartet, although it's highly unusual for a married couple to play in one. Nonetheless, this movie is spellbinding in its portrayal of the clashes between the members' personal and professional goals, and those who are not musicians probably won't be bothered at all by the lack of musicianship in this film. After I heard about the movie, I could hardly wait to view it, and I did enjoy it. Another faux pas, though, is the drama around the $20,000 auction price for a violin that would likely go for millions in real life.

5470034,5,B00AQBDU4Q,"I'd never heard of this, and what a shame. It's one of the finest movies about being a musician I've ever seen, and features some absolutely splendid acting. Walken turns in a career highlight, ditto Hoffman, who just seems to get better and better. But the real surprise for me here was Ivanir, who smolders very believably, and in the only extra on the dvd, an 8 minute doc but a good one, he says he got the role three days before shooting as the original actor dropped out. It's a great turn in any case, but with zero prep it's amazing.

Keener and Hoffman are married yet again as in Synecdoche, and they fit so well yet not quite properly that they are all too real. Writer director producer Silberman gives the whole cast some nice chewy lines and scenes, and while it often gets heavily dramatic, it rarely felt melodramatic to me. Anybody who's played music for a living with other musicians knows that it's a marriage in many ways, and rarely have I seen that shown more crisply and honestly on screen than here. The plot does heap on the conflict, but like Beethoven's 131, the chief conceit of the film, the drama is there to make us feel many emotions, and it works.

I winced upon seeing a box office of only 1.6 million, but I'll bet A Late Quartet slowly gains cult status, and will one day be seen as a true miniature masterpiece. It's all about relationships, and the lack of pointless violence and product placement and other Hollywood bs is a real pleasure and relief. This is a movie by and for intelligent music lovers, and there are plenty of those out here in the real world. Silberman clearly put his love into this fine work, and it shows.

It's also a very touching look at Parkinson's disease, and aging, and letting go. Walken is absolutely rock solid in those scenes, and throughout the film, and you know that Hoffman made this to enjoy working with Chris; their scenes together are brilliant. The final concert is a triumph not only because of the acting and gorgeous performance of the 131 by the Brentano SQ, but because you can tell each actor has gained more comfort playing their instrument, which at the start is clearly not the case. It always kind of hurts as a player to watch actors have no real touch or feel for a fretboard or keyboard, but seeing them all feeling it together at the end really closes the loop here. It feels right, and ennobling, which is what music is there for, and art in general.

I had an unexpectedly moving time watching and listening to A Late Quartet, and if you like any of these actors or have ever been moved by pure acoustic music, you might just find this to be a wonderful experience.",1366156800,3,2662,4.459958932238193

5470044,5,B00AQBDU4Q,"This is superb movie.  You'll need some liking or even tolerance for heavy classical music in the form of a string quartet.  Walken's character, the cellist, starts out with a monologue about the quartet op. 131,  one of the last things Beethoven ever wrote.  It is a monster of a piece.  In the world of quartets, all of which have 4 movements, this one has 7.  I leave aside why 7 - some mystical, or ancient number perhaps?  The movements range from delight, youth, rage, pity, extreme tenderness, a dance, to a look at mortality.  One reviewer of quartet op 131 said it is like Dante's Divine Comedy;  it has everything.  A problem is that its markings demand must be played without interruption between movements, like life itself.  Walken's character notes that these markings make it impossible to play.  As time goes on, with strenuous bowing and plucking, the instruments begin to get out of tune each with itself, then with each other.  Life is much like this.  The quartet is a metaphor for life itself,  ""Late Quartet"" mirrors for us, through incredible music the stages of our own lives as they pass one to the other, bow strings fraying, out of tune episodes overlapping.  The director maintains this wonderfully sensitive metaphor throughout the film.

The ensemble of actors is remarkable, as is that of the musicians playing the parts.  I wonder if the ensemble can represent our own internal lives, set musically.  Each of us has a highly fastidious, technically brilliant first violin inside us, as well as a second violin craving more spotlight, a patient, soulful, supportive viola and a visionary cello at the core, who is losing grip on his/her art.  Some will find this suggestion to be too much of a stretch for the film, but I strongly doubt the metaphor is missing from Beethoven's score.  ""Played without break"", what an impossible direction, but life itself goes forward this way, with all our parts, our pasts, our joys, our sorrows, our aging grating at each other.

The performances of the actors are a delight, the music even more so.
If you wish a performance of the quartet, see the Cypress String quartet's 2012 offering.

If, further into the film, a little more sunlight was permitted to fall, I wasn't inclined to wait that long. To be sure, the performances from the principle actors were every bit as fine as I would expect from actors this talented. But everything I watched pointed to a sad outcome. And it's not that life isn't ever sad, even desperately so, but that I prefer movies more cheering than depressing, and that really fine sad or tragic dramatic presentations require something like comic relief to make them endurable.

Because the whole thing seemed to move at a snails pace, it lacked the tension required to engage the viewer. The story dragged as much as the mood dragged.

5470067,5,B00AQBDU4Q,"People who like this movie may want to see the VHS video ""High Fidelity"", which is a documentary about the real Guarneri  quartet, that performed with the same personnel for 40 years and only recently stopped performing .  Or they might want to read the book by that quartet's first violinist Arnold Steinhardt ""Indivisible by Four"", a memoir about the joys and stresses of performing the quartet repertoire and touring all over the world for 40 years.  The fictional Fugue Quartet does an amazing job of faking on their instruments (the real sounds of Beethoven's Op. 131 Quartet are performed by the Brentano Quartet) and Christopher Walken explains how he watched a real cellist during the filming and imitated what that person was doing with his bow and left hand.  The end of the movie features the Fugue Quartet performing the Op. 131 Quartet with excerpts from all seven movements--and the last movement is heard in its entirety during the credits.  Hearing the Op. 131 is eminently satisfying at the end of the movie--in spite of the conflicts and troubles between the 4 members of the group, it's clear that they are compelled to put everything aside to play this great masterpiece, whose episodic movements reflect the life transitions of the four quartet members.  Even Robert (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who wants to start playing first violin, is  willing to resume his subordinate position as second violin in this concert,  which will be Peter's  (Christopher Walken) last.  Robert's desire to play first violin reminds me of a moment in ""High Fidelity"" when violist Michael Tree reveals that he would occasionally like to play violin in the group instead of viola, but he decides not to bring up the subject with the other members to avoid any possible hard feelings.  The actors of ""A Late Quartet"" are excellent and Imogene Poots as the vivacious daughter of the first violinist adds some welcome eye candy.
Those viewers who like the music in the movie (almost entirely parts of the Op. 131) should consider listening to the other late quartets of Beethoven.  They are the Op. 127, Op. 130, Op. 131, Op. 132,  Op. 135, and the  alternative final movement for Op. 130.  These quartets cover a huge range of human experience.  Compositionally, Beethoven boldly goes where no composer had gone before.  For the next hundred years, many composers such as Mendelssohn, Mahler, Wagner, and Bartok drew inspiration and borrowed ideas from them.  The first movement of Bartok's Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta was obviously inspired by the first movement of Op. 131.  The Op. 130 features the famous Cavatina and Grosse Fugue.  My favorite is the Op. 127 in E flat major--a big and optimistic work that begins this new and final chapter in Beethoven's compositions.  It is noteworthy that the Op. 127 doesn't contain any hints of the slow 4-note motif that appears in the other quartets and which Is heard several times in ""A Late Quartet"".  Beethoven is often thought of as the composer who is the main bridge between the classical and romantic periods of music--truly someone who changed the world.  ""A Late Quartet"" is a fine introduction to the great achievement of his final quartets.",1363564800,3,3209,4.934823091247672

We may take for granted that a quartet doesn't have its conflicts and dramas. The sacrifice and dedication of the members of a quartet (or a trio or other ensemble of chamber music) is overwhelming.

Once again we have a movie that works because of the cast. They convinced me that everything was real: their emotions, their playing, their relationships, everything.

5470072,5,B00AQBDU4Q,"The moments when and idea for a story, the intelligence of a script to tell it, the sensitivity of the director to make it work, and the cast of extraordinary actors to make it visual come all too infrequently these days in the films that cross our theater screens. A LATE QUARTET is such a complete success on so many levels that it should be considered a standard for filmmaking excellence. It is cerebral, yes, it is best appreciated by people who are involved in some way with classical music even if that be solely as an audience, but the dynamics of this little `community' of people drawn together by a lasting contract to rehearse and perform for the better part of their time and the effect of physical proximity and the risks of intellectual/artistic distances have rarely been so exquisitely painted.

The honored Fugue Quartet has been living and performing together for 25 years: first violin Daniel Lerner (Ukrainian American actor Mark Ivanir), second violin Robert Gelbart (Philip Seymour Hoffman), cellist Peter Mitchell (Christopher Walken), and violist Juliette Gelbart (Catherine Keener) make such perfect music together that we would never guess their lives are askew. Peter is diagnosed as having Parkinson's Disease and understands that his performing days are now severely limited; the Gelbart's marriage is at risk because of the tatters of time and the dealing with daughter Alexandra (Imogen Poots) who reacts to her history of being an alone child by entering into a physical affair with obsessive Daniel and Robert's ill-advised one night stand with the young beautiful Pilar (Liraz Charhi); Robert's surfacing jealousy of wanting to be first violin: the struggle with whether the quartet should disband due to Peter's illness or continue with a new cellist. All of this complex interplay of human relationships is underlined by the quartet's rehearing of Beethoven's String Quartet No. 14, opus 131 - a long quartet of seven movements played without interval. It is a sensitively drawn allegory that takes us all the way to the end of the film.

In addition to the bravura acting of the four lead actors there are side stories that are enormously touching: the affair between Alexandra and Daniel, the conflict between Alexandra and her absentee mother (a brilliant scene), the schism between Robert and Juliette as the foundation of their marriage begins to crumble, and the extraordinarily sensitive moment when Peter longs for his deceased wife Miriam - first while listening to a recording of Miriam singing Marietta's Lied from Korngold's opera `Die Tote Stadt' and then as the image of Miriam (Anne Sofie von Otter) is seen and heard in is mind.

Each of the actors in this masterfully crafted film is astonishingly fine. If there were an Oscar for Ensemble this would have won hands down, but the performances by Christopher Walken (the finest of his career) and Philip Seymour Hoffman are exemplary and the characters Catherine Keener, Mark Ivanir and Imogen Poots create are utterly unforgettable. The highest recommendation for this work - it is a film every sensitive person should see.

The title of the movie, ""Late Quartet"" word plays on the music, a very late composition, and the characters of the fictional fugue quartet, in the twilight of its career.  Walken's character, the cellist, starts out with a monologue about the quartet op. 131,  one of the last things Beethoven ever wrote.  It is a monster of a piece.  In the world of quartets, all of which have 4 movements, this one has 7.  I leave aside why 7 - some mystical, or ancient number symbolism perhaps?  The movements range from delight, youth, rage, pity, extreme tenderness, a dance, to a chilling look at mortality.  One reviewer of quartet op 131 said it is like Dante's Divine Comedy;  it has everything.  A problem is that its markings demand must be played without interruption between movements, like life itself the quartet must be played without interruption.  Walken's character notes that these markings make it impossible to play.  As time goes on, with all the strenuous bowing and plucking, the instruments begin to get out of tune each with itself, then with each other.  Life is much like this.  The quartet is a metaphor for life itself,  ""Late Quartet"" mirrors for us, through incredible music the stages of our own lives as they pass one to the other, bow strings fraying, out of tune episodes overlapping.  The director maintains this wonderfully sensitive metaphor throughout the film.

The ensemble of actors is remarkable, as is that of the musicians playing the parts.  I wonder if the ensemble can represent our own internal lives, set musically.  Each of us has a highly fastidious, technically brilliant first violin inside us, as well as a second violin craving more spotlight, a patient, soulful supportive viola and a visionary cello at the core, who is losing grip on his/her art.  Some will find this suggestion to be too much of a stretch for the film, but I strongly doubt the metaphor is missing from Beethoven's score.  ""Played without break"", what an impossible direction, but life itself goes forward this way, with all our parts, our pasts, our joys, our sorrows, our aging grating at each other.

The performances of the actors are a delight, the music even more so.
If you wish a performance of the quartet, see the Cypress String quartet's 2012 offering.

5470088,2,B00AQBDU4Q,"Great cast, but the script just seemed so cheesy in a way.  As a cellist I can definitely relate to all the drama and dynamics involved when working with any type of small ensemble, and the movie definitely presented those , but honestly it felt artificial and not genuine, maybe because the actors didn't show the amount of emotion that they were trying to convey through the script.  For instance, when the second violinist is  stating he wants to alternate as first, he doesn't express it that much.  It feels like he is just stating it, and isn't very convincing...if that happened in real life, it would be more dramatic than that... and there is much more energy and emotion behind that type of ""change"" in a string quartet.  The same goes for the other characters.  A film of a wonderful subject, but lack of execution.",1361404800,4,826,4.623287671232877

Hoffman, Ivanir and Poots deliver brilliant performances. Walken is good albeit  a bit wooden, given what has happened to him. Keener seems out of step.

It's a bit more suited to be a play than a movie. But, if you enjoy good acting, you'll like this.",1361318400,,468,4.559523809523809
5470092,4,B00AQBDU4Q,"I had wanted this to be a great flick: I'd honestly give it 3.75 if I could. The ancillary melodrama gets to be a bit much at times as does the wretched visions of the actors fake-playing their respective instruments. In a few cases it is really bad: e.g. Walken's close up ""cello-playing"" is so remarkably off of the mark and awkward, that it is embarrassing. There are a few other detractor-type moments (Walken-character's vision's of his dead-wife etc), but all in all, ""A Late Quartet"" is a nice film. It is also refreshing to have a popular film with such prevalent Beethoven-ian undercurrent and a string quartet as idee fixe. Additionally most of the acting (rather than instrument faking) is actually quite decent and I do recommend it.",1361145600,,745,4.782945736434108

This is one of those and especially for anyone interested in classical music.

8556307,2,B00AQBDU4Q,"I went into this film really wanting to like it, being a lifelong fan of classical music, and a fan of Philip Seymour Hoffmann to boot. But I just could not warm up to what seemed too often to be a tawdry soap opera-esque art house flick that never took off. This movie could have been great, but it fell way too short. But it still has it's moments.
  To start, it's about a famous string quartet, Hoffmann, Mark Ivanir, Catherine Keener and the one and only Christopher Walken. Now Chris may have been an odd choice to play the cellist who suffers from Parkinson's disease, and I never could get out of my head the idea that this could have been an unused SNL skit from years ago. There's even a scene when Walken learns he has the dreaded disease and does his famous ""Wow! Wow!"", from The Continental. Plus a shot of him on a treadmill hooked to some form of apparatus only made me laugh, when I knew laughter was not wanted. Walken is a brilliant actor, but maybe this was a bad bit of miscasting. Perhaps John Lithgow instead?
  Also, the quartet is threatened when PSH and Mark Ivanir refuse to switch first and second violins in an effort to keep the group going on a fresh and new level. It may have worked for R.E.M. way back when but not here. And Catherine Keener finds out that PSH is cheating on her with another woman (gratuitous sex scene included that wouldn't have been out of place on Mozart in the Jungle, which this film often reminded me of). And then Keener's daughter, played by the lovely Imogen Poots, takes up with Ivanir and creates more tension. Next thing you know, it's The Beatles in 1969. Basically the only thing that saves them is their bond for each other as people and the music they play, namely Beethoven's 13th quartet which is featured prominently. But I never ended up caring for these people, and felt a bit akward watching this, which bordered on the tawdry far too often.
  But as I said it still had it's moments. Hoffmann, who was taken from us far too soon, proves that he could shine in a subpar film on almost any day of the week. His scenes with Keener are very good. Chris Walken has one great scene in which he relates an anecdote about Pablo Casals to his students that is very funny and probably the best thing in the movie. And Imogen Poots is lovely and luminous, with beautiful big eyes that remind me of Amanda Seyfried. Plus genuine acting talent to boot, but just not here. If she were to get the right role, don't be suprised to see an Oscar nomination come her way one day. The 4 actors do make the concert scenes seem authentic, you may even be fooled into thinking that they are playing Beethoven themselves. But it's not enough. And I hated the cameo from Anne Sofie von Otter as Walken's late wife in a flashback scene, complete with a Korngold aria. You know this was just a shameless plug for the soundtrack or the latest album from ASvO. I wouldn't be surprised if the cameos from Hillary Hahn, Daniel Barenboim and Lang Lang were left on the cutting room floor in order to make room for more ""who's sleeping with who"" dramarama.
  I really look forward to a nice, intelligent film about classical music (in some form) to be released one day. Right now we only have Mozart in the Jungle stuff, which is nothing more than high-art-concept Empire or Nashville. I guess the idea that classical music people can do the backstabbing, sleeping around, nighttime soap opera stuff as good as the FAR more popular music genres is all that carries weight right now. A Late Quartet is a film that carries little weight, but it could have if it took time to ""explore the space"".------------PEACE",1528243200,,3652,4.464767616191904
