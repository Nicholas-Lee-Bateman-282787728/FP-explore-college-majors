8527330,5,B008FK4OAO,"Dr. Dave here. For years now Adam Rafferty has been one of the very finest arrangers for solo guitar. At his level, excellence is assured so our focus shifts completely to matters of taste in the arrangements and fidelity to the originals. In both aspects I think Adam Rafferty is superb and I am in good company - Stevie Wonder thinks so too!

Arranging for solo guitar can seem like a thankless task at times, so imagine getting feedback from a legend like Stevie Wonder. It happened like this: Shaun Hopper played some of Adam's Stevie Wonder arrangements at the All-Star Guitar Night at NAMM and was floored to learn that Stevie Wonder wanted to meet him and to hear more. Who could say no?! The more he heard, the more Stevie Wonder loved the arrangements. And now you can learn to play these same arrangements.

In case you don't have it already, Volume 1 contains great arrangements of 4 of Stevie Wonder's all-time great hits (Superstition, I Wish, Sir Duke, Overjoyed) and now Volume 2 has 4 more great ones. This set begins with Isn't She Lovely, played in standard tuning and the original key. Adam once again proves to be as innovative a teacher as he is an arranger. He starts with rhythm work without the guitar. This is a great idea to get the feel of the swing / shuffle groove before you begin with the notes. This will give you the great feel that he has in the performance and will benefit all of your other playing as well. Once you have the groove solidly in your hands, Adam transfers the groove idea to thumb-picking on the guitar, and then adds in the melody. From there it's detailed demonstration of each bar with tips and tricks to get the most out of your playing.

For Higher Ground Adam uses a somewhat unusual DGDGBE tuning (Chet Atkins was fond of this one, using it on Vincent for example). Adam notes that you can optionally use a capo on the first fret to play in the original key. He then recaps shuffle groove instruction before in-depth instruction on the song.

My Cherie Amour is an absolutely beautiful arrangement. Adam's use of harmonics give it a wonderful light feeling that really sets off the subtle harmony. He also places a capo on the nut so that he can quickly put it on first fret for ""instant modulation"" up a semi-tone. Again Adam concentrates first on getting a solid background rhythm and then teaches the necessary right hand techniques before getting into the song so that you have the proper feel right from the outset. You Are the Sunshine of My Life is taught just as well, even using the same capo trick to modulate.

These are not simple arrangements but they are well within reach for intermediate guitarists willing to put in some time for an excellent result. These songs are bound to be the highlight of any solo set, and they will amaze your fans and friends as much as they will please you to play them.

The DVD comes with a booklet of notation and tablature that is compact but large enough to read on a music stand. This is important because there is no PDF of the music, which hopefully makes the music more difficult to pirate. Here's something to consider if you are ever tempted by pirated copies of any instructional DVD: How would you feel if Adam Rafferty were to stop doing arrangements because they were no longer financially viable? Compared to the cost of lessons with even a fourth-rate teacher, these DVD's are a steal, so I suggest buying one (or two - give one to a fellow guitarist and make a great friend!) and congratulate yourself on getting more than your money's worth.

In his teaching as well as his playing Adam Rafferty's enthusiasm is infectious. He clearly loves everything about this music, and he seems to enjoy teaching you how to play it as much as playing it himself. Here you have a great arranger doing a great job of teaching some of the greatest songs ever written. Buy it!

Very highly recommended!",1340841600,2,3907,4.555555555555555
