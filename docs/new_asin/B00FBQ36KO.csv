5974146,5,B00FBQ36KO,"Who is this ass clown Chris Hardwicke?  I didn't tune into this to watch some twerp I have never seen before take up more time than the guests did with his chit-chat.  I'm sorry, but this guy is no member of any brain trust anywhere and should go back to parking cars.  Otherwise this is a great look at the actors when they are out of character, which is always a way to demonstrate what good actors that they are.",1395187200,2,415,4.1625
5974147,5,B00FBQ36KO,"PaleyFest is such a unique ""insider's"" experience with this wonderdul cast. Watching this makes me ask ""Now, why wasn't I there?""",1393545600,,129,5.190476190476191
5974148,4,B00FBQ36KO,"On March 1, 2013 - with Season 3 episodes still airing - the cast & producers of The Walking Dead were Paleyfested, resulting in an hour and a half of Q & A bliss for the fans. I've seen a ton of Paleyfest panels and this is one of the best ones, with none of those occasional awkward moments that sometimes plague these shindigs. I think it's always a must that the moderator provides the energy and keeps not only the panel but the audience fully engaged. Colossal props to Chris Hardwick who keeps things moving and is hilarious and exhibits intimate knowledge of The Walking Dead. If you'd seen Talking Dead, the AMC talk show he hosts that comes after each new episode of The Walking Dead and that proceeds to deconstruct that episode, then you know how fantastic and in the loop the guy is.

It helps that the cast and crew are having a blast during the interview. Their responses are thoughtful, insightful, philosophical, and often enough funny. The best line honors easily go to Steven Yuen for his ""food field"" remark and for his succinct response to the all-panel question (paraphrasing): ""Have the actors ever had dreams or nightmares about the walkers?"" Anyway, Hardwick ensures that each panelist gets repeated turns in the spotlight (okay, the exec. producers, maybe not so much). This is a very solid, very fun peek behind the scenes at one of the best dramas currently being broadcast on the small screen.

The panel consists of moderator Chris Hardwick, creator/exec. producer Robert Kirkman, exec. producers Gale Anne Hurd and David Alpert, f/x wizard/exec. producer Greg Nicotero and cast members Andrew Lincoln, Norman Reedus, Danai Gurira, Laurie Holden, Steven Yeun, Scott Wilson, and Emily Kinney.

Here are just some of the questions raised on the panel:

- Andrew Lincoln is asked about Rick's emotional trauma in Season 3 and how it affects his leadership
- Laurie Holden is asked to justify Andrea's abandoning Michonne and sleeping with the Governor
- How does Robert Kirkman reconcile his still writing the comic book while simultaneously being involved with producing a TV show that veers away from the comic book's source material?
- What would have happened to Darryl if he and Merle hadn't run into Rick's group?
- Does anyone in the cast feel like they're the next one to go? Do they ever feel safe?
- Danai is asked to comment on why that one hitchhiker doesn't get picked up by the group (love her response)
- Will characters from the comic book, the televison show, and the video game eventually cross over?",1391990400,9,2545,4.790432801822323

5974251,3,B00FBQ36KO,"I'm a die-hard fan of TWD - can't get enough of the series.  That being said, I couldn't bring myself to give this edition of Paleyfest 5 stars.  Before the show, someone should've taken the moderator, Chris Hardwick, aside and reminded him that it wasn't to be a celebration of himself.  Although it was entertaining to hear the thoughts of the cast and crew, his constant banal and sophomoric prattle throughout the entire event was a distracting nuisance.  More than a few times he was downright distasteful.  Looking forward to more Paleyfests with a moderator who moderates, not one who thinks everyone in the audience came to see him.",1427846400,,640,4.834862385321101

5974253,5,B00FBQ36KO,"I'd never watched The Walking Dead but heard folks talking about it.  A few months ago, I started watching on Netflix and found the series is so much more than blood and guts.  I really enjoy the character development.  And since I don't have cable television and ran out of episodes to watch (free episodes stop at season 4), I turned to these Paley Center shows.  Very well done, and I had no idea that Andrew Lincoln was an English actor...  Yeah, I know.  But all of the actors are new to me and are simply fabulous.  Can't get enough of The Walking Dead!!!",1426636800,2,561,4.336538461538462
5974254,5,B00FBQ36KO,"The Walking Dead, is one of the best written and directed shows that I  have see in almost 35 yrs. It's ashame that it is over. Now here comes the ""WALKING DEAD "" withdrawals.  Excellent show guys gals.",1426636800,,202,4.2894736842105265
5974255,4,B00FBQ36KO,"My favorite TV show.  This is definitely worth watching if you enjoy the actors in the Walking Dead.  But their responses to questions are a bit lame at times and it's clear that they cannot reveal too much.  Still, I would definitely recommend if you are a fan.",1426464000,,262,4.416666666666667

5974263,5,B00FBQ36KO,"It's fun to watch these Paley Events if done right. This one was and as I was watching this 2 years after it was originally aired I realized that 3 of the actors there were killed off! Andrea, Herschel, and the blonde daughter of his on the show. Besides the actors there's the writers, producers, make up artist and sometimes director Greg Nicotero , Robert Kirkman, and Gale Hurd. Interesting stories from the set and all hosted by ""The Talking Dead"" . Another fun Paleyfest to watch is the one for ""Freeks and Geeks/ Undeclared"" which is hosted by Judd Apatow and includes everyone except James Franco. Avoid the Paleyfest of XFiles, no Scully or Mulder, and only a few actors like Mirch Pilleggi and Nicolas Lea.",1419465600,,716,4.645669291338582

5974269,5,B00FBQ36KO,"I love watching Paleyfest, and this is the best I've seen so far. It's better than Inside the Actor's Studio, which I also really enjoy.  But getting to hear the actors be themselves and hear their perspectives on their characters really gives more depth to the show.  I'm just disappointed Melissa McBride and the actress who plays Maggie weren't there. But Chris ""The Nerdist"" Hardwick OMG, such an amazing host.  I just started watching TWD about a month ago, binged on Netflix, now on Amazon, and now I totally get all the Norman Reedus fuss over the years!",1417478400,6,561,4.704081632653061
