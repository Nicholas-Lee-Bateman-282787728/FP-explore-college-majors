8595384,5,B00DOGZ9PI,"The synopsis provided on this listing describes the plot so I won't rehash that. I will say that I've watched a great many KDramas over the past 15 years, and this was one of the most satisfying series I've seen so far. The two lead characters/actors were outstanding, and while the girl was intended to be annoying in her money-grubbing persona, it wasn't long before the viewer finds her unexpectedly endearing. KDrama fans will enjoy this one; for those curious about KDramas, this is a good one to start with. I saw a different edition of this series, so I can't comment on the quality of the subtitles on this particular release; but they've been described elsewhere as good. I hope they're as good as the presentation I saw.",1510272000,,730,4.666666666666667
