8310259,5,B001HZY1ES,As a mindfulness practitioner of several decades and a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who uses mindfulness as a therapy adjunct with my patients I found Dr. Pryatel's the most careful and concise description of mindfulness I have read in many a moon.  I highly recommend it to psychotherapists who use mindfulness in their practice.  I disagree with the fierce critic who dismisses the presentation as worthless.  There are true nuggets of wisdom and clear explanations that would assist any therapist.  A version of those are easily condensed by a therapist for his patients' use.,1331251200,,581,5.21505376344086
8310260,2,B001HZY1ES,"Quite unfortunate there is no return policy.  I have a Master's in Psychology and am a certified addictions therapist.  I have been to many symposiums, lectures and presentations.  Dr. Pryatel might be one of the worst speakers I have ever heard.  Anything of substance is lost in the droning and flat presentation. It's like a comedic satire on awful self-help videos.",1298851200,4,369,5.0
8310261,1,B001HZY1ES,"If it were possible, I would return this DVD.  It was that bad.  The information, the way it was delivered, the production quality were all the worst I have ever seen.  I learned nothing and found the experience of listening to it grating on my nerves. Really wish I had not considered spending the money.  I do know many different perspectives on mindfulness.  This one wasn't worth hearing.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mindfulness-as-Therapy/dp/B001HZY1ES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mindfulness as Therapy</a>",1297814400,5,552,6.506849315068493
8310262,4,B001HZY1ES,"Techniques are good and divided into learnable components....presentation could be better though, like not reading from a text which was a bit distracting.  All in all,  thank you for this product. We are fortunate to learn from his life's experiences and  grateful for his desire to share his knowledge.",1295913600,2,304,5.163265306122449
8310263,4,B001HZY1ES,"I finally understood what mindfulness meditation is and how it can be used for emotional healing. Much superior to any mindfulness healing or emotional alchemy material I purchased in the past. Some people may find it boring because of the one-angle, static camera. In spite of this, watching the DVD gave me a sense of ""Aha! At last I get it!"".",1269734400,3,345,4.672131147540983
