4699927,5,B005HIBWDE,"George William Jorgensen, Jr. had balls. Emphasis on ""had."" He decided to have them lopped off, and have his penis turned into a vagina.
  Instant woman?
  Hardly.
  Long before Chaz Bono began dancing with transgender tenacity, there was Christine Jorgensen. She/he made headlines as the world's first known man to have sexual reassignment surgery.
  In 1950, George secretly traveled to Copenhagen and met with Dr. Christian Hamburger, the first medical professional to diagnose her as a transsexual rather than a homosexual.
  On February 12, 1953, she arrived in New York City from Denmark and was mobbed by hundreds of reporters, autographs hounds and the curious. What they saw was a former ""frail, tow-headed, introverted little boy who ran from fistfights and rough-and-tumble games"" who had become a tall blonde woman with 13 pieces of luggage and wearing 9AA shoes. The New York Daily News' headline blared: EX-GI BECOMES BLONDE BEAUTY.
  Instant celebrity?
  Hardly.
  Some nightclubs banned her, some embraced her. Some reporters made her an oddity and freak, others revered and respected her. (Actually, she was one tough broad with balls: She demanded an apology from Vice President Spiro T. Agnew when he called another politician ""the Christine Jorgensen of the Republican Party."" He refused.)
  Christine wrote a autobiography, had a show biz ""career"" (check eBay for her album Christine Jorgensen Revealed  and, in the '70s, her life story was turned into a film, finally released on DVD by MGM on Demand.
  This is not one of those Bad Films that is Great (think the ultimate: Valley of the Dolls), but it's better (read: not as campy) than Glen or Glenda, crossing-dresser director Ed Wood's saga of his life in angora sweaters.
  John Hansen stars as Christine/George, and after this film escaped, his career was a short as Christine's man-made clitoris. He's a bad actor/actress, the script sucks and the direction is heavy-handed.
  So why recommend it? It's important in the lineage of sexual history, and people who have never heard of the former GI-turned-woman need to know the story. The film had its on-screen limitations when it was made; don't expect graphic footage, instead there are medical charts of male and female anatomy and lots of chatter about ""sex glands.""
  The film also has one of the few (if not the only) dramatic performance by Elaine Joyce, the perky blonde Monroe-wannabe best known from her gigs on '70s and '80s game shows, and as the wife of Bobby Van and now Neil Simon. She plays a ""female scorpion"" who spews anti-gay slurs and venom with the ease and charm of a concrete wall. She's fabulous! And she's much better than she would be a year later in How to Frame a Figg.
  The film ends with Christine falling in love with a reporter, and their first kiss will make you titter. What the film could not tell you: Christine had been working on a sequel to her autobiography and had been trying to find an American distributor for a Dutch-made documentary on transsexuals, lesbians and female impersonators. She was diagnosed with cancer in 1987, and she never got to accomplish one of her dreams: to guest star, opposite her idol Angela Lansbury, on Murder She Wrote.
  Christine died of bladder and lung cancer on May 3, 1989. She was 62. She was cremated and her ashes were scattered off Dana Point, California on June 9, 1989.",1319328000,9,3383,4.91358024691358

8473015,2,B005HIBWDE,This is a very interesting and true life story. Had the cast of actors been better I would have this movie more stars,1463011200,,117,4.130434782608695
8473016,4,B005HIBWDE,I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS DVD FOR YEARS.,1454889600,,43,3.888888888888889
8473017,3,B005HIBWDE,"I have a friend who is transgendered that I have known since the age of ten. I was one of a very few who accepted her as she wanted to be. It was a very difficult time to be TG. Her family did not accept her and would not even talk about how she felt inside. When this film came out we went to gether to see it in the theater (limited release in Washington, DC). Back then it had an something like an R rating of today.

This version has been highly edited from the original release. In the original version, one of the reporters  is very seriously trying to get to know Christine - the person.  He has a much shortened appearance in this version. They eventually start to fall in love with her and that begins to cause problems for him at work and she does not want him to get too involved as she is still adjusting and does not want him hurt by his co-workers or the public.

Some of the acting is a bit awkward but this was a brand new subject for most folks and therefore not too many actors had any experience. .

There is a little factual information but no real in depth details.",1442102400,5,1086,4.07981220657277
8473018,3,B005HIBWDE,"It is what it is.  Not sure how accurate the story is, but does portray a time in history when there were no Kaitlyn Jenners.  Melodramatic acting that even Lana Turner would love.  I saw the movie when it first came out and it was shocking, tame by today's standards.",1433721600,,268,4.32
8473019,3,B005HIBWDE,"Not the best acting and certainly not a thoroughly accurate story of the life of Christine Jorgensen (even she said so), but one of the first films ever produced on this topic and therefore it represents a cinema milestone.  It certainly changed my life when I saw it in 1970.  Definitely a film for the historical archives.  By itself, the movie lays out the young life of girl born in a boy's body and the pioneering steps she takes to live her life authentically.  Like a side, not the best acting to be sure, but the Jorgensen story is a compelling one.",1433721600,,557,4.431372549019608
8473020,3,B005HIBWDE,"An interesting look into the transition of one man to become the person living inside.  The story is very similar to the sensationalism the press/media is heaping upon Caitlyn Jenner.  The press/media is a little better today, but the issues for transgender people are still overwhelming if you are not rich.  The movie is a little ""long in the tooth"", especially the dream sequences and ""special"" effects.  The acting is not superb, but more like a high school play.  Enjoyable, but not of the greatest caliber.  The actor playing Christine does a good job of showing the transition and some of the issues; however, some of the ""over acting"", especially the scene on the bridge is not that well done.  As a historical review of the things that Christine faced the movie is nicely sequenced, providing glimpses of the boy's youth and the issues he faced from bullies as well as the issues facing the man needing to change himself into the person living inside.  Overall, enjoyable and worth seeing.  A wonderful site to visit is this one that provides a wonderful display of the media frenzy that circled Christine - http://www.christinejorgensen.org/MainPages/Home.html",1433289600,2,1170,5.052083333333333
8473021,5,B005HIBWDE,This was a gift for a transsexual woman who loved this. It was her inspiration in the 1970ies,1412121600,,93,4.222222222222222
8473022,4,B005HIBWDE,I remembered seeing this movie a very long time ago. It's interesting to watch a 1970 movie tackle this subject matter. Christine's slightly helium voice makes it rather comical at times. Keep in mind that this movie may only play in certain devices as it is a DVD-R.,1403568000,,267,4.583333333333333
8473023,5,B005HIBWDE,"Being involved greatly with the Transgender community as a Pastor, all the resources possible on more notable people in this area are of great benefit, and I have read much on her life, and my father even knew her in the 1960's as her real estate agent.  I found the film both informative, but also moving in the struggles George endured to achieve peace of mind.  I am glad to have it.",1376524800,,386,4.347222222222222
8473024,2,B005HIBWDE,"The actual story of the first transexual was interesting but the acting in the film left a lot to be desired.
Jon Hansen did his best but did not have the skill needed to display the range of emotions that Christine must have gone through.",1355788800,2,239,4.333333333333333
