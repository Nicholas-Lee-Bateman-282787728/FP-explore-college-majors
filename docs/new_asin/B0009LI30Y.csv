8062867,3,B0009LI30Y,"Film is not exciting as a spy thriller, interesting as a police procedural, nor even involving as a buddy picture.  You don't get a sense of heightened tensions during the cold war Cuban missile crisis.  Even the romantic entanglements bog this down.  Trimming the running time would not help.  I haven't read the novel by Uris, so I cannot compare the two.",1395014400,,357,4.709677419354839
8062868,4,B0009LI30Y,"The red-covered MCA videotape of TOPAZ (1969) pictured here is a good full screen transfer that has HiFi audio.

Hitchcock spotters will have an easy time catching his wheelchair at the airport cameo. Special mention to Roscoe Lee Browne, who's excellent in a small but pivotal role during the NYC segment.

This Cold War drama begins with a defection to the U.S. of high-ranking KGBer Boris Kusenov (Per-Axel Arosenius) and his revelation to debriefers of unnamed French spy 'Topaz' who's been supplying NATO secrets to the Russians. American CIA agent Michael Nordstrom (John Forsythe) asks his French counterpart currently stationed in D.C., Andre Devereaux (Frederick Stafford), for assistance in learning what exactly is contained in a secret Cuba/USSR agreement.

Devereaux, who has strong ties to Fidel Castro's government as well as Resistance connections there, travels first to Harlem and then Cuba, even as Russian nukes are being shipped to that island. These medium range missiles and their Soviet operators quickly bring on the Oct.'62 Cuban Missile Crisis. Everywhere Andre goes during these perilous days, those close to him meet tragic fates. He himself pays a steep price for what's discovered, both personally and professionally.

The only fault (if any) of this interesting adaptation of the Leon Uris espionage thriller is one of rhythm. The film goes on for an inordinately long time and when you expect a finale it takes another turn, a last bit of business that ends as unexpectedly as it begins. This jarring conclusion is followed by a cheesy montage of story highlights that flash over Maurice Jarr's music track. It's doubtful many in theaters stayed to see them.",1281916800,2,1691,5.205882352941177
8062869,5,B0009LI30Y,"1969's TOPAZ was Hitchock's second return in that decade to his earlier spy thriller films. Shot directly after 1966's TORN CURTAIN, Hitchcock's TOPAZ is a more matter-of-fact tale than a genuine thriller where real lives were at stake. Essentially an American intelligence head (John Forsythe) uses his friend in the French Intelligence (Frederick Stafford) to spy for the United States in Cuba and at the same time they try to ferret out a high French official passing on secrets to the Soviets. This all takes place during the height of the Cuban missile crisis. Roscoe Lee Browne as Philippe Dubois has the best scenes in the film as he has to get close to the Cuban United Nations delegation visiting Harlem and staying at the Theresa Hotel to photograph some secret papers from a high official (John Vernon as Rico Parra). These scenes are examples of Hitchcock's pure cinema. TOPAZ contains an interesting score by Parisian Maurice Jarre creating a ducumentary feel to this film. If Bernard Herrmann had been given the option to score this film it may have been received in a much better light with the critics who were looking for a thriller rather than this unique film. I have always enjoyed this film and feel it deserved much better treatment from both critcs and viewers.",1129852800,2,1284,4.867579908675799
