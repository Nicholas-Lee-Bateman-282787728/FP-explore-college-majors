8222661,5,B000WCU826,"Kathi Casey's ""Get Ready for Pilates"" is a perfect 'five star' video for beginners like myself.  She begins with definitions and examples of the correct/incorrect way to approach the postures.  She is calmly encouraging as she describes the exercises clearly and slowly, accenting the beginner model with clallenges possible.  She demonstrates/ directs how to tuck the chin, and/or place the hands/feet etc. to prevent injury.  She allows time to complete the exercises with her and she places emphasis on slow planned movements that are correctly executed with proper breathing.  She has allowed me to ""get started"" with exercises I thought I would never be able to do. I highly recommend this video and this teacher.",1205884800,7,718,5.208695652173913
8222662,5,B000WCU826,"""Get Ready for Pilates"" is a great video for those who have not exercised in a while or just want to learn pilates.
Kathi's instruction has an easy flow to it without feeling rushed. She also includes modifications of the exercises to fit what is ""right for your body"". We recommend it and Kathi for every beginner!",1204934400,4,315,4.543859649122807
