4547288,5,B0053OXZO6,"THIS MOVIE IS SEXY, BOMB and just all around good. One of the twilight Saga is in here. And he is smoking. This movie is Raw so brace yourself.
But it is a good movie, and at the same time you learn lessons. ""an angry mind is a narrow mind."" At first when I bought this movie I thought it wouldn't be good as it was. i thought it would be all about violence and trouble but it wasn't. It was wonderful! It was sweet. It was sexy as hell. I mean the guys in the movies and their bodies will have you drooling and will make you want to see this movie again and again. I'm not one for spoilers. But this movie is awesome. Just keep in mind there are two scene in this movie that are very raw, and unexpected, this movie is definitely not for little kids and lets just leave it at that. I think you should be over 18 if you were to see this movie. Its too bad it didn't get to go in theatres. . The final ending will have you cheering and yelling.",1319760000,2,943,3.9166666666666665
4547289,3,B0053OXZO6,"This was directed by Michael Jai White.  Now I think he's awesome--at action and choreography.  Check him out in Undisputed 2 or Blood and Bone.  These titles may sound suspect, but trust me, the action is box office ""A"" quality.  It's just all of the non-combat that kept them from theatrical release.  But again, keep in mind the director of this one and try to be understanding of the hardly serviceable acting.  You're here for the fights...and you're going to be disappointed.

 So some fresh meat freshman boxer-wrestlers stumble across the same underground tournament as the first installment in this hopefully coming-to-a-close franchise.  The characters are completely uninteresting.  The plot is completely aimless.  Michael Jai White delivers completely painful dialogue.  But I won't lie.  I smiled a couple of times.

 The score and tone are surprisingly upbeat considering this movie is about a brutal elimination competition called ""The Beatdown"".  But the training scenes lack the proper motivating energy, the trainer (Michael Jai White) doesn't rile us or the characters up, and I cannot find an antagonist.  At least, not besides a needlessly racist cop scene.  As the movie progresses, we find no more intriguing conflict than that between the apparent protagonists and the fighting/training scenes remain stagnant.  An attempt is made to turn one protagonist into a villain--it's a very poor attempt.

 The characters don't seem to develop.  They don't seem to have anything to overcome.  There doesn't seem to be any point to this movie.  Not even to watch some cool fights.  There's one.  But is it really worth over an hour of suffering for two minutes of pleasure?  The Beatdown fights at the end are ""okay"" but fall short of the price of admission.

 Instead of suffering through this, try Blood and Bone and Undisputed 2.  These movies have what you came for and deliver it with grade ""A"" Michael Jai White quality.",1318377600,,1942,5.073015873015873
4547290,4,B0053OXZO6,"this movie should go blue, nice movie but as someone stated before, it didn't take off where the first one left, its a different story and the only thigs it shares with the first one is the tournament and max as the only returning character. still, it have cool fight scenes that wouldnt hurt to watch on bluray",1316822400,,311,4.379310344827586
4547291,3,B0053OXZO6,"I should preface the upcoming criticism by mentioning that I am a BIG fan of Michael Jai White and that one's first time tackling a new task often results in a hose with a few kinks.  The recognition of potential is what's important and I hope he continues not only directing films, but films like this!

White makes his directorial debut in the form of a direct-to-video sequel to the 2008 hit.  He also plays Case, a former MMA champ who's on probation and spends his time training young college students for The Beatdown: a 16-man elimination cage-tournament where the winner brings home 10K.  His prospects include Tim (Todd Duffee), a student trying to help his financially-struggling mother; Zack (Alex Meraz, ""The Twilight Saga""), an injured ex-boxer risking blindness; Justin (Scottie Epstein), a bullied comic-book aficionado; and Mike (Dean Guyer), a collegiate wrestler with a short fuse who's trying to come to terms with his estranged father.  Linking it all together is Max (Evan Peters), the sole leftover from the first film, this time funding The Beatdown and holding it in Louisiana.

Unfortunately, the movie is marred by poor pacing and generally unlikable characters, except for Tim (who could be Dolph Lundgren's long-lost son), Case, Justin and Max.  Though not the fault of the capable actors, Mike & Zach kinda come off as one-dimensional tools.  Until the last 15 minutes anyway.  I had no real expectations for this film until I read that White was directing, the fights were being choreographed by Larnell Stovall (who exceeded my high expectations with ""Undisputed 3""), and a couple of reviews that boasted that this film ""... beats the original in every way"".  Eh, not quite EVERY way.  While I was not a fan of the first film, the acting and pacing was better and the antagonist was more interesting.  In fact, a clear antagonist doesn't really emerge here until the last act of the film (where most of the action takes place), which could be an asset, depending on your point of view.  Few people ever encounter larger obstacles than that of the self.

OK then, what was better?  Well, the fights/training scenes are MUCH better!  I said ""Larnell Stovall"", didn't I?  ANY fight in 2 is better than ANY fight in the first film!  It would be very difficult to film better cage-fights than Stovall and White produce here.  Yeah, they're a little more fancy than authentic MMA but this is a movie and a single coat of gloss is not only inevitable but preferred.  And without the shaky, over-edited photography of the first film!  No visible stunt-doubles either and some of the fellas have some good moves, especially Alex Meraz.  The fights don't come off quite as effective as ""Undisputed 3"" but perhaps that's because I wasn't nearly as engaged in the plight of the characters here.  Not every movie can have Uri Boyka!

The Sony/Stage 6/Mandalay DVD has good, widescreen picture quality with a couple of special features: commentary with White, Duffee, and Epstein and two deleted scenes.  Languages available in English, French, Spanish, Portugese, and Thai.  Subtitles in all aforementioned languages plus Korean and Chinese, too!  On a whole, I did enjoy it, and for fans of DTV kick-flicks and MMA, it is recommended.

4547292,2,B0053OXZO6,"Dont bother paying for this as it simply is nothing like the first one. Bad acting, a couple decent fights, bad plot, not even a attractive blond romantic interest or beleiveable villan.",1316390400,,186,4.84375
4547293,4,B0053OXZO6,"Good movie, wanted a little more out of it. I expected to see more ring action an was kinda let down by that. overall was a good movie though",1316304000,2,141,3.896551724137931
4547294,4,B0053OXZO6,"Never Back Down 2 is very ambitious with overall believable characters and beautiful fight scenes. The filmmakers made the best of what they had and really tried to make a good film. They just needed more money. Michael Jai White stars with more Blood and Bone swagger as Case Walker, an ex-MMA star with a shaky past. He ends up training 4 MMA hopefuls for the upcoming Beatdown 2 which this time takes place in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I definitely noticed the difference and missed the Florida/California scenery from the first film. Max (Evan Peters) returns and is the glue that holds the two films together with his wide-eyed enthusiasm as the Dana White/Vince McMahon behind the new Beatdown. The 4 trainees range from decent to pretty good with their acting abilities. Alex Meraz as Zack plays the flashy pretty boy/mack daddy fighter role to the hilt and Scottie Epstein's Justin morphs very well from comic book nerd into MMA psychopath. Todd Duffee's Tim is the gentle giant you don't want to piss off and Dean Geyer's Mike is believable also as the mildly shy pretty boy with anger-management issues. I didn't really care for the Eve (Jillian Murray) character who came off more like a fighter groupie than a true love interest but how well are female characters developed in most of these movies? As I stated earlier, the fight scenes are beautiful and along with Jai White are my main reasons for buying and recommending this film. Also, Bai Ling, Keith Jardine, Heath Herring and Kimbo Slice aren't in it which is a great thing. MJW's direction compliments returning writer Chris Hauty's story. I just wish there was money involved other than the usual direct to dvd loot. I'm sick of seeing strip clubs, warehouses and vacant lots in MMA flicks. A bigger budget with better locations, an at least WWE or TNA worthy soundtrack, a love interest for Jai White and one who seemed to genuinely care for Geyer would have made this the must buy dvd of 2011. A final slick move by Max pitting Case Walker against Djimon Hounsou in a cameo appearance as Jean Roqua would have been phenomenal. Basically, NBD2 is good but it could've been great. Most of Michael Jai White's starring vehicles are in this category. Hopefully, this is all leading up to an action film where he gets to thoroughly shine with the right amount of money behind him. I'm looking forward to that.",1315785600,3,2376,4.741545893719807
4547295,4,B0053OXZO6,"Michael Jai White owns.
This is top notch action porn, meaning that the story/dialogue/acting is whatever but the fight scenes and training scenes are excellent.
Seeing the hot young athletes in the cast for The Beatdown inspires me to hit the gym, spar with someone, and make the most of the prime of my life.",1315440000,3,310,4.654545454545454
4547296,3,B0053OXZO6,"""An angry mind is a narrow mind.""  Four teenagers who need an outlet begin to train with ex-UFC fighter Case (White).  After one of them betrays the group it is up to the other three to get revenge at the ""Beatdown.""  After liking the first one more then I thought I would I was looking forward to this one.  While I did like this movie it was more of a remake then a sequel.  Instead of the main characters dad dying he leaves his mom.  Instead of the trainer getting in a fight with his brother and living alone he has a run in with the law...and lives alone.  The main character liking a fellow fighters girl is in this one, along with a line about Kurt Cobain. There really is not much different in this movie, except the fighting is more prefessional.  Saying all that though, I did like this movie.  Overall, a near replica of the first one.  If you liked that one you will like this one.  I give it a B.

Would I watch again? - I don't know, mabye.

4547619,5,B0053OXZO6,"Like most movies, this film has flaws. The story is mediocre. But the overall product is quality entertainment featuring rising stars, MMA action, ripped-to-perfection fighters, and a great directorial debut from Michael Jai White as well as the writer of Never Back Down.

All of these elements combine to make a memorable film about never giving up.",1329350400,,351,5.157894736842105
4547620,4,B0053OXZO6,"NBD 2 is a good movie, but not really a sequel to the first Never Back Down.  Aside from a couple of scenes referenced from the first movie, the only character that is the same is Max, who plays a small role.  It has a similar feel to the first movie however.  A few troubled kids who find a mentor in a martial arts expert.  I personally thought that this movie was definitely worth watching.  If you really liked the first movie I definitely think you should take the time to watch this one as well.  I personally really enjoyed watching both of them.",1327190400,,553,4.269230769230769
