8027854,5,B0002FR010,"Viewers are treated to rare live footage of John's solo career.  What makes this one distinct is that you get all three volumes in one package.  This is newly released footage and no doubt Beatle fans will love this one.  The scenes of John during his Beatle days as well as his post-Beatle career are brilliantly paired alongside of one another, so that people get a fuller picture of John and his musical development.

This incredible collection captures the REAL John Lennon, warts and all.  John's personality shines through like a beacon.  John once said that he was either a genius or a madman - which was it?  Both, actually.  He was a brilliant, in-your-face, complex and very vulnerable personality, John Lennon is the real deal.  He does not mince words and he does not suffer a toady gladly.  If not for John, the founder of the Beatles, many of the performers we enjoy today would forever remain unknown.  John Lennon was definitely a vanguard of the musico-cultural scene.

John Lennon.  He was one of a kind.  The world will always miss him.",1287100800,,1055,4.693989071038251
