8060613,5,B0009GWDNW,"Probably one of my all time favoritie Serge movies. What a character. Love his scenes, especially him singing with Catherine. Why can't they make these old cheesy movies anymore? Moody, broody, passionate. YES! I rented this movie years ago from a mom and pop video store. I couldn't take my eyes off of Serge when he came onscreen. When I had to return it, I begged the store owner to let me buy it from her. She did and it still is in my collection. Once in a great while I take it out and am wowed all over again. Ah..the good old days!",1482969600,,539,4.1923076923076925
8060614,4,B0009GWDNW,"***1/2 1980. Written and directed by Claude Berri. 2 nominations for the French Csar awards (Best Music and Best Supporting Actor). An all-star cast for this rather bitter comedy of manners. Catherine Deneuve's character is unable to have a stable relationship with her partners. I liked a lot all the scenes implicating the French singer Serge Gainsbourg who sings with Catherine Deneuve the famous duet ""Dieu est un fumeur de Havanes"".",1200614400,,437,5.169014084507042
