8220078,5,B000VUNUTC,"I live in San Rafael and ""hit"" the City all of the time. This is a great DVD for those contemplating San Francisco and places near ""The City"" for a vacation. It doesn't matter where you go, you will have fun but check this DVD out prior to going as it will give you a good idea of some of the places to go. I have a pretty good DVD player and when I watch this it looks 3D. I love it!",1413676800,,384,3.6951219512195124
8220079,4,B000VUNUTC,"I liked this, it doesn't show everything, but it can't show everything, there's so much to see in San Francisco, like the Blue Front on Haight for breakfast on a Saturday morning just before you go to the park....",1381795200,,213,4.487179487179487
8220080,2,B000VUNUTC,"I was hoping to get a complete tour of San Francisco in this DVD. Instead I got a fast paced video of the most beautiful city of the USA. Where is Sausalito, Tiburon, The Cliff House for god's sake...the bay bridge, the Hotel San Francis, among other main things that are complete ignored?",1285459200,3,289,4.471698113207547
8220081,4,B000VUNUTC,"We've been to San Fran a few years ago and are going back again soon. This dvd showed us a few places that we didn't see & will when we return.
It's a nice break and is definately refreshing!",1214092800,2,191,3.923076923076923
8220082,5,B000VUNUTC,"I really enjoyed this look at San Francisco.  I've been there before, but this guide helped me seek out some spots I hadn't seen before. The DVD also has a lot of nice shots of the city (especially the Golden Gate Bridge!) Another thing that I liked about this guide was the nice way the narrator told the story with humor. It made the whole thing seem much less dry than I had been expecting. Good overview of the city. I recommend it.",1198195200,9,436,4.253012048192771
