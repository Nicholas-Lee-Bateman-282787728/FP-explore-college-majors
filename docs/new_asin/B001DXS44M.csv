8295450,5,B001DXS44M,"The epic tale of 'Leif The Lucky', told through his ""Greenlander Saga"" and also kept alive through the storytelling of the Norse before the written word; mouth to mouth was how this information was passed on.  This is the subject of this intriguing documentary.  ""Leif's saga"" follows closely and also contradicts his father's ('Eric The Red') saga called ""Eric's Saga""; thus the two tellings overlap at times, although are basically the same historically.

The two sagas come together interestingly to spin the yarn of who really did legally discover and settle North America first; being Leif Ericson, during the Viking Era.  His father, Eric, exiled from Norway by the Christian converted King Olaf, took Leif along to the country of Iceland.

The Vikings were pagans worshiping their 'gods of war' which were foreign to Christianity, therefore, anyone trading with the Vikings were doing so illegally.  They took to raiding, pillaging and conquering every land for whatever they wanted or needed and were greatly feared.  Eric The Red became the most feared man in Iceland, while Leif's mother was loving and docile. Leif grew up solidly balanced with his father's will for adventure and his mother's will for domesticity.

The converted Christian, Norwegian 'King Olaf', kept close to both religions as to not anger any of the gods and to gain favor, when due, from all of them. This way they could also have pagan trading rights with the old gods and the benefit of the sovereign Christian God.  It was now time for Leif to travel onward; economics behind his deciding, he was in no way foolish or disorganized.  He did reach Greenland although wanderlust got the better of him and he sailed further finding a new and strange land to settle into.  One half of his party staying behind to begin their settlement and the other half traveling on to explore the new territory.

He landed in what he called 'Vinland' (two thoughts on this; 'vin' meaning pasture in the ancient Norse language and also in the present day, 'grapes') causing much speculation to the choice of Leif's oddly placed new land discovery.  Ericson would always refer to the profuse amount of grapes on the vine found throughout this new land while his countrymen had thought he had sailed to Newfoundland [no grapes to be found there in this climate or new wheat either, only along the coastal region of North America] in which caused so much perplexity.

Where had Leif Ericson landed and built the new community, from many homesteads to bustling industry?  Little is known of this fact with the chronological order until noted researchers, the Instads, had a few things to say and do in the 1960's (later finding grapes everywhere after all, which would never have grown in the conditions of Newfoundland). First, the writers of the Sagas may have tried to fit 'vin' to the word 'grapes' because they didn't know the Latin, meaning pasture, and not the former.

Also in 1965 an important archaeologist started carbon dating, finding iron, Norse artifacts, grapes and several different items that only the Norse would have used for a settlement on the coast of North America factually.  Also finding out that after 5-15 years the Native Americans vastly outnumbered the Viking people and drove them from Vinland. 'Leif The Lucky' left the first site in America so many years earlier than is recorded in the historical record.

An extremely interesting documentary chock-full of information for anyone who enjoys a great story, loads of Norwegian history, plus folklore and a tale of one of the most famous Vikings known.  I only wish with all this content that it would have gone on for another half an hour or more.  I have seen this two times and could watch it over again easily.",1345507200,4,3758,4.8974763406940065
8295451,5,B001DXS44M,This DVD is great to have if your doing some research on the Vikings! It may only be 50 minutes long but still worth it! I just wish there are more DVDs on the Vikings!,1324425600,4,168,3.8285714285714287
8295452,4,B001DXS44M,"I am a history enthusiast and was introduced to Leif Ericson through a historical fiction novel. I wanted to learn more about this intriguing character so I set out to find a movie on him. I was a little hesitant to purchase this one because there was no review yet. But, I figured at about the cost of a movie rental, (at the time of purchase; Amazon sometimes changes their prices) there was little risk in buying it. I'm glad I did.

The biography is mostly professors and a narrator talking to still images on the screen and some video scenery(fairly common for biographies covering time periods prior to paintings, photos, video, etc.). Content wise, I thought they gave a great overview of what little is known about Leif which was passed down through Norse storytelling.

What I was most impressed with was a brief interview with the Ingstad's who were credited with making the discovery of Leif's settlement in North America in the 1960's. This portion of the biography had video footage of the reconstructed site of the settlement.

I didn't give it 5 stars because it wasn't the most mind-blowing biography. However, worthy of 4 stars because it was pleasant to watch and satisfied some of my curiosity about this Viking explorer.",1309219200,9,1240,4.785046728971962
