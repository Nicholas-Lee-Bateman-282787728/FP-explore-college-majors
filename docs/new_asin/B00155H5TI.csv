3140392,5,B00155H5TI,"This is an amazing DVD video featuring some of the 1960's decades greatest hitmakers. This was originally televised on PBS as part of fundraising programming and what a show it is!!I was personally bowled over by all of the superb performances,especially Tommy James,Herman's Hermits and Rob Grill & The Grass Roots!!I recommend this collection to all the 1960's music fans out there as well as music lovers alike!!",1289606400,,415,5.117647058823529
3140393,5,B00155H5TI,It was great to see the acts I loved in the 60's  sing thier hits one more time. It reminded me what music meant to me back then. And how music can shape a culture.,1276300800,,164,3.6857142857142855

The concert was a PBS concert and their are no commercials all music.

3140395,5,B00155H5TI,"One word....""Classic""!  Growing up in the 60's and early 70's, these bands were what my brother and our friends listened to....and to be able to experience them once again in the comfort of my family room on my 61"" DLP was awesome. Peter Noone, Paul Lindsey, The Buckinghams, Tommy James and the main reason for my purchasing the DVD...Rob Grille and the Grass Roots!  My brother and I wore out Their 16 Greatest Hits Album and the 1st 45rpm I ever bought was ""Midnight Confessions""!  We saw the Grass Roots several times in concert when they came to our area (Johnstown, PA) and we both said that we would love to have a DVD of them live in concert to preserve the memories.  Although this has only 3 of their hits on it, it's better than not having any at all.  We are still hoping for an entire Grass Roots concert on DVD....but for now, this will definitely tide us over!!!  Thank you.",1269734400,2,889,4.423312883435583

Tommy James, The Buckinghams, Chad and Jeremy, Gary Lewis and the Playboys, The Grass Roots, Mark Lindsay, and Herman's Hermits are all here singing their top hits.  I have purchased over thirty copies as a gift over the past two years to give to kids in my 1960s music class.  This DVD is a steal.

Most of the acts are great, and my only complaint is that they should have made the DVD longer (or a two DVD package).",1248825600,30,330,4.39344262295082

3140406,2,B00155H5TI,"I have purchased many PBS reunion-type concerts, and most that TJ Labinsky put together were A+..  This is the worst of all.  Even though I paid the money to buy this, after one watching it went straight into the trash can.  The artists are very mediocre, and well past their prime, as expected.  But, I did not expect the music to be so terrible.  I suppose it's hard to find decent, still vocally good, individuals, let alone groups, that would do this concert.  I just saw the CSN 2012 tour roll through Dallas, and they are still awesome, which explains why they are not on this DVD.  No performer of stature is on this disc.  Not one performer, not even Tommy James, can carry a tune.  This is bubble gum music at its absolute worst.  I apologize to the landfill for polluting it with this DVD.",1385510400,3,799,4.410958904109589

Performances range from mediocre (Mark Lindsay and Gary Lewis) to fun (Peter Noone) to very entertaining (Grass Roots, Buckinghams, Tommy James) to superb (Chad and Jeremy's rendition of ""A Summer Song.""  ""A Summer Song"" alone is worth the very low price of this dvd.  Buy it.",1355875200,,387,4.647058823529412

It was great to watch the wonderful bands again. This video is professionally done.",1352764800,,248,4.297872340425532
3140418,5,B00155H5TI,"This dvd contains great music from the 60s.  The performances are good quality. The artists perform songs not previously available on dvd. I enjoy live performances and this dvd gives me an opportunity to see artists that no longer perform live or do so in a limited fashion.  If you enjoy Tommy James and the Shondells, the Grass Roots and Herman's Hermits this is a great addition to your collection.",1350000000,,402,4.728571428571429
3140419,5,B00155H5TI,"I loved this music when I was a teenager in the 60's and still love it in 2012.  It's great to see so many of these performers on one DVD, and their songs help bring back happy memories from my youth.  I attended a Happy Together Reunion Tour concert last month and saw some of these same acts, but one group I especially wanted to see was Rob Grill and the Grass Roots.  Sadly, Rob was not there on stage.  I learned after the concert that Rob had passed away last year.  Happily, however, he's on this DVD along with a lot of other favorites.  My advice for those who enjoy 60's Pop Rock is to get this DVD and to also get out to any reunion tours, if you have the chance, before any other of these talented recording artists leave us as Rob Grill has.",1342569600,,754,4.095238095238095

3140421,5,B00155H5TI,"When I saw Herman's Hermitts It's like going back in time, they sounded great, so did the BUCKINGHAM's and TOMMY JAMES. That's primarily why I purchased this dvd, Mark lindsey however was pretty BAD but you get the good with the bad.on this dvd. all in all this is a great dvd,another PBS concert with a live audience, no canned applause.(which I hate)!A great buy and I felt like i was back in the 60's ,which is why you buy these gems to begin with!",1329696000,,451,4.317647058823529
3140422,5,B00155H5TI,"What can I say that others haven't?

No, this isn't video FROM the 60's, but the songs will still bring back many memories.

And there are a lot of songs on this disc.

And, fortunately, they play one song after another with little interruption between songs. Want to see an interview with your favorite artist on this disc? That's there too, but happily it's not in the middle of their ""gig"". There is an entire section of interviews with everyone that appears on this disc.

And don't forget the encore, where Tommy James starts the song ""Mony Mony"", and is joined on stage by all of those that appear on this disc. The stage is full, even though you'd never expect to see the likes of Chad & Jeremy singing a song like this one, they do, and do well, as everyone backs up Tommy James.

Great disc.

Brings back a lot of memories.

Well worth buying if you're a fan of music from this era.",1329004800,,891,4.331325301204819

3140424,5,B00155H5TI,"Hello what a great concert. It really was great to see the artists that I grew up with during the sixties. I really Loved the groups they had back in that era. The Grass Roots, Tommy James and The Shondells, and more great rock groups on this disc. I enjoyed it very much. I am glad I have it in my collection of rock groups. I remember riding in my 1969 G.T.O. and playing this music on my 8 track tape deck in my car. Awesome memories.",1315785600,2,437,4.0344827586206895
3140425,2,B00155H5TI,"I hate writing this because I truly do love the performers and so appreciate their talent and gift. And perhaps it's my fault. I didn't ready the description of the DVD very well. I was thinking of old footage of their performances like the UNBELIEVABLE ones I've found on YouTube (the clips of the original Hollies performances I've recently discovered there are incredible).
It was just kind of sad to watch them now trying to re-create what was. And that stage set didn't help much, my gosh it looked like some weird funeral home stage show production.
You may like this DVD and that's cool but I have a copy now for sale.......cheap.",1312675200,8,637,4.646017699115045
3140426,5,B00155H5TI,Very well done overall concert.  Highlighted by Chad & Jeremy performance.  Gary Lewis voice was the only one that was not easily recognized.,1312243200,,141,5.086956521739131
3140427,5,B00155H5TI,"This is a fantastic DVD. Sound, color, music, interviews are excellent. Very pleased to own this. 60's music is still the best! Would recommend this to any 60's fan.",1298851200,4,165,4.724137931034483
3140428,5,B00155H5TI,"This is an exceptional value for the money (two copies cost me less than [...] with shipping).  This is not the groups singing some of their hits when they were on the charts back in the mid-late 60s. Rather, it's a 2003 recorded reunion with all the lead singers and some of their original band mates - and that's perfectly fine.  The line up has 7 artists, each of which with one or more huge hits and several minor hits.  As a point of reference, I've seen 3 of these artists (Tommy James, Robbie Grill & the Grassroots and the Buckinghams) in concert over the past 10 years.  The DVD sound and video quality is perfect. The voice quaility of most of the singers is excellent as well, notably Tommy James, Robbie Grill and the showman Peter Noone.  It's obvious too, that while Gary Lewis had a number of great songs in the mid 60s, his voice is marginal at best. The DVD presents array of 19 top songs from the artists, one more captivating than the next. I highly recommend it. I will say that given all of the old hits from these artists, this easily could have been 2 or 3 DVDs.",1293753600,13,1085,4.299019607843137

3140430,3,B00155H5TI,"Bought this based on price and reviews I read. After viewing it, I rate it as disappointing at best. Mark Lindsay was pretty bad and the others better. I think part of the problem is I remember them from the old TV shows that they appeared on in the 60's.",1290297600,2,255,4.12

3374918,5,B00155H5TI,"When I saw Herman's Hermitts It's like going back in time, they sounded great, so did the BUCKINGHAM's and TOMMY JAMES. That's primarily why I purchased this dvd, Mark lindsey however was pretty BAD but you get the good with the bad.on this dvd. all in all this is a great dvd,another PBS concert with a live audience, no canned applause.(which I hate)!A great buy and I felt like i was back in the 60's ,which is why you buy these gems to begin with!",1329696000,,451,4.317647058823529
3374919,5,B00155H5TI,"What can I say that others haven't?

No, this isn't video FROM the 60's, but the songs will still bring back many memories.

And there are a lot of songs on this disc.

And, fortunately, they play one song after another with little interruption between songs. Want to see an interview with your favorite artist on this disc? That's there too, but happily it's not in the middle of their ""gig"". There is an entire section of interviews with everyone that appears on this disc.

And don't forget the encore, where Tommy James starts the song ""Mony Mony"", and is joined on stage by all of those that appear on this disc. The stage is full, even though you'd never expect to see the likes of Chad & Jeremy singing a song like this one, they do, and do well, as everyone backs up Tommy James.

Great disc.

Brings back a lot of memories.

Well worth buying if you're a fan of music from this era.",1329004800,,891,4.331325301204819

3374921,5,B00155H5TI,"Hello what a great concert. It really was great to see the artists that I grew up with during the sixties. I really Loved the groups they had back in that era. The Grass Roots, Tommy James and The Shondells, and more great rock groups on this disc. I enjoyed it very much. I am glad I have it in my collection of rock groups. I remember riding in my 1969 G.T.O. and playing this music on my 8 track tape deck in my car. Awesome memories.",1315785600,2,437,4.0344827586206895
3374922,2,B00155H5TI,"I hate writing this because I truly do love the performers and so appreciate their talent and gift. And perhaps it's my fault. I didn't ready the description of the DVD very well. I was thinking of old footage of their performances like the UNBELIEVABLE ones I've found on YouTube (the clips of the original Hollies performances I've recently discovered there are incredible).
It was just kind of sad to watch them now trying to re-create what was. And that stage set didn't help much, my gosh it looked like some weird funeral home stage show production.
You may like this DVD and that's cool but I have a copy now for sale.......cheap.",1312675200,8,637,4.646017699115045

3374925,5,B00155H5TI,"This is an exceptional value for the money (two copies cost me less than [...] with shipping).  This is not the groups singing some of their hits when they were on the charts back in the mid-late 60s. Rather, it's a 2003 recorded reunion with all the lead singers and some of their original band mates - and that's perfectly fine.  The line up has 7 artists, each of which with one or more huge hits and several minor hits.  As a point of reference, I've seen 3 of these artists (Tommy James, Robbie Grill & the Grassroots and the Buckinghams) in concert over the past 10 years.  The DVD sound and video quality is perfect. The voice quaility of most of the singers is excellent as well, notably Tommy James, Robbie Grill and the showman Peter Noone.  It's obvious too, that while Gary Lewis had a number of great songs in the mid 60s, his voice is marginal at best. The DVD presents array of 19 top songs from the artists, one more captivating than the next. I highly recommend it. I will say that given all of the old hits from these artists, this easily could have been 2 or 3 DVDs.",1293753600,13,1085,4.299019607843137

3374927,3,B00155H5TI,"Bought this based on price and reviews I read. After viewing it, I rate it as disappointing at best. Mark Lindsay was pretty bad and the others better.
