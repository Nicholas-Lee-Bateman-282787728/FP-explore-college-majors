8162980,4,B000LP6KX0,"This is a very informative and interesting DVD of the Punic Wars.  Unfortunately, unlike most History Channel, Discovery, or Arts and Entertainment DVD's this is mostly animated action.  However, it is well worthwhile in that the narration of the history of the Punic Wars is indepth.  I would recommend this DVD for those with a deep interest in ancient history as an addition to one's ""library"".",1235260800,2,397,4.984848484848484
8162981,3,B000LP6KX0,"An easy to follow history of the three Punic Wars between Rome ad Carthage. Not with historic pictures of ruins etc. But supported
by reanact actors and a small portian of computer animations and maps.
A bit amaturistic, but you get the picture.
Supported by good comments of historians. Maps are very simple and show no detail. Army formations only shortly explained.
A bit old doc (90's), as you will see by cloths of the historians.
50 minutes of easy history, nothing spectacular.
Not interesting for the experianced amature historian.
Nice for interested (older) kids.
