8721847,1,B010CG2FP4,"Watching the trailer, I could not hear the dialog, as the music was too loud.  It's a technical problem that stymied the production team, due to two competing requirements, first, that the music cannot drown out the voice, and, second, that the music be loud enough for its quite good groove to generate excitement.  Maybe ducking would be the way to go.

I am afraid to spend money on viewing the movie, however, as I find trying to listen to soft dialog and loud music tiring, although sub-titles are a huge help.  But why is this becoming a problem in films of the past decade or so?  It never used to be a problem.",1452816000,,618,4.385964912280702
