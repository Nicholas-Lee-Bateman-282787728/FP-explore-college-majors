8541472,5,B009H3LOTM,"Experimental, visceral, atmospheric view into the mind of a suicidal girl. This movie encapsulates the shadowy, sinking feeling of being hopelessly alone... The girl is caught in a purgatory-like state of grief, too caught to move on. I highly recommend this movie, and suggest accompaniment of your favorite ice cream and a box of tissues.",1445212800,,340,5.2
8541473,1,B009H3LOTM,"Lindsey (Sandy Behre) is in despair. Her parents died a year ago and she still mopes about the house. She is almost non-responsive in life as her bad actor brother (Henrique Couto) explains over and over again she must move out so they can sell the house. Not only does he explain this to her several times, but goes home to a web cam and explains it all over to us again in case you missed that plot point.

Lindsey is dysfunctional. She sucks at work, school, relationships, and killing herself with a Trac II. The first hour shows us that college girl Lindsey can not function. The film is done entirely with a hand held camera, although not all scenes are being filmed by anyone other than an off screen camera man. Coupled with the horrible lines and acting, the film ranks as purely amateur with little entertainment value. With 20 minutes of film left, Lindsey assumes the DVD cover position, pushed to edge by bullies. Not much of a horror film. It is a bad concept drama with a slasher ending.

Not worth a viewing at any price.

8541474,5,B009H3LOTM,"One thing that usually hamstrings microbudget movies is that they have to rely on friends for most if not all of the acting. In the case of Henrique Couto, he is able to rely some really talented friends. Bleeding Through stars Sandy Behre as Lindsey an emotionally shut off young 20's girl. She has little or no social skills and is constantly bullied by fellow college students. She is also being pressed by her older brother (portrayed by Mr. Couto) to move out of the house left to them after the death of their parents. She finally sees some positive things when she befriends Katie, a fellow college student portrayed by Ruby LaRocca but is she really her friend or something darker. When Lindsey finally snaps and lets her dark side out the film takes a real dark turn. Great cast with Josh Lively, Justin Channel, and Zane Crosby portraying the bullies along with George Hrab as one of Lindsey's Professors. Well worth the purchase and very engaging. The extras are also a hoot to watch as is the commentary.",1374019200,2,1016,4.65
8541475,5,B009H3LOTM,"At one point in the commentary track, director Henrique Couto describes BLEEDING THROUGH as an experimental drama-horror. That's probably as apt a description you'll get in such concise terms. Speaking of commentary tracks, the fact that I ever hit play on it speaks loads for the movie. I'm not a huge commentary track guy - unless I REALLY dig the movie. And BLEEDING THROUGH I dug like a miner. It's overall minimalism contribute heavily to its effectiveness. Be warned, horror buffs looking for 90 minutes of violence need search greener pastures. Not that this lacks gore, the final act is an impressive and effective revenge montage, a string of satisfying deaths. But the rest of the movie is build-up - NECESSARY build-up. The story itself is fascinating and the natural, convincing performances by all involved - not to mention the switching back and forth between cinema verite in which the camera is part of the story, presenting recorded footage of some of the characters and more straightforward cinematic narrative in which the camera is merely the invisible eye through which one sees the story unfold - like with most movies. Except BLEEDING THROUGH isn't most movies. It functions as a somber, penetrating character study that builds to a violent climax. In that way it shares, broadly speaking, a similar arc as Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver. But the comparison I REALLY want to make comes by way of my pointing out how much I was reminded of the works of Jess Franco in places. Both Couto and Franco are auteurs who know how to use minimalism to maximum effect. BLEEDING THROUGH is riveting as it builds and the [deleted to dodge spoilers] makes for a hellacious, climactic vengeance-soaked denouement. BLEEDING THROUGH is darkly artful, executed brilliantly on all levels and stands out strong. I related to the tale of an underdog pushed too far, thanks in large part to a strong story and powerful performances from all involved, most notably Sandy Behre's central performance that ties the film together. BLEEDING THROUGH is an excellent piece of indie/arthouse horror with a Franco-like deftness at spawning art from a teensy budget. It's early, I know, but I can see this being one of the best horror releases of 2013.

8541476,4,B009H3LOTM,"If you look back about twenty years and compare it to the present state of low-budget filmmaking, there is a vast difference. Why? Well, because technology has made it possible for anybody to grab a bunch of friends and shoot a movie. So, what sets BLEEDING THROUGH apart from the rest. It is plain and simple. Heart!

You can tell that the people that assembled for this production care a great deal about filmmaking and it shows. The two lead-actresses Sandy Behre and Ruby Larocca are the standouts in the film. I was very impressed with these two ladies and the work they did in the movie. But, no movie can be successful unless you have a good Director. Henrique Couto has proven numerous times, that he knows how to put together a quality film.

I say this quite often when I review low-budget indie flicks. They are not for everyone. But, if you truly appreciate the work it takes to put together a film project. Then this is something you shouldn't miss. I really enjoyed the hell out of BLEEDING THROUGH.",1369958400,2,1013,4.56043956043956
8541477,5,B009H3LOTM,"I just finished watching this film and it is visceral experience. The film tackles loss and mental illness in both subtle and overt ways. The soundscape is effective and adds to scenes that in less capable hands would fall flat. Henrique Couto is a true find. Support his work!

8541478,5,B009H3LOTM,"Best movie i have seen in a long time. Lots of twists and turns. Its different from your normal story line and leaves you with that ""dude that was crazy"" feeling in your stomach!!!! You should not even question seeing the movie just shut up and order it and you can thank me later!!",1363996800,2,282,4.2407407407407405
8541479,5,B009H3LOTM,"This is why I love independent films.  I may watch a few less than stellar indie movies, but it makes it worth it when I watch a movie like this.  This movie draws you in emotionally and then takes you on a twisted horrific ride as it approaches its climax.  If you enjoy films where the main character gets pushed over the edge by those they feel closest to, then this is a movie you should definitely enjoy.",1358726400,2,409,4.217948717948718
8541480,4,B009H3LOTM,"I saw this on the opening night, and I was pretty much blown away.  The film is full of intensity, and a lot of the scenes leave your skin crawling.  The budding friendship between the two girls was funny and sweet though some of the romance seemed a little contrived.  My favorite part was definitely the build-up to the violence as well as the closing scene, which was just beautifully filmed.

Overall, Bleeding Through has a few issues and hiccups, but it's a highly enjoyable film with some flashes of true genius.  This was the first Henrique Couto film I've ever seen, and it made me eager to watch more.  Keep them coming, sir!",1358294400,,635,4.526315789473684
8541481,5,B009H3LOTM,"Lindsey (Sandy Behre) is a shy girl. She is also going throuhg a lot. Her parents are dead, her boss is a jerk, her teacher at school is a letch and her brother continually nags her that they have to sell the house. Lindsey is showing signs of depression that are completely ignored by everyone around her. Her boyfriend thinks she's just being an ice queen.
Then she meets Katie (Ruby LaRocca). Katie is funny and spontaneous and tries to bring Lindsey out of her shell. Lindsey has started being happy, dressing up and in love with Katie.
All is going well.
Then the betrayal occurs that sends Lindsey to a tub of warm water and a razor. That one straw has been broken and she can't stand to be alive anymore. She slices her wrists. (Note: This actually occurs at the beginning of the movie so, I'm not giving anything away here. Back to the review)
Lindsey's lifeblood oozes into the tub and she dies.
Then she comes back.
What comes out of that tub of gore is the opposite of everything Lindsey is and is interested in one thing...revenge!
Director Henrique Couto has made quite a discovery in his lead actress. Sandy Behre is one of the most captivating actresses I have seen in a long time. She reminds me of a very young Lina Romay. She conveys the anguish that people who live every day with depression so well. In the transformation she becomes this cold, inanimate angel of death that frightens the viewer.
See, Mr. Couto did something interesting. He gave us a film that forces us to invest time in Lindsey. Where no one else in her cinematic world realizes the demons she battles on a regular basis, Sandy Behre conveys a young woman's tortured soul. Everytime she has a breakdown for whatever reason it breaks our heart to watch. So, bravo to Ms. Behre. She did good. Very good.
A huge fan of Ruby LaRocca since forever it was nice to see her in this supporting role. She switches from sweet to creepy to mean as Hell in the drop of a hat and this was a really serious role for her. I know Ruby can do drama and this just proves it once again.
In the end Bleeding Through is an intense drama that deals with serious issues of depression, suicide and discovering one's sexuality disguised as a pretty cool supernatural revenge flick.
Bravo, Mr. Couto. Well done, sir.",1357603200,6,2279,4.480769230769231
