8219417,3,B000VLZ76A,"I like seeing things in the making, as most artist do
so this DVD was a bit of a disappointment and SOOOO longwinded.
I'm sure it's part of the Brit personality (haha).
While I was very interested in seeing some fancy techniques,
this one bordered more on the mundane - in other words,
you could have probably read something about Angelina online,
and got just as much information for FREE.

While I am now stuck with the DVD - I could have
done a better job in the production.  Fancy music,
and lots of interruptions does not a good instructional DVD MAKE.

Save your money - request your local library to carry a copy instead.

And if anyone wants to invest in putting together a DVD for Angelina instruction -
CALL ME!  I think I could make it more fun, informative & lots more creations.
