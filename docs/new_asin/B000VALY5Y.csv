2934503,3,B000VALY5Y,"It's colorful enough, and holds a child's (especially a toddler's) attention but I don't really see any relative educational value, compared to the Leapfrog, Wordworld or Sid the Science Kid series. It's very abstract, and may be good for stimulation, but as far as directly conveying math, spelling or other facts...nil. To top it off, the only word used is ""hopla..so after building the image of an apple, it says ""hopla"" instead of apple. I want my toddler to learn that an apple is an apple, not a ""hopla""...so given that I have about 40 educational videos to play for them, I won't be encouraging this one. If my three year old asks for it, which I'm sure she will sometimes, since the Wordworld videos are so inconsiderately laoded with previews for Hopla (the reason I even bought it...so they don't experience the ""advertising effect"" of longing for something they don't have but have only seen on commercials)then I will play it for them, but I'm personally hoping it won't keep her interest in the long run. (as opposed to her attention once it's already playing) Awards aside, I thin there are much better kids videos out there if you want them to come away from the screen having learned something. Creative stimulation, on the other hand, is hard to gauge..but I'm sure Hopla doesn't have a monopoly on that. Unless your kid is demanding it, or you've exhausted all other options (leapfrog, wordworld, dinosaur train, superwhy, blue's clues, fundamentals, sid the science kid, wubbelous world of dr. suess, cat in the hat knows alot about that, zobomafoo, etc) then you are better off picking any one of the above at random.",1310860800,2,1637,4.808510638297872
2934504,5,B000VALY5Y,"My two year old granddaughter was enthralled with this video!  Although there is very little talking, there are sounds and the video moves at a fairly quick pace, so children remain attentive.",1310774400,,192,5.0
2934505,5,B000VALY5Y,"i looked everywhere for a hopla dvd and i not only found one here it was a great price my daughter loves this show, so now i have a back up plan if she gets upset i just pop it in and instant happiness, thank you hopla!",1300924800,,219,3.6808510638297873
2934506,5,B000VALY5Y,"This is a cutesy first DVD to keep your child's attention.  I bought this because it was featured at the end of his Word World DVD and he just loved seeing this little rabbit jumping around and started pointing and telling me what stuff was.

My son is 2 now and still loves it and it also holds the attention of my older niece's and nephew's as well.",1298764800,,351,4.147058823529412
2934507,5,B000VALY5Y,"A unique avocal arty educational video.  Illustrating the concept of Hopla in and interacting in a simple perfect environment.  Assembleges of computer constructed pictureque hypnotic settings.  Landscapes condenced to the essentials of primal shapes, colors, movement.

Within this hypnotic setting the child is subtly influenced (educated) by the actions at hand.  Picking fruit, walking through a park.

The Belgium sound track adds immensely to this project.  A pure balanced european computer generated accordian gains emotional resonance with the mesmerizing video.  Sad basic music tapestry.  A perfect match.

Hopla lives in a mini-universe of geometric composition and basic music and you cannot help but appreciate the artistry.  Highly reccommended.",1295136000,,760,5.944444444444445
2934508,5,B000VALY5Y,"My kids love watching this and never get bored, even with many repeated viewings. The colors and shapes are vibrant and jump out at you. Great for toddlers.",1272412800,,156,4.607142857142857
2934509,4,B000VALY5Y,"While it's not the likes of Baby Einstein and others, it holds it's own. The music and simplistic pictures captivate my children's attention. This is played at least once a day here.",1268179200,,182,4.71875
2934510,5,B000VALY5Y,"I played this for my 13-month-old granddaughter and observed her stop in her tracks to watch it.  It drew in her 4-year-old sister too, then my 11- and 12-year-old kids.  I sat with them and was almost as absorbed as they were.  I had them for four days and started using it for her nap time.  Her crib was in the family room. I'd sit quietly with her. Instead of screaming at nap time (the norm), she'd stand and watch Hopla, then sit, then lie down to watch it.  Shortly, she'd be sound asleep.  They watched it over and over again.  Just bought it for Christmas.",1259539200,2,565,4.273584905660377
2934511,5,B000VALY5Y,My 2 year old absolutely loves this series of DVD's. It is perfect for her age; it slowly introduces images and she has time to name everything she sees. It helped her learn many new words. I would recommend this and buy it as a gift any time.,1231804800,,243,4.083333333333333
2934512,5,B000VALY5Y,"I am SO excited that Hopla is coming to the US!!  It is huge in Belgium, where I was first introduced to Hopla.
This is the sweetest show, and I am preordering it for my little niece.
I highly recommend these titles for anyone with young children- it's really wonderful!!",1194566400,,271,4.42

8217806,5,B000VALY5Y,"I bought Hopla for my two-year-old son. His older brothers like to watch it too. Simple design elements set to music, the characters remind me of toy figures. The facial expressions do not change, the arms and legs don't bend. Little kids get drawn in, lead them to expect one thing to happen, then get surprised by the final outcome. Lots of laughs from all three of my little boys, aged two to five.",1453593600,,401,4.4324324324324325

He has been watching it for almost a year and now he is starting to  understand different shapes and colors. It's a great dvd ..Purchased two different Pocoyo dvds.",1413417600,,216,4.4

8217810,2,B000VALY5Y,My little boy is 2 he really didn't like this DVD and neither have any of our friends. I'd say its for a very young child and even then it's no baby Einstein or meet the letters which are both wildly educational and popular with our friends and family,1368748800,,251,4.142857142857143
8217811,4,B000VALY5Y,"The video is silly and the only spoken word is ""Hopla.""  The video is very low key and relaxing for little ones.  The colors are bright and it keeps my son's interest.  The video will not teach your kids calculus or how to build atom bombs but it will entertain them.",1344902400,,267,4.196078431372549
8217812,5,B000VALY5Y,"Title says it all! Seller was prompt, packing good, item as described. My daughter loves Hopla, this is great for little ones! Cute animation, cute music. First saw on baby tv",1324771200,,175,4.67741935483871
