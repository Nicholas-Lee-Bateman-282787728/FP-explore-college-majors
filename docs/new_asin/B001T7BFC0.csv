3788239,5,B001T7BFC0,"I just bought a Sunny spinning bike and this DVD.  I have never ""spinned"" (spun?) before - but I wanted some form of exercise in the house during winter months.  I ride a road bike almost every day during summer - but am not hard core cyclist - I usually wear flip flops while riding my 1975 Motobecane.

This DVD is great way to motivate oneself while spinning.  As a beginner - 47 YO and overweight - I could not always keep up with the cadence of the other riders - but I simply backed-down the suggested resistance or hand position or ""sitting/standing"" position a notch or two - and completed the workout.  Eventually - will be able to match perfectly.

At end of workout - clothes were soaked with perspiration.  Not sure I would spin for 52 minutes without such a video.

Instructor Mike had good tips during the DVD ride e.g. lower your heel and ride on balls of feet etc.

Never been to a spinning class - until this video.  Will check out other titles in this series.",1348358400,19,977,4.348066298342541
3788240,5,B001T7BFC0,This is just like a spin class - you will be sweating like crazy! IT is not a good beginner leverl but you can take it at your own pace by adjusting the resistance.,1347408000,5,164,3.8529411764705883
3788241,5,B001T7BFC0,"This is a fantastic video, and a great workout! Definitely not for beginners, at least in my opinion... But the more you do it, the easier (not really!!) it gets. I love this DVD!",1346630400,3,179,4.294117647058823
3788242,4,B001T7BFC0,"I just started spinning for exercise and ordered this video the same night I ordered my spinning bike.  The video is well done and contains some cadence music/beats.  The only thing that knocked a star off my rating is that it is an advanced routine.  Yes, I know, nothing in the title states ""beginner"".  However, for a 44yr old guy to keep his HBR below the 75% range was almost impossible  with this video (I want an aerobic workout, not an anaerobic workout).  I'll keep this video securely tucked away so that I can reevaluate it after a few months of spinning.",1337472000,29,566,4.5
3788243,5,B001T7BFC0,my wife and I enjoy the realistic challenge and motivation provided by the instructor.  We both realize how terribly out of shape we truely are. The dvd provides us the freedom to spin on our time schedule and not have to worry about the stress involved in wondering if we will get bikes at the gym.  I do recommend this dvd,1337126400,23,324,4.295081967213115
3788244,5,B001T7BFC0,"This Spinning workout is perfect for beginning spinners and advanced alike! Mike Michels does a great job taking the spinners from how to be safe on the bike, to an effective warmup, to climbs and hill climbs. He also has you check your cadence so you are spinning at your maximum efficiency. He reminds the spinners that this is their ride - and to take it at your own pace. The cues are excellent - both Mike's verbal cues and the written cues on the screen. You could easily do this workout without the soundtrack, substituting music you like.

I find the more I use the video, the stronger my legs have become. The cadence is not high because you are using the power of the pedal - seated and standing - to do some serious hill climbs. You will be using some high resistance in this workout to be able to do the slower cadence - but you will feel terrific after you finish the ride. The workout is motivational - but not obnoxiously so.",1331078400,22,940,4.340909090909091
3788245,5,B001T7BFC0,"I started out participating in spinning classes and this spinning video is much more like a true spinning class.  The lighting is always dimmed in spinning classes as in this video and music is played in the background.  Mike Michels is very down-to-earth and he does a great job coaching the spinning riders into a demanding ride that benefits everyone.  He is very friendly and his music in this video would be liked by mostly everyone.

I highly recommend this spinning DVD for everyone.",1257897600,35,490,4.7976190476190474
3788246,2,B001T7BFC0,Would not recommend.  You'd be better off watching TV...,1461283200,,56,5.222222222222222
3788247,5,B001T7BFC0,Quick 45 workout but you will burn calories and work on strength building. Excellent instructor. Totally recommend.,1460937600,,115,5.823529411764706
3788248,2,B001T7BFC0,"The reason I like spinning bikes is because of the variety that most spin instructors work into their workouts--jumps, hovers, climbs, sprints, etc.  Unfortunately (for me) this video is NOT that.  It is one verrrrry long climb.  No sprints, no jumps, just....cranking up the resistance for climbing.  If that had been in the video description, I never would have bought it!

That said, if you are looking for a video to train for climbing, this might be a good choice for you.  It is a well-done video; the instructor does a good job of offering instruction without being annoying. Just not the video I was looking for.",1460073600,5,620,4.747663551401869

3788253,5,B001T7BFC0,great workout highly recommend,1453852800,,30,6.75
3788254,5,B001T7BFC0,"You really workout with this 45 min routine. How hard or light it is will depend on how much resistance you add to the flywheel. Follow the instructions from the instructor and you will not get disapointed. Note this is a strength workout so do not expect cadence above 80 rmp and you should not go beyond 85% of you heart rate in order to stay in the strength region.
I liked this instructor. He does not make you mute him with all the inspirational bla bla unlike Josh Taylor.",1453593600,,478,4.322222222222222
3788255,3,B001T7BFC0,I had high hopes but am a little disappointed.  It's an ok video but I've found much better options online.  I don't think I'll be buying any more from this line.,1453161600,,162,4.193548387096774
3788256,4,B001T7BFC0,"Decent workout. Gives you exactly what the description specifies. All climbing. Wish the music was louder, but I realize you need to hear the instructor. The instructor was decent. He knew what he was doing, but he's not super motivational.",1449878400,,240,5.025

I get quite a workout!!!",1444608000,,178,4.235294117647059

3788262,4,B001T7BFC0,"Never taken a spin class but wanted this to accompany new spin bike purchase!  I'm a fairly fit early 60's female; they do 3 rounds. . . I do about 2 1/2 so far.  Had to build up to that!  I enjoy this dvd though it works me pretty hard.  One can get a decent full body work out if you add strength to it.  It's good for beginners to intermediates if you modify it to your own fitness level.  The music is okay; leader a little 'hokey' at times and studio biker's too smiley to be believable. . . but, I recommend it.  Have 2 more difficult dvd's but have to work up to them; not ready yet!  lol :-D",1433203200,2,599,3.8925619834710745

3788271,5,B001T7BFC0,This is really a good one.  Mike Michaels has evolved and matured as an instructor since his earlier spinning releases.  Head and shoulders better than Spin & Slim (amateurish) and Spin and Burn (with Louise and Josh).  Pedal Power is one of my favorite workouts.,1403827200,,263,4.8

3788275,1,B001T7BFC0,"Well here's the thing. I bought this video ""used"" as it was no longer available new. I guess you can say I can't rate it because by the time I got around to using it I discovered that there was no DVD inside. I got taken for a ride all right! I won't ever purchase a used item again.",1393459200,,283,3.8135593220338984

3788278,5,B001T7BFC0,I like it a lot. I was apprehensive after reading some of the reviews. I'm very satisfied. The exercises are challenging enough for me. I'm not a spinning pro but I can hold my own in advance classes and this DVD offers the right challenge for me.,1374969600,4,247,4.276595744680851
3788279,5,B001T7BFC0,"I just purchased a spin bike and this video to get started after only taking 1-2 spin classes. This video is great for a challenging workout for someone who isn't advanced, as I am not. I like that the instructor is motivating but not overly annoying. He also helps you determine your pace/speed/cadence if you do not have a computer. My spin bike toggles through a variety of screens and I cannot view my RPMs continuously. The music in the video actually changes also to help you stay on track with speed/ cadence changes throughout the workout.",1373155200,8,547,4.649484536082475

3788281,5,B001T7BFC0,"I bought this to add to my spinning library.  When I first watched to see what I was in for, I thought it would be way too hard.  But it wasn't.  I love these Mad Dog DVDs because they challenge you, and help you build your fitness.  I'm 64 with a hip replacement a year ago and have become addicted to spinning because of tremendous sweat making, strength building, cardiovascular work out I get from this video and the others like it.  If I can do this spinning program, anybody can.",1367798400,9,485,4.285714285714286
3788282,5,B001T7BFC0,"This DVD deserves my 5 star rating. Master Instructor Mike Michels leads you through a vigorous workout that gets you off the bike seat several times, including a great end of workout challenge. The use of music to support cadence throughout the workout is masterful; better than the other 3 Spinning dvd's I own. Additionally, I believe Mr. Michels' instruction/coaching is professional and on-target throughout. I recommend this dvd for experienced spinning enthusiasts, NOT for beginners. There are other dvd's that would be appropriate for beginners.",1367539200,,554,5.453488372093023
