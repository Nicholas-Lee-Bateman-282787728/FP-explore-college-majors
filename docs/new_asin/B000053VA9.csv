7930151,1,B000053VA9,"Two women are nude briefly. They both have horrible, ugly, disgustingly ugly fake breasts. Whoever made this movie should be banned from ever masking another movie. Negative 100 stars",1523318400,,183,5.344827586206897
7930152,4,B000053VA9,"William Mcnamara stars as Sonny, a mute who loves to write, stare off into space, and see random visions about things he can't know about yet. Sonny's mother dies and after a spoon forehead test and a warning about the violence of guns, Sonny heads off to LA to visit his cousin played by Frank Whaley. His cousin repeats most of the things he says like ten times in a row. Jon Cryer plays a drug addict while Tony Danza plays a jerk. A retarded guy likes corn dogs. Vulgar profanity is common. Characters repeat lines over and over. After a series of events that make little sense, it all culminates in Sonny giving a heartwarming hug to his cousin at his time of his greatest vulnerability and everyone learns the value of the word her. If this sounds interesting to you, check this movie out.",1491264000,,795,4.4520547945205475
7930153,1,B000053VA9,"I have watched a lot of weird 'marginal' movies over the years and hardly ever 'walked out on one' (or the home-viewing equivalent) - BUT -  ""Glam"" just about had me 'running for the door'!  I purchased the flik primarily because it had Valerie Kaprisky in it (one of my favorite EuroEro hotties of the 80's) - I was curious to see what this 'later life' star turn for her might provide.  What I found was: very little of Ms Kaprisky buried in one of the most pretentious and annoying films I've ever popped into my DVD player.  It's evident that the director went out of his way to seek out some 'over-the-hill' B-list thespians to lend some 'star power' to this incomprensible train wreck of a cinematic experience.  Everyone and everything about this flik is off the scale and in your face to the point that, when there are a few moments of decent dialog, it is delivered in an affectated and/or hyper-rant format that obliterates any potential appreciation of it.  Acting, camera moves, editing - all designed to induce nausea. Sex and Drugs!?  There's a few good looking girlz scattered about & a tiny bit of throw away nudity and some scenes of people shooting up and snorting absurdly big piles of white powder - not exactly 'ground breaking' stuff.  I think you get my drift - I didn't find it particularly an enjoyable watch.  Looking at 'rave reviews' by others (who apparently saw something in the film that I didn't!) I'd have to re-hash the old saying: ""Well, there's no accounting for taste"" - brilliance or trash? - form thy own opinion!  Some people commented on gaining 'new in-sights from multiple viewings'... I couldn't even make it thru once!  BTW - I've got a copy I'd sell you - cheap!!!",1335916800,2,1710,4.6105610561056105
7930154,4,B000053VA9,"I saw this movie a few days ago and i must say was caught off guard. I normally do not enjoy movies involving drugs and sex but this movie shows a different angle to that kind of life style. It makes us see it for what it is. Now i remember Frank Whaley back when he did that movie which put Target on the map by acting like a dork. Well he becomes a serious actor and plays his part with conviction in this movie. The lovely Natasha is very hot and if Frank was was to choose between the two to spend the night locked in a department store, sorry but Jennifer would lose out. It's a common story line but this movie takes it one step further by making it for what it is.

I picked up this VHS tape from a yard sale for 25 cent thinking it would make a good blank tape for recording at the very least. Now it is going into my collection and will watch it again this weekend with some of my friends.",1188000000,4,898,3.934065934065934
7930155,1,B000053VA9,"They laid the hip and avante garde on so heavy that the film collapses under the weight of it all.  Some characters laugh incesstantly while others babble the same lines of dialog over and over again - for seemingly no other reason than to break with convention.  These unconventional scenes backfire terribly and this is one silly, mess of a movie.",1107388800,8,349,4.704918032786885
7930156,2,B000053VA9,I got the R rated one wanted nc-17. ( hope its better) slow no action too speak of. had a standout cast too.,1104364800,,108,3.739130434782609
7930157,5,B000053VA9,"This is a powerful movie featuring the ultra sexy and hot Natasha Wagner who really show her stuff in this sleeper movie. It's about a guy who discover the world of sexual pleasure in the streets of hollywood. Tony Danza is fantastic as her guardian and lover. It shows the true crime and violense as it never been seen before.  You would need a few viewing to understand the true nature of real life. I watch this over a dozen times and enjoy it more each time i watch it.
This type of movie is not for everyone. It put alot of the same type of movie to shame if u are into this type of movie.
A Real Keeper IMO.",1066348800,5,613,4.066115702479339
