8076483,4,B000A9QLBS,"This is Carol Butler's son writing this review.  This set was originally a two volume set.  Each volume contained two DVD's each.  In volume one, each disc contained 10 episodes each, making 20 episodes in all.  The second volume contained two DVD's with only five episodes each, making 10 in all.  There was also a bonus ""Lucille Ball Retrospective"".

The set was re-released in 2006 as a five disc set.  The same episodes, as well as the retrospective.  Most of the episodes on the first two discs are very good quality.  They appear to be the syndication prints that were seen on Nick @ Nite back in the 90's, so they're edited a bit.  But for the quality, it's worth it.  There are a few episodes on the second disc that are a bit jumpy.  That was the manufacturer's fault, because they weren't originally like that.  The jumpy episodes are the original public domain prints.  Discs 3 and 4 are all public domain prints.  They're a bit blurry, but still viewable.

Overall, a very nice set for any Lucy fan.",1276128000,,1011,4.533333333333333
