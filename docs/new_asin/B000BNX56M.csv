8475604,1,B000BNX56M,"I saw this movie on cable a few years back and loved it. It actually lead me to become a fan of Syren (the lead star). Problem is no one sells the version I saw, including here. They say it's unrated but it's not. I bought it and I could tell in the first scene. I don't know why they call it unrated when it's clearly not. Don't buy it. Do what I'm doing - keep looking for the real thing.",1300492800,4,390,3.8271604938271606
