8111680,5,B000ENUL4I,"I have watched this concert many times (this is my 2nd purchase and second review of this DVD - I bought this 2nd one so I could keep one at work - for those rare quiet afternoons when for some unknown reason, the phone doesn't ring, no one has any problems I have to solve, no bills to pay, etc.) I am simply enchanted by this wonderful concert.  Each time I watch it, I hear and observe more musical intricacies.  They are labeled Progressive Rock but it is not as simple as that - it is a musical sound unique to LANDMARQ.  It is unlike any other band I've heard. There are so many subtleties - really complicated melodies with sublime lyrics interwoven into each song.  Each member of the band turned in stellar performances - powerhouse vocals by Tracy Hitchings with inspired performances by Uwe D'Rose (guitars), Steve Gee (bass), Mike Varty (keyboards) and Dave Wagstaffe (drums).  They Rocked the Concert Hall to a full house, reveling in the Music of it all.",1405728000,,968,4.540229885057471
8111681,5,B000ENUL4I,"Formed in 1989, one could say that Landmarq were late-comers to the ""2nd generation prog revival"" headed by bands like Marillion, Pendragon, IQ, and Pallas. And while I enjoy Landmarq's early material, I must admit that it wasn't until lead vocalist Tracy Hitchings joined (in 1998) that they really knocked me off my feet, becoming one of my all-time favorite bands. The first album with Tracy, ""Science of Coincidence"", still rates as a personal favorite 8 years later, as do the 2 subsequent live releases culled from that tour. And although they have continued to be a popular live act in Europe, the last several years have probably seemed like something of a dry spell for Landmarq fans in the USA, with no new music to sink our teeth into, and no chances to catch the band in concert...Luckily, all that has just changed!...Recorded in November, 2005, at the Wynspiaski Theater in Krawotice, Poland, ""Turbulence"" is Landmarq's first ever concert DVD. It also provides the first taste that many fans will get of music from the band's forthcoming studio album (their first since ""Science"".) There is, in fact, over AN HOUR of all new music to be found here - obviously a big chunk of the new album!...So, how does the new stuff stack up???...After several listens over the last week or so, I must say that, not only does the new material NOT disappoint, but it is some of the freshest, most compelling, most creative new prog-rock that I have listened to in several years! While the last year or so has seen some fine new prog releases from Pendragon, Jadis, Pallas, The Syn, etc., in my opinion, this new Landmarq material beats them all! (others are free to disagree, so no hate mail please.) What we have here is five creative musicians at the top of their game. Not only are they masterful in their individual talents, but they gel incredibly well as a cohesive musical unit. The writing, arranging, playing, lyrics - it's all top notch! The current line-up consists of Hitchings (lead vocals), Steve Gee (5 string bass), Dave Wagstaffe (drums), Uwe D'Rose (guitar), and new member Mike Varty (keyboards). Varty should already be known to neo-prog fans for his previous work with Shadowland, Credo, & Janison Edge. And while this is his first recorded work with Landmarq, he fits in so well that it seems like he's always been there! Here is a quick run down of what to expect from the set-list: ""Entertaining Angels"" (a great opening number, with a majestic guitar/keyboard theme that leads into a melodic, memorable verse/chorus), ""Calm Before the Storm"" (a dark, ominous prog epic in 3 parts - featuring some fierce instrumental fireworks, unusual chord changes, and a more 'theatrical' vocal performance from Tracy), ""Prayer"" (a gorgeous piano-based ballad highlighted by powerful singing and a bit of 'lead bass' from Steve Gee), ""Thunderstruck"" (epic prog with more twists and turns than a good mystery novel! The tricky unison riff and elegiac 'climax' section are awe-inspiring. I also love the brief 'jazzy' section where Tracy does her best 'sexy chanteuse' routine!), ""Walking On Eggshells"" (a dreamy piece of art-pop, with some intricate  guitar/keys/bass interplay and a sensitive vocal), ""Landslide"" (an all-instrumental workout taken from the ""Infinity Parade"" CD. This is a superior version, with some nimble-fingered soloing from Varty and an extended drum solo from Wagstaffe), ""Timeline"" (an upbeat, melodious rocker with positive lyrics), ""Mountains of Anglia"" (a bristling prog-rocker with echoey guitars, infectious melodies, and a breathtaking climax), and finally, ""Lighthouse"" (taken from the ""Science of Coincidence"" CD, this makes for a thunderous encore piece, and nicely sums up everything that's great about this band!) After giving this DVD some repeated viewings, I must say one thing really stands out. Tracy Hitchings shows that, without a doubt, she posesses one of the most dynamic and distinctive voices in all of progressive rock. Not only does she NAIL every note (she does have a day-job as a licensed voice teacher, after all!), but her performances are full of nuance, originality, and above all else, feeling! Tracy also has an engaging, charismatic presence on stage, like she was born for this whole 'front person' role (she's also quite lovely to look at...but I digress :  ) Bassist Steve Gee also impresses. While many rock bassists just seem like background players, Gee has a prominent role within Landmarq's music, and is one of the only bass players I've heard with a difinitive sound of his own...As for the technical aspects??? The filming, camera work, and video quality on this DVD are among the best I have seen, featuring great views of the whole stage, and (when appropriate) some tight close-ups of fingers flying across instruments. The 5.1 audio mix is full-bodied, crystal clear, and sounds particularly great through headphones! (There is also the option of an standard stereo mix.) The special features are pretty good, too. I especially enjoyed the 30 minute interview with Hitchings, Gee, and Wagstaffe...Thanks to Metal Mind Productions for bringing this and other quality prog DVD's to the USA (I understand that a new Pendragon DVD will be filming in Poland soon.) Some of us might never have had a chance to see these great bands otherwise. Bravo!",1146700800,9,5327,5.052272727272728
8111682,5,B000ENUL4I,"For those of us that will probably never get a chance to see Landmarq live, this DVD is a real boon. The playing is stellar and Tracy's voice is spot on. The material is all mostly new stuff that isn't out yet on CD, so that's a bonus too. Lots of room for instrumental stretching out by the band, great sound quality and clear video.",1146268800,7,334,4.153846153846154
