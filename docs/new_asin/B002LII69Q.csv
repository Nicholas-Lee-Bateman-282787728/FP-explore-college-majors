3948291,5,B002LII69Q,"Elf and Christmas Vacation are my all time favorite christmas movies.  I love Vince Vaughn so I really like Fred Claus, too.  You can't go wrong with this collection. You will be laughing your butt off...for sure. I LOVE IT!!",1294531200,,225,4.6
3948292,5,B002LII69Q,"I bought this set as a gift for a grab-bag christmas party gift, and am pleased with the quality.

I was expecting all three discs to be jammed into one case, but they each individually have their own slim case.  I like that, not sure it would be a pro for anybody else though.

I've seen pretty junky packaging on multi-packs like this before, but was happy that this was much better than others I have purchased.

I'm proud to tell whoever grabbed mine out of the center that I picked out that gift set.

As for the movies, I'm not reviewing them.  We all know them, and mostly love them.  Fred Claus is the weakest of the 3, but certainly makes for a good throw-in to increase the value of the set.

Clear some time on the weekend before Christmas and pop in these DVDs!",1291593600,3,773,4.2465753424657535

3948329,5,B002LII69Q,"All three of these movies are hilarious the price was great, the quality of the dvds are great. On a different note I personally think that all three of these movies need to be PG-13, because of language and some suggestive content. I also liked that each dvd has its own sleeve. This is a great package set.",1358726400,2,308,4.327586206896552

3948331,4,B002LII69Q,"I ordered this 3-pack as a Christmas gift for myself this year, and I'm so glad I did!  Elf is my new favorite holiday movie--I've watched it four times since receiving these dvd's.  Will Farrell, Zoey Deschanel, James Caan, Bob Newhart and everyone in it are perfect.  Even my 91-year grandmother laughed throughout the silliness and said at the end, ""That was really cute.""  National Lampoon's Christmas vacation is a classic now, and I'd forgotten how funny the Griswald family antics could be.  Fred Claus has it's funny moments too, but is the least favorite of the bunch for me.  That one is the only reason this gets four and not five stars.  This 3-pack does come in simple packaging, with slim but sturdy cases for each movie.  Overall though, these will be permanently added to my holiday movie viewing queue.",1356566400,2,819,4.75886524822695
3948332,1,B002LII69Q,"I purchased this set for my boyfriend for xmas. After opening, we discovered that the Elf DVD does not work at all. We tried on multiple players that are very good quality and state of the art, but the DVD would not work and I had to force off my player because the disk kept struggling to try and play. The other two DVDs work but are low quality. Good gift in theory, but quality of product is not reliable. Since it was an xmas gift (and past the return window), I am not stuck with a gift that doesn't work. Would not recommend.",1355875200,,532,4.125
