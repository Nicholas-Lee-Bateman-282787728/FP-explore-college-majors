2829736,1,B000Q66PXE,"I must agree with the first viewer.  What in the world are you thinking?  I have been a staunch Amazon customer for years, but I am appalled that you would think anyone would pay $49.99 for Season One and $49.99 for Season Two OR $179.99 for BOTH.  Are the discs gold plated?  What train of thought went behind this?  Please say that it was an obvious error and that you meant to say $79.99 for both Seasons.",1186444800,70,408,4.246753246753247
2829737,1,B000Q66PXE,"This is the second time I have written a review for this item. I was the first to review this item some time back and it received numerous ratings. All I said was that it would be silly to pay more for the two pack than what they cost seperately. Why would you even market a product like that. I also stated that most HBO series were over priced anyway. Well I guess they didn't like it so here I go again.

Rome series 1 and 2 are awesome series. They are in my opinion the best series on HBO. That being said, season 1 and 2 seperately are overpriced. With that being said, why would anyone pay $180.00 dollars for a set of two when you can buy them individually for $45.00 less. It makes no common sense or marketing sense. ""You can buy either one for $70.00 or I will sell you both for $45.00 more."" Yeah HBO that makes a lot of sense.",1178841600,177,839,4.054216867469879

2829820,4,B000Q66PXE,"I have seen this series before and love it so much I wanted to own it and share it with my husband.  There is much detail (graffiti, costuming, sets, props, and more -- rich, and appearing to be historically accurate (as far as we -- or at least I -- know).  The story is well-told and comes to life, bringing to life also an historical period that has had great influence on our lives since.  The characters are multidimensional and well-acted and scripted.  Parents should be aware that there is nudity and sex as well as violence.  Unlike one reviewer, I did not find any of these (the nudity, sex, or violence) to be pornographic or gratuitous -- they served the story and were appropriate to the times and characters.  But many parents would absolutely consider this series adults-only fare.  The depiction of the religious practices, and their role in the state, was fascinating and rich.

I ordered this boxed set of the series in April of this year, and am finally (in October) getting a chance to share it with my husband, who really likes what he has seen so far. Unfortunately, disk 3 of season 1 is defective and does not play, so we are stuck, with appetites just whetted.  I cannot find how to get a replacement, so I am writing this review to see if I can get some help with that.  Another problem I want to mention is that several of the disks were stuck in their sleeves and came out finally with gummy glue along the edge where they were stuck.  This is a truly wonderful series, and I would certainly give it 5 stars if the problems with the dvd set itself could be corrected.  We at least need a working disk 3 of season 1 -- how do we go about getting a replacement?",1476489600,5,1687,4.371794871794871

2829924,3,B000Q66PXE,"This is my second attempt at purchasing ROME. Have only gotten into the first episode on this set, had subtitles which blocked lower third of picture. Went back to main menu, took several try's before got English turned on. Went back to movie, all went well for several minutes but when  the scene changed the sub-titles switched to French!. It's not worth the reduced price. Apparently quality control is not one of the manufacturer's professional capabilities. I don't know what I'll find in the remaining series...tune in later.

P.S. I'll keep it as am interested in the history of ROME, want see how accurate that history is portrayed, in spite of the poor recording (so far).",1452988800,,681,4.862068965517241

(2) For something this good, two seasons is simply not enough, so Rome is like the ultimate tease - got you entirely seduced and fully aroused, and then ... that's it.

Any road...  the two seasons on DVD is truly a treat to behold: gripping storyline, captivating characters (everyone's a villain), spectacular use of colors and music, the works.  HBO did a ton of homework and spent several tons of money on its production and perhaps that's why it only lasted two seasons.  In the end, Rome will leave you hurting and wanting for more.

HBO's exclusively (I think) British casting is superb; peppered with household names & many familiar faces, they all portrayed their roles to perfection. Baron Harkonen (a.k.a. Ian McNiece) as the newsreader was a pure delight, James Purefoy delivered a very creditable Mark Antony and Ray Stevenson played Titus Pullo with immense gusto and sympathy but it is not fair to highlight individuals; the whole cast worked together brilliantly.

Not being an historian of the period, I cannot comment upon the absolute veracity of the events or the authenticity of the armour etc., but the characters and plot squared nicely with other such accounts and dovetailed neatly with the incomparable I Claudius and Conn Igulden's Conqueror series. The political machinations, the hedonistic lifestyle of the wealthy and the underlying themes of the abuse of power and the price of honour all combine to provide immersive, compelling and coherent drama.

Yet another magnificently produced and lavish HBO offering; thank goodness somebody is willing to take the risk and invest in proper drama while the British media seems content to pander to the lowest common denominator, drowning us in cheap talent shows. Hoorah for HBO!",1421107200,,1486,5.1875

But, onions to Cleopatra (totally miscast) and the Egyptian scenes as the series limps to the end.
  A cast list should have been included - preferably in the booklet which outlines a bit about the characters.  Interesting presentation in a stiff paper book instead of plastic cases but it's a bit tricky to remove the discs without leaving smudges.

2830090,1,B000Q66PXE,"Knowing a bit of the general history of the beginning of the downfall of Rome where this series starts, the only thing I really thought about while watching this was what insight this series gives into the mindset of script writers and producers. History takes a backseat to tedious love triangles, weeping wife drama, evil bitchy women and their meddling behind the scenes. I have no doubt in my mind that we are seeing some producers venting the frustrations of their lives in form of historical drama.

And what drama we have, well it's extremely British. Romans who were renowned for being fierce fitness buffs are all portrayed as pasty, flabby, whiny limeys who act like they're in a cut rate British stage play. There is absolutely no attempt at realistic dialogue, it has this predictable dumbed down stage act feel to it that is utterly, incomparably British with a dull sense of modern cynicism. I do not doubt there was corruption but ancient Rome was a time of extreme passion, scenes such as Caesar's first meeting with Cleopatra should be absolutely enthralling and magical come across as half assed, like the makers barely had any interest in telling the story but much interest in comparing Cleopatra to a modern Hollywood starlet slut on drugs.

What little there is to salvage are the two main characters, two fighting men in the 13th legion who if the series were just about them with history unfurling distantly in the background but having major effects on their lives then this would be one of the greatest buddy action series in years. It's all too contrived and the first big battle is laughable, just 10 second shot of guys waving swords in the air in slow motion. Zero f***'s given by the producers to showing the massive scale of the battles, all the f***s given to showing someone's uphappy wife crying for 10 minutes before the next cheesy, too brief sex scene. For HBO, there's not even enough good sex to give your average 12 year old watching at home a proper session.

All season one has is an extremely gory but well staged gladiator battle scene, just watch that scene on youtube and don't bother. This thing stinks, it's flabby, unfocused, dizzy and stupid. Thank the gods we got Game of Thrones.",1419379200,4,2232,4.732647814910026

2830161,5,B000Q66PXE,"As a compilation of episodes that cover the end of the Republic of Rome, this series is superb entertainment. On several occasions I caught myself thinking: all this needs is Verdi and we have a new opera. As a dramatization of history, well... it depends on what you demand of a historical piece. Most of the protagonists in this series are not historical characters; indeed, two of the principal female figures are not: Servilia and Atia. The two figures around which the drama unfolds,
Pullo and Vorenus, are mentioned in Caesar's work on the Gallic Wars, but their fleshed out versions in this series are almost pure fiction. The subplots involving the familiar historical players -- Caesar, Mark Antony, Pompey and Octavian -- are often entirely invented.

But, don't get me wrong: this is superb melodrama, and the Brits just keep cranking out interesting actors and actresses. Like the memorable ""I Claudius"" series, ""Rome"" makes for high class soap opera.

Reliable sources reveal that  this series would have gone into a third season; all the creative people involved with the series were for it, but the funding went dry. Too bad?

I can't decide. Why? Well, the first season is more historical than the second, and it hangs together dramatically better as well. But the second is more fun.",1410048000,2,1300,4.922374429223744

This was the biggest, most lavish production in TV history, at least until the second or third season of Game of Thrones. Filming was done in Italy and other locations in Europe, and the massive production sets included entire sections of Rome as it was before the long rule of Augustus. He wasn't just bragging when he claimed to have found a city of wood and stone and transformed it into a city of marble. The authenticity of Rome is one of its biggest strengths, staying close to the historical accounts and portraying the Eternal City as it was in the time of Caesar and Pompey, Mark Anthony and Agrippa, Cato and Cicero, Brutus and Cassius, Octavian/Augustus. The streets are filthy and swarming with an endless human tide. Graffiti is everywhere, and in the opening credits, the camera takes us through the streets and alleyways, past markets and brothels and temples. The crude drawings of soldiers, gladiators and whores come alive, joining the paintings and mosaics devoted to the gods and monsters of the Greco-Roman pantheon.

The series begins with Julius Caesars' victory over Vercingetorix, the Celtic king who had united the Gallic tribes against their common enemy. Although Caesar was a Consul, along with his older and more respected son-in-law Pompey Magnus, he had been in Gaul for years before he finally managed to subjugate one of Rome's most ancient enemies. In that time, he had become very popular with the 'plebs', sending regular convoys loaded with the finally crafted gold and silver treasures the Celts were known for, and long prisoner convoys that flooded the city with slaves. Caesar's generosity and popularity, combined with his final victory and impending return to Rome, aroused the envy and mistrust of the senate. Accused of using the spoils of war that rightfully belonged to the public coffers to curry favor and 'buy himself a crown', the senate, led by the respected stoic Cato, tried to bring charges against him, only to have the motion vetoed by Pompey, seemingly still loyal to his friend and fellow consul. When his wife, Julius' daughter Julia, died during childbirth, their familial bond was broken, and Caesar finds himself at a dangerous juncture: he can return as a consul and equestrian, and hope he can find enough support in the senate to save himself from exile or death; or he can return as a general, with a sword in his hand, and lead his legions across the sacred symbol of the Rubicon, the line no legion is allowed to cross still bearing weapons and armor. The city still felt the wounds left by the civil struggle between Marius and Sulla, which ended with Marius taking flight as Sulla and his legions entered the city. Thousands of citizens accused of being loyal to Marius were executed, their possessions seized, a terrible precedent that would be imitated more than once. The 'Proscriptions' were a ruthless but efficient way of silencing dissent and recouping the costs of war. Even when everyone remotely connected to the vanquished enemy was long dead, another rich merchant would be accused and executed, his family enslaved, his fortune claimed.

Season 1 provides a brilliant, if condensed, account of Julius Caesar's remarkable victories throughout the course of the civil war, as he defeats Pompey at Pharsalus, and finally crushes the last of the senate armies led by Cato and Scipio. He then travels to Egypt, where Pompey fled with his family only to be murdered by the soldiers of a boy-king. Caesar dislikes the various counselors and generals who are the true decision makers, and decides to find the boys elder sister and wife, Cleopatra. Doing so sparks another war, but once again, Caesar is triumphant. And, according to Cleopatra, he has fathered what will be his only son... a contention which will have far-reaching and tragic implications.

Throughout the series, however, the primary focus is not devoted to the most famous of historical figures, but to two soldiers of the 13th Legion, the only soldiers Caesar ever referred to by name in his writings: Lucius Vorenus, a tough, heavily disciplined Centurion who has been away from his family for a decade, and Titus Pullo, a huge man and a fearsome fighter who has had a hard life -- in a time and place where that's really saying something. But Pullo is at heart good-natured, even if murder comes easy to him, and is as optimistic and hedonistic as Vorenus is a dour Catonian. The friendship that develops between these two very different men is one of the most patient, naturally developed, and believable ever portrayed on film. For hard men, their bond is a fragile thing, constantly threatened by one of the two men's failings. With the civil war at an end and Caesar now Dictator-for-Life, Vorenus is suddenly a powerful figure, made a Senator by his long-time commander. Pullo, however, having been shunned by Vorenus over an explosion of jealous rage, has sunk to cheap assassinations. Convicted and sentenced to death in the gladiatorial arena, Lucius stops a group of fellow veterans from rescuing Pullo. But as he watches his friend kill one gladiator after another, bravely dispatching his would-be executioners after they attack the honor of the 13th Legion, he is moved to action when Titus Pullo is finally too wounded and exhausted to face the giant sent out to finish and humiliate him. A stunned crowd watches a Senator of Rome step into the arena, where he does battle with the seven-foot warrior before him. He slays the colossus, then carries his gravely injured friend past the confused guards. While Pullo recovers, the two men become legends, with plays re-enacting the spectacle for the citizenry. It is one of the most exciting and genuinely moving scenes I can recall, but unfortunately, the goodwill of Rome and their mended relationship provides the two with only a temporary respite. As Season 1 ends with the assassination of Julius Caesar, Vorenus is struck by personal tragedy. As season 2 begins, Titus Pullo finds their fortunes reversed, and is at a loss how to help the friend who has saved his life so many times before. He summons Vorenus' commander, Mark Anthony, who manages to rouse him and give him an assignment... to take control of the criminal gangs of the Collegium, and make certain they are working in Anthony's interests, instead of against them.

Meanwhile, Mark Anthony has discovered that the bookish (scrollish?) nephew who is now the heir of Caesar, Octavian, is not to be taken lightly. After raising an army commanded by his friend Agrippa, he takes the battle to Mark Anthony, who has refused to pay him his inheritance, and is victorious. Octavian's mother, Atia, is Mark Anthony's lover, and she engineers a peace among the two so they can combine their forces to finally defeat the legions raised by Brutus and Cassius, who are killed in the fighting. The two men, along with Lepidus, a general who joined them when he ran out of options, form a triumvirate. Octavian takes command of Italy, while Anthony slyly pretends to concede, taking a territory which includes Egypt. Lepidus is left with the least appealing portions, but is smart enough to know he has been remarkably fortunate to end up where he did, and heads to the middle east. But before they depart, the three men begin bargaining. Each has made enemies, and some of these enemies are allied to another triumvir. And so another series of 'Proscriptions' begin, with each man callously throwing friends to the wolves across the table, in order to murder one of their friends for money and vengeance. Before Anthony leaves for Rome, Octavion suggests that they should seal their alliance by joining their families together. In a move that was intended to punish Atia for siding against him when Anthony refused to release his inheritance, Octavian stipulates that Anthony marry his older sister Octavia. He knew that Anthony and Atia had been lovers for many years. The decision wounded Atia, and for the first time she realized that her son had become a formidable and dangerous young man.

Trouble flares up again as Anthony stops sending the grain quota from Egypt to Rome, grain that Rome cannot survive without. Anthony hopes to stir up the Roman people and create animosity for Octavian. But Mark Anthony, like Caesar, has fallen for Cleopatra. After Octavian sends his mother and his sister, Anthony's new wife, to try and reason with him, they are both spurned. They do not return to Rome empty-handed, however, absconding with a copy of Anthony's Egyptian will, which Octavian has read aloud in the forum. It provides evidence that he has renounced the gods of Rome for Egyptian gods, and names Cleopatra as his true legal wife, since Roman law does not apply to him. Worst of all, it names Cleopatra's son by Caesar, Caesarion, to be his rightful heir and legitimate ruler of Rome. This did not go over well, and Octavion had all the just cause and popular support he needed to go to war. His right hand man Agrippa once more defeated Anthony at the naval battle of Actium. As the Egyptian ships were starting to burn, Cleopatra ordered her ship to flee. Seeing her leave without him, Anthony deserted his men, leaving them to their fates as he chased her back to Alexandria. It was not long after that they both committed suicide. The last threat eliminated, Octavian would become Augustus, the first emperor of Rome, and the Republic was truly dead.

Even though I would have loved to see more seasons of Rome, the story that begins with the defeat of Vercingetorix and Caesar crossing the Rubicon, and ends with the deaths of Mark Anthony and Cleopatra, and Octavion becoming Augustus, has a symmetry to it. In a way, I can't think of a more logical place to end the tale. It is the story of how the Republic died, and how the Empire was born.

The almost exclusively British cast is phenomenal; there are more memorable and award-worthy performances in this two-season, 22 episode series than a decade of every crappy network drama combined. Ciaran Hinds has forever become Julius Caesar in my mind, just as James Purefoy has rendered every other attempt at playing Mark Anthony seem weak in comparison. His Anthony is exactly as I imagined him, an accomplished and powerful warrior who relies on instinct, a man defined by his desires. Hinds' Caesar, on the other hand, presents a version of the general, consul and dictator that differs from surviving likenesses and descriptions. He gives us a Caesar more regal and composed. This is not the athletic, energetic man who would joke with his men. But the force of his personality, the flashes of imperious wrath that break the cool facade, are too memorable for the rational mind to reject. Atia, played brilliantly by Polly Walker, steps from the fringes of history into the foreground, as a savvy manipulatrix who gave birth to a god. Kevin McKidd as Lucius Vorenus and Ray Stevenson as Titus Pullo are the unlikely stars that hold the Eternal City in their gravitational pull.

Rome remains my favorite series to this day, although Game of Thrones and The Wire are very close behind it, and other shows, like Breaking Bad, or Band of Brothers-The Pacific, are also in the running. HBO were willing to commit to another season, but their British partners, who are used to doing 6-episode seasons, were happy with the 22-hours of material they had. But I truly believe that if HBO hadn't created the vast, expensive, and risky masterpiece that is Rome, there would be no Game of Thrones. It was the precedent the series set at HBO that made adapting a 5000+page fantasy epic seem feasible. GoT fans should definitely give Rome a try; so much of the intrigue and tragic, brutal, gut-wrenching twists are derived from Roman history (as well as historical episodes from Medieval England, Renaissance Europe, and the horse-soldier empires who emerged from the Eurasian Steppes: the Huns, the Scythians, the Mongol horde, etc.), the two shows almost feel related. For those who find themselves drawn to the decadence and grandeur of ancient Rome,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Claudius-Classic-Collection/dp/1433213818/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Claudius: Classic Collection</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Claudius-the-God-Penguin-Classics/dp/B002RI9A2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Claudius the God (Penguin Classics)</a>, by Robert Graves, picks up roughly where the HBO series ends. It's big 'H', small 'f', 'Historical fiction' of the highest order, providing an overabundance of shameful Imperial secrets and obscure details that rarely, if ever, diverge from the extensive records. But Graves excels at navigating a course through disparate and contradictory sources. As one of the world's most respected classical scholars, with a translation of Suetonius' 'The Twelve Caesars' that has become the standard, Graves understanding of Roman culture and psychology is unparalleled. Coupled with experiences such as the long and horrifying ordeal involving trenches full of rats and rotting corpses called WW1, Graves is one of those rare writers with a firsthand knowledge of both the aristocracy he was born into and the hell on earth he found. 'Claudius...' gives us the fictional memoirs of the fourth, and unlikeliest, of the Emperors, looking back on his life shortly before he will be murdered by his second wife, Agrippina. He takes the reader back to the reign of Augustus, finally unburdening himself of the many terrible secrets he has kept, in order to protect his family and himself. The books were adapted as a mini-series for British television starring Derek Jacobi, John Hurt and Patrick Stewart, as well as many, many more. So there you go; a review that went on way too long, in way too much detail and segued into another review you weren't looking for and aren't interested in. It's symptomatic of the enthusiasm that a work as powerful as Rome inspires, unfortunately. This might be a terrible review, but Rome is definitely worth your time.",1406246400,6,14103,5.041148735533648

Definitely not for children, the events in the episodes are very mature subject matter (murder, profanity, torture, rape, etc), keep in mind its all presented in keeping with the time period; it did not feel 'gratuitous'.

The packaging is basically just thin cardboard but is presented pretty attractively, the individual seasons are each in their own blu-ray  case.

As far the cinetography, acting etc...I put this maybe one notch below Game of Thrones which is pretty high praise considering how great GoT is.",1400630400,,690,5.017543859649122

I've watched it probably 10 times by now, and each time, I still find little bits of detail in both the main characters and the background scenes.  The story is about the leaders, of course; Caesar and Pompey, but also of the senators and the running of the country, the wars, the soldiers and their families, and right down to the people in the streets.

Some people complain of the lack of historical accuracy, but we have to remember that it is first and foremost made for entertainment, and needs to maintain an element of entertainment to please and appease it's audience.  For the exception of artistic license here and there, I thought it was extremely well researched, well acted, and well done.

2830279,5,B000Q66PXE,"The only reason this series lasted only two seasons was its cost, because it's quite
spectacular. Besides the generally epic feeling generated by the setting in the
Western world's greatest city at a time when so many potentates and nobles are
jockeying for power, Rome is filled with lavish personalities. There are a ton of
leading players of all kinds--Lindsay Duncan as a noblewoman so imbued with
a sense of honor that she would literally rather die than live without it; centurions
turned middle-class entrepreneurs; slaves; soldiers; Ciaran Hinds as Julius
Caesar; Tobias Menzies as his Brutus; murderers; creeps; heroes; and even
Cleopatra. All their stories interlock to keep the thing unified, and somebody very
clever is in charge. I love the way the show switched from the actor playing the
young Octavian to the one playing the older version of the same character. I
won't spoil it, but it's very smart and surprising. It's also fun to see familiar
British faces popping up--the chauffeur from Downtown Abbey, the Nanki-Poo
from Topsy-Turvy, and even the dancing teacher from the stage musical Billy
Elliott. Don't miss this colossal event.",1395273600,,1153,5.138297872340425

It even has an option to learn more about Roman life as you're watching it.  But there's part of the rub.  It appears you must select this option in order to turn off the subtitles.  The first disk in the series had me shutting it off rather than trying to get it to cooperate.  I clicked the menu and found the option to turn off subtitles, but it is very misleading.  After messing with it a couple of times, I thought I had figured it out.  Sure enough, the subtitles were gone, at least until the next chapter came up.  Then the subtitles were back.  I went back in and turned them off again, and again, at the start of the next chapter, they came back.  So on the next disk I selected the option of learning more about Roman life, as it said that would eliminate subtitles.  Sure enough, there were no subtitles, but there were constant windows opening up telling me about Roman life even as the movie continued.  So I shut that off and guess what?  The subtitles came back on.  If someone can tell me how to turn off subtitles without having to do it for every chapter, please let me know.",1391385600,12,1250,4.282051282051282

It offers a nice balance between the larger-than-life historical figures and the more everyday kind of character while also staying relatively faithful to the histories.  The attention to detail from the costume/set designers is what really makes this series stand out.  Every set-piece and prop looks like it belongs and really creates a realistic atmosphere.  The first season is nearly perfect while the second certainly holds its own.

2830427,5,B000Q66PXE,"And so God made man/woman, and with them, sex, violence, passions, reason and insanity.

There is much to learn from this series, in my view, about all the above and what love is, and what it is not.

If you can make it through all the pornographic material, if you can avoid losing the valuable things this series has the potential to teach the observer of it, then it may help you come away a more enlightened individual.

There is some magnificent acting and directing achieved in this series and I believe, at some point, it is wasted on the excess of explicit sexual display -we get the point of decadence already.

Or do we? Because to me, the salient sense of point I came away with from this series was just that -excess and decadence when indulged in by human beings reduces, often to zero, their capacity for love -I mean, the real thing, not lust. It is a fascinating thing to recognize that the Christ was about to be revealed to all Rome next up in its history. Why did that Person who claimed that God is love appeal to so many Romans in the eventuality of time?

Perhaps because so much sex and violence drains all feeling from the human soul at some limit of its endurance, and it begins once again to long for the things of life, the feelings, the sensations, the spiritual awakenings that lift one past one's mere physical body and passions to seek a higher and deeper satisfaction and exaltation than mere physicality can ever produce.

Maybe that's what He came to show us, that lust for killing, for power, for any lie or cruelty that will obtain that for us, that sense of being our own little god, is delusional and an existential loser.",1381104000,2,1660,4.462046204620462

2830489,5,B000Q66PXE,"The two seasons are simple as for the divide between the two. The first season is the rise of Caesar from the conquest of Gaul to the consulship in Rome against the will of the nobles and patricians of the republic who wanted him eliminated from politics. Then he gets into the game, conquers Rome itself, the Senate and becomes the first autocratic ruler, hence the first emperor or a preview of what it was going to be. He had to defeat Pompey, the leader of the Senate who fled to Greece.

But he is assassinated by many patrician senators in the senate, the fatal and last blow coming from Brutus, the one he had defined as his trusted friend and spiritual son. Yet he must have known there was something wrong in that Brutus, especially when he refused to accept the governorship of Macedonia not to be sent away from Rome, since in his will he made Gaius Octavian, a nephew of his, his legal and sole heir.

The second season is the rise of the adoptive son of Caesar, his nephew Gaius Octavian, the future Emperor Augustus. This young man helps Mark Anthony, the surviving associate of Caesar, to negotiate the status quo and a general amnesty with the leader of the Senate Cicero and the patricians there. This compromise keeps Mark Antony in his position as consul, but Gaius Octavian manipulates the patricians and this leads to the sending of Brutus away from Rome, and later on with the downgrading of Mark Antony who has to escape with his own, legions north. Gaius Octavian then negotiates an alliance with Mark Antony against Brutus who is announced as marching on Rome. Brutus is defeated and Mark Antony will have to accept his exile to Egypt and Cleopatra, which will mean his end, defeated by Gaius Octavian, in fact defeated by his orgiastic love affair.

Note the two seasons correspond to Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and Anthony and Cleopatra.

The republic of Rome is finally dead and the Empire has taken over with one sole leader.

The history behind the series is rather simple. But what is original is of course the tremendous art displayed in the series to depict Rome at the time realistically.

First, we enter the family businesses and strives of these patricians who will bring the republic down and instate the empire just because of their personal ambitions and hostilities cannot find any peace and coexistence. At times the series is gross by realistically showing how women in this world are playing the plotting game better than any one else, among themselves, against one another or against men.

Second this is a slave state and slavery is everywhere. A free man or woman can kill a slave at will, if it is his or hers, and only with some financial consequences if it is someone else's: a sort of compensation for the loss of property, damages for the property damage. It is also shown how a personal slave is supposed to follow his or her master or mistress in death when death comes: the slave very often will help his or her master or mistress to die when time has come, and then will kill herself or himself on the dead body, otherwise he or she will be killed by the first intervening official, and surely in some refined torture. We are given one example of the torturing of a slave that is conducted by the woman this slave was supposed to kill, and he failed, and he will only be put to death out of his misery when he will have told the name of the woman who paid him to do it.

We often forget that the majority of the working population was composed of slaves, to the point of causing some problems with the free laborers of Rome who were unemployed or under-employed, which means  they had problem just plainly surviving because of this ""unfair"" competition.

Third the series insists on the sexual dimension of this society. Sex was part of this world and was always more or less public: less when only slaves could witness it; more when sex was performed in front of everyone in any occasion, in an orgy, in a brothel, or plainly in the street or at home at times in some celebration. The question of orientation is not over emphasized, I mean gay sex, though there are a few cases to make it clear that orientation was not a question that could divide people. Sex was sex. Sex was not love. Sex was exclusively entertaining. And slaves had no right to object against any kind of sexual action with them. Any free man or woman could take any slave sexually in anyway they wanted.

Fourth the next element I will emphasize is the extreme violence and the common spill of blood in any action. Fighting to one's death, killing to survive in any kind of public execution when a man was thrown into some arena against trained gladiators was common place. Assassination for a profit or to eliminate a rival or competitor was also part of the Roman game, and that was a game, a bloody social game. Have things changed today? For sure they have but not as much as one could think.

Fifth the series insists on the extreme level of superstition and religious bigotry, if not sorcery, at all levels of society. To kill, even in temples, was common place and if human sacrifice was no longer possible per se, though it was more than frequent to throw a criminal of any type, or a slave for any reason whatsoever, into a pit to be dismembered or whatever the whims of the gladiators down there would caress and entertain. Emasculation and rape were common place, both sexes in the case of rape. Capturing your enemies or the family of yours enemies, or the friends of your enemies and selling them as slaves was common place too. The various types of slaves are put on display constantly: personal valets or chambermaids, kitchen slaves, field slaves, but also sex slaves (for personal use), mining slaves (hard labor), prostitution (open and financially profitable slavery), all kinds of productive work from crafts to commerce, and then whatever entertaining activity a slave could be submitted to in an orgy, in a circus, in the street, out of a whim or some perverse desire. Most entertainments had to do with bringing one or several people to their unnatural death in some cruel display. The death of Vercingetorix is one case that is demonstrated in length, and his final execution will be in the Forum as part of the public celebration of Caesar's victory, part of Caesar's triumph. The strangest category of slaves are private counselors for the powerful. This reveals that slavery is in a way a trusted position accepted by the salves as normal fate and exploited by the slave-owner, at times with a lot of trust and even love; Caesar's private counselors was a slave and he was freed in Caesar's will.

Sixth the last element is the role the Aventine in Rome, the harbor and wholesale commercial center of Rome for imports essentially (corn particularly). It is in the hands of some independent and mostly violent corporations that have a lot to do with what we would consider today as the mafia. It is an essential stake for the Senate, for the Emperor later. They could block imports and thus famish the city, create an artificial famine. That's probably one of the essential segments of society that made the Roman Empire powerful. These corporations were difficult to govern but extremely powerful in a rather primitive market economy in a metropolis that had no direct surrounding environment that could sustain its economy and its population. It had to have an independent and powerful social organization that could guarantee the flow of imports. Octavian was particularly menaced by conflicts among them (both among the corporations themselves and between Octavian and the corporations) that brought starvation if not famine.

For all these reasons this series should be a favorite of people who like realistic non-cosmeticized history.

""Rome"" lacks Graves's Livia -- she lived later in history, but I am not sure that any other fictional character can ever match her -- but it is full of interesting characters, whom a viewer can vilify or with whom identify.

2830663,3,B000Q66PXE,"Five stars for the set, the costuming,  and the buildings!  All of it in this movie were superb! I can readily see the vast expense the producers and directors went to in filming Rome; they spared no expense, spared no detail.  All I can say is, if I had what the set for this movie cost in my checking account, I would be one happy camper.  All the critiques I read of this movie raved about it and thus prompted me to purchase the entire series.  My wife and I watched it together over a period of several days.

And we were both quite disappointed.

I gave the film three stars only because the costuming and sets were beyond phenomenal. I had expected to see a story of the Roman people perhaps covering several generations, something akin to The Rise and Fall of The Roman Empire,  but this was not to be;  instead, we watched an X-rated soap opera rife with family dysfunction, treachery, betrayal, coarse profanity, brutal violence, and graphic (and sometimes brutal) sex as stated by the editorial review. As far as I could tell, that is all there basically was to the entire story. The tale meandered hither, thither and yon and I waited in vain for the real point to the story, for the real climax, but the only climax I saw were the ones achieved by the Roman characters on the screen.  The story line had no real defined point and, for hours on end over 11 CDs,  just ambled and meandered from one incident to another, heartthrob to heartthrob, with no real reason or point to the story. At times, it was difficult to follow what was going on with some of the scenarios which I felt were injected perhaps as fillers from time to time to flesh out the allotted time, punctuated by crude sex, full nudity and foul language.  Yes, in human life, all these things are certainly a reality, but when one pays some $50 plus another $6.00 shipping and handling, I expected at least a story of some worth to accompany all this murder, nudity, flesh and desire. Alas, but this was not to be.

While it more or less held my interest, the story dragged on and on, slowly, never achieving any point in particular, jumping from one incident to another, and then suddenly ended as the bodies of Mark Anthony and Cleopatra were paraded by on a cart while the Romans looked on.  I was left with the feeling, I watched all these hours and it ends like this? Did the camera suddenly run out of film?

For those who enjoy the daily soap operas, with sex, cheating, nudity and so on ad nauseum, then Rome is for you.  However, please note there certainly isn't much of a story to it and definitely not worth fifty bucks.",1362873600,2,2611,4.419624217118998

The producers tried to be very historically accurate with even the smallest details, which I found very enjoyable, as I really hate it when historical dramas take too much license with the history and it ends up uninteresting and inaccurate.  They also did a good job with their portrayals of 'background' characters- people who existed at the same time as the historical events in the story, but their roles are fictionalized- these people made the whole thing more human, so that the main characters didn't seem like statues in their own story.

2830669,5,B000Q66PXE,"For Thanksgiving of 2012 we went to Denver, CO. to visit two of our children for the holidays. We split the visit between the two homes. While staying at our daughters home she asked if we had seen HBO's Rome Mini Series. We hadn't. She asked us if we would like to watch it, since she had the first DVD and hadn't seen it yet. We decided that would be great since we are all interested in the Roman empire and between us we had probably read almost every book we could find on it (my husband has Edward Gibbon's ""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"", and read it). For those who have not had the opportunity to see this mini-series...BE FOREWARNED!! IT IS VERY GRAPHIC!!! FROM THE BATTLE SCENES TO THE BEDROOM SCENES (some scenes weren't even in the bedroom, but you get what I mean). This leaves NOTHING TO THE IMAGINATION!! For about the first thirty minutes or so of watching we were all rather embarrassed. Not that the whole first thirty minutes was only gore and sex, but it wasn't long into the first DVD before both areas seemed to be covered very well. It took us awhile to adjust and since we aren't prudes we made some comments and continued watching the show. Then the actual quality of the mini series started becoming more and more evident to us. The actors all performed superbly. Each seemed very believable and almost were the characters they played. The building friendship between Lucius and Titus was the core of the series, their loves, hates and day to day problems made this series not only about the rich and powerful, but equally about the ordinary people as well. I've seen several Hollywood productions about Rome, Caesar, the Senate and of course Cleopatra. Those productions showed the city as spotless with white marble buildings and columns gleaming in the sun, while the citizens, both rich and poor, wore white tunics that looked as if they had just come out of a modern day laundry. THIS ROME IS DIFFERENT! You see the crumbling columns, the garbage in the streets with wild dogs and children fighting for scraps. Graffiti covers the walls of most of the buildings and is used to express the attitudes of whomever wants to have their say, or hurt an enemy. This series shows Rome in a much more realistic and human way. You will identify with at least one of the characters, if not more. You will love and hate any number of them depending on which episode you are watching. You will probably both love and hate them within the same episode. This shows the political intrigue that seems to be learned at birth. Women display their talents in this arena as well as men. The subtle, and sometimes not so subtle, battle between Servilia and Atia is a prime example. As I mentioned our daughter only had the first series. Before we left Denver I had gone on line and ordered the entire series. It was delivered before we got home. I'm glad I bought the complete series, we will watch it numerous times. In an excellent production like this there are always things you miss in the first or even second viewing. No wonder it won 7 Emmy Awards. It deserved every one if not more.
JUST REMEMBER THIS IS A VERY GRAPHIC SERIES!! However, in its defense it doesn't use sex and violence just to add to the selling  angle. It appears that during this period their attitudes where different.",1361577600,,3317,4.546822742474917
2830697,5,B000Q66PXE,I very much enjoyed the entire set.  Wll done and not just great acting but great direction and sets.  A bargain.,1361577600,,113,4.333333333333333

Great for enjoying ""movie night"" with your significant other. I will watch this over and over again for years to come. Well worth the money!",1361232000,,266,4.804347826086956
2830700,5,B000Q66PXE,Great series! I would highly recommend this DVD...the acting is amazing. I have watched it several times and saw something new each time.,1361145600,,137,5.0
2830701,5,B000Q66PXE,"This is an awesome series that depicts the fall of Julius Ceasar & the rise of Octavian & Mark Antony's brash charm & his realtionship with Atia & later Cleopatra, but this one also focuses on two Roman soldiers who share an unlikely friendship, this of course has all the trappings of a nightime soap, but that is what makes it good & downright fun to watch, while taking place in a historical context, Ceasar, Antony, Atia, & Cleopatra are portrayed well & are accurate to the historical context given what we know about them from scripture, when you watch this, one thing becomes clear.....human nature HAS NOT CHANGED IN 2000 YEARS......you get political manueverings, outrageous sex, extra-marital affairs, two women who are lovers, rivalries between two women both power hungry, gang warfare, sex slave operations involving one of the Romans daughters, betrayals, & of course many battles, everyone embodies these characters, especially James Purfoy as Mark Antony, & Polly Walker(Patriot Games, Sliver) as Atia who has gotten more attractive with age, Cirian Hinds (the Russian president in ""The Sum of all Fears) is perfect as Ceasar, probably the best actor to ever play Ceaser, & even though only two seasons, everything is summed up nicely, it is a shame it didn't go a few more seasons, but I am sure that it was very expensive to produce, everything is authentic down to every last detail, it left me wanting more, however, I got more with ""Starz'"" own ""Spartucus"" which is a awesome companion to ""Rome"", both are very much alike but are different in many ways too.....Highly Recommend this HBO series!!",1361059200,,1616,4.944852941176471
2830702,5,B000Q66PXE,"By far the best telling of the Roman civil wars.  HBO knows how to do it.  Set, costume, directing, acting, everything: All top notch. My only problem: only 2 seasons.  If only their was more viewership they could have ran with the series and followed all the drama of the Roman Emperors which I think would make amazing television.

If you enjoy anything that is Rome, this is a must see.",1360886400,,389,4.436619718309859
2830703,4,B000Q66PXE,This was when HBO had good shows. Trying to make a comeback now. This series was very good. The First season was very good and deep. It had more action and the acting was very well done. Mostly a political show that showed how they did things. A lot of sex and violence and coarse language in both seasons. The second season was good but not all that. It fell off at times. Cleopatra and Mark Anthony story was lacking. Ending was not all that but still a very good series to watch.,1360800000,,482,4.193548387096774
2830704,4,B000Q66PXE,"The production, the actors, the scenery are all so good, it's a pity that every few minutes you have to return to the main menu to turn off the English subtitles.

2830741,4,B000Q66PXE,"This is one of the most engrossing and entertaining series we've ever seen!  It truly makes Roman history come alive--with all of its splendor--but also its seamier side-- and the political intrigues of the main characters are fascinating.  The story is told from the standpoint of two Roman Centurion friends--who are caught up in the shifting currents of Roman politics, sometimes benefiting and sometimes victimized by these changes.  As their stories play out, you witness the Roman transition from Republic to Dictatorship--and all the tumult that ensues.  The acting, staging and story-lines are first class!  WARNING - There is graphic sex and violence--probably not suitable for children under 17/18.",1359590400,,708,5.458715596330276

2830743,5,B000Q66PXE,The box set was a real bargain. Excellent packaging and fantastic picture quality. The show itself is a great romp through some of the greatest events in ancient history. Not always completely accurate historically it is still great entertainment. Unfortunate the series was cut short and they had to jam in so many events in the last few episodes. The fall of Antony is spectacular.,1358812800,,383,4.907692307692308

2830747,5,B000Q66PXE,"I have read several books on this part of history and this series provides a realistic and entertaining experiencing.  I am impressed with the detail and acting.  To get the most out of this series play it with the ""all roards lead to rome"" option.  It provides that additional detail to make you feel as if you are there.  The representation of young Octavian is very realistic, in my opion, based on other readings.",1358121600,,417,4.594594594594595
2830748,5,B000Q66PXE,"I'll admit that I got this 2 season series strictly for James Purefoy, and he is superb in it, but it was other characters that caught my attention immediately and kept it. Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson were sublime in this. I've been a fan of Kevin McKidd for quite a bit now but Ray Stevenson was a revelation. I think the writing was brilliant and the acting was fantastic and it more than kept my attention throughout. I was very upset when I finished the series and plan on re-watching it very soon. Absolutely brilliant show. Plus the price here at Amazon.com is spot on, everywhere else in the stores that I've seen this at the price for this version is over 80 dollars! This isn't so much for the younger amongst us though, there's full frontal nudity of both male and female characters and vivid sex scenes and it's very violent but that's how things were back then I guess, violent. Still that shouldn't make you skip this series, it's absolutely magnificent.",1358035200,2,970,4.580459770114943

2830796,4,B000Q66PXE,"HBO's Rome (2 seasons, some 22 1-hour episodes in all) is one of the best historical productions done with very close to authentic staging & costumes, excellent production values and the best video quality brought out in BluRay. Highly recommended, if you can take a fair amount of bloody battles and life's intimacies, shall we say. But as a means of immersing yourself in the times when Julius Caesar came to power and then was assassinated and Marc Antony and Octavian battled it out. Not a soap opera but a very realistic depiction of life as it might well have been at this time. Highly recommended.",1357344000,,604,4.7075471698113205
2830797,5,B000Q66PXE,"I got hooked on the series when I was reading about how true to actual Roman times the story was- clothing, religion, food, etc. Well worth a few hours if you like Toga soap operas",1357257600,,180,4.171428571428572

The entire set on multiple discs is housed in a beautiful box and once you start watching the story, you almost can't stop until you have finished!!!!  If Ancient Roman culture is your thing, this box set is the ONLY one you should have!!!  It includes every major historical figure--Julius Caesar, Augustus, Marc Antony, Cleopatra, Brutus and many, many others.  Woven into the story are many other characters who, more or less, are depicted as key elements moving the entire story along.  You come to know the different characters and the entire series becomes a part of your own life long after you have finished viewing it.  It bears watching many times over.  Be forewarned--it is quite graphic in its depiction of violence and sex.  Not for the squeamish or the prudish.  ENJOY!!!!!",1356739200,,859,4.828767123287672

2830864,5,B000Q66PXE,This show was one of the finest that HBO produced.  The portrayal of life in Rome at the time of Julius Ceasar is probably the most accurate of any show or movie.  The acting is first class and the story is fascinating.  The hours will fly by as you follow the intrigue and betrayal of ancient Rome.  If I have any criticism of the show it is simply that it was only on for 2 seasons.  The characters draw you in and you'll hate when it ends.,1355184000,,442,4.0344827586206895

2830948,5,B000Q66PXE,"If you haven't seen Rome then you can more or less ascertain that the series focuses on the tumultuous period in history where Caesar overthrew the senate, rose to power, and was inevitably betrayed by those around him. It's a classic, historical tale told here in a manner that is unlike any other. Rome has a take-no-prisoners mentality and it's not afraid to show the raunchier side of the ancient capital. Aside from the blood, boobs, and sex there are thankfully solid scripts and powerful performances backing every scene and action.

I kind of wished Max Perkis stayed on as Gaius Octavian instead of Simon Woods. Max was interesting from the get-go, and I don't see a convincing resemblance between them. Still both were good and the rest of the cast was splendid. Yea for Kevin McKidd finally getting a starring high profile role and doing it perfectly. A classic.",1334361600,,612,4.415929203539823

2830951,5,B000Q66PXE,"I discovered this series just as HBO was making the unfortunate decision to cancel it. What a pity. Bruno Heller has done a fine job of recreating and interpreting the last days of the Roman Republic. While the series is based on history and generally adheres to historical fact, it is far from a dry documentary or a badly costumed B-movie with everyone wrapped in bed sheets. The characters, real and fictional, are wonderfully played by a mostly British cast. The costuming is authentic and the cinematography is movie quality. Polly Walker is unforgettable as Atia, who plays politics and men with equal enthusiasm. The show's main characters, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, (Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson) are based on the only two ordinary Roman soldiers mentioned by Caesar in his commentaries on the Gallic wars. The discipline, organization and military engineering that enabled Rome's conquests are clearly depicted. Hollywood usually depicts combat in the ancient world as a kind of brawl with swords and sandals. Rome doesn't make that mistake. The characters, the costumes and the motivations ring true.

Be sure to watch the features and listen to the commentaries, which provide a lot of interesting detail on the choices regarding the synthesis of history and drama.

One more thing: This is a show for grownups and mature older teenagers. It includes graphic violence and sexual situations, which are part of the plot, not simply titillation or a crude attempt to build interest. If you can't tolerate the sight of a breast, buttocks, a penis or the bloody murder of Julius Caesar, don't bother with this series.",1332633600,,1631,5.059479553903346

I believe the producers tried to maintain historical facts as well as including some fictional characters to help the story flow.  It is worth the time to watch.",1330387200,,419,4.473684210526316
2830976,5,B000Q66PXE,"There are certainly some good reviews already on here. Overall there seems to be general common agreement about the great production values, great actors and realistic portrayal of Rome during that time - including the violence, tension, scandals and sex. Surely the writers took some liberties from strict history but for the most part does not seem to be an issue. There also seems to be agreement that season 1 is better than 2, but mostly expected due to HBOs decision to quickly wrap up the expensive series.

I thoroughly enjoyed the 2 line story-telling with the imperial families and Vorenus/Pullo. The show was great to see a lot of political maneuvering as well as action. I liked that it showed the more common, and dark, elements of that time as well. It was also interesting to see that the characters sometimes moved in or out of roles as villains/heroes as real life unfolded for them.

My regrets for season 2 were the lack of attention to the increased time gaps (done to move the story/history along of course, but not really bring home just how much time had passed, and the significance of the time it took to get from place A to place B back then). Also, I thought we might see more of Brutus in both seasons accomplishing more (rather than being so torn), and thought Cicero's portrayal as a coward was poor (the actor did great, just thought the writers taking that line left out better options).

Perhaps strangely I thought the best character was Caesar. Historical accounts have him as both villain and savior and Rome had him walking that line as well. I would highly recommend season 1 to everyone, I just wish season 2 wasn't so rushed.",1329955200,2,1665,4.656462585034014
2830977,5,B000Q66PXE,"I loved this series (even more so after watching the 1st episode of Spartacus).

The actors/actresses in Rome play their parts so wonderfully that it's hard not to like them all - even those who are supposed to be ""villains.""  The scenery is that of a big budget movie. And though they may have not followed the history exactly as it was, they do give a good sense of that time period. There is a good bit of nudity, but that was a big part of that culture and it's often just the beginning or end- not long scenes that distract from the plot.
I found the series to be more focused on thought than action (compare Elizabeth to 300).  It kept me and my husband so interested that we watched nothing else for weeks (if we didn't have 2 toddlers, we would have finished it off in a couple of days!).
My biggest complaint is that it felt rushed and covered such a short time period.  Also, the fight scenes are only a few brief minutes.  I don't need to see a bunch of killing, but I would have like to have seen some of the strategy behind one of history's greatest armies.

Oh well, I would still highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys period pieces or just complicated plots with conspiracies lurking around every corner.",1329523200,,1222,4.337719298245614

2830979,4,B000Q66PXE,"A friend recommended this series, stating ""you can't stop watching"". Like the book that keeps you up all night reading, this HBO series of Julius and Augustus Caesar captures your interest.

Howbeit, the series has serious shortcomings. It doesn't hold up to repeated viewing. Second, the colloquial British diction detracts from the action if you aren't British. Third, the domestic problems of Lucius Vorenus are insipidly melodramatic and tiresome. A fourth shortcoming is the abusive Forrest Gump theme: two simple Roman soldiers (Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo) repeatedly appear at crucial moments in Roman history and unwittingly exert immense influence: (eg, ""How Titus Pullo Brought Down the Roman Republic"", etc). While these two characters are very believable as portrayed, their deus ex machina appearances throughout twenty years of Roman history simply are not believable and are improvidently overdone. Such fusion of zany black humor with otherwise serious history *could* impart charm, but the humor is so overdone that it contaminates by dramatic osmosis other scenes that demand a serious tone. (Imagine Saving Private Ryan peppered throughout with brief snippets of McHale's Navy, or recall Jar Jar Binks in George Lucas's Star Wars prequels.)

On the plus side is the graphic portrayal of pre-Christian pagan values: These are hard people without sentiment for whom sudden death and chronic mayhem are daily occurrences taken in stride. One might meaningfully say they are spiritually dead people. Whether ancient Romans really were this scorpion-like and amoral is problematic, of course, but it's certainly refreshing to see a genuine attempt to depict an ancient culture *without* modern Humanist/Christian values.

The casting, overall, is superb. The characters are lifelike depictions consonant with Plutarch's Lives, Shakespeare's plays, and the historical record generally. Although Julius Caesar obviously is whitewashed into near-sainthood, you nevertheless can imagine you really are encountering the great man's spirit through the inspired acting of Ciaran Hinds. David Bamber as Cicero and James Purefoy as Mark Antony are doubly superb.

Again, while I don't feel Rome holds up to repeated viewing, this series is pretty amazing nonetheless. If all films were of this caliber, it would be a very different world.",1328832000,,2347,5.584269662921348
2830980,5,B000Q66PXE,"Yes, Brutus and Cassius and Cicero; Pompey Magnus, and a cast of thousands, brought to life in brilliant form in this masterpiece of historical period drama. No, you may not watch this series with your children, as language, sex and violence are as prolific as they are explicit, but this is, after all, Rome, or a piece of it.
This beautifully photographed, remarkably scored masterwork covers the rise to power of Gaius Julius Ceasar (Ceasar Augustus) and the accession of Octavian Ceasar, which would usher in 37 years of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.
What is more remarkable than the breath-taking accuracy of the art direction and production design, is the plain, old-fashioned, walloping story telling by which means the proposed personalities of these great and ancient legends are brought to believable life in a non-stop marvel of entertainment.

While not perfect historically, it certainly portrays Roman life and the overall chain of events much better than most movies or TV series which are based on history. I see several 1-star reviews here, which focus mainly on shipping, price, packaging, and damaged discs, but not on the product itself. A few people complain about the violence, language, blood and sex. Please keep in mind that the classical world was much different than it is today. One of the mistakes people make is that they try to apply a modern context to history. You simply can't do that. Also, there is a reason for the ""Mature"" rating.

2830984,5,B000Q66PXE,"What can I say about 'Rome' the series? It is fantastic!! When I first heard of the series, I was already hooked on the 'Spartacus' series, and 'Rome' had already been cancelled for quite some time. Since I'm a 'Spartacus' fan, and an afficionado of all thing ancient-Roman, I thought it would fit nicely with the whole theme, and fill the void between 'Spartacus' seasons (mind you, the series 'Rome' takes place AFTER the gladiatorial uprisings of the ""slave rebellion"" in which 'Spartacus' takes place). Only thing is....I ended up loving this series!!  Ok, for my fellow 'Spartacus' fans, 'Rome' is nothing like it. What it lacks in blood and action, it makes up for a more historically accurate, dramatic and beautifully crafted story. The pace is a little slower, the sets and costumes are divine, and the acting and the actors are superb (as are with 'spartacus'). Of course, it took me a while to transition from the 'Spartacus' mindset, but once I did (it only took one episode), I fell in love with 'Rome'.

You'll learn to love Titus Pullo and Lucius Vorenus, and Mark Antony is magnificently played. I was reluctant to accept the actor that played Julius Caesar at first, but I learned to like him too. As with Spartacus' Lucretia, you'll learn to hate the deliciously conniving character of Attia (of the Julii). You'll also hear a few similar phrases between 'Rome' and 'Spartacus', but don't expect the same epic gladiatorial battles as the latter. All in all, I promise you WILL enjoy the entire 'Rome' series. My only disappointment is that HBO decided to cancel the series after its second season, due to its expense to produce. Well worth every penny I would say!!! So if you'd like a historically accurate, yet dramatic and fun  representation of ancient Rome's political hierarchy I STRONGLY suggest you picking up this entire series. You WOn'T be sorry!! Enjoy!",1325980800,,1883,4.859813084112149
2830985,5,B000Q66PXE,"HBO's Rome two seasons (originally shown in the years 2005-2007) covers in twenty two episodes the twenty two year period between the battle of Alesia in 52 BC and the aftermath to the battle of Actium in 30 BC (Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 BC is shown at the end of the first season and the beginning of the second season). While several plot threads runs through the series, basically the first season is about how Caesar rose to hold absolute power (defeating rivals like Pompey) just before being murdered, while the second season tell us how after Caesar's death, a struggle began between Octavian (later emperor Augustus) and Mark Antony to fill the existent power void generated.

The series is centered round the lives of two friends and comrades from the campaign in Gaul, the hot tempered Vorenus (played by Kevin McKidd, who looks a lot like Daniel Craig) and the more amiable Pullo (played by Ray Stevenson, who looks a bit like Mel Gibson and another bit like Russell Crowe) They both existed historically (two centurions bearing those names are mentioned in Caesar's Commentaries on the War in Gaul), but little else is known about them, so most of what is shown in the TV series is invented. The rest of the cast is mostly British, none of them very famous (most of them come from a BBC high drama/theatrical background) but they mostly acquit themselves fine: James Purefoy particularly excels as the slimy, edgy Mark Antony; David Bamber is a fine Cicero, so is Polly Walker as the scheming matron Attia. Tobias Menzies is also good as the well intentioned but politically nave Brutus, the gorgeous Kerry Condon impresses as the young, promiscuous Octavia, while Ciaran Hinds is good in his understated, dignified performance as Julius Caesar.

With the obvious exception of having the Romans speak in English (there is always something ridiculous about movies where Romans deliver obscenities in a Cockney accent) real care was taken by the filmmakers to make this series as historically accurate as possible.

The production values are considerable. Still, since they didn't have an enormous budget, the filmmakers decided not to film huge crowd scenes, concentrating instead on smaller, more intimate scenes. Thus Mark Antony's funeral oration of Caesar is referred to but not shown, and with the exception of the battle of Philippi none of the other battles of the era is recreated. Despite this smaller scope, this miniseries represents a considerable achievement, a triumph both of popular and intelligent entertainment and scholarship.

As a nice extra, the DVD features some very good information about different aspects of Ancient Rome to help us understand the series and the era more.",1325894400,,2719,5.035555555555556

2830988,5,B000Q66PXE,"Instead of going into explicit detail about the particulars of this series and plot, as I'm sure you have already read quite a number of these already, I will merely say that this series raised the bar of BOTH television and film forever.

This is not Gladiator (or Sparacus [thank goodness!]). There is plenty of action, but the real brillance of this series is the capture of conflict through mostly 'the mind and tongue.' (Again, don't get me wrong - there is plenty of action.)

The actors are superb; however, I infer this praise not only to the leading character actors on this series, but even to the very many side-characters who have limited moments on the series. Each one is excellent.

In my opinion, the casting excellence can only be compared to the likes of the Godfather I & II.
So much so that it is even worth taking a moment to reflect and stress in this review how the appreciation that such amazing actors came together and graced the same screen at the same time and truly did justice to the persona of the ancient Romans.

The show is highly 're-watchable.' I've watched this series probably 5 times since it first aired, and I am still finding new little things that I haven't noticed during prior viewings. The more you watch, the more certain characters - some who you even may not have appreciated or liked before - grow on you. Also, the more you learn about the history of that time, the more you fall for this series.

Additionally, it should be said that Rome is highly watchable for those who are NOT historically minded, nor have any background in Roman history. You will absolutely be able to follow this show and enjoy it effortlessly.

After watching this series I have read numerous works on ancient Roman history - [start with Adrian Goldsworthy's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caesar-Life-of-a-Colossus/dp/0300126891/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caesar: Life of a Colossus</a>].  Now when I watch the show, I am incredibly thrilled that this period of history is so well-depicted in character, set, and details - to a surprising degree as most may and/or would go unoticed - all for the sake of authenticity to the period.

Of course, due to time constraints and costs, there are few historical or factual liberties taken; however, I promise that in the scheme of things these are relatively very minor. The overall accuracy of the people, culture, world, and city at this time is as accurate as it could ever be.

Unfortunately, the show was canceled due to the costs; and any hope of other seasons were shattered when the expensive set burned down.
[...]

The set(s) is/are quite pricey; however, this investment is worth it for three reasons: (1) The series is excellent; (2) highly (if not infinitely) rewatchable; and (3), HBO, as always, makes their box sets with a high-level of quality.

As others have said, ""this may never be equaled."" I agree. I could not give a higher recommendation.",1325203200,,2978,4.936

At last - and it has taken quite a while too - a production from a U.S. based movie maker (HBO) which has NOT been sanitized by U.S. prudish attitudes  ...
A brilliant production in which HBO has excelled in its portrayal of ancient Rome.
Acting  - first class.
Costumes - first class.
Storyline - first class.
A production that for all intensive purposes follows historical records fairly closely.
The use of English actors and actresses was a smart move to say the least ... (somehow American accents just don't quite cut it).
The series follows the life and times of the Caesars starting with Julius and moving on to Octavian (Augustus). Then throw in the English styled sub-plot of two legionaries caught up in all the turmoil and you have the making of a great piece of viewing.
So will there be more we ask? There should be, and there are plenty of characters to follow up on.
Having read some of the earlier reviews - I'm a bit amazed that American reviewers don't think it is family entertainment - it certainly is family entertainment here in Australia. After all - we have had full frontal nudity at `prime time' since the early seventies - it is only the U.S. that feels `blood and guts' and `foul language' are ok but nudity is not. (No nudity please - we are American is the norm).
Having lived in the U.S. for some ten years or so, I've seen some amazing things in censorship such as a black woman's breasts openly shown on TV, while seconds later in the same production the white woman's breasts were scrambled. (Yes it still happens).
That to me is official `racists based' censorship - however that is not the case here in this production.
Then perhaps we should consider the source - just take a look at the Lincoln or Jefferson monument and you'll see some very Roman looking architecture, throw in a needle like Cleopatra's for George Washington just for good measure and you have it - the new empire of Rome ie:- the good ol' U.S.A. with the attitudes of the Puritans or the Vatican thrown in.
Even the military ex- service's clubs are named Legion No. ... - Rome still lives on but I digress.
HBO has gone the extra metre (yard) and produced a credible program which can be enjoyed by viewers all over the world - thank the gods for that. So watch it, enjoy it, and if you are American - watch it with your families - it's normal.

2830994,5,B000Q66PXE,"This review rates the following (in order):
Entourage
Rome
Californication
Spartacus
Weeds
Sex and the City
The Tudors
True Blood
Big Love

My wife and I have found that we enjoy these series better than watching individual movies.  I believe that we also would rank them in the same order, so this is a male/female friendly review.  As with all MoonDonkey reviews, it goes without saying that this is gospel.

I've tried to do this without including spoilers.

#1 Entourage (5 stars)
How could anything else be #1?  Entourage follows the career of movie star Vincent Chase and his group of friends.  This is the gold standard by which all other series are measured.  Plus, Entourage has the best one-liners of any series.  Unfortunately, I cannot include them in this review due to their graphic nature.

#2 Rome (5 stars)
Rome follows the exploits of two Roman soldiers - Verenus (the smarts) and Pullo (the brute).  Very well done.  For a historical drama, the sets are very well designed and believable.  In Rome, the idea is that you see the Roman Empire through the eyes of two soldiers as they experience the ups and downs of life.  My wife and I enjoyed this one a lot.

#3 Californication (5 stars)
Frankly, I wasn't sure I wanted to watch this at first.  I pegged David Duchovny as an X-Files guy and wasn't sure what to make of him in this role.  Also, I wasn't sure what Californication was about anyway.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  In Californication, we follow the life and career of author Frank Moody - a chaotic and perhaps self-destructive individual who has a way with women.  Unfortunately for him, he is trying to balance the chaos of his life on one side with his teenage daughter and her mother (his love interest) on the other side.  The dude is a train-wreck and it makes for a great series.

#4 Spartacus (4 stars)
Spartacus is about a man who is captured and made a gladiator slave in the Roman Empire.  There is just of a bit of a drop off from the 5 star series to 4 star Spartacus.  Why?  Well, there just isn't as much of Spartacus.  Basically one season followed by a ""prequel"" season.  I believe that is because the original Spartacus actor died of cancer.  I'm not sure if there are future plans for the series or not.

Also, the effects take some getting used to.  There is definitely a CGI feel to some of the scenery.  The blood effects are similar to 300.

Regardless of those issues, Spartacus was highly enjoyable.  Even my wife, who was like ""what the heck"" after the first episode, came around and really enjoyed the series.  Maybe because they show sausage.  Some of the gladiator ""locker room"" scenes are like staring at a pack of Johnsonville brats.  There is a lot of blood and nudity in this one - as there should be given that this is a brutal depiction of life as a slave gladiator.

#5 Weeds (3 stars)
Weeds gets a golf-clap 3 star ranking.  Why?  Because the plot just doesn't make sense sometimes.  There are points in this series where you feel like it is going one way and then - boom - the plot takes a 90 degree turn towards something else.  It's not like it makes sense thought.  Rather, it feels more like a different writer came in to write a different episode or something.  It is very strange and it happens a number of times.

Weeds follows the life of a suburban mom who sells pot to make money after her husband dies.  The decision to become a dealer impacts her two sons and her husband's brother - who comes to live with her.  The series starts out with sort of a realistic ""how would this play in the suburbs"" feel, but then progresses down some more eccentric paths.

We have enjoyed the series, but this is not one that we were waiting at the mailbox for the next video to arrive.  It qualifies as a ""we will watch it when we get around to it"" series.

#6 Sex and the City (3 stars)
Sex and the City explores the lives of 4 single women and their quest for happiness and men in New York.  Why 3 stars?  This is the only series that my wife and I would disagree on the ranking.  I suspect she would give it 4 stars and I would give it two.  Frankly, it is too much of a ""chic flick"" for me... and I would guess most men feel the same way.

Wait you say - what about Entourage?  Isn't that basically the same thing with a group of guys?  In a word... no.  It isn't.  For some reason, Entourage just plays better that Sex and the City.  Also, the last couple seasons of Sex and the City really fell off a cliff.  It had the distinct feeling that they were just looking to wrap it up.

Also, speaking as a guy, this series became too ""cultish"" for me.  Do you know how many women started drinking cosmos because of this series?  For that matter, do you know how many ""Rabbits"" sold because of this series?  Sex and the City became sort of a female cultural event.  Guys - that really tells you everything you need to know, doesn't it?

#7 The Tudors (3 stars)
This is a tough one.  The Tudors is a story about the life of Henry V of England and his many wives.  It is good, but I think many people just won't get into this series.  It doesn't have the craziness of Entourage or Californication, nor the blood and guts of Rome and Spartacus.  The Tudors is more of a historical drama.  Consider The Tudors a 3 star teetering on the edge of a 2 star.  I prefer Weeds to The Tudors.  However, I think my wife would maybe rank this a bit higher.

If you choose to watch this series, I strongly recommend committing to watching the first 3-4 episodes at least.  If you just watch one or two, you probably won't stick with it.

I tell you what though - one of the most interesting things about The Tudors is all of the torture.  Watching The Tudors makes any modern ""torture"" techniques look laughable.  Water-boarding?  Bah, that's for sissies!  Give me the rack!

#8 True Blood (2 stars)
True Blood is about life in a small town after vampires have come out of the closet and try to live normal lives with humans... or at least that is what it starts out to be.

Look - I'd love to rate True Blood higher, but the series just gets weirder and weirder as it goes on.  It is like the writers got bored with the standard vampire-human conflict thing so they had to take it in several other directions... and I do mean several.  Suddenly we have werewolves, witches, shape-shifters, fairies, etc, etc.  It gets to the point where you are asking yourself, really?  Really?
I'd give the first season alone 4 stars, but it drops of to 3 stars and then to 2 stars after that.

#9 Big Love (1 star)
Big Love is about a mormon family practicing polygamy.  The story follows the life of one man and his many wives.  My wife liked this a bit more than I did, but it just didn't do it for me.  There really wasn't anything about the show that I found interesting.  I think my wife enjoyed some of the relationship drama, but she stopped watching the series and hasn't expressed an interest in continuing it.  This one was a burn-out.  I think it is because Big Love is maybe too serious - if it had a Californication element to it, I bet it would have been pretty entertaining.

So there you have it my friends.  I may continue to update this list as we watch more series.  The nutshell is that HBO appears to be focusing on more high-end ""production"" type series and Showtime is focusing on lower cost dramas.",1322438400,2,7366,4.346323529411765

Having traveled to Rome twice in my life and given the opportunity to see their achievements and destruction in person makes me appreciate their history. I never had HBO, so I didn't even know this series existed until I searched ""Rome"" here on Amazon just to browse items related to Rome. When this box set came up, I searched it on Youtube to see some clips. Then I read the reviews on here and it seemed like I'd enjoy it. Well, when it arrived I began watching it right away. They did a GREAT job making these discs. First off, just the box design alone is nice. It's not cheaply made or too bulky. My favorite feature is the option for ""All Roads Lead to Rome"". While watching the episodes, if this feature is selected, small pop-up windows will appear with explanations or historical facts that are related to the scenes or dialogue you are watching. And certain words or facts are further elaborated on with an interactive selection. Once you press ENTER, when prompted to do so, it will give even greater detail on the subject.

My second disc skipped when I first tried to play it, and then it played fine after I really cleaned it off with a microfiber cloth. My third disc won't play at all in my bluray drive (HP BD240i on Win7 PC). I had a friend who could play it on a standalone player. Thus, people with more robust player hardware might not notice the playback issues. People with cheaper bluray readers may not be able to playback all discs. I actually can see a tiny surface scratch on my disc that's about the size of a hair. I have no idea how it got there but since I have never had issues playing bluray discs that came in a normal container (where the edges are held in place and you push the center to release the disc), I strongly suspect that this case design played a part.",1310947200,4,1033,4.1959798994974875
2831015,4,B000Q66PXE,"Sadly abandoned by HBO when the rising costs of the TV series cut into the production budget too much, ""Rome"" was originally envisioned to run four or five years. The first season runs at a leisurely pace compared to season two. Telling the story of the rise of Julius Caesar, the fall of the Roman Republic and the seduction of Caesar and Mark Antony by Cleopatra (although I would point out that the seduction was mutual)from the point-of-view of two common Roman soldiers Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd best known for ""Grey's Anatomy"" in the U.S.) and Titus Pollo (Ray Stevenson)as they are thrust onto center stage after serving Caesar, ""Rome"" even in its shortened two season run manages to be compelling entertainment with enough twists and turns for TWO TV series.

One of the flaws of the series was the fact that the creators had to pack so much into so little time to conclude the series. This resulted in an often fragmented second season that jumped through story often losing important elements to help explain or detail the development of the story.

The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a detailed, rich presentation that has more depth than the DVD that HBO released a couple of years back. The special features included are quite nice including a pop up trivia track that allows you to learn more about Roman society as you watch the show and then seamlessly take you back to the episode you were watching.

We get nearly three hours of extras primarily presented in standard definition including ""The Rise of Rome"", ""Ceasar's Triumph"" and ""Gladiator"" that focuses on the creation of these two key scenes from the film. ""The Rise of Octavian"" which details the rise to power of Rome's emperor as well as ""Antony and Cleopatra"" that gives us what we know from historical documents about the duo and their powerful alliance that united Egypt and Rome. There's also a very good featurette on the production of the second season of the series.

While the series became increasingly fragmented by the second season due to the shortened production schedule ""Rome"" still manages to be a fascinating drama with strong performances throughout. Personally I feel that HBO SHOULDN'T embark on long, large scale dramas because they can't be counted on to allow the series to reach its natural conclusion unless it is a popular series like ""The Sopranos"".

2831016,5,B000Q66PXE,"HBO's Rome is without doubt the best portrait of ancient Rome I have ever seen. The production is so deep and intricate that it is almost impossible to describe it. I've watched the series many times and I see something new everytime time I watch it. It is an unflinching view of Roman life, morals and beliefs which means savage violence and graphic sex, not at all suitable for kids! The series was so good that the disgraceful portrayal of the Ptolemies in general, and Cleopatra VII in particular, was a really unpleasant surprise. Cleopatra was shown as a sex obsessed drug addict of popular fiction of the male dominated literary past and not, as recent research indicates, a consumate intellectual who was the political equal of her Roman counterparts. The depiction of the Ptolemaic court is inaccurate, in stark contrast to the depiction of Rome, almost as if someone else was in charge of that part of the series!

Seems they had the budget of a regular hollywood movie, maybe that's why they could only keep the series going for two seasons?(HBO is notorious for blowing through huge budgets in no time)Its hard to pick out the greatest aspects of this series. It could be the phenomenal acting performances of the cast or the incredible set design and cinematography or the ability to delve into the life of the peasants from time to time.

2831021,5,B000Q66PXE,"The HBO / BBC TV series Rome, in two seasons, covers the behind the scenes events of the Roman Civil War. Act I brought Julius Caesar to power as dictator for life of the Republic, only to be assassinated on the senate floor. Act II is the alliance of Caesar's appointed heir, Octavian, with Caesar's former general and loyal ally, Mark Antony to defeat Pompey Maximus and the Senators. Act Three is when Mark Antony travels to his eastern half of the empire, becomes the lover of Cleopatra, and is finally defeated by Octavian and Marcus Agrippa.

The obvious comparison of this series is with the famed series, I Claudius, which played on Masterpiece Theatre. The two series meld together perfectly, since Rome ends shortly after the battle of Actium, and I, Claudius opens with the celebration, 7 years later, of the victory at Actium by Augustus (nee Octavian), his wife Olivia, his daughter and son in law, and Marcus Agrippa. I, Claudius covers a period of unprecedented peace, often called Pax Augustus. ""Rome"" covers a period of almost constant civil war.

Another big difference is that there are at least three intertwined circles where the action take place. The first is in the politics of the leaders, Caesar, Antony, Cicero, Cato, Pompey, Brutus, and Octavian. The second is between the houses of Caesar's niece, Atia of the Julii, and mother to Octavian versus Servilia, Caesar's lover, and mother of Marcus Brutus, one of Caesar's assassins. The third is in the lives of two soldiers, Lucius Vorenus, a centurion (lieutenant) and Titus Pullo, a legionnaire (private) in Caesar's elite 13th legion. These two men are actually mentioned in Caesar's books on the Gallic wars, but just barely mentioned, giving their characters a slim basis in history. Their lives weave in and out of the lives of the major players cited above. The most important connection is forged when ""retired"" legionnaire Pullo is hired by Atia to teach young Octavian how to fight. The two close friends set the scene in season one for the season two climax when they accompany Caesar to Alexandria and succeed in sneaking the ""exiled"" Cleopatra into the camp of Caesar, whereby Caesar deposes her younger brother and places her on the throne of Egypt.

What may surprise us is what is missing. This history has been covered by both the greatest playwrights (Shakespeare, ""Julius Caesar"" and ""Antony and Cleopatra"" and George Bernard Shaw's ""Caesar and Cleopatra"", plus the Hollywood extravaganzas such as Burton and Taylor's ""Cleopatra"") Thus, we immediately miss the famous oration (I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him...) which Shakespeare puts into the mouth of Mark Antony, which is credited with turning the people against the assassins. There is also virtually no large scale combat. All the great battles of the Civil war, including the spectacular naval battle at Actium (shown in the film ""Cleopatra"") all happens in the background.

The writers claim they have aimed less for historical accuracy than for ""authenticity"". I suspect they have been very successful in achieving that effect. This is not the Rome of ""Cleopatra"" or ""Gladiator"" or even ""The Robe"" and ""Ben-Hur"". This is a dirty city where the populace was always one step away from starvation if any  twist of the civil war interrupted the grain shipments from Egypt. The streets seem to be ruled by ""collegia"", which appears to our eyes as an exact replica of Mafia families, run by graft, extortion, and murder. Except that their ""product"" was not primarily drugs, gambling, and prostitution (although there was lots of that to go around). It was primarily the staples of life, grain, olive oil, wine, and pork. Sometimes these collegia worked with the government, and sometimes they didn't.
One dreadfully realistic aspect of ancient Roman politics is that political assassination was accepted as simply one of many tools for doing business. This is another way in which the ancient Roman government seems to have been run like the Corleone family in ""The Godfather"".

A big similarity between ""Rome"" and ""I, Claudius"" was the presence of slaves at every level, even at the highest. Caesar's most trusted advisor was a slave, probably Greek, named Posca. He plays a key role at several turn, yet the pamphlet of principle characters is so full, they don't even list him. This highlights one of the weaknesses in the overall structure of the series. There are so many minor and intermediate characters, it is hard to keep them all straight, especially Atia, Servilia, and their households. Oddly enough, even second ranked male characters such as Cato, Cicero, Timon, and Pompey are easier to tell apart by both dress and manner. I found that the underlying source of antagonism between the two principle women was never really brought out. One is unsure whether the primary reason is sexual or political. There may be one or two side stories, such as the fortunes of Atia's Jewish mercenary, who is urged to join his older brother to assassinate Herod the Great when he comes to court favor with the new triumvirate, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus.  Lepidus is another unfortunate loose end, but the writers are stuck with him, since he was a loose end in the actual history of the Civil War.

These may interwoven threads with their loose ends is the one area where ""Rome"" suffers most in comparison to ""I, Claudius"". Another is in the quality of the acting and directing. ""I, Claudius"" had several important, recognizable actors such as John Hurt, Sian Phillips, Patrick Stewart, John Rhys-Davies, Derek Jacobi, and Brian Blessed. Most of ""Rome"" actors are unfamiliar to us, although the four most important parts, Ciarin Hinds as Caesar, James Purefoy as Mark Antony,  Kevin McKidd as Vorenus, and Ray Stevenson as Pullo carry off their roles quite well, especially Stevenson, who may actually be familiar to American viewers for his roles in American movies such as ""The Book of Eli"" and ""King Arthur"".

In case you didn't notice the content rating, this series would easily rate an R rating if it were shown in theatres. Every episode has one or more soft core porn scenes. To be sure, sexual passions were one of the driving motivations for the characters, especially Mark Antony and the two lead women, but one does get the sense that these scenes are added as eye candy and less for their dramatic importance. One almost prefers ""I, Claudius"", with its one very short scene, and ambitions driven by power, to the testosterone drenched atmosphere of ""Rome"".

""Rome"" is very high quality entertainment. If I were to give ""I, Claudius"" an A, ""Rome"" would get a ""B+"".",1306195200,4,6637,4.943497757847534

2831028,5,B000Q66PXE,"I cannot say enough about this series.  I just came across it on HBOGO and I thought it looked interesting.  Interesting is an understatement.  It is fascinating.  So many aspects of this show are just the best I've ever seen.  Such as the scenery.  They literally recreated ancient Rome.  The costumes are excellent as well.  But the thing that puts it over the top is the acting.  Every single actor in this show is amazing.  Especially the two main actors, that play Verinus and Pullo (sp?).  And I love how the story is told through these two men's eyes.  They could have just done a straight-forward history lesson. Everyone knows the story of Ceasar. It would have been good, I'm sure, but they chose to tell it from a different perspective.  It is so interesting to see how the common people lived in that time.  All we ever hear about are the wealthy men who ran everything.  So to see it, using common soldiers, truly makes this one of the best series about ancient Rome that I've ever seen.  I actually liked this more than The Sopranos.  I know, blasphemy!  But believe me, this show is genius.",1302048000,,1105,4.522842639593908

2831035,5,B000Q66PXE,"This was a good show.  I watched it twice in a couple weeks.  Second time with the ""All Roads Lead To Rome"" feature on, which gives historical bits in relation to what's going on in the series.  Seeing it with that is a good excuse to watch it twice, though I wouldn't recommend it the first time.

And I would not have guessed Roman history could be so utterly consuming.  I kind of shied away from it for a while with bad memories of lit class Shakespeare plays I'd had to read in college in mind.  Not that those are not worth reading in their own right and I'd probably find a lot more to enjoy in those had I seen this series first.  What makes the series so strong though, is its subplots which are as engaging as the main historical events that take place.  It's as if through these subplots one comes to feel they really understand what was going on behind the scenes of the Roman history we are already somewhat familiar with.  These subplots and the characters in them really bring to full life the main events that go down.

As it's HBO, it's got all the sex and violence you'd expect from an HBO special. It's also got all the fine touches of detail and camera work that add such vibrant reality to a story making it a real work of art, one that often speaks volumes without words.

Beyond the lush cinematography, elaborate film sets and Italian location settings that make it easy to see how big the budget for this production must have been, you've got an excellent and incredible choice of actors in the cast.  There are just so many memorable and likable characters aptly realized in ""Rome"" that it is hard to choose a favorite: Pullo and Vorenus, Atia and Servilia, Julius Caesar, Marc Anthony, Cleopatra and Octavian...

What I like about the way the story is told is that the English is largely colloquial, which makes the scene and story all the more immediate, intimate and relatable. Not surprisingly though I read somewhere this show intitially didn't go down real well in Italy.  Well, the Queen's English and the cultural vibe it creates are obviously quite a bit different than the language of Italy and it's culture.  Irregardless, the BBC and HBO probably are as qualified as Shakespeare was when he first put these histories into the theatre.  The world of HBOs Rome is very convincing for what it sets out to do - tell an ancient story on somewhat modern terms - and has had me interested in all things 'ancient Rome' since seeing it.  There was talk at some point of the show going 5 seasons, but unfortunately it was condensed into just two finally due to the budget involved. A pity that, yet there is news of a big-screen sequel in the works which is supposed to pick up in Germany just 4 years after the series ended. Will be looking forward to that!  If you've liked any of the great HBO series, from Sopranos to The Wire, don't miss Rome..",1299369600,,2877,4.458015267175573

Amazon.",1298764800,3,222,4.525
2831037,5,B000Q66PXE,"We just watched this again after a long time and once again, I found myself utterly riveted not just by the wonderful (creative) historical reconstruction but for the subtlety of its view of human possibility and pathological seekers of power.  This series pleases on many levels.

On the one hand, the historical details are very fun:  it is the fundamental turning point of antiquity, when the Roman Republic - the last important proto-democratic experiment that had lasted 450 years - is rubbed out for good.  Julius Caesar, the greatest Roman military genius of them all, will not accept the political maneuverings of his personal foes, who wrap themselves in the call to preserve a republic that had long ceased to function.  Either Caesar is a villain bent on dictatorship, or they are demagogues - it is left to the viewer to decide.  Once Caesar is assassinated, another kind of political genius emerges, Octavian (later Augustus), who at the age of 19 climbs to the summit of power in Rome and then a few years later wins power as an enlightened despot/dictator.  You get to know Cato, Cicero, Marc Anthony, Brutus, Servilia, Cleopatra, and Agrippa, to name just a few of the characters who are all acted to perfection.

On the other hand, you have the psychodramas that are going on behind the scenes.  Not only does Octavian's family, shall we say, operate with literally murderous dysfunction,  but you have Vorenus and Tullo, two more common soldiers who embody different aspects of this transitional period.  Octavian's family is typical that of brutal courtier-aristocrats, as his mother Atia seeks to manipulate events to fulfill her need for love/domination and security.  But the two working class guys, who are highly fictionalized though apparently are mentioned in Caesar's histories and who witness events as they try to build healthier family lives and make their ways outside of the military apparatus, are the most interesting in my view; they provide a wonderful melodrama that reveals much about the society and its evolution.  Of course, they do get into a few too many situations to be believable (each of them kills, respectively Cicero and Marc Anthony, for example), but they are wonderful fictional vehicles to provide an alternate view from the elites as they compete for power and fulfillment.  In my view, Vorenus embodies the virtues of the old republic, while Pullo is a pragmatic survivor who is perfect for the new era.

Sure, there are lots of brutally frank depictions of sex that make this unsuitable for anyone under 16 and the violence is equally graphic.  But Rome was at that time semi-barbarous in our terms, with few possibilities to improve oneself and quick, violent ends without the possibility of the rule of law or justice.  It gets one to think about what one has, at least it did for me.

Recommended with enthusiasm.  There are so many wonderful details in this, such as the scene where Marc Anthony urinates in a plant as he is talking to Cicero or Atia covered in the blood of a sacrificed bull or her order to her son:  ""don't come home until you have penetrated someone"" [for the first time].  You will laugh, you will be moved, you will feel wonder at the panorama of history, you will desire to learn more.  Great stuff!",1298246400,,3283,4.866906474820144
2831038,5,B000Q66PXE,"This is one of the best that HBO has ever done except that it ended too early ... I want more!

2831039,5,B000Q66PXE,"This product includes eleven DVD's, many having several episodes on them of what is portrayed as a slice of life among the ruling elite starting with Caesar. Supposedly based on historic accounts I suspect it is probably as close to reality as a modern rendition can ever be, and the production itself is a class act. The actors are first rate, the video is superb, the script is flawless, and the whole thing comes packaged in a small book and slip case, with each DVD having its own sleeve within the book which also portrays images or information related to that disk. If you wish to travel back in time and see what life among the elite during the Roman Empire may have been like, then this is the product for you. This is the issue "" Rome, the complete series"" and has all of the seasons in one collection and would be of interest to anyone just wanting to see a good movie. Be prepared to see it in sequential steps since eleven DVD's is a lot of movie. As for me, this will remain in my video collection, along with I CLAUDIUS, and DAS BOOTE. As a footnote for those with children, there are some VERY GRAPHIC sexual scenes here and there so you may want to preview a disk.

2831044,5,B000Q66PXE,"I watched Rome when it first aired on the BBC in 2005 and thought it was amazing. It's been 5 years, now, and I saw it was fairly cheap on Amazon so got it for Christmas. It's only 3 days later and I've already seen most of the first series!

The thing that stands out this time around is just how good Rome was. The fall of the Roman Republic is quite possibly the most tumultuous period in Political history so the writers were always onto a winner when writing a big-budget drama. Watching the drama and violence may seem over-the-top, but practically all the major events and murders depicted here happened. In fact, if anything, despite this being one of the most violent and perverse mainstream dramas broadcast, the writers have shied away from the darker and more indulgent aspects of ancient Rome -- Mark Anthony, for instance, had several gay (as well as countless heterosexual) affairs and used to attend wild parties dressed as a god, in a chariot pulled by lions! (Anthony here, played superbly by James Purefoy, is still outrageous by modern standards, but surely the reality would have been too much to stomach for the BBC).

Where the writers succeed, though, is meshing this story onto strong, utterly-compelling character-driven plotting set within a landscape so fantastically realised that practically every shot takes your breath away. The day-to-day dirty, violent, horny reality of life in ancient cities has surely never been more accurately and beautifully portrayed. The streets of Rome are alive before your eyes, and the characters whose lives you follow through them are equally captivating (the hilarious and brutal story of unlikely friends, Centurion Lucius Vorenus and legionarie Titus Pullo; the family drama of high-society Atia and her children Ovtavia and Octavian (the future emperor Augustus); the political and military careers, the lives and loves of Anthony and Caesar; and supporting plots concerning the plotting against Caesar, the working conditions of Rome, the pagan religions and sacrifices, not to mention the careers and demises of Cato, Cicero and Brutus). As I say, the writers already had writing gold before they even put fingers to keyboard, but the effort they have put in to covering so many of Rome's facets, to also create memorising and loveable characters, has to be lauded as one of the best written dramas of our age.

Rome does have its faults (some historical inaccuracies and -- largely due to the events covered in series one being so powerful -- the second season isn't quite as strong), but there is nothing else like it (if you have been put off watching this from seeing the Tudors, give it a go, I think you will be surprised by the difference). I think I enjoyed Rome more second time around. I guess because it has been and gone and nothing has come close to matching it for sheer extravagance, debauchery and spectacle. I can't wait to watch it on Blue-Ray )

If (as I) you are interested in reading more about Caesar and Rome after viewing this, I'd recommend Rubicon: The Triumph and Tragedy of the Roman Republic (which covers the same period as season one) and Caesar: The Life of a Colossus (which is a comprehensive biography of Caesar, and covers his early life and military career in Gaul as well as events after the Rubicon).",1295308800,,3310,4.863475177304965

Rome is something you can watch with your wife and she will like the drama and the character development, while the guys will like the occasional quick nudity and violence. ROME is by no means a bad purchase. The production values are high, the story is good, the characters likable and I am enjoying it in a measured approach. There is the old backstabbing family feud, the friendship between soldiers, some of the actual history, like Ceasar and Brutus, and whatever you would expect to find in Rome.

If you like intelligent, well-acted, thought-provoking, kind-of-somewhat but not-really-accurate ""Historical Epics"", then Rome is the best series of its kind in television's history. True, ""I, Claudius"" offers a better script, but the production is light-years apart, and Rome's sheer breadth and attention to detail trump ""I, Claudius"" as the one Roman series to rule them all.

In Blu-ray, which is the only way to get everything out of this series, you will feel a true part of Rome. The acting is exceptional all around. It's not fair to single out one great actor amongst a true ensemble cast. The story is well-known to most, the ""Dawn of the Empire"". The same 25 years of Roman History that manages to miss the other 1000 years like almost every other Roman-themed series of late.

I recommend that if you do ""Rome"", do it the right way the FIRST time, or you will be spending more money later on. Nab a Blu-ray version on sale. It's worth every penny over the DVD, and the transfer and mastering are outstanding. So, suck it up and spend a couple extra bucks now. You will never make it through from Netflix or Video On Demand. Plus, a series this great will be watched multiple times. Look at it like a Gift from Jupiter.

Like any good Roman, beg, borrow, steal or kill to own this. (Just kidding about the begging part).

season two there was much more. the beginings of the mafia. war between Marc Anthony and Brutus at Phillipi in Greese. a much better season then season 1.

my only regret now is that in a couple days the whole show is over and there is no more Rome to watch.

One, Polo, doesn't quite make an ""honest"" living, while his friend Verinas is frustrated with wife and family. a very Hollywood history lesson is intertwined with the story at hand. My only wish is that they would have gone through the early stages of the Christian Church and shown Paul being beheaded and Peter being hung upside down.

You follow 2 soldiers throughout the series and how they witness history in the making.  This miniseries is never boring and you will enjoy each episode.

the character of atia --mother to octavian/augustus- was just incandescent -she reminded me of the role of livia in ""I Claudius"" -a harpy one has to love.
the arc of development for augustus was brilliant as was the eerily handsome actor who portrayed him.
augustus --by all accounts-- bided his time and struck like an asp at those who killed his adoptive father and great uncle-julius caesar-
and took the romans from backwater to empire-well played!!!-
the sets were briiliant -
direction was subtle and apt-

2831130,2,B000Q66PXE,"I recommend the Hist Channel's ""ROME: The rise and fall of an Empire"" instead of this HBO version of ""Rome"" if you are truly interested in ancient Roman history as I am. You won't find it on this HBO version of Rome.

WARNING: Don't buy this HBO set if you plan to let your children watch it.

Do NOT buy this HBO Rome video if you are interested in ancient Roman history or family movie entertainment. This HBO ROME is filled with XXX full nudity, full action sex throughout the entire video and has no historical merit.

As an alternative suggestion, the History Channel's Rome video is based on well-researched, accurate historical facts presented in a chronological order as you have often seen shown on the history channel. They also recreate ancient Rome using fully recreated period attire and locations; including a narrative filled with information and recreations of historical events. The History Channel's DVD set is very nicely done and with their usual high quality production if you are truly interested in the history of ancient Rome. It is also less expensive. You can let your children watch the History Channel's video set... But NOT this HBO version.

I just think you should know what you are buying especially if you have a family. This is full nudity, full action fornication, close-up, genuine XXX adult p0rn every 5 minutes throughout this entire HBO ROME video. It spends more time on the p0rn than they do the story of Rome. The core video is just a boring soap opera using historical names, interlaced with VERY adult video every few minutes. There is no historical value or movie entertainment value on this HBO video.

However, if you like full XXX total nudity and full action p0rn sex on the screen, then this HBO series is for you. I'm not shocked by p0rn and I've seen a few in my time, so I caution you, this HBO ROME video isn't some momentary flash of nudity nor some prudish comment. This is a full action fornication, full lewd nudity p0rn just 2 feet from the camera lens throughout the entire video series. This is no exaggeration. They have a new sex scene every 5 minutes. This is the kind of p0rn you see at the adult book stores with the infamous ""Stormy""... except this is higher quality production which has a soap opera story to go with it. In keeping with modern p0rn, the girls are all trimmed up nicely with preference to fair with plastic surgery upgrades rather than the authentic, unshaven hairy, raven haired Italian girls of ancient Rome.  So much for authenticity...

I wanted to see a historical video on Rome... and I guarantee this HBO p0rn version is not it. Even if it did not have the p0rn, it is nothing more than a slow, boring soap opera. It isn't even a good movie. It just slowly drags from one scene to the next about daily events on the road with the Roman army or political discord at the Roman Senate... interlaced with the XXX scenes.

This HBO video is presented in a soap opera style so it is not a history lesson. Basically, they created a soap opera scenario about Julius Caesar and the other historical figures of ancient Rome interacting and (literally) lathered it up with HBO sex to attract viewers and recoup the money they spent on the production. They would never have added the lewd scenes if the video itself was of any quality because they would have been concerned about losing their family audience. But the scenes with Caesar, Pompey, Brutus, Anthony, etc., are all just boring soap dialogue of events without historical or entertainment value... so the only way they could have sold this video or kept an audience interest is by catering to those who enjoy raw sex and then package it in a Roman wrapper for marketing. By using this popular ancient roman theme, HBO was also able to fool those of us looking for historical videos about Rome who had no idea it was just a p0rn video in a Roman wrapper. We bought it, now we are stuck with it.

When you see all of these rave reviews from other reviewers, consider their ages and gender and what they really liked about this video. I'm sure a lot of these reviewers are young males under 25... and who knows how young some of these commenters are? But there is no doubt this video series will really be a big hit with males of any age and a few females who are into this type of video. Just consider the source of those reviews.

As for the kids, I'm sure this was better than national geographic photos for the kids to learn about sex while their parents think they are watching something educational. Pay attention to what your kids are watching! Frankly, I don't know how the stores are getting away with selling this on family video shelves at best-buy and on Amaz0n with no cautions or age requirements about this p0rn content.

When I first read the reviews (before I watched the video), I thought it was probably just a few nude scenes and people were overreacting. As I said, I'm not easily shocked and I was interested in a quality historical video about ancient Rome. So with the rave reviews about the quality of this video, I figured a few nude scenes wouldn't be a big deal... but that is not the case with this video. Those reviewers warning of p0rn were NOT exaggerating! If anything they were understating it. It is as bad as they describe and worse! This is a p0rn video which includes a soap opera using the names of ancient Roman figures. There is no historical merit to this video. It is nothing more than a p0rn soap opera using ancient Rome as the wrapper. While they've used some historical events as backdrop, the dialogue and scenes are just soap opera interpretations of how someone in the p0rn industry might interpret daily ancient Roman life.

These reviews remind me of those old comments the guys used to make about reading PB magazine for the articles... (and claimed they didn't look at the centerfold). I don't know who they were trying to convince other than to justify why they bought it. It is the same with this HBO set of videos. Don't let someone convince you this video is authentic roman history. It is just an excuse your significant other is using to get you to watch it with them. There is no historical value in this video. It is not about the history of Rome. This is a XXX p0rnographic soap opera with genuine, full action, prolonged full nudity, active, close up, fully exposed sexual fornication on the screen throughout the entire video. This is not just one or two nude scenes. It is the core focus of the entire video.

Quite frankly, I'm astonished the stores were selling this for anyone to buy. This must be quite the coupe for those seeking X rated videos in dry areas of the country where there are no adult video stores like the bible belt. Kids can go in and buy it. I didn't see anything stopping minors from purchasing this set other than the price. I can only imagine how many parents have made the mistake of buying this for their family. I wonder how many know what they really bought?

I am, however, grateful that I had also bought the history channel's ""Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire"" while I was at best-buy. I bought it at the same time I bought this HBO p0rn version of ""Rome"". I'm glad I had the other to watch when I found out just how bad this HBO video on Rome turned out to be. I'll save this one with the p0rn collection for that purpose, should the interest occur... because this HBO video is worthless for historical value or even movie entertainment. This is the very reason I cancelled my subscription to HBO years ago. They had turned into nothing but a lowbrow p0rn soap channel because that was all they were producing. They weren't even showing good movies anymore.

This production shows that HBO hasn't improved on anything except the amount of money they have to spend on their productions... but even with the higher priced production... it is still belongs in the 86 round file based on total lack of value as entertainment and certainly of no educational value whatsoever. But if you are looking for XXX videos, this would be a better quality production than you could find in the adult video stores. So if you are looking for that kind of video... then this would be at the higher end of adult sex entertainment.",1270339200,7,8250,4.549865229110512

It comes off well viewed on a Touch, but I don't have tons of storage available, so when the complete series became available on DVD--and on sale--I jumped at buying it. All told, I've watched the series at least four times now, and my husband has seen it twice. I'm sure we will watch it many more times in the future.

I love the way the series makes this point in history come alive for the viewer. The production staff went all out to make sets and costumes that were realistic for their time, and there are many little things that the casual viewer might not notice. For instance, most modern audiences are unaware that the stirrup was not available to riders of classical antiquity, so they had to be really good! The series was particularly well cast, too, especially Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson. The additional footage on the production is well worth watching too. One thing I should mention though is that I rather dropped my jaw during the first episode, because I was not prepared for the nudity and sex as portrayed. I would not call it gratuitous, however, because it helped illustrate one of the basic premises of the series: that the Romans, as much as they were like us, were very different in many ways.

2831154,5,B000Q66PXE,"I first bought this version of the series a week before Christmas 2009.  It was an incredible price of $43.00 which I thought was stellar.  It contained both seasons for the price on just one (at your local wal-mart or best buy).  With the holiday free shipping thrown in I had to grab it.  I instantly returned my individual copies (unopened) to the store and saved over $50.00!  Well.. I was even more surprised when this collection arrived and I unboxed it.  I've been an avid collector of DVD's and series, with over 500 DVD's, 100 Blu-Rays, and 30 complete series.  I've never seen such quality put into a DVD holder.  I was expecting to get a cheap box with two seasons of discs crammed into skinny holder like you usually get when you order a ""the complete season of"" at a ludicrously low price.  My surprise made Christmas all the better.

I've watched the complete season minus the last episode of season two (which i don't think was ever even aired?).  Anyways I immediately began watching the series all over again on the DVD's.  I did not encounter a single problem with sound or picture.  I found the experience to be just wonderful.  Two months later I have now watched the whole series twice over with my new DVD collection.  The box still stands in the same condition that I got it in with no signs of wear starting to show.  I anticipate with proper care this casing will never break down on you like standard series boxes tend to do.

For those people wanting a review on the series and not on the casing or the DVD quality.  I'll throw a brief summary up.

The series focuses around the period of 60 BC to 29 BC, with the first season following the accounts of Julius Caesar and his triumph of Rome.  Followed by his assassination at the end of the first season, the second picks up with his legally declared adopted son Octavian Caesar (later known as Augustus) taking up leadership.  It proceeds to depict the problems between Mark Antony and Octavian as they fight for political power.  Leading up until 30 BC when Mark Antony takes his own life along with Cleopatra after the split of the second triumvirate.  Octavian is now still a young man with all of Rome at his fingertips and no opposers left to challenge him.

I rate the series at a remarkable 5 stars overall.  However I would have to say I would have loved to see the series run longer than two seasons.  Where the first season does a magnificent job to follow along in a slow and progressive story.  The second season is very rushed often jumping years to a decade per episode.  Don't get me wrong, it is all very well done and some how they pulled a bold move like that off.  But I would've loved to had seen it stretched out over a possible third or fourth season.  In any event, perhaps it was for the best.  This way they never had the chance to ruin it like they tend to do when trying to make shows appealing to all audiences over the course of several seasons.  Be prepared for a very breathtaking and heart warming adventure with an incredibly climactic and sad conclusion.  But alas, that is Rome.",1265241600,3,3091,4.443060498220641

2831157,5,B000Q66PXE,"What ""Rosencrantz and Gildenstern Are Dead"" was to ""Hamlet,"" ""Rome"" is to ""Julius Caesar.""  This series is an imaginative retelling of the rise of Julius Caesar and his successor, Octavian.  Arguably, this novelization of the period stretches the truth a bit, but the depiction of the overall atmosphere of the age and the life of the 'average' Roman, make this an immensely entertaining piece.  The series weaves the stories of the Ruling Class and ""Joe-6-chalice"" from the end of the Gaelic Wars until the defeat of Marc Anthony at the hands of Octavian in a breathlessly new and earthy series of adventures that is far from the usual Hollywood Blood and Sands, and avoids the usual Romans are really upper class British Empire stereotypes.  The cast is unusually exceptional and the tale is very well told.  At the end, you will bemoan the brevity of only 24 episodes.

A word about this particular release.  I had the good fortune to see the original broadcasts and the first DVD release.  Seeing it in high definition blue ray is stunning.  One can clearly see the richness and careful composition of the cinematographer.  It is a vastly improved experience!  I enjoyed the special documentation and especially valued the ""All Roads Lead to Rome"" feature, which would periodically during the viewing add in some interesting historical reference.

2831159,2,B000Q66PXE,"I had not seen any parts of the series when I ordered it, and the reviews are generally positive, albeit mixed, so I was curious about the project. The first season starts out with an adventure of the two fictional indestructible, fairly flat supermacho heroes, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, who pretty much hold center stage through the whole series. Historical events and characters are all too often overshadowed or supplanted by the fictional characters and their intrigues and (mis)deeds, in particular the two scheming and multi-layered superwomen Atia and Servilia. Needless to say, historical license abounds from beginning to end. Historical characters (Julius Caesar, Augustus, Cicero, Pompeius, Brutus, Cassius et al.) occasionally show some profile, sporadically even a bit of depth, but are by far not explored in their full potential. After all, Roman historiography has a wealth of source texts that could have been studied to provide deeper insight into these characters, their motivations and the impact of their actions and omissions on Roman history. We do get insights into the lives of the impoverished, but much of the focus is on the criminal underworld. Scriptwriting is very uneven and ranges from fair to abominable. The formulaic ingredients of copious (often brutal) sex and violence, blood and gore, suspense and soap are strategically placed and can become annoying or at least tedious.  Battle scenes are mostly abbreviated or filmically alluded to, perhaps for the better. But the fates of the thousands of unknown soldiers and bystanders who died for the greed and power hunger of their rulers are pretty much left in the dark. I had high hopes that the second season, produced by HBO in association with BBC, might show at least some aspirations to historical accuracy (not to mention good taste), but on the average it turns out to be of lesser quality than the first. Cleopatra is shown as a mindless, drug-addicted slut, her entourage, including the debauched Marcus Antonius, as a grotesque menagerie of creepy beings: all this can hardly reflect a small degree of historical accuracy. - The filmic realization (setting, props, locale, action, makeup, costumes etc.) appears to strive for some kind of Hollywood ""neo-realism"", distinctly (and thankfully) different from the sanitized creakers of yore  la ""Cleopatra"" (1963) and such, but somehow not quite credible in terms of a convincing realization of what might have been. The viewer is constantly aware that this is not the real ancient Rome, as it emerges from the historical texts, but a fantasy place created by and visualized through the lens of present-day filmmakers. All in all, this is at times entertaining, at times suspenseful and at times annoying fare which would have greatly benefited from a good team of scriptwriters, capable historical advisors and a much stronger accent on the representation of the ""grand"" historical narrative. As it stands, one is not too surprised that the project folded after two seasons, probably due to a lack of appeal to both the more sophisticated and the more basic audiences: there is not that much middle ground between these groups. In good conscience, I can not give it more than two stars.",1264636800,12,3237,5.163809523809523

2831169,4,B000Q66PXE,"HBO seems to have a golden touch. The majority of their shows are brilliantly done. Rome is no exception. It is, without a doubt, one of their finest shows produced to date. It's a shame production values brought the show to a halt after only two seasons, but a one million per episode is a tad outrageous.

This box-set is a great one. The quality put into the design of the packaging is great, it shows some genuine creativity and is nicely compact. The packaging is also where my one and only complaint about this set lays. The way the discs lay inside the casing down right sucks. They aren't held on nubs like regular packaging, rather in a 50/50 open-closed cardboard slot. By that I mean there is a full circle space for the blu-ray to sit in and half of the top is covered, so there is half of the top of the disc exposed. There is a small slit cut-out on each circle for you to get a finger underneath and pull the disc out. It's a real struggle to get the discs out of there the first few times because it's very form fitting and you have to pull fairly hard to get them out. This causes other problems too, as I was pulling out the last disc of season two a piece of the cardboard ring holding the disc in-place got ripped and when I pulled the disc out a piece sticking up scratched my brand-new disc. Qualms aside, this package offers quite it's fair share of quality. The whole season, a dozen subtitle languages, half a dozen dubbed languages, commentary on every episode. The picture quality is good for blu-ray, that will also depend on your home theatre, but all in all I found it to be just good. Not outstanding.",1263081600,3,1632,4.315960912052117

Turning them off is only temporary as they come back on after another 5 or 10 minutes.  I'm curious if anyone else has had this problem with this series.

Rome is as excellent as most people say.

The series gives a very good feeling for the historical time period, morality, ethics, and customs of the Roman people. The way the series is filmed makes you feel as if you are on the streets and in the homes of the people, like you know them.

This is nothing like Shakespeare play nor is it a watered down or glorification of these people.  This is probably as true to the period of time as one can get in a film.

Some may be bothered by the violence, language and sex - of which there is plenty - but from what I understand - these things were as prevalent then as portrayed in the series.  Its a bit disarming at first. But once you are used to it - it makes perfect sense. Parents - beware of letting your kids watch this by themselves.

It is very engrossing to watch how the Romans dealt with the classes, honor, religion, politics, economy, war, love, death, money, family and friendships.

The disk set has an added bonus of being able to select an on screen display that puts the scenes in historical context - explaining the Roman clothing, holidays, employment, relationships, buildings furniture, art, battles, etc. as the story progresses.  I recommend watching the series with this feature on. This means you will be highly entertained - taking in the plots, sub plots and relationships as well as getting a full fledged education on this period of history.  You will come away with a rich memory of a beautiful series as well as becoming a historical maven on this period of time.  You will be a better person for it.

The photography, writing, dialogue, directing, editing, art direction, costumes, music and sets are just prefect.

I must commend every single actor in this series - every performance is nuanced and real. There is not one weak actor in the entire cast and some are exceptional.

I must commend the producers and HBO for taking this gamble with their money! -  And not skimping on - but hiring such a top crew and creating those marvelous sets and costumes to create a memorable, daring, and very expensive looking series.  Thank you.

I have finally completed this series and stand by my original review - except for one thing - the writers or director but probably the marketing people decided at about half way through the series to add the F word into the dialogue - allot!. This was inappropriate that the characters would be using this word - especially the upscale characters. Every time the actors used this word it jolts you out of the Roman time period and atmosphere and brought you to the present - horrible mistake -very costly and disappointing. Marketing people can be morons sometimes. I often felt bad for these great actors for being forced into peppering otherwise fine dialogue with this word - and I'm not prude! - I use the F word myself on occasion - it just did fit in with the time period, atmosphere, characters and damaged an otherwise great series.  Sorry guys I had originally given the series 5 - Now gets 4 stars do to blatant dialogue sabotage by ignorant marketing people.",1262822400,10,3363,4.573333333333333
2831184,4,B000Q66PXE,"I've been watching the regular dvd release of Rome for about 3 months now.  The first time I saw it I was blown away by the art direction (magnificent sets by Joseph Bennett), the wonderful musical score by Jeff Beal and April Ferry's gorgeous costumes which won many awards.  I was also impressed by the courage of a mostly fine cast of actors who are asked in some cases to bare it all and behave in a very uninhibited manner.  There is a great deal of nudity, sex, torture, murder, opium smoking, battling armies and gang warfare.  There is also a great deal of high humor which balances out the shocking bits.  The humorous parts are also the best parts of the scripts which vary in quality depending on who the screenwriter is for the episodes.  Bruno Heller, executive producer, wrote most of the 22 episodes but is replaced by others (other producers in most cases) whose abilities with writing dialogue range from pretty good to pretty awful.

The basic story arc over the 2 seasons is good but could have been much better.  The series is hobbled by one satellite story revolving around the personal life of the Jew, Timon, Atia of the Julii's household henchman who protects her property, and is also having sex with her when she allows.  The sequences involving Timon's personal family life are very boring and superfluous and add nothing to the story.  The point of the Timon side plot is apparently that his brother, Levi, has come to Rome from Palestine to kill King Herod who comes to visit and bribe Mark Antony.  That story line fizzles out in the end making the whole Timon thing a waste of time.

Taking up time and celluloid to focus on this was detrimental to the overall quality of the series.
For instance:  it might have been possible to include several characters who existed in history and were unceremoniously dumped from this series, like Brutus's wife, Portia, and Octavian Caesar's first wife before he married Livia who became the first Empress of Rome.

There are other less obvious flaws mostly resulting from the soap-opera nature of some of the episodes.  Even the finest actors in the cast are tripped up by a quantity of fatuous dialogue, especially the overly sentimental Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson).  He's a fine actor, handsome, rugged, an ur-macho hunk of a scruffy bear, but his character devolves from being a brutal life-long legionnaire in the 13th legion to a blabber-mouthed, mawkish know-it-all who becomes particularly annoying in the 2nd season.

Pullo's superior officer in the 13th is Lucius Vorenus, played with a wooden, cross-eyed peevishness by Kevin McKidd.  He's not much of an actor but he looks fabulous drenched in blood and he's got a penetrating glare that would stop a werewolf in his tracks.  McKidd is much more suited to his role as a doctor in the mundane Grey's Anatomy.

The other lead actors are much better.  Polly Walker (Atia of the Julii) is the powerful matron star of the show.  It took several viewings for me to appreciate the depth of her performance.  She's not simply a horny dragon trying to control everything around her by hook or by crook but is a force to be reckoned with in the history of Roman politics, at least as her character is portrayed here.  Walker is asked to do some very outrageous things in the course of the series.  She is one of the actors who has to bare it all and behave in a most uninhibited manner before the camera.  The other great leading performance comes from Ciarn Hinds (Julius Caesar).  His murder scene is powerful and moving and he doesn't utter a word.  He has an amazing array of facial expressions and is a very subtle actor... fascinating stuff.

I have mixed reactions to James Purefoy's Mark Antony.  Perhaps he suffered more than the rest from the concept of his character by the production team.  Purefoy is surprisingly excellent playing the vulgar, brutal, egomaniacal, testosterone poisoned general.  He too must bare all which he does without self-consciousness.  I got a little tired of his inarticulate noises made during sex and domestic arguments.  Why do English actors have to pant for 30 seconds, like they've just sprinted a mile, after they've had a sexual climax?  The English male has a reputation for being less than ardent in the sack so perhaps this accounts for their inability to strike an authentic chord when they are doing sex scenes in movies.  Simon Woods (the older Octavian) is just as bad.  He acts like he's having his toenails pulled out post-coitus.

Max Pirkis (Master and Commander) plays Octavian as a younger boy who is, unfortunately, replaced by Simon Woods in the last 8 episodes when he becomes Consul and First Citizen of Rome.  This is too bad because Pirkis is 10 times the actor Woods is.  In fact wood is the operative word to describe Woods's performance.  Whereas Pirkis acts with the flair and confidence of a John Gielgud, Woods comes off as a reptilian automaton.  Perhaps he was directed to be like this; whatever the cause his performance is a failure but not as bad as the actors he is surrounded with in the 2nd season.

Octavian Caesar's General, Agrippa, is a priggish drip as performed by Allen Leech, and his speech writer and chief of staff, Maecenas, is bitchily performed by Alex Wyndham.  I've renamed these three puppies the Post, the Prig and the Prick.  Octavian's (2nd) wife Livia is played as a slutty airhead by Alice Henley.  All four of these pivotal characters are failures.  Clearly they were cast in this way so as to give the 20-somethings characters they can relate to, as most of the rest of the leads in the series are middle-aged.  It was a mistake to dumb-down these people.

You will have to look for enjoyment in the acting of many of the smaller parts.  Lydia Biondi (Merulla) is Atia's body slave and communicates so vividly with her facial expressions as to act the more talkative characters under the table.  And there are two classic performances from two ancient actors, John Boswell as the Curiel Magistrate and Helen Stirling as the old weaver on the Aventine hill.  There is an especially hilarious performance from Camilla Rutherford as Jocasta, the friend of Octavia of the Julii (Octavian's sister).  I think Kerry Condon was cast as Octavia because she looks like Max Pirkis.  Her acting isn't much but she's lovely to look at; mostly she cries a lot and has a small repertoire of facial expressions that are effective if of limited histrionic usefulness.

Lyndsey Marshal is sensational as Cleopatra.  Highly unusual and fascinating.  It is a pity more time wasn't spent in Alexandria instead of in Timon's house.  Cleopatra's son by Titus Pullo (according to this script) who is supposed to be Julius Caesar's, is played with great skill and with an engaging arrogance by Max Baldry, a stand out among the smaller parts and as competent a young actor as Max Pirkis.  And the young, pudgy lad whose name escapes me who plays the child King Ptolomy  XIII is a scream.

Lindsay Duncan's Servilia of the Junii is unusually annoying.  Servilia is one of the awful bitches in the history of the Western world and in that sense Duncan is quite effective.  She causes her son Brutus, played as an effete fop by Tobias Menzies, to throw himself on the sword, as it were, of the family honor as the founders of the Republic, and die simply so that she can have her female revenge on Julius Caesar who dumped her after his wife, Calpurnia (in a brilliant performance by Haydn Gwynne) finds out about their long-time love affair.  Duncan is one of those English actresses who rubs one up the wrong way with her precious accent and empty-headed attempts at depth.  Again, this may be largely the producer's fault.  I suppose her performance must be counted a success because she inspires so much bile in the viewer, but I find myself fast-forwarding through some of her scenes now.

There is much scenery chewing and over-acting from David Bamber, a notably cowardly and two-faced Cicero, and Simon Callow in a cameo role doing his usual bumbling schtick as a senator.  I did like Peter Eyre's star cameo as the prosecuting lawyer in Titus Pullo's trial for murder.  But most of the appearances of  recognizable (by U.S. audiences) U.K. television actors in small parts fall flat.

There are also many fine comparatively unknown secondary actors, too many to list, but they keep this leviathan of a story afloat when it might have sunk under the weight of the questionable production choices and miscasting already mentioned.  I can't end without mentioning too horrible performances from too horrible actors; one Duro, the slave/poisoner and King Herod.  They had to have been part of a package deal by the casting agency.
At least there is some satisfaction in watching Duro being tortured, stabbed a dozen times and then stuffed down a sewer hole.

Rome could have been a five star event if more care had been taken in the sub-plots and casting of a few crucial characters.  And the editing and continuity leave a lot to be desired as well.  The interactive features are pretty interesting, though I'd skip the audio versions of the episodes as most of them (with the notable exception of Ray Stevenson's voice-over in one of them) are vapid and annoying.  Better to turn on the 'When in Rome' feature which has boxes of information that pop up silently during the episodes and provide some fascinating background information as you go along without drowning out the dialogue as the blabbering audio versions do.  The extra special dvd that comes between the two seasons was not really worth the trouble.  It is brief and full of a lot of self-congratulatory burbling by the production team.

 Still, it is a highly recommendable dvd set and is addictive.",1262736000,4,9767,4.769505658129839

2831197,5,B000Q66PXE,"This series was the finest show ever created for television. It does the best job of recreating pre-christian Rome that could have possibly been done within the constraints of television or film. In fact, I am not the first to say that if you really want to see the impact that Christianity made on the world then watch Rome to find out what the world was like before it.  And I am saying this as someone who has read very extensively about Rome and this time period- and had five and a half years of Latin in school, which included having to translate Ceasar's Gallic Wars. So one of the things that I really liked about this series was the attempt to really show us what Roman life and politics was about.

On the other hand, because of budget constraints, the series was cut short- it properly should have lasted at least three years and instead ended after a shortened second season. The final episodes attempt to summarize what happened on the way to Octavain becoming the sole Emperor of Rome. That is why you will probably find the first season more satisfying dramatically than the second.

While the broad outlines of history are honored that this series is not totally accurate.  As an example: One of the main female characters in this series is Atia- the mother of Octavian. She is pictured as living though all of the events up until Octavian becomes Emperor of Rome. The real Atia died before Octavian reached his twentieth birthday. But this is a quibble- what Atia's character shows us is the influence of women in this period of history- Roman women were utterly powerless yet also extremely influential.  So the history is not totally accurate, but the characters go a long way towaqrds showing us the realities of the time.  That is why I think of this series as not a history but a portrait.  The great drama of the time plays out in a way that lets us see the character of the people rather than just a depiction of events.",1261872000,7,1944,4.537142857142857

2831200,5,B000Q66PXE,"If you thought drive-by shootings and gang warfare in our poor neighborhoods were restricted to our time, you should view the episodes of what happened in ""the good old days"" in the Aventine section of ancient Rome. Those street ""killings"" were elevated in vocabulary to ""assassination"" as Julius Caesar's peers stabbed him 27 times, not in that underclass neighborhood, but on the very floor of the senate.  Finally, the public has a production which shows much of what I learned in my Greek/Latin and ancient history classes.  The political infighting and international intrigues of our time have their origins in our basically Roman culture (with a Judeo-Christian undertone).  The men, women AND even the children (the elder Vorena) concoct schemes to their advantage; how else could a person survive?

I enjoyed the entire series, especially the standout buddy duo of Vorenus and Pullo (Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson).  I'm certain many of us have good friends who serve as a guide to clarity or act out behavior we are reluctant to express.  With opposite personalities of straight man/clown, sacred/profane, stoic/earthy, rigid/common sense, they provided the necessary relief to some of the sordid happenings.

Great audio quality - DTS-HD in 5.1 Master Audio.  AVC 1080p on ten 50GB Blu-rays, with consistently impressive video quality throughout.  Beautiful yet simple packaging.

Enable the 'All Roads Lead To Rome' option to experience trivia on many specific sections of each episode (it disables subtitles when turned on).  Well worth it to read details on ancient Rome and the series itself.  While artistic freedom has been added to some of the historical details for the sake of the story, the writers, directors, and producers have certainly excelled at capturing authenticity enough to at least equal some historical shows viewed on The History Channel.

Great casting and acting.  Phenomenal production values.  In the end it's truly impressive.  If I had to give it a grade, it'd earn a 90% overall.

2831231,5,B000Q66PXE,"THE SERIES

Rome wasn't built in one day, we all know that and its story can't be told over 2 seasons but this is probably the best we're going to have, audio-visually, for a long time to come. This is an interrupted, extremely ambitious and, eventually, unaffordable HBO project meant to illustrate the process though which an up and coming but flawed - expansionist, aristocrat driven, slave labor dependent - republic morphs into an equally or more so flawed, unsustainable empire. [Hmmm... lessons to learn? Anyone? Anyone?]

HBO and the producers of the show should be commended for doing everything in their power to stay as close as artistically possible to the historical record, whatever was available, of the period - and 'Rome' covers Cesar's climb to power and the period shortly thereafter, up to Octavian's triumph and transformation into 'Augustus' - the struggles, the intrigue, the atrocities - and how the events it triggered affected the aristocrats and the plebes, rich and poor, citizens, free men and slaves. The point of view and the storytelling shifts or swings between the history makers - Cesar, his family, Octavian, the aristocrats opposing Cesar - and two more or less ordinary Forrest Gump-like Roman soldiers who find themselves involved with almost everything historians wrote about those years and are also depicted during their more ordinary moments.

'Rome' is a feast to the eye, at least in the Blu-ray version that I'm watching. The colors are vibrant and the details on ornaments, wall graffiti, costumes, makeup are as accurate as they come. I would say almost the same about the sounds of Rome but we know so much less about the music of antiquity... Due to obvious budget constraints, camera angles are almost always narrow, focusing on specific buildings or people with the occasional, probably CGI-produced, panoramic shots. And no large, uber-expensive battle scenes but that's okay because the overall story is told well. I don't believe we ever see more than a few dozen humans on any scene but we should admire the director and the camera people even more for their ability to maintain our suspension of disbelief with the limited means at their disposal. Having some of the scenes shot on location - 'Rome' was made in Italy at the Cinecita studios - makes watching even more enjoyable.

THE BLU-RAY EDITION

The Blu-ray edition excels in every aspect, from packaging to the quality of the actual episodes to the Blu-ray specific extras.

The two season's 22 episodes of about one hour each are delivered on 10 discs. They come inside an amazingly beautiful book-like binding with each disc on its own 2-page presentation/display that consists of one picture on the left page and some details on each of the episodes on that specific disc on the right-side page which also holds the disc. There are additional pages that contain titles or some artwork for a total of 30, thick cardboard, full color pages. It's nice that a cloth bookmark was added to help keep track of where one may be with the viewing. The box the book slides in is color-coordinated with the book covers - dark, weathered dried-blood reddish-brown with gold lettering and accents. Simply amazing.

Each episode is presented in 1080p, 16:9 screen and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround sound for English and German as well as DTS Digital Surround 2.0 for Spanish, French, Castilian and Polish (voice over). Subtitles are available in dozens on languages.

Blu-ray specific extras include the invaluable ""All Roads Lead to Rome"" - a historian presents the historical fact as the episodes run, a 'must watch' when 'Rome' is viewed the second time around because the abundance of information would make watching it the first time too distracting. Also Blu-ray specific is 'Bloodlines', another interactive guide that shows and helps us understand the connections between the various Roman families.

In addition, 13 of the 22 episodes come with audio commentary alternative sound tracks from the cast and crew - presumably to be listened to on the third watching of the series. There are also a number of the usual 'behind the scenes' and 'how did we make this' featurettes.

MY RATING

Not surprisingly, I will rate 'Rome' as a 5-star. It's not perfect but it doesn't need to be so to earn its stars - Amazon's five stars mean 'I love it' not 'it's perfect'. And I absolutely love it. In fact, I am going through the second watching now - the one with 'All Roads Lead to Rome' turned on - and I love 'Rome' even more.

My only issue is that which earned 'Rome' its MA (mature audiences) rating. I am quite frustrated for not being able to watch 'Rome' with my kids in the same room. I know that some would call it 'butchery' but Blu-ray technology should allow for a 'cleaned', PG-13 version that kids could watch too because I can see how watching a show like this, especially with the historical interactive guide turned on, would make some curious enough to actually read more on the topic.

___________________________________________________

FAIR WARNING

Anyone considering watching 'Rome' in a 'family' setting should be aware that the show is rated TV MA and for good reason. 'Rome' attempts to accurately depict the Rome of 2000 years ago where sexual inhibitions were all but absent, most women were viewed as 'property' and slaves were numerous. You WILL see explicit sex, frontal male nudity and covering your kids eyes won't be enough - consider earplugs or frequent use of the 'mute' button because the sounds of sex are even more explicit than the images. Besides engaging in sex largely for amusement, violence was part of the Roman way of life - torture, gladiator and other arena fights, assassinations were common. Well... those were the Romans - love them or hate them.",1260403200,400,5805,4.92732855680655
2831232,5,B000Q66PXE,"Most of the reviews I have seen talk about the quality of the series ranging from the writing to the acting - all of which I feel are superb and among the best of any series ever made for TV.  I rank it right up there with Sopranos and Band of Brothers.  However, for the sake of this review I am going to focus on the Blu-Ray release.

Packaging:

I've read mostly negative reviews about the packaging, but I must state that I liked it.  It comes in a box and is ""bound"" in a booklet.  Each disc sits in a sleeve to the right of each page in the ""book"" and to the left is a photo depicting one of the characters/scenes of the series.  Each disc contains 3 episodes and the sleeves they are in show one small photo of a scene from each episode with the title of each episode.

The binding of the book also has a ribbon bookmark that can be used to mark your place so you don't forget which disc you left off on.

The book has an outer box to it which is what you see displayed on the Amazon image as the stock photo.

My only complain on the packaging is that the ""Blu-Ray"" sign that appears in the top left of the stock photo wraps around to the back of the box set and is glued onto the outer box.  It is easily removed, but it takes a couple of minutes to remove all the glue residue.

Quality:

The blu-ray transfer is superb.  It is definitely an improvement over the DVD release and is even better than the original HBO HD broadcast.  The sound is also great.  My only complaint is that the extras are only in 480p rather than the 1080p that accompanies the episodes.

Overall this is a great buy and is a must for any ""Rome"" fanatic!

The writers really created an intricate story that showed the life of Rome from the Imperial perspective to the view of the most lowly slaves. The story moves along with realism, excitement, and breath taking beauty. If you choose to watch the subtitled version, you get insight into why the characters are doing what they are doing. This adds another dimension to what you are watching that keeps it so much more interesting. If you are like me and can't get enough, you can watch it again with the director's commentary and get yet ANOTHER perspective on the acting, filming, motivation, etc. I've watched the whole series about 3 times now and followed that up with a trip to Rome, so I am obviously a big fan.

First,

ROME series is FANTASTIC, say that 5 times to yourself, there is not a better series or movie on ROME, PERIOD HBO went all out they went all out so much that it cost to much to maintain and they had to end it despite raving reviews.

Second,

BLU RAY looks FANTASTIC, worth the upgrade if you have it on DVD or the version to go with if you have none (I have both), The image is cleaner, smoother, better contrast, and looks like it was made for the world of HD

2831253,5,B000Q66PXE,"I had rented the first couple of episodes of the ""Rome"" series at the local video store and was introduced to the characters of Titus Pullo and Lucius Vorenus. I found the contrast of Titus Pullo's love of the ladies, his soldier's strength and Lucius' (a married soldier with children) more temparate personality a comedic thing to watch.  Being a fan of another HBO show, ""Deadwood"", the violence and sex and cussing was nothing shocking. People watch the shows produced by the premium channels because you can tell stories and use language that would normally be censored in regular tv. Thank goodness!

After buying both seasons and watching them over a three day period, I can say that I feel it was a worthy investment and a welcome addition to the DVD collection. The introduction to Titus Pullo and Lucius Vorenus develops as the audience meets Lucius' family, Caesar and the Senate, Mark Antony and the Women of Rome (devious Atia, gentle Octavia, devastated Servila, beautiful and fascinating Cleopatra, Vorenus' wife Niobe).  The characters are well developed and the plot is rich.  In ""Rome"" people have many secrets, secrets that they must guard with their lives, and as an audience you are pulled into the world and the time period.

Known for having an high production cost per episode, it's quickly evident why.  The sets are beautiful as are the costumes (vibrant colors, silks, togas, soldier's equiptment, etc.)

Highlights for me include the writhing, sexy, crying, pleading, devastated, powerful, plotting Cleopatra (even though she is in the last season episodes(played by Lyndsey Marshall) both Caesars (Julius Caesar played by Ciaran Hinds and Octavius Caesar played by Simon Woods) and of course, Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson) and Vorenus (Kevin McKidd). And of course Atia of the Julii, she is sneaky, snobbish, and conniving and she has no qualms about it.

Overall, a well-crafted series all around. The slang, the scenes the costumes all serve to envelope you in Rome of the time.  Each episode is a strong one!",1259539200,5,2038,5.023738872403561
2831254,5,B000Q66PXE,"Watching Rome, I was reminded of how much our society needs historical documentation to remind us how the world was once upon a time. As each generation comes into their own, they too will need reminding. And over and over and over it goes. The HBO drama Rome does that for us. Magnificent,it ended only after two seasons, rather abrubtly. It was absolutely inspiring. To have the city of Rome and culture and life as it was, re-created right before our eyes was like a gift. I loved every second, every minute of it. For historians, most of it was historically correct. There were some liberties taken, but all in all, it correctly portrayed that period of time. Kevin McKidd was excellent as Lucious Vorenus and Ray Stevenson as Titus Pullo, both Roman soldiers under Marc Anthony.

Yet, as history, the movie had its flaws (most notably that it distorted the historical record quite bit). However, I'd despaired that it would be the pinnacle of our ability to visualize Rome.

HBO also took care to portray Rome in a somewhat historically accurate fashion. HBO hired expert historians and consultants for every detail. Unlike most movies about ancient Rome, HBO did not shy away from portraying the less glamorous sides of Rome. In fact, much of the series deals with everyday citizens, from prostitutes to roving gangs. This in turn means that the series includes a lot of explicit sex and violence. While this means the series isn't appropriate for kids or the faint of heart, it does mean that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rome/dp/B0028RXXFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rome</a>&nbsp;shows Rome as it actually was.

One thing I love about this series is that it deals with the last years of the Roman Republic, one of the most compelling eras in history. Most movies and TV shows shy away from historically important events, but HBO tackles it with gusto. The show manages to remain historically accurate while using actual historical to provide the drama in the show. HBO did a great job finding actors to portray Julius Caesar, Pompey, Mark Antony, Cato, and the rest of the dramatis personae (although I wasn't as pleased with their choices for the Augustus side of the family - see below). At times, you almost feel like you traveled back in a time machine to witness these epic events. If you're interested in this period, I'd recommend Tom Holland's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rubicon-The-Last-Years-of-the-Roman-Republic/dp/1400078970/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic</a>&nbsp;for more depth on events during the period. I only wish the series had been longer rather than only two seasons - it would have great to have seen the Battle of the Teutoberg Forest in 9 AD, or the end of Augustus' reign. However, apparently the budget for the show grew so large that HBO (foolishly) decided to cancel it.

My only criticism of the show is the portrayal of Augustus and his mother, Atia (Polly Walker). Historians don't necessarily have accurate information on the personalities of these figures, and there probably isn't a ""definitive"" interpretation of their lives. Still, I thought the show took a few too many liberties. While Atia in real life was probably cunning and ambitious, Polly Walker's version of Atia makes her into a psychotic and sadistic woman. In one scene, she even has a torture room and tortures Servilla. There's no historical basis for any of that, and it does seem a bit outlandish. For his part, Augustus as played by Simon Woods seemed a bit too dull and cynical. Again, while I'm sure Augustus must have had excellent political acumen to rise so high, he was also a brilliant administrator and did have a vision for Rome. I just didn't think HBO's depiction of either character stood up well or resembled what I had read in Anthony Everitt's excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Augustus-The-Life-of-Rome-s-First-Emperor/dp/0812970586/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Augustus: The Life of Rome's First Emperor</a>.

2831257,5,B000Q66PXE,"When I was younger, I used to love watching movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spartacus/dp/0783226039/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spartacus</a>, not so much because they provided particularly great depictions of ancient Rome, but because they were the way anybody get any sense of the grandeur of the Roman empire. In fact, looking back, those films were often quite cheesy. Hollywood stopped making movies about ancient Rome for a long while, until&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator/dp/B00009ZYBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator</a>&nbsp;came out in 2000. As a movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator/dp/B00009ZYBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator</a>&nbsp;was awesome and showed a vastly more realistic yet grander Rome than ever before seen in Hollywood. Yet, as history, the movie had its flaws (most notably that it distorted the historical record quite bit). However, I'd despaired that it would be the pinnacle of our ability to visualize Rome.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that HBO did an excellent job at recreating the ancient Roman empire in its miniseries&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rome/dp/B0028RXXFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rome</a>. At first, I was suspicious, worried that Rome would become twisted by HBO, the same creators of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-the-City/dp/B0011UBDTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and the City</a>. Yet, the series is awesome. In terms of the production quality, it looks and feels like a big budget movie (indeed, the cost of the series eventually doomed it). The acting, visual effects, and soundtrack are exceptional (be sure to get Jeff Beal's soundtrack&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rome-Music-from-the-HBO-Series/dp/B000MGVBQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rome: Music from the HBO Series</a>).

HBO also took care to portray Rome in a somewhat historically accurate fashion. HBO hired expert historians and consultants for every detail. Unlike most movies about ancient Rome, HBO did not shy away from portraying the less glamorous sides of Rome. In fact, much of the series deals with everyday citizens, from prostitutes to roving gangs. This in turn means that the series includes a lot of explicit sex and violence. While this means the series isn't appropriate for kids or the faint of heart, it does mean that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rome/dp/B0028RXXFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rome</a>&nbsp;shows Rome as it actually was.

One thing I love about this series is that it deals with the last years of the Roman Republic, one of the most compelling eras in history. Most movies and TV shows shy away from historically important events, but HBO tackles it with gusto. The show manages to remain historically accurate while using actual historical to provide the drama in the show. HBO did a great job finding actors to portray Julius Caesar, Pompey, Mark Antony, Cato, and the rest of the dramatis personae (although I wasn't as pleased with their choices for the Augustus side of the family - see below). At times, you almost feel like you traveled back in a time machine to witness these epic events. If you're interested in this period, I'd recommend Tom Holland's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rubicon-The-Last-Years-of-the-Roman-Republic/dp/1400078970/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic</a>&nbsp;for more depth on events during the period. I only wish the series had been longer rather than only two seasons - it would have great to have seen the Battle of the Teutoberg Forest in 9 AD, or the end of Augustus' reign. However, apparently the budget for the show grew so large that HBO (foolishly) decided to cancel it.

My only criticism of the show is the portrayal of Augustus and his mother, Atia (Polly Walker). Historians don't necessarily have accurate information on the personalities of these figures, and there probably isn't a ""definitive"" interpretation of their lives. Still, I thought the show took a few too many liberties. While Atia in real life was probably cunning and ambitious, Polly Walker's version of Atia makes her into a psychotic and sadistic woman. In one scene, she even has a torture room and tortures Servilla. There's no historical basis for any of that, and it does seem a bit outlandish. For his part, Augustus as played by Simon Woods seemed a bit too dull and cynical. Again, while I'm sure Augustus must have had excellent political acumen to rise so high, he was also a brilliant administrator and did have a vision for Rome. I just didn't think HBO's depiction of either character stood up well or resembled what I had read in Anthony Everitt's excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Augustus-The-Life-of-Rome-s-First-Emperor/dp/0812970586/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Augustus: The Life of Rome's First Emperor</a>.

A quick note about the DVDs themselves. They are excellent quality and include hours of bonus materials, including deleted scenes and ""making of"" featurettes. I found some of the commentary about the interpretation of the characters pretty interesting. IF you or anybody you know loves ancient Roman history,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rome/dp/B0028RXXFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rome</a>&nbsp;should definitely be on your Christmas list.",1259107200,207,5702,6.5570291777188325
2831258,5,B000Q66PXE,"First off, if you do have the first two season sets of ""Rome"" on DVD already, no real reason to upgrade. The extras are all the same with no changes and the picture, if a bit sharper, is about the same too.

But if you haven't gotten this series, this is a great way to start. This is Ancient Rome the HBO way, which means amazing detail to history while mixing in contemporary language, scattered with curses, bloody violence and (this is Rome, after all), constant nudity. The story revolves around two soldiers, Vorenus (Kevin McKidd) and Pullo (Ray Stevenson) who find themselves involved in the dramatic events of Rome. From Julius Ceasar crossing the Rubicon and becoming emperor to meeting Cleopatra, Ceasar's death and the war between Octavius and Rome, the two are in the midst of it all while handling thier own personal dramas. In the first season, Vorenus has no idea his wife had a child with another man while he was at war while Pullo's hard-drinking and violent ways get him into trouble.

The acting is terrific from the two leads, McKidd cool most of the time, which makes his bursts of incredible violence more notable. Pullo is funny as a man who'd go straight through anyone in his parth and sees no trouble killing. Ciaran Hinds gives Caesar a proud air that makes you understand why people were willing to follow him while James Purefoy plays Marc Antony as an arrogant blowhard who still manages to power his way through the ruling class. The best of the cast, however, is easily Polly Walker as the deliciously wicked Atia, a woman willing to do anything (Blackmail, murder and use her body however she wants) to get ahead in Roman society.

The show is wonderfully researched, bringing the era to life like never before and showcases some nice bits of history. The language may be contemporary but the producers do try to show how it really was. Cleopatra, for instance, is attractive but short and hardly the supermodel figure so many movies portray her as while Caesar's assaination is less a careful plot and more a near-disaster. There aren't many actual battle scenes shown due to budget but the fights we get are pretty brutal and bloody like it really was and the show is great illustrating the complex political games of the time.

Season two does suffer a bit as it was midway through production the producers learned they would only get 10 episodes and no third season. Thus, the stories feel more rushed as they try to fit in as much as they can. They do a good job with the battle over Antony and Cleopatra (which is far less than the epic romance most think) and bring it to as good a conclusion as they can. Through it all, the epic bromance between the two leads pulls you in as you get sucked into their lives, through thick and thin and care for their final fates.

The extras are good as there are multiple audio commentaries and features on putting the show together, as well as recreating the time. The best bonus is ""All Roads Lead to Rome,"" a great subtitle guide that explains many of the references, historical notes and more on the time, showing the amazing research that went into it all and you see how true to life it is.

It may have been short-lived but the series remains one of HBO's best efforts ever. Brilliantly acted and wonderful in detail, the show is a must-have for any history or drama buff to see in all its wild glory.",1259020800,34,3387,4.5625

The series had no flaws. Writing, acting, sets, costumes and cinematography were all top rate. The characters are a combination of real and composite but it's probably the most historically accurate portrayal of everyday Roman life ever made. And how could you not love the character of Titus Pullo.

Roman history, while always fascinating, has always seemed cool and static in North America.  HBO, in ""Rome"", has breathed life into well documented time period.  Those who not historically minded, will merely see this as a very well produced HBO drama.  Being hstorically minded, I am thrilled that this period of history can see life.

In two seasons, viewers across North America thrilled to the power struggles within the Roman senate played out in venues from Gaul to Rome.  Caesar and his men, in battle and out, realized that the power of plebian popularity. The death of Pompeys' wife, Julia, leads to a struggle for wifery, and eventually his death.  The power play between Mark Anthony, Casesar, Vorenus, Pompey, Cato, and Brutus is fascinating.  Social standing is valued, to the extent of sacrificing personal happiness.  Integrity is merely the price of success. Ambition is the currency of Senate success.

The episodes included in the set are:

Stolen Eagle
How Titus Pullo brought down the republic
An Owl in A Thornbush
The Ram Has Touched the Wall
Egeria
Pharsalus
Utica Triumph
The Spoils
Kallends of February
Passover
Son of Hades
These Being the Words
Tortoise and the Hare
Heroes
Phillipi
Death Mask
Necessary Fiction
No God Can Stop A Hungry Man
About Your Father

Dramatically speaking, this is a stellar production with outstanding performances.  In reading about Rome, I was fascinated that full size sets were constructed for the series accurate to the period.  Full scale models of actual artifacts were used in the production, and that is ambitious.  I can imagine that once season 2 was finished, a museum is now well stocked, and even a Roman style theme park is now fully functional.

The bonus features just add more integrity to the series that was overdue, and will be missed.

I cannot say enough about this series.  It is unfortunate that more episodes were not produced, but I can imagine that the production cost was prohibitive.  Perhaps a Medici period drama might be next...

2831286,5,B000Q66PXE,"It's too bad that Rome couldn't have made it at least one more season, but the production cost was way to high, even for HBO. After The Sopranos (seasons 1-3 especially), Rome and Deadwood are tied for my second favorite series from this network, although I really enjoy True Blood and Carnivale too. The characters are all interesting and well acted, the action scenes are brutally realistic, the production design is epic and the storylines are captivating. What's not to love? I do think that the first season is better than the second, but that's not saying it's not worth five stars as well. If you liked the film Gladiator or just history in general, you will learn much more about Rome and the many colorful characters who live in it. Now if only HBO would stop getting rid of classic shows like Rome, Deadwood and Carnivale after two or three seasons.

2831287,5,B000Q66PXE,"I am absolutely ECSTATIC to see HBO's nonpareil series ""Rome"" scheduled for release on Blu-Ray!  This is one of the four essential Blu-Ray series releases that will ensure that the great unwashed public will FINALLY invest in Blu-Ray players.  We still await two of these seemingly made-for-Blu-Ray series -- we are still patiently waiting for Indiana Jones and Star Wars, but at least the Harry Potter series is being released in a timely (and most entertaining) fashion.  And Rome is the fourth.

If any of you who actually have working brains have not yet seen Rome, I suggest that you do so forthwith.  It is, to state it quite bluntly and unequivocally, the very best television show ever made by anyone throughout the entire history of the medium.  Indeed, if you use a scale of zero-to-ten, and you give Rome a ten, the second-best television show ever produced will score no better than a six.

It excels on all levels.  The part that pertains to historical events is factual and illuminating.  The parts that are historical fiction are contextually accurate and rivitingly engaging.  The characters are compelling and become your friends and foes.  The stories are thrilling, edge-of-your-seat nailbiters.  The acting is worthy of the very best of the legitimate stage.  The cinematography is rich and flawless, every scene just as you would wish your eyes to view it.  The sets are utterly exquisite, stunning, glorious.  The costumes actually serve in an active way to enhance the viewing experience.  And to add a delightful frosting to an already incredibly delicious cake, you get to see the gorgeous, voluptuous English actress Polly Walker (among others) running around naked a lot (or, for you girls and alternative lifestyle sorts, you get a good view of James Purefoy).

The only thing to criticize about this show is that it was canceled too soon.  It leaves us craving so much more.  While the wonderful PBS production of ""I, Claudius"" (the show that would have gotten the rating of six that I mentioned above) pretty much picks up where ""Rome"" left off, historically speaking, they could have gone on to do Nero into Vespasian in the same style the following year and provided just as compelling a story, and then gone on right through the rest of the Flavians, the Antonines, and the fall of the Western empire in subsequent seasons.

Vorenus and Pullo are fictional characters whose names were taken from the logs of Julius Caesar.  Through what may be the finest example of `literary licence', this staff of writers plant these soldiers in the middle of Caesar's fall.  Arguably, the most fascinating period in the history of the planet.

History novices fear not, the fictional journey of Vorenus and Pullo plays-out like a Tolken novel.  Viewers will be more concerned with the lives of these 2 friends than any of Rome's true-to-life nobility.

While I could write pages of praise for this series, it is exceptional character development and riveting acting (Kevin McKidd, Ray Stevenson) which left me aching for more.  There are rumors of a future film.

If anything, the ancient Romans were simply more honest about their basic depravity than modern humans are prone to be.  If we factor in the world wars of the 20th century, Nazi death camps, and the wholesale slaughter of tens of millions of men, women, children and babes in arms during warfare, ancient Romans might admire the refinements in cruelty which 20th and 21st century humans have achieved.

To see how we are no better than the ancient Romans were, watch Rome - The Complete First Two Seasons.

Given that no one can possibly best Shakespeare's version of Marc Antony's oration to the people on the subject of Caesar's death, this series cleverly has a plebian giving his critique of Brutus vs. Antony's speech in a very common accent, in a tavern with a bunch of brawling ex-soldiers over beer.

The production values are gorgeous, the actors do a spendid job of creating the characters, and the special features, especially All Roads Lead to Rome, are informative and add much to the experience.

Other reviewers have addressed the historical accuracy of the series so let me just say that we didn't care about the accuracy.  We did some research on a few subjects that interested us, and found that on the whole, the series was accurate.  As far as portraying the customs and mores of one of our parent civilizations, Rome did an excellent job of conveying the social and political climate that incubated Christianity.  I can't recommend it highly enough--great stories, great acting, great costuming, great sets--what more could you ask?",1229904000,,890,4.97972972972973

2831414,5,B000Q66PXE,"Even though the producers do not want to pinpoint the source of their inspiration, but I believe Ronald Syme's Roman Revolution historically analyzing this exact period was an inspirer for making suhc an awesome movie. The series are so good that one wants to watch them again and again and to relive Rome as it was depicting life of the simple citizens, freemen and slaves up to the senators, aristocrats and consuls. It is an essential feauture of the film that the life of Rome in its totality is so amazingly interpreted. The role of women was a central issue too.
Surely there are historical aberrations, but then who wants movies to depict exactly what it was then. The most impirtant thing is the atmosphere, the thinking, the philosophy of the period and I can not name any other movie or series which could rival Rome in that sense.
I only wish they continued in the same vein. Rome's existence makes me feel very happy. Great Job! Bravo to the actors, the directors and the whole team that worked on this movie from the minutest details to seeminly trivial points.

Although I was a bit skeptical about this tie-up, it worked pretty well in Rome. I ordered both Season 1 and Season 2 from Amazon, and loved every minute of both of them.
It's a crying shame that there will be no Season 3, because the viewer numbers were not good enough. Everyone wants reality tv these days, it seems....humph!
My only real criticism of the shows, and it's more a question-mark than a criticism, is how did on earth did they get so many cockney accents in Rome at the turn of the millenium? Not only accents, but the slang used was very London Docks.
I have read other criticisms that have pointed out that none of the major battle scenes were enacted, and although it wouldn't have been a bad thing to have included these, I think the show was more about the people than the historical battles that took place.

The show was shot in Rome and used Roman extras, and this added a sense of realism to it. If you are bothered by full frontal nudity, you may not like it, as there is a lot of sex.

I do confess I have a crush on Kevin McKidd who plays Vorenus. And his character is a man of great honor and a firm believer in standing by his friends. The actor is now a regular on Grey's Anatomy if, like me, you get attached to him.

Rome captures the world of Rome in detail, from the music, to the graffitti on the walls, the town crier, the orgies, the parades, the gladiator pit, the calender, life at the family dinner table, the slaves,  the religious rites, the street gangs, homosexuals, the Jews, Egyptians, the barbarian tribes, the military camps, the theatre, the brothels, the opium dens, and the senate.  Rome's focus on the women of the age elevate it beyond all of the other films about Rome, even ""Spartacus"" and  Marlon Brando's great version of ""Julius Caesar"", and breaks new ground.  Like many, my only complaint is that the story ends, when in reality, the Roman Empire lasted 10,000 years, and there is much more of the story to be told.

2831448,5,B000Q66PXE,"I'm trying this one again.  I'm not sure why certain Amazon reviews don't seem to make it into print but this is one that didn't.  In any event and in my humble opinion, ""Rome"" is one of the best things ever put on television.  Because I chanced on an HBO episode, I subscribed to HBO.  Now that HBO has cancelled this wonderful series after only two seasons, I will cancel my subscription to HBO.

The series takes us through some of the most climactic events of the Roman Empire i.e. the ascension of Julius Caesar, his corruption of the Republic, his assasination and the events up until Octavian's consolidation of power.  The story, in its own way, is an 'upstairs, downstairs' kind of thing.  We watch the aristocrats in their battles for power and status.  At the same time we see lesser figures engaged in parallel power struggles.

Rome is, at the same time, a society familiar and alien to us.  Motives of love and wealth are similar but Roman society, at all levels, is a complex of Mafia families vying for power.  If you and your family win, there is a chance of securing the wealth of the world.  Lose and you die, probably horribly.

Slavery is as common and unquestioned as is the brutality that accompanies almost everything.  There is one fascinating scene in which the 'heroine' is having passionate sex with Marc Antony.  She asks her elderly slave...who is watching patiently in the corner...for a glass of water.  The slave, without changing expression, complies as the sex continues.  Death is commonplace and life cheap.  One soldier, ordered to murder Cicero, comments after the act what a pleasant and decent man Cicero was.

This video is great.  Yes, there is soft core porn and violence but at least it isn't gratuitous.  It adds to the genuine strangeness of the tale.

2831450,4,B000Q66PXE,"The first season is wonderful. Compared to other television shows, The First Season of Rome is very refreshing. Yes, there is gratuitous violence and sex, but it doesn't distract from the show and the content. In my opinion, these elements actually go a long way to depicting the brutality of the times. The characters are wonderfully crafted, especially Atia, Caesar, Lucius Vorenus, and Titus Pullo.

Another reviewer complained that they have annoying British accents which ""do not fit because they are supposed to be Romans"". I think the British accents work well, especially considering nobody speaks Latin anymore, and not too many people of the target audience speak Italian either. And I doubt any other English speaking accent would have been any better (could you imagine Australian? Or American? Or Irish? HAHA)

The Second Season of Rome is why I gave it only four stars. Something about it just wasn't as good as the first season. I am not able to quite put my finger on it, perhaps it was the death of Caesar (which had to happen, no doubt) or maybe it was the newer and older Octavian who I just could not come to enjoy watching (no matter how hard I tried).

Overall, it is still a great show. I personally think it should have ended after the first season. I gave it four stars because of the second season, even though it is still worth watching.",1218412800,,1364,4.698744769874477

2831485,5,B000Q66PXE,"Just finished viewing both seasons of Rome in late June 2008. Personally I think both seasons are excellent. This is very good entertainment and should be enjoyed accordingly. Is it historically correct, no. But who cares, this is HBO, not the History Channel. Season 1 introduces most of the characters and focus on the strugle of Roman life. As in most cases the rich are the most interting. There continues be a struggle between two families and their interests. One backs the Ceasar, the other the Senate. This theme runs throghout the entire series. What makes it interesting is there are 3-4 subplots going on at the same time. This shows the common man strugles, the soldiers,the shop keepers,and general life in and around Rome.

Some of the battle scenes are the best and interesting to watch Roman superiority. Well organized, with a will to fight to the death. The characters are always interesting and each eposide moves to hold the viewers interest.

I would caution you about the nudity and language, as it may be undesirable or offensive. Certainly this is adult entertainment with lots of violence and blood. However for me this is one of the better projects HBO has produced.

This series has been far better than anything produced by Hollywood to watch this summer. Believe me, I am a big movie fan. No one film in the last 6 months comes close to entertaining you like Rome.

Then they either take a really long time to air new seasons (as in The Sopranos) or cancel it after only 2 or 3 seasons when we are really hooked (as in they did with Carnivale, Deadwood and now Rome).  I always thought that the really great thing about premium cable channels was not the movies, but in their ability bring us daring shows that we would not have seen otherwise.  Here HBO sets the standard.  Lately though they seem to lose their nerve too quickly and cancel great programs way too early.

Here's where they went wrong with Rome. An executive at HBO said, ""The Sopranos is a great show, what makes it a great show?"" The answer of course is irresistible characters and an intriguing storyline, but being the masters of insight into film making that television executives often aren't, they decided the answer was, ""violence, sex and curse words,"" as if the audience is a bunch of thirteen year olds. And the show really offers little more than just that, violence, sex and curse words, and nothing in the way of a three dimensional character or an interesting plot. Just for some added spice, all of the Romans speak their English with a British accent, giving the whole thing a cheesiness level rivaled by Geico commercials.

Give it a try if you like, but when you get to the ""battle scene"" in the first season that they've been building up to for the first six or seven episodes, I can guarantee disappointment.",1213660800,23,1176,4.676328502415459
2831514,4,B000Q66PXE,"The ingredients do not necessarily suggest a successful TV-series. There's extreme, relentless, at times mind numbing violence, graphically depicted; barely a single sympathetic character is in sight; there is not the slightest hint of anything humoristic (well, except for Ian McNeices delicious newsreader); and as always actual historical fact is twisted and turned into something that may be suitable for entertainment purposes but rather (over)stretches credulity at times - one wonders why, because it's not as if these people actually were a dull bunch leading uneventful lives. Yet ""Rome"" is strangely haunting and compelling. Often it does a good job of transporting the viewer to a world unencumbered by Christian sensitivities, particularly in its love of bloodsports, its dealings with slaves, and its relaxed attitude to sex and public nudity. Full frontal male nudity is not eschewed, still the final frontier in film-making. Also, and more importantly, ""Rome"" conveys the constant sense of tension, intrigue and threat dominating the lives of those in power. Finally, a fairly good job was done of giving a realistic impression of the city itself in those final decades before the birth of Christ. It is, however, weird and rather silly that the characters speak English but throw in occasional Latin. The perfect, smudge-free make-up and excellent teeth also make you wonder (Suetonius describes Octavian's teeth as ""few, small and decayed"").
Typically, many of the main dramatic historical events are not shown, but only told in flashback. For instance, we do not witness Mark Antony's finest hour, his eulogy at Caesar's funeral, that swayed Roman public opinion against the assassins. Several decisive battles, including that of Actium, are also conveniently skipped.

The story is told from the vantage point of two soldiers, one eventually rising through the ranks, the other only finding a settled existence towards the end. Both are, though in name only, based on historical characters. Gruff and dutiful Lucius Vorenus is haunted by personal tragedy. He struggles with his role as a father and his allegiance to a loosing party, that of Mark Antony; struggles that at one point will land him as the leader of a band of hired assassins. His unlikely friend Titus Pullo leads an aimless existence that never manages to be carefree and that only gains some focus whenever some fighting is to be done. The plot has been constructed around the far-out premise that the whole birth of the Roman Empire pivoted on the actions of these two men, rather than those of Julius Caesar and his ilk. The idea has been woven into the story so tightly and cleverly that it is surprisingly easy to suspend disbelief.

The first season is the more consistent and compelling of the two, dealing with the battle between Julius Caesar and Magnus Pompey. The strife between the families of Caesar and Brutus is exemplified by their two matrons Atia and Servilia, both in their way as vicious and devious a schemer as you're ever likely to see. The development of the relationship between Vorenus and Niobe is believable and quite touching.
The second season then depicts the power struggle between Mark Antony and Gaius Octavian, and introduces the exotic element of Egypt, where Cleopatra's court appears to be some kind of whorehouse and the Queen herself a scantily dressed upmarket prostitute. Halfway through this season the story start to get ragged, and some plotlines hang by a precariously thin thread (the way Vorenus discovers his daughter's betrayal is like something out of an uninspired Miss Marple episode). A Jewish subplot is randomly tacked on and feels like a cumbersome invention to burden the story with irrelevant premonitions of Christ. Furthermore, it doesn't help that a substantial number of  the more interesting characters, notably Cicero, Servilia and Brutus, are killed off. The ""Xena, Warrior Princess""- act of Gaia in the battle of the Collegia is probably the low point of the series. Fortunately, things are pulled together for the final episodes, where the story is satisfyingly wrapped up and the viewer is indeed left, in Octavian's words, with the sense of having travelled a long road.

History buffs will find ample cause to be annoyed nonetheless. Many events are fabricated, characters are missing (where are Octavia's husband Claudius Marcellus, Atia's husband Lucius Phillippus and Marc Anthony's wife Fulvia?), people weren't really in the places where we see them at the moment we see them there (Caesar wasn't killed in the Senate, Cicero wasn't killed at home), and several details of costume and ritual are anachronistic or invented. Alexandria is shown as some rustic backwater rather than the dazzling metropolis it was.
Characters are sometimes almost insultingly distorted. Cicero wasn't the abject hypocrite and coward he's been made into by the makers of the series. He delivered the Philippics against Antony himself, and was a figure of great power and huge popularity. Atia gets even worse treatment: described by Tacitus as one of the most admired and devout matrons of Rome, who couldn't bear crude language and was deeply serious, she is turned into a foul-mouthed, violent she-devil.
Generally speaking it is a pity that most of the characters are rather flat and stereotyped. It sometime makes it hard to believe when they do change, as when the cynical libertine Mark Antony suddenly waxes philosophical after loosing the battle of Actium. Easily the most complex, fascinating and moving character in the series is that of Brutus, played with consummate skill and total conviction by Tobias Menzies. It is a great pity that the scriptwriters did not retain for him his dignified suicidal death, but instead have him madly confront an entire legion on his own, and die a death mirroring that of Caesar - the symbolism is very trite.
Such concerns may seem academic, but in this TV-dominated age its only too likely that many will think that after watching ""Rome"" they actually know something of Roman history. Not so - but they will have been splendidly entertained.",1207353600,57,6130,5.151606425702811
2831515,5,B000Q66PXE,"If you enjoy history and historical drama, this is a great series for you.  Very high production values, real historical characters that come to life, and excellent writing make this a smash hit.  This series is produced by HBO, which is known for high quality work.  Also, this series has been highly rated by critics and the public.  You will see much violence, blood, and passion, which is an historically accurate look at the 1st century Roman Empire.  The are many characters you'll both love and hate, and will enjoy watching how they evolve as the story unfolds over the course of two seasons.

Weaves historical fact with soap drama to tell an intriguing story of ancient Rome and thereby shows the differences and similarities of life then and now.  This series has brought to life and explained more about ancient Rome than any textbook or movie I have previously seen. it manages to combine history, sex,  violence, eye candy, drama, intrigue and politics into a series that we will not see the likes of again anytime soon.",1202515200,2,620,5.18

The same day to day hostilities that the romans had, we still have. The Roman Gladiators of today are the WWF, UFC and Boxing fights. We may not have slaves but big corporations have enslave us.

2831520,5,B000Q66PXE,"I borrowed Rome from a friend last year since I do not get HBO. I was immediately hooked to this show. It is very entertaining, with fantastic costumes, scenery, and character personas. While not a show you would want a child or young teen to watch (they're definitely not afraid of showing nudity), most adults cannot help but enjoy the story as it unfolds.

The normal price of these two sets sold together is fairly high, but if you can get it at a sale price (like today's deal of $60!), it is well worth the expense.",1197676800,3,521,4.371134020618556
2831521,5,B000Q66PXE,"This is easily one of the best shows that has been on TV.  It's a dramatic, politico-intrigue thriller, and it's pretty accurate to the broader strokes of history (by TV/film period drama standards) -- perhaps though I don't expect the same level of exacting adherence to historical fact as the previous reviewer who complained that Cicero wasn't actually in Rome during an important vote.  The acting is superb and the cinematography lives up to the high standards set by other HBO shows.

All the reviewers who gave this box set a low rating for its price: you are not helpful -- The price fluctuates, but the product doesn't change.  I agree with what you are saying that it is stupid how these WERE priced more as a boxset than individually, but you should add your comment about the price to the end of your post as a footnote -- and you shouldn't incorporate it into your rating of the ROME series (maybe minus one star if you feel it's a huge ripoff, but make that clear).  Any semi-conscious consumer knows $180 is a rip-off, to say nothing of the fact that we all have different price points.

Modern habits, slang, and even 'too-perfect' costumes made me cringe at every scene.

All this aside, the storyline was VERY hard to follow. One episode isn't much different than the rest. One big drama episode with zero continuity. I had mistakenly watched all the episodes on disk 1, then started disk 3. I didn't really miss much when I went back for all of disk 2!

I was really looking forward to this series, but I just can't get into it any more. Its as inaccurate as the ""1980's Cafe"" in Back to the Future.",1197676800,10,714,4.658730158730159

Top notch production featuring excellent writing, performances, cinematography, action etc. The gold box special at 60 bucks for both seasons 1 and 2, is a steal considering other sites are selling this set in excess of twice that. Lots of worthwhile extras. And to all those fans complaining about the initial high price.., Blame HBO for overpricing their stuff, not Amazon.com.

2831575,3,B000Q66PXE,"I personally believe that these two seasons comprise one of the best shows in creation - second, very closely - to The Shield's creativity and rawness, especially for a cable television show.  I would give this show 5 stars easily but the pricing is obviously out of whack.  However, as an avid lover of history and the greatest world empire in human history - second only to America - we must learn to love the traits instilled by the very institution of Rome.  The price is too high in my opinion and I've already seen the show but I wish to add the DVD's to my collection.  Just as the bustling markets and trade of the Roman streets bartered an acceptable price, I too will wait for the price to drop yet voice my grievances.  However, for someone who has interest in history and incredible storyline and authenticity... it would definitely be a good gift item.  (Especially bought separately as it is cheaper.)

Now, everytime we talk ... I get a freaking book review of the most recent episode. I sincerely believe they are addicted.

They tell me that it is historically accurate and very realistic. Their daughter has a doctorate in Latin and their son married a vegan, so I think they are pretty creditable people.

I watched only 15 minutes ... and I got hungry for a Ceasar's Salad.

I don't want to ruin this series for anyone by giving away the ending, but from what I understand, in the end - everyone becomes Italian.",1194134400,6,567,4.423076923076923
2831577,4,B000Q66PXE,"Season 1 of Rome is an enjoyable view into the lives of many different characters set circa 50 BC in the last years of Julius Caesar's reign. Primarily, the series focuses on the exploits of two soldiers, Lucius Vorenus -- played superbly by Kevin McKidd -- and Titus Pullo also portrayed superbly by Ray Stevenson.

We watch through 12 season 1 episodes as Caesar rises to (and falls from) power over his mentor Pompey Magnus to create the all-powerful Rome. Marc Anthony is Caesar's right hand man. Cleopatra even makes an appearance.

The series revolves around the exploits of two soldiers, Lucius Vorenus - played superbly by Kevin McKidd - and Titus Pullo also portrayed superbly by Ray Stevenson. The real fun of the show is watching Pullo and Vorenus battle violently in violent times and struggle with their own family values, loyalty to the Empire and friendship to each other.

Season 2 of Rome is set circa 30 BC just after Julius Caesar's murder.

In Season 2 Pullo and Vorenus become entwined with Mark Anthony and Octavian of the Julii, son of Atia (lover to Marc Anthony and others). Season 2 focuses on Octavian's rise to Emperor of Rome by political guile and bloody force.

We watch through 10 Season 2 episodes as Octavian gains power over (his adversary at times--friend at times--stepfather figure at times) Marc Anthony. Cleopatra is also back and has a bigger role in Season 2.

Both seasons are not always action-packed and move along a bit slowly at times, but overall they are so well done that--similar to other HBO series like The Sopranos--when they're good...they're really good.

The price of this DVD series is perhaps HBO's way of saying, ""You don't like it?...Subscribe to HBO!"" So, you might consider renting unless you're a collector. Further, at the time of this writing, it's MUCH cheaper to buy the series releases individually.
