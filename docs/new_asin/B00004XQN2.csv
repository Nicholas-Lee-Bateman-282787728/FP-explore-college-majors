1369445,5,B00004XQN2,"A video you must get. There is so much of English history within the walls of Westminster Abbey, and, dare I say, would turn the most ardent republican back to a royalist! Most the musical items presented were superb. Carlotte's rendition of two verses of ""The Holy City"" was a little strained, perhaps due to her youth, but her rendition of ""Silent Night"" with the seasoned Bryn Terfel was just sheer delight, one of the best I've ever heard. This is not just a video for Christmas, but for any time of the year, when you want to be uplifted and inspired. You will also hear the Queen's english spoken at its best.",993340800,14,615,4.451327433628318
1369446,5,B00004XQN2,"I received my video yesterday and watched it immediately.  I was captivated from beginning to end by the spectacular music, scenery and pagentry.  The buyer of this video should be aware, however, that it is not just about Andrea Bocelli.  I have been a loyal fan of Andrea's from his earliest days of singing in Italy, and once again he is in true form and sings his three songs beautifully.  The music of Charlotte Church and Bryn Terfel is just as lovely, and the readings of scripture and the music of the Westminster choirs were wonderful and help to bring into focus the true meaning of this holy season.  The expressions on the faces of the young boys in the choir were priceless.  This video provided me with an hour of exquisite peace and was the perfect way to begin preparing for the upcoming holiday season.  It helped to reinforce the true reason we celebrate this holy season-the celebration of the birth of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.",973036800,104,957,4.627218934911243
1369447,3,B00004XQN2,"After waiting what seemed like forever,I received the video 'Christmas from Westminster'. I was very much impressed by the choir of the Westminster Abbey and by the readings. This video could not stand up to the claim that it starred 'Andrea Bocelli'.He sang several versions of 'Ave Maria', but he came across either as not well or not into the spirit of the occasion. I am a great fan of his and hate any negative words about him. I am constantly sing his praises to everyone I know and have gotten him many new fans",972777600,23,518,4.463157894736842
1369448,5,B00004XQN2,"Live performances with a variety of soloists in the Westminster Chapel at Christmas time, what could be better? We have watched it every year since we bought it.",1400198400,,161,4.785714285714286
1369449,5,B00004XQN2,"I and my wife love Andrea Bocelli and it was nice to see and hear Charlotte Church again!  The scenery was beautiful and shows format was great.  The English really know how to put on a show!  What more can I say, other than we loved it.  We will enjoy watching it again each Christmas to come.",1390953600,2,294,4.105263157894737
1369450,1,B00004XQN2,I never actually received this item.  I tried going on-line to let you know but lacked the technological know-how to get my message to go through.  Very frustrating.  I wish one could actually talk to a representative.  I paid for the item.,1364601600,,240,4.642857142857143
1369451,1,B00004XQN2,At $46.00....would not recommend or buy again...Andrea Bocelli sang only two songs...a rip-off!!  You advertise this as a Bocelli and Ms Church program.....has anyone watched this????  Why would you say Bovelli/Church....so you can charge $46.00!  Bad deal!!  It's too bad you can not review the songs on this DVD before you buy!,1363478400,2,329,5.269230769230769
1369452,4,B00004XQN2,SAW THIS ON TV AND HAD TO HAVE IT.  GREAT FOR THE XMAS SEASON.  BEAUTIFUL MUSIC SET IN AN OLD ENGLISH MOOD.  NOT ONLY FEATURING ANDREA AND CHARLOTTE BUT OTHER PERFORMERS AND CHORUS. IT IS AN OLD WORLD EXPERIENCE.,1331769600,,212,4.384615384615385
1369453,5,B00004XQN2,Andrea Bocelli seemed so young there.  His performance was excellent and soulful as always.  I enjoyed watching such a young Bryn Terfel perform.  This was a treat to watch.  The setting was beautiful and an excellent venue for Bocellis' voice to soar and reach the angels.  The orchestra and choir were delightful.  A good performance by all.,1326672000,,343,4.9298245614035086
1369454,2,B00004XQN2,"This was OK, but not quite what I'd hoped for.  It's basically the same program as Kings College on PBS.  Lovely, but I'd hoped for more of Andrea Bocelli.",1228176000,2,155,4.310344827586207

1369456,4,B00004XQN2,"Both my husband and I were touched by the combined grandeur of the venue, the beauty of the voices and the spiritual power of the selections. This is what Christmas should be about.",1199664000,,181,4.515151515151516
1369457,4,B00004XQN2,The soul fulfilling voice of Andrea was complemented by the rest of the cast.  A very entertaining DVD.,1199059200,,103,4.722222222222222
1369458,5,B00004XQN2,"Sure to become a classic in our household, the ""Christmas Glory from Westminster""  is a fantastic tapestry of sights and sounds.  The enchanting architecture of the abbey decorated for the Holidays creates a beautiful backdrop for the singers who perform some of the most peaceful of musical compositions.  This is a DVD that will soothe even the most stressed-out of us during the hustle and bustle of the Christmas season.",1197072000,,424,5.0285714285714285
1369459,4,B00004XQN2,"A Christmas package with Andrea Bocelli, Charlotte Church, choir boys and scripture readings. It has the Christmas spirit and Andrea Bocelli sounds great. An evening of Christmas music, readings, and poetry in a beautiful abbey are presented to the viewer for 60 minutes.

1369460,3,B00004XQN2,"A formal holiday video that will put you in the mood for Christmas. It shows a ""high brow"" concert from Westminster with soloist Charlotte Church and Andrea Bocelli. The voices, especially Andrea's are pleasant and powerful. The boy's choir is also inspirational. The scenery and background are very British as well as the commentary. A nice change of pace.",1103328000,6,357,5.067796610169491
1369461,2,B00004XQN2,"I love Bocelli and visited Westminster recently so there should have been a great connection with this video but I found it a touch boring and uninspiring.  Christmas Glory had some moments with a couple of songs but overall the video was disappointing.  If you are in search of Bocelli selections, there are far better choices  - Sacred Arias for one.",1059350400,12,352,4.737704918032787
1369462,4,B00004XQN2,"To hear singing anytime from Westminster is a treat, but to hear some of the greatest voices of our time singing therein was awe inspiring; especially the selections herein.  The only negative to this entire album is the inclusion of Charlotte Church.  Her voice is nothing more than that of a choir girl.  They would have been better off by just puting her in the choir and leaving the serious singing to someone who has has range and vocal control.  But this video is worth purchasing in spite of Charlotte.",1031011200,29,509,4.622222222222222
1369463,5,B00004XQN2,"I found this DVD on Amazon with a search on Charlotte Church, but this really isn't an album staring her, but a BBC Christmas special with a whole host of singers and speakers. Charlotte does a lot better singing on her other albums, since it looks like she was nervous here, but the real purpose of this DVD is praising Jesus. You won't be disappointed with this DVD.  If you are like me, here in the US, you won't be familiar with Westminster Abbey, or with some of the songs.
Get this DVD.",1029369600,12,492,4.290322580645161
1369464,4,B00004XQN2,"This is a classic Christmas album with some of the world's greatest voices.  And the setting is one of the world's great vocal settings in Westminster Abbey.  Most notable among the vocalists is Andrea Bocelli and Bryn Terfel.  The one drawback to this collection is the inclusion of Charlotte Church.  Even singing in an area which is her strength, you cannot help but notice her lack of range, lack of vocal control, and incredible lack of emotion.  It would have been better for all if Miss Church had stepped back into the participating choir where she is among peers.  Fortunately, on Silent Night, we hear the great Bartione voice of Bryn Terfel coming through in spite of Miss Church's best efforts to drown it out.  There are many classic moments here which make this video well worth its price despite the presense of Charlotte Church",1012089600,110,843,4.772413793103448
1369465,3,B00004XQN2,"Charlotte Church in my mind is one of the most beautiful spirits alive on the earth today. She has an almost angelic quality about her that always makes me wonder if God stops everything he is doing to listen to her sing. When she sings ""The Holy City"" it gives me shivers just from the pure beauty of her voice.

When I listen to Andrea Bocelli, I always close my eyes because there is something spiritual about his voice. While Charlotte and Andrea do make many appearances, the choir is magnificent.

One thing I noticed that amused me to no end was when Charlotte Church was singing, the choir boys stood so perfectly it was as if they were enchanted by her. In fact, anyone singing with her seemed to think they had just gone to heaven.

A spiritual evening one imagines would be quite wonderful to have
experienced at the Westminster Abbey in person.
