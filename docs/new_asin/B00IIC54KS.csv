8642220,5,B00IIC54KS,"Really poor travel documentary.  The sound quality is absolutely horrible.  The volume fluctuates, dropping to such low levels that you cannot even hear most of the dialogue. To make it worse music has been edited over the dialogue. Did they even bother to watch the final product?  How was it possible to release it in this condition?  I am still hoping Amazon will refund me the price of the DVD.  The time I spent watching it is lost forever",1501113600,,444,4.569620253164557
