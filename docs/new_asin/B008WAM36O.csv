5186458,5,B008WAM36O,These were the first two Stephen Chow movies I saw. I loved them and became a fan. This has to do with the Monkey King. Check them out and his other films.,1354924800,7,155,3.875
5186459,3,B008WAM36O,If it had been compressed into a single movie the pace might have been better.  Worth watching but don't expect a fast pace movie,1354924800,,129,4.375
5186460,5,B008WAM36O,"Stephen Chow created an amazing body of work for the Hong Kong market in the 1990s, and very little of it has trickled to the West.  Unfortunately, since since smash hit ""Kung Fu Hustle"", he has been largely paralyzed into inactivity.  What a shame, because as a comedian - and he is primarily a comedian, not a martial artist - he rates among the world's best.  Slowly we are seeing some of his classics get English subtitled releases.

'Chinese Odyssey 1 & 2' are two back-to-back movies that are the wildest and most surreal of his career, and that's saying a lot!  They tell the story of the Monkey King and are done in a style similar to Terry Gilliam in 'Time Bandits'.  Off-the-wall humor and sight gags rule the day.  But underneath all the buffoonery and make-up there is a great love story and a plot not unlike ""Back to the Future'.

If you like Hong Kong cinema and want to see something more than a little different, I highly recommend these two movies.  The price is right, and unlike my previous HK version, the subtitles make sense.  Non-stop action and comedy, but with a serious side, 'Chinese Odyssey 1 & 2' will entertain you.  There is an exceptional ensemble cast, but Stephen Chow steals the day as usual, even when he is disguised as the Monkey King.

I can only hope for even more Chow to be released, such as the 'Fight Back To School' series or 'Forbidden City Cop'.  How about 'God of Cookery' or 'From Being With Love'?",1354320000,24,1448,4.480916030534351
5186461,4,B008WAM36O,"I enjoyed the movie as a good martial arts, filming, special effects and story.  My wife is  Chinese so the audio is Mandarin for her, and I use the English subtitles.",1353888000,,167,4.354838709677419

5186500,5,B008WAM36O,"Saw this movie when I was a kid... Still consider this one of the best movies (I'm considering both movies as one) ever. The pacing and the comedy might not be suitable for everyone, but it's totally worth it once you you've watched both movies.  Also.. try re-watching it, you will catch a lot of things you were not able to initially.

Highly recommend it if you're able to deal with the pacing.",1418083200,,397,4.424657534246576
5186501,4,B008WAM36O,"i am in love with Stephen Chow, this movie was previously only available for the Honk kong market. it is a 2 part Epic Tale of the Monkey King and very similar to his new movie journey to the West. all the elements of a supernatural Chinese tale are here- Demons, Goddesses, Monks and monsters.",1416787200,,294,4.363636363636363

5186517,3,B008WAM36O,"I became acquainted with Stephen Chow' work when I first saw ""Lawyer, Lawyer"".  There are a couple of scenes in there that are hilarious and, after that, began looking up his work.  Here, in the west, we know him primarily for ""Shaolin Soccer"" and ""Kung Fu Hustle"".  ""Chinese Odyssey"" rates a little below ""Royal Tramp"" and ""King of Beggars"" but it is typical Chow and deserves a look by any fan.",1401494400,,396,4.549295774647887

5186520,3,B008WAM36O,These are good movies. I rated it 3 stars because it does have Chinese caption and the sound track is little bite off of the speaking movement.,1372896000,,143,4.333333333333333

8531358,4,B008WAM36O,"These are fairly funny and entertaining, action comedy with a variation of the Chinese tale of the Monkey king.  Not quite as good as""Kung fu shuffle"" or hustle, but enjoyable none the less.",1501027200,,190,4.757575757575758
