8161790,5,B000LE16XK,JAG is a tremendous series that you don't want to miss. I have seen and now have all ten seasons of it and I really enjoy watching them again and again. I will never get tired of watching JAG. David James Elliott (Harmon Rabb) and Catherine Bell (Sarah McKenzie A.K.A. MAC)  just exceed their talent in this series. They are truly fun to watch and I enjoy watching them over and over again.,1412899200,,390,4.342465753424658
8161791,5,B000LE16XK,"I didn't watch JAG when it initially appeared on TV.  I got hooked watching the reruns and I was so happy to find this collection of the first 3 seasons.  The quality is great and the commentaries and special features are very interesting.  I have the 4th season on order--it's to be released 8/21--and I'm counting the days.  If you are a fan, I highly recommend this set.",1186617600,,373,4.4411764705882355

8161793,5,B000LE16XK,"Probably the best show, series on TV.  Sorry it ended after an astonishing 10 years.  Military, with subtle sexiness and real life .",1166054400,6,132,4.695652173913044
