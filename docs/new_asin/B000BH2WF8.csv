2417130,5,B000BH2WF8,In response to the one of the previous comments about the WWF logo...the reason it's not blurred on the Warrior DVD is because it's the block WWF logo...for some reason they don't have to blur that one out...but they do have to blur out the WWF scratch logo...which is where you run into problems...i probably won't get around WM 14-18 because of that...it's a shame...anyway...should be a pretty good set nonetheless,1128729600,,417,4.887323943661972
2417131,5,B000BH2WF8,"I've read some of the reviews for this set and have the same concerns as far as the censoring goes.  But I also just watched the Warrior DVD last night and realized that WWF was only censored if spoken, not on banners/turnbuckles/microphones etc.  I don't know if the same rules will apply for the WrestleMania anthology or not.  But it looks like they just can't say WWF; World Wrestling Federation is alright to say.",1128556800,,418,4.621621621621622

2417133,5,B000BH2WF8,"31 DISCS FOR 200 DOLLARS IS GREAT VALUE. I VE SEEN THE LAYOUT AND CHAPTERS AND THESE VERSIONS ARE VERY SIMILAR IF NOT IDENTICAL TO WRESLEMANIA THE LEGACY RELEASED ON VHS IN 1998. THEY ARE MORE COMPLETE THAN THE COLISUEM VERSIONS RELEASED IN THE 1990 S. THE ONLY THING I WANT TO KNOW IS , HOW DID THE WWE GET ROUND THE WWF LOGO AND MERCHANDISING BAN FROM 2002. CAN SOME ONE TELL ME THAT OR IS THE WHOLE LOT EDITED.",1128297600,,413,4.111111111111111

I have a few of the Wrestlemania's already, so I may not buy the complete set, but I'm definitely going to be buying a few of the individual volumes. Hall of Famers, Unforgettable matches, Record-breaking Arenas', Bra and panty matches, what more has to be said.......",1127779200,,372,4.7384615384615385
2417135,5,B000BH2WF8,These anthologies are getting harder to find since they haven't been produced for years.  Wonderful box set.  Bought it as Christmas gift for our son.

2417147,4,B000BH2WF8,"Would give this 6 stars if I could due to the overall awesomeness of this Christmas gift. Absolutely everything I could ask for as an old school wrestling fan. The only reason it is getting a 4 star review is due to the fact that multiple DVD's were damaged upon receipt. I think there were 4 of them that had blemishes and skipped. Did a cross shipping replacement, swapped the DVD's from the replacement set and am a happy camper.

Be sure to check every single DVD for scratches or manufacturing defects or you'll be disappointed. Thanks to my wife for reading other reviews of this product and telling me to check the DVD's for quality upon receipt of this gift. Do yourself a favor and give each disk a quick look over. It will be very easy to see which disks are damaged by a quick inspection.

Overall I would recommend this set to any wrestling fan without hesitation.",1423353600,,876,4.46875

2417151,5,B000BH2WF8,this is awesome collection but be warned some of them are dual disced one side has one half of the mania and the second half is on the other. they all look the same so this will be hard to discern also they star4t censoring the wwf in the signs and things in 14 and on till about 18 when they changed it.,1400716800,,304,3.8412698412698414

2417159,1,B000BH2WF8,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  As of earlier this year the issues between WWE and the Word Wildlife Foundation have been resolved.  Due to this all of the DVD's/Blu-rays released in the 2nd half of this year have the stratch WWF logo unlburred, and WWF is no longer muted out.

This makes this release obsolete.  With Wrestlemania 30 coming up the WWE needs to release a new Wrestlemania Anthology set with the WWF references restored.  They should also release it on Blu-Ray along with a lot of extras.",1383436800,2,498,4.613636363636363
2417160,5,B000BH2WF8,"This collection is GREAT!! I had the VHS tapes when they first came out, and the DVD's are basically the same thing with the exception for some wrestlers music being edited(the music for those that were edited weren't that great anyway). Watching the earlier WrestleMania's brings me back to the ""good ole days"" of wrestling when storylines & wrestling were so much cooler. Kind of saddens me to see the wrestlers that are no longer with us. Overall a great buy, and the price is right too.",1380067200,,490,4.64367816091954

2417162,4,B000BH2WF8,"WWE fans will appreciate this 22-disc DVD collection of Wrestlemania. All the best moments from 1985-2006 are included. It is a collector's dream containing some classic action from the 1980s through the modern era of wrestling (the first 22 Wrestlemanias are included). All the old greats are here: Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, The Ultimate Warrior and many others. There are smaller versions of this box set in multiple DVD volumes but if you want the complete collection you can't miss this massive set. My only complaint is that not all of the matches are included, some of the trash talking is edited out and various musical entrances are cut. There isn't much in the way of bonus features either. A deluxe Blu-ray release with 3 bonus discs of supplements would rate 5 stars. This anthology has managed to hold its value.",1378598400,9,827,4.830985915492958
2417163,5,B000BH2WF8,My husband has enjoyed going through these oldies.  He grew up watching wrestling and enjoyed going back through these.  He sat and compared all of the wrestlers to where they are now and what they have accomplished over the years.,1377388800,2,231,4.75

Nowadays Wrestlemania is not what it use to be, but this Anthology will throw you back into the good days of professional wrestling where the matches were breath taking. Not just the main events, but also the mid card matches. The box and cases that contain these disc are so amazing. I especially love the one with Bret and Shawn facing each other. Bret Hart being my favorite wrestler. I was surprised  to see that there was an extra case containing Wrestlemania 21 and 22. I thought it was only 1-20. Good thing too because I wanted to re-watch the classic match at Wrestlemania 21 with Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle. This is the perfect package for Wrestlemania.",1359936000,9,733,4.638461538461539

Really great.  My only gripe about this, some of the wrestlers entrace music is changed.  Demolition does not have their Search and Destroy song by Rick Derringer but some cheap horror music, Ricky Steamboat instead of eye in the sky has some odd karate music....the fact that they own those songs I don't understand why they changed it....but other than that, this is great!",1332460800,,666,4.434426229508197

This is the grand daddy of them all and the place where you will see the absolute best performances. In this set you will get Wrestlemania's 1-21. Even though the music and ""WWF"" logos are edited, this is still a great set. Only Wrestlemania's that are not during the attitude era, their logos hasn't been blurred out. Some theme musics are editied as well so be a lookout for that. I will go through each Wrestlemania & give detail about the most important aspects of it. Oh and also for some Mania's there are two sides to the disc in order to see the whole event.

Wrestlemania
Where it all began. Hosting from MSG, Hulk Hogan & Mr. T battles Paul Orndoff & Roddy Piper in the main event. Big John Studd vs. Andre the Giant in a $15,000 slam match.

Wrestlemania 2
Hosting from 3 locations. Hulk Hogan & King Kong Bundy in the only Steel Cage match thus far at Wrestlemania for the WWF title in the main event.

Wrestlemania III
This is the Mania where Hulk Hogan slams Andre the Giant in the main event for the WWF title. Randy Savage & Ricky Steamboat delivers a classic for the IC title.

Wrestlemania IV
We saw Andre vs. Hogan 2 in the 16 man tournament to crown a new WWF champion here. Ted Dibiase and Randy Savage in the finals for the WWF title.

Wrestlemania V
The Mega Powers explodes in this Mania as Hulk Hogan and Macho Man Randy Savage challenges for the WWF title in the main event. Also Rick Rude vs. Ultimate Warrior for the IC title.

Wrestlemania VI
One of the best main events in Wrestlemania history. Hulk Hogan & the Ultimate Warrior battles for the WWF & IC titles in a classic match up.

Wrestlemania VII
Best match on the card was the Retirement match between Ultimate Warrior & Randy Savage. Undertaker makes his Wrestlemania debut against Jimmy Snuka.

Wrestlemania VIII
Ric Flair's first Wrestlemania. Defends the WWF title against Randy Savage in the match of the night. Too bad it wasn't the main event(even though it does say it is the main event on the box, it isn't though). Bret Hart takes on Roddy Piper in a great match for the IC title.

Wrestlemania IX
Nothing good came from Wrestlemania 9. In my view the worst Wrestlemania of all time.

Wrestlemania X
Wrestlemania returned to MSG for it's 10th anniversary. Owen Hart & Bret Hart had the best match on the card. And how can you forget about the classic Ladder match between Shawn Michaels & Razor Ramon for the undisputed IC title.

Wrestlemania XI
HBK challenges Diesel for the WWF title. Bret Hart vs. Bob Backlund in a Submission match. LT & Bam Bam was pure crap though. To me, this was the second worst Wrestlemania.

Wrestlemania XII
Shawn Michaels' boy hood dream came true after defeating Bret Hart in the classic Ironman match for the WWF title. Undertaker & Diesel has a great match up as well. Roddy Piper & Goldust in a good Hollywood backlot brawl. Wrestlemania debuts for Stone Cold Steve Austin & Triple H.

Wrestlemania 13
XIII had it's ups & downs. Bret Hart & Stone Cold had the match of year in their epic submission match. Undertaker wins his first championship gold at Wrestlemania here by defeating Sid for the WWF title. Ahmed Johnson w/ LOD battles the Nation of Domination in a Chicago street fight.

Wrestlemania XIV
Awesome Wrestlemania. The Austin 3:16 era begins after Stone Cold defeats Shawn Michaels for the WWF title. Undertaker & Kane in my opinion had the match of the night. Triple H vs. Owen Hart was very good also. And the first ever tag team dumpster match as Cactus Jack & Terry Funk faces the New Age Outlaws.

Wrestlemania XV
The only good thing from this Mania is The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin for the WWF title. Everything else is decent including the Hell in a Cell match between Underaker & Bossman.

Wrestlemania 2000
I never understood why they didn't refer to this as Wrestlemania 16. But its refered as Wrestlemania 2000. It hosted the first ever Fatal Four match for the WWF title. Triple H vs. The Rock vs. Mick Foley vs. Big Show. But the match of the night was Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle vs. Chris Jericho. Also the triangular tag team ladder match.

Wrestlemania X-Seven
In many people's eyes the greatest Wrestlemania of all time. The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin for the WWF Title. Triple H vs. Undertaker. TLC 2. Shane McMahon vs. Vince McMahon in a Street Fight. Also Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit.

Wrestlemania X8
The Rock & ""Hollywood"" Hogan delivers an unforgettable match. Undertaker goes 10-0 at Mania by defeating Ric Flair in a No Dq match. Triple H vs. Chris Jericho for the Undisputed title. Also Kane takes on Kurt Angle.

Wrestlemania XIX
This Mania is very close up there with 17 in being the greatest. Brock Lesnar & Kurt Angle in the main event for the WWE title. The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin for the final time at Wrestlemania. Shawn Michaels returns at Mania in 5 years to face Chris Jericho. Also Hulk Hogan & Vince McMahon in a Street Fight.

Wrestlemania XX
""Where It All Begins Again"". Wrestlemania's 20th homecoming returns to MSG again. It had in my view the greatest Wrestlemania match of all time, Triple H vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shawn Michaels for the World Title. Undertaker returns to face Kane. Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle. Chris Jericho & Christian has a great match too. Wrestlemania debuts for Randy Orton, John Cena, & Batista.

Wrestlemania 21
Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle delivers a classic match. The Money in the Bank Ladder match makes its debut. Randy Orton trys to defeat the Legend Undertaker. Batista defeats Triple H for the World title in a very good better than expected main event.

There you go. I hope this was very helpful to you. Wrestlemania is a good set to get if you have that kind of money around. But they do come in volume sets comprised of 5 Wrestlemanias in each volume. Since this was published in '05, Wrestlemanias 22, 23, & 24 are not part of this set. If you're a a die hard fan of wrestling then I recommend getting this. Overall, with some of these Wrestlemanias hard to get I recommend the volume sets first before purchasing the whole thing.",1229731200,,6184,4.557258791704238
2417184,4,B000BH2WF8,Just wanted to drop a note on the great service provided. My purchase came in a timely maner. 1/2 way across the world I might add. The quality was outstanding. I will do more business in the future.,1216512000,3,199,4.2631578947368425
2417185,4,B000BH2WF8,"I only gave it a 4 because I haven't watched it yet, but as far as price and the packaging, I've had no problems. Then again, I didn't buy mine from here. I went to the mall and got it from Suncoast for $119.99. I was expecting 21 discs, but it actually goes up to Wrestlemania 22. So, in any case, I have no room for complaints.",1182384000,,329,3.925373134328358
2417186,5,B000BH2WF8,"I have been a wrestling fan all my life and although I have had a few points where I had stopped following for awhile,mainly towards the late 90's,I will always be a wrestling fanatic. The prospect of having the entire Wrestlemania Anthology is something way too good to pass on.

I recieved this box set as a Christmas gift last year and after opening it,I told everyone else - ""XBox,DVDs,Watching TV,whatever you gotta do,you do in the other room. This TV is mine.""

I was immediately brought back to my youth as I spent the day and several days thereafter watching the clasics that I lived and died by as a kid. The ladder match at Wrestlmania X, The Title-For-Title Match at Wrestlemania VI, The salt in Bret Hart's eyes at Wrestlemania IX and the on-going list of others. I was in my glory.

Now, to address alot of the complaints that I've read about from other users and to help you further decide if you really want this box set:

-Yes,there are certain things that have been altered. I distinctly remember at Wrestlemania X there was a specific song showing the ""build up"" to Bret Hart v. Yokozuna. But honestly,it's not something that is going to change the way you enjoy the event. There isn't a Wrestlmania where The Undertaker gets pinned. Hulk Hogan still bodyslams Andre The Giant at Wrestlemania III.The first Wrestlemania still takes place at Madison Square Garden. These things that may be different aren't things you need to get hung up on.

-As far as the ""Get the 'F' Out"" thing goes - yes, they do block out most of the WWF logos. HOWEVER,when the logo is blocked out entirely is when it's on a turnbuckle or something very small. On larger scales,the two lines that come out of the right side of the WWF logo to represent the ""F"" are simply blurred out. And while it is very clear in some cases,like Wrestlemania X8 where all the cameramen are wearing shirts with the big logo and the logo is all over the place,it honestly only takes a little bit of getting used to and again isn't something you will likely find yourself getting too hung up on.

-The person who claimed that they bleep out the comentators saying ""WWF"" is true. But it is not anywhere nearly a frequent as this person is suggesting. Almost all the time,everything is refered to as ""World Wrestling Federation"" and in turn does not have to be censored. The first time I caught it was an interview with Hulk Hogan at Wrestlemania IX where he says he hopes Bret Hart holds on to his ""___ Championship."" You'll notice the blocked out images of the old logo,but very rarely is anything bleeped due to people calling something by ""WWF"".The matches are introduced as, for example, ""The following contest is scheduled for one fall and is for the World Wrestling Federation Intercontinental Cahpionship...""

All in all, if you are a wrestling fan and love it old and new,this is for you. You'll enjoy this. But if you are kinda into it or you like it now because of the women or storylines or something,it may not be for you and you should look into buying the volumes that contain every Wrestlemania in packs of five(i.e. - Wrestlemania I-V,VI-X,XI-XV,Wrestlemania 2000 - Wrestlemania XX.)",1166572800,13,3172,4.633451957295374
2417187,2,B000BH2WF8,"I am huge wrestling fan and when I saw this WM Anthology I couldn't wait to get it. I only bought Volumes 1 & 2 to be fair. I've seen every WM on these disc on the original VHS version and I was very dissapointed. The blurring of the WWF now WWE isn't as annoying as cutting out wrestlers theme songs. I was looking forward to hearing the original music form-

Demoliton

Big Boss Man

One Man Gang

Koko B. Ware

Dusty Rhodes etc.

I wasn't expecting to hear badly dubbed music over the classic original themes. Like someone else wrote I think the WWE has more than enough money to pay royalties. And a lot of footage was cut out of each WM disc. I don't know if it was WM 4 or WM 5 but in the beginning of the of the tape it shows various wrestlers in their locker rooms getting ready to wrestle and I was expecting to see that too. I'm just upset because I wished the whole set was complete and if wasn't there should've been a disclaimer.",1160870400,9,942,4.092391304347826

I figured why pay big money for something thats going irritate you while your trying to enjoy it. Its like going to the Playboy mansion and seeing all the playmates covered up. I prefer to purchase the wrestlemania's that only you like on Ebay such as the original vhs masters or dvds that came out starting after mania xv in decent condition. Then you can transfer them to dvd if you have a dvd/vhs recorder-which you should if you like collecting vintage tapes like I do. You can also create your own artwork for both the disc and cover insert but this takes time and must be kept for private use only and not sold. I have seen many ebayers get booted out for doing this kind of stuff. You'll save alot of cash especially since wrestlemania's are not highly sought after on ebay like the ""In your house"" pay-per-veiws or like the wcw tapes. Your choice. Either go original or watch what they want you to watch.",1158192000,5,1135,4.333333333333333

Every single Wrestlemania had the last five matches missing. Wrestlemania is nothing without the last few matches. I was hoping to see The Rock vs. Stone Cold for the WWF Title at Wrestlemania X-7 but it stopped on the ''TLC 2'' match between Edge and Christian, Team 3-D, and the now reunited Hardy Boyz. I returned the collecting and they gave me another one. It ended up being even worse. It kept on freezing and the disk wasn't even scratched. I heard the WWE was releasing a Royal Rumble and SummerSlam ''Complete Anthology'' collection. If it's as messed up as this terrible collection, I won't even look at it when I go shopping.

Although the former WWF logo is blurred out when visible and when spoken it is edited, this does not take away from the quality of this collection. Here, we have the ultimate anthology of the greatest events in sports-entertainment history with so many memorable matches.

If you are a a big fan of WWE, from past to present then you will not be dissapointed one bit. However, if you only enjoy the new era of wrestling, the complete anthology may not be just right for you. You can purchase seperate sets of past WrestleMania's, for instance- 1996-2001. My advice though is that you should purchase the entire collection and watch how the past greats have forged the way for the new stars. ]

2417192,5,B000BH2WF8,"If any of you are familiar with The Curmudgeon's other reviews, you may well be scratching your heads at this one. A FIVE star review?! That can't be right. And usually, YOU would be right. The Curmudgeon has dedicated 95 of his 100 reviews to bringing you the very worst things out there. To celebrate the 50 review milestone I reviewed 5 GREAT things that are available on Amazon, and so, now I've reached 100, I thought I'd do the same again. So, from reviews 100 - 105, it's going to be nothing but good, great and awesome stuff.

Now, like the four previous positive reviews, this is more a review of the general subject, not just this DVD in particular. Like, reviewing Season Seven of The Simpsons was an excuse to talk about the Simpsons in general and.. well, you get the idea.

Wrestling, then. An unfair stereotype is that of the knuckle-dragging, mouthbreathing wrestling fan. True, that type does exist (and the girls are always pig-ugly) but with the internet and discussion groups etc, I've discovered that some of the cleverest and funniest people on the net are wrestling fans. Hey, a bit like your old pal The Curmudgeon.

OK, so wrestling is the ultimate in lowbrow, no brainer entertainment. The more I think of it the weirder it is that I've enjoyed watching WWE for so many years. The WWE expects you to be entertained by..

Big flashy lights and loud explosions

Woeful acting

Laughable plots

Some utterly dire wrestlers

Shameless female exploitation

Not that there's anything wrong with the last one, but for every idiotic angle and storyline the WWE throws at us, they counter it with some superb matches, wrestlers and enjoyable, interesting feuds. When it's good, it's good, and when it's great - it is quite simply some of the best entertainment on television.

Wrestlemania has always been the granddaddy of main events, even if its appeal has waned over the years with countless main events throughout the year now instead of the traditional four. Nevertheless, this boxset contains some unmissable, classic stuff. And Wrestlemania IX, which deserves to be destroyed post haste.

To many, wrestling will always be ""fat guys rolling around in leotards"", but to the educated, wrestling (and for me, WWE) is grade A entertainment; ultra skilled athletes, hot women and 100% escapism every single week. Honestly, what's not to love?

And that's that, folks. Five ""nice"" reviews before the rot of the world sets in again and I begin to attack all the other crud available on Amazon for you to buy. Hope you've enjoyed this limited series of things that makes The Curmudgeons' world happy, smiley and bouncy. Now, I have to counteract all this nice guy stuff with something utterly, utterly loathsome. Whatever could THAT be? Only one way to find out, true believers...

2417193,5,B000BH2WF8,"Don't listen to the naysayers - this set is awesome.  From the holographic box, to the individually numbered Wrestlemania moment photos - this set is a complete joy.

Yes there is some blurring of the WWF logo and some annoying editing in some of the speech - due to WWF lawsuit issues - but once you get around that it doesn't detract from the product at all.  Yes, some of the music has been changed - but once again this should not detract from the matches at hand, and to be honest I think the Undertakers ""BadAss"" music is now much better than the original Limp Biskit track which got very old very quickly.

The disks are flawless, with no straches or skips or freezes, and although there are no special features, that's okay because of the shear amount of wrestling footage that is available.

Yes, $200+ is a lot of money to drop on a DVD set, but I'm glad I did.  Now any time I want to relive Hogan vs Andre' or The Rock vs Austin, I just have to pop in the disk and enjoy.  Find yourself missing DX or wanting to see the Godfather pimpin hoes nationwide - it's right there.

2417194,5,B000BH2WF8,"I waited a long time for the WWE to release WrestleMania I-XIV on DVD.  I must say that overall I was not disappointed.  Each WrestleMania is shown in its entirety (with the exception of WrestleMania XI).  The WrestleMania DVDs show the original television broadcasts.  I owned just about every WrestleMania in their original VHS format.  The older tapes of the shows they released were heavily edited in order to fit the program on one cassette.  They even edited some matches to make them shorter.  The only way you could see all these matches in their entirety was to watch the original television broadcasts ... until now!

Now, here is what is what is wrong with the DVD sets:

-Entrance music for a lot of Superstars is dubbed over with crappy, generic music so the WWE would not have to pay royalties to use these songs.

-Any verbal reference to WWF is edited out

-WrestleMania XIV-X8 blurs out the WWF scratched logo

-The Salt N' Pepper performance at WrestleMania XI was completely taken out so the WWE would not have to pay them royalties

-There are no extra features whatsoever ... just the event itself for every WrestleMania

I hated that all this great entrance music was taken out.  The edited out the entrance music to Slick's ""Jive Soul Bro,"" HillBilly Jim's ""Country Boy,"" Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, Demolition, Big Boss Man's ""Hard Time,"" and Ric Flair's original entrance music to name just a few.  I really miss ""Jive Soul Bro!""  I would have shelled out more dough for these DVDs if they ensured all the old theme music was included.  The blurred out WWF scratched logo is annoying but bearable.

Personally, I only purchased the first three box sets of WrestleMania I-XV because I already owned WresteMania XV-21 on DVD.  If you would prefer to own copies without all the WWF references edited out, I recommend you do the same and try to buy the original WresteleMania DVD releases off of Amazon or eBay for XV-21.  Plus, you miss out on a ton of DVD extras that the original DVD releases are packed with.

Regardless of the gigs I give this box set, I highly recommend to add these DVDs to your collection if you are a professional wrestling fan.  Every single match and interview is shown in its entirety.  Plus, it is the only way you will get these classic WrestleMania's in DVD format.",1142726400,2,2320,4.671604938271605
2417195,1,B000BH2WF8,"First of all, I have several WWE DVD's. On the one hand, I would love to stick to reviewing the content of these disks exclusively, but that is impossible given the incredibly shoddy quality of the disks themselves. I had to return BOTH WM 20 and 21 TWICE due to the constant skipping on all four dvd sets. I was finally able to secure playable copies of both Wrestlemania's, but it's really sad that I had to purchase six copies total in order to get anything that would work.

As far as the the WM Anthology, I am very disappointed.

First off, if you think you're getting the entirety of the wrestlemania dvd programs, forget it. You will not get any of the bonus materials included with the original dvd releases. The bonus materials aren't all that great (they are basically a compilation of tv spots and commercials) but it would have been incredibly easy to simply transfer the tapes to dvd since it's already available, and especially since WWE is investing in the lowest quality disks possible.

Second, the blurring is not exactly subtle. It is everywhere: on the shirts of photographers, on the apron of the ring, on the turnbuckles, on the microphones, on the front of the announce tables, on the monitors behind the performers on the entrance ramp, you get the picture.

Third, they've deleted a lot of entrance music and even the original announcers. The elevator music and phony echo of the new voice overs are absolutely cheesy.

Fourth, the menus have changed. This is less of an issue, but for WM 19 for example, they now have this boring brown backdrop instead of Limp Bizkit playing to a montage of high spots from the program. Stupid.

If possible, I would rank this anthology as a zero or one half star program. However, Amazon doesn't allow that, plus I got the disks for 30% off without sales tax or shipping, so at least this shoddy package was discounted heavily, if that's any consolation.",1140652800,4,1916,4.653846153846154
2417196,4,B000BH2WF8,"Well, just like everyone else, I fell victim to Wrestlemania hype. With that came the purchase of this box set. Well there were some good things and some bad things that came with it. However, the bad things out way the good.

Good Things:

 You get all Wrestlemanias in one deluxe set.

 All matches are here.

 It is a nice little set.

Bad Things:

 If you own Wrestlemania's 15-21, there are no need to watch the one's in this set. They have removed all extras and the promo music for fueds like the Limp Bizkit and Drowning Pool songs.

 All of the menus are genieric.

 About half of the show's are on two-sided discs. Not a big deal if you are careful. But with no extras, I don't see why they can't be on one side

 The blurring is kinda of dumb. Nothing you can do about it. Im not complaining or anything. But for the people who do, SHUT UP.

* The blurring is ridiculous.  Watching WrestleMania X8, you really see how they just plastered that logo EVERYWHERE, and
* the disc skipping is true as well, because it started to freeze up right before Arn Anderson came out from under the ring to spine-bust the Undertaker, who
* didn't have his correct theme music (Limp Bizkit), but what's really confusing is that many of the missing songs (Dusty Rhodes, Demolition, Big Boss Man, etc.), I'm pretty sure WWE just made those up in the first place, so why don't they have the rights to use them? And to answer some other dude's question, WM V's Piper's Pit IS on there, but
* there is footage missing where Piper rips off Brother Love's kilt and sends him running up the aisle in his red panties.  Who knows what else is missing?  Does anyone really have a photographic memory of 21 WrestleManias?

2417204,3,B000BH2WF8,"Pros:

1. It's great to finally have the older ones on a quality format like DVD.  This is the first time they've been released on DVD in the U.S.

2. As awesome as Wrestlemania can be, there have been a lot of bad matches over the years and it's nice to be able to skip through the chapters quickly.

3. As best as I can tell, all the events are in their entirety.  I don't know how the rumor about Ventura's commentary got started (probably the Internet), but none of it is true.  It's all here.

Cons:

1. Granted, the blurred logos make some shots look pretty bad, but that only occurs in numbers 14-18.  I don't know why people are blaming WWE for this.  They lost the court case, the decision applied to previous years they were in violation, and the blurring legally needed to be done. It's something that fans are going to have to live with and get used to during these few years of footage.  If it bothers you that much, you'll have to find the original DVDs.

2. Some of the music is edited, most notably anything from the Piledriver album.  Again, blame the lawyers for this one.  It's about rights and licensing, which WWE clearly didn't have and couldn't get.  Some reviewers seemed upset about this, but it happens infrequently on the discs and honestly didn't bother me.

3. Yes, anytime anyone says ""W.W.F."" the sound mutes.  This applies to every disc.  It's the same on the 24/7 Channel.  Get used to it because it's doubtful this will ever change.  Again though, it doesn't happen often and didn't really bother me.

So-So:

1. The quality of the packaging and discs probably could have been better, but it's not horrible as some people say.  It's decent, but not great.  Do the math.  You're paying roughly $10 a disc. They did have to make it affordable to the general public.",1135555200,9,1797,4.472222222222222

*You will notice on several of the Wrestlemanias,

especially the later ones, that there is fuzzing out

on the screen. This is blotting out of the ""WWF"" logos

throughout, on signs, turnbuckles, cameramen's shirts,

and elsewhere. This is very annoying, and it is very

pervasive on Wreslemanias 14-19. Even sound is edited,

whereby verbally saying ""WWF"" is silenced out.

*I have now, to date, had to return this box set three

times due to packaging and disk errors (once here to

Amazon). The first time, disk 5 had a freeze point.

Amazon would not replace the defective disk, but required

that I return the entire 21-disk set. In other words, if

you watch all the disks, and one is defective, you have to

return the WHOLE SET, and you have to watch them all over again.

(At least Amazon let me return the box set for a refund.)

The second set I bought, I had to return because it had

two Disk 1's and no Disk 2. The third time, disk 20 had a

freeze point. Buying this box set has been a buyer's nightmare.

*Having three defective box sets in a row makes me feel that

People who write reveiws like that are not true Wrestling fans and don't know anything about or understand the wrestling business.

When this dvd set was announced I considered buying it. My mom convinced me not to. The reason? I have nearly every wrestlemainia on tape or dvd. How much is it? $250? $300? That's a huge waste of money if you already have the wrestlemainias on tape or dvds. Extras? none. It would have been nice if they had extras of events leading up to the matches EG:Hogan vs Andre that set up WM 4. Also there are theme edits and the old WWF logo and any mention of it is censord.

Anyways this is a awesome must have set!! All the Wrestlemania's are shown in entirety even WM4 which was editted heavily for the VHS set to fit 3 hours. The commentary is all there even Jesse's. The only downside is WM15-18 which theres blurs everywhere, but not that bad and you could still enjoy those ppvs. Also some themes are editted especially Takers during the later Wrestlemanias. For WM18 his theme was ""Rollin"" by Limp Bizkit but was replaced with the Ministry theme. Also when they say WWF, they say WW and silently mute the F and the way its done is pretty well and could hardly tell.

Also all the longer Wrestlemania's are double sided where at a certain point you have to flip the disc over to continue, not like the UK set which is 31 discs. The ones that are double sided and have to flip over are: Wrestlemania 4,5,6,7,16,17,18,19,20, and 21.

It's absolutely appalling. Incredibly distracting from the action that happens. In some scenes, more are more than 5 blurs at one time. Some deal should have struck by vince to stop this. I don't know why the world wildlife foundation couldn't have made an exception for old wrestlemania's. The music editing was disapointing, I was hoping to hear the original music that was played at the time it was filmed, but I can deal with that.

Thankfully, I already have 15-18 on dvd in the original format. 14 has some of the scratch logo but at least it aint on the turnbuckles. Its on the ring and on some camera men. Jesse Ventura is in this set. I don't know how good wm3 would be without jess saying ""this is the biggest match in the history of professional wrestling."" But yeah, a good set.

2417220,4,B000BH2WF8,"Wrestlemania: The Complete Anthology is a huge step forward for WWE. I hope this leads to releasing box sets for Royal Rumbles and Survivor Series etc. I would even love to see boxed sets realeased for Starrcade and other old WCW and NWA events. As far as this box set, I have watched most of it and here is what I have seen.

1) These have not been shortened (like previous versions). All of the action, promos, and celebrity moments are there. They are as close to there original broadcast form as the WWE could get them.

2) Like everyone else, I HATE the blur...on WMs 15 to 18, the blur is all over the place. Vince will have to figure out a way to strike a deal with the environmentalist whackos at the WWF. He should buy the right to the ""WWF"" scratch logo on all old footage even if he continues to promote the current company as WWE. When they have to blur out the turnbuckles, the t-shirts of the cameramen around the ring...the belts and everything else, it really detracts from the action.

3) Personally, I can handle some of the music being replaced. It was done well in some cases. They do a decent job of embedding the new music into the background with the crowd noise. You can still hear the commentators talking during the music. Don't get me wrong, it is annoying that they don't have some of the old music on these like ""Don't go Messing With a Country Boy"", ""Demolition"" and ""Bird Bird Bird"" but for me, I get over it once the match starts...this is unlike the blur which detracts from everything.

4) Jesse Ventura's commentary is in-tact. The only parts of anyones commentary that I have noticed being edited are the references to ""WWF"" and instead, what you will get is ""WW....."" but again...this is not a major annoyance like the blur.

5) In some cases, they split the Wrestlemanias up onto both sides of the disc. On some of the longer events, you will have get up and flip the disc over. This is only the case on a few of them though (don't know which ones off of the top of my head...I am at work right now)

All in all, this is a good set to have. I have been ready for the WWE to start releasing the old stuff on DVD for years...and while there are a few areas where improvements can be made, I will take this over nothing any day. People come on Amazon and complain about most of this stuff like the music edits, and the Jesse commentary all the time. They have to understand that WWE is a business. Each time they go out pay someone for rights to use a song, or a logo, or Jesse gets royalties from a DVD...that takes away from the profit of a DVD...almost to a point where it isn't profitable anymore. Why should WWE engage in ventures that aren't profitable??? If you owned a business would you sell your product and what it was costing you to make your product?? No, you would invest your time in selling a produt that makes you money. Just keep in mind...the more of these DVDs we buy...the better the quality will get each time...because the more we buy, the more WWE can drive the cost of making them down...then it may make good business sense for them to buy the rights to the old logo back.

All in all...WWE is making great strides in what they choose to put out on DVD. I hope this continues...personally, I will keep buiying.",1130976000,37,3271,4.334967320261438

2417222,3,B000BH2WF8,"I haven't watched all of it yet but so far I like the fact that the entire wrestlemainas were not edited and JESSE VENtura's comeentary is in tact.

First No SUPERFLY JIMMY SNUKA, NO ricky steamboat, No SLick ""Jive Soul Bro"" they replaced it with Moonwalker waht a joke, NO DEMOLITION AHHHHHH.  that sounds horrible, koko B ware at wM 6 now has Piledriver and not BIRD BIRD BIRD.  Big Boss man hard times theme is out and his 200o music is back in, sucks.  Those are the big changes i noticed so far.",1130889600,5,613,4.25
2417223,3,B000BH2WF8,"The early sets are as close as possible the WWE could make them to the original broadcasts. Even the WWF introductory trailers made it to these discs ""What the world is watching..."". Unfortunately, probably to some kind of corporate policy for banding, the ""WW"" scratch logo is watermarked on the bottom left corner, though it is somewhat unobtrusive. I don't know why it has to be there at all - we know what we're watching, and the logo does look out of place. What would have been cool is if they put the old block logo there if they felt the need to brand every second of footage.

WrestleMania 2, especially, is like a new creation in this set. I never realized it ran almost 3 hours - it had always been cut to 2 hours for VHS. It is great seeing how they tried to make it work from 3 locations in 3 timezones. Unlike every VHS version, entrances and exits are shown on these DVDs if they were shown on the closed circuit or pay-per-view broadcast. To give you an example of the scale of this, WrestleMania I ran about 2 hours, WrestleMania 2 ran about 3 hours, the same for WrestleMania III, WrestleMania IV runs 4 hours (Oringally released on VHS in a two tape set), and WrestleMania V runs LONGER than WrestleMania IV (But was always cut for VHS to 3 hours). There's lots of things on each of these DVDs we've never seen before or for a long time...unless you taped your own live copy about two decades ago. Probably only thing missing is intermissions and advertisments for the next pay-per-view (WrestleMania VII was advertised as far back as WrestleMania VI!)

There's some oddities - there's some music edits, BUT Cyndi Lauper's Girls Just Wanna Have Fun survived and is featured on the women's championship match. Ricky Steamboat's music was changed, and The Slick's music, and I think Don Morcco's music. I can't find a good reason for this, these were included in all previous VHS copies... and I think they were Jim Johnson songs. You can tell when this happens, it is very obvious. The mid-90's WrestleMania song was chosen to be the menu audio for these DVDs... I guess they couldn't find a good copy of the older song that was much more 80's sounding for the early sets.

""WWF"" is surprisingly said very few times in the early WrestleManias. Koko B Ware has ""WWF"" on his trunks, and there's blurr on it in most shots. I hate to see what this looks like in 15-20, because the blurr job was bad. I think people should avoid getting the 15-20 set, probably best to find the original releases from a seller sometime.

I think the team that did these DVDs did the best they could with the restrictions they had. What I have a problem with is the restrictions - seems there wasn't enough leverage to get all the music cleared. Also, because of the extensive tape library of the WWF, it would have been great to have included more vinnettes of the back stories of these angles, since so many of them far removed from memory now. Another nice thing would have been to include the commercials and promos that were surely saturating WWF programming for each of these events. Maybe we'll see progress this way toward future classic releases.

There doesn't seem to be a lot of sound editing otherwise - I thought they would have taken out some ""boring!"" chants from WrestleMania IV (my favorite WrestleMania), but nope, they are there. Doesn't look like they canned cheers or jeers in this set because of that fact.

I promise you will have a better respect for WrestleMania I and 2 after watching those DVDs, if you are impressed by nothing else. I am happy with this, despite my frustrations with the changes. They have been outweighed by the faithfulness and care the team who made these sets had.",1130803200,8,3709,4.553223388305847

2417225,3,B000BH2WF8,"The WrestleMania Anthology is cool and everything, but it's the censorship of WWF that really upsets me. I mean, why do they always have to censor that logo just because of some stupid case back in 02? It makes no sense to me at all. Not to mention, most of the music was replaced from what I understand. What's really going on here?

2417227,5,B000BH2WF8,"Another potential problem with this dvd release(other than Jesse Ventura's commentary and the WWF logo issue) is the use of some of the original theme songs. If WWE had to pay for the rights of a theme song back in the day, chances are they will have to overdub them on the new dvd release. Here are some examples of songs that will have to be edited.

Virtually every theme song from WrestleMania 1. Hulk Hogan's ""Eye Of The Tiger"" will most likely be replaced with ""Real American"". Wendi Richter's ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" will be replaced with some generic music. Junk Yard Dog's ""Another One Bites The Dust"" will likely be replaced with ""Grab Them Cakes"". Mike Rotundo & Barry Windham came out to ""Born In The USA"". That will be changed too. Not to mention the actual theme song of WrestleMania 1 which was ""Easy Lover"" by Phil Collins will be edited too. Plus they closed WrestleMania 1 with the them from Beverly Hills Cop. Every one of those songs will have to be replaced.

From WrestleMania III Koko B. Ware's ""The Bird"" theme will likely be replaced with his later WWF version from WrestleMania 6. And I don't know about this for sure, but I would assume that Ricky Steamboat's theme will be replaced as well because WWF didn't create that song.

From WrestleMania IV I'm not sure if WWE still has the rights tot he music for both Strike Force(Girls In Cars by Robbie Dupree) as well as Demolition(by Rick Derringer). Unless they've worked out an agreement with them. I couldn't see much of an issue with Derringer because he also sings Real American and they already have that song locked up.

At WrestleMania X they showed a Bret Hart video sung by Tom Petty that may be changed to ""You Start The Fire"".

At WrestleMania XIV the Chris Warren Band(DX Band) opened the show with America The Beatiful and it was edited off the pevious releases of Mania XIV. Not sure if it was a contract issue or the fact that their version sucked.

The theme song for WrestleMania 17 was ""My Way"" by Limp Bizkit which could very possible get dubbed over. Also Limp Bizkit's ""Rollin' was used for Undertaker. I noticed on several WWE ppv dvd's in the past(Royal Rumble 2002 comes to mind), this song was dubbed over with some generic music. I'm sure there won't be any problems with Motorhead's Triple H theme as Triple H is very good friends with Motorhead.

WrestleMania 18 had 2 theme songs. Saliva's ""Superstar"" and Drowning Pool's ""Tear Away"". On the previous dvd release of Mania 18, ""Superstar"" was dubbed over throughout the whole show by ""Tear Away"". The only time ""Superstar"" was heard was when Saliva opened the show. However that was then and nowcould be a different stoy as both songs could be replaced. Also at Mania 18, Rob Van Dam's ""One Of A Kind"", Maven's Theme, Taker's ""Rollin"", Edge's ""Never Gonna Stop"", the nWo theme, Dudley Boyz' ""Get The Tables""(by Saliva) and Lita's ""LoveFuryPassionEnergy"" are all songs not owned by WWE.

WrestleMania 19's theme was Limp Bizkit's ""Crack Addict"". I'm sure if they can come to an agreement with Limp Bizkit on one song then they can agree on all of their songs. That's IF. Also Hulk Hogan's ""Voodoo Chile"", Chris Benoit's ""Whatever"" & Victoria's ""All The Things She Said"" are not owned by WWE. All of these songs could be replaced with their other theme songs that WWE owns.

WrestleMania XX's theme was ""Step Up"" by Drowning Pool. Also the Dudley Boyz' ""Drop The Bombshell"" and once again Victoria's ""All The Things She Said"" will have to be dubbed over. They were dubbed over on the original Mania XX release as well. Also Kane's theme ""Slow Chemical"" by Finger Eleven may have to be changed, but most likely not.

WrestleMania 21's theme was ""Big Time"" by TSOOL which was edited out on the last release of Mania 21. Edge's ""Metalingus"", Christy Hemme's ""Walk Idiot Walk"", Christian's ""Just Close Your Eyes"" and Randy Orton's ""Take What's Mine"" are all non-WWE created songs.

There's also an issue of the live musical acts that have performed at WrestleMania over the years. Like Run DMC, Motorhead, Saliva, Drowning Pool, Ashanti, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Reba McIntyre, Little Richard, Gladys Knight, Salt N Pepa, Boyz 2 Men, Willie Nelson, Robert Goulet and Limp Bizkit. Some of them there probably won't be a problem, but I noticed on the previous dvd release of Mania 19 they edited out Ashanti's performance and on the coliseum release of Mania 11 they edited out Salt N Pepa's performance. Although like I mentioned earlier I can't see there being much of a problem with Motorhead. Just something else to look for.",1130371200,7,4585,4.711610486891386

Vince`s company releases all 21 Wrestlemanias in their entirety, wrong. Read the other reviews and decide for yourself.

If you really want the shows in their original releases without commentators edited out as well as logos blurred and music changed or deleted then Coliseum Video is the only way to get them.

2417233,3,B000BH2WF8,"The reason ""World Wrestling Federation"" is ok, but the initials ""WWF"" are not, is because the Fund sued over the Federation illegally using the initials to market and promote the product, not the full-blown name.  The ""Attitude Scratch"" logo violated a pre-existing agreement between the two companies which is why that logo must be distorted, because it was used in violation of the agreement, so any further use would still be in violation.

Jesse is gonna be a big question.  It's WrestleMania, so I'd like to think that they'd at least pay him off for use on this huge release, if for nothing else.  It's a damn shame, since they had to take him off of the ""Greatest Stars of the '80s"" DVD (i.e. JYD vs. Randy Savage from the Wrestling Classic PPV--notice the long, drawn-out silent spots in commentary?  Yeah, there ya go~!), and they had to use the MSG Bobby Heenan vs. Ultimate Warrior ""Weasel Suit"" match, instead of the more widely popular match from Toronto.

It's a damn shame that so much editing will have to go into what would be an otherwise awesome set.  That means with the first 6 Manias, either they paid Jesse for the rights to use his voice, or they'll have some nobody like Todd Grisham or Coach work the voice-over.  Still, even then, any audible mention of ""WWF"" will have to be scratched, which, again, is a damn shame.  Too bad Vince didn't take this into serious consideration before changing the logo, AND promoting WWF (as WWF and not as the World Wrestling Federation like he did for a long time) in Europe again.

I have the Legacy VHS collection released back in '98, which has Jesse Ventura and all ""WWF"" references in tact which is pretty sweet.

If these shows were all sold as-is, with no editing, I would be more than willing to buy this set, even for the outrageous price.  However, considering the ""fixing"" that needs to be done, I don't know if it's really gonna be worth it.  Somebody, somewhere is going to buy it, that's a given.

That means on the more recent releases, we'll be stuck with the edited VHS versions of the events. Can World Wrestling Entertainment cheapjack their fans any more than they already have? The answer would be yes! And as far as the blurring, censoring and music changes involved in these events...it's outright moronic. If an event has already happened, it's a part of history and should rightly be released as is. No lawsuit should be able to stop the release of old ""WWF"" product, only inhibit the creation of new ""WWF"" licensed product. If Vincent Kennedy McMahon had any testicular fortitude whatsoever, he would stand up for the legions of loyal fans his company serves. Oh...yeah...that would imply he cared.",1129334400,8,1061,4.932960893854749

My assumptiion would be that the attitude era logos are blurred is because that was around the time the law suit heated up.

2417236,5,B000BH2WF8,"The difference between the 21 & 31 disk set is that here in the US there will be a 21 disk set released, featuring all 31 WrestleMania's, as well as a DVD-photo library of classic WrestleMania pictures and 4 limited edition wrestlemania pictures on film featuring i believe HHH, UnderTaker, Roddy Piper, Hogan, and maybe the Rock.  I don't know if every boxed set will have the same 4 pics.  The 31 disk set will be released in the UK, and the only reason that is on 31 disks is due to the format size of the UK PAL version disk dvd.  So if you live in the US you will be seeking the 21 disk set.  As far as special features or easter eggs, there will be very few if any.",1128902400,5,671,4.0606060606060606

I have noticed some skipping in a few of the DVDs, I'm hoping that it's just my old DVD player, but I am a little concerned. Finally, my collection did not come with the 4 collectible. I don't need the cards, but it would have been nice to have them. Other than that, I'm enjoying this collection a lot!",1458691200,,377,4.178082191780822
