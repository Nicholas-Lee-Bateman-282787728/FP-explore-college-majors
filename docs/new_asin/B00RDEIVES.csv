6928676,1,B00RDEIVES,"My 1/10 mangaupdates review of the original series of which this is a direct adaptation: This Slum King is well documented already and Bennett The Sage didn't even review the equally abhorred ova which is banned in australia/germany when he reviewed in for real so you know what to expect. The ANN score is also a delight. Just look at (my) categories and know that cannibalistic futanari rape (yes that is a sentence) is a thing and not the worst part of the manga. Dick slicing and then devouring, child rape and.. are in it too with no further meaning to back them up so this is basically gore porn only. The first few volumes were published as shonen so that is just lovely, the art is meh at best, the continuity and tone make no sense, the camoes are a disgrace and i hate these characters already so let's stop. One day a group will unleash the entire thing on the world but i had my fill a decade ago. Till then you will have to imagine the fire or RUN FOR YOUR LIFE/SANITY. Berserk reigns supreme on the other end of the spectrum and only his Dante Shinkyoku (8,5/10) and to a lesser degree Mugen Utamaro (7/10) should be read but both are also adaptations. Amon - Devilman Mokushiroku (6/10) is the only part of the Devilman(4/10) mythos i can give to other people without fearing a lawsuit btw. Fun fact: Sho Aikawa wrote the ova's for V.J. and the ones for Urotsukid'ji (0/10) too. He also wrote most of the first FMA anime so that puts it's misguided gecko ending in perspective doesn't it?",1424822400,2,1503,4.4296028880866425
6928677,1,B00RDEIVES,"I was expecting a ""Fist of the North Star"" experience, but instead ended up with lame anime rape porn. I can handle some fan fare, this though, straight full on intercourse. Probably one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen, seriously, this wasn't no brief sex scene like in ""Ninja Scroll"" or anything, but an actual too uncomfortable to watch had to turn it off type ish.",1447459200,,380,4.602941176470588

6928680,2,B00RDEIVES,"Violence Jack was a series that I was interested in as soon as I was aware of it. I'm a huge fan of Fist of the North Star, and this series sounds like it should be similar based off of the description I heard: Some guy goes around in a post-apocalyptic world and saves people from bad guys. That, along with the fact that Go Nagai is the creator, made me very excited to check this series out. However, as I was watching it I was overcome with the feeling of...boredom. That's not what I was expecting from a series like this at all and based off of what was happening on the screen, I really didn't feel like I should be bored.

I think the main issue here is with the cast of characters. None of them I found to be particularly likable. Jack is basically a much less memorable version of Kenshiro (the protagonist of Fist of the North Star) in my opinion. What made Ken so memorable were the techniques he used and that despite his quiet, silent demeanor you could still see that he cared for the people around him. Jack in these OVAs just goes around and rescues random people (and does a much poorer job of it than Ken). He does not have any sort of supporting characters that follow him throughout these OVAs either, which means he lacks any of he meaningful relationships that helped make Kenshiro an interesting character.

These series is also one of those that is violent for the sake of being violent. Certain series can get away with this because of how corny they are (MD Geist comes to mind), but Violence Jack is just too serious for it to work quite as well. In the second OVA there are two VERY graphic rape scenes. I'm not a guy that gets uncomfortable very easily, but I was very uncomfortable while watching the second OVA because of these scenes. I felt that these scenes were simply in there for the shock value as they really did not need to be shown for the plot to advance.

And this leads to the main issue I have with Violence Jack. Violence Jack is graphic just for the sake of being graphic. There is no real meaning behind why any of the graphic scenes are there other than to surprise the viewer. Series like Fist of the North Star might have graphic violence, but it has fun with the violence, which makes it entertaining--all of the violence is to show the struggle between good and evil. Meanwhile, in Violence Jack nameless and inconsequential children are killed and women are impaled with brooms because...why not? The series elicited no emotion from me because of this.

To end on a positive note, the second and third OVAs had very good animation, which is most of the reason why I'm giving this two stars. This is one of the very few anime I have ever watched that I have no desire to ever see again.",1431993600,7,2740,4.3772102161100195
6928681,4,B00RDEIVES,"Ive been waiting for these to be released stateside fully uncut for years and they are finally here,and remastered to boot. Only thing I don't understand is the back of the box claims these are in widescreen when they are really presented in full screen format,the strange thing also is the black bars on the left and right are permanently visible. I thought I had something wrong with my settings on my bluray player,bcus normally full screen films will be stretched horizontally automatically removing the black bars,but not the case with this,very strange.  Thats my only complaint tho really the image qaulity is fantastic,and these are fully uncut with all the contraversial scenes included,the way go nagai intended it to be.  Should be noted though also, there is mosaic censoring over ""ahem"" the female/male extremities,thats just something japan does and personally I think its kind of pointless but what are you gonna do.  Regardless a fantastic buy for oldschool anime heads,this anime is awesome",1430092800,7,1007,5.128048780487805
6928682,5,B00RDEIVES,"Im a sucker for these old school anime's that are over the top violent and slightly comical.  Love them. If you like the art style and action from Fist of the North Star, then you'll dig this one!",1428796800,6,196,4.157894736842105

6928685,4,B00RDEIVES,"Glad to have this on dvd, relatively uncut I guess... but not really sadly.  The deleted scenes show that this is cut/edited.  Plus the print is not the best 9warbles/shakes in spots, some artifacting).  Wish there would have been elements available for a blu-ray restoration as this is a great rated R ova post-apocalyptic anime classic and it's a shame this is all the fans will likely ever get.  Not many other special features besides the few deleted scenes that show us what a true uncut version could have given us.  Love this anime, not liking this release, but am happy to have it on some official format here in the U.S. i guess.",1426896000,2,638,4.56140350877193
6928686,4,B00RDEIVES,"After decades of trying to get this classic anime I finally have it, thanks to Eastern Star.

The problem is that it is CENSORED. This would immediately be a 1 star rating but they do include the only available uncensored footage from the HK release, as an extra (they also include the edited footage for a non adult version of the anime).  By HK release, I mean how it was released to the Hong Kong theaters and am not refering to a Hong Kong Silver (illegal copy).
Looking at the quality that Eastern Star/Diskotek puts out I'm guessing it took too much effort to have the mosaic cleaned off the scenes where it shows up.

So on who knows how many years when someone cleans away all the censoring that release will get the 5 stars... Not that Violence Jack merits 5 stars to begin with.
It is really really terrible. Story wise, this movie feels like something that was written as a power trip fantasy, by a bullied 12 year old. It is about a guy named after a jack knife, and he is violent. The title covers most of the script.

These OVAs are still a classic that are noteworthy to show new anime fans where the American fandom grew from and give an example of how anime has changed since the silver/golden age. For this use, it is potentially 5 stars just like other terrible movies like MD Geist and Fist of the North Star.
I should note that if you are a raging fan of ""baddest man alive"" anime, then you need this for your collection along with the 2 I just mentioned.

While the release is VERY nicely cleaned up, the production the original first OVA was really terrible quality wise, it is old and looks severely under funded, making it look even older. The later 2 improve on this as they are younger and look to have better funding. The dub.. laugh or cry, this is a classic dub that helped start the ""sub-only"" movement in American anime fans. It is almost as bad as the dub on Garzey's Wing.

If you do not care about classic anime and have any sort of taste when it comes to anime and movies.. DO NOT WATCH THIS.",1426291200,4,2028,4.309711286089239

8694993,3,B00RDEIVES,"I bought this because I heard it was horrible, and it is. but it's fairly entertaining to watch for the most part, but there are definitely better good/bad anime out there to look into,",1504569600,,185,4.470588235294118
8694994,2,B00RDEIVES,"Easily a forgettable anime. Grotesque violence, rape, and overall sociopathy all combined to create an anime that delivers nothing. Violence Jack is some kind of superhuman that doesn't do anything. He doesn't save the innocent, he doesn't even appear in 75% of the film and is just an excuse to show the bad guys get killed after they are done raping and using chainsaws on the innocents for 20 minutes. The first story is Mad Max, but not cool at all. The second story involves a young couple trying to escape an evil city. The third story didn't even make sense but for some reason, Jacks hand gets cut off and he becomes some kind of God? Weird and lame. Now I can admire violence when done even remotely right. Legend of the Overfiend and even Genocyber redeem themselves with a story, and some cool scenes. This has none of that. It's violence for shock value alone, no story, ugly drawing, did it even have music? no redeeming qualities. I only give it 2 stars because the DVD quality is good. Clear picture and sound, not that it will do you any favors.
To sum it up. I'm a big fan of Go Nagai's work but this is his baby wipe in your face. It is a terrible anime that delivers lame gore after 20 minutes of crap dialog with no story at all. Definetly one I would avoid if I were you as there is much better anime out there.",1495411200,,1332,4.3107569721115535

8694996,3,B00RDEIVES,"Great anime! ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR KID (18+ I'd say). I've been watching anime since I was 5 years old. Seen everything from Ghibli to Kite uncut, Toonami/adult swim and old Bandai. This is the most graphic anime I've ever seen. Literally shows the most deprived forms of humiliation, torture, disembodiment and rape even more violent that some hentais out there. I like how it shows Jack in a new era every episode. Lots of Actions the whole time. No happy endings though!",1478476800,2,470,4.7439024390243905

8694999,4,B00RDEIVES,"I have seen a lot of Go Nagai's work, Mazinger, Devilman, ect- but nothing prepared me for Violence Jack.  I understand pushing the envelope, but these OVA's more so sodomize you with the envelope.  This is one of those series after the end of the world, Mad Max, Fist of the North Star, and so on;  in this environment, what would you think the most important resource would be?  Food, water, shelter, guns?  Nope, the answer is graphic rape.  There is a ton of action and violence yes, but those rape scenes really caught me off guard; they're pretty brutal.  Overall it feels like the OVAs could have benefitted for having one more episode to explain what happened between Jack and the giant samurai.  If you are a Go Nagai fan, give it a watch.",1457568000,6,748,4.488888888888889
