8377417,2,B000NA270S,"On different wrestling websites the FIP series have gotten very good reviews so I have been excited to see them. The first one I saw was the usual suspect which was awful. It was slow moving, boring, and seemed a bit random. I think a big downside is they do very little talking and we don't have announcers explaining the heat or why they are battling. Some of the matches in both DVD's dragged on and the matches where very slow.

This DVD I was hoping it would be better. This was nearly the same no reason why guys where battling, which doesn't get me into the match as well as I could be. Also we only see about 50 people in the stands it seems dead during most of the matches.

The first 4 matches where awful, slow moving, boring, I couldn't wait till they where over. Grade D

The 3 way was somewhat entertaining; we saw some high spots and the matches had a decent pace to it. This wasn't by any means an amazing or great match but by far the best I have seen over 4 hours of FIP footage. Grade C+

Samoa Joe vs Azriel- Ok 2 big names, I am getting excited. This match teased me over and over. Every time it looked like the match was going to get going someone applied a chin lock for 2 minutes and just sat in the middle of the ring. Disappointing! Grade C

Jimmy Rave & Fast Eddie vs. Roderick Strong & Jerrelle Clark- I am seeing 4 people who are all very good wrestlers and can apply some high flying moves. Please don't tease me, let me see a great match! Please?!  Slow moving again most of the match it was Rave and Eddie beating on Clark. Suddenly Clark tags out and in within 5 seconds he is healed and ready to go at it. 30 seconds of flash at the end and its done. Grade D+

CM Punk vs Colt Cabana- I have seen them wrestle 25 times, many of those times in person. This match up is usually just a fantastic display of wrestling holds, high flying, hard hits and an action adventure ride. I don't know what happened in this match. They traded hold for hold, and then had 30 seconds off. Walking around and nothing happening, and while I almost lost interest and then we had a few run ins and it was over. Grade C

The FIP style seems to be mat based wrestling. However its chin lock for one minute and break. Then walk around the ring for a minute, then wrestle, then arm bar for a minute then break. Do these for 15 minutes then hit one or two quick moves and its over. That coupled with no explanations for the matches, and zero crowds really makes for a boring DVD. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.",1189728000,3,2525,4.149284253578732
