3596624,5,B001G5T6VW,"Good movie, okay acting. The acting was not perfect but the movie was pretty good, Matthew Reese is a good actor who has done some good stuff it was almost as if he was the only official seasoned actor there, the others tried though.",1406505600,,233,4.318181818181818
3596625,5,B001G5T6VW,My husband and I found this movie very moving. The realistic challenges that were faced and the way things were resolved. Great movie for my family!,1381968000,,148,4.730769230769231
3596626,5,B001G5T6VW,This DVD provides an excellent overview of biblical teaching regarding adoption and how Christians should and can be engaged in this ministry. The real-life stories and experiences add a compelling human dimension. We plan on using this as a resource to help others understand God's command to care for the orphan.,1373932800,,314,5.176470588235294
3596627,5,B001G5T6VW,love this movie family movie with great christian roots.  watched with daughter and she loved it ..if it is not for you ..I would give it a watch atleast once,1358726400,,158,4.266666666666667
3596628,5,B001G5T6VW,"This movie was so touching. We were very moved during the entire film. If the church in America could grasp the concepts put forth here, the Kingdom of God would be much advanced. Caring for widows and orphans as a mark of the true church of Jesus Christ was conveyed so clearly and beautifully. Praise the Lord for this message!",1334707200,2,329,4.5
3596629,5,B001G5T6VW,"This movie is a wonderful representation of why Christian families should adopt and by biblical standards. It contains some beautiful stories from various families on the process they went through and giving such wonderful advise and blessed encouragement.

A wonderful film for the whole family and a must watch to be sure!",1334707200,2,324,5.230769230769231
3596630,5,B001G5T6VW,"This movie touched and moved my families heart!  We've been trying to adopt for a few years and the testimonies from the families really spurred us on.  I laughed, I cried.  The body of Christ is beautiful!",1334620800,3,206,4.513513513513513
3596631,2,B001G5T6VW,"Based on the description I really, really wanted to like this movie. But as hard as I tried, I just couldn't. Too much of the one-on-one female conversation was even more shallow than what I would expect from coed BYU freshmen.
In addition to shallow characters, the script was just unbelievable at times and the direction was sorely acting.
In a few scenes each of the three central characters really shine, but the interaction between the two primary characters just defies belief at times. By the end of the movie I was doubting those characters could convincingly order a fast food meal.

Thankfully I rented the movie through a subscription service. Had I paid for this movie, I would have regretted the waste of money.",1313193600,,724,4.792
3596632,1,B001G5T6VW,"I am thankful I only paid a rental fee from a Latter-Day Saint Bookstore to watch this. The people who made this movie may have watched ""Castaway"", featuring Tom Hanks, and thought it would be a neat idea to mix spiritual and physical rescue from an island after a plane crash. It could have worked. So, LDS parents would venture in buying this type of movie, thinking the family would enjoy the message as well as the adventure. It takes more than clichs and actors to make a good movie. I would blame the screenwriter and director. There is hope for the actors. Jaci Twiss did a fine job in ""Turn Around"". So did Matthew Reese in ""Beauty and the Beast, a Latter-Day Tale"". Shea Potter acted well too. Watch ""Castaway"" or any good ""stranded-on-an-island"" movie. Watch ""On the Other Side of Heaven"" or other great LDS movies. In ""Rescued"", the script and editing are appalling. Five people are presumed dead in a plane crash, and their families back home are barely mentioned. The gossiping and jealous secretaries at the office get the spotlight. So much for the family movie! OK, you get the idea. ""Rescued"" is like a Betty Crocker packet pretending to be a chef's five-course dinner.",1239667200,2,1186,4.679425837320574
3596638,5,B001G5T6VW,"I loved the personal stories from each family, along with the reason for their conviction.",1455753600,3,90,5.066666666666666
3596639,5,B001G5T6VW,"Excellent. Moving, I thank God for leading me to this work.",1453075200,4,59,4.454545454545454
3596640,5,B001G5T6VW,This is a biblical inspiring and heart tugging message about how believing couples can choose to honor the Lord Jesus Christ and be blessed with a beautiful and loving family.,1446940800,2,175,4.866666666666666
3596641,5,B001G5T6VW,"I enjoyed watching this movie. GOD & LOVE, will always Rescue you if your Heart is ready and willing.",1444348800,2,101,4.368421052631579
3596642,4,B001G5T6VW,It was ok,1444262400,,9,2.3333333333333335
3596643,5,B001G5T6VW,Every family considering adoption should watch this.,1444176000,3,52,6.571428571428571
3596644,4,B001G5T6VW,"It is a very good documentary, well done.",1443484800,,41,4.25
3596645,5,B001G5T6VW,"Very interesting and informative.  It does seem like may of the rescued children came from overseas.  Why doesn't our country make it easier for people to adopt children who need a loving family right here in the USA?  Why does it cost so much money to adopt a child in the first place?  Many families would love to have a child, but can not come up with the huge amount of money to do so.",1441152000,3,389,4.1466666666666665
3596646,3,B001G5T6VW,"Was kinda Poorly scripted; But the Actors are Good- alot of Dialoge - Sitting, walking and Talking, Some of the acting was really Good",1431734400,,134,4.625

8304022,1,B001G5T6VW,"I am a woman who was adopted at a very young age. I have 2 siblings and 2 wonderful parents, a very happy family / story. This movie made me so sad. To see adoption framed as tool for ""spiritual warfare"" was so gross to me.  I was very disturbed by the way the children of color and children with disabilities are talked about in this movie. I think I could write so much on this documentary even the title ""Rescued"", as an adopted child my self makes me sick to my stomach. I fear sometimes the christian adoption movements rush to do good, forgetting the complexities that adopted children (particularly international and interracial adoptions) are faced with. Not a good film about adoption at best, racist at worst.",1486684800,2,719,4.573643410852713
8304023,4,B001G5T6VW,Very inspirational and touching. The statistical data on children needing a home is astounding! (and undoubtedly growing monthly). Quite an impactful documentary,1472947200,3,161,6.363636363636363
8304024,5,B001G5T6VW,Very good,1472947200,,9,4.0
8304025,4,B001G5T6VW,Very helpful.  Focused upon international adoption.  I would have appreciated information on domestic avenues as well.,1472428800,3,118,6.3125
8304026,5,B001G5T6VW,"Enjoyed very much, great information that really needs to be know. If we are calling ourselves children of God we should be seeking, trusting, and listening to the Lord.",1470787200,3,169,4.862068965517241
