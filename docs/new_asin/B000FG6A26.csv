2564357,3,B000FG6A26,"The DVD set itself is fine, except for one thing: No episode guide is included. Each DVD has the titles of the episodes printed on the face of the DVD itself, but nothing else is provided. So since I wanted an episode guide, I had to download one on the internet and print it. Of course it's letter size and won't fit inside the container with the DVDs. For me this omission by the manufacturer is an inconvenience. Considering the price of this DVD set, a small episode guide providing a brief summary of each episode should have been included.",1339459200,5,545,4.46

2564359,1,B000FG6A26,"I was so very disappointed with this purchase when upson receiving it, I got an error message on all of the DVD players I attempted to play it on.  Once I submitted a request to return, I was told about the different ""regions"" that DVDs are intended to be used in and how that would be on the DVD cover.  Well, this is the first time I have ever had to check out regions before making a purchase.  Why your company would send to a US resident a DVD that cannot be played in North America is very frustrating and seems to me a bit deceiving by your company.  Never before, when I have bought DVD's at Best Buy, Target or on line, have I been sent a DVD that could only be played on a foreign country device.  It appears to me this is a flaw in your ordering process.  So now, I have to fill out paperwork and pay for the shipping and handling and this company will determine if I get a refund.  This is a true inconvenience and has left me a very unsatisfied Amazon customer and this experience has not been one I would anyone I know to have.

I trusted Amazon to deliver a quality product and you have failed to do so.  I am very disappointed in the way this transaction has been handled.",1324339200,16,1188,4.108225108225108
2564360,1,B000FG6A26,"I ordered this DVD,  as I love the series. I noted it was sent from England---however, when we tried to watch it would not play .

2564362,5,B000FG6A26,"Does anyone know what the holdup is with this show?  Releasing a region-1 season every two years is unacceptable!  (At the time I write this review, Amazon hasn't even posted a release date yet.)

That said, the third season, like the first two, treats us to some excellent character moments.  Jack prepares to leave his team and put his family first; then his wife announces she wants a divorce.  Martin and Samantha's relationship moves forward, but not without conflict. Danny's brother Rafi makes a poignant reappearance, and Vivian learns she needs heart surgery.  Memorable cases include the disappearance of a nannny and the child she watches, the return of the Knowles brothers (first seen in Season Two's ""Doppelganger""), a two-parter that finds Sam working undercover, and the vanishing of a sci-fi fanatic who claims alien abduction.  Most riveting, though, is the cliffhanger finale, which ends in a shootout that critically wounds one of the team.  Unfortunately, we may have to wait another two years for the second part ...

Season Three's episodes were first aired 09/23/2004-05/19/2005.

2564392,2,B000FG6A26,"This American series started with a really good premise and thousands of cases to draw from, then it went like so many other American series go to gross sickeningly visual stories.  It seems that the producers feel unless a show has disgusting stories and gross visuals, the American public loses interest in the show.  For many Americans that is beyond what we are willing to sit through.  Right now the most popular TV series has stayed with their vision and kept the stories interesting and stayed away from gross visuals and they are still the number one TV series on.  After this series which I had to mark over half the episodes with a warning so I never watch them again I quit even trying to watch this series.  That is too bad because I really like the cast of characters.",1406332800,,781,4.51063829787234

I contacted the seller about the problem and it would cost me more than the original purchase price to straighten it out.

2564404,5,B000FG6A26,When viewed the first time some aspects that was not like that about the director and after viewing that particular episode for second time it became more clear what that episode was about. The parts that liked was parts that involved children and were ended on a good note. I have however had a episode in home town where children I knew case were a child was exploited and found dead buried on perpetrator's property. The things that one should consider when viewing these this season and others is not all of these episodes end of a happy note which in turn makes this show more credible because it is in line with the real world and not being fictitious when child is missing or exploited children. When comparing this series to another movies only one come to mind and that is I know my first name is Steven a great film on missing and exploited children.,1368230400,,860,4.484076433121019

You get all the eps on 6 different disks.  The labels on the disks have cast pictures and episode titles.  The episodes themselves are complete.  There are no extra features I could see.  And as one reviewer noted, no separate overall episode list.

There is cover art (the same as in the region 2 sets, as far as I could tell.)

I'm not a good judge of the quality of the recordings or the soundtrack - I found them acceptable for regular dvd on a smaller HDTV and a really poor sound system.",1348963200,,809,4.425675675675675

The gist is that this socialite is kidnapped by this guy whose sister was a big fan and because this is a Without a Trace episode, its not in a healthy way at all. I guess I would consider Without a Trace something of a blend between NCIS-CSI with a dash of Criminal Minds (although on this last point, I don't remember how gory WAT got).
