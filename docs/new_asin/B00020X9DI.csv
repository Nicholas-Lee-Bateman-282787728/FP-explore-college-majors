8020040,4,B00020X9DI,"Burnetts entry in this series is a great concept, but somehow lacks a little power in its execution.  In a docu-drama style he tells the story of an incident from his own youth (highly dramatized, I assume) where he is sent from Los Angeles  to visit an uncle in Mississippi who was an upstanding preacher to get some lessons in morality.  But on the way he is abducted by another wild living uncle determined that the boy see the other side of life -- sex, booze, and gritty blues music.

Within this framework, Burnett showcases a wide variety of delta blues musicians from the 1950s.  The music is sublime, but I found the family story aspect wore off on me.  I was anxious to get back to the music and its stories.  This isn't helped by the fact that the writing and acting of the family plot feels just a bit stiff, especially when compared with the loose and wildly alive music itself.  Not at all a bad film, but one that aimed at greatness and, for me, didn't quite get there.",1462233600,,984,4.368131868131868
8020041,1,B00020X9DI,"I'm not sure what this film is suppose to be. It's a jumbled mess of performance clips and staged acting; like a documentary in need of editing interspersed in a made for TV movie - or visa versa.

You'll be hard pressed to actually learn anything as to how and why the blues developed. Any historical information is presented randomly and in no real chronological order. As for the performance clips, I didn't see anything that I haven't seen in other films about the blues. The only thing that caught my attention was a voice over by W.C. Handy.

This disjointed film offered nothing new to the history and legacy of the blues. It doesn't bother me so much that I wasted my money on this film; it bothers me more that I wasted my time!",1316217600,3,737,4.411764705882353

Filmmaker Charles Burnett's contribution to the Scorsese/PBS blues series is brilliant and haunting. The history of the blues/blues artists is revealed through stunning documentary footage and the drama of a high-spirited uncle in Mississippi who sets out to inspire a young nephew visiting from Los Angeles. Burnett's embroidering of archival materials and a coming-of-age narrative is seamless, authentic, flawless!",1306627200,4,865,10.233766233766234
