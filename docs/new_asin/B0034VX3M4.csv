added on as surcharge when it arrived",1394064000,,124,4.208333333333333
8609580,1,B0034VX3M4,"Right case, right print on the DVD, wrong content!! Instead of ""Competitive Turns"" you learn about ""Positioning Techniques for Teaching Swimming"". Apart from my disappointment that tells you a lot about the way it is produced. (Oh, and there is no point in returning it because I ordered from overseas and transportation cost and custom fare exeeded allready all prospective refund...)",1353801600,,385,5.327868852459017
