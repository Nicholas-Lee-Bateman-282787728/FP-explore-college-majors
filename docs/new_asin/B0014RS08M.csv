8256173,5,B0014RS08M,"I don't know how many of us are even aware of how much negative dialogue that goes on in our own mind, on a daily basis. And when I say negative dialogue, I don't mean just those we direct to or at others but also those we engage within ourselves. We tend to put ourselves down more than others need to, and we don't lift ourselves up when we should. Sometimes, we may not even be aware of how destructive or negative we can be, or have become. And the sad thing is, we become a danger not only to ourselves, but to those around us in the process. These are just some of the many things I have learnt and started to reflect upon after watching ""Sayonara to Depression"" by Tsem Tulku Rinpoche. Tsem Tulku has the real talent to illucidate profound teachings with wit and humour in his own signature style. It is not only entertaining to watch him, but it is deeply engaging because he uses his ""humourous compassion"" to get to us. I have long abandoned all those so-called self-help and self-improvement books since I have stumbled upon Tsem Tulku Rinpoche's books, cds and dvds. I never found those self-help and self-improvement books really that beneficial in the real sense. They have only helped and improved the sales of the authors but not me. I guess, there are two ways of looking at it - you are either interested in gaining real freedom from your pains and suffering, or going easy on yourself with a superficial intellectual method that will only enrich the income of your shrinks. Liberation lies in the palms of our own hands, because happiness is only achieved through our own realisation, and not what our shrink tells us or the other so-called depression experts's perscription. So, if you truly believe in gaining your own freedom from all your negative or destructive emotions, then do sit down and watch this dvd all the way through. Your real happiness deserves it!",1257120000,3,1885,4.596439169139466
