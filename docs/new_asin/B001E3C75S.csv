8296245,4,B001E3C75S,"OMG!!! I love a bad movie but man, this one is awesomely bad.  I don't know what it is about baby-stepping ninjas, but Richard Harrison's movies always seem to be peppered with them.  God it's wierd.  I'd give this movie a monster 5 stars because it is so entertainingly bad but the video tape quality is absolutely horrendous.  Being unable to acquire this on DVD (its a tough flick to find), I had no choice.  Its obvious this particular tape was rented every week for a decade, or it sat in the back, sweaty storage of a southern Texas Blockbuster Video store.  Back to the movie... it runs fast.  It must be a 60 minute movie or this is just more proof at how entertaining it was.  I didn't walk away feeling as though a piece of my soul had been stripped away.  Lots of really good 'moments' in this one.
A note that Harrison was offered the role of 'the man with no name' by Sergio Leone but Harrison turned it down and pointed him toward Eastwood.  He later quipped that this was his greatest contribution to cinema.  This movie is certainly proof of that statement.  If you can find a copy of this movie buy it.  If its in good shape you can probably double your money by reselling it and use the funds on a couple of happy meals.",1420675200,,1238,4.2844827586206895
