It descripes a  friend that every man has.  That being the friend that always gets you into  things you really don't want to get into, but do anyway, because he is and  well it kinda looks fun.  I recomend this movie to men who enjoy a good  action flick that keeps them thinking.",962668800,2,417,4.243589743589744

You are riveted to the screen the entire movie as one of the most diverse and interesting cast of characters since ""Pulp Fiction"".  An  architect is visited by his past in the form of his ex-partner in crime.  Literaly.  His partner leaves something behind that brings an unbelievable  cast of visitors that defy description.

Ultraviolent, ultraclever--it makes me laugh when nothing else can.  The characters are great--from Casey the Architect Who Use-Ta be a Drug Dealer, his ex-buddy/ex-partner Nick who's still in the game, a pizza delivery rastamon, Nick's girl: nasty nasty Dallas (Paulina Porzikova in the role she was BORN to play), Billly Hill (or is it Hill Billy?) the serial killer, the hapless Wong family who happen to be in the wong place at the wong time--what else do you need with this pack of badasses?  Micky Rourke, of course--so he's here, too, chewing it up as usual.  What a perfect way to make a great impression on a social worker you're trying to impress so he'll give an okay to your adopting a baby, right?

989851,5,6305197784,"Is it bad that I like this movie because of the naked scene involving Paulina Porizkova? I digress. Anyway, this movie is quasi-Quentin Tarantino-ish. It has violence, it has humor, and it has humor in the violence and violence in the humor. Made in 1998, this movie seems like it could have been made in the present day. If you like hot chicks, if you like naked hot chicks, if you like dark comedy, and if you like violence, then this movie is for you. Set in the course of an entire day (hence the title of the movie), this movie is about the life of a former drug dealer (Thomas Jane), who for the past several years has been living the unsuspecting and innocent suburban life with this wife out in Texas. Everything seems to be going well when one morning while his wife is away at work his ex-partner in crime from Los Angeles (Aaron Eckhart), comes to drop off a suitcase ""just for a little while"". Reluctantly, Thomas Jane's character agrees to watch over the suitcase while his friend goes on a few ""errands"" for several hours. Tempted to find out what's inside the suitcase he opens it up and discovers thousands of dollars worth of cocaine. Panicked, he flushes it all down the sink. Over the course of the day Thomas has the misfortune of getting visits from some less than upstanding individuals. This is excluding of course Paulina (I think any man would love to have the ""misfortune"" of getting a visit from her), and the family psychologist who is interviewing Thomas to see if he is stable enough to adopt a kid (very funny scene!).

And even if you hate violence, I would watch it just for the Paulina scene ;)

989853,5,6305197784,"Review for Region 1 Director's Cut
Thursday is a great under the radar film that is a rare film (hence the price).  It is in letterbox and a barebones release.
synopsis and slight SPOILER ALERT:  It tells the story of a man whose past life as a drug dealer catches up with him one day....Thursday.  An old associate of his drops by at his house and leaves a briefcase and things go all downhill from there. He struggles with these happenings because he has cleaned up and is flying straight as an architect.

The movie was great.  I have to say when I first came across this move, I was hoping Micky Rourke would have a bigger role in it.  It didn't matter the movie was a big surprise. A little slow at first, but when it took off it didn't stop.  One of the best drug deal scenes I've ever seen.  They keeped it real I think no BS.  Casey Wells(Thomas Jane) is a guy just trying to put his past behind him, but forgets how he made it in life.  His Buddy Nick(Aaron Eckhart)brings him back and lets him never for get who you are, if you do your dead.",1383350400,2,715,3.816326530612245

Now this seller wants a 20% restocking fee for me to return this if I opened it and found out it was not the 87 minute version as listed plus the 3.99 shipping fee would be lost so I was duped but hope this will inform others as to the tactics of this seller!,1381536000,2,454,4.0

989922,3,6305197784,"This film lies somewhere between Guy Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino but it misses the mark on both.

Here's the scoop. Thomas Jane, a one time L.A. drug dealer and killer, has gone straight and is now living in Texas as a devoted husband/ architect. His old bud, Aaron Eckhart, shows up with a load of heroin and needs to use Jane's car to work a deal. Jane is furious and puts the H down the garbage disposal. Needless to say, that was not a cool thing to do. All manner of mayhem ensues.

Even in a wildly plotted movie such as this, the viewer needs to be able to suspend his disbelief. I just could't manage it. I didn't believe the set-up and various things that happened throughout just didn't work for me. This is a shame because there were some scenes that were outstanding and really kept me involved. I liked when Thomas Jane shed his good-guy skin and knew what he had to do to make it through this rough situation. I also liked Eckhart's character. But writer/director, Skip Woods, fell flat when trying to develop the relationship between Jane and his wife. He tried to do, in a few deft strokes, something that needed much more time. The visit by the Dr. sent to interview Jane as a possible adopting parent was also off the mark.

This took place on very few sets so they spent much of the budget on the actors and camera. This was acted well and had a slick sheen to it. For me, it failed at the script level. And when you see Woods' other projects you can note the wide swing in quality. This is by no means a bad watch. It just isn't up to snuff.",1342483200,,1563,4.273648648648648
990016,5,6305197784,"It begins as it means to go on; confused choices, about coffee and `blowing away' the hapless, innocent sales woman and subsequent, coffee-buying policeman. The story is about an aspiring architect, who is working, increasingly, away from his violent past. What transpires is the merging of his past with his present, with more violence at the centre of things. There is the famous (or it is infamous) rape scene, where the statuesque woman does the conquering. The experience is heightened by his attempted resistance to her obvious skills; he is tied to a chair and cannot resist, except in his mind. The underlying message is that of a marriage that is moving to the mundane. She laments that he is not the person she fell in love with; her boredom is compensated by her increasingly successful career. She has no idea about his `exciting, drug-selling, murdering past'; the basic irony. There is a scene before the rape, when a doctor is interviewing Casey about the possibility of adoption; the woman starts speaking pornographically about her attempted porn' acting experience. There is more violence but sometimes, violence works; certainly so in this film. Love is determined by the final scene between career-engrossed wife and a husband working hard to make good. The outcome? Watch the movie!",1306540800,,1303,5.065116279069767

There are several scenes where the words are not in sync with the film...(at least on my dvd)...This film of an ex-criminal who is trying to go straight, but whose past won`t let him is an old plot, but done here to some comic effect.....and some dumb direction, at times. (why doesn`t  Casey grab the gun when the rasta man is sleeping off his pot?). Mickey Rourke ( easily the best actor in this film).. makes a short, but Strong appearance as a rogue cop.

990024,5,6305197784,"this film has been in some sort of distribution limbo for a number of years now, and original editions of the dvd go for pretty high dollar.

what i purchased was the uncut, unrated version of the film, in a russian release, with russian packaging, and a really funny, crudely produced, half page guide to navigating the cyrillic menu, so one can view the dvd with an english soundtrack.  various other foreign releases seem to be periodically made available, in a variety of ""pal"" formats and languages, so make sure you know what you are buying.  since the film was originally in english, i would be surprised if any dvd released did not include the english version.

the movie itself is not for the faint of heart, or the critical of plausibility.  it is a tightly twisted rubber band, that is periodically loosed on the viewer.  low keyed, dryly humorous, almost stoic, periods of development are punctuated by mad vignettes; gunslinging romps through the secret history of the protagonist and his former partner in crime, and the reign of absurd violence that befalls their unwise reunion.  amid the flashbacks, introductions, twisted double crosses, and perverse bloody results, one with the stomach for it all will find absolute hilarity.

in what i believe has earned ""cult film"" status,  thomas jane,  aaron eckhart,  michael jeeter,  glenn plummer,  paulina porizkova,  james le gros,  and mickey rourke, all give great performances,  and we do not get to see enough of paula marshall, as the wife who has been left in the dark about her hubby's history.  gary dourdan makes a brief but intense appearance as a hardcore drug dealing gangster named ""ball peen"".

writer and director skip woods truly shows his brilliant lunacy in this violent, sometimes disturbing, comedy.

if you enjoy absurdist, blood driven humor, in a screenplay so off the wall, that its viewing cannot be wrung through the lens of standards of morality and decency, then buy this dvd now.

if you are not sure, find a way to see the movie first- you will probably not be disappointed.

unless you are a hardcore collector, forget about paying for an original printing.  the novelty of a cyrillic spine on your dvd shelf, and the silliness of walking through a dvd menu one cannot read are worth owning this disc.  and if you CAN read cyrillic, and understand russian, than it may be twice the fun!

i figure that goes for any other foreign release of ""thursday"" as well- just make sure your dvd player will accommodate the specified ""pal"" region format, assuming you do not have a region free player, or have not gone online to figure out how to make your current player region free.",1265241600,,2666,4.808791208791209

An amazingly eclectic mix of over-the-top characters and bizarrely entertaining situations, this day-in-the-life of a gunman trying to go straight proves to be a worthy addition to the series of films that attempts to mimic the genius of Tarantino's dark-humored masterpiece Pulp Fiction.

Nick (Aaron Eckhardt) stops by Casey's (Thomas Jane) house to catch up on old times. Casey was a former gunman for drug dealers who has since reformed, become an architect, married a successful businesswoman (Paula Marshall), and is now contemplating adopting a child. Nick, who still has ties to the gangster underworld, leaves a briefcase full of drugs at Casey's house while he borrows his car to run a few errands... a.k.a. unfinished business. Disgusted and angered by the introduction of drugs into his home, Casey flushes them all down the kitchen sink. That's when, one at a time, Nick's double-crossed accomplices, rapping Rastafarian drug messengers, and crooked cops all come a-knocking for the unsuspecting Casey, who is about to have one unbelievable Thursday.

The film opens with a hilarious sequence in a gas station in which Nick is looking for the best deal for a cup of coffee. After pondering which size cup to get, a fiasco breaks out with the cashier when he demands a free snackie cake and uses a $50 bill to pay. Resulting in comically brilliant bloodshed, the situation goes from bad to worse when a cop intervenes and is caught in the most unusual of circumstances. This opening segment establishes the perfect mood for the rest of the film, which never takes itself too seriously and includes outrageous characters that seem self-aware of their own existence in this nonsensical gangster flick.

The film is broken into segments based on various events and times during the course of one day. This effect is much like Pulp Fiction, which is a similarly given chapters, although Thursday doesn't mess with chronological order except for the occasional flashback. Also like Tarantino, music magnificently introduces each scene and each character. Oddly humorous creatures, such as the Jamaican hitman pizza delivery guy that raps over the phone and shares his hashish, and Paulina Porizkova's narcissistic Dallas, who attempts to rape Casey, add humor to each event regardless of how horrifying and unnerving some of the coincidences are. When Mickey Rourke's calmly spine-chilling crooked cop Kasarov is introduced, the careful staging and intricate setup is fully assembled, and Casey's sticky situation becomes even more daring and laudable.

Definitely a wannabe Pulp Fiction, with plenty of violence, witty dialogue and extremely creepy antagonists, Thursday does some things right, but other attempts at homage may be going just far enough as to suggest rip-off. A flashback sequence that shows Casey shooting up baddies and sporting a hairstyle that exactly matches John Travolta's do in Pulp Fiction is easily one step too far.

990187,5,6305197784,"Yes, there is an explanation as to why this movie sells on the secondary market for more than an ounce of many precious metals. Skip Woods (writer of Swordfish)penned a nice little story about a day (Thursday to be exact) in the life of a reformed thug, and how in this one day this new life he has created for himself comes crashing down around him. The storyline is unlike any other I have watched, definitely was an ideal concept in 1998 (this should've been a strong box office draw, and probably would have if done with a major studio and bigger names).  Without ruining the novelty of the story, this is worth the watch due to its high action, unexpected twists and turns and strong acting (high marks for Mickey Rourke--no one does ""slimeball"" quite as well).",1146182400,2,766,4.550724637681159

990190,5,6305197784,"I just happened to rent this movie several years ago and immediately fell in love.

  It's about this ex-drug dealer, Casey Wells, who is living the American dream as a ""happy little republican"" and one day an old friend stops by and his past catches up with him. As he is trying to juggle being and architect along with trying to qualify to adopt a baby with his new wife Christine, trouble just keeps knocking at his door.

  Casey's day just keeps getting worse and worse as he is held at gun point by a Jamaican drug dealer, raped by a sadistic intellect, and nearly sawed to pieces by a redneck hillbilly. On top of all that his best friend is running a muck in his borrowed BMW station wagon with the corrupt police asking Casey for answers. Not even his neighbors, the Wongs are safe.

  This movie is great. The characters are quirky and interesting and the story is humorous without being cheesy. It's the type of movie you can keep watching over and over just for the pure entertainment value. It was definitely a pleasant surprise when I rented it so long ago, not hearing anything about it before hand. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good violent movie with some laughs in the mix.",1138147200,5,1207,4.45

990254,5,6305197784,"I was gripped by thursday from start to finish. Thomas Jane is brilliant as Casey as is Aaron Eckhart as Nick. The script is excellent, mixing humour with classic 'tough guy' lines, such as;
(as Glenn Plummer has a gun under his chin) Plummer:""Know what happens if I pull this trigger""?, Casey:""You repaint my ceiling"". Casey's transformation from a tame 'house-husband' to a hardened criminal is brilliantly captured. At first it seems like mere anger but then you realise that he is capable of anything. Paulina Porizkova and James LeGros co-star as Nick's vengefull partners, who come looking for Nick and end up at Casey's house!
Overall I would say this - try to look past the violence and instead look at the script and the acting and you'll see a gripping and powerfull film. Also, when my friend broke his arm he kept saying to himself ""be like Casey. be like Casey"". If 'Thursday' had such a profound influence on him that he looked to the main character for reassurance when he was in EXTREME pain, then it much be worth watching.

990259,2,6305197784,"I'm not a huge post-modern Tarantino fan, and this debut from writer director Skip Woods kept me at a distance. I suppose that's the hip point but I kinda like a little more nourishment than drugs and guns and blood and sadism. However this tale of bad karma has some interesting things apart from the de rigueur gore and jump cuts and episodic times with titles and rock music and swearing. Located in Texas, after a prelude in a convenience store for the Tarantino homage which introduces the tone, the narrative is set at the house of Thomas Jane, a ""domesticated wolf"" former bad boy who has settled into suburbia and is visited by his still badboy brother, Aaron Eckhart. Eckhart is such an accomplished actor that it's a pity Woods doesn't use him more, though Jane himself has a likeable goofiness crossed with sexy charm. The setup joke is a bit TV (or filmed theatre) where someone finally has the house to themself when - but it's the exhaustion factor that wears me down (as with The Master) as if we have to be wowed again and again, with no faith in the traditional plot structure where climaxes are minimal and paced. Woods plays around with time, with memory and anecdotal flashbacks, with differing success. One flashback shot in black and white leads nowhere but the continuation in colour has a double payoff, with alternate versions of the same incident to demonstrate shifted blame. Jane has a memory of his girlfriend, where she morphs into her modern counterpart then disappears after his line ""I don't want to lose you"". Woods also uses a cow motif as a running gag, doorhole POV's, and provides a funny edit concerning a silver suitcase. His screenplay uses grunge expressions like ""on the rag"" and ""86"", a funny line in ""Rod Serling's gonna step out of that fridge any second"", and although Eckhart is seen with Paulina Porizkova (in a career altering role!) and tells us he is to be married, he is given suggestions of being gay wearing nail polish and asking Jane about a specific act. As the third member of Eckhart's group, James Le Gros' lines are mostly unintelligible, tragically that great comic Michael Jeter has practically nothing to work with, but Mickey Rourke appears late to stunning effect. His deeper voice is a surprise, but the biggest mystery is what has become of his face. Maybe Rourke should try for the Montgomery Clift story, just not directed by Woods.",996105600,2,2403,4.737470167064439
