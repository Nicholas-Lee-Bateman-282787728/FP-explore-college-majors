3005021,1,B000XQCXZQ,"Unfortunately this is the only retail version of the film, the image quality is poor, significantly grainy. I don't recommend to buy the product.
Purtroppo il film  reperibile in commercio solo in questo dvd, ma la qualit della trasposizione video  scandalosamente bassa, il video risulta molto sgranato, tanto da non riconoscere i volti degli attori! Visto il prezzo forse conviene aspettare che qualche distributore americano pubblichi l'opera. Acquisto sconsigliato",1358294400,5,468,5.768115942028985
3005022,4,B000XQCXZQ,"It's a shame that we've had to depend on another country to provide this movie; seeing that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his roll.  In any case this move was worth the expense.  The story of Louis Pasteur should be known by all of us and our children.  This man was an important, possibly pivotal indiviual in the health of all humans.  The film is an excellent tale of tenacity and triumph, the rewards of which have been given to all mankind.  I received the movie in fine condition and it played on my DVD player without an error.",1351036800,7,536,4.32
3005023,5,B000XQCXZQ,"U will not find a more delightful recounting of the struggles the chemist Louis Pasteur endured in France from his colleagues(& even his emperor)than this black-n-white classic. We have all heard of the ""pasteurization process"" whether u drink milk, wine or beer. However, not until I saw this movie did I realize how much more this genius gave to the world. He lived thru the time of the French Revolution in transition from Emperor to a Republic,however,I somehow doubt Mr. Pasteur barely noticed the changes in his own country. Constantly hounded for not being a doctor(m.d.),I believe that it was his strong chemical knowledge that enabled him to become completely absorbed in the long tedious exhausting hrs of trials in finding cures. He starts his controversy by building on a theory of germs he heard & develops current sterilization processes(still used today)to stop the #1 leading cause of death of women of his time, namely ""Child Bed Fever."" He continues on to find a cure for Anthrax (sound familiar in the crazy times we live in?), Rabies, Syphilis... At least before his death he was recognized even by his enemies for his great contributions to science. Told with humor & serious at the same time, I think everyone should see this film at least once! It is very inspiring. Wish this guy was around to work on a vaccine for AIDS & cancer.",1334966400,14,1354,4.815450643776824
3005024,5,B000XQCXZQ,"The History of Louis Pasteur should be in every school
in America.  Paul Muni in the title role is magnificent,
and one really gets a good sense, of a scientist
committed to truth.  I tried it with my
kids and they loved it.",1322697600,9,224,4.186046511627907
3005025,3,B000XQCXZQ,One would think the movie is in the french language but it is also in English. This is truly Hollywood entertainment at its finest based on Hollywood science. There is the Pasteur treatment for rabies whether or not the movie has any scientific merit who cares it was a fun movie to relax to and a movie you can watch with the whole family.,1316131200,,340,4.328125
3005026,5,B000XQCXZQ,"This a classic movie. Excellent depiction of the difficulties that Louis Pasteur had in the process of introducing ""germ"" theory to the surgeons of that time in France!",1288483200,2,168,5.035714285714286
3005027,5,B000XQCXZQ,"Do not be frightened by the Portuguese language on the DVD cover. It is in English with subtitles if needed.
This black and white film is useful for allied health classes studying the history of infectious disease. You know how ""British English"" films are often difficult to understand because they speak so rapidly? That's not the case here. The plot, action, and language are easy to follow. Besides, it's an interesting movie that I would watch for its entertainment value! If you like great old B&W, this is perfect viewing.",1285286400,32,528,4.877777777777778
3005028,5,B000XQCXZQ,"This film is about the life of the brilliant chemist Louis Pasteur who  discovered cures for hydrophobia (rabies),  as well as the pox and germ theory. His brilliance and courage search for the truth and cures for diseases helped improve the lives of many people.

I thought the film was surprisingly well acted, and Louis was a brilliant man.  I would've liked to have learned more about his life and remarkable and ground breaking discoveries.",1253836800,12,445,4.8933333333333335
3005029,5,B000XQCXZQ,"This is the tremendous story of a great man and his quest to know the cause and cure of several diseases. The story vividly demonstrates the conflict between those who have knowledge with understanding and those who hold onto the prevailing ""scientific""/medical dogma.
The quality of this DVD was very good also.",1238025600,21,312,5.019230769230769

8229195,5,B000XQCXZQ,"Our librarian ordered a copy of this movie from Amazon several years ago.  I have shown it to a number of high school biology classes and I found that the students enjoyed it.  Paul Muni did an excellent performance depicting the life of Pasteur.  This story is very entertaining as well.  I would highly recommend this DVD.  We also meet the great scientist, Dr. Joseph Lister, from England who is played by another very engaging character actor Halliwell Hobbes.  In fact there are a number of very good character actors in this movie that make the movie very interesting.  The reproduction was excellent.",1521763200,,607,4.834951456310679

8229199,5,B000XQCXZQ,"I purchased this film for my 8 year old grandchildren and they love it.  Created in the days when a film could tell a simple story, 1936, with a few dramatic embellishments, it has a balance of historical fact and drama.  By today's standards it might be considered a ""docudrama.""  The film shows Pasteur as a simple but devoted family man, a dedicated scientist with a deep desire to help humanity root out diseases.  His almost childish curiosity will appeal to young, dare I say it, budding scientists.  There is honesty, clarity of purpose, and a few tear-jerking moments when a mother brings her sick child to Dr. Pasteur.  The film is suitable for viewing in classrooms although students must be warned that it is black and white, contains no special effects and is a simple but well-told story.  If I was teaching Middle School science, I would create an entire week-long unit on microbes and famous scientists based on this film.",1398124800,,937,4.746913580246914

8229202,5,B000XQCXZQ,I had shown this film to my 7th grade Biology classes many times and enjoyed seeing it again after all these years,1373068800,3,114,4.2272727272727275
8229203,5,B000XQCXZQ,"I have been searching for this DVD ""forever"".  I was so happy when i found it on Amazon!  Great for school age children too.  Grandchildren love to watch the movie about why it is necessary to wash hands, origin of  discovery of dangers of germs.  Very fascinating and true DVD.  I love it...added to my collection of non-fiction moves and documentaries.",1371513600,7,354,4.721311475409836
8229204,5,B000XQCXZQ,Great representation of how the process of science works.  I use it in my seventh grade life science class.  The students quickly get over the black and white and are asking to see the end of the movie.,1361145600,3,202,4.2894736842105265
