8431446,5,B004IZKKQC,"This 2-disc volume of Patsy's free motion quilting designs offers 4 hours of instruction covering another great group of design families. Here you will find ""Circling the Element,"" ""Rotating Axis,"" ""Loosey-Goosey,"" ""McTavishing,"" and more. Many of the designs in this DVD give the impression of a pantograph, but there is no marking of fabric involved.  All of these designs are downloadable free on Patsy's website, but as I have said before, they look much better when actually stitched out on fabric than when you just see them drawn out on paper.
In this volume Patsy also covers how to quilt a large quilt on a home sewing machine, what you need to know about thread, and how to decide what to quilt where.
Patsy's teaching is clear and concise, and presented with a little humor. I really like the designs in this DVD, and with a little practice they come out looking very nice.",1339200000,3,884,4.740259740259741
