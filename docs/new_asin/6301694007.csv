344552,5,6301694007,"The previous reviewer had it right--this is a ""traditional"" Fledermaus for lovers of Strauss and Vienna.  The production brims over with comic high spirits, while Carlos Kleiber's sensuous, echt-Viennese musical idiom makes you forget that the theater and orchestra are not Austrian but German.  The mostly Austrian male and mostly British, and very attractive, female principals are outstanding singers and comic actors.  Tenor Eberhard Wachter, late in his career, creates a vain, blustering, but always lovable Herr von Eisenstein, the wayward husband of classic comedy.  The hilarious jailhouse third act with its tipsy guard and warden likewise feeds on central European ways of making jokes.  The sound is full-bodied and detailed, but the video has a slight yellowish hue, much less pronounced than in the old laserdisc version.  Fledermice can't go far wrong with this DVD.

The competing Glyndebourne production on Opus Arte DVD is a different creature, a sumptuously trendy, sarcastic (and later, with sharper digital video) production.  It has a dark, post-modern ideological agenda, familiar and superfluous.  The libretto has been rewritten--in English, then translated back into German and re-translated into English sub-/supertitles!) to highlight social hypocrisy and women's oppression by--but you know the rest.  Strauss and his librettists knew and described all of this perfectly well too but they managed OK without the pretentiousness and penis jokes.  Glyndebourne's Fledermaus is impressive musically and technically, but its spiritual sourness may leave devoted operetta fans feeling a bit used.",1110931200,37,1620,5.708333333333333
344553,5,6301694007,"This version of Die Fledermaus, is an all-round excellent performance. I have a personal interest in the operetta: it was composed in the house in Vienna where my father grew up in, and which is now owned by my cousin. The conductor, Carlos Kleiber, who passed away in July 2004, was little known, but he showed he could lead in an interpretation of the operetta in the spirit that it was written in. The persons on the stage had the fortunate combination to be both excellent singers and excellent actors. The production, by Otto Schenk, is the same that has been used at the Wiener Staatsoper and the Metropolitan Opera. There is one small drawback: the beginning of Act III has a few spoken lines by the jailer, Frosch, which are comments on what was happening at the location and time this DVD was recorded: live on 31 December 1986 in the Munich Nationaltheater. Aside from this minor point, I highly recommend this DVD especially if one has not seen Die Fledermaus before; if another version has been seen then this is an excellent version to compare it to.",1110067200,19,1063,4.62962962962963

Imagine exceptional acting with that singing, and you have this--the very best performance of Die Fledermaus.
  The sets, costumes, and staging are also just right.  You will feel that you're right there, at a Viennese grand ball, surrounded by beautiful people, enchanting music, and having a rollicking good time!

344555,5,6301694007,"This is a first rate Die Fledermaus!
I watched this DVD last nite for the first time and what a pleasant surprise. Right from the opening chords of the overture you could tell that the conductor Carlos Kleiber obviously loved this work, and the orchestra responded in kind to his caressful approach(see some video of him in the latter part of the opera) to conducting this piece.
The opera takes place at the Bavarian State Opera Ballet and is performed before a live audience that was in a very receptive and appreciative mood.
The video director was Brian Large. Superb! Really, you can have the best singers, orchestra and sets but if the camera angles and switching isn't done properly then the final product can be very mediocre. No worry here.
The singing is stellar: with Eberhard Wachter (Gabriel von Eisenstein), Pamela Coburn (Rosalinde) and Janet Perry (Adele) in the leading roles. The acting is good: light hearted, honest and the overall production is really very funny, without seemingly to have to try to be funny.  The cast genuinely seemed to be having a great time on stage and responded enthusiastically to the audience's appreciative applause.
And then.... there were the costumes(especially the ladies) and the sets: Absolutely gorgeous, sumptuous. Perfectly fitting for the setting that this work was written for.
I would have no hesitation in recommending this wonderful, funny opera to anyone. You will love this ""Fledermaus""",1037059200,30,1450,5.066945606694561

344557,5,6301694007,"I read Amazon.com's review of this and wondered if this was the version I had seen.  The editorial review mentions that this DVD doesn't have the star quality of the competing Covent Garden version with Joan Sutherland.  This version's cover, when enlarged reveals the name Brigitte Fassbender along with this version being conducted by Carlos Kleiber: Operatic stars enough for me.
Herr Kleiber has done some wonderful operas, of which this is one.  The comedy of this work is well portrayed. The costumes are wonderful.
If this work doesn't have the name recognition of the Covent Garden version (from a true Royal Opera fan), it deserves to be as well known.",1011916800,12,661,4.936936936936937
344558,5,6301694007,"I am rather picky about Fledermice.  I may be a redneck from south Arkinsaw, but I also lived in Germany for 8 years and was married to a Sudeten German whose grandparents grew up in Strauss's Austria.  We listened to comedy records in Viennese dialect, and saw and heard many performances of ""Die Fledermaus,"" our favorite German-language work.  This is the best version I have seen in viewable form, and musically is second only to the 1971 recording on Angel/EMI CD (also an Otto Schenk production) sung by Gedda, Rothenberger, Holm, Fassbaender, Dallapozza, Fischer-Dieskau, and Berry with the Vienna State Opera Choir and Vienna Symphony under Boskovsky.
A German reviewer said this DVD was a typical Otto Schenk production where the players, especially the men, all act like little Schenks.  Schenk's influence is indeed obvious, but I like it, especially compared to the overly decorated and cameoed Fledermaus ""galas"" that stink up English-language holiday TV.  At least Schenk is from Vienna.
The sets and costumes are perfect, but the marvelous performances of the principals and the incomparable music in a top-notch execution Kleiber evokes from an orchestra who grew up on Strauss would have me enjoying this almost as much if everyone were on a basketball court wearing jeans.  My one regret is that Fassbaender did not duplicate her powerful and velvety singing of 1971 that made her the Orlofsky of choice ever since.  Of course, the CD came from studio conditions, and this DVD is of a live performance before an audience (on New Year's Eve, as with many Fledermice, no doubt lubricated with the usual quaffs of champagne before, during, and certainly after the performance). Still, 15 years and not having to try as hard probably made a difference.  Orlofsky is supposed to be bored, but Fassbaender looks bored, too.  Still, she is great, just not as great as she once was.  Being not as great as one once was is something I understand well.
Even picky German reviewers say that Perry and Coburn do okay with Viennese dialects, and I can vouch for this in agreement with the Munich audience's enthusiasm for these Americans.  If the other principals weren't so competent, I would say that Perry steals the show, but her Adele is really the plum role.  Well, it's the plum IF the performer is good enough, and Perry is more than good enough.  She has not only the voice and fresh beauty, but also the frisky energetic vivacity to make her the definitive Adele in my mind.  Coburn does Rosalinde (Blaue Eiche?  Gelbe Buche?) as well as it can be done, and Wa""chter is as good an Eisenstein as I have seen.  Alfred by Josef Hopferwieser, Falke by Wolfgang Brendel, and Frank by Benno Kusche are all quite competent, but the guys on the CD were better.  The ridiculous stuttering lawyer Dr. Blind is a role Ferry Gruber deservedly owns.  Another fine job was Ida by Irene Steinbeisser (Rock-biter), who has probably been teased about her surname enough already, so I will just say she could probably do well with Adele's role if Perry weren't around.  Schenk probably thought he was a bit old to play Frosch (as on the CD), but I thought Muxneder did fine.  I hate to disagree with a ""top-ten"" reviewer, but it wouldn't be ""Die Fledermaus"" without his hung-over morning-after scene (including a cheap shot of tearing ""31. Dezember"" off the calendar to reveal ""32. Dezember"" hahahahaha).  (...)
Technically, DG did its usual minimalist job.  The choices for menu languages are English and (...) CHINESE!  The English subtitle translations are quaint and awkward in places, maybe what might have come from a studious 19th-century German schoolmarm who had lived in England for a while.  To be fair, some of this is almost untranslatable.  English gave up the familiar ""thou"" form of address centuries ago, but not German, so how do you translate a whole song and scene devoted to ceremonializing about it?  How about Perry's pun on migraine vs. margarine?  The German spellings are the same as English, but pronounciation is much more alike (both G's are hard).  (...)
Some reviewers don't find authenticity important, but the more you know about ""Die Fledermaus"" and Strauss's Vienna, the more you will like this version.  Sure, the misery and poverty behind the glitzy uppercrust don't show, but at least the servant Adele gets her way with everybody.  This is a great Fledermaus for the 21st century, and I bet Strauss himself in 19th-century Vienna would have also approved.",1006560000,62,4491,4.909933774834437
344559,5,6301694007,"This is an outstanding production with Carlos Kleiber's direction providing an important part of the overall excellence. The other reviewers have dealt with this but I just need to add that the female leads, Rosalinde(Pamela Coburn) and Adele (Janet Perry) are superb both vocally and in their comic acting. The only problem I have is that the VHS tape is recorded at a very high level and some distortion results. Hopefully, this is remedied in the DVD version. I am prompted to write this review to present an alternative way of looking at Act 3 which is the morning after a New Year's Eve Party. Frosch (Franz Muxeneder), the jailer, is a drunk and the beginning of Act 3 features his drunken monologue which I find the funniest part of the opera. Opinions obviously vary on this Act 3, but it is a traditional part of Fledermaus, and I think most viewers will find this excellent comedy, consistent with what has gone before.  I complained about the sound on the VHS tape, but the DVD sound quality is quite good.",998352000,6,1017,4.65
344560,5,6301694007,"This an excellent performance (in German) of Fledermaus conducted by Carlos Kleiber, a superb conductor who simply has not recorded that much.  Kleiber nicely catches the fun in this Otto Schenk production, with a very nicely played score and excellent singers throughout. This is pretty much of a straight run through of the operetta, with no extended ""gala"" sequence in Act II (just a ballet very well done to the ""Thunder and Lightning Polka"").  The sets and costumes are excellent, the performance very well recorded, and subtitles (including both the original German and English) are available.  The only downside of the DVD is the longish bit of spoken comedy (maybe 10 minutes but seems an hour) of the drunken jailer in Act III, a standard of Fledermaus productions.  I preferred it to the English lnaguage/Joan Sutherland Gala also on DVD in terms of overall performance.",996710400,5,880,5.048275862068966
344561,5,6301694007,"Asked to give the three greatest operettas, no two from the same country, I would have to name ""The Mikado,"" ""Orpheus in the Underworld,"" and the one just released on Deutsche Grammophon DVD, <Die Fledermaus> (073 007-9). Unlike the overblown ""gala"" version with Te Kanawa, this 1988 production, long available on VHS, pretty much sticks to what the librettist gave Strauss, and everyone in the cast and audience seems to be having a wonderful time without losing respect for the original.
  Eberhard Wachter is a personable Eisenstein, showing unexpected comic flair, as does Brigitte Fassbaender as a perfect Prince Orlofksy and Joseph Hopferwieser as Alfred, the seedy tenor. You could not hope for a prettier Adele than Janet Perry, while Pamela Coburn copes easily with the coloratura and dramatic if somewhat shallow side of Rosalinde. In short, I find this a wonderful cast both comically and vocally.
  Carlos Kleiber conducts the Bayerischen Staatsoper forces with tender loving care, although the camera lingers far too long on him during the ""Brotherhood"" number in Act II. The Ballet is so well done that after long, long applause, Orlofsky's next words, ""Enough, enough,"" get almost as long a laugh. It all leaves the viewer nearly as breathless as the cast.
  Of course there is always that horrible Act III in which whatever is supposed to be funny about a drunk is made even less funny by two of them; and one longs for some music after several jokes that an non-local audience simply does not get.
  The DVD is set at the 4:3 screen ratio with a running time of 155 minutes and subtitles in English, French, and Chinese--and in the original German, which I think should be standard for all opera DVDs. As with all DVDs, no libretto but a good synopsis is provided. This is a real Grabbit.",994118400,15,1805,4.856677524429967
344642,4,6301694007,"I don't know whether it is the bottle of Prosecco I drank while watching this production of ""Die Fledermaus"", but I enjoyed it immensely.

No, it cannot compare to being at the Wiener Staatsoper in 1975, in my downstairs Stehplatz, and actually participating in the fun (with famous guest artists in the second act), but spending a New Year's eve in the company of Carlos Kleiber and the Bavarian Staatsoper and orchestra certainly is the next best thing.

Strauss's music is, of course, superb; the settings are delightful (the depressingly bourgeois home of the Eisensteins, the glittering elegance of Orlovsky's palazzo--the revolving stage allowed us to stroll along with the guests into the dining salon); and the dingy jail. The jokes (of Eisenstein and the Governor of the Prison pretending to be French; and Frosch, the jailer, and his Slivowitz and the hat that he can't quite hang on the peg) are as funny as ever (and even funnier enjoying a bottle of bubbly along with the acotrs).

My only quibble with this DVD, which I bought some years ago, so it probably has been fixed, has to do with some of the technical aspects. I decided to watch with the German subtitles so that I could follow along with the singing. This was fine, as long as everyone was actually singing, but as soon as the dialogue came on [at a much lower volume], off went the subtitles.  I finally concluded that the producers of the DVD assumed that anyone who wanted the German subtitles would not need them for the dialogue, since it was their own language. This, however, as those of us who watch Shakespeare or Masterpiece Theatre will know, is not true. I found it annoying to have to turn up the volume to understand the dialogue.  Then, when I decided to switch on the English, which accompanied the dialogue, I discovered that there was no mechanism to go to a particular scene, or to fast forward. I had to begin again at the beginning.

But then, I poured another glass of prosecco, decided it didn't matter in the least, and went to directly to act two and enjoyed the rest of the opera. A perfect way to spend New Year's Eve.

Happy New Year, everybody!",1357084800,6,2148,4.636842105263158

344646,5,6301694007,"Although purely speculative & presumptuous, my guess is that Johann Strauss would have loved this production.
Carlos Kleiber and his orchestra were spectacular.
All principals were more than excellent. Eberhard Wachter IS Eisenstein. Janet Perry IS a wonderful Adele. Pamela Coburn likewise portrays Rosalinde more than well. Wolfgang Brendel (Dr. Falke), Ferry Gruber (Dr. Blind--could there be another?), Joseph Hopferweiser (Alfred) sang and emoted gleefully. Benno Kusche (Frank) displayed great acting and physical skills. Franz Muxeneder (Frosch) IS the perfect jailer. And Brigitte Fassbaender (Prince Orlofsky) Is appropriately twinkly-eyed & bored. Minor singers and chorus are also excellent
Sets & costumes, lighting, stage directions and cinematography all sparkled.
Loved the finale of Act II - sparkly, bubbly and the snake dance & domino-effect a stroke of genius and great fun. Unlike other reviewers, I think the spoken drunken banter of Kusche & Muxeneder at the beginning of Act III is fun and more than fitting for this joyful Viennese operetta!
Although not blu-ray nor 16:9 aspect visuals were more than adequate. The sound was very good.
Looking forward to playing this production many, many times- hopefully accompanied with a bottle of good Champagne next time!

344647,5,6301694007,"Great sound, sterling performances all around, done in echt-sounding Viennese accents and dialect (e.g. ""Sofe"" for ""Dienstmaedchen""). Though there are no cuts, there is no extended gala performance in Act II as is semi-traditional, but that just leaves the length, 137 minutes, more manageable for an evening at the operetta. One standout is Windgassen, a big burly Heldentenor who would look at home in a wresting arena, cast contrary to type as the world-weary, effete Prince Orlofsky, a role usually played by a woman. The Vienna Philharmonic's performance under Karl Boehm is spirited and lively without overwhelming the performers, and director Otto Schenk does double duty in the non-singing role of the seriously drunken jailer Frosch.

344651,5,6301694007,"Carlos Kleiber (1930-2004) was often considered the most enigmatic conductor of the post World War II era.  The son of noted conductor Erich Kleiber (1891-1956), Carlos never leaned on his father's reputation for fame, but made his own way.  Carlos Kleiber disliked the recording process and made very few recordings for commerical labels:  Beethoven Symphonies 5 and 7 (DG, Vienna Philhamormonic);  Brahms Symphony 4 (DG, Vienna Philharmonic);  Schubert Symphonies 3 + 8 (DG, Vienna Philharmonic);  Verdi: La Traviata, with Placido Domingo and Ileana Cotrubas (DG, Bavarian State opera);  Wagner: Tristan und Isolde (DG, Dresden State Opera);  Weber: Der Freischutz (DG, Dresden opera);  Strauss: Die Fledermaus (DG, 1975 - different singers than this recording, but with the same orchestra).  Most of Kleiber's other recordings are from live concerts on CD or DVD format.  There may be as many or more Kleiber recordings on DVD, as in CD medium.

That said, it is nice to have any new Carlos Kleiber recording, and this one is no exception.  You can tell from the first bars Kleiber dearly loved this music, and has orchestra and soloists on their toes every measure.  The Overture sizzles and crackles, and sparkles with joy and life.  The singers are all excellent, although I must confess a reservation about Eberhard Waechter, who here is an excellent comic actor, yet his voice wobbles in sustained passages, and he sounds frantic and strained at times.  Pamela Coburn, Janet Perry, Wolfgang Brendel, Franz Muxeneder, Benno Kusche, and Brigitte Fassbaender are all excellent in every way.

I really enjoyed this as a video, especially the Act II Party scene, where the music and flow are very engaging.  Brigitte Fassbaender takes a little getting used to as Prince Orlofsky, in this production a trouser role like Cherubino in Mozart's ""The Marriage of Figaro.""  But her singng and acting are so fine, I enjoy it thoroughly with repeated view/listenings.

From this DVD, it's easy to see why Johann (II) Strauss's ""Die Fledermaus"" is his most famous and often performed opera.  Like

Rossini's ""The Barber of Seville,"" Mozart's ""Marriage of Figaro"" or ""Cosi fan tutte"" it is an everflowing spring of melody, beauty, comedy, and love in a healthy sense of the word.

For audio only ""Fledermaus"" recordings, I like Carlos Kleiber's 1975 studio recording, with Bernd Weikl, and Hermann Prey (DG, Bavarian State Opera); and Karl Bohm's 1971 Decca recording with Eberhard Wachter in the same role as this DVD, + a stellar cast of Austrian and German singers in the other roles.  Bohm may be hard to find in the US, and have to be imported from England, for those interested, but it is 2-for-1 price and well worth the effort.",1129334400,22,2728,5.051454138702461

A fine spirited stage performance. Although I sometimes wished for a little more elegance, this production realised the cheerful vulgarity of the story.

The tattered vocal imperfections of the elderly Eberhard Wchter were compensated for by his humour, experience and energy.  The women were the best singers.  Both Rosalinde (Pamela Coburn) and Adele (Janet Perry) were exceptionally fine.  Coburn's  Czardas was as accomplished and spirited a performance of that aria as I have heard. Brigitte Fassbaender was convincing as the dangerously self-indulgent Prince Orlovsky.  All the other male roles were well taken although Hofferwieser's Alfred was rather monotonously stentorian. The comic roles were very well realised. Benno Kusche who played the role of the prison-director Frank, was the most accomplished of the male singers and also an outstandingly good comic actor. Wolfgang Brendel was an urbane and amusing Dr Falke.  The drunk jailer Frosch was played to the hilt by Franz Muxender who must be a veteran in the role. The cameo role of the lawyer Ivan was nicely performed by Ivan Unger.

Of course the great Carlos Kleiber gave a loving and experienced reading of the entire score. The work is infused with greatness.  Only fools mistake it for trivia.  I find the music is still haunting my brain.",1388793600,4,1326,5.2075471698113205

The color was off and faded in a number of places, and it is visibly a stage performance that was roughly adapted for video recording.  One of the benefits of watching a performance on the small screen is that you can see greater detail of expression on the actors faces and your view is directed to the dramatic focus.  It's like having the best seat in the opera, practically on stage.  As such, this recording disappoints.  Too many wide angle shots and set pieces that, while perfectly acceptable for stage, become distracting on screen.
