7749934,5,B01FGS4CK4,"Putting Poplarville on the map!! Great quirky indie film from south Mississippi. I wasn't sure that it was a work of fiction until I saw David Earl Johnson as a preacher man!!

If you liked napoleon dynamite then give this little film a try, and it will be an instant hit for the entire family.",1482192000,2,294,4.345454545454546

7749937,5,B01FGS4CK4,"This is a very quirky indie movie that is somewhat similar to American Movie. I really like that all of the actors consist of untrained natives from Louisiana! Very different, but very funny and entertaining to watch. I've now seen it twice! I'll be watching Hickory Never Bleeds next!!",1482192000,2,286,4.857142857142857
7749938,5,B01FGS4CK4,"Good, clean fun!  Humorous movie with entertaining characters and an interesting story.  Warning:  After watching the film, you may never be able to look at toothpicks again without laughing. :)  All kidding aside, a very enjoyable move by Ladner.",1482192000,,247,5.256410256410256
7749939,5,B01FGS4CK4,"A great movie with sometimes subtle, sometimes obvious humor.  We particularly enjoyed watching a cast of relatively unknown actors portray their characters in a professional and memorable way.  The plot was family friendly, which we appreciated, and this has become a movie we have now watched on multiple occasions.  To our family, it gets better with every viewing.  Highly recommended for a movie night where you just want to sit back, have a laugh, and enjoy yourself.",1482105600,,473,5.103896103896104

7749941,5,B01FGS4CK4,"I had the privilege of seeing this movie on the big screen when it was released. I fell so in love with it I got a DVD copy to rewatch. I've seen it now four times and find new delights with every viewing. Quirky, funny and original, the movie tells the story of a young man trying to make a lifelong dream come true by his thirtieth birthday You'll laugh, you'll sigh, you'll cheer him on in his quest. Beautifully done indie film with a cast of some of the most amazing people you've ever seen in a movie. If you like original humor with a heart, you'll love ""Max Peril.""",1482105600,,573,4.171171171171171
7749942,5,B01FGS4CK4,"If you are a fan of Jared Hess films or similar, or if you enjoy quirky mockumentaries with heart and memorable characters in a Southern U.S. small-town setting, then Max Peril is a film for you. Max Peril is essentially a film within a film, dealing with one aspiring filmmaker's desire to finish a full project before he turns 30. The filmmaker Riley latches onto the stories of a man who goes by the name of Max Peril, a supposedly retired secret agent. Riley attempts to faithfully recreate Max's stories, recruiting a ragtag group of local talent to help complete the film. He quickly encounters and adjusts to numerous challenges, such as having to reluctantly cast himself as a younger version of Max, reusing some of his actors for multiple roles, developing action sequences with explosions, and acquiring a soundtrack for the film within his significantly limited budget. The biggest challenge, however, arises when Riley is forced to consider the overall point of the film as he begins to question the legitimacy of some of Max's stories, one of which is hilariously debated over with a couple of his colorful actors as they, too, try to justify the story. Ultimately, Riley's internal conflict leads to a revelation that completes the whole film, bringing the adventure full-circle in a way.

I believe this is a film that anyone of any age could enjoy. There is a broad range of humor to be found in the inherent quirkiness of the characters, the unintentional/intentional timing and delivery of certain lines, and the amusing colloquial expressions used throughout. The soundtrack itself is both heartwarming and hilarious as it alternates from 80's synthesizer action music to raw guitars and vocals. There is a montage of Riley and the rest of the cast working on the film within the film that resonates with me as a particularly memorable moment with the soundtrack. Perhaps the funniest scene to me involved a particular character played by James ""Sonny"" Howard repeatedly throwing toothpicks at Frank Ladner's character, eventually leading to a dramatic car chase. I had to rewatch that sequence a couple of times. The ""Blanco Duro"" encounter with Mark Forte's character and subsequent chase scene also had me in stitches.

Overall, I enjoyed every moment of this film. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the writing, the characters themselves, all expertly done. This movie had me from the opening credits sequence all the way through to the last note of the closing credits song. I would recommend it to anyone. Even if it's not quite your type of humor or maybe a little too strange for your tastes, it's still worth watching just for the experience.",1482105600,,2673,4.99103139013453

7749952,5,B01FGS4CK4,"I first watched this film at a convention that I also had a film showing at. Instantly I became a fan of Frank Ladners work. I've always been a fan of documentary/mockumentary films and this film (as well as Franks other work) is some of the best I've seen in a long time. I've looked forward to seeing this again for a while now and I must say it definitely has fantastic replay value. Frank is fantastic at making the absolute most of out the resources at his disposal and he really knocks it out of the park with Max Peril. For anybody wanting to break into the indie film making scene I would have to say that Max Peril (as well as Frank's first film ""Hickory Never Bleeds"") is required viewing. As the title of this review states. This is an A+ film from an A+ filmmaker.",1482019200,,776,4.25

7749954,5,B01FGS4CK4,"This is a refreshing, side splitting indie film. I love the look and feel. It's got that gritty, raw look and the low budget stamp of approval all over it which really works for the settings.  It's like watching reality tv, very down to earth, not rushed. The actors are so realistic and funny. The storyline is creative and interesting. It's a fun little indie ride you should take with your favorite flavor of popcorn.",1481932800,,420,4.6
7749955,5,B01FGS4CK4,"One of the funniest independent movies I've seen in years. The acting is supeb and the writing is even more so. Now you may ask yourself, does this tory encompass the full range of human emotion? Well, If you know what the full range of human emotion is. We can take you right to the edge of that. Right to the edge of it.",1481932800,,322,4.046875

7749957,5,B01FGS4CK4,"Great tongue-in-cheek film with lots of quirky characters in a story about a young man's desire to make a film before he turns 30. Frank Ladner's skill as a storyteller is evident from the very beginning as his main character's (played by Frank Ladner) monologue sets the stage. This film won in film festivals all over the country, delighting and entertaining audiences everywhere it played. You only have to invest five minutes and you are hooked.",1481932800,,449,4.921052631578948
7749958,5,B01FGS4CK4,"Having seen Frank Ladner's first feature length film, I was very interested to see his second. He did not disappoint. I love quirky, odd, funny films and this met every requirement. I've watched this film 3 times and laugh just as hard and pick up on something new each time. Frank's portrayal of the lead character, Riley, is hilarious. It's a fun film for all ages that covers ""the full range of emotions"".",1481932800,,408,4.602739726027397

And its also very apropriate for all ages",1481932800,,337,4.365079365079365
7749960,5,B01FGS4CK4,"Hands down the best comedy I've seen in the past five years. It's unbelievable how Frank is able to make this ""homegrown"" film seem as cinematic as anything in theaters today. What's crazier is that all the characters seem real and live in this world he has created. The emotions they imbue on the audience and how they emote all appear to be genuine.

All of this seems to come at ease to Frank; nothing ever feels forced during the duration of the film. I seriously cannot recommend this film more. It's the perfect film.",1481846400,2,523,4.505263157894737
7749961,5,B01FGS4CK4,"Review headline says it all.  ""Max Peril"" is a mockumentary following lo-fi filmmaker, Riley Young, who decides to film the true lies of a local named Max Peril (of the movie title), who is a self-described secret agent.  What follows is Riley's comedic exploits cinematically (for lack of a better word) re-envisioning Riley's interviews with Peril.  Great performances all around, including director Frank Ladner as Riley as well as the talents of seemingly non-actor locals (reminiscent of the Coen Brothers' expert use of local non-actors to produce unique performances), a lot of laughs, nice synth soundtrack, and a sweet subplot involving Ladner's real-life wife.  The movie recreation of Max Peril's supposed exploits, which evoke some of the best moments in Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights,"" is worth the price of admission alone.  A winning, hilarious little indie sleeper not to be missed and a directing and acting triumph for Frank Ladner.",1481846400,2,958,5.317880794701987

7749964,5,B01FGS4CK4,"A wonderful eclectic film with superb acting by its hometown cast. A must see film, ""yes indeed,"" as SwoopDown would say.

This movie is a refreshing mix of unique characters and highly amusing dialogue. The only disappointing thing about this movie was when the credits rolled, because I still wanted more.  It's very rare to find a movie nowdays that lives up to the label family friendly thats also hysterically funny.  Folks, this is it!  A warning though...you cant watch it just once.",1481846400,2,535,4.720430107526882
7749971,5,B01FGS4CK4,Max Peril is hilarious!! I really enjoyed it. This is the kind of movie that will get funnier and funnier each time you watch it! Sober and done (my favorite)! Great job!,1473465600,,170,4.34375
7749972,5,B01FGS4CK4,A wonderful independent film about filmmaking and living in the south. This movie has an unlimited supply of charm and heart. You'll fall in love with the characters and their drive to create. There's no reason that anyone shouldn't fall in love with this film. The director does an excellent job using the documentary style mixed with lots of quick artistic decisions that add just enough flash. Give it a watch and share it with people that you care about.

7749973,5,B01FGS4CK4,"I absolutely love this movie!  Hilarious!  I tend to like quirky movies that are not mainstream and this fits the bill.  Frank Ladner is excellent in the lead roll of ""Riley"" and has perfect comic delivery. My friends and I are constantly quoting one liners from the movie.  Every time I watch it, I catch something I missed the first time. If you are into the Christopher Guest type of movies, you will love this one!",1467849600,,418,4.4605263157894735

7749975,5,B01FGS4CK4,"Max Peril is one of the best comedies I have seen in a in a long time. If it were in high school it would hang out with movies like Napoleon Dynamite and other quirky comedy films! This movie brings small town life and big time storytelling to life in a way you could never imagine. It is full of gut busting one liners that are sure to be quoted for months after viewing and you are guaranteed to experience the full range of emotion while watching.

I was lucky to find this film at a local festival and however you arrived here don't pass this one up!  Everything about this film shows that it was made for the love of storytelling rather than personal success (though the film is deservingly award-winning).

7749983,5,B01FGS4CK4,"""Max Peril"" is the best independent film to come out of Mississippi.  Period.  It captures the heart and soul of the story that it's telling.  The acting is precise, the directing is immaculate, and the comedy is funny.  The scene with the toothpicks is the best I've seen in years.  One thing that makes this movie so unique is that it was shot on a lot of different formats.  That means some scenes were shot with Black Magic, some on film, and some on video.  Combining those different stocks definitely gives different sequences a variety of feeling.  Kudos to Frank Ladner for playing such a strong lead.",1464912000,2,609,4.626168224299065

7749986,5,B01FGS4CK4,"Max Peril has the subtle ability to sneak up on you and make you a fan without you even suspecting it. Frank Ladner, a southern gentleman from a small south Mississippi town called Poplarville, has the ability to take a bunch of local folks and turn them into entertaining characters with heart and soul. That is probably what makes his films so interesting...the characters. Ladner leads off the film as its protagonist, Riley, who's going to make a film or bust. So he does (make a film), and the result is hilarious. Ladner and his film, both award winners at film festivals across the country, are funny, thoughtful, quirky, and interesting. You won't regret watching this one. In fact, my bet is you will watch it more than once..",1464825600,2,735,4.705426356589148
7749987,5,B01FGS4CK4,"This is a true gem of a film.
One of the best of 2015 by a long shot.
Production quality, dialogue, plot, talent you name it this film has it all!
Frank Ladner, is known for his witty, dry and yet friendly dialogue delivery.
With this film, you can see how his art is progressing and the actors are gaining confidence
with the camera.
Buddy Moody, always the quintessential professional delivers lines with a timing numerous seasoned thespians would love to have.
Jana Ladner, on screen as in real life is the perfect counterpart to Frank.
They have this quirky, endearing quality which makes you instantly root for them and identify with them.
Jessy Hughes gives an impeccable performance as Julie Deavers.
Bobby Smith as Swoop Down, adds yet another level of depth to this already intricate film.
You'll almost feel yourself in the scenes with them.
James Sonny Howard, gives the same amazingly well crafted quality performance that he did in Hickory Never Bleeds, showing that he
truly could play almost every character in this film, if he were just given the chance.
But I must digress, I could go on and call out the entire cast by name but that would be a huge review.
Every single cast member played an integral role in this film.
You will not be disappointed.
Money can not buy you talent, and is not a requisite to making a world class feature film.
If you've never heard of Frank Ladner before now, believe me, you will never forget him after watching this film.
Although Riley may tell us, ""Making movies is hard.."" Frank Ladner, makes it look effortless.",1464825600,2,1566,4.677536231884058

8760773,2,B01FGS4CK4,"A good idea is marred by a dull, repetitive narrative. This one has its moments and if those moments had been multiplied and spread out over the running time, the movie would've been a terrific piece of entertainment. It blends slick faux-documentary footage with low-fi footage from a movie that's being filmed within the fake doc. If the fictitious filmmaker could afford a high-end professional camera to document his efforts at making a crappy movie, why couldn't he use that camera instead of a VHS camcorder to produce what's supposedly his serious effort at film-making? We don't get the sense that another film crew is working behind the scenes. From a viewer's perspective, it appears that Frank Ladner is running both productions. Some of the juvenile special effects Ladner sets up for his little film within the film are funny. Buddy Moody and Bobby Smith are fun to watch. Unfortunately, the really good, inspired, comic bits get lost in the padding featuring a static, deadpan, molasses-slow Ladner as his main character, Riley ruminating over and over regarding the minutia of the film-making process. There's also a thin subplot concerning the awkward, Riley and his potential love interest. Riley is supposed to be twenty-nine years old but he approaches this relationship with the emotional and intellectual panache of a middle-school boy. Overall, the movie has a bit of a Napoleon Dynamite vibe. That film's charm comes from the clumsy, adolescent Napoleon trying to fit in and find his place in the world. A nearly thirty-year-old man-boy essentially playing that same role is not at all engaging unless he's struggling with a learning difference or a serious head injury. I'm obviously the first person outside of the filmmaker's friends and family who's bothered to comment on Max Peril. This is a tiny micro-budget production and I admire the effort. I might have even been tempted to give it three stars because I appreciate Ladner's earnestness. But I'm also tempted to give it one star to balance out the phony user scores and comments offered so far on this one. If you love your nephew and you're proud of the little movie he made, give it four stars. Giving it five stars smells like desperation.",1484179200,,2226,4.986559139784946
8760774,5,B01FGS4CK4,"The genius of indie film maker Frank Ladner is now available for all to enjoy! Indie film making requires a ""jack of all trades"" type personality. Frank Ladner most definitely displays his skills set in this film, writing, directing, cinematography, editing, visual effects and even acting, as one of the main characters.

Part of the beauty of ""Max Peril"" is that these are all just local folks, not actors. Even knowing this you find yourself believing every word they say, well most of what they say anyway. Their wit and humor is most often understated but always hilarious.

I would highly recommend this to all and look forward to Frank Ladner's next project!

By the way, I ordered two copies of ""Max Peril"".  One for me to keep safely in my collection and the other copy to loan to my friends.",1483660800,,801,4.659574468085107
8760775,5,B01FGS4CK4,"Max Peril is an excellent film.  Mr. Ladner's unique take on the ""mockumentary"" genre with a movie-within-a-movie angle captures the aesthetic of south mississippi in a way that i've never seen before.  The one liners and dry humor mix well with the hopeful yet melancholy soundtrack.  Mr. Ladner has a bright future in cinema and Max Peril is just a glimpse of what that future may hold.  I would recommend this movie very highly.",1483574400,,431,4.783783783783784
