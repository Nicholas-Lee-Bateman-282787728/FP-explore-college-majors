8170224,2,B000MMMT7S,Too slow moving. Acting not good. Disappointing for something based on a true story.,1414281600,,84,5.071428571428571
8170225,4,B000MMMT7S,"and I did not have this one in my collection of Linda Blair movies.  I like Lindsay Frost as well and the movie itself is not bad at all.  There really isn't anything I would have wanted to know about this film prior to purchasing it.  The Bambi Bembenek story was huge at one point and if I remember correctly, there were a few tv movies about her as well, but this one does a good job, but like I said, I wanted it for my Linda Blair collection.  If you are a fan of LB, then you should grab one before the movie gets too hard to find.",1371772800,,537,3.8990825688073394
8170226,2,B000MMMT7S,"Falls short of the mark in answering the question of Bambi's guilt or innocence, and at times is a bit too biased towards Bambenek. Pretty typical tv-movie fare. Another stepping stone in the long and uninteresting resume of Linda Blair after she stopped appearing topless in movies.",1193788800,6,283,5.042553191489362
