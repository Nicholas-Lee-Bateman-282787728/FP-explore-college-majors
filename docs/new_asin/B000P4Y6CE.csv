2810180,5,B000P4Y6CE,"This documentary, ""The Great Happiness Space,"" was very insightful about the positives and the negatives of being a Host in Japan. If you are interested in the lives of Japanese male hosts, buy this documentary.",1277769600,,211,5.057142857142857
2810181,5,B000P4Y6CE,"The Great Happiness Space is a unique documentary about ""host clubs"" in Osaka, Japan. The hosts are male prostitutes who entertain lonely women at the clubs. The movie is fascinating both for what it says about Japanese culture and for the reasons women give for hiring prostitutes.

Viewers leave the familiar and descend into Osaka's neon-filled nightlife. The filmmakers focus both on the hosts and on their clients. The different perspectives give the film depth.

The men are money-hungry cynics. Some are making small fortunes, but very few would-be hosts succeed. Hosts tell conflicting stories about ""how far they go"" with clients. All of the men have longish, tinted hair; by Western standards, they look somewhat feminine. Viewers see amusing scenes of hosts trying to ""hustle"" women who are walking down the street.

The surprisingly-young women who visit the clubs do so in hopes of bonding with a host. One woman confesses that she broke up with her fiancee after falling in love with her host. The viewer's heart breaks for her when the host later tells the filmmaker what he thinks of her.

My wife and I both loved this film. If I had to complain, I would say that the filmmakers might have asked the men about their lives away from work - especially their ""real"" relationships with women. The film is in Japanese with English subtitles; it didn't bother us, but some people dislike subtitles.

To learn about a different side of Japan, The Great Happiness Space is a difficult film to top.",1270771200,9,1506,4.8671875
2810182,4,B000P4Y6CE,"The title Great Happiness Space (2006) is derived from the Rakkyo host club in Osaka, Japan, a happy space in a night club frequented by young females whose dreams are fulfilled by young male attention - the Japanese Host Boys.

The focus is on the club's owner Issei, who along with his staff of host boys party with the girls, sweet talk them, tell them what they want to hear, establish fake relationships, drink expensive champagnes, sex and all about keeping them and getting to their pocketbooks.  This isn't a one on one deal, the young men sit the evening with several women.  But primarily, the evening is spent chugging down very very expensive champagne.

Where do the girls get the money, you might ask?  Prostitution.  It averages that 80 percent of the patrons are prostitutes earning a ton of money, who in turn, blow it on their fantasy guys.  The circle of money.

We get a glimpse of the hiring of the young men, looking cool, dyed hair, nice clothes, and oozing with an appeal to girls.  The prostitutes are easy to persuade, with low self-esteem, lost souls, lonely, as prostitution is not about the sex and love.  So, here, the escape to fantasy revolves around love and attention, regardless of reality or price.

The documentary does not answer some questions.  It seems these girls make hundreds in a night, and perform in seedy street rooms, as the film leads us to believe.  We are not informed about the logistics of spending thousands in these clubs, do they have expensive drug habits?  Shop pimps? Rent?  Apartments?  Families to support?  Education?  I did not come away determining where, other than the club, does their money go??

As far as the male hosts who can earn $30,000 in a month {that's what they say}, the camera follows them home one evening and ""home"" did not appear to be penthouses.  So the viewer is left without pertinent information as a followup to the excessive income for young men.  It is mentioned how their excess drinking can damage to the liver.  What happens to these men when they choose not to continue this career?  Otherwise, this is an opening of your eyes documentary that many have not been exposed to before.  ......Rizzo",1234915200,2,2189,4.715039577836412
2810183,3,B000P4Y6CE,"The lifestyle in Osaka is super hot, but rather expensive, and I don't think I would be able to afford a single evening of fun there.  It's a pity in a way, but such pleasures are available only to the wealthy, or to young women who themselves work in the sex industry to afford the services of the ""selling hosts"" whom we get to meet, one by one.

Cleverly the director of the documentary takes us there through a classic narrative strategy--the old ""first day on the job"""" bit, as we see a young man right off the farm, good looking but dressed plain, like an Amish bumpkin, and he impresses Issei with his deep respevct and obedience.  Soon he will be making $25,000, $30,000 a month.  I wonder what these boys do with all that money?

And also, we see that all of their clients are actually slaving away in order to be able to afford their visits to the great happiness space, and the implication is that the hosts are having sex with these women.  The main host, Issei, says that he personally has slept with five hundred clients in the past year.  What we see however, is a lot of flirting and drinking and sitting next to each other, for which the women are charged exorbitant sums.  For such a seedy film, the movie is strangely coy about showing anything resembling actual sex between client and host--when, where do they do it, and most intriguingly, if a bottle of champagne is $10,000, then how much do they have to spend to feel the mighty loins of Issei heave within them?  A million dollars?",1233878400,2,1506,4.427536231884058
2810184,5,B000P4Y6CE,"It is a really nice doco of a  Japanese-style ""normal"" heterosexual male escort business extorting money from young women supporting their dreams of love by prostituting themselves.

Extremely handsome young males disclose much of a Japanese culture in general.

Must to see.",1227744000,,275,5.5
2810185,5,B000P4Y6CE,"This is an excellent documentary about a host club in Osaka called Cafe Rakkyo. The owner is an energetic, charismatic guy named Issei. Issei and his fellow ""host boys"" spend the evening talking, singing, flirting, drinking and sometimes having sex with a variety of women who pay big money for their company.

I expected the majority of the female customers to be older and perhaps unattractive. But instead most were as young and good looking as their male hosts. In fact, about 70%-80% were prostitutes and others who worked in Japan's vast and very kinky sex industry. This explains how these women could afford to pay so much for an evening's entertainment. Issei claimed to be able to make as much as $50,000 a month while one of the female customers said she had spent as much as $7,000 in a single night. The host boys' favorite technique of manipulation was to create the ""illusion of love"" and thus get the infatuated girl to keep returning in hopes of an eventual relationship outside the club. As another reviewer mentioned, there also seemed to be an element of pimping involved. Many of the women in the sex industry tried to rationalize their jobs by saying they needed to keep making the big bucks so they could afford to ""support"" their beloved host boy.

Trying to understand the pyschology behind all this is a  complicated task and I am certainly not the one to do it. But one thing I did notice, while travelling in Japan, is that none of the 4 women I dated would allow me to pay for anything, even dinner, and so all costs were shared. My only explanation is that traditional Japanese society is so sexist that perhaps these ""modern"" women are determined to escape the bonds of male domination by using their newly acquired economic power. That certainly seemed to be part of the ""turn on"" for the female customers at Cafe Rakkyo.

In any case, I found the subject matter to be fascinating and would recommend this doc to anyone interested in human sexuality and gender identity.",1212796800,10,2002,4.6789772727272725
2810186,4,B000P4Y6CE,"The Great Happiness Space by Jake Clynell was an intriguing, thought-provoking and sometimes disturbing glimpse into a culture that is, to most, unfamiliar if not unthinkable. It engages the audience in a no-holds-barred look at the Japanese male companionship trade, providing insight into reasons for why men become hosts as well as why women seek out their services. Question after question was raised in my mind not only about the lives of the men working at Osaka's Cafe Rakkyo but also about a culture in which this industry can exist and thrive. What are these women lacking in life that makes them shell out thousands of dollars just for amusement, entertainment and male company?

Many reviews and even the synopsis on the website, compare these male hosts to geisha, citing them as a contemporary male version of this ancient tradition, but I have to disagree. Geisha were well trained in a variety of art forms and provided dance and music in addition to their intelligent conversation to the men who paid to spend time in their presence. The male hosts at Rakkyo lack these talents and, instead, offer a different set of services and fill a very specific niche in a Japanese society that has an interesting relationship to sexuality and intimate relationships.

This is a movie to watch, not just to learn about the sex trade in Japan, but also to spark thoughts on why men and women both seek intimacy in its different forms within the service industry. Having lived in Japan and possessing an interest in gender and sexuality issues, I thought I knew what I was getting into when I pressed the play button, but this film introduced ideas and concepts that I shuddered at and could not stop thinking about for days.",1205193600,6,1728,4.814814814814815
2810187,4,B000P4Y6CE,"Well, a documentary about male hosts in an Osaka Hosto Kurabu named ""Rakkyo"" ought to be interesting, no? Believe me, it is, and it's not so pretty and ideal as most people would tend to think. The atmosphere certainly isn't like those that girls see in manga like Ouran High Host Club or P.B.B. This documentary shows not only the dark side of the business itself but also the typical human nature of both men and women. Not only would you be disillusioned with the idea of male host clubs, you will be disillusioned with the idea of ""love"" and ""romance"" too if you watch this. But that's not to say that host clubs or this film are ""bad."" It's just that this documentary did a hella of a job at keeping things on a realistic level. Although I do have to refute some of details that is mentioned here in another Amazon review.

First of all do not make the mistake in thinking that these hosts are ""male geisha(s)."" The description of the DVD itself says that these hosts are ""akin to male geishas,"" ""akin"" being the keyword here. Second of all do not take the english translation as it is. In the documentary, money figures were mentioned and I can tell you that the number itself is correct (the girls really did spend ""hyakku-man en"" on hosts----1,000,000 yen which is about roughly $9,235.32 USD). The film makers rounded up the figures.

This documentary is about an entertainment business and is, in some way, meant to entertain the audience. Do not approach this film with a serious eye, for this film does not fall under the field of academia and was not made for academic purposes.

I would have given this film a five star rating if it wasn't for the fact that I thought this film was too narrow in its scope. For some reason, I felt that the host club interviewed in this movie, Rakkyo, is in fact one of the low-end popular ones out there in Japan. I'm pretty sure there are other host clubs that are very different (though they're usually in Tokyo). This film only presented one host's view of the business, not others.",1195862400,5,2033,4.489189189189189

8188904,5,B000P4Y6CE,"I love the theme that comes up often in Japanese culture, the theme of ""who am I, and am I connected to my real self?"" This is a very pervasive theme in Sion Sono movies (particularly Noriko's Dinner Table) and has never been driven home with more force than with The Great Happiness Space.

This is a film about a companion bar and the men who work there. They are paid to entertain women, and by ""entertain"" I mean eat with them, talk to them, pour them drinks and sing to them. Romantics and antics. And it's all paid for by the women, who develop obsessions with particular companions. Of course, each companion can't entertain just one person - they have rent to pay. So you end up with girls in contentious positions with other girls over guys who they pay to hang out with them. And most of these girls are full-time prostitutes.

Through conversations with these companion clients you start to get a sense that the personalities they create in their lines of work, and the personalities they create when they are with ""their"" men, are both facades. What lies beneath is anyone's guess, there doesn't really seem to be any room in their lives for a real self. Being a prostitute, with the various roles that entails, and being the faux girlfriend to an employee of a companion bar, blurs the line of real personality to the point that it stops being the point. These girls seem to understand that they aren't really ""with"" the guys they pay to obsess over, but they don't really seem to care. It's bizarre and sad, and it's even profoundly existential when you consider your own self-made illusions and the careful constructs you use to keep them in operation.

From no other source could I learn this much about myself or about the human need for companionship at any cost (literal financial cost and emotional cost as well). It's a well made film and it carries a powerful message that will have totally different implications for every viewer. For every person who watches this and sees nothing but a freaky mess of people, there will be someone who pauses and reflects. Very highly recommended.",1393632000,3,2105,4.638069705093834
8188905,5,B000P4Y6CE,"An interesting look at the red light districts I didn't know existed. I did like their hair dos. They all use what they can, I guess there's an art to it. Like one said people are clumsy at it and he finds it easy.",1367107200,,214,3.8863636363636362

8188909,4,B000P4Y6CE,"I loved The Great Happiness Space. I only heard about it through blogs about Asia. It gave the viewer an inside look at a subculture that one would not get the chance to see. Host clubs are not popular in mainstream North America, so it was especially interesting. Since it was made my a sociologist, I loved it. I like factual films and documentaries so I loved this type of film.

The only thing that I was not happy about was the condition of my the used copy that I purchased. I paid $40 and it came with a phtotcopied cover. I was a little ticked off, because I wanted the picture...the guy is really handsome. I really wanted to watch it immediately so I didn't return it. Before you purchase it used, decide if you could do without a good quality cover. It may be worth the extra money to buy the new copy.",1283040000,,813,4.245161290322581
