Brought tears to my eyes knowing That i still remember where i was when I heard on a transistor radio that our President had been killed. Not quite sure why the other reviews gave this a zero. With the technology at the time 1963, It was well done. Also nominated for an Oscar for Best Documentary. I highly recommend this.",1481673600,2,452,4.445783132530121
