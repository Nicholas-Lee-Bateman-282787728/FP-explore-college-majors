8021285,1,B00023DEGC,"This film plays like a poorly written late night cable movie or an R-rated soap-opera. One reviewer claimed that it was slightly more explicit than a standard ""Playboy"" film. It is not. It is less. There is no more explicit nudity than what could be found in a rated-R movie. It's just more frequent. This is also not a good movie for couples since it involves arguments and cheating. Only one scene was related to voyeurism.",1345075200,,425,4.605263157894737
8021286,1,B00023DEGC,This DVD was a huge disappointment.  The acting is cheesy and the plots don't go anywhere.  This title has more talk then scenes.  It switches back and forth during the talking to the skin scenes that are like 20 seconds of viewing which acts like a cold shower to the viewer.  The only lengthy scene in the whole DVD is the first one.  I got more out of the DVD extras then the featurettes.  Again huge disappointment.  I wouldn't recommend this title to anyone,1147132800,,462,4.428571428571429
8021287,5,B00023DEGC,"Synopsis: A series of short sexy vignettes.

Our Review: This is a series of videos collected and produced by the Alexander Institute, who also produce the Loving Sex Video Series, which we promote on our site. This marks a departure from instructional to more plot and fantasy driven footage, which we found very well done and sexy beyond our expectations.

Each title contains several stories touching on topics ranging from adultery to swinging to bisexuality and fantasy situations. In each volume, there are six stories totaling 90 minutes and you may recognize many of the participants from hardcore porn films, albeit toned-down and much more tame. There are no scenes showing actual penetration or genetalia beyond some pubic hair and the sex acts are shown discreetly. These video are just a tad more explicit than Playboy-type offerings and one could almost imagine seeing them in the late hours on HBO.

What sets these titles apart for us, however, are the quality participants and the realistic storylines (the acting is decent as well). Everyone is attractive and natural, with no silicone in sight, which is a nice departure from the humongous breasts and lips we're subjected to in so many porn films. The editing is very well done and the sound quality is top notch. Everything moves along nicely and we can't recommend them enough to couples looking for sexy adult fare but not quite ready to make the leap to XXX.",1103241600,5,1432,4.933609958506224
