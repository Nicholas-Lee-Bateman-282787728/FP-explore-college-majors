These two films are both top notch efforts ,I have a extensive collection of spaghetti westerns and collect all of the Wild East ones I can get my hands on ,they clean up these films and usually put two films that have a common factor on each release. The films here are above average ,I have viewed both multiple times, they are well paced,well acted  and have excellent scores ,the theme for The Forgotten Pistolero stands out,its beautifully done score is by Roberto Pregadio that has a very Morricone style and is his best work, it stands in the top ten of spaghettii western themes. Disregard the bad reviews these are great films.",1489881600,,845,4.559210526315789
8235659,4,B000ZJKCKY,I liked Unholy Four more (now available on Blu-Ray) but both films are good with fairly good transfers.,1486512000,,103,4.777777777777778
8235660,3,B000ZJKCKY,"The movies were both good, they belong to the better ones in the spaghetti western genre. In my opinion, the Forgotten Pistolero was better than the Unholy 4 with a nice story and interesting actors. What annoyed me most, though, was the relatively poor quality of the films.",1458777600,,275,4.75

8235662,1,B000ZJKCKY,"This set is a total waste of money! I don't expect miracles when it comes to these types of flicks but the storys of both have no substance or merit. The only value they have is for scenery, being a time waster or falling asleep while watching. Should have been sold at the Dollar Tree. The cover art is quite impressive but the old saying ""don't judge a book by its cover"" holds true here! Total Garbage!!",1273622400,,406,4.285714285714286
8235663,4,B000ZJKCKY,I have to say that the quality of my purchase was superb and it brought back great memories about when story telling in the movies were taken seriously and not just to make a quick buck.,1251676800,3,186,4.194444444444445
8235664,4,B000ZJKCKY,"One of the better package deals from Wild East, The Forgotten Pistolero and The Unholy Four - two good solid spaghetti westerns that deliver all the goods - plenty of gunplay, good plots, music scores, stunning cinematography of the Madrid, and most of all, Italian action at it's finest. Both films run from eighty to ninety minutes each, all on one disc, these Wild East transfers are surprisingly good with full screen and widescreen optional. The Forgotten Pistolero is a story of a desperado who seeks out his childhood friend to help solve a murder from the past and to resolve a revenge that has been long awaited for all those involved. The Unholy Four - a man called ""Chuck Mul"" suffers from amnesia. Mul escapes from an insane asylum, trying to remember, regain his identity, and his forgotten tormented past. An investigation is made to find out who the real culprits are involved in a strange conspiracy, setting off the fireworks in the end, one of the finest staged gunfights ever captured on film. starring Woody Strode, Leonard Mann, and Peter Martell.",1238716800,14,1068,4.841530054644808
8235665,4,B000ZJKCKY,"i've been waiting for these movies for a long time. I remember when iwas very YOUNG(around 1974)my mother took me to the cinema to watch ""The Unholy Four"" which was popular at that time,thanks to Amazon ,and their picture qualities is good. KEEP UP WITH GOOD WORK",1202515200,5,263,4.617021276595745
8235666,3,B000ZJKCKY,"I will give 4 stars for the ""Forgotten Pistolero"".  It is a good movie, and the music is great, but ""The Unholy Four"" breaks up, and gets stuck.  I could not watch it, so I cannot give a rating.",1201478400,3,194,3.948717948717949
