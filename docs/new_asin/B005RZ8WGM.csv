Not only do you get the full ""home-coming"" Denmark concert (featuring appearances from a half dozen of the finest European acts) but you'll also get their 6-song set from a huge German outdoor concert and another 3-song set from an LA bar that features appearances from the Pantera guitarists.

Not sure why other Americans are having trouble with the blu-ray  played just fine for me.

Outstanding camera work from the Copenhagen show  the extras were fun. Warning  set your English subtitles before you start off or you're going to be learning Dutch real quick.

Highly recommended!",1355097600,3,640,4.934579439252336
4861856,1,B005RZ8WGM,"I cant' believe that I fell for the false advertising over the customer reviews. The product details clearly state ""Region 1/A""............wrong. I received a Region 0 disc and of course it doesn't work in most Blu-Ray players. Thanks Amazon for the misrepresentation.",1341792000,,268,5.404761904761905
4861857,5,B005RZ8WGM,"If you like Volbeat, this is a must! If you don't, it's still good. Although I see the price has jumped significantly since I purchased this 3 months ago and apparently is an import.

If you've got a good surround sound, crank it up because the quality of their playing is superb and sounds the best when your ears start to bleed!

I've seen these guys live 3 times already, but I still like to jam out to this at home just because!

Again, the vendor changed for this...not sure if anyone is offering it in our region anymore(USA). I was able to get it months ago for about $30.",1336780800,,579,4.245454545454545
4861858,2,B005RZ8WGM,"I hate giving this a bad review, but I've had the same problems as some other people.  My Blu Ray player won't play it & I had to get a refund.  I wish the negative reviews had posted before I ordered and I would've held off.  From the clips I've seen & the trailer--it looks to have some great performances, but I will have to wait until there's a US compatable disc to see the whole show.",1332374400,2,390,4.038961038961039
4861859,2,B005RZ8WGM,"I was also very disappointed to find that this bluray, listed as a region 0 which is supposed to be like a ""universal"" format that can play anywhere, does not play here in the states. I also tried it on 2 diff PS3s and it would recognize the disc as the Volbeat Live from Beyond Hell Above Heaven Bluray, however when you hit play nothing, just a blank black screen and unable to select any menu options from there. So none the less, I had to return this item, and so far, I cannot find anywhere that is selling a Region 1 (which is what is needed in North America to play) online. I am too afraid to order from the volbeat website, since it's in Denmark and most likely won't play here. Keeping an eye out for when this finally becomes available to play in the U.S.!!!",1332288000,5,769,4.202702702702703
4861860,1,B005RZ8WGM,I was very disappointed to find out that the format of this blu ray is an import format not capable of being played in North America. I tried to play this blu ray on 2 different PS3's and 3 different blu ray players. None of these players were able to play this blu ray properly. One player showed picture with no sound the rest could not read the disc. I love Volbeat but I am disappointed with this disc. Why sell it in the USA if it cannot be played here!,1331424000,10,458,4.043956043956044
8484425,1,B005RZ8WGM,"Finally got around to watch the DVD, doesn't work. It's just a black screen. Tried other blue ray disc works fine. Waited awhile for the delivery too. Very disappointed pulse my return window with Amazon closed already.",1487462400,,219,4.945945945945946
8484426,5,B005RZ8WGM,"I am SO glad I bought this!!! Before purchasing I checked to be sure my player was capable of playing PAL, but I still crossed my fingers. As soon as it came in I rushed to play it. The picture is crystal clear and the sound is amazing. I just saw these guys in Nashville so this will be a treat for me until I see them on stage again!!!! I am VERY pleased!!!!!",1474934400,,361,3.891891891891892
8484427,5,B005RZ8WGM,"The Blu-ray plays fine in my USA Xbox One. Love it, great quality.",1470787200,,66,4.153846153846154
8484428,5,B005RZ8WGM,"Even though this is an all-region disc, it is in PAL format and will not play on most U.S. Blu-ray players.  I tried this disc in two different Sony models and a PlayStation 3 and it would not play.  Fortunately I also have an all region player that plays NTSC and PAL discs so I was able to watch this.  The bottom line on compatibility is ensure your player is capable of playing PAL discs.

As for the concert itself, it is awesome.  If you didn't already love Volbeat, I doubt you would be reading this.  Sound and picture quality are both great and all of the footage is well shot.",1394236800,,586,4.2342342342342345
8484429,5,B005RZ8WGM,"Says very clearly on blu ray region code 0 not a1 for North America. Would not play in my Sony BluRay. Luckily it does play in a PS4.
Amazon should really fix their description. I just got this today, 2/20/2014. Before purchase you should confirm with Amazon what version they are sending.

Great band!",1392854400,,302,4.592592592592593
8484430,4,B005RZ8WGM,"The quality of the concert footage is great without question. Volbeat is in their element on stage. As was evident when I saw them live the love performing and it shows on the BD as well.

It is dumb to  use a format that most mainstream players can't handle. It'll work on a  PC with a blu-ray drive/burner. It works on an Xbox One too. There seems to be a problem with the certificate of  the online content. Not sure if that is the culprit to begin with.",1387929600,,457,4.159090909090909
8484431,1,B005RZ8WGM,I have a Sony Blue Ray player that is updated and it won't play. My favorite band. Have seen them live twice. Was really looking forward to this .,1379808000,,146,4.068965517241379
8484432,5,B005RZ8WGM,"No doubt volbeat is one of the European bands that is giving that talk now, this concert collects the best of his career live a great Blu-ray, with a really good quality of image and video and an enviable setlist, as special recommendation check the region code for blu ray are  some of those who are offered here not compatible with some players that are not region free",1377475200,,371,4.455882352941177
8484433,5,B005RZ8WGM,This is a great disc but this will not work on a US PlayStation 3. It did play on my Panasonic player. Region restriction is annoying and only encourages illegal downloading. Hopefully Blu-ray manufactures will realize this soon...doubtful,1369785600,,239,5.315789473684211
8484434,5,B005RZ8WGM,"I want to set the record straight on this blu ray.  I've seen several negative reviews for this blu ray that are without merit.  Region 0 WILL play in North American players.  I've played it in 5 different blu ray players.  The only player that I've put it in and will not play it is a PS3.  Now that that is out of the way...

The performances on this blu ray are amazing.  They give you a wide spectrum of concert settings on this disc.  You get a full arena show from Denmark, seven song set from a U.S. club show, and three songs from the 2011 Rock Am Ring festival in Germany.  They went all out for the Denmark show.  Every artist that has made a guest appearance on a Volbeat record was brought in for this show.  And at the U.S. show you get guest appearances from Rob Caggiano (formerly from Anthrax, currently in Volbeat), and Scott Ian (Anthrax).",1362787200,6,857,4.260869565217392
