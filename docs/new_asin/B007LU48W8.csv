8608570,1,B007LU48W8,"At $19.99, this is a complete rip-off. This DVD is 47 minutes of ""Highlights of H.H. the Dalai Lama's UK 1999 visit"" (from the back label of the DVD). It's a sort of video diary, snippets of this and that from here and there on His Holiness' trip. Amateurish is a generous description. There's no coherent narrative, no continuity, no theme, just cobbled-together scenes of the Dalai Lama greeting crowds, entering and exiting automobiles, watching performances, and brief -- very brief -- snippets of His Holiness actually speaking (talks, press conferences). I can't think of anyone I admire and respect as much as the Dalai Lama, but this video is just a rip-off, and that's the only reason I wrote this review, to warn others that this is simply not worth paying for. Get it from a library if you're that interested in His Holiness (as I am, clearly, since I did just that!), but I think one would regret paying twenty dollars for this. You can get much better videos of and about the Dalai Lama for less (often much less) than that right here on Amazon.",1380412800,,1058,4.632978723404255
