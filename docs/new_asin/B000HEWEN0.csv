2636918,1,B000HEWEN0,"National Geographic - Mega Structures Collection

In my opinion the product is not well explained. Reading Mega structures Collection I thougt the shipment was the whole collection. If it would had been correctly explained I could choose other volume not vol 1 and vol 2, finally shiped.",1325808000,8,287,5.1063829787234045
2636919,5,B000HEWEN0,"Two disc set that covers some very interesting topics; from the military might of the C-5A cargo behemoth to the world`s largest port and what it takes to navigate and handle the superships who enter, this is a fab look into the Mega-world. NatGeo did it up from all angles, and is worth repeated viewings.",1319241600,3,306,4.581818181818182

2636921,5,B000HEWEN0,"Really Cool. Atlantic City Super Casino, But my favorite is the C5 Cargo Plane and Containershipping(Super Port), Really Neat Stuff.",1242000000,6,132,5.65
2636922,5,B000HEWEN0,"The Mega Structures set is AWSOME, you learn about the c-5 and what it takes to keep them rolling, and just how big they really are, and about differnt cargo ships and how things are loaded and unloaded, really intresting. The diamond mine gives you need appreciation for how BIG some piece of equipment can really be and how things really work. The one on the Casio, was neat, from the getting things ready to open to opening day. WOW. not a job for me.. but amazing all the people needed and training.. very worth the money.",1170720000,24,526,4.43298969072165
8139410,1,B000HEWEN0,"Imagine, if you can, the loudest instruments of a full-sized philharmonic orchestra playing at once in order to produce wall-to-wall noise. Imagine all of the drums playing the same notes simultaneously: the bass drum, kettle drums and snare drums, in addition bongo and conga drums, tom-toms, a tambourine and even the triangle.

Thats the kind of sound that underlies ALL the narration of the Mega seriesevery single minute of itand because there are no subtitles, you cant turn the sound off and just read, in silence, what the narrator is saying.

The idea, I gather, is that with enough relentless noise filling the viewers head, the viewer will not become bored. And you cant really call it music: its simply pummeling noise. After a few minutes of it, youll want to turn the program off.

Except for that, its a good series.",1513641600,,831,4.838028169014085
8139411,2,B000HEWEN0,"First off, you need to know that there are only 4 episodes in this ""Collection1 and Collection 2"" dvd set. Two on the first disc and 2 on the second disc. Way, way overpriced, in my opinion. We bought this to send to my dad for a father's day gift. They don't have cable or satellite, so we like getting them ""collections"" of videos as gifts. What a disappointment when I called him, the dvds came in today (ordered on Saturday with prime and it's Wednesday), and dad said that there were only two shows on a disc. Also, he said that the narrator's British accent is often not understandable. This is from someone who watches loads of British comedy on PBS, so he is not unfamiliar... Anyway, please think very hard about purchasing this. $75 or more for four episodes of anything in 2016 is ridiculous.",1466553600,,803,4.469387755102041
