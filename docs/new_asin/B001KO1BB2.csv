 most have never heard of this gem, but it is terrific, with a wickedly delicious twist to top off one hell of a fun movie.",1253059200,2,242,4.239130434782608
3666983,3,B001KO1BB2,I wasn't expecting a lot from this movie but it was very good and the death scenes just kept getting more and more violent and creative,1249516800,,135,4.230769230769231
3666984,2,B001KO1BB2,"The talented, lovely Rose Byrne's perfect American accent can be heard in his lackluster dark comedy with a flock of fine Canadian actors. The story is as moody as the Nova Scotia weather and, at times, even more gruesome. Sad to say, I never got caught up in the humor. But it's not awful -- and few things are as vitalizing as gazing at Rose.",1237161600,2,344,4.3076923076923075
3667005,4,B001KO1BB2,"Perfect casting, great timing and pacing, solid acting and production, music score right on the nose.  Dark comedy but not gruesome or overly bloody.  Relies on plot, screenplay and acting instead of special effects and gallons of red dye in corn syrup.
Somewhat predictable but very funny getting to the not-so-surprising end.

3667152,4,B001KO1BB2,"Just Buried: A Comedy Of [Homicidal] Errors

Just Buried is another pot of comedic gold at the end of the Canadian rainbow, starring our favorite go-to woobie Jay Baruchel and the prolific Rose Byrne of Bridesmaids fame. The long and short of it? Watch it.

Just Buried was released in 2007, so Im nearly a decade late to the party on this one, but I had high hopes for this pairing, having seen both actors progress in their more recent careers. Baruchels most known for his collaborations with fellow incognito-Canadian Seth Rogen in films like Knocked Up and  This Is The End, where he plays a loveable guy who gets kicked around by fate (and Just Buried is no departure). Byrnes a little harder to pin down  shed played in everything from super-hero flicks to horrors like Insidious, with a smattering of indie thrown in for good measure  so I was delighted to discover a new facet of her skill-set in Just Buried, where she plays an obsessive mortician with a ludicrous but lovable knack for accidental crime.

At its heart Just Buried could be compared to a number of other David-Goliath underdog comedies like Dodgeball or The Longest Yard, but it goes further than that. Its a buddy-tale between protagonist Oliver (Baruchel) and Roberta (Byrne) in the same vein as I Love You Man, featuring two very different but surprisingly compatible strangers who form a fast friendship (plus, later on, the inevitable wish-fulfillment fantasy typical of these sorts of films, where the nerdy nervous hero takes a corner in life and finds himself at the absurd center of a number of women and their rapidly escalating sexual advances).

But first and foremost, its a comedy of errors.

Oliver, in town for his estranged fathers funeral, expected a quick in-and-out visit; that is, until the will is executed, and Oliver inherits his fathers funeral home. Its only later that hes informed his own father is the homes first customer in a year. The business has been ailing ever since sleaze-ball Wayne Snarr (Christopher Shore) opened a rival funeral home, interdicting which his greasy marketing all the clients from the retirement home which had been a goldmine for Olivers father. The setup for the underdog comedy is obvious, but its a trope viewers seemingly never tire of, and I daresay a funeral-home is a fresher take on the genre than a dodgeball team (or any sporting team, for that matter).

While command of the funeral home, Oliver meets Roberta, the young, somewhat creepy mortician as well as the local coroner. Nervous Oliver (who suffers a nosebleed every time he gets nervous, often to hilarious effect) bumbles through their encounters until Roberta takes pity on him and takes him out for drinks.

Its here the film takes a turn into the absurd, which predictably is when the comedy kicks in.

After their cocktails and beers Oliver insists he probably shouldnt be driving. Eternally upbeat Roberta  insists everyone around here does it, and they hop in the truck and take backroads. Everythings going fine, and were starting so suspect some unlikely romantic undertones, until Oliver looks away from the road for a moment

 And just like that, the funeral homes got another customer.

For once, things seem to go right for Oliver. His first official funeral as director is a smashing success, and the dearly-deceased had the decency to be relatively loaded. But naturally, we can assume all is not well. And as the pair go to greater and more absurd lengths to keep the truth hidden, the bodies start to pile up. The repo-men are at the funeral home for the furniture, rival Snarr is offering low-ball buyout deals, and  short of engineering more accidental deaths  the pair struggles to keep the business afloat, hide their crimes, and keep their heads above water as various townsfolk grow suspicious (including Robertas own father who, in small-town tradition, just so happens to be the sheriff).

Just Buried revolves around a funeral home, and as youd expect, death is a central theme. It speaks to director-writer Chaz Thorns skill that hes able to wring maximum laughs out of a dark theme, but I wouldnt even go so far as to call this one a black comedy (or a dark comedy, since Im not sure what the official PC-stance on black comedy is). Just Buried is ultimately light-hearted in tone, and with the number of accidental deaths and their varying degree of unlikelihood, its clear that the movie doesnt take itself too seriously. If were going to call films like The Lobster a black comedy, then Just Buried is a romp, a lark. The stakes are high, but thats only a plot device to give skeleton to the films muscle and fat: the laughs and character dynamics.

Baruchel, naturally, kills it. I don't think Ive ever seen a movie of his I didn't like, so maybe Im biased. But the true credit goes to Byrne; whacky female characters, no matter how well written, can tend to skew towards Manic Pixie Dreamgirl in the bad cases, to annoying, to downright unbelievable in the worst instances. Its not an easy role by any means, but Byrne riffs off the theme perfectly, balancing just the right amount of ridiculous and relatable, snark and serious. Roberta provides Oliver a perfect foil while maintaining her own depth: she has her own stakes and motivations critical to the plot.

I wouldnt say Just Buried is my favorite from either actor. Baruchels best role remains himself in This Is The End, and I like Byrnes dramatics better in films like The Place Beyond The Pines. Its not even in the running for best recent Canadian comedy (of which there are too many to compare).

But for a film about a funeral home, its far more hilarious than Id have thought possible.",1473292800,,5685,4.792433537832311

The film is actually presented in letterbox format so as to accommodate the picture within a 4:3 standard vision television set. Widescreen it is not.

The back cover of the DVD slick also states that the DVD's regional code is `ALL'. This is not the case. Amazon's description that this is a Region One DVD is correct.

Prospective buyers of DVD's deserve better than this from distributors. I don't blame Amazon; they can hardly be expected to view every DVD to ascertain that the technical information is as claimed by the distributor.

Poor Oliver seems to be having bad luck; due to a series of accidents several locals are being dispatched. He is consoled and supported by the female mortician. Soon Oliver and the mortician must take positive action to mask the previous accidents. Oliver is getting good at this and now sees a bright future. But is there some underlying plot that Oliver is not aware of?

Never let it be said that Canadians don't know how to produce dark comedies.
