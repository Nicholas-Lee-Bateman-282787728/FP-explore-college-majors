1408938,5,B000059QY3,"While flawed in several respects, this DVD nevertheless records the most thrilling and moving performance of this opera I have ever seen or heard (and I have seen it performed live several times and own most commercial recordings of it). I had the VHS tape for years, but bought the DVD immediately when it became available, because this production deserves to be seen and heard in the best quality possible.
The success of this performance is attributable almost exclusively to Angela Gheorghiu.  Forget what many say about Maria Callas -- Gheorghiu IS Violetta.  She looks the part but, more importantly, she LIVES the part.  Her singing and acting is exquisite.  She truly makes one feel Violetta's ambivalence and conflict in her big Act I solo, love and sacrifice in the first scene of Act II (the scene between Violetta and Germont pere is perhaps the most complex and riveting in all of opera), her heartbreak in the second scene of that Act, and her relief at her reunion with Alfredo in Act III.  Her performance tugs at the heartstrings and drains the tearducts throughout the opera without ever seeming mannered or overdone.
Her achievement is even greater in that she can have this effect even playing against two antagonists of limited effectiveness.  As Alfredo, Frank Lopardo acts with commitment and youthful sincerity.  Unfortunately, his singing tone is rather pinched, which makes him seem stiff and unnatural.  Leo Nucci's Germont is woolly of tone and completely unsympathetic.  His performance in the Act II duet with Gheorghiu makes him seem like a monster rather than a concerned father.  It's to Gheorghiu's great credit that she makes Violetta's agreement to sacrifice herself and her love believable.  Had a lesser actress been paired with Nucci, the opera would have been over at that point; one would have expected her merely to boot Germont from her house.
I said that the performance's success is ALMOST exclusively attributable to Ms. Gheorghiu.  One must recognize Sir Georg Solti's contribution as well.  Had he driven the music harder or let it languish, all would have been lost.  But his moderated reading is perfect.  It is a true testament to his genius that one of the most renowned and dynamic conductors of all time could allow himself to be completely inconspicuous in the performance.
EVERY lover of opera and anyone interested in exposing himself or herself to opera should own this disc.  It will be a long time before it comes out of MY player.",994896000,67,2491,4.951923076923077
1408939,5,B000059QY3,"Holy moley!  I thought the praise on the DVD box was too effusive, too uncritical, too much marketing hype.  Now I'm a believer.  This is just about as perfect a performance as you could ever ask for.  Regardless of what you may think or know of her (well-publicized) offstage behavior, Angela Gheorghiu is simply beyond reproach in this live video.  She looks like the ideal Violetta, her acting is very moving, and best of all, she sings the part as it was meant to be sung -- musically, dramatically, thrillingly.  She judges her dynamics perfectly, never singing too loud -- she projects even the softest of pianissimos over the orchestra -- but she can really rip out the high notes when called for.  Her coloratura is flawless, and yet it never sticks out like a mere technical show (as with some singers) -- when she sings it, it's an integral part of the drama of the moment.  She sings the lyrical, legato passages with a genuine sense of line, but she also sings the whole with just the right amount of declamation.  Her voice is very pleasing to the ear, yet distinctive and instantly recognizable.  Now I can finally understand why people went nuts over Maria Callas 40-50 years ago.  I'll probably get some grief for making this comparison, as I'm a Callas ignoramus, but I imagine that this performance by Gheorghiu must be like what Callas's performances used to be like -- perfect singing, perfect acting, and perfect *integration* of singing and acting.
Everyone else on this video is pretty good, too.  In fact, Solti is (was) great -- his conducting is exciting and his tempos are, on the whole, well judged.  Frank Lopardo is a solid Alfredo, and Leo Nucci a somewhat bland but decent Germont -- and like Gheorghiu, they each totally look the part.  The sound and picture quality are both very good.
The only thing that maddens me is that it took Decca so ridiculously long (almost 7 years) to release this video in the United States.  (I think it was available in other countries on VHS.)  Well, at any rate, it's here now, so what are you waiting for?  Get it!",994291200,11,2082,4.629427792915531
1408940,5,B000059QY3,"La traviata holds a very precious status in my experiences, from my first hearing with Eleanor Steber and Richard Tucker from a Met visit to Dallas, to two performances of Maria Callas, and two performances of Montserrat Caballe, all four with the Dallas Civic Opera under Nicola Resigno.  Performance-wise, I do not know how Solti's could be bettered, as even Leo Nucci, a somewhat casual singer, deeply involves himself in the Act II confrontation between Violetta and Germont Pere. Angela Gheorghiu immerses herself into Violetta's suffering,leaving every emotional nuance explored tactfully and lyrically.  Added to the physical beauty of the soprano, the voice reflects a lyrical sweetness with spectacular technique.  Her runs in ""Sempre libera"" are neat, articulate, and dead center, and follows an exquisite reading of ""Ah, fors e lui.""  Frank Lopardo, her Alfredo, exhibits a sympathetic understanding of this thankless role, and rewards the spectator with a complete involvement.  The voice itself is quite handsome.  Even Leo Nucci generates fire with the long Act II scene  ""Pura siccome un angelo"" and ""Dite alla giovine"".  Act III pulls out all the emotional and dramatic stops for an overwhelming finale.  But the surprise of surprises is Sir Georg Solti's conducting.  After years of hearing him drive Verdi with the intensity of a late twentieth-century Toscanini, what an unexpected joy to hear this wonderful gentleman lead a performance of great sensitivity and with a laid-back attitude that lets Verdi's lyricism speak with loving non-maudlin sentimentality.  This performance is a must-have, beautifully recorded both visually and aurally.",994204800,9,1662,5.47843137254902
1408941,4,B000059QY3,"One of the seven operas on DVD released in June 2001 by Deutsche Grammophon is a <La Traviata> (071 431-9) from a 1995 Covent Garden production. Here Georg Solti leads the Orchestra and Chorus of the Royal Opera House headed by Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu. Critic/commentator Albert Innaurato calls her ""the most complete Violetta on video."" Now he did not mean the best vocally or even physically or dramatically; but as a whole, she is the most satisfying.
  Where Stratas looks half dead throughout the Zeffirelli film and others simply look too healthy for Act III, Gheorghiu (who, by the way, never had sung this role before!) manages to look fragile at her own party, stunning all in black at Flora's, and ""at death's door"" in her squalid apartment, the walls of which seem to ascend forever toward heaven.
  Tenor Frank Lopardo has some sense of acting his part beyond generalized suffering and is in good voice. The only really jarring notes are the unpleasant makeup of Leo Nucci as the Father and his unpleasant voice, which did not seem to bother the appreciative audience that night. The Gypsy scene, for once, did not work too well, nor did the camping up of the Spanish number, unless one considers it part of the decadence of the world the heroine will soon be leaving.
  The scenery for the first act seemed unnecessarily cramped, a little rest area in Violetta's much larger home; but the unfinished state of the country home was just right. Were those pictures leaning against the wall waiting to be put up or taken away for sale? And the little swatches of wallpaper on the molding were a good touch. The shadows of the carnival revelers through the slats of the Act III scenery was also effective.
  Now and then, the voices would fade away as if too far from a microphone; and then the sound would swell up so suddenly that I kept diving for the volume control. Was this an engineering problem or did it sound like that in the theater? The audience is absolutely silent, keeping applause and cheers for the curtain calls.
  All things considered, this set is very worth having for the Violetta alone.
  The DVD runs 135 minutes in the 4:3 screen ratio with subtitles in English, French, German, and Chinese.",994204800,23,2234,4.714652956298201

1408943,5,B000059QY3,"1994.  Solti at the end of his career; Gheorghiu at the beginning of hers -- she was 29 at the time of this production, and she is a treat to hear and a sight to behold.  The beauty and confidence of her singing and the appropriate expressiveness of her acting are very special, and the scene with Germont tears at the heart as it should.  She has the flexibility for ""Sempre libera"" and the weight and plangency for ""Amami Alfredo."" It's a great assumption of the role.  The cast is strong throughout.  Frank Lopardo, looking (though not quite sounding) like the young Bergonzi, is a positive and forceful Alfredo.  The voice isn't particularly individual, but he sings with security and expression, and he acts the part convincingly.  He takes both stanzas of his Act 2 cabaletta, and he makes them work.  Leo Nucci has rough moments in the singing, but he's an old hand, and he puts it over convincingly.  I've always thought ""No, non udrai rimproveri"" was anti-climactic after ""Di Provenza"" -- but Nucci makes it seem just right.  He was (still is, I think) a fine singing actor.  Solti conducts with fine forward impetus and draws lovely sound from the Covent Garden orchestra.

I see that some reviews get into the Gheorghiu/Netrebko wars -- I haven't heard Netrebko in this role, but assume that she's very fine.  But c'mon . . . there's no need to pick winners and losers here.  This is a great record of a compelling production and a great performance.",1391299200,3,1461,4.65625

1408945,5,B000059QY3,"I lent my copy to two associates who haven't yet accepted opera as a first choice.  After watchiing La Traviata, we added their names to the enthusiastic list.  One plans to drive to the City just t experience the opera house at Lincoln Center.

For me,  There is not a note in the whole opera that I don't know' it is so familiar and soul satisfying.  When my copy is returned, I shall listen to it yet and yet again.",1356393600,,418,4.175
1408946,5,B000059QY3,"This is the recording that turned Angela Gheorghiu into a star virtually overnight and successfully launched her career. It captured the debut performance of La Traviata, not only of the young singer, but also that of the veteran conductor Georg Solti.

Combined with a totally traditional production of the opera by Richard Eyre, sumptuous costumes and sets and a fine recording by the experienced Decca team, this 1994 presentation has long been a benchmark recording and one that is still hard to match, let alone beat.

One could enlarge upon additional features that add to the merits of this recording. Certainly one should mention the quality of the supporting lead roles. Those of Lopardo as Alfredo and Nucci as his father are outstanding with strong characterisation, sure technique and firm voices. The remaining supporting roles are all done very well indeed and the whole opera is conveyed with tremendous dramatic sweep and certainty progressing remorselessly from light to dark.

Not least of all, the production is believable because everyone is of the right age for their parts. This is by no means always true of operas in general, a feature which can crucially undermine the vital `suspension of disbelief' so necessary in all drama.

The recording still remains acceptable within the context of its date. The DTS is good re-processed stereo. The image is 4:3 rather than widescreen. The use of spotlighting in the production, especially in the increasingly dark settings in the second half of the opera, can create harsh lighting and burn-out on light details such as light coloured clothing. This is most apparent on long shots which also lack the sharp definition of today's HD cameras. It is best, therefore, to consider this nowadays as an historic recording in terms of technology. This allows for a great deal more latitude than that which would apply to a new recording.

So as an historic issue this remains justifiably famous because of all its unique and special qualities which conspire to make this a truly memorable occasion. The recording is fully up to the task on those terms. So on those terms again, I am sure that most people would be happy with a 5 star rating for this very special event.

1408947,4,B000059QY3,"This is Gheorghiu's earlier performance of La Traviata..A newer one recorded thireen years later on Blu Ray is available on ArtHaus and is acatually a better buy. The new one has better sound and picture thanks to the Blu Ray process  and the sets in the large party scenes seem more opulent, as the La Scala stage appears larger than the one at The ROH...

In that this performance is thirteen years older than the new one, Gherorghiu, quite naturally, appears somewhat younger and fresher. Her perfformance is very fine vocally and dramatically. The Alfredo of Lopardo is attractive and he sings well and Nucci,appropriately goes from a rather stern, cross, older Germont to a gentle, sympathetic one. The ArtHaus version has Vargas as Alfredo, better sung, but less visually appealing than Lopardo.

The Orchestra is excellent  and the sound is fine, but not as good as the dts high definition on the newer Blu Ray disc,

In the end, I prefer the newer Blu Ray version for it's more expansive party scenes, better picture and sound, not to mention the lower price.",1337385600,,1067,4.808743169398907
1408948,5,B000059QY3,"If the filming of this opera had been botched like many, the DVD would be worth getting just to see and hear Angela Gheorghiu. I see no flaws in this opera and so thankful to have carefully read everyone's review before buying. I have no need to even explore another La Traviata since in my opinion this is perfection and it was ear and eye candy from beginning to end. Here is a woman born to sing this role.",1297641600,2,409,4.189873417721519
1408949,4,B000059QY3,"After Anna Moffo, Angela Gheorghiu is one cold and regal Violetta.  The contrast is jarring.  This is a good production but visually too minimalist for me.  Solti and the orchestra acquit themselves brilliantly.  But Ms. Gheorghiu is so formal and regal, and so cold, that I almost wish I had not bought this DVD, even with the added attraction of the highlights CD. Alfredo is superb, with a resonant voice; Ms. Gheorghiu also has a strong and accurate instrument. The sound overall is very good. But I am spoiled by  Anna Moffo. She is so feminine and spontaneous, unaffected and passionate.  She could be Violetta - she simply does not seem to be acting.  Ms. Gheorghiu, by contrast, is definitely playing a role in an opera. She lacks the emotional authenticity and vulnerability of Ms. Moffo.  As she begins to sing ""Sempre libera, it sounds like she spits out the words, as if she were angry. It's puzzling. But Ms. Moffo sings her heart out, and she has won mine.",1295568000,,970,4.6647058823529415
1408950,5,B000059QY3,"I love opera, but I bought this DVD because of Gheorghiu's debut playing Violetta, and of course, Solti conducting this wonderful Traviata. I own several DVDs with this opera, but she is the best Violetta ever on my DVD collection. Her voice is so beautiful, rich and soft, velvety when needed that you can feel Violetta's love, and power of sacrifice. Huge talent. I also loved her acting. I can't say the same things about the whole Traviata. Lopardo didn't seen to match with Angela. I did not enjoy his acting. Unfortunately, when Alfredo is not the right acting/singing tenor, the whole performance is damaged. Leo Nucci as his father, Giorgio Germont, is a wonderful baritone, with a good acting and overall he almost outshines his son.
My best Traviata would be with 1994 Angela's Violetta from Covent Garden and the rest of the cast would come from Zeffirelli/Domingo Traviata in the small Giuseppe Verdi theater in Buseto, Italy. But that's just a dream...
I recommend this DVD to all opera lovers looking for a wonderful almost historic Violetta.",1243814400,2,1056,4.905027932960894

I was touched [in Act I] when Alfredo speaks his love accompanied by the sweet melody of harp; [in Act II] the poignant moment Violetta struggles to leave her love for Giorgio Germont's sake.
At the end, she's gone in white, peacefully.

This play was profound in 19th century, a patriarchal/Christian society, for the first time a courtesan is made into a theatrical heroine.
I can't help but ponder whether her sacrifice is really a tragedy or a comedy in such setting.

Angela Gheorghiu's voice has characters, even in a high pitch. This is la Traviata you want to collect.",1197504000,2,699,4.816666666666666
1408960,2,B000059QY3,"Please buy the Netrebko's Traviata and after we'll see who is Violetta. In this ROH production Sir Georg Solti and the orchestra are the only important issue. The singers,including sets and costumes contributes to make this Traviata a common one. Gheorghiu always looks and acts nervous and not relaxed at all, the same as in her Elisir with Alagna. The rest of the cast are acceptable in their singing and acting but only that.  The stars are for Sir Georg Solti.

There have been so many fabulous sopranos singing Violetta - my personal favorite is still Anna Moffo. Unfortunately, the film version starring Moffo is lip-synched and her ""Sempre Libera"" is untouchable except for Gheorghiu's. For a singer that had never sung this role before, Angela Gheorghiu is magnificent. I admit having heard so much negative press about her had prevented me from expressing an interest in Gheorghiu's musicianship. Her voice is spectacular and she has wonderful dramatic instincts. The costumes and scenery are perfect - ornate but not overdone. She's a beautiful lady too with ravishing black hair. Gheorghiu like Moffo really physically looks like Violetta. Gheorghiu is completely believable - radiant and vulnerable in the first 2 acts and close to death in Act 3. Matter of fact, I thought she looked absolutely horrible in the death scene. Sound quality and video are outstanding. Hard to believe, Decca was able to accomplish both from a live performance. Tenor Frank Lopardo has a wonderfully handsome voice and sensitive presence. Their voices blend well together and the chemistry between the leads is very strong. The scene in Act I when Alfredo nibbles Violetta on her lower lip as she attempts to resist his kiss is truly seductive. I do disagree with the prior reviewer's comments about Leo Nucci. Nucci is perfect as the disapproving and stern father. This is probably the best live version of ""La Traviata"" on dvd yet.

There are no cinematic effects in this Solti version, but neither is it a ""live"" production -- clearly, it was taped without an audience and then shots of the Covent Garden crowd were spliced in. That's probably just as well, as we get a minimum of interruptions for applause, but be warned if you are expecting a truly spontaneous performance.

I can only echo what has already been said about Georghiu's performance. Unlike the vulnerable, barely-in-control Violetta of Teresa Stratas, she is a queen, commanding every scene she's in (which is most of them). She moves with graceful deliberation and sings with absolute authority. Lopardo is less persuasive as Alfredo -- maybe it's just that he squints too much to convince us that he's the ardent lover -- but the excellent overall direction masks any lack of acting skills. Indeed every bit of stage action in this performance seamlessly advances the story -- there is no sense, as there often is in opera, that the performers are being busy just for the sake of being busy.

It's a pleasure to be able to say that all this technical proficiency does not diminish the emotional impact of the production. Maybe it doesn't quite get the three-hankie rating of Zeffirelli's version, but it certainly gets two, and it perhaps earns them a little more honestly.",1151971200,24,1617,5.387351778656127
1408964,5,B000059QY3,"If there were to be a single performance of Verdi's masterpiece ""La traviata"" on one's dvd shelf, this is it.

Covent Garden rightly decided to downscale the sets to draw the focus on the main characters (with the exception of the third act, which accommodates for the large crowd). It is, as the editorial review dictates, unspectacular. There is no question that this production relies solely on the drama inherent in the music to drive the performance.

Angela Gheorghiu is easily this generation's most captivating soprano. She sings with a confidence and clarity in the upper register that few can boast, and a warm, luscious low register. Her phrasing is intelligent, always conscious of her place in the score. With superb acting skills to boot, she is a force to be reckoned with. Her Violetta is elegant, full of poise and strong integrity (odd, given the nature of the character's reputation as a courtesan), while at the same time vulnerable and sincere in her love for Alfredo. Her rendition of 'sempre libera' is so exhilirating, it will leave one gasping for air.

Frank Lopardo wouldn't be my first choice for Alfredo. He lacks the vocal splendor and prowess of his betters, tending to sound uncomfortably forced in the upper tessitura. Both he and Gheorghiu make a handsome couple, and his fiery denunciation of Violetta toward the end of act three is surprisingly cold and menacing. It's just a shame he doesn't have the voice to back it up. Leo Nucci is Leo Nucci. There are definitely better Germonts out there, but his Italianate sense of authority brings an authenticity to a mostly non-Italian cast (I think I'm quoting the leaflet here, but it's true!).

While Gheorghiu sparkles in this production, the true hero is undoubtedly Sir Georg Solti. The maestro conducts this piece with a delicate touch that is rare even for him. His London players give their all, achieving superb levels of nuance. By producing an eerily 'empty' sound, they brought a sense of unfulfillable longing in the prelude, echoing Violetta's ill-fated romance. While most of Verdi's works are typically laced with doom laden overtones, here it is absent. This is possibly the most intimate of his operas, and Solti's extensive operatic experience shines through with his probing and surprisingly revelatory reading of the score which wrenches the heart through to it's climactic end. When you take his theatrical, and often bombastic approach out of the equation, one is left with a rare, unparalleled beauty that is more than just noteworthy... it's miraculous.",1146096000,9,2559,5.028301886792453

1408968,5,B000059QY3,"I don't know of a ""perfect"" performance of ""Traviata"". This one has been criticized but my experience indicates the pluses far outweigh the minuses. I purchased the DVD because my curiosity was piqued when I learned that the legendary conductor, Sir Georg Solti, had been very impressed with Angela Gheorghiu's ""Violetta"".  The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden venue, et al., also aided in my purchase decision.

My subsequent viewing/listening experience proved to be extremely satisfying (and emotional).  Ms Gheorghiu carried this role with a brilliance of interpretation I have not often noted in other colorature and Solti's sensitive, never-overpowered reading was a complement to her enactment.  She displayed a gift for melding artistically, physically and credibly with this role.  I found her mesmerizing.

The other vocalists carried their roles capably.  Frank Lopardo displayed the passionate, frenetic being of Alfredo and Leo Nucci's Germont was well in keeping with the age fraility of the Alfredo pere not often seen in other baritones who have provided more dominant characterizations. A few have criticized Ms Gheorghiu's Violetta somewhat harshly; some of these are unfair and not substantive for this live event. I believe she ranks among the best-recorded Violettas not only for her outstanding interpretation but also for her symbiosis with the supporting cast.",1139011200,4,1384,5.530805687203792
1408969,3,B000059QY3,"I am amazed at the extreme praise for Gheorghiu's Violetta. She is lovely and intense, and has an interesting voice, but is hardly the greatest Violetta in our memories. Has no one seen the video of Blanca's Violetta from the Bellas Artes with Villazon? You could not possibly view this document and not find Madame Blanca's performance less than Gheorghiu's. For one thing, the Spanish soprano's handling of the music in the first act is infinitely superior in every way. She is fearless in the coloratura, always solid in her pitch and execution, and manages to touch the heart with her desperate bravura in the face of the future she knows will defeat her.

I have heard and seen many famous Violettas, and would certainly rank Blanca's equal to the best. I could not accord this place to Miss Gheorghiu.",1138492800,7,807,4.764285714285714

This production's Alfredo and Germont may not be the best, and orchestra playing, while good throughout the whole opera, does not stand out but that only puts Gheorghiu to the front and righfully so. A star was indeed born that night. She is so young and almost fragile here but it is very clear that she has the makings of a diva of the highest order.

Angela Gheorghiu is not only besutiful to the eye but also to the ear. I feel that she becomes Violetta in this production. Leo Nucci is fine as Germont and Frank Lopardo is excellant also. He even sings the cabaletta before De' miei bellenti spiriti.

1408974,4,B000059QY3,"Alright..this will be short and sweet since Traviata should not be foreign to opera listeners:

Maestro Solti - Omits the traditional cuts of arias that are usually taken.  Excellent conducting of tempi, phrasing and color in most parts.  The introduction to the final act is very sublime and immediately sounds as if a bitter cold walked into Covent Garden.

Leo Nucci - too much wobble for my taste.  There were some notes where he would oversing and in turn it would sound horrible.  His singing in duets with Violetta or with Alfredo would always be hesitant.  Nucci would always be slightly ahead.  His arias sounded pushed and once again had too much wobble.

Lopardo - aside from the terrible costuming (trousers were up to his neck by the third act!) his singing was mediocre.  I have never been a fan of his singing due to the weight that he puts into it.  At some points he sounds like a french baritone.  For the aria ""O Mio Rimorso,"" the tempo was EXTREMELY slow and I almost felt as if he was not going to finish.  His high register has the sound but is missing the ping.  I did not hear a piano at all and by the end of opera the hoarseness in his voice was evident.  The acting... we won't go there.

Gheorghiu - Oh the year was 1994 and a star was born.  Without a doubt the singing was excellent.  Her colour is so different... a lyric coloratura with dark colour.. such a unique mix.  Act I was excellent.  Ah fors e lui.. wonderful sound - Sempre libera ... at some points the pitch was just there but the acting and the look only helped Angela.  She looks great, has the voice and knows how to use her instrument.

DVD is worth solely to see the birth of a star: Angela Gheorghiu.",1110240000,4,1700,4.364217252396166

Georghiu is stunning and just at the moment, my favorite Violetta. The ""almost"" was that she wasn't always spot on -- but so what? This is a live performance and I long for live as opposed to studio; it's the closet I'm going to get to the Real Thing.

The staging is on the spare side, but preferrable to what else is out there as tastelessly fussy. The costume designer outside him-/herself and Violetta is dressed with elegant simplicity -- even her nightgown is more a night shirt and points up how sick she is. And unlike McLaughlin's dying note given at full volume, Georghiu's is (more) believable.)

(As an aside, remember when Zefferelli twitted Callas about that note because she mostly cracked on it? She said: ""I'm DYING, for God's sake.)

1408976,4,B000059QY3,"Este dvd tiene su razon de ser en la interpretacion de Violetta Valery que brinda ANGELA GHEORGHIU. En estas funciones de 1994 la soprano rumana, entonces desconocida, asumio este papel en el Covent Garden bajo la direccion de SIR GEROG SOLTI (que es referencial por cierto) y el exito fue brutal: No es de extraar, ya que a sus geniales medios vocales (voz bella, coloratura facil, piani, fiato....) se une una presencia como actriz con una extraordinaria capacidad para transmitir y emocionar: Su Acto III es realmente de antologia.

Lastima que todo lo demas no este a la altura. El Alfredo de FRANK LOPARDO posee una voz baritonal poco interesante, y esta algo forzado como actor, y el Germont de LEO NUCCI (que en principio deberia de ser de gran calidad) no tiene vocalmente su mejor dia. Competentes (nada mas) los secundarios.

La puesta en escena es bastante tradicional, correcta en conjunto, pero a mi personalmente solo me convence plenamente en el ultimo acto.

She is the finest singing actress I have ever seen.  The whole production is fresh including the sets and staging.  The direction is innovative and I felt that the director wasn't relying on the old tried and true ways of handling this story.  I found myself pulled into each character on the stage.  I even got pulled into the character of Violetta's maid, Annina.  Can you belive that!  She has about five lines if that much, but what the director does for her and each character is perfection.  This is a great ensemble show with great performances from each singer.  You will not be disappointed.  I will watch it over and over and over!!!",1083196800,9,792,4.461538461538462

This is amazing. Angela Gheorghiu is brilliant - she shows everything: radiance, fun, passion, love, drama, despare. She is the most perfect Violetta of our time. Well, she doesn't sing high E flat at the end of the I Act but who cares? Look at her - she has stunning looks and one of the most warmest and beautiful voices I've ever heard. If one takes into consideration the fact that this was her operatic debut, everything I just mentioned is even more unbelievable. Alongside Gheorghiu is the very strong supporting cast: Leo Nucci is one of my favourite baritones and he is at his best. Nothing seems difficult to him, its amazing. Lopardo (Alfredo) has very strong voice, mostly his singing is very good, however at some places I would rather here warmer sound, I would rather believe him more. And finally, Georg Solti's conducting is  great, the orchestra and the chorus is like one, every single detail is worked out and syncronized. So at the end, I should say this is must have DVD. This is Gheorghiu's triumph, this is her night and it is amazing watching her and sharing this precious moment with her.",1075248000,16,1282,4.647577092511013

This is the BEST sung La Traviata, at least on the female side. The often-painfully sung ""Follie... Sempre Libera"" is PERFECTION in beautiful Gheorghiu's hands, sung powerfully without strain or painful-sounding noises, er notes. =)
The only weakness is a somewhat weak, nasally Alfredo. But Frank Lopardo is a great tenor despite this tendency.
The elf-like late Sir Solti was a brilliant masterful conductor.
Sets are minimal, acting is fantastic (as it happens, some of the best actors, like Pavarotti, are poor as actors), the singing is superb.

1408995,5,B000059QY3,"When I first heard the CD version of this opera I thought, that it was good , but certainly not worth all the fuss. Then I saw the DVD and WOW!!! This performance is simply spectacular.  When reviewing this work one must begin with Gheorghiu. She brings Violetta to life in a way that few performers have done before. First of all her singing is divine. She is in total control of her instrument and never falters. Second  she can act an art that is often missing or downplayed in opera today She is seductive in the opening act, tortured and remorseful in the second, and looking very sickly in the final stanza.. Lastly, as many others have said she is very attractive, which is always a plus especially in this role. Too often audiences are saddled with Violettas that are wonderful singers but frankly are not credible as being the object of Alfredo's desire. This is not the case here. Gheorghiu's natural beauty is accentuated by the wonderful costuming. However for those who think that Gheorghiu is all about glamour, look at the final act where her beauty is sacrificed for a very sickly look. The one knock I have against her performance is not attempting to hit the high E at the end of  the Folie! aria in act one. I do not quite understand why she chose to do this. Her voice was in stellar form and she is more then capable of hitting the note. None the less I understand the risk involved and have seen this note skipped on more then one occasion in this opera. However I must say that it  would have been a fine exclamation point on her beautiful rendition of this aria.
As for the rest of the cast, I must agree with one of the other reviewers in saying that a more lyric tenor then Lopardo would have been better. Alagna would be an obvious choice for me given his voice and his ability to compliment Gheorghiu's voice and vice versa. Doming would have been wonderful, however he is too old at this point for the role opposite Gheorghiu. Having said this, Lopardo does a credible job and does not detract from the performance though he is not spectacular. Nucci is fantastic as alfredo's father. His voice is in great form, and his performance is very refined. A wonderful choice for the role.
As for the rest of the production, Solti's conducting was rock solid as usual despite his advanced age. He was deeply involved in the production, and the orchestra showed it. The set was traditional, and the costumes were some of the best I have ever seen.
I must comment briefly here on those reviewers that rank this performance as a one or two star effort. These people are those that dislike Gheorghiu for whatever reason. They will never like anything she does because of a personal dislike for her, rather then the quality of her performance.
All in all this is a must buy.",1061424000,11,2791,4.499013806706114
1408996,4,B000059QY3,I have other DVDs of the opera that I like better. But this one is wonderful.  I enjoyed Gheorghiu's Violetta but the father's voice is just not my favorite.  However I will watch it over and over.  It is a wonderful opera.,1060819200,3,223,4.261904761904762

The performance is of a high quality, the production is fairly traditional and enjoyable, the video and sound quality are top notch (although it's not widescreen).  I gave it an extra fifth star for being as complete as it is.  Even Alfredo's second act cabaletta is repeated, when many performances cut the whole thing.  Gheorghiu is very attractive, which is important in this work, I think.  Why would Alfredo fall for a dog?  Lopardo is good and without as much of the tendency to sharp notes as I have heard from his other recordings and live performances.  Nucci is up to his usual standard, and if you like his timbre (somewhat on the nasal side) you will enjoy his portrayal.  Solti's conducting is solid.  A thouroughly enjoyable set.

But I came home one day and saw this playing on TV, and soon found myself completely enchanted.  I did not move for the next hour.  The sets are absolutely gorgeous, grave and imposing, hightening the emotions of the story, mirroring the luscious and breathtaking score of Verdi's.  I've since seen bits and pieces of other sopranos' renditions of Violetta, yet none have moved me moreso than Gheorghiu, none have come close to capturing the character heart and soul.  The BBC was right to have filmed this production; it deserves to live on.",1047945600,7,663,4.576271186440678
1409010,5,B000059QY3,"Obviously a lot of effort has been put into this production to give this classical work a fresh new look. The set is stylishly simple, worked especially well for the first two Acts. The costumes are sumptuous, especially those of Violetta's. The orchestra is lush and clear. Sir Georg Solti, who is on camera during overture and some of the instrumental passages, leads the music into a world that's extremely touching. But the most distinguished of this production is Angela Gheorghiu, in the role of Violetta. Gheorghiu has brought life to this Verdi's tragic heroine. Her vocal power and beautiful looks have won many of the audience, including me. She is exquisite or even unique in her way of acting, including her facial expression, hand and body gesture, reflecting her deep connection with the character. Her Violetta is full of drama and range, which is everything you'd imagine for this character: her arrogance, her kindness, her weakness, and her vulnerability. Vocally she is very strong. She certainly is one of the greatest sopranos in the world, if not the greatest. It is a joy to watch her singing. Because of all the brilliancies about Angela Gheorghiu, it must be hard to find a tenor who can match her vocal ability and her stage presence at the same time. Frank Lopardo, although with a good tenor voice, is unable to bring any depth to Alfredo due to his limited acting. Other than singing Alfredo's music lines (half the times with his eyes closed), he wasn't trying hard in his acting.
The freshness would be totally succeeded, if not for the staging that still falls into the conventions of its own tradition and some weaknesses in the acting, but still it is a great production, and Gheorghiu can be the only reason to own this DVD.",1045353600,11,1759,4.7894736842105265

Add to it the incomparable Sir Georg Solti, the surprising, but always wonderful Leo Nucci and the amazing music of Verdi and you have a production that cannot be beaten.  Gheorghiu's amazing ability to portray emotion in her face as well as her voice makes her stand out in the opera world.  I get so tired of opera singers who can't act.  Lopardo does a fine job, his voice more than makes up for his acting deficiencies.
It is widely recognized that this performance is what shot Angela Gheorghiu into superstardom and it is well-deserved.  This is a Traviata not to be missed, an amazing interpretation of an amazing work.",1044144000,7,721,4.736
1409012,5,B000059QY3,"This is my favorite video recording of 'La Traviata'.  Lopardo's introduction to the ""Brindisi"" in Act I, and his acting in the fanale, lend a humor and humanity to Alfredo that is rare on the opera stage.  Gheorghiu especially shines an Act II; watch her hands.  With her hands on stage, she could have phoned in the rest of the performance.  This was Georg Solti's last video and his conducting showed a sensitivity that will be the finest testament to his own career.  The sets and costumes are up to the usual high standards of the Royal Opera.",1039046400,3,548,4.551020408163265
1409013,4,B000059QY3,"La Traviata: Surely this one work must have the highest ratio of great songs and recognizable tunes in all of operadom.
This production at Covent Garden stars Angela Gheorghiu as Violetta, Frank Lopardo as Alfredo and Leo Nucci as Giorgio Germont (Alfredo's father). The conductor is Sir George Solti. The camera placement and switching, as well as editing are  well done. The sets were appropriate for the scenes depicted, although the non-party scenes were rather drab and austere. Angela Gheorghiu's dresses were sumptuous and a compliment to her good looks and figure.

I found the opening scene, although well done, rather stiff. It is in the final two acts, however, that the singing and acting ability of the performers comes through. Angela Gheorghiu interpretation of the fatally ill Violetta is nothing short of breath taking. Her use of hand action and facial expressions to augment her mood is extremely well done and conveys the delight or sorrow she's feeling at any given time.
Frank Lopardo has a wonderful voice and acts out a very credible Alfredo. The final scene with him and Violetta is heart wrenching.
The only weak acting performance is that of Leo Nucci as Georgi Germont. He seemed to me to be very stiff, mannequin like, and in a couple spots in the middle act he looks directly at the camera. I find when this happens I lose my sense of involvement in the performance and I'm snapped back into reality: Annoying! (Thus the loss of one star)
The background music of the final act is the epitome of the melody perfectly fitting the mood of the scene that is being preformed. (In this case Violetta last moments before dying)  Angela Gheorghiu' is at her absolute best in this tragic ending and the chemistry between her and Alfredo will touch your heart.
All in all, a magnificent performance.  A La Traviata worth having.",1038700800,9,1848,4.8386075949367084

Everybody who has to be young by libretto is young, Gheorghiu is amazingly pretty and [cute], she signs and looks with sparks in the eyes: she is really Traviata. The production is not just nice performed but perfectly recorded and shows both video and audio quality something of the best available. I do recommend getting this one. I think that everybody who has seen this one would support my opinion that stage decorations and costumes are something that was done with lot of knowledge and artistic vision.

Ms. Gheorghiu has everything Verdi wanted Violetta to look like on stage. She outplays and outsings Teresa Stratas in the film version. The tenor played his role of Alfredo well, but his acting skills are limited. The baritone playing Giorgio Germont (Alfredo's father) appears distracted as he looks at the camera or at the audience. He however, sings his arias beautifully.
Overall, the production is magnigicent recorded in 5.1 channels of pure digital sound. The picture is also perfect. I was glad and sad to see the late Sir. Georg Solti conducting the orchestra with so much passion. He was one of the great conductors of our times together with Jeffrey Tate, Neville Mariner and Karajan to mention few.

1409016,5,B000059QY3,"This gorgeous opera is given a wonderful treatment in this terrific DVD.  Of course, the music is splendid-  probably Verdi's most beautiful score.  For me, the first act is the most perfect 30 minutes of music ever. And it gets its full due here.
This is a filming of the Covent Garden, London show with the, then new, Angela Gheorghiu in 1994.  Now she's a superstar. And this production is one of the reasons why.  She is spectacular as the dying Violetta.  Her tone, acting, and beauty make her unforgettable in this role.  The rest of the cast is also fine.  And it's hard to believe that this was the first time that the venerable George Solti had ever directed ""La Traviata.""  That's amazing.  And, of course, he is wonderful.
As for the DVD itself, the sound (5.1) is perfect, and so is the filming of the production.  The booklet has an OK essay, and a good synopsis of the opera.  It also has a helpful listing of all chapters so you can find a specific place in the score. And, of course, sub-titles.  No extra features, but you rarely find them on opera discs.

In other words, technique and beauty (both physically and vocally) all in one. It is heaven to simply watch her beautiful face and eyes while listening to her flawless, espressive singing. Therefore this DVD is a must for all her fans and opera fans. The covent garden set is beautifully staged and singers acted very well for a live performance. Recording is superb considering it is a live recording with minimal coughs and other stage/audience noise (Actually one of the best, well balanced live recordings I've heard). Beautifully conducted by Solti, especially the prelude to Act III. The other casts are all excellent. Some may want a more lyrical tenor than Lopardo but he sang with great drama and expression. Nucci is warm and sympathetic. Gypsy dance was entertaining. Make-up is great in that Gheorghiu really looked anaemic in Act III.

The staging and sets are dull, and apart from having a world-class soprano and certain aspects of her technique (technique alone) ... the production is essentially below the level of what you would find at any (professional) opera company anywhere. (That is, if we don't take into consideration the Eurotrash stagings ... otherwise this one becomes stupendously exemplary in the mix.)

The main problem is that Violetta and particularly Alfredo have no emotion or chemistry in this production, it's as if they were set up on a blind date and had to go through the motions due to contract. They sing all the correct notes but it's just cold and manufactured. Alfredo does not come across as particularly naive or nerdy, or particularly anything--he just sings. Violetta does not appear the least vulnerable nor unhinged. In fact, she appears nothing but (pointlessly) normal.

Now as to staging. Again, it's a traditional staging but honestly the least interesting I've ever seen. The interior of Violetta's home in Act I looks like--how can one describe it?--sort of like the anteroom to a posh bomb shelter. The normally charming country villa of Act II looks like an old deserted warehouse. No wonder alternate stagings have taken hold, if this is being promulgated as the greatest Traviata out there.

I might not have minded the set decoration, or even noticed, if the acting was up to par. But the only attempt at acting was Alfredo's glued-on grimace in the casino, like a silent movie villain. I would say that was the most embarrassing low point of the show.

The costumes throughout were very nice. Leo Nucci as Germont was excellent, and Solti was excellent. For Traviata though, you need Violetta and Alfredo.

Consider three other Traviatas on DVD, more recommendable:

Even with an accompanying cast of unknowns, even with video and audio not up to today's standards, Wolf Trap easily beats the Gheorgiu/Lopardo production in terms of pure musical enjoyment, drama, even set design.

The purpose of this review is not to offend, it's only to provide an opinion for those who want one. I believe there are people looking to buy a Traviata DVD and maybe don't want to buy every one out there.",1406160000,5,2944,5.796296296296297
