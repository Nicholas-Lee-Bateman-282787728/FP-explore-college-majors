7771382,5,B01GX8ZONU,"The 50's episodes are amazing for their pure artistry, imagination, heart, surreal creativity and kinesthetic action. The first volume of the 60's added a new dimension of humor and clever story telling to go along with the art and creativity that makes this clay animated series so timeless. This second half of the 60's continues this tradition, and adds another fun twist with Professor Kapp, Dr. Zveegee, Nopey, and more of Prickle, Goo and the Blockheads. In this set, Gumby and Pokey explore many unique fun adventures that are not to be missed. The music is classic late 60's and the sound effects are awesome. These gems show for the first time the details of the sets and art in this show. These 40 episodes in Vol. 2 are a great way to round out your 60's collection. They are fully re-mastered from their original camera rolls for the first time ever, and they have their original soundtracks in tact. The new generation of kids deserve to enjoy these timeless Gumby adventures. The special features include a never seen 60's Gumby song, interviews with the late 60's crew, the rare ""Clay Peacock"" art film, a photo gallery with rare behind the scenes shots and the late 60's ""bumpers"".  Inside this box are also both the ""J"" and ""G"" Blockhead bendables.  This is an amazing set!",1473033600,3,1290,4.728888888888889

7771384,3,B01GX8ZONU,"I reviewed ""1960's Vol. 1"" and gave it a recommendation, but a lot of that had to do with the fact that I personally love the early 1960's Gumby shorts. This set continues where ""1960's Vol. 1"" left off, which was during a time when Art Clokey was very much absent from the production of new Gumby shorts. While these are still enjoyable, the stories contained within this set don't have as much depth or creativity as the shorts from the 1950's, or early 1960's shorts in which Dallas McKennon voiced Gumby.

While no listing here or from NCircle Entertainment confirms a complete episode listing, I have found this set available to buy digitally on iTunes. Just like ""1960's Vol. 1"" had 2 episodes missing, it looks like ""1960's Vol. 2"" will have 3 episodes missing. This set should have the episodes ""Gold Rush Gumby"", ""Indian Country"" and ""The Indian Challenge"", but they are not included.

It appears NCircle Entertainment, Premavision, the Clokeys, and everyone invloved with these DVD's don't think that collectors, or adults who grew up watching Gumby are part of the target market for these DVD's. If they did, they would not skip over episodes for any reason whatsoever.

In the 1960's, people had different opinions about ethnic stereotyping than people do today. These cartoons were made in the 1960's. Do I think the episodes skipped over may be offensive to Native Americans? I'm sure some would find them offensive. Do I think it solves the problem to pretend these stereotypes never existed? No, because that would be censorship. There are ways to work around it. Companies like Disney, Warner Bros. and Universal have used disclaimers to warn people about the content they are going to see on DVD's of their old animated shorts. There is no reason a disclaimer like that couldn't be used here.

For anyone who does want ALL 1960's Gumby episodes, all the episodes missing on this set and ""1960's Vol. 1"" were released on VHS by Family Home Entertainment in the 1980's. The VHS tapes you will need are ""Gumby's Holiday Special"", ""Gumby for President"", ""Doggone Gumby"" and ""The World According to Gumby"". These will have to do until we are finally given a COMPLETE collection of Gumby shorts on DVD.",1471392000,29,2214,4.83377308707124
7771385,5,B01GX8ZONU,nice to see these old gumby cartoons again excellent,1490227200,,52,4.888888888888889
7771386,3,B01GX8ZONU,"There are 5 episodes that were skipped over on the 1960's volumes. These episodes are ""Siege of Boonesborough"", ""Pokey's Price"", ""Gold Rush Gumby"", ""Indian Country"" and ""The Indian Challenge"". Us fans want to see those as well!!! They are a part of history which even Whoopie Goldberg said should be shown despite what may, or may not be said about them. Other cartoons have been released (Popeyes ""Scrap the Japs"", ""Your a Sap Mr Jap"", plus other cartoons series). Not sure why you would omit these. Its not a complete collection without them. There are other shows and movies available on DVD which are much more ""controversial"".",1485993600,2,631,4.906542056074766

7771388,5,B01GX8ZONU,"Although I was a child of the late 80s/early 90s, Gumby was still a part of my childhood growing up, thanks to re-runs. So when I discovered the old cartoon was getting released on DVD, I knew I had to have it. And popping in just one of the two discs instantly brought back a ton of memories for me.

I'm sure everyone in the world has seen at least one Gumby cartoon at some point, but for the un-initiated, Gumby is a young boy made out of clay, who lives with his mom and dad in a timeless fantasy world where anything is possible. Along with his best friend, a red/orange horse named Pokey, he spends his time exploring the world; helping the various characters he meets, and having adventures; many of them via literally jumping into books in the library. From Toyland, to the Old West, to outer space, every episode is only limited by your imagination!

This DVD release is pretty nicely put together, with all the episodes unedited, and cleaned up to today's standards of picture quality. There's a few issues with the overall picture and sound, depending on the episode, but considering how old this series is, it's to be expected. That's a fault of the age, not the DVD. After loving the first DVD set of all the 50's shorts, we now get into the second half of the 60s, and see Goo, Professor Kapp, Nopey the dog, and Prickle the dinosaur. . All the included episodes are cute, innocent, and charming; sometimes teaching valuable lessons--other times just taking the viewer on a surreal experience. But simply put, they don't make cartoons like this anymore.

Unlike the first two sets, there's plenty more special features this time around.  Included is ""The Clay Peacock""--a silent short set to some groovy music that's pure surrealism and animation for animation's sake; a photo gallery, the ""Have a Heart"" Gumby song; a never before seen Gumby song; a couple bumpers that played during the commercial breaks on TV, and best of all, a short featurette with interviews from the many different animators who worked on the show and how working on Gumby helped kick start their careers in the film industry.

If you loved (and still love) Gumby, this is a must have set to get. And even if you're a brand new viewer, you can dive into any episode and not be lost. In comparison to today's television, which seems to have fast paced shows with nothing but talking, this series is far more quiet and laid back in it's delivery, and allows the viewer to breathe and soak in the world, and run away with their creativity. It's one of the most unique and imaginative shows ever created, and I strongly recommend it to kids and families everywhere.",1477785600,4,2651,4.608050847457627

7771391,5,B01GX8ZONU,"Fifty years ago, before computer animation, we had hand drawn animation and stop motion animation. The Adventures of Gumby: The 60s Series Volume 2 not only contains spectacular stop motion animation, but also has fantastic and fun adventures that kids and adults of all ages can greatly enjoy.

This series is meant to be an adventure but it doesnt hold back on humor and will make you laugh time and again. It also has some mild action and even a slight bit of intensity, but nothing to be too concerned about. Even those intense scenes are full of light and good nature.

Each episode focuses on a different story. Some may focus on an adventure into a dinosaur world or into space or even into a micro world where germs live. Each episode follows Gumby and his friends and what happens during their adventures while teaching kids some valuable information. Most episodes have some sort of moral message and, since there isn't a continuing, viewers can watch at any point of the series and understand what is going on. I enjoy the fact that, despite most of it being pretty fantasy-like, it intertwines actual science and real-world knowledge to the point where I found myself learning stuff about economics, which was a pleasant surprise!

My favorite episode is Shady Lemonade. In this one, Gumby and his friends go to a lemonade place and discover that the owner scammed them. Later that day, they save a mans cat and the man gives them a very large reward. They decide to use that money so people can get lemonade at a cheap price and not worry about getting scammed. I picked this episode because, despite it not have some fun adventure, it is still a unique and fun story which kept me entertained. On top of that, the moral of the story is great  for every action there is a reaction, just like it shows in Shady Lemonade.

The Adventures of Gumby: The 60s Series Volume 2 has so much to love about it. Stop motion animation is sadly a dying art and, in this series, you see what makes it so fantastic. This is an art form that has more of a human touch. In hand drawn animation, you draw pictures with pen and paper. In computer animation, you type on a keyboard. With stop motion, you physically touch the characters and alter them at will. On top of that, the voice acting is wonderful as are the songs. There is some background music in many episodes, which isn't too noticeable but adds to the flow of the show. Despite it being over 50 years old, I still greatly enjoyed it and laughed throughout every episode. I also admire the series because its creators don't ever talk about morals or try to explain them, but you still learn a good lesson from the fun, easy-going stories.

This series is designed for kids and parents have nothing to worry about. I recommend it for ages 4 to 18. I believe adults will enjoy this show too, even though it is a kids show, because it sparks your imagination and its out of this world stories will make you laugh. For spectacular stop motion animation, wonderful voice acting, fantastic songs and perfect stories, I give it 5 out of 5 stars.

7771392,5,B01GX8ZONU,"This is a fantastic set/as well as a claymation show. Contains the remaining 42 episodes of the 60s series. However, four episodes are missing due to the fact they may be racist/or other, they include, ""Pokey's Price"", ""Gold Rush Gumby"", ""Indian Country"", and ""Indian Challenge."" This set also includes the two bendable Blockheads J & G, they about 4"" inches tall. Also, as a special feature ""The Clay Peacock,"" is included along with Have a Heart Gumby Theme song (animated), a never before seen Gumby song, interviews of 60s crew and bumpers.

This volume cracks me up because they seem to go out of their way to find a way to make puns at the end of each episode. The special features are also pretty rad because you get to see the commercial bumpers, a song that was never used, interviews with some of the animators, and the original theme song! This series is so great and I am very much looking forward to the 80s installments.",1474329600,2,560,4.1

8764283,1,B01GX8ZONU,"This travesty, like Volume 1, is an incomplete set. Three episodes are missing because they do not conform to NCircle/Premavision's opinions about how people should think. They would rather whitewash history rather than allowing viewers to decide for themselves and enjoy ALL of the original episodes. Thankfully I have these episodes from the Australian box set, which was not viciously bowdlerized in this manner. Go check them out on YouTube, where you can be trusted to form your own opinions. You'll see the Indians are like the Indians were -- savage at times, friendly at others. But truth doesn't stand a chance against modern-day revisionism.",1515801600,2,651,5.20952380952381
