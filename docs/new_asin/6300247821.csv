273072,4,6300247821,I've seen some reviews that compare this to Raiders Of the Lost Ark.  I actually like this better.  Kathleen Turner plays a romance novelist who's sister gets kidnapped in South America.  She goes there and meets Michael Douglas who agrees to help her for a price.  The movie has action adventure suspense romance and comedy.  A little bit of everything.  It has a supporting role by Alfonso Arau who made this and The Three Amigos pretty close together.  I don't know how many people know this but he was one of them ain bad guys in The Wild Bunch.,1516838400,,549,4.484848484848484

273268,1,6300247821,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. It alternates between lame and vulgar. I quit about 2/3 of the way through. Everything I watched was terrible. There is nothing funny that happens. The characters are totally unlikable,  the show is vulgar, and none of the ""action"" or even ""adventure"" that I saw was even remotely interesting. I haven't got the foggiest idea how this movie is so well liked. I guess people in the 80s were desperate for Indianna-Jones-like action. I challenge you to find anyone who watched this movie for the first time recently who actually thinks it's good.

And how in the freak did this get a PG rating? There's a clearly-visible naked breast in the first scene. There's a part where a man dives into a woman's crotch and they just sit there enjoying it. I turned it off after a scene where the naked man is lying on the naked woman and very little is left to the imagination. I read about this stuff on the IMDB parents' guide, but what sounds relatively innocuous in writing is much more erotic and vulgar in actual execution.",1503446400,,1047,4.654054054054054
273269,5,6300247821,Romancing the Stone and the sequel The Jewel of the Nile are entertaining and show that Michael Douglas is a good at playing both serious action and humorous characters. He and Turner work well together.,1503446400,,203,4.828571428571428

273554,4,6300247821,"Some of the best movies out there are the ones that don't stick to a single genre (action, romance, adventure, comedy, etc.) but blend elements from several.  Movies like ""RED,"" the ""Indiana Jones"" series, and others give us multiple things to enjoy -- rollicking adventure, funny moments to lighten the tension, a sweet romance that doesn't hijack the story, etc.  And while on the surface, ""Romancing the Stone"" looks like an Indiana Jones ripoff, it's actually a fun contemporary adventure in the jungle, complete with a fish-out-of-water heroine, a lovable scoundrel, a sinister villain, a priceless treasure, and a lot to smile about.

""Romancing the Stone"" stars Kathleen Turner as Joan Wilder, a romance writer who's shy and single despite her success.  When Joan gets a call from her sister, who was kidnapped while searching for her husband's killer, she sets off to Columbia to pay her ransom with an ancient treasure map.  After taking the wrong bus and nearly getting killed by the military police, she ends up in the company of American smuggler Jack (played by Michael Douglas), who's disgusted at being saddled with this naive woman but agrees to help her when she offers to pay him.  As they set off through the Colombian jungle, pursued by the kidnappers (one of whom is hilariously played by Danny DeVito) and a sinister military officer who wants the treasure map for himself, the two find themselves falling in love, even as they set out to retrieve the treasure, a priceless stone simply called El Corazon, and save Joan's sister...

This film is a lot of fun, filled with exciting action sequences and slapstick humor that's funny without being overly crude.  The actors are clearly enjoying themselves, and watching Joan flounder through the unfamiliar world of South America will make you giggle and, at the same time, empathize with her character.  Jack starts out as a selfish scoundrel, but both he and Joan see gradual character development as the film goes by, with Joan finding her own inner strength and Jack growing to care for someone other than himself.  The villainous Colonel Zolo is a fairly one-dimensional villain, but the kidnappers, as secondary villains, are actually likable characters who are shown to not be complete scumbags.  And the character of Juan, a drug lord who turns out to be an unexpected fan of Joan's work, is a hilarious one-scene wonder who makes the film memorable.

There are some uncomfortable-to-watch scenes in this film, especially towards the very end.  I was NOT expecting this film to suddenly get gory, and while it's only one scene, it's a squicky one.  Be warned...

Usually a film that tries to please everybody ends up ultimately pleasing nobody... but ""Romancing the Stone"" is one of those rare films that can appeal to just about anybody.  Whether you're here for the Indiana-style adventure, the humor, or the love story, you're bound to enjoy this film.  Just skip the sequel...",1478736000,,2957,4.9655172413793105

273725,5,6300247821,"This is a 1980's movie, I believe.  The 1980's was a good decade for me.  This movie was delightful when I saw it in the theater.  That said, I think it is still delightful to me because it reminds me of that era.  The characters have good chemistry.  It is a simple romantic comedy that is not mushy.  I hate mushy.  Michael Douglas was a fox back then and Kathleen Turner was a sexy little number herself.  Kathleen Turner's character is a lonely Romance Novelist who lives in New York and believes one day she will find a man just like her fictional characters do in her romance novels.  One day, she  gets a call from her sister who has been kidnapped in Colombia. She goes down to rescue her, meets Michael Douglas in a crazy and hilarious way--and they have some adventures together trying to save her sister.  By the way, Michael's character is not helping out of the goodness of his heart--he is doing it for money--$375 in Traveler's Checks, to be exact.  Kathleen's character has promised him that for his aid.  The two are bickering a good deal of the time--but the ending is delightful, as I have already said.  It is a fun little flick.  Not academy award, earth shattering, but it does your heart good.",1466035200,,1216,4.463636363636364

273945,4,6300247821,"One of the great classics of the cannon, 1984 brought us one of the first action / romance / comedy movies that redefined a genre, launched Kathleen Turner into stardom, Danny Devito as one of the best side kicks in movie history, proved Michael Douglas could be a successful leading man, and gave Robert Zemeckis his first great success.  The plot is a rather delightful and thinly veiled romance novel with people dodging bullets, chasing through the jungle on a desperate quest, and all rather exotic.

Kathleen Turner stars as Joan Wilder, a rather timid, dowdy romance novelist who is living a comfortable life in New York City.  One day she gets a package from her recently deceased brother-in-law from Columbia, mailed just before his untimely death, and comes home to find her apartment ransacked.  When her sister calls shortly after, she informs her that she is being held hostage by parties who want the treasure map her brother-in-law sent her.  She needs Joan to bring the map to her in Columbia so that the kidnappers will set her free.  So with much determination and absolutely terrified, Joan sets off to Columbia to deliver the map.  She unknowingly is tricked into taking the wrong bus which crashes deep in the jungle.  When the evil force, Zolo, reveals himself and when he attempts to mug Joan for the map, she is rescued by a mysterious stranger who appears out of nowhere.  Once Zolo is chased off, Joan hitches her wagon to her rescuer, Jack T Colton, to help take her to the capital city to rescue her sister.  The two embark on a jungle adventure with many screwball comedy antics and narrowly escaping Zolo as he attempts to track down Joan and the map.  Danny Devito supplies perhaps some of the best comedy antics and monologues of his career as the hapless kidnapping sidekick who is also attempting to find Joan as Zolo directed her to get on the wrong bus so he was unable to collect the map from her, and dealing with his equally haphazzard cousin, Ira, as he holds Joan's sister hostage.

The chemistry between Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas in this movie is fantastic, and it's rather hysterical to see how she has met the man she has been writing about in her romance novels, a swashbuckling, arrogant, rugged Jesse, right before her and can't stand him when she meets him.  She plays the timid perfectly as she is up against incredible odds and has no idea how to get through it, relying on Jack's knowledge and mountain man street smarts to get through the jungles and dealing with the locals as she is the proverbial fish out of water.  The little side story of meeting the drug lord Juan in a small town who just happens to be a fan of Joan's books who helps them escape Zolo and the military police with his little mule, Pepe.  Danny Devito provides much comic relief as he is also bumbling to find Joan through the jungle as he is also the city boy trying to navigate his way through rough terrain.  Ultimately, there are many confrontations and rescues, as women start swooning over Jack for his swashbuckling antics and he and Joan will fall for each other (which you knew would happen from the beginning), Joan's sister is rescued, and we all live happily ever after.  This movie has held up well over the years without being the slightest bit dated (save for a few technology issues and perhaps a haircut or two) as it speaks to classic themes in many movies - the hero rescuing the damsel in distress, good verses evil, rooting for the underdog, etc.  The added aspect of the romance between Joan and Jack is not cheesy in any way, they find each other in a moment of extreme and both win at the battle as well as realize their love for each other.  And quite honestly, who wouldn't fall for a guy like Jack after a while?  Adventurous, rugged, a bit of a scoundrel, just what women really want.  The trio aspect of Devito, Turner and Douglas is actually quite exciting with him coming in as the third wheel - not as a romantic rival to Jack, but someone who will cause trouble.  Wonderful for a night in.",1454284800,,4058,4.568275862068965

274522,4,6300247821,"Romancing the Stoneis a 1984 American action-adventureromantic comedy. Directed byRobert Zemeckis, it starsMichael Douglas,Kathleen TurnerandDanny DeVito. The film was followed by a 1985sequel,The Jewel of the Nile.

The film earned over $86,572,238 worldwide inbox-officereceipts. It also helped launch Turner to stardom, reintroduced Douglas to the public as a capable leading man, and gave Zemeckis his first box-office success. Decades later, it retains critical acclaim, with an 87% approval rating onRotten Tomatoes.

The Plot in Romancing the Stone is  not the most intricate, but for what it lacks in complexity it makes up for with charm, Humor and wit. For a Film that's rated PG it has some racy material, like stabbings and a pinch of sexual humor, but nothing too extreme, i just feel it is too much for children under 11. The beginning of the Film is the best 10 minutes of the Film, it is almost impossible to turn way from the Film at this point as it perfectly presents the problems that must be solved. The final act is predictable, but that is not such a bad thing in this case.

The Cast is great as well. Michael Douglas does a great job here and his chemistry with Kathleen Turner comes of as charming. Kathleen Turner has the show from the beginning and never gives it away. Danny DeVito is obviously in this Film to provide the most comic and he does a great job of it in this Movie.

Production for the Movie is also a high - point  of this Film as it is mostly set in exotic locations in South America.

What makes Romancing the Stone stand out so much from other movies in its Genre is its light hearted Ness, it has adventure but I would still consider it more of a romance. The main characters of the Film all have something they need to gain and the Conflicts that arise from that notion are very interesting to watch, this a very entertaining Film.",1412121600,,1879,4.658610271903323

274585,1,6300247821,"To simply sum it up, this is a very bad movie.  The first thirty minutes so are boring that it's hard to sit through.  When the story does finally get going (kind of), it's still pretty much impossible to tell what the point is.  After another fourty-five minutes of bad acting and minimal plot development, you come to the exciting part when they follow a treasure map.  The follow it for all of three minutes, literally.  The movie then finishes without ever actually developing who most of the characters are, where the treasure map came from and what the treasure actually is.  This is pretty much an Indiana Jones movie minus everything good.",1405728000,2,647,4.68141592920354

274634,3,6300247821,"Never seen it before.

I was planning on seeing it at the SF Castro theater as part of a ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" ""Romancing the Stone"" double feature,  but I had seen TOD in the last year and so decided to just catch this on instant video.

I mention this because this movie is often compared to Indiana movies, I believe they were contemporaries.

The Indiana movies are just better. There isn't much to say, it is just true.

I think the part that bugged me the most was how much of an ass Mr. Douglas was through the entire film. His behavior really stands out when compared to the ""modern"" dynamics of movie couples. It is kind of fun to watch as a sort of snapshot of history. You ask yourself ""Is this how men wished they could behave? Is this how women wished men behaved? Or is this just how movie romances worked at the time?""

 It is kind of strange, you can identify so easily where the character diverges from what a man ""should"" be (according to modern cinema), and yet in 30 years, our leading man may be as different from 2014 leading man as he is from this 1984 leading man. Just an observation.

Anyway, yeah, you could do worse. It has its moments. It is funny at times. It has a romantic foundation that never really takes off, but at least does not get in the way. The woman is beautiful, and has a voice that for some reason I enjoyed hearing (a little deeper than usual). Michael Douglas is as usual pretty good.

You might enjoy it, but you probably won't love it.",1400889600,,1502,4.279151943462898

They should have stopped at one or waited for a better script.  we certainly deserved better in terms of a storyline, plot and the actors deserved better material.

thank goodness they survived and went on to participate in greater works.",1400284800,,354,4.85
274638,5,6300247821,"We loved this movie when it came out, and it stands the test of time really well. Just a fun, family friendly film.

274660,4,6300247821,"I originally bought Romancing The Stone on DVD about 10 years ago. That version was the non-anamorphic 2.35 widescreen version. The non-anamorphic wasn't a big deal to me since I was watching it on a 4x3 TV at the time. But for people with widescreens, they got stuck with black bars on top/bottom and grey bars on left/right. At the time, the DVD was light years better than the 1.33 TV version with it's commercials.

I've always liked Romancing The Stone for many reasons. It's a fun story. It has good characters. The right blend of adventure and comedy. And it has lush forestry scenes that look good on anybody's TV.

2014, I decided to pick this up on Blu Ray. Obviously the anamorphic transfer is better now that everybody including me has a widescreen TV. But more to the point, when I did an A/B comparison of the old DVD vs the new Blu Ray, this was a case where the new Blu Ray really does shine.

I felt the same way watching it again. I remember being on edge hearing the eerrie music that sounded like a swarm of bees that increasing the tension during showdown over the stone near the ending. I laughed out loud the second time Douglas's character hurls the suitcase. LOL. Anyway it is an entertaining fun movie.

274784,5,6300247821,"Wow!!

A great 1984 action adventure that can easily compared to Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981), except that it has more heart, there are no Nazis (in fact, with the thrust-together spoiled entertainment queen/adventurer combo it's more like a much improved version of Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom, ironically also released in 1984).

The film starts off with a fantasy scene from the pages of unlucky-in-love romance writer (no men in her life, but her cat is named Romeo) Joan Wilder. Great, cheezy dialogue: ""That was the end of Grogan, the man who murdered my father, raped my mother and sister, burned my ranch, shot my dog and stole my Bible."" Great mud-slide scene with Michael Douglas landing in the swamp face-down between Kathleen Turner's legs. Wow. Nice arguments between Douglas and Turner. ""You're a mondo-dismo. A man who takes money from stranded women!"" Great scene in the smugglers' crashed plane (Grateful Dead t-shirt, mummified pilot, keys for the fire, old newspaper, ""Oh no - the Doobie Brothers broke up!""). Hilarious drug smuggler village scene, the head smuggler has all of Joan Wilder's books, big smiles on all the hard-ass faces. ""Juanita!!"" To Michael Douglas: ""Get the door."" Lupe's escape river jump. ""I can go no further - after this village I am a wanted man!""

Great movie, wonderful how Kathleen Turner saves the day more often than Michael Douglas does. Also like how Turner starts off the film dowdy and buttoned-up, but then gets looser... and hotter. Too bad the music is just so horribly awful, though. Danny De Vito is wonderful, calling his cousin Ira ""bullet-head.""

I learned that the screenplay was by one Diane Thomas, a Malibu waitress who died in a car crash shortly after the film's release. Tough break. Comparisons to Raiders Of The Lost Ark were inevitable in 1984, although the screenplay was actually five years older (and is probably the better film in an acting sense - Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas nearly get equal screen time, and she's just as much a heroic figure as he is, doing all the same stunts, and dispatching the bad guy on her own - Douglas has trouble scaling a rock wall and arrives too late to help her, ha ha ha...).

This DVD contains nearly 20 minutes of deleted scenes, but nothing special there. There are also scenes from some sort of useless agent that Joan Wilder has, he doesn't appear in the final movie at all.",1371254400,,2409,4.795180722891566

Kathleen Turner does shy hermit, sultry babe and resourceful adventuress with aplomb; Michael Douglas gives a funny, devil-may-care, hot take on the typical romance-novel hero.  There are cheesy and menacing villains and clear threats to the happiness of our heroes.  Kidnapping! Murder! Deceit! Sex! Treasure!  All good fun.  As far as the blu-ray itself, the transfer looks great.  The jungle scenes are particularly grand.  The sound effects probably could have used a little updating; the weapons sounded very odd to my ears, as if it was obvious the (really fake) bangs and impacts were added in post.  One scene had the critical subtitle included; but other scenes did not have subtitles.

Our daughter is obsessed with vampire movies (you know the ones), but really loved ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Love Actually"" (and yes, I know a 14 year old shouldn't be watching a movie that contains nudity - but we weren't home when she decided to watch it).  Everyone loves Indiana Jones.  So I suggested ""Romancing the Stone.""  Turns out my husband had never seen it, my daughter had never heard of it - - but it's not on Netflix!  Of course Amazon had it in stock, and for the bargain price of $8.45 we got it in 3 days.  Husband loved the action, daughter loved the comedy and romance.  Son decided he'd rather play Pokemon.  Ah, well, you can't please everyone!",1348531200,,913,4.484848484848484
274924,4,6300247821,"What fun! An adventure story with as much amusement value as Indiana Jones but without the overwhelming pace. And in 1984, Michael Douglas was at least as sexy as Harrison Ford. Well, almost.

Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) is a romance novelist who has never really had a romance. She's looking for some sort of ideal, basically a knight in shining armor. Then she gets involved in a real adventure, and writes her very best book as a result.

Joan's sister Elaine was in Columbia trying to find out who had killed her husband, chopping him up into many pieces. The same day she called to ask for Joan's help, Joan had received a large envelope in the mail from her brother-in-law, probably the last thing he did before he died. In fact, she hadn't even opened it yet when her sister called. The envelope contained a treasure map, and Elaine had been kidnapped to get the map. Joan was to bring it to Columbia to ransom Elaine.

Of course, absolutely everything that could go wrong does, but in the process of trying to cope, Joan meets Jack T. Colton (Michael Douglas), who agrees to help her get to where she's supposed to meet the kidnappers in exchange for $375 in American Express Traveler's checks. But there are lots of people chasing her, and apparently some are also chasing Jack, so it gets very, very complicated.

One of the people chasing them is Ralph (Danny DiVito), one of the kidnappers who had been sent out to meet Joan at the airport and get her on the right bus, and when she takes the wrong bus, he has no option but to follow her. Poor Ralph has even more problems than Joan and Jack.

I'm not going to ruin it with giving away details. I'm just going to warn you to watch for my favorite line in the whole movie, when Jack says, ""Yeah, that's what I call a campfire!"" I would agree wholeheartedly that I would have liked to have shared that fire with them.

It's a lot of fun, really. And it ends happily ever after.",1336780800,,1940,4.435393258426966

I watched the movie just last night for the first time (I know I am 28 years late). This movie never played in my country and I never came across it on TV and was never on my radar for rental. I picked it up due to its economical price and positive reviews.

Overall, it is a very good comedy adventure movie that reminisces the 80s. It has some flaws and parts that seem a little corny and it is predictable but then again, if one ignores such little flaws when viewing a fun, adventure flick, one will enjoy Romancing the Stone.",1333497600,4,787,4.383561643835616

274985,4,6300247821,"Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) is a successful writer of romance novels--17 of them to date, all apparently of the bodice-ripper school--and a hopeless flop at men, unless you count her red-calico cat Romeo.  Her editor, Gloria (Holland Taylor), worris about her love life, but Joan seems content with fantasy guys who can serve as the heroes of her books.  Then her sister Elaine (Mary Ellen Trainor), whose Colombian husband Eduardo was recently murdered, is kidnapped by one (Zack Norman) of two rather nasty guys who are searching for a priceless jewel, El Corazon, to which Eduardo somehow acquired a map--which Elaine mailed to Joan.  Now Joan must go to Colombia, with the map, to ransom her sister.  She's scarcely found herself menaced by the other villain (Manuel Ojeda) of the piece than she's bailed out by seedy American fortune-hunter Jack T. Colton (Michael Douglas), who agrees to guide her to safety.  Since Joan has very definite ideas about what constitutes ""a real man,"" and Jack is mostly interested in getting his money and keeping his skin in one piece, they're soon fighting like cats and dogs.  It takes a while for either of them to realize exactly what, besides Elaine's life, is at stake and what to do about it.  Yet as their quest proceeds they grow on each other, and before you can say ""naked bodies and frigates"" each is willing to sacrifice life for the other.

There's obviously more than a little of Indiana Jones in Jack, and though Joan is definitely a big-city girl, she manages a pretty fair imitation of Marion Ravenwood when it becomes necessary.  There's also a good deal of humor, especially when Jack and Joan stumble into a village of drug-runners only to discover that the boss of the place (Alfonso Arau) has read every one of Joan's books.  Parents should note that there's one rather gross scene in which a crocodile bites off a villain's hand (Captain Hook, anyone?).",1305331200,,1917,4.834862385321101

I hate the fact that her career has become what it has become, but I will always remember how she rocked the world for an entire decade pulling out one great performance after another; and how versatile she was!  `Romancing the Stone', believe it or not, was my first dance with Miss Turner, and I never looked back since.  She is funny and charming and dramatically layered in every scene, fleshing out a potential stock character in a potential `popcorn muncher', creating an iconic character that remains on the minds of many.  The plot is zany and chaotic, but it is pulled together nicely by the cast and a focused directorial hand.

274989,4,6300247821,"After 26 long years, I just viewed this gem of a movie on blu-ray disc.  Besides the occasional showing of this much beloved flick on cable, I finally was able to enjoy it in its entirety.  All the wonderful memories came flooding back in high definition detail - from the window tassels that adorned the beat-up transport bus in Latin America to the - get this - the ""Pan Am"" shoulder bag that was resting in the shabby vehicle that Danny DeVito was napping in.

Considering its vintage, the transfer to 1080p is quite respectable, though it will not knock your socks off in terms of clarity like some of the more top-notch blu-rays available on the market these days.  The only portion of the film that seems to suffer from clarity the most, is when atmospheric scenes are shot at its darkest, with a minimal of lighting.  Towards the latter part of the film when its climax draws towards its conclusion, is when it is most notable, especially in distance shots.

Though I am not a true audiophile, I have read that the movie's soundtrack could be better rendered.  However, to my novice ears, I was reasonably pleased with the results and did not discern any negligible drop-offs in sound quality.  Everything from the saxophone-drenched soundtrack highlighting the movie's love theme to the sultriness of Kathleen Turner's voice was quite audibly perceptible.

In conclusion, the light-hearted romantic chemistry that forms the bond between a young & vivacious Kathleen Turner and a play it by the collar adventurist Michael Douglas exudes the pure magic that propels this film throughout, over and over again.  With a tremendous supporting role from Danny DeVito, the excellently timed humor just continues to delight from this Robert Zemeckis gem.

The picture & sound quality is satisfactory enough to please the true fans of this film that have been aching so long to view it in its original theatrical release all those summers ago - 26 of them, to be precise.",1292630400,11,1969,4.847761194029851

All this changes when she receives a letter from her sister's recently deceased husband which contains a treasure map, and receives a phone call from her terrified sister held hostage by the same kidnappers (introducing the hilarious Danny Devito and Zack Norman, two partners-in-crime who happen to be cousins) who insists that Joni must deliver the map to her in Colombia.  Reluctantly, the borderline agoraphobic Joni agrees, because it's her sister.

After her bus, supposed to be routed to Cartagena but ends up crashing into a jeep filled with exotic birds in the middle of the mountainous nowhere, and she is ordered to give up her purse containing the map to the same man who murdered her husband, the evil Colonel/Minister of Antiquities/Deputy Commander of the Secret Police Zolo (chillingly portrayed by Manuel Ojeda) she is narrowly rescued by a soldier of fortune named Jack T. Colton (Michael Douglas).  He becomes embroiled in the struggle for what is at the end of the map, the green, priceless emerald stone.  They meet numerous crazy characters along the way and hijinx abounds!

Seeing this movie on blu-ray makes me remember the sheer VISUAL pleasure of its 35mm release!  Its 2.35:1 Panavision anamorphic cinematography, lensed by horror maestro John Carpenter alumnus Dean Cundey, is lush.  He cut his teeth in Carpenter's early films like Halloween, The Fog, The Thing and Escape from New York, with his trademark cobalt blue night lighting; here, the screen is a tapestry of jungle greenery, flickering orange firelight and lots of wild night hues, complimented with the cool blues of Manhattan at various times of day and night.  After this, he would go on to photograph several of director Robert Zemeckis' other works, the Back to the Future trilogy and then Jurassic Park for director Steven Spielberg.  His naturalistic lighting lends credibility and yet an elegance and glamour to all these films.

The legendary production designer Lawrence G. Paull, of Blade Runner fame, again works his magic here, making very little, the jungles of Mexico made to be Colombia, look spectacular.

Director Robert Zemeckis, whose career was effectively over after the dismally received (but quite goodj) I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Used Cars, was enlisted by producer Michael Douglas, who recognized the then 28-year-old lad's talent.  Douglas, who originally didn't want to play the part of Colton, caved in when all his potential leads declined, and he realized just how rare good parts and scripts are!

Diane Thomas' first script is indeed a gem, filled with action, humor, passionate romance, and a wonderful sensitivity.  We really root for our leads!  This movie is an example of a cross-genre piece that Hollywood has since always strived to emulate:  It has everything; action, romance, suspense, humor, even a rather hot, steamy after-sex scene between our two attractive leads!  This makes this movie a favorite in my book.  Our two protagonists go through amazing character arcs:  The petrified novelista Joan learns how to live.  The hardened jungle warrior veteran Jack learns how to love.

The visual quality of the blu-ray release is superb, especially considering that this film was previously only released to DVD in non-anamorphic letterbox.  The details, immediately evident in the ruddy, sweaty complexion of Grogan, Angelina's nemesis in the fictitious novelista prologue pre-opening credit sequence, really pop!  A real treat!

And, no small sidebar...eureka--the film's original English subtitles are there to explain the Spanish dialogue!  The ""Cartagena, Colombia"" caption before Elaine is captured, as well as Zolo saying ""You must be French"" to Danny DeVito, who is attempting to do the most ghastly Spanish, Zolo ordering ""Assemble your men"" to his military commander, and, the most needed, when the bell-maker Juan explains to his henchmen that ""this is Joan Wilder, the one who writes the books I read to you on Saturdays!"", one of the biggest jokes in the movie.  Without the subtitles, in previous versions, if you don't speak Spanish, you're lost.

If I find any faults with this blu-ray release, they apply to to the quality of the soundtrack.  The film was released prior to the advent of Dolby Digital 5.1, so one can't expect the kind of in-your-face clarity and realism of today's 5.1 discreet mixes, but, while the sound mixers did a bang-up job of making center dialogue (the crispest I've ever heard it outside a cineplex) completely discreet from the side music and effects channels, the side and rear channels seem to be lacking almost all high frequencies, resulting in a mushy dulling of composer Alan Silvestri's sizzling Latin percussion/synthesized score and the sound of the drizzling rain.  The audio also seems to be behind the image one frame in sync.  Good news is:  Bass, especially in the waterfall, is superb and robust.

(sigh)  While the audio is disappointing, to say the least, the gorgeous visual transfer, in addition to the enchanting story and performances, makes me forgive the audio faults (for now anyway, until a future version arrives), and enjoy the ride!  I really hope Fox remasters this one more time on blu-ray in the future, as it is one of their most endearing catalog titles, and since blu-ray is supposed to be the ultimate presentation format of the film.

The extras, including interviews with our now much-aged cast (ironically, Danny Devito hasn't aged at all) and sumptuous deleted scenes, which contain much of the same dialogue as their film version counterparts, and replace Joan's female editor Gloria with a seemingly docile male editor but whom we know is attracted to Joan, which adds fuel to her fear and mistrust of men, are wonderful, and enhance my appreciation of an already beloved film.

Romancing the Stone is certainly no great film and it would have been much more successful if Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas had exhibited any chemistry at all, but if you want a little light-hearted action/adventure film you probably won't be too disappointed by this 1984 picture about a romance novelist and a soldier of fortune trying to find a precious stone.

275096,5,6300247821,"Romancing the Stone is a beautiful movie.  Many compare it to Indiana Jones but it should be noted that the story for Romancing the Stone was written several years before Indiana Jones by the late Diane Thomas - The story is a classic.

This movie ranks up there with my top 10 favorite entertainment movies of all time.  The story centers around Joan Wilder a novelist who writes romance novels.  All of her stories feature Jessie, the rough tough male figure that saves the strong independent heroine at the end.

Just as the real Joan Wilder finishes writing her latest story, she (played wonderfully by Kathleen Turner) is called away to Colombia to save her sister who apparently is involved with some bad hombres down there in Colombia.  Just as Joan is leaving for the airport, her publisher comments to her that Joan's novels do very well in those Macho countries and that Joan is entirely unprepared for such a trip.

As Joan lands in Colombia, se begins to get into deeper and deeper trouble and at some point she meets up with her real life Jessie - Jack T Colton - played by Michael Douglas.  Both he and she fight off the secret Colombian police wonderfully played by Manuel Ojeda who creates one of the most convincing villains I have ever seen.  Danny Devito also delivers a standup performance along with Alfonso Arau, Holland Taylor, and Zack Norman all deliver wonderful performances.

The special edition is remade in an interesting fashion.  The usual feature lenght commentary's aren't found in these CDs but they do have some great interviews with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner that are worth seeing.

This DVD really pays homage to Diane Thomas, the real world writer of Romancing the Stone.  I didn't know that Diane Thomas was working in a diner and served coffee to Michael Douglas and then pitched him the story Romancing the Stone.  Sadly Diane died in a car crash a few years later.  The real life story makes Romancing the Stone even more memorable and definitely sets it apart from the Indiana Jones franchises.

Many people compare this story to Indiana Jones another wonderful action adventure but Indiana Jones is Saturday Matinee serial stories - lots of action and adventure with a dash of comedy and a pinch of romance.

Romancing the Stone is a Treasure Hunt + Romance + heroine leaving her nest of NYC and spreading her wings + adventure + heroine finding her Jessie (Jack), finding her Man + exotic locale.  The feel is very different from Indiana Jones.

Of note, most of this film was shot in Mexico because Colombia was deemed to dangerous - who knew Mexico had places as beautiful as those portrayed in the film!",1228780800,2,2662,4.735357917570499
275097,5,6300247821,"As the story starts, we are treated to a realistic western and look back at the cover to be sure we have the correct DVD. Yep it is the correct one.

A romance novelist, Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner of ""Body Heat"" 1981 fame) wants to fall in love with the type of hero she created in her novels. Fat chance she has hanging around her New York City apartment.

Perchance her sister Elaine (Mary Ellen Trainor), looking for the other body parts of Elaine's dismembered husband, is kidnapped and ransomed by ruthless people, (Danny DeVito and Zack Norman.)
This just happens to be in Columbia. It seems that there are other interested parties that are downright vicious.

Will Joan Wilder find the type of romance she writes about or just a snot?

Prepare for a great adventure.
----------

The movie was filmed in Mexico. I have not been to Columbia but I have seen several of the places in Mexico. It does not diminish the film what so ever.

I saw this film several times before the Blu-ray packaging and I really cannot say if the resolution or jut big screen TV makes a difference. However looking at the extra footage make me feel that they did a good job of restoration.

The Blu-ray edition has several extras.
Danny explains why he likes to use the word ""maricon!""

I saw this film for the first time as a child and liked it very much then, so was curious to see if I would still enjoy it, more than 20 years later. Compared to more recent action films, ""Romancing the Stone"" seems to take longer to get to the exciting stuff, but once Michael Douglas shows up (about half an hour into the film), the fun starts and this film becomes everything as good, if not better, than the action-comedies that are made these days. That's not to say that ""Romancing the Stone"" is anything deep.

But there are also plenty of laughs between the one liners and the bumbling bad guy played by Danny DeVito.  I felt the romance was rather forced most of the time, but by the end I bought into it.

The film is rated PG, but that is only because PG-13 hadn't been invented yet.  The film is filled with bad language, mostly the ""S"" word, and there's plenty of violence to go around as well.

So lets get one thing straight: Romancing the stone is no clone of Indiana Jones.

Romancing the Stone is one of the finest adventure movies out there today. It is fun, exciting and ritmic on it's own way and has captured the hearts of movielovers all over the world.
Michael Douglas plays a man called Jack T. Colten, a guy who is a bit down on his luck and travels around the world. When he meets romantic novelist Joan Wilder (played with lots of fun by Kathleen Turner) in the Columbian jungle, the adventure begins! Being chased by a lot of badguys (including Danny Devito in a hilarious role), the two have a lot of thrills and of course adventure!

The atmosphere in the film is absolutely fantastic and feels great. The movie lifts you up to a level of high enjoyment and shameless fun. Also the music in the film, composed by Alan Silvestri gives the movie much more depth and even more fun! So with stunning action scenes, great humor and a lot of delighted surprises, this movie is a great acquisition in your dvd collection!

The recently releashed special edition of the film has  nice extras. Nice features about making the film (a feature of 20 minutes, and three others of all 3 minutes) and a bunch of fun deleted scenes (18 minutes).

275176,4,6300247821,"Out of all of the movies in the 1980s that were influenced by Raiders of the Lost Ark, Romancing the Stone was arguably the best of the bunch (even if it was written before Raiders) because it managed to successfully blend action and adventure with a good dose of humour that resulted in a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining experience. It also helped Michael Douglas make the jump from television to A-list movie star and shot Kathleen Turner's career into the mainstream.

Douglas' character has the same kind of roguish charm as Indiana Jones albeit with a bit more of an emphasis on the comedy. And like Han Solo, he's a little full of himself and the humour in the film comes when he's knocked off his smug high horse. Turner is an excellent foil to Douglas and Joan makes a credible transformation from meek wallflower to a much more confident and assertive individual - closer to the heroines in her novels. In addition to being quite funny, Turner is also beautiful and smart. The `80s were good to her with a string of hits that included Body Heat and Prizzi's Honor but it was this film that really established her as a movie star.

Romancing the Stone also helped launch director Robert Zemeckis' career who would go on to direct an even larger hit with Back to the Future. He wisely doesn't try to ape Raiders' retro pulp serial approach, instead going for a more contemporary look while capturing that film's more overt comedic moments with broad slapstick that is a little too silly at times but fortunately Zemeckis keeps them to a minimum. The commercial success of Romancing the Stone spawned an inferior sequel, The Jewel of the Nile but the chemistry between the two leads (and DeVito) was used effectively again in The War of the Roses.

There are eight deleted scenes with more footage of Jack and Joan bonding in the jungle, including a bit with her bathing and them falling asleep together in the crashed plane that they wait out the rain in. We also see Joan back in New York telling her editor to publish her new novel based on her adventures in Colombia.

""Rekindling the Romance: A Look Back"" features Douglas, DeVito and Turner returning for new interviews recounting, with fondness, their experiences making the movie. By everyone's account, it was a tough shoot with extreme weather and an unforgiving environment with Turner recalling the numerous injuries she endured. This is a nice look back at the movie.

""A Hidden Treasure: The Screenwriter"" profiles the movie's screenwriter, Diane Thomas. Douglas was taken with the blend of action, comedy and romance. Thomas tragically died in a car accident. This extra is a nice, little tribute to her.

""Douglas, Turner and DeVito: Favorite Scenes."" The three leads pick the scenes that they like the most and they aren't necessarily the ones you'd think (no, not the famous mudslide scene - thankfully).

""Michael Douglas Remembers."" The actor talks about the tough time he had making the transition from T.V. to the big screen as an actor. He was a successful producer but it took Romancing the Stone to show that he was a bankable movie star.",1157500800,25,3125,4.786641929499073
275177,5,6300247821,"Wow! This beautiful transfer more than makes up for the cruddy 1999 release, which sported flat sound and more grain and mud in the image than could be found during rainy season in Columbia. Both the color correction and level of detail will pleasefans of this 1984 action comedy classic. I saw this film in 70mm in Westwood, CA during its initial run and always remember it as looking and sounding amazing.

Producer Michael Douglas and Director Bob Zemeckis did a fantastic job on first-time screenwriter Diane Thomas' tale of a romance novelist who blossoms when is taken out of her Manhattan existence to rescue her sister in Cartegena, Columbia. A lot of credit should go to composer Alan Silvestri whose score for this fish-out-of-water tale meshed beautifully with Zemeckis' imagery.

I always thought it was a shame that Douglas and Turner didn't make this series a trilogy.  The chemistry between them is what good movies are all about. But apparently the 1985 sequel, ""Jewel of the Nile,"" which had good moments, but a flat script, killed it.

Sure, maybe there could have been a few more extras on the DVD.  But when a movie is this strong, who cares?",1157414400,11,1162,4.79
275178,5,6300247821,"...that doesn't melt at that ending, one of the most wonderful and unconventional ""rides off into the sunset"" ever featured in a movie of this genre, (and yes, guys, that goes for you, too. ADMIT IT!) By the time Alan Silvestri's salsa-flavored end theme hits its apex, you feel like dancing out of the theater, (uhh, I mean dancing to the FRIDGE) on a bed of cheesy but romantic clouds.

And what makes ROMANCING THE STONE such a five-star worthy wonder is the story that precedes that blissful ending.

Neither fish nor fowl, this is a movie that tries to be something for everyone and by all rights shouldn't work because of it. But DAMN if it doesn't succeed, and beautifully.

An affectionate and at times tart salute to and spoof of the great romantic adventures of the genre (especially those featuring a certain Dr. Jones), ROMANCING doesn't miss a beat as it throws us headlong into the wildly romantic fantasy world of best-selling novelist Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner fulfilling the promise she displayed in BODY HEAT), whose rich dreamscapes of virile heroes, damsels-in-distress and vicious bad guys are as bountiful with adventure and romance as her real life is bereft of it.

Ah, but not for long!!! A terrified phone call from her globe-trotting sister and a mysterious package in the mail sets Joan on a course for adventure that you definitely wouldn't get on ""The Love Boat.""

Traveling South Of the Border to follow the course of the map she finds in the package and to locate her sister, a near-brush with several catastrophes brings her right into the sphere of one Jack Colton (Michael Douglas at his most appealingly rakish), a 'professional adventurer' who's willing to help out any accomodating ""Pauline-in-peril""...at a price, of course.

Together, willingly or not, these two protagonists right out of one of Joan's own novels will swing across chasms, dodge bullets, race across valleys and fight off the vilest of villains to find two treasures beyond imagination - the one they were looking for, and one that neither of them counted on finding...each other!

I know...stop GAGGING! This isn't your average cloyingly sweet Barbara Cartland potboiler. Besides the remarkable performances of Douglas as a hero who's not as capable or dashing as he thinks he is, and Turner as a heroine with reserves of strength and resourcefulness she never dreamed she possessed, there's also the hysterical supporting role played by Danny DeVito, whose gadfly of a bad guy, Ralph, keeps the scenario from melting into a pool of icky sweetness whenever it threatens to, and Zach Norman as Ralph's croc-fixated cousin Ira, whose bumbling attempts at being nefarious only get them deeper into trouble than either one of them can handle.

Also noteworthy are the cameos by acclaimed director Alfonso Arau as Juan, an unexpected ally of Joan and Jack's (he's a rabid fan of her novels) and Manuel Ojeda who oozes evil as General Zolo, the guy who shows neophytes Ralph and Ira how it's REALLY done.

And how could we not mention the terrific Holland Taylor as Joan's editor and Mary Ellen Trainor as Elaine, Joan's hapless sister, whose kidnapping sets the whole plot in motion?

With the startlingly confident job that Zemeckis does directing from Diane Thomas's rarer-than-rare great script, it's not even surprising that the very next film he would direct would launch one of the most successful action-adventure franchises ever: BACK TO THE FUTURE.

ROMANCING THE STONE is one of those movies that has to be a part of any well-stocked DVD library, no question about it.

And I dare you to resist turning up the volume on the sound system as the credits roll...",1156809600,3,3675,4.9288025889967635
275179,2,6300247821,"Kathleen Turner plays romance novelist Joan Wilder, who ironically isn't too lucky in the world of love and romance. She writes about faraway places and times, but for the most part she's cooped up in her apartment with her cat Romeo. It's a lonely life, until one day she discovers her sister has been kidnapped and is being held hostage in Columbia. Joan rushes over there, and in the midst of the confusion and culture shock she meets Jack T. Colten (Michael Douglas), who agrees to get her out safely in exchange for several hundred dollars worth of her travellers checks. Will Joan be able to save her sister? Will she have an adventure worthy of her novels, and more importantly, will she have a romance as worthy?

I first heard about ""Romancing the Stone"" when I was browsing through the special features of the DVD of ""The Librarian: Quest For The Spear"". They mentioned ""Romancing the Stone"", saying it was a film similar to Indiana Jones. It sounded like the sort of film I would like. It had adventure, I love adventure films, it was set in South America, I love South America. It had a treasure to be found, it had crocodiles it had romance. Yes, it definitely sounded like a film I would enjoy.

And I really wanted to like it too, I really did. It seemed like my type of film and I gave it every chance I could. Even though the imaginary wild western start put me off, I kept watching, hoping it would get better. Even though I didn't feel for the heroine, or the rough and tumble adventuring hero, I kept watching, hoping I might soon, maybe in a few minutes, a few scenes, maybe. Even when I was totally bored with it and wanted to turn it off I kept watching. But no, I could hardly get into this film at all. By the last forty minutes of it, I could only watch five minutes at a time, pause it, go and do something else and come back, forcing myself to finish watching. That's how much of a chance I gave it. The only thing I liked about it, pretty much, was the very beautiful scenery and color (which is why it gets two stars instead of one from me). Everything else was dull and hard to follow.

With the cheesy dialogue and so so plot, there were some points in the film where I thought perhaps ""Romancing the Film"" was trying to imitate a certain style of B-grade cult cinema of the past, a homage or something to somthing I'd never seen that I just wasn't understanding. I saw lots of action, but for some reason it didn't grab me. I saw Danny DeVito as a crook but it didn't make me laugh (and I usually always laugh at Danny DeVito's antics). I really felt left out of the joke here. Looking at some of the glowing reviews here, I am even more confused. Did I get the same DVD as everyone else? I got the one with the crashed aeroplane full of marijuana, the devils fork, the green gemstone, and the Spanish speaking romance fans gushing praises to Joan in a usually mean village. I don't normally criticize films so heavily in reviews like this, but I really, really, really didn't get it at all. It's directed by Robert Zemeckis and everything! I mean, I love the Back to the Future trilogy, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Forrest Gump... but this?

On this edition of the DVD there's not much in the way of special features apart from an original 1984 trailer.

I'd say to give this one a miss.",1151884800,5,3321,4.35
275180,3,6300247821,"If you like this movie, I strongly recommend you watch the animation movie, ""The Castle of Cagliostro"" (1979) by Hayao Miyazaki, who is also famous with the 2002 Oscar awarded ""Spirited Away"".

Zemeckis's film, ""The Romancing Stone"" (1984), looks like a patchwork quilt sewn with a series of episodes taken from Miyazaki's animation.  You'll find many funny or exciting scenes in Zemeckis' film in the Castle of Cagliostro too.

In 1980's, a Japanese animation has not yet gained any market outside of Japan. Robert Zemeckis was a one of the great influencers in Hollywood to introduce Japanese masterpieces (maybe next to George Lucas). However, in that period, directors shared videos with their friends only and didn't think it's neccessary to mention to public which Japanese film he based for the plot of his movie.",1150934400,4,820,5.104477611940299
275201,5,6300247821,"UPDATE July 7. 2006 - In August 2006 Fox will be releasing a special edition DVD of this title along with a special edition of its sequel THE JEWEL OF THE NILE.
When this movie was released in 1984 it was unfairly criticized by some reviewers as being another one in a long line of ""RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK rip-offs. But, as director of the movie Robert Zemeckis (who would go on to direct the BACK TO THE FUTURE movies) said in interviews at the time, the script for this movie had been making its way around Hollywood long before Indiana Jones had cracked a whip.
Despite some well-publicized goofs this movie succeeds in what it sets out to be, an entertaining and exciting adventure picture.
In a role that was first offered to Sylvester Stallone and then to Christopher Reeve, Michael Douglas (who was beginning to look more and more like his father Kirk) plays Jack T. Colton. Colton is an adventurer who comes to the aid of romance novelist Joan Wilder (played by Kathleen Turner in the movie that really cemented her as a celebrity).
Seems Wilders sister sent her a map to a fabulous gem in Colombia and now her sister (Elaine) is being held by some thugs, including the rather loveable small-time crook Ralph (played by Danny DeVito, who was best known at that time from the television show ""Taxi""). So, Joan travels down to South America in an effort to deliver the map, but is misdirected onto  the wrong bus by a rather fearsome looking police officer named Zolo (played with obvious evil relish by Manuel Ojedo) who earlier trashed her New York apartment  in search of the map. When Zolo tries to take the map from her forcibly Colton arrives on the scene just in time and the two team up in an effort to get to Cartagena with Ralph, Zolo and (what seems like) half the Colombian army in hot pursuit.
DeVito is present in large part for comic relief and this movie does feature some truly funny moments, yet the comedy is never too obtrusive to ruin the action and the movie really does deliver some great action set pieces. Chief among these is a chase through a Colombian village (with a local drug lord as a guide) and Colton and Wilder traveling down the rapids in what is quite obviously an inflatable car). Douglas and Turner are both great in their respective roles and in fact would revisit the two characters in the rather-inferior sequel JEWEL OF THE NILE (along with DeVito), and the romance between the two appears genuine and does not slow down the movie's pace.
The score for the movie was composed  by Alan Silvestri who does a great job, In fact Zemeckis had brought him on board to write a temporary score for the movie, but liked his work so much that he was hired full-time. Also, listen to the background music as Jack and Joan enter Juan's rather plush villa. It's the song ""Romancing the Stone"" by Eddy Grant. Grant had been retained by the filmmakers to write the song for the movie, but when he delivered it, they decided not to use it. In fact the song does not even appear on the soundtrack, but was released separately by Grant when the movie became a mega-hit.
The movie manages to successfully combine a number of elements in a tricky balancing act and the movie is also benefited by some really nice art direction by Agustin Ituarte and set design by Enrique Estevez. The movie certainly stands up well to repeated viewings.
Top marks go to Fox for the quality of this DVD. Although it is non-anamorphic, the picture is clear and colorful and the sound  is sharp. The only area where the DVD is found lacking is in the lack of special features with only the theatrical trailer added. Hopefully Fox will correct this oversight in a future rerelease.
For those hoping for more of the same in the sequel you might be disappointed. Even with a great title song by Billy Ocean (the video of which featured Douglas, Turner and DeVito) the movie failed to cap[ture the spirit of this movie. It's certainly worth checking out but when it's all said and done this is the film you will remember and return to again and again.",1147305600,5,4058,4.532060027285129

I was 18, and pretty much still a teenager, so to fit in with my peers I said this movie was good when in my heart I knew it was a piece of garbage. I found the plot to be too hard to follow even if I wanted to do so, and the non-stop fast and furious cursing I began to wonder if this was for the actors/actresses to turn each other on, or not. The movie just doesn't lay well with me, and I know it probably will never. I'm just telling you all this now because I'm almost 39, and I want to have my mind and conscious clear before the Lord. I said this was a good movie to impress people, and they haven't even stayed in touch with me, and I haven't stayed in touch with them, so now's the time to start thinking for myself, and I feel that this is a trash movie.",1147305600,6,871,3.8444444444444446
275203,5,6300247821,"""Romancing the Stone"" is a hilarious, romantic and action-packed adventure. This is a classic and timeless 1980s movie, which has stood the test of time, a tribute to the director, Robert Zemeckis and his team. I first saw the film about 20 years ago as a young man but I still thoroughly enjoy it every time I watch it to this day.

Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner play their roles perfectly. Kathleen Turner stars as Joan Wilder, a romance writer from New York who goes to the jungles of Colombia, armed with a mysterious map, to rescue her sister who had been taken hostage by some apparently ruthless villains. Michael Douglas stars as Jack Colton, a rough and jaded soldier of fortune, who comes to the rescue of Joan Wilder when she is lost and stranded in the Colombian jungle. From this, a brilliant and intricate plot is woven into an exciting romantic and adventurous movie which has made ""Romancing the Stone"" one of the best adventure movies of the late 20th century.

There is also some good humour particularly from Danny DeVito who plays the much abused bumbling kidnapper, Ralph. Romance develops naturally between Joan and Jack while the search for the treasure is being pursued.

This is a well made film with action moving naturally from one predicament to the next with the right amount of humour for a romance and adventure film. The music is excellent and the scenery and setting are exciting.

This hilarious action-packed movie is recommended for anyone interested in adventure, romance, comedy and fun. However, it may not be suitable for children below the age of ten.",1142380800,12,1598,4.821167883211679

My husband is a big fan of Danny DeVito, and just loves all the blustering he does at his brother Ira.  I love the romance of it; Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas have visual sparks flying between them and they are a joy to watch.  The kids love the adventure and the action, and as they get older, they too love the romance.  It's not really for younger kids (under 10) but for tweens, teens and older, it's a gem.  It is set in the 1980s so there is a slight issue with the aging of the film, but the directors were fairly careful to avoid obvious fads; Kathleen Turner's clothes are classic rather than trendy so this film stands the test of time better than many others of the 80s. However.  Why in the world aren't there any extras (to speak of?)  How about a commentary?  Interviews?  A making of featurette?  Anything...throw us a bone.

275207,5,6300247821,"This 1984 film was the first that brought together the incredible on-screen chemistry of Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas. The film, a romantic and comic version of the Indiana Jones films, involves a romance novelist (Kathleen T) and how she gets wrapped up in a hunt for a rare and valuable diamond. As her love interest and her partner in the search is Michael Douglas. At first, the two don't get along very well. Their fighting and bickering as well as game-playing (they each plan to dump the other and take the diamond for themselves) is only an overture to the subsequent romance and passion that overwhelms them. At the end of the movie, they are on a boat on top of a car in New York City headed for a romantic world travel adventure.
This movie also stars Danny Devito (this team- Turner, Douglas and Da Vito would later make War Of The Roses which was a darker comedy about a nightmare divorce). Danny DeVito is hilarious as he is a shlemiel. The location was shot in South America, specifically Columbia, and the lush scenes of photographic landscapes - jungles, rivers, waterfalls, rapids and villages, make this a very engaging adventure story. Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas are really great together and it is the real salvation of the movie. For Turner's character, her life becomes an adventure and a romance as any of the novels she has written. Highly enjoyable, very comedic and never aging, this movie is a welcome fill for any space in your DVD collection. On DVD, it's even better.

275232,5,6300247821,"This movie is a modern swashbuckler that presents an unusual twist in that one of the two main characters is a big city romance novel writer who proves that she can more than hold her own in a nominally male setting.  The goal of the movie is to find a treasure to save romance book author Joan Wilder's sister, who has been kidnapped by apparently ruthless villains.  However, the initial goal of the movie was for Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) to return the treasure map to the kidnappers in Colombia, South America.  During her trip to return the map, Joan ends up on the wrong bus, where she soon runs into Jack Colton (Michael Douglas).
Jack offers to take Joan to a phone, for a substantial guide fee.  During their initial brief walk in the jungle, Jack quickly become disenchanted with Joan's lack of knowledge regarding the jungle and outdoors in general.  As quickly as Jack's disenchant begins, he in turn begins to admire her adaptability, occasional fearlessness, and intelligence.  As one example, soon after walking into the jungle, crooked cop Zolo has Jack and Joan trapped against an impassable river canyon, with only a decaying bridge crossing it.  Jack prepares to make a last stand; Joan begins walking the bridge, and accidentally survives a Tarzan-like swing to the other side of the river gorge.
In scene after scene Joan proves that while she is a big city girl, she is resourceful and intelligent, and more than a little daring.  Her initial reactions are often that of a stereotypical movie female, and then she perseveres and overcomes, often when Jack has either given up or is about to give up.  In the end, it is Jack who is the stereotype of the bumbling male, and Joan becomes the brains and leader of her sister's rescue.
As in all good swashbucklers, there is a good amount of humor.  While Joan is generally the straight man, she still provides ironic humor in several places.  Jack is often the fall guy, and his nearly slapstick antics provide quite a few funny moments.  But the actor that steals the show for humor is Danny DeVito as bumbling kidnapper Ralph.  Throughout much of the movie Ralph is nearly forgotten as a ""dangerous"" kidnapper because Zolo and Jack can be truly deadly in comparison to Ralph.  Furthermore, Ralph seems to get himself into one slapstick situation after another.
The other element this movie shares with other swashbucklers is the romance that develops between Joan and Jack.  Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas have a great screen chemistry that is very natural and appealing.  By the time the movie ends the romance between Joan and Jack has become the central theme of the movie, with the search for the treasure as a vehicle to develop that romance.
This movie has all the features of a wonderful action/adventure/romance movie, with just the right touch of humor.  The action moves in a very natural way from one predicament to the next, with just the right amount of incredible coincidence to keep the feel in the tradition of classic swashbuckler movies.  This movie compares well with the Indiana Jones movie series, with more humor and romance.  I highly recommend this movie.",1056585600,,3158,4.814814814814815

Interestingly, the English subtitles sometimes translate the spoken Spanish into English and sometimes give the Spanish in Spanish subtitles. The non-subtitled version doesn't give subtitles at all for any of the spoken Spanish. A must have in my collection.",970617600,2,352,5.660377358490566
275271,5,6300247821,The best in classic adventures.  It will be a pleasure to purchase on DVD.  Lets hope the DVD brings out the magic as Video has,966729600,,127,4.04
275272,5,6300247821,"If I had the misfortune of being forced to watch only one movie for the  rest of my life, Romancing The Stone would be it. What the other reviews  don't mention is how very funny this movie really is. Granted it is a bit  dated, but some of the scenes will make you burst out laughing, especially  if you like Danny Devito. The chemistry is great between all the  characters, and there really is something for everyone here. This is the  movie I pop in when I can't decide what to watch, because I know I'll enjoy  it.",965606400,,518,4.224489795918367
275273,3,6300247821,"ROMANCING THE STONE could be seen as the poor man's Indiana Jones movie. It's short on snappy dialogue, coherent plot and memorable characters.
Essentially this is a vehicle for Douglas as rough and ready  Jack Colton, and Turner to show her versatility as Joan Wilder, the  novelist who sheds her loner image and eventually becomes a heroine. Danny  DeVito crops up as a slimy rival to the duo's quest, but his part is  overplayed and underwritten.
The story as it is revolves around Wilder  going to Columbia to rescue her kidnapped sister. This leads her into a  journey of adventure to recover a fabled jewel with adventurer Colton. An  almost sinister kidnapping becomes a farcical adventure comedy: I found the  switching in tone of this movie at times confusing, and at other times far  too blunt.
Whilst ROMANCING THE STONE is not a movie that will leave any  lasting impression on you, it is passable as entertainment - saved as it is  by the one thing that causes it so many problems: the reliance on the  Turner-Douglas on-screen relationship to carry it through.",963792000,3,1074,4.808743169398907
275274,5,6300247821,"I enjoyed this movie, even though I thought I would hate it. It has all  the proper elements a romantic comedy needs-humour, plot characters. But  the main reason this is better, is because the characters are different.  Instead of your average wonderful hero male, who is good, honest, etc., we  have a slightly more sleazy male, wonderfully played by Michael Douglas. I  suggest this movie.",962582400,,392,4.969230769230769
275275,5,6300247821,"Douglas and Turner shine as a novelist and adventurer who meet each other in the highlands of Colombia after Turner's sister is kidnapped. Wonderful script and great chemistry made the Turner and Douglas team sort of an  Eighties version of Spencer & Tracy. Filmed in Mexico and New York,  this is one of my favorite movies of the 1980's due to the belief that love  and adveture could be found outside of Reagan's America. The romanticism of  their adventures as well as Turner's novel writing career blended both her  fictionary vision and her acceptance of realism a major turn for an  ordinary film character. Excellent film that should be watched for years to  come.",956275200,,671,4.833333333333333
275276,5,6300247821,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  It's got a little something for everyone - humor, romance, adventure, suspense.  A ""must have"" for those nights when there's nothing on TV.",951523200,,184,4.903225806451613
275277,5,6300247821,"I first saw this movie on tv when I was about 7 or 8 years old.  I've seen it dozens of times since then (the tv cut and the uncut)...it has to be my favorite movie of ALL time.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact  that it was produced in 1984, the year I was born.  Every time I watch it,  I find something new about it I didn't see the time before.  In fact, I  JUST finished watching it on cable a few minutes ago!  I will most  definately buy this movie a.s.a.p!  It's a classic!",945734400,,491,3.82
