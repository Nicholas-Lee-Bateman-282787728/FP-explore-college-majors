3479445,4,B001B1Q2UY,"This is another in the gritty and grim school of British police dramatic series.  The actors are all excellent and the relationship between the two leading officers is compelling if somewhat wearying, since they seem to have a hell of a time dealing with each other.  The depiction of police work is excellent although it brings nothing really new to the genre.  There is not a great deal of humor to be found in this series, and it could use some because its stories are quite grisly, especially the first two episodes.  Overall, this is a series that will certainly hold your attention and keep you on the edge of your seat if you have the stomach for it.",1232755200,16,657,4.495798319327731
3479446,4,B001B1Q2UY,"This police procedural BBC production is neither about a trial or retribution. It's about how London police go about their business. With a heavy proportion given to the personal lives of both the police and the citizens and suspects they encounter. The stories are about pretty mundane, everyday crimes, just those in the USA.

Occasionally stories get melodramatic, getting intense about the pressures of police work. But overall, the episodes are gritty and realistic. But not so heavy on action. More time is spent on thinking and talking than suspense and capture. T&R seems a version of Prime Suspect, with not-quite as good writing.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prime-Suspect-1/dp/B0000AYJV5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prime Suspect 1</a>

(This tag takes you to the first of six or seven PS episodes,blessed with the acting excellence of Helen Mirren. All, worthy of multiple viewings thanks to great characterizations and direction. If you're curious about UK TV, Prime Suspect is the place to start and maybe finish... )",1229817600,7,1070,5.808917197452229
3479447,5,B001B1Q2UY,"Those familiar with the British crime-drama series Prime Suspect will already be familiar with the top-notch writing skills of Lynda La Plante, and those who've enjoyed Prime Suspect will certainly enjoy Trial & Retribution.  This is a highly engrossing, intellectually satisfying, consummately acted series with strong, richly woven, impeccably written storylines that draw one in and keep one enrapt throughout.

Unlike Prime Suspect, this series centres around the lives of two senior police officers and the ensuing relationship (both personal and professional) between them.  Detective Superintendent Mike Walker (David Hayman) is a feisty, intense, no-nonsense little Jack Russell who rips the filters off his cigarettes.  A Scotsman with a nose for the business and a loathing for criminal scum, he's a cop who gets results.  He's not, however, a very nice man; more to the point, from a human standpoint he's actually very flawed--a fact which becomes increasingly (indeed disturbingly) more evident as the series progresses.

Personality-wise, Detective Inspector Pat North (Kate Buffery) is Mike's polar opposite--well, she'd have to be in order to get along with Mike.  A bit rumpled, even haggard in appearance, she's serious, concientious, and ambitious, but she takes things at a calmer more methodical pace, thinking things out first rather than shooting from the hip (as Mike tends to do).

Another feature which distinguishes this series from Prime Suspect (or most other crime-dramas for that matter) is that each episode follows the crime not only through the amassing of evidence and eventual arrest of a suspect but through the trial as well.  Of course, once the trial commences, time is of the essence should any new evidence come to light!  This is a series which is superbly acted by the strongest of casts, and the actors portraying the barristers are no exceptions.  I was particularly captivated by their consummately orated soliloquies and examinations of witnesses--one really is on the edge of one's seat throughout.

No review of this exceptional series would be complete without mention of the highly sophisticated and innovative directing.  The show will often break into a split screen (for example when a witness is describing what he or she saw) which has proven to be a highly effective technique.  It was La Plante's innovation (and one which she had to fight for), and lest one thinks it sounds weird and intrusive, it is done so professionally and smoothly that the transitions are barely noticeable.

British or otherwise, of all the crime dramas ever produced, Trial & Retribution is one of the very best ever made (and is my own personal favourite), and I highly, HIGHLY recommend it.  It is unpredictable, intelligent, rivetting, and very sophisticatedly directed, not to mention flawlessly acted.  It is also highly realistic (La Plante, who also produced the series, had her scripts edited by various police and forensic specialists for accuracy).  This boxed set includes the first four series made between 1997 and 2000, each of which consists of one 200-minute story split into two 100-minute episodes.  Nineteen series have been made to date (of which I've seen about half) with more in the works.  I can only hope that Acorn will release this series in its entirety--if any series deserves a complete release, this one does!  Finally, if you enjoy this series and are looking for other top-notch crime-dramas, I also recommend The Commander (also by La Plante) and The Vice (starring Ken Stott).",1226188800,46,3547,5.220458553791887

3479449,5,B001B1Q2UY,"Trial and Retribution is an excellent series (I have viewed  the first 5ets)This series is very well written,acted and produced. It is not a warm and fuzzy police drama but very gritty and certainly shows the seedier side of life. It is refreshing to have strong female leads a la Prime Suspect.

3479450,2,B001B1Q2UY,"My wife and I are huge fans of this series, but the second episode of year 1 is too much.  Too much gore for the sake of gore.  Poor writing.  Essential motives are not developed.  We're asked to believe that three grown men confess to murders in order to cover up for a fourth - and with no motive.  Absurd.  Keep watching the series, but let this one go.",1361059200,2,356,4.086956521739131
3479451,4,B001B1Q2UY,I am a big fan of British TV and Linda LaPlante. This first show of the first series seemed to drag....a lot. I have yet to watch part two of the first story but will give it another try,1359763200,,186,3.7948717948717947
3479452,5,B001B1Q2UY,"I bought the season one episodes just to see how I would enjoy the story. I wish that I had the others ! It was fabulous, clever plots, great acting, comedy and drama all rolled into each story.
Amazon does not have a deal on the other sets, so it is purchase each episode/series individually. I plan on doing this as soon as the ship is in a port where mail might reasonably reach us in somewhat of a timely fashion. it was an excellent series with all of the clever twists and turns with surprise endings. I am hooked on Trial and Retribution. If they are halfway as good as series one, it should be a home run !",1355270400,,614,4.125

3479454,2,B001B1Q2UY,"With the exception of the first disc, I found set 1 disappointing. The unlikely relationship between David Hayman's character and that of Kate Buffery was tedious and spoiled the series. The story lines, though dark, are gripping; and had the roles for the leading actors been written differently, the series would definitely have had a great deal more appeal. I see the possibility of improvements in set 2 (having just watched set 2, disk 2).",1338595200,,444,4.933333333333334
3479455,4,B001B1Q2UY,"I fell upon this series, and must admit I was hooked from the first episode. It is my understanding that there are fourteen series, so I have miles to go. I am such a fan of the UK police procedural/mysteries.

Trial and Retribution is written by Lynda LaPlante. Of note she wrote the exquisite, 'Prime Suspect' series. And, just like that series, just when you think you have a handle on 'whodunnit', a new character/suspect is added to the plot. We meet Detective Inspector, Pat North, played by Kate Buffery, and Detective Superintendent, Mike Walker, played by David Hayman. Right off, we get to see how the police work. Pat is part of the London Police and Mike is part of the London CID-Criminal Investigation Department. This is a real plus, to see how the hierarchy works, and who is in charge and what is demanded of each participant.  In the second series we get to know about the private lives of Pat and Mike. I liked Mike, but he seemed to me, to be the exact opposite of what Pat would want in a man. She is above board, fairly open and loves her job. Pat is the one character I really admired, andd wanted to see in the rest of the series. Mike is sexist and racist and a homophobe. He comes from a tough Scottish background, and it seems he worked his way up from the gutter. Series One gives us a good background into how this group/squad works, and Mike is impressed with Pat and her work. And, it appears that Pat thinks the same of Mike. They work well together, and the first case involving a missing child shows this.

Trial and Retribution gives us the case and how it is solved, and then we go to the courtroom. Many surprises abound, but I quite like the British legal system. Surely it is as corrupt as ours, but we see the good lights. The use of split screens is very effective, as one person is talking and we can see the actual event in action. It is as I have said Absolutely Gripping, in it s violence and in its mystery.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 05-19-12

3479456,1,B001B1Q2UY,"If you have the stomach for horrific pictures of dead bodies along with a high tolerance for tedium, this show is for you.  The first and third stories are about child abductions, the second is about a seriel killer that mutilates women horribly before he murders them, complete with lots of horrendously graphic photos.  The last one is about a fight between a gay couple ending in the stabbing death of one of them (I fast forwarded nearly all of it, and it still bored me out of my skull).  The courtroom segments of the show are needlessy long, with the silks belaboring every point ad infinitium and the judge in one case then giving an interminable jury instruction.  This is as close as I ever want to come to seeing an investigation and trial in real time.  The ""side"" material about the private lives of the detectives is like watching paint dry, i.e., why would you want to?  I am a huge fan of british crime and drama shows, so when I tell you to save your money for Midsommer Murders, Murder City, A Touch of Frost, Murder in Suburbia, Inspector Lewis, The Last Detective, Pie in the Sky, New Tricks, etc., I know whereof I speak!",1335916800,8,1142,4.466346153846154

I had never seen any of the actors before but all of them from the cops to the witnesses to the suspects were riviting to watch.

3479459,5,B001B1Q2UY,"I've said it before and I'll say it again.  When someone who is the caliber of a major film star tackles one of these tv shows, what a difference. Rhys Ifans played the defendant in this season and dominated it from beginning to end.  Yes, everyone else is good but you can't see anyone else in this giving Hugh Grant a run for the money, which is what Ifans subsequently did. Ifans makes films nowadays, not tv.  Everyone else on this show is still on tv, at most.  This is absolutely no surprise whatsoever.  There is a chemistry he has with the camera, a magnetism, which the others simply lack.  I've watched later seasons of this show.  They are not better or worse as far as the show itself but they simply do not have anyone of Rhys Ifans's ability on them.  So this is the five star one to watch.

As for the tv show itself.  Like most UK crime shows, it is extremely well written and extremely realistic.  It does not shirk from going every gritty mile into the dankest corners of criminal law.  American network crime tv shows do not do this although I'm pleased to say that American cable tv has gone where network never dared go before with nitty gritty crime.

This is a child sexual assault and murder case.  When the episode opened, we were looking at this beautiful little girl and I thought right then that maybe parents shouldn't let their children be that visibly beautiful in public places. With her beautiful wind tousled curly blonde hair, limpid blue eyes, perfect english rose complexion, she is bait supreme out alone on the street, unattended by parent, babysitter or grandparent. The police go about solving her murder and there are two suspects: the stepfather and Rhys Ifans, as a general neer do well, whose principal vice seems to be public drunkenness.

Ironically, he ends up getting first rate legal representation in the UK.  If this was as realistic as everything else in the show, British indigent defendants sure get better representation than their American counterparts.  He couldn't have done any better if he were rich.

This episode does not wrap everything up in a nice, tidy bow for the audience.  The ending is disturbing, as is the whole episode.

Lynda LaPlante, the producer and creator, is a seasoned and excellent writer and producer, previously known for PRIME SUSPECT with Helen Mirren.  Her name on anything is virtually a guarantee of excellence.

3479460,5,B001B1Q2UY,"Wow, I only recently discovered this series for the first time.  I've been a longtime fan of British police/crime dramas.  The list of good ones is long with such outstanding series as A Touch of Frost, Prime Suspect, Cracker, Midsomer Murders, Inspector Lynley, etc.

This one may go straight to being one of my top 3 favorites of all time based on Sets 1 and 2 (I haven't seen any of the others yet).

I've always liked journeyman actor David Hayman in anything I've seen him in, and he really shines as the leading man in this series.  Really, everyone is great.

I was slightly put off at first by what I initially thought was a cheesy attempt at flash by the split screen affects during certain scenes.  However, I quickly realized that this affect was wisely used sparingly and to good effect in terms of enhancing the scenes in which it was used.

Sorry to see there are not more reviews of this one.  If you are a fan of this genre, you will certainly be pleased with this.  Give it a try!",1273017600,7,997,4.369565217391305
3479461,4,B001B1Q2UY,"This Lynda LaPlante project recalls key elements of the Prime Suspect series--a solid, shrewd female investigator leads a team of assistants in solving a heinous crime.  In this case, however, the woman is replaced by a man who keeps her in the loop and works with her as a trusted partner.  A prime suspect is identified and the case is pursued through its many stages until we reach the trial.  When new information surfaces during the trial the detectives are back in the field again, racing against the clock to find a crucial bit of evidence.  The setting, the characters, the relatives of the victim and the perpetrator are all gritty.  This is East London: gray bordering on grim, definitely not theme-park Britain.  The direction is somewhat odd, with ample use of split-screen images, some of which work and some of which merely seem odd.  There are inconsistencies in the evidence and shaky elements in the plot, just as in real life.  Set 1 involves the abduction, abuse and murder of a small child.  Steel yourself.  It certainly will hold your attention.  Nonsmokers: prepare yourself for profuse smoking by many of the principals.  As the chief investigator says, 'if you don't smoke you shouldn't be in this job.'",1259884800,4,1228,4.850961538461538

3479463,4,B001B1Q2UY,"The acting is outstanding.  The stories are gritty and true to life.  Most aspects of this series are excellent.  The constant use of split screen technique...not so much. It becomes distracting and does little to enhance story telling.  What hurts this series most are the endings.  We are left waiting for some sort of an answer at the end of each and every episode, instead we're left watching that black screen with the credits rolling.

3479464,5,B001B1Q2UY,"This series of shows is another example of good and gritty British TV.  The acting is excellent and the series follows the career of DCI Walker.  One thing I really like = is this a good cop, or a bad one - the series shows both sides of his character.  At the beginning of the series the first half of the show is given over to catching the killer and the second half of the show is the trial.  Will, he or she, be found guilty.  This is not so obvious in the 3rd series, where there may be a trial or not.  I hope that we will see a series 4 and 5 (I believe they are available on European format, but not yet ready for US release).  A good series which I suggest you begin at the beginning and go through since this will give you a sense of the characters and their place in the story line.  I recommend you buy it.

3479467,3,B001B1Q2UY,"I really appreciate the review here given by Donegal Dan, as he mentions the grim and grisly nature of crimes investigated in this series.  With La Plante's writing, this series has been compared to Prime Suspect.  And there definitely are many commonalities between the two series.  Yet, where they differ is the reason for my dropping a couple of stars from my rating (certainly not due to the direction or casting, both of which are excellent).  No, what Prime Suspect has that Trial and Retribution does not is Helen Mirren, who manages to bring such humanity to her character.  And, by this I mean, not only the human impact of dealing with the sordid and disturbing elements of crime, but Helen Mirren's capacity to bring to whatever she does a fully 3-dimensional character.  That is missing in T&R -- La Plante offers us no real depth in the lead characters we're spending all this time with in T&R -- and the series is poorer for it.

It would help this series enormously were there some brighter lighting on the sets.  Spending an entire episode in the dimly or starkly lit rooms where most of the interpersonal 'action' takes place simply underscores that we're visiting a very dark layer of human society.  I realize that this is the point, but for a viewer, it can leave you feeling, ""Why did I subject myself to that for the past two hours when I could be uplifted by watching something with Helen Mirren Judi Dench instead?""  My point about the lighting is that there is no relief anywhere -- and, since most of us are not studying to become criminalists but are looking for a captivating viewing experience, the dark feel and look of these episodes can feel overbearing.

Yes, this series is a solid production with many strong elements.  But it does leave a foul taste when the story is done (or as Donegal Dan put it), it can 'turn your stomach.' Indeed, yes.  I won't be continuing with Season 2 -- I've had quite enough, thank you.",1233014400,25,1951,4.604046242774566

She puts up with a lot more than most women would as a police officer.  She is always kind and congenial.

The part I did not like about the series is that the lawyers who are to represent the people being charged are simply worthless.  The ones who are for the defense of the criminal always seem to be the very best.  They tie knots in the prosecution. It is almost as though the accuses  have not one to prosecute.  The lawyers laugh and joke between themselves and walk out after the judgement is made and all go for a drink..  Not one cares who lied or cheat but just want to go have a good time together.
