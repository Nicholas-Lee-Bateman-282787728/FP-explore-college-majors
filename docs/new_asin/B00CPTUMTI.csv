5734006,4,B00CPTUMTI,Different from what I thought it would be.  It was more like a play and I was thinking a movie.  It was good.  I liked the actor (Leon).,1380153600,,136,3.7857142857142856

5734045,5,B00CPTUMTI,"This movie really took me for a loop. Just when my wife and I thought this movie was predictable as a lot of others like weve seen, they fooled us! It had a really good twist and overall, it was great.",1392422400,3,201,3.926829268292683
5734046,5,B00CPTUMTI,This is a Sunday treat!  A kick back relax and put a dvd in movie.  Me and my husband enjoyed it.  We actually rented from Redbox on vacation with another couple. It really opened the doors on a great conversation.  I had to buy it. I highly recommend!,1390348800,,252,4.1875
5734047,3,B00CPTUMTI,This film discusses issues of trust and self image in life and relationships. I thought that the men in this film were a bit stiff. They didn't really seem interested in their women and these were some cuties. It's a clean film. it would be rated PG. Leon is as cool as ever. Essence is cute as usual and plays her part well. Recommended for fans of romantic comedies.,1388880000,,368,4.3478260869565215
5734048,5,B00CPTUMTI,"Wonderful message in the story,Will share with friends short but you get the point I must say it was good.",1384819200,,106,4.35
5734049,5,B00CPTUMTI,This play is really starting from the beginning of one relationship that truly helps a person to know them selves before starting something what God had created his/her path of love. God is love and sometime friend and family members help you along the way with the love they have within for that person to be happy in life. God is love and only God's can guide you to your destiny of love.,1384041600,,390,4.3561643835616435
