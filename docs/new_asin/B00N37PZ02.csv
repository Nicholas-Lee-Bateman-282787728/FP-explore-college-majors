8675962,1,B00N37PZ02,"Do NOT waste your time on this movie. The beginning was good however after he killed the guy in the middle of the movie the rest was just about him trying to hide it, which was a big waste of time. I wanted to know what the hole was in the version and more about the girl he left behind but the movie was pointless after he killed Teddy.",1452902400,,337,3.898550724637681

8675964,2,B00N37PZ02,"I watch a lot of thrillers, documentaries, indie films and foreign films...some of which are slow moving. A lot of them, though, have a twist that you wouldn't have even seen coming. This one didn't have a ""twist"". It just showed something that was omitted earlier in the movie. On top of that, it was totally anti-climactic. I wouldn't watch it again and am glad it was free. I really thought (and hoped) there would be some big twist, but it left me wanting.",1447718400,,460,4.488095238095238

8675966,5,B00N37PZ02,"This is a really fine piece of film making, beautifully shot in northern New England, gripping and nuanced both in terms of character and morality. Joel de la Fuente (1st Lieutenant Paul Wang in Space: Above and Beyond, Peter Davies in 100 Centre Street) plays a software engineer who has exited nicely from a large acquisition. He's happily married, and is proud of his new chapter in life, but he and his partners left some dubious things dangling from their freewheeling time getting rich in Prague (code, love...) and one of the former partners (so he thought) didn't exit as handsomely as he thought he deserved and he shows up in New Hampshire with an agenda. Holy sh*t, this is a good film. If you like thrillers that have not been extruded from the Hollywood sausage factory, watch Brief Reunion.",1446336000,4,804,4.75
