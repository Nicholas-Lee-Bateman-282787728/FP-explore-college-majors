5424322,1,B00AGJYJZM,I actually bought this on amazon rather than wait for netflix to get it because I love gay flicks. But the only way I could watch this was to do it on fast forward.  The main flaw - I just did not care about any of the characters - there was zero character development. Boring dialogue.  Cardboard characters.  Dull lives.  The whole premeise of listening thru the air duct was boring and lame.  If I sound angry I am - I am desperate for good gay movies and the last one I saw that really moved me was Brokeback - precious little after that breakthru film.  Half way thru watching this I wondered - did the players - directors - producers - actually sit thru the dailies and find this the slightest bit interesting? If they did - they have no business being movie makers.,1360540800,5,772,4.289655172413793
5424323,5,B00AGJYJZM,"I watched it twice, it was so good! Matt Riddlehoover's best film yet in my book! I can't wait to see what else comes from this man! So many twists and turns leading us back to exactly what we wanted. Loved it!!!",1358812800,,212,4.071428571428571
5424324,5,B00AGJYJZM,This was a good movie but not great.  It shows how things can go wrong and love is right in front you.  This movie is worth buying for your collection.  One thing though the main character looked better with his beard than when he shaved it off LOL.,1357862400,,249,4.145833333333333
5424325,3,B00AGJYJZM,"I wanted to give this movie more stars. Really did. It is well photographed, the acting is good, the storyline is interesting, the comedy lines are great, and it's a well constructed film. More than anything, it feels like a Woody Allen type film, where people all talk like they really do in real life and illustrate how they deal with real life situations. I felt like I was eavesdropping in on the actual lives of the characters while watching the film.

The female lead was ""something else"". Kind of like a white trailer trash macho male, talking about all manner of things that offend ""his ego"", and hooked up on trolling for p...y wherever he can find it. Somebody should have washed her mouth out with Lava soap at some point, but then again she would not have been nearly as funny.

I think the title of the film should have been ""all the interesting things that come up when you don't have a life"". Here we have a protagonist who is out of love, out of work, out of ideas. And then things just start popping up in his life that are interesting. From the neighbors upstairs who he overhears and draws the wrong conclusions, to a new slant on his relationship with his former boyfriend, who has moved away, but helps him to understand what is happening in his new life alone. And then there's the new guy in his life that just pops up in the form of a maintenance man.

What he does about all the new happenings in his life seem really true to form from the perspective of the gay subculture. How relationships begin, develop, continue or end in the culture is accurately portrayed in the film with a happy ending to boot. What could be better?

So, why only the 3 stars. There are two significant flaws in the film that unfortunately diminish what it could have been.  The first is a production values issues. It is very difficult to hear what people are saying in the film, especially when you hear them talk through the air duct.  There are no subtitles available with the film, so it is very difficult to pick up lots of the dialogue unless you turn up the volume way too high. And then, there is a more serious problem with the music in the film. It is obvious that Mark is trying to imitate Woody Allen with his musical choices. The music is great, BUT it needs serious editing.

The music is so loud and played when people are talking, that it drowns out the dialog. And it comes up at inappropriate times in the film as well. It looks like the director didn't understand that the music should be an accent to the dialog and action, not in place of it. Perhaps the director should watch more Allen movies to see how the master interweaves the dialog and music into the context of the film. That would have really helped here.

None the less, an interesting film that merits even a second viewing.",1357171200,3,2810,4.411196911196911
5424326,3,B00AGJYJZM,"Scenes From A Gay Marriage is a movie with its share of eye candy. There are some handsome men in this film. And there are some funny moments too. But the story isn't that great. And the sound isn't, either. For example, a lot of Matt Riddlehoover's dialogue was really hard to hear on my computer. This isn't a bad movie, and I would recommend it to gay film fans because it has cute guys who are gay. But I wish it would have been better and some nudity wouldn't have hurt. It would have surely helped!",1356912000,,504,4.206185567010309
5424327,4,B00AGJYJZM,"This is such a cute movie, definitely better than I was expecting. I feel like Darren's sort of creepy obsession over his neighbors is so relatable, even though it is a bit taboo. Really, there are so many aspects of this movie that are just spot-on interpretations of real life, especially any dialogue involving Luce. It's a simple movie, but it's very engaging and there are lots of layers to unpack. It certainly doesn't have the highest production value but for an indie movie this was certainly very enjoyable.",1497398400,,516,4.808988764044944

The pacing is pointlessly slow at times, the lead is more pathetic and self indulgent than he needs to be which makes the attraction of the handsome maintenance guy a little inauthentic, but it is ok.

5424344,1,B00AGJYJZM,"One is embarrassed to have watched such an execrable movie, nearly plotless, self-indulgent, predictable as a bad, deservedly rejected TV pilot, full of clichs and wooden dialogue, dwelling on a character who is unaccountably vain, clueless, incessantly annoying, and apparently lacking in any sense of morality or scruples, a movie that seems at times improvised with no sense of direction or point and, because it is so inept and mindless, is boring from beginning to end.  Spare yourself the pain of having seen it.  I wish I had had the good sense to quit watching it after the first few minutes.  I suppose, if there is some strange attraction in continuing to watch something this bad grow increasingly worse, like the slow onset of a drought, it's best to be warned and avoid it.  That a film as insufferable as this one engendered some kind of sequel is mind-boggling.",1478304000,,876,4.859060402684563

There are a lot of indie movies about the gay lifestyle, and most of them fall short in some areas; too goofy, to dramatic, unrealistic, or poor acting, writing or directing.

5424375,1,B00AGJYJZM,"Super boring movie. Those high ratings must be friends of the film-maker. The movie is NOT romantic, sexual, intelligent, spiritual, motivational, or anything that matters to a human being. It's not even about a gay marriage. The characters are not married. There are no scenes that have any meaning or about a marriage. Wasteful time. I watched the entire movie thinking something of value will soon come about in this movie, but nothing. The storyline is actually a disgrace to the gay community because it definitely doesn't show gay people as nice people.

The main character likes the neighbor who lives upstairs, but he listens to his neighbor's business through a vent in his apartment. His nosy body doesn't listen just for himself; he shares it with his friend, stranger and ex-boyfriend about it. He then steals the guy's key (neighbor) to snoop in his home. Who does that? I would be freaked out if I had a neighbor like that. Instead, the guy upstairs falls for this psycho downstairs who he knew stole his key. This movie is a misrepresentation of gay people as if they have no common sense, which is not right. The actors have no acting talent and whoever wrote the story is not creative at all.  Did I already say, this is a SUPER BORING MOVIE???",1465776000,,1261,4.701357466063349

5424423,3,B00AGJYJZM,"The title is a play on Ingmar Bergman's Scenes From a Marriage. You could say it covers a bit of the same territory--as any movie about marriage/relationships would. But the tone and construction of the movie owes more to Woody Allen's work.

The comparison is impossible not to make. Music is used like Allen uses it, and the early jazz guitar instrumentals sound almost identical (maybe they are) to music in many of Allen's films. The music serves not just as a bridge between scenes or for montages, but it sometimes plays under dialog too. Allen does the same thing.

The vagueness of relationships, how they've come to be formed, and what they are is also Allen-esque, as is the primary plot device: overhearing ""scenes"" from neighbors' gay marriage and becoming obsessed by one half of the couple who might potentially become eligible. And there's an effort to keep the plot from overwhelming the film, to keep it somewhat light and abstract, enough to make it feel modern and sophisticated. All this seems a little too much--it comes dangerously close to being more about style than substance.

The dialog rings true enough even if the encounters between characters seem implausible or forced. I kept thinking that there were paths the writer could have taken that would have made this really interesting, but instead it stays pretty safe. Unfortunately playing it safe doesn't make for a great film, or one that is compelling. But this did hold my interest, I'll say that much. And there's a lot about it that is original.

I don't know why I'm reluctant to call this good. It's very watchable. But just as the movies of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allan aren't for everybody, neither is this. And don't get the idea that it's that kind of quality--it isn't. But it aspires to be, and that's worth something.",1444953600,3,1814,4.80448717948718

5424440,3,B00AGJYJZM,"Matt Riddlehoover's name now synonymous with gay indie cinema, so I thought I'd give his films a chance. After seeing them, I'm not sure it's worth others doing so. ""Scenes From A Gay Marriage"" is the best of them for one reason, and it's because he writes characters that we rarely see in most low-budget gay films. Centered around an apartment complex near Nashville, the film develops into a rhythm that mimics Woody Allen's films, complete with jazzy standards as the soundtrack.

Riddlehoover writes, directs, and produces the film, but also acts in the lead role, and one would expect that, by casting reality TV star Jared Allman as his love interest, he's just trying to score screen time with a hottie and make the film all about himself. However, Allman's performance lends a surprising sweetness and grounded quality to the story as the building handyman with a haunting past but a desire to build a better future for himself. The film's main plot lacks much direction, centering around a new gay couple in the building who are making so much noise during sex, they keep everyone awake through the vents. When it develops into a Scooby Doo style mystery, as happens in some of Allen's best comedies, it becomes a distraction here, but it allows a good number of well-constructed characters to chime in on how to solve it. The chemistry amongst Riddlehoover's cast can be felt throughout, and it makes sense why there would have been an interest in seeing how these characters continue to bond and evolve over time.

Overall, the film has flaws, including audio that is all over the place and uninspiring photography, but it feels like a natural progression throughout, one where you don't feel like actors are trying to convince the audience they're not acting. It seems Riddlehoover got lucky on this project, given the projects that followed however. ""Scenes From A Gay Marriage"" shows that there's potential for better work to come.",1437091200,,1946,4.893939393939394

Also, am I the only one who thought this movie was rather ""Woody Allen"" like?

Loved how the film portrays characters outside of the stereotypes. Darren's best friend Luce, is seriously overweight, yet she has a man who is seriously in love with her. Darren is not what I would call super attractive, but yet Joe, who IS HOT, is seriously in love with Darren. So, this movie is so current in that you don't have to look like a superstar to find love. Sure, this is common sense, but it's good to see it reaffirmed on the big screen.

Lastly, the film is penetrating in that it explores lust, desire, fidelity and doesn't shy away from those issues. I love it and will watch again. Great movie!",1436227200,2,929,4.421052631578948

The handyman is a delight as is the female character who is also seeking love but settling for something else.  This directer put this together in an intelligent manner.

5424521,1,B00AGJYJZM,"What a waste of time!
This is one of the worst movies we've seen!!
The only reason we continued to watch was because we paid for it.
There is no connection between the characters, the lines are mundane, no realism & there isn't even nudity to compensate for the terrible plot.
Be weary when the same person Produces, Acts, Directs & Edits.
The sad part is that Matt Riddlehoover made a sequel to this garbage & has made other movies.",1424476800,3,433,4.425

5424524,5,B00AGJYJZM,"This is a intriguing film, that I already want to watch a second time because it was so enjoyable. There are some scene-stealing performances and a story that keeps you wanting more. I especially like that it is reminiscent of thought provoking 80s films, but in a contemporary environment. Scenes from a Gay Marriage does an excellent job of involving the audience, because you become so immersed in the characters immediately. I am definitely looking forward to the sequel!",1373846400,3,475,5.025316455696203
5424525,3,B00AGJYJZM,"I had expected a faster paced movie. This was like watching molasses drip from a cold spoon. But the overall film was very good. And I laughed more times than I could count. The movie has an interesting range of people, including the lost lover, of course the ""married"" couple, the requisite woman sensitive to gays and very open, and some hunky men. It's a good film, it just moved to slowly.",1371340800,4,393,4.472222222222222

5424529,5,B00AGJYJZM,"""Scenes From A Gay Marriage"" was smart, realistic, unpredictable, had nice eye candy and funny.

I would definitely recommend this movie; It's worth the watch. I'm really glad to have it in my movie collection. This is my first Matt Riddlehoover movie, but I'll keep an eye out for his other movies.",1364515200,2,299,4.75
5424530,4,B00AGJYJZM,"I think the film was awesome! The acting was superb and the direction was very well thought out and purposeful. I have seen some of Matt's earlier work and was very excited to see this film. The characters actually made me care about what was going to happen next. I recommend this film to ANYONE gay or straight who believes that love will always ""start again"" whenever its ready!",1363219200,4,381,4.536231884057971
5424531,5,B00AGJYJZM,"Here is why I like Matt Riddlehoover's films: his work is fearless and true.  And, in this case, funny and sad and sweet and annoying and all those things that make up real life.  The main character, Darren (played by Riddlehoover), doesn't have a life - at least not his own.  He careers from being muse to one man and fetish to another, to unwittingly becoming a detective obsessed with figuring out the relationship of a gay couple in his apartment building.

We, in turn, are invited to become detectives trying to figure out Darren.  Our first discovery is that Darren is not, as might seem at first glance, shallow and narcissistic; rather, he is brittle and self-protective.  Our best ally in tracking Darren as he tracks his upstairs neighbors is Director of Photography Shane Bartlett, whose brilliant and rather sly cinematography plays Watson to the audience's Sherlock, and forges a delightful partnership with us for an hour and a half.

Riddlehoover demonstrates authorial and directorial maturity in trusting the story, the actors, and us.  He never resorts to expository dialogues or emotional catharses to force epiphanies about Darren upon us, nor is the comedic ever a substitute for substance.  As a result, Darren's own simple transformation from brittle to flexible is enough joy to make this movie worthwhile.",1362787200,6,1332,5.045662100456621
5424532,5,B00AGJYJZM,"I'm a relatively new fan of Matt Riddlehoover, but a big fan I am. This latest release from him is my favorite so far, as it offers a great mix of comedy and intrigue. ""Scenes from a Gay Marriage"" gives us a really delicious look into the life of Darren (Riddlehoover) and his at-times voyeuristic ways. He develops wonderful friendships with Joe (the apartment handyman) and Luce, a woman he meets in the building's gym. The script is so incredibly relatable, and I found myself easily involved in each of the main characters' lives. The cast is fantastic, particularly the performances by Jared Allman (Joe), and Thashana McQuiston (Luce). Finally, I can't stress enough on the talent of Riddlehoover as actor, writer, director and producer; he really shines on all counts. If ""Scenes"" is a peek into what's to come from Matt & Company, we're definitely in for a treat. I'm absolutely looking forward to enjoying his future films.",1362441600,,932,4.867924528301887
8551379,5,B00AGJYJZM,"LOL I thought this was going to be a gay version of the Burton/Taylor film ""Divorce His, Divorce Hers"". Really it is so much more. I don't know who to blame it on, whether it's the director, the script, the casting, the actors, the cinematography, or the editing but I think that if this film had had a bigger budget it wouldn't have been as good. It really feels like a pivotal period in someone's life. The real reason I'm writing this review though is for the the thrill I got when the soundtrack started playing Django Reinhardt. It took me a few seconds to realize that was what I was hearing but then I gagged. Whoever is responsible for selecting the central character's record collection is genius AF.",1530662400,,709,4.503875968992248
