If you're sick of merry widow, gypsy princess and fledermaus, this is where to be. you'll have as great a time as mausi.",1320883200,2,552,4.3076923076923075
8349784,4,B0023GFW0M,"This is a lovely, straight forward rendition of a little known 1930 operetta.  The music is Hungarian folk music themed and the program is performed in Hungarian.  The images are clear, the color good and the sound reasonable.  The sets are simple but effective. The English subtitles make sense and are easy to read; they do not interfere with viewing the images.  At times the dancing seems a bit simplistic but both the soloists and chorus are solid.  As with most operettas there is a considerable amount of dialogue, reading the subtitles are a must unless one knows Hungarian.  If one is new to operetta this is not the one to start with.  Consider instead the many fine performances of Die Fledermaus or Die Lustig Witwe.  If one is new to Hungarian folk music themed operetta, Grafin Mariza is probably a better choice.  However, if you know Grafin Mariza and want more in a similar folk idiom than you will greatly enjoy this performance.  This is a perfomance that I can watch multiple times with enjoyment at each viewing.",1294531200,4,1033,4.720670391061453
8349785,5,B0023GFW0M,"A wonderful presentation of this classic operetta, filmed in the Budapest Operetta Theater in 1992 where it was originally first performed in 1930.  It is sung in the original language of Hungarian, with German and English subtitles.  Since the story is about Hungarians and happens partially in Hungary, it is most appropriate that it is performed in the original language, with native performers who have the national passion and feeling needed for this story.",1282176000,2,462,5.22972972972973
8349786,4,B0023GFW0M,"A quite revival of an operetta that used to be liked before World War II.  The operetta is a cheerful collection of nice tunes based on Hungarian folk music, dancing and nostalgia of pre-war productions. The nazis made all the efforts to eradicate all of the Jewish composer Paul Abraham's work, and they almost succeeded, so it is very commendable to see this revival on a DVD. The plot also has some political tones as the bad guys are the Russians. With all those ingredients, nostalgia, anti-Russian, nice melodies and the usual happy ending of an operetta it is not a surprise the Hungarian audience seems very happy with the production.
The singers/dancers/actors are fine. It really looks like a nascent Broadway production of the 1930's.
The image quality is similar to a VHS one, and, although the package says the sound can be Digital 5.0, I couldn't play other than normal Stereo, nothing compares to current DVD and Blue-Ray technologies, but... still a quite and worthwhile revival.
Four starts for the revival effort.",1241308800,8,1031,4.925287356321839
