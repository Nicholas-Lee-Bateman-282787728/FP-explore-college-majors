8083380,5,B000B8IAAI,"This is an amazing film which attributes the beginning of HIV to the polio vaccine and the egos of those who were in competition to win: Salk, Sabin, and Kaprowski. The epicenter is traced to the late 1950s in Africa. This brings questions about the pharmaceutical companies as well as research ethics and on whom such things should be tested. See this film!",1392422400,,358,4.698412698412699
8083381,5,B000B8IAAI,"If you are confused about why we have aids and where did it come from, and you aren't buying the popular explanation, watch this. The actual people who did it admit what they did, all except for the Dr. who was responsible. (and his boss)",1391644800,,238,4.311111111111111

8083383,5,B000B8IAAI,"I smell a serious ""conspiracy"" in the air surrounding this documentary. This is one of the most important docs ever produced, and yet it's OFFICIAL release on DVD continues to be held up and held up and held up some more! This documentary [*Note: its actual title is ""The ORIGINS of AIDS""] offers the most plausible (and most probable) explanation regarding the ""hows"" and the ""whys"" behind the flashpoint & global explosion of this deadly and dreaded disease! The ""timeline"" fits; the ""pattern of spread"" fits; the ""science"" fits; the ""eyewitness testimony"" fits; the ""industry's silence"" fits! It is close to impossible to even find it surreptitiously uploaded on the Web... you'd LITERALLY have better luck finding major blockbuster hits posted all over the Internet on public forum hosting sites like YouTube and MetaCafe before you'd come across this movie where it had not been rapidly ripped down from public view! What are they afraid of? If they aren't trying to ""hide"" anything, then why all the silence & secrecy? We demand answers! We demand that this program be given an *OFFICIAL* DVD RELEASE!",1277683200,4,1107,5.021739130434782
8083384,5,B000B8IAAI,"Despite the mellifluous voice of the female narrator, this fierce, aggressive documentary ignores the protestations of medical science and stalks to its conclusion, i.e. that Hilary Koprowski's oral polio vaccine, given to over a million Africans in the late 1950s, caused the AIDS pandemic in Africa and, by extension, around the world.

The meeting of the Royal Society that tendentiously debunked Edward Hooper's book THE RIVER doesn't hinder the filmmakers, who journey to Africa to interview those who were employed by Koprowski to catch chimpanzees, to kill chimpanzees, to remove their kidneys, and to use the kidney tissue to make a polio vaccine. Despite the stout denials of Koprowski and his associate Paul Osterreith, who directed the project, the African lab workers leave no doubt that chimpanzees, and not the lower monkeys who are the usual choice for OPV, were used at Lindi Camp to make the vaccine.

""The most hated hypothesis in science,"" i.e. that our victory over polio caused the AIDS epidemic, is set forth here with cogency and power. The stars of the show (along with Koprowski) are Edward Hooper, a charming, soft-spoken man, and Cecil Fox, an angry pathologist who explains that we now know how to synthesize polio vaccine genetically, but the pharmaceutical companies and the doctors are still injecting monkey parts into children because this is the cheaper way to do it.

Bill Hamilton, the legendary evolutionary biologist, is seen, expressing his chagrin at science's ""almost paranoid rejection"" of the OPV theory. Hamilton later died of malaria on a trip to Africa with Hooper to find samples of monkey stool which might have shed light on the relationship between the simian and human viruses.

Significantly, the white technicians and scientists who worked at Lindi Camp are evasive about their role in manufacturing the vaccine and killing the chimpanzees, while the black African workers are categorical in telling us the chimps were killed for their kidney tissue and the vaccine was made from that tissue.

A powerful, disturbing  documentary, filled with warnings not only about AIDS but about the diseases that may arise in the future as a result of our head-in-the-sand attitude toward the mistakes science can make.",1273190400,4,2259,5.1923076923076925
8083385,5,B000B8IAAI,"I too was disappointed to find that Amazon does not stock this convincing video expose on the origin of AIDs bourne of the polio vaccine work done in the Congo.  I have found it in downloadable form on youtube, and other places.  I am very disappointed that the reviewer here has chosen this forum to spew his hate and obscenity.  The customer images here are repulsive and hateful and I am certain illegal.  Sal Magnum, clean it up.",1201305600,,433,4.512820512820513
8083386,5,B000B8IAAI,"As a (retired) physician, I found Edward Hooper's book, The River, convincing when I read it shortly after it was publiched.  The documentary is remarkably well done, and only adds additional layers of credibility to Hooper's fine work and his ultimate hypothesis that the unrefined use of chimp kidneys in polio virus tissue cultures had a terribly unanticipated effect.",1196467200,11,371,5.288135593220339
8083387,5,B000B8IAAI,"I came across this doc on the sundance channel which when i wrote to had no response about the film, I tried to tell them to please air the film again because i'm starting to believe it is the only way i will ever get of copy of this film which is a must see but is harder to find than anything i have ever been after. if your inclined to seek out this as thought i have contact Galafilm  website it seems to be the only one who is selling the film over the phone and payment by check.  hopefully though this film will reach the public when the stars of this disaster are no longer living to block it from the market. good hunting!!",1185753600,3,632,4.007936507936508
8083388,5,B000B8IAAI,"This is a powerful and insightful documentary which everyone who thirsts for the truth, and is opposed to government concocted myths,should get a chance to view. Unfortunately, like a myriad of other ""anti-conformist"" resources, be they books, dvds or otherwise, Amazon has taken the high road and sought our best interests by not stocking the real deals. This cowardly self-censoring is yet another example of how the oversee-ers of the industrial complex aim towards hiding the truth by the process of omission. Good job Amazon!! In many other cases you may still procure copies of desired materials through the Amazon subsidiaries, but in this case, everyone appears to be fresh out. At least fresh out since I've been looking for this several months ago. If anyone has information on where I can procure this documentary, please leave it in a review or contact me, thanks, Sal Magnum",1184371200,9,887,5.040816326530612
8083389,5,B000B8IAAI,"When ever Multinational corporations or Governments hide evidense, contradict themselves, force people to accept their demands, and stop all further official investigations then we all must take notice of documentaries (such as this) that informs us of past events and facts that contradicts official statements. We are left with more questions that need to be answered under the law with penalty of purgery. This documentary is a must see for everyone concerned about the health care industry. We need to understand the practices of the pharmaceuticals that control everything from drugs, vaccines to livestock and our food supplies!

After viewing this documentary today on the sundance channel I came here to amazon to purchase it! I highly recommend this dvd as a must see because it raises health concerns beyond only HIV/AIDS. We are confronting frightening issues of vaccine protocols, quality controls, public safety and secrecy. The medical industry is not policing itself (and governments are failing at this too), we still don't know how HIV, or Mad Cow disease developed, and we don't know the long term effects of vaccines and steroids in our livestock on our children's health. This documententary sheds light on irresponsible practices of developing vaccine cultures.",1165104000,5,1282,5.378109452736318
