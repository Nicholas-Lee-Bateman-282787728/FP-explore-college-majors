Kudos to him...",1500076800,,126,5.0476190476190474
7845552,3,6303397069,"this movie is a 1980's giallo or thriller that was shot in the english
language which is great.  The movie is not great but it is good and enjoyable.  A twin brother from wyoming , u.s.a has visions that his sister has been murdered and he goes off to Milan , italy to find out what happened to her.  He runs into the great Donald Pleasance who plays a homicide detective.  He isn't believed but a series of murders changes that situation.  The murderer uses the giallo standard black gloves as the killings take place with a pair of scissors.  The movie is a average giallo without any real sex scenes but of course the standard female nudity that most giallos have, and if you like thrillers, murder mysteries and cool 1980's music then you will enjoy this movie.  and it is available on dvd now from finland with it's english language intact.  For some reason no seller on amazon uk or amazon.com has it yet unfortunately.  It's called 'modell mordene"" or 'nothing underneath""  on that dvd and it's a good item to get if you collect giallos.  The picture looks pretty good although the sound is 2.0 stereo and not 5.1 as the box states as the movie was not shot in 5.1.  you can grab this tape which is in standard videotape quality.
 but the dvd is much better and it is in widescreen. let's  hope some seller finds a copy of that dvd and puts it on amazon so giallo fans with all region dvd players can watch it.",1226188800,4,1417,4.358778625954199
