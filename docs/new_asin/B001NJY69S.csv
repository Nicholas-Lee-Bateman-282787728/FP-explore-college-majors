3719372,5,B001NJY69S,"I was glad I finally ordered this compilation of the best music (in my opinion) ever recorded. This music is so well orchestrated, beautiful lyrics, it touches the heart. Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, MFSB, and everyone who was instrumental in putting the Philly sound together are
truly ambassadors of great music!  I love the whole set and got 5 of my friends to order it also..check it out folks..you will NOT be disappointed.",1236297600,,427,4.77027027027027

3719374,2,B001NJY69S,I am not a fan of remake groups. 80 percent of the performers are remake or spin off groups. If you are looking for original artist preforming their songs this dvd is not it.,1446422400,6,174,4.147058823529412

3719391,5,B001NJY69S,"The Love Train:  TSOP is indeed a delight in that some of my favorite peformers were on this DVD. I was really impressed with the artist that did Billy Paul's ""Me and Misses Jones.""  The TSOP Band is out of sight. Highly recommend it to whomever is reading this review.",1373846400,2,269,4.36

3719393,5,B001NJY69S,"I love purchasing box compilations! First and foremost, lots of music! Second, they include booklets containing lists of songs, histories of the record labels and artists. I own many box sets, and this compilation is a great edition!  Four CDs of songs from the late 60s, 70s, and 80s!  Artists such as the O'Jays, Patti LaBelle, Intruders, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes! The booklet contains the history of Gamble and Huff, architects of Philadelphia International Records, and essays from people in radio, and those who were a part of the Philly Sound. A must have for soul music lovers!",1369353600,,592,4.91

3719397,5,B001NJY69S,"If you love the Sound of Philly, this is the dvd for you. They're all there--Harold Melvin's Blue Notes, The O'Jays, The Delfonics, Jerry Butler, along with a full orchestra with violinists and mostly all musicians of color. Makes you proud.",1356480000,,241,4.902439024390244

3719399,2,B001NJY69S,Disappointed in this DVD which promised much more in the blurb.  A selection of just about OK preformances of not well-known numbers by artists well past their sell-by dates.  I expected something much more vibrant which would remind me of the good times.  Sadly I was left with a feeling of 'what was all that about?'.  Check very carefully before buying that the artists and numbers on the disc are really what you want to hear.  In my case they weren't and I didn't.,1297123200,,469,4.535714285714286
3719400,5,B001NJY69S,I have played this DVD several times since receiving it.  Each time it brings back great memories. I'am looking for more DVD concerts like this one...........The video and sounds are GREAT !,1283212800,5,190,4.9375
3719401,1,B001NJY69S,They reall should include a list of the acts live here and where is this coming from what venue.,1268265600,3,96,4.105263157894737
3719402,4,B001NJY69S,if you are a 60s to 80s inspire person by music then this will be a great listening DVD. The O'Jays make the ending of the DVD great by singing Love Train.  They should have sang it a little longer though.  But putting that aside to hear music that people sang and not rap or not even really have the talent to sing makes this such a good DVD.,1264809600,,343,3.9565217391304346
3719403,5,B001NJY69S,I enjoy the music and performances everytime I watch the DVD. Great music from great performers.,1261699200,,96,5.0625
3719404,5,B001NJY69S,"A Fantastic Concert and tribute to a great style of music, in particular great to see the O'jays, good sound and vision quality and no awful over-dubbing of crowd cheering as is usual on these types of DVD, shame there was no Lou Rawls though, all in all well worth the money!",1260835200,2,276,4.326923076923077
3719405,5,B001NJY69S,"I have received the Love Train DVD only yesterday 21 November 2009. My family and I have watched and countenance the DVD. It really epitomizes what I have been yearning; longing and hoping to see and that is, all the TSOP legends on stage.

The making of the DVD, stage appearances and composure of all musicians made and mark this DVD finest.

The Maestro Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff words are not enough to thank you and to put all this into perspective.

The Musicians:Harold Melvin and the Blue notes Cameron, Bunny Sigler, Butler The O;jays ect. The music is ageless, timeless and still sound excellent.

Quite amazing, Bunny Sigler bolted and stretched his breath to make Me and Mrs Jones outstanding. Thanks Mr Sigler

This is what you call value for money. I only wish that this could be followed by good series of best songs ever originated by TSOP

The Ojays visited South Africa in October. I was absolutely dazzled by their performances. These three fabulous gentlemen have nothing but love for music. My wish is to have The Ojays DVD. Last but not least,I have but one talent lodged with me uselessly and the only wish is, to unlock it by cutting a song with The Ojays.

Thank you Profusely

3719407,5,B001NJY69S,"This is an awesome DVD.
However one can miss some Philly icons this is a great show.
The O'Jays still rock and especially Bunny Siglers performance of Me & Mrs Jones
is awesome and makes you forget about Billy Paul.
Harold Melvins Blue Notes still got the rythm and steady sound, they rock!
The band is just great and really creates the Philly sound.
Its great to see those old geezers are still going strong.
Also nice is the Gamble & Huff documentary unvealing history on
Philadelphia International Records and its artists.
Definitely a must-have!",1256342400,3,549,4.7894736842105265
3719408,5,B001NJY69S,Years ago I went to a Barry White concert in Berlin.  The warmup acts were The Sound of Philadelphia orchestra and the Three Degrees.  It was a joy to find this video reproduction of some of the greatest purveyors of the smooth Philly sound and see some of the same acts that I had enjoyed a generation ago in Berlin.  The O'Jays and Harold Melvin are classic.  The old adage applies here:  They just don't make music like this anymore.  This DVD is a must in any collection of 70's and 80's music.,1252800000,2,498,4.301075268817204
3719409,5,B001NJY69S,"One of the best R&B concerts of it's kind. The acts were entertaining, freash and full of energy. It's not often you get to see the O'Jays on stage and they do not disappoint. You really can't go wrong if your a lover of R&B classics. I would highly reccomend it.",1242950400,3,263,4.176470588235294
3719410,4,B001NJY69S,"And to have music like this representing my hometown. Understandably, some of the vocals here aren't on a par with the original recordings, but the best gauge of the quality of Gamble and Huff's music is that it doesn't sound dated 35 years after it was created.

The only disappointment for me was that there wasn't more concert footage included (The Intruders are conspicuously missing). Even that is partially made up for by the inclusion of a 40 minute plus mini-documentary on the making of the DVD.",1242691200,21,504,4.793103448275862
3719411,5,B001NJY69S,"I buy al lot of ""american"" dvd's because in Europe these dvd's are not for sale. So everytime it's a bit of a surprise what you get. This dvd is amazing. The Sound and the performances of the O'Jays and Harold melvin make this dvd sparkling and takes you back to the seventies. My wish is to see those groups for once in my life. I hope they will come to Europe one of thes days!!!
Dont forget the bonus section with the full version of TSOP!!!! Dance across the room",1241913600,24,467,4.142857142857143
3719412,5,B001NJY69S,great dvd.  all the artists still sounded good.  The dvd could have been longer and more philly groups included....,1239753600,2,115,5.0
3719413,5,B001NJY69S,"I got a glimpse of this concert on PBS a few weeks ago and couldn't wait to purchase the DVD. This is the music I grew up on. Man! the music took me way back in the day, to those basement parties. I thought the production was great, the TSOP orchestra did a magnificient job and the sound quality was great. The best performance, in my book was by ""The Mighty O'jays"". They definitely brought the house down with a mini O'jays concert, belting out ""I love music"", ""She use to be my girl"" and ""Love train"". All the performances was good, even the bonus tracks by The Delfonics and Harold Melvin's Blue notes. The documentary as a bonus, was well put together and really gave you a good insight of the history of Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff the founders of TSOP.",1237161600,48,761,4.328671328671328
