I gave it a five star because of the great condition and quality but most of all because my family loves it!",1330300800,,258,4.395833333333333
8017631,4,B0001XAOT8,"In Entre Monjas Anda El Diablo(1973), a Catholic schoolteacher, Maria(Angelica Maria), falls in love with Vicente ""El Diablo/The Devil"", a guy who raises fighting roosters. Don Carlos(Rogelio Guerra) covets Maria. Sara Garcia(El Inocente), Ahui Camacho(Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia), Felipe Arriaga(El Coyote y La Bronca) and Alma Rosa Aguirre co-star. This film is a real gem from Mexico's past and its tame enough for the whole family...and TV airings. Angelica Maria looked very lovely at the age of 29. Interestingly, she appeared in more TV shows in the 1970's than movies. There's amusing scenes such as orphans accidentally hitting Vicente Fernandez against a post...or a rooster pecking Angelica Maria on her rear end! Some scenes are corny, but this film is a must-see for fans of Vicente Fernandez and Angelica Maria. It's 85 minutes of joy.",1263859200,2,858,5.22463768115942
