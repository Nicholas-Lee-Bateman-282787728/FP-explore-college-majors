4690513,5,B005GHJMUQ,"This History channel special is the best I have seen in years. While I always knew there was something special about being born and raised in the south, it was nice to hear that someone else recognized that fact. This is a terrific piece of work. Trace Adkins said it best in the closing....""The South is the soul of this nation"".",1320278400,16,330,4.426229508196721
4690514,5,B005GHJMUQ,"This is a great dvd, It is entertainning and has a lot of information I did not know.",1446422400,,85,3.7777777777777777

4690517,5,B005GHJMUQ,"I saw this as a rerun on a cable channel. When they got to Barbecue, I knew I had to get this for hubs, as he's a Southern Foodie. The entire documentary humorously catches the best flavors of the South, both sinful and redemptive. From football to religion, from moonshine to the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, if you want to peruse what it means to be Southern, you can't do better than this as your guide.",1436054400,,407,4.368421052631579
4690518,2,B005GHJMUQ,"I tried to watch with an open mind, but when Trace Adkins says the North has no soul, he plays into the stereotype of southern arrogant ignorance . Just looking at music - Motown has no soul? Chicago blues has no soul? Chicago blues came by way of Mississippi, and they did fine leaving the South permanently and making Chicago their sweet home.",1432944000,,345,4.492063492063492
4690519,5,B005GHJMUQ,"Educates and provides laughter as well.  I enjoyed it as an adult, the teenagers I sent it to loved it.  Originally shown on public TV.",1423612800,,135,4.36

4690521,5,B005GHJMUQ,I chose this rating because I really enjoy watching this program. I couldn't stop laughing while watching this from beginning to end. You Don't Know Dixie is a DVD I would recommend to someone who wanted to know the history about Dixie and all the inventions that were made in Dixie and are still used today.,1414540800,2,308,4.517857142857143

4690524,5,B005GHJMUQ,"Parts were very funny and I enjoyed it immensely. It should help my children and friends up north understand my roots and why I speak the way I do. The section on the origins of southern accents found in different parts of the south was especially enlightening. Southern accents don't mean you're stupid. I had to make a conscious effort to suppress mine while in school in Michigan to avoid the name calling and the assumption that I was slow. The section on our regional cuisine explained quite well why food ""down here"" is so much better than what one finds in Michigan. Unless you're talking about the food found at the ethnic festivals, southern cooking is still hard to beat.",1401753600,2,681,4.636363636363637
4690525,5,B005GHJMUQ,"We really enjoyed learning about the history of the south - inventions, war stories, etc.  Great entertainment for the entire family.",1399766400,,133,5.333333333333333

4690528,5,B005GHJMUQ,We saw this on the History Channel and had to buy it.  Anyone who is not familiar with how we do things in the South needs to see this.,1389571200,,135,3.6551724137931036
4690529,5,B005GHJMUQ,My husband and I watched this one Sunday instead of going to a movie and we really had a good time watching it. Learned some things about the people of the south and enjoyed the humor,1368489600,,183,4.111111111111111

4690535,5,B005GHJMUQ,This is a great video for southerners and non-southerners. Gives us a greater appreciation of our heritage. Well worth the money for young old alike,1362182400,8,148,4.96

4690539,5,B005GHJMUQ,"Arrived in appropriate time and in excellent condition.  Even tho I live in TN., they were right- I didn't know Dixie, or at least not nearly what I should have. It's informative and fun.  Charlotte (I will buy from this seller again.)",1334534400,5,235,4.571428571428571
4690540,5,B005GHJMUQ,"My Great Grandpa 5 or 6 removed was dumped on the shores of Virginia as a slave. With hard work the clan moved into the hills of Tennessee and leaves a rich  history for those of us that today are proud to be called ""Southern"". I enjoyed the trip down memory lane with the hosts and many memories from childhood were reborn. We are special, we are strong, and we are the foundation of this great country. Ever wonder why when something bad is happening someone will yell, ""Run for the hills""? Well now you know. It's the only safe place left.
If you don't understand us, watch this movie. If you want to remember your roots, watch this movie. You might just want to pick up a copy for your family, wouldn't hurt.",1332633600,14,712,4.313432835820896
