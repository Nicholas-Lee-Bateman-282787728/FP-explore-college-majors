8033489,1,B0002VOY4A,"If you've seen the original broad cast - it's nearly 3 1/2 hours long, they cut this so bad that it jumps from scene to scene and it's hard to even watch.  This release is 103 minutes not even 2 hours long!

I cannot understand WHY they would cut it like they did.  If you have any interest what so ever in seeing this wonderful movie - do not buy the US copy - get it somewhere else.  I wouldn't even waste my money, I serioiusly regret spending the money on it.",1120521600,18,463,4.0
8033490,2,B0002VOY4A,"""After the Deluge"" is the tale of four men of the Kirby family.
This film is about brothers,father and sons, and partnership.
There are excelent actors like Hugo Weaving, David Wenham,Ray Barrett. This film is very emotional and witty.
I love this drama.

But,This edition;released from BfS Entertainment/Mu is not good.
""After the Deluge"" had aired on Australian TV Channel Ten. Original film(Australian edition) is 194 minutes drama, but this edition is only 103 minutes drama.
This ""BfS Entertainment/Mu edition"" is shorter than that original Australian edition for 90 minutes.
Many important sequences were cut down.
Since the film become short,four men's conflict and struggle are fewer. And their Joy and happiness are fewer too.
The emotional impression has decreased.
This edition is too short for telling the Kirby's story.

I very regret that the edition shortened in this way was released in the United States.
We should appreciate the original edition. I wish that Amazon.com deals with the original edition.",1101168000,28,1020,5.329192546583851
8033491,5,B0002VOY4A,"I posted a review before this DVD was released, because I had seen the Australian version and had assumed they would keep it intact.  Hence the 5 star rating.  Now that I have seen the US version, I can't change the 5 star rating, but I can edit my review....

Why?

The region 4 (Australian) After the Deluge is an additional hour and a half long.  It originally aired on TV as a mini-series in two parts, a total of 3 hours.

This version (region 1, USA) has chopped the movie in half, and in doing so has changed some of the story, especially David Wenham's (Alex Kirby), changing his plot into one where he seems more like a cad, rather than a man learning from his mistakes.

Hugo Weaving's (Martin Kirby) plot is the one that's most intact.

This film has a lot going for it.  Fantastic actors like Hugo Weaving (Lord of the Rings, The Matrix), David Wenham (Lord of the Rings, Van Helsing), and Rachel Griffiths (Six Feet Under), fabulous cinematography, an incredible soundtrack and a story that will touch the hearts of everyone.

The movie is about four men and their struggles in life.  Cliff (Ray Barrett) is suffering from Alzheimers.  The one stern and strict father of Marty (Hugo Weaving), Alex (David Wenham) and Toby (Samuel Johnson) has now changed before them.  In his mind are memories he's never shared of a love he lost many years ago.

Meanwhile, Cliff's sons have to deal with their father's illness and the scars he gave them during their childhood.  Alex's life is turned upside down when his marriage crumbles.  After turning his back on his family and relationships, Marty has to come to terms with the reality that he can never be what he wanted all his life.  Toby, the once  neglected child, wants to prove he can be a good father, but he his wife has to get pregnant first, and they're having trouble with that.

This movie won several awards in Australia, including best actor (Ray Barrett) and best soundtrack.  David Wenham was also nominated as best actor.

I want to recommend this movie, but I was so disappointed at the hack job it got.  The original is a fantastic piece of work. However, if you can't see the original, then definitely see this one.  Just keep in mind that you might feel a little confused due to the holes in it.

If given a chance to change my rating, I'd give it 2 1/2 stars.  The story is strong, but it's got a lot of holes in it thanks to someone who thought US audiences wouldn't sit through a 3 hour movie.  Explain that one to me.",1093737600,26,2497,4.456953642384106
