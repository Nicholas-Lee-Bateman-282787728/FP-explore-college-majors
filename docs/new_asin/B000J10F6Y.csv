8148688,1,B000J10F6Y,I couldn't stop laughing at the TRAILER! The movie is crap.,1524960000,,59,4.454545454545454
8148689,2,B000J10F6Y,"The princess (Amelia Jackson-Gray) must traverse the forest of Sidhe because...well we lose sight of the mission, but it is only secondary anyway. The forest has Black Elves, a dragon, and a necromancer (Eliza Swenson) who wrote her own cringe worthy lines. Not too hard to figure out. The film is consumed with people walking in the woods with overly dramatic dialogue about fate, fear, and honor. CG dragon isn't that good either.

Guide: No sex or nudity. I did catch one F-bomb.",1417305600,,482,4.807228915662651
8148690,4,B000J10F6Y,"""Dragon"" is a low-budget fantasy movie.  It a mockbuster that capitalizes on the ""Eragon"" books and movie.  Despite that fact, the movie is enjoyable.

Good: Overall the good outweighs the bad.
* Most of the characters have personality, and each character has his own motives and dedication.
* The male and female characters are equally strong and mature.
* The movie usually makes sense.
* The musical score is good.

Bad:  Some of the bad points stick out and lower the enjoyment of this movie.
* The movie is lightweight; the sense of scale and importance is limited.
* The fey elf character is unnecessary, though she serves as a link between the Necromancer and the humans.
* The dragon is low-budget CGI; ignore the dragon or just pretend that dragons look like low-budget CGI.
* One of the actresses has a stuffed-nose or sinus blockage during one scene

Interesting:
* The movie does not have nudity and does not have any cursing.
* The amount of blood is low.
* The voiceovers at the beginning and end of the movie bookend the movie nicely rather than serving as some last-minute filler.

Overall, ""Dragon"" is a fun movie.  Sequels are welcome if they are at least as good as this movie.",1315612800,,1196,4.6350710900473935
8148691,4,B000J10F6Y,Seriously I didn't think I would like this film since I got it in a dollar bin. But I did enjoy it its corny and short but I enjoyed it alot. I loved the Necromancer character she was awesome. It kinda reminded me of guildwars a little. The dragon was cool for what it was Its clear that it is a beginers try at computer graphics but hey I'm not complaining I can't even come up with a stick figure on my computer ;-) The movie is Truely enjoyable. the storyline isn't to bad if you can get passed the fact that everything seemed cramed a bit as if they didn't have the time to perfect it but still its worth watching. However my big disappointment lies in the fact that it doesn't seem to be complete. It was quickly summed up at the end quickly cutting loose ends here and there but the box said its a trilogy? My question to all you Fantasy fans out there is Where are the other two movies??? I mean you get me hooked and then you leave me dry?? whats up with that? Anyway I suggest if you truely love fantasy films and you don't mind the corny special effects to give it a go but be warned you may be disappointed because it doesn't continue.,1213401600,3,1146,4.120535714285714
8148692,4,B000J10F6Y,"For this to be a bargain-bin movie, it is actually the best one I've seen yet. Directed by Leigh Scott and starring Eliza Swenson, Amelia Jackson-Gray, Jon-Paul Gates and Jeff Denton; this 2006 film is about Princess Vanir who must traverse the haunted forest of Sidhe in a desperate attempt to save her kingdom from an advancing army of dark elves. With the help of Cador and Artemir, they encounter a mysterious sorceress, an army of elves and a dragon hellbent in standing in their way. Considering this is part of a trilogy, I'm looking forward to the sequels in everyway. This movie might not be liked by most who saw it but, for those of us who accept it for what it is, it isn't that bad a flick. You can tell the movie was made on a modest budget but I've seen worse movies made for more.",1209168000,2,796,4.348993288590604
8148693,1,B000J10F6Y,"This is perhaps the worst film I've ever seen. It is about a group of people going off to kill a dragon. There are some evil elves too, who appear every once in a while and generally get chopped to pieces by the heroes. The special effects are probably done on a computer at home, they are awful. The movie appears to be filmed all in one location, possibly someone's backyard. The acting, surprisingly, isn't that bad, but the actors are given such hideously boring dialog to say, it doesn't matter.

The film basically worked like this. There is an action sequence, which isn't very exciting, and lasts about 1 minute. Then the characters talk for about 15 minutes. Then there is another action scene, then another 15 minutes of talking. Repeat.

Don't get me wrong, I generally like in movies when people talk. However, in this movie, there really isn't anything that important to say. The characters are just too boring and uninspired to care about. When they die, I felt, if anything at all, joy, because I'd no longer have to see them onscreen.

Anyway, I wouldn't even recommend this as a one dollar rental. Another reviewer said this is good camp fun, suggesting there was some humor here, but I have to disagree. I found nothing fun or funny about this movie at all. I don't even think there is an attempt at humor in it. It is just a serious and seriously bad movie.",1198195200,,1376,4.540322580645161
8148694,4,B000J10F6Y,"Being a lover of all things dragon, it warms my heart to see such a good storyline in such a low budget film.  If you can get over the lack of dazzle that top film company's provide us and if you can sit back and enjoy the dialog and allow it to carry the really interesting storyline - you will find a really decent film with some very good acting especially from the women. I enjoyed myself more than I thought for a low budget film, and I was still impressed with the special effects it did have.  If you at any time dreamed of land like Camelot, or if you played D&D, then this film is one you should see.  I am glad I did, and in fact - it is one I want to add to my collection.",1188086400,,683,3.8642857142857143
8148695,4,B000J10F6Y,"Dragon by Asylum Studios is a combination of every fantasy movie out there, with the heaviest influences coming from Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Eragon. There are the elves and dark elves, a hero with an unknown parent/destiny, dragons linked to their riders, and enough lines lifted directly from Star Wars and LOTR to make someone geeky enough to recognize the lines giggle (I count myself in that group since I did). Even though this is a direct mix of these movies, it somehow manages to become it's own appealing film.

Dragon is one of those movies that just grow on you, and before you know it you like it. In places the acting is wooden, and the lines are cheesy. The Dragon and special effects were obviously created at home on someone's computer. But this movie becomes a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. It comes a fun, compelling little fantasy movie that you want to finish watching.

This movie is supposed to be part of a trilogy (another Star Wars/LOTR lift) but I do hope they make the other two. I, for one, will add them to my collection.

If you're a serious fantasy fan and you think Tolkien is high literature and you can't stand the thought of someone spoofing LOTR this is NOT the movie for you. However, if you can stand a little camp and you're looking for a fun, enjoyable movie to fill 90 minutes of your life with brainless fantasy fun and smiles, this one is a GREAT bet.

Recommended to fans of direct to DVD fantasy.",1181779200,9,1470,4.433333333333334
