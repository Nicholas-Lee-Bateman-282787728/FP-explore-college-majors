448900,2,6302270847,"John Jakes' ""Kent Family Chronicles"" novels have long been favorites of mine and it was because of that, that I decided to recently revisit the television adaptations of the first three novels in the series from the late 1970s.  Of them, the adaptation of the first novel ""The Bastard"" was the best, being the most faithful translation of novel to screen with most of Jakes' dialogue left unchanged and only streamlined in spots.  Unfortunately in volume two, ""The Rebels"" there are a number of drastic changes and departures from Jakes' novel and the end result is very unsatisfying.  For one thing, in Jakes' novel Philip Kent and Judson Fletcher never meet!  We are also given a totally different fate for Philip's wife Anne, and many characters who had returned from ""The Bastard"" in the novel, such as Alicia Amberly and Captain Will Caleb are nowhere to be found in this adaptation, robbing it of some of its depth.  On top of that we get a too abrupt subplot invented for the film of Philip's father, James Amberly (Richard Basehart) coming to America and confronting his son, but what should have made for an interesting scene of drama is dispensed with too abruptly in an unsatisfying fashion.  In the end, the changes are just too great to make a fan of the book appreciate the effort.
The one redeeming feature of ""The Rebels"" however that makes it worth seeing is William Daniels reprising his ""1776"" role as John Adams (in another touch of irony, Daniels played Cousin Sam Adams in ""The Bastard""), and this time showing his depth as an actor by playing Adams closer to historical reality than the famous musical allowed.",1034294400,7,1633,4.773049645390071
7823674,5,6302270847,"Probably more deserving of 4 stars, but I'm inclined to give it 5 stars because Don Johnson is just so utterly delicious to watch. I was 4 years old when this aired, so obviously I didn't see it, but I've always been curious as it marries two of my favorite loves- history and Don Johnson. As long as you keep it in perspective- this is a 1979 mini-series- it is worth watching. The acting was decent. Don Johnson is very believable. The only thing that I will critique is the casting of Tonya Tucker. She has a great voice, but I've seen better acting in the worst of high school plays. I take into account her popularity at the time, but during her scenes the film felt cartoonish. I'm glad she had a small part. To summarize- it is a worthwhile movie to watch, and if you are a Don Johnson fan- it is a must watch.",1510531200,,817,4.210191082802548
7823675,3,6302270847,I like the movie fun to see again.  It looks dated more than I thought it would.  When I first saw it inspired me look further into the struggle of our revolution.  I am not sure it can inspire fresh eyes. Glad to have the Bastard & The Rebels,1429056000,,243,3.9183673469387754
7823676,5,6302270847,Very good mini series.  Part of the Kent Chronicles.  Don Johnson very good as Philip's friend and womanizing Southerner.  It is really his story.,1414713600,2,146,5.0
7823677,4,6302270847,"I just got this DVD, and after buying it noticed that the run time listed on the box is 180 minutes.  According to IMDB, the original movie was 240 minutes long.  I've just watched most of it and don't think anything is cut out, and it doesn't seem to be time-compressed, so my conclusion is that someone on IMDB goofed and included the original running time of the movie with commercials.

Anyway, a fun trip down memory lane! Don Johnson is adorably rascally as Judson Fletcher, Andrew Stevens is suitably upright as Philip Kent, and Doug McClure is a lot of fun as the homesy frontiersman Eph Tait.  Lots of guest stars, some fake snow, and catastrophic injuries that are depicted by dabbing fake blood on the appropriate limb (this being the 1970s and not HBO and all).  The acting is mostly decent, the friendship angle between Philip, Judson and Eph is nicely played, and there's a great sequence where the German general, Von Steuben, teaches the ragtag soldiers how to load a musket and drill properly, all to the tune of ""Chester"".

The video quality is fine for what it is (an analog film that was made 40 years ago), the sound is good, and as an added bonus there's more William Daniels as John Adams, reprising the character he played so well in ""1776"" - and wearing one of the costumes from that movie, I think!

All in all, highly recommended. :-)",1404259200,2,1361,4.55327868852459
7823678,4,6302270847,"OK, just so people know, Don Johnson, while he is very young and cute and does a good job here, is NOT the star of this movie. The star is Andrew Stevens. Johnson has a supporting role.

Also, just as a side note of interest, William Daniels is in this show, reprising his '1776' role as John Adams. He doesn't sing, though. :)

Loved this when I saw it on TV in 1979.",1404086400,3,368,4.027397260273973
7823679,3,6302270847,I was expecting better acting.  It kind of dragged.  The actors didn't convince me of their cause at all.  Maybe I'll read the book and see if that's any better.,1363564800,,161,4.3
7823680,4,6302270847,"Did I like it?  Of course I did, since I was the designer of the film.  Except for the photography, hair and make up, the film holds up after all these years.  Thanks for carrying it and making it available.",1359504000,3,207,4.125

7823682,5,6302270847,"i love john jakes kent family novels but i have to say the rebels was the least of the books.very little war happens in it and the two main people the novel follows never meet.

  well the mini-series takes care of all of that and is a very good rousing adventure story with a great cast and the best sound track of any of the jakes mini-series. andrew stevens once again plays philip kent and is joined by a young don johnson as judson flecher. the action flows nicely in this one and the cast is great. do yourself a favor and check this one out.",1148256000,2,548,4.150943396226415
7823683,5,6302270847,i read the book first and saw the mini-series when i was first run and i think the movie does the book one better.in the book may things are different such as philip and judson flecher never meet and philip doesn't fight very much in the war. the book is pure soap and the movie is a rousing action filled story. it moves at a quick pace and it keeps you glued to the screen the whole time so give this movie a chance and i think you will be very happy with the time you spend with it.,1139788800,2,485,3.909090909090909
