2471412,3,B000CRR3B0,"It was a largely underwater magic show. The promotional bits, music, and Penn's voice were annoying.
Some traditional illusions, performed underwater.  They did a ""pick a card"" trick with a surprisingly large number of people at the beach.  One of the underwater illusions was timed to Aaron Carter's singing (also annoying, but less so than the commercial break music).  One of the coolest bits had Teller straitjacketed and shut in a box, to be lowered into shark infested waters.  There was even a trick involving trained dolphins.
The big finish was making a real submarine disappear before a large audience of divers.
If you get this DVD, you should probably fast-forward through the promos, as they are really annoying, particularly the music.",1238371200,,749,5.114754098360656
2471413,4,B000CRR3B0,"Great show by the legendary Penn & Teller. They go through various tricks and illusions, exposing afterwards how they did them. The focus of the show is of course the underwater illusions and tricks, but interspersed throughout are tricks done on the beach. The illusions are (as always) amazing and entertaining, with Penn keeping the comedy flowing throughout. Aaron Carter also appears to sing a Penn & Teller song whilst both are doing a trick underwater. The two main events are; making an 80 ton submarine disappear and Teller pulling a disappearing/survival act in a pool of sharks.

This is not an Atlantis infomercial or advertisement. They mention it once or twice, but its in passing comment just revealing where all is taking place.

The only problem I have with this DVD is the editing. Maybe its personal preference but I would have preferred if the lead-ups to the ad breaks were removed. A 30-45 second preview of what is coming up after the break just gets tiring and frustrating straight away; I bought the DVD, of course I'm going to watch it, so please stop showing me clips of footage from the main event tricks to entice me to stay tuned...

Also at the beginning, there is a really long intro into the show, that feels like its going on forever. I know I can fast forward through it, but it seems pointless.

Its merely DVD issues and if my two main gripes are regarding promo issues on the DVD, then obviously I don't have much to complain about; the show itself is immense and hilarious, an hour and a half long, with one or two impressive extras. If you're a Penn & Teller fan, you will love this.",1195603200,2,1623,4.586206896551724
2471414,5,B000CRR3B0,"P&T continue their tradition of doing tricks and revealing how they're done.  The trick where they produced a card in an astonishing manner showed you just how much preparation goes into a trick.  From the very start, where they show you how something went wrong during one of their tricks, to the end, where they vanish a submarine, this is good P&T.

The part I liked best was seeing just how well-trained a dolphin can be.  The only part I didn't like was Aaron Carter singing the Penn & Teller theme song.

(Note: this was *not* an infomercial for the resort.  Yes, they shot some tricks there, but they were also on other islands.)",1150070400,13,636,4.535087719298246
2471415,5,B000CRR3B0,"One reviewer called this an ""infomercial"" for the Atlantis resort.  I've got the DVD and, darn, I can't seem to find the bit where Penn & Teller give package rates and show the size of the rooms...

Seriously (and shots of Atlantis notwithstanding), if you enjoy Penn & Teller you'll certainly enjoy seeing them subversively dressed in business suits in a tropical vacation climate, as they bother and bewilder the resort guests. Sometimes you've just got to go a fancy shmancy place like Atlantis, to do that.",1149379200,11,510,4.850574712643678
2471416,2,B000CRR3B0,"Don't get me wrong; I'm a major fan of Penn and Teller.  I have all of their books, and I think their Showtime production ""Bulls*it"" is great.

But I watched this program when it aired on regular television, and I'm disappointed to report that it's mostly a commercial for the tropical Atlantis resort, pitched by Penn and Teller.  Sure, they perform some impressive tricks, and yes, there are a few funny scenes.  But it was painfully clear that the production was foremost a promotional device for the Atlantis resort.

As an alternative, I highly recommend Penn & Teller's Magic and Mystery Tour.",1144713600,25,599,4.833333333333333

8101169,5,B000CRR3B0,"I am into magic, since I was a semipro magician for about 15 years. As far as I know, Penn and Teller were the only magicians to do a show underwater. If you want to see something new and really a entertainment novelty then you can't miss with this.",1434672000,,249,4.1020408163265305
8101170,4,B000CRR3B0,"Because of the relationship they have with a hotel and Casino in Vegas, P&T spend some of their ""days off"" actually flying to other resorts owned by their parent company.  This Deep End thing is largely a pimp for the family friendly ""Atlantis Resort"" location in the Bahamas. Not a lot of venue mentions, but it's the backdrop of the entire show. Summary: they do tricks under or in water using an audience of very good looking tourists. In the technical sense, this shoot looks like a nightmare. Sand, water, salt, air tanks, masks, daylight, tide. So the magic is deliberately throw-away cheesy county-fair tricks where they openly reveal how it was done. It's not your punk-rock magic show. Zero blood and guts, or language and nary a cockroach to be found. I purchased it to be complete with understanding Penn and Teller's body of work. EXTRAS: #1 a gag with a clear bucket of water from which Teller produces the elements contained in the water: iron, salt, shrimp, Penn plucks out some gold - but the bit has a few off-color mentions which un-Disney-fy it (I would have cut it too). #2 Penn moves the tan line from his watch. #3 Behind the scenes with crew and equipment is the BEST part, but short. The opening tricks-in-a-tank sequence replays but complete. Usefully, a trick is shown with an unknown material that looks like 3"" globs of turkey fat suspended in water. These appear inexplicably in the first version, but are actually part of a trick in the whole version. #4 After that comes an out-of-date biography that no one should bother reading.",1431561600,,1561,4.717948717948718

8101172,3,B000CRR3B0,"There are shows on DVD that I would watch again and again (given a few months in between) but this particular show is not one of them. Unfortunately. Don't get me wrong, Penn and Teller are great fun and the video is ok but, and this is a huge 'but': the TV show format with its endless repetitions, previews of the exciting things to come in the next segment and recaps of what we have just seen is so tiring that it defies words. Are we, the audience on average so idiotic that we forget what we have just seen 5 minutes earlier? Geez. This is not a good format for the usually high intensity, quick moving pace I have come to expect from Penn and Teller.

Ok, so apart from the TV format which is annoying, the DVD is what you would expect from the duo: fun! Penn and Teller are entertaining and the DVD is family friendly, just a minor comment in here that male teenagers will appreciate but that reference will probably be over the heads of anyone younger. A special appearance by Aaron Carter 'singing' underwater unfortunately dates the experience.

So overall: an ok video to watch once, otherwise this is just 'meh'. Being a fan of Penn and Teller, this is somewhat disappointing. Sorry guys.",1357430400,2,1201,4.454545454545454
8101173,5,B000CRR3B0,"Vintage P & T! What more needs to be said? Their genius well produced. As always the reveals show more of the art involved than simply showing how things were done. Sometimes knowing the ""how"" creates more mystery.",1355011200,,214,4.657894736842105
