8321655,1,B001MSJZSM,"I am a huge race fan and can watch or read practically anything about racing.  I had to turn this off after 15 minutes, because it was so poorly produced that I could no longer stand it!  It is basically a compilation of short videos, probably taken from YouTube, and thrown together in a hodgepodge manner. There are probably ten different scenes that are played over, and over, and over again, sometimes completely out of sync with the narrator is detailing.  To top this off, there are numerous mistakes of historical fact and infelicities presented.  For example, Vivian Senna, who moved to the UK with Ayrton when he started karting in Europe is his sister, not his wife and Sir Sterling Moss was never a Formula One champion (although he is champion for many of us).  Don't wast your money.  The authorized ""Senna"" movie is a well produced documentary, but this one is not even worth the postage if you can find it for free.",1367798400,9,930,4.606060606060606
