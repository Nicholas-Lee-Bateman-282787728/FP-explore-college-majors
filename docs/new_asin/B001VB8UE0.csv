8345924,3,B001VB8UE0,"Just like BLOODFEST, these are ""kiddie"" versions of the films.  These have been edited with mosaic over nudity to gain a PG 13 across the board on these movies.

The tin is great and generally worth a small fee alone, but even though these films are 1 movie per disc the quality is NOT better and they have been edited to reach a younger audience.",1404172800,3,347,4.323076923076923
8345925,5,B001VB8UE0,"Like my Frightfest tin movie collection, I picked this up a few years ago.  Yes the 5 Movies are B to Z rate.  The transfers are not the best.  But you know something, You have to love having classic cheese low budget Horror movies.  And that come in this type of tin shaped like a gravestone.  Great for the Horror afficienado!!!",1400544000,,330,4.344262295081967
8345926,5,B001VB8UE0,"are these movies superb. And what a furking bargain. After shipping I think I paid less than $2 a piece per movie. If you are into indie b-movies from the 70s you will not be disappointed. These movies are genuinely unsettling and/or hilarious. You'll love these if you like that old, crusty look. I really enjoyed the flute-heavy soundtracks complete with inappropriate feel in relation to what was happening, typical of this genre/era.

If you're buying this partly because there is a Milligan movie included, don't get your hopes up. It's a different movie of the same name and billed with Milligan instead of the actual director, Carl Monson. This is false advertisement. On the plus side the tin that it came in has hinged doors on both sides. Very handsome packaging - possibly the best value I've ever got with a boxed set.",1339372800,8,830,4.763888888888889
8345927,1,B001VB8UE0,"The tin that houses the 5 videos is unique indeed.  Wish I could say the same about its contents,  The movies are dreadfully slow and boring and the sound is terrible.  Stay away from this horror show.",1339027200,4,201,4.378378378378378
8345928,3,B001VB8UE0,"Since Amazon doeSnt give the movie list i will do it. i bought the item because it seemed nice and not for the movies. Its a nice tin edition at a good price. The movies included, i have never heard of them and must/may be below average.
