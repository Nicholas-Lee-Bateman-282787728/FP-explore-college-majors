2639895,2,B000HOMSQI,"where action is almost not visible:( I watched last year ""Phantom"" by the same director and thought it couldn't be worse. Unfortunately it is.
The beginning is really promising. Two gay lovers are closing their anniversary date with a romantic kiss. Their happiness doesn't last long however. Car accidents happen.
From then on we observe very peculiar serie of events. The worst is that the action slows down dramatically. The shots are loooong and don't make the whole thing more clear.
Even if the acting is good it doesn't change the whole impression. The actors seem to be as much lost as I was at some moments. If I had to point the best one, it would be with no doubt the one who portrayed the graving mother. The scene at the cementary at the grave of her husband is still in my mind.
Well, the ending...My jaw literally dropped. And it's not because it was so amazing. On my list with the most ridiculous film endings the closing scene from ""Two drifters"" sits proudly in top 3!",1340323200,,987,4.550561797752809
2639896,1,B000HOMSQI,"There are few movies I would call ridiculous, but this is certainly one of them.  Long, dull, nothing-happening scenes are punctuated with moments of insane behavior and events with little explanation.  If there is a reasoning to all this, we the viewers are certainly asked to fill in the gaps far too much.  There is little substantiation to this movie and it duly suffers in the credibility department.  You know something is amiss when the product description on the back cover of the DVD makes more sense than the movie does. Now, I openly admit I haven't seen any of director Joo Pedro Rodrigues' other films, and perhaps I am probably not savvy enough to understand them, but if this movie is representative, I am highly inclined not to give them a try.",1301097600,2,760,4.69172932330827
2639897,2,B000HOMSQI,"The story of the girl who dumps the guy for not hunkering down is as old as the sun, but the way in which this girl, Odete (Ana Cristina de Oliveira), fills the void is strange and fresh. She is a supermarket rollergirl (does this job actually exist in Portugal?) who wants more from life, a better career, a wedding, and most importantly a baby. He's not interested so they split. From there Odete shows up at a funeral parlor with nothing but nefarious things on her mind and leaves deeply in love with the dearly departed Pedro. Soon after she begins to experience symptoms of pregnancy; morning sickness, enlarged belly, etc., and she is convinced that Pedro impregnated her from the grave. The pregnancy test says she isn't pregnant at all, but who has time for such small details? The other titular drifter, Rui, is not as much a focus of the film (The original Portuguese title is ""Odete""). He truly was Pedro's lover as we see in the very first scene, before we know anything about these characters we know Rui and Pedro are in love. Those pronouncements of love, however, are followed by the deadly car wreck that sets the rest of the film in motion.

This film was a fairly ugly miss in my book. The plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense (although it doesn't feel like a puzzler) and the characters are horrible people and horribly sick. I'm sure director Joao Pedro Rodrigues was going for a meditation on loss but he actually came up with a nonsensical mind bender with some gay porn thrown in for whoever might be interested. She goes shopping and he goes cruising and I'm sure it is all very therapeutic for these characters but I'm just not sure what I'm supposed to get out of it. There is a lot of Christian symbolism hanging about, from crosses to immaculate conceptions to bloody palms but to what end? I obviously don't want everything spelled out for me, but whatever message was trying to be sent did not arrive here.

This is not to say that all is lost either. The opaque nature of the film is a positive in a lot of ways. If a character makes a face or a gesture it isn't dwelled upon or underlined, even if they aren't sitting in the center of the shot. Music doesn't just arrive to prod your emotions along either. Rodrigues has an eye for catching attention grabbing shots and the patience to hold them for longer than 3 seconds. There is also a strong performance by Oliveira as Odete. Her character is mostly a tragic one, but at times the pathetic nature of her is so overwhelming that the performance slides over into the comic territory. This is a woman, after all, who rejected her very real boyfriend and replaced him with an imaginary baby conceived by a man who she has never met and is now dead. That is her prerogative I suppose, but you will agree that it is a little strange. So while there are ideas here I just wish they would have been made a little louder and a little clearer. **",1179187200,2,2926,4.436802973977695
2639898,2,B000HOMSQI,"After seeing O FANTASMA, the first feature of Joao Pedro Rodrigues, I had high expectations for TWO DRIFTERS.  Unfortunately, it did not deliver.  There were numerous problems, an implausible storyline and frustrating characters chief among them.  It meandered far too much and ultimately ended on a ridiculous note.  I recall reading favorable reviews of this film and was anxious to buy the DVD.  I doubt it will remain in my library - it just wasn't terribly engaging and suggests Joao Pedro Rodrigues took far too formulaic a path in constructing this work both substantively and dramatically.  I also feel the development and rather dark transformations of his two leads seemed to follow the same trajectory as his lead character in O FANTASMA.  It just didn't resonate with me.",1164412800,3,783,5.0703125
2639899,4,B000HOMSQI,"Director Joo Pedro Rodrigues  and writer Paulo Rebelo ('O Fantasma') collaborate again on this fascinating (if a bit frustrating) Portuguese film ODETE ('Two Drifters'). Together they have their own brand of surrealism and exploration of fantasies that seems to be developing into a smart new look for cinema.  The very controversial 'O Fantasma' was dark and brooding, tearing open psyches like feral dogs along the slums of Portugal, whereas 'Two Drifters' is a work in the daylight that moves the concentration from men only to men and women - but the extremes of behavior are still in sharp focus.

The film opens with a very tender moment between handsome student Pedro (Joo Carreira) and his working boyfriend Rui (Nuno Gil): it is their anniversary but their individual obligations prevent them from spending more than a hasty goodbye, exchanging rings, and off goes Pedro in his car only to be killed in a crash.  Devastated, Rui attends to Pedro and then to the horror of sitting by his casket during the wake before the funeral.

Flash into storyline two: the beautiful store skater Odete (Ana Cristina De Oliveira) lives with her lover Alberto (the hunky Carloto Cotta) but when she announces she would like to have a child, Alberto flees and Odete is left in depression over her plight.  She just happens to be a neighbor of the recently dead Pedro and in her loneliness she attends Pedro's wake, follows the casket through the funeral and to the grave where she begins to obsess over the dead Pedro.  She spends her time draped across his grave, fantasizes that she is pregnant by him and confronts Pedro's mother with the concept. She truly has pseudocyesis (false imagined hysterical pregnancy) and when it is an exposed condition she alters her appearance, cutting her hair and wearing Pedro's clothes and even convincing Pedro's mother to let her sleep in his bed. Ultimately Odete, now inhabiting the persona of Pedro, rejects Albert's return to her graces and instead enters into a bizarre arrangement with Rui.

The actors are all physically beautiful people, superbly cast to fit the models of the personalities of the story, and they manage to make this rather incredible tale credible.  The film is rich in symbolism and metaphors, among them the title of the English version 'Two Drifters' - a phrase taken form the favorite fantasy song 'Moon River' that is the theme of Pedro's and Rui's relationship.  There are some distorted sexual scenes and innuendoes that may be off-putting to some, but the inclusion works for the story.  It is a tough little film but dazzling in its brave little way of taking chances, making us eager to see what Joo Pedro Rodrigues will do next!

2639900,2,B000HOMSQI,"Yet another gay-themed flick from the talented Portuguese director Joo Pedro Rodrigues. But whereas his previous effort (O FANTASMA, 2000) was dark, sexy (even pornographic, according to some), and creepily atmospheric, TWO DRIFTERS is bland, lacking in thematic coherence, and ultimately disappointing.

Because Rodrigues deals so much with dreams and sexual/psychotic fantasies in his work, one could potentially argue that the looseness of this particular film's narrative reflects its hidden themes and metaphors. But those themes and metaphors were already explored by Rodrigues in O FANTASMA, and better, so why bother with them again?

Without revealing too much of the plot, it should suffice to say that in TWO DRIFTERS, we see/follow the same basic premise as in O FANTASMA: a desperate human being (this time a woman) falls in love with a distant young man (this time he's distant because he's dead, not because he's unresponsive) and begins to exhibit the entire gamut of signs that any normal person out there will have no trouble diagnosing as sexual hysteria/obsession. She sleeps on top of the young man's grave, thinks she's pregnant with his baby, stalks his boyfriend (a guy with enough problems of his own), and, by the end, is almost entirely consumed by the dead young man's personality (she gets a haircut just like his; she starts wearing his old clothes; she fools his mother into letting her sleep in his bed, etc., etc., you get the idea).

Cinematically speaking, there is nothing breath-taking about this movie. Most scenes are long and repetitive; there is almost no nudity (which in the earlier film was a definite plus!); the acting is solid but not outstanding; the ending is annoyingly obscure (does she grow a male reproductive organ or something???); the juxtaposition of scenes is totally chaotic; the characters' behavior is totally unexplainable (one moment, they're getting laid, the other- they're slitting their wrists); the themes and metaphors (if there are any) are totally invisible (at least to this viewer), etc., etc.

If you want to satisfy your curiosity, rent it, but don't buy it: your money would be better spent on O FANTASMA.",1161129600,15,2181,5.1525423728813555
8140718,4,B000HOMSQI,"The original title of this movie is Odete, the name of the lead female role. The ""two drifters"" is a reference to the importance of the song Moon River plays for the gay lovers that Odete's story interacts with.  But, this attempt to attract English speakers to the work deflects the writer/director's intention of focusing on Odete's journey into psychosis (or is it spiritual illumination -- with Rodriques one is never sure).  In our world, she would be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder as well hysterical pregnancy.  Still, both she and Rui (the surviving gay lover) are two  drifters, but like the version of Moon River used at the beginning of the movie, the world they are off to see is dark and dangerous and their journeys don't end well for either.  We watched this and The Ornithologist back to back and Rodriques' quirks and obsessions began to take hold and make emotional, if not rational, sense.  Worth watching with awareness that they are not easy pieces.",1509321600,,986,4.874251497005988

8140721,5,B000HOMSQI,Excellent  touching heart breaking movie. Seems to be slow but it goes at a good peace after all. Watch it,1390867200,,106,4.3
8140722,1,B000HOMSQI,"What a disappointment!  The director has done some interesting work that inclined me to overlook the negative reviews here which often come from viewers impatient with the odd conventions of non-U.S, cinema.  This time I have to agree with everybody who thought it was simply too weird to bother with, if not just plain silly.  The female leads's obsessions are sick, but not in any way that is remotely interesting, nor is the actress strong enough to pull off an extra-bizarre role.  Much is laughable, but in that pathetic way nobody needs to watch, ever.  And yeah, I did fast forward through the latter two thirds.",1385251200,,619,4.80188679245283
8140723,1,B000HOMSQI,"I thought this was the worst movie that I've seen in a very long time, solely based on the premise.

I hate it.

I actually f*king hate this movie.

So sad, because the director had so much promise, and his other movie, O Fantasma, was excellent and had a point!",1381968000,,262,4.2
8140724,3,B000HOMSQI,"This movie could have been more meaningful had the character of Pedro been better defined.  Was he bi-sexual, and, therefore, dishonest with Rui by having an affair with Odette?  The synopsis seems to indicate that she had a boyfriend (not Pedro) but it is not mentioned in the film (I could have missed this point), so was her boyfriend, Pedro? But the ambiguity sets in when it shows Pedro completely in love with Rui--so was Pedro playing both of them?  Also, I am gay, and showing Odette using a dildo on Rui, suggests that Rui was a 'bottom' in their relationship (Pedro) and, of course, Pedro 'top.'  By far Rui comes off as a 'top' and more masculine than Pedro, so it was a stretch, for me, to accept Rui was a'bottom!' The acting was ttop notch and look forward to seeing the actor that plays, Rui, in future film.",1376870400,,823,4.466666666666667
8140725,4,B000HOMSQI,"Although there is a mild gay theme element to the story, this is not another gay movie. It is a story about a woman who is suffering from psychosis as she is later diagnosed in the movie. The viewer has a clue through out the movie from the very beginning when she asked to touch a pregnant woman's belly. When Odete doesn't get what she wants, that does not stop her from trying to make a family adopt her against all reason. You have to understand that this character is beyond bi-polar. The acting was very good and convincing through out the movie. There are 2 weak parts, one near the beginning where Rui is crying over his deceased lover, and the ending where the end of the story becomes unclear. A different ending would have made this a great movie.

If you think this is a gay themed movie about 2 guys falling in love...then you missed it and gave it a poor rating. If you know someone in your life in the past or present that was a crazy azz female, this will make sense. The story line is really following Odete ""psychotic woman with a disorder"" throughout the movie & the gay themed is secondary but not the central focus of the story.

I found myself laughing and appreciating the movie and the acting up until the ending. There is a part in the movie where Odete is calling out to the deceased gay lover and the storm and wind in the background implies a visitation of the deceased upon Odete. If that is the case, it clarifies why the deceased may have appeared at the ending of the movie as an apparition. I would watch this movie again and can't understand why people would rate Harvest (gay-themed movie) with poor acting and no plot... a much higher rating than this film. This film has plot and character growth and is worthy of better reviews than I have seen here today. It's just not centrally focused on a gay theme, the gay part is a secondary element of the story.",1373328000,,1892,4.356940509915014
8140726,4,B000HOMSQI,"The performances and the direction are all excellent in this film. Definitely for those fond of films with foreign sensibilities, this film's storyline may not seem plausible or resonate well with a wider audience. To summarize the plot would be to perform an injustice to how well this film presents the intersection of three people, damaged by the same event. The characters tread paths that many of us can't conceive as being possible, and these are dark paths. But if you can suspend your disbelief, there is a great deal to be appreciated in this film, it is artful and wrenching, and there will be moments where you will want to intercede in the lives of these characters.",1371168000,,678,4.754237288135593
