6815696,5,B00PKPGMKC,I love it.  There are many serious parts to each episodes and all episodes have a lot of comedy.  Some of the comedy you have to be paying attention to the show or you will miss it.  It's another CSI show with a twist.,1429574400,3,218,3.909090909090909

6815698,5,B00PKPGMKC,"One of my all-time favorite Cop shows.
WOW--48 episodes--do the math. NEW TRICKS COLLECTION 6-10 is loaded.
A fun sophisticated crime series balanced with fast wit from senior crime fighters.
This second 5-year set is PERFECT for those who have yet to purchase any of the annual series. Previously released by seasons, so be careful of repeat buying.

Writing as strong as ever. Since 2003, this fast-pace old-guy investigation team is led by buxom blonde DS Pullman (Amanda Redman- `Little Dorrit'). They are handed cases from the past, unsolvable, but now new evidence suggests this UCOS, Unsolved Crimes & Open Case Squad can get the job done right. Not without few mess-ups along the way, plus plenty of humor mingled with suspense. The episodes get filled with guest stars. No end in sight for this great BBC small screen hit. Seasons continue.

One-liners and humorous expressions roll faster than finding clues in this fast-paced but retirement age police team. This team's personalities & relationships make this award-winning fun. Pullman tough, realistically slightly overweight, but yet sexy. Brian (Alun Armstrong-Garrow's Law: Series One) is an old alcoholic, tech nerd with a photographic memory. Jack (James Bolam-The Beiderbecke Tapes) a widower of a murdered spouse, & Gerry (Dennis Waterman-`Sweeney') aging playboy. DAC Strickland (Anthony Calf-`Upstairs Downstairs') is their often antagonistic boss. And we must mention Brian's wife Esther (Susan Jameson-`The Queen'). Retired copper Danny Griffin (Nicholas Lyndhurst) is as memory sharp as was Brian, and Dan has a handicapped daughter (computer geek) who fills Esther's role of case help from home. DCI Sasha Miller (Tamzin Outhwaite) blonde, bright, feisty, and like all UCOS, comes with personal baggage offering subplot material. Episodes always have a difficult past crime, plus personal issues of the UCOS team. You will laugh through the sleuthing efforts.

Yes, you get SDH SUBTITLES for episodes.",1420070400,9,2176,5.901587301587302
6815699,5,B00PKPGMKC,"Fantastic & funny show. Something I can watch over & over again. The mix of Redman, Armstrong, Bolam, & waterman was inspired and I wish they had all felt able to continue making this outstanding show indefinately.",1420070400,4,214,4.8108108108108105

6815704,5,B00PKPGMKC,"I just finished watching Seasons 6-10 and I still enjoyed the show. Somewhere around the end of Season 7 and well into Season 8 the show gets ""darker"" and the earlier humor & wit seam to be scarce. At the end of Season 8, Jack (James Bolam) leaves the show and while sad, these things happen. The new guy is hard to get used to at first but soon blends in.

Season 9, Episode 5 ""Body of Evidence"" is particularly interesting in that it showed that Russian coding in the Cyrillic language was used by a British hacker (hackers borrow heavily from others and don't bother rewriting the code in their native language). The last episode of Season 9 ""Glasgow UCOS"" and the first two episodes of Season 10 ""The Rock"" could easily have been pilots for a spin-off series. After Season 8, the humor and quick wit resurfaced a little, but was replaced with more intrigue. The music accenting the intrigue picked up as well. We saw this in the Rock in which I first thought ""shades of James Bond"" and in the 2nd episode of the Rock the Spanish farmers thought the same thing.

In Season 10 we saw one of the things bothering Brian the most resurface and though he was vindicated the manner in which he did so caused a lot of embarrassment to UCOS and the entire Police Department. We saw Brian leave but it looks like he & Esther will never be done with solving puzzles. And then there were just Gerry & Sandra but near the end of Season 10 we saw Sandra leave as well. So far the series did a nice job of writing off the characters and although New Tricks has changed its still a fun show to watch. It was also interesting to see how the new DCI, Sasha Miller use her skills to find her husband cheating in the sack.

I look forward to watching Season 11 & 12.",1497052800,,1750,4.280966767371601

6815709,5,B00PKPGMKC,"Yet another British Murder Mystery series - but with some important twists.  First, the murders generally do not focus on grisly graphics; so for your chainsaw/axe swinging crowd, there is not going to be much of a thrill here.  Second, the detectives (minus Sandra) are all older and retired.  If you want a cast of cookie-cutter hunks and babes, look elsewhere.  What you lose in eye candy however, you gain in wisdom, insight, hard work and highly individualized cast members - each fascinating in their own ways and each ""damaged"" in some manner which is part of the wellspring of their
""attractiveness"", screen presence and effectiveness in crime solving.  Third, like ""Foyle's War"" (which is a close analog to ""New Tricks"") or ""Langley Mysteries"", the emphasis is brains over brawn and  clever evidentiary entrapment versus violent shootouts or barroom brawls.  If it is possible to script a ""non-violent"" murder mystery series, this is about as close as it comes.  Like so many British mystery series, which thrive on introducing a dozen ""red herring"" characters to throw off the scent, some of the plot lines are pretty convoluted, but generally become clear by the end. Some very touching scenes emotionally and occasional surprise endings.  Excellent acting throughout. Nicely, realistically paced - devoid of clever, if, distracting, graphic trickery. The series is excellent from Season 1, but really hits its stride from Seasons 5 through 10.  I haven't seen Seasons beyond that.",1489795200,,1492,5.179166666666666

6815712,5,B00PKPGMKC,"Great Series. I purchased this series for my husband as a Christmas present. He found the series on cable and he watched a few before telling me about it. By then he was hooked! A policewoman was chosen to head a group of retired male officers to clean up cold cases. The only thing I found tiresome, but doesn't change our love for this series is, as with many cop shows, there's the supervisor the have to answer to always negative and critical of the group despite the fact that they always solve the cold case given to them. Each of the officers have their own side stories so you get to know them in their personal life. The comedy is fresh and the actors play off each other beautifully. I HIGHLY recommend this show.",1484697600,3,723,4.362962962962963

This is an engaging, clever, well-acted, and often humorous detective series.  Three older male detectives, brought out of retirement to work with the female Detective Superintendent in a special cold case unit, are a totally new twist in a genre with few new twists.

6815743,5,B00PKPGMKC,"Series Premise:
In 2003, The Metropolitan Police decide to create an ""Unsolved Crimes and Open Cases Squad"" (UCOS), tasked with re-opening unsolved cases from the past.
Problem: There is not enough money in the budget to fully staff the new unit
Solution: Three old-age pensioners are brought out of retirement.
Though retired policemen, they are technically civilian contractors, which saves the Department a lot of money.
Also, as civilians they feel free to flexibly interpret the rules (search warrant?)

Glamorous Detective Superintendent Sandra Pullman is put in charge of UCOS.
A three person team does not need it's own Superintendent, but Superintendent Pullman is on the outs with her superiors.
This experiment could be a plan to ease her out of the department

Technically the acronym for ""Unsolved Crimes and Open Cases Squad"" is not UCOS (pronounced ""You-Cose"").
It's UCOCS (pronounced ""You-Cocks""), but its pretty clear why that could be a problem.

107 hour-long episodes spread over twelve years.
""New Tricks"" is a wonderful show, but it's hard to maintain consistent quality for such a long stretch.
There was a total cast change between the first and the final (12th) seasons, but it was a gradual process.
The original cast held together for eight seasons.
Followed by four additional permutations.
None of the replacements really lived up to their predecessors' achievement.
This is a tribute to the remarkable quality of the original cast, not a knock against the replacements.
The loss of retired Inspector Brian Lane midway through Season Ten was especially devastating.
I won't say it began with a bang, and ended with a whimper.
More like a smaller bang.

The show was always stronger on character development than plotting.
Too many cases are solved by a witness suddenly remembering an important piece of information he forgot to mention twenty years earlier.
A lot of suspension of disbelief is required, but it's worth the effort.

If you buy the Season 1-5 and  Season 6-10 boxes, you will get all the episodes featuring Teams 1-3, plus the first two episodes of Team 4.
All episodes have English SDH subtitles.

There is some hope for the future.
""Foyle's War"" and ""New Tricks"" both ended long runs in 2015.
In Great Britain, this was a signal to Acorn Media to bring out two absolutely complete new mega-boxes at substantial savings.
The ""Foyle's War"" mega-box appeared in the UK in August, and in the US in October, 2015.
The ""New Tricks"" mega-box appeared in the UK in October 2015.
If the pattern holds, we should expect the ""New Tricks"" mega-box over here sometime in 2016.
Savings should be substantial (at least after the first few months).
