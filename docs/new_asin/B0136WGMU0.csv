8727003,5,B0136WGMU0,Without a Clue is just excellent.  Lots of knighted actors in all three.  I love seeing Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in anything together - they were friends from their time in Hammer films until Cushing died.  Lots of movie history in all these.  I highly recommend.,1494547200,2,272,4.723404255319149
