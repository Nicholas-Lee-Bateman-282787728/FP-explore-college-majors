8172317,4,B000MTEXRU,"Raveena Tandon is excellent as the beautiful former lover of Jackie
Shroff's now married character.  She is riveting as she expresses
her never-ending obsession and passion for this man.  This is not the
best Bollywood film I have seen, but it had its strengths, and Tandon
was great as a character you won't forget.
When she finally meets her lover's wife, the scenes between the two women
are very good. It was more complex than I'd expected.
While the film is weak in some parts, I thought the ending was strong--
and some of the images haunted me for days.",1236124800,,560,4.59
