3140025,5,B00153CLNA,"I first viewed this ""spagetti"" western back in 1970 when I was just a nine year old kid in the back seat of the crowded family car on a Saturday night double-feature running at my hometown's drive-in theater. The images of this movie were so powerful to me back then (almost 30 years ago) that I never forgot them, nor the name of this excellent film, originally titled, ""Go Kill Everybody, and Come back Alone"". It's never been available on DVD in English to the USA until just now, and I was incredibly anxious to see it again, though I am now older than Chuck Conners was when he made the film. I was not disappointed. The story is a well-conceived revenge tale set in Texas during the Civil War (filmed in Spain). Chuck Conners (star of the hit, ""Rifleman"" TV series) is a hired mastermind for a shady Confederate captain (Frank Wolff) who wants him to break into an impregnable Union fort to steal $1,000,000 in gold (tactfully mixed in rolls of dynamite). Conners pulls together a tight-knit squad of killers, each with his own deadly speciality, to pull off the job. Once the gold is in hand, suspicions within the group begin, leading to bloody betrayal. The fight for the gold continues through a series of events (rafting it over a river, a brutal stop at a Union labor camp, a series of intelligently-written double-crossings, etc.) which all leads up to a climactic, surprise ending. This is the film's first US release, and on DVD, it's a slightly better than average print, which improves in quality ten minutes after the film begins. There are a surprising number of extra goodies included which I found informative and enjoyable. The sound quality is excellent, and the soundtrack by DeMasi (""Lone Wolf McQuade"") features a memorable score throughout. The amazing (and obviously, very dangerous) stunt work is truly spectacular and far more original than any I've ever seen - even in modern movies of today with all the computerized special effects. Of all Enzo G. Catellari's films, critics consider this one his best, and I have to agree. Chuck Conners, an American Western star already, adds a real touch of charisma and panache to this film, which is much better than the average films of its genre at the time. The price tag for this DVD, which is packaged in a better-than-average case, and includes all the original theatrically realeased posters in color, is definitely worth it. If you want to add a few of the best Westerns produced during the 60's and early 70's to your collection, or give it as a gift to someone you know who loves action films, then this one is a real winner. You won't be disappointed.",1207008000,21,2633,4.701298701298701
3140026,5,B00153CLNA,"Of the 450-500 spaghetti westerns made there are a handful that are must owns (of what has been released on Region 1 or 0 DVD). Django, The Great Silence, Keoma, A Bullet for a General, Mannaja, Sabata, Companeroes and anything by Leone are just a few. Kill them All and Come Back is another spaghetti that is a must own.

Here we have Chuck Conners (popular from his American westerns) has a group of ruthless killers and he is given a do-or-die mission by Frank Wolff (The Great Silence) to get a fortune of gold. His one one order was to ""Kill Them All and Come Back Alone"" but when it comes down to it can he kill off his motley crew?

Great anti-heroes, grand stunts, and extremely visual directing by Enzo G. Castellari (Keoma, The Big Racket, Street Law). If you have an interest in spaghetti westerns then you will eat this film up.

The DVD by Wild East Entertainment is also tops with a beautiful animorphic widescreen transfer with an interview and trailers.",1206316800,11,969,4.525714285714286
3140027,4,B00153CLNA,"Prolific Italian director Enzo G. Castellari (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Keoma/dp/B000LPQ6DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Keoma</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inglorious-Bastards/dp/B00140PKEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inglorious Bastards</a>) helms this earlier effort starring The Rifleman himself, Chuck Connors, a morally ambivalent leader of a gang of specialists tasked with stealing a fortune in Union gold.  Hired for this mission by popular Eurofilm actor Frank Wolff - who proves not ambivalent at all, but out and out corrupt - Connors, his men, and Wolff play a game of cat and mouse with the gold while at the same time threading their way through Union and Confederate forces.

This is the fifth film of Castellari's that I've watched; and while I think they share the typical highlights and flaws of their contemporaries, they also seem to lack a certain spark that separate the classics from the mediocre.  It isn't a technical problem - as a craftsman, I think Castellari was one of the better directors to come out of this time and place; but still his films seem flat to me.  The same holds true for 'Kill Them All, and Come Back Alone', despite that most excellent title.  I'll also admit to high expectations, which may have also influenced my opinion - I really expected Connors to bring an extra oomph to the roll.  According with an interview with co-star Ken Wood (Giovanni Cianfriglia), Connors was ill during filming, but I don't think that took anything away from his performance.  The problem was that I was expecting something against type, a la Henry Fonda's turn in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Time-in-the-West/dp/B003DT194G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Time in the West</a>.  Connors certainly isn't the Rifleman here, but it isn't enough of a departure to make the role a standout.

This and any other flaws in the film are going to be mostly a matter of taste.  With a fun score by Francesco DeMasi and an enjoyably competent english dubbing, this is a solid entry in the Italian Western genre, entertaining but not a classic.  Three and a half stars - rounded up to compensate for my expectations.

According to the back matter of the DVD case, the film is presented in anamorphic 16 x 9 widescreen - I get confused between terms, but on my widescreen television, the movie is letterboxed.  As far as the look of the film, I was very pleased, as I have been with all Wild East productions I've seen.  That doesn't mean there aren't flaws in the film; at certain points there are the typical scratches, stray hairs, cigarette burns and other artifacts - but it's a clean and clear print that is also obviously NOT remastered. Audio is limited to English in 2 channel dolby, and extras include an interesting U.S. Trailer, a picture gallery that mostly highlights the international advertisements for the film, and an interview with stuntman turned actor Ken Wood (Cianfriglia).  This conversation is pretty enlightening for Italian film enthusiasts - Cianfriglia got his start as a stunt double for Steve Reeves and had a prolific career which is still going.  As a stuntman/actor, he worked with nearly all of the big names during this period, and describes his experiences.  Unfortunately, there is no commentary for the film itself, but it is still a very attractive package.",1324425600,2,3467,5.450467289719626
3140028,5,B00153CLNA,"Director Enzo G. Castellari is finally becoming a full blown cult icon with Quentan Tarantinos' semi remake of his'INGLORIOUS BASTARDS' and his numerous action films but I think his true niche was the spaghetti western of which 'KILL THEM ALL' is one of his best.  It's an excellent epic of the true double cross in which Chuck Connors, in order to resist a life sentence in a union prison, agrees to abet with the commandant and the prison guard (an excellent performance by Frank Wolff) the robbery of the army's gold reserve. After the successful heist, the two union guys double cross Chuck, shoot him and bury him but Chuck recovers and has other plans.  Some excellent set pieces ensue including a shoot out ambush at an abandoned mine all topped with an excellent music score by Francesco De Masi.  Castellari layers his action sequences beautifully allowing Chuck and Frank Wolff to literally chew up the desert scenery and spit it out at each other.  Sometimes the film goes into 'DIRTY DOZEN' territory but in a way, it may also be a slight hommage to it.

Just a great western adventure worth checking out, finally available after all these years! Chuck Connors leads a motley crew of ""specialists"" in search of wartime booty of gold. Kind of a western Dirty half dozen. Great characters,particularly Bogard-the muscle of the gang and the guy with the bazooka. Genial! Other than the not very original title,this one's a keeper.

3140034,3,B00153CLNA,"A fun spaghetti western with lots of action and scenery. Clyde Mccay (Connors) is hired by confederates to steal bluebelly gold using his ruthless gang and they do so while smiling or laughing through the entire movie. I was waiting too long for this one, not available on tape, dvd, or even on tv for years and finally being a Chuck Connors fan it was great to see him in one of the few westerns outside of television he made. No clever ""Leone"" dialog here for Chuck to chew on so we get to see him ride, fight, and shoot like an extended episode of ""Branded"". The director does not use Connors' charisma to make this a bigger film but his presence is definitely felt. An interviewed stuntman says Chuck was ill and he looks it. The dvd picture is not bad for wild east but the english audio is really rough and not good through a sound system. I would say the movie as far as Chuck's other westerns go is not as good as ""Ride beyond vengeance"" but light years ahead of ""The proud and damned"". This should have been a serious western because I think Chuck Connors was wasted in this, only capitalizing on him being a big tough guy instead of using his acting range and presence.",1211068800,,1179,4.339366515837104
3140035,4,B00153CLNA,"Like another reviewer I saw this movie at the drive in around 40 years ago and never forgot it.  Although I remembered only bits and pieces I was very excited to see it become available on dvd so I ordered a copy, watched it and now see why I couldn't forget it.  It reminds me of a kung fu/Grindhouse combo (that's a good thing).

And let's not overlook Chuck Connors.  He had some of the cheesiest grins and closeups in the history of cinema.  Several times he looked like he was about to bust a gut laughing, like he couldn't believe he was getting paid for this.  It looked like he was having a great time making the movie and why not?  If you can win every fight, never be hit by bullets and end up with the gold, what's not to smile about, even though - believe it or not - there was a scene where I saw him actually reload his revolver.  How that got past the editing phase and left in the movie I'll never know.  It actually gave it a moment of realism.  He should have had one of those guns that never need reloading.  I'm not sure where you get that kind of gun but I've seen them in countless movies.

I know that some people that see this movie will think it's terrible, yet the terribleness is endearing, like Plan 9 terrible if you know what I mean.  It's classic, timeless, priceless - well not priceless ($19.95) but it's a movie you really must see, and afterwards you will ask yourself ""Why was there never a sequel?""  Then you will remember the title and the answer will become apparent.

However, with today's technology if you could combine this movie with the William Bendix ""Kill the Umpire"" and have ""Kill the Umpire and Come Back Alone"" then you might really have something.

PS.  The guy with the antique bazooka was great.",1208995200,,1749,4.315950920245399
3140036,2,B00153CLNA,"I got this because I like Chuck Conners in the very classic The Rifleman but this is not a good movie! There is so much acrobotic work in this film it is annoying and really reminds me of one of those old kung fu movies where everyone is flying through the air. In fact the overall feel of the movie is very much like a bad kung fu movie with so much puching and gigantic leaps through the air that would definitely put anyone in the hospital for a long time unless you are landing on a gymnastic mat or something meant to break someones fall. It becomes almost ridiculous that they keep jumping and leaping off of buildings. Another thing that bothers me is dozens of solders at close range will be shooting at them in the open for minutes and the soldiers never hit anything.
It would have been better with more focus on just Chuck Conners. Chuck is always good but it's not enough to save this film. Additionally this is somewhat of an imitation of The Good the Bad and The Ugly with the gold hunt and double cross element. You may want to pick this up if you really want everything Chuck Conners has ever done though.",1208736000,,1121,4.2924528301886795

There is so much acrobotic work in this film it is annoying and really reminds me of one of those old kung fu movies where everyone is flying through the air. In fact the overall feel of the movie is very much like a bad kung fu movie with so much puching and gigantic leaps through the air that would definitely put anyone in the hospital for a long time unless you are landing on a gymnastic mat or something meant to break someones fall. It becomes almost ridiculous that they keep jumping and leaping off of buildings. Another thing that bothers me is dozens of solders at close range will be shooting at them in the open for minutes and the soldiers never hit anything.
It would have been better with more focus on just Chuck Conners. Chuck is always good but it's not enough to save this film. Additionally this is somewhat of an imitation of The Good the Bad and The Ugly with the gold hunt and double cross element. You may want to pick this up if you really want everything Chuck Conners has ever done though.",1208736000,,1121,4.2924528301886795

8257245,2,B00153CLNA,"The majority of Amazon reviewers have found KILL THEM All AND COME BACK ALONE (1968) to be an enjoyable film and some have gone as far as to enthusiastically label it their favorite ""Spaghetti- Western.""  But, as one wise Amazon reviewer of the film noted here, appreciation of a film like ""KILL THEM ALL..."" is simply a matter of taste.  I concur. I am here to give readers a different opinion of the film.  KILL THEM ALL..."" is a slapstick Western about an outlaw (a broad-smiled, leather-skinned, Chuck Connors), and his band of renegades each with their own specific talents (i.e., one a dynamite expert, another prefers knives, etc.) who are hired by the Union army to steal $1 Million in gold from the Yankee Army.  Sadly, as a huge fan of Euro-Westerns with reasonable expectations, I was severely disappointed and found the film to present insipid characterization, boring plot points and cheesy cartoon-like action.

Probably the most notably creative thing about this Enzo G. Castellari directed film, is the extended (a whopping 14 minutes) pre-title sequence.  However, the sequence itself is completely unbelievable. Allow me to elaborate.  In the extended prologue we see a Union army headquarters being destroyed and infiltrated by Connors and his special 6-man outlaw crew in order to get to a high-ranking Confederate General.  There's a lot of explosions, acrobatics, fist pounding and head ""boinking"" involved in this jokey ""DIRTY DOZEN""(1967) influenced film.  The only thing missing in this extend prologue is the classic 3-Stooges two-finger eye jab.  Many Union Army soldiers appear to be killed or injured and a fire is set to the headquarters.  But no big deal, as it turns out all the violence and destruction inflicted on the poor unsuspecting soldiers was part of an exercise to demonstrate the outlaw commando's unique abilities to the Confederate General. WTF?  At this point, one realizes that a great deal of suspension of disbelief is going to be required to go along with the film.

Anyways, once HQ is infiltrated, Connors introduces each of his men's special skills as they demonstrate by continuing to assault the General's soldiers. For example, the circus-like strong man (Sergio Citti) lifts a soldier over his head and sluggishly throws him, while other soldiers try to seize the brute in vain, ""This is Bogard,"" Connor's explains, ""strong enough to squeeze a man to death with one hand!""  Eventually, the General, seemingly impressed with the group, reveals his steal-the-gold mission to Connors.  Oh, and get this, the gold is disguised in coin rolls that look like dynamite.  Before Connor's leaves, the contemptible and double-crossing Capt. Lynch (played by Frank Wolff who steals the spotlight in the film) augments the General's orders by concluding, for his ears only, ""Kill them all and come back alone."" Then, the opening credits are finally shown. The extend prologue sets the tone for the film which is more of the same and it's safe to say if you found the 14-minute intro amusing you'll probably be able to appreciate the rest of this light-hearted, goofy caper, with its explosive action, double-crossing schemes, and cartoon-like humor.  However, if you weren't fond of the extended pre-title opening you probably won't like the rest of the film.  I fall in the latter category.  I found that despite some of the top notch stunts, staged brawling, and set explosions, the situations and characters (including the usually charismatic, Chuck Connors) were just too silly to really make me want to care about them and what happens next in the story. As I watching it for the first time on DVD, by time chapter five rolled around I'd lost complete interest in the film and began wondering if jeans were still on sale at the local Target store.

As stated earlier, I adore the Euro-Western and own an extensive collection of DVDs and Blu-ray in the genre, but in general, I have a difficult time appreciating the multi-ensemble pieces that copied American Westerns like ""THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN"" (1960) or THE WILD BUNCH""(1969). I think the Spaghetti-Western succeeds best when it deals with hard-edged, lone gunfighter/bounty hunter revenge themed storylines or those of a cynical or darker nature i.e., THE BOUNTY KILLER (1966), ""IF YOU MEET SARTANA, PRAY FOR YOUR DEATH"" (1968), ""NO ROOM TO DIE"" (1969), etc. Even some comedies within the genre can be really enjoyable, and fun such as ""SEVEN GUNS FOR THE MCGREGORS,"" (1966) or later classics such as ""THEY CALLL ME TRINITY"" and ""TRINITY IS STILL MY NAME""(1973). Unfortunately, ""KILL THEM ALL AND COME BACK ALONE"" does not compare. If I want to see silly slapstick, I'll refer to the popular experts, Moe, Larry & Curly or better yet, A Warner Bros. cartoon with Bugs Bunny, Roadrunner, Taz, or Porky Pig. ""Th-Th-Th-That's All, Folks!""

ABOUT THE WILDEAST TRANSFER:
Presented in the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio (16x9 enhanced), the Wildeast print used for this collection isn't pristine but is reasonably watchable. Scratches, nicks, and occasional missing frames are noticeable but don't detract from the film. Special features include a picture gallery, theatrical trailer, and a decent interview with actor, Ken Wood. I believe Wildeast treated the film better than it deserves and I cannot recommend ""KILL THEM ALL & COME BACK ALONE."" Overall, I rate this release 2 out of 5 bullets.",1390003200,,5391,5.07579185520362
8257246,4,B00153CLNA,"Great fun movie,and the picture quality is pretty good and gets better as the film goes along. Wildeast do a good job cleaning up the picture compared to some of the horrible copies of this film out there. I will continue buying from wildeast, i have 2 other films i bought from them for my husband and he was very pleased",1362096000,,322,4.295081967213115
8257247,4,B00153CLNA,"Kill them all and come back alone has the distinction of being one of my favorite spaghetti westerns. Besides the fact it's directed by Enzo Castellari (who has a very good resume in his pocket)it also has some fine work from actors Chuck Conners and Frank Wolfe. The fun factor in this film is high and the action is fast and furious, and even when there are lapses in logic, the movie continues to deliver the goods.
Wild East's release is a damn fine piece of work. The picture is nice and clear and the audio is good. They continue to be THE leading place to get these kinds of films and I thank them for their hard work and hope they keep bringing more gems like this to the masses.",1344038400,,687,4.251908396946565
