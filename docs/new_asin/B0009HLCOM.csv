8061141,1,B0009HLCOM,"I loved this show as a child, but you have got to be a real fan of the old Kit Carson series to waste your money on this poor quality collection. I see this label has many other volumes of this series...10 or 11 or so. I'll wait to order more Kit Carson till some company puts out the series with at least an attempt at quality. The prints are dark and muddy and it seems no attempt was made to work them over digitally. Sound is acceptable, but there seems to be no attempt to improve it either. In these early days of DVD companies releasing old public domain TV series of the 1950s and 1960s, I suppose we can expect to get taken till there is a shakeout and the cream of the companies take the top places and companies like this are gone, but in the meantime, I will always check and if I see the company is Alpha Video, I will not waste my money. It's a flashy box, but there sure is not much inside. The four shows on this DVD are:

1. Wild Horses of Pala

2. Bandit's Blade

3. Snake River Trappers

4. Ghost Town",1170028800,2,1020,4.034653465346534
