2780768,5,B00004TL89,"I think that this is One of History's Best Movies. Raj Kapoor shows a Man who has a Face of a Clown with a Heart which has been Touched by God. It is well written and ,well, The Writer,Director and Producer Is Raj Kapoor who Is ""The Charlie Chaplin"" of India. A Genius of his time and ours.",1075075200,4,290,4.017241379310345

8181224,5,B00004TL89,"Finally the actual 4 hour version in pristine quality. Good job with the transfer bu the distributor,Shemaroo. The initial kissing scene between Ryabinkina and Raj Kapoor has chopped butbthe later one at the airport is intact. Not sure why but that is a small issue. Padmini's dance sequence are to awed at as well. The dance dramas are so opulent. Definitely a jem that is being appreciated time and again.",1492992000,,407,4.828571428571428

8181226,1,B00004TL89,The movie is really old and it is a sad movie but that is not what I dislike most. What I dislike most is the portrayal of a woman's breast and not only as a short thing and then moving on but for a prolonged time as a dramatic element.,1394323200,,236,3.74
8181227,5,B00004TL89,"Great music. Good story, well acted and did not go overboard on the dramatics at the end. Refreshing for a Bollywood movie.",1363564800,,123,4.636363636363637
8181228,5,B00004TL89,"This product was delivered very quickly by the seller. This is a movie that I had wanted to see for a long, long time and I was very glad to find it at Amazon. The movie is excellent. The story was very moving and I felt that the actors were superb. This is an old classic and I highly recommend it.",1311379200,,299,3.918032786885246
8181229,5,B00004TL89,"I really dislike Bollywood films.  So when one comes around that I love, I rave about it.  This is Raj Kapoor's masterpiece.  It took him 6 years to make it, and it is a heartwarming, beguiling film.  Great songs, great performances, and a real sense of beauty make this film a classic Bollywood film.  There are so few films made about clowns and the circus, so when one comes around that is this good, you want to grab a hold of it.  I saw this at a Raj Kapoor retrospective in Chicago.  It only showed once, but I was lucky enough to make it.  I'm glad I did.  It's my favorite Bollywood film.  I generally don't like Indian films, as I find them even more inane and silly than Hollywood ones, but I loved this one.",1156377600,2,718,4.213235294117647
8181230,5,B00004TL89,"Throughout Raj Kapoor's career and Padmini Ramachandran's career, they have both striven to show their artfulness, their oddity, their beauteous visages, or some combination of the above.  I am quite close with Bollywood and really what happened in Mera Naam Joker is the coming together of two artists who have shared the stagelights over the span of 30 years.  They are well acquainted with eachother, in fact they were great friends.  So for them, in Mera Naam Joker it was all fun.  This is as well as an explication in Chaplin format of diplomacy.... ooops! I gave it away.  However, to hear that it is an excellent movie from a French man, and not expect more from the film, I pupu that. hehehehhehe LOL.",1125878400,3,710,4.693548387096774
8181231,4,B00004TL89,"Apparently not a success when it first came out (too sad, too serious) this is the film where Raj Kapoor perhaps gives most of himself. I do not think it is 'one of history's best movies' but it is an extremely good film. It is he story of a boy who has only a clown-doll to remember his father by and who, despite his mother's opposition, determines to follow in his father's footsteps and himself become a clown. The film is notable for the many changes of mood and tempo reflecting the different periods of the central character's life, each marked by the gift of the clown-doll to a woman he loves (and loses). Raj Kapoor gives a virtuoso performance as the Chaplinesque clown but the lad who plays the character in his early years is also excellent.",1125014400,4,754,4.471014492753623
