7925503,5,B00004WL39,This is a really good video. The background looks a little PBS-ish but the workout itself is rockin! It is a perfectly paced routine and allows room for building up to higher weights. I was looking for a workout that was just strickly working out with weights and wasn't compiled with a bunch of aerobic hopping and moving all over the place and this video was it! Straight forward weight training. GREAT WORKOUT!!!,1211760000,,415,4.698630136986301

7925505,5,B00004WL39,"After doing aerobic workouts for over 10 years, I decided to incorporate weights into my routine.  Weights III was recommeded to me, and all I can say is WOW!
Of course, any weight training is beneficial, but this workout is special for a number of reasons.  First of all, I was 50 years old when I started working out with weights.  I had sustained an injury to my wrist and elbow about 3 years earlier, and had continual pain and limitation in normal movement.  I thought I would just have to live with it.  Since doing Weights III twice weekly, I have noticed the pain subsiding.  I think this is because Francesca does at least 3 sets for each of the muscle groups, but separates them into circuits so I wasn't hammering away on my joints and tendons with non-stop sets on one body part.  Also, her stretches before the workout are very thorough.  In fact, I rewind after the workout and do them.  Francesca is one of the few instructors who actually holds a stretch long enough to do some good.  Her form is excellent, but she doesn't spend a lot of time explaining it.  I think she is assuming some previous weights experience.  I find if I make my body align like hers, I get a terrific workout. Her sets are slow enough that you can increase your weights as needed.
And the other results?  I feel wonderful after this workout.  I have developed definition and strength.  My posture has improved.  I receive positive comments on my appearance.  I will always do aerobics, but Weights III makes me feel invincible.  It stengthens my body and clears my mind.  Highly recommended.",1010793600,,1584,4.553191489361702
