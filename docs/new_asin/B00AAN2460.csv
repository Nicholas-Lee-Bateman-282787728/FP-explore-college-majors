8549227,4,B00AAN2460,"The film is excellent in exposing the influence of ALEC on state legislatures, and the extensive effect they have already had on legislation that threatens the well-being and freedoms of ordinary people. I did not give it the full 5 stars because it is 2 years old now and doesn't cover recent developments. Also, the jacket lists it as 57 minutes, but it actually only about 40 minutes because the remaining 17 minutes are devoted to another subject--the educational effect on voters' knowledge of issues of the 2012 presidential debates.",1399852800,,539,5.0
8549228,5,B00AAN2460,"Watching the DVD (2012 version) right now. it is excellent. a perfect companion for THE KOCH BROTHERS, EXPOSED!, also available here on Amazon.

8549231,4,B00AAN2460,Moyers is always good.  I was a little disappointed that he didn't name names or companies - actually I had heard of ALEC and wanted to learn more.  This is a great film if you know nothing about ALEC,1370390400,3,200,4.102564102564102
