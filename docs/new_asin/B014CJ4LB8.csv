8730242,4,B014CJ4LB8,"ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES

Released in 1959, Attack of the Giant Leeches takes place in a small swamp community in Florida where giant leeches threaten the populace. Ken Clark stars as the ranger who investigates the strange happenings.

I didn't have much hope for this flick considering its dubious name, its short length (62 minutes) and the fact that its B&W, but the characters are decent and the story engrossing enough. The late 50s ambiance is worth the price of admission and the swamp atmospherics effective. Clark makes for a great masculine protagonist with his athletic build and meek disposition (sorta like a smaller Clint Walker). Jan Shepard plays his wife, the good girl, contrasted by Yvette Vickers bad girl. Vickers was the July 59 Playmate of the Month and the movie is sure to show off her body a little bit. While the leech monsters are rather lame, the sequences in the underwater cave where the leeches suck the blood of their captives is pretty nightmarish with the accompanying spooky music.

Despite these positives, critics lambaste the movie on the grounds that the leeches are laughable, essentially people covered in trash bags with suckers here & there where you can clearly see the actors arms moving inside the bags. If you can overlook this shortcoming, this is worthwhile 50s swamp horror.

The film was shot in Los Angeles

PIRANHA

Released in 1972, Piranha chronicles events when a brother & sister photography team (Tom Simcox & Ahna Capri) enlist a guide (Peter Brown) for a tour in the jungle wilderness where they meet a friendly-but-mysterious hunter named Caribe (William Smith), who lives in the jungle. Caribe shows his true colors when he acts upon his Native namesake.

People badmouth this movie because they fell prey to a bait-and-switch by DVD-makers or whomever. This is NOT the Roger Corman nature-runs-amok flick of the same name from 1978. Neither is it a creature feature at all. It's a realistic Venezuelan jungle adventure/thriller with hints of horror highlighted by genuine early 70's atmosphere. Despite being an adventure/thriller, the title Piranha does not misrepresent the movie, which is explained in the second half and ties into the plot (Im not going to give it away). Another thing to keep in mind is that the movie was released in '72, three years before ""Jaws"" made nature-runs-amok flicks popular. So the filmmakers didn't title it ""Piranha"" with the intention of misleading fans of creatures-on-the-loose flicks.

In any case, the cast is great, although they coulda done better with someone other than Capri in the female role, even though she plays the part well despite my slight misgivings. Simcox is a likable masculine protagonist and its too bad he didn't become a star, although he had constant TV work. Brown is good too, but its Smith who towers here, literally at 62, but in overweening taciturn charisma as well. Caribe seems like a cool guy to party with in the jungle and the quartet have some good times together, including a long (8.5 minute) motorcycle race, but the story takes a dark turn in the final act. Ive seen a handful of Smith films & TV episodes over the years and this is by far his best role.

Some complain about the stock footage of numerous animals, but it adds to the jungle atmospherics. Others complain about the thinness of the plot and the seeming padding with the animal, Native and diamond-panning footage, etc. This has caused some to criticize the movie as a Venezuelan travelogue, but I enjoyed this aspect. Viewing the film IS like vacationing in Venezuela and I found it interesting and informative, but its just a stage for the interesting low-key drama of the quartet. And, say what you will about the thin story, it gels together into a meaningful whole with interesting things to glean.

If you're in the mood for a 60s-70s psychological adventure/thriller I recommend Piranha. However, if you need an explosion every second and unrealistic action sequences to maintain your attention look elsewhere.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot entirely in Venezuela.
