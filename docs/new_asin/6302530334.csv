486965,4,6302530334,"I'm a sucker for any time travel story and this is a good one. The premise is that a group of jaded people from the future go back in time to observe various disasters from the past such as the Chicago fire, the eruption of Krakatoa, etc. The hero is the operator of a small hotel where such a disaster is about to occur and his latest tenants are a group from the future. If you like time travel stories as I do, you'll love this one. Well written and well acted. Fascinating premise; absorbing execution. Maybe this is not the best such story you'll ever read, but well worth your time and the price.",1018828800,4,602,4.243478260869566
486966,4,6302530334,"--a ""communal review"" by Charly Wood's English 101 class Owensboro Community College
Often when you think of a science-fiction movie, big hits such as INDEPENDENCE DAY and STAR WARS come to mind.  Rarely though, do you see a movie that offers an original story with the absence of large scale special effects.  In the movie GRAND TOUR, you are given the rare opportunity to use your imagination.  This movie did a good job of not making the idea of time travel any more complicated than it had to be.
The strange tourists in the story are able to travel around using special ""passports"" to watch certain events as they occur.  They now desire to watch catastrophic events unfold as some sort of pathetic entertainment.  It seems to give them back the excitement they lack in their world.
There were several situations in the movie where there were ethical choices to be made.  This movie gives you the opportunity to dive into yourself and explore your own moral standards.
The acting quality did lack at times--the visitors went a little overboard and the daughter seemed a little too perfect to be believable.  The movie, however, has a wonderful plot with some strong character building and a fresh approach to time travel.  The main character, Ben Wilson (played by Jeff Daniels), is tormented throughout the movie with an unresolved inner conflict.  Despite his own guilt feelings and his father-in-law's constant criticism, he has been able to develop a touching relationship with his young daughter.  The movie combined the disasters, both personal and the ones the traverlers saw, very well.
All things considered, we think you should take the ""time"" to ""travel"" to the video store and rent GRAND TOUR. It is one ""event"" that is worth watching.",972777600,29,1752,4.908474576271186

I will not give away  the story, but if you like a good story about the 'what ifs' of time travel  you will love this film.

A much better job here than with her story The Last Mimzy. A smaller budget has a way of making the director work harder to do the film but often makes for a better movie, as in this case. I wonder what the film would have been with a bigger budget with a theatrical release.

487016,3,6302530334,"By now David Twohy should be a trademark.  A kind of Spielberg for B movies.  But it isn't.  Not yet at least.  This man has been directing consistently good genre films for some years now (""The Arrival"", ""Pitch Black"", ""Below"", ""Chronicles of Riddick"") so when I found that its first one was still there unwatched, I immediately took to find the piece and give it a go.
What a nice story!  Full of logical holes if you have mastered your Doc Brown technique, but what a nice tale nevertheless!  Jeff Daniels plays an Inn owner that receives the visit of tourists from a strange place, that came just to be witness to a big event.  That's enough information for you.  Enjoy the tone of the story, its little town that looks from Capra seen by Spielberg or Dante, that nice orange-yellow glow that pervades so many 1980's films (despite this being done in 1992).

I found a copy years ago and before I even got to view it again I had given it to a relative who was visiting from out of state. Needless to say I never saw or heard about their take on it again. But now I have my very own copy and you can forget about borrowing this one! This movie will sneak up on you if you just give it a chance. . . fifteen minutes or so.

487020,3,6302530334,"I'm picky about movies, so my 3-star is worth 4 from most people, except those who need car-chases, exploding cars, and wire-supported stunts. It has one piece of sci-fi that initiates the plot: People from the future time-traveling back to our present. From that point, the plot plays out rationally, though the time-paradox is not truly confronted or explained away. The present-day characters are realistic and well defined, as are their interrelationships. The future people are left somewhat fuzzy, though they are fleshed out as persons, not mere mysteries. For anyone who likes sci-fi or futurist films, I highly recommend this. For the rest, it at least deserves a rental.",1203724800,2,680,5.1909090909090905

Would I recommend it? Only to a true sci-fi geek like me or a collector.  The movie makes an attempt at the end to astound us...but a blind man without his seeing eye dog in a dark room could see it coming before he even sits down!  Bad example but kind of truthful.,1195171200,,441,3.8555555555555556
487022,5,6302530334,"Maybe not worth it weight in gold, but it is one hell of an experience. How it is not available at a more reasonable price is a wonder that is beyond be. This film really deserves to be release to Blu-ray. It is that good. The plot is fresh and engaging and the characters are believable and three dimensional. There is not a skip in the beat in the events from scene to scene. Everything over lapses and builds wonderfully. The telling is extremely compact and nothing is thrown in without reason.

The only time travel movie that comes close to this picture would be ""Back to the Future"". Both film are well acted and are constructed with writing that is next to impossible to surpass, but this film is more of a drama that tugs at the heart strings and the other is more of a popcorn picture that is more goofy and flashy and is played for laughs. It is a shame that this film has fallen to the waste sides and is almost forgotten becoming a footnote in a bygone existence.",1190592000,,976,4.304347826086956
487023,5,6302530334,"I first saw this film on tv back in the 90's, it had been retitled 'Timescape'.
Although a low budget sci-fi movie it relies on a clever story and good acting to carry it off. The special effects add to the story, not support it as with some of the higher budget movies.
I had been searching for the film on DVD for some time and eventually found it on DVD under the Timescape name, but the quality of the image on that version is poor in contrast to this release under the 'Grand Tour' name.",1189036800,,492,4.135416666666667

487026,4,6302530334,"Imagine a group of travellers comes to your Bed and Breakfast at the little town in the country where you live. At first only their persistence to stay seems odd since much of your home is still not painted and sawdust is all over the floors. You wern't planning to open for at least another week. When they pull out stacks of bills saying name your price it is hard to resist. But then you also note one of the visitors is obviously not in tune with his surroundings. Truly a duck out of water. When he is almost killed and his passport reveals some unusual dates it becomes obvious the visitors aren't only time travellers but very morbid ones at that. For it is disasters they want to see. Afterall there is no disease, crime, or war where they come from. So people practically live forever and want for nothing except something exciting. Well written screenplay and good acting from Jeff Daniels make this a winner. Not to much in the way of SciFi as much as life philosophies are important to the storyline. My wife and I recommend it as a rental first. Be sure to catch Jeff Daniels in ""Bloodwork"" and ""Speed"".",1187481600,,1116,4.4487804878048784

As a Science Fiction Genre, it leads one to believe that the Time portal is a possibility. The story line is not one of those that leaves no doubt it is a fiction. The movie keeps you engrossed throughout the entire story.",1155686400,5,385,4.436619718309859
487037,3,6302530334,"For a low budget movie, it wasn't bad...well except the ending. It was kind of like a long Twilight Zone episode. Time travelers from the ""perfect"" future go on adventures for excitement. Their time is given a description that sounds like Heaven by one traveler. But their paradise must be boring if they are wanting vicariously to experience tragedies. Ben Wilson (Jeff Daniels) wants to save his daughter from dying in it and so he sets into action to prevent her death and others as well.

It's not a bad flick so if it ever happens to be on TV or can get a hold of a copy cheap, watch it. I really hated the ending just because it didn't make sense to me.

One part that was interesting was when the time travelers left they were going to another disaster. New Orleans in 1999. Well, this was made in 1992 so of course the writers didn't know that a hurricane was going to hit it 6 years later.",1154563200,,898,4.3076923076923075
487038,5,6302530334,"This is an excellent and fun movie. However, as my daugher pointed out, the concept was held short of desiring a repeat viewing by insufficient scene development, poor special effects, and a sometimes unbelievable scripting. For the latter, for example, there is completely insufficient disbelief voiced by the characters when they discover time travel is involved. Even with all of these minor short-comings the key actors permit one to suspend growing disbelief to thoroughly enjoy this story. Recommended to time travel and science fiction fans. Some bad language and an implied sexual scene, so parents of younger children should exercise some judgement.",1151712000,,658,5.46078431372549
487039,4,6302530334,"Grand Tour - Disaster in Time is a decent movie with above average acting and writing. Jeff Daniels is the ""name"" actor in the cast, and does a respectable job of carrying the story and fleshing out his character. He plays Ben Wilson, a widower with terrible guilt feelings about his wife's accidental death and his less than noble reaction to the accident (he fled the scene).

Our story picks up on his life with his daughter Hillary as they struggle to finish their bed and breakfast inn. They are confronted with a tour bus full of people (time travelers from the future on a Grand Tour of history's great disasters, thus the title of the film) that want to rent his unfinished inn and won't take no for an answer. Turns out his inn is perfectly positioned for the group to witness a devastating meteor strike on the small town where Ben and his daughter live. After the meteor strike, Ben catches on to the group, and he follows them to an abandoned plant where they are preparing to witness a second ancillary disaster in the emergency shelter for the survivors that is set up at a school. When Ben sees what they are training their tourist interest upon, he realizes that daughter Hillary is volunteering in the school, and races to rescue her, arriving just seconds too late as the school explodes from a gas leak, killing her and everyone else.

In the concluding act of the movie, Ben acquires one of the traveler's time passports, allowing him to go back in time and prevent most of the deaths in the town from the meteor strike and prevent the gas explosion at the school, saving his daughter's life.

One of the nicer plot twists in this movie is the fact that the future time travelers found a bit more than they bargained for when they encountered this particular ""bygoner"" named Ben Wilson, who wasn't content to let them get away with their detached voyeurism but challenged them to regain their humanity and feel for the victims that they encountered on their tour. Like all good science fiction, this story touched upon the larger themes of what it means to go through this life and to truly be human in spite of the shortcomings of those around us.

All told, this is a very satisfying story. The effects are a little cheesy, and the supporting cast is weak, but the strength of the screenplay and the acting of Jeff Daniels help to make this a worthwhile movie. I recommend it, and give it 4 stars!",1144454400,10,2419,4.541284403669724
487040,4,6302530334,"""Grand Tour-Disaster in Time"" came to me as a pleasant surprise. When I first saw it on home video I had read a really positive review and found it to be right on the money. Although the film suffers from a low budget (in fact director Twohy should revisit this with a nice large sizable budget)the characters are well drawn and Jeff Daniels gives a stellar performance. It's the end of the world for the citizens of a small town. When a group of odd travelers take up resident at his inn Ben Wilson (Jeff Daniels) gradually begins piecing together the real reason they are staying with him; a major disaster is about to happen. These spectators are tourists from the future who want to witness the event, human suffering and chaos that will result. Wilson determines that he, his daughter and the residents of the town must somehow survive this unknown tragedy. Wilson intends to change ""the past"" based on this knowledge something the visitors can't allow.

Image quality is decent for this Anchor Bay release. The film was shot on a shoe string budget overcoming these obstacles with an imaginative screenplay based on C. L. Moore's classic short story ""Vintage Season"". The film takes some major departures from the original story but unlike some reviews here I felt that these departures allowed the audience to identify more readily with the main characters. Director Twohy (""Below"",""The Arrival"", ""Pitch Black"")does a great job of taking genre staples and turning the story on its head. ""Grand Tour-Diaster in Time"" is no exception to this. There aren't any extras to speak of beyond the trailer.

While ""Grand Tour"" isn't a perfect film it's one of those rare films that manages to overcome its limitations due to the sheer imagination of the cast and crew. ""Grand Tour"" is definitely worth a visit for science fiction fans.",1138492800,11,1832,4.8498402555910545

In light of budget restrictions, the screenplay wisely focuses on character development, and keeps the special effects to a minimum, and the movie is all the better for it.

  If you're interested in a good story that doesn't insult your intelligence and can handle a couple of hours without too much gee-whizzy effects, you could do a lot worse.",1127001600,4,574,5.393258426966292

487043,2,6302530334,"This film is a take on C L Moore's classic short story  ""Vintage Season"". In ""Vintage Season"" time travellers from a distant future visit the present. Just as wine connosieurs savour a particular ""year"" so does these travellers seek out a specific year noteworthy for its unexpected descent into tragedy. Like that last Bank Holiday in August 1914, before the Great War came. The travellers are totally dispassionate about the events they witness, they are just as happy visiting the coronation of Charlemagne as they at witnessing the collapse of a modern civilisation. Reading the story conveys the impression that time travellers would view any world they visit as sort of an open air zoo or theme park. The story is disturbing, particularly as it is written from the persceptive of a man who only gradually realises that his visitors are the equivalent of racecourse spectators waiting for a crash, and that his world is doomed to collapse. The travellers are venal, petty and devoid of any empathy for the suffering of others.
Whilst copying several of the plot elements from the original story the film burdens Jeff Daniels with an unbelievable soap opera-ish tragedy in his past. The tragedy is supposed to invigourate Mr Daniels into trying to change the future, even though he can't change the past.  The narration is weak, and the ""action"" by Daniels lacks any dramatic tension. Daniels is an actor too associated with light roles to bring much dramatic tension or detremination to the role. A happy ending when the future has already been written ? A great story looses all its strength when watered down to this anaemic film.
Unfortunately this film, like the latest remake of the ""Time Machine"" just doesn't do justice to its antecedents.",1058054400,6,1751,4.9523809523809526

The story: A group of time traveling tourists come back to see a disaster unfold in a small town where Jeff Daniels' character has a small Inn (with a perfect view).
