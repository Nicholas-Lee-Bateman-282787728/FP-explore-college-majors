2297222,5,B0009KA2UO,"This begins as a slow-paced and understated drama. A young woman (Yoshimi Matsubara) is newly embroiled in an ugly divorce and moving with her six-year old daughter (Ikuko), the focus of a nasty custody fight, into a rather cheap and nasty block of flats which is all her budget allows. She takes a not very satisfactory job and introduces her daughter to the rather insalubrious local kindergarten. Meanwhile strange moments of creepiness start to crop up. A child's red handbag appears in odd places. A strange small figure is seen running through a doorway. And there seems to be water leaking through the ceiling. All is not quite right in this new home. As the drama develops these strange moments of creepiness get more sustained and, as it becomes slowly apparent that we are watching a quite astonishingly realized ghost story, they develop into some of the scariest sequences you are ever likely to see. Look out for (not that you are likely to miss it) the scene in the kindergarten when I is playing hide and seek and, come her turn to hide, something strange and watery comes looking for her... Best of all is the climactic scene, where, Yoshimi having more or less figured out the mystery, the suspense becomes almost unbearably intense. The scene reaches its climax in a moment of horrified realization that is one of the cleverest and most frightening moments in any horror movie. I'm getting a little old and jaded and there are not many films that get me back to those delicious hide-behind-the-sofa moments of childhood. But this did. Mr Nakata is of course the guy who made the extraordinary 'Ring' (or 'Ringu' as its American distributor insists on calling it) so it might have been a bit worrying for him that people would come to this with very high expectations. If so, he need not have worried: this delivers. In spite of the huge success of 'Ring' which must have put him in a position to command a respectable special effects budget, there's little evidence that he has bothered, making do as he does with astonishing camerawork, brilliant direction, first rate acting and a perfectly realized imaginative vision. Don't spoil the experience of seeing this wonderfully creepy movie by letting yourself see the soon to be released, tediously inevitable Hollywood remake first.",1115683200,4,2300,4.884910485933504
2297243,5,B0009KA2UO,"This is an amazing movie. The subtly of the horror means its ""real"" horror (the last place you'd want to know a dead body was) and not just bad actors in makeup. The acting is superb and I don't know why people complained at the back plot, it's woven into the ghost story-just having the horror story is what makes many of these movies incomprehensible, here you know why things are happening. The main character is a very gentle vulnerable woman which, of course, adds to the whole thing. The grimy, decaying concrete apartment block is a great addition. A sad, poignant ghost story with some horror overtones. I loved it.",1488412800,5,623,4.621621621621622

2297250,4,B0009KA2UO,"Dark Water is definitely a slowburn shocker, as until rather late in the movie, not all that much happens, it just seems to be about an insecure woman making a stand for herself - but that doesn't mean that the movie is without suspense.- it is actually quite astounding how much menace the film manages to put into trivial things like dripping water, yellow raincoats or red children's handbags, creating a creepy atmosphere out of almost nothing. The deliberately slow but suspenseful pace only contributes to the overall feeling of the film. Now add to that a story that's really well-structured, some impressive imagery when needed, and the cast is first rate and you've got yourself a very haunting movie.",1479686400,,710,4.925

However, it only takes a good Japanese horror film to raise the goosebumps and I remember Dark Water being one film that gave me a fair share of the bumps. Of course, now that I've gone back to it years later with Arrow Video's Blu-ray release, the scares aren't as effective, but there are moments where it still managed to creep me out. Arrow Video has released a Blu-ray with plenty of features, but the video quality just doesn't cut it.

MOVIE REVIEW

As Yoshimi Matsubara ( Hitomi Kuroki) fights to keep custody of her child, she is also busy trying to find a place to live and work. She finally ends up living in an apartment building with her daughter (Rio Kanno in an amazing performance), but the place immediately feels creepy and rundown. It doesn't take long for water to start dripping from the ceiling, hinting at worse things to come than just water damage. As Yoshimi struggles to keep things together, she starts seeing a little girl in a yellow rain slicker running around the building but disappearing before she can get close enough.

Things come to a head when her daughter seems to have befriended an invisible person, who might possibly be a ghost (it is). Yoshimi must hurry to solve the mystery of the little girl or else she may lose her daughter forever.

The plot for Dark Water comes across as simply a ghost story with a mix of murder mystery running through its watery veins. If this is your first time seeing Dark Water, be prepared to be gripped by the mystery, however, seeing it for the second time, some of the oomph of the mystery evaporates quickly. Of course, that can be said for most films that involve a plot that centering around a murder, so I can't exactly fault the movie on that.

What still worked in Dark Water for me was the ending, which definitely still gave me chills, with several creepy moments rearing their ghostly head. Also, the ending leaves the viewer with a soul-crushing conclusion that most films wouldn't dare go for.

Dark Water's viewing experience is best the first time around, going in with no idea of what to expect. Nevertheless, seeing it again, still managed to give me some spooks.

BLU-RAY OPINION

Unfortunately, Arrow Video failed to impress me completely with this release. Whatever source that Arrow Video used had some serious issues and no matter how much cleaning up, it just does not come across as Blu-ray worthy. Nevertheless, there are moments where the video exceeds expectations and the bad parts are never enough to distract from your overall viewing experience.

The audio thankfully fairs much better, with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track filling your speakers with creepy dripping and the pattering of rain and screams.

As for the special features, we have several interviews to check out.  There is a nice, informative 26 minute sit down with Director Hideo Nakata, who goes through some of his career hits. Also included is a 20-minute interview with Author Koji Suzuki, writer of the original Dark Water short story. The final newly shot feature is with the director of photography, Junichiro Hayashi. Rounding it all out is archival features, interviews and trailers.

VERDICT

Arrow Video's Dark Water Blu-ray provides fans with a somewhat solid Blu, with the biggest issue being the transfer. As for the film itself, it will give first-time viewers the chills for sure. If you have seen the movie several times before, it might be a hard sell on picking up the Blu, for the fans that need to own it, this Blu-ray is it.",1479168000,,3737,4.711656441717792
2297252,5,B0009KA2UO,"I've seen this movie a few times, and remains to be one of my favorite from the J-Horror fad of the early 2000s.  Simply put it's a story of a mother trying to get custody of her daughter from her husband while they are going through a divorce.  We learn little to nothing about the husband, which is done intentionally making it so we have to form our options about him based on the mother's interpretations rather then being about the form our own.  Where this gets complicated is that the main antagonist ""ghost"" in the film balance on the fine line of being real and vengeful like any normal ghost movie, or psychosomatic and entirely delusional.

And this is at the core, what i love about this film, and each time i watch it i like to judge weather the mother is actually seeing the ghost or not, and i find i can easily go either way depending on my own experience of the film during that viewing.

Just to note, this film is creepy, slow and much more in tune with the old classic 50s black and white horror films rather then the new gore feast that litter the pop culture of horror movies.

As for this Blu Ray transfer, the image quality isn't amazing, yes better then the Bootleg I picked up in Asia, but is grainy and makes it feel like it was shot with incredibly slow film at all times.  which might be true, but that said the extras are awesome.  Interviews galore, and ever aa excerpt from one of my favorite j-horror film historians for the booklet.",1478476800,5,1466,4.344322344322344
2297253,1,B0009KA2UO,"This movie is NOT English dubbed as stated in the product description.

2297254,4,B0009KA2UO,"Japanese horror (or J-Horror for short) came along just in the nick of time.  By 2002, franchise icons like Jason Vorhees and Michael Myers were barely pulling in an audience and one-shot stabs in the dark like Ghost Ship and Feardotcom were uninspired attempts at creating stand-alone scares.  Meanwhile, in the land of the rising sun, the horror genre was giving birth to new generation of angry spirits that harkened back to a less gratuitous - but no less grotesque - menagerie of monsters.

Director Hideo Nakata launched the J-Horror craze with 1998's Ringu, remade as The Ring in 2002 by Gore Verbinski.  By that time, Nakata had already made a sequel himself and was pushing things in even more interesting directions with Dark Water, a psychological drama with a supernatural edge.  While the selling point here (and in the 2005 remake starring Jennifer Connelly) remained creepy ghost girls and an unrelenting sense of doom, the film's structure swings toward a more mature approach to the fantastic material.

Recently divorced and emotionally unbalanced, single-mom Yoshimi is locked in a nasty custody battle for her 6-year-old daughter, Ikuko.  And their recent move to a run-down apartment block isn't helping things.  A persistent leak in the ceiling leaves an ugly stain and young Ikuko seems obsessed with the empty apartment above them, from which they both hear unexplained footsteps.

After a suffering a trauma at kindergarten, Yoshimi begins to suspect that her daughter is being ""haunted"" by the ghost of a missing child that lived in the building, a ghost that manifests itself in every drip, trickle and torrent of water.  But by the time Yoshimi discovers the truth, the fight to keep her daughter safe might require a sacrifice that will tear their family apart.

With the rush to adapt every minor Japanese horror flick to American screens, Dark Water feels a bit too obvious at this point.  The vengeful ghost who can't rest until its corporeal body is given proper respect seems awful predictable.  But that gimmick is almost an afterthought here as the focus narrows onto Yoshimi's fragile mental state.  It's a convincing and often cringingly emotional performance by actress Hitomi Kuroki, and one can see why Connelly, an Academy Award Winner, found the role appealing.

That's not to say the Dark Water is without its share of spine-tingling moments.  After all, the J-Horror genre practically invented the corner-of-your-eye scare tactics that have now been embraced whole-heartedly by the likes of James Wan and his Insidious and Conjuring franchises.  Nakata masterfully uses the apartment block layout, employing security cameras and clunky elevators to capture the ghostly presence on film.  Only the epilogue, with a now grown Ikuko narrating her return to the scene of her childhood trauma, feels a bit on the nose.  Otherwise, Dark Water is a surprisingly adult horror story that finds just as much grief and longing in this world as the next.

Arrow Video's dual-format Blu-ray / DVD features a clean hi-def transfer and a trio of brand-new interviews to go along with the previously available ""Making Of"" and archival interviews.  The new sit-downs include director Hideo Nakata, novelist Koji Suzuki and cinematographer Junichiro Hayashi who combine forces to tell a pretty comprehensive tale of the J-Horror movement and their respective inspirations.  A trailer, TV spots, still gallery and reversible sleeve featuring new cover art complete the package.",1477872000,,3503,5.184724689165186
2297255,3,B0009KA2UO,"Dark Water,"" directed by Hideo Nakata (Ring), is a highly atmospheric tale of the supernatural. Yoshimi (Hitomi Kuroki), a single mother struggling to win sole custody of her only child, six-year-old Ikuko, moves into a dilapidated apartment complex, where alarming visions and unexplainable sounds challenge her sanity and endanger not only her custody of Ikuko, but perhaps their lives as well.

When the ceiling of their apartment starts to leak uncontrollably, Yoshimis life begins to unravel. As the building gets damper and damper, she becomes obsessed with a missing girl who used to live upstairs. Things get creepier when feet can be heard running about on the deserted floor above, something isn't right about the tap water, and the building seems to be bursting at the seams.

Director Nakata is proficient at creating tremendous atmosphere without Hollywoods typical horror flick devices  quick shocks, graphic gore, and monsters. His movie is a unique, intriguing ghost story that builds suspense in stages by blending tension with a familys emotional plight. However, viewers might be disappointed that there isn't more of a pay-off.

Special features on the 2-disc unrated Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include a new interview with director Hideo Nakata, new interview with author Koji Suzuki, archive interviews with actresses Hitomi Kuroki and Asami Mizukawa, making-of documentary, trailers and TV spots, and reversible sleeve containing original and newly commissioned artwork.

2297256,4,B0009KA2UO,"Review-Lets start this review, 3 years previous to this film coming out. 1999, the fear of the Y2K. The birth of napster, to change music as anyone would know it. The Blair Witch Project, that changed horror and the internet more than anyone could ever imagine. In the 90s, people wanted their horror to respect their fandom. Films like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer entered the fray and smartened up the genre. Where people were no longer doing cliche things, but making fun of the films that people did those things in. Blair Witch Project was the film that tested how it could manipulate an audience to buy into something. Much like Jaws, that made you buy into that you are never safe in water. Blair Witch, with its clever marketing and strategies in motion, made you feel that you could be witnessing a supernatural murder. Then came the hype machine known as Battle Royale. In 2000, there was no film to ever be hyped quite like this film. The films word of mouth grew. You felt at that time, if you did not see this film, you truly were missing out on something. I can remember buying a import dvd for a pretty penny. I also can remember, telling all my friends and family,  you have to see this film. This is also around the time that we saw J-Horror start to take off. If you did not know anything else about Japanese Horror, you knew Ringu. You also knew that America had an eye on their films as well, to get ready to  Americanize them. Dark Water, I can proudly admit, I never watched the remake. I have no interest in watching that film. ( After the remakes of One Missed Call and The Eye, I would never watch another remake again of any J horror) Dark Water tells the story of a recently divorced woman who moves into the creepy high rise building with her little 6 year old daughter. Once they get in the new place, she has a stressful custody battle with her ex. She thinks this is the worst problems that she will encounter, but she soon finds out there's a mysterious spirit of a little girl who also lives there.

The director (Hideo Nakata) and the writer (Koji Suzuki) of ""Ringu"" (the film later remade as ""The Ring"") reunite again and offer us Dark Water. I like this film just as much as I did Ringu. While the pacing is extremely slow, the feel of the film is intense and keeps you at the edge of your seat. The emphasis of this film is to build up the characters and let the film flow slowly and convincingly. The horror element of this film is tame, but yet effective. The real scares is watching this film unfold. The acting in this film is very effectively strong. The pacing of this film is brilliant. The blu ray transfer looks perfect. Though, I will admit, I do not know what to compare it towards, since this is my first time watching this film. Arrow, are doing some amazing work on getting these films their proper releases. If you need a reason to buy this, let me just say, why not?",1476576000,,2933,4.348540145985401

The story in this film is creepy and haunting. The film moves at a very slow pace throughout a bulk of the runtime, although it is very atmospheric; a lot of creepy imagery and a few great jump-scares here and there. The pace is somewhat of an issue as it can lose you at times- I love slow-burning horror films, but even this was a slight problem for me. However, this is one of the few modern horror films that gets the third act right; the ending of this film is excellent- the definition of haunting and bittersweet. It has great acting throughout, and amazing music.

Overall, Dark Water is a solid horror film with great performances and music, be prepared for the slow pace and you should have an enjoyable experience. I recommend a purchase for fans of slow-burning and j-horror films, a rental otherwise.

Dark Water has some violence.",1363219200,,1113,4.72680412371134
2297297,5,B0009KA2UO,"Dark Water is a Japanese horror film directed by Hideo Nakata (Ringu, Ringu 2, Death Note: L Change the World & most recently Words With Gods) about a leaky apartment. Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki) has been going through a divorce and her child is caught in the crossfire between her mother and father. During this time, Ikuko (Rio Kanno) and her mother move into an apartment; however, it is a little leaky. Not to mention there have been some strange things afoot.

The film barely has a soundtrack which builds tension really well and when there is not much sound, the smallest things make you jump. This is why I love Japanese horror, they are usually filled with Shintoism, have very realistic makeup effects and are genuinely scary (most of the time)! American films hardly phase me anymore. Ghosts and monsters are in your face all the time! Whereas Japanese horror films--especially Dark Water, Ringu, Ju-On to name a few--tend to keep the gore, ghosts and goblins tucked away until the very end. This is what made the original Ju-On so suspenseful and creepy: the big reveal. Dark Water is along the same lines when it comes to scary-time. The atmosphere feels real and seeing character development in a horror film is great for a change. When you're overwhelmed by monsters and gore for the better half a film, you are not focused on characters; however, if you are not focused on all the creepy aesthetics it forces the writers and directors to flesh out the characters.

As far as story goes, Dark Water has a different kind of ghost story to present, which surprised me. However, part of the big reveal can be called within the first ten minutes. This is okay, but when Ringu had you wondering for the latter part of the film--unless you got to that film late and everyone had spoiled it for you--Dark Water becomes a bit of a let down. Dont get me wrong, Dark Water is a great film and is totally worth your time, just don't go in expecting Ju-On or Chakushin ari (One Missed Call).

However, Ive noticed a trend in most Japanese entertainment. Their stories seem to revolve around loss and failure a lot. Dark Water surprised me with its sentimental mother/daughter appeal, but Ringu 2 had a similar drive to its narrative. Looking back, the film really seems to be about protection--as in a mother protecting her child from harm! Just thought Id clear that up for all the perverts of the internet. When viewed in the correct context, Dark Water is an amazing, heart wrenching and suspenseful title you won't soon forget.",1359158400,3,2540,4.703370786516854
2297298,3,B0009KA2UO,"What started as an oddly compelling story about a domestic problem (a custody battle), eventually, and by eventually I mean 90 minutes or so, eventually turns into a brief but devastating haunting.  The problem with this is that I was expecting a horror movie, at the very least a ghost story.  When the ghost is coy and rarely seen, I don't count that as much of a fright.  Most of the movie was spent demonstrating just how neurotic a mother can get when faced with losing her child, getting a new job, and moving into a less than attractive apartment.  Watching this woman struggle to maintain her composure while coping with the usual adversities of life was one thing, shoving a ghost into the mix at the last minute proved to be more than just the last straw.  It came across as an odd afterthought instead of the main focus.  If this was truly a ghost story than why was the filmmaker so stingy when it came to showing that aspect of the story?  For me it was a case of far too little, too late.  (To make matters worse, they tacked on a postscript titled ten years later, or what the ghost(s) are up to now.)

The scariest thing in this movie was watching the mother's gradual meltdown.",1346630400,,1194,4.415525114155251
2297299,3,B0009KA2UO,"I saw the American version of this movie and didn't realize that this was the Japanese original till about 30 minutes in. Mainly because the American version was forgettable and so is this one really. If the two movies were mixed together they might make something worth watching but really this is more of a suspense/mystery movie than a horror film. The most disgusting thing about it isn't even really shown here. In this movie there is a good scene with the ghost in the elevator that I give 2 thumbs up, and in the American movie if I remember correctly you get to see the reason why the water is well... tainted. I think that's the strongest part of the film and the director doesn't really play on the fact of why the water in the building is the way that it is. Instead you just get leaking ceilings etc. etc. I don't find a leaky roof or running faucet scary. Only if your trying to frighten me with the idea of having a high water or plumber repair bill. Other than that get a bucket and move on.

Japanese horror movies are really slow and try to coast you into the suspense. Usually throwing a twist at you once you get to the end. By the time you do get to the end it feels like you've been watching for so long that you don't even care anymore. I watched this movie over a period of 3 days, and I still felt like it took forever.

The ending was pointless and made more sense the way it ended in the American version although I didn't care for what happened there either.

There are some genuinely creepy moments that were missing from the remake. I won't spoil them here, but suffice to say, this movie continues the trend of making Asian school girls scary.

The Bad -- The end resolution comes out of nowhere. Yes, one could piece together what the spirit wants, but it's just so abrupt that I couldn't care less about the movie at its reveal.

Despite some creepy moments, Dark Water doesn't offer much that hasn't been seen before or since, which is a shame since it's well-made with decent acting all around.

The Ugly -- The physical reveal of the spirit at the end. The physical effect with accompanying sound effect is cheesy and made me laugh. Add this to the already hackneyed ending and an average experience stays average.",1301011200,,890,4.759740259740259

The dialogue is fairly slow and predictable and a fun way to train one's ear for ""real life"" Nihongo. Not scary enough though and the mother-daughter relationship wasn't convincing.

2297302,4,B0009KA2UO,"I loved this movie.  The mother's devotion toward her child was so strong and intense that I found myself crying at the end.  The plot is this: Ghost wants Yoshimi (mother) to be her mother and is jealous of Ikuko (the daughter).  Yoshimi is paranoid about what ghost is going to do to Ikuko.  However, it's really not that simple afterall.  It's riveting to watch as the story unfolds and you find out the history behind the ghost.  In fact it's sad.  Horribly sad.  The cinematography is effective in that it's rather monochromatic -- lending a somber tone to the film.

Yoshimi is over-stressed.  She is recently divorced, going through an ugly custody battle, she has to find a job and a new place to live.  And then there's the ghost to deal with.

The ghost to me was more of a sad little creature than a menacing threat.  But Yoshimi does not see things that way and ultimately sacrifices herself to save her daughter.

I owned this DVD long before the American version came out and I am happy that was the case.  As usual, American film-makers bastardize incredible Asian movies, simplifying them to the point they are not even interesting.  Such is the case with America's Dark Water.

If you want to truly enjoy this movie, buy the Asian version and watch it in the original language with English subtitles.",1182816000,6,1317,4.607758620689655
2297313,4,B0009KA2UO,"Having watched both the Japanese and Hollywood remake of Dark Water, I prefer the Japanese version [though the remake is watchable]. The Japanese version just seemed more creepy, and the acting was a whole lot better. The story centers around Yoshimi [Hitomo Kuroki], who is in the midst of an acrimonious divorce and heated custody battle with her soon-to-be ex-husband over their 5 yr old daughter, Ikuko [Rio Kanno]. Having no stable income of her own, Yoshimi is forced to lease an apartment in a run-down apartment complex. Almost immediately, they experience strange things like a dark, wet stain on the bedroom's ceiling that never seems to dry up. Complaints to the management elicits no follow-up action and so Yoshimi tries to solve the mystery on her own. By this time, she has also found a job in a publishing firm and is trying to get her life on track, but the sinister goings-on at her apartment cause Yoshimi to question her sanity. Her daughter Ikuko keeps finding a red backpack that Yoshimi comes to fear for she instinctively realises its menace. At heart, this is not so much just a horror story but that of a mother-child relationship, played out both in the real world inhabited by Yoshimi and Ikuko, and also the world of the ghostly entity that has focussed its attention on Yoshimi. The struggles of a single parent are very well-explored here, and both the actresses who portray Yoshimi and Ikuko do a great job of portraying the mother-daughter dynamics. Yoshimi feels she is not a good mom for not being able to better provide for her daughter and another instance when she is late picking her daughter up from school. This is resolved in an ironic manner at the end...how far would a mother go to show her love for her child and protect her? A beautifully made movie, with an element of horror that not so much as startles you, but slowly and insidiously creeps up on you. A great addition to the J-horror genre.",1180828800,2,1942,4.697947214076247

There is nothing unnerving about a puddle unless you have a sick dog in the house. Ok, you are a single mom who loves your kid so much you'll do anything for her-- including taking the place of a drowned girl's mother and care for her ghost forever to spare your child! Bravo! Mom of the year. I am not that in tune with Japanese ghost lore but I imagine little drowned girls with stringy hair play a big part of it because so many movies center around that theme.

I don't believe all horror needs gore to be scary, mind you but it would have helped this turkey fly. I really appreciate a good ghost story like the original version of The Haunting but haven't seen a Japanese film of that ilk to compare it to. If you want to see a cool Japanese horror movie try Ichi the Killer or Infection. Ichi for the gore if you like that sort of thing and Infection for a truly spooky mindbending experience.

Although I enjoyed Jennifer Connelly's sensitive performance, having now seen the original, the American version is definitely lacking the creepy, foreboding atmosphere of the Japanese version.  There are very scary moments in the film involving the mother (a great performance) daughter (an adorable, but not annoying child actress) and their ghostly encounters.  One scene of the daughter playing hide and seek at school is particularly spooky.  What I love about this movie is that it relies on atmosphere and mood to provide the scary moments and it is highly effective at providing them.  There is a huge sense of foreboding and dread throughout the film, no gore or cheap tricks, but genuine fright, the dilapidated apartment building where everything takes place is appropriately dreary and creepy.  This is for fans of psychological thrillers like ""Rosemary's Baby"", I highly recommend it, it kept me from sleeping the first time I saw it.",1162857600,6,1029,5.2439024390243905
2297319,4,B0009KA2UO,"Dark Water feels like a movie from an older time.

It's not trying to shock you, by having the monster leap out from the shadows with a clash of cymbals. Instead, like horror films from the 1960s, it's trying to build up a convincing psychological horror--the unstable mother who can't protect her child, isolated and unlistened to, in an unfeeling world. The budget here (and one suspects a small one) doesn't deliver a very terrifying spirit in the end. It would feel like a failure to the true fans of Hollywood horror films. Instead, the movie tries to make the *situation* scary. And, in that, it succeeds.

Dark Water is about a single mother, struggling to keep custody against her ex-husband, who takes an apartment in a decrepit building. Odd things begin to happen, centering around a water stain in the ceiling, which all leads to a satisfying and suprising climax. There is also an unexpected coda at the end which is emotional, rather than terrifying, leading me to believe that the film-makers didn't just want to make a horror movie, but wanted to make a human movie.

Some horror film fans, as I say, will find all of this quite disappointing. They'll have wanted more ax-murderers and less touchy-feely stuff. Understandable. However, this is the kind of horror film that touches on something real, and as such, is longer-lasting in the mind. A good job.",1162512000,3,1371,4.8008474576271185

2297324,5,B0009KA2UO,"Of all the modern horror films coming from Japan, I fear ""Dark Water"" (""Honogurai mizu no soko kara"" or ""It came from the dark water"") is the one that will be most lost in translation.  Many of the themes being dealt with are simply not issues in the US, specifically the scandal of a divorced woman raising her child alone.  Divorce is still very rare and disgraceful in Japan and children are often given to the father who is seen as the more important parent with a greater chance of providing financial support and thus being able to remarry and establish a ""proper"" environment.

With this in mind, ""Dark Water"" is more a film about family than ghosts, specifically the type of sacrifices a mother must make for her child.  She must, and does, give up every thing to ensure her daughter's future.  The story is brief, being taken from a short story collection by horror author Koji Suzuki.  Anyone can figure out the secret of the ghost fairly easily, and that's OK because it isn't really the point.

Director Hideo Nakata brings his same stylistic flairs that he showcased in his other Suzuki adaptation, ""Ring."" There is clearly a connection between these two, author and director, that works very well and I hope that they continue the partnership.  Nakata knows what is scary about Japan, about the fears and expectations of parents, and he plays all of these to their strengths.

Another possible area for confusion in ""Dark Water"" is the appearance of the ghost.  Many viewers seem to be frustrated in seeing long, dark-haired girls dressed in white and dripping water.  However, that is what a Japanese ghost looks like and it is to be expected for filmmakers to use the same archetype over and over again.

2297328,3,B0009KA2UO,"Hideo Nakata's (""Ring""), original Japanese version of ""Dark Water"", is a supernatural suspense drama about a divorced woman and her daughter, who seem to be haunted by the ghost of a dead child in their new apartment. The City of Tokyo, seen from bleak urban landscapes and generic streets and lots, is a lifeless form of steel and concrete, as is their decaying apartment building, nourished only by the cold and discomforting presence of drenching water. It's in puddles in the hallways, dripping from the ceiling, pooling on the building's roof, and gathering in the roof's water silo where the mysterious happenings may be originating. While the rising water lines suggest impending disaster, the horror factor remains lukewarm, and the 'drip-drip-kerplunk' suspense becomes disarming, as the social consciousness of missing and exploited children robs the film of its fright value. It becomes less a ghost story than it does a 'child in peril' safety concern. The conclusion, said to be ambiguous, made perfect sense to me, and it unfolds as if waking in a dry arid land from a horror soaked dream. Hitomi Kuroki brings much conviction to her oppressed single mom character, and her performance keeps the film's floodwaters rising steadily.

2297329,3,B0009KA2UO,"I recently saw a short television program here in Japan to promote the Japanese launch of the US version of Dark Water!  After learning of  the spectacular efforts to remake Dark Water to an American version ( to follow on the success of The Ring no doubt) including the casting of Oscar winning actress Jennifer Connelly in the remake, I was excited to see the original Japanese version.

The story of Dark Water is straightforward- a mother and daughter, a custody battle, a move to a new apartment, a new school for the girl and a new job for mom.  An expanding water leak on the ceiling of the apartment foreshadows the growing evil presence to come as the story unfolds and we learn that a young girl who lived in the apartment above and had attended the same school, went missing 2 years earlier.  The ""scary"" part of the film is not necessarily the havoc that is wreaked on the mother and daughter- which is a combination of psychological and supernatural- but rather the unravelling of clues as the viewer attempt to figure out the significance of the water leak, the school and the mother.... and how it all ties together.

This is a film with meaning, not simply horror for horror's sake.  That said,  it is slow and deliberate.  This is not a spectacular show of gore and guts.  It is meticulous and precise. For example, there are repeated scenes of  an empty hallway in the apartment building-  it is gray and lonely and cold and sad.....  this is the  type of canvas that the director (Nakata) paints to infuse this film with spookish and frightening elements. Personally I am not sure I would say this is a ""horror"" film so much as a supernatural thriller, not so much scary as it was eerie and creepy...

2297332,3,B0009KA2UO,"After massive success with the ""Ringu"" movies, Hideo Nakata tackled another of Koji Suzuki's novels: the dark, dank horror novella ""Dark Water."" While the acting is top-notch and the direction is pretty good, the film has some of the worst dubbing I have ever heard.

Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki) is in the middle of a messy divorce and custody battle over her daughter Ikuko (Rio Kanno). Starting on a new life, Yoshimi gets a new job and new apartment in a run-down building. Its only flaw is rotten drinking water and a leak in the middle of the bedroom ceiling.

But as the leak grows, so do Yoshimi's problems -- a child's bag keeps reappearing, a dead child keeps appearing in the building, and her daughter keeps talking to the nonexistant ""Mit-chan."" It all centers on the water tank on the rooftop -- and the horrific price that Yoshimi may have to pay to keep Ikuko safe...

After ""Ringu"" and ""Ringu 2,"" it seems appropriate that Nakata's next work was another one of Koji Suzuki's horror stories, although amped up a bit, and with a new ending. This movie feels a bit like the apartment complex: dark, dank, a bit grimy and somewhat claustrophobic. It seems like the perfect place for a person who is questioning her sanity.

""Dark Water"" is not Hideo Nakata's best work; compared to the ""Ringu"" movies, it seems rather clumsy. A few of the climactic scenes are unintentionally funny, such as when the green, slimy, faceless ghost rushes Yoshimi. But Nakata manages a sense of lingering dread throughout the movie, and includes a powerful, tragic finale that sticks in the viewer's mind long after the movie has ended.

Kuriko puts in a very good performance as Yoshimi, letting her face and eyes express the character's sorrow, rage, fear or love. She dips over the top in the lawyer's offices, but remains a powerful presence, especially in the final scenes. Ranno gives a pretty standard performance as Ikuko, except for her final appearance, when she seems to be overwhelmed with misery.

But if the acting is good, the dubbing is nowhere near as good. It's bad. Really bad. Most of the dubbed voicework sounds painfully affected and hammy; Yoshimi is a strong and determined woman, but sounds ditzy and breathy here. The worst is Ikuko, who sounds at least five years older than she is. Whose brilliant idea was that?

Hideo Nakata doesn't quite strike gold here, but ""Dark Water"" is a creepy, dank horror movie with an unexpected finale. Too bad they couldn't leave the atrocious dubs out of it.",1132617600,,2517,4.772413793103448
2297343,4,B0009KA2UO,"Dark Water poses an elemental question: How do we evaluate a society? Koji Suzuki's answer may be in the way we treat our children, and Director Hideo Nakata's haunting adaptation of child abandonment and parental sacrifice doesn't fail to deliver.

Dark Water begins with Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki) in the throe of a bitter divorce, and embarking on a new life with her young daughter, Ikuku (Rio Kanno). Needing to relocate, they settle in a dank riverfront apartment in a desiccated Tokyo neighborhood, staffed by an opportunistic property manager and recalcitrant superintendent. Yoshimi's less than ideal new job, and Ikuko's trepidation about attending a new school add to their apprehension. Their struggle takes an unexpected turn when Yoshimi senses the ghostly presence of a young girl, wearing a yellow pauncho and grasping her red Mimiko school bag, which Ikuko later finds, but Yoshimi won't allow her to keep. Despite its disposal, the bag mysteriously reappears throughout the film, poignantly punctuating the plot. Yoshimi realizes the serious nature of the girl's presence, who manifests herself, at first, with a watermark on their apartment ceiling, looking much like Sadako's ring from Ringu, before worsening into an ungainly apparition with the passage of time. Yoshimi's new responsibilities keep her from picking-up Ikuko after school on time, on a few occasions, which fuels her estranged husband's drive to gain Ikuku's custody, haggaring an already frustrated Yoshimi.

But here is where the mystery deepens.

The waterworks are accompanied by footfalls from apartment 405, leading Yoshimi to investigate. She learns that a young girl, Mitsuko Kawai, lived in the apartment and was abandoned by her father, following a broken marriage. Moreover, Mitsuko may, in fact, be competing with lkuko for her affection. Emotionally torn, Yoshimi must try to protect her daughter from Mitsuko's pursuit. If this sounds familiar, do not misunderstand. Dark Water is a unique film, with its own story to tell, distinct but not disconnected from Suzuki's Ring series, and well worth viewing.

Children--particularly infants, young girls, the infirm, the frail and the elderly--are society's most vulnerable members. Two decades ago, novelist Morris West grappled with a similar theme (among others) in the Clowns of God (1981), which debated whether or not the mentally incapacitated had the right to survive a world catastrophe. (You'll need to read his novel, for yourself, to learn his answer.) In Dark Water, Hideo Nakata masterfully brings to life a young girl's ghostly search for love and acceptance that overpowers the living.

Dark Water is more about the difficulty of the main character's situation as a struggling single mother, than it is your typical Asian ghost story.

After viewing countless American style horror films, I immediately took to the varied pacing and attention to atmosphere of Asian horror.  With Dark Water, Nakata takes his time, deliberately pacing his story and developing the primary characters.  While this is a ghost story, rather than merely setting up scenerios where the ghost scares the bejeezus out of two-dimensional dupes, Nakata seamlessly tells a tale of a mother pushed to the brink, going through a tough divorce, and having to find a home for herself and her daughter, not to mention a job to pay the bills.  And as if that wasn't hard enough, she just happens to move in right below a ghost.

I like the idea that everything does not have to have tidy resolution in film.  I enjoy the fact that I may have a few questions after the film is over.  Is this story told from the mother's point of view?  The daughter's perhaps?  Is this a story about the strength/weakness of the bond between a mother and daughter, or just a creepy atmospheric ghost story?  I think Dark Water is all this and more.  I find myself going back over facets of this movie well after the fact.

Dark Water is a compelling story of a mother and daughter's struggle to survive and stay together under very strenuous circumstances.  If you are looking for an upbeat, fast paced horror film, pass this one by.  Dark Water requires patience through the first two acts, but pays off in the third, in a way which completely fits this thoughtful, moody tale.",1127952000,12,1774,4.6957928802588995

Emotionally fragile, the product of divorced parents herself Yoshmi desperately wants her daughter to have a more stable upbringing than she had, but with the interference of a vindictive ex-husband she is having a hard time of it and she has to find a new place to live and a job, not to mention the fact her daughter will have to start a brand new school.

The apartment Yoshmi and her daughter Ikuko eventually move into isn't exactly the Ritz but it is a roof over their heads and is near to a good school.

However strange things start to happen from the moment mother and daughter move into the apartment, like the shadow of a child glimpsed coming and going from the building especially in the lift.

Also huge water stains appear on the ceiling of the apartment and drip constantly, as each day passes more and more liquid oozes into the rooms every day and Ikuko's Aunt complains that the water in the apartment is bad and brings her own water in to cook when she has to babysit for Ikuko.

Yoshmi calls the landlord in but he refuses to do anything about it, saying the building is damp from so much rain and what else should she expect?

Add to this a child's red school bag shows up in odd places and soon a more physical manifestation of the child herself starts appearing and Ikuko finds herself an imaginary playmate that shares her bath and who talks to her in whispers that only she can hear does the little girl's mother start to really worry.

Yoshmi eventually discovers the origin of the ghost and all hell is let loose as the young mother desperately tries to save her daughter from a vengeful child spirit whose own mother had deserted her a few years ago and whose death in the water tower on the top of the building has never been discovered.

This is a seriously creepy movie; I thoroughly enjoyed it, no blood and gore, just tension, spooky moments to make you jump, a good dose of hysteria and all round good acting from the whole cast.

I watched this film with the subtitles on, I can't stand dubbed films, they do my head in, but the subtitles didn't detract from the film at all.

I'm not sure what the American version of ""Dark Water"" will be like, probably better special effects but I doubt if they will ever get that moment of terror when Yoshmi realises that the child she has pulled out of the bath is not her daughter but the child spirit who wants a mother and will do anything to get one.

This movie moves a little slow and is not very scary at all. It's similar to the Ring 2, because of the water theme and the ghost-girl-trying-to-steal-another-child's-mom story, but the Ring 2 sorta sucked. I felt no connection to the mother or the child, and they didn't seem to have a very strong bond. You couldn't ""feel the love"". And the kid in this movie is quite cute, while the child in the Ring was just plain creepy. I was rather teary towards the end of Dark Water, and I like movies that have emotion.

Yoshimi is a newly divorced mom who is fighting for custody of her daughter, Ikuko. She really wants to be a good mom to her daughter because her own mom neglected her. They move into an apartment in a creepy building where you never see any residents walking around  with the exception of two old ladies talking through a cat.

One night, Yoshimi notices a water spot and water begins to leak from it soon after. The manager doesn't want to do anything about it, so Yoshimi puts a bowl under the leak and doesn't think much about it.

Even though Yoshimi was trying to be a good mom, it seemed as if she was always looking for her daughter. She never kept a good enough eye on her, because this little 5 year old was running around without supervision. She was constantly late picking her up from school as well. Ikuko ran around on the roof of the building, and one day, finds a child's bag. The manager explains that there have been no children living there for a long time. The bag ends up in Lost and Found, and eventually, in the trash. Later on, the bag keeps reappearing and eventually ends up in Ikuko's bag for school.

Yoshimi sees a poster for a missing girl one day who has been gone for over a year. The leak in the apartment grows bigger and bigger, but once they fix it, the terror was just beginning.

It bothered me that I had to watch a ""dubbed in English"" copy, which ruined it a little for me. But, that's the one that was sent.

The story revolves around a little girl and her mother struggling to survive together after her husband turns out to be a horrible man. They are forced to move into a dark and rundown apartment building and that's when strange things begin to happen. The ceiling drips water -no not weird black water, just ordinary water. The spots that appear on the ceiling are chilling and the movie is full of suspense.
However, there were plot holes so large you could fall in and wander around confused as the movie went on without you....empty spots...the harsh ending didn't make sense...you'll ask yourself ""how did I miss that?"" and wonder about the loose ends that never get tied up, but are used to spook you and build a story. Little girl is ADORABLE though, and it is well-acted. The American remake is a re-telling with a few changes made (like black water)and a LOT less scares, so see this one instead!",1122768000,,1126,4.75
2297365,4,B0009KA2UO,"One has probably heard the expression, ""water water everywhere.""  Well, that's the weather report of the Japan in Honogurai Mizu No Sokokara, or Dark Water.  Dark Water was originally a collection of short stories written by Koji Suzuki, who exploded onto fame with The Ring.  The first of those stories, ""Floating Water,"" was adapted into a full-length feature in Japan, and was the second work of Suzuki adapted to the screen by Hideo Nakata.

Yoshimi Matsubara is going through a rough patch in her life.  She is involved in a custody battle with her ex-husband over her nearly six-year old daughter Ikuko, and is searching for a place to live.  That they do, in a decrepit dingy seven story apartment complex.  Encouraged by the friendly realtor, they move in to Room 305.  Unfortunately, the apartment is old, the drinking water tastes bad, and water keeps seeping through the flat's roof.  Kamiya, the elderly live-in apartment manager, makes a note of it in the log, but doesn't do a thing about it.  The water-stained spot keeps growing until one time, while resting by her sleeping daughter in bed, she wakes up to find the whole bed and pillow sopping wet!

Ikuko finds a red plastic handbag with a cute cartoon rabbit, Mimiko, up on the apartment roof.  Instead of letting Ikuko keep it, Yoshimi has Kamiya put it in the lost and found box.  There's something about cleanliness Yoshimi has, presumably her revulsion to something discarded-you know, who knows where it's been?  However, it has a tendency of turning up in weird places, which begins to scare Yoshimi.  And is Yoshimi seeing things, or was there a small girl in a yellow plastic raincoat on the fourth floor?  And is there any relation to a girl from Ikuko's kindergarten who went missing two years ago?

While Yoshimi tries to be a good single mother, things aren't easy between trying to get a job, getting off work late, and trying to pick up Ikuko from kindergarten.  She has been a very sensitive woman, having been so affected at proofreading some graphic and sadistic novels that she'd undergone psychiatric treatment, that the custody hearings raises her stress level.  Her ex, on the other hand, is a cold and calculating, but factual person, who doesn't seem too concerned with Ikuko as much as wanting to score a victory over Yoshimi.

The custody battle itself is anything but peaceful.  As Yoshimi's lawyer Kishida tells her, the mother has the advantage when the offspring is six years or younger, but things at the apartment, the red bag, and her husband's cunning tactics at revealing her mental health gets Yoshimi hysterical in full view of both her lawyer and her ex's lawyer, which helps  damage her case.

The film's noir ambience is partially due to the rain, which it does a lot of in this movie, but the darkly lit corridors and elevators of the apartment complex create an atmosphere suitable for psychological horror, for which the last half hour before the postscript is a whirlwind of suspense and scares.

Hitomi Kuroki does well in portraying Yoshimi, who has the frightening ordeal of having to live alone, provide for her daughter, and balance things out, making one sympathize with the sensitive woman.  And Rio Kanno (Ikuko) is a sweet daughter one roots for.  This single mother-child pairing worked well in the previous Suzuki adaptation Ringu.  Those who saw Ju-On (the original Grudge) will recognize Isao Yatsu (Kamiya) as Saito-san, the wheelchair-bound old man at the hospital who does the peekaboo game and silly noises.

What Psycho did for showers, Dark Water does for baths and a sink, in a scene when Ikuko turns on the tap for a glass of water and shlup!-a lock of hair comes out of the tap, freaking out the poor girl.  A well-done suspense story, equal parts custody drama, ghost story, and suspense thriller.  Oh, and given what the Americans did to Ringu with their version, I'm not even gonna bother with the American Dark Water.

Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki) has just moved into a new apartment with her daughter, six year old Ikuko (Rio Kanno). Yoshimi is just getting out a marriage and in constant fear of losing Ikuko to her husband. The apartment is close to Ikuko's school, the rent is low and they both like seem to like it. So they decide to take it. In the beginning everything seems ok. But strange things start happening in the building that Yoshimi cannot account for, such as: her daughter disappearing half the time, a pink handbag suddenly reappearing out of no where, the buttons in the elevator being burnt out, and most importantly, the constant leak that appears on their ceiling. Will Yoshimi be able to figure out what is going on in time to stop it or run away from it?

This movie proves that you do not need to have a lot of gore, or zombie faces, or sudden noises to get scared when watching a horror movie. There is an eerie atmosphere in just the constant dripping of water in this film! Hideo Nakata did a great job in directing his movie as he did for ""Ringu"". Hitomi Kuroki did an average job in acting as Yoshimi, probably because she overacted too much. Her character became a little annoying, mainly because she overacted in most of the scenes.

2297367,5,B0009KA2UO,"Just watched this again (for third time) after watching the Hollywood remake. The original is not only scarier but much more emotionally devastating. It is a fascinating mixture of two genres: the horror film and woman's melodrama. The remake is not bad, all things considered, but the numerous changes made to the plot serve to attenuate both the horror and the melo-drama. This is clearest in the film's climax. What occurs simultaneously in the original -- the mother's discovery of what happened to the missing girl; the daughter's ""meeting"" with missing girl in her bathtub -- is turned into two separate incidents in the remake. So not only does the original resolve a major plot strand AND generate suspense at the same time (heightening the effectiveness of both), it then takes the material -- before we have had chance to catch our breath or assimilate all we've seen -- to a whole other emotional level with the finale in the elevator (and which ends with a perfectly realized symbolic image: the child awash in fluids, separated from the body that gave it life). This scene in the elevator, the payoff for all that came before, is simply eliminated from the remake!

2297368,4,B0009KA2UO,"Again, I weary of trying to write a detailed, lengthy review.  Fortunately, this film doesn't deserve one.  'Dark Water' is a capably assembled, but generic and unoriginal piece of Japanese horror.  Those of you out there who may have seen the American version need to know you'll see something a bit different here.  Though it's the same basic plot, this film is much more of a ghost story than the American version  is, with less emphasis on the divorce, and the psychology of the main character.  (It still does explore these more practical issues some, however.)  Really, the remake is more original that the original is, approaching this material in a different way, but the Japanese version does what it does pretty well. (Ah, had to work in a comment to make everyone hate me.  It's 100% true, however)  'Dark Water' is reasonably atmospheric, and has some very dreary visuals, largely due to the perpetual rain. It doesn't have a whole lot going on in terms of plot, but it doesn't really need to.  That said, the film is pretty slow-moving, w/o a whole helluva lot happening for the first hour, but it's moody enough that I didn't ever get bored.  Also, the characters are pretty flat and dull, not particularly sympathetic.  And while the scare-tactics are pretty standard, (catching glimpses of the ghost in the distance, seeing her through a camera, lotsa stuff with water, naturally) they work fairly well. (With the exception of the repeated re-appearence of the dead girl's backpack, which is just kinda pointless)  This film is actually reasonably scary at the climax, up until the final reveal, which is about as terrifying and professional as a third-rate Halloween costume. (And there is not an ounce of exaggeration in that description.  It is literally that bad)  This really hurts the scene, but it's a nicely done climax, overall.  The denouemont is very well done too, though I can't describe it at all w/o giving the whole film away.  This is the one aspect where this film is clearly superior to the American version, which belabors the point excessively, and attempts to salvage some happiness from the occurrence.

Yeah, that's it.  Nothing new, but not much is.

Having seen Ringu and Ju-On I was expecting similar from Dark Water when I picked it up.  More linear in its story than Ju-On; it's a somewhat languid, suspenseful build up on some creepy moments.  A harried divorcee attempts to provide a home for her daughter whom she has been granted custody of.  They arrive at a solemn gray apartment complex and are given the unit directly below a family which lost their daughter a few years ago.  Bits and pieces of the mother's mental history come out in custody interviews and we learn that she's struggled with sleep disorders and various mania for a while.  All this serves to call into question her validity as the point of reference for the weird happenings including a forever dripping ceiling and the appearance of the mysterious missing girl, whose face is always slightly obscured and blurred.  The lead character of the mother is at once sympathetic and pathetic, you can see her disintegration commencing as the movie progresses.  While lacking some of the visceral chills of Ringu or Ju-On, it does a good job as a slow descent into madness slash ghost story piece.  Recommended.

[Update 10/15/16] The BD has finally been released and it was a day one purchase (along with Pulse which I'm super-excited about), I hadn't seen this since this last review.  The movie holds up well I think and the picture quality above DVD is worth the purchase.

What would any of us do or feel if we were basically trapped by lack of money, lack of many job opportunities, lack of family support -- and we found a reasonable apartment, near school and job.  We probably wouldn't want to move out at the first sign of weirdness.  And wouldn't any of us question our sanity if really seriously strange stuff started to happen?  So I think the film was reasonable.  And the acting was so well done.  Very minimalistic.

2297383,4,B0009KA2UO,"I have gotten to the point in watching horror films that when I watched the American production ""Dead Birds"" I was wondering if this was another adaptation of a Japanese horror film.  Apparently the Japanese approach to the genre, which has become well established on this side of the Pacific because of the success of ""The Ring"" (nee ""Ringu"") and ""The Grudge"" (nee ""Ju-on"").  However, with ""Dark Water"" (""Honogurai mizu no soko kara"") I found myself thinking how different this 2002 effort from director Hideo Nakata (who did the ""Ringu"" films) from contemporary American efforts in a different way.  Too many American horror films go the route of ""Jeepers Creepers,"" where there is a pretty good set up and then the film goes down hill and the payoff is disappointing in the extreme.  But with ""Dark Water"" I was not overly captivated by the set up, but found that the payoff really hit home.

At this point let me warn you that when you start watching ""Dark Water"" on DVD it goes right into the dubbed English track, at which point I start having flashes back to all of the badly dubbed Japanese movies I grew up on (which inevitably leads to thoughts of Woody Allen's ""What's Up Tiger Lily?"").  My strong recommendation is to stop the film and make sure you have the original Japenese language track and the English captions.  Fans of the horror genre should be at the point where they can appreciate the natural language and rhythm of Japanese cast.  Most of the key sequences here do not require you to do a lot of reading so it is not a great sacrifice and the nuances of the culture are totally lost in the dubbed version.

Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki) has divorced her husband and is in a custody battle for her six year old daughter, Ikuko (Rio Kanno).  In an attempt to make a new start, mother and daughter move into an apartment, where strange things start happening.  The weirdest are the huge water stains that appear on the ceiling and start dripping away and the red children's bag that start popping up every place Yoshimi goes.  Then the dead child to whom the bag belongs starts showing up as well.  So we have what we would now be thinking of as your basic Japanese ghost story.  But there is a bit more going on here as well.

You see, Yoshimi has some trouble being a working mom.  She needs a job to survive, and too often Ikuko gets lost in the shuffle, which sometimes means the kids is left standing outside her kindergarten waiting for her mother when all of the other kids have left.  As you would anticipate, there is an attendant irony in this as well.  But the pressure is getting to Yoshimi who thinks that she is slowly going insane, which works well given all of the above.  Characters in these sorts of movies often get so scared that they might go insane, complete with wild eyes and mad cackling, but you do not have them questioning their sanity as often.

""Dark Water"" is a less complicated and more subtle horror story than ""The Ringu,"" which is the obvious point of comparison since Nakata and his co-screenwriter Takashige Ichise did both films (the story here is from a novel by Kji Suzuki.  So it is inevitable that this film seems a lesser effort, but that does not really take away from its effectiveness.  When we got to the conclusion I found that I liked what happened, and when the inevitable epilogue reinforced the fact, I liked it even more.  I do not think this is a great horror film, but I think it is a solid one and I certainly liked it more than the original ""Ju-on.""",1119484800,43,3532,4.518867924528302

Nakata certainly can't be blamed for going with what works, but if Dark Water seems at first like a cynical recycling of a successful formula, its director has developed into enough of a formalist to at least make it reasonably compelling. Set in a dreary, rain-soaked suburban landscape of concrete block apartment buildings, some of the film's subtly composed long takes wouldn't be out of place in a Michelangelo Antonioni movie. Its atmosphere is its best asset. The final payoff is nowhere near as elementally terrifying as Ringu's most famous sequence, but enough chills are delivered along the way to keep things interesting. Because it is similar but a bit less effective than its predecessor, Dark Water could end up being a transitional fanastic and really good horror flick you won't be disapointed.",1118534400,3,1181,5.092783505154639

I can't believe they are going to take the chance of letting you see the original version of this film before the screening of the over-the-top U.S. ''remake'' due out two to three weeks after this DVD release -- unlike with Nakata-san's other J-Horror standard, ''RING,'' where they forced you to swallow Gore Verbinski's so-called ''remake'' long before they allowed a Region-1 release of the original. (I'm guessing they're betting that American audiences-- always desirous to avoid reading subtitles and anxious to descend into the next F/X induced drunken stupor --will see their overblown remake 'first' and THEN, thinking that they just saw something spectacular, will insist on viewing the original only to come away with the opinion that the remake was the superior film.)

The thing that makes the current wave of Japanese Horror so effective and so memorable is its SUBTILTY! -- something our own cookie-cutter remake masters have extreme difficulty understanding. But 'subtilty' doesn't make mountains of money for U.S. film makers (and, apparently, neither does ''originality''), so DVD marketers don't bother to offer us a chance to see original Asian movie productions such as this UNLESS some Hollywood Hack decides to jump on the film's ASIAN popularity and ''translate'' it for our own restless audiences! It's enough to make many of us who are fans of these original films very angry!

So now ''HONOGURAI MIZU NO SOKO KARA'' (''From the Depths of Murky Water'')-- Nakata Hideo's follow-up to ''RING'' --will be getting a wider American audience under the marketed title, ''DARK WATER.'' And, as always, my suggestion is to SEE THE ORIGINAL FIRST before shelling out hard-earned bucks for a multiplex showing of the overdone remake, so that you can fully enjoy the creepy 'subtilties' of this film; if you do it the other way around your perspective will very likely  be corrupted and you'll lose the appreciation for this film that it truly deserves.",1118188800,10,1972,5.153125
2297389,5,B0009KA2UO,"I saw this movie three years ago at a midnight showing during the film festival.  I've never before seen a horror film where the entire theater collectively jumped and screamed at each and every scare.  Forget Ringu, Pulse or Ju-On.  This, by far, is the creepiest and scariest Japanese horror film I've ever seen.  It's a little bit like The Shining as the characters live in a huge, dark, seemingly deserted apartment building with endless halls and a creepy elevator.  Ghosts appear when you least expect it and the thrills are achieved through a slowburn effect building to the scary if not slightly confusing climax (although what Japanese horror flick isn't a bit confusing?).  If you're a fan of the genre and haven't seen this yet be prepared for a chilling treat!  As always, Hollywood is remaking this film to be released this year starring Jennifer Connelly.  After the slight disappointment with the Grudge remake, I only hope that they do this amazing film justice.",1117670400,3,978,4.884848484848485
2297390,5,B0009KA2UO,"i bought this dvd as an import, before it's released in the US.  This movie creeped me out from start to finish. No gore, just the best told ghost story I've seen in years.

It's made by the same director that did the ring, but with a much more linear plot, much easier to follow.  The little girl who plays the daughter will steal your heart away.  If you like to be scared by film, BUY THIS MOVIE.",1116979200,3,399,4.076923076923077
2297391,5,B0009KA2UO,"This DVD has been available in Europe since last year, but since Hollywood was making their borrowed version, we don't really get to see this Japanese masterpiece sooner.

Here in this movie, Yoshimi is a divorced mother trying to make ends meet.  Nothing special about her, she wears ordinary clothes, has ordinary furniture (a total alien concept for Hollywood flicks), she only has proof reading in her resume.  The only thing that shines in this simple frau is her outstanding motherhood.  Really, Im envious, I wish I had a mum like that.

She and her daughter, Ikuko, moves into this old apartment.  Ikuko goes to kindergarten, amd mommy just got a job.  The problem is, this mother-and-daughter is being haunted by a disquiet spirit of a girl.  This girl used to live in the apartment right above where Yoshimi lives.  Also, she went to the same kindergarten where Ikuko goes.  This girl went missing, last seen wearing a yellow raincoat.

Apparently, flashbacks tell us that this poor missing girl's mother was a neglectful one, often leaving the girl last to be picked up from school.  It was then she went missing (and died) when she decides to walk home by herself.

Basically, this ghost wants a mother.  And who can possibly be the best candidate, she's the paragon of motherhood!  And that means, Ikuko has to be out of the picture. So the spirit lures the girl in so many ways than one.

Not remotely close to being far fatched as the Ringu, this movie is really creepy, the final scenes were frighteningly awesome.  Overall, a splendid movie.

Surely, Hollywood jests in thinking they can copy this movie.  There is nothing I can think of that can resemble and capture the simplicity of this nuclear family, nor the lower middle class city where this movie takes place.  Im also sure that Jennifer Connely will be wearing designer clothes.  OK, maybe she won't be wearing Armani, Id put my bets on Banana Republic.

Ugh.  Words cant say enough how much this movie is excellent, no special effects can replace the mood this movie has.",1116633600,3,2049,4.742209631728045
