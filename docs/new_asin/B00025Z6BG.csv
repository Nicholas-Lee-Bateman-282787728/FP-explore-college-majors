Apparently due to some rights issues Disney was stopped from making any more than 13 episodes of this cracking series so therefore this furry yellow marsupial is quite a rarity in the Disney cannon especially to us mere mortals in the UK (Where as far as i know it has never been aired....WHICH IS A CRIME!!). Apparently the French reclaimed it and made quite a long running animation series themselves which stuck more faithfully to the character that aoccupies their albums (graphic novels). I would recommend this Disney version just for the curiosity value alone to those outside of the USA or Canada. Actually bought this VHS tape for my nephew, but might reclaim it for myself, ha! Great unique stuff even for 32 year olds. Lol.",1170201600,,907,4.675
8022571,5,B00025Z6BG,"He's Marsupilami- the wonderfully wacky, wise-cracking whirlwind of nonstop hilarity with a tail that can turn into a swing, a spring- or anything! You never can tell what this hip-hop Houbster will be up to, so don't miss this collection of delightful escapades from the jungle's most gregarious gagster... the one and only Marsupilami! Houba!

In This Houba-Duper Volume:
""Bath Time For Maurice""
""Hey, Hey They're The Monkeys""
