8706556,5,B00UGQCLUA,"this is a awesome movie. this is one of the most chilling movies i've seen in a while. it was it scary but bone chilling especially that lullaby song it gave me the chills after she accepts the baby for who he is and when that song played at the end chills ran through my spine. i like the concept of not seeing the baby. because that tells you it is horrific and i like the idea of the audience imagining what the baby looks like. the story is good, the acting is great. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do",1477526400,,527,3.981132075471698
