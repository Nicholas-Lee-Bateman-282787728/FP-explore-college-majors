552713,2,6303039162,"The problem with Marco Polo is that it couldn't make up its mind whether it was a comedy or swashbuckler. Although I like him, Gary Cooper is miscast in this role (Ronald Colman or Robert Donat would have been better) and the screenplay needed to be more sober. George Barbier's Kubla Khan (sp?) is better suited to a Paramount farce with W.C. Fields. Ernest Truex, with that whiny voice, is almost unbearable. Who comes out on top as usual?....Basil Rathbone. He is the only reason I would watch this film.",1179360000,10,507,4.644444444444445
552714,4,6303039162,"Much has been made about the ""miscasting"" of Gary Cooper as the Venetian explorer Marco Polo. However he is one of the best actors Hollywood has ever seen and I don't believe we've seen his equal yet or are likely too anytime soon. He does quite a good job in this pic and it's a fun watch. It's not up there with Sgt. York or Mr. Deeds but you can't go wrong with any film starring Cooper. Also look for Lana Turner in one of her first roles as one of Alan Hale Sr.'s servants.",1173916800,7,478,4.042105263157895
552715,2,6303039162,"I'll always watch Gary Cooper. But as Marco Polo he's just not that good. MGM lavish production seems kind of chinzy. Amusing?  Entertaining? Not so much.  He hops effortlessly from Venice to China. He messes around with another man's fiancee in the 13th century as 20th century American men were won't to do. Nobody knows what Marco Polo was really like. He brought the west spaghetti & gunpowder. The rest of the story seems like it's from the screenwriters at MGM. The movie ends with Marco taking Princess Kukachin (Sigid Gurie) to her husband in Persia, the long way around. The more time to fool around until she marries. Nice.",1167868800,7,633,4.745454545454545
552716,5,6303039162,"Amusing, entertaining.... two words I would use in describing this holiday confection from Samuel Goldwyn. Lavish sets, costumes, music and good performances from Cooper and the Norwegian Sigrid Gurie(she is equally good in THREE FACES WEST with John Wayne).

Sigrid Gurie suffered greatly in her shaky career: At the time mof this film it was found out that she was born in Flatbush, Brooklyn and that the ""Siren of the Fjords"" was a ""fake"".

The fact that her parents were Norwegian and moved back to Norway when Sigrid was 11 months was dismissed. (Their ship was not so far the Titanic when it sunk...)

 Vivien Leigh was born in Darjeeling, India and Liv Ullmann in Tokyo. They were never labeled as Indian or Japanese. There are many similar examples and why poor Sigrid suffered this idiotic case in unbelivable. Goldwyn indeed called it ""a great hoax""... Why Sigrid left Goldwyn after ""Algiers"" is no wonder.

But she did leave us with this film, ALGIERS and THREE FACES WEST - and she playes each role differently. It`s a shame Goldwyn didn`t look after her - me may have had another star in the tradition of Dietrich and Garbo. Though I must say; SIGRID GURIE had and has a quality and a presence all her own:-)",1055894400,7,1221,4.686915887850467

552884,1,6303039162,"I began watching this because it had a pretty high review rating.  After I endured the second half with my finger on the off button, I went back to the reviews to see how people could give it so many stars. Much to my surprise I was reading reviews about Gary Coopers role in the movie. This IS NOT your fathers Marco Polo. It is a new and terrible version that is more historically  inaccurate than the Cooper version with acting that makes that one seem Oscar worthy in comparison. Actually the first half was tolerable but after they get to Armenia the costumes and dialogue get so campy and cornball it is hard to sit through. It is hard to blame the actors because the writing is so bad. The sound of ""whack, whack"" every time a punch is thrown kept me expecting to see a balloon with ""POW"" or ""CRUNCH"" reminiscent of Batman. There are many better choices for spending 1 1/2 hours than this terrible mess. No accurate history, no quality costumes or sets, no good writing, and very poor acting. I love a lot of ""B"" movies but this is a D plus at best.",1376092800,,1056,4.301507537688442

552929,5,6303039162,"Just checked this out on Prime and I truly was surprised. A mild action/adventure/comedy that can be enjoyed by the whole family. A light hearted swashbuckler that tells a story of how Marco Polo went in search of his father and ended up rescuing a princess. It's a reminder of the old Sinbad films but without the lavish fx. It's unfortunate that Oliver Reed's role is rather short but Jack Palance is unforgettable as Beezlebub. The true stand out in this picture is Cas Anvar. Yup, Altair ibn La-Ahad from Assassins Creed Revelations. He plays the comic relief and true saviour of the film, Youssef. Be the judge for yourself and check this fun film out!",1367884800,3,657,4.672413793103448

It is a more recently produced movie about Marco Polo, and the most famous actor is Jack Palance who plays Beezlebub, a self-proclaimed nastiest ruler of Armenia.  This movie also does not take place on the water, rather Mr. Polo and company travel overland, seeking the way to China.  Great costuming and excellent lighting for the beautiful terrain.  If you're looking for an afternoon's or evening's entertainment, this is the one.  No guarantees of historical correctness.",1356739200,3,577,5.095744680851064

552934,5,6303039162,"Nothing can prepare you for this film. From the quantities of plastic that overwhelms the architecture to the Mme Butterfly make up on Sigrid Gurie, from the Deco thrones that look out of a starlet's living room to the Mexican desperadoes posing as Tartar guards, while wearing what could only be described as primitive space travel gear. This whole production is a delightful plunge into the nether world of pseudo-history and really sick fantasies about the Orient that would be too politically incorrect to even imagine now, as a bad dream.
Gary Cooper looks absolutely ridiculous in his Venetian costume from the first shot. This is probably one of the biggest miscast mistakes in Holywwod's record, but the horrid version of Venice that is depicted here is bad even by Vegas standards, and it includes every single one of Cooper's outfits each one outdoing the last as the worst. I am not going to elaborate on the weird growth of hair at the back of his head that looks like a mix between a junior toreador and a punk-in-training. More annoying than the outfit is his swaggering presence that looks completely out of synch with the scenes, sort of what we could expect from Dolly Parton playing Marie Antoinette. There are a series of hollering shouts from attendants and 'broads' searching for Marco Polo in the first scene, all over the fake Venice, when he is summoned by his uncles that almost transposed the entire situation to the tacky glories of the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami, all women are wearing  polyester nightgowns and the men look so ridiculous it gives the impression of mardi gras in Alaska .The trip to Asia takes 15 minutes, maybe seven, but it actually does not matter, when they get there the plastic morphs into pseudo-China-exotica in seconds and we're at some strange place between China and Japan by way of Long Island Chinese restaurants' decor.
Basil Rathbone is the ""Evil"" Ahmed, vizier. He is his usual professional evil self and traitor to George Barbier's ridiculously homy Kublai Khan that is much more familiar with Archie Bunker's delicious vulgarity, style and  mannerisms than with any Imperial court anywhere in history, and that includes the kitchen and toilet areas.
The only reason to watch this tragic comedy is to see Lana Turner in the role of Nazama's maid. She is sassy, gorgeous and obviously delighted with the weirdness of her outfit and surroundings. Sigrid Gurie is her counterpart in characterization: A vapid, limp, and vacuous princess that can not be understood except as a product of princely inbreeding. She is constantly smelling flowers or on the verge of fainting and can never concentrate to do either properly. One regrets that she is not devoured by the vultures that Ahmed had prepared for her, as she would have done a much better characterization as a sweet and sour pork dish.
Not to be missed for the sociological/anthropological study of Hollywood's vile portrayal of  foreign cultures, which at this point is much more inaccurate, condescending  and prejudiced than it ever was during the silent era.",1265673600,,3078,4.947775628626692
552935,3,6303039162,"You simply can't take ""The Adventures of Marco Polo"" seriously...but as a light-hearted, glossy, tongue-in-cheek adventure, the film is great fun, from the same year as Warner's ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"".

With producer Samuel Goldwyn's biggest box office star, Gary Cooper, in the lead, as a drawling, skirt-chasing Polo, the film opens with an opulent, Hollywood version of 13th century Venice, then quickly moves to the steppes of central Asia, and finally the equally opulent court of Chinese Emperor Kublai Khan (George Barbier), where Cooper and his groaning comic relief (Ernest Truex) encounter Khan's exotic, if not particularly Oriental-looking, daughter (Sigrid Gurie...who learns how to kiss from the obliging Polo), and Khan's ruthless adviser, Ahmed (another terrific villainous portrayal by Basil Rathbone), who has designs on both China and Gurie.

Screenwriter Robert Sherwood tosses in a bit of history (the Chinese inventions of spaghetti and gunpowder, introduced to Polo by H.B. Warner, channeling his ""Lost Horizon"" persona), but clearly treats the storyline as farce, adding a feared (but henpecked) tribal chief (a heavily made-up Alan Hale), and his jealous wife (Binnie Barnes, who also falls under Polo's spell). Also, watch for 17-year-old Lana Turner in a small but showy role as a most desirable Chinese handmaiden (this is the infamous film where Goldwyn's makeup department burned off her eyebrows, permanently).

Directed by veteran director Archie Mayo (who lacked Michael Curtiz' flair for epic period adventure), the action scenes are a bit flat, and Cooper's climactic fight with Rathbone is somewhat disappointing (truthfully, he seems out-of-place confronting a swashbuckling villain). Certainly, 1938 audiences weren't 'buying' Cooper as an Italian adventurer (it WAS a stretch!), and the film flopped, but if you're in the mood for pure escapism, from Hollywood's 'Golden' age, ""The Adventures of Marco Polo"" is certainly worth a look!",1189555200,12,1981,5.574750830564784
