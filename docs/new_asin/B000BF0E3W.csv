2415238,5,B000BF0E3W,"After reading some of the other posts, I have to put in my comment regarding Alejandro's duet with Diego El Cigala.  I am a huge Alejandro fan and Como Quien Pierde una Estella is one of my VERY favorite songs and I was a bit apprehensive when I saw he was going to share the spotlight with someone else, much less someone I had never heard of.  But the first notes out ouf Diego's voice just bowled me over and I never recovered.  That is the most exciting arrangement of that song that I have ever heard. I couldn't stop playing it after the first time.  I think the flamenco influence makes that song even greater than it was to begin with. I have been scrambling to find out more about Diego after seeing and hearing him on this DVD.  I will be watching this concert DVD again and again---",1168560000,2,793,4.26

2415241,5,B000BF0E3W,"I think this was a great concert DVD this being his first.  if you like his CD ""A Corazon Abierto,"" you will love the concert. For those that say they didn't like the guest performers in the concert I say: ""if you want to listen to the original song, just play your CD,"" so I thought the guest performers were awsome. Two thumps up!!!!!",1134604800,4,336,4.25
2415242,4,B000BF0E3W,"I love Alejandro Fernandez, and this DVD was a great opportunity to show off his talents.  But I did not like the fact that he brought in those guests.  This was his first concert out on DVD and it should have just focused on him.  I did not that girl from La Oreja De VanGogh singing ""Me Dedique A Perderte"" with him and I really did not like that singer singing ""Como Quien Pierde Una Estrella"" with him.  That one of his most famous songs, if not THE song, and he should have sang it his way and not with a Spanish twist on it.  But like I said I LOVE Alejandro Fernandez so with me he can do no wrong but I wish he would have shown more of his Mexican roots, like hiding the mariachis off to the side, what's up with that.  I understand that he's trying to make it onto the scene in Spain, but he didn't need to go away from his classical Mexican roots.  But, a DVD of his concert is better than nothing.",1133740800,7,908,4.011111111111111
2415243,4,B000BF0E3W,"Fisrt of all, I would like to say that I would have loved to rate this DVD with 5 stars because it's very good, but there are several songs missing.

Alejandro is at the top of his carreer, he delivers the songs even better and singing in Spain opened a big door for him (I have to mention that not just from this year his albums are on that market). The production for this concert was very goood, bringing guests including Amaia (Lead singer of Spain's ""LA OREJA DE VAN GOGH""), Mal (a young singer who was on Operacin Triunfo, what happends to be the Spanish version of American Idol. Actually I don't know if this girl won or not. I would have invited someone else because this girl doesn't have a lot to give, she just sings ok but Spain has great singers such as Marta Sanchez, just to mention one) and finally Diego ""El Cigala"", a great flamenco singer.

Alejandro looks excited throughout the concert and gives his best. The concert is very varied from his classic Rancheras including the famous tracks ""EL REY"", ""MEXICO LINDO Y QUERIDO"" and his own hits including ""TANTITA PENA"" and ""COMO QUIEN PIERDE UNA ESTRELLA"" next to Diego ""El Cigala"" where they mix the classic Ranchera with Flamenco. Great performance. He also sings a potpourri from Mexico's great Juan Gabriel. Finally you can find his latest songs and hits including ""CANTA CORAZON"", ""ME DEDIQUE A PERDERTE"" next to Amaia and the heartfelt ""QUE VOY A HACER CON MI AMOR"". Other highlights from the show are the never-heard-before ""TODO"" and ""CONTIGO APRENDI"".

With the special features which aren't much you can find some footage of the rehersals and comments from the guests.",1133395200,10,1646,4.688581314878893
2415244,4,B000BF0E3W,"This is a concert Mr. Fernandez recently did in Madrid. He is clearly a great stage performer. Judged from the audience, he is especially loved by young women. Not hard to understand. And he is a great singer.  His rendition of Granada is especially powerfull, and the whole thing is very enjoyable. My only objection to the concert itself has to do with the filming,- the camera moves way too much, as it usually does these days. Fernandez is such a great performer that it would be much more satifying just to photograph him while singing, especially when he does his great ballads.

My main objection has to do with the disc itself. The man is clearly moving towards the Euoropean market, starting, naturally, with Spain. And he should have every chance of becoming a superstar all over Europe in a period when great popular singing is rare. The disc has got English subtitles, not always correct English, but never mind that, and that is fine. But the subtitles can only be selected for the extra material, not for the concert itself. He actually talks quite a bit, possibly introducing the songs, and it would have been nice for the rest of the world to be able to understand what he is talking about, and personally I would really appreciate subtitles on the songs too, as the lyrics are obviously important.

People outside the Spanish language countries also deserve to understand what this great singer sings about.

Still, he is extremely expressive, and I do enjoy the DVD very much.",1132099200,13,1494,4.734615384615385

8085873,1,B000BF0E3W,"I was really happy when I received this DVD. We played it that same night, we even invited friends to come over and enjoy this DVD but to my surprise the DVD DID NOT play all the way thru, it kept freezing. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!",1415577600,,227,4.181818181818182
8085874,5,B000BF0E3W,"As always, went out and bought Alex's newest CD the minute it was put on the shelf. He just improves upon perfection with every CD. My only disappointment with this CD is the duets. I think they detracted from the performance, rather than enhanced it. Even so, wouldn't give up the CD or DVD for any amount of money, bribes, or weellll....maybe for a date with the ""potrillo perfecto"" himself. Claro.",1196640000,,400,4.647887323943662
8085875,2,B000BF0E3W,"We love Alejandro's music but I never finished watching this DVD.  I'll sell it cheap to anyone interested.  Just not nice to watch, and not sure why.  He Entertainment value is close to zero, for both my wife and I.

Sorry Alejandro....",1179619200,,237,4.571428571428571
8085876,5,B000BF0E3W,"This concert, clearly demonstrates an artist in his prime!  Performing in front of an audience of fans and loyal followers, Alejandro hits all the emotional peaks, singing songs associated with his career as well as music set pieces he has performed often in concert.  Well done on every level! A phenomenal performance captured for all time! Who could ask for anything more?!!",1179100800,2,377,5.064516129032258
