7915684,5,B00002E255,If you like Lain and you haven't seen the last video Reset you don't know what you are missing because in this video you see what happens to Lain when she resets herself so that no one would rember her. And you see how she becomes God.  If you like Evangelion you would really like Lain. If you collect stuff from Lain this will be good for your collection.,983836800,,357,4.173913043478261
7915685,2,B00002E255,"I fell asleep twice - only out of sheer willpower was I able to finish this last in the series.
Too much mumbo jumbo - hypotheticals and the theory of life and existence.
I'm sorry, I just didn't like the  conclusion to the whole series - but I still thought the first three were  great and I'd recommend stopping after that.",958780800,,325,4.311475409836065
7915686,5,B00002E255,"As the final episode ended I could say absolutely nothing.  I sat in silence for several seconds before I was slowly filled with a sweet sense of fulfillment.  You must buy this tape.  You must buy Lain.  Why? Because  it is simply amazing.  Though for a while I had some issues with the  perhaps too tidy ending, It didn't matter to me for two reasons. First of  all, there really was no better way to end thie series and second, I was  too happy to care.  The plot of Lain has always been secondary.  The  primary goal of the series' creators was to make us love Lain as a person.  I almost felt like I knew Lain by the end, and I feel that the creators  suceeded masterfully in their goal.  You know enough.  See Lain. If you  have seen it, see it again.",956534400,7,757,4.145833333333333
7915687,5,B00002E255,"How would you feel if you knew you had to erase yourself from the memories of all beings? Reset is an exiting conclusion to a very thought provoking (though sometimes hard to follow) series. It takes you on a ride not to be  missed as Lain decides her fate and her future. Anyone who has seen the  first three tapes cannot stop there, for the series simply drags you into  Lain's world and leaves you begging for more. Do you love Lain? It was the  intent of the creators for one to love lain as a person, and to miss out on  the final tape would be to deny that purpose. Is this really the end of  Lain? You decide.",946339200,3,616,4.091666666666667
