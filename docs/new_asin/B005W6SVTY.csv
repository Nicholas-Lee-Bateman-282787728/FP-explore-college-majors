4898646,1,B005W6SVTY,"I'm curious as to what 3D Bluray players the 3 out of 5 reviews below used and what region they're located in because I had the same experience as the other two...it does NOT work in the US!

The first player I tried it in was my PS3 and it came up with a black screen with a warning and then back to a black screen where it remained until I exited out to the system UI. I tried this several times and it never played any sound or showed that it was playing a chapter when I hit the display button to show the disc's information.

The second player I tried it in was the Bluray burner drive on my laptop...it immediately said that the disc was not recognized so I tried it in the Bluray drive of my desktop where it was recognized but would not play.

I then tried it in a Samsung HT-D6730 Bluray player and it did not even recognize the disc...said ""Unknown Disc"" on the menu and did nothing when attempting to play it.

I do not have the model numbers for the other two players I tried it in, but one was a Sony and the other was a Sharp and neither one of them would play the movie. That's right, I tried it in SIX DIFFERENT PLAYERS and it did NOT work in any of them! I'm currently waiting on an email back from Amazon regarding the issue and their claim to it being ""REGION FREE"" because it does not seem to be region free at all. Either that or they received a bad batch of discs. Needless to say, it's going back!

If you live in the US and use your PS3 as your primary Bluray player or own the other model I listed above, you've been warned that it more than likely will NOT work!",1340064000,4,1588,4.0285714285714285
4898647,3,B005W6SVTY,"If you can hear sound but no picture, just pressed the next chapter button and it will play.

The 3D is good and the scenery is nice but why just 3 stars. The pace is slow and they don't show any predators hunting. Perhaps it is because of the E rating that they have to cut out the graphic scenes...",1339977600,,300,4.0
4898648,1,B005W6SVTY,"The film advertisement seems**** great.  I was not able to hear**** or view the film.  It gets a one star because it will not play on my new PS3 system.  ""Region Free"" apparently does not mean ""Region Free"" if played on a PS3.  It's going back to Amazon.

****Update on 6-19-12:  This is the same movie I bought (as far as I can tell) as ""3D Safari Africa [Blu-ray]"" which was encoded as a United States Blu-ray 3D and sells on Amazon for $19.28.  If you want to see this movie (""Safari 3D"" for $11.99) then fork out an extra $7.29 ($19.28 - $11.99 = $7.29) and you got it.  Do an Amazon search on:  3D Safari Africa.

BTW:  I give the movie ""3D Safari Africa [Blu-ray]"" four stars.  It is an enjoyable and interesting 3D film to watch but not 5 stars --- good not great.  I'm glad I bought it (even though it cost me $7.29 extra).  I will watch it again.",1339977600,2,855,4.134146341463414
4898649,1,B005W6SVTY,"Pro. Got the 3D Blu-Ray early, poped it into my 3D system (Panasonic DMP-BDT100 player to TC-PP50GT25) and got great sound.

Con. NO Picture! A warning screen with words on a black background, then nothing, just a black background with no picture. Waited some time with good sound, Player counting off time, but NOTHING.....just a black screen.

Returning item for exchange and hoping for a good copy. Will revise if the next one works.

4898650,5,B005W6SVTY,"A really breathtaking way to view a safari documentary. This really is one made for 3D, very well thought out and filmed to really enhance the viewing. I've been on safari and it is the best way currently to share my experience, with this documentary you really get a sense of the landscape and the awsomness and majesty of nature. Really enjoyed it.",1334188800,11,350,4.571428571428571

8487840,4,B005W6SVTY,"This is an excellent documentary and the price made it an even better deal. Narrated by Hunter Ellis (or should I say ""starring"" Mr. Ellis, for the numerous times he got in front of the camera, rather than focusing on the animals), it covers most of the major species one would encounter in Africa e.g. lions, elephants, hippos, flamingos, etc. I found the segment covering the elephant orphanage very moving.

I docked one star for the fact that Mr. Ellis placed his face in front of the camera more often that required. It is my view that a narrator should be heard and not seen, at least not as often as Mr. Ellis. It distracted from the viewing experience.",1356307200,3,660,4.546218487394958
8487841,1,B005W6SVTY,"I got Sony 3D player/ Sony 3D tv that play other 3D discs well, not this one. I got it below $8 and not worth the effort to return it. I pop it in and it just don't play. I'm in USA. One star rating is for the disc not playing, not a region free product.",1352678400,,254,3.5535714285714284
8487842,4,B005W6SVTY,the scenery and animals are beautiful. however this is the same as the other safari 3d. they just changed the cover so i thought it was another one. one thing i do not like is when he drinks blood of a cow. they should have left that out. there was no good reason to put that in. there is no real out of screen action but still a beautiful dvd. i,1342742400,,346,3.887323943661972
8487843,1,B005W6SVTY,"Safari 3D and Earth 3D do not work on my PS3.  I am in the U.S. so these discs are not ""Region Free"" as advertised.  They are going back.",1342569600,2,137,3.689655172413793
8487844,1,B005W6SVTY,"I have 2 sony blu-ray 3D players and this DVD would not play in either.  However, the cane-toads one which is related played.

Be forewarned.  I've never had to return something through Amazon, but looks like this one will be my learning experience.

If you are in the US and thinking of purchasing this, I'd wait until they figure out what went wrong.",1340668800,,352,4.5396825396825395
