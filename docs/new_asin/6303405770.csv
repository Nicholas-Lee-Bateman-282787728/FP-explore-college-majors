665046,2,6303405770,"Masamune Shirow writes the some of the deepest and most thoughtful manga ever, but whenever they become animated, they get butchered and stripped of nearly everything that made them worthwhile reading. This is no exception, and the animation and art direction in general aren't particularly good either. Appleseed and even Ghost In the Shell are likewise vapid and shallow anime versions of his great manga, though at least GItS had some high production values behind it. In short, skip the videos, stick to the books.",1015459200,,518,5.105882352941176
665047,2,6303405770,"When I first saw the beginning of the movie, I could already tell that it wasn't going to be a classic of any kind. What else could I realize when the movies shows the main female character gratuitously (although mildly) nude for a minute or two? But this scene couldn't foreshadow how bad this movie would really be. After watching this film, it's easy to see why Masamune Shirow - the film's director and creator of the manga this film was based upon - decided not to direct later projects based upon his works like ""Appleseed"" (which is even worse).
The premise of the film is promising, but the way everything is executed makes the movie fall flat. The coloring in the film is too varied and contrasting, and movements sometimes appear choppy and unnatural. But it's not the animation that ultimately brings this film down. Rather, it's a combination of a unbelievable plot, flat characters, and squirmish voice acting.
The plot of ""Black Magic M-66"" is silly, to say the least. The idea that a reporter can save someone from a destruction-programed robot when the military can't isn't exactly believable. And then there's the question of why the robot wants to destroy the creator's granddaughter. They say it was programmed in the robot to begin with, but why choose the creator's granddaughter? It just doesn't make sense.
And the characters themselves aren't fleshed out at all. The anti-hero heroine of the film doesn't create that feeling where we question her personality yet we appreciate what she's doing. She acts like a witch with a capital B. The other characters are equally bland, and this can be attributed to the voice acting. It's not the worst voice acting out there, but it's not that good, either. The way the characters speak sounds as if they memerized scripts sometime in their lives and they finally found the opportunity to say them.
All in all, ""Black Magic M-66"" is a poor choice for anime fans. If you liked the manga this film was based on, you might consider looking into it. To everyone else, however, be very wary about this film.",1008115200,6,2066,4.757660167130919
665048,3,6303405770,"I remember reading Masamune Shirow's manga ""ORION"" many, many years ago and I just had to find any anime based on his work.
Well, the first video I watched by Shirow was ""Black Magic M66"" and now it's released on DVD.
Watching this anime brought back a lot of memories because it is the first Shirow anime to be on DVD.  The plot is almost like the movie ""Terminator"" in a way but it's simple.  Military going after two killer robots who have been implanted with the wrong chip by the scientists to go after the head scientist's daughter.  Have no fear, Sybel - the non-fearing reporter and her partner is there.
The anime is definitely 80's and somehow you think of ""Dirty Pair"" or other anime popular during that time.
As for the DVD, the original anime I purchased was from US Renditions and now with Manga Entertainment you get a chance to watch it in English via Digital 5.1.  During the anime, I kept backtracking to compare the original Japanese 2.0 sound to the Digital 5.1.  You will hear some engine revs but not as much explosive sounds that I would expect via 5.1.  Sometimes at some areas I felt that the 2.0 sound was almost similar to the 5.1.
Also, Manga Entertainment has been known for their good English dub work.  But this time, the dub work sounds similar to the dub work of other anime companies during that time...cheesy.
As for special features, there is a character bio and cool promotions for Manga Entertainment and other cool DVD's from Palm Entertainment.
There is no series after ""Black Magic M66"", it's only a one-episode anime OAV.  You really have to be a big fan of Masamune Shirow to buy this anime.  At 48 minutes, this OAV may be too short for some and too expensive for some.
All in all, a good anime to pass over time.  A definite rental!",1006646400,,1777,4.473684210526316
665049,1,6303405770,"I don't know why the other reviewers gave this title four stars, but they are completely out of their heads. This disc has so many things mounting against it, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Black Magic M-66 is really for those who are a fan of the old school anime, stuff that came out of the 80s. This title is animated in that style, and was produced in 1987.
The movie itself isn't very long, only about 45 minutes. The plot is basically just this: army chases renegade robots, journalist chases army while chasing after a story. Everyone is running in all sorts of directions, and after watching it, you really wonder why you wasted an hour of your life. Basically if you are into slight nudity, lots of explosions and violence you may enjoy this film for the sheer cheese.
Now on to the video. It's supposedly remastered. Remastered? Does sharpening something so much that immobile objects and people's clothes look like they are jumping off the characters classify as remastered? Colors are bright but they are way oversaturated, and depending on your setup they may bleed.
And for the love of a higher power, stay away from the English dub. It is absolutely horrible. The actors made me cringe in their efforts at being army men, and all the women had very squeaky voices. The supposed 5.1 English track is just louder conversations, and louder background noises. It had no apparent virtual effects around the sound stage at all.",1004572800,3,1440,4.718253968253968
665050,4,6303405770,"It is the future (I think).  Two powerful M-66 robots have escaped from their prison and are on the rampage. and they have one thing one their mind: destroy Dr. Matthew's grandaughter, Ferris!
If you've read the  story description right, you'll understand that ""Black Magic  M-66"" is not the most cerebral anime ever made. But it has no need for  that. Instead it suceeds....
Art and animation are pretty decent. The  character designs hold true to Masamune  Shirow's manga drawings.  The  frame rates are excellent. The M-66's have spidery-like moments that look  very cool. However, the backgrounds are not very detailed, and at times are  ugly. At one point, someone attempts to animate the background, with  horrible results.
What makes this movie so good is that it has delightful  tension. No one can resist it. It rival's ""Alien"" and  ""Jurasic park"" in this way. In one scene, Sybel and Ferris are in  the same elevator as the M-66.  Sybel has a special device that works as a  magnet against the M-66, but the M-66 is relentless. That scene is just  painful, tension-wise.
The final verdict is if you like Masamune Shirow  and want a fantastic action flick, look no further. ""Black Magic  M-66"" is a classic piece of action anime.",962409600,,1238,4.809523809523809
665198,4,6303405770,"This is a five-star classic anime, but the DVD looses one star for having a not-so-great video transfer.

Black Magic M-66 is loads of fun and beautifully animated. The story is very similar to that of The Terminator movie, but more fast paced. What gets me about this show is just how scary the killer robots are. You will feel a very real sense of danger when you see these robots in action. Just the way they move is creepy.

This classic anime is a very entertaining ride, while it lasts. Unfortunately, the video quality is poor; it looks like a low-resolution video you would see on the internet with noticeable pixelation. I'd love to see Black Magic M-66 remastered some day, because it's a great show.",1267401600,,710,4.582677165354331
665199,5,6303405770,"This is a finely tuned entertainment engine that showcases excellent vehicular, 'bot and character designs. The protagonist has a nice normal feel to her: she can't leap fifty feet into the air and she doesn't carry a twelve foot sword--she doesn't even have a sword. She's a photo journalist on the trail of a hot story that just might involve some sort of military screw up. Even the androids, terrifying as they are, are designed with an eye towards making them much more believable than they might otherwise be. They are my favourite anim  robots, and I place them amongst such fine company as Gort (The day the earth stood Still), Robbie (Forbidden Planet) and Rotwang's Robot (Metropolis, 1926)

  For my Yen, M-66 boasts the best fight scenes of any anim, specifically a nighttime battle between the fearsome female warbots and human military units. That said, the animation quality is on par with other shows from the early to mid 80's such as bubble Gum Crisis and another of my favourites, the Crusher Joe movie. Some may be turned off by the rougher animation quality, but be assured there is an excellent if pared down story from the mind of Masasum Shirow, the creator Ghost in the Shell and Dominion: Tank Police.

This is the only show that for me actually generated and built honest-to-god suspense during the final, spectacular sequence. Full marks to the killy robo babes modeled after the Dirty Pair's kai and Uri!",1167955200,,1433,4.808943089430894
665200,5,6303405770,"This is a real gem, 50 minutes of pure joy and brain-massage, ahhhh.

In a nutshell, it's Terminator gone animated, with a cutesy cast and some great fights with the killer robots - keep your overblown plots and twists which don't make sense, this is what entertainment is all about.

I don't care if this is a short film to me it's still good. A journalist gets caught up in mess and now shes the one that is protecting the girl.",1142121600,,430,4.296296296296297

665202,5,6303405770,"Masamune Shirow scores another home run in Black Magic: M66.  This is one of his earlier and sometimes lesser known works, done in collaboration with Hiroyuki Kitakubo (Blood: The Last Vampire).  Shirow is probably better known in the U.S. for Ghost in the Shell, Dominion Tank Police, and both versions of Appleseed.  All of these were Manga before being brought over to the video media, and all of Shirow's titles make you think, with deep reaching social issues that transcend the animated action.

Black Magic: Mario M66 is the story of a journalist who falls into the middle of a top-secret Government experiment with robotic assassins.  One robot malfunctions and goes rogue - and sets off to assassinate it's pre-programmed target.  In this case, the daughter of the scientist who designed the assassins.  Over the next 50 minutes, the journalist must protect the girl and uncover the secret of the assassins.

Black Magic follows Shirow's tradition of creating a strong female lead character who takes charge of the situation and does her best to save the day.  Shirow's women usually breach the gender gap as Law Enforcement officers, Government agents, soldiers, and in this case a hard-nosed news woman who won't take no for an answer.

Black Magic is an excellent, if short, example of Japanese Animation.  I highly recommend it's addition to your collection.",1127606400,6,1371,5.0488888888888885
665203,5,6303405770,"In Black Magic, the anime, two military android assassins are lost.  This wouldn't be so bad, but for the fact they are still carrying mission information used for testing.  Their target is their creator's granddaughter.
Sybel, a freelance reporter, becomes involved in the deadly cat and mouse game between the robots and the military.
Has the voices of Steven Blum and Beau Billingslea as many of the military, along with lots of violence, nudity and strong language.
Not really anything like the manga, but still fun to watch.",1105920000,,529,5.0
665204,3,6303405770,"To me, Black Magic M-66's biggest flaws come in the plot holes (sometimes laughable) and it's extremely short length. However, I can't say that I'd want the movie to run much longer than it does, because it seems like it paces itself well enough...it's just that the story is pretty cut-and-dry and the majority of the movie is a wild goose chase after an inventor's daughter (who is the one being targeted by the assassin-robot)...so, it ended when it should have, otherwise it could have become extremely tedious.

The assassin-bot is definitely freaky as all hell,and there is a lot of good suspense in this flick, along with some occassional gore and some brief nudity.

Overall, I must say that you should NOT spend the money on this DVD unless you're looking at it's historical significance in anime...find a dog-eared VHS copy, or, if a friend has a copy then duplicate it.

To me, this flick doesn't feel essential for most of the casual anime-viewers out there...hardcore fans however -- enjoy.",1091577600,2,1003,4.853801169590644
665205,4,6303405770,"The government with the help of its engineers created the ultimate killing machine; two robots, virtually indestructible, armed with auto-defenses and very intelligent. Both robots were being shipped by secret plane, but a thunderstorm causes the plane to crash land. Both robots escape the wreckage undamaged, except that they are malfunctioning, they want to kill all humans. They end up wiping out a military platoon and killing more innocent people, until a news reporter gets involved to help stop the two robots. The character design are pudgy faced and a bit ugly, so are the robots, but the action sequences are very exciting. My biggest disappointment was the fact that BMM66 is way too short.  The whole movie was so exciting that I wanted it to be longer. It is rumored that American director  James Cameron, got the idea for his, Terminator movie from this anime. You too will notice the similarities when you see this anime. Violence and blood at mild levels, but nothing extreme- for teenagers and adults. I also recommend the anime called ""Cyber City Oedo""",1076976000,4,1071,4.977653631284916

665207,3,6303405770,"If you can find this movie used or really cheap, it's a good deal.  It's not the best transfer or the deepest story, but it's got action and a cool robot that destroys things.  It's a bit short, but that's okay.  If it were longer, it would probably need a better story to justify sitting through the whole thing.
