8735389,5,B0161PQCEU,"I bought this DVD around 10 months ago but I'm just getting around to reviewing it now and man the picture quality I've got to say is great and the best I've seen so far since the movie was released back in 1979 on the ABC Sunday Night Movie all of those decades ago. Still one of my favorite movies of all-time TV-Movie or feature film as the ladies were stunningly beautiful and Jane Seymour's acting talent was beautifully displayed in this movie I think it's safe to say they don't make 'em like this anymore. Getting back to the picture quality it was great compared to the uploads you see on YouTube as it looks like it was digitally restored not in HD or anything like that but definitely DVD quality sort of like some of the forgotten movies you watch on Amazon Prime Video.

Maybe some people will complain about the menu or whatever but who cares as long as you get the movie in digital quality like this you should enjoy it. It was well worth the money I paid for it and the sound was great too. I will definitely buy more classic TV Movie DVDs like this in the future I believe there's a site where stuff from the 70s are being sold on there like this but I'm loving it.

My only request is that sequel also be released on a DVD copy like this as well.",1530403200,,1264,4.197530864197531
8735390,5,B0161PQCEU,"I had originally seen this on the ABC Sunday Night Movie in 1979 when it first aired and I really enjoyed it then as I do now. Television movies don't get any better then this. Not even on Lifetime. Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders stars the all around most beautiful women. The drama and the stories are first rate. I love watching these girls as it starts out coming out of the sidelines doing their routines. As I said,  television movies don't get any better then this one. A true feminist movie. I highly recommend this movie for all ages!",1530144000,,539,4.5

8735392,3,B0161PQCEU,"I remembered watching this movie on TV at the height of the DCC craze in the late 1970s. It stared several popular actors/actresses of the day, which looking back was the main draw it had. Of course it fulfilled my preteen lusts for hot women (and many programs of the era fed off that theme). So that's the primary reason I purchased this item, for the nostalgic value it serves to relive my early teen years. I would say today that it wouldn't win any prestigious awards, and the plot likely beneath the acting abilities of the star studded cast it presented. Media production value: The video and audio presentation on this remastering is okay. It is obvious that no action was taken to revive / clean up the video artifacts, but the quality is acceptable. My main negative review is the attention to detail of the DVD authoring. When the ""play video"" link is selected, it jumps to Chapter 5 in the timeline. One has to use the back chapter, or chapter search feature, to start the video from the beginning. This is very sloppy attention to detail when constructing the DVD at the pre-authoring stage. I recommend this item for it's nostalgic value, or if you are fan of the actors (Bert Convey, Jane Seymour, Lauren Tewes).",1503532800,3,1227,4.607305936073059
