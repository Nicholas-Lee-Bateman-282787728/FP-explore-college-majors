8682667,5,B00O97AFQO,"Just saw this documentary last night and was heartbroken by the stories but encouraged by the lives changed by God and the people willing to go to great lengths and devote their lives to helping people break out of the bondage of gangs, cutting, sex industry, human trafficking. To be able to remove the ""branding"" of their old life so what is on the outside matches the new life on the inside is such a gift, a beautiful thing. I bought the DVD after seeing the documentary on TLN. Buy the DVD, support the ministry, get involved. Thank you for what you do Ink80 and the Baker's.",1448755200,,580,4.429906542056075
8682668,5,B00O97AFQO,"I loved the movie.  It's real life people telling their real life stories of redemption...how Jesus Christ gave them hope and how God took the bad things people had done to them wrongly, and used it for good, to help others and to spread the gospel.  I highly recommend it.",1424995200,,273,4.44
