3498918,5,B001BSBBMQ,"Legend Films presents ""DEVIL BAT"" (13 December 1940) (68 mins) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- now in COLOR and Glorious Black and White --- All too often, in his career, Bela Lugosi was expected to carry a film all by himself with little or no help from other actors, the director, the script or special effects --- The Devil Bat (1940) is such a film --- The sets are cheap, the script is hokey and the ""devil bat"" itself is laughably lame (a screeching bird-like creature -- as fake as they come) --- And yet as he always does, Bela makes the movie entertaining --- He plays one of his many mad scientists -- this one a (believe it or not) perfume maker who was monetarily wronged by his partners, now millionaires --- These ungrateful boobs rub this in a little too much and so Lugosi creates a giant bat (as perfume makers are so good at doing) that will strike at anyone wearing a certain scent --- Will the mad doctor end up wearing his own scent and be killed by the devil bat -- And will he get his revenge on several of these boring unknown actors who deserve to die --- As expected, Lugosi makes the character interesting, complex and even sympathetic -- and yet also fearsome as he tells each of his victims, ""good-bye"" after they try on his new fragrance --- This movie has some of the most hackneyed character acting you have ever seen -- and yet Bela never stops giving it all he's got to make this film a success -- which is more than some of the production crew deserves!

Still, for the Bela Lugosi fan, this film is pleasurable as you watch what one great and talented actor can do in one bad movie --- One is left wondering how a Brad Pitt or Will Smith would fare in such a weak vehicle --- But Bela -- ever the artist -- rises above it and gives a performance that can be enjoyed in spite of its trappings.

Story line and plot, Dr. Paul Carruthers (Bela Lugosi) feels bitter at being betrayed by his employers, Mary Heath (Suzanne Kaaren) and Henry Morton (Guy Usher), when they became rich as a result of a product he devised --- He gains revenge by electrically enlarging bats and sending them out to kill his employers' family members by instilling in the bats a hatred for a particular perfume he has discovered, which he gets his victims to apply before going outdoors --- Johnny Layton, a reporter, finally figures out Carruthers is the killer and, after putting the perfume on himself, douses it on Carruthers in the hopes it will get him to give himself away --- One of the two is attacked as the giant bat makes one of its screaming, swooping power dives --- Bela Lugosi once again takes us into his world of film and makes the most out of what he's has to work with.

3498919,5,B001BSBBMQ,"Long before Bela Lugosi's career was destroyed by the wondrously incompetent Ed Wood, the actor previewed things to come with his performance in another B-movie classic, The Devil Bat.  Notable today for being so campy you should only watch it from a tent, The Devil Bat tells us the grim tale of a bitter scientist who seeks revenge on his enemies by training killer bats to strike those using a unique shaving cream.  Truly, the heat and soul of a good-bad movie is an immersive and believable plot...

Now a part of Legend Film's Cult & Horror Classics Collection, The Devil Bat's contribution to the cinematic canon is being preserved for future generations in fully digital DVD form.  And, as with all classic Legend releases, the DVD contains two versions of the film: a newly colorized version and the original black and white version.  You're free to select which you'd rather watch, but if you haven't yet seen everyone's favorite movie monster in full color, I highly recommend you do so.  At least in my case, color connects the audience more closely to the events on-screen, and honestly makes it difficult to determine that the film is nearly seventy years old.  Plus, for fans of Lugosi, it adds a certain human element to his performance that is otherwise absent in a bland grayscale.

So pitch your tent and ""camp"" out with me!",1227571200,3,1343,4.758620689655173
3498920,5,B001BSBBMQ,"The Devil Bat is a great Bela outing.  Of course its no DRACULA or MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE but its hard not to get a kick out of this grade Z P.R.C opus about a MAD DOCTOR who develops a breed of giant bat he attracts to his enemies with a special after-shave he advises users to rub""on the tender part of your neck.""  Loads of cheap fun,with cardboard sets and pathetic special effects;Bela seems to be having a ball and so should you!

3498923,3,B001BSBBMQ,"Just as a matter of principle I am against colorization and am shocked to see it still being used, especially for such an obscure film.  Better to stick to glorious black-and-white, although the image quality on such an old movie cries out for a new copy.  Nice cover image on the jacket however and if nothing else this makes for a unique addition to any collector of Bela's movies.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Devil-Bat-Diary-The-Journal-of-Johnny-Layton/dp/1461070929/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Devil Bat Diary: The Journal of Johnny Layton</a>",1342569600,2,588,6.430379746835443

which is a plus.",1304208000,,145,4.0344827586206895
3498926,5,B001BSBBMQ,"If you've never seen this Bela Legosi classic, you must. It is a B movie at it's best, and it's now a tradition to watch it on Halloween at our house! It's a fairly short movie, and it's so bad it's good!",1289520000,2,204,3.880952380952381
3498927,3,B001BSBBMQ,"For relatively obvious reasons, ""poor"" and ""Bela"" are often paired. By the 1940s, Lugosi's career had slipped terribly, with very few exceptions. (SON OF FRANKENSTEIN, GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN, ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN are just a few highlights from the very late 30s through the end of the 40s.) DEVIL BAT was not a good movie. The premise is silly, the budget is minimal, the acting is worse. But as always, Bela threw himself into his roles, regardless of the surroundings. To take those mediocre movies and splash on some color (that looks an awful lot like old black and white photos that have been tinted) is a neat way of selling them anew. I know: I've bought several. Some work (like Laurel & Hardy's MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS), some don't. This one, I would say, doesn't. But it's a chance to see Lugosi in action, and the print HAS been somewhat restored from some of those tired cheap-o reissues. So for that I give it three stars. Is it a good movie? Of course not. Does color help it? No. But is it still fun? Oh, yes!",1282348800,2,1043,4.523809523809524
3498928,3,B001BSBBMQ,"The Devil Bat - In Color is a very nice improvement on this oldie but goodie. The quality of the print is good and the colorization is good to above average. As for the movie itself, it is one of the better efforts by poverty row studio PRC. The story is presented is pretty basic but interesting and evidently it was good enough that they reused it a few years later in the ""Flying Serpent"" (1946) by scratching out giant bat and penciling in flying serpent into the script. All in all a good movie at a good price with fast delivery to boot. Not a bad deal and I highly recomend it for all old film lovers.",1239753600,2,608,4.161016949152542
3498929,4,B001BSBBMQ,"This enhanced version really makes the movie enjoyable. The old versions were so bleached out that it was hard to watch. Bela is really a bad boy in this and you can tell he is having fun doing it. The colored version is alright, but it has faded colors like Turner color. The new black and white is really done well. ""The corpse vanishes"" is also redone by this company and it is in as great shape as well. For the price, you cannot beat this movie if you love Lugosi as I do. Legend Films did a fine job of remastering.

3498930,5,B001BSBBMQ,"Very good film made by our loved actor, master of terror and suspense Mr. Bela LUGOSI. So good story, so good performance. I prefere this kind of classic horror films, more than modern ones even without so many artificial and technical features.

8284731,3,B001BSBBMQ,"Poor Bela Lugosi, he definitely deserved better from Hollywood especially as he always gave everything he had.
Lugosi is the only thing going for this film, the rest of the cast simply can't act.
I mean when a giant rubber bat out acts the supporting cast!
but then again Lugosi was torturing er coaching him.

Its a shame the bat didn't bite more of the supporting cast.",1400716800,,371,4.537313432835821

This is a fabulously fun film for your Halloween party and any time you need a dose of that classic actor Bela Lugosi. It is no wonder he is such a cult classic performer. Have a party with this one!!",1395792000,3,318,4.229508196721311
8284733,5,B001BSBBMQ,GREAT HORROR MOVIE. THEY DON'T MAKE MOVIES LIKE THIS ANYMORE. KEEP THEM COMING.  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.LET SEE WHAT COMES UP NEXT.,1394150400,,130,4.6521739130434785
8284734,5,B001BSBBMQ,"I saw this movie a few times on late-night TV during the 1950s when the movie was only about 15 years old and still looked ""modern.""  When VHS came out in the 1980s I bought a copy and enjoyed it over and over with my two adult children.  Then a few years ago I acquired a DVD copy which had better picture quality than the VHS tape which was, by then, just about worn out from use.  It's become a family cult-classic to us and we know the script forward and backward.  When I saw this ""colorized"" version on Amazon frankly I didn't expect much because the sets in the film are relatively uninteresting--a chemist's lab, a newspaper office, a police chief's office, a hotel room and an upper-class living room, plus a few scenes outdoors at night.  What can you do with ""color"" in those dull settings, I asked myself.

What a great surprise I had when I watched the movie in color.  First of all the picture quality is vastly superior to that on my other DVD copy and I noticed things that I had never noticed before despite having seen this movie at least 100 times over the years.  Examples:  heavy marble and glass ash trays on desks at the newspaper office, the police office and a businessman's office; models of ""modern"" airplanes on Joe McGinty's desk, cookies on a plate in the patio tea scene (Mary Heath serving tea to the reporter and photographer)--on my old copy it wasn't clear what, if anything, was on the plate; cast-iron lawn furniture in the garden designed in a pretty fern frond pattern (the pattern was never discernable to me before), three floor-model art-deco cabinet radios (in Joe McGinty's office, the chemist's lab and the police station), a big wooden table model radio in the hotel room, a plastic art-deco small table model radio in Mary Heath's bedroom.  All of this was ""there"" in the older DVD and VHS copies, but they were never eye-catching or ""noticeable"" so to speak.  All this new clarity puts you right back there in 1940 with 1940 surroundings.  And as to the color, that makes everything even more 1940:  pretty blue-patterned draperies and portieres in the Heath living room, a pink flower arrangement on a low table in that room (I had never noticed the flower arrangement or the portieres before); the yellow Duesenburg roadster driven by Roy Heath; the red-patterned draperies in the hotel room and then there were the colors and textures of the clothes--a light blue suit in a smooth fabric worn by the reporter in a few scenes, then a tweed textured light green suit in another; Mary Heath's complicated 1940 coiffure (identical to my mother's at her wedding in 1940!); All of these details that I missed in the old versions come right to life with this better picture clarity and color.  Even hairs out of place on the heads of Dr. Carruthers and the photographer!  There was just one wrong color: the telephone in Mary Heath's bedroom is pink to match the rest of the decor but in 1940 the telephone companies owned all the phones and you got a black phone unless you paid a substantial extra monthly fee on your phone bill for an ivory-colored one and there were no other colors.  Phones in lots of different colors didn't come till the late 1950s.  Otherwise, the colors are all perfect for the period and really bring this picture to life.",1391990400,11,3293,4.601709401709401
8284735,5,B001BSBBMQ,What a Royal treat for fans of weird cinema like myself. Mr. Lugosi gives an expert performance and the script is very good. I like the way the colorization was done also !,1385337600,,172,4.242424242424242
