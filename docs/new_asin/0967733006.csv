201814,4,0967733006,"I would have given this five stars, but for its length. My original intent was to use it for a review of Darwin's insights to how evolution works for Biology students. Fifty minutes would have been ideal. At almost two hours in length - it fills the bill for Darwin's place in history and as a mini-biography of this great thinker, but leaves the science as a shared subject. For many non-Anglo students, it can be overwhelming in its scope.",1168646400,2,441,4.525

7800453,5,0967733006,"My background is chemical eng. I like reading the cradle of civilisation, astronomy, physics, archaeology, palaeontology, biology, anthropology, electronics. I've ever seen UFO by my eyes 3 times last year, 2013, (all appeared in the sky. Other people in the area watched it also. I've 2 eye witnesses on the 2nd watched) but I also do believe God existence as I find God's wonderful creation in me & other creations too. How wonderful is my mind & body work. From the lower cast (viruses) - highest (human/ alien) until the mighty universe (galaxies, quasars, dark matter, BLACK HOLES, etc) nothing is created by chance/ coincidentally. Even until subatomic particles bcs scientists found regularities & they can formulate it (nuclear energy, particle elementary science). I can understand some scientists anti/ battle against religion and vise versa bcs they see each other in different angle.

Scientists see anything based on 100% evidence & logic way of thinking while religion(s) is made for human moral guidance only bcs in the past/ ancient time human were still wild/ sadistic. Sometimes religion could explain something but admits miracles. It also admits God(s) who created this life/ Someone who is(are) higher thn us while Budha doesn't believe in God but in reincarnation. Hwvr, correct/ true religion is teaching us about moral/ do good things for humanity. So scientists & religion they see something at different angle bcs they both are created/ exist for a specific job.

Science without religion is like human can understand how material works/ created until subatomic level (elementary particles) but they don't believe tht stones form SOS sign in a desert means someone is in danger. They thought those are created naturally. While religion without science is like our world was created only around 6,000 yrs ago (bible says 1 day on earth is 1,000 yrs in heaven) but many geological evidences indicating/ prove much much older (some billion yrs).

I do believe in evolution/ diversity  theories bcs God commanded to multiply/ full fill earth in the early creation. All creations from viruses-human are equipped wth adaptive capabilities to changing / hostile envinroments. Elvis/ M Jackson could soon be forgotten after several generations but all creations, especially human being, are the legend. It's not a simple task to keep exist & even becomes more versatile/ intelligence  frm a very simple life form in the early creation until now. Some billions yrs already and all creatures are still keep adapting themselves for new environments (eg. climate change).  So both should fulfil each other.",1389052800,,2620,5.226190476190476
7800454,5,0967733006,This is a great series on evolution.  Liam Neisen is a fantastic narrator.  I highly recommend the series to anyone having trouble understanding evolution as it makes it very easy to understand and is pretty entertaining at the same time.,1387065600,2,238,4.925
7800455,5,0967733006,"This DVD is the latest I have seen on evolution. It is a commemorative of Darwin's 200th birthday and well worth buying. I also recommend two DVDs that are listed on this page: Charles Darwin and the Tree of Life hosted by David Attenborough and What Darwin Never Knew from PBS plus a 2 DVD set The Genius of Charles Darwin by Athena which may still be available. Finally I must mention another DVD from our friends in Seattle who have not given up dragging God into the evolution debate, this time under the so-called Scientific Case for Intelligent Design in Unlocking The Mystery of Life (see my recent review). NOVA has a recent rebuttal: Judgment Day (Intelligent Design on Trial, Evolution vs. Intelligent Design), which should shut up our friends who believe in God but have not yet heard about DNA. Let's hope they cannot come back with some new slogan to harass school boards one more time.",1385596800,4,899,4.660377358490566

The film starts off with a brief interview with the evolutionary philosopher, Daniel C. Dennett who wrote a book by the same name, Darwin's Dangerous Idea.  He puts forth a most outrageous assertion when he says,"" If I were to give a prize for the single best idea anybody every had, I would give it to Darwin, ahead of Newton and ahead of Einstein"".  Why?  Because, he says, Darwin managed to bridge the world of purposeless, meaningless, matter and motion, on the one hand,  and the world of meaning, purpose and design on the other.  What an erroneous notion, especially to anyone who knows about the history of science and how Newton's laws of motion and law of gravitation are foundational to modern physics and to modern technology.  A very important question to ask is, how has evolutionary theory contributed to the advancement of science or to technological advance.  I am sure that honest inquiry will come up with one number - zero contribution.

Another unfortunate aspect of this film is its prejudice toward Christianity and to Christians, but this should not be a surprise since Darwin was himself thus prejudiced. He said in one place in his writings that the Bible was not to be trusted any more than the writings or utterances of a barbarian.  He also wondered how anyone could wish that Christianity could be true. I should hasten to say that Emma Darwin, a Unitarian, is presented as a true compassionate Christian.  However, the film takes a different view of three other Christians that are portrayed. The three presented are Captain Fitzroy, the naturalist Richard Owen who is famous for coining the word ""dinosaur"", and the physician who attended Darwin's daughter Anna when she was sick and lay dying.  The film portrays  Fitzroy and Owen as being close-minded and intolerant.  The physician is presented as uncompassionate when Darwin is weaping for his daughter.  This is a very biased view of Christians indeed and does not describe Christians that I know and those I have known for over 30 years of being a Christian myself.  One just needs to consider the history of hospitals and to ask, who founded our hospitals?  On the other hand is Russia, the former Soviet Union, and modern-day China where the state religion is atheism and evolution is the only accepted belief system.  Countries like the United States become more and more like these others the more evolutionary theory becomes dominant and freedom of thinking and speech is not allowed (which is happening, please see Ben Stein's DVD: Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed).

Darwin's Dangerous Idea has a rather lengthy segment on how the eye could not possibly have been designed by an intelligent designer; they indicate instead an evolutionary process.  The flaws are apparently two major ones: the eye's photoreceptors point to the back of the eye instead of toward the light source, and the second is that in front of the photoreceptors, blocking some of the light, are blood vessels, nerves and ganglia.  The ignorance of the evolutionist is astonishing on this point (and on many others) and also alarmng when you consider that some publish biology textbooks that are used in many of our public schools.  Here's the real story that the reader is not likely to hear from evolutionists.  The photoreceptors point backwards facing a pigment layer that supplies them with much needed nutrients and oxygen since these structures have a very high metabolic rate.  Also back there is the choroid which cools the photoreceptors and prevents them from overheating.  There is also a black layer comprised of melanin which absorbs extra light and prevents that light from bouncing around inside the eye.  The ganglia and nerves that are placed between the source of light and the photoreceptors are practically transparent and block little light.  And most amazingly this apparatus is pushed aside at a crucial place to allow light a direct path to the foveola and fovea where the cones are at a their highest density.  this is why human vision works so well and images are so sharp.  Man, with all his intelligence and ingenuity,  has not yet been able to make anything approaching the marvel of the human eye.

In one place in the film Emma is talking with Darwin and it is at this point, I believe,  in Darwin's life that he is interested in artificial selection.  (He himself bred pigeons in real life.)  She makes a noteworthy statement when she tells him that he can produce big dogs and little dogs but he cannot produce a dog with feathers. [Today genetics shows us that the genome of an organism is limited in what it can produce.]  She says further that he cannot produce a heart - only God,can.  Emma was quite right.  Evolutionary explanations go no further than explaining the varieties within a species.  When it attempts to go further than this, and it certainly has,  it is over its head and cannot rely on science to support its claims, not from genetics and not from the fossil record or any other area of science.

It was the late evolutionary paleontologist Colin Patterson of the British Museum who asked an assembly of his colleages ""What is one thing we know for sure about evolution"".  He got no reply from all that were assembled.  I believe it was also he that said that evolution is anti-knowledge.  As  a science teacher for 30 years, I quite agree, though evolution has captivated many, it is the the arch enemy of science and scientific progress and the arch enemy of Christ and His Church.",1381017600,2,5689,4.987274655355249
7800457,5,0967733006,This movie is great.  It shows Darwin on his voyage and then goes into details about how he worked through the issues around his theory of Natural Selection.  It shows the social issues that he faced and also goes into personal conversations he might have had with his wife and brother.,1364860800,3,286,4.588235294117647
7800458,5,0967733006,This movie makes Darwin a real person not just a picture of a old man we are all use to you learn his thought emotions and feeling about his theory and life in general.,1305072000,6,168,3.9705882352941178
7800459,5,0967733006,Great video to bring all the ideas about evolution together.  Biology teachers everywhere can benefit by showing their students this.,1268697600,14,133,5.65
7800460,5,0967733006,"Darwin idea of gradual challenge in species is really dangerous for fatalists and those overwhelmed with miraculous responsibility for own mistakes of simply applying biological processes to socio-political development.

Interesting work provides a food for though to struggling for existence especially.",1254009600,2,304,6.414634146341464
7800461,5,0967733006,"I've viewed this video in a library and I really do like it and felt it gave one of the best lay explanations for evolution that I've seen. This is due, of course, to the speaker in it, Stephen Jay Gould, who was, much like Carl Sagan, a scientist who could take dry or complicated subjects and delineate them to an audience in a way that made them both easily understood and entertaining.  I only wish he had attempted what Sagan did and produced a whole tv series of his views, but this video is all we have (though a whole series of books of his Natural History magazine columns are available and they are equally accessible).  I just wish Stanford (where this lecture was filmed) or whoever owns the copyright would release a DVD so the general public could buy it (I don't think even libraries can get it anymore).",1203811200,2,819,4.417218543046357
