1905164,1,B0000ADXG8,"I can't understand what makes this one so good. It's awful! The only thing that makes this one worth watching is the comedy in it, and the gun battle at the end. English actors protraying American cowboys? It was terrible to watch. The only actors that were any good were the regulars and the man who played Doc Holliday. This one is more of a musical than anything, and if that wasn't bad enough, the music and singing in it was terrible. It hurt may ears to listen to it. The only reason why I bought this was because it came in the ""End of the Universe Collection"" which has many good Dr. Who stories in it apart from this one. And I had never seen this one before, and always missed the historicals - especially when it comes to my own country's history. But it's really not worth it. It's a pitty that so many good stories from the 1960s were lost, and yet this one survived. Unless you buy the ""End of the Universe Collection"", which I do recommend, stay as far away from this one as possible.",1233705600,2,999,4.2631578947368425
1905165,1,B0000ADXG8,"Exactly what is it that makes this late First Doctor sojourn in the American West so staggeringly awful?  Mr. Hartnell is no worse than usual (calling Wyatt Earp ""Wurp"" intentionally (which isn't funny), and calling sidekick Stephen ""Steving"" unintentionally (which is); and this time finishing only every third or fourth line with ""hmmm . . .?"" - not too many ""deah boy""s in this outing, either), and the aptly named Dodo and the future host of the fabled ""Blue Peter"" series, surely among the weakest set of companions, are no duller than they usually are, with Peter Purvis even somewhat engaging as a barroom songster, for a few moments at least. So I suppose it's the combination of the ludicrous British ""Wild West"" accents and posturing, the hokey delivery of every cast member except our trio (is this how American productions of Shakespeare sound to English ears?), and the endless intrusions of the obnoxious unseen background quasi-singer (she of the warbly near-approximations of pitch in the wheezy, faux-folk tune and ""authentic"" lyrics that tinnily echo the plot ""developments"" irritatingly every two or three minutes - ""Charlie's got his head blowed in/  Now he's through with rye and gin/ At the Last Chance Saloon, the La - a - ast Chance Salo-o-on"") and harpsichord accompaniment (or whatever that tinkly thing is that's playing - Hungarian cembalom perchance?), that makes this stinker the very worst Doctor Who story I can think of, outdoing even the thrice-dreadful Sylvester McCoy debut, ""Time and the Rani.""  BBC meets Ed Wood.  Don't get me wrong - I usually enjoy the First Doctor very much, because of (rather than despite) his fluffed lines and small repertoire of predictable ""characterizing"" points (holding his lapels, rocking on his heels, etc. etc.) - and he created this greatest of great roles, after all.  But this one is nearly unwatchable.  Maybe Brits would enjoy it, as a sort of Englishizing of the Wild West.  The rest of us probably won't.  See it only if you manage to survive ""Web Planet.""  But be warned: like it or not, you'll be hearing that insipid tune all night - ""The Last Chance Saloon - the La-a-a-st Chance Saloo-oon!""",1169856000,3,2173,4.947802197802198
1905166,3,B0000ADXG8,"The title of this set of Episodes should be ""Carry On Clantons"".
Yes, this is the worst Dr. Who episode ever. That makes it an absolute must-have for serious Dr. Who collectors. The entire episode is played for laughs, and probably seems funnier to a British viewer than to an American. Listen closely to the lyrics of the background ballad - it's a ""bang on"" parody of 50's America western background ballads (think ""High Noon"" or ""Gunfight at the OK Corral""). The cowboys with British accents are hilarious.
ON the downside, there is very little actual conflict or suspense in the story line, and too many of the jokes are predictable or downright lame, at least to an American sense of humor. But for the Dr. Who enthusiast, it's worth at least one viewing.",1070582400,7,760,4.67910447761194
1905167,5,B0000ADXG8,"""So fill up your glasses/And join in the song/The Law's right behind you/And it won't take long./So come, you coyotes,/And howl at the moon/Till there's blood upon the sawdust/In ""The Last Chance"" Saloon.""
From 25-26 October, 1881, in Tombstone, Arizona, that's what the Doctor, Dodo, and Steven take-kind of.  Once they find out where they are, the Doctor's two companions are delighted and get geared up.  Steven has always wanted to be a cowboy, but has a loud white shirt that really begs for the fashion police to arrest him.  Dodo's white shirt and long brown skirt are sensible yet stylish.
The three take aliases, Dr. Caligari, Steven Regret, a singer, and Dodo Dupont, a piano player.  Steven hates his alias, only to be remonstrated by the Doctor.  ""Tell them you're from outer space and you'll be arrested on a vagrancy charge.""  Dodo does get into the spirit of the scene more.  When asked by Charlie the bartender if she's a piano player, she says, ""Darn tootin'"" in an American accent.  She does play some tunes at the Last Chance Saloon, and Steven does sing the giddy title ballad, whose verses are sung throughout the story by Lynda Baron.  Examples:  ""It's your last chance of boozin'/where there's no one to find/it's your last chance of losin'/and the first place you find/it's your last chance of earning/your gunfighter's fee/the pay is in dollars/but the bullets are free.""  or ""So pick him up gentle/and carry him so/he's gone kind of mental, from Earp's heavy blow.""
The Doctor has a toothache and guess who the local dentist happens to be?  Doc Holliday, and it's the latter's machinations, such as ostensibly loaning the Doctor his gun, marked personally, to make him more spiffy that causes a case of mistaken identity, as the Clanton Brothers think the Time Lord is Doc Holliday.  As Doc had recently killed their brother Reuben, they're out to even the score. ""Good thing I didn't have my tonsils out,"" the Doctor mutters as he leaves the surgery.  That's the least of his troubles, as this case of mistaken identity leads to Wyatt Earp arresting the Doctor and keeping him in jail to protect him from the Clantons.  More than that, Pa Clanton hires the deadly and menacing Johnny Ringo, ace gunfighter, who too has a score to settle with Holliday, and was also the former sweetheart of Holliday's wife, Kate Elder.
The Doctor is annoyed at Earp and Bat Masterson, and wants to get out of here, but the two lawmen are actually instrumental in keeping him alive, particularly from a lynching from the townfolk.  John Alderson (Earp) and Richard Beale (Masterson) do great performances, BTW.
And at least Jackie Lane (Dodo) seems to be enjoying herself.  Sheena Marshe plays Kate Elder as a brassy Mae West-ish manner, but Anthony Jacbos as Doc Holliday is a delight, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye, a big difference from that of Victor Mature.  Laurence Payne (Ringo) came out in two Who stories, in The Leisure Hive as Morix and The Two Doctors as Dastari.
Clearly, the historicity of this is based more on popular myth and the Hollywood treatment Tombstone has been given.  For example, Johnny Ringo survived the OK Corral, as he died on 14 July 1882.  Because the viewer ratings on this were so low (at that time in the show's history, anyway), writer Donald Cotton's association with Doctor Who came to a quick end--he was never commissioned to write anything again.  But other stories have had worse ratings, and this one, mostly played for laughs, is a novelty tale, so thank you, Donald Cotton.  Some of the American accents are questionable, but it's all done in fun.
""So beware all you cowboys/Who's a-yearning' to sin/If the Earps is the lawmen/You ain't gonna win.""",1067126400,7,3712,4.8125984251968505

1905185,5,B0000ADXG8,"I live in Arizona and I have been to Tombstone ""The town to tough to die.""

I think ""The Gunfighters"" is a more legitimate attempt at the western genre than several other shows I've seen. The script is rife with western clichs, and lets the audience know its ok to enjoy them. I found the ""Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon"" a hilarious exclamation mark to a story that is so often over told that I am sure you could hear it discussed by natives deep in the African jungle that have never seen a white man

Holiday's dialog is often clever, with many funny exchanges. (Clanton: ""I never figured you for a back-shooter, Holiday."" Holiday: ""I never figured you for any kind of shooter."") Holiday was a noted smart aleck and this story reflects that.

As I have mentioned in other reviews this was filmed in the 60's and for that time the sets are fantastic.  If you watch most westerns filmed around this time they all take place on one set.  Dr Who gets a new set every week and they had a very limited budget.

""The Gunfighters"" includes a great documentary on William Hartnell's third season that's full of juicy behind-the-scenes gossip. Another featurette covers Doctor Who in its early days and there's an audio commentary track featuring several enthusiastic members of the production team.",1377129600,2,1294,4.6535087719298245
1905186,5,B0000ADXG8,"Gunfighters has always been one of my favorite Doctor Who stories, despite, or more accurately because of, the terrible acting and that horrible song that is repeated a million times throughout the story.

Linda Baron sings the song (the ""Kate"" lipsyncs to); can you name the Peter Davison story Baron actually appeared in ""in person"" ... hint: think sailing ships in space ...",1374278400,,459,4.871794871794871
1905187,3,B0000ADXG8,"This is one of the best Dr. Who stories. It's camp, but unlike so much of the later years, the actors are playing their roles perfectly. The accents and characterizations are silly and stylized, but that doesn't affect the production values, which, as assistant de Vere Cole notes in the commentary, are very good. I especially like the many verses of the theme written for this story. As someone who knows the old American West and sang some of those kinds of songs as a child, the songwriter has done a credible job of imitating authentic period music.

The short special extra ""The End of the Line"" is absolutely a must-see for Dr. Who fans. It reveals a great deal of what happened as the first Doctor was phased out.

What's annoying is the BBC's idea that they have a right to force several minutes of commercials on you before the main menu. I shouldn't have to pay for advertising, some of which, to add insult to injury, is repetitive, amateur, and boring. BBC? In a larger context this would be grounds for a class action suit.

1905191,3,B0000ADXG8,"A Season 3 episode set between The Celestial Toymaker and The Savages, starring William Hartnell as the First Doctor with Dodo (Jackie Lane) and Steven (Peter Purves).

For the first-time viewer, the setup of the Doctor Who series is basic enough: the Doctor is an alien who adventures in time and space in his TARDIS, usually with a human companion or two.  I don't think you need to have seen the series before to enjoy The Gunfighters, but you do need to bear in mind that this is a small budget series made in the late 60s with the concomitant production issues.  In other words, don't expect too much and you may be pleasantly surprised.  Or not.

The TARDIS arrives in Tombstone just in time for the gunfight at the OK Corral.  But will the machinations of Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp harm or help the Doctor and his friends?

I suppose this struck me first and foremost as an example of how much Doctor Who has changed over the years.  I was surprised at how nave the Doctor was in this story and how overshadowed he was by the other characters, but his devotion to his travelling companions and his commitment to non-violence were as expected.  This was the first time I'd seen Dodo or Steven, and I've got nothing to complain about with them.  I liked their spirit, their sense of fun, and the contribution they made to the action.  Overall this is a fun adventure, but it's a Western in which the Doctor makes an appearance rather than a story about the Doctor.  This struck me as atypical of the other First Doctor episodes I've seen.

It's Doc Holliday (Anthony Jacobs) who dominates this story.  As portrayed here, he's a manipulative, cold-blooded killer with a soft streak, a self-proclaimed gentleman who puts such pretensions aside when it suits him.  Wyatt Earp (John Alderson) also makes a strong showing, balancing his duty as a lawman with his loyalties to family and friends.  Kate (Sheena Marshe) has plenty of screen time as Holliday's fiance and strikes a decent balance between independence and devotion to her man, but she's not the most sympathetic character.  Subsequent research showed me that the historical elements of this story aren't especially accurate; purists might object to this.

The Gunfighters has a clever premise and a well-constructed script.  Considering the production limitations of the period it's quite imaginatively shot and the sets and costumes are decent, though some of the guest cast leave a lot to be desired.  The ""Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon"" is a linking device that refreshes the viewer's memory and helps establish the period feel, though you may get pretty sick of it after a while.  If this episode suffers from anything, it's a lack of extras.  The streets and saloons of Tombstone are largely deserted, which doesn't feel at all realistic.  Someone should remake this with the production input the script deserves.

No comment on the DVD extras.

William Hartnell really seems to be enjoying himself and is in fine form, there are some tongue-in-cheek, laughable moments (seriously, some scenes are *meant* to poke a little fun at typical Western movies) and there are some great extras included; such as a behind-the-scenes look at the show, as well as the pop-up info that I always enjoy.",1328400000,2,659,4.576271186440678
1905196,3,B0000ADXG8,"It's easy to jeer at this early Doctor Who story set in the Wild West. Americans forget that shooting a western is easy only if you happen to live in the American West. Just drive a few miles out of almost any town in California, for instance, and you're there (this is why Hollywood is in California, not New Jersey). Guess where location shooting was done for most of the Have Gun Will Travel series: would you believe rural Oregon? But try shooting a western in London. You'll end up taping the whole thing inside a cramped TV studio.

""The Gunfighters"" does a pretty amazing job pulling this off, with one caveat: The actors (all drawn from the U.K. and Canada) can't speak in a convincing western accent to save their lives. Many sound like cowboys from Australia. Peter Purves (Steven) is particularly bad in the dialect department, just as he was in the earlier Doctor Who story ""The Chase,"" where he plays a hick American tourist visiting the Empire State Building. Other than problems with dialogue, though, ""The Gunfighters"" is a minor marvel from a production standpoint. The show's ratings were terrible, but that was because westerns from America had already filled the U.K.'s airwaves for years and British audiences were simply growing weary of them.

The story was shot in Ealing Studios and at BBC Television Centre 4 in Shepherd's Bush with a mind-boggling six cameras. Doctor Who was shot ""live to tape"" during this period, which meant cameras and actors had to move between sets as each episode was taped in near real time like a stage play (if an actor didn't have time to move to the next set before the next scene, the crew had to take a taping break). Turn on the production notes and you'll see some of the problems this caused: cameras inadvertently reflected in windows and saloon mirrors; one camera jiggling as another camera passed behind it; and, of course, actors fluffing lines that further muddle the story but can't be reshot because there simply wasn't time.

The production notes also help viewers separate historical fact from TV fiction as ""The Gunfighters"" revisits one of the most mythologized events in U.S. history: the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The Doctor, Steven and Dodo arrive in Tombstone, Arizona, in 1881 in search of a dentist to treat the Doctor for toothache. So ""the Doc,"" who is on ""holiday"" to get a tooth pulled, is soon mistaken for the town dentist, Doc Holliday, a notorious gunfighter and friend of Wyatt Earp. The Clanton gang is gunning for Holliday, and the story injects another gunfighter with a grudge, Johnny Ringo, although he and Holliday wouldn't shoot it out until months after the historic fracas at the O.K. Corral. This infamous gunfight, involving the Earps, Holliday and the Clantons, has been recounted inaccurately so many times in books, movies and television (even Star Trek!) that no fallacies Doctor Who could possibly add would make any difference. As it is, the gunfight is re-created here with the usual mixture of unsubstantiated speculation and outright errors, but so what.

Be sure to check out the Special Features menu for a fascinating 45-minute documentary on the decline of William Hartnell as the First Doctor and his eventual replacement by Patrick Troughton. Steven and Dodo (Jackie Lane) were also soon written out of the series after ""The Gunfighters"" and replaced by Ben and Polly (Michael Craze and Anneke Wills), new companions who would take the series into the swinging '60s. A less-interesting, 15-minute feature on press coverage Doctor Who received during the William Hartnell years is narrated by Mary Tamm.",1322438400,5,3619,4.918166939443535
1905197,1,B0000ADXG8,"Wow!  What a piece of crap.  The script is flat, the acting is unbelievably horrid (oh the accents!), and the ""Last Chance"" song is like a lingering fart in the room that just won't go away (in episode 2 even the characters are complaining how they want a different song).  As usual, the writers didn't know what to do with Dodo, but she is particularly lame here.  She must have Stockholm Syndrome, because she's doing her captor's hair and runs after them after they leave her to herself.  Character's actions are absurd, but not in a particularly entertaining way, rather they just kind of do stuff because the writers need something to happen.

I'm a big Doctor Who fan, and there is no way that I would have made it to the end of this without feeling a strange urge to see every Who episode.  That said, it isn't the worst (that's Delta and the Bannerman), but it might make my bottom 10 and those bottom 10 are stiff competition.",1320278400,6,935,4.464705882352941

1905200,4,B0000ADXG8,"I've never understood why Doctor Who fans hate ""The Gunfighters"" so much. Years ago, I read a ton of negative fan reviews, which tended to judge this story as a laughably poor attempt at drama. More recently, a growing number of fans have acknowledged that ""The Gunfighters"" is supposed to be a comedy, not a drama; yet they still tend to laugh *at* the story, rather than *with* it. Well, for what it's worth, I laugh with it.

To be more specific: I find ""The Gunfighters"" to be a legitimately witty spoof of the American Western genre. Donald Cotton's script purposefully indulges in a host of Western cliches, and then ""winks"" at the audience about this. The much-loathed ""Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon"" - a narrative song that runs through the whole story - is used to highlight the silliness and cliched nature of the action, and thus doesn't bother me at all. (Indeed, strange lines like ""he's gone a bit mental under Earp's heavy blow"" always give me a chuckle.)

Cotton's dialog is often clever, with many funny exchanges. (Clanton: ""I never figured you for a back-shooter, Ringo."" Ringo: ""I never figured you for any kind of shooter."") The guest actors are often criticized for their silly American accents, but I find them to be no more or less phony than the American accents I hear on British TV today; and silly accent or no, Anthony Jacobs makes a super-cool Doc Holliday.

Fans also often mock the sets in this production, but this strikes me as a strange criticism too, because they're good by the standards of 1960s Doctor Who. Indeed, I like period sets such as the interior of Holliday's dental practice much more than the bland white corridors featured in so many Doctor Who episodes. Of course, the sets aren't good enough to convince me that ""The Gunfighters"" was filmed on location in Tombstone, but that's okay; I thought the new Harry Potter movie looked obviously studio-bound, too. :-)

In short, this is an underrated serial, though its appeal is clearly limited to those who respond well to its peculiar sense of humor. Surprisingly - considering that it's so hated - ""The Gunfighters"" gets a pretty nice DVD package, which includes a great documentary on William Hartnell's third season that's full of juicy behind-the-scenes gossip. Another featurette covers (mostly hostile) press reaction to Doctor Who in its early days. Neither of these features deals much with the production of ""The Gunfighters,"" specifically, so fortunately there's an audio commentary track featuring several enthusiastic members of the production team. Overall, I'd say both the serial and the DVD get 4 out of 5 stars, making them equal partners in awesomeness.",1311120000,24,2673,4.907079646017699
1905201,4,B0000ADXG8,"Many Doctor Who fans have somewhat less than fond memories of ""The Gunfighters,"" a First Doctor serial that aired from April 30 - May 21, 1966. I hadn't seen it until this DVD was released, but I'd heard about it long before from people who really disliked it.

 I am therefore happy to report that it's actually pretty decent! Not great, by any means. It's not even ""Great for a First Doctor story"" or ""Great for a historical"". But it is acceptable and it is enjoyable.

 The plot concerns the Doctor, Steven and Dodo arriving in Tombstone, Arizona, in 1881 just a day or two before the infamous Gunfight at the OK Corral. When they arrive the Doctor is complaining of a toothache. Naturally with access to dentists everywhere in space and time he decides to go with Doc Holliday in the Old West. The fact that appears as a viable option may be commentary on the state of British dentistry in the 1960s...

 Almost as soon as the TARDIS trio set foot outside the stable where they've landed, they're accosted by Sheriff Wyatt Earp, who warns them about the place and offers them his protection. They then split up, with the Doctor looking for Doc Holliday while Steven and Dodo pretend to be vaudeville stars (yes, you read that right).

 While this is going on, Ike Clanton and his gang are preparing for trouble, planning to corner and kill Doc Holliday as part of their sinister plan to do... I don't know what, really, but it's all quite exciting! Holliday gets wind of this and, after treating the Doctor, dresses him to look like Holliday himself. Before long the troubles build up, the Doctor gets arrested (for his own safety), Steven nearly gets shot, Dodo gets taken hostage and through it all there's singing. Endless singing.

 I was somewhat surprised at how enjoyable this story is. It's nicely paced, well-acted (especially once you get past the attempted American accents in part one), and establishes the Doctor's very strong dislike of guns in no uncertain terms. The sets were also really good and the whole thing was nicely atmospheric, and a little more adult than the show usually was.

 On the other hand, there's the historical accuracy, which is minimal. Even worse, though, there's... that song... ""The Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon"". It's not horrible, but it is constant. Every three minutes or so you hear a line or two from it, and that's not an exaggeration. It's an ok song, but not so good that I want to hear it endlessly.

 As usual with the old series DVDs, there's more extras here than you can shake a Colt .45 at (sorry, sorry...)! You get the expected commentary with actors Peter Purves (Steven), Shane Rimmer (Seth Harper), David Graham (Charlie), and Richard Beale (Bat Masterson), and production assistant Tristian de Vere Cole, all moderated by Toby Hadoke, best known for ""Moths Ate my Doctor Who Scarf.""

 Additionally you get the First Doctor version of ""Tomorrow's Times,"" a new series on the discs that shows contemporary media coverage of the program, with this version hosted by Mary Tamm (Romana I). You also get a photo gallery, PDF materials and an excellent documentary called ""The End of the Line."" It talks about the problems the series had during its third year, and includes interviews with Purves as well some of the other actors, including Maureen O'Brien (Vicki). And for people like me, who've always wondered, you get some insight into why Jackie Lane left the series (short version: she didn't look young enough on camera and was written out while her first serial was still airing).

 The Gunfight at the OK Corral has made its way into Western mythology like almost nothing else, and that's a surprise considering just how short it was. The whole thing lasted only 30 seconds, but from that we've gotten this story, the third-season Star Trek episode ""Spectre of the Gun,"" and numerous movies and books. It's really quite amazing the industry it spawned.

 Ultimately I recommend this disc, but really only for the fans. If you've got someone you're trying to get interested in the series, there's probably better choices. But for what this is, it's pretty decent and far better than the detractors would have you believe.",1310947200,3,4194,4.7745504840940525
1905202,3,B0000ADXG8,"""The Gunfighters"" was long considered the absolute worst episode of Doctor Who (unfortunately, some of Sylvester McCoy's early episodes are contenders), so it's in some ways sad that this series of episodes still exist while so many better ones are seemingly lost forever.  For many, though, it's so bad it's good (as in ""unintentionally hilarious"").  The accents are simply awful, but the really painful part is the warbling saloon ballad that runs through the episodes.  And, for me, the character Dodo.

However, it's good to see it released for completeness' sake and for the solid bonus documentary on the series' third season.  For the casual Whovian, it's a pass, but for the fan, well, you just have to see it to believe it.  :)",1310428800,2,736,4.895161290322581
1905203,4,B0000ADXG8,"Note: My Original review was based upon seeing the episode from downloaded copies. Since I have done as I said I would (watch the DVD with sound on), I will update the review, since it needs it. (I've even changed it from 3 to 4 stars.)

I agree with the other reviewers about the singing on this episode. I've heard cat fights that were more melodious. (Another reviewer 'kindly' called it caterwauling.) ***UPDATE: One of two things happened, either they autotuned the singing, or sound on the copies I'd seen had been affected one way or another. While a tad monotonous, Lynda's singing is definitely not caterwauling and hence distracts less from the story.

If you're anything less than complete fanatic of the show (like me) you're better off giving this one a miss. ***UPDATE: While still not the first choice for a novice fan, it should be seen sooner rather than later. BUT DON'T WATCH THE DOWNLOADED COPIES, WATCH THE DVD!

If you're a die-hard fan (like me), this will put your loyalties to the test. (Oh, why did they keep this one?? Why couldn't they have kept Tenth Planet, ep. 4 and wiped this one? Why couldn't they have kept Celestial Toymaker, ep. 1-3 and wiped this one? Etc.) ***UPDATE: OK, OK, I'd still trade a complete ""Tenth Planet"" or ""Celestial Toymaker"" for this one. I guess I'm a bad man.

Beatles fans will relate this way: For ""Doctor Who"" this is ""Two Virgins""--and yes, I've *have* listened to that. ***UPDATE: Strike this whole paragraph.

Have I trashed it enough? Good. I'm still buying it!

Why????
1. Because of the extras. I look forward to those more than story sometimes. I've seen all there is to see of the stories (unless they find any more). This is new old material. ***UPDATE: Very good stuff, but more for serious fans of the show.
2. Because of the factoids. Okay they're not called that, but the subtitles that tell facts about the show as it plays. I love reading those. (Ok, this one will be with the sound down--way down.)
3. Because if I didn't, it would be a hole in my collection.
4. Because ""Doctor Who"" suffered the loss of so many episodes, even the worst deserve the care of the restoration, so yes, I'll still watch it--with the sound on!

1905208,3,B0000ADXG8,"""The Gunfighters"" is hardly one of William Hartnell's best ""Doctor Who"" stories. In fact, this story, in which the Doctor (Hartnell), Steven (Peter Purves) and Dodo (Jackie Lane) get mixed up in the legendary Gunfight At The OK Corral, had the reputation for many years as being the all-time worst ""Doctor Who"" story ever made! It's horribly acted (with the exception of the three leads), with several supporting actors doing horrible American accents (or not even trying to), the script is poorly written, the direction is misguided, and the big final gunfight is horribly staged (all that shooting at each other at close range and *missing*---pathetic!). And then there's that annoying song about The Last Chance Saloon that plays over and over and over and OVER again throughout the whole damm story!

But the one saving grace of ""The Gunfighters"" is that it's funny, even if most of the laughs are unintentional. Hartnell and Purves are both a hoot in this one---the Doctor and his amusing toothache problem, and Steven hilariously being forced to sing ""The Last Chance Saloon"" song at gunpoint---and, of course, the mistakes I've mentioned above. And, to it's credit, the story never commits the crime of being boring. ""The Gunfighters"" is a trainwreck, but at least it's a funny, entertaining trainwreck. A masterpiece it ain't, but, in it's own very strange, very goofball way, ""The Gunfighters"" still manages to be fun. In short, it's the best bad ""Doctor Who"" story ever made.

It unfolds pretty much in the typical style, where Doctor and company land shortly before the showdown, and exit a little while after. The one thing that truly stands out for me is how the townspeople, all played by British actors, try--and sometimes fail mid-sentence--to talk with a Western accent; it's so horrible it's hilarious! (In fairness, though, my attempts at a British accent are just as bad or worse.)

Also, here's a fun fact: The REAL gunfight at OK corral actually took place down the street!",1495584000,,600,4.825242718446602
7996785,4,B0000ADXG8,"Alot of people loathe this story and it is definitely credited for being the low point rating wise of the Hartnell era. Compared to some of what follows in the span of the next 23 years, this is like high art in the Dr Who canon but in context, it's not much loved.

The criticisms. 1. Dodo is probably the most maligned Dr Who companion character of all time. I don't know why, I don't get it, but there it is. Dodo doesn't get much respect and she is in her 3rd story with The Gunfighters. The trio of Steve, Dodo and the Doctor started with The Ark, carried on to the Celestial Toymaker and then to the old west. This is Dodo's only long storyline and maybe that's why so many 'fans' don't like it.

2. The mix of genres. If you want Sci Fi and monsters you'll get that more in the 2nd Doctor stories. If you want history, you'll get that (alot) with the 1st Doctor stories. Venturing into the American west in the late 19th century must have seemed natural for the producers but unlike others, an entire genre of popular television entertainment isn't devoted to other history stories. I never saw a fleet of TV shows made covering the various characters during the French Wars of Religion in the 16th century. This must have rubbed people wrong at the time and I can understand how that continues to be an issue. The other history stories interwoven the Doctor and his companions into the story well, and they did it well again here in my view. Doc Holiday uses the Doctor as a stooge hoping he'd bare the wrath of the Clanton brothers. That sets the stage of events to follow.

3. Maybe the British doing American figures in history works about as well as Americans portraying prominent British figures. I however enjoyed seeing this because I can easily imagine the actors enjoying themselves. Laurence Payne is excellent as Johnny Ringo. He seems to really get into the role.

4. The singing interludes. Lynda Baron has a lovely voice but why does she or anyone have to sing the scenes we just saw? That is something I don't remember seeing in too many western shows. There was usually just cheesy suspense music.

What I liked about the Gunfighters was that to me, it was a typical Dr Who story. The basic formula in every Dr Who serial is, the Doctor and his companions land somewhere, they immediately get knee deep into trouble, find themselves separated much of the time as the plot and suspense thickens and ultimately things seem to about to boil over when the Doctor and his companions turn it all around. Granted, there are no great cataclysms threatening the universe in this story but there wasn't in the Celestial Toymaker, or the Savages either.

For history, it is not entirely accurate. Johnny Ringo survived the OK Corral and may not have even been involved in it as it turns out.  None of the Earp brothers died before the OK Corral. There were other reasons why the gunfight was fated to take place. It wasn't Wyatt Earp out to get revenge. If you know these things and know how the Doctor can't change history, but observe it and if he gets entangled in it, wriggle out without altering it, then these things may bother a serious Whovian. The earliest Doctor stories felt they had to stress this point hard because of the amount of history stories. Alot of fans msut have been wondering why the Doctor didn't prevent disasters instead of watch them unfold as powerless as those who know nothing of their fates.

The Gunfighters is certainly not where I would start with the 1st Doctor. It's a tragedy that The Dalek's Master Plan, The Massacre and The Savages are mostly if not entirely lost and this story remains of the Dr and Steven era. In comparison to those, this story is weak, but it is still worth it if only to hear Steven sing under distress for the Clanton's",1488758400,,3797,4.516739446870451
7996786,4,B0000ADXG8,"The Gunfighters has been an oft-maligned story for years. The premise is bizarre: Doctor Who as a Musical Western Comedy Drama with the events leading up to the Gun Fight at the OK Corral.

I was surprised to find it was very well-done. Well, there are a few dubious accents, most were as plausible as accents you'd see on American television at the time. The first two episodes were played more for comedy and there were very well done with some hilarious moments. The final episode in particular is more dramatic and despite being a bit over-the-top by today's standards, it'd stand up against most Westerns being made in America at the time.

While Steven has a couple off, this is one of William Hartnell's best performances as the Doctor. He's obviously enjoying the story which makes it even that more pleasurable to watch. Dodo is also far better than usual in this. The guest cast is also generally strong, with special plaudits going to Anthony Jacobs as Doc Holiday. He makes every scene he's in so much better.

For a soundstage Western, everything looks superb. The direction is great as all the key scenes look authentic. Most importantly, the gun fight is very well staged.

Even the maligned musical number works, as it gives the story some Western atmosphere. Of course, it's  a bit of an ear worm and it's odd that there's only one song across all four episodes, a fact the series mocks at the start of Episode 2 in a very self-aware story.
