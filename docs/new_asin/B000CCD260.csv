8097335,4,B000CCD260,"This doesn't have as much newsreel footage of the Panther as I'd like to see. However This is still a good resource for destroyed allied armour for military modelers. I have the Tiger, Pzkw 1&2,  Stug III&IV and Pzkw IV. I would rate all of those above this one but it's still worth having.",1472860800,,290,4.37037037037037
8097336,3,B000CCD260,"A disappointment. A gloss, at best. Whoever put this together spent little or no time on research re the Panther. To paraphrase the saying goes, don't judge this DVD by its cover--your expectations will crash and burn.",1437868800,,218,4.918918918918919
8097337,4,B000CCD260,"You will see actual combat newsreel footage, mostly from German, but also from Western and Soviet combat cameras.

It seems a lot longer than its 52 minutes, due to the concentration of material. It is really packed.

The Panther, according to many, was the best tank of World War II. This program is a comprehensive examination of the need for, the production, and the employment of that tank on all fronts. It is more personal than others in this series, with a different narrator.

The footage of the early T34s is truly impressive. You will see the multiturreted T35 Soviet Land Battleship, and good images of the KV1 and KV2, with its 150 mm howitzer. You will see the 5th SS Panzer Viking Division, late 1944, knocking out Soviet J 52s.

In the West, Shermans, Cromwells, and Churchills were all easy targets at a thousand yards to the high velocity 75 mm gun of the Panther.

The vulnerability of Allied tanks to the Panther and Tiger nearly became a political scandal. You will see the Jadg Panther with 88 mm cannon. Only 392 were produced. Two of those knocked out 10 Churchills in a few minutes in Normandy in July 1944.

Watch for the Volkswagen Schwimmwagens and the VW Kubelwagen (in the 1970s, the Thing).

Armor is shown in action in February March 1945 in Hungary, as an SS Panzer unit counterattacks a Soviet advance. The Battle of the Bulge is included, but not scenes I`d seen before.

The program ends with Koniev`s and Zhukhov`s capture of Berlin, showing all varieties of Soviet and German armor.",1369008000,,1519,4.684210526315789
8097338,2,B000CCD260,"The main complaint a viewer would have of this video is that there is not enough footage of the Panther itself. Fully 25% of the video in this dvd covers Barbarosa. In some respect some pre-Panther DVD would be needed relating to how the Panther came about (i.e., in response to larger Soviet tanks met in Barbarosa, especially the T-34). Even overlooking this, there is still not enough footage in this dvd to justify the attention or time of someone really interested in footage of this video. With respect to informational content this DVD, like most of the ""War Archives"" series of DVDs, is quite rudimentary. For even a novice, the information is quite basic. Only for someone with no or almost no knowledge of the vehicle would any of the facts presented in this video really have anything new to say. In the same amount of time as the video (about 1 hour), one could read one of the Osprey series of books on the Panther. Although these do not present any in-depth information regarding the vehicle, the information presented is certainty more than in this DVD.",1260316800,4,1068,4.6861702127659575
8097339,1,B000CCD260,"You're better off purchasing ""Panzer - Germany's Ultimate War Machine"". It has much more interesting footage. There is very little detail in this Panther title. Much of the dvd is devoted to the opening stages of Barbarossa & very little on the Panther itself. What little detail there is consists of mostly still photos & frequently reproduced footage. Nothing new or interesting here...",1231545600,10,388,5.174603174603175
8097340,3,B000CCD260,"This disc in the series covers the Panther but the video actually provides very little detail about the Panther itself, providing only a cursory overview of the history of why the Panther was developed in a hurry and a very sketchy outline of the course of the war with video of primarily of Panthers as they make vague references to the part played by the Panther.  There is very little detail on the actual development history, design and performance and nothing of significance on actual engagements.

Overall a disappointment, especially compared to some of the others in the series,particularly the discs on the armored cars and the artillery.",1174608000,13,648,4.9907407407407405
