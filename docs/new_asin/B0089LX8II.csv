5141004,4,B0089LX8II,"expatriate: Residing in a different country while maintaining citizenship of your native homeland.

An enjoyable high octane action flick utilizing a cookie-cutter screenplay. Yes, it is a formula product, but surprisingly even productions that rip from the blueprint often screw up. Having been able to, at the very least, overcome the astounding amount of inane and worthless flicks that populate the cinematic landscape nowadays is in itself a success. This tracked true to the recipe, so I would categorize it as very solid.

Preface caveat: Aaron Eckart is one of those performers that I seemingly cannot connect with on any level. He has all the hallmarks of a quality actor - projection, presence, and personality. Yet for all those talents - I can't seem to find common ground. And I honestly can't explain why.

That said, I found his performance in this production surprisingly engaging and quite entertaining. Hopefully it's a trend.

In 'Expatriate' he plays Ben Logan, tech security specialist. Hired by a global security company for his expertise - breaking into previously thought of unhackable systems - exposing vulnerabilities, weaknesses and flaws in their product lines.

To showcase his level of commitment to the company, Ben chooses to stay overseas in order to work at the Belgian offices of the corporation. Along with him is his young daughter Amy, although she isn't nearly as pleased with her new status as an expatriate. But the death of her mother back in the states left no other choice. Having had little contact with her father since birth, the incongruent pair are just now learning to adjust to one another; her dad's comfortable paycheck acting as a stable platform for their fresh start, making the transition bearable.

Until the day that his company literally disappears.

Everyone he knew is gone. The office he has been going to daily for the past six months is stripped bare, his fellow employees vanished. Everything a modern person uses to define a life no longer exists for Logan - no bank account, no money, no digital records, no identification, nothing. Not even his cell phone, which is company property, works anymore. His existence has been erased.

Just what's going on?

As father and daughter are caught up in a bizarre and terrifying world of espionage and twisted corporate shadows, they're forced on the run. With little or no break, they have to stay one step in front of professional assassins and various spy agencies looking to put them into a set of anonymous graves.

There were some weaknesses in the film that have to be acknowledged.

Young co-star Liana Liberato's character as Amy was often artificially too self-aware. For someone who projected typical adolescent immaturity at the beginning of the film, to then flip a switch and become a strong and emotionally composed character - i.e. The driving sequence/interrogation - was ridiculous. And certain aspects of the script rang false; particularly when the intelligence officers gather to discuss the true situation of Ben Logan.

Still, those minor criticisms were mostly forgivable when balanced out with the enjoyable heart-thumping pace of the movie.

Overall, you'll enjoy this if you can imagine Jason Bourne with a kid.",1361577600,,3248,5.1056603773584905

5141007,4,B0089LX8II,"Ben Logan (Aaron Eckhart) works for a security testing company in Belgium.  His teen daughter, Amy (Liana Liberato)attends high school. One day when Ben goes to work he finds out his company is missing and never existed.

Being a former CIA agent, Ben investigates. He ends up on the lam battling the CIA, authorities, and a corporation that all want him and his daughter dead. Amy quickly goes from a snarky teen to Internet sleuth.

The film consists of a lot of double agents. The twists are shown to the audience which takes away from any mystery aspect. It is the ""Bourne"" type of film with one man against the system. This one has the addition of a daughter.

This is a fairly decent film for those who like the ""Bourne"" type of film, especially if your thirst was not satisfied with that latest 4th ""Bourne"" installment.",1354320000,95,827,4.605442176870748
5141008,4,B0089LX8II,Aaron Eckhart is excellent and the story line very good. The writers dialogue for the teenage daughter was annoying at best.

5141013,2,B0089LX8II,"If I were to rate this movie without being prejudiced by the anime, I would probably give it a 4 out of 5, and actually the movie gives more honor to the japanese name ""The town where I am only missing""  than probably the anime. The reason why I rated it so low was because the story was a deviation of the original anime, which by the way deviates from the manga; but the conclusion is really unsatisfactory, unlike the anime or the manga because in them the culprit is cleverly caught, while the way the culprit is caught in the movie is... well... idiotic in my opinion.

Anyways, if you haven't seen the anime or read the manga I would suggest it because the whole concept of going back to time is usually appealing but don't expect too much for the ending",1507161600,,760,4.3076923076923075

As a whiney, spoiled, self-centered, unaware, bratty teen-age the acting was very good; as a character the viewer wants her gone and gone soon.

5141214,4,B0089LX8II,"Good escape movie.  I found the daughter role to be super annoying almost to the point where I wish she'd stuck to her schedule and actually gone home that night.  (If you haven't seen the movie, I'll catch you up: had she gone home that night, she'd be daid.  Yes, I spelled that right.  Say it allowed.  Rhymes with ""said'.)  That's it.  That's my full review, other than I enjoyed it and wish that I was as fit, smart, and good looking as the male lead, but I guess that is what he's paid for.  Me?  I am paid to live a cubical life and, sometimes, with a free moment or two, I'll shoot off a review of sorts.  Should Hollywood ever need a pastey white out of shape guy with an eight head to star in a film of senseless intrigue, I'll be ready.  But fair warning: I sweat a s***load and will never look as good as anyone in this movie no matter how much time I spend in Makeup.  Sheet, man.  If Harry Freaking Potter was there with his wand and yelled ""Makeup-TORRIOUS!"" at the top of his lungs and pointed the wand my way, there might be a big explosion, sure, but I'd end up looking more like Carrot Top than Brad Pit.  C'est la vie.  This movie is a worthwhile way to spend your time if you want to get away from someone at home who is yelling at you.  Good times.",1454544000,2,1270,4.080971659919029

What I did not enjoy was listening to his daughter whine and act like a baby.  I understand she lost her mother (would not wish that on anyone) and that she was moved to another country.  However, when the person that is trying to keep you alive, especially if that person is a parent with some skills, maybe showing a little more respect and a little less indignation might be on the agenda.  I am tired of watching movies that show kids acting and talking to adults, especially their parents, in any type of fashion as if that is acceptable.  (Spoiler Alert) Really, in the middle of a get-away, I am going to drive recklessly, fast as hell down a narrow street almost killing us both because I want my daddy to tell me who that bad, bad lady is... right now!!!  Come on!!!  Yeah, with killers breathing down our necks, now is the time for teenage angst and rebellion.  Again, enjoyed the rental, but, please, no more movies with smart mouth kids on the run with their parents from assassins.  Leave the kid(s) with the grandparents, uncle, aunt or somebody!!!

I gave it 4 stars as the action was pretty good---I would have given it 5 stars, but the plot prevented it.  The story goes that Aaron Eckhart's character is an ex-CIA agent who was clueless about the dubious dealings of the company he's been working at for the past few years.  Now, I have a hard time buying this...if this guy was as well trained as say, a Jason Bourne type, how could he NOT notice stuff about his co-workers??  I mean in 'The Bourne Identity' Jason had the mother-of-all brain-wipes after he was shot in the opening scene---and he spotted little things like a guy at the counter could handle himself in a fight & a bunch of other little things about total strangers.
Yes, I realize this isn't 'The Bourne Identity' but it was the closest movie to compare this one to.
As I said, the action is pretty good---not TOO hoaky as these movies can go. If you can get past the obvious plot hole I mentioned above---its a fairly decent popcorn & chill movie.",1453593600,2,1167,4.44392523364486

The movie has an interesting plot, but it's downfall is the sub-plot concerning the main character's  family. Every time things start to get interesting, the main character's teenage daughter steals the show with her unending whining. Eckhart's character does everything a father could possibly do for a daughter under the circumstances, including risking his life several times for her's, yet she looks at him like he's the villain. The disrespectful snarkiness she shows her father only slows them both down as they run for their lives, and slows down the plot, as well. I also disliked the bit of sexism thrown in at the midway point concerning a female CIA agent whose reputation is marred by who she's slept with. Can't she just be a CIA agent???

5141726,4,B0089LX8II,"Three and a half MYSTERIOUS Stars! ""Erased"" is a European-based spy drama that rushes headlong through Belgium cities and other places. The opening scene is a daring robbery and transfer of the stolen items. Then the scene switches to Aaron Eckhart's character who is leading a normal life as a dad of a teenage daughter and an engineer. But without warning, parts of his identity are wiped out and other disappearances take place as the true creepy plot begins to unfold. His daughter is also drawn into the caper. And the central question is ""why is all of this is taking place"" once the great reveal occurs? But, at least, this is not yet another 'run of the mill' ""save the world from the bad guys as the clock counts down"" plot, although there are lots of shoot outs and it gets gory at times. Beyond this, the acting is very good, but the overall plot could have been better. Starring Aaron Eckhart (The Dark Knight, Battle LA), Olga Kurylenko (Quantum of Solace, Oblivion), Liana Liberato, Yassine Fadel, Garrick Hagon, David Bark-Jones, and Ronnie Commissaris.

- The idea of this movie was good, but the progress of the movie was choppy.  So many questions about the daughter-father relationship should have been explained to help understand why they act the way they do to each other.
- This movie has the horrible 'Hollywood' style effect that you can outrun the cops, by just ducking down an alley, or turning left when the cops all turn right.  Unbelievable that this technique is even still used.

It was ok to watch for free.  I think Eckhart is a much better actor than his character allowed him to be in this film.",1449014400,,401,4.32
5141893,4,B0089LX8II,"Surprisingly good movie overall.

It had a flavor just about half-way between two different Liam Neeson films: the pace and one-man-against-the-world action from ""Taken"" and the lost identity of ""Unknown."" So, I saw it as somewhat derivative. However, the movie business is nothing, if not derivative, and any new shading cast on the same old story is often enough to make a good movie, and this is a good one.

I didn't expect much when I started the movie rolling on my desktop. The descriptive blurb screamed ""direct to video"" to anyone who cared to read it. The plot is, of course, unlikely and requires a pretty hefty suspension of disbelief. The character cliches of a tough but vulnerable, slightly shady but heart-of-gold, spy come in from the cold, corrupt CIA agents and black-hearted, nearly impossibly evil corporate psychopaths are all there for the movie's writers to work with.

On the positive side, the plot flows very smoothly, the writing is adequate, the acting is above average, the cinematography good, the unlikely McGuffen is easy to understand, and the background environment is a little different than most other European locations. Altogether a good effort to put together an amusing and fast paced action movie to waste away an hour or two on a cold and rainy Autumn night.",1449014400,,1301,4.958715596330276

5142056,5,B0089LX8II,Don't listen to the negative reviews. The people who post bad reviews are the ones who do nothing but sit at home and watch movies all day. They then compare movies to what they've seen before and that's how they judge. These people get annoyed over a detail or some vague random thing in the story and deem a movie terrible. They think of themselves as experts who get off on finding things they don't like in movies. These people are short-tempered type and are always hurt when a movie doesn't touch their feelings in the right way. For the rest of us normal people with friends and lives; this movie is great and really entertaining to watch. I found the girl character to be annoying at times but otherwise it was a great movie.,1448150400,,733,4.437037037037037

It's the typical unassuming single dad (yet master spy) cliche with the annoying and self involved daughter who's approval he desperately seeks. She acts up, doesn't listen in life and death situations, and eventually gets used for leverage...does this sound familiar? She spends half the movie completely clueless and the other half as some kind of super-sleuth that bosses around her ex-CIA black-ops killer of a dad. You find yourself rooting for the bad guy to take take her out and put an end to everyones misery.

I don't recall anyone acting either over the top or underperforming. The movie was filmed in foreign country(ies) and it helped to give a certain air or feel to the movie.

The whole premise is about a man who suddenly finds himself a nonperson in a world of intrigue. The company he works for no longer exists, and everyone he contacts has either never existed, is dead, or lies denying that they know him. It's the usual conspiracy spy movie, but it's done very well. I would and probably will, watch this again.",1447027200,,680,4.573770491803279

5142752,4,B0089LX8II,"I frankly only noticed Erased because of the blatant attempt to evoke ""Taken"", but no regrets about passing an afternoon with this somewhat generic action pic.  On a dramatic level this film is certainly no ""must see"", but Aaron Eckhart gives us a good and charismatic performance as the action hero, and the production quality on the action level is very good.

SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW!  The following just delves a little into criticism.  The performance of the daughter, Amy, was quite all right, but the scripting of this part was often a bore.  Yes, we can enjoy empathizing with the true qualities of the father daughter roles, but in this type of fiction I probably wanted a little less common of a teenage girl.  Does anyone else remember the Walmart family night feature films?  Amy would have been right at home in one of those ""family value"" plots, touching upon the self assured side, the pouty, the know it all, and the ""deal with me as I step on the gas pedal which would in reality kill us in haste"" scene.

SPOILERS DO FOLLOW!  If there was a breaking point in the dramatic aspect, for me it was in that escape from the hotel garage CIA shootout confrontation.  In the earlier vehicle escape scene I felt real concern for who may or may not be killed or maimed, but this time as Amy sped down the avenue, after a moment each long passing second my interest waned.  This was not Jason Bourne skillfully dodging collision, but Amy on the drag strip defying dad way beyond the likely survivability no more than if she had been texting on the freeway.  And if we forgive the extension of that little scene, what happens next?  Let's take a break from adrenaline and survival instinct and sit in the car and have this out for a moment, never mind that we straight lined away from a crack CIA kill team a little way down the road amid a hail of gunfire.  lol, still a pretty fun action flick.",1445990400,,1898,4.479651162790698

This is fine-crafted garbage meant to have you grow your hatred of Halburton-type white male power players and sympathize with the poor, misunderstood Muslims in our cruel world. Cliche-filled, heavy-handed moralizing ruined this well-shot thriller. You may not notice anything out of place but I did. Radical Islam wants to convert us infidels or kill us. I haven't ever been  threatened by the CIA, white American males, or Haliburton. Watch if you must, but beware; this is propaganda cloaked as entertainment. I do wish Aaron Eckhart hadn't made this.

I mean they even went so far as to have her make a silly comment about milk enzymes, and then in the middle of death and bullets, run away from her father and then of course, get kidnapped.

It's somewhat predictable at times, but overall, Aaron is not the problem, it's her and the not-so-seemingly-important yet you sorta get it plot-line about a shipping company selling weapons overseas and we morally have an issue about it so we must stop it. Its eye-candy and good spy-flick, but it lacks a strong line of story that would have have made this even better.",1444953600,,812,4.449664429530201

5143296,2,B0089LX8II,"This movie starts off kind of rocky with the director apparently attempting to convey as many passing. The opening 5-10 minutes are like you're window shopping at Chekhov's Gun Store. Every little tiny bit of information in that opening will be referenced again. After the movie brushes off the weird intro and starts to find itself, it's a decent enough romp...aside from the fact that nobody besides Aaron Eckhart can act. (Olga Kurylenko is TERRIBLE in this movie. She can barely get her lines out. The rest of the cast aren't any better.)

The movie was going along decently enough until just about the midpoint, and at that point, I guess the screenwriter was rushed for time or something, because there's not a single sensible move that anyone else in the movie makes from that point forward. Amy, the daughter vacillates between competent and dumb as a rock or steely and weepy depending on what the plot requires to move forward. She's not a character, she's just a plot device. Aaron Eckhart's character just waltzes past security to accost people, nobody says a word. Even the big bad doesn't make any sense. The are just too many nonsensical moving parts in the latter half.

It's a mildly inoffensive 100 minutes or so.",1444435200,,1231,4.80188679245283

A terrorist is a terrorist, whether moderate or extreme. This movie gives a clear picture of what goes on behind the doors of our government. Corporations, whether it be banks (federal reserve) protecting the Federal Reserve notes from being devalued, mining companies, or oil companies, they all seem to be working with the CIA. Seems as if these days, instead of starting a full blown war, we create a resistance, send arms, and train them to topple a government within its own borders.",1444176000,,686,5.026315789473684

5143602,2,B0089LX8II,I am so bored watching this right now. So formulaic. Why on earth did they not bother to at least throw in some cool spy stuff with Aaron Eckart using his high tech lock breaking knowledge? The only thing that would have made this movie watchable is if Arnold SwarAnegger from 1984 played the lead and smoked a lot of cigars. That or maybe smoking a lot of drug.,1443830400,,362,4.260869565217392
5143603,3,B0089LX8II,"(Warning: maybe a spoiler here or two).  A decent enough thriller, but lots and lots -- and lots -- of plot holes which really detract from it. The basic premise is a bit thin to start with. The business of the bad guys who are just freakin' supermen at finding someone who wants to be lost in a big city is dubious enough. Or bad guys casually wandering through a modern European city slaughtering people right and left -- never a cop in sight, not until the good guy is dizzily climbing from a smashed car or trying to escape through a crowd, anyhow -- really stretches it. (I mean, really, a guy runs into a hospital gunning down anyone in his way: doctors, nurses, patients asleep in their beds, visitors? Describing that as over the top is like calling the Grand Canyon deep).  And you have to love an ending where the hero, having conquered all, is able to prance happily through an airport onto a plane. What happened to all the all-points bulletins with Interpol that were out for him? They magically died with the bad guys? Still, if you're good at suspending disbelief, it's sort of a kick to watch, with a reasonably satisfying ending.",1443830400,,1146,4.5048076923076925

5143639,1,B0089LX8II,"Mild spoiler alerts below. It actually starts off okay and has an okay plot but as the movie progresses it goes downhill. The daughters acting is pretty bad her character is worse. For example, people are hunting them down trying to kill them and she throws this dramatic temper tantrum and runs off on her own because she found out her dad lied about being in the CIA.Then this scary henchman tracks them down based on a picture someone took of the daughter and one of her friends at school. But they don't question her friend they go after the friend's dad who had just so happened to have helped them and knew where they were. That was one of many completely illogical things. I also found it over the top and pointless as to why they killed almost every sub character along with just random characters.

He's an ex covert operative for the US, who has quit his American spy job. Now he lives & works in Europe. His teenage daughter lives with him, but wishes she was back stateside with her grandfather again. He's been hired by a Security Company, to find weak spots in their security systems. To try to defeat their ""security inventions""...so they can be retooled & improved upon. One day he finds a discrepancy with a ""part number"" in one of the devices he was inspecting. This discovery winds up turning his whole world upside down. He literally becomes a nobody from that point on. His identity has been ""Erased"". He gets blamed for things he didn't do...or incidents that ""did"" happen...but were well beyond his control. Without revealing anything further...why not pick this one to watch. I enjoyed it.

Once he finished his analysis, suddenly the main character is erased and there's no record of his employment or him having checks deposited at the bank ... and the entire floor where the company was located has been abandoned and swept clean.

It's not the actresses fault. It's the script's fault. She was written to be stubborn to a fault. I have a hard time believing that a person experiencing what she experiences would remain so antagonistic in the face of mortal danger on top of being so stupid.

5144029,4,B0089LX8II,"If you suddenly wake up some day and the company that you work for no longer exists then, hopefully, you are ex-CIA (like Aaron Eckhart aka Ben Logan in Erased) so you might be able to unravel what happened. Of course, while doing all of the, as it turns out, dangerous investigation, it doesn't help that your estranged daughter (Liana Liberato aka Amy Logan) now happens to live with you and that you are finding dead co-workers everywhere and that a colleague, Anna Brandt (Olga Kurylenko), may not be providing you will good intel. As thrillers (not mysteries) go, this is a bit predictable at times but overall there is enough good action and suspense mixed in to the (not overly original) plot and sub-plots to keep one entertained. It is definitely above average (or what is called ""okay"" at 3), especially with Eckhart and Kurylenko, so I'll round it up to 4.",1442880000,,867,4.673202614379085

5144070,2,B0089LX8II,Could not finish this movie. Casting and acting was fine yet the storyline was ridiculous. The leading man could do nothing with an eye to keeping a low profile or to convince others of his plight. Even the company for which he thought he worked just brushed him off as a crackpot yet they had everything to lose. The kidnap scene was great until they simply ran away on foot from the police with radios...on a freeway. I guess the  police cannot catch someone who runs off screen...Please...a movie has to be believable for me to finish. Also...why does a movie with 60% approval from the viewers get 4 out of 5 stars. The math doesn't work out...I wanted to give this movie every chance but gave it about 20% approval so thats...2 stars? Not one star? Not sure...good luck!,1442448000,,775,4.535714285714286

It's not an original plot by any means but Definitely better than most. And has a good pace to it. I rate it as a watch. There is one point that didn't quite work. See spoiler below ooooor watch for yourself. I actually would give this a 3.5 star but I guess you can't do that.

THIS IS THE PERT WHERE I GIVE YOU A SPOILER, SO DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW. That being said you can actually figure this part out from the trailer, so not actually a big deal. He used to work for the CIA. There I said it. Can't take it back now. ....Anyways yeah he used to work for the CIA and is trained to kill people. So how he doesn't instantly know he's been screwed over in his new civilian job is beyond me. Going to his job one day to find it empty and everyone is dead, yet he still has this attitude of huh, what, I don't understand this must be a mistake. Instead of instantly saying ""Ah crap! Time to turn back to the old me and get these guys"" It's like he forgot that 6mos. ago he was a traind govt. spy.

I don't get all the complaints about the daughter. Of course you  would expect a teenager to make good decisions after is in a serious auto accident, being shot at and seeing her father kill someone. The kind of thing one would expect after a mundane day at school. Certainly a level of sympathetic arousal a minor should be expected to manage without doing anything dumb. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. I streamed on Amazon prime; great picture, sound and no buffering. Watch it.

And so they made this awful movie! Don't waste your time, it is filled with absolute stupidity, the teenage daughter, well into the movie after her father (CIA) save them from certain death decides to have a temper tantrum after realizing her dad had a girlfriend and so drives the stolen BMW through the streets at 100 miles an hour until her dad pulls the emergency break, then she jumps out of the car and runs away only to get caught by the bad guys who threaten to kill her, oh did I forget to mention ""Man on Fire"".

Probably low budget, not so good writing, time, etc. I think it might have been slightly better than Jack Ryan. The camera work got better as the movie went along, like maybe different camera guy.

5145344,3,B0089LX8II,This movie is modeled after many other spy/ hit man films but lacks the intensity and characters of those stories.  The hero is not entirely believable as a hit man. He comes off more like James Bond's accountant. The action is good at times but the story line between action sequences is droll and filled with a supposedly murderous father's undying love for his estranged daughter. Throw in an insipid corporate villain and you have a cure for insomnia.,1441065600,,455,4.7594936708860756

5145361,4,B0089LX8II,"Critics panned Erased for being derivative, and it is. But if you have a working formula and can tell it again with suspense and drama, where's the harm? Erased is your basic thriller with actors and crew I've never heard of doing admirable work. There are a few places where believability is stretched thin (cars aren't that easy to hotwire nor are deadbolts that easy to pick). But pacing is excellent, plot twists are well timed, character development is credible (I thought I would hate the generic Amy Logan, played by Liana Liberato, but she turned out to be un-generic and I loved her), and the music is great. Critics also carped about scenes supposedly set in Brussels that were clearly filmed in Antwerp; that's just snooty scribes showing off their Euro knowledge. No one barks when something supposedly occurring in Montana is shot in Canada. Executive summary: if you like intense thrillers, you'll love Erased.",1441065600,,924,4.92948717948718

5145467,4,B0089LX8II,"the difference here is the style. So its a little shorter then jason bourne on action; but in a way that is critical, realistic. It pictures the reality of what it means to be set up. Not understanding the narrative of the situation, but understanding the need to hunt out, and find a solution, a resolution. Is the daughter a tack on? Absolutely. Does it pay off? Certainly. Other considerations for this movie are not so much on tacky elements, so much as highlighting highly professional and elusive criminal syndicates.

A few tactics were over-hung for ""heroes"" but this movie for me personified a lot of the fear related to the circumstances. You're riding the line of somewhere between crazy idiot and mastermind. Revealing secrets in products and highlighting genuine circumstances of corporate neglect [in some elements] onto more or less complete corporate betrayal. The super-human element stands out for hero, as always. But that said, the scenarios he plays out of are very ""real"" in a ""what would you do?"" kind of way.

I think the notion of erased/burned was a bit forced on the title, but only because forewarning spoiler: [look away!] cia inside job [k you can look back]

For a corporate espionage, and betrayal film there was little investment to care. Not in a lack of the depth of the characters on screen, but the lack of characters that were off. There's always a fourth wall kinda character, and that more or less in parts onto this film an ever convenient taint of daddy slept with other women in the air.

Kill a couple hours, you're going to anyway. :p I'd say worth it, but I threw in the towel on expectations at Dad can't work a laundry machine but can figure out how to dissolve sophsticated department of justice lock mechanisms.

5145471,5,B0089LX8II,"Surprisingly good. I've seen a number of films with Aaron Eckhart in a starring or supporting role. Most to the movies have benn pretty good but even in the poor ones like ""I, Frankenstein"", Eckhart has been good.

He is sometimes called by commenters - a ""poor man's Liam Neesom'. But that's not fair. Before 'Taken' Neesom was in approximately the same career place that Eckhart is now. One lucky hit and Neesom is a big star. That could happen to Eckhart too.

But alas this film while good isn't the kind that is likely to transform Eckhart's career.  We had never seen Neesom play an action hero and that role fit him remarkably well. But the ex-CIA that Eckhart plays here is something he has done many times before. It's right in his wheelhouse.",1440979200,,752,4.555555555555555

5145578,2,B0089LX8II,"I nominate the Tek 9 for an Oscar. Who agrees with me that guns should appear in the credits? It so often seems that guns play such a prominent role in movies that they become a crutch for suspense. Now that shooting people is so commonplace in movies, for greater impact producers must think they have to show scores of people being shot, using a variety of guns and camera angles. In other respects, the movie was average, with good production values, but the plot begs the audience to ignore the notion that a CIA hit man (is that really a thing?) is traipsing around Europe on a job WITH HIS DAUGHTER IN TOW, while on the payroll of a company, and with people, that he only decides to check out after events get out of control. I often felt I was too old to be watching the movie - that the target audience is teenagers, but I wouldn't let my kids see this film. The scenes of violence are gratuitous and unnecessary, and the plot is flaccid and unchallenging.",1440892800,,964,4.361111111111111

5145640,1,B0089LX8II,"I really like Aaron Eckhart, and I loved Taken - the obvious inspiration of ""Erased."" However, the movie is badly let down by its script. If you come here to see a revenge movie (as which the movie clearly markets itself), don't. Its focus is on how poor immigrants suffer from the evil of the (American) White Man, presented with the subtlety and intelligence of an agitprop movie.

Part of what worked in Taken was that Liam Neeson was both likable, and credible as an experienced fighting machine. Eckhart's father is written - by an (ethnic) non-American - as a dumb cliche of the American Man: he lives in beautiful Europe, and all he can think of to do with his daughter is to watch baseball; and he feeds her nuts and so almost kills her despite an allergy that *a CIA agent living to be extremely detail-oriented* would have taken due note of. Contrary to the calm resolve of Neeson, Eckhart is hurried and hunted and out of breath the entire friggin movie.

The few fights are like 50s Western: two guuuuuuys hitting each other over and over, but no one breaks even as much as a finger or bites or scratches which, if you did any contact sport, you know is the kind of thing you go for. There is one fight that turns a bit more decisive, but overall, the fights are a true bore and not realistic in the least. And after, as the daughter stays with Daddy, it's always ""I'm so sorry, daughter!"" times. The movie targets the middle-class that used to be busy protesting Bush's wars as its ample trite social commentary shows, delivering the interracial happy ending (between the daughter and some guy you saw briefly 3 times before) that you, I am sure, were so waiting for.

What it doesn't deliver, is thrills or even logic.",1440720000,4,1732,4.509554140127388

I kept jumping ahead, but every scene I stopped at, there was the 15-year-old daughter still complaining, still criticizing, still questioning, and still wanting to be in charge.  Just think, she's the smartest person in the movie even though her high school report card showed mostly grades of C and D.  Yuk.  If she had gotten killed, or kidnapped, or sent home, or had her tongue cut out, I might have continued to watch.  I made it through a little over half the film and couldn't take any more.

8526352,4,B0089LX8II,"The movie plot and characters - Aaron, Liana, and Olga are well done, full of emotion and Directed so well, I was scared for all of them.  But, I was so disappointed with the BD quality.  I haven't seen the DVD, so I can't give you any details for that format.  The contrast was so high that many scenes that were just a little low in light, the shadows that had detail in the original which I saw went black. Some details which were important to see were gone.  I am downloading it from iTunes to get much better quality and detail in the bright outdoor scenes and shadows.",1524268800,,574,4.238532110091743

8526354,5,B0089LX8II,"All around very enjoyable and gripping film. It's a very soft R- there is absolutely no nudity, next to zero swearing. Although there are scenes of violence, and I'm probably somewhat desensitized, they were minimally bloody. Excellent suspense and dialogue. The relationship between father and daughter was believable and sweet. It was just a great movie okay??
My only gripe is that (spoiler) one of my favorite characters, and possibly love interest of the main lead, had to die!!! WHYYYYYYYYY?!!??!",1522972800,,502,5.2875
8526355,5,B0089LX8II,"It helps to know the following from the outset as you watch this interesting movie.

A CIA manager working secretly for the bad-guys; hires experts, who have worked as consultants for the CIA in the past, to build small containers with coded access, which will eventually hold secret CIA documents. This is so the bad-guys can get to the documents without the documents self destructing within their special containers, when mishandled by the wrong people. The bad CIA manager gives the bad-guys the security layout for the facility where the secret documents are stored. The bad-guys go to all this expense and trouble, because they have to retrieve a certain set of documents, which, when studied, will expose their criminal operation and eventually the moles in the CIA.

The good-guy, electronics expert, thinks he is doing normal contract work for the CIA, but comes across an odd thing and without any suspicion begins an investigation to answer some questions he has. Once he finds the answers to his questions; he will discover the project is run by bad-guys, so, before that happens, the bad-guys abruptly shut everything down.

 Once the secret documents are stolen; this good-guy, expert, who designed the sophisticated document containers, becomes a prime suspect.

The good-guy has his teenage daughter with him on the day everything unravels. The good-guy must get the secret documents back, expose the bad-guys, and survive being hunted by both sides in the process.

The film moves at a good pace, with a likeable good-guy and his likeable daughter.",1522454400,,1565,5.09375
