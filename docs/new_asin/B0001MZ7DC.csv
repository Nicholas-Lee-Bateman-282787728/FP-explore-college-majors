2018078,5,B0001MZ7DC,"The end is here....
It's the final battle for the Z Senshi arrives in this volume.  Super Goku 4 and Super Vegeta 4 are now facing the final enemy, who the power of the Dragonballs... but things go from bad to hopeless, when the two drain the rest of their energy, and their last ally is absorbed by the final foe!  Now, the rest of the fighters have prepared to fight a suicide battle, but Goku still has one final ace up his sleeve.  Can he pull it off?  Who will live and die in the series finale?
Well, that's my recap of the episodes that are coming up.  The end fight is pretty good, although not for everyone.  Some people possibly could be disappointed, but not me.  Also, the final episode is just EXCELLENT, as it's the farewell to everyone, and even shows the best moments from all 3 series.  It's a wonderful ending, especially compared to the lackluster finishings of DB and DBZ.  I truly recommend this one, just for the finish, if nothing else.",1081296000,7,959,4.372881355932203

But is this his last hurrah? You'll just have to see for yourself. It also has a closing montage that just might bring a tear to the eye as it wraps up everthing From Goku's first appearence to that wonderful laugh of his at ""the end"".

8015003,4,B0001MZ7DC,"Basing this off of the Japanese episodes, not the craptacular/raptacular English dub...

This is the ending of the Evil Dragons arc as well the ending of the GT series. It's also the ending of the DB trilogy of animated titles as well.

The final battle is worth watching, even though it pales in comparison to the excellent fights of DB/DBZ (mainly because the animators didn't base this animation off of any Toriyama manga, GT is an anime-only story in the DB trilogy.)

The final episode, ep. 64, is worth the price of the DVD. It's the final goodbye to our characters, and even introduces some new characters (Goku Jr. & Vegeta Jr.), leaving the viewer a glimpse into the future of the Dragonworld.

The ending sequence is a montage of the entire saga of DB, DBZ, & DBGT while the beautiful ""Dan Dan Kokoro Hikareteku"" plays in the background, and our hero Son Goku saying his final farewell. Tear-inducing, yet hopeful & uplifting, and worth a watch for even the most cynical DB fan.

The English version doesn't do this ending justice, and instead replaces the music and adds unnecessary dialogue. I don't particularly recommend it, even if you HATE Japanese.

Otherwise, a mediocre DB series, but a wonderful ending to the whole DB saga.",1150243200,,1244,4.7627906976744185
8015004,5,B0001MZ7DC,My name is Mr. Sapp and I got into Dragon Ball a couple of years back and ever since then I have been hooked on it. I have all the T shirts watched all the shows and I collected the card game. The worst thing that happened to me was when I saw the final episode in English on Cartoon Network. I loved it and honest to God the last two episodes put tears to my eyes. I'm a grown man and I just had to cry how this little man (Goku) took all his power to save the world. This is a must see and I would bet my life on that. I have already watched it 10 times and I can not get tired of it. Goku has always been in my heart and will always be there. For everytime I get angry I think of him and how he controled his anger and always did the best for the people of earth and especially to save his friends. The people of earth will miss Goku and so will I.,1116806400,6,851,3.681318681318681
8015005,4,B0001MZ7DC,"This is just my personal opinion (so please don't get offended, especially you sincere Z fans)...  I was tremendously disappointed with the GT (Grand Tour) series.  It was too fast and definitely too predictable.  His victories were too easy.  Also, Goku's personality was much different in GT, compared to the original dragon ball and dragon ball Z episodes.  Goku didn't have much flavor.  However, I do appreciate the fact that there's more to look forward to, and from what I hear, real soon!!!  The Black Star series.
  The dragon ball trilogy has great messages to them though.  Goku constantly reminded his opponents of the consequences of their actions before they experienced them.  He definitely taught me alot about personal responsibility and accountability.  His character and kindness changed the attitudes of so many people.  He was unselfish and full of hope.  It all came from within.  Take advantage of the opportunities that you get, by learning from each episode's message.
  It's hard to bring a good conclusion to something as spectacular as the dragon ball triology.  They didn't do a bad job.  I guess that my expectations were a little too high.  With all that being said, I still believe that Dragon ball, DBZ, and DBGT can take a bow, for being the best cartoon ever.",1084320000,8,1294,4.930232558139535
8015006,5,B0001MZ7DC,this is a great movie. it puts the end of dbz to shame.it ties everything together and i was not dissopointed.i was going to buy conversion instead of this but conversion only has 3 episodes and this has 4.now i am glad i picked this.if u r a true fan or a new one u must get this,1083024000,4,280,3.8448275862068964
