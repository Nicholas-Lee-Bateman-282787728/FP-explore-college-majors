8155710,5,B000KDW5ZU,"This is an excellent show, I bought all the seasons. Unfortunately the DVD packaging from Canada is absolutely useless and damaging to the DVDs. The majority of the DVD sets arrived with DVDs loose and damaged. I have a machine that resurfaces the DVDs and that is what I had to do with many of them. I now have them in individual sleeves so the damage will not continue to happen. Since only season 1 has been released in the US and a compilation set was released as well, I had no choice but to order the Canadian releases. I am glad I did even though I had to do some disc restoring. If you can fix your DVDs I would recommend getting this series in its entirety.",1321056000,,666,4.2109375
8155711,5,B000KDW5ZU,"This is the Canadian version and is edited for content only.  Visual quality is not as good as MGM, but certainly not bad either.  The menu screen is tricky and has trouble giving the episode selection.  In spite of all this, it is absolutely worth buying, especially considering that FOX/MGM cannot get their act together and produce the series in its entirety like they should have years ago!  Over all, the quality of this product is good and whatever has been edited is barely noticeable if at all.  It is far better to have this with slightly less quality, than to have nothing from MGM with slightly better quality!",1254268800,14,621,4.660550458715596

8155713,3,B000KDW5ZU,"Don't know for sure, but the fact that the ""product description"" above has no description of any kind makes me VERY suspicious. I got burned once by a Canadian outfit which offers 3 thru 7 in 2 boxed sets that are made up of all the censored/edited episodes. Of course, they don't reveal this. I watched half of the first episode, saw immediately that it was not the original version so I demanded my money back and they very reluctantly did so. I suspect that this is the work of this same company--apparently they've just re-packaged these ""sanitized"" versions, trying to trick us. Again. How sleazy.
  No, I'll continue to wait for the announced (years ago) MGM sets. I've tried every which way to contact MGM but they refuse to respond. NETFLIX has them listed--but not for normal rental! Hello?! When asked about this, their rep was evasive. What in the HELL is going on? This mystery just goes on and on. There must be a reason, but what could that be?
