8266557,5,B0017M9ZJC,"This 2 hour DVD is a heart warming, and well-documented story of the ""kingdom of lions"" and the ""world's fastest animal"", the Cheetah.  Viewers also learn to appreciate the devotion of researchers, and the fragility of life in the wild.  One comes away with  a keen sense of environmental stewardship. Wonderful DVD.",1358294400,,316,5.038461538461538
8266558,5,B0017M9ZJC,"While I very much enjoyed the ""Cheetah Orphans"" episode, I couldn't help but get the feeling that certain parts were missing.  After viewing & a little mucking about, I discovered that ""Cheetah Orphans"" is actually a cut down version of ""Fast Track To Freedom"" and ""Toki's Tale"" (in that order). About 40 minutes or so of content is cut from those two films in making ""Cheetah Orphans"". So while I'd still recommend ""Cheetah Orphans"", I thought I would make people aware of the other two videos.",1297036800,12,495,4.755813953488372
8266559,5,B0017M9ZJC,If you love Big Cat Diary and Simon King you will love the story of the cheetah orphans. I laughed and cried at their antics.,1280707200,2,125,4.04
8266560,5,B0017M9ZJC,"I fell in love with the stories on this DVD. The quality is amazing as well. I have always loved Simon King and his story of the two orphaned Cheetah cubs is emotional, but beautiful. The lion story shows just how precious wild life is and how we are damaging life for these wild animals.",1258156800,6,288,4.254545454545455
