Creativity bursts forth like a `super nova' in 'Women as Butterfly'. 'Women as Butterfly' reflects Ann Saint John Hawley's awakening. Ann Saint John Hawley, in her mid-seventies, buries her husband, goes through a grieving process and then rises like a `Phoenix'!  Ann embodies what each human being wants to be; a brilliant star in the universe. Ann Saint John Hawley's revelation of the world as 'art' is only superceded by the insight of the filmmaker.  `Women as Butterfly' captures how truly magnificent we human beings are and places the realization in your lap.  `Women as Butterfly' made me cry, laugh and my spirit sore with newfound passion. Bravo! Thank you Michelle for your insight into what life is about.",1033689600,,744,5.032520325203252

This is a true story of a woman whose own identity had been put on hold while she raised a family...Late in life she became reborn and burst into a whole new world of art and creativity.
This film will inspire women and men alike, and anyone who says ""I'm too old...I'm not talented...I don't have the time.""",1033430400,,477,4.370786516853933

The woman is very interesting, her art is amazing, she plays drums, she dances this strange kind of Japanese dance and draws and paints about it. My gosh, and what's more, she lives in Taos, New Mexico....I could see and 'feel' that incredible light in many scenes. My artist-self awakened with new energy and confidence. I am inspired to be true to making art, no matter what! Thanks Butterfly Woman!",1033344000,,562,4.63
