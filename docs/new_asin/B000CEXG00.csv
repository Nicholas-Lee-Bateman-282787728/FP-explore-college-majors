2461307,5,B000CEXG00,"This was and still is a fun show.

***Note- Judging from the other reviews left by the Rockhead who left the Jan. 1,2006 review, the only thing that this individual apparently does enjoy is leaving one-star negative reviews for as many items as he/she can fit into their sad life. How pathetic!!!",1140480000,15,296,4.6923076923076925
2461308,5,B000CEXG00,"I am overjoyed we diehard Flintstone fans don't have to wait in vain for the complete fifth season!!! I must say it's really hard to pick a favorite episode from this season, but I narrowed it down to the one when Fred and Barney get mixed up with a sexy female spy Madame Yes. I suppose that was a parody of James Bond, considering their hero was named Jay Bondrock!
I also still laugh out loud at the dancing girls at Pebbles 1st birthday party. Barney was a riot when he started dancing with the girls and telling Betty he was just trying to get them out the door! Yeah right Barney!
I'm also looking forward to seeing the episode when Fred and Barney have to stay the night in a haunted house to inherit his uncle Giggles Flinstones money. You can't help but crack up when Fred and Barney's hair wiggles everytime they hear that wicked laughter!!! I'll be like a kid in a candystore when this fabulous dvd set arrives March 7th!!! I can hardly wait!!!",1134345600,34,955,4.370786516853933
2461309,5,B000CEXG00,"The big highlight of the Fifth season is the two episodes featurig the Gruesomes.

The new boxset has the staggered trays which means it's half the size of the old volumes. I wish they'd just use the two DVD slimline boxes if they want to make the collections smaller.

As far as the bonus features go:

A Stone Aged Parenting Guide 4:07

A clip show that's disguised to look like an educational film about child rearing. Pure time killer.

The Gruesomes' Road to Bedrock 8:28

Earl Kress explains how the Gruesomes evolved. This is actually really informative - he lets us know how the Gruesomes got their start in Snooper and Blabber. We get to see how Michael Maltese ""wrote"" his scripts - he storyboarded. This is an impressive bonus feature since it seems that too much of the H-B extras are pure fluff.

Gemstone - 4:34

2 ads and a vintage interview

Welch-ade. Fred and Barney play golf, but their game is off. After a bartender serves up the new Welch's grape juice with extra vitamins.

welch's grape jelly - Fred gets a midnight snack of Grape Jelly and explains the process to Peebles. Also promotes the Flintstones grape jelly glasses

Hanna & Barbera explain how the Flintstones evolved. They talk about the enduring qualities of the Flintstones.",1132876800,4,1260,4.707762557077626
2461310,5,B000CEXG00,"At this writing, we'll all have to wait until 2006 to enjoy this collection.  Allen Reed (Fred), Jean Vanderpyl (Wilma and Pebbles), Mel Blanc (Barney and Dino), Don Messick (Bamm Bamm) and John Stephenson (Mr. Slate) all return for the 1964-65 season.  Since Bea Benederet got an acting role on liveaction sitcom Petticoat Junction, she would leave the voice to former talkshow host Gerry Johnson.  In addition, the Rubbles would have their own pet, Hoppy, a green kangaroo from Australiarock(Messick would supply Hoppy's voice ""Hawp! Hawp!"").  At first, Fred didn't like Hoppy too much, but when Hoppy saved the lives of Pebbles and Bamm Bamm on a picnic, Fred was won over (not to mention that he got his picture in the paper along with the Hoparoo).  Also, at the intro, the Rubbles would join the Flintstones for the movie and as Dino popped his head through the roof, Fred and Barney would set Pebbles and Bamm Bamm atop.

In this season, Pebbles has her 1st birthday party and Fred is in charge of booking a caterer for 2 parties- one for her and one for his buddies at the Waterbuffalo Lodge (you can guess what happens, especially with a caterer whose attitude is ""I'm the only caterer in town!"").  Fred races in the Indianrockalus 500 as Goggles Pizano (his psuedo-Italian accent is a scream- ""Itsa looksa likea Goggles Pizano izza hangin' uppa his agoggles!""), Fred needs to see a doctor who turns out to be a quack when he switches Fred's personality 1st to Dino's then to Barney's, then..., Fred experiments with a softdrink and winds up shrinking himself to size (Barney siezes the opportunity to audition the 2 of them on the Ed Sullystone show ""Rrrrright here in this studio is the reeeeally big...""), a new family called the Gruesomes moves into town, similar to the Addams Family (""Would you have a cup of red ants?"") and Dino falls in love with the neighbor's dog and grumpy neighbor Mr. Loudrock (voiced by Henry Corden, who'd take over Fred's voice after Reed passed away in 1977) doesn't approve of the relationship.  Fred inherits the estate of his rich but kooky Uncle Giggles and must spend the night there to be scared to death by his creepy servants and the memory of his ""late"" uncle's laugh, at the World's Fair, the Flintstones and the Rubbles take a look into the future and get bitten by lions, help Columbus discover America, help Benjamin Franklin discover electricity and finally wind up in the 20th century where a wisecracking hamburger vendor says ""Four brontosaurus burgers, that'll be 2 rocks, please!""  Fred poses as king for a day for his lookalike from Stonesylvania (""The rrrotskin spotskin is motskin in the plotskin!""), Uncle Tex invites the Flintstones and the Rubbles to his ranch at Texarock, the Hatrocks pay the Flintstones a friendly visit and quickly wear out their welcome (until they are surrounded by Four Insect impersonators, now don't tell me you don't know who the 4 Insects are supposed to be, here's a hint- ""She said yeah, yeah, yeah!""), Fred poses as Superstone (""Beeheeheehawhaw!"") and as Santa Claus at a department store in Bedrock and later gets hired by the man himself for the night, the Flintstones go on vacation and ""lifeguard"" Jimmy Darrock has to bail Fred out each time he tries his hand at surfing (voiced by James Darren, who sings ""Everybody's Gone Crazy with the Surfin' Craze""), and both Fred and Barney are asked to solve a mystery and wind up on Candid Crime (""Lady, I'm a married man.  Besides, you're melting my ice cream!"").  In the episode, Fred pays a nod to his inspiration ""Very funny, everybody's a Jackie Gleastone!""  There's also a James Bond satire in which Fred and Barney wind up facing the evil Dr. Sinister and bailing out the sexy but selfish Madame Yes- ""Can you help me, good lookeeng?""  Pebbles and Bamm Bamm are entered in a beauty contest, which starts a war between the Flintstones and the Rubbles (each wants their own child to win).  Fred wins a flying lesson and his instructor is a sexy female.  Wilma invites Bony Hurdle, a rodeo man, who makes Fred jealous with his roundup stories and tucking little Pebbles into bed.  Fred becomes sheriff for a day when they visit a ghost town and almost gets in trouble with the Slatery brothers (Barney uses a voice similar to Deputy Droopalong's- ""Looks lak thissizit, Mr. Flintstone!"").

If you enjoyed the last 4 seasons, you'll enjoy this one as well.  That'll be 2 rocks, please!",1132704000,53,4433,4.772549019607843

2461640,4,B000CEXG00,"The penultimate set of The Flintstones is not quite up to the level of the previous seasons. In this set we find more parodies & take-offs as the writers were becoming less original. It's still quality material, just not as good.

""Hop Happy""- Not to be out done the Rubbles get a pet of their own, a Hoparoo named Hoppy. Dino & Hoppy save their owners during a picnic.

""Monster Fred""- Fred has a bowling bowl bounce off his head & he reverts to a baby.

""Itty Bitty Fred""- Fred tries to invent a new soft drink but it's a shrinking formula instead. Fred & Barney decide to do a ventriliquist act with Fred as the dummy. They go on the Ed Sullyrock show but Fred's formula wears off at the wrong time.

""Pebbles' Birthday Party""- Fred tries to organize two parties at the same time: One for his daughter & one for his Lodge. Of course, each party arrives at the wrong place.

""Bedrock Rodeo Round-Up""- Bony Hurdle, a rodeo star & ex-beau of Wilma, arrives in town. Bony gets Pebbles attention to such a degree that Fred joins the rodeo competition in order to winn his daughter's affection back. This episode was a take off on the Stony Burke series.

""Cinderellastone""- Another take off, this time from the fairy tale, Cinderella.

""A Haunted House Is Not a Home""- This is another take off: Fred must spend the night in his uncle's home in order to inherit a fortune.

""Dr. Sinister""- This one is parody of the James Bond films. A mysterios stranger passes Fred & Barney an envelope. Dr. Sinister is the villain who wants world domination & Madame Yes who keeps spoiling all their plans & disappearing.

""The Gruesomes""- The Gruesomes move into Tombstone Manor which is next door to the Flintstones. T he Gruesomes were a take-off on The Addams Family & THe Munsters.

""The Most Beautiful Baby in Bedrock""- The Water Buffalo Lodge has a baby contest in which Fred & Barney enter Pebbles & Bamm Bamm. This causes a conflict between Fred & Barney. The babys run away causing Fred & Barney to mend their friendship.

""Dino & Juliet""- the title nearly tells it all. Mr. Loudrock is the Flintstones' new neighbor. Fred can't stand him but Dino falls in love with Loudrock's pet.

""King for a Night""- This story line has been done by nearly every show on television that goes beyond a season. Fred & the King of Spotsylvania are exact doubles. When the King sneaks out his ministers find Fred to impersonate the lost King. At stake is a multi-million dollar loan for the Kingdom.

""Indianrockolis 500""- Fred becomes a race car driver in the Stone Age's most famous car race.

""Adobe Dick""- This one is a parody on the Moby Dick story.

""Christmas Flintstone""- Fred needs extra cash for Christmas so he takes on a job at a department store. That doesn't work out but the manager desperately needs a Santa Claus so Fred gets that job with very positive results. Fred is so good, in fact, that the real Santa Claus asks Fred to deliver the Christmas presents in his sleigh.

""Fred's Flying Lesson""- Fred wins flying lessons at a Lodge raffle. He thinks he'll be able to turn this into a lucrative career.

""Fred's Second Car""- Fred buys a second car at a police auction, unaware that the vehicle is also being sought by a gang of jewel thieves, who think stolen jewels are hidden inside.

""Time Machine""- The Flintstones & Rubbles enter a time machine at the World's Fair that sends them on various adventures in the future.

""The Hatrocks & the Gruesomes""- The hatrocks are back! The Hatrocks are on their way to the World's Fair & stop off in Bedrock. Fred inadvertently tells them they can stay over for a while. When they don't leave Fred tries to use the Gruesomes to scare them away.

""Moonlight & Maintenance""- Fred gets a second jod at a high rise apartment. One of the amenities is a rent-free apartment but Fred isn't a maintenance man wonder.

""Sheriff for a Day""- This one is a parody on Bonanza. Fred & Barney are searching for uranium out west. They're hired as Marshall & Deputy to protect the town from a gang of outlaws bent on revenge against the town. Finally, the Catrocks show up to save the day.

""Deep in the Heart of Texarock""- Fred & Barney dress up as a cowasaurus in order to catch rustlers at his rich uncle's ranch.

""The Rolls Rock Caper""- This episode is a parody on the Amos Burke series. Fred & Barney are hired as assistants by Aaron Boulder. Unfortunately for the boys, they're chasing the criminals while Boulder chases the women.

""Superstone""- Fred is hired to take the place of a television super hero who won't make a personal appearance.

""Fred Meets Hercurock""- Fred is hired to portray the new Hercurock in a movie.

""Surfin' Fred""- This episode is similar in approach as the Ann-Margrock episode. The Flintstone & Rubbles go on vacation at a beach. Unfortunately, Spring Break is about to happen & the beach will become inundated with teenagers. James Darren is the featured vouce who's doing a take off on Bobby Darin. Though the songs aren't by the Beach Boys, you'd swear they were.",1237766400,8,5022,4.5832402234636875

worth it.  They did a fantastic job of digitally re-mastering the old ones.  I bought my favorite seasons (4 and 5)
but I was so pleased with these that I will purchase the other seasons.  The extra special features were great.  I
liked the episode where they talked  during the Ann-Margrock Presents, and Little Bamm-Bamm telling you all different informative and funny things they did to create those episodes.  If you love the Flintstones then this is
something to enjoy for years to come..",1217030400,,604,4.740384615384615
2461643,5,B000CEXG00,"Season 5 is my personal favorite.  If you are looking for a ""standard"" season, you may want to try one of the earlier ones, with the more ""Honeymooners"" style plots (Fred wants to go bowling or has a money-making scheme or feuds with Barney scenarios).  But, season 5 has some of the most bizarre, wacky and downright fun episodes, with mad scientists, spy spoofs and the fantastic ""Gruesomes"", who are of course a tip of the hat to the Addams family.  Bonus features are not major, but are interesting.  (There is an interesting, albeit somewhat brief documentary about the ""Gruesomes"" and their origins.)  The Flintstones had already aired for 4 seasons, and rather than repeating the same old tricks, they really pushed the envelope of zaniness with increasingly strange stuff.  There are even a time travel episode and an unflinchingly anachronistic yet fun Christmas episode (complete with musical number.)  If you want the weirdest stuff the Flintstones ever did, this is for you.  5 out of 5 for being a classic and MOST UNIQUE ""page right out of history.""",1194134400,2,1063,4.899441340782123

I was a huge Flintstone's fan as a kid and my daughter is now hooked on them!  The first set I bought didn't have Pebbles, BamBam & Dino in some of the episodes, but this one has them all.

Sigh...well, anyways, what a joy to be able to enjoy this show over and over again and in its entirety too and with NO commercials  :)

One thing I do have a complaint about is that I have to crank my TV real loud in order to be able to hear the episodes but I LOVE em so much so I don't care..and by the way, now my daughter enjoys the Flintstones too. Now to get the other sets, since Season 5 and 6 are my faves  :)  Oh yes, is there anyone else out there who thinks Weirdly and Crepella look a bit like Sonny and Cher????????

I'm still wondering how can Fred shave his beard with a bee inside an oister... This set has redesign the package to make it slimmer than the previous 4 seasons. As in the 4th season, it does not included the Spanish language as the first 3 seasons did. But no matter the language, the Flintstones are great. other drawback of the DVD is that you have to set the volume setting of the TV set to maximum or close to maximum to be able to hear the dialog. Other than that I highly recommend the DVD.  I give 4 stars because of the lack of Spanish language and DVD sound.",1142467200,6,666,4.285714285714286
2461683,4,B000CEXG00,"So, you say you're a Flintstone Fanatic.  That means you probably have a shelf somewhere in your living room upon which you proudly display your beautifully packaged Flintstone DVD sets.  The Complete First, Second, Third and Fourth Seasons are each graced with lovely transparent plastic slipcovers housing four-way unfolding cardboard disc-holding inserts, all liberally but tastefully decorated with nifty drawings of Fred; Barney; Wilma; Betty; Pebbles; Bamm-Bamm and Dino.  Now it's finally time to add the Fifth Season to your prized collection, and man-oh-man, Flint-fan, are you in for a shock!  You'll undoubtedly be shouting ""Yabba-Dabba-DON'T"" as you tear open that Amazon box, only to discover, much to your dismay, that the case for Stone Age installment number 5 is only _half_ the thickness of the first four, and comes with a _cardboard_ slipcover containing a sparsely-illustrated insert which shamefully hides two of those loathsome overlapping-disc holders!  I for one despise these disc holders because they make the discs more susceptible to scratches, as one disc has to sit halfway overtop of another.  Also, you can't remove Disc 2 without first removing Disc 1.  Sure, it's great to at last have the Complete Fifth Season on your aforementioned DVD shelf, but it would be much nicer if it matched the other sets.  Case issue aside, the discs themselves are comparable to the others in audio and video quality, but season five has no Spanish language track...and no commentaries either.  This year in Flintstone history (1964-65) saw the introduction of Bamm-Bamm's pet hopparoo, Hoppy, and Fred's ghoulishly green-skinned neighbors, Weirdly, Creepella and Gobby Gruesome (all of whom are inexplicably absent from the set's cover art).  It also showcased a cavalcade of wild new antagonists like Dr. Frankenstone; Uncle Giggles; Dr. Sinister and Madam Yes.  And if Betty Rubble sounds different to you, it's because she's voiced here by Gerry Johnson instead of Bea Benaderet (hey, at least it's not Rosie O'Donnell).  The plots in season five are zanier than ever, featuring everything from mad scientists, time machines and haunted houses to superheroes, fairy godmothers and cowasaurus rustlers.  Over the course of these four discs (Disc 4 is a ""flipper,"" another of my DVD pet peeves), you'll see Fred Flintstone ride in the Bedrock Rodeo; race in a prehistoric precursor to NASCAR; masquerade as the King of Stonesylvania; battle the notorious Slatery Brothers as the Sheriff of Rocky Gulch; star as Hercurock in `Hercurock and the Maidens;' shrink himself down to the size of a ventriloquist's dummy for an appearance on The Ed Sullystone Show; and much, much more!  He'll even take time out of his busy schedule to hawk Welchade Grape Drink (it's rich in levulose!) and Welch's Grape Jelly and Jam.  Yes, there's a lot of entertainment crammed uncomfortably into this thin, oddball case, so maybe you shouldn't judge a DVD set by its cover.  Nevertheless, I'll knock off one star for Warner's blatant disregard for the aesthetic integrity of the Flintstones DVD series.",1142380800,17,3101,5.246963562753036
