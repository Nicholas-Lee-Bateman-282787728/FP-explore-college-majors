8123720,3,B000FJOZWK,"This is not the Academy-award nominated adaptation of Ian McEwan's novel ""Atonement"". This has no relation to that film or even the book, it just happens to share the same name, except with a ""The"" added.

Completely different stories.",1265673600,,235,5.0256410256410255
8123721,5,B000FJOZWK,"This is a fine movie representation of McEwan's novel. The plot is thoughtful, the acting is beyond reproach from a fine cast. The cinemetography is splendid, the cuts and flash backs are very well done. Audio treatment is ingenious. It's a thoughtful, productiion with a script that closely follows the book. There's no crashing, banging, or special effects, just a flat-out excellent drama.",1198713600,2,392,5.238095238095238
8123722,1,B000FJOZWK,"The story in Atonement was good enough to make a really terrific movie. This version was so bad! I have no idea how it got an award. Traffic noise in the background,long blank spaces which may have been meant to create a pregnant pause but encouraged ennui. Hopefully someone will accept a challenge and make a version which brings out the true pathos and futility of war and it's consequences. The chickens were good.",1198368000,6,418,4.662162162162162
