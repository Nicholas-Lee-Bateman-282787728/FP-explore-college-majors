8111590,5,B000ENBT1W,"Laurence Juber is a master guitar player that aside from helping Sir Paul Create his hardest rocking solo album, (Back to the Egg) has developed techniques for the acoustic guitar that push the limits of the tone a 6 string can create! If you have the chance to see him perform don't miss it! He sells some of his work on the road but this one is older and well worth the nominal cost. ""LJ"" has moved over to alternate turnings and his knowledge of the DADGAD tuning is amazing.
I have several techniques and practice methods I got from this session that I use every day. The stretching technique alone is worth your time here.",1381104000,,627,4.413793103448276
