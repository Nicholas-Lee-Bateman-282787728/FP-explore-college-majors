8211560,3,B000TZN7MO,"Most fan based movies you see these days are just meant to be fun, humorous, and only purchased because we ourselves are fans. Sometimes they are well made, other times they are not so good, but we know to expect pointless outcome of it.

This movie isn't so much a movie as it's more of a teaser. The video is mostly just a ""Cosplay"" teaser with models standing in a spot, posing in their respective outfit and character. The video will, on occasion, show some action scenes, but overall the video is mostly for entertainment of models, not entertainment of action. I personally am not sure what the aim of this video is in general. When I got this video, I was half expecting some kind of story or at least a mini series. This is not exactly the case. Once in a while there are scenes of a story type, but after a few moments of explaining the character, the females pose in their outfits for about 5-10 minutes. The fight scenes are mostly limited to the female ninja and a few warriors she faces.

Overall, I am not exactly impressed with what I saw. This is a teaser, not a full length movie. This is just a video of some character concept ideas. (Mostly of a female nature) This video is of an adult nature, although there's no ""FULL"" nudity, there are some ""rear"" shots and some ""oops"" moments. Definitely not for kids. Do not expect a movie, as there is no movie to watch. This is for softcore adult entertainment. One more thing, the video is about 30-40 minutes with some extra content (Bloopers, previews, character bios, etc.)",1400457600,,1538,4.469750889679715
8211561,2,B000TZN7MO,"I thought this was going to be a good martial arts story or at least fight scens.
There were 3 short fight scens and girls poseing and peeling off their body paint.
This movie is misleading the girl playing Kitty is a real kung fu artis seen her on youtube
and the end guy is a stunt cordinator he knows his stuff. this is more of a watered down B movie kinda.
But the girls are pretty.",1330819200,,386,4.025974025974026
8211562,3,B000TZN7MO,"A must see for horney teenagers, plus kitty is now an adult film star so seeing her in a real movie is fascinating. Action was okay if you like women fighting(who dosen't). Running time is short but for 7 bucks and some change not ot bad",1315008000,,237,4.173913043478261
8211563,2,B000TZN7MO,"The advertised run time is listed as 90 minutes, but the ""film"" itself is 30 minutes long. They must be including ""special features"" like trailers for other films and the individual clips of the fighters that were culled from the actual film itself. As for story line there is none. I thought the first 30 minutes were just a long, disjointed intro to the actual story, as it consisted of a couple brief fights but mainly some striptease style character intros. I was shocked to see the credits telling me it was over.

The one thing I will complement is that they did use some very attractive women. The costumes were hit and miss, but some were quite well done. It actually looked like they could have made a cheesy-fun movie if they had a script, but instead we got a sizzle reel for someone wanting to make a real movie.",1314403200,3,824,4.456953642384106
8211564,2,B000TZN7MO,On the plus side all the women on this cover actually appear in the movie and there was a good woman vs woman fight and a decent woman vs man fight. On the minus side those were the only two fights in the entire film and women mostly did these weird strip teases where they remained fully clothed. Watching a woman dressed like C3PO try to do a strip tease is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen and yet a highlight of this movie.,1314403200,2,437,4.093023255813954
8211565,5,B000TZN7MO,"You do not get to see many of these.  It certainly isn't for everyone, but for those who love to see sexy women fight with powers, then this is for you.",1215388800,3,152,3.903225806451613
8211566,1,B000TZN7MO,"This is the perfect movie for a horney 14 year old to sneak by his over protective mother who found his dirty magazine collection. Its nothing more than Hot chick's striking poses  naked with Kung Fo fighting scattered here and there. The only positive of this movie was the outtakes, and the ""child beater"" clip. Don't waste your money on this one!",1213833600,8,349,4.629032258064516
