6929653,5,B00REG9G12,I have purchased multiple copies of this inspirational DVD by Desi Bartlett in order to share her powerful prenatal yoga technique with all the expecting moms in my life. This practice made my recent pregnancy smooth and kept me fit and strong!,1428537600,,244,4.833333333333333
6929654,5,B00REG9G12,Excellent DVD.  Easy to follow. Great benefits from making it my routine.,1428537600,,73,5.083333333333333
6929655,5,B00REG9G12,"This DVD comes from a very passionate and talented MOTHER. We were pregnant at the same time with Desi and I took her actual class weekly during my whole pregnancy. Now that my sister is also pregnant, I got her the DVD as she lives in Europe. This is an essential tool for any expectant ladies to get physically and mentally ready to become a mother.",1428537600,,351,4.333333333333333
6929656,5,B00REG9G12,"I really enjoy the clear, intelligent instructions. The Moms are inspiring, and the babies in the bonus section are adorable!",1427846400,,125,5.3
6929657,1,B00REG9G12,"My review is based simply on my personal preferences, not the overall quality of the video.  I don't really enjoy the demeanor of the main teacher in this video.  She moves through poses much too quickly and the yoga practice is over in about 18-19 minutes.  This is NOT a beginner's yoga practice either.  There are several parts where extreme flexibility/strength are required to follow the practice.  There were a few poses I really didn't think were pregnancy appropriate: twists from a lying on back position and bridge pose from lying on back position, both of these plus a standing cow pose were very uncomfortable and inappropriate with the pregnant body.  I have a couple other prenatal yoga DVDs, and those offer way better guidance for the pregnancy body, allow for slower movement (especially when standing up from a folded or sitting position), and show more use of bolsters and towels.  This one only showed a few mods with bricks, not enough.",1442016000,,957,4.87037037037037
6929658,5,B00REG9G12,Love it!,1440288000,,8,3.5
6929659,1,B00REG9G12,too fast and intense,1440115200,,20,4.25
6929660,5,B00REG9G12,Fantastic dvd for starting out in yoga! It gives you a choice to do a cool workout or a high intensity one! I combined it with a prenatal Pilates dvd and jut after one session my back and tight legs feel 10000 times better!,1437091200,,223,4.090909090909091
6929661,3,B00REG9G12,Admittedly I ordered this too late in pregnancy. I'm in my third trimester and have not been active. Even the third trimester modifications (many of which you need blocks for) were too challenging. I'm sure this is a great program for those who have been active.,1436486400,5,262,4.717391304347826
6929662,4,B00REG9G12,"It seems like a great video to know what prenatal moves you should be doing, but I'm not a big fan of her talking all the time and the music. I tend to use yoga as exercise and to relax, this video does not allow you to meditate because she talks way too much. I'll probably learn the moves and then silence her once I get the hang of it.",1435536000,3,338,3.842857142857143
6929663,5,B00REG9G12,My favorite prenatal teacher. Beautiful sequencing! Invigorating practice.,1434499200,,74,8.375
6929664,3,B00REG9G12,It's a decent yoga class. I have to watch it on mute though. The music is outright jarring. Like an 80's aerobics class electronic and very fast paced. If you are looking for a mind body exercise or a way to wind down since booze and such are off limits I would look elsewhere.,1432771200,,277,4.148148148148148
6929665,5,B00REG9G12,"Desi makes it look easy, yet she's created a challenging yoga workout & guides you through grace. ",1431993600,,98,4.764705882352941
6929666,5,B00REG9G12,"Amazing! Desi is an incredible instructor with so much knowledge about the body, women's health and wellness.
This is a must have for every mommy, whether first time or not.  The guidance in this strengthening to body, mind and heart, with such clear direction in learning how to listen to your body and your baby. Definitely giving as a gift to prego mommy friends.",1431561600,,366,4.71875
6929667,5,B00REG9G12,"Desi is an amazing teacher and her passion to help people shows through in everything she does. Her videos are well done and created with the user in mind, especially mommies.",1431475200,,175,4.67741935483871
6929668,5,B00REG9G12,Fantastic!  Desi really knows what the pregnant body needs and how it can move!!,1431475200,,80,4.714285714285714
6929669,5,B00REG9G12,"Cannot say enough how much I love this DVD! I love to work out, but tend to be less motivated when pregnant.  This is a fun but powerful workout that is also very stress-relieving and helps open up your body.  I tend to have babies who like to stay in the same position, and I can only do cat-cow so many times!

I absolutely love doing the mommy and me bonus segment with my baby.  She giggles with delight, and I am getting to be a #StrongerMom!",1431388800,2,447,4.103448275862069
6929670,5,B00REG9G12,Desi is an inspiring mommy of two and dedicated Yoga teacher. I've enjoyed her prenatal and mommy and baby postnatal classes with my first born. Looking forward to return to class after my second daughter is born!,1431388800,,213,4.783783783783784

6929672,5,B00REG9G12,"You can tell how passionate Desi is about prenatal health and taking care of yourself. She is a fantastic yoga instructor with a heart of gold and such a pro, she'll blend between being your teacher and wanting her as a best friend, she's that genuine! You could not go wrong with her program, she is gentle, informative and thorough.",1431388800,,334,4.583333333333333
6929673,5,B00REG9G12,Desi is amazing at what she does.  A true Yoga professional who knows women!,1431388800,,76,4.428571428571429

6929675,5,B00REG9G12,"Desi Bartlett is AMAZING !!! I am fortunate enough to know her personally  She is so knowledgeable and full of TONS of insight . As a birth doula we share a lot of clients and I have to say the ones that take her class and do this DVD happen to totally ROCK it at birth ! These women are totally in-touch with their bodies and babies , are calmer , sleep better , happier , healthier , stronger and have less pregnancy aches and pains during their pregnancy. One of the first things I suggest that  all my moms to be do is buy This AMAZING DVD and practice yoga with Desi as often as possible ! I can't recommend this DVD enough for all you pregnant goddesses !!! Lori Bregman",1429056000,2,676,4.113636363636363
6929676,5,B00REG9G12,Desi is the best prenatal teacher I have ever worked with! Her video is amazing! I highly recommend it!!!!!,1428796800,,107,4.684210526315789
8695236,1,B00REG9G12,Very slow and not challenging at all.,1495065600,,37,4.428571428571429
8695237,2,B00REG9G12,"The hot momma section is very short, and for me doesn't do a lot of poses that are great for pregnancy. I don't particularly enjoy the teacher either.",1492300800,,150,4.392857142857143
8695238,4,B00REG9G12,Yiga is always good during pregnancy and the DVD is perfect during the 3 trimesters,1477699200,,83,4.6
8695239,4,B00REG9G12,"Workouts are good, a lot of downward dog! And try to learn the routine as soon as possible so you can mute her. She speaks way too much in a high pitched voice- not a soothing yoga voice.",1469491200,,187,3.9473684210526314
8695240,5,B00REG9G12,"When I do both the ""Hot Mama"" and the ""Cool Mama"" routines, it genuinely gives me an energy boost.  I don't think the DVD would be that useful for 1st trimester/very fit people - but I've enjoyed it for 2nd and 3rd trimester, when the belly has become an impedance.",1459987200,,265,4.3
8695241,2,B00REG9G12,"I purchased this DVD because it was cheap and I was looking for some new prenatal workouts to change up my routine. The DVD completely stopped playing after about five uses. I have been doing yoga for about six years and I thought the workouts were too short and not challenging enough for me. Instead, I just do my regular yoga DVD that I've had for years and modify it as the pregnancy progresses.",1458691200,,399,4.405405405405405
8695242,1,B00REG9G12,"This is the third prenatal yoga video I have returned and hated. This monster isn't pregnant and is telling you way too enthusiastically to ""breathe to your baby"". She is annoying and you will be full of hormonal rage instantly. The music sounds like a B- porno movie and is super loud over the voices. It's gross and I was actually more tense and sore after I was done with this torture. This is an insult to my intelligence and uterus.",1447545600,2,437,4.407407407407407
8695243,2,B00REG9G12,"I'm not a fan of the woman who runs this video.  I find her voice and approach to be a bit abrasive.  Instead of having a nice, soothing yoga experience, I ended up having to turn the video off part-way through.  Even my husband was grimacing when I had it on.  I probably won't be using this video again.",1444608000,,305,4.11864406779661
8695244,3,B00REG9G12,"I'm so sad, the Strong Mama workout doesn't have audio, I can see the video but no what she is saying during the workout. The warm up, cool mama and cool down videos are fine. I can't do the strong mama if I can't hear a thing about how to breath or when to stand up or when to change to another  pose... so dissapointed.",1444435200,,321,3.9384615384615387
8695245,5,B00REG9G12,One of my favorite DVDs - I have given this to many people as gifts and they always LOVE it!,1443398400,,92,3.65
