I feel i am being generous giving it a three star rating. The VS 2400 is a fairly deep machine,with far more features than were covered on this DVD.This certainly did not help me beyond the owners manual,or appendices.",1370649600,2,392,4.171052631578948
8516200,2,B000BS2V08,"A guy in our band bought the 2480 to record our cd, Noiseful Joy. The manual is thicker than a family Bible and takes just about as long to read and understand. This recorder was obviously created by some really brilliant people from Roland, but I don't think the common man was considered as the end user. As a result, even with this dvd, trying to explain such a complicated machine, you still need more smarts than more than one of us who viewed the dvd and manual many times.
In all fairness, we use the digital mixer section of the 2480 as a rehearsal board now and that portion is fairly straight forward.",1247788800,4,611,4.368421052631579
