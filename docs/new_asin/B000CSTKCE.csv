(Oh - and an extra episode which I almost missed with a philosophical exposition on the nature of time.) Brilliant! Quite, quite brilliant!!",1280966400,3,308,4.9423076923076925
8101927,5,B000CSTKCE,"Otogi Zoshi is definitely one of my favourite animes.

The story centres around Hikaru, an aristocratic girl, who masquerades as her brother and finds herself drawn into the complex political stuggles taking place around her. It's set in the Heian period, so it's a time when traditional values of honour and responsibility dominate. The plot begins as an adventure style story, as Hikaru and her companions are sent to search for the `magatama', magical stones that are believed to have the power to save the Capital.

Don't let that put you off though! The story isn't drawn out at all- the plot is fast moving and remains interesting throughout. The characters are also very well developed, Hikaru, as well as the supporting characters around her. Finally the artwork and character designs are really beautiful.

Overall, Otogi Zoshi is quite a short series (it has 6 volumes in total). In case anyone is confused let me just explain: there are two story arcs containing 13 episodes each (making a total of 26 episodes). The first half of episodes make up the Heian arc and then comes the Tokyo arc. The arcs are related but self contained- I don't want to give away anything else about the plot, but on the whole, the series is well thought out and really has a lot of depth.

I really love and definitely recommend this anime!",1261612800,6,1331,4.748917748917749

8101929,4,B000CSTKCE,"I bought this series on the presumption that it was all historical but half way through the series it switches to modern day Tokyo, this isn't a bad point, just a very interesting plot twist. This was an intriguing series but not quite what i was expecting, for the most part, it is well animated, its by production IG, and the detial is quite nice too. I was expecting something alot more politically heavy than i found because of reviews i read but instead found a spiritual mystery with a good measure of heian period politics mixed in for good measure lol. All that aside i liked it, its not as cerebral as i would have liked but good none the less. The characters are well realised and the way they interact is quite good too, i have quite a soft spot for Kintaro... This is not comparable to ninja scroll, both entirely different except for the the time period. Basically, if you want something a bit different from the normal samurai slasher give this a look, its worth your time.",1155081600,11,987,4.458563535911602
