7840652,5,6303191754,"I recorded this on VHS when it originally aired back in the early nineties and watched them all with my sisters and Mom.  Not even they could wrap their minds around all of the social issues, outcomes and the implications throughout the last century.  But this puts them into perspective from a first person frame of mind.  The story is told through 5 generations of women.  It is honestly one of the most influential documentaries I have ever seen, and it is now over 20 years old.  A must see!!!",1433030400,,497,4.477777777777778
7840653,3,6303191754,Interesting and informative..............all lost with the narration by a traitor!  How could she be allowed to be involved in this production?  Totally discredits women that should be admired for thier accomplihments,1339632000,,217,5.967741935483871
7840654,5,6303191754,"This video series is fun, interesting, and has inforation I haven't seen anywhere else. It's amazing that girls graduate High School learning about discrimination based upon race, religion, and sexual orientation...yet we're taught so little about women history. Maybe that's because sexual discrimination is a big part of women's history, and schools aren't prepared to acknowledge that. This video collection is a must. Also has rewatchability.",1283472000,,446,5.7727272727272725
