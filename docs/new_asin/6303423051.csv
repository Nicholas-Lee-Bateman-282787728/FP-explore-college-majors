The DVD film is a factual aocuunt of the deploymemt and fighting of allied troops written by the allies supreme commader.",1314921600,,196,5.354838709677419
640061,3,6303423051,"This film was made in 1948 to 1949. I am a fan of World War II videos and books (my father was in the pentagon during the war and had met Eisenhower several times).
Some episodes give very short shrift to the whole scope of what is going on, but I guess that's understandable for its time, and perspective.
My husband is also an Eisenhower fan... and was a young medical student at Walter Reed when Eisenhower was there for his final days.",1427760000,,439,4.301204819277109
640062,5,6303423051,Given the age of the documentary this is absolutely first rate.,1424476800,,63,4.818181818181818
640063,5,6303423051,"I ordered this product on Dec. 20. I kept checking the delivery status and after the second day it showed ""a carrier delay with your product"". I was ready to call Customer Service then thr status changed to ""will be delivered on time"". I received it on Dec. 23. Now for as far as this product I remember seeing episodes back in the 1970's but not too often. Recently episodes have been shown in order on Military Channel (now called American Heroes Channel). I knew then I had to buy this. There are 26 episodes on 6 DVD's around 20 minutes each. I kind of thought they were longer. It follows General Dwight D. Eisenhower's book of the same name as he talks about World War 2. The narrator is Westbrook Van Vorhuis and someone who does the actual quotes from the book speaking as General Eisenhower I believe it is Maurice Joyce (it even sounds like him). There is footage I have never seen before in 90% of the set and I love history so if you like history and seeing new stuff this is something you should buy.",1419465600,2,1013,4.336842105263158
640064,4,6303423051,A great view of WWII Europe from Eisenhower's point of view.  Not in depth but added to my knowledge base.  Pity that it was only available in VHS.,1392940800,2,147,4.214285714285714
640065,5,6303423051,I cannot say anything against President Eisenhower. He explains his handling of a very difficult job in a clear manner.,1385424000,,119,5.0
640066,3,6303423051,"When this first aired in '49, I remember it as one hour episodes (including commercials).  My memory may be bad.
It has great historical value for later generations that need an understanding of the events that lead to was because many of the same things are happening today.",1377216000,,275,4.729166666666667
640067,5,6303423051,"I never got to see CRUSADE IN EUROPE when it was broadcast, owing to the fact that I was born six years after it was shown on ABC. But it was a series I'd heard about for decades as the grandfather and template for such celebrated (and more often re-shown) efforts as VICTORY AT SEA, THE WORLD AT WAR, THE COMMANDERS etc. This DVD set finally allowed me to see the series, and it was not a disappointment -- working with the visual materials that were available (a fraction of what producers of THE WORLD AT WAR would have at their disposal), the makers succeed in telling their story, and the little personal quotations from Eisenhower's book add a unique perspective to the proceedings. Some of the technique is primitive by today's standards, and this is a sanitized look at the costs and horrors of the war -- home audiences in 1949 were not prepared for footage that was too graphic -- but well worth seeing.

Additionally, the materials seem to be in excellent condition -- the owners of this series have kept it in better shape than, say, NBC kept VICTORY AT SEA (a roughly comparable documentary series from about three years later), albeit with some upgrade and alteration in the late 1980s. MPI has also mastered the program with a good deal of satisfying consistency in the sound and image quality, and the discs are very handy to use, the programs easy to access etc. It's all a pleasure to watch, and if it gets some people to look a little longer at Eisenhower (and perhaps buy his book, which is still in print in 2013), so much the better -- we'll never know how good a battlefield commander or combat officer he might have been, but he was one of the great leaders and organizers in the history of the United States, in addition to being a great president (recognition for which seems finally to be coming his way in the twenty-first century).",1367020800,6,1860,4.535714285714286
640068,5,6303423051,"Being familiar with Ike's book, I wanted to add this DvD to my collection. I've read reviews stating the DvD was a let down and not recommending a purchase. This collection MUST be viewed in proper historical perspective to be truly appreciated.

First, one must realize when this was produced...shortly after the war. America was fresh off a horrible conflict in which many young men lost their lives. The images of wounded and killed American soldiers was deemed too gruesome for public consumption. It was a different time, long before our minds had been numbed to the daily grind of shocking news reports and the accompanying images.

Second, much of the footage now seen in various documentaries and productions simply had not been discovered. Most archives of Nazi regime propaganda and combat was not available...it was either classified or unknown at the time. They incorporated what footage was both available and palatable.

Third...this series was made for television. TV was in it's infancy. It would be almost 15 years before it was even 'acceptable' for a married couple to be seen sharing the same bed on a television show. Blood and guts were not acceptable TV material for the time.

In proper context, this is an EXCELLENT collection. I would highly recommend for the serious enthusiast.",1351468800,17,1305,5.027777777777778
640069,5,6303423051,"I'd agree with Mr Wolfe that this is remarkably fair, considering when it was made. It is a dispassionate account of men getting on with a job that had to be done. The footage is superb, much of it new to me; names are pronounced correctly, something you don't always find in modern documentaries; and aspects which are often overlooked, such as supply, are well covered.

I bought this for my dad's birthday and we have greatly enjoyed watching it together. My mother has even joined us and found it interesting. A very good buy indeed.",1338249600,9,537,4.59375
640070,5,6303423051,This wonderful documentry based on President & General Eisenhower's book of the same name is excellent of the time (1951) utilizing film footage from all participants archives and produced by Time Magazine. Yes a little one sided in the commentary but considering that at that time we were engaged again on forign soil (Korea)and it was barely 6 years after WWII ended I think it is still fair in its accessments. The DVD arrived in a timely manner int the described condition. Very Pleased.,1331424000,3,491,4.857142857142857

7845906,5,6303423051,I was born after WWII. I am a military vet who's mother was born in Germany pre nazi takeover. I heard the stories about the war from her. I was born in Germany on a military base. My father a Korean War Vet. While growing up this series was on television and I saw bits and pieces of it as a child growing up in NYC. I read the book a paperback edition and pictured it in my head as I read it. But these dvds bring it to life as Gen Eisenhower saw and lived it. Great addition to anyone's library,1509408000,,497,3.8823529411764706
7845907,5,6303423051,Wonderful.  Eisenhower's book transferred to the small screen.,1507420800,,62,6.75
7845908,5,6303423051,Recommend reading the book first. Video is a compilation of the movies News Reels taken at the time during WW II. Roughly follows book but not exactly Book better. No regrets,1488844800,,174,4.645161290322581

7845911,4,6303423051,Good Program for general audiences.  Transfer to DVD from original 16mm film is pretty good.  Age of this 1950's film shows through with some noise (to be expected) from the optical sound track.,1441584000,,194,4.848484848484849
7845912,5,6303423051,"My Son loaned me one of the 2-disk sets, and I KNEW I had to the rest! An exceptional resource for WWII buffs.",1432944000,,110,3.8260869565217392
7845913,3,6303423051,It was not as interesting or complete as I thought it would be - some decent war footage to be sure - good reproduction - really not worth the price I paid however.,1431388800,,164,4.0
7845914,1,6303423051,"This series is patterned after the Crusade In The Pacific series which consists of about 26, 22 minute segments which have some pretty interesting footage of actual Pacific combat and can be picked up for about $7.95. If you're expecting to see actual combat footage in this series you will be in for a major disappointment. It's overly heavy on background information and filler, and about only actual WW II footage is GI's filling sand bags. Much of it is reenactments. I've purchased a number of WW II documentaries and this was a huge disappointment, especially considering the cost. Don't waste your money. Too bad Gen. Eisenhower's name is attached to it.",1428969600,,661,4.910714285714286
