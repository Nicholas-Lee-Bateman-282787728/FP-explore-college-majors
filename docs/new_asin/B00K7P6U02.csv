These are foreign so I had to buy her a multi-region Code Zone Free DVD player to play them on.  There's a Samsung one on Amazon that's not too expensive, but unfortunately it proved to be too much of a hassle for my mom to use, too complicated or something, so she never really ended up using it.  I didn't think it was that complicated, but then again I'm 30 and she's 70.

Now she's back to watching re-runs on YouTube, so I guess this wasn't a great purchase unfortunately. But that wasn't any fault of the videos so I'm not dinging stars for that.  The videos were decent quality. Just didn't work out for us.",1505001600,,835,4.348387096774194
