5087492,3,B007I1Q4PY,"I had been looking forward to the release of this set for a while now, and was anticipating the match listing since I heard the WWE was going to have this dvd set released. Unfortunately after seeing this, I have to say I'm very disappointed that a lot of Actual good street fights/ No DQ matches were left off this list. Here are some that I think should of been on this dvd set:

The Rock vs Mankind (Empty Arena Match Halftime Heat 1999)- You want to talk about Falls Count Anywhere, this is a match that exemplifies it very well. Since the WWE was so cool to watch back then, the WWE decided to show a match during the halftime of the Super Bowl in what was called an Empty Arena Match. Now even though I thought this was a great clash between The Rock and Mankind in their feud, that doesn't mean that it had flaws, or in this case, a MAJOR FLAW. The problem with this match that most people remember is that it truly showed how ""fake"" the WWE was by basically shooting the entire last bit like it was done out of some very crappy hollywood movie in which fixed shots were used at the end of the match that would basically impossible to do in real life. While this is a big flaw, it still is a good match overall between these two.

Cactus Jack vs Triple H (Royal Rumble 2000 Street Fight)- There are two matches that I feel show what a street fight is supposed to be, and this is one of them. Even though this seems to have been released on almost every single WWE dvd set since the match happened, this is still the quintessential of what a WWE Street Fight is all about. There was brawling, Holy **** spots (especially with the Barbed wire 2x4 and thumbtacks), ""storytelling"", and of course a lot of blood (specifically from Triple H). This is what a street fight was almost all about. And the fact that it's not included in the Greatest Street Fights and Out of Control Matches is nothing short of a contradiction.

Steve Blackmon vs Shane McMahon (Summerslam 2000)- Now even though this was rather a lackluster match that just featured Blackmon getting beat up by Test and Albert (known by most WWE fans as either A-Train or Lord Tensai), this did include one of the more infamous bumps in wrestling history in which shane would climb the top of the titantron of Summerslam, and then be kendo sticked off from blackmon all the way down into what appeared to be a table/air cushion thing. The bump was unbelievable and something that I wouldn't forget.

Shane McMahon vs Vince McMahon (Wrestlemania 17)- Now usually if you were to see a street fight (or any match really) with Vince involved, it usually sucks, except for three matches, two of which are not on the set. one of them is this one. this had a great build up for it, especially the week leading up to Wrestlemania when it was revealed that Shane McMahon had bought WCW right from under his father's shoes. This match was actually a good brawl between father and son as they did some pretty incredible spots for this match, including a moment when shane goes coast to coast from one side of the ring to the other just to impale his father with a trash can. It was an actual god match that should be on this list.

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Rock (Wrestlemania 17)- Most people say that out of all of the matches that The Rock and Stone Cold competed in, this one was the best of them all. These guys fought from start to finish in a fast paced and non stop action brawl through which it seemed like it would never end. Both guys get busted open in the brawl, and at the end of it Austin wins, but in more than controversial fashion.

Shane McMahon vs Kurt Angle (King of the Ring 2001)- As I said before there are two matches that I feel show what a street fight is all about. This is the other match I was referencing too. Kurt Angle and Shane McMahon literally destroyed each other to put on a good show for the fans, and it truly was one of the best matches that I had ever seen. These guys beat the crap out of each other with kendo sticks, trash cans, and countless of other weapons. This match also leads to a very sick moment in which Shane and Kurt are fighting right by the entrance, and Kurt tries a belly to belly on shane and tries to throw him through the KOTR glass. Now before I talk about that moment, Shane had suplexed Kurt on the rug on the entrance way to the ring. when this happened Kurt supposedly broke his tailbone, so now while the belly to belly did happen, the glass didn't break because Kurt didn't have enough momentum to throw Shane through. So instead of Shane flying through the glass, he instead landed right on his head, which lead to a thud that people could hear through the whole arena. It was unbelievable that these two guys even continued as long as they did after those two moments alone, but as the match went on, you could tell they were putting on an instant classic. I can't recommend this match enough to people that have not seen this yet and people should go and try and find this match by any means.

Eddie Guerrero vs Edge (Smackdown 2002)-  This was probably one of the best executed Street Fights that I had ever seen between two wrestlers. These two just kept the action going to a point where you thought there was not one dull spot in the entire match. It was very fast paced and also had a ton of good ""weapon"" moments, especially with the ladder. This was a good Street Fight to see.

Vince McMahon vs Hulk Hogan (Wrestlemania 19)- Like I said before, any matches with Vince McMahon involved usually turns out awful, but like I said there are two matches not on this set that were done incredibly well, and this is the other one. This was the feud that most people had awaited for quite a while since Vince and Hogan's very bad falling out in 1993 thanks to the ""Steroid"" trial. So this was a highly anticipated match to see whether or not Vince would end Hulkamania for good, or if the Hulkster would live forever. The brawl wasn't so much the weapons fest that I remember, but it did have some cool spots like when Vince did Hogan's leg drop off the ladder and onto the announce table, and when Roddy Piper showed up and smacked Hogan across the head with a lead pipe.

Edge vs Matt Hardy (RAW 2005)- The last one that I think should of been on this list had to be this matchup between Edge and Matt Hardy. Stil in the middle of the controversial Love Triangle between Edge, Matt Hardy, and Lita, these guys had an awesome brawl which ended in a no contest when Hardy did a side effect off the side of the stage and onto an electrical table below and both competitors couldn't continue with the fight. This was basically the climax almost of their feud and it was very cool to do it like that in a street fight.

Well that's my list of street fights that should of been added onto it, if anyone else has an opinion please feel free to comment

Now overall i'm still going to get the set only because there are a couple of matches that have never been released that are finally getting released on dvd, unfortunately though I know I will be disappointed with the set because of the fact that most of these matches will not be included. Hopefully there will be a second volume someday to where people can see these matches.",1339200000,4,7255,4.330389992641648

I'm close to being a 30 yr. fan of wrestling, so unfortunately, I've seen just about everything on this collection thanks to the fact that the majority of this collection contains matches from the late 90's to today. I would've loved to have seen more classic footage from the 70's and 80's. However, I'm thrilled to see that they've included Patterson vs Slaughter in this set. I've never seen it, but I've wanted to every since Jim Ross put it over as a classic in one of the WWE's Legends of Wrestling roundtable discussions. Also, it's nice to see Bret vs Austin from Raw on here, I haven't seen that since it's original air date. It'll also be nice to have Sting vs Cactus Jack from Beach Blast with it's original commentary. This match was an extra on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Mick-Foley-Greatest-Hits-Misses-A-Life-in-Wrestling/dp/B000MGBLVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE: Mick Foley Greatest Hits & Misses - A Life in Wrestling</a>&nbsp;but they used new commentary from Mick and Coach that you couldn't turn off in order to hear the original commentary track. Beyond that, there's nothing for me to get excited about here since I've seen or own the other matches on other various DVDs and Blu-rays. Still, it's a great collection with some amazing matches that newer fans should go out of their way to see. For example, if you've never seen Triple H vs Shawn Michaels from SummerSlam '02, I can't recommend that one enough, it's a classic street fight!",1339113600,35,4259,4.961810466760962

5087523,4,B007I1Q4PY,"This is a great purchase hosted by Mick Foley in a studio set up like a back alley. If you like not only falls count anywhere but also NO holds barred & NO DQ then you'll love this 3 disc set. Plenty of variety from the early '80s with Sergeant Slaughter V Pat Patterson a street fight that was a very unique match for the time as it was a blood bath. The Starcade '85 tag team match between the Midnight Express (they were dressed in tuxedo's, but not for long) managed by Jim Cornette v Jimmy Valiant & Miss Atlanta Lively (Ronnie Garvin in drag). This was an entertaining match in and out of the ring with action everywhere and plenty of funny moments with not only blood flying but Miss Atlanta Lively hitting the Midnight Express with a handbag and powder, even Jim Cornette's Tennis racket gets involved at some stage. Other highlights include Brett Hart v Stone Cold Steve Austin in a street fight on RAW, this was a great match in that Austin was attacked by Owen Hart & British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith and then it was 3 on 1 with Brett entering the ring, however this only brought out the best and worse in Stone Cold. Suffice to say Stone Cold is thrown out of the building by Gorilla Monsoon but all is not what it seems, Brett & Steve had a great rivalry at that time. Another highlight for me was the match between Al Snow and Hardcore Bob Holly that went not only throughout the arena but ended up on the banks of, and also, in the Mississippi River, no kidding. Vince McMahon v Shane McMahon, Test v Shane McMahon, Vince McMahon v Ric Flair were other notable matches as was the tag match between D Generation X v Legacy that went throughout the arena.

Alley Fight Match: Pat Patterson vs. Sgt. Slaughter - This was a first of it's kind for this era of wrestling & a match that's still rare to happen today as this was a come as your dress street fight but the special catch here was that there was no referee in this match either. Patterson worked over Slaughter using his cowboy boots to stomp & his belt before Slaughter was able to regain control & use the belt to his advantage to choke Pat. Just like an alley fight, this eventually became a fist fight to the point where Slaughter was heavily bleeding. This was a physically violent match for it's time & still stands out today.
""MSG"" May '81

Atlanta Street Fight: Jimmy Valiant & Ms. Atlanta Lively vs. Midnight Express - For those who couldn't already figure it out, Ms. Lively isn't a natural woman or a transvestite but a ""rugged"" man in drag who's ""hands are hard as stone"" while the Midnight Express were dressed in tuxedos for some reason. Ms. Lively started the fight blinding people with powder while Jimmy took the fight to the outside & front row of the crowd using whatever he could get his hands on including a chair while the Express were literally getting beaten out of their clothes. The Express eventually were able to divide & conquer by keeping Jimmy on the outside while beating down Lively on the inside with everyone ended up bleeding at the end of the match with Cornette getting a shot in but paying for it later. For it's time, this was an entertaining match.
NWA Starrcade '85

Street Fight Match: NWA Tag Team Champions Doom vs. Barry Windham & Arn Anderson - This was a rare type of match during it's time as both Doom & Horsemen members were heels with both teams dressed in their street clothes. This was an all out brawl with both men using everything they were able to from leather belts, weight belts, and chairs while fighting in the ring to the outside to the rampway. Both teams were no strangers to dirty tactics like low blows with even Windham ended up being busted open. This was such a brawl that even Doom's manager Teddy Long knew better than to just stay back & not get involved like he usually does.
WCW Starrcade '90

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Sting vs. Cactus Jack - These men had an issue with each other dating back months that's been so heated to the point where they didn't even make it to the ring to start the match as Foley attacked Sting on the ramp only for Sting to respond with a backdrop & face plant on the ramp. Cactus focused on the ribs that Sting had previously injured against Vader with moves like the elbow drop off the apron, chairshots to the back & later applying the body scissors. Sting continued to fight Cactus at his own game with fighting on the outside & in the crowd dishing out the punishment like a suplex on the concrete, dishing out his own chairshots, and taking risk like a clothesline off the top rope onto the ramp. This match was what Mick Foley considered the greatest in his career for over 4 years & it was definitely a quality encounter.
WCW Beach Blast '92
[Bonus Section Of ""Mick Foley: Greatest Hits & Misses""]

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Randy Savage vs. Crush - Despite what type of match this was called, this was held under Texas Death Match rules where you had to score the pinfall first & then whoever lost the fall had 10 seconds to return to the ring or lose the match. With this situation being so personal between the two for months, Savage didn't wait until Crush made it to the ring as he attacked him the moment he walked through the entrance way only for Crush to overpower Savage & drop him on the guardrail. This match had it's various moments like Crush's attempt to use salt blow up in this face, Mr. Fuji getting involved various times including what he had to do to revive Crush at one point, the ringpost & steps being used at ringside and both men fighting to the backstage area. This was a good match to finish their long standing feud but mostly remembered for being Randy Savage's last appearance at WrestleMania.
WrestleMania X

Chicago Street Fight Match: Booker T & Sting Vs. Road Warriors - The setup for this match was unusual as Sting & Lex Luger were WCW Tag Team Champions with Luger making the challenge for this match only to be pulled out it by his then-manager Jimmy Hart leaving Sting without a partner so Booker T agreed to team with Sting under the condition that his team of Harlem Heat gets a title shot if they win. This started in the isleway with the brawling going in & out of the ring including the Doomsday Cage at the entrance being used. Both teams took as much as they gave with both teams being victims of low blows, a chair & broom being used as weapons while just beating on each other into almost exhaustion. Half of the fight ended up going backstage where more people got involved & being the major factor in what turned out to really be a very physical texas tornado style match.
WCW Uncensored '96

Chicago Street Fight Match: Ahmed Johnson & Legion Of Doom vs. Nation Of Domination - Ahmed's feud with the Nation going on for so long that he finally got partners for this match in the Legion Of Doom returning to WWE in their hometown of Chicago as The Nation came out with various weapons while L.O.D. brought out the kitchen sink. Nation members D-Lo Brown & PG-13 were sacrificed early with even Clarence Mason getting nailed for his troubles before the brawl completely erupted as there was brawling all over the place from the ring, ringside, isleway, and the front row with the weapons being used such as trash cans, wooden boards, Marlena's chair, road sign, nightstick, announcers table, rope, and even the fire extinguisher to the point where it caused the announcers at ringside to feel the effects. This was violent to the point where Faarooq was injured with a separated shoulder for weeks as a result.
WrestleMania 13

Street Fight Match: Steve Austin vs. Bret Hart - The feud between these had been going on for so long that it finally came down to this with Bret getting the advantage early thanks to some help before he tried to give Austin a taste of ""deja vu"" for what he did to another close Hart associate before Austin took advantage of Bret's miscalculation opened the door for Austin to attack both Bret's wrist & knee punishing Bret until it took a host of officials for him to stop. Quality wise this was easily the weakest match they ever did but reality is that it's more of a segment For Bret to be out of action for the next few months but stay tuned afterwords as they show the aftermath throughout the night from involving Gorilla Monsoon confronting Austin along with Bret's ambulance ride from hell.
""RAW"" Apr. '97

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Cactus Jack vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley - This was originally scheduled to be Dude Love participating but thanks to an entertaining video the the ""3 Faces Of Foley"", we saw the WWE debut of Cactus Jack & started the match with a bang by nailing Hunter in the head with the trash can followed by a neckbreaker on the concrete floor. Both men fought backstage & back to the ring with Chyna making her presence known while Cactus used the fire extinguisher & even breaking the guardrail before missing a move that caused him to land on the metal trash can. Hunter showed he was no stranger to dishing out the offense himself as he used a mop handle, chair, snow shovel, and trash can while suplexing Cactus on the metal ramp but it was when they made their way to the top of the entrance where a piledriver was given that you can to see to believe. Definitely one of the wildest brawls in RAW history.
""RAW"" Sept. '97
[Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses]

Falls Count Anywhere Death Match: FTW Champion Taz Vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - For those who don't know the story behind the FTW Championship, it was Taz's personal championship he created to spite the company due to not getting a title shot against ECW Champion Shane Douglas despite the fact that Douglas was out with an injury. This was the rematch from Living Dangerously as Douglas was on commentary for this match was Bigelow was a fellow member of the Triple Threat faction. You know the direction this was going when Bigelow powerbombed Taz in the first few seconds only for Taz to get right up & deliever two strong clotheslines before taking Bigelow down with a samoan drop. They fought onto the rampway & through the crowd where chairs & guardrails where used as Taz kept focusing on using submissions. They made their way back to the ring where both men were victims of a table including Taz being busted open before making their way to the ramp again where a strong impact was felt on both men. Both men put in a strong performance here with Douglas only adding to the feel of the match on commentary.

Hardcore Championship Match: Al Snow vs. Hardcore Holly - Road Dogg had to forfeit the title due to injury setting up this match between the former J.O.B. Squad members. The match made it's way into the crowd & backstage early as both men used whatever they could get their hands on from the fire extinguisher, glass, trash cans, floor tiles, metal trays, mops, and even a payphone. The fight continued to outside of the building & made it's way to the Mississippi River where both men continued to use whatever they could from road signs to a wheelbarrow, and even the camera getting hit with a broken piece of wood. This was one of the most memorable matches in the history of that championship as this was the birth of ""Hardcore"" Holly.
St. Valentine's Day Massacre '99
[WWF Hardcore]

Strap Match: The Rock vs. Triple H - A ""forgotten"" match in the feud between Triple H & The Rock as this was to determine the challenger for the WWE Championship at SummerSlam that year...and your treated to a old school Rock promo before the match. This strap match didn't have the ""touch for corners"" rule in effect as it was Falls Count Anywhere. As you expect from a HHH/Rock match, this was wild from start to finish as they brawled through the crowd & ringside (with Rock even taking a special photo for a fan) and used the strap to their advantage to whip & choke their opposition. It was a good quality match that has been overshadowed by their other more memorable & better quality performances over the years.

Greenwich Street Fight Match: Test vs. Shane McMahon - The issues between both men came ahead here with the stipulation that Shane must stay out of the relationship between Test & his sister Stephanie if Test wins but Test & Stephanie were no longer allowed to see each other if Shane won. Test came into the match with ribs taped from a previous attack by Shane while Shane brought his own backup in the members of the Mean Street Posse at ringside who had been injured by Test throughout the previous weeks. Both men started off trading fist with Test getting the better hand using his power & even tossed Shane into the Posse before they got involved handing Shane various weapons to use & getting physically involved in the match various times helping Shane before Test had some allies come to his aid who also had unfinished business with the Mean Street Posse. This was a fun match.
SummerSlam '99

WWE Champion Big Show vs. Kane - Triple H & Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley were running the show at this time & put Kane in a must win situation here in that he must either win the WWE Championship or his girlfriend Tori must spend the holiday vacation with Kane's rival X-Pac. This was a basic match that saw some impressive offense by Kane including the flying clotheslines off the top to the floor & off the ringside barrier but eventually turned hardcore with Triple H & Stephanie constantly changing the rules to the match to ensure that both Show & Kane would just keep beating on each other. Chairs & steps were used while they fought through the crowd before it took one of them taking a big move through the announce table to gain the victory.
""RAW"" Dec. '99

Hardcore Champion Crash Holly vs. The Headbangers - During the period where Crash Holly was the champion defending the championship 24/7, matches took place all over the place from a circus to his hotel room to a laundry mat but this was probably the most famous one of these matches as it took place in the family fun center of Funtime U.S.A. as they went through the arcade & playpen complete with Jerry Lawler's ""Pacman"" sound effects.
""SmackDown"" Mar. '00
[WWF Hardcore]

Street Fight Match: Vince McMahon Vs. Shane McMahon - A rematch from their WrestleMania encounter earlier in the year with Vince starting out beating Shane on the outside with whatever he could get his hands on including a metal sign, the ring post, and a kendo stick while Shane was able to amount some offense of his own including using the trash can lid & TV monitor while also going aerial a few times sometimes hitting his target & missing the other times. Both members from the upcoming Survivor Series teams got involved with Shane's guarantee from earlier in the night of one man from Team WWE jumping to the WCW/ECW Alliance coming true.
""RAW"" Oct. '01

Street Fight Match: Ric Flair vs. Mr. McMahon - The storyline at this time was that both men were co-owners of the company and they just couldn't get along with anymore...and it should be noted that this was Flair's first wrestling match since his return to WWE months earlier in his old WCW/NWA stomping grounds of Atlanta. Vince overpowered & dominated Flair in the early moments. It was when Vince had busted him open that Flair just snapped & made his comeback. They used monitors & steel pipes while having their moments at ringside with Flair's daughter's camera. This was a good entertaining match.
Royal Rumble '02
[McMahon]

Street Fight Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H - Shawn Michaels in-ring return for the first time in over 4 years & didn't look like he missed a step in the opening moments by taking the fight right to Triple H starting with a dive onto him. Triple H however heavily focused on punishing HBK's back non-stop with backbreakers, chairs making his moves more impactful including a DDT that busted Shawn open, using Shawn's own belt buckle, abdominal stretch...it got to the point where referee Earl Hebner had to step in when Triple H was about to go too far. Shawn had to resort to some of his old dirty tactics to fight back & dish out punishment of his own including using the chair himself to make Triple H bleed, his belt, trash can lid, a boot from one of the announcers, table, and even pulled out a ladder. Shawn put in a performance that looked like he didn't miss a step at all in the four years while Triple H showcased why (politics aside) he's one of the best in-ring generals of this generation.
SummerSlam '02
[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels]

Street Fight Match: World Champion Triple H vs. Kevin Nash - Shawn Michaels was in Nash's corner while Ric Flair was in Triple H's in what started off as a normal match quickly turned into an unofficial tag with Flair & HBK getting so involved in the action that Flair was bleeding within the first few minutes & both men had to be taken backstage due to the excessive brawling while Nash & Triple H brawled up the ramp to the announce table area with a chair being used before the fight made it's way back to the ring. Triple H focused on Nash's bad knees while Nash kept using weapons like the steel steps to beat on Triple H & eventually causing him to be busted open as the match just erupted into non-stop chaos as Flair & HBK returned while referees were being knocked out left & right. Kevin Nash didn't really have a lot of positives going for him during this run in WWE (too many injuries & dropped storylines) but this was one of the best matches he had during this period.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Womens Champion Melina vs. Mickie James - Both girls had so much heat (both in front & behind the camera) that this match started off with a bang as Mickie dropkicked Melina while she was doing her split entrance as this went backstage quick to the makeup area & even the divas locker room where the other girls got involved & we saw a side of Candice Michelle that was definitely too ""RAW"" for live TV before the match eventually made it's way back down to the ring & ending with one of the scariest landings you can have in the ring. The match itself was short & sweet but every entertaining & aggressive for what it was.

Street Fight Match: Triple H vs. Umaga - This fight started in the isleway with both men crashing through the set before taking the fight into the crowd & back into the ring where a trash can came into play. Umaga targeted Triple H's ribs with moves like the big splash, samoan drop, and various bearhugs before Triple H resorted to dirty tactics & continued to use whatever he could get his hands on against Umaga including a DDT on a chair. The match got taken to the floor once again where they fought through each of the 3 announce tables with Umaga giving a version of the running splash you have to see to believe. Great brawl that including some good storytelling.
Cyber Sunday '07

Street Fight Match: John Cena vs. Umaga - Cena started out throwing punches to Umaga only for him to keep stopping him dead in his tracks every time with his power throughout this match as Cena took advantage of the street fight stipulation by brawling on the outside, using a chair, and even a microphone only for Umaga to either overpower him or just keep catching him like the sidewalk slam when Cena was coming off the top rope. While this match would look like the ""stereotypical"" Cena performance, I'll give credit here in that Cena sold the punishment he was given throughout the match with the story being that Umaga just kept staying one step ahead of him.

Submissions Count Anywhere Match: D-Generation X vs. The Legacy - This is the first of 3 different types of submission matches throughout the night with a special type of twist on a normal ""falls count anywhere"" match as for those who know their WWE history in regards to the city of Montreal, you'll get a laugh out of DX's introduction. As you expect in this match, more of the action happened outside of the ring than it did in the ring as they fought through the crowd, ringside, near the stage, backstage. Along with the normal submission moves you've seen in the past from DX like a figure four & even the crossface, you saw various unique types of submission moves both teams like Shawn doing a reverse dragon sleeper using the handrail in the isleway, DX using a boston crab/camel clutch combination, a variation of the Gory Guerrero backbreaker, and even Ted doing his dad's famous ""Million $ Dream"". This was the type of match that an unestablished team like Legacy NEED as they divided & conquered here resulting in them doing something that no other team before them as ever done.

Street Fight Match: Rey Mysterio vs. Batista - After Batista destroyed Mysterio at the previous S. Series PPV, he tried to use the hit & run offense here but Batista caught him with an impactful clothesline followed by powerful whip into the corner but Rey kept resorting to this speed trying to play the game of ""cat & mouse"" with it working against Batista at times only for him to use his power to stop his momentum dead in it's tracks & doing such things was whipping Mysterio with the television cables. Mysterio refused to quit & was even able to use a chair a few times but Batista still was an unstoppable force. This match did it's job in establishing Rey was the little man who won't give up against the unstoppable ""animal"" but outside of the chair being used in the end, this was more of a normal match than an actual street fight.

Street Fight Match: Randy Orton vs. Cody Rhodes - The final battle between the ex-Legacy members here as Cody came out with his baggers at ringside & the match made it's way to the floor in the opening moments with both men being thrown into the steps before taking the fight into the crowd with Cody eventually sacrificing his baggers just to get away from Orton. They brawled up the ramp to the isleway to the ring & back out to the announce tables with Cody targeting Orton's leg with a clip, stomps, and the figure four while also using his mask as a weapon various times. The was the final match in their feud against each other & definitely the best match in their series.

(Blu-Ray) Boiler Room Brawl Match: Mankind vs Santa Claus - In a nutshell, this was more of a segment than a match with DX taking advantage of Mankind's love for Christmas by having him fight a bunch of Santa Clause's along with the Mean Street Posse as well.

(Blu-Ray) Street Fight Match: Triple H vs. Sheamus - This was suppose to happen earlier in the night but Sheamus attacked Triple H on the way to the ring causing his arm & neck to be injured coming into the match. Triple H had vengeance on his mind as his completely dominated Sheamus in the opening moments & was close to making this a flawless victory before the effects of his hurt arm started to show. Sheamus worked over his neck throughout the match. Triple H was able to fight back with the help of a kendo stick but all his injuries & a heavy amounts of kicks to the head were just too much as Sheamus got the victory. Stay tuned afterwards as Triple H was down but not out until Sheamus put him out for good.

(Blu-Ray) Falls Count Anywhere Match: Rey Mysterio vs. Cody Rhodes - This turned into a brawl right away as they fought from the ring to the stage area very early in the match. The fight went into the crowd where Cody used the handrails in the middle of the isle to his advantage such as doing a modified version of Chris Jericho's old ""Liontamer"" submission with the railing. They fought into the lobby area or the arena before taking the match back to the ring with Rey being hip tossed over the rail onto the floor in the process. Cody went after Rey's face including slamming his face into the steps in this match before Mysterio did something that I don't remember seeing from him but got a ""Great Muta"" reference from Booker T in what turned out to be a great followup to their previous match at WrestleMania and SmackDown weeks later.

(Blu-Ray) Street Fight Match: Randy Orton vs Kane - Orton was frustrated for losing his World Championship to Christian earlier in the week by disqualification while Kane was trying to rediscover the monster he once was. Orton went for the RKO early on only to be shoved off & have the fight taken to the isleway where a kendo stick was brought into play. Orton was overpowered by Kane & attempted to chokeslam Orton though a table only for Orton to land on his feet onto of the table but get his leg caught as the table fell over which he tried to laugh off to no avail before he used the steps on Kane hurting his knees as well. Kane continued to fight on one leg with moves like the side slam, uppercut, top rope clothesline, and even caught Orton in mid-punt with the chokeslam before a chair was brought into play & be the difference maker in this match. Michael Cole described this match perfectly on commentary when he said ""What a physical battle!""

While I liked the concept of this DVD set, there was a bunch of questionable decisions made on it that really effected the product for me. While I liked that they added some rare television quality matches (Orton/Rhodes, Orton/Kane, Melina/Mickie, Cactus/HHH), some of them weren't anything special & wouldn't have been missed if they were left out. I also don't understand why there are no Last Man Standing matches on this set when that's quite an ""out of control"" match in itself. I liked that they had a good selection of WCW matches & I would say something about the lack of ECW matches but they just put out an ECW collection so I'm alright with that & at least they added one. In a nutshell, I liked the concept & overall execution here so this is something I would check out.",1403568000,,24617,4.513004484304933
5087544,4,B007I1Q4PY,"Alley Fight, Street Fight, Falls Count Anywhere, Hardcore...no matter what You call it, these are some of the most out of control matches you can be a witness to with Mick Foley hosting this DVD set.

Alley Fight Match: Pat Patterson vs. Sgt. Slaughter - This was a first of it's kind for this era of wrestling & a match that's still rare to happen today as this was a come as your dress street fight but the special catch here was that there was no referee in this match either. Patterson worked over Slaughter using his cowboy boots to stomp & his belt before Slaughter was able to regain control & use the belt to his advantage to choke Pat. Just like an alley fight, this eventually became a fist fight to the point where Slaughter was heavily bleeding. This was a physically violent match for it's time & still stands out today.
""MSG"" May '81

Atlanta Street Fight: Jimmy Valiant & Ms. Atlanta Lively vs. Midnight Express - For those who couldn't already figure it out, Ms. Lively isn't a natural woman or a transvestite but a ""rugged"" man in drag who's ""hands are hard as stone"" while the Midnight Express were dressed in tuxedos for some reason. Ms. Lively started the fight blinding people with powder while Jimmy took the fight to the outside & front row of the crowd using whatever he could get his hands on including a chair while the Express were literally getting beaten out of their clothes. The Express eventually were able to divide & conquer by keeping Jimmy on the outside while beating down Lively on the inside with everyone ended up bleeding at the end of the match with Cornette getting a shot in but paying for it later. For it's time, this was an entertaining match.
NWA Starrcade '85

Street Fight Match: NWA Tag Team Champions Doom vs. Barry Windham & Arn Anderson - This was a rare type of match during it's time as both Doom & Horsemen members were heels with both teams dressed in their street clothes. This was an all out brawl with both men using everything they were able to from leather belts, weight belts, and chairs while fighting in the ring to the outside to the rampway. Both teams were no strangers to dirty tactics like low blows with even Windham ended up being busted open. This was such a brawl that even Doom's manager Teddy Long knew better than to just stay back & not get involved like he usually does.
WCW Starrcade '90

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Sting vs. Cactus Jack - These men had an issue with each other dating back months that's been so heated to the point where they didn't even make it to the ring to start the match as Foley attacked Sting on the ramp only for Sting to respond with a backdrop & face plant on the ramp. Cactus focused on the ribs that Sting had previously injured against Vader with moves like the elbow drop off the apron, chairshots to the back & later applying the body scissors. Sting continued to fight Cactus at his own game with fighting on the outside & in the crowd dishing out the punishment like a suplex on the concrete, dishing out his own chairshots, and taking risk like a clothesline off the top rope onto the ramp. This match was what Mick Foley considered the greatest in his career for over 4 years & it was definitely a quality encounter.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Randy Savage vs. Crush - Despite what type of match this was called, this was held under Texas Death Match rules where you had to score the pinfall first & then whoever lost the fall had 10 seconds to return to the ring or lose the match. With this situation being so personal between the two for months, Savage didn't wait until Crush made it to the ring as he attacked him the moment he walked through the entrance way only for Crush to overpower Savage & drop him on the guardrail. This match had it's various moments like Crush's attempt to use salt blow up in this face, Mr. Fuji getting involved various times including what he had to do to revive Crush at one point, the ringpost & steps being used at ringside and both men fighting to the backstage area. This was a good match to finish their long standing feud but mostly remembered for being Randy Savage's last appearance at WrestleMania.
WrestleMania X

Chicago Street Fight Match: Booker T & Sting Vs. Road Warriors - The setup for this match was unusual as Sting & Lex Luger were WCW Tag Team Champions with Luger making the challenge for this match only to be pulled out it by his then-manager Jimmy Hart leaving Sting without a partner so Booker T agreed to team with Sting under the condition that his team of Harlem Heat gets a title shot if they win. This started in the isleway with the brawling going in & out of the ring including the Doomsday Cage at the entrance being used. Both teams took as much as they gave with both teams being victims of low blows, a chair & broom being used as weapons while just beating on each other into almost exhaustion. Half of the fight ended up going backstage where more people got involved & being the major factor in what turned out to really be a very physical texas tornado style match.

Chicago Street Fight Match: Ahmed Johnson & Legion Of Doom vs. Nation Of Domination - Ahmed's feud with the Nation going on for so long that he finally got partners for this match in the Legion Of Doom returning to WWE in their hometown of Chicago as The Nation came out with various weapons while L.O.D. brought out the kitchen sink. Nation members D-Lo Brown & PG-13 were sacrificed early with even Clarence Mason getting nailed for his troubles before the brawl completely erupted as there was brawling all over the place from the ring, ringside, isleway, and the front row with the weapons being used such as trash cans, wooden boards, Marlena's chair, road sign, nightstick, announcers table, rope, and even the fire extinguisher to the point where it caused the announcers at ringside to feel the effects. This was violent to the point where Faarooq was injured with a separated shoulder for weeks as a result.
WrestleMania 13

Street Fight Match: Steve Austin vs. Bret Hart - The feud between these had been going on for so long that it finally came down to this with Bret getting the advantage early thanks to some help before he tried to give Austin a taste of ""deja vu"" for what he did to another close Hart associate before Austin took advantage of Bret's miscalculation opened the door for Austin to attack both Bret's wrist & knee punishing Bret until it took a host of officials for him to stop. Quality wise this was easily the weakest match they ever did but reality is that it's more of a segment For Bret to be out of action for the next few months but stay tuned afterwords as they show the aftermath throughout the night from involving Gorilla Monsoon confronting Austin along with Bret's ambulance ride from hell.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Cactus Jack vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley - This was originally scheduled to be Dude Love participating but thanks to an entertaining video the the ""3 Faces Of Foley"", we saw the WWE debut of Cactus Jack & started the match with a bang by nailing Hunter in the head with the trash can followed by a neckbreaker on the concrete floor. Both men fought backstage & back to the ring with Chyna making her presence known while Cactus used the fire extinguisher & even breaking the guardrail before missing a move that caused him to land on the metal trash can. Hunter showed he was no stranger to dishing out the offense himself as he used a mop handle, chair, snow shovel, and trash can while suplexing Cactus on the metal ramp but it was when they made their way to the top of the entrance where a piledriver was given that you can to see to believe. Definitely one of the wildest brawls in RAW history.

Falls Count Anywhere Death Match: FTW Champion Taz Vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - For those who don't know the story behind the FTW Championship, it was Taz's personal championship he created to spite the company due to not getting a title shot against ECW Champion Shane Douglas despite the fact that Douglas was out with an injury. This was the rematch from Living Dangerously as Douglas was on commentary for this match was Bigelow was a fellow member of the Triple Threat faction. You know the direction this was going when Bigelow powerbombed Taz in the first few seconds only for Taz to get right up & deliever two strong clotheslines before taking Bigelow down with a samoan drop. They fought onto the rampway & through the crowd where chairs & guardrails where used as Taz kept focusing on using submissions. They made their way back to the ring where both men were victims of a table including Taz being busted open before making their way to the ramp again where a strong impact was felt on both men. Both men put in a strong performance here with Douglas only adding to the feel of the match on commentary.

The match made it's way into the crowd & backstage early as both men used whatever they could get their hands on from the fire extinguisher, glass, trash cans, floor tiles, metal trays, mops, and even a payphone. The fight continued to outside of the building & made it's way to the Mississippi River where both men continued to use whatever they could from road signs to a wheelbarrow, and even the camera getting hit with a broken piece of wood. This was one of the most memorable matches in the history of that championship as this was the birth of ""Hardcore"" Holly.

Strap Match: The Rock vs. Triple H - A ""forgotten"" match in the feud between Triple H & The Rock as this was to determine the challenger for the WWE Championship at SummerSlam that year...and your treated to a old school Rock promo before the match. This strap match didn't have the ""touch for corners"" rule in effect as it was Falls Count Anywhere. As you expect from a HHH/Rock match, this was wild from start to finish as they brawled through the crowd & ringside (with Rock even taking a special photo for a fan) and used the strap to their advantage to whip & choke their opposition. It was a good quality match that has been overshadowed by their other more memorable & better quality performances over the years.

Greenwich Street Fight Match: Test vs. Shane McMahon - The issues between both men came ahead here with the stipulation that Shane must stay out of the relationship between Test & his sister Stephanie if Test wins but Test & Stephanie were no longer allowed to see each other if Shane won. Test came into the match with ribs taped from a previous attack by Shane while Shane brought his own backup in the members of the Mean Street Posse at ringside who had been injured by Test throughout the previous weeks. Both men started off trading fist with Test getting the better hand using his power & even tossed Shane into the Posse before they got involved handing Shane various weapons to use & getting physically involved in the match various times helping Shane before Test had some allies come to his aid who also had unfinished business with the Mean Street Posse. This was a fun match.

WWE Champion Big Show vs. Kane - Triple H & Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley were running the show at this time & put Kane in a must win situation here in that he must either win the WWE Championship or his girlfriend Tori must spend the holiday vacation with Kane's rival X-Pac. This was a basic match that saw some impressive offense by Kane including the flying clotheslines off the top to the floor & off the ringside barrier but eventually turned hardcore with Triple H & Stephanie constantly changing the rules to the match to ensure that both Show & Kane would just keep beating on each other. Chairs & steps were used while they fought through the crowd before it took one of them taking a big move through the announce table to gain the victory.

Hardcore Champion Crash Holly vs. The Headbangers - During the period where Crash Holly was the champion defending the championship 24/7, matches took place all over the place from a circus to his hotel room to a laundry mat but this was probably the most famous one of these matches as it took place in the family fun center of Funtime U.S.A. as they went through the arcade & playpen complete with Jerry Lawler's ""Pacman"" sound effects.

Street Fight Match: Vince McMahon Vs. Shane McMahon - A rematch from their WrestleMania encounter earlier in the year with Vince starting out beating Shane on the outside with whatever he could get his hands on including a metal sign, the ring post, and a kendo stick while Shane was able to amount some offense of his own including using the trash can lid & TV monitor while also going aerial a few times sometimes hitting his target & missing the other times. Both members from the upcoming Survivor Series teams got involved with Shane's guarantee from earlier in the night of one man from Team WWE jumping to the WCW/ECW Alliance coming true.

Street Fight Match: Ric Flair vs. Mr. McMahon - The storyline at this time was that both men were co-owners of the company and they just couldn't get along with anymore...and it should be noted that this was Flair's first wrestling match since his return to WWE months earlier in his old WCW/NWA stomping grounds of Atlanta. Vince overpowered & dominated Flair in the early moments. It was when Vince had busted him open that Flair just snapped & made his comeback. They used monitors & steel pipes while having their moments at ringside with Flair's daughter's camera. This was a good entertaining match.

Street Fight Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H - Shawn Michaels in-ring return for the first time in over 4 years & didn't look like he missed a step in the opening moments by taking the fight right to Triple H starting with a dive onto him. Triple H however heavily focused on punishing HBK's back non-stop with backbreakers, chairs making his moves more impactful including a DDT that busted Shawn open, using Shawn's own belt buckle, abdominal stretch...it got to the point where referee Earl Hebner had to step in when Triple H was about to go too far. Shawn had to resort to some of his old dirty tactics to fight back & dish out punishment of his own including using the chair himself to make Triple H bleed, his belt, trash can lid, a boot from one of the announcers, table, and even pulled out a ladder. Shawn put in a performance that looked like he didn't miss a step at all in the four years while Triple H showcased why (politics aside) he's one of the best in-ring generals of this generation.

If you look through the history of all of them, it's very hard to narrow down just the classics. This is a recommended set by the ones who collects only the best of the WWE. However I would still give it only a 4.0 out of 5.0 because they are clearly missing some of the best brawls ever.

Fights such as:
- The Undertaker VS Mankind at Summerslam 1996

There are a couple af sreet fights From Samackdown  from 2011 involving Randy Orton vs Cody rhodes and One verses Kane .  They were both excellent matches .

Also there is a brutal fight from old ECW featuring Tazz vs Bam Bam Bigilow that was pretty good .

Watching these types of matches is fun but it's hard to escape the fact that if you have seen one hardcore match you have generally seen them all. That is not to say that there isn't a collection of ""good"" hardcore, falls count anywhere, (Random City Name) street fights. This one however is lackluster at best and more often than not leaves you unsatisfied.  Again I will not list the matches because that has already been done but I will say that the fact they included the Boiler Room Brawl between Mankind and Santa Claus is just such a waste. I can't imagine my group of friends going, ""Lets pull out the Mankind and Santa Claus match and watch it again!""

I will say however, the two Randy Orton matches that may, or may not, be bonus features are incredible. I am not a huge Orton mark but him and Cody Rhodes just have incredible chemistry together. I would say purchase if you are a collector such as myself. If you are only going to buy one WWE Blu-Ray this year...skip this one.",1343865600,,1031,4.392670157068062
5087587,4,B007I1Q4PY,"Alley Fight, Street Fight, Falls Count Anywhere, Hardcore...no matter what You call it, these are some of the most out of control matches you can be a witness to with Mick Foley hosting this DVD set.

Alley Fight Match: Pat Patterson vs. Sgt. Slaughter - This was a first of it's kind for this era of wrestling & a match that's still rare to happen today as this was a come as your dress street fight but the special catch here was that there was no referee in this match either.  Patterson worked over Slaughter using his cowboy boots to stomp & his belt before Slaughter was able to regain control & use the belt to his advantage to choke Pat.  Just like an alley fight, this eventually became a fist fight to the point where Slaughter was heavily bleeding.  This was a physically violent match for it's time & still stands out today.
""MSG"" May '81

Atlanta Street Fight: Jimmy Valiant & Ms. Atlanta Lively vs. Midnight Express - For those who couldn't already figure it out, Ms. Lively isn't a natural woman or a transvestite but a ""rugged"" man in drag who's ""hands are hard as stone"" while the Midnight Express were dressed in tuxedos for some reason.  Ms. Lively started the fight blinding people with powder while Jimmy took the fight to the outside & front row of the crowd using whatever he could get his hands on including a chair while the Express were literally getting beaten out of their clothes.  The Express eventually were able to divide & conquer by keeping Jimmy on the outside while beating down Lively on the inside with everyone ended up bleeding at the end of the match with Cornette getting a shot in but paying for it later.  For it's time, this was an entertaining match.
NWA Starrcade '85

Street Fight Match: NWA Tag Team Champions Doom vs. Barry Windham & Arn Anderson - This was a rare type of match during it's time as both Doom & Horsemen members were heels with both teams dressed in their street clothes.  This was an all out brawl with both men using everything they were able to from leather belts, weight belts, and chairs while fighting in the ring to the outside to the rampway.  Both teams were no strangers to dirty tactics like low blows with even Windham ended up being busted open.  This was such a brawl that even Doom's manager Teddy Long knew better than to just stay back & not get involved like he usually does.
WCW Starrcade '90

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Sting vs. Cactus Jack - These men had an issue with each other dating back months that's been so heated to the point where they didn't even make it to the ring to start the match as Foley attacked Sting on the ramp only for Sting to respond with a backdrop & face plant on the ramp.  Cactus focused on the ribs that Sting had previously injured against Vader with moves like the elbow drop off the apron, chairshots to the back & later applying the body scissors.  Sting continued to fight Cactus at his own game with fighting on the outside & in the crowd dishing out the punishment like a suplex on the concrete, dishing out his own chairshots, and taking risk like a clothesline off the top rope onto the ramp.  This match was what Mick Foley considered the greatest in his career for over 4 years & it was definitely a quality encounter.
WCW Beach Blast '92
[Bonus Section Of ""Mick Foley: Greatest Hits & Misses""]

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Randy Savage vs. Crush - Despite what type of match this was called, this was held under Texas Death Match rules where you had to score the pinfall first & then whoever lost the fall had 10 seconds to return to the ring or lose the match.  With this situation being so personal between the two for months, Savage didn't wait until Crush made it to the ring as he attacked him the moment he walked through the entrance way only for Crush to overpower Savage & drop him on the guardrail.  This match had it's various moments like Crush's attempt to use salt blow up in this face, Mr. Fuji getting involved various times including what he had to do to revive Crush at one point, the ringpost & steps being used at ringside and both men fighting to the backstage area.  This was a good match to finish their long standing feud but mostly remembered for being Randy Savage's last appearance at WrestleMania.
WrestleMania X

Chicago Street Fight Match: Booker T & Sting Vs. Road Warriors - The setup for this match was unusual as Sting & Lex Luger were WCW Tag Team Champions with Luger making the challenge for this match only to be pulled out it by his then-manager Jimmy Hart leaving Sting without a partner so Booker T agreed to team with Sting under the condition that his team of Harlem Heat gets a title shot if they win.  This started in the isleway with the brawling going in & out of the ring including the Doomsday Cage at the entrance being used.  Both teams took as much as they gave with both teams being victims of low blows, a chair & broom being used as weapons while just beating on each other into almost exhaustion.  Half of the fight ended up going backstage where more people got involved & being the major factor in what turned out to really be a very physical texas tornado style match.
WCW Uncensored '96

Chicago Street Fight Match: Ahmed Johnson & Legion Of Doom vs. Nation Of Domination - Ahmed's feud with the Nation going on for so long that he finally got partners for this match in the Legion Of Doom returning to WWE in their hometown of Chicago as The Nation came out with various weapons while L.O.D. brought out the kitchen sink.  Nation members D-Lo Brown & PG-13 were sacrificed early with even Clarence Mason getting nailed for his troubles before the brawl completely erupted as there was brawling all over the place from the ring, ringside, isleway, and the front row with the weapons being used such as trash cans, wooden boards, Marlena's chair, road sign, nightstick, announcers table, rope, and even the fire extinguisher to the point where it caused the announcers at ringside to feel the effects.  This was violent to the point where Faarooq was injured with a separated shoulder for weeks as a result.
WrestleMania 13

Street Fight Match: Steve Austin vs. Bret Hart - The feud between these had been going on for so long that it finally came down to this with Bret getting the advantage early thanks to some help before he tried to give Austin a taste of ""deja vu"" for what he did to another close Hart associate before Austin took advantage of Bret's miscalculation opened the door for Austin to attack both Bret's wrist & knee punishing Bret until it took a host of officials for him to stop.  Quality wise this was easily the weakest match they ever did but reality is that it's more of a segment For Bret to be out of action for the next few months but stay tuned afterwords as they show the aftermath throughout the night from involving Gorilla Monsoon confronting Austin along with Bret's ambulance ride from hell.
""RAW"" Apr. '97

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Cactus Jack vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley - This was originally scheduled to be Dude Love participating but thanks to an entertaining video the the ""3 Faces Of Foley"", we saw the WWE debut of Cactus Jack & started the match with a bang by nailing Hunter in the head with the trash can followed by a neckbreaker on the concrete floor.  Both men fought backstage & back to the ring with Chyna making her presence known while Cactus used the fire extinguisher & even breaking the guardrail before missing a move that caused him to land on the metal trash can.  Hunter showed he was no stranger to dishing out the offense himself as he used a mop handle, chair, snow shovel, and trash can while suplexing Cactus on the metal ramp but it was when they made their way to the top of the entrance where a piledriver was given that you can to see to believe.  Definitely one of the wildest brawls in RAW history.

Falls Count Anywhere Death Match: FTW Champion Taz Vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - For those who don't know the story behind the FTW Championship, it was Taz's personal championship he created to spite the company due to not getting a title shot against ECW Champion Shane Douglas despite the fact that Douglas was out with an injury.  This was the rematch from Living Dangerously as Douglas was on commentary for this match was Bigelow was a fellow member of the Triple Threat faction.  You know the direction this was going when Bigelow powerbombed Taz in the first few seconds only for Taz to get right up & deliever two strong clotheslines before taking Bigelow down with a samoan drop.  They fought onto the rampway & through the crowd where chairs & guardrails where used as Taz kept focusing on using submissions.  They made their way back to the ring where both men were victims of a table including Taz being busted open before making their way to the ramp again where a strong impact was felt on both men.  Both men put in a strong performance here with Douglas only adding to the feel of the match on commentary.

Hardcore Championship Match: Al Snow vs. Hardcore Holly - Road Dogg had to forfeit the title due to injury setting up this match between the former J.O.B. Squad members.  The match made it's way into the crowd & backstage early as both men used whatever they could get their hands on from the fire extinguisher, glass, trash cans, floor tiles, metal trays, mops, and even a payphone.  The fight continued to outside of the building & made it's way to the Mississippi River where both men continued to use whatever they could from road signs to a wheelbarrow, and even the camera getting hit with a broken piece of wood.  This was one of the most memorable matches in the history of that championship as this was the birth of ""Hardcore"" Holly.

Strap Match: The Rock vs. Triple H - A ""forgotten"" match in the feud between Triple H & The Rock as this was to determine the challenger for the WWE Championship at SummerSlam that year...and your treated to a old school Rock promo before the match. This strap match didn't have the ""touch for corners"" rule in effect as it was Falls Count Anywhere. As you expect from a HHH/Rock match, this was wild from start to finish as they brawled through the crowd & ringside (with Rock even taking a special photo for a fan) and used the strap to their advantage to whip & choke their opposition. It was a good quality match that has been overshadowed by their other more memorable & better quality performances over the years.

Greenwich Street Fight Match: Test vs. Shane McMahon - The issues between both men came ahead here with the stipulation that Shane must stay out of the relationship between Test & his sister Stephanie if Test wins but Test & Stephanie were no longer allowed to see each other if Shane won.  Test came into the match with ribs taped from a previous attack by Shane while Shane brought his own backup in the members of the Mean Street Posse at ringside who had been injured by Test throughout the previous weeks.  Both men started off trading fist with Test getting the better hand using his power & even tossed Shane into the Posse before they got involved handing Shane various weapons to use & getting physically involved in the match various times helping Shane before Test had some allies come to his aid who also had unfinished business with the Mean Street Posse.  This was a fun match.
SummerSlam '99

WWE Champion Big Show vs. Kane - Triple H & Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley were running the show at this time & put Kane in a must win situation here in that he must either win the WWE Championship or his girlfriend Tori must spend the holiday vacation with Kane's rival X-Pac.  This was a basic match that saw some impressive offense by Kane including the flying clotheslines off the top to the floor & off the ringside barrier but eventually turned hardcore with Triple H & Stephanie constantly changing the rules to the match to ensure that both Show & Kane would just keep beating on each other.  Chairs & steps were used while they fought through the crowd before it took one of them taking a big move through the announce table to gain the victory.
""RAW"" Dec. '99

Hardcore Champion Crash Holly vs. The Headbangers - During the period where Crash Holly was the champion defending the championship 24/7, matches took place all over the place from a circus to his hotel room to a laundry mat but this was probably the most famous one of these matches as it took place in the family fun center of Funtime U.S.A. as they went through the arcade & playpen complete with Jerry Lawler's ""Pacman"" sound effects.

Street Fight Match: Vince McMahon Vs. Shane McMahon - A rematch from their WrestleMania encounter earlier in the year with Vince starting out beating Shane on the outside with whatever he could get his hands on including a metal sign, the ring post, and a kendo stick while Shane was able to amount some offense of his own including using the trash can lid & TV monitor while also going aerial a few times sometimes hitting his target & missing the other times.  Both members from the upcoming Survivor Series teams got involved with Shane's guarantee from earlier in the night of one man from Team WWE jumping to the WCW/ECW Alliance coming true.
""RAW"" Oct. '01

Street Fight Match: Ric Flair vs. Mr. McMahon - The storyline at this time was that both men were co-owners of the company and they just couldn't get along with anymore...and it should be noted that this was Flair's first wrestling match since his return to WWE months earlier in his old WCW/NWA stomping grounds of Atlanta. Vince overpowered & dominated Flair in the early moments. It was when Vince had busted him open that Flair just snapped & made his comeback. They used monitors & steel pipes while having their moments at ringside with Flair's daughter's camera. This was a good entertaining match.
Royal Rumble '02

Street Fight Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H - Shawn Michaels in-ring return for the first time in over 4 years & didn't look like he missed a step in the opening moments by taking the fight right to Triple H starting with a dive onto him.  Triple H however heavily focused on punishing HBK's back non-stop with backbreakers, chairs making his moves more impactful including a DDT that busted Shawn open, using Shawn's own belt buckle, abdominal stretch...it got to the point where referee Earl Hebner had to step in when Triple H was about to go too far.  Shawn had to resort to some of his old dirty tactics to fight back & dish out punishment of his own including using the chair himself to make Triple H bleed, his belt, trash can lid, a boot from one of the announcers, table, and even pulled out a ladder.  Shawn put in a performance that looked like he didn't miss a step at all in the four years while Triple H showcased why (politics aside) he's one of the best in-ring generals of this generation.
SummerSlam '02
[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels]

Street Fight Match: World Champion Triple H vs. Kevin Nash - Shawn Michaels was in Nash's corner while Ric Flair was in Triple H's in what started off as a normal match quickly turned into an unofficial tag with Flair & HBK getting so involved in the action that Flair was bleeding within the first few minutes & both men had to be taken backstage due to the excessive brawling while Nash & Triple H brawled up the ramp to the announce table area with a chair being used before the fight made it's way back to the ring.  Triple H focused on Nash's bad knees while Nash kept using weapons like the steel steps to beat on Triple H & eventually causing him to be busted open as the match just erupted into non-stop chaos as Flair & HBK returned while referees were being knocked out left & right.  Kevin Nash didn't really have a lot of positives going for him during this run in WWE (too many injuries & dropped storylines) but this was one of the best matches he had during this period.
Insurrextion '03

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Womens Champion Melina vs. Mickie James - Both girls had so much heat (both in front & behind the camera) that this match started off with a bang as Mickie dropkicked Melina while she was doing her split entrance as this went backstage quick to the makeup area & even the divas locker room where the other girls got involved & we saw a side of Candice Michelle that was definitely too ""RAW"" for live TV before the match eventually made it's way back down to the ring & ending with one of the scariest landings you can have in the ring.  The match itself was short & sweet but every entertaining & aggressive for what it was.
""RAW"" Mar. '07

Street Fight Match: Triple H vs. Umaga - This fight started in the isleway with both men crashing through the set before taking the fight into the crowd & back into the ring where a trash can came into play.  Umaga targeted Triple H's ribs with moves like the big splash, samoan drop, and various bearhugs before Triple H resorted to dirty tactics & continued to use whatever he could get his hands on against Umaga including a DDT on a chair.  The match got taken to the floor once again where they fought through each of the 3 announce tables with Umaga giving a version of the running splash you have to see to believe.  Great brawl that including some good storytelling.
Cyber Sunday '07

Street Fight Match: John Cena vs. Umaga - Cena started out throwing punches to Umaga only for him to keep stopping him dead in his tracks every time with his power throughout this match as Cena took advantage of the street fight stipulation by brawling on the outside, using a chair, and even a microphone only for Umaga to either overpower him or just keep catching him like the sidewalk slam when Cena was coming off the top rope.  While this match would look like the ""stereotypical"" Cena performance, I'll give credit here in that Cena sold the punishment he was given throughout the match with the story being that Umaga just kept staying one step ahead of him.
""RAW"" June '08

Submissions Count Anywhere Match: D-Generation X vs. The Legacy - This is the first of 3 different types of submission matches throughout the night with a special type of twist on a normal ""falls count anywhere"" match as for those who know their WWE history in regards to the city of Montreal, you'll get a laugh out of DX's introduction. As you expect in this match, more of the action happened outside of the ring than it did in the ring as they fought through the crowd, ringside, near the stage, backstage. Along with the normal submission moves you've seen in the past from DX like a figure four & even the crossface, you saw various unique types of submission moves both teams like Shawn doing a reverse dragon sleeper using the handrail in the isleway, DX using a boston crab/camel clutch combination, a variation of the Gory Guerrero backbreaker, and even Ted doing his dad's famous ""Million $ Dream"". This was the type of match that an unestablished team like Legacy NEED as they divided & conquered here resulting in them doing something that no other team before them as ever done.
Breaking Point '09
[Blu-Ray Edition Of DX: One Last Stand]

Street Fight Match: Rey Mysterio vs. Batista - After Batista destroyed Mysterio at the previous S. Series PPV, he tried to use the hit & run offense here but Batista caught him with an impactful clothesline followed by powerful whip into the corner but Rey kept resorting to this speed trying to play the game of ""cat & mouse"" with it working against Batista at times only for him to use his power to stop his momentum dead in it's tracks & doing such things was whipping Mysterio with the television cables.  Mysterio refused to quit & was even able to use a chair a few times but Batista still was an unstoppable force.  This match did it's job in establishing Rey was the little man who won't give up against the unstoppable ""animal"" but outside of the chair being used in the end, this was more of a normal match than an actual street fight.
""SmackDown"" Dec. '09

Street Fight Match: Randy Orton vs. Cody Rhodes - The final battle between the ex-Legacy members here as Cody came out with his baggers at ringside & the match made it's way to the floor in the opening moments with both men being thrown into the steps before taking the fight into the crowd with Cody eventually sacrificing his baggers just to get away from Orton.  They brawled up the ramp to the isleway to the ring & back out to the announce tables with Cody targeting Orton's leg with a clip, stomps, and the figure four while also using his mask as a weapon various times.  The was the final match in their feud against each other & definitely the best match in their series.

(Blu-Ray) Boiler Room Brawl Match: Mankind vs Santa Claus - In a nutshell, this was more of a segment than a match with DX taking advantage of Mankind's love for Christmas by having him fight a bunch of Santa Clause's along with the Mean Street Posse as well.  This was less than 5 minutes & nothing more past a segment.
""RAW"" Dec. '99

(Blu-Ray) Street Fight Match: Triple H vs. Sheamus - This was suppose to happen earlier in the night but Sheamus attacked Triple H on the way to the ring causing his arm & neck to be injured coming into the match. Triple H had vengeance on his mind as his completely dominated Sheamus in the opening moments & was close to making this a flawless victory before the effects of his hurt arm started to show. Sheamus worked over his neck throughout the match. Triple H was able to fight back with the help of a kendo stick but all his injuries & a heavy amounts of kicks to the head were just too much as Sheamus got the victory. Stay tuned afterwards as Triple H was down but not out until Sheamus put him out for good.
Extreme Rules '10

(Blu-Ray) Falls Count Anywhere Match: Rey Mysterio vs. Cody Rhodes - This turned into a brawl right away as they fought from the ring to the stage area very early in the match. The fight went into the crowd where Cody used the handrails in the middle of the isle to his advantage such as doing a modified version of Chris Jericho's old ""Liontamer"" submission with the railing. They fought into the lobby area or the arena before taking the match back to the ring with Rey being hip tossed over the rail onto the floor in the process. Cody went after Rey's face including slamming his face into the steps in this match before Mysterio did something that I don't remember seeing from him but got a ""Great Muta"" reference from Booker T in what turned out to be a great followup to their previous match at WrestleMania and SmackDown weeks later.
Extreme Rules '11

(Blu-Ray) Street Fight Match: Randy Orton vs Kane - Orton was frustrated for losing his World Championship to Christian earlier in the week by disqualification while Kane was trying to rediscover the monster he once was.  Orton went for the RKO early on only to be shoved off & have the fight taken to the isleway where a kendo stick was brought into play.  Orton was overpowered by Kane & attempted to chokeslam Orton though a table only for Orton to land on his feet onto of the table but get his leg caught as the table fell over which he tried to laugh off to no avail before he used the steps on Kane hurting his knees as well.  Kane continued to fight on one leg with moves like the side slam, uppercut, top rope clothesline, and even caught Orton in mid-punt with the chokeslam before a chair was brought into play & be the difference maker in this match.  Michael Cole described this match perfectly on commentary when he said ""What a physical battle!""
""SmackDown"" July '11

While I liked the concept of this DVD set, there was a bunch of questionable decisions made on it that really effected the product for me.  While I liked that they added some rare television quality matches (Orton/Rhodes, Orton/Kane, Melina/Mickie, Cactus/HHH), some of them weren't anything special & wouldn't have been missed if they were left out.  I also don't understand why  there are no Last Man Standing matches on this set when that's quite an ""out of control"" match in itself.  I liked that they had a good selection of WCW matches & I would say something about the lack of ECW matches but they just put out an ECW collection so I'm alright with that & at least they added one.  In a nutshell, I liked the concept & overall execution here so this is something I would check out.",1341273600,8,24679,4.513004484304933
5087588,3,B007I1Q4PY,"That's it? Just one match for WWE women and while I have to admit that somehow I managed to miss that bout and really like both Women who are or I should saw now WERE some of the best wrestlers WWE ever had before they were let go for stupid reasons then this is better than nothing. IT really stinks. For a 3 disc set there could have been more more for at least one more match?

I have not bought this DVD yet as I wanted to see what was on it. Yes, I do still plan as there are several bouts I hadn't seen and want to. Just wanted to make sure none of these where edited as I hate buying these sets and find only half of the matches are there! While I do agree with one of the reviewers about the dates being mostly on the 80s and 90s, I hope it means that if the sets sells well they will put another one with more of the earlier. If more fans wrote in and bitched about it - it could happen say like the in Your House PPVs. Which they let a carrot hang for a month and then let drop when only 6 people myself included wrote in screaming YES!!! we want that

Enough of my ranting - I was glad to several matches from WCW. If we can't get Sting, at least we can watch him from earlier days. I do agree that WWE should stop using PPVs for the special sets. I for one feel like they are being shoved down my throat. ""if you didn't buy or watch they the first here they are again and again."" I believe others feel the same way and Vince has a wonderful library from other shows to go thru that he could be putting together 3 disc sets from now in better quality.",1340928000,,1562,3.8934169278996866
5087589,4,B007I1Q4PY,"I had high hopes going into this set and while it's not a complete disappointment, I can't help but feel like Falls Count Anywhere is a bit of a missed opportunity. There's six great matches on this set: Cactus Jack vs Sting, Sting & Booker T vs The Road Warriors, Cactus Jack vs Triple H, The Rock vs Triple H, DX vs The Legacy and Shawn Michaels vs Triple H (which, in my opinion, is the best reason to own this set.)

The rest of the matches are either solid (like Ric Flair vs Vince McMahon), average (like Test vs Shane McMahon), or down-right bad (like Jimmy Valiant & Ms. Atlanta Lively vs. Midnight Express) Also, a few matches, Like Stone Cold vs Bret Hart and Crash Holly vs The Headbangers, are more like segments than matches.

Mick Foley is fantastic in his role of host. He's funny and really adds to the set. I just wish they included more of him.

Overall, this is a ok set. The six great matches I listed above are worth checking and, depending on your preference, the other matches may appeal to you as well. It might not be the best set WWE has put out, but it's certainly not the worst.

Slaughter w/The Grand Wizard: Finally this classic comes to DVD/Blu-Ray, there's no referee in the ring and these two just go at it tooth and nail busting each other open and brutalize each other from the opening bell. A leather belt gets used by both men and you can count the number of wrestling hold used in this contest on one hand. Its very intense throughout the whole match, Wizard throws the towel in for Slaughter and the bell is rung, so Patterson wins. 7/10.

-11/28/85, Starrcade, Atlanta Street Fight, Jimmy Valiant & Ms. Atlanta Lively vs. The Midnight Express: Interesting but blah one here with the action going in and out of the ring, Valiant and Lively beat up on the Express members, who end up bleeding badly. Some powder gets used a few times to temporarily blind each wrestler and its just wild and crazy throughout, the Express target Lively to expose the fact she's really a man (which is of course clearly obvious to the viewer), however ""she"" catches Bobby Eaton with an uppercut off the top and covers to win. 3/10.

-12/16/90, Starrcade, Street Fight for the NWA Tag Team Championship, Doom (Ron Simmons & Butch Reed) (Champions) w/Theodore R. Long vs. Barry Windham & Arn Anderson: This one just goes all over as all four of these men were great in the ring, weapons like a steel chair and a leather strap get brought into play and most everyone bleeds. There are plenty of cloe near falls, the end sees Windham hit a small package and Simmons cover Arn for three at the same time and there's confusion over the decision. 6/10, but the battle rages on up the entrance ramp into the back.

-6/20/92, WCW Beach Blast, No DQ/Falls Count Anywhere Match for the WCW Heavyweight Championship, vs. Sting (Champion): It started off quickly with Sting taking it to Cactus, who comes back nailing a sunset flip off the ring apron for two. Its actually a pretty good match, Sting beats up Cactus on the floor, slamming him into the guardrail, but Cactus comes back with a spinning clothesline and locks on a body scissors. Cactus counters a Stinger Splash into the guardrail and uses a chair on Sting, but they battle up the ramp, a double arm DDT by Cactus for two. Sting hits a big clothesline off the top and pins Cactus on the ramp for the win. 8/10.

-3/20/94, Wrestlemania X, Falls Count Anywhere Match, ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage vs. Crush: For months this had been brewing as Crush turned on Savage and joined Mr. Fuji and his stable, this match had a special stipulation that after each fall the pinned wrestler has 1 minute to get back into the ring. The early parts were about how much punishment could Randy take before he threw salt in Crush's eyes and took over. Its a decent match but short, they battle to the back Randy pins him in the backstage area then ties his legs up in some cables and makes it back to the ring to win. 5/10.

-3/24/96, WCW Uncensored, Chicago Street Fight, Booker T & Sting vs. The Road Warriors: Average brawl here as they pair off and fight all over the ringside area, using the guardrail and concrete floor to inflict damage. The Warriors use their strength edge though Booker and Sting are no slouches in that department, a chair is brought in and used on each man. Its a good brawl and the crowd was equal parts hot and cold for some reason and it just seems to drag on after a while. Booker T ends up leaving the ring and going to the back, Animal follows him and gets beat up by Lex Luger, Stevie Ray and is handcuffed to a steel girder. Booker comes back to the ring, Stevie hits Hawk with a chair, Booker covers to win the match. 5/10.

-3/23/97, Wrestlemania 13, Chicago Street Fight, Ahmed Johnson & The Legion of Doom vs. Faarooq, Savio Vega & Crush: This was an intense fight with Johnson really looking for revenge against the Nation of Domination, tables, chairs and plenty of hard shots were given and taken by all six men. The Chicago crowd was amped for the L.O.D., some of the ringside Nation members get beaten up, its a wild brawl and a quick one but very good. L.O.D. hit the Doomsday Device, Ahmed hits Crush with a 2x4 and Animal covers to win. 7/10.

-4/21/97, Raw, Street Fight, Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Bret Hart: After their classic at Wrestlemania 13 just a month before we have this rematch, the Hart Foundation jumps Austin from behind and they beat on Steve for a bit. Shawn Michaels comes in with a chair to chase of British Bulldog and Owen Hart and its down to Hart and Austin, who targets the Hitman's knee with a steel chair then locks on the Sharpshooter. The refs try to get Steve off of Bret who won't break the hold. 5/10, as it was more of a segment than anything. Back from break they take Hart to a ambulance, where he gets another attack from Austin.

-9/22/97, Raw, Falls Count Anywhere Match, vs. Triple H: This was an intense brawl that went into the crowd and all over the arena, HHH got thrown into the guardrail, knocking it down. HHH did get some good shots in but in the end Cactus hit a piledriver through a table on the stage and pinned him for the win. 7/10.

-8/2/98, ECW Heat Wave, Falls Count Anywhere Death Match, Tazz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow: These two had a very good rivalry as Tazz was virtually unbeatable at this time and Bigelow was one of the few to challenge him. Its hard hitting, stiff and goes in and out of the ring as expected, there's brawling in the crowd, back in the ring a table is brought in that Tazz gets thrown through. Tazz comes back with a T-Bone Suplex into the remaining part of the table, there's a DDT that drives them both through the entrance ramp. Tazz however ends up locking on the Tazzmission soon after and Bam Bam gives up. 8/10.

-2/14/99, St. Valentine's Day Massacre, Match for the Vacated WWE Hardcore Championship, Al Snow vs. Hardcore Holly: Quite an interesting one here as both these men worked so much better in these type of matches, tons of weapons are used, it quickly goes out of the ring into the backstage area. They fight all the way out of the arena even to the nearby river, with both men getting thrown in, Holly wraps some fencing around Al and pins him to win the title. 6/10.

-7/25/99, Fully Loaded, Strap Match: Triple H vs. The Rock: Nice pre-match promo by The Rock, this is a good solid match, as both men bring the physicality to each other. The strap marks up both men and the fists fly as well. The action spills to the outside, even into the crowd, into the entrance ramp, back to the ring. Triple H wins after nailing the pedigree, pretty good and brutal match. 8/10.

-8/22/99, Summerslam, Love Her or Leave Her Greenwich Street Fight, Shane McMahon vs. Test: Good one here as Shane didn't approve of his sister Stephanie seeing Test so he took on the 6'7"" Canadian to settle this score and there was some expected involvement from Shane's friend The Mean Street Posse. Shane does hit some good moves, the bigger Test throws him into the Posse who were in the front row. Weapons are brought out including a street sign, a framed picture and others, Shane then hits a diving elbow driving Test through the announce table. Patterson and Briscoe come down to beat up the Posse, Shane hits the steel post shoulder first, Test hits a huge diving elbow and covers to win. 6/10.

(Also Available on Summerslam Anthology Volume 3)

-12/20/99, Raw, WWE Championship Match, The Big Show (Champion) vs. Kane: Not a bad one here, Kane hits a very nice diving clothesline to the outside knocking Show to the ground. As the ref keeps calling for the bell, Triple H and Stephanie butt in and make it a Falls Count Anywhere match (seriously I'm shocked, I never expected that). The guys go in and out of the crowd displaying their respective strength at times, Big Show hits a massive powerbomb sending Kane through the announce table and covers to win. 6/10.

-3/16/00, Smackdown, WWE Hardcore Championship Match, Crash Holly (Champion) vs. The Headbangers: This was during the 24/7 era where Crash would defend the title anytime and anywhere, its more of a segment as Mosh and Thrasher chase Crash around a video arcade and play area which was funny to see but not really a match. Crash does hit a couple of moves and escapes with his title. 0/10.

-10/29/01, Raw, Street Fight, Mr. McMahon vs. Shane McMahon: During the beyond terrible Alliance angle was a fairly good TV street fight, Vince smashes his son with a street sign and sends him into the ring post. More weapons like a trash can and kendo stick are brought in, Shane takes over slamming a trash can lid into Vince's back and head, however Shane misses a Shooting Star Press hitting a trash can. There's the expected elbow drop by Shane on Vince through the announc table, later attempts the Coast to Coast but Vince hits him with the can. Then there's interference from a bunch of wrestlers for both companies, Kurt Angle comes down and turns on the WWE smashing a chair into Jericho and The Rock. Austin puts Shane on Vince and he gets the win. 6/10.

-1/20/02, Royal Rumble, Street Fight, Ric Flair vs. Mr. McMahon: Its Flair's first match in almost a year since the closing of WCW in March of '01 and while not great its always good to see Ric in the ring. Vince gets chopped by Flair quite a bit and Vince does bust Ric open and beats him up for a bit even in front of his family who is at ringside. Flair makes his comeback and locks on the figure four leg lock and McMahon taps out as Ric wins. 8/10.

Disc 2

-8/28/02, Summerslam Unsanctioned Street Fight, Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H: I wasn't sure how good Michaels would be after a 4+ year layoff from the ring, but this was quite surprisingly a great match. Shawn dominated early, but Triple H hit a vicious backbreaker, then continued to focus on Michaels' bad back for about the next several minutes of the match. Things looked bleak for Shawn, but he turned things around with Sweet Chin Music knocking a chair into Triple H's face, busting him open big time. Shawn dominated for most of the rest of the match and he even used a ladder, beat HHH to the outside, set up a table, put HHH on it then dove from the top rope through the table and HHH. Shawn then brings the ladder in the ring, knocks HHH down, climbs the ladder and hits diving elbow of the top of the ladder. Shawn goes for Sweet Chin Music, it's blocked, but Michaels reverses HHH's pedigree into a roll-up for the win in about 27 minutes. The Long Island, New York crowd was very pro-Shawn throughout the match, very, very vocal and very, very loud. 11/10.

-6/7/03, Insurrextion, Street Fight for the World Heavyweight Championship, Triple H (Champion) w/Ric Flair vs. Kevin Nash w/Shawn Michaels: This very underwhelming rivalry went global all the way into England, it was elevated somewhat by having Flair and Michaels at ringside. Nash uses his height and strength to toss around the Game, Flair interferes causing a mini-brawl to break out between him and Michaels. It goes to the outside, up the entrance ramp, with Trips taking a big backdrop onto the ramp, Trips targets the knee, slamming it into the ring post, the ref gets knocked down, Trips hits Nash with a chair but he kicks out. Michaels hits Sweet Chin Music on Flair on the outside, misses on Trips and gets the pedigree, Nash hits the Jacknife but there's no ref, he then gets the sledgehammer shot, Trips covers and pins Kevin for 3 to retain. 5/10.

-3/5/07, Raw, Falls Count Anywhere Match for the WWE Women's Championship, Melina (Champion) vs. Mickie James: It starts in the ring, but quickly goes to the back where they fight in a make-up area and even into the diva's locker room. There's interference from Candace, Victoria, Torrie and others, the camera goes black and Melina and Mickey are back out at ringside. They battle on the top rope, Mickey misses a hurricarana falling onto her neck, Melina covers to win. 2/10.

-10/28/07, Cyber Sunday, Street Fight, Triple H vs. Umaga: It starts out in the entrance way with Umaga pounding on and throwing The Game around the stage, Trips comes back sending Umaga through part of the set wall. A trash can is brought in with Umaga taking a hard shot to the head, Umaga does take over beating up Trips for a few, who does come back but the Samoan monster hits a big swinging slam throwing Trips to the ground. Great spot where Umaga hits a massive splash driving Trips through the announce table, after missing a top rope splash the sledgehammer is brought out, and Trips use it and hits the pedigree to cover and win. 9/10.

-6/16/08, Raw, Street Fight, John Cena vs. Umaga: Having had good fights in the past they knew each other well, Cena ran full force at Umaga but got tossed around some for his efforts. John does come back throwing everything at Umaga including using a microphone but gets a sidewalk slam after getting caught leaping off the top. Cena hits a big legdrop off the top, attempts the FU but falls to the ground, then is sent into the steel steps very hard. Umaga then misses with the steps, gets the FU and John covers to win. 6/10.

-9/13/09, Breaking Point, Submissions Count Anywhere Match, DX vs. Legacy: Another good one with DX taking on a much younger team that was hungry to prove themselves. It was all over the place, around ringside, through the crowd, up into the upper parts of the arena and back to the ring. DX does very well while Rhodes and DiBiase make their mark in this breakout match, near the end Trips is trying to get back to the ring, Michaels taps out after being locked in the Million Dollar Dream and the figure four around the ring post so Legacy wins. 8/10.

-12/11/09, Smackdown, Street Fight, Rey Mysterio vs. Batista: After Batista beat up Rey at Survivor Series it lead to a series of good matches between these two, with this being the weaker of them. Batista throws Mysterio around and uses his strength advantage to ground the smaller man, then wraps Rey around the ring post working on his back. Mysterio does come back, uses a chair a few times but gets the spear, the spinebuster then a massive chair shot to the head and Batista covers to win. 5/10.

-11/4/11, Smackdown, Street Fight, Randy Orton vs. Cody Rhodes: Great one here as they fought all over the ringside area and into the crowd, Randy takes out Cody's baggers then they fight up the ramp onto the stage, where Orton hits a suplex on the stage. They battle back to the ring, where a big superplex by Randy takes both men out, Rhodes targets an open wound on top of Orton's head as he keeps up the offense, even using the mask as a weapon. Randy grabs the mask and slams it into Cody's head, Rhodes fights back but ends up getting an RKO and Orton covers to win. 9/10. Afterwards Randy puts a bag over Cody's head and leaves the ring.

Blu-Ray Exclusive Matches

-12/20/99, Raw, Boiler Room Brawl, Mankind vs. Santa Claus: Quite a goofy one here, it starts out with an interview, the Mean Street Posse throws Mankind into the boiler room. He talks with Santa and tells him to leave then about 5 ""Santa's"" attack him, among them are the New Age Outlaws and Triple H. After some brawling Triple H hits Mankind with a sack full of something then walks out to win. 1/10.

-4/25/10, Extreme Rules, Street Fight, Triple H vs. Sheamus: After Triple H won at Wrestlemania, Sheamus still targeted the Game and even laid him out with a steel pipe earlier in the PPV. So he was selling the nerve damage from the attack before, Trips does come out taking it to the Celtic Warrior hitting the spinebuster, goes for the pedigree but can't hook it on and gets taken down. Sheamus takes over targeting the neck and pounding away on Trips for a while, however the Game does make his comeback, but can't it out. There's multiple brogue kicks and Sheamus covers to win. 7/10, Trips tries to leave the ring under his own power but Sheamus hits another Brogue Kick on the stage then Trips is put onto a stretcher.

-5/1/11, Extreme Rules, Falls Count Anywhere Match, Rey Mysterio vs. Cody Rhodes: A vastly underated rivalry and this was a good match that went all over the arena, Rey hit a seated senton splash off the stage. The action even up the stands into the hallways where some of the crowd cheers them on and Rhodes hits a jumping kick off of a concession cart that got a nice ""Holy S***"" chant from the crowd. Rey hits a springboard dive from a concessions counter for a 2 count. Back in the ring Rey does a diving headbutt to Cody for 2. Rhodes has Rey up in the corner but Rey sprays some mist into Rhodes eyes, then hits the 619 and splash off the top rope for the win. 9/10.

-7/22/11, Smackdown, Street Fight, Randy Orton vs. Kane: Good one here as Kane hits some big clubbing blows on the Viper, who fights back goes for the RKO but gets thrown off. Some weapons are brought out like a kendo stick, but Kane just overpowers Orton most of the time. After slipping in a hole on the announce table Randy is irate, stomping and slamming the steps into Kane's ankle. Kane tries coming back, gets the RKO but kicks out at 2, Kane dodges the punt hits the chokeslam but only for 2. A chair is brought in and slammed into the back of Orton multiple times, but Randy hits an RKO on the chair and covers to win. 7/10.
