8722619,5,B010LY9GIG,"I really enjoyed this film. In this cute, animated show, we meet four characters who work for The Doozer Pod Squad. They make kids understand how to work together as a team. There are 4 episodes included in this DVD.

I like this DVD because it talks about the importance of working together. I found the characters to be very cute and I also like that it talks about creativity and how you can make anything when you work together as a team and don't give up.

I like this show so much that the only thing I don't like is how short the episodes are.  I wish that the episodes were a little longer.

My favorite character is Daisy Wheel Doozer (voiced by Millie Davis), because she is the nicest and youngest character. I can relate to her since we are both the youngest amongst our peers. I like that she can do most of the stuff on her own and Im the same way.

The moral lesson of this DVD is If you collaborate with others, you can accomplish anything. I say that because, when The Doozers have a goal, they work together to accomplish it. This helps kids understand that it is okay to work together and it will help kids learn how to collaborate with others.

In terms of features on the DVD, you can select individual episodes to watch or you can select play all. You can also fast forward or rewind the movie.

I recommend this to kids who like adventure and educational shows. Its perfect for kids ages 3 to 8. Kids above that age may find it a bit boring. For that age, I give this show 5 out of 5 stars. This is a really great show and it is available now on DVD.
