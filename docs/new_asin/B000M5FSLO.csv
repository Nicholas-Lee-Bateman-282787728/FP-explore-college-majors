8166617,5,B000M5FSLO,"This collection, not widely distributed, was released by Ray Stevens in 1996 as a best-of collection of 10 music videos. It features 6 ""latest"" music videos from his 1995 direct-to-home video movie, GET SERIOUS, and 4 ""greatest"" music videos from his groundbreaking 1992 home video, COMEDY VIDEO CLASSICS. The focus on the 1995 music videos was perhaps deliberate due to how popular his movie was among home video buyers in 1995-1996.

GET SERIOUS sold hundreds of thousands of copies through direct mail...meaning television commercials and print ads. After the direct market campaign ended it became available in retail stores across the country and it continued to sell strong enough to merit placement upon Billboard's video chart late in 1996 and it remained charted through the spring of 1997. The music videos on LATEST AND GREATEST would eventually become part of future DVD retrospective collections eliminating the importance of this particular collection except for those who are collectors and want just about every product available on Ray Stevens.
