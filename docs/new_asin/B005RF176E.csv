8484244,4,B005RF176E,"The only complaint that I have with the retailer with whom I purchased this dvd from----via AMAZON---is that it took longer than the promised-time to arrive.  HOWEVER, it DID FINALLY arrive.  What's the expression---"" I MAY BE S-L-O-W, BUT I GET THERE?""  SO -BE-IT.  Some of the other purchasers of this fine old film kind of b---hed about the film's quality.  REALLY!?  WHAT IN hell WERE THEY EXPECTING FOR THE NOMINAL-SUM that was asked for?  STEREOPHONIC SOUND?  DOLBY-DIGITAL?  Listen, this minor classic is so OLD & RARE, that it is extremely fortunate for we film-afficienados (sic) that we have this film at all!  This film has not been on television---cable or otherwise---in  DECADES!! And, to me, the quality was not bad, considering it's age.  I have seen other films older in copyright, but  LOUSIER IN CONDITION.  But you just can't please some people.  I for one, was not a bit disappointed in the dvd or it's quality.  Just in the retailer not keeping faith with me by  not letting me know that---due to circumstances beyond their control---the item would take longer to arrive.  Other than that, I find the film to be an excellent Western classic---and am QUITE CONTENT----FINALLY!!!",1406851200,,1199,4.939698492462312
8484245,3,B005RF176E,Good story. Good actors. Picture quality poor. This is a film that should be a candiate for AFI or UCLA to digital remaster this film.,1365379200,4,134,4.4
