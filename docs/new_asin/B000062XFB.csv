The Dope Game has a unique and in depth look inside the minds of criminals and the misfortune of innocence alike. Thorough character development is a very short amount of time. From the excursion to San Antonio to the post-deal meal finally being realized, The Dope Game is for real. Jesus and Navaras are boss.",1472947200,,421,4.552631578947368
1684479,4,B000062XFB,"The Dope Game was great, full of action, comedy and shootouts! It's about these two hired killers who decide to sell dope and transport it from Texas to California but at a pit stop the car full of drugs is stolen. They spend the next 90 minutes kicking ass and shooting anybody that gets in the way of there merchandise. Good job, great soundtrack Thanks!",1322438400,,356,4.492307692307692
1684480,1,B000062XFB,"This movie is so bad it makes you wonder if the directors were sandbaggin for laughs.  I simply cannot imagine anyone putting this piece of cinema together thought it would be anything but unintentionally hilarious.  Not only do the two main characters Jesus and Navalaja continuously talk about how hungry they are, their appetites actually are integral to the plot!  Our two hapless assassins have tired of killing and have decided to try their hand at, you guessed it, the dope game.  Their boss, ruthless California drug kingpin Logan, is portrayed so shockingly bad that you cannot imagine this guy got cast.  After you're done with the whole flick though, you'll see that this actor hit par for the course on his performance.  Jesus and his hot-blooded partner head to San Antonio, where the former's cousin has hook him up with a cheap source of heroin.  After using Logan's money to buy the heroin, their appetites get the best of them and the two caballeros have to stop and get their grub on.  After downing plate after plate of greasy enchiladas, as well as the biggest fruit bowl--or paletera for you gringos--I have ever see, they exit the restaurant only to find their rented Dodge Durango stolen.  They go on a massive killing spree, whacking everyone in this small town, and eventually track down their booty.  Let me just say that this movie has the worst acting, cinematography, sound, editing, and writing ever recorded, and that's being kind.  Fortunately, it's so bad that you can't help but laugh.  BTW--I think the audience was meant to be either stoned or drunk when watching this movie, so keep that in mind.",1063843200,2,1633,4.813620071684587
7957778,5,B000062XFB,"This is an exceptional movie, i am an ultra big fan of the quiroz bros. This and ""illegal business"" are their best stuff in my opinion. I guess a lot of people are just use to big studio formula movies that are really just made for profit, trying to give the audience what they want etc. whatever societal norms they expect for the product etc. and that's ok if it works for all involved, I just like movies with a cool factor and enough subtle nuances that make it appealing and capture the imagination, ""point break"" is the all time masterpiece. This is a cool movie, I could see this or ""illegal business"" being picked up by a big studio the way "" gone in 60 seconds""  or ""bangkok dangerous' was.",1520640000,,699,4.33587786259542
