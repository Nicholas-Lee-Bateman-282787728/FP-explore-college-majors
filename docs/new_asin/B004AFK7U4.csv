4308245,2,B004AFK7U4,"Five young adults charter an airplane for a getaway weekend. Sara pilots the plane which includes one other woman and three boys with testosterone problems who vie for her attention by putting each other down. The movie consists of a lot of blue hue scenes and facial close-ups. The ""monster"" in the movie was apparently created by the Pastafarians who wanted to introduce their god, the ""Flying Spaghetti Monster."" The characters were bad and unlikable. Most of the movie consists of bickering among the people in the airplane. While the five of them are in the plane, they ascend into storm clouds and are unable to escape the clouds which are the domain of the multi-tentacle monster you see on the cover. I thought the ending of the movie made the movie Twilight Zone-like, however the poor execution of the plot leading up to it, the inability to use the twist cleverly in the story, and the otherwise lousy scenes made the movie a stinker. It would have made a good 30 minute Creep Show episode. If facial close-ups of Jessica Lowndes is what turns you on, then by all means get this movie. (Worse than ""Frozen""!) The movie is rated R for language (rare f-bomb) and a ""sexual gesture."" That sexual gesture is one of the males pretending to be self-stroking a long shaft, which makes a statement about this movie.",1288396800,26,1318,4.685344827586207

C) The whole film had been about 30 minutes in length. As an ""airplane-in-trouble"" movie, it could have been OK. That is, minus the flying octopus. As it is, I found myself waiting for something interesting to happen, only to have all hopes dashed. Please, if you are expecting a horror / monster movie, just forget it.

4308248,2,B004AFK7U4,"The green screen 270-degree sheet that surrounds most of the plane gives us some good CGI of the storm outside.  The filmmakers outsourced the CGI to China, but it's a shame they also didn't outsource the script, direction, and acting as well.

The film's fails on most levels, but a production begins and ends with a strong script, and this film simply didn't have it.  Characters have to be likeable in order for us to care about their fate, and these 5 are very often cartoonishly obnoxious.  I didn't care that their lives were in danger.  In fact, I couldn't wait for them to be killed off.

There are some films that are so bad, they're good.  This one isn't.  It's so bad, it's bad.  Even clocking in at 82 minutes before the long 8 minute closing credit sequence, it feels long and ponderous in most places.

It is disheartening to see that there are a lot of people who dislike the film and I think we could stand to be able to step back and just appreciate what we get to see in film these days and the worlds, concepts and stories we are introduced to.

I mean a huge, tentacally thing in a dark cloud?! Maybe even in a sort of parallel dimension? Awesome!
IF there wouldn't be sobbing, annoying, screaming teenage like characters with weird reactions and even weirder script lines.
It is so hard to find the words to describe what I'm feeling right now after sitting through this prepubescent catastrophe.
The fact that there is barely any physical logic behind the story does not bother at all, its supposed to be a horror movie and thereby somewhat entertaining (I guess). But the silly, nonstop idiocy of unbelievable, illogical phrases that leave the mouths of those kids is just too much to take and way too much to take with the film. Half the time I was wetting myself the other half I was face palming like a champ.

4308265,2,B004AFK7U4,"Okay.  Just skip it.  I plan on spoiling the movie for you.  Just trust me when I say it will be even more spoiled for you if you watch it on your own.  I enjoyed laughing at this flick even though everything was spoiled for me.  Hell, the movie poster spoiled the movie for everyone!  I'll just leave the very end a disappointing mystery for your own viewing disapproval.  The effects are too bad for theaters but feel just about right for the sci-fi network, if that good.

Five friends--Sara (Jessica Lowndes; The Devil's Carnival, The Haunting of Molly Hartley), Mel (Julianna Guill; the Friday the 13th remake, The Apparition), Cory (Ryan Donowho), Bruce (Landon Liboiron; The Howling: Reborn) and Sal (Jake Weary)--set off on a trip together on a six passenger plane piloted by Sara, whose mother died while piloting a six passenger plane (dun dun dunnnnn!).  As we meet these late teens we find an immediate sexual triangle between Sal, Cory and Mel (who's dating uber-jerk-jock Sal).  Bruce is Sara's out-of-place friend-with-benefits who is suspiciously squirrely before getting on the plane--feels like the opening of Final Destination (2000), doesn't it?  They play out the various forms of teen angst well and clique-like jabs vying for top alpha dog status start almost immediately--still feeling like the Final Destination series.

Just as the bro-jibes start to hit a little too hard for comfort and the boy-girl tension starts rising there is a malfunction with the plane preventing them from descending.  Then, as if it came out of nowhere, they get trapped in a dark cloudy superstorm at high altitudes and now communication and navigation instruments are disabled as well.  Already, this film feels like a disaster film where the greatest downfall is the decomposition of social unity of the group... Sort of Lord of the Flies takes flight.

The problems continue to add up: distrust among the teens heightens, the jerk jock Sal is drunk and thinks he sees some ""thing"" in the clouds, they're losing fuel for some reason, they have too much cargo, they're lost, two of them get into a fist fight, another has a panic attack, another overdoses on drugs, and if they try to descend through the dark clouds to put an end to all this nonsense they just may hit a Canadian mountain and die!  But when the wings ice up in high altitudes and someone ""has to go OUTSIDE"" to manually fix the rudder-thing that is jammed and forcing them to ascend yet higher they finally work together.  But, hold on.  Some teenager is gonna' FIX the plane wing while dangling outside of a plane soaring through a storm?  Huh!?!?  Well, this leads to ""quite a realistic"" scene which, in no way, made me glad I gave this flick a chance.

The movie progresses (or, degenerates) and these teens start to die one by one--like ya' do.  As if we needed anything else to compound these kids' fate, Sal sees ""the thing in the sky"" again.  Yup, the tentacled thing that was spoiled for you the moment you saw the movie poster or blu-ray cover.  Evidently there's a gargantuan flying squid monster up there with them.  How it flies, I have no idea!

Anyway, after fixing the plane--oh, right, the teenager fixed a plane wing with a few dedicated kicks--so it can finally descend they somehow fail to see the ground after 20 minutes!  How high were they?  If they weren't panicking yet, now it's really setting in.  They start throwing around crazy hypotheses like they're part of an experiment, they've been drugged, or it's all a dream.  Thankfully this brainstorming session is interrupted by the thunderous rumblings of the sky kraken.

At this point the aero-octupus is trying to kill them and they're trying to kill each other.  It's anybody's game really.

So what's going on here?  The reason this is all happening to them is unspeakably stupid and what saves the final survivors is somehow upsettingly yet STUPIDER.  The action finale against the flying octopus should aggravate any and all viewers on the basis of physics, gravity, silliness, and the fact that a skinny teen was in a tug-of-warring stalemate against a 50 ton airborne octopod.  I'll repeat that last bit even though I'm giving the ""big scene"" of the movie away here...a teenager pits his strength against something over 500 times his size AND TIES in a tug-of-war.

WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?!?!?  If you thought that an entire movie filmed in the space of a six-passenger airplane was destined to fail, you were right!",1352246400,8,4473,4.806282722513089
4308266,2,B004AFK7U4,"As one of other reviewers very cleverly noticed, this little film could be easily mistaken for a slightly overextended episode of ""Outer Limits"". Five young people board a little plane to go on holidays. The girl who pilots, Sara (Jessica Lowndes), just got her licence and therefore she is quite happy that it will be a short flight and the weather is expected to be very good. But soon after the take off, troubles begin, with the plane getting out of control and flying very high, into an unexpected stormy weather. And then REAL problems begin...

The story seems really like one of those described in ""Outer Limits"" series and even if at one moment things begin to look a little bit silly, ultimately everything is very cleverly explained and the solution is not stupid at all. There are some really scary moments and the dark storm cloud in which most of action takes place gives to this film a unique (and quite opressive) atmosphere. Last but not least, Jessica Lowndes is a very attractive young lady and she plays quite well.

The bad thing are the dialogs - they are really really poor. Other than Sara the ""heroes"" are rather pathetic and they act mostly stupidly. There is not much humor and many developments (not all) are quite predictable. And this film is definitely too long - cutting it down to 70 minutes would be a very good thing.

All in all to my personal taste this is a little horror/SF film, not too bad, not very good, to see once. And I would rent it rather than buy, as it may be hard to sell later.",1338422400,,1529,4.4928057553956835
4308267,2,B004AFK7U4,"I think most people who have seen this movie agree that it will not win any awards. It isn't very memorable except for the characters being obnoxious and annoying. Thus, it's not very likely I'd recommend it to anyone.....over the age of 12. Then again, if you have a group of 5+ people with nothing to do and 'naked twister' is not an option, play this movie and grab your alcoholic beverage of choice. Trust me, it'll make the experience that much better if you think of it as something kitschy, like your neighbor's Pomeranian in haute couture.

Bottom line: If thin plot lines, confused endings, bad acting, horrible scripts and yelpy tweens offend you, stay far far away.

4308268,2,B004AFK7U4,"The main character (Lowdnes) can be praised for her efforts in this movie.  Not only is she the only person in this movie who makes sense, but she is also the only one who isn't a whiny high schooler.
I'm sure the other actors are just playing the script, but they were so annoying that I had to resist the urge to throttle the tv, and slap some sense into their heads.

I only paid $2.00 for this movie.  I only paid that because of the monster I saw in the previews.  I really need to stop watching any movies that begins with the sypnosis of: ""A group of college kids"", or ""Friends celebrating spring break"", etc.  Any horror movie that begins with something similar to that always seems to portray several characters you don't care about being killed, and leaves you scratching your head in frusteration as the characters make one stupid move after another.

I give it 2 stars for the monster, and Lowdnes, but I honestly can't recommend this movie to anyone.",1332201600,,963,4.474285714285714

4308270,4,B004AFK7U4,"This is an interesting take on the fate/destiny formula of thrillers out there.

When I first read the plot description on IMDB I thought this would be another meaningless ""Final Destination"" type of film: ""After a mysterious malfunction sends their small plane climbing out of control, a rookie pilot and her four teenage friends find themselves trapped in a deadly showdown with a supernatural force.""

I am glad to say this wasn't the case. Although this movie does use the whole fate/destiny formula, it's not a stupid, mindless gore fest like Final Destination.

The characters were interesting. The acting was very, very good especially by the lead Jessica Lowndes.

There are some surprises in the film including the aforementioned ""monster"" pointed out in the other reviews, but this wasn't a brainless monster film.

It manages very well to blend in a lot of different genres together from supernatural thriller to monster film to love story.

I would recommend it if you're looking for something a little different.",1319846400,3,1025,5.107784431137724
4308271,3,B004AFK7U4,"Five young people, making a routine flight aboard a small plane, end up taking a nightmarish and terrifying journey in Altitude (2010), a suspense thriller with supernatural elements.  Nearly the entire movie takes place inside a small twin engine commuter plane, during a flight that seems to go on forever.  At some point, the film passes from the realm of reality, leaving the viewer ""up in the air"" about what they are watching, until it appears that the flight is headed deep into Twilight Zone territory.

Largely filmed in the tight quarters of a mock up plane, against a green screen, Altitude heavily relies on special effects.  Once the plane flies into some dark storm clouds, the movie assumes a particular CG look that while consistent, isn't very realistic.  Although the cast appears to have some talent, they don't have the greatest material, as the writing has set its sights at a very low level.  With some major issues with the plot, the film's primary merit may lie in its technical achievements.

The film opens inside a small plane, where a woman is flying with a family aboard.  Something happens, and the plane suddenly goes down.  Flashing forward many years we meet Sara (Jessica Lowndes), the daughter of the pilot who died in the accident.  Sara is also a pilot, and is taking some friends on a flight to see a Coldplay concert.  The passengers are her best friend Mel (Julianne Guill), and her jock boyfriend Sal (Jake Wary), Sara's guitar playing cousin Cory (Ryan Donowho), and Sara's deadhead boyfriend Bruce (Landon Liboiron).

The group takes to the air in reasonably high spirits, but the mood changes when Sara allows Bruce to fly the plane.  After Bruce sends the plane into a dive, things deteriorate into childish bickering, highlighted by an aggravated Sal picking on Bruce, and tearing up his prized comic book.  During a climb, a loose bolt jams up the tail wing ailerons, causing the plane to be locked into a climb, where it soon becomes enveloped in black clouds.  Bruce eventually panics, and Sal uses his wrestling skills to render him unconscious, after which Bruce is tied up to keep him from acting up.  One of the group exits the plane attached to a rope, to try and free the ailerons.  Amazingly this crazy stunt works, but soon turns into a disaster, with Sal claiming that a monster is lurking in the skies.

With reality and time seemingly suspended, this adventure plays like a reworked episode of the Twilight Zone.  The extremely annoying air headed characters, are capable of little but arguing, and posing stupid questions.  The actors aren't totally to blame in this airborne soap opera, as the issues are mostly script and production related.  Jessica Lowndes is amazingly beautiful, but seems completely wrong for the role of Sara.  You might expect a pilot to have poise and be capable of calmly dealing with situations, but not here.  Bruce, who has the personality of a corpse, doesn't seem a match with Sara.  Sal is your stereotypical punk jock, with the mental capacity of a 14 year old.  Mel seems kind of normal, until she proposes the theory that they are in a dream, and never actually took off.  As the one of the least annoying, Cory is of course the first to go.

Writer Paul Birkitt's original dark and abrupt ending was revised to be more ambiguous and hopeful.  While the resolution is somewhat understandable, it's debatable whether those who get a second chance at the expense of those who die, are really deserving.

Altitude meets the technical challenges fairly well, but otherwise is kind of a mess, with pretentious characters, a monster that looks like it escaped from an episode of Voyage From The Bottom Of The Sea, and a silly comic book fantasy element that just isn't that appealing.  The implausible flight lasts for far too long, and the childish behavior, stupid dialog, and mentally challenged characters, tend to make this a rather frustrating viewing experience for those looking for something more substantial.  The film is entertaining, but unfortunately, mostly for the wrong reasons.  It is however, perfect material for the Sy Fy Channel.",1314489600,,4141,4.871428571428571
4308272,3,B004AFK7U4,"This one is quite interesting and has a interesting twilight zone type of storyline with that type of ending. It's not a bad movie in the least as the one star reviewers claim. If  you like the twilight zone or the outer limits then you will enjoy this one. The cast does a fine job and most of the effects look great, a few less so but this is low budget land and no effect is as bad in todays terms as some other flicks out there at this budget. (some scy fy movies for instance) However scy fy's tv shows are much better in that regard.  Anyways it does have the typical mindless aggressive jock character here but it other than that no other character is a flat stereotype here.

You won't want to watch it more than once...then again, you may not finish watching it the first time.  It is one of the slowest thrillers I've ever seen.  Odds are you'll never see these actors or actresses in a quality film.  And that's good.  The over-reactive cast and dialogue was laughable.  How can you spend 90 minutes on a plane that is destined to crash talking about relationships, jealousies and teenybopper diatribe?  AVOID!  Even if it comes on TV free of charge...AVOID!

4308274,2,B004AFK7U4,"There's a movie logic one has to follow when you go into films - the creators establishes 'this fact' and 'that fact'. And once established, as filmmakers, that's your guidebook. Regardless how monstrously ridiculous your story (no pun intended) you have to follow your own guide.

So when you accept a floating monster hiding in a storm cloud - that's your logic - you work the script from within that logic. What you don't do is create any number of illogical character inconsistencies to facilitate... nothing. There's no purpose to a solid one-third of what's seen in the film, pointless and truly misdirected character conflicts.

False drama is possibly one of the worst sins you can commit when scripting a film. Superimposing contrived energy when none should exist - thus breaking the guidebook - just to bunny-hump dramatic tension is a movie crime.

The fault lies with the director, Kaare Andrews, who clearly didn't or couldn't envision his own end product. What's called for is a gradual build-up toward a tension-filled climax, not filling every single minute of the film with melodrama. Seriously, this would be the movie equivalent of having every passenger screaming their heads off five minutes after boarding the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titanic/dp/B00000JLWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titanic</a>&nbsp;- days before it hit the iceberg.

'Altitude' is, at its core, a Twilight Zone episode, with an obvious nod to William Gaine's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/EC-Comics/dp/1888472731/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">EC Comics</a>. Tighter direction and this might've worked.

Still, I hope that Director Andrews (who I later learned comes from the world of comic books) learns from his experience and moves on to other film projects - he has the requisite skills.

A much better flick utilizing a similar set-up: '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frozen/dp/B0034G4OVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frozen</a>' (2009).",1305417600,2,2062,6.242957746478873

4308277,5,B004AFK7U4,"Altitude - one of the most overlooked and under-rated movies of 2010 - is a horror-thriller with science fiction flourishes that for the most part takes place in a small aiplane lost in the turbulent skies.  Sara (Jessica Lowdnes) is a newly licensed small-craft pilot who's flying herself and four friends across the country to see a concert.  It's at the tail end of their high school days, and one of several character-related undercurrents running through the movie is that (although no one wants to come out and say it) it's the stage of their lives where at least some of them will probably soon be going their separate ways.  A malfunction in the plane causes it to lose a lot of its insturment readings and to climb up a lot higher than it should, where it encounters stormy weather.  The turbulence is rough, the plane has a limited amount of fuel, the passengers are in some cases turning on each other, and, with the plane flying erratically in low visibility, there's no way to tell if they're hundreds of feet above the ground or up several miles.  So just finding a place to land is going to be difficult, let alone actually attempting it.  Then the movie starts to get weird.

  There's a lot of strange stuff and strange concepts tossed around in here; some apparantly thought it went overboard, I myself loved it.  For the most part it doesn't explain outright why things are happening the way they are, it puts out hints and possibilities and leaves the rest open to viewer interpretation.  An example is the initial plane malfunction: right from the start the question is there - was it just bad luck and a set of coincidences that made it unfold as it did, or did something bigger 'make' it happen?  Some have also found the movie too long, thinking that the story would have been better told as a much shorter segment in an anthology film like ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""Creepshow"".  I'd heard that position before seeing Altitude, but having seen the movie myself I wouldn't cut a single shot.  The movie is riveting, surprising, and done extremely well from a production angle, with excellent visuals and effects (yeah, stormclouds aren't the only things up in those skies...)  It's also...well, it might be giving the wrong impression to descibe it as romantically themed, but Altitude definately goes pretty heavy on the relationship angles.  Not only on the love front (although that's very present), but on other fronts like 'ally or enemy' as, within the storm-tossed plane, different characters begin to sort of vie for dominance of the situation, subtly at first and later more in open confrontations.  I don't want to talk to much about the last third of the movie, except to say it's great.  Too often too much gets said and previewed about the latter stages of a movie, taking away much of the surprise element.

Altitude deserves a far bigger audience.

4308278,2,B004AFK7U4,"I loved the whole plot of a malfunction causes a pain to increase in height with the passengers loosing their minds, but the whole supernatural aspect was what ruined the movie.

The acting wasn't that all bad but the plot really got bizare...in a bad way with the last 30 minutes left. The ending was predictable. I was thinking that was the case 20 minutes into the movie...at the latest.

They should have removed the crappy supernatural aspect and kept the plot simple and this movie would have been good.

Skip this movie.

Pros:
- Plot first hour
-Acting not that bad

Cons:
-Plot for the last half hour
-The twist ending...was so predictable",1301097600,,648,4.649122807017544
4308279,2,B004AFK7U4,"It's hard to write a review on this film without it turning into a complete spoiler. Mainly because there is so little in it to give away.

In a nutshell: Altitude is a 15-minute student film project that got stretched out to feature length and given a minor movie budget.

Despite a decent premise, hints of H.P. Lovecraft, and an attractive young cast, it just doesn't work. Mostly because the script goes absolutely nowhere after the first 20 minutes.

Basically the 'story' keeps looping on ""We're doomed! We can't get down! What's going on here? OMG! What is that?""

Nothing in the 'story' provides an explanation for what is happening, or even provides a fantasy context in which to place it. And what foreshadowing is provided by the ""fear of flying"" character and the absolutely ludicrous ""comic book revelation"" is amateurish and heavy-handed.

While the cast showed some dramatic promise early on, their overall performance level eventually deteriorates into pointless squabbling, screaming and tears. And the overall level of acting is less than what you'd see on TV in one of those 20-something 'angst' series the networks used to be so fond of.

I can't really fault the cast however. They obviously put themselves into it. But you can't make something out of nothing. Any actor needs a decent story and a well-crafted script to work with. And this film's lightweight script would have defied a seasoned veteran's attempt to wring anything resembling a performance out of it.

An ok movie to watch if you don't have anything else to do.

But don't expect very much - unless you want to be very disappointed.",1299024000,,1620,4.886861313868613
4308280,3,B004AFK7U4,"Good story and a good cast make this film worth a look. The ""Monster"" is a little weak but the director keep's the action moving right along. I kept waiting to see the monster and once I saw it I was disappointed, but the beast was not on screen much so I did not suffer long.

4308281,2,B004AFK7U4,"An intriguing premise crash lands with a tremendous thud.  Is ALTITUDE a horror movie?  A disaster movie?  A sci-fi/Fantasy?  All of the above?  Possibly, but it's too disjointed to succeed on any of these levels.
It becomes tedious with annoying/unlikeable characters trapped in a plane.  The CGI is subpar and leading actress Jessica Lowndes (90210) overdoes it pitifully.  The cop out ending is the final bomb.  A good idea gone awry.",1296000000,,437,5.056338028169014

I think its the expectations that ruins it. This is a movie shot in a small plane with a very tight plot and script. The story and acting was very griping. I was quite suprise, especially since the actors and people who made it were fairly new to the industry. Enjoyed this a lot and I hope you guys would give it a try... turn off the lights...

4308289,3,B004AFK7U4,"ALTITUDE is a somewhat fun film.  It has many touches of the Mythos.  However, it is different enough to be modern in perspective.  The basic plot centers on a group of young people renting a plane to go to a concert.  Their 90 minute flight takes a terrible turn for the worse and supernatural experiences follow.  They are caught in a perpetual climb and there is ""something"" outside in the storm clouds.  (Of course this is impossible because there are no loose bolts on planes.  Rivets hold most planes together, and all bolts are secured against vibrations.) There are truly bad scenes in the film such as the unlikely but indeed tense sequence of the exterior repair attempt of the plane.  In addition, the overblown character portrays are simply bad.  However, the film succeeds in a few small areas.  The premise is excellent.  The potential of the movie is just astounding.  The visuals are good, and the idea is sound.  It just fails to launch.  I want a good Cthulhu movie.  This is better than some by far, but it still does not measure up to the fullest potential it could.  (AM 1200 is the best Cthulhu attempt I have ever seen.)  ALTITUDE just falls short.  It is fun, but it is also weak.  The characters look great, but they are overdone.  They fail to make me care.  The ""happy ending"" cop out at the end disappoints me and makes me know that the film was not written for the Lovecraft fan.  All in all, ALTITUDE is a film that average movie goers can skip without regret.  However, if you are in search of a very minor Cthulhuesque experience it might be worth viewing for the potential it had.",1288656000,2,1613,4.505190311418685
