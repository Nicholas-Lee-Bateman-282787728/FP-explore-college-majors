4239025,5,B00405DUZS,"Did Fidel Castro's foresee back in 1959 where the rest of the world was heading: a contaminated planet?

Of course there are political, economical and cultural reasons that, in my opinion, forced Fidel to isolate himself from a materialistic world, but  that is not the subject of this interesting documentary.

It happened that after the collapse of the Soviets in 1990 Cuba, among many other things, was lacking in chemical fertilizers and so the regimen was forced to implement organic farming and organic gardening practices so much so that now there are thousands of organic fruits, vegetables and herb home gardens, and several organic farms on the island.

Since pesticides and herbicides are harmful to both the soil and the consumer the organic farming and gardening is having a positive long-term impact on the health of Cubans, not to mention marine and land wildlife.

Obviously Cuba has been through hell in the last five decades or so yet like a boot camp training that can transform a person into a skilled disciplined soldier, the agony the country has been through in the last half-century were needed lessons that would eventually turn the island into an environmental role model for the rest of the world.

4239026,2,B00405DUZS,"""Cuba: The Accidental Eden"" isn't really a nature documentary sensu stricto, but a political opinion piece. The documentary argues that Cuba has a virtually pristine nature, due to its lack of economic development and the U.S. embargo. (The lack of development is mentioned somewhat obliquely, perhaps in order not to insult the Cuban government.) When the embargo is lifted in the future, Cuba will be inundated by American tourists and foreign companies looking for oil and precious minerals. This might have an adverse effect on the island's unique fauna. Thus, ""Cuba: The Accidental Eden"" takes a kind of ""deep ecological"" perspective on Cuban affairs, presumably a more extreme one than the Communist government, which wants the embargo to be lifted and has developed the local tourist industry. The producers of ""Accidental Eden"" hope that the lasting revolution on the island will be Green, rather than Red.

I don't know much about Cuban environmental policy, but on the face of it, the documentary isn't convincing. Other socialist countries, such as the Soviet Union, Poland and China, had massive environmental destruction. There are also a lot of environmental problems in poorer nations, regardless of political system. If Cuba is different, the reason can't be its splendid socialist isolation per se. At several points, ""Accidental Eden"" hints at native dangers to the wildlife: poachers shooting the endemic Cuban Crocodile, farmers eating exotic snails and persons unknown raiding the nests of sea turtles. The documentary mentions a failed development project in 1989, which made the Cuban regime change its course and create new, vast national parks and reservations.

Here's a wild guess: perhaps Cuban environmental policy is so effective, because of...well, state repression? (A capitalist version of the same would be the Dominican Republic under Trujillo and Balaguer.) It's difficult to see how nature could be saved otherwise in an economy in free fall, which Cuba was after the cancellation of Soviet aid.

Somehow, this documentary raises more questions (and eye-brows) than it gives answers.",1374969600,5,2120,5.398791540785498

4239031,2,B00405DUZS,Maybe I expected too much after watching BBC's nature videos.  It did have some nice visuals but the overall tone seemed to be anti-American.  It seemed like they were blaming America for Cuba's wildlife conservation problems but then two minutes later it said that Cubans sneak on the beaches to steal sea turtle eggs to eat them.  I'll stick to BBC's videos from now on.,1322784000,5,372,4.6923076923076925

8412087,5,B00405DUZS,"This is an important documentary, I think the best of the Eden series by PBS. It is a look at the pristine Cuba, An Accidental Eden A paradise due to the isolation of Cuba. Now that the first tour boat has docked at Cuba, that paradise will soon disappear. This will happen due to the increase of sewage and traffic on beaches and other pristine areas. The Eagles song ""Last Resort"" has a line: ""You call some place paradise, kiss it goodbye."" So, get this documentary, so you can always see Cuba as it once was, before the tourist ruin it.",1462147200,,540,4.356435643564357
