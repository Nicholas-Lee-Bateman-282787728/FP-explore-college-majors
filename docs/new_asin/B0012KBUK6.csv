8558898,3,B0012KBUK6,"I wrote the scripted parts of this thing back in 1999. The ""producer"" said he wanted a Blair Witch parody immediately, so I saw the film and jotted down a very loose plot and some dialogue while I watched it. My theater ticket made up roughly half the production budget. Then ""Tammee"", ""Ignatius"" and I spent a few days shooting it in and around San Diego with me playing the straight man of the three. I was half smashed for much of the shoot. I vaguely remember seeing it once, with the rest of the cast, some fourteen years ago. I think I have a tape of it somewhere. Nothing to play it on, though. Just as well, probably. I think I was paid in peppermint schnapps.",1400630400,8,668,4.267716535433071
8558899,5,B0012KBUK6,I can't believe this movie is on here. I bought this on VHS in a bargain bin at the beach 10 years ago. It is absolutely hysterical and I have struggled to find even one other person who has seen or heard of it. I wonder how many copies of this exist in the world? If you happen to come across one BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT. I have had too many laughs watching this flick.,1368403200,3,367,3.779220779220779
8558900,5,B0012KBUK6,"This was the MOST EXCELLENT parody of ""The Blair Witch Project"" (btw - I HATED Blair Witch).  Unfortunately, very few people have even heard of this movie (including a friend of mine, who, to this day, maintains that I'm making it all up).  Silly, ridiculous hilarity ensues throughout the entire film.  For anyone who found Blair Witch to be an utter waste of time and money, I HIGHLY recommend this movie.  For anyone who's just looking to fill some time with laughter, I HIGHLY recommend this movie.  For anyone with even the slightest hint of a sense of humor, I HIGHLY recommend this movie.",1349568000,4,595,4.6826923076923075
