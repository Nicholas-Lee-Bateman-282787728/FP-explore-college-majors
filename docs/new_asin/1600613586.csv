Another important aspect of the video I think is how much inspirational it is to see somebody to draw with such love.
Will you be able to draw after having watch this video? obviously not, but you will have a very clear idea of what it takes and how you can face it.
This video stays and comes with me wherever I go.",1287273600,6,539,4.09433962264151
7922744,1,1600613586,"Not worth buying, another video of watching someone draw. What he talks most about is what kind of pencils he uses, no info. on how to draw the head or its parts. It's slow moving, boring, and once again I have waisted my money. I have been drawing for 40 years, and wanted to become better at portraits but no help on this dvd, if you are a beginner it still won't help. Doesn't matter how many credits this guy has to his name he can't teach. I won't sell or give this dvd to anyone, it would just get them mad so in the garbage it goes.",1273363200,11,539,4.0
