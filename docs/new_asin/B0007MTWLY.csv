8049036,2,B0007MTWLY,"VERY little useful content...maybe a total of 7-9 minutes of actual description and instruction. Mr. Nishioka's praises are extolled ad nauseum, and great things are promised for the additional videos in the series.

Oh, and the sound was horrible as well! The narrator's voice was distorted and ""pegged"" to the right channel.

So, based on this one, I'm just going to ""say no"" to the succeeding Judo volumes.",1273968000,,409,5.0

In this 3 Volume video series of which this is Volume 1, former United States Judo Champion, Hayward Nishioka narrates introductory level instructional information about Judo.  .  This video series is about the sport of Judo.  While Judo can also be used in self-defense, this video does not emphasize in any way the self-defense potential of  Judo. If  you are looking for self-defense applications of Judo, I recommend that you consider buying the book and 5 video series of  Wally Jay's Small Circle Jujitsu instead.

The first 14 minutes contains introductory information and warm up exercises such as stretching and calisthenics.  Exercises are done at the beginning of every martial arts school class to get students and participants ready for physical activity.  Without the warm up exercises, participants in any physically strenuous activity are at risk of  receiving an injury do to strained muscles, tendons, ligaments, etc.  Therefore, viewing the exercises serves to remind students and participants to do them.  Furthermore, watching the exercises offers the viewer who is not yet a participant a view of  what he or she can expect to be doing at the start of each class.

The next 8 minutes after the conclusion of the exercises shows students practicing various judo fall procedures.  This is also standard at all judo and aikido schools.  Students must prepare themselves to fall properly at the beginning of  the class to prevent injury when they are thrown to the ground.

The next 10 minutes of  this volume shows a series 10 various beautifully executed judo throws.  All the activities in Judo have Japanese names.  The practitioner or student needs to learn these names to recognize the activity to be done.  The throws demonstrated in this video include:  Osotogari,  Ogoshi,  Morote Seoinage,  Okuri Ashibarai,  Haraigoshi, Ippon Seoinage,  Ouchigari,  Tsurikomigoshi,  Taiotoshi,  Kouchigari.

Hayward Nishioka concludes instruction after only 32 minutes.

This video is not as long as indicated on the outside of the video cover.  The cover says that it is 45 minutes long.
But, Hayward Nishioka concludes the instruction after only 32 and  minutes.  He should have included video coverage of all those throws in his book, ""Foot Throws: Karate, Judo and Self-Defense"" which is a pretty good book on the subject.
As a further criticism, Hayward Nishioka needs to relax and speak normally or animate his voice a little when giving instruction on video.  In some parts of the video, his monotone voice seems to be reading a speech from paper which tends to bore an audience.  If you can overlook these criticisms you might want this video.  After all you can view the videos on days when you don't attend Judo class to help you remember how to execute a throw or how to say some of these Japanese words.  If you can't overlook these criticisms, there are other Judo video series available.  You can find many advertised in martial art magazines.  Look them up, call them and ask them to send you a complete catalog of their books and videos.
