However, a year later, I came across it again and was somehow compelled to put my 2-cents in.  I find most porn plots ridiculous & farcical, and this movie is no different.  However, the chemistry, acting, writing & directing all came together to make something that was overall really fun to watch.

Plot 3 Stars; Sex 3.75 Stars, OVERALL: 4.5 Stars because it's just so darn funny!  I saw it on HBO. The actors had great chemistry and looked like they were having a blast.  Brandin Rackley is so good with her Alien\Swedish\German accent & Christine Nguyen is always funny.  Plus, who doesn't love Porn Vet Evan Stone?  Though I didn't understand why he stayed FULLY dressed during scenes when it was obvious he could & should loose some of the flannel.  Yes, I said FLANNEL!  Those dirty blonds from beyond got around (literally & figuratively) & got lucky (also literally & figuratively) when they came upon (liter----, oh come on, that one is funny I had to do it) flannel wearing mountain man Evan Stone.  It was weird & awkward but maybe he had some medical reason & I'm a jerk for mentioning it.  All in all, it was one of the best soft porns i've seen (which isn't a lot relitively, just some Skinemax & HBO).  Kudos to the writer, director & cast.

P.S. the drunk old man was also AWESOME!!",1379808000,,1444,4.503846153846154
