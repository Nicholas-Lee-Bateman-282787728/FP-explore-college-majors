8117760,4,B000F5UMOE,Love all the advanced routines and this one did not disappoint. I love the non-stop routines for almost 60 mins. This product is for someone who is already active and familiar with the Tae Bo moves. It may be too much for a beginner or someone who is just getting into a workout routine as it requires a lot of energy to keep moving for almost the whole hour.,1276905600,,359,4.217391304347826
