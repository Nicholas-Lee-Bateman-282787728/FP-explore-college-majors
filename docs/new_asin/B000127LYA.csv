1966395,4,B000127LYA,"The immortal ""Charlie Brown All Stars"" - 5 stars

The new ""Lucy Must be Traded"" - 4 stars

The mediocre ""Spring Training"" - 3 stars

Since ""All Stars"" and ""Spring Training"" have been around a long time, I'll limit my comments to ""Lucy Must be Traded"".

This is definetly the best of the post Schultz era so far. It recaptures some of the old magic. The jazzy piano background music is very reminiscent of the glory days.

Charlie is a little less wishy-washy in this outing. He's determined to get his worst player, Lucy, off the team.  You'll have to watch to see what happens.

I recommend this DVD to any true Peanuts fan.",1117670400,,625,4.4298245614035086
1966396,3,B000127LYA,"""Lucy Must Be Traded, Charlie Brown"" first aired on ABC-TV in 2003 to mixed reviews; it's now available on DVD along with two additional baseball-themed TV specials, and each one is ideal for someone in your family.
""Charlie Brown's All-Stars"" was the followup to the highly acclaimed 1965 Christmas special, and it features the same original cast of voice talents. Charles Schulz' script is fast and funny with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. There's also an inspirational scene where Schroeder berates his teammates for abandoning their faithful manager. Animation buffs have pointed out a lack of attention to detail in the drawings compared to the later specials, but the high quality of the gags more than makes up up for it. Recommended for the whole family, especially for long-time Peanuts fans.
""It's Spring Training, Charlie Brown"" was produced for CBS-TV in 1992, but wasn't completed in time for the start of the baseball season. It eventually went straight to video. Long-time Peanuts fans were appalled at the use of a techno-synth score in place of the light jazz that had become the trademark of the series. Other contemporary touches included touch-tone phones and a rap-style production number performed by Franklin. The pint-sized baseball player Leland is cute and funny, but there's little else here for adults to enjoy. Recommended only for younger kids.
""Lucy Must Be Traded, Charlie Brown"" aired on ABC-TV in 2003, and was compiled from strips dating back to the late sixties. The result is the funniest Peanuts special in recent history.  Charlie Brown and Lucy throw insults back and forth like Abbott & Costello; he watches helplessly as she gleefully sabotages every game. The gags come at a leisurely pace, and David Benoit's faithful renditions of Vince Guaraldi's original scores are a pleasure to hear. Marcie appears briefly as Lucy's replacement, but she turns out to be truly dumb about baseball, whereas Lucy merely pretends to be dumb. Recommended for the whole family, especially older kids.
My preferred lineup: ""All-Stars"" first, ""Traded"" second, ""Spring Training"" last. I leave you with these words of baseball wisdom from Charles Schulz: ""Winning isn't everything... but losing isn't anything!""",1112486400,5,2238,5.251396648044692
1966397,4,B000127LYA,"Sometimes I feel a bit taken advantage of by Paramount. I suspect they know I will purchase every Peanuts DVD they deign to make, no matter what, and they take advantage of me. This disc features three baseball-themed half-hours on it, including one really good one.
The title cartoon is 2003s Lucy Must Be Traded, Charlie Brown. Its a cute cartoon, like most of the recent ones a compilation of like-themed comic strips set to animation. Its sweet, its fun, but it doesnt quite pop.
Charlie Browns All-Stars, the classic cartoon in this set, DOES. Charlie Brown convinces his baseball team to stick around with the promise that Mr. Hennessy, the hardware store owner, will sponsor the team and buy them uniforms. The deal is jeopardized, however, when Charlie Brown learns that joining a league would force him to kick Snoopy and the girls off the team. Out of all the older Peanuts cartoons, this is one of the ones with the strongest emotional content and real message. Its a touching cartoon, even today.
Its Spring Training Charlie Brown from 1992 closes off the set and, frankly, leaves me scratching my head. Apparently the league has relaxed their rules, because this time out Mr. Hennessy is again offering to sponsor Charlie Browns team and get them uniforms... but ONLY if they can actually win a game. Following the same plot as the previous cartoon, it was probably a mistake to put them on the same DVD. And the weird rap Franklin performs makes me think it may have been better not to put this one out at all -- it was just plain annoying.
This is a decent set, and with Paramount dropping the prices on the Peanuts DVDs theres almost no reason for a real fan of the characters NOT to buy it.",1078876800,27,1707,4.618421052631579
1966398,1,B000127LYA,"Since the 1960's, Peanuts TV shows have graced the airwaves.  Most, especially those shown in the 1960s and 1970s, were very good.  The quality of the programs started to decline in the 1980s as holiday specials were replaced with theme shows (The ""This is America, Charlie Brown"" series is an example).  But all in all, if you loved Peanuts, you loved these shows.
When Charles Schulz passed away in 2000, his family decreed that they would allow additional Peanuts TV shows to be produced provided that the shows were based off of Schulz's comic strips.  No original stories involving the Peanuts gang could be developed since, obviously, Schulz wouldn't be the one creating those stories.
The problem with these new shows, like ""Lucy Must Be Traded"" is that they have no real story to them.  They are just 30 to 45 second vignettes hodge-podged together with very little to tie them to one another, much like the old ""Charlie Brown and Snoopy"" TV show that was aired on Saturday mornings in the 1980s.  It's basically a live version of several comic strips with a baseball theme.  Very uninteresting and not something to celebrate the memory of the greatest cartoonist of the 20th Century.
I hope that the Schulz family will retire the Peanuts characters from TV as they did with the strip, which I felt was the right thing to do.  Charles Schulz deserved better.",1075075200,20,1366,4.782978723404256

8005331,3,B000127LYA,Good episode of Peanuts.  However it is one that I found to be not what I thought of when it comes to the Peanuts gang since Lucy is not out to get Charlie Brown like she does when she has him to try and kick the football while taking it away causing him to fall.  Lucy is the problem instead of Charlie Brown.  But it might still be the episode for you depending on your taste and idea of the Peanuts gang.,1429056000,,407,3.9390243902439024

8005333,4,B000127LYA,"LUCY MUST BE TRADED, CHARLIE BROWN was a ""Peanuts"" special that aired on tv in 2003, after Charles Schulz died. Basically, in ""Lucy Must Be Traded, Charlie Brown"" Lucy is shown to be a horrible player (much worse than Charlie Brown is at being a pitcher) and Charlie Brown want to make a trade with Peppermint Patty in an attempt to improve his team. The short isn't quite up to the best of the ""Peanuts"" specials, but it's not too bad either.

The disc includes two other baseball related ""Peanuts"" specials: CHARLIE BROWN'S ALL-STARS and IT'S SPRING TRAINING, CHARLIE BROWN. CHARLIE BROWN'S ALL-STARS first aired on tv in 1966 and was follow-up to the highly successful 1965 A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS. The special features the same voices that were used in A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS. Basically, everyone on Charlie Brown's team quits after they lose the first game of the season. However, Charlie Brown learns that Mr. Hennessey, who owns and operates Hennessey's Hardware Store, wants to sponsor the team and buy them uniforms. Charlie Brown is elated. Later he learns that the league won't accept girls or dogs on their teams so if Charlie Brown's team is going to get uniforms, he'll have to cut all the girls and Snoopy. He decides not to tell the team until after the next game. I love the lines between Charlie Brown and some of the other characters in this special. For instance, early on Charlie Brown says, ""For one brief moment victory was within our grasp,"" and Linus then replies, ""And then the game started.""

The other special on the disc is IT'S SPRING TRAINING, CHARLIE BROWN. This special was produced in 1992, but never aired on prime time tv. Instead, it was released on video on 1996. Mr. Hennessey agrees to sponsor Charlie Brown's team and get them uniforms, but in order to do so they have to win their next game. The game doesn't feature any light-jazz and instead has a more synthesizer-heavy score, perhaps inspired by the rapping Franklin does in this special. The special also features Leland, the younger brother of Frieda. I love ""Peanuts"", but of all the ones I've seen this is one of the weakest in the franchise.

Overall, LUCY MUST BE TRADED, CHARLIE BROWN is a good ""Peanuts"" disc to own, featuring one superb ""Peanuts"" special (CHARLIE BROWN'S ALL-STARS), one average ""Peanuts"" special (LUCY MUST BE TRADED, CHARLIE BROWN), and one lackluster ""Peanuts"" special (IT'S SPRING TRAINING, CHARLIE BROWN.",1398556800,,2436,4.850961538461538
