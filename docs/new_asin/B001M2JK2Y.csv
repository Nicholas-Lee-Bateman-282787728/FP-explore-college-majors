8320336,4,B001M2JK2Y,"This is a documentary of a role-playing group somewhere near Boston, MA as they spend three months of real time playing in the Assemblage of the Crystal Sphere campaign using D&D 3. X rules.

Just to manage expectations, this is not a fantasy film.  This is not a Hollywood script.  This is a very real gaming group that is being filmed over a three month period.

The director/film crew does a good job of presenting the players and dungeon master (DM) in neutral tones.

The production quality is actually pretty good.  The lighting and clarity of the scenes are well done.

There is a little art here and there, e.g., a cut-away when describing a player not in the scene being filmed, but by and large this is a straight-forward look at the gaming table with some side interviews of the DM and players.

There are no heroes and no villains in this movie.  Don't expect to either wildly identify with or to actively dislike anyone in the film.

That is OK, you're not supposed to.  :-D

I would use this film in the future for showing potential players what a gaming group/session is like.",1443398400,,1091,4.538461538461538
8320337,3,B001M2JK2Y,"The Assemblage of the Crystal Sphere: A Dungeons and Dragons Story (Brad Rego, 2008)

There's kind of a built-in protection The Assemblage of the Crystal Sphere has against my main criticism. To summarize this entire review in two sentences: (a) The Assemblage of the Crystal Sphere is a very vertical-market piece of filmmaking; this is one for the geeks, and pretty much no one else is going to get it. (b) The movie's subtitle basically assures that no one else is going to be interested, so who cares?

The movie is a mockumentary documenting the final three months of a half-decade-long campaign headed up by Dungeon Master Peter (Michael Coelho in his only screen appearance to date) and played by friends Ed (Frank Lewis), Roger (Robert Collins), Betsy (Jessica Brunelle), and William (Matthew Moniz). (Of the four, only Brunelle and Collins have appeared in front of a camera before, both in Rego's 2006 short The Vial.) As the group get closer to the final session, tensions within the group erupt. And if the question that's going through your head is are the events in the game going to affect the real lives of these players? instead of are the events going on in real life going to affect what's going on in the game?, then you're likely watching the wrong movie.

As I noted above, this is one for the geeks. There are a number of gaming scenes (according to IMDB's trivia section, mostly improvised  [...]), and if that's not something you do, you're unlikely to see the appeal; at least, that's been my experience (I've been a D&D player on and off since I discovered the game in middle school in the very early eighties). Rego made some attempts to defuse that aspect and appeal to a broader audience with some of the film's comedy; I'm not sure they worked in that regard, though in most cases they do as comedy. (One of the comedic set-pieces that takes place in the what happened next? sequence at the end is the only one that doesn't work as a comedic set-piece; leaving a couple of minutes of it on the editing room floor would have improved its comedic value tremendously.) But that doesn't matter as long as you're a gamer; it is entirely possible that you will see yourself in this, and Rego's use of non-actors here drives that home even more. Few things detract from the mockumentary feel more than people who are good at making themselves seem like they're playing a role, but not good enough to get so far into the role that they start portraying the innate awkwardness most people display when they have a camera pointed in their faces. Because of the way the movie is structured, it's safe, I think, to hazard a guess that most of these folks really are non-actors. The exception is Brunelle. Why I think so: there's a scene about two-thirds of the way through the movie where Ed and Roger are standing out on the back porch after a gaming session and Betsy comes storming out of the house, gets into her car, and drives off. (We learned a little earlier in the movie that they play in Betsy's house.) The shots in this sequence give Brunelle a real chance to show off without being flashy, and she nails it. We should be hearing a lot more from her in the future.

The drawbacks I've alluded to in various places above. I'm not quite sure Rego knew quite where he wanted to go with this moviewhether he wanted to make a film for the hardcore gamer geeks or try to appeal to a broad audience. As a result, the movie ends up not being a fantastic distillation of either, though it definitely falls hard on the gamer-geek side of the fence. There are also a few pacing problems, mostly towards the end of the film, but nothing huge. If you get it, you will get it. If you don't, giving this a miss will not adversely affect your life in any way. ** ",1399593600,,3778,4.524158125915081
8320338,1,B001M2JK2Y,"I entirely agree with the reviews by Julian Kennedy (""Broken Base"") and ranjr (""Dull as Dirt""). However, I don't think they go far enough into the faults of this ""film"". Yes, as a mockumentary it fell flat, but I found that to be the least of its problems. If one is going to make a film, don't you think one should understand that subject matter?!  Well, the creators of this film (and possibly everyone involved in it) seemed to know nothing about the third edition of D&D!  This film was so full of complete inaccuracies that I had trouble paying attention to the ponderous plot.

I call upon all the D&D players out there! Can you possibly think of a situation where any character (and these characters were supposed to be level 33) can cause 86 points of damage with a 1d4 dagger? Also, why would a party of four 33rd level characters have trouble fighting any dragon? And when does one roll a d20 for damage or a d4 to disarm a trap?

And those are but a few examples in a constant stream on inaccuracies. In short, nothing about the framework of this ""film"" was accurate. These people were not playing 3rd edition D&D at all!

As another reviewer wrote, I highly recommend Gamers and Gamers II: Dorkness Rising (pretty much anything from Dead Gentlemen Productions) instead of this failure.",1271116800,,1297,4.573275862068965
8320339,1,B001M2JK2Y,"Just finished watching this film and it was BORING really, really boring. I am a gamer (regularly), can and love to laugh at table and game-nerd (self) effacing humor.

The ""mockumentary"" angle was way too subtle leaving any attempt at humor flat and the vast majority of the movie is just individual interviews with uninteresting characters and very bad actors (even for camcorder/indie/amateur fare). The gaming scenes are just as bland as the whole with some star trek trivia inserted. Basically avoid this load of... well BLAH!

8320340,1,B001M2JK2Y,"Right off the bat, yes, I'm an avid gamer. I can very easily laugh at myself and my hobby, so that's not why I'm about to pan this movie.

To be fair, I give these guys credit for persistance. They nagged friends of mine who work in two separate local game stores to carry this DVD. As a result, and because my friends value my opinion, I got a chance to sit down and watch this movie for free...and I still want a refund.

This movie is like being trapped at while a D&D player insists on telling you about his character or a game he played in. We all found it dull and uninspiring, and, in the interest of total honesty, we could not get all the way through it.

There are better movies about gaming, serious and non. I recommend you seek them out and save your money for them.",1260662400,,779,4.1118421052631575
8320341,4,B001M2JK2Y,"I gotta say.. well done. I do believe the fact that I use to play 2nd edition really helped me as a viewer.

I found this to be very funny... I enjoyed the references to other sci fi genres... I nearly spit my coffee out when one of the primary characters mentioned Jean-Luc. LOL.

The group dynamics are spot on.  The role-playing is spot on.  If you ever played D&D and enjoyed it, you will enjoy this film.  However, I doubt this film is for your average TGIF viewer.  But for some reason, I don't think 221 intended this film for everyone.",1259625600,,543,4.2745098039215685
8320342,1,B001M2JK2Y,"The Assemblage of the Crystal Sphere: A D&D Story: 1 out of 10: This is a film about five people playing a five-year D&D campaign. The film seems shot in real time. That is, it consists of people rolling dice and well talking; for an hour and a half. Yup' (Sounds of fingers tapping)

Okay let me deconstruct this a little. The filmmakers claim this is a mockumentary, unfortunately the mock part is so subtle as to be, well non-existent. So instead, you have five people you do not know, playing an D&D game, you aren't a member of. It is worse than those celebrity poker shows'. Much worse.

I am really starting to think there is not any flotsam that you can capture with a digital video camera nowadays that you cannot call an 'indie' film. A store security tape might have made a better movie than this nonsense.",1248825600,3,817,4.44
8320343,5,B001M2JK2Y,"As the previous reviewer stated, this is a mockumentary, but none-the-less, it most ceratinly is a ""movie"". Along the lines of Best in Show, Spinal Tap, or A Mighty Wind, The Asseblage of the Crystal Sphere holds its own. The acting is amazing for a small budget film and the writing/material is on a level of its own. It brought back a lot of great memories to see this movie, and anyone who has ever played or known anyone who played D&D will love this movie. Those who have not can laugh at it as well, it's just that good.",1235952000,,526,4.27
8320344,2,B001M2JK2Y,"This is not a movie per se.  It's a mockumentary.
Has it's moments, but if you're looking for some sort of action movie this is not it.
If you enjoy watching films where people talk about what they did whey they played AD&D then you'll love it.",1235952000,,244,4.191489361702128
8320345,5,B001M2JK2Y,"As someone not as D&D savvy who is dating someone who is D&D savvy, I initially watched this film just to play the role of a good girlfriend.  I figured most of it would go over my head and I would just grin and bear it.  I was wrong. Very wrong.  It was witty, interesting and completely hilarious.  Not to mention the characters were real people going through real things...not caricatures of people. That is actually what my boyfriend loved most about it.  He feels like he has watched a few D&D movies at this point only to be faced with cheesy overdone fake characters, where this movie is much more true to life, making it much funnier. He, the D&D player, LOVED it... as did I.  I completely recommend it to anyone and everyone.",1228867200,4,735,4.407407407407407
