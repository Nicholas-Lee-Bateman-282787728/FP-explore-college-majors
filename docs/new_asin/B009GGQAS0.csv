8541266,5,B009GGQAS0,"I had the extreme pleasure of not only meeting Mr. Grappelli, but having the opportunity to study with him on a couple of occasions,  just informal playing together.  Marvelous man, truely unique.  The world is a poored place for his passing, but much, much richer musically for the 200 or so albums he recorded during his lifetime.  I have several pictures of him that I treasure above all of the others in my own long carrer.  I only hope I am still playing as well as he did when he reached the age of 85 . This DVD is full of information and footage of the man from way back in the 1930/40's that is not readily avalible.  Watch his bowing technique.  That is the true source of his brilliance and expression.  He never played the same thing exactly the same twice.  But  the listener can always tell it is Stephane Grappelli who is playing.  Absolutely no one sounds like him.  Jazz violinists will enjoy this.  Some others will also.  If you do not like this style of Jazz, you will not like this DVD.  I recommend surround sound.  Like I said watch his bowing technique.  Cest Magnifique!!!!  WNL",1388534400,,1103,4.457286432160804
