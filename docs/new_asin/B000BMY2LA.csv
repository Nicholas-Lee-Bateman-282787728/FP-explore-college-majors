2425146,5,B000BMY2LA,"Did not know what to expect from this film. And boy was I surprised. It's a really solid movie that takes you on a fantastic slow, funny, tragic ride. Evan Rachel Wood, James Woods, Elisabeth Harnoir, Ron Livingston, Selma Blair - the enitre cast for that matter - all do an amazing job. Micheal Hitchock cracked me up as the Headmaster. Kudos to the filmmakers for taking chances and making a great dark comedy. It's not without it's flaws but I gave it five stars becausse I found myself taliking about it five days after I saw it. Very few films have that sort of impact. Worth checking out. I only wish the DVD had extras.",1138233600,6,626,4.405172413793103
2425147,5,B000BMY2LA,"This film is so devisive - I have not found two people that agree 100% and that is what makes it great. I find it strange when people say it wants to be ""Heathers"" or ""Election""

I have read a few interviews with the writer and the director and i think they just made an independent film that no studio would make. Pretty Persuaion made me think, it made me mad, it made me laugh, and it made me cry. So many films these days are forgetable. This is one that sits with you for a long time. I highly recommend it!",1137801600,6,512,4.019607843137255
2425148,1,B000BMY2LA,"... who's radiant and great and really makes an admirable effort with the material, even though the script is tone-deaf, smug, obvious, contrived and trying way too hard to be shocking.

Listening to the author's hamfisted, heavy-handed, wrong-headed attempts at satire is like listening to a guitarist play with strings that are all out of order and out of tune.

The only reason this film rates any comparison at all to ""Heathers"" or ""Lord Love a Duck""  is because it really wants to be the '05 version of those dark little classics.

The film's main inspiration, though, is clearly Alexander Payne's ""Election.""  The only problem is ""Election"" -- with its brilliant, dead-on combination of Stanley Kubrick and John Hughes -- doesn't need a little sister, especially one of ""Persuasion's"" synthetic ilk.  If you watched this and thought it was good, see ""Election,"" because you're in for a better, bitter little treat.",1137801600,4,920,5.059602649006623
2425149,3,B000BMY2LA,"In this movie, it is okay.  Not too good, but not too bad.  Although it is a teen, high school movie, it is not as good as other same type of movies that I saw before.  For the story, it talks about Manipulative high school sophomore Kimberly Joyce (Evan Rachel Wood) leads her friends Brittany Wells (Elisabeth Harnois) and Randa Azzouni (Adi Schnall) in bringing charges of sexual assault against Percy Anderson (Ron Livingston), their English and drama teacher at an exclusive private school in Beverly Hills. Meanwhile, local reporter Emily Klein (Jane Krakowski), originally assigned to do an insignificant piece on the school, hopes that the scandal will launch her into celebrity in the television news business, while Kimberly's bigoted father, Hank (James Woods), is concerned primarily with the effect that his daughter's accusations may have on his business.  As a result, the attack on Percy Anderson failed and the three girls are suspended from that high school.  For this story, it is just like a general story with not much surprise.  For the acting, they are all okay.  However, I like Evan Rachel Wood acts as Kimberly Joyce, she suits to act and she acts well as one of the ""bad girl"" role as Kimberly Joyce.  For the direction, it is good because the whole structure looks logical.  For the visuals, it is not much of a surprise.  However, I like the DVD make in 2:35.1 widescreen version.  Although this movie is not very well known, it is essential to make it to this extreme widescreen version because in my opinion, 2:35.1 widescreen DVD is more like a ""movie"".  For the sound effects, it is so-so.  It is because it is not much of the real exciting scenes in this whole movie.  For the music, it is okay because it is pretty general.  Overall, this movie is okay, kind of in the middle range.",1136160000,,1817,4.705696202531645
2425150,5,B000BMY2LA,"From Smother Magazine - smother.net:

Evan Rachel Wood (""Thirteen""), Ron Livingston (""Office Space"", ""Band of Brothers"", ""Adaptation""), James Woods (""The Virgin Suicides"", ""Any Given Sunday"", ""Casino"", ""Diggstown"", and Selma Blair (""Can't Hardly Wait"", ""Hellboy"", ""Cruel Intentions"") all star in a movie that is part ""Election"" and part ""Heathers"". Among the super-elite and rich students at a Hollywood high school are three students led by precocious and delightfully tasteless Kimberly Joyce played with the same ferocious nature that Evan Rachel Wood used in her character in ""Thirteen"". The other is an Arab immigrant and Grace who Selma Blair adds the same innocence and gullibility that she effortlessly guided in ""Cruel Intentions"". They accuse their English teacher (Ron Livingston) of sexual abuse and gain notoriety as well as some infamy as the case goes to trial. The movie is engaging and hilarious in a dark sense. One of the best and funniest scenes in the movie is James Woods character on a phone sex conversation and then whipping his face with some spoiled tissue paper. Revenge isn't always what you imagine it to be about.",1135987200,5,1144,5.251366120218579
2425151,4,B000BMY2LA,"Don't be misled by the review comments on the front of the box. This movie is neither ""extremely funny"" nor is it ""a comedy brimming with zesty shock value"". There really isn't anything funny about teen suicide or high school shootings, nor does this movie try to suggest that there is. Instead the story is about a girl whose life has been made painful by the death of her brother in Iraq, a mother who deserted her, a father who is an obnoxious slob, a best friend who stole her boyfriend, and the part of Ann Frank in the school play that gets taken away from her and given to the same ""best friend"". What makes the main character, Kimberley, special is that she maintains her poise despite all these negatives, at least on the outside. Only towards the end of the movie do we really get anything like a glimpse of the torment that is raging inside of her, and the harsh, mechanical, even cold exterior that she must maintain in order to keep her internal world under control. The comment made by the father of the Muslim girl at the end of the movie is the most poignant - ""We came here in search of the American Dream...and instead we found a nightmare!"" The movie, to me, is an indictment of western society, of the mess we have made of our families, our communities, our value system, and ultimately it's about the pain and suffering this heaps on our children. Excellent performance by the lead actress.",1135036800,17,1411,4.4728682170542635
2425152,4,B000BMY2LA,"This is a decent little dark comedy. Very funny at times, and sometimes very strange. This film's strong points are Evan Rachel Wood, of ""Thirteen"" and Stark Sands, of ""Die mommie, die"" and ""11:14.""Stark has a meaty role in Clint Eastwood's ""Flag of our fathers"" coming fall, 2006. He is a wonderful actor, and on the verge of breaking out big-time.",1134777600,2,349,4.737704918032787
2425153,1,B000BMY2LA,"My attention towards this movie was first caught in a review written in ""Video Business Magazine"" that said that Pretty Pesuasion was a movie that we would get if John Waters had directed Heathers.  They also compared it to another one of my all time favorite comedies, Election.  So when I saw this available on DVD for rental, I picked it up (and it was a free rental, thankfully.)

What would I compare this movie to?  Perhaps a little of Wild Things meets Mean Girls meets a train wreck.  It's hardly a break through role for Evan Rachel Wood (Thirteen did that for her nicely, thanks) and the rest of the cast just meanders about on screen aimlessly, as if waiting for some competent direction Marcos Siega, but Marcos doesn't succeed in the transition from music video/tv episode director to movie director very well.  If this movie had been shortened to an hour long pilot for a TV show, it would have worked so much better.  However, as a feature length movie, it's too long.

James Woods is quite interesting in his role as Hank Joyce, but his character, like so many others in the movie, are not fleshed out enough for me to care about them.  I hardly even care for Evan Rachel Wood's character, but am  I supposed to?  She is a horror of a human in this movie, and the most sympathy I feel is for the characters around her, particularly in the characters of Britney and especially Randa.

It's listed as a comedy, but there are too many depressing things in this movie to make it even a good black comedy.  I won't go into too much in my review, as I don't want to write any spoilers, but one scene in particular towards the end (and if you have seen it, you should know what I am talking about) is devastating, and for what little laughs were in the film, it makes you forget any ""comedy"" you saw before then.",1133308800,6,1821,4.4

2425176,4,B000BMY2LA,"This movie was definitely interesting to say the least. There was some dark humor mostly towards the beginning.  The whole thing film itself was just- after you finish you kind of have this gnawing pit in your stomach.  You feel pretty horrified throughout the movie and it just mounts and mounts and you want to turn away but you feel like you need to finish it since you've started it.

I do have to say I was confused by the flashbacks initially- as a whole they do make more sense.  There was more than once I thought I must have skipped ahead or done something because I felt a little lost in the storyline (even though it's pretty straight-foward) but it does start to make sense about half way through you realize why the flashbacks are being entered at certain times.

2425220,4,B000BMY2LA,"I am really having a 21st century problem. There are too many choices of things to watch. I have always been a movie person over TV. I never cared much for the noise of TV commercials, so my only time spent with a TV screen was to watch a movie. Before the days of streaming, and even before Netflix (remember when you used to have to wait to get the DVD in the mail?) I loved nothing better than dimming the lights and having 2 hours of uninterrupted entertainment. It just seemed like a special treat. But lately, I skim over choice after choice on Amazon and Netflix. Movies that probably would have excited me before, I think, hmmm, meh... surely, there is something better, something more perfectly suited to my mood. And I end up watching nothing at all. The cover of Pretty Persuasion caught my eye. I was attracted to the gothic look of it. The slow unspooling of this twisted tale held me spellbound in a kind of is-this-really-horrible-or-really-great-? kind of way. It reminded me of a David Lynch movie in that regard. I was both repelled and transfixed. In the end, I felt weirdly gratified. The description of the movie is accurate. If the story line appeals to you, you might try it, like I did. The main reason I gave 4 stars instead of 3 was for the psychological twists. Evan Rachel Wood's character is smarter and darker than your average teen anti-hero and I couldn't quite catch her until the very end when the cloud of her apocalypse is mushrooming in the sky.",1476230400,6,1482,4.5130111524163565

2425236,4,B000BMY2LA,"WARNING: POTENTIAL SPOILERS

As other reviewers have said, this movie is pretty raunchy. But the truth is, much of real life is unpalatable, especially life in Hollywood for those who are ambitious. The story is a little over the top, but nonetheless there are teenagers who have no moral compass and who care only about themselves and their desires. If they are strong and determined enough, they mow down anyone who gets in their way, as the main character in this movie, Kimberly, does. It is obvious she is a manipulative psychopath almost from the first scene. The only question is her real motive, which is finally revealed after she has offered up a number of false motives to enlist the aid of her friends in her quest.

This movie is not for those who find vulgar language and semi-explicit sex scenes unacceptable. There is no actual nudity and no graphic sex, merely reaction shots. But there are quite a few of those. None of the above bothers me, but it might offend some viewers. Just a heads up.

In some ways, the main character reminds me of the boy in We Need to Talk About Kevin, except Kevin had loving parents who did their best to give him a good life. Kimberly's parents are the stereotypical Hollywood parents: Her father is on his third wife and has no time for Kimberly, even though she is living with him, and her mother barely remembers her birthday with a phone call. Kimberly's role models are all selfish, narcissistic, and worthless as parents. It is not incidental that a school shooting occurs in this movie. It is not at Kimberly's school, but the parallels between the damage Kimberly causes and the damage the school shooter causes are obvious.

Honestly, I feel a little dirty after watching this movie. Not from the sex or the foul language, but from the way it depicts human beings treating other human beings. Unfortunately this is becoming more and more common, especially with social media practically exploding. With the anonymity it offers, people can say the most horrific things to others with no consequences whatsoever.

The frequent remarks made to her step-mother in a nonchalant manner about having sex with the dog, being ignored by her father while having his own conversation ,was extremely funny which had me laughing in the aisle. Extremely well written as the plot and characters develop, you see where Kimberly steals her ideas from as she uses lines from a porno movie to seduce a female reporter. The movie interacts brilliantly between the scenes. The ending could have been better, i.e. a little less tragic. If you like this movie, try Chumscrubber.

2425263,3,B000BMY2LA,"Pretty by Persuasion is a dark satire that lacks the subtlety of To Die For or the soul  of American Beauty. It tries a little too hard to shock and to make its points with racism and sexism. As a result the irony is too heavy-handed to be clever and the humor is aggressive but not apt. Evan Rachel Wood, delivers a great performance with her schoolgirl uniform and dead doll eyes, and ultimately saves this little flick from being a nihilistic monstrosity.

 Kimberley Joyce is a narcissistic and amoral teenager at  privileged Hollywood High School who wants to become a famous actress. Her rich father is a raunchy, selfish, anti-semitic cokehead, her mother doesn't want her, and her stepmother is not much older than she is.  As a lost child who no one pays attention  to (not even when she makes comments at the dinner table about bestiality- yes it's that kind of movie) it's no wonder she wants to be a star. Kimberley takes  the new student Randa, a nave Muslima migr who wears hijab, under her raunchy, self-centered little wing. Randa first serves as a straight man and foil as well as a stand-in for the audience, as Kimberley explains life to her. They also hang out with Kimberley's best friend, who recently stole her boyfriend, but Kimberley appears to not care as she seeks out anal and oral sex with other boys and with a corrupt lesbian newscaster who is covering a fluff piece on their school.

 The three girls use the presence of the newscaster to bring justice against their pedophile English teacher by accusing him of sexual assault. The plot here seems to hinge on one of them cracking on the stand and admitting it's a ruse, however it appears the allegations are true (perhaps a little exaggerated), so this part of the plot did not make any sense, as he does sexually harass them and does deserve to be fired.

 As the pubescent angel-faced evil genius Kimberley Joyce, Wood delivers the goods, but she's like water in a wasteland. I don't think you are supposed to identify with her, but almost everyone else around her was so unlikeable that I really couldn't blame her for anything she did and was rooting for her. Her orchestrations do result in one terrible tragedy, but the tragedy is more the fault of the conservative Muslim parents and not something Kimberley could have anticipated.

 This movie aspires to, but falls short of, other, similarly themed films. It lacks the noir-like mystery of Wild Things, the distance of To Die For, the morality of Mean Girls, the redemption of American Beauty, or the cutting edge of an Araki film. However if you loved most of the above and/or are a fan of Evan Rachel Wood, Pretty Persuasion might provide you with some second-tier entertainment of this kind.

Her performance in this film is great but the movie is a total disaster. I just couldn't stand how calculated and lifeless this film was, tries to come off as a clever satire but doesn't work on any level. Some of the dialogue and overtly sexual nature seemed forced. I did not laugh once and could not wait for this ""dark comedy"" to be over, avoid this stinker at all costs!",1274572800,6,506,4.3936170212765955
2425266,5,B000BMY2LA,"Evan Rachel Wood (Kimberly Joyce)was masterful in her performance. The film contains comical overdone simulated sex scenes. I enjoyed the attention to detail as Kimberly packs a copy of the book, ""Diary of Anne Frank"" near the end of the story, a book everyone, including myself believed was not to exist. The frequent remarks made to her step-mother in a nonchalant manner about having sex with the dog, being ignored by her father while having his own conversation ,was extremely funny which had me laughing in the aisle. Extremely well written as the plot and characters develop, you see where Kimberly steals her ideas from as she uses lines from a porno movie to seduce a female reporter. The movie interacts brilliantly between the scenes. The ending could have been better, i.e. a little less tragic. If you like this movie, try Chumscrubber.

2425267,5,B000BMY2LA,"Pretty Persuasion is a movie that will create very intense feelings among supporters and detractors. Evan Wood plays Kimberly Joyce, a modern day Iago, but set during the fast times of Beverly Hills.  Possessing charisma, a cute body, and no moral restraints whatsoever, she undertakes a career of cloak and dagger throughout her privileged California high school. Her scheming compares very well to the iconic plotters of yesteryear: the Usual Suspects' Keyser Soze, the Dark Knight's Joker, and Night of the Hunter's Harry Powell.

This is a story both very funny, but very tragic.  Unlike past works of Othello, the focus here is on the villain, and the circumstances which make her into what she becomes.  It's a very sad, but realistic (if exaggerated for comic relief) human portrayal of what went wrong to make a person fly off the tracks of human decency, leaving a train wreck in her wake.  In terms of tone, the movie's first half reminds me of 40 Year Old Virgin, with unrestrained sexual jest after sexual jest.  The second half morphs into a morality play, highlighting a variety of modern issues, ranging from parental neglect to the power sex holds in our culture.  This is the major shortcoming of Pretty Persuasion.  How many people want their comedy to change into a Lifetime movie halfway through?  I had no problem with it, but I imagine many people will.

If you like raunchy jokes, but want to hear a woman talk dirty this time around, try out Pretty Persuasion.  You will laugh (besides Evan Wood's character, James Woods is absolutely hilarious), and maybe, find something here that makes you into a better person to your fellow human beings.

Everyone in it falls victim to false values and selfishness--except for the Arab girl, whose victimization at the hands of her friends and her parents is tragic. This movie presents a portrait of the Upper Middle Class American Family at its worst; Evan Rachael Wood is nothing less than perfect--a sociopathic spawn of the devil.

2425269,3,B000BMY2LA,"A very interesting film...
It starts as a great teen comedy about this rich, beautiful and shallow teen (who dreams of becoming a movie star). She befriends a rich Muslim girl (who knows nothing about anything) and the jokes start immediately as the contrast between them is obvious. The comedy tone is further enhanced by the fact that most other characters are caricatures and stereotypes (like her father who is a racist/tough businessman, her mother who only calls her for a few minutes and boys who only want sex).

The comedy tone goes on for some 25 minutes and all we see is the funny interactions between the girls. Until they decide to accuse their English teacher of sexual harassment.

Then, the film starts to switch its mood entirely and goes into the thriller territory as it goes darker and darker through the manipulating schemes devised by the protagonist - with tragic consequences and an ending like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dangerous-Liaisons/dp/6304696515/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dangerous Liaisons</a>.

This is not necessarily a bad film... the story is well told... but it is obvious that the film does not know exactly what it is (and who its audience is). It is strange because from a certain point on, the comedy loses its laughs and the audience is lost for 20 minutes until the new tone firmly sets in (around 50-60 minutes into the film). Then, even after it's gone darker and darker... some characters obviously still act like a comedy - while the story has already gone for thriller.

I'm sure the distributor felt the difficulty of marketing a film that actually is like two films mixed together. It is obvious to me that they thought it was a safer bet to try to pass it for a plain comedy. The result is that many viewers felt ripped off because they were expecting one thing and got another instead.

If this film would have stayed just on the comedy side OR just on the thriller side, it could have been a killer comedy OR a killer thriller!

It seeks to shock with pornographic and racist dialogue, but all you can feel is dumbfounded that the ""creators"" -- and that's giving them more credit than they're due -- apparently believed that obscenity without any redeeming social value becomes satire if it is extreme enough.

This film had as much intelligence as three-year-olds seeking shock value with potty mouthed rantings. Boring, crude, and insulting to anyone of even minimal intelligence -- in fact, I think the dog in the movie was the only one who came out of this production with any integrity. And that's because it was the only one who had no choice about in being involved in it.

Evan Rachel Wood portrays a character who is at once annoying, sadistic and mesmerizing.  In short, Wood is magnificent.  She plays a young girl named Kimberly who is used to getting her way - no matter what it takes.  She manipulates people of both genders with ease, and is the ultimate hypocrite in being so conniving while at the same time attempting to convince people that she stands for intra-cultural relations.

So, a high schooler tries to ruin a few lives and is probably a psychopath. What's the big deal about that? Characters like her are a dime a dozen in the real world. As social commentary, this film failed because I could care less about people like her. Where the film succeeds is in its portrayal of the Ron Livingston character. Now here's the the real villain of the movie; a man who hides behind his profession to ruin lives. What I found most despicable about him was that he pretended to have his students best interests at heart even while his true motive was to realize his fantasies. His scenes with Randa and Brittany were especially disturbing, almost like rape scenes. People like him are the true villains of the world, because they really believe that they are good. So I don't think the Wood character was all that special because the Livingston character was even more revolting. In real life, people are not that disturbed by an Eichmann character, but they are by a serial cannibal, aren't they?",1172102400,4,1120,4.661616161616162

His performance is akin to a more inappropriate, and with no redeeming features, Alan Arkin in ""Little Miss Sunshine.""  The last best thing about this film is the script.  Intricate, and often offensive the script is a fantastic, though as has been noted by other reviewers, not very original.  The movie steels plot devices from other teen movies, and unfortunately it does it a little too much.  The movie is not great but certainly worth watching.

Totally out of the blue and not funny. Anyway, the movie's about a spoiled rich girl in a Mean Girls type highschool.  Same type of issues as Wild Things, two girls trying to get their teacher falsey accused of sexual assault.  This movie was not very clever or particularly interesting.  The only thing it did to try to separate itself from Wild Things/Mean Girls was the ridiculous amount of racist and dirty talk.  I found it to be pretty boring and most of the laughing I did was uncomfortable , not-sure-how-to-take the jokes laughing.  Aside from the poor writing, Evan Rachel Wood played a great villain.

2425287,2,B000BMY2LA,"Kimberly Joyce, a teen raised in a privileged California community - is a one-woman weapon of mass destruction.  Insatiable and manipulative, she conspires with two of her friends to destroy one of her high-school teachers - a likely pederast played by Ron Livingston.  While the plot plays out in a virtually futile court battle charging Livingston's character with sexual molestation, much of the story display's Kimberly's unsavory attitudes and her talent for maneuvering her friends like chess pieces.  Aspiring to become an actress, Kimberly has no inner self - she lies, maneuvers and curses.  Her father (James Woods) is an out-and-out racist whose angry platitudes are softened and yet made more lethal in Kimberly.  Yet Kimberly is not primarily racist as simply misanthropic; celebrity isn't her top ambition either.  You'll have to wait the entire film to realize what her deepest desire is and how many must suffer before she achieves it.

This was a horrible movie - not even a close call.  Remember ""Wild Things""?  That movie centered on sexual exploitation as well - with the plot driven by conflicting agendas of the conspirators (we were always supposed to wonder about who was really fooling who).  In ""Persuasion"", we know who the puppet master is - all the characters are transparent, even when they're lying.  Played by Evan Rachel Wood, Kimberly looks like a brunette version of one of those kids from ""Village of the Damned"".  Instead of noir mystery, ""Persuasion"" offers up a pre-packaged indictment of America - it's a sort of hall-of-mirrors version of everything wrong with our country, with each of the characters reflecting a given flaw of our national conscious.  There are no sympathetic characters - Livingston's character may be a pederast after all; Kimberly exploits a narcissistic television reporter who seems to have it coming; all of Kimberly's friends are low-wattage versions of her - which is to say that they're amateur manipulators.

While the population of unsavory types wouldn't doom the movie, the problem is that none of these characters is remotely believable.  All of the teens spout the sort of lines that teens only say in rip-offs of ""Dawson's Creek"" (""My God, Brittany, it's like the world is this orchestra and I'm the conductor"") or anything else directed by Kevin Williamson, and exist only to confirm our cynical Hollywood-driven prejudices of American culture - which is that we're ever so much more selfish and boorish than the people who write these movies.  The flick proceeds on a set of incomprehensible and forced plot-twists which pose no surprise other than shocking you with the ends the script will go to suspend your sense of disbelief and then slap you upside the face for buying its characters' dim homilies.  Towards the end, the immigrant father of a schoolmate tragically swept by Kimberly's plot is heard to sob ""We came for the American Dream, and found only a nightmare!""

With the basic plot outline in mind, I approached the film with concerns that it might be too tame or predictable, but I was impressed by how far it was willing to go and how clever it was while refusing to take itself seriously most of the time.

The non-linear flashback structure that starts halfway through seems annoying and unneccessary, and the American Beauty ending is a bit of a drag, but there is a powerful and unique enough voice at work here that five years from now I'll probably consider this a great film.",1146441600,,889,4.810457516339869

I guess you could call this movie an emotionless hunk of s**t, but it's actually well done and the end message is pretty good. Personally I think of this as a teenage version of ""Wild Things"" because it has a very simalar plot and a very simalar end. And, like Wild Things even when you know what's going on you find out you're wrong. The movie stars Evan Rachel Wood (the wonderful actress from ""Thirteen"") ditching her blond hair for a brunette 'do. Wood is Kimberly Joyce, a manipulative 15 year old aspiring actress. Kimberly, along with her friends Brittany and Randa accuse their teacher Mr. Anderson (Ron Livingston from ""Office Space"") of sexual assault and harrasment. The ensuing trial then brings out some interesting details about what's really happening and then there's also the lesbian reporter. And well, I guess there's really no point in my explaining it even further...Hopefully, you're intrigued enough. Selma Blair also appears in the film as Mr. Anderson's sexy wife. Anyway, the only reason I rented this movie was because I like Wood, she's a phenomenal actress which she proves yet again in this film. But, I found that this movie is actually pretty damn good. The acting is good, the script is good, the dialouge is very well written and pretty smart & witty, the movie is very funny and the entire cast work well together. This movie is pretty perfect.

2425291,5,B000BMY2LA,"In one scene in this amazing acid-drenched satire of the familiar ""teenage"" movie, Evan Rachel Wood's teen-aged Iaga, Kimberly Joyce, is seen standing on the courthouse steps in a long shot, apart from the chaos she's created, looking like a human gargoyle. That's pretty much what she is.

Kimberly, a whip-smart super-cynical sociopath in a private school in Beverly Hills (where else?) is out for revenge, and she takes no prisoners. Always perfect in appearance, always arrogant in manner, she cajoles and persuades in every way she can, and she has no qualms about trading sexual favors, either. Why should she? She hates everyone and everything. She lives with her father, a raving bigot in a great turn by the barely recognizable James Woods, and bimbotic stepmother (in one hysterical dinnertable scene she hopes Wood will call her ""Mother""; Wood replies with an obscenity, which seems to be about all she ever says to her), and--as we see in the first scene--she's an aspiring actress. When she's removed from the school play (they're doing ""Anne Frank"" and she's to have been the lead) for making anti-Semitic remarks, she decides to get revenge upon the English teacher who's in charge of putting the play on, and does so with the aid of her best friend Brittany and a middle eastern girl, Randa, who she uses pretty much as a sounding board while she spews out her own ideas of society. (Both have certain issues with the teacher.) They cook up a sexual harassment scenario with the aid of a lesbian TV reporter (Jane Krakowski, from ""Ally McBeel""), which--the girls hope--will end in the teacher's dismissal. Kimberly is certain the case won't come to trial, but . . . well, see for yourself.

Director Marcos Siega gets great performances out of the entire cast, and he gives the film a pastelly look--the school unis, in which we see Kimberly much of the time, are in comforting pink and grey--a jarring contrast with the girl's soullessness.",1140307200,6,1957,4.873873873873874
2425292,5,B000BMY2LA,"If you don't like films with unnecessary graphic language you may want to put ""Pretty Persuasion"" on your ""films to avoid"" list. There is so much exploitive language and perversions (mostly discussed rather than demonstrated) that I was regretting my purchase 20-25 minutes into the story, even though I was laughing fairly often-especially at Kimberly's (Evan Rachel Wood) comments about the relationship between her stepmother and her dog. I was amazed that Wood had agreed to do this thing and felt that in a few years she would regret having it on her resume.

But after about 30 minutes I was either hardened to the dialogue or had begun to understand that most of it was there for a legitimate purpose. And to enjoy ""Pretty Persuasion"" you have to be willing to accept a fair amount of what first seems needless exploitation. It used to be that teenagers went to the movies to see adults making love, now adults go to the movies to see teenagers making love, or at least speaking and behaving suggestively.

This black comedy and parental neglect social statement comes 50 years after Ed Wood featured it in ""The Violent Years"". Instead of a gang of privileged girls robbing gas stations, 15 year old Kimberly and her two classmates, best friend Brittany (Elisabeth Harnois) and shy Muslim girl Randa (Adi Schnall), bring sexual harassment charges against one of their teachers. And ""Pretty Persuasion"" introduces a lot more dark wit into the equation, a function of Skander Halim's screenplay and Marcos Siega's direction.

The most intriguing thing about ""Pretty Persuasion"" is the way it embeds a complementary theme about Hollywood hypocrisy in the very structure of the film. Promiscuous teenage girls and lesbians are established titillation elements in exploitation films. And during viewing you are subtly persuaded that you are watching a fairly graphic exploitation film.  It is only upon later reflection that you realize that you have actually seen nothing, everything was implied by the dialogue or staged partially off-camera. A prudish viewer is not offended so much by the images as by the implications that they have supplied themselves.

As a response to the growing sexual exploitation element in films, beginning in the 1930's Hollywood self-regulated itself through the Hays Code. Its provisions stated that: ""pictures shall not infer that low forms of sex relationships are the accepted and common thing"", ""scenes of passion should not be introduced when not essential to the plot"", and ""seduction or rape should never be more than suggested"". The tone of ""Pretty Persuasion"" is disapproving of the sexual relationships that are taking place, its scenes of passion are essential to the plot, and the seduction takes place off camera; making it at least technically in compliance with the old code.

The story is told from Kimberly's point of view and ""Pretty Persuasion is a good example of the power of POV in fostering identification and sympathy for the character through whom we are witnessing the main events. By the end most viewers are perversely hoping that Kimberly will be successful. Few actors could elicit sympathy for this character but Wood manages to do so, you work to resist her but ultimately you lose.

You are further won over at the end when you realize that Kimberly's cynicism is largely justified, even if her actions are not. Were she able to choose, Kimberly would not elect to so cynical,  it is simply a reflection of a world that is a major disappointment to her. So the character Wood brings to the screen is one that you go  from hating, to sympathizing with, to admiring.

The theme of cynicism, as well as its cause and effect, has never been better dealt with than in this film. Using sex as her commodity and insightful analysis of other's weaknesses as her weapon, the disillusioned Kimberly is pretty much able to manipulate the world to suit her designs.

Wood is becoming the Tuesday Weld of her generation but is treating us to stuff in her mid- teens that Weld did not do until her mid-20's. Think of ""Pretty Poison"" and ""I Walk the Line"". Or even more appropriately Weld''s portrayal of Abigail in ""The Crucible"", because at its core ""Pretty Persuasion"" is a modern version of Arthur Miller's classic;  an intriguing blend of ""The Crucible"", ""To Die For"" and ""Heathers"".

After watching Wood in ""Pretty Persuasion"", you realize that it is not something to be purged from her resume but something she should highlight.

Usually we have sexploitation, sex titillation, etc., but making humans look ridiculous and a bit comical having sex? Thats a bit unusual. (Well, come to think of it, maybe not.)

Anyway, there is also plenty of sexploitation here and the usual hypocrisy about sex is woven in along with a surprising amount of honesty about what people do when they think no ones watchingor better yet WHEN someone is watching.

The script is clever with plenty of over the top raunchy dialog that I cant quote here. (You can go to the lengthy quotes page on IMDb and see for yourself.) But what I really liked about this movie was Evan Rachel Wood who played 15-year-old Kimberly Joyce, the sociopathic little darling. (Wood was 17 at the time.) She was so cute and so, so in love with the part. She delighted herself and me too.

Part of the comedic and bemusing effect throughout is achieved by contrasting one thing with another. For example Kimberly befriends innocent hijab-wearing Muslim girl Randa (Adi Schnall). Why? Because, Kimberly says, when I'm standing next to you I'll look more attractive by comparison. Isn't that great? Randa replies straight-faced, Very nice.

Another example is when the teacher who is accused of sexual harassment by his students (and found innocent, by the way) gives a birthday present to his wife. It is a skirt very similar to the ones worn by his students. He has her put it on and he more or less drools, suggesting that maybe he isn't so innocent.

Finally I must note in passing that James Woods who plays Kimberlys father looked pathetic on the couch in his underwear as he receives titillation from his cell phone. That scene shows me that James Woods is a pure actor who cares not how embarrassed hes going to be when, yes, he actually sees the movie.
