8519531,5,B007MHK8G0,"It covers the same ground as the book, though there is additional information added.
You get to see each exercise performed , at the correct speed and posture in real time. I for one found that alone extremely helpful.

This is a professionally shot and packaged DVD and booklet.

Is it worth the money , well yes , if like me you had some queries about some of the movements , it proves its worth as a supplement to CC1. You may not need the whole collection of CC DVDs, just the ones your stuck on to use as a reference and really study where you might be going wrong . Which is what I plan to do.
With that in mind I have no doubt I'll need to purchase the Bridging DVD when the time comes , so its good to know they're there if needed.",1369008000,4,739,4.020408163265306
