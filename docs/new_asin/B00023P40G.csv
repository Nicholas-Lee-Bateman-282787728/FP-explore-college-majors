8021538,5,B00023P40G,"This  old  ""Play for Today"" gem is a comic masterpiece. Sloman and Steadman as the story's central characters are wonderful - Leigh's directing is spot on and the dialogue ranks up there with the best ive heard in this genre.

Add to this the undertow of barely suppressed intolerance and cultural friction that simmer all through the play and you've got yourself a winner.

I first watched Nuts in May when it was originally broadcast back in 1976 and although I didn't see it again for forty years the story and the characters stayed with me all that time. Some impact!

Now i have a copy oc the DVD I re-watch it on a regular basis. Its one of those that become better with repeat viewing. I also force friends to watch it.

I use the word ""force"" because not withstanding all the praise i have just heaped on it there are many who ""don't get it"". And they never will. So please accept my apology if you rent or buy this on the strength of my recommendation and it leaves you cold. But it's worth taking a chance on because if you do get it you are in for a real treat!",1464652800,,1072,4.25615763546798

8021540,3,B00023P40G,"Can an anal-retentive man and his ever submissive wife find temporary solace from the modern world? For this couple, camping and sightseeing seem like the perfect solutions. Unfortunately, they're quick to forget that fellow campers don't always share the same principles and codes of conduct. Distressing and awkward moments ensue. Failure to communicate causes additional disharmony.

The personalities of lead characters, Keith and Candace-Marie, are exaggerated to the point of caricatures compared with the supporting players. Exaggerated acting often brings out the humor in everyday situations, but this type of overacting results in nothing more than a pair of stiff, implausible characters. I'm a big fan of dry, British comedies like Fawlty Towers and Good Neighbors that both feature exaggerated, uptight characters who have a similar, natural tendency to make mountains out of molehills. The difference is that they're hilarious and completely believable because they don't seem like they're acting. It's unfortunate to say, but Nuts in May plays out more like a sluggish stage production than a movie. It has its share of funny moments, but seems to be a novice effort wanting in direction. If you appreciate dry humor and don't mind a modest tv production, you might want to give this one a try.",1427587200,,1309,5.323671497584541
8021541,5,B00023P40G,"Excellent find, I would definitely recommend this movie for a sweet romantic comedy that is wholesome and family friendly.  Good times.",1394150400,2,135,5.428571428571429
8021542,4,B00023P40G,"""One of Mike Leigh's first films and most forgotten pieces Nuts in May, is an oddly naturalistic drama with dryly comic and ironic touches about a couple who trek across the south of England seeking for peace and sanctuary while on holiday. The film at 80 minutes long was originally broadcast back in the 1970s as a teleplay for the BBC. The film had gained some interest after Mark Kermode referred it to the recent Ben Wheatley film Sightseers in that it deals with personal struggle, hatred, and lack of respect.

Since I have not seen that film nor have any interest in seeing it, the similarities are there but Nuts in May has a more ambient, contemplative tone about its narrative. It was intriguing but tough, without having to resort to graphic violence or strong language, to see how paranoid Keith, the man of the couple, became as a militant who still treated his encounters like schoolchildren and his fiancee not as welcoming as one might expect. The film works well on that aspect because it allows the more intelligent audiences to engage in with the actors and their shifty emotions and the culture, morals, and ethics that collided and conflicted within that period. The liberalism (anti-smoking, pro-environmental, health-conscious) yet stern uptight, conservative manners (don't do this, be quiet during the night) of Keith and sometimes his wife illustrate an environment where they originally worked doing social work back in London, the same does not apply over in the countryside. Character is key here but the cinematography, low-to-no music soundtrack, dialogue, and claimed improvisation of its actors all make you believe that you are in the scene of the action than feeling like a thrilled spectator.

While not necessarily re-watchable, it is interesting to watch from the perspective of a film student or an aficionado of experimental works. I could even relate to many of the events and words chosen for the film as that is sometimes the kind of fears and worries people hold when camping or exploring unknown territory.""",1366156800,,2053,5.0
8021543,5,B00023P40G,"...if you're a fan of British humor you will love this movie. I saw with a friend while I was in the UK and now it's one of our favorites. Some parts are what my friend would call ""cringe worthy"" but that's just makes it so wonderful. So, so funny.",1336262400,2,248,3.98
8021544,4,B00023P40G,"I have seen A LOT of Mike Leigh's films. This remains among my favorites. It is utterly brilliant. It is not ""funny"" per se, you will not laugh out loud. It is witty, clever, morally challenging, and scathing. Scathing toward whom, you ask? Well, toward the people who were much rarer in the Seventies than today, the smarmy know-it-all do-gooders who feel compelled to educate everyone and flaunt their moral superiority. Wow, if you don't see something (or much) of yourself in Keith, you are either Mother Teresa or a fool. When the peace-loving Keith resorts to violence, you have seen the fatal puncture of a self-absorbed foolishness that has been skillfully highlighted throughout.

A reason this movie may be relatively unknown is precisely how close to the bone it cuts. The kind of person skewered here is exactly the kind of person who gets to make lists of important films and pontificate of them, as well as other subjects they have no knowledge of. And they much prefer to criticize and sneer and see Christians, right-wingers, and racist ranters deconstructed. I once sat at a meeting of self-professed skeptics who spent a couple of hours lambasting the intolerance and pushiness of Christians. In all my years I have never spent any time with any Christians who were as condescending and arrogant as those skeptics. As Calvin once said in the greatest four panel cartoon ever, those unselfaware people really get on my nerves!

So, this is satire. That works. And if it doesn't work for you, well, I'm stumped. And I say that as a charter member, with sweet ol' Melanie, of the ""Killer Whites"" brigade and a vegetarian for 36 years.

Unfortunately, this is not a restored or cleaned up print. It looks as if it was transferred directly from the VHS copy I have. And no subtitles. Finger and Honky speak in a garbled, thickly accented British slang that is a challenge. It's not vital--you get the idea, but much of it is unintelligible. I was sure hoping to see exactly what they were saying, and I did not.

But as a film...top of the heap. If you don't squirm right along with Ray during the sing-along, you are a stout fellow indeed!",1325548800,5,2153,4.718085106382978
8021545,5,B00023P40G,"It's definitely not for everyone, but fans of Christopher Guest's ""Waiting for Guffman"" and the Australian classic ""The Castle"" will totally appreciate the painfully real humor of this irony-deficient couple trying to organize their brand of fun. Not only are the performances spot-on, but the camerawork makes it a classic comic masterpiece. I busted out laughing multiple times as the camera lingered over a fellow camper's shoes as she crawls out of her tent, or Candace Marie standing atop a cliff as Keith, below, shouts up facts about limestone that she can't hear. Priceless, true-to-life portrayals of insufferable, humorless control freaks that we've all had the misfortune of being ""entertained"" by, or the greater misfortune of camping with.",1304899200,4,752,5.38135593220339
8021546,1,B00023P40G,"When a movie about setting up a campsite has been out for 35 years and only eight people have commented - well, that should tell you a lot right there. Please, no rationalizations about subtle, campy humor. I knew I was in for trouble when one minute into the film you get prolonged camera shots of a flock of geese flying, a car driving down a road,  close-ups of faces doing nothing, conversations saying nothing and setting up a tent - the boring way, not the funny way. That's it bland acting (no, not acting pretending to be bland - just bland bad); no story; poor camera/directing skills. Another FF movie.",1275350400,,612,4.513513513513513
