8567402,5,B00BEZEA88,"Another Moyers' WOW. Interpreting the content is largely based on one's own hatred potential. The show content and Bill Moyers remains neutral. It's loaded with archival footage of riots, war, attacks, marches, disturbances, and more where hatred is visually evident. Discussion includes several from Holocaust, apartheid, and even a US President.

Hate thrives in every culture, nation, religion, street, and ""We're all capable"" of hating, say experts. ""Healthy hate is an oxymoron."" Moyers looks at the many faces of hate. It's a peek at the psychology of hatred and how it is self-justified. An educational, informative discussion on a very difficult subject. It contains such disgusting scenes, at times, that the viewer will ""hate"" it. Eventually at least one form of hatred will appear all to close to your home. But it ends with a talk with kids on how to non-violently confront hate.

BONUS ""Facing Hate"" is an hour interview with Elie Wiesel (1986 Nobel Peace Prize, author, Auschwitz survivor at age 15- family all died there, sponsor of world conferences on hate.) Some excerpts from this interview are also a part of the feature. His thoughts on the Nazi war camp are poignant. Moyers poses profound questions. It's a deep philosophical discussion of hate.

SDH SUBTITLES optional. Contains violent footage.
This DVD presentation is more relevant in today's world than in 1991 when produced.",1365897600,8,1403,5.199115044247788
