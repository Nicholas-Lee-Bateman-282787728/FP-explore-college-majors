Luckily, I have been to Vegas before so I know what vegas has to offer, but for someone who has never been, this DVD offers no insight to Las Vegas and only shows a glimpse of a few of the hotels on the Las Vegas strip. (I could have put together a better DVD than this one)!",1298332800,2,406,3.9036144578313254
8245406,1,B0012DUCGQ,"the video certainly is not worth a dollar a minute.  shame on me for not noticing the video only ran 10 mins.  there was some good information in it if you wanted a quick overview, but was disappointed that it only covered about 6 casino hotels.",1203724800,4,245,4.304347826086956

Word of note: the Rollercoster on the Stratsphere is nolonger there, but the big shot still is along with two new rides, one is named sanity and the other I don't remember at this moment. Both are not for the faint of heart.",1202515200,2,639,5.645833333333333
