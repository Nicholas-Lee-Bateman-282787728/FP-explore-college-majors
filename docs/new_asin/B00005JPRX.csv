1591758,5,B00005JPRX,"In what will likely be the most talked about role in her career, Angelina Jolie plays Mariane Pearl, journalist and wife of Daniel Pearl in the movie adaptation of Mariane's book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Mighty-Heart-The-Brave-Life-and-Death-of-My-Husband-Danny-Pearl/dp/1416551247/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Mighty Heart: The Brave Life and Death of My Husband, Danny Pearl</a>. Even with history already recorded and the outcome known, you feel the fear and the desperation that Jolie brings to her role as a wife stressed and stretching, but unwilling to break down in the face of disintegrating situations.

Daniel Pearl was a Wall Street Journal reporter and one of the most publicized early casualties of the ""War On Terror."" He was kidnapped and ultimately beheaded by supporters of Khalid Sheik Mohamed, an Islamic terrorist who at the time was in league with al-Qaeda. There are those who go as far as to say that Mohamed wielded the knife himself. I must give kudos to the film for not sensationalizing the video of the execution, which would have been an easy exploitative move. Instead, you see the horrified reactions of the Pakistani Police and the journalists as they first see the tape play, and then Jolie's reaction when she is told of the murder. You won't soon forget these scenes.

The film is also a lightning rod. Director Michael Winterbottom doesn't shirk off the anti-Semitism of Islamic jihad, repeatedly making the point that Pearl was killed as much because he was Jewish as American. The Pakistanis are filmed as wanting it both ways; at one point a government official blames foreign agents for Daniel's kidnapping as an attempt to humiliate Pakistan, while the Pakistani police are desperate to find who kidnapped the American under pressure from the likes of Colin Powell. Mariane's friend and Indian-American journalist Asra Nomani (Archie Panjabi;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bend-It-Like-Beckham/dp/B00005JM2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bend It Like Beckham</a>) is accused of being a spy. One of the ringleaders is brought in then asked why Pearl was targeted, he shrugs and says ""He was an American."" You can almost feel the ""fight them there before we must fight them here"" drum beaters gathering around ""A Mighty Heart,"" particularly when the head of the Pakistani investigation (Irrfan Khan) is (non-graphically) torturing a suspect and a CIA Agent (Will Patton) seems more than willing to get in on the action.

To the filmmakers' credit, they never allow that to happen. When a TV journalist asks Mariane if she has seen the video of the murder, she all but curses him as she snarls ""Have you no decency?"" She also makes the point that in the same period as Daniel's kidnapping and murder, 10 Pakistanis have also been killed by terrorists. You feel her anger and her strength, and realized just what reserve this woman had. She never let her anger destroy her strength, even as the situation goes further and further astray.

Much the same can be said of ""A Mighty Heart."" It would have been so easy to play the melodrama card for all it was worth, to just have Jolie manipulate us with big emotional bombs and cheap ploys. When you feel the heart-sinking crash of the film's final 15 minutes, it is done without 101 strings playing in the background or cheesy proselytizing. Very little is made of Mariane's pregnancy when you stop to think about it, and the moments early in the film when Daniel is suggesting a baby name for the unborn Adam are the most poignant foreshadowing of the reality of the Pearls' loss. The brief flashbacks of Daniel Pearl (Lew Futterman) remind us just how what looks like a future can so quickly become an unforeseen horror, and just how far the misguided will go. Mariane's life after, as a crusader, journalist and mother, are guideposts to what strength can be. Perhaps the greatest beauty of ""A Mighty Heart"" is that some day, Adam Pearl will be able to see this movie and get an understanding about his father's place in history.",1182556800,3,4112,5.225757575757576

You just can not have a white actress play a black woman. It is insulting. I don't care if the woman did sign off on it. She wanted her story to be told. There are very few decent roles for black actress's or biracial actress's. Opportunity was there, casting should have been appropriate.

The movie depicted the subject as not following the instructions that he was given as to contact the individual he wanted to interview.

I agree with the reviewers who felt that the focus of this movie was his wife.  In this case, staring at Jolie was torture in itself.  She is over-rated and that French accent faded in and out.

1591975,5,B00005JPRX,I absolutely can say this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I have watched it a dozen times and it's always fascinating.  The search by authorities from US and Pakistan involves so many characters/terrorists and is so intricate you almost have to watch it several times just to understand the connections.  Even following this in the news and knowing the end you still are on the edge of your seat hoping for a good outcome.  I just love this film so so much.,1396569600,,470,4.367816091954023

You know how it turns out so you have to work through the emotions and sadness which is the main theme.  It is gritty and heart breaking.  Good acting and characters but very hard to watch.  I rated it a three because I like more uplifting movies.  If you don't know the story then you may want to watch it but it is a downer.,1360368000,,416,3.9518072289156625

It is a difficult film because we know how the search for the missing man turns out.  (He is beheaded.)  Nevertheless, it is a story of triumph of spirit.  The search team (with Mariane at the center) is composed of various races and cultures who work together in a demonstration of love, cooperation, and courage - ultimately countering the anti-Semitic terrorists' hate-filled act.",1349222400,2,576,5.095744680851064

Since I didn't know if I would enjoy this, I watched the Special Features section about the making of the movie beforehand.  This gave me a sense of the intimacy the director wanted in the movie, the personal contact actors had with the characters, particularly, Mariane Pearl, and their commitment telling her story well.  It also made me appreciate how incredible a person Mrs. Pearl is.  As a result, when I watched the movie, the intensity of the movie was balanced with a warmth and loyalty by the characters (and actors themselves).  Although the movie originates from a terrible act and experience, Mariane's wisdom and the actors' heartfelt intent makes this a movie about rising above the fray, about compassion and seeing the world at large.

1592061,4,B00005JPRX,"`A Mighty Heart' tells the story of Daniel Pearl who was kidnapped in Pakistan in 2002 and is based on the memoirs of his wife, Mariane. This film starts off by being quiet flat and without tension and whilst the story is interesting, I didn't find myself completely engaged with it. That is until the last twenty minutes which are suffused with real, raw emotion and Jolie manages to show the dam bursting in Mariane with power and intensity. For the duration of the ordeal Mariane managed to keep calm and almost detached from the pain she was suffering as she tried to find her husband and yet at the end she releases it all in a painful rush that can't fail to affect you. There is minimal soundtrack to this film which gives it a pared back feel, but also didn't heighten any scenes of tension or upset. This is interesting to see the politics behind the kidnapping and how various government agencies worked together to try to find Daniel and is especially insightful as it is based on true events. Jolie turns out a good performance, as do the supporting cast and the direction is authentic and gritty (some scenes are shot in locations Daniel actually visited). If you are aware of the back story then this may have more impact and as long as you don't expect a huge Hollywood blockbuster, but a more low key political drama, then you should enjoy this just fine. This is very good, but not truly great.

Hollywood may have come calling, but this came out very true to its somber subject matter. We are never really sure why Daniel Pearl would risk his life just for yet another newspaper article that would be instantly forgotten. That aspect of the waste of his life is never mentioned. Angelina Jolie does a fantastic job as the young widow who says all the right things under extreme pressure. Even the nerdy WSJ editors come out just right.

True, the movie was criticized for not having enough details about Daniel's suffering  in captivity. It's even documented that Daniel's friend Asra Nomani criticized the movie saying :"" Danny himself had been cut from his own story"". However, we need to understand that the intent of movie is to show the heart break of a woman who lost the love of her life in a horrible way. The documentary about Pearl is a must see and this movie is not in any way a substitute for that documentary.  The movie tells a story, from Marian Pearl's point of view, of heroic love and a lovely soul that were so cruelly and horribly destroyed.

Marian Pearl understood that the killers were not about religion, as Daniel's best friend was a Muslim (Asra Nomani). The book, as well as the movie, shows Marian's political/spiritual maturity and understanding of the big and nasty political game.",1257638400,2,1139,4.623762376237623
1592065,4,B00005JPRX,"Angelina Jolie, like her husband, Brad Pitt, are great at picking a wide cast of great and original movie roles to fill their career.  In this film, Ms. Jolie plays Marianne Pearl, the wife of NY Times reporter Daniel Pearl.  Both husband and wife were journalists, and were staying in Pakistan after the 9/11 attacks investigating Islamic fundamentalism.  The movie follows the trials of Marianne as her husband is kidnapped, and eventually killed by Al Queda affiliated terrorists.  The kidnapping happens early in the movie, and most of the film focuses on the investigation of the crime by Pakistani and American authorities, along with flashbacks of the Pearls' marriage.  The movie is filmed in the style of a Michael Mann thriller, along the lines of Collateral or Miami Vice, with a feel of a documentary.  The acting is top-notch, with Jolie being the biggest name in the movie.  The film's setting is authentic, as the poverty, pollution, traffic, noise, dust and utter chaos of South Asia is brought to life as the vivid setting of this crime drama.",1251763200,3,1060,4.921348314606742

Winterbottom takes the material in A Mighty Heart and layers it so that the audience becomes invested in Mariane's passionate love for her husband and ultimately relates to her frantic search to find him. As Pearl, Angelina Jolie delves into every angle of her personality: her intensity, her strength, her immense heart and her fairness which is an extension of her journalism career and her worldly view of things.

A Mighty Heart is a remarkable love story and an intense drama.",1231286400,2,604,4.864077669902913
1592099,3,B00005JPRX,"The story of Wall Street Journal newsman Danny Pearl is know in its outlines, culminating in his kidnapping and brutal murder in 2002. ""A Mighty Heart"" brings the story to life by allowing us to accompany Mariane Pearl, Danny's French-born journalist wife, as she agonizes over her husband's abduction. Angelina Jolie does a creditable, if  one-dimensional, job of portraying Mariane's courage and anguish, as well as the attempts of WSJ editors, FBI and Pakistani authorities to track down Danny's whereabouts before his kidnappers take irrevocable action. The film manages to inject an bit of drama into the story, though (truth be told) knowing the outcome sucked a lot of the air out of the film's suspense factor. There is little drama in the efforts of the searchers. Pakistani special forces are portrayed as genuinely interested in helping Mariane find Danny. And Danny is portrayed (in flashbacks) as appropriately cautious in tracking own leads for a story. Predictably, he and Mariane (expecting their first child) have a perfect and loving relationship. Gone is the smirky, smart aleck that the real Pearl projected, even in his kidnap photos. And what of the killers -- why did they act the way they did? A better film might have, like ""Munich,"" attempted to flesh out their grievances. The film shied away from a good-guy-bad-guy approach, hinting only distractedly at inter-agency dynamics that might have hobbled the hunt. Cinematically, the film was gorgeous, with terrific backlit shots, including those of Jolie in her grief. The film is worthwhile to provide images for a better telling of the details of the hunt for Danny's killers.

Though wonderfully shot, ""A Mighty Heart"" falls a beat or two short of being riveting.",1225065600,2,1742,5.130281690140845

You sort of have to be a ""news"" person or in some way be fascinated with the 9/11 genre to really be entertained by this film.  A Mighty Heart not only focuses on the timeline story of what happened but also includes alot of intoxicating viniettes of the city street life in Pakistan.  It gives you a glimpse inside a world many of us will never get to see.  I think A Mighty Heart is one of Angelina Jolie's best films and most captivating performances.  Her only other notable good films are Gia and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. For the slew of films about the 9/11 and Iraq war genres, A Mighty Heart and United 93 are about the best you will see concerning the issue.",1224547200,3,839,4.422077922077922

Daniel Pearl was, of course, the foreign correspondent for the ""Wall Street Journal"" who was kidnapped and brutally executed by a group of Muslim jihadists whom he had sought out for an interview in early 2002.  His wife, Marianne, also a journalist and pregnant with their child at the time, later went on to publish a chronicle of that event, appropriately entitled ""A Mighty Heart.""

Adapted by John Orloff and starring Angelina Jolie and Dan Futterman in the principal roles, the movie of the same name chronicles the efforts of Marianne and those around her to uncover her husband's whereabouts and to try to rescue him before the terrorists have the chance to make good on their threat to liquidate him, if their demands - for improved conditions for the prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay - are not met.  Directed by Michael Winterbottom, the movie does a solid job recreating the step-by-step process by which those working on the case were able to identify, and even apprehend, some of the captors.  But so intent is the movie on exploring every last detail of the search that the characters themselves tend to fall by the wayside at times.  This includes Marianne who, beautifully as Jolie embodies her, often winds up being shunted off to the side when she should be taking center stage and making us care deeply about her and the plight she is facing.  The format of the story is such that we are given only brief glimpses of Marianne and Daniel together and, in each case, they are invariably shown as deliriously happy and passionately in love, which no doubt they were, but it doesn't allow for much shading or depth in the relationship.

The movie is, of course, heartbreaking in its final scenes, as the story works its way to its foreordained tragic conclusion and Marianne is left to pick up the pieces of her shattered life.  Yet, the extraordinary courage that both Daniel and Marianne display in being willing to put their own lives at risk in confronting the injustices of the world leaves the audience with a feeling of hope for the future.

Thus, despite its weaknesses of characterization and drama, ""A Mighty Heart"" still manages to move us in the end.",1220745600,5,2191,4.757255936675461

1592108,4,B00005JPRX,"'The film's strict avoidance of exploitation and sensationalism only adds to the film's emotional impact. In just a few scenes, Futterman - the acclaimed screenwriter of Capote - digs deeply into Daniel as a journalist and a man. But the film belongs to Jolie. This is by far her best performance, strong and true in every detail from Mariane's accent (her roots are Dutch and Afro-Cuban) to the strength she shows under fire. Her total immersion in the role keeps the film from getting lost in the rush of details."" Peter Travers

Mariane Pearl wrote a book about her experiences while her husband Daniel Pearl was held captive by Jihadists. The book 'The Brave Life and Death of my husband, Danny Pearl' is but a piece of this film. The film is badly named to begin with, doesn't have the catch for an audience. However, the acting and history of Pakistan and the Jihads far out way any negativity.

Angelina Jolie has marked this role as her own and she has perfected it. As has been mentioned numerous times her accent and look became Mariane. But at the same time Angelina Jolie was too much for the movie. It should have been a hit. The other numerous cast were absolutely right for their roles- no gratuitous violence overshadowed the film. We all knew how it was going to end, and the telling of Danny;s murder was held with aplomb. Mariane falls apart and goes to her room to keel. However, this was too much, were we all thinking 'is this overdone', is this just right, has this gone on too long'?

The history of Pakistan and the part it played in the jihad and in Al qaeda is the mainframe of the story. What was it that attracted the Jihad to Danny Pearl, and why did they plan his kidnapping and resultant death? The filming was a highlight-the city of Karachi at its best and worst in the light of day and night is a story in itself.

The birth of Adam, Mariane and Danny's son and their life in France is the conclusion of this tragedy.  A life that was undone and for what purpose?

What is best about ""A Mighty Heart"" is that it doesn't reduce the Daniel Pearl story to a plot, but elevates it to a tragedy. A tragedy that illuminates and grieves for the hatred that runs loose in our world, hatred as a mad dog that attacks everyone. Attacks them for what seems, to the dog, the best of reasons.""

Based on Mariane Pearl's account, director Michael Winterbottom did his best to create a coherent narrative, filling in the holes of Mariane's story as best he could. This horrific story, not unlike Paul Greengrass' ""United 93"", must be told. Evil cannot be dealt with until it is understood, as enigmatic as it may seem. We cannot allow ourselves to become apathetic toward these events, though time often makes us forget. Angelina Jolie is quite fine in a centered and thoroughly understood performance. There were a lot of unusually strong female performances this year, which only can explain her lack of an Oscar nom. Dan Futterman, as Danny Pearl is fine, as is Will Patten, and an especially sympathetic performance from Irfan Khan as the Pakistani colleague trying to find resolve. ""A Mighty Heart"" is disturbing, as it should be, and hard to watch. This small film should be taken seriously, and more films depicting this evil element of world consciousness should not be dismissed or discouraged.",1205625600,,1120,5.026881720430108

First of all , This is a heavy movie, Not for a typical action/comedy fan , It's okay to watch a little bit of everything and thats what i do . I try to appreciate everything in the movies i watch , If the plot falls short I'll praise the music or the director . But with this one , I had to find something else to praise .. And i did , I praise the fact that this movie is so Honest it hits me on a level i can't deny . This is no movie with heart-warming scripts and dialogs, and no mind blowing special effect or impossibly intelligent people coping with life . This is a women that had the courage not to break when others around her did. I'm sure others have noticed the fact that this movie doesn't attack Islam or Arab , But hits the target to express how inhuman ISI is. Also it showed how both sides suffered in the act of terrorism and extremism . Maybe it wasn't exactly politically correct, But i found the acting and the characters interactions so real. It felt exactly like watching a documentary but a  powerful one. I am not surprised that people and critics gave this movie bad reviews, To be honest this movie is clearly not targeted to everyone and anyone, It's for those who have the power and will to understand more  about what happened to Mariane Pearl through the unfortunate events. I'll give this movie 4 stars instead of 5 , Because i believe that no perfect work can be perfect , You see imperfection is the eye of perfection.",1204329600,3,1667,4.20625
1592152,4,B00005JPRX,"I've heard good things about director Michael Winterbottom's films, this was my first and I wasn't let down.
Here he tells the true story of the Wall Street journal reporter Daniel Pearl who was kidnapped on January 23, 2002.  Possibly due to rumors of the Journal's link with the C.I.A, the fact he was Jewish, or because of the treatment of P.O.W.'s at Guantanamo Bay.
The story is told through his wife Marianne Pearl's perspective played by Jolie and the movie is based on her book.  Jolie does her justice rather than the cliche role of the pregnant wife in films, she is strong and touching when she needs to be.
Irfan Khan also is very good as the captain of the Pakistani police, Khan was also in two other great releases in 07, The Darjeeling Unlimited and The Namesake.
The story has a somewhat real time feel of United 93 but not to such a great effect.

One wishes that it was ""just a story"" but knowing that it is a true event which took place in today's world make this story necessary to be read and seen.

This movie is really well acted by the entire cast and very well-written. The movie is nicely paced from start to end.

I enjoyed the fact that we don't see the actual kidnapping, nor does the film show the violent, brutal way in which Daniel Pearl's life came to a tragic ending. Instead, this movie focuses on the efforts to find and rescue, Daniel Pearl, by his wife Mariane, along with the help of many others, before Daniel Pearl is killed by his kidnappers.",1201132800,4,619,4.618181818181818
1592155,4,B00005JPRX,"I personally really liked this movie.  While I normally can't stand Angelina Jolie, she did a brilliant job here, from the way she acted to the way she looked and to the way her accent was done so well.  I thought it was a great idea not to focus on Daniel's kidnapping so much as to the way Mariane and the 'entourage' (police, fellow journalists etc) helped to look for him.  I read that Angelina worked alongside the real Mariane to get her role down to perfection and from what I know of Mariane, she did it very convincingly.  Dan Futterman also did a great job of portraying Daniel Pearl.  He's a great actor and his resemblence to Daniel was also striking.
If there is one tiny complaint about this, it's when they show a particular location of where they are or who a particular person is, and they put up a caption to tell you where they are, - you can't read the caption as it's tiny tiny and I have great eyesight yet can't read them.
Overall, this is a very moving movie.  It was done delicately and in a very good way (while Daniel is still mising they do 'flashbacks' to vacations they took together and their wedding).  I learnt quite a lot more about the case that I think I forgot or never heard before.  I enjoyed this and I do believe that Angelina should at least get an Oscar nomination for such a fantastic job.",1200096000,5,1333,4.304
1592156,2,B00005JPRX,"First let me say that my heart goes out to the widow Mariane Pearl for what she had to go through following the kidnapping and subsequent murder/beheading of her husband, Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. I can't even begin to imagine the true weight of what she went through after learning of his death. And this film tries valiantly to get this message across to viewers and succeeds only in Angelina Jolie's surprisingly great performance as Mariane Pearl, but fails in almost all other aspects.

Following the events of 9/11, Daniel Pearl (played by Dan Futterman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Birdcage/dp/0792833198/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Birdcage</a>) and his French wife Mariane (played by Angelina Jolie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-Shepherd/dp/B000MXPE7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good Shepherd</a>) remain in the Middle East to carry on reporting events as they continued to unfurl. Ultimately this would be Daniel's undoing, finally nosing too far into jihadist territory. His mutilated body would be found later cut into many pieces. But this isn't the story of Daniel, it's about the wife he left behind: the beautiful Mariane. Her aching desire to find her missing husband becomes an obsession, not only for herself but for their unborn child (she's months along in her pregnancy when Daniel disappears).

Helping in the investigation are parts of the U.S. Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan and the Karachi police. Most notable among them is Captain Javed Habib (played by Irfan Khan) who would later be recognized for his incredible detective skills in rooting out those involved in Daniel's death.

Surrounded by friends and Daniel's coworker affiliates, Mariane is forced to come to terms with the dangers her husband is in while also trying to stay healthy during her pregnancy. Eating becomes a chore. Waiting becomes unbearable. Time slips past as does hope. Eventually the worst comes to fruition.

Jolies performance aside (she's been nominated for the Best Actress Award at the Golden Globes this year [2007]), the film is terribly confusing. The story whips from the home base of Mariane's residence sanctuary and out into Karachi's muddled streets with no understanding given to movie watchers. Too many times I was scratching my head wondering, ""Who is this? A good guy or a bad one?"" or ""Who's computer are they confiscating and why?"" or ""Why are people shooting at each other?"" Perhaps that was part of what the film's message was about: how confusing places outside the U.S. truly are. But this translated so poorly that it made me want to shut off the film, Jolie's performance being the only saving grace.

It's too bad, really. This could've been a much more gripping human story with a lot of information about who the murderers were and how they intersected with Daniel's life. Instead we've got a pretty big mess with sloppy storytelling and a bad script.",1199318400,9,3015,5.503239740820734
1592157,4,B00005JPRX,"The harrowing images of Benazir Bhutto's assassination bring to light the pervasive instability of Pakistan's political system, and even though over five years have elapsed since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wall-Street-Journal/dp/B000BDI72E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wall Street Journal</a>&nbsp;reporter Daniel Pearl's kidnapping and murder, director Michael Winterbottom has captured a frenetic, scarifying atmosphere in this 2007 film that feels as current as the latest news on CNN. I cannot imagine the unrelenting nightmare Mariane Pearl, five months pregnant, must have felt for those endless weeks back in early 2002 when her husband was being held hostage by radical Islamic terrorists in Karachi. Winterbottom, along with screenwriter John Orloff, brings visceral life to her stunning&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2003-memoir/dp/0743262379/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2003 memoir</a>&nbsp;by taking a docudrama approach similar to Paul Greengrass' immensely powerful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/United-93/dp/B000GH3CR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">United 93</a>&nbsp;and applying it to her disheartening experience. This lends a halting realism to the film but at a price since it also obscures some of the narrative flow as a result.

The story begins on the day of Daniel Pearl's disappearance when he arranged to meet with a Muslim cleric named Sheikh Gilani for an interview. After a discombobulating ride through the teeming urban jungle of Karachi, it becomes clear it was a set-up for his capture. We see the chaotic unfurling of events and the agonizing realization of a desperate situation through Mariane's eyes. Surrounding her is a coterie of colleagues and friends, as well as the local police, all of whom are looking for clues to his disappearance as Mariane attempts to be the model of preternatural composure. Although we all know how it will end, Winterbottom manages to drive the race against the clock with urgent propulsion, even when he does sacrifice plot clarity at key moments for the sake of pacing. What does become clear is the dawning revelation that journalists have become attractive targets for terrorists and the seeming intractability of regional mistrust, in particular, between Pakistan and India, when it come to the inevitable finger-pointing around the kidnapping. The resulting ambiguity and disarray in the investigation can be frustrating to track, but it does feel true to what went on at the time.

Given the constant barrage of her off-screen notoriety, it's easy to forget how compelling an actress Angelina Jolie can be when challenged to do her best. Probably for the first time since 1999's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Girl-Interrupted/dp/B00003CWQR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Girl, Interrupted</a>, she completely inhabits a character and captures Mariane down to the idiosyncratic, murmuring French-Cuban accent and curly mop of hair. The difference this time is that she does it with understated nuance rather than bravura turns. Only once does she release her inner pain with primal force, and the climactic scene is all the more powerful for the subtlety that precedes it. The superb Irfan Khan (the quietly authoritative father in Mira Nair's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Namesake/dp/B000U2U0E4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Namesake</a>) makes his moments count as the local intelligence officer leading the investigation. Smaller contributions are effectively made by Archie Panjabi as a reporting colleague who becomes into Mariane's confidante, Will Patton as the sympathetic ambassador, and Dan Futterman primarily in flashback as Daniel.

Thanks to the sure hands involved, Mariane's story is a tribute to the power of the human spirit in the face of terrorism. The translation to film could have been easily sensationalized into a clarion call for anti-Islamic hatred, but like her book, it remains remarkably controlled and free of self-pity. The 2007 DVD is short on extras but includes a half-hour making-of featurette, ""A Journey of Passion: The Making of `A Mighty Heart'"", pretty standard in format but enlightening in is display of Winterbottom's seemingly free-form filmmaking approach. Beyond the original theatrical trailer and a few previews, the extras include a brief public-service announcement for the Pearl Foundation with CNN's Christiane Amanpour and a short video of the Committee to Protect Journalists.",1199232000,12,4639,6.325434439178515
1592158,4,B00005JPRX,"While a definite triumph, it is plain to see why Michael Winterbottom's ""A Mighty Heart"" did not make significant inroads at the summer box office. Based on the memoirs of Mariane Pearl concerning the events surrounding the kidnapping and eventual execution of her fellow journalist husband Daniel in Pakistan in the early days of 2002, the subject at hand is certainly a weighty one, which for some may constitute a duty more so than a pleasure. To the contrary, the widescreen vantage point the film affords the viewer is memorable and wholly dignifies the situation, humanizing Mariane as she maintains strength in her darkest hours, working against the clock in her desperate search for answers.

The day starts like any other for the Pearls in their temporary flat in the city of Karachi. Although Mariane, portrayed by the inimitable Angelina Jolie, has her mind set on getting home and giving birth in the coming months to their son Adam, Daniel, portrayed by the multitalented Dan Futterman, has one more journalistic desire to fulfill before they pack their bags.

When the cleric Sheikh Mubarak Ali Gilani, recently suspected of having ties to the notorious shoe bomber Richard Reid, becomes available for an interview, Daniel jumps at the opportunity, sets up a restaurant meeting with Gilani, and soon takes off in a taxi eager to get his story. When he does not return home that evening, however, Mariane becomes deeply worried. Immediately sifting through his emails, Daniel's colleague Asra Nomani, portrayed by Archie Panjabi, spearheads the effort to detect his whereabouts but cannot reach any concrete conclusions.

A hefty team of capable investigators comes to Mariane's assistance, most eminent of which are ""Captain"" and Randall Bennett, portrayed by Irfan Kahn and Will Patton respectively. Racing against time to untangle the seemingly unending web of Al-Qaeda agendas, IP addresses, phone records and deceitful informants, they pay a great compliment to the men they bring to life as they seize suspects and leave no piece of evidence unexamined, all the while reassuring Mariane.

Even though it concerns an event that gleaned international coverage, the film consistently packs in raw suspense and nail-biting immediacy. Jolie sizzles as she never has before as the film's protagonist, handling her role with delicacy and nuance while making the courage and humanity of this remarkable woman bounce off the screen with fire and flavor - few can act and even fewer can do it well, and she is indisputably in the top tier of the latter group. Kahn is also a formidable asset to the film, bestowing it with an anchor that informs some of its most heart-pounding moments with equal doses of duty and heart. Both actors are indisputably worthy of Oscar nods.

The film also succeeds in establishing that a great many Pakistanis, including Kahn's character, were devoted to the rescue effort, rendering any sweeping generalizing of Arabs as terrorists or ill-wishers unconscionable. Furthermore, the resilience with which Mariane faces her harrowing ordeal is a great testament to the fact that, despite the obstacles faced, letting the enemy brake your spirit is never the answer.

""Their point is to terrorize people,"" she says. ""I am not terrorized.""

The only problem with the adaptation is that it comes short of fully characterizing the very man so many across the world prayed for in those dark days in early 2002. Futterman still manages to make the most of limited screen time, bringing to light Pearl's love for his wife, excitement at imminent fatherhood and, most importantly, unwavering passion for his craft, notwithstanding the lightweight characterization John Orloff's otherwise formidable screenplay affords.

""A Mighty Heart"" is a solid effort that informs about the Pearls as it brings to mind the tireless work and abundant risks journalists continue to brave in the Middle East. Decades down the road this will still stand out as one Jolie's finest hours.",1199232000,11,3999,5.170015455950541

The true story of the death of Daniel Pearl is heartbreaking, but not necessarily a prime of example of terrific dramatic material for a movie. In fact, this movie is incredibly dull. It's got a lot of heart at the center and, as I said, the real story is heartbreaking...There's nothing really great about the film version though. Even Angelina Jolie (who's performance has been highly regarded in film reviews) isn't TERRIFIC here. She doesn't quite get under the skin of Mariane Pearl, Daniel's wife...Plus, she's sporting a fake French accent that fades in-and-out through the movie.

1592212,4,B00005JPRX,"""A Mighty Heart"" has brought a terrible story of loss to film.  The director creates a web of suspense and uneasiness that is meant to convey the feelings of being a foreign journalist in Pakistan at that time.  While Marianne never gets Daniel back, her resilience shines through and makes us feel that his memory will live on.

Daniel Pearl appears in the early frames of the film as he attempts to arrange to meet with a controversial figure.  Most of the film's remainder is centered around the frantic attempts by Pakistani Secret Police, the FBI, French Intelligence, and Marianne to track down his captors and negotiate his safe return.

Angelina Jolie plays Marianne, wife of slain journalist Daniel Pearl.  The film is based on her autobiographical book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Mighty-Heart-The-Brave-Life-and-Death-of-My-Husband-Danny-Pearl/dp/1416551247/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Mighty Heart: The Brave Life and Death of My Husband, Danny Pearl</a>.  Jolie's performance is largely good.  She is caught in several technical break-down's in her futile attempts to mimic Marianne's French accent.  Still, it's a good effort that will not take away for most viewers.

Director Michael Winterbottom emphasizes the chaos and uncertainty with minimal lighting and many hand-held shots.  In that sense he makes the film feel like a documentary, which is no small feat.  The original score is made up of tense mood music that prevents the audience from settling in.  It underlines a soundtrack almost exclusively made of Indian music.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Mighty-Heart-Music-From-The-Motion-Picture/dp/B000ROALVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Mighty Heart (Music From The Motion Picture)</a>

Still, the director is almost too adept at his drama and suspense.  Mainstream audiences may feel directionless as the characters get leads and have them continuously end fruitlessly.  Great performances are mixed in with incomplete ones.  The story is told accurately, but with a few more takes it could have been epic.

You do get an appreciation for the difficulty foreign governments have in dealing with each other.  The Pakistani agents assigned to the case are clearly trying their best to help the Pearls.  Yet the government distrusts outsiders and accuses them of setting up the kidnapping to humiliate Pakistan.  Making matters worse, the press uses their pages for rumors and misinformation, at one point accusing Marianne's Indian friend of being a spy for Indian Intelligence.

The Special Features are limited to a Making of segment.  The film is also available in HD DVD.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Mighty-Heart-HD-DVD/dp/B000VDDENQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Mighty Heart [HD DVD</a>]

1592213,3,B00005JPRX,"There's remarkable beauty found within Angelina Jolie's stunning portrayal of pregnant journalist Mariane Pearl.  In a role that could have easily been overplayed and over dramatized Jolie was able to channel raw, subdued emotions that brought her character to life for the audience.  In the way Jolie handled her character's composure; giving us more of a silent breakdown of facial features we could see her distress and her pain while never feeling the brunt of hysterics.  In this way, when the bad news is eventually delivered to our heroine and her physical structure finally crumbles it's all the more heartbreaking and emotionally riveting.  Yes, Angelina Jolie finally has proven that her Oscar win in 1999 was not a fluke but that she is a very deserving actress.  Her dedication to this role, to this performance, is seen in every frame and it's this dedication that elevates her performance for the audience.

Sadly, like Cotillard, Jolie's performance is not met by an equally impressive film.  `A Mighty Heart' is a better film than `La Vie En Rose' but it is not as good a film as Jolie's performance.  The film's editing and direction remind me of last years `United 93' except I think I preferred that film to this one.  There is a lot going on in `A Mighty Heart', some of if hard to follow at times.  The movie comes across a bit chaotic.  This may have been a result of the short running time, something I was shocked to see.  A film of this nature rarely every runs under two-hours.  This may have been purposeful, in an attempt to relay the chaotic conditions of the situation befalling Mariane Pearl.  Either way it is a bit distracting.  This is the type of film where you'd like to take you time and really feel out the emotions of those in question.  You don't really have the opportunity to do so with this film.

Recounting the final days of Daniel Pearl's life through the eyes of his wife as she struggles to find him was a superlative idea.  Mariane's story is one that begs to be heard.  It's powerful, moving, touching and emotionally resonant to the general population.  This is a tragic event most American's are familiar with and is something that we all have no doubt thought about with the terrorist attacks and the current war.

I loathe all the bad press and controversy this film has received, especially on the part of Angelina Jolie.  Her decision to play Mariane Pearl was a very personal one and yet was attacked from all angles and it's a shame because I can't think of a single actress who could have done what Jolie did here.  When you are personally invested in another's story they you convey that to your audience and it is very apparent that this story is of the utmost importance to Jolie.  I'm so happy for the attention her performance is receiving now (good attention) and anxiously await her Oscar nomination.

Aside from Jolie there are a handful of splendid performances within this film as well.  Dan Futterman is not only almost a spitting-image of Daniel Pearl but his heartwarming (albeit short) performance breathes life not only into his own character but also that of Mariane for we get a better understanding of her unfailing devotion to find him.  I also thought that Archie Panjabi did such an amazing job as Asra Nomani.  She was able to juggle her role as friend and support as well as her heartache as accusations and harsh words tore her apart from the inside.  It was a nice surprise to see Will Patton pop up out of no where, I mean seariously, where has this guy been?  I remember loving him a few years back and now I never see him in anything.  Regardless, he played his part well even if he didn't have much too really do.

In the end `A Mighty Heart' packs one heckova punch with Angelina's mighty performance.  It's just a shame the film couldn't have rose up to her greatness.  It's still a film worth seeing, one that will prove to be a talking point for any who do witness it.  It's heartbreaking and powerful despite its weaknesses.  See it if only to witness Angelina's brilliant performance, a performance that is hard to come by these days...intelligent, raw, nuanced and relatable.",1196553600,3,4170,4.648907103825136
1592214,2,B00005JPRX,Read the book. Don't bother with this movie unless you have a couple of hours to kill. This even was a tragedy but I didn't feel that with this movie. This movie misses the mark. .....read the book.,1196553600,5,198,4.2368421052631575
1592215,4,B00005JPRX,"After staring death in the face after the needless loss of her husband, the movie opens with Marianne Pearl's narration.  This sets the stage for the powerful retelling of the valiant attempt to locate Daniel Pearl before it was too late.

A MIGHTY HEART describes both of the Pearls' love for each other and for life itself.  The movie projects a story which demonstrates the resourcefulness, strength and hope that personified Marianne Pearl. Marianne is pregnant at the time of the kidnapping of her husband (January 2002).  When Marianne is finally able to pull herself together for the sake of herself and her newborn son, movie goers breathe a sigh of relief. They are content that renewed hope is generated for Marianne when her and Daniel's son is finally born.

The story, of course, has its very tragic undertones in that a likeable and talented journalist is struck down in his prime.  Daniel as Marianne stated, ""Always told the truth.""  Though not a religious man, if Daniel was asked about his heritage or religious background would never deny that he was Jewish even though at times and in Pakistan that created greater peril in maintaining his personal safety.

Throughout the documentary, Angelina Jolie as Marianne is the powerful core of the movie's essence.  Marianne (Jolie) and Asra Normani (played by Archie Panjabi) create an amazing wall analysis of all of the connections of various people to Daniel in an attempt to uncover the scent of Daniel's trail.

I found this movie to be an interesting examination of the world of the very crowded Karachi, Pakistan and what the ""have nots"" have had to endure.  There is a huge sense of the greater misery in so many of the day to day lives of its inhabitants; and it is impossible not to feel a sense of compassion and empathy for the suffering of so many.

On the other hand, there is no excuse for the ultimate and needless sacrifice suffered by Daniel Pearl.

I was also struck by the quiet and dignified performances of Javid Habib who played a very sensitive, hard working and resolute Pakistani CID Captain.  It was also hard to imagine the increasing peril that the world's journalists face every single day in trying to bring the world's events to our door.  Some of them have sacrificed their lives to bring us their stories.

Though the death of Daniel was senseless and very tragic; the movie does reveal the strength of character of Marianne and a hope for some peace, renewed sense of purpose in her life directed in a large part towards bringing up her son.

I felt that the movie was very tastefully done and handled the details of Daniel's murder with compassion and dignity.  Though it was not a box office smash, I believe this story is a thinking man or woman's film which presents explanations and insight into the violent struggles played out in the Muslim world.

1592216,5,B00005JPRX,"""A Mighty Heart"" is a dramatization of the month of effort to find journalist Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal's South Asia Bureau Chief, after he was kidnapped in Karachi, Pakistan on January 23, 2002. The film is based on the book of the same name in which Daniel's wife Mariane Pearl recounts her experience of the ordeal. This is largely Mariane's point of view, so we see characters as she perceived them. This is an effective approach to understanding these events and their consequences, made possible by the film's roving, intimate camera, but it is clearly a point of view.

Daniel and Mariane Pearl were journalists in Pakistan during and after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. Mariane (Angelina Jolie) was pregnant in January 2002, and, just before the couple planned to leave Pakistan, Daniel (Dan Futterman) arranged a final interview. He thought he was to meet an Islamicist sheik in a Karachi restaurant. Instead he was kidnapped by the National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty. When he did not return home, Mariane and fellow journalist Asra Nomani (Archie Panjabi) alerted the American Embassy and the WSJ, who, working with a dedicated Pakistani CID Captain (Javid Habib), tried desperately to find Daniel.

Director Michael Winterbottom's documentary style underscores the reality of the situation as it unfolds but never impedes the drama of Mariane's restrained fear and the race, at once methodical and chaotic, through the back alleys of Karachi to find Daniel's kidnappers. I normally dislike handheld cameras, but most of ""A Mighty Heart"" takes place in the Pearls' home, where Mariane, Asra, colleagues, American security agent Randall Bennett (Will Patton), and the Captain try to make sense of Daniel's contacts and their labyrinthine connections. This could be dull, but the camera gets us into the middle of it, so we feel their triumphs and setbacks.

Despite the high emotions and gruesome outcome, there is no melodrama. Performances are understated. Angelina Jolie is the powerful center of this film, conveying Mariane's resolve to hold herself together in the face of terror, bureaucracy, and politics. I love the whiteboard on which Mariane and Asra illustrate the connections between all of the parties that may link to Daniel. What starts out as a way to make sense of the situation ultimately reveals a complexity and disorder that is impossible to grasp. Regardless of what one thinks of the Pearls' politics, ""A Mighty Heart"" is a superb examination of the Muslim world's ideological battles and their human consequences.

The DVD (Paramount 2007): The film is in English and Urdu. To see subtitles for the Urdu, you must turn on the English subtitles, which also subtitles the English. If this bothers you, turn subtitles on and off with your remote. You can view the film with or without a PSA intro, which is about the ""Pearl Foundation with Christiane Amanpour"" (2 min). I recommend watching the PSA after the film. ""A Journey of Passion: The Making of A Mighty Heart"" (30 min) interviews cast and director about the primary relationships in the film and Winterbottom's and DP Marcel Zyskind's filming style. ""Committee to Protect Journalists"" (8 min) talks about the organization that was formed 25 years ago and the increasing peril to journalists today. Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, Spanish. Dubbing available in French, Spanish.",1196121600,7,3434,5.159784560143627
1592217,1,B00005JPRX,"Well, we knew the story and how it ended before we hit ""play"" on the DVD. In my mind I was hoping to gain a better understanding of why he was taken and what was done to find him. This story offers neither. Quite simply its a mess beginning to end. Cconfusing in that you can't understand half of what's said by the Pakistani characters, either because of the their strong accent, or the fact that many of the investigation scenes are non-english with no sub-titles. As another reviewer noted, many scenes do nothing to enhance the story or your understanding of it. Case in point, just after his abduction, the house was full of Pakistanis. An female brusier of an FBI agent comes in and orders everyone out of the house. We're to assume, (I guess) that the calvary has arrived and now we're going to find Mr. Pearle. Well - that was the last we saw of the FBI, and their agent - I still don't know why the scene was included in the movie.

Add to that the complicated names and relationships they draw out on their white board with arrows going everywhere and never any attempt to explain it to us - well, the movie just wears you down.

At the end, they did a epilogue of sorts, explaining what happened to the individuals in the story. Honestly, many of the people they discussed had such little exposure, and you really weren't sure what their involvement was in the case, that you really didn't care. I found it interesting that one person whas sentenced to life for being the actual murderer but I can't say I saw him in during the movie.

Other than this being a vehicle for Jolie to show case her amazing beauty, it was a complete mess as far as I am concerned.",1195862400,11,1670,4.363344051446945
1592218,4,B00005JPRX,"Despite knowing the ultimate outcome in the search for Daniel Pearl, this film manages to create an extraordinary sense of suspense.  The intellect and determination of Ms. Pearl is well developed.  In fact, I found her overall personality well developed - both intelligent and strong, as well as, vulnerable and flawed.  It was not the ""perfect hero"" syndrome so many films have towards their ""real life subject.""  She is portrayed as a person who is not necessarily ""like-able"", but absolutely admirable.

The story is captivating, and lends moments of quiet humor with the Wall Street journal editor and staffer focused on Pearl's pregnancy (name lists, concerns about getting her to eat...), it added a sense of humanity to the world of newspaper editors usually portrayed as cut-throat individuals who care about the story and not the individuals invovled.

This is a beautiful film, the locations and scenes are phenomenal.  Angelina Jolie (despite moments of missing accent) is an a phenomenal character actress, and I was/am infatuated with her portrayal of Ms. Pearl.  This is a deep, intelligent, fascinating film.

I read online somewhere Jolie was disappointed in the evident box office failure of this film, she said (I am paraphrasing) ""This is a story that needs to be told and heard"" - I could not agree with her more.  This is a story that NEEDS to be told and heard.  It gives insight to not only the culture of Al Qaeda, but also the interpretations of international actions and behavior.  It also clarified information about how they saw a link between the Wall Street Journal and the CIA.  I am very glad I own this film, and I plan to watch this movie again.",1195776000,2,1680,4.873239436619718
1592219,3,B00005JPRX,"Marianne Pearl's ""A Mighty Heart"" is the best book I've ever read, a truly poignant account of Marianne's exhaustingly bittersweet yet hopeful experience which resulted in a terrible tragedy.  The bravado of her forgiving nature is the pinnacle of her strength in overcoming this horrendous ordeal.  I cried reading this book.  This deserves a Pulitzer.

Having said that, the movie was nothing like the book.  I understand books and films are completely separate story-telling media, but this didn't impress me. It conveyed none of the sense exhibited in the book.  In the book, the search for Danny seemed long, unnerving, exhausting and frustrating with disappointing lead after lead; yet everyone remained determined, persevering.  The movie does the exact opposite.  It makes the experience feel rushed and exasperating as if the clock was running out which was not the case at all.  The truth was Danny Pearl was killed within three weeks of his disappearance while Marianne and her team ended up searching for five weeks, realizing later they were being led on a wild goose chase.  It was this futility coupled with the confirmation of Danny's death that made Marianne scream in agony.  In the movie it was rush, rush, rush, rush, oh no he's dead, scream, it's over.

The movie should have run over 2 hours. They had the time.  There was no point in cramming all those elements into 1 hour and 42 minutes.  While the character of the maid and her little daughter was mentioned in the book, they really weren't that significant to the story.  The movie could have used those extra ten minutes for more essential elements.  Also, flashbacks were haphazardly sandwiched any which way in the scenes so it was hard to tell if you were viewing the past or present.

No, folks.  If you're interested in the Marianne Pearl's story, you're much better off reading the book.  You won't be disappointed there.",1195689600,8,1905,4.915360501567398

[...] It reads on the cover: ""based on a true story"" and that's what this is, not another Arnold flick.
The film tries to show us the days between Daniel's kidnapping and his end. The hunt for the terrorists and the strength and courage of those involved.
None of us can even begin to imagine what Marianne went through. But this film helps to understand the psychological brutality of such a situation.
[...] I sat on the edge of my seat for two hours. Not because I wanted to know what would happen - I knew - but because of the great acting and the message: no matter what race, color, religion, there are good people everywhere and despite everything that is put into our way, we need to keep on working at  trying to understand and respect each other and to keep open the dialogue, so that maybe one day those who choose the violent path can be stopped in time or even persuaded to begin a dialogue. That's what good journalism is about.
A bunch of people from different nations with different world views and different beliefs tried to work together to save Daniel. Although they got close, they did not succeed. But they tried as hard as they could and showed that if we try we can change things, sometimes, sadly, just in the details.
Terrific acting by Angelina Jolie and very good directing by Mr. Winterbottom.

Although heavily edited, to the point where many of it's rich performances are sacrificed for the film's kinetic pace -- the effect seems to accurately recreate the urgency of Pearl's kidnapping without turning it into an episode of 24. Moreover, it was also refreshing to see the efforts of the Pakistani police force portrayed as being stuck in the middle of an endless political divide -- much like the Pearls and the countless number of bystanders tragically affected by terrorism.

Timid: because the only thing Daniel's death could serve at this point is to show how BRUTAL and MINDLESS his killers are and were: This the movie fails to do in the name of ""decency."" His killing was not an exercise in ""decency,"" and leaving it out robs the deceased of an opportunity to show the world the cruelty that took his life. Yes, Jolie is beautiful; to the point where her beauty becomes the only thing of interest on the screen. As a Jew myself, I found the short-shrift given the anti-semitism which so fills the Arab world an additional piece of twisted ""decency.""

Helping to man the phones and track down the kidnappers are FBI man Bennett (Patton) and the tough Pakistani police captain (Khan), under pressure from his superiors to solve the case fast and halt Pakistan's embarrassment. A Mighty Heart moves with such a frenetic pace you'd be forgiven for feeling rushed after the credits roll.
The film is unrelenting as it moves from scene to scene. Although Winterbottom alludes to the war on terror and gives the 'terrorists' a voice and a reason for their actions, A Mighty Heart is, at its heart, an emotional, not a political drama; the front and centre Jolie understands this, and gives Winterbottom what he wants. It's not all about Jolie, however, as her co-actors match her in every scene: seasoned character actors like Patton and Khan turn in terrific performances.",1190419200,8,1019,5.035502958579881

They didn't know where he was being kidnapped so they couldn't even rescue him.  Most of the info that they got about Pearl was from the captors themselves.  They were the ones who sent photos of Pearl, etc.  Throughout the movie, all we get is: ""Did you see a foreigner in front of the Village Restaurant?""  Boring.  There needed to be more drama and tension.  I don't consider winding up in ""dead ends"" to be drama and tension.  That may have been the way this story was, but then why make a movie out of it if it's going to be this boring.

1592228,4,B00005JPRX,"""A Mighty Heart"" is a powerful film.  It is not an easy one to watch.  The moral of the film that resonated for me compels respect.  Because the story is based on the real-life murder of journalist Daniel Pearl that captured international news headlines, most audience members will know the outcome.  But through the eyes of Mariane Pearl, the film emphasizes how goodness can come even as a result of evil acts.  Mariane's refusal to be terrorized stands as a stark refutation of the assassin's aims.

Director Michael Winterbottom uses almost a cinema verite approach that reminded me a lot of the work of John Cassavetes.  The film reminds me of Cassavetes' Oscar-nominated direction of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Woman-Under-the-Influence/dp/6304864159/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Woman Under the Influence</a>&nbsp;(1974) and ""Husbands"" (1970).  It's edgy.  It seems like the cinematic pieces are about to fly apart, but instead we realize that they have been flying together.

Since Brad Pitt serves as producer for the film, it might not be surprising that Angelina Jolie is cast as the lead.  I found her performance moving and profound.  Admittedly, I have not read Mariane Pearl's memoir; so I can't play the Match Game to comment on a comparison between book & film.  But given on its own terms, Jolie unwinds Mariane Pearl level upon level, even surprising us into the last frames of the picture after the climax has occurred.  Whether her accent is supposed to be French or a combination of influences could be part of the lightning round in the Match Game, but what she does works well in the film.  The breakdown sequence where the tragic news is processed by Jolie's character is shot in a manner as raw & gritty as John Cassavetes' work.  I think it will be hard for Hollywood to overlook the performance when the year's Oscars are announced.

Dan Futterman who had the recurring role of Vincent Gray on TV's ""Judging Amy"" from 1999-2005 plays Daniel Pearl.  His brief screen time gives a glimpse at a strong and loving marriage relationship.  Archie Panjabi who was in ""The Constant Gardener"" in 2005 plays Asra Q. Nomani.  She gives strong support.  The actor who plays the head of the Pakistani intelligence bureau also gives a strong performance.
