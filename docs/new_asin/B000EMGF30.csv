2523153,5,B000EMGF30,"27 years for US fans, as it was released a year ago in a UK/Region 2 set, and now finally gets a Region 1 release.  As a Dr. Who fan, I would always read and hear about this very obscure Scottish show dealing with the paranormal and starring Louise Jameson (Leela in Doctor Who) and involving several others behind the scenes who also worked on Who over it's long run (George Gallaccio, Anthony Read, Peter Grimwade, Anthony Read, Paddy Russell, Norman Stewart, Kenny McBain).

Unlike the 26 straight years that Doctor Who ran, The Omega Factor only ran one season.  Due to budget constraints of this sci-fi show, the normal run of 13 episodes had to be chopped down to only 10, futher adding to the cult status of this very short lived program.  The other factor that adds to the mystique of the show was that it had never been re-run, and never released on video until now.  I attempted to track down bootleg copies of the show, but the mystery was still upheld when I would try to play the dreadful quality, multi generation copy in my VCR and found that it was virtually unwatchable.  The only way bootleg tapes were floating around was that someone in 1979 must have had a VCR and taped it, and so started the poor generation copies that floated around through the years.

Even this DVD release shows signs of poor quality orginals, especially evidence in episode 1, with lots of artifacts, grain, and all sorts of weird interference showing up on screen.  After episode 1, the clarity is better and remains a decent quality throughout the other episodes.  You get an informative booklet accompanying the set, and the extras include commentary by the writer, director, and producer on the show's most controversial episode, Powers of Darkness, and a 24 minute documentary with the same 3 as the commentary and one cast member.  That cast member is the series' writers' daughter, Natasha Gerson, who played the minor, but effective character, Morag.  Sadly, lead actor James Hazeldine passed away in 2002, and it appears they could not get Louise Jameson for any extras on here.  Both the commentary and the bonus documentary are interesting and worth a listen/look.

The show starts off with journalist Tom Crane (Hazeldine), who apparently has paranormal tendencies including psychokineses and psychic ability.  He meets the mysterious Dr. Drexel and soon has a terrible accident involving his wife.  After this tragedy, he is recruited by Andrew Scott-Erskine, head of Department 7, a government agency involved in utilizing and researching the paranormal.  He reluctantly joins, after finding a friend of his, Anne Reynolds (Jameson) is also a member, and is now working under the head of the Glasgow branch, Dr. Roy Martindale (John Carlisle).

Department 7 is very intersted in the enhanced mental powers of the mysterious Dr. Drexel.  Over the first 4 episodes and against orders, Tom also attempts to seek out Drexel and his odd, young, female comanion Morag, believing they are responsible for his wife's accident.  That plot ends, in a way, after the 4th episode, but Tom does not find out what he is looking for, and continues his belief through the rest of the series, that there is a secret organization working around Department 7.

Tom's brother also has psychic abilities and is quickly gobbled up by Dr. Martindale for experimenting.  We learn later on that his part in all this is bigger than we first believed.  Many secrets are unveiled in the show's final 2 episodes, but there is still a slight hint of what we are seeing not being entirely the finale.  A 2nd season could definitley have proved intersting.

The special effects are very low budget (e.g. people glowing blue and white) but effective enough as we are dealing with mind experiments and powers that need not be expressed in elaborate explosions and 3-D holograms.  The fact that it was shot on videotape (standard in the UK for tv shows in the 70's), and the outdoor scenes filmed in Edinburgh, add to the eerie look and feel of the show. I highly recommend watching this at night, to get a complete creepy, audio and visual effect.  It isn't very scary, it's just rather unearthly and bizarre.  I am not a firm believer in the paranormal, and usually prefer my sci-fi to be spaceship based shows, but I found this very enjoyable.  I think the strong performance of James Hazeldine and Louise Jameson helped out a lot.  The show is slow moving, and generally dialogue based, and these two make the time roll by with ease.

This was Louise Jameson's next role after playing Tom Baker's leather clad, savage companion Leela from 1977-78.  While I am a big Who fan, and loved her character in that show, I must say I found her much more entertaining as a modern (well, then modern) women in normal street attire and persona.  Even though she did not have skimpy costumes on, I felt she looked classy and even more attractive than she did in Who.  James Hazeldine gives a very wam, and likable performance as Tom Crane, and he would go on to to star in the Chocky series of movies on UK TV.  Despite his 70's buhsy hair and Jameson's large, Elton John like sunglasses, the 70's look does not detract from their on screen chemistry and the watchability of this show.

Out of the 10 episodes, I felt two were rather weak, the first being Child's Play, which seem very contrived in that Anne asks Tom to spend a weekend with her at her friend's house, and they find that her friend's son has been having strange dreams and visions.  The other was episode Out of Body, Out of Mind, dealing with a Tom's brother recovering from Department 7's experiments.  This one was just boring and a very slow moving lead in to the show's final episodes and plot revelations.

Overall, this is well worth watching to the sci-fi fan, 70's British TV fan, Doctor Who fan, and paranormal fan.  It features strong performances, very intersting plots and phenomenon, and very ghostly and formidable Scottish location as it's setting.  It's a shame that UK broadcast campaigner, Mary Whitehouse, leading a charge against the witchcraft and mind controlling going on in the show, especially after watching the Powers of Darkness episode involving summoning a burned at the stake witch on a ouija board, played a part in the show not getting a 2nd season.

The show has come back, in a way, in the guise of Sea of Souls, a recent BBC Scotland effort, invloving a University research team conducting experiments and research into the paranormal.  It is nearly the same premise, it just leaves out the government playing a role, and it comes from the viewpoint of them as solely researchers.  It's aired for 3 seasons, and I am not sure if it's going on for a 4th, but it's worth a look if you like The Omega Factor and can play multi region discs.

On a final note, as the crew recollects strange occurrences on the set during filming, I seemed to have some odd things happen while watching this.  It's probably all in my mind, but I seemed to have difficutly locating the discs and or box case, after watching an episode, as I would swear I set it down in one location, then it would be somewhere totally different when I searched for it.  Also, when watching a few episodes, it may just be my DVD player, but I swear I would see some sort of glitch or millisecond of a scene that was different from what I was watching, then I would hit reverse and play it again, and the glitch would be gone!  A very strange and mysterious side effect I have here from watching this show!",1150416000,26,7535,4.682094081942337

8111267,5,B000EMGF30,"For a short series produced outside the typical BBC area (Scotland) this series is different on so many levels. Unlike many other British SF titles this is NOT aimed at children, and the murky waters it navigates has more secrets than the X-Files . The stars are fresh, the stories are nothing like anything you've seen before, and the characters are real with prickly emotions and conflicting urges. While it will appear dated because the few effects it offers are anything but special, the experience is a great one. Unless, of course, you  are one of those viewers who is looking for a show that is 'more like a fairy tale or nursery rhyme, told the same way, with the same result, over and over.' (That's an inside joke - that's the charge Roy Martindale levels at Tom and Ann when they reject the experimental music he offers).",1384041600,,832,4.621621621621622
8111268,4,B000EMGF30,"I remember watching episodes of the short-lived series, The Omega Factor as a kid. It had an interesting premise: A secret British department titled Department 7, set up to head investigations into psychic phenomena and other bizarre occurrences. The department comprises head of department, psychiatrist Dr. Roy Martindale (John Carlisle), physicist Dr. Anne Reynolds (Louise Jameson) and a journalist with psychic powers, Tom Crane (James Hazeldine) who is bent on exacting vengeance upon nemesis Edward Drexel (Cyril Luckham) who Crane blames for his wife's death. As each episode unfolds, the main story line merges with the subplots centering on the investigation of a particular phenomenon.

The ten episodes are:

Visitations
Night Games

Powers of Darkness
Child's Play
St. Anthony's Fire

It is good to know this cult though short-lived British show is available on both Region 1 and Region 2 DVDs and can also be streamed via sites such as youtube and more.",1369180800,,1051,5.287425149700598
8111269,5,B000EMGF30,This is one of my favorite mystery/science fiction series. It is slightly dated and does not have much hi-tech special effects but the acting is great and the story is also. Too bad this lasted only one season.,1282867200,,210,4.552631578947368
8111270,5,B000EMGF30,"This is a little seen show, but don't let that obscurity keep you from checking this DVD out.  It contains all ten episodes of the series, but also contains a documentary on the show, called ""Inside the Omega Factor"".  There's also a cool 16 page booklet, that is more than the typical 'bare bones episode list' that studios typically include.  It's basically an essay by Marcus Hearn that chronicles the tumultuous history of the show, helpful for both longtime fans and 'newbies'.  Recommended if you like shows like The X-Files.",1233273600,,531,4.866666666666666
8111271,5,B000EMGF30,"I never saw this before until I purchased the dvd recently. Very interesting, even more so for seeing the combination of Louise Jameson AKA Leela from Doctor Who, teamed up with what to me is a Tom Baker lookalike,  and the fact that his name in this series is _Tom_, seemed kind of funny. Rather like watching an alternative version of Dr Who and Leela, ok, it was maybe mainly the character Tom Crane's hair that made me think of Tom Baker, but I can't believe I'm the only one to have noticed a similarity, and maybe it's just me, but I think the similarity is more than just his hair, his face too bore a look of Tom Baker to a certain degree. Anyhow, that bit of trivia out of the way, I really enjoyed the series for the story too, very thought provoking with it's tales of mind control and secret organisations and not knowing who to trust. A shame they never made another series. Apparently another one looked likely, but the rumour is that Mary Whitehouse and her listener's association complained, (she did the same with Doctor Who, ""The Deadly Assassin"" story mainly, maybe she had an aversion to curly haired men! Or Tom Baker and any lookalike! LOL) and the series had loose ends that would maybe have been dealt with in a second series. How Mary Whitehouse came to have so much sway over what got shown on tv, is anyone's guess, but Doctor Who had to be 'toned down' on her say so, cuz the makers got fed up with her complaining about it. Nice to see these much loved series getting dvd releases now, this one, along with the Saphire and Steel series, and the complete set of ""Timeslip"", and now the Armchair Thrillers being put out on dvd too, have been well worth waiting for and praise be to whoever is responsible for them seeing the light of day now.",1210896000,,1769,4.3932926829268295
8111272,4,B000EMGF30,"Sadly, some of the acting and the budgeting constraints limit the show. It never really reached what I would call its true potential. To be fair, within the constraints, the show was magnificent. A superb demonstration of how ideas transcend scriptwriting, which in turn transcends production. Production is important, yes, but a well-produced show with no ideas behind it will never amount to more than a one-hit wonder, but ideas with limited production will be memorable and hang with the audience long after the show has finished. The Omega Factor is a show with ideas. Paranormal themes were not unknown to televsion at the time - Sapphire and Steel, The Tomorrow People, Ace of Wands - and many of these shows used radical twists to the concept, but The Omega Factor is without doubt the darkest and most gothic of all such series. It has been compared to The X-Files, but really should be compared to Edge of Darkness, a nuclear horror story the BBC produced. I would be wary of a television remake today - too much emphasis on special effects and too little on quality scripts - but a radio/audio drama might work.",1209859200,,1122,4.758974358974359
8111273,4,B000EMGF30,"this is a really good occult/weird phenomena series.  wish there was more.  i'd suggest re-creating it for a 2008 audience, but i have a feeling that network execs, writers, directors, actors, and especially the viewing public themselves would probably just ruin it.

not every episode is great, but on the whole the series gives us a powerful presence of something beyond us.  the late 70's UK era gives it a ""vintage"" look.  if you don't mind that, then you can't go wrong with The Omega Factor.

8111274,3,B000EMGF30,"I ordered this DVD-set because I enjoy UK television SF form the Seventies. I just watched the last of the 10 episodes. I must say that the series was reasonably good and enjoyable. However, given the standards set by a series like Blake's 7 that started in the same year as the Omega Factor it was not as good as I expected it to be.

Outline
Tom Crane, a journalist who appears to have supernatural powers is recruited by a secret governmental organisation who researchers into the unexplained. He works closely with Ann Reynolds and Dr Roy Martindale in an office where both Reynolds and Martindale offer the pretence of working by (respectively) wearing a white overdress and moving papers from one end of his desk to another. Tom Crane gets to do all the hard work by venturing into the Occult.

Setting
The setting is excellent. What better base to explore the supernatural from than the eerie streets and ally's of Edinburgh?

Acting
The main actors do a good job. Ann, Tom Crane and Roy Martindale all play convincing roles. The supporting cast ranges from OK performances (the guy who plays bad guy Drexel) down to a Faulty Towers level (the heavies of the secret organisation).

Storyline
Most Television SF from the Seventies rely primarily on the storyline. However, the major flaws that made me give this series ""only"" three stars are in the flawed storytelling. The main character's wife is killed and the main character shows no emotion at all and subsequently starts courting every woman he comes into contact with. His brother is turned into a human vegetable (he makes a miraculous recovery later on in the series) by experiments clearly conducted by the department he now works for. However, the main character just continues working for them. At the end of each episode something dramatic happens and in the next episode everyone goes on as if nothing has happened. So, the continuity between the episodes is very bad and the episodes themselves (a phenomenon like hypnosis, out of body experience, etc is researched in each episode) don't cut it as semi-documentary's by themselves.

Extras.
Disc 3 has no subtitling. There's a director's commentary on one episode, a picture gallery and a short documentary in which the directors, writers, etc are interviewed. There's a short booklet in the DVD-set that tells the history of the series.

Conclusion
The quality of the Omega Factor has the shape of a U. It starts out good and promising, gets rather weak halfway and ends with a couple of good episodes. The good ones beat most **** that plaques our TV screens nowadays.",1186012800,,2592,4.852941176470588
8111275,5,B000EMGF30,"I first saw The Omega Factor on my local PBS station years ago. I missed the first episode, but watched the other nine and I was disappointed that it was never rerun or released on video. I finally bought it on DVD and thoroughly enjoyed seeing the whole series for the first time. I especially liked the twists in the last two stories when Martindale was revealed to be a member of the Omega group, but was willing to defy them when it came to Tom Crane.

 Unfortunately, the BBC came up against that self-appointed protector of the morals of the British public Mary Whitehouse and they caved in to her demands (they had done it before when they altered the ending of the third episode of the Doctor Who story ""The Deadly Assassin"") so a second season of Omega Factor was never made, which is a shame because there were many questions left unanswered. I wish the BBC would remake the series from the beginning and bring it to a conclusion.",1165190400,7,940,4.459302325581396
