8727392,2,B013F0QLXG,"FURIOUS 7 is outstanding. It is emotionally charged from start to finish. It went far beyond my expectations. Paul Walker was an amazing actor and had a certain screen presence we will miss. This is an out-and-out amazing film in some respects. The entire cast was perfect. FURIOUS 7 blew me away at times and disappointed at others. Somehow the entire cast and crew went far beyond anyone could imagine in what seems like a tribute to Paul Walker. I loved parts of it and felt let down in some of the scenes that looked a bit contrived. The film making in FURIOUS 7 is some of the best I have ever seen for this series, but once again it some very weak moments.

They pushed the envelope and went far beyond and perhaps too far at times. The action, the story, the characters and a lot of emotion make this one of the best films of this series, yet something seemed lacking.  Paul will be missed. In the final analysis he seemed like an appendage to this film, simply just a footnote and that was sad. Brian Tyler composed a score that is full of drive, energy and emotion. It is one of his best. The finale is a must see. It is just unbelievable and perhaps that is the underlying problem with FURIOUS 7.",1490832000,,1206,4.331858407079646
