8339304,5,B001S0BMOO,"Crossings, directed by Scott Meyer is quite an impressive film on a lot of levels.  It is remarkable what the director accomplished.

I watched it both with and without the commentary.  The commentary added rich detail and back story that really made the film quite interesting to watch.  If you see the film -- and I highly recommend you do -- I suggest you watch it both ways -- first without, and then with commentary.

A few special things that I liked about the film:  First, it was shot on 16mm film, which has it's own inherent advantages and challenges.  In our digital age, it's pretty cool that this was shot the old fashioned way.  Second, there are some breathtaking shots of the New York City skyline taken from Howard Beach in Queens, the film's location and the director's home town -- back when the Twin Towers were still standing.  This brings up nostalgia for the New Yorker in me.  Third, there are some great elements that pay homage to the 90's, the most noteworthy is Kristin Richardson, the real life girlfriend of one of the Backstreet Boys, who were in their heyday at the time this was shot.  Kristin is as good an actress as she is beautiful, and there are some wonderful shots of her against the backdrop of the glistening waters of the Hudson River behind her.

The cinematography was phenomenal. Shot by Zoran Drakulic, who has a background shooting professional commercials and happened to be one of the 25 videographers for the Croatian war, and as Scott says in his commentary, one of the five who came back alive!  There is a mastery and beauty in each of his shots.  One piece of trivia that I thought was cool in Scott's commentary was that the guy who falls off his bicycle was originally supposed to fall off the bridge and into the water.  They guy was willing to do it, but Zoran said that with the dangers involved (poles sticking up out of the water) he wouldn't come to set if the director went with this choice.  It's details in the commentary like this that make the experience of watching the film rich.

The film was action packed, the pacing is quick and never drags. There are some fabulous chase scenes full of suspense -- a guy on a motorcycle chasing down the protagonist who runs from him, a car chase, and some action-packed fight scenes.  The chase scenes look like they were quite challenging to shoot, and in the commentary, Scott says they used a 40 foot dolly -- so the director did some pretty sophisticated shooting.

The film's suspense lies in the fact that we think, or at least hope, that the good guys will get away, but we don't know exactly how they'll pull it off.  And with each attempt they make to escape Neal, the antagonist, they are thwarted at every turn.

The characters are engaging.  There's Neal -- the leader of the pack who is as dislikable as ever -- but still fascinating to watch, as one can barely fathom how he can be so obnoxious and still look at himself in the mirror.  There's the protagonists who are easy to root for, and the antagonists -- Neal and his two side kicks Ganzo and Rob -- who are entertaining.  Rob and Ganzos are cronies with thick Queens accents -- goofy and idiotic, yet still with charm.  There are also some dramatic interactions between the characters, who play off each other well.  There's this great moment where Neal throws his cigarette right at Sharon -- and he really threw that cigarette at her.  Sharon's reaction of disgust and disbelief is raw and real.

As mentioned earlier, Scott's commentary takes the film to a whole new level, as we as the audience learn all kinds of behind the scenes information from a filmmaker's perspective that we otherwise wouldn't know.  For example, the director shares that the film was shot in sunlight with no added lighting as the 16mm film picks up light quite easily.  We also learn that certain shots were filmed to give us the illusion of a certain event taking place that didn't actually happened -- for example, the keys that appear to fall off the bridge onto a ledge below didn't actually land on the ledge -- they fell into the water -- the scene was shot to look that way.

I've only been on the acting or producing side of film, so while listening to Scott's commentary, I got an education on the directing/film making side.

In conclusion, I highly recommend this short -- the beautiful cinematography, the compelling story and characters, the suspense and pacing, the high action shots, and the engaging commentary will make it well worth your while.  Not to mention the appeal and nostalgia of seeing the Twin Towers on film.  My recommendation is to order this right away.  You'll get an education about filmmaking and you'll be entertained by a compelling story in the process!",1308355200,,4753,4.604513064133017
8339305,5,B001S0BMOO,"Crossings is a perfect blend of suspense, action, and performance driven drama.  The plot is a splice of a bigger story, condensed into a brilliant short film.  Superlative camera work, and clever editing, help to captivate the audience, and invoke emotion.",1307232000,,257,5.2439024390243905
8339306,5,B001S0BMOO,"Crossings is full of slam-bang action, a short film with enough thrills and excitement for a much longer movie.  The intersections of a group of unrelated characters on a bridge is a great device, and the film uses it to good effect. There are some excellent performances, especially Kristin Richardson (as the woman in peril) and Robert Youngs (as the thug who taunts her), which combined with first-rate directing and good camerawork make this an exciting ride from first minute to last.  Highly recommended.",1306454400,,510,5.059523809523809
