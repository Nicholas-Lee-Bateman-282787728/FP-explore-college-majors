7921581,5,B00004RPFV,"Rare. Excellent. I remember watching this movie when it was first released on the big screen. It was a real tongue and cheek hoot. Ron Ely was perfect for the role of Doc Savage. This movie is extremely hard to find and when I finally found it on VHS years ago I grabbed and paid the high price for it. I also have one of the original posters from the movie. I purchased it right from my old college town movie theater.
Great movie.",1423612800,,432,4.154761904761905
