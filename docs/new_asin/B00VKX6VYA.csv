8710498,5,B00VKX6VYA,"We may think we know the Wild West from history and movies, but this beautifully produced DVD set offers a fresh look at the stark beauty and often difficult reality of the terrain and times.  Ray Mears is well-known for his expertise in survival, and he makes the perfect guide to this view of how the west really was won. He's joined by experts that include the eloquent  Davy Arch, the Cherokee tribal elder who offers perspective on the landscape and the peoples who worked so hard to carve a living from a promising but often difficult land. Mears takes us along as he experiences the everyday dangers and victories in journeying  toward a new life. Rich videography will give you new views of much of the land we take for granted--and you may itch to trace pathways through the Applachians' heavily wooded surface, or believe that you, too, could pan for gold and find a fortune (""Gold and the Boomtowns""). So much more fun and absorbing than your 7th grade history book, this 8-chapter event is worth revisiting as a reminder of our country's sweeping past.",1439769600,,1064,4.679144385026738
8710499,5,B00VKX6VYA,"THE WILD WEST with Ray Mears is a fresh look at very familiar material.

Mears, who is well-known in the U.K. as a television host and presenter, is particularly known for his interest in bushcraft and survival techniques.  Many of his previous shows focus on surviving in the wilderness and on wildlife.

Mears' love and veneration for the American West is clearly evident in this 2-DVD set of 8 half hour programs. He begins, logically enough, on the Eastern part of America, taking the viewer immediately up into the Appalachian Mountain Range, former home of the Cherokee Indians.  In this episode he speaks almost with awe about the tenacity and resourcefulness of the early occupants--both Indian and white.  One fascinating aspect of the Cherokees that I did not know about was their proficiency with the blow gun, a weapon I always associate solely with Amazonian tribesmen and some Africans.  The means by which the Cherokees helped the white settlers is presented in such a way that it is clear the settlers would not have survived without the compassion and generosity of the Cherokee.  And of course the fate of the Cherokee--relocation to farmland in Oklahoma--is sadly documented as well.

Subsequent episodes strike a similar tone as they explore the various trails the settlers took to cross the continent and get to California and the other locations in the Promised Land that were so appealing that people were prepared to give up house and home and brave extreme weather, resistance by Indians and bandits, discomfort, disease and just about any other deterrent you can think of.  One doomed group of settlers, known as the Donner Party, probably exemplify the worst of what could go wrong.  Stranded by an early harsh winter, members of the Donner Party had to resort to cannibalism in order to survive.

Probably my favourite episode was the one in Utah, specifically when it explored Monument Valley, which has been used in the making of countless films, many of which were directed by John Ford and starred John Wayne.  Mears excitement when he encounters such famous landmarks and places of note is genuine and palpable.

The Wild American West continues to fascinate people the world over and this modest series helps to explain why.  Mears is a good host, he never gets in the way.  Rather he introduces in such a low-key fashion, interviews people with such skill and subtlety and shares information without the smallest inkling of forcing his opinion on the viewer.  He wants you to enjoy with him, not be impressed by his knowledge--the failing of many a television host/presenter.

THE WILD WEST with Ray Mears comes with a 16-page viewers guide with a map of settlers' westbound routes and articles on stagecoach services, how the west was wild, pioneering women's right to vote, little-known facts about cowboys, and Geronimo's art of war.

Occasionally the viewer could get the feeling that somewhere along the line the producers went ""oh, let's include that bit, too."" which explains why one of the Bonus Features profiles fascinating women of the west.  Interesting, yes, but it feels like an add-on.

But to err on the side of too much information is better than to have holes in the narrative.  Getting the right balance in determining what material to present may have been a challenge, but it is an understandable one in a program called THE WILD WEST.

Lots to savour here.  Fans of the West and Westerns will find much that is pleasing and entertaining in THE WILD WEST with Ray Mears.",1438732800,,3526,4.90893760539629
8710500,5,B00VKX6VYA,"The Wild West with Ray Mears.  In this BBC television presentation, wilderness skills expert and TV presenter Ray Mears takes viewers across North America on a journey back in time to the Wild West.  He follows in the footsteps of the intrepid would-be settlers, who set out to conquer the west-- and discovered a frontier that wouldnt easily surrender .This two-disc boxed set, which I received as a review copy, gives us eight episodes that run approximately 204 minutes, with subtitles, though the sound throughout is pretty clear. Also, a 16 page viewers guide with map of settlers routes west, articles on stagecoach services, how the west was wild, pioneering womens right to vote, little-known facts about cowboys, and Geronimos art of war.  Also, profiles of interesting women of the west. The series is currently syndicated to public television stations through APT.

Long before superhighways spanned North America, (right here in Wilmington, North Carolina, home to the Great Smoky chain of the Appalachians, U.S. 40, after more or less running into the Atlantic Ocean, then begins officially.  With a sign that says  if it hasn't been stolen againBarstow, California, 3225 miles.) But, back then, of course, westbound settlers lumbered across a dangerous continent by covered wagon or on foot. In this documentary, survivalist Mears retraces the steps of the 19th-century travelers and discovers how the trip's rugged terrain and deadly hazards affected and tested the pioneers.  He takes viewers across the seemingly impassable mountain ranges, sprawling grasslands, and arid deserts that confronted those, from North America, Europe and the British Isles, and Asia, who made the journey.

Along the way, from the densely forested Appalachians  he gives us a good interval showing the beauty of this old mountain range, and interviews Cherokee tribal elder Davy Arch--to the windswept peaks of the Sierra Nevada, Mears ventures into parts of America that remain untamed to this day.  He shows us settlers sod houses on the prairie; the route taken by the infamous Donner Party, which was forced to descend into cannibalism while being trapped  in the Rockies for a very long winter that didn't end until April.  And the Navajo Indians, agricultural dwellers of the Great Plains, and their close relationship with its Buffalo; also the Blackfoot tribe. The impact of railroads on the settlement of the west. A fascinating few minutes on how a local, riding a sure-footed formerly wild Maverick horse on Utahs Angel Trail, part of the outlaws escape route, is able to carefully navigate loose rock and dust down into a crater that would have sent a chasing posse home pronto.  Also, Tombstone, one of the most famous Western towns, with its daily recreated fight at OK corral.  And he discusses the warrior Apache tribe, particularly its famous leader Geronimo, and his methods of war. Finally, he pans for gold in California.

The episodes are: The First Settlers, Furs and the Mountain Men, the Wagon Trains, Homesteaders and Cowboys, Plains Indians and Buffalo, Gold and the Boomtowns, Bandits and Lawlessness, The Desert Indians. I found this series fresh, interesting and informative: it should appeal to fans of history, or those who are interested in nature survival.  It can clearly be helpful in schools; or more than that, where any group of children  or adultsis regularly gathered for learning/entertainment purposes. Highly recommended.",1437782400,3,3460,5.227848101265823
8710501,5,B00VKX6VYA,"The wild landscapes of 19th century America guided the brave souls westward. Ray Mears, a noted wilderness enthusiast, having previous TV series on landscape wildness, but in the UK, takes on the American West. I guess a Brit finally had to come and see why so many left the UK and were willing to fight to have their own country void of British rule and tax. What Mears provides is not a complete look, but a film educate-documentary of how the wild landscapes of America interacted with the natives and then the white pioneers moving into new western lives. It's well done with excellent film, interviews, historic stills, artifacts, and treks where most humans can only dream of walking. I enjoyed meeting ancestors of both pioneers and Native Americans.

Perfect for homeschooling, public schools, and educators teaching the ways and means of the pioneer movements. It's entertaining learning, but not Hollywood style gun-slinging. Wait, there is the shootout at the OK Corral, a tourist reenactment, but most is nature and history and how they collided to make the WEST WILD.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 8 episodes, each about 25 minutes.
==1== The 1st Settlers ==Cherokee mountain meds help white settlers in the Appalachians. The Trail of Tears and logging change landscapes. Tribal leader Davy Arch talks of his ancestral ways and demonstrates skills.
==2== Furs & the Mountain Men ==High Rocky Mts of West America was a barrier to movement progress but it teemed with animal pelts desired by eastern cities. Mountain men lead the way up and over, in pursuit of the ferocious wildlife.
==3== The Wagon Trains ==Pioneers traveled westward in `prairie schooners' over the plains facing not only extreme landscapes & weather, but disease, injury, and danger from man & beasts. The goal was farm land; later it became California gold.
==4== Homesteaders & Cowboys ==Settlers of Nebraska's prairie used the sod. It was the territory of the cowboy and cattle drives. The 1869 railroad was the destination of the Western cowboys. Longhorn cattle were prairie gold. 1880 barbed wire fence ends an era.
==5== Plains Indians & Buffalo ==Blackfoot stages a modern buffalo hunt and shows how all parts are used--no waste. Marketing buffalo hide brought a swift end to the massive herds and the Native American lifestyle.
==6== Gold & the Boomtowns == California gold rush with a look at the ghost town of Bodie, now empty of prospectors and their suppliers.
==7== Bandits & Lawlessness ==Guns rule the west. Coach & train robbers would hit, then hide, in the wilderness. American deserts are beautiful landscape but dangerous travel.
==8== The Desert Indians ==A story about the Navajo, farmers. Geronimo, the Apache chief, gorilla warfare, a people who knew the landscape.

Leave it to the Brits to produce a entertaining yet educational series on the historical American landscape of the shifting Wild West.",1437091200,7,2900,5.062761506276151
