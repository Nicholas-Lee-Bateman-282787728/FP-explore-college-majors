266288,5,6300247139,"Sally Field won her 1979 Best Actress Oscar for a very simple reason - she gave one of the most powerful characterizations in cinematic history.  Ever since I saw this film, about six months ago, it has left a haunting  impression.  Thanks to the central lead, this is one of the most powerful,  moving and truly unforgettable films ever made.",917481600,5,343,4.666666666666667
266349,5,6300247139,"I first saw this movie when it was originally released, some 40 years ago.  It has certainly withstood the passage of time.  Sally Field gives a riveting performance as Norma Ray, a woman who has experienced many losses and hardships who comes into her own power.  And Ron Lieberman does an outstanding job as her mentor Ruben, the union organizer.  Excellent supporting actors, and a wonderful portrayal of a sleepy little deep southern town that is slow to accept the exotic outsider, an educated NYC Jewish man.  In retrospect I realize that the unionization of the textile mill proceeded relatively smoothly, but that does not detract from the courage displayed by Norma Ray and the other factory workers in daring to challenge authority, and in crossing racial and cultural lines in recognition of the fact that the white and black workers have common grievances and need to pull together.  But I did find the ending very unsatisfactory.  There is no resolution regarding Norma Ray's arrest; the union should have represented her in court, and gotten her job back and/or compensation.",1506470400,,1089,5.016666666666667

266444,3,6300247139,"Norma Rae, 1974 film

It begins with scenes in a factory where raw cotton is transferred into cloth, then shows photos of a young girl. She grows up in a mill town. They show scenes of the work and noise in this factory. [No EPA to control noise pollution?] They don't care about you. A young woman tells about her shopping needs. A stranger arrives, he wants to rent a room. He is a labor organizer who wants to start a union for the underpaid workers. Norma Rae had a date with George, who returns to his wife and kids. George doesnt like a rejection! Norma Rae is aided by that labor organizer. Later the Textile Workers Union organizer hands out leaflets.

Norma Rae is promoted to spot checker at higher wages. She has two young children to support. Will this cause conflicts? We hear about Norma Raes past. A man acts up at work, then apologizes to Norma Rae at home. Her father complains. [Isnt it too late?] After drinking a lot Norma Rae throws up. [Symbolism?] At work people don't talk to Norma Rae. [Boycott?] She goes to the lake with a friend and their children. Later they marry. A union unites workers, textile factories pay low wages. The union organizer inspects the bulletin boards to see if notices were removed. [The unceasing noise must damage hearing after many years.]

[Why do people have two names? Because slaves had only one name?] Norma Rae wants to use the local church for a union meeting; she is denied. [Who owns the church?] Workers tell of their complaints. Brown Lung is an industrial disease of cotton workers (breathing in fibers). Reuben knows how to approach people. The management punished the workers with a stretch-out: fewer working days but with more work each day! One tired worker collapsed into a vat of dye! There is a funeral. At night union officers give advice on deportment (to prevent the union from looking bad).

There is conflict because of a letter from the factory management. Can they get a copy of that letter? [Memorize a line at a time.] Her activity at work gets her arrested for disorderly conduct. She tells her children about their fathers and gives them photographs, then explains her firing. There is a vote for organizing a union, this wins 475 to 375. The union organizers work is completed, he says goodbye to Norma Rae, then leaves with his overloaded compact car. [That seems like a lot of baggage for a migrant worker.]

This is an interesting story, one different from the usual Hollywood movies. I think it has a little too much padding. The choice of the characters and personalities must have been made for a purpose. It is worth watching once. Was a character like Norma Rae the best choice to use in organizing a union? Would people respect her? What will happen when rich investors build foreign factories after cutting the tariff to allow cheaper imports to undersell domestic products? Can anything be done to trump these deals?",1467158400,,2912,4.6796875

266588,5,6300247139,"One of Sally Fields' dynamic performances sets the tone for the story of how labor unions changed the face of America and the manufacturing landscape for hundreds of thousands of people.  Living in a depressed area of the rural south and having to take on dead end jobs that left one with physical maladies, a person had few choices and little recourse when taking a job in one of the only factories in the area that offered steady employment.  Being overworked and underpaid is only the tip of the iceberg as Reuben,  a ""City Slicker/ Union Man"" who happens to be Jewish comes to town to try and get workers organized and into a union that will ensure their working environment and their futures.  It's a hard sell with townsfolk being suspicious of city folk, anyone who is not of their faith as well as anyone they don't know until Norma Rae chances to meet and get to know Reuben, who is played to the New York hilt by Ron Leibman.  The casting is absolutely expert in this film and Beau Bridges as well as Pat Hingle and Barbara Baxley bring up the rear in this well directed film by Marvin Ritt. It's a keeper!",1443830400,,1116,4.424390243902439

266656,4,6300247139,"Two five star American political films on one disc.  But sadly, neither transfer is great, accounting for the four star rating.  Coming Home especially is weak in comparison to the recent blu-ray release, with sound that is really low quality (a big problem for a film that uses music as such a key part of it's style).

If you can afford it, get these classics separately on blu-ray.  If makes a much better viewing experience, and one you'll be more likely to return to.  Saving money on something less than great looking/sounding isn't a big savings if the lack of quality means you don't enjoy it as much or you don't want to watch it again...",1441670400,,647,4.543103448275862

266659,2,6300247139,"I love Sally Field, but I absolutely hated her performance and character in this film.  This is definitely not her best role or movie by a long shot, and all that hooplah about four Oscar nominations has to be politics.  I'm sorry, but I felt I wasted my money on this.  I even fell asleep.  If you enjoy watching a small town undereducated woman have sex like a machine with the local boys and her routine wasted life working in an industrial gin, then by all means buy this film.  Otherwise, save the popcorn for something that is more worthy the Oscar nominations without the politics supporting it.  I am all for the 'union' concept and the fight to implement it, but this film truly lacks in intrigue, interest, and anything remotely entertaining.  I know ""Silkwood"" is ten times more brilliantly acted and was a script more worthy an Oscar in comparison.  A ""Triumph""!  I think not!",1438560000,,888,4.6050955414012735

266995,4,6300247139,"Hollywood has a rich tradition of producing topical that subsequently wind up becoming video time capsules, summing up where we were as a society at the time.  In 1979 ""Norma Rae"" was a trenchant look into the pervasive poverty of the American South and unions as a means to shift that paradigm.  It was a groundbreaking performance for Sally Field, normally cast as the ingnue, and for Beau Bridges as her put-upon husband.  I'd not seen the film in its original release, but seeing it 30 years on certainly does give it a different feel.  At the time of its initial release it was as pro-union a film as could be imagined.  Thirty years on it now feels more like an elegy for an industry shipped overseas as a result of higher wages and globalization.  The unionization of ""Norma Rae"" ironically proved to be the undoing of the mills and the millworkers.  The mill itself plays a prominent role in the movie, and the work seems little changed from even a hundred years prior.  The loud roar of the machines pervades the movie, the cotton lint floating in the air coating the machines and workers alike a rough symbolism of how the workers and machines have become one.

""Norma Rae"" is also pitch-perfect for the times, capturing the racism and anti-Semitism of the era; something rarely attempted in today's politically correct times.  Field is superb as the flawed yet indomitable Norma Rae, and it's easy to see how she won the Oscar for her performance.  The end is fittingly unsentimental and atypical for a Hollywood film with Norma Rae seeing Rueben, the union organizer, off to yet another destination.  You couldn't create a better ending as sentimentalists would have the two running off together, but realists know Rueben is a man on a mission.  The parting is the perfect metaphor for how the mills and their jobs would move on, seeking better opportunities, leaving the millworkers behind, jilted and unemployed.  The deeper meaning of ""Norma Rae"" is that the millworkers and the mills needed each other desperately.  Once one became a free agent the cycle of dependency was broken and mills were free to court other better options.

""Norma Rae"" ultimately is more about the message but little thought as to the consequences.  While unions could break the cycle of poverty for millworkers it proved to be a Pyrrhic victory, and if anything hastened the demise of their jobs.  And to that end ""Norma Rae"" becomes an even more damning condemnation of Free Market Capitalism without ostensibly intending to do so.  ""Norma Rae"" was certainly a polarizing movie at the time and it remains so today.  Few who watch it now will be inspired to join a union or feel compelled to be unabashedly pro-union; it's quite simply not going to change many minds.  If anything it's a glimpse into who we were as a people and as a society.",1267056000,12,2834,4.742857142857143
266996,5,6300247139,"Norma Rae is a southern textile worker employed in a factory with intolerable working conditions.

A good supporting cast which includes Ron Leibman, Pat Hingle and Beau Bridges all add to Field's show-stopping performance.

266998,5,6300247139,"On the face of it today a story about an impoverished, hard-nosed widowed woman trying to support several children working in a southern textile mill and who seeks to unionize the plant against one of the major textile companies might rate a documentary or docu-drama treatment but, perhaps not much else. The demographics and the audience would probably not be there for such a commercial endeavor, Sally Field or no Sally Field. That says more about the state of the organized labor movement in this country, the dramatic decline in union membership, the lack of recent successful major union organizing drives, the ""globalization"" of industry that has de-industrialized America and the attenuation of links between the old trade union movement forged in the class battles of the 1930s and 1940s and their grandchildren, today's youth.

Back in 1973, however, this film was a hit not only because of the well-done performances by Sally Fields, as that down-troddened but spirited woman turned effective union organizer and Ron Liebman, as the northern union organizer called in to advice (?) Norma Rae. 1950s ""red scare"" black-listed writer Martin Ritt, who directed this film, also deserves kudos for not overburdening the film with unnecessary sentimentality. The times then thus were not out of joint for such an effort. The residue of 1960s radicalism and pro-working class sentiments still hung in the air. Moreover, the times were just becoming ripe for serious films about the trials and tribulations of women, especially working women and their problems, under the sign of the burgeoning women's movement.

Of courser this particular review is posted here today because, unfortunately, the real-life model for the character of Norma Rae Crystal Lee Sutton has just passed away in North Carolina at the age of 68. I will finish up here by quoting a remark that I made in another space about her passing that also reflects on the highlight dramatically tense moment in the film:

""No labor militant, or even just a simple friend of the international labor movement could do anything but cheer at that moment in ""Norma Rae"", based on the actual experience of Crystal Lee Sutton, when Sally Field silently holds up a handmade sign that said ""Union""- and everyone downs tools. Such events are the stuff not just of labor legend, but under the right circumstances revolution. Farewell, Sister."" I need say no more.",1253059200,2,2418,5.085642317380352
266999,5,6300247139,"Sally Field proved to Hollywood that she was more than just ""The Flying Nun"" when she starred in Norma Rae.

267000,5,6300247139,"There are a lot of films about the overworked and underappreciated finally standing up for themselves and fighting for what they know they are owed; but `Norma Rae' is a notch above most of them.  Not only is it moving but it is engrossing and enlightening.  It works its magic in all areas of the film; shedding light on the issues, gathering our support and fleshing out three-dimensional characters we love, love to hate and even hate to love.

Norma is a small town girl who is doing what she's been brought up to do.  She's a widow who is raising her two children while living with her overprotective father and working in the same mill as her parents.  She is going nowhere fast, but she doesn't know any better.  Then Reuben shows up in her town and tosses her whole life upside down.  Reuben is a unionizer from New York who is determined to make things better for the working class people in the area.  He only needs to rally enough support from the likes of Norma, and after she witnesses what the corrupt men in power are willing to do to prevent the union she becomes all the more determined to get it passed.

What is so wonderful about `Norma Rae' is that it is as much about the woman that is Norma as it is about the union she so fervently wants to get passed.  The film is interested in her as a person, and thus we become interested in her; in her family life, her love life, her past and her eventual future.  The film's primary interest is focused on her dedication to the union, but it also gives ample time to build her relationship with her small town boyfriend/husband Sonny as well as her budding relationship with Reuben.

The film is multilayered.

Sally Field won her first Oscar for her riveting portrayal of Norma.  It's funny; when the film starts we get a taste of overacting at its finest with Norma screaming at her boss about how her mother is deaf because of the noise in the mill.  I immediately began to wonder if this was going to be one of those flashy performances that is almost all show and no depth.  I said a silent prayer that Field not scream through this whole movie and my prayer was instantly answered.  Yes, Field is impeccable here, capturing the essence of this woman with steely determination.  Some of her quieter scenes are her most captivating; especially when she confesses to her husband that Reuben is in her head.  That scene is instantly stolen from her though, but her co-star Beau Bridges who grabs your heart with when he responds that no one else is in his head by Norma.  Beau has gotten the shaft over the years.  I guess that's what happens when your brother is Jeff Bridges.  I must tell you though, Beau is a talent all his own.  His performance here is beyond words.  He is so moving, so sincere and so lovable.

Every husband should strive to be more like him, and every woman would be lucky to find a man like him.

`Norma Rae' is a splendid film about one woman's struggle to save her family and her entire town from the clutches of corruption; to give them what they work so hard for and spare them any further abuse.  It is also a story of a woman's struggle to find herself amidst a town that never changes and barely allows room for self expression.  This is a film about life and what you make of it and what you're willing to sacrifice in order to get what you deserve.",1236211200,,3350,4.377022653721683

I saw the film (from my Dad's Collection), in our home theatre. Granted the acting is very good, the production is excellent and the story relevant, there's still something irritating (for me) in the way a young mother, Sally Field, ignores her husband (Beau Bridges) and kids to spend every possible moment , day and night, with a slimy union official (Ron Liebman). They are trying to bring the bring the workers at a Southern Textile Plant into much-needed solidarity and director, Martin Ritt is obviously trying equally as hard to avoid the usual cliches of the hard-hearted, pig-headed, capitalistic boss and the passive severely put-upon workers. Sally Field succeeds more than Ritt does. On the one hand, the textile workers learn how to strike, get better wages and a little employer respect. On the other hand, there's a family crying out for their mother. Music and credits are superb. Sally Field won an Academy Award for her performance.",1226534400,,1085,5.621951219512195

267049,5,6300247139,"If you love great acting, memorable dialogue, unforgettable scenes that stay with you since the 1979 movie debut, and if you adore socially conscious films where the underdog outwits the oppressor, then Norma Rae is the film to return to.

Based on a true story about a Southern textile mill and attempts by a northern union organizer to form the first union, Norma Rae is fiction, not fact. Sally Field (b. 1946) as Norma Rae won a well-deserved Oscar in her embittered battle against hardnosed union management who turned a blind eye to the legitimate complaints of their long-suffering workers: excruciatingly high noise levels which deafened some employees, cotton fibers at the mill which caused lung disease, and scant wages barely higher than a sweat shop's for backbreaking work that literally killed some of the mill's loyal employees.

Management didn't care. After all, they were the only company in town. But Sally Field, egged on and smitten by a union representative from New York, brilliantly and subtly played by Ron Leibman (b. 1937), was a pawn in his hand. Had she not met Leibman it is doubtful that she would have risen to power in the never-named southern factory, which is really the famous J.P.Stevens out of North Carolina. The movie was filmed in Alabama.

The delightful culture and sense of place of the South is evoked, including choirsinging in churches, fire & brimstone preachers, and baking of delicious pies. Since I'd seen the film when it first came out, I was awaiting my favorite moment, one of the great moments in all of moviedom:  the suspensful climax where Field climbs up on the table holding out a sign reading Union and turns round and round until each employee shuts off the deafening machine he or she is working at.

A viewer can't ask for anything as tearjerkingly emotional as that!

Field's character, with poor self-respect and children by different men, evolves into a character with dignity, thanks to her platonic relationship with Leibman. When her husband asks, ""Are you sleeping with him?"" she utters the classic lines, ""No, but he's in my mind.""  That happily clinches the relationship for Field and her husband, endearingly played by Beau Bridges (b. 1941 and son of Sea-Hunt Lloyd) and he vows to love Sally all the more.

Feisty, fervent, and flamboyant describe our riveting heroine, a true joy to behold, with her skinny sexy body that, to me, anyway, seems to long for her Jewish mentor and teacher, Leibman, the man who has opened her eyes to the larger world of culture, books and catching your dreams. For him, she begins reading one of his favorite poets, Dylan Thomas. He's had the power to change this plain woman with poor morals into a strong outspoken survivor.

Is Leibman just using her to get the union started? No,they part with genuine respect for one another, sealed by a handshake. An earlier scene shows them taking a delightful skinnydip together. Leibman is always a calm force to Field's tempestuous behavior.

However, it may be that socially conscious director Martin Ritt (1914-1990) blacklisted during the McCarthy era, just may have been using the real Norma Rae - Crystal Lee Sutton - since she didn't receive a cent from the film. However, Crystal states in later interviews she enjoyed the film and the attention.

In a memorable line, Leibman asks, ""Why is it all you southerners have three names?""

Watch the movie to experience the thrill of defiance and winning. Watch it  to root for Sally Field to take on the establishment and, glory be, to win!",1165276800,7,3546,4.880199667221298
267050,5,6300247139,"While watching Reuben interact with the factory workers, I am reminded of a resounding theme backed by a specific paragraph from Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed. On page 65 Freire states that ""attempting to liberate the oppressed without their reflective participation in the act of liberation is to treat them as objects which must be saved from a burning building."" This thought is also reinforced on page 94 with the excerpt from the Selected Works of Mao-Tse-Tung, Vol. III. It states that ""All work done for the masses must start from their needs and not from the desire of any individual, however well-intentioned.... There are two principles here: one is the actual needs of the masses rather than what we fancy they need, and the other is the wishes of the masses, who must make up their own minds instead of our making their minds for them.""

It was very clear that the factory workers (masses) needed a change. The working environment was hazardous to their daily health, the pay was horrendous and the treatment was detrimental to people's spirits. However, this is the view of the ""liberator"" and not of the oppressed. A significant portion of the factory workers (as demonstrated by the vote) were not yet conscious of their needs and not yet willing to make the change. This was true for the majority of the workers at the beginning of the movie. While Reuben managed to change some of their minds, it was not done through dialogue. I never once felt that Reuben trusted in the factory worker's ability to reason and to come to this decision (the need for a union) on their own. To me, Reuben always prescribed to the banking concept of education. He deposited information (in the forms of speeches and leaflets) and expected the factory workers to accept it as truth and to follow along.

The funny thing is, this is not done out of malice. I do believe that his intentions were sincere but like many individuals who feel the need to ""liberate"" the oppressed, they subconsciously see a cause and not actual people.",1160092800,2,2032,4.753541076487252
267051,5,6300247139,"This film is definitely one of Sally Fields' best. Sally portrays Norma Rae, a machine operator and union organizer, in a southern cotton processing facility. Every worker in America should see this film and be inspired by it, especially during the times we're living in. After surviving all kinds of coercive measures from the bosses and their allies in the local police, Norma manages to prevail through courage and the lone but persevering support of an outside union organizing official. Her dream of organizing the factory worker in a union, that truly represents their rights finally comes true.",1142640000,,601,5.142857142857143

267053,5,6300247139,"Norma Rae put Sally Field on the map.  Although she stunned television audiences a few years earlier with the Emmy winning performance in Sybil, most still thought of her as either Sister Bertrille from The Flying Nun or TV's Gidget.

Based on a true story, Norma Rae is a single mother of two, not all in wedlock.  She lives at home with mother (Barbara Baxley) and father (Pat Hingle).  She works at the OP Henley textile mill.  She is having an affair with a married man.

Into her life comes two very different men.  First is Ruben Kincaid (Ron Leibman), a Jewish union organizer from New York.  Ruben wants to organize the textile mill but needs to get an in at the factory. The second is Sonny Webster (Beau Bridges), another mill worker.  Sonny takes a shining to Norma and starts to date her.  After a while, they get married and they combine their three kids together.

Ruben is looking for that one person to get him in with the workers.  He sees that Norma is a bit of rebel and also cares for her coworkers.  This is the woman he needs.  After a few meetings and seeing Ruben take on the bosses, she signs on.  She works tirelessly for the union.  It starts to become her entire life and almost ends her marriage.

The mill turns up the heat with threats of shift cuts and scares off the workers from the union meetings.  That is until Norma Rae's father dies after a supervisor refuses to let him off when he was feeling bad.  But the mill puts up a racist notice which prompts the film's famous scene.  Norma Rae writes down what is on the notice and management tries to stop her.  She gets up on a table and writes UNION of a piece of cardboard.  She holds it up and one by one the workers shut off their machines.  Then she is dragged of by the police.  This leads to what a friend called Sally's Oscar scene where she sits down with her kids and explains their parentage. (No dry eyes here).

The factory holds the union vote and the union is approved.

Sally Field deservedly won the Oscar and set her career on fire.  But you also have to give a big round to the supporting cast.  Pat Hingle as her father gives a the performance of his career.  Barbara Baxley showed her versatility in this role.  In Nashville she played a flamboyant diva.  In Norma Rae, she plays a woman beaten down by her life and just wants a life where she is not noticed.  Gail Strickland plays Norma's best friend.  This is a role that she will perfect over the next few years.  And finally, Beau Bridges once again shows that he is a great actor.

Director Martin Ritt will team up with Sally two more times.  The next year in Back Roads which was a mild miss and then ten years later with Murphy's Romance which was another home run.

DVD EXTRA: Backstory: Norma Rae - When AMC decided to launch an informational series about making of films that made a difference, their first episode was on Norma Rae.  This is the 24 minute show featuring interviews with Ron Leibman, producer Tamara Asseyev, agent Michael Ovitz, Sally Field and cinematographer John Alonzo.",1137110400,5,3058,4.413978494623656
267094,5,6300247139,"This is a great movie. For several reasons. Let me tell you one of them. The undercurrent is not homeric or heroic, it's about leadership.

I teach a course in Leadership at a local college. One of the Chapters is about Women as Leaders. Well, we're kind of off in a fantasy world here if we try to use props. And the chasm beteen what we see on the screen and the real world, fantasy and application, is wide, enormous and scary.

So this is not about Vin Diesel saving the world with his enormous biceps, nor Arnold with giant pecs protecting women and children. Nor is it a braless Signourney Weaver in a tee shirt and two machine guns on her hips blowing up aliens.

This is about one of us in the body of a short, cute, 90 pound woman, uneducated, riddled with human flaw, inspired by her antithesis, a highly educated jewish labor organizer, to stand up and like Tommy Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Olympics, raise her fist in defiance of the machine.

And, Sally Field does give the performanvce of a lifetime with all the nuances of an uneducated person sensing the right thing but lacking the tools with which to do it.

There's a scene where she has to sign her name and she stares at the paper and purses her tongue and bites her lip in concentration. Small affectation. Brilliant. She got the Oscar and I think we laughed at her. She's Gidget for God's sake. The Flying Nun. It's even funnier than if Goldie Hawn won it. But here's the final answer: She deserved it.

You know what the plot's about. This Alabama about 20 years after Brown v. Board of Education, 10 years after The Heart of Atlanta decison, and 6 or 7 years after the Civil Rights killings. So it's not a safe venue for change. And Ron Liebman as the organizer Reuben has one thing going for him, he's not black. But everything else about him is what many southerners at that time hated. He's jewish, he's ""a left-o,"" he's educated, he's from New Yawk. And somehow, the factory worker Norma Rae is drawn to him. I think she loves him and he her, but not that way. He changes her life, and she can never return. She has become a leader, with vision, communication, and patience. Hell. At the end she's reading Dylan Thomas. See the movie. 5 stars.

267095,5,6300247139,"This film was released when I was very young.  I remembered hearing all about it but never watched it until now.  Sally Field's Oscar win was well deserved.

Unfortunately, the current industrial situation in the US has put a major damper on the feel good ending of this movie.  There are almost no textile mills in the US now.  It is sad watching Norma Rae live thru this incredible struggle only to know that in 10 to 15 years it will no longer matter.

As well as being about labor unions, this movie is also a love story.  Sally Field has wonderful chemistry with her two male costars, Ron Liebman and Beau Bridges.  Both of their characters fall in love with Norma and throughout the movie they fight for her attention.  Bridges pulls out all the stops and proposes.  Liebman's Reuben tells fantastic stories about his Union Job, life in the big city and is generally exciting, almost enticing Norma to leave her small town life.  Liebman is great as Reuben and he embodies NY cool to the nth degree.  He makes Reuben stand out like a peacock in the small town and Norma is fascinated by him.  In one great scene, Liebman enters a local bar where Field and Bridges are on their first date.  Field's Norma immediately becomes Flirty, flighty and giggly over the appearance of her NY crush.  As Liebman turns on the charm, Bridges fades into the background, his face falling to the floor in defeat.  My heart went out to Bridges' character and it reminded me of all the times I was in the same situation.

But this film is owned heart and soul by Sally Field.  From the time she fights for her Mother's health to when she stands up with her Union sign, I was cheering for her.

I just wish the film was longer because I wanted to find out what Norma's next adventure would be.",1102377600,,1779,4.435185185185185
267096,4,6300247139,"I finally got the chance to watch this movie after missing out for almost 20 years.  I should have watched this film years ago.  Not only is Sally Field's acting great, but the screenplay was just as great as well.  My only problem was the length of the movie as I thought 20 minutes could have been chopped off.  With that said, this movie should be mandatory watching for all workers.  If you care about the conditions in your workplace, watch it and learn how to organize your workplace!!  It's a film much needed for required viewing in our society today!",1079395200,4,559,4.485148514851486
267097,5,6300247139,"""Norma Rae"" contains the thrilling performance by Sally Field as a woman on the wrong side of the tracks of life who decides it's time to stand up for the rights of her co-workers at a small textile plant.
She is offered and accepts a promotion when the plant's management tries to divert her, but a supervisory role doesn't appeal to her when her mother loses her hearing and she has to chastise her father for poor performance. Logically, inevitably she becomes more committed to fighting for a better life for herself and her loved ones and joins forces with a union organizer who came down from NYC. She ends up sacrificing all, including her self esteem, to give the workers more control over their working conditions.
Chills ran down my spine during the scene where she held up the ""union"" sign and another where she rebuked her husband for being non-supportive of her union efforts. I am not a union supporter, but I know good drama, strong performances, and a logical and interesting plot when I see it, so I recommend this fine film to all.
Hopefully they will give as much time and attention to dubbing and subtitling this movie into languages of third world countries because that's where this textile plant probably relocated a year after the events this film portrayed. A sad, sad outcome to an ideal.
No matter what the outcome, Sally Field delivers one of the finest performances in film history so ""Norma Rae"" gets only my highest recommendations!",1078185600,14,1463,4.741176470588235

267099,4,6300247139,"Sally Field gives a career turning performance in 1979's Norma Rae.  Up to that point, Ms. Field was better known as a TV actress who starred in fluffy comedies like Gidget, The Flying Nun & The Girl With Something Extra.  In 1976, she showed a more serious side, taking home an Emmy for her work as a young girl with multiple personalities in Sybil.  After Sybil, she proceeded to star in more fluff pieces like Smokey & The Bandit, Hooper & The End with her then boyfriend Burt Reynolds.  Norma Rae was a film with much more substance.  In fact after reading the script, Mr. Reynolds advised her that she would win an Oscar for the film.  He turned out to be quite prophetic.  Ms. Field is superb in the title role.  Norma is an unassuming factory worker from a small town in the South, who is widowed and has two kids with two separate fathers.  That is until she meets Reuben Warshawky (Ron Liebman).  Reuben is an Union organizer from New York City and he is trying to get the mill workers to set up a union.  Most people ignore as they are fearful for their jobs, but Norma is intrigued and she starts meeting with Reuben to try and start a union.  She is met with resistance and is bullied by her bosses, but Norma is not persuaded to quit.  She feels that she has stood by her whole life without making a difference and this is her chance to actually matter.  There is of course the famous scene where Norma is about to be removed from the mill and she defiantly stands on a table with the Union sign.  Her co-workers one by one realize the chances she's taken for them and they shut off their machines in support.  The film has some excellent supporting work from Mr. Liebman, Beau Bridges and Pat Hingle, but this is Ms. Field's film all the way.  She proved Mr. Reynolds right and took home the 1979 Best Actress Oscar and set forth on a path that would add another Oscar to her collection and feature some of the best films of 1980's & 1990's.",1041811200,17,1955,4.326923076923077
267100,4,6300247139,"Director Martin Ritt reportedly commented that his film of a mother working in a southern textile mill was flawed but that he hoped it was a realtistic portrayal of life and its flaws. It's tough to find the flaws in this superb film that earned Sally Field the first of her two Oscars (""Places in the Heart"" won her the second five years later). As mill worker Norma Rae, Field's character lands the reluctant role of union organizer but in the process uncovers the essence of her own character and courage. The latter is no better conveyed than in what turned out to be one of cinematic history's most memorable images when the near-beaten Norma Rae stands on a table in front of 800 co-workers and, in so doing, becomes her own person. The film expertly conveys life in a southern town, but its devastating impact is Norma Rae's gradual emergence as a truly courageous person who is willing to risk it all to literally stand up for what she knows is right. Field's riveting performance reeled in every major acting award the year the film was released, and justly so. It may well remain her best work ever.",1038873600,19,1109,4.577889447236181

""Norma Rae"" is the story of a working woman who gets tired of being exploited by the factory she works for, which is one of the few companies in her town, where her whole family has been working for years, and in the future so will her children. After meeting a man from the Textil Union, she starts to get involved with the organization, and the fights for the workers' rights as well. Slowly she gets concious that union and Union make a whole difference.
What I think is most interesting in this movie is the fact that is very timeless and placeless. Even now, 20 years later of its releasing, the subject is still up to date, everywhere there are employees fighting against unfair employers. And even though, it is about political and social aspects of society, the film does not tries to give you a lecture.
As I aforementioned, Sally Field deliveries very good. The transformation of Nora from a party girls who only wants to date and drink into a working class hero is completely believable. Moreover, we stay by her side all the time rooting for her gets the rights they want. The supporting cast does also a very good work. Ron Liebman -- as the man who introduces Norma to the Union, and becomes a kind of mentor to her -- and Beau Bridges -- as her husband-- are very impressive. Martin Ritt's direction is very discreet and effective.
All in all, I highly recomend this movie. It is very entertaining and deep. People who are looking for some intelligent and touching film should go straight to this one.",1013126400,6,1780,4.58307210031348
