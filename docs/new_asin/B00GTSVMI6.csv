8627454,5,B00GTSVMI6,"You are considering this Scotty Moore DVD because you love the Sun Record Sessions and rockabilly themes. Yes, buy this. Does not teach note for note transcription but more the stylistic approach, characteristic sounds, shapes, and licks. Hybrid pickers and thumb pickers will pick it up pretty quick but beginners interested can find some accessible sections. Start super slow, syncopation is important, tabs are available on Max's personal webpage.",1491350400,,450,5.536231884057971
