6601712,5,B00MU1YE40,"This is a great value for 3 good Christmas movies.  Like most people, I found some better than others -- we may disagree on which -- but they are all pretty good.

""A Country Christmas"" is the story of a young biracial girl whose father is gone from her life and whose mother does not want her to waste her time learning music -- the thing that brought Mom & Dad together in the first place.  The daughter doesn't listen and therein lies the tale.  And a good one it is.  This one is not very much about Christmas, mostly it takes place throughout a single year, but I found it to be an interesting and entertaining tale.

My favorite was/is ""The Twelve Trees of Christmas"", which is very much set in the Christmas season and stars a young librarian who loves her community, her job and, probably most of all, the library where she works.  It's a beautiful library, so why is the grandson of the man who built it determined to tear it down and replace it with a luxury condo?  Both she and he are determined to get their way -- despite that, they actually like each other; almost.  Nice story, nice cast, and some beautiful Christmas scenery.  I would love to have 12 Christmas trees decorated by people who loved them enough to take their time and do it right sitting in my living room.  Maybe next year.

Th 3rd one is ""Kristin's Christmas Past"" and stars a young woman 34 years of age who is not happy with her life and gets a chance to go back to her teen years to try to fix that.  True, the storyline has been done before, but that's true of many, maybe most Christmas stories.  It's the way they play out that makes them good and this one didn't disappoint me.

For the price of one inexpensive DVD, you get three pretty good Christmas movies.  I wish that happened more often.  These three are family-friendly.",1424908800,26,1818,4.347181008902077

6601717,4,B00MU1YE40,"I enjoyed all three of these movies, but, you must remember that I watch CHRISTMAS movies year 'round.
I'll comment on the, single disc, DVD case PHOTOGRAPHIC ART:
1.)---------------------------The white girl with the toothy-grin---that looks a lot like a young Marie Osmond---in
""A Country Christmas Story"" is only seen in the last fifteen minutes, or so... as is that boy to the far right.
Most of the film centers around the ""half-black"" young-woman holding the guitar, and her [""mixed""] parents'
marriage problems. There was NO ""craming racism down your throat"" as another reviewer claimed.

2.)---------------------------The second film was about a librarian wanting to save her library... and find her man.
""The Twelve Trees of Christmas"" was probably the best of the three, but the least likely to ACTUALLY happen.
A fable.

3.)---------------------------I enjoyed all of the cast of an old Television Series ""ROSWELL"" One of the co-stars in
""Kristin's Christmas Past"", already successful (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Father-the-Hero/dp/B00008978R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Father the Hero</a>), went on to become the success that IS
Katherine Heigl. The other three didn't do as well: Shiri Appleby [Maria] stars in this movie as a 34-year-old
that regrets her life's choices, ala, A CHRISTMAS CAROL with a time-travel element.
I enjoyed this one VERY much... but, I'm a dreamer, and, a AM a time-traveller, myself.

THREE very enjoyable movies!",1422662400,12,1502,5.818181818181818

8674574,3,B00MU1YE40,"Three so-called Christmas movies crammed together on one DVD.  The first movie deals with a music hating mother who tries to stifle her daughters dream of becoming a singer.  A contest is involved but actually has very little to do with this family melodrama.  Dolly Parton almost sings Jingle Bells.  The ending negates the reason for the plot in the first place.  The second film also involves a faux contest.  Twelve trees are decorated for Christmas.  In this case no winner is announced, and no actual judging takes place.  The contest is simply a ploy to save a building that a spoiled brat wants to tear down.  The third film is about a party girl who travels back in time to visit her teen-self, so she can dispense useless advice to herself that she won't follow.  Again, another pointless exercise in futility.  None of these movies are very Christmassy.
A disappointing collection.  Lifetime is no Hallmark.",1514332800,2,918,4.814102564102564
