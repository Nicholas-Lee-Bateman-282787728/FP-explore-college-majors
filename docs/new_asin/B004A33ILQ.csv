Ocean Annie tells the kids all kinds of fun facts about the fish and other sea creatures that live in the ocean and on the coral reef. She explains about scuba diving. She talks to the kids about not touching stuff in the ocean, keeping trash out of the ocean. It's imaginative and fun. But, I only gave it 4 stars because, I think she should have stuck to the topic of fish- instead she goes on a bit about how she doesn't eat fish and that she is a vegetarian and loves to eat fruits and veggies, especially broccoli and spinach. As a mom I am all for eating healthy and eating fruits and veggies, but really, did ""I don't eat fish- I am a vegetarian"" HAVE to be in a video for 2-6 yrs old kids? no.",1363392000,,828,4.024242424242424
