4829891,5,B005LQAM56,"Rien  dclarer or, as translated, Nothing To Declare is an outstanding and extremely enjoyable comedy.

It's the early days of the EU.

With the Treaty of Maastricht approved, Brussels has announced the dropping of barriers and the opening of free trade zones. And means that fixed border posts will no longer exist; people whose jobs, livelihoods, and homes that rely on those postings are going to be obsolete. In 'Declare' we follow two guards facing an uncertain future, one each from the Belgian-French border.

The Belgian guard, Rubn, is an ultra nationalist and certified Franco-hater. He detests anything French. He can't stand the sight of them, can't listen to them, can't see them without seeing blood red. He can't even drink water that comes from just across the imaginary boundary because it tastes 'wrong'.

Under the guise of protecting his beloved country, Rubn's sole enjoyment in life is making the lives of French commuters and businesses as unpleasant as possible; taking an inordinate amount of time to inspect, question, and re-inspect every single vehicle and passenger that crosses his post, much to the chagrin of his French counterparts who have to endure his incessant jibes and insults. Not to mention the daily backlog of angry and frustrated commuters on their side of the post who can only complain to them about their suffering.

His French counterpart is Mathias. A very decent guy who, unfortunately, has fallen deeply in love with Rubn's cute sister. To say he's not a fan of Rubn would be an astounding understatement. But he consistently stops himself from striking back at the pompous jackass because Louise has told him in no uncertain terms: She won't accept him as her husband if her family refuses his advances. Without their approval - the engagement is off.

As the time comes for the closing of their guard post, a new policing force has been proposed to save their jobs. A mixed Belgian-French contingent is to be assigned as a roaming patrol; spot checking the backroads and countryside between the shared borderland. Their goal - prevent the smuggling of illegal drugs and weapons. If the test works, then they will have a means of saving their jobs and homes in the small village of 'No Man's Land'.

Two officers will make up the test team. The Belgian contingent has already selected Rubn. They need a French volunteer. Mathias is determined that he won't lose Louise - and if that means kissing up and groveling to her ber-nationalist bombastic brother - then that's what he's going to do.

He raises his hand.

As the pair begins their work, and without realizing it, Rubn slowly begins to see Mathias as something other than a human termite.

Quietly, and without trying, he begins to respect the Frenchman for his skills as a fellow officer with the true heart of a regular guy, someone he can even call a friend. But is it enough to bridge the gap for his sister's hand?

A hilarious film that I've already put down as a future purchase.

Personal Note: Ambu-bu-lance. BWAHAHAHAHA! X-D",1325721600,,3042,4.883495145631068
4829892,4,B005LQAM56,"I saw this movie on a flight back from Europe and thoroughly enjoyed it. This comedy is reminiscent of the original ""Pink Panther"" movies with Peter Sellers, although it's not about a bumbling police officer but a French-hating Belgian Customs official (Ruben) coming to terms with the dissolution of border crossings in Europe with the formation of the European Union and the fact that his sister is secretly dating a French Customs official (Mathias).

After his priest tells him he'll go to hell for his French-hating attitude, Ruben tries to get along with his French counterparts on the other side of the border, even teaming up with Mathias (whose ulterior motive is to get Ruben to like him so he can openly date Ruben's sister) to form a joint mobile Customs patrol, which tries to track down and catch some bumbling drug smugglers. However, the entire budget for the joint operation went to purchase a beater of a car that can barely run and is no match for the drug smugglers. After a futile chase, Ruben and Mathias damage the car and are told they will have to pay for the repairs themselves. Ruben's former partner on the Belgian side tells them his brother can fix the car, which he does in pimp-my-ride fashion. With a now souped-up ride, Ruben and Mathias score more successes and appear to be getting along swimmingly until Ruben finds out Mathias is dating his sister. Delicious Pink Panther-like mayhem ensues.

I bought the Blu-Ray version but was hoping there would be a Region 1 version of the DVD available because I know several people who would love this movie and it would make a great gift. So producers, if you're listening, please release a Region 1 version!",1321228800,4,1687,4.7542662116040955

8478397,5,B005LQAM56,"On  Jan 1, 1993, EU member states eliminate regular border controls between their countries forming a European common market. For the Belgian customs officer, patriot and francophobe, Ruben Vandevoorde (Benot Poelvoorde), this unspeakable act paves the way for the dreaded ""Camenberts"" (as he calls the French) to overrun his beloved Begium. After one too many overtly anti-French displays of behavior, Vandevoorde must pair up with his French counterpart, Mathias Ducatel (Dany Boon). Mathias, who is in love and having a secret affair with Vandevoorde's sister, Louise (Julie Bernard), pledges to her to do his best to make the team work, while Vandevoorde does the opposite. On top of the funny mishaps the Franco-Belgium customs team encounters and the vain attempts of Ducatel to work with uncooperative Vandevoorde and yet keep his affair with Louise secret, are the hilariously hapless drug traffickers who try to profit from the new lack of border controls. Definitely enjoyable watching...if you don't mind reading subtitles. It is totally worth it, even if you have had little (or no) high school / college French.",1357084800,6,1124,5.314606741573034
