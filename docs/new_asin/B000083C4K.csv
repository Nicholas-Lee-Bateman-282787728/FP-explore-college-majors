7978666,5,B000083C4K,"This anime features characters from the Captain Harlock manga series in an unusual setting: the wild west. Tochiro, a Japanese samurai, is seeking to find the reminder of his people who are persecuted in the wild west. In this time, Japanese people are persecuted more than indians and little is understood about them. There's many undertones of racism which keeps a serious streak to the anime.

Very good stuff, must recommend. Don't expect high quality animation or accurate dubbing though :P

Rating 16 and up: (violence, violence against women, nudity, profanity, sexual situations, ethnic sterotypes, toilet humor, alcohol and tobacco use).",1125964800,2,646,5.3861386138613865
7978667,5,B000083C4K,"Ignore the one prior bad review of this anime.  The author of that review is ignorant about harlock history.  According to Animeigo the characters Harlock and Tochiro first appeared in a western manga called Gun Frontier which was later the base for this 2002 anime series.  Also according to Arcadia of My Youth Harlock's and Tochiro's ancestors keep running into each other and becoming friends.  For example in my favorite part of AoMY, Phantom F. Harlock II and Tochiro's ancestor save each other lives in WWII.  Now this ancestor of Harlock is named Franklin Harlock Jr. and has two scars on his face instead of one.  Anyway, I love this anime it is funny.  If you liked the two episodes in Cosmo Warrior zero that take place in the Gun Frontier (that one on the planet Heavy Melder not the same as this one on Earth) You'll love this anime.  Warning however, unlike other harlock flixs this one is more for adults than kids.  There seems to be a naked girl in every episode or at least on the first DVD.",1070582400,3,1009,4.530386740331492
7978668,4,B000083C4K,"The ""Gun Frontier"" series recasts the eternal friendship between Harlock and Toichiro in a western setting that's like nothing else in Leiji Matsumoto's ""Leijiverse.""  But if you've seen the ""extra"" episode of ""Cosmo Warrior Zero,"" you'll have an idea of the offbeat hijinks in store in this 13-episode series.
The story ostensibly concerns Toichiro and Harlock's search for a group of Japanese immigrants in a very Japanese take on the Old West.  What really makes this series interesting is that the hero is not Harlock, but Toichiro.  A Japanese samurai, Toichiro (who seems to get shot in every episode) swings his katana and cuts a swath through the wild West like Miyamoto Musashi.  Meanwhile Harlock -- one of the greatest characters in the history of manga/anime -- hangs back and plays the sidekick!
Harlock's low key goofiness (when Toichiro spots a woman in the first episode Harlock, without even looking, asks: ""Is she pretty?  Is she naked?"") really carries the series -- even in the second-banana role, he has more to do here than he did in ""Harlock Saga.""
There's lots of Matsumotoesque talk about real men weeping copious tears, lots of fanservice nudity, plenty of action, and something rare in a Matsumoto story -- comedy.  Recommended for fans.  Newcomers to Harlock would be better of with Animeigo's upcoming release of ""My Youth in Arcadia.""",1067558400,3,1364,5.035555555555556
7978669,4,B000083C4K,"I'm sorry but the guy below me seems to be a bit ignorant.  This anime was not just invented recently.  It is based on one of Leji Matsumoto's mangas that is also named Gun Frontier.  In fact, I believe its one of the earliest of his career.  Yes, this manga included a pirate turned cowboy named Franklin Harlock and a traveling samurai named Tochiro.  Leji has a habit of using his most beloved characters in many different unconnected stories.  This story, in particular takes place in the old west.  The main character here is really Tochiro.  Hes a Japanese, master swords-man, whos on a quest to find out what happened to his tribe that had settled in a colony out in the west and later vanished.  He is joined on his quest by his best buddy Harlock and later by Sinunora, an atractive girl who's intentions are unknown. The plot is serious, but there is plenty of light comedy included aswell, which is a contrast to the pretty straight space operas Leji Matsumoto is known for.  I don't know if this is the best translations of Matsumoto's work compared to his other animes.  However, if you like westerns and are a fan of Leji Matsumoto and his characters, I definantly suggest picking this up.",1067385600,3,1203,4.574766355140187
7978670,1,B000083C4K,"For Harlock fans, I'm sorry to report that this series leaves much to be desired. Besides making up an entirely new setting out of left field (these former future-era Space Pirates are now.... cowboys in the old west??), we're treated to versions of Harlock and Tochiro that don't seem anything like the characters portrayed in the original SPACE PIRATE CAPTAIN HARLOCK series or the movie ARCADIA OF MY YOUTH. T&A plays into the series far too much (something never EVER present in Harlock series), and all in all, it just feels like you're watching an entirely unrelated anime, with characters who just look exactly like Harlock and Tochiro. None of the nobility is there, and none of the drama. On top of all this, it's simply not very entertaining. To Harlock loyalists, this may be a must have, but don't expect it to be a joy to watch.",1066608000,,841,4.6891891891891895
