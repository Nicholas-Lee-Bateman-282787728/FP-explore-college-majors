8712132,5,B00W4VDSFW,Great acting by Will Chase. He should be in more movies.,1461542400,,56,4.181818181818182
8712133,5,B00W4VDSFW,"As you walk on a beach strewn with pebbles, your eye notices an unusual stone.
You pick it up.
Look at it through a ray of light, and then, to your amazement, you recognize this ""stone"" is actually a diamond.

Butterflies of Bill Baker in one such diamond.

If, only tentpoles with hundred million dollar budget interests you, then, this movie is not for you.

This is a masterclass in low/no budget movie making.
It's a thriller no doubt.
A very good one at that.

But, what I liked was the subtle, nuanced philosophy:
What stops you from being you?
What do you fear?
What do you do about it?
What if, a sliver of an opportunity for redemption is given?
Do you grab it or does your fear grab you?

In each of our lives, we face these questions.
And our current state as to where we are is a direct consequence of those questions.

Watch the movie and tell me you differ.

8712134,5,B00W4VDSFW,"What a wonderful film. Great acting by Will Chase. He should be in many more movies. And kudos to Sania Jhankar, a director to look out for. She should be directing a lot of movies. The film had such an interesting plot. Kept me hooked right till the end.",1435622400,,255,4.224489795918367
8712135,5,B00W4VDSFW,A much better film than so many other films that we see in cinemas and on TV. Sania Jhankar is a director to look out for. Very inspired by the story of this producer-director duo. A great addition to the list of super cool female filmmakers. Everything about the film was top-notch. Will Chase is mighty impressive.,1435622400,,316,4.56140350877193
8712136,5,B00W4VDSFW,"This is a terrific independent film--well acted and directed.  Will Chase plays Bill Baker, a handsome man with a sleep disorder that has never really been successfully treated.  His mystery builds slowly, while you're not paying attention to it, and then finally, it's upon you like a beast.  If you've ever seen an airplane suddenly nose dive onto an aircraft carrier, that's what the ending of Bill Baker feels like.  Nashville's Will Chase has the shoulders to carry this film.",1433721600,,481,4.975
8712137,5,B00W4VDSFW,Butterflies of Bill Baker keeps you guessing until the end.  Beautiful cinematography and wonderful performances all around.  A heartwarming story with aspects of a thriller.  The combination of these elements makes for a unique experience and quite a directorial debut for Sania Jhankar.  Producer Reema Dutt and team should be most excited to say that their work has pushed a female director/producer duo just another step forward!  I look forward to seeing what is next for them.,1433289600,,482,5.207792207792208
8712138,5,B00W4VDSFW,"Butterflies of Bill Baker weaves a captivating plot while the main character is dealing some pretty dark stuff (violent nightmares, divorce, mental diseases). Even through the dark content, the film maintains a air of fun and optimism which I would attribute to the talented cast and of course the vintage cars  which are worth watching the film for alone!",1431993600,,356,5.033898305084746
8712139,4,B00W4VDSFW,Saw this film at the Brooklyn Girl Film Festival - loved it! The director has a great aesthetic and sensibility for telling compelling stories.  Looking forward to getting the DVD and checking out the bonus features this time around!,1430956800,,233,4.9743589743589745
8712140,5,B00W4VDSFW,"As a big fan and supporter of the indie film industry, I truly enjoyed watching this film at the Manhattan Film Festival.  All the performances were top-notch, notably by Will Chase. I also remember reading about the director-producer duo and love seeing female filmmakers and entrepreneurs achieving such great feats. It's really inspiring to see such young talent, who met at NYU doing great things for an industry that really needs to be revived.  I hope we see more films like this in the coming years!",1430870400,,506,4.872093023255814
