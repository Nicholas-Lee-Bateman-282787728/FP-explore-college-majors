3730532,2,B001OLTV1S,"Very disappointing in many ways. DVD-wise, it is not a very long video and there are no extras. More important, the video quality is pretty poor. In addition, there are not many songs that are performed together, mostly just some song sets independently done by one or the other. They do have a very satisfying synergy when performing together, there just isn't much of that here. Billy Joel in particular seems to be very disengaged. I have seen several other Billy Joel performances that had a lot more energy.",1264982400,4,512,4.764044943820225
3730533,2,B001OLTV1S,I went to this concert when they were in town.  So I was really looking forward to getting this DVD.  You can imagine my disappointment to find out this is an obviously pirated video.  The film quality is grainy and the television station logo is in the lower right hand corner.  The sellers should be ashamed.  I'll be turning over my copy to the police.,1443225600,,355,4.4

3730536,1,B001OLTV1S,"Shame on Amazon for selling this at all, let alone with a $30.00 price tag.  It is obvious,  right down to the bug on the video, that someone taped this off TV or cable and mass copied it.  It has no copyright for Joel or John's companies, the case art is misspelled, and Amazon should be ashamed.  I am sending this back immediately.  Maybe Jeff Bezos should ask his newspaper to investigate DVD bootleg fraud like this.  He sure isn't paying attention to his company.",1432252800,,469,4.458823529411765

3730538,2,B001OLTV1S,These guys are great together but the actually quality of the picture is sub par. Maybe I should not have expected more from a DVD that was recorded that long ago.,1430697600,,163,4.290322580645161

3730543,1,B001OLTV1S,Video quality is equivalent to someone recording with a 1982 camcorder and then rerecording it like 10 times on a VCR. Embarrassing. Should removed from the market.,1395532800,,164,5.111111111111111
3730544,1,B001OLTV1S,"Was VERY disappointed with this DVD. I love Elton & Billy Joel and we have been toseveralof their concerts. They arefantastic, Wish I could say the same for this DVD. The quality and sound are terrible. A total waste of my money. It turned out to be the worst DVD that we have ever purchased. It was such bad quality that I trashed it after listening to it and I have NEVER done that, before. My husband and I aremusic buffs of almost all genres of music and this one was horrible!!!

NO, I would not recommend this DVD to anyone, anytime!",1395532800,,539,4.284313725490196

3730546,3,B001OLTV1S,"This dvd is old and not re-mastered therefore the quality, even when played on Blu-ray is poor. If you love Billy Joel and Elton John the quality will not matter to you. I did see them on this concert tour when they came to the states. I was particularly amused at the difference between the American audience of which I was a part, and the Japanese - not only in behavior, but how they come dressed to an event such as this.",1391040000,,425,4.195121951219512

3730549,1,B001OLTV1S,"This concert is the 1998 tour. The product description indicated the release date was 2012 and the photo is clearly a more recent photo of the artists so I thought it would be a more recent concert. It is apparent that it predates digital photography. The video quality is very poor. I have vhs tapes that look better than this dvd. Sadly, it is not worth the money. But Billy Joel and Elton John are still amazing.",1375747200,7,415,4.402597402597403
3730550,1,B001OLTV1S,"It says 2009, but Billy Joel is nearly bald now (2013). My advice is to look away and just listen to the music. POOR quality filming!",1375315200,,133,4.153846153846154
3730551,1,B001OLTV1S,There are not enough of adjectives to articulate what a piece of crap this DVD is.  Given the fact that most the people who purchased this DVD had the same observation I wonder why this vendor keeps selling it.,1373328000,2,210,4.384615384615385
3730552,1,B001OLTV1S,I'm afraid I can't recommend this video to anyone. It is the worst video quality I have ever viewed..looks like a pirated copy of someone's old VHS video. Definitely not worth what I paid for it.,1372464000,2,195,4.444444444444445
3730553,2,B001OLTV1S,The sound was fine - and I enjoyed the music - but the picture quality (in a word) sucked.  I found myself wondering if this was a bootlegged DVD.  Surely Billy Joel and Elton John would not have signed off on distributing such low-quality work.,1368144000,,245,4.4222222222222225
3730554,1,B001OLTV1S,"I just got this in the mail. The quality was HORRIBLE. I never write bad reviews but I have seen better
on youtube. There are much better quality DVD of this show. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
SAVE YOUR MONEY. I'M SO SORRY TO HAVE TO WRITE THIS",1366761600,8,236,4.1521739130434785
3730555,2,B001OLTV1S,"I missed this concert when they came through my town, so I was happy to find it on Amazon, and get to watch it.

1)  The DVD mainly focuses on Billy Joel, and Elton doesn't get shown doing some of his more classic songs.

2)  The video almost seems like it was shot with a camcorder by someone there at the concert.  The quality was so-so in my opinion.

I really like Elton and Billy's music, so I'm not sorry about making the purchase, just wish the quality was better, and reflected the actual concert more closely; Billy and Elton sharing more equal time on the DVD.",1362441600,,570,4.280373831775701
3730556,5,B001OLTV1S,What can i say these two artist are 2 of my favorite singers growing up! Amazon comes through again i never got to see both of these guys together so this concert will show me what i missed! Thanks Amazon for getting me introduced to Red Market! They did a great speedy job getting me this great concert. Im sure Ill watch this over and over.,1355875200,,342,4.196969696969697
3730557,3,B001OLTV1S,"ELTON JUST SINGS A FEW DUETS WITH BILLY...NOT FROM THEIR FAMOUS DUAL CONCERT PERIOD. HIGHLIGHT-JOEL SINGING A SONG ELTON REFUSES TO SING LIVE ANYMORE...(WHY???) CANDLE IN THE WIND, POOR CINEMATOGRAPHY, DECENT SOUND...WATCH JOEL TEASE AND JUGGLE A STANDING MICROPHONE LIKE NO OTHER. HOPE A REAL DUAL CONCERT DVD IS RELEASED!",1354924800,,323,5.48
3730558,2,B001OLTV1S,"Do not consider this item!  The sound is very poor...muffled.  Additionally, poor picture quality.  I am disappointed in this product.  Would LOVE to return it for my money back!",1354406400,,178,5.0344827586206895
3730559,5,B001OLTV1S,This was a great concert from two great performers. I wonder why they never got together in the states and do it here? Maybe they did but never recorded?,1346112000,,153,4.310344827586207
3730560,3,B001OLTV1S,"Granted, the picture quality is pretty amateurish and it really skimps on the Elton John songs, but the Piano Men Live in Tokyo, as far as concert DVD's go is not bad. Full of all the Billy Joel segments from their 1998 Tokyo Face to Face concert, it features from songs you don't hear Billy sing in concert anymore (The Stranger, Just the Way You Are), Billy singing a cover of Elton's ""Candle in the Wind"" (during the time when he wasn't singing the song anymore), and the two of them performing ""Your Song"", ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"", ""My Life"" (with Elton in a Godzilla mask and Billy trying to keep a straight face; one of the highlights), ""The Bitch is Back"", ""You May Be Right"", and of course ""Piano Man"" together. While only 77 minutes long, it does capture the highlights of their concert together and does include all the Billy Joel performances from the show. It would be nice to have seen some of Elton's solo performances, but highly recommended for Billy Joel fans, and if you can get past the poor picture quality, the audio on the other hand is very impressive. Definitely worth the $5 I paid for it.",1321660800,2,1124,4.434782608695652
3730561,1,B001OLTV1S,"Good Lord, I must have not read these reviews before I bought this piece of junk. It appears to be a bad (Chinese?) bootleg, labeled as an Argentine product. The concert is ancient, the cover photo is unrelated to the content, the quality is unbelievably bad, and it is a total ripoff. We watched maybe 90 seconds before yanking it out of the player. This seller should be banned from Amazon.",1314576000,11,392,4.535211267605634
3730562,2,B001OLTV1S,I have been looking for their concert in DVD for years.... have seen them live 6 times through the years and the T-shirts and memories is all I've got!!  Don't they know how much $$$ they could make by coming out with the real DVD??  I am still hopeful that they will tour back and will finally release the DVD like all other artists!,1312588800,,334,4.203125
3730563,1,B001OLTV1S,"Several of the previous reviewers said it very well.  This video is absolute JUNK!  As one who collects concert DVD's, such as The Eagles, Tina Turner, Phil Collins, and more...I truly enjoy great performance DVD's.  This one is a horrible waste of your time and money.  The video quality is so bad, it must have been copied from some 4th or 5th generation bootleg analog tape.  The sound quality is acceptable...but just barely.  In summary: 1.) Horrible video quality.  2.) Horrible editing. 3.) It's extremely short for a 2-act concert (75 minutes total) which tells me the video has less than half of the actual concert.  4.) The back of the DVD was likely created by a non-English speaking person as there are at least two (2) mis-spelled song titles (""The satranger""...really??) and the punctuation is incorrect.  The fine-print indicates the DVD was produced by a company in Argentina.  Anyway, I hope I've save someone their hard-earned money...and prevented this Argentinian company from ripping off others.  Lastly, as another reviewer mentioned, the picture on the cover is Elton & Billy in 2009; the concert was in 1998. Rip-off!!",1297900800,13,1142,5.0212765957446805
3730564,3,B001OLTV1S,"This is an obvious import bootleg with the bootlegger's or TV broadcast letters ""BWF"" in the bottom right corner throughout the video. This was probably taken from a Japanese TV broadcast and the quality almost looks like someone filmed a TV monitor or used a generated VHS source instead of using a high quality TV signal.

Still, the performances were very good and until something better comes along from an official source then this is ""good enough"" considering that it cost me less than 7 bucks for 77+ minutes of enjoyable music.

The other reviewers are correct about the removal of all Elton John solo performances as this only has 3 Elton songs (""Your Song"", ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"" and ""The Bitch is Back"") which are performed by both musicians together at the beginning and end of the video.",1296345600,2,812,4.671328671328672
3730565,1,B001OLTV1S,"This dvd is very poor quality.  We turned it off after 20 minutes.
What can I do with this product?",1291334400,,99,3.95
3730566,1,B001OLTV1S,"Had I known the quality of this dvd, I would not have purchased it.

I attended the Face to Face concert earlier this year.  It lasted 3 hours.  This dvd is 70 minutes.
I purchased it thinking the front cover was true.  It is a current picture.  It is not what is on
the video.  The video has to be 20 years old, which would be ok if they had included the entire concert.
Why was Elton John's solo part not included?

Very dissappointing.",1286668800,8,438,4.142857142857143
3730567,3,B001OLTV1S,"The DVD arrived in a mailing bag and not a mailing box (though it did have a dvd box) so it was not protected very well.  The dvd had fallen out of the thing it snaps into and was sliding around in the dvd box and had some scratches, although this did not affect the dvd performance.  It's weird that the photos on the cover seem much more recent than the concert.  It was obvious that parts had been cut out, and I would have liked to have the longer version.  Also, Elton John sang only a few songs-I seem to remember now that I had heard that he had laryngitis or some other throat problem when this concert was touring.  Billy Joel was fantastic as usual and he does wonderfully singing Elton's songs. Overall good buy for the money.",1282608000,,737,4.235714285714286
3730568,1,B001OLTV1S,"in the full concert they open together, both sing seperate and then close together. this edited version cuts out all of elton johns solo songs. i was very disapointed.",1274659200,23,167,4.793103448275862
3730569,3,B001OLTV1S,"I thought that I had already written a review for this product...but I guess that it did not go through the first time: /

Well, I bought this DVD thinking that it was a recent concert of Elton John and Billy Joel...especially since the back cover said that it was made in 2009.

However, turned out that the concert is from 1988-1990 or somewhere around there, so I was very disappointed.

Also, there was scant performance by Elton John; miost of it was Billy Joel performing...since I had mainly bought the DVD to watch Elton John perform I was disappointed about that. (The front cover of this DVD is very deceiving, as it shows a recent picture of Elton and Billy performing together, leading potential buyers to think that it will be a recent concert.

The footage itself was obviously not filmed by professionals...the slicing between songs and angle of camera during performances was poor.

If I had known that the concert was so old, and that Elton John was not going to be shown very much in it, I never would have bought the DVD.

Still, I gave this DVD three stars, because taking into account what there was, Billy Joel did put on a good performance.",1271116800,25,1163,4.5673076923076925
3730570,1,B001OLTV1S,"I review this dvd as alleviate those who want to find a dvd/blu-ray of their concert...

Bought this dvd hoping that they'd release a blu-ray or a new dvd of their recent 2009 tour which we enjoyed late in the year, and to my disappointment, this doesnt work for me.

Visually - this one has one if not the worst ive seen. It appears to be a transfer from an analog source (may it be VHS or Beta), its sad to even see this on dvd. Heck i can do better with a camcorder.

Audio tho - this probably was the only redeeming part for me. Its not the best im sure i can tell you that, but i am trying my best to 'look on the bright side'.

It will work as a great cd, turning off your display and well, enjoy what its worth.

But it aint gonna be more than 15 bucks in my book.
