8717774,5,B00YASQU4I,"I grew up being told this was Shakespeare's worst play and so I never read it or saw it. I'm almost glad because this play is so GOOD.

Way underrated, and this version is perfect. The blend between Roman history, Elizabethan history, and modern theater productions is just great and this play is so dark but good.",1480896000,2,314,4.508771929824562
8717775,5,B00YASQU4I,Watched this straightaway. It is a good Titus. It is lively and entertaining. It is like the Julie Taymor Titus but on stage.,1460073600,2,125,4.478260869565218
8717776,1,B00YASQU4I,"Please do not waste your money on this embarrassment. TITUS requires great acting, of which there is none,
and  visionary intelligent direction, of which there is less than none. Laurence Oliver and Vivien Leigh made a hit
of it; that should tell you something.",1458518400,3,261,4.931818181818182
8717777,5,B00YASQU4I,"The play is brutal, yet so much of the production is delicate. We were lucky enough to be in London that summer, so we saw it live. The tension between humor and horror, madness and reason is palpable, especially in the character of Titus. Bailey does an amazing job of making the audience part of the proceedings; in fact, that's mainly what I wrote about on my blog (https://stevesofgrass.wordpress.com/2015/07/24/shakespeares-titus-andronicus-shakespeares-globe-london/).
The DVD does a pretty good job of catching the experience, though I wish they had followed the Beastie Boys' lead in giving some handheld cameras to audience members and stitching together the film from the collected footage. As I noted above, so much of the play was immersive, and we get only a hint of that on the screen.",1446422400,,799,5.2015503875969
