8195708,5,B000QCUZO8,Awesome!! A powerful statement on the culture of Brazil and the young girls who beat the drums.  I would highly recommend this for anyone who is interested in the full cultural aspects of the country.  -Dee Carr,1411862400,,211,4.675675675675675
8195709,5,B000QCUZO8,"I love this documentary, the music in it is amazing and the culture is so rich and beautiful. I would highly recommended anyone interested in different cultures and traditions to check this dvd out, I absolutely love the music and I play it over and over.. The DVD does not have a lot of features and it's only 30mins, although the original documentary is about 45 mins long but it is worth it anyway.",1200009600,6,401,4.4324324324324325
