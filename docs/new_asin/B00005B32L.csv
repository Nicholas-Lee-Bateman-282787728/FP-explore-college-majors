7936572,1,B00005B32L,"It is hard to believe that anyone could make M&aacute;laga Spain look so positively revolting, but somehow Jess Franco manages with no difficulty whatsoever in ""Lust for Frankenstein,"" possibly his worst film (it's certainly worse than my previous least-favorite Franco entry, ""Mari-Cookie and the Killer Tarantula."") The film is stylistically obviously a Franco production from the outset, beginning with a terrible credit sequence that, in part, explains that this film was partially backed by the University of M&aacute;laga. I sure am glad Spain had money to spend on this. The introduction explains that Dr. Frankenstein (here played as a ghost unconventionally by long-haired Carlos Subterfuge) was just a misunderstood guy, and through an incoherent and very longwinded voiceover sets up the plot for his daughter Moira (Lina Romay) to avenge him. The film stars Romay and Michelle Bauer, both of whom are well past their cinematic expiration date and who are definitely showing their age.

I would explain the action, except that it's nonsensical and the sound is so poor that it is frequently impossible to understand what's being said, not that it matters much anyway (this is not aided by the intermittent electronic voice processing, which turns a merely dirty soundtrack into mud.) The sound is so garbled that I would like to view it as a deliberate artistic choice, but frankly I suspect it's just cheaply made and poorly executed. As if the dialogue wasn't painful enough, the music is supremely lame metal from The Ubangis (who appear courtesy of Trash Palace.)

The movie takes 1% flimsy premise and adds 99% padding, and pretends to be an erotic-comedy-horror piece. In reality the people are grossly unattractive, the story is wholly uncompelling (though I do give Franco credit for a completely different take on the Frankenstein myth) and the final result is not only not erotic, it's absolutely repellant. It is not especially graphic in any way, although it is cheap and tawdry if that's your thing. The effects are horrible, and the laboratory set would make Ed Wood blush from acute embarrassment. In the end ""Lust for Frankenstein"" is all nonsensical lust (albeit of a variety that would fail to titillate even the most hormonal middle school boy) with zero payoff: it is nearly insufferable, and even veteran fans of garbage cinema would be well advised to steer clear of this train wreck.",1345334400,3,2417,5.116455696202531
7936573,1,B00005B32L,"The women on the cover are NOT in the movie. If they are it is very brief because I seem to have missed it. The main character is not sexy. She is probably in her 50's and has skinny legs, no ass and a bit of a tummy, if that's what you like then maybe you'll like this. I found myself questioning if I should even finish watching it or just turn it off.",1316390400,,354,3.7972972972972974
7936574,1,B00005B32L,"Made in 1996 this was one of Jess Franco's last movies and one of his worst.  His wife is the ""seahag"" and while she may be beautiful to Jess she is not to movie viewers. No plot, cheesy music ,unattractive women, there is nothing to recommend this movie.  If this is the best Mr. Franco can do now he should rest on his laurels.",1221177600,,329,4.125
7936575,4,B00005B32L,"Okay.  This is not a Hammer horror film.  This is Jess Franco territory.  If you hate Franco, stay away.  It should be pretty obvious by now, 175 or 180 films after his first one, that he's not going to change his style for you.  You either like him or you hate him.  Cringing in abhorent distaste and writing hyperbolic reviews of his films being the worst in the world are not going to make anyone take his camera away from him nor will it change anyone else mind about him or his films.  The mass army of Franco haters has never made a dent in the loyal of his fans and curious admirers.
I'm not going to be simplistic and say that people who hate Franco films just don't ""get it.""  There's nothing to get here.  In LUST FOR FRANKENSTEIN Franco has created a surreal world in which a beautiful Frankenstein monster (Michelle Bauer, the monster on the sleeve and in the movie) wrecks havoc on the life of Frankenstein's plain-Jane daughter (Lina Romay).  A bunch of beautiful victims litter the trail of the monster's murderous path from opening scene to the finale.  Super sexy Amber Newman is a beautiful stripper who gets stripped of more than just her costume, Frankenstein's daughter surgically transfers her life juices into the monster. (Amber's on the cover and in the movie too, by the way.)  It's not High Art time, folks, it's just plain FRANCO.
If you like watching European horror films that are throwbacks to the nasty days of the '70s and early '80s, then LUST FOR FRANKENSTEIN is for you.  The girls are plenty and there's a blonde, a brunette, a redhead, etc.  There's skinny ones, fat ones, bodacious ones, etc.  It's all here.  And where else can you find a stark naked Frankenstein monster who looks like Michelle Bauer?  It's exploitation to the hilt.  Open-minded fun seekers rush to place your orders!  All others should just look somewhere else much safer to spend your dollars.
Don't let the simplistic critics scare you.  I'm not saying this is a great film but it is certainly enjoyable if you are in the right frame of mind.  (And where else can you see a female monster make love to a tree?)
Try it, you'll like it.",1050624000,14,2146,4.550913838120104
7936576,1,B00005B32L,"After 30 something years of watching terrible movies, I have finally found it, the world's worst movie. Move over Plan 9 from Outer Space, you've been dethroned. But while Plan 9 is enjoyable, Lust for Frankenstein certainly is not.
I can sit through anything, but this was painful. I kept watching it, because I bought it, but I just wanted it to get over with. It's now back in the DVD case, never to see the light of day again.
I wish I could give this movie any positive comment, but I can't, it's just awful. The Euro-goth metal soundtrack is puddy to the ears, there is absolutly NO plot, the hot chicks on the cover are nowhere to be seen, the nude scenes will make you wretch. For all the nudity this movie has, there is nothing that even a 13 year old boy would get excited over.
My wife best described this movie as she tried to watch it ""This isn't a head-scratcher, it's a <backside> scratcher!""
Please people hear me. AVOID this movie at all costs. I will never ever ever watch this again!",1032652800,5,1002,4.363636363636363
7936577,1,B00005B32L,"I have one other Jesus Franco film with Lina Romay starring in it (Ilsa/Greta/Wanda The Wicked Warden/Mad Butcher), and in it she is young and beautiful. That film was made circa 1977, and some 25+ years later here she is in Franco's Lust For Frankenstein. I don't believe anybody who buys Franco films is hoping to see a woman in her mid-50's at youngest, complete with liverspots and vericose veins, expose herself and have love scenes. Please, if you have any common sense, stay away from this movie. I wonder if the late Soledad Miranda (Franco starlette/lover who died young) would be still doing movies if she were alive.....",1021161600,2,631,4.798165137614679
7936578,1,B00005B32L,"Those people (like me) who buy Jesus Franco's movies don't expect high art or even much plot for that matter.  However, I don't know what he was thinking about here.  I love the kinkiness and nudity of most Franco movies, as well as the occasional kinky night club act scenes and music.  This movie fails to capture any of that.  So what does that leave?  Not much and I sincerely wish that I could get my money back for this one.  Thank you very much.",1002844800,6,452,4.258823529411765

NOW THAT IS JUST NASTY.scarred breasts are the equivalent of army boot stew.just plain old nasty.this movie didn't have much else to push it so i must say that those looking for pretty women,go elsewhere.and if you're looking for a good horror movie,shame on you for looking here.",1001808000,4,684,5.2272727272727275
