6472914,5,B00L6AW0M4,"Back in 2012, I reviewed a movie titled THE DEAD, which had gotten critical acclaim around the world.  In my review, I mentioned the ending of that movie and how it was a bit confusing; I also wondered if a sequel was in the works.  Happily, there was.  THE DEAD 2 arrives on store shelves today, and it is a phenomenal followup to the original film.

The Ford Brothers are truly to be commended for what theyve created with this franchise.  These two films are as important to the zombie world as George Romero and Danny Boyle.  Full of scares and intensity, both of these films are definite must-sees for any fan of the genre.

Just like its predecessor, THE DEAD 2 is shot well and looks great onscreen.  Part of what makes the cinematography so effective is the backdrop against which the film is set:  India.  Bleak landscapes and poor cities within the country help create a true sense of fear inside of the film.  This atmospheric tension is carried throughout the whole picture and is a big chunk of what makes the film so good.

The acting is once again great as well.  I particularly like Joseph Millson in the lead role.  I am only slightly familiar with his work, however his performance in this film is enough to make me want to see more.

The special effects in THE DEAD 2 are excellent.  The filmmakers once again focus on making the zombies scary by their actions, not just what they look like.  Many films use zombie-gore as the primary way to scare the audience; the Ford brothers, on the other hand, make the zombies terrifying by what they do as well as how they look.  You have to watch the film to see what I mean.

THE DEAD 2 is a huge win for me, and I highly recommend giving it a look.  Fans of THE WALKING DEAD will definitely want to check this film out, as it is a nice diversion while waiting for season five to start next month.  THE DEAD 2 is in stores today in a variety of formats.",1410825600,7,1915,4.323033707865169
6472915,5,B00L6AW0M4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as well as the first one. The zombies are slow, but relentless and their makeup is done very well.  Additionally, if you are on the lookout for a zombie movie that has a lot of zombies, this is the movie for you.  There are zombies in a majority of the scenes.  It entertained me, it gave me the creeps and had me turning on lights.",1410393600,2,365,4.185714285714286
6472916,4,B00L6AW0M4,"Well I enjoyed the 1st movie the Ford Brothers did and bought it on blu ray.  This one is very similar to the first but in India and I like how it shows more of it developing in the city, not just starting out as an epidemic state like the 1st one.
If you are are zombie buff I would definitely recommend this one.  These guys do fantastic job with filming a high quality movie.
I'll purchase this one in blu ray too once it's available.
Taking place in India where there is a huge population of people you can imagine how many zombies in this one.
The plot I think is a little less interesting in this one but still a very good zombie flick.  These are the serious zombie movies not the dark comedy type.
Worth a watch...",1410048000,7,722,4.142857142857143

6472918,5,B00L6AW0M4,"Since I realize that several other reviewers have explained what this show is all about, I will just give you my opinion as to whether or not I found it enjoyable, which I certainly did! After viewing ""The Dead 1"", I was anxious to watch this follow-up video since I found the first movie quite entertaining. I was pleased to discover that this film far surpassed the other in action, location, and ""scareability""with an interesting plot that really held my interest through the entire show. Not at all like the typical, over done zombie movies, this had  originality with just the right amount of gore. I am so glad I purchased this video, it is one that I will surely want to view several times over. Hold on tight to your popcorn, and prepare to be entertained!",1487376000,4,764,4.576642335766423
6472919,4,B00L6AW0M4,"As a stand-alone I would probably have liked this film better than I did. But as the Ford brothers' follow-up to The Dead (Africa) I found it too similar, though it did have some harrowing scenes. It is a literal sequel in that the virus reaches India via a ship's crewman who was bitten in Somalia. Nicholas Burton, an American engineer is working on wind turbines in Rajasthan, northwest India. Escape becomes complicated because not only is he out in the field and away from Jaipur where Americans are being evacuated but needs to rescue his pregnant Indian girlfriend, 300 miles away in Mumbai. This sets the film up as a roadtrip with zombies much like the first film, only this time his impromptu companion is a young Indian orphan boy.

The movie was filmed in the part of Rajasthan known as The Land of the Kings. This is a vast, arid countryside with lots of rocks and stony ridges, few trees and a general orange-brown desert look. To the untrained eye (mine included) it looked almost interchangeable with the arid lands of Burkina Fasso where the first film was shot. Though I understand the opportunities for filming that a wide, empty landscape offers and appreciate the rugged beauty of the area, setting it in a very different climate such as southern India might have made it easier to tell the two movies apart. A great part of the first film was its novel setting but this film lessens the impact of that by being in such a similar place.

The use of non-actors is criticized here but I found them effective enough. It's the zombies who seem non-effective. They are mindbogglingly slow and have the same sideways wobble as their African counterparts but seem so much less threatening here. In Africa they seemed to be a bit quicker and more dangerous. Here, if you get yourself trapped in a small room with one door and there are lots of zombies outside, you just open the door and go out normally, just pushing the zombies away or brushing them aside. The zombies really need to be made to be scarier than this. Also, I know it's unfair to criticize zombie movies on reality-checks, but this is portrayed as a bite-spread infection not an airbourne virus. Yet it was brought to Mumbai by one person and is 300 miles away in a sparsely populated part of India the next day? Pretty unlikely. The film also has the usual zombie flick cliche of guns that seem to have unlimited ammo.

This does not mean there aren't some standout scenes like Nicholas' attempt to escape via a motorized paraglider; his girlfriend Ishani's questioning of all the religious beliefs she has learned from her Brahman father; or an unforgettable scene where Nicholas tries to help a woman and her child escape from a wrecked car. The ending gets mixed reactions from fans but that's all up to the viewer. There's still a lot of good in this film, including a terrific score by Imram Ahmed, enough to recommend it. I just wish it didn't feel so much like the first film.",1485043200,,2964,4.620493358633776

I liked the casting especially the young boy who guides Nicholas in India.  The zombies were a bit cheesey looking but no worse than any other zombie film I've seen. There were enough close encounters to make my heart race and isn't that one of the biggest reasons we watch these type of movies?  I'd definitely like to see more from the Ford Brothers.

 We now consider the Ford Brothers a force in modern Zombie movies after the successful production of their previous film The Dead.  I gave that one a strong two and a half brains for a vivorous effort that resulted in a watchable if not perfect film-and made with very little money on location in Africa.  In a sort of a continuation we switch across the Indian Ocean to India where a ship just in from Africa gives liberty to the crew.  One of the crew members doesn't look so good.  The pleasant, appropriate and original (in both senses of the word) score adds a lot to the enjoyment of the film.  In traditional horror film practice, when something bad is happening or about to happen, the music tells us to watch out.  But this score has a decidedly Indian aural flavor.
 Co-writers, co-directors Howard J. Ford and Jonathan Ford have crafted a tale that will appeal to Western and to Third World audiences.  The protagonist (well acted by Joseph Millson- good acting in a Zombie flick we always welcome and rare) has American citizenship and a tragic past but works in India as an electrical engineer installing a wind farm.  He falls for a local girl (Meena Mishra) and finds out just as the Zombie outbreak gathers enough steam to notice that she carries his baby.  The story unrolls as he must cross Zombie infested desert to join and protect her and the child to come.
 The Fords re-use a lot of the sort of thing they used in the first film.  We watch very slow moving Zombies shuffle around, necks at an angle.  They have crazy Zombie eyes, they show more or less realistic wounds here and there and we have no problem with them.  The slow movers give the living a chance to bull through them, run from them and generally elude them except in mobs.  They seem to like standing around their own, we see lots of them but not clumped together.  The inevitable munching scenes are realistic-ish without being overly gross or tongue in cheek.  One cool thing the directors put in involved an old lady Zombie with no teeth.  Very quick, just a few seconds, but what a spot for a Zombie to be in, no?
 The best thing, the thing I like the most, was the pervasive sense of menace that the film builds.  We have an emotional understanding of dread which we might will have in an actual outbreak.
 Overall the production values and particularly the cinematography I found quite good.  I am bumping up this film to three and a half brains, a full brain jump from the Ford brothers previous film.
 The Dead 2 wears an R rating for Zombie stuff.  I lasts for on hour and 38 minutes.
 With one movie filmed on location in Africa, another filmed in India, I wonder where the Ford Brothers will go next.",1435363200,,2719,4.462474645030426

6472948,3,B00L6AW0M4,"When a man returns to India from Somalia he comes back with a very vicious bite on one of his arms. He goes home and apparently dies from the attack. Later on, a group of flesh eating people are attacking others very aggressively; Nicolas (Joseph Millson), an engineer working far outside of the city witnesses an attack, and immediately he becomes worried about his girlfriend Ishani(Meenu Mishra) whom is currently in the city. He receives a call from a friend that the city is in chaos and chooses to head back there and save his girlfriend. -summary

When I saw the indie zombie film called The Dead (2010) directed by the Ford Brothers. I hailed it as one of the best zombie films I had seen in years for a variety of reasons. The film did a great job utilizing its atmosphere, themes, gore, zombie make up, characters, and most importantly its consistent tone. The Dead was a serious zombie film completely free of the comedy that has run rampant in the genre for far too long. When I heard about this sequel my interest was indeed piqued, and I wasted no time giving the Ford Brothers latest work a look. It's unfortunate at least for me anyway, that they weren't able to recapture all of the magic that made the original feel so special. The Dead 2 attempts to follow in the steps of its predecessor by being more than a zombie movie as it focuses on its themes of hope, isolation, friendship, and now love. Unfortunately it's too drama-filled, lacking some of that zombie action found in the original, and the characters are quite frankly, kind of boring.

The plot follows Nick as he attempts to journey 300 miles across hostile terrain to find Ishani; along the way he meets a boy by the name of Javed( Anand Krishna Goyal) who helps him in his travel. The two try to survive one zombie encounter after the other.

Despite my lack of enjoyment with this film; The Dead 2 really does plenty of things right. Nick is a character that took some time to grow on me, but after awhile I felt his plight. The themes are worked out through him very well as we learn the reason why he chooses to save this girl he doesn't know all that well. To include, feel his pain as he's put through some very difficult decisions. The film does a splendid job in working its horror through the zombie outbreak, by putting people in situations where there's simply no escape, and through these situations we learn that this is now a world where the rules are changing as they move along.

The barren out lands and locations work very well supporting the zombie terror, because the we know for a fact that Nick and Javed have only each other to rely on and they must use their wits to survive. The zombies work deep into the atmosphere in ways that really shouldn't be spoiled. I also thought it was brilliant to call into question one's religion in regards to the zombie outbreak, and this segment was written well enough to further enhance the film's story.

The main gripes that I have is that the only interesting character really is Nick, and I just didn't feel the others. I also think people's claims on the zombie carnage are greatly exaggerated. I really didn't think this movie was as gore-laden as the original, and let's be honest, we watch zombie movies to see people torn into shreds and see detailed vicious bites with that meat being ripped off the bones like fried chicken. I don't think this sequel measures up well enough in that category. Also, the plot hole, Nick appeared to have more ammo than he claimed.

The special effects are excellent in regards to the zombies make up. Once again, they look really well done and pretty frightening. They're dark in certain areas with the skin rotting on them. They're not on the same level as The Walking Dead, but I wouldn't want to encounter these things though. I can't really say the acting was an issue since I felt the performances and this is another area Nick stood out.

The Dead 2 is a great zombie movie when compared to most of the shovel-ware in this genre. However, it's too average when compared to the original. If you enjoyed the original then give this a shot, but I recommend coming in from a neutral point of view. After this outing, I won't say that I'm really looking forward to the Ford Brothers next zombie cuisine feature. Recommended if you really liked the original or just need a serious zombie fix.

Pros: Well use of its themes and overall atmosphere

Cons: Some characters came off uninteresting, needed more gore and zombie action",1432425600,,4513,4.554870530209618

Both films are very slow paced with the sequel being even more so.  If you prefer fast paced action you'll likely be nodding off before halfway through so be warned.

6472955,2,B00L6AW0M4,"Have been wanting to watch this movie for some time and finally got the opportunity - wish now I did not. Also good to see a zombie movie taking place outside the USA and see what another countries reactions would be - main draw to this movie. Movie started out OK enough. There is the stereo-typical American contractor in a foreign country (India) who just happens to be 300+ miles away from his Indian girlfriend (who happens to be pregnant). The American witnesses ""people"" attacking and killing a local farmer and notices other ""people"" shambling about aimlessly.

Switch back to the pregnant girls home where her mother had been bitten and is in the process of dying. All heck eventually breaks loose and the American is notified that he has a certain amount of time to make it to a certain airport for evacuation. He chooses his girlfriend instead and embarks on a 300 mile adventure.

Switch back to the slums where the girlfriend and family are. Mother is still slowly (painfully - no pun intended) dying. Father barricades home against attack. Father peaks out window and sees someone desperately begging for help who is mobbed by zombies and instantly is re-animated. Mother is still clinging to life.

Switch back to the American who makes it to a local gas station where his friend is killed by zombies. He finds a revolver and a box of about 20 bullets. The usual blast a zombie in the chest experimentation takes place until the guy discovers that shooting the head is the best answer.

Switch back to the slums and mom is still barely alive after clearly have been bitten DAYS before.

Back to the American who eventually finds a young boy; be-friends him; finds a motorcycle and later has it stolen; finds the motorcycle & thief being eaten; drives away on the motorcycle (wonder where the gas for it came from due to the distances that it has traveled); and eventually makes it to the slums and his girlfriend.

Throughout the American's adventures, the zombies were really not much of a threat. There would be scenes of the American just more-or-less casually walking through hoards of zombies without  any reaction from them; then there would be scenes where the American was running for his life from 1 or 2 zombies that were a considerable distance from him. Also, the American finds one of those parachutes that has a big propeller attached to it. Of course, it crashes, the American drops his revolver, miraculously escapes the zombies gnawing on his boot strings, and makes it to the slums.

Switch back to the girlfriends house and, clearly DAYS LATER, mother is STILL barely alive. Granted a zombie bite will affect each individual differently, but it did seem quite a long time for mother to finally turn when others are dying in the street and instantaneously turning within seconds.

Eventually the American arrives to save his girlfriend and MIRACLES OF MIRACLES pulls out a semi-automatic pistol (where did he get that??!??!!) and starts blasting zombies left & right. I started counting the shots until re-load time and he reached 20 and still did not reload. Yeah - took into account that it was done automatically somewhere when the scenes switched.

Eventually everyone dies; the American and pregnant girlfriend escape; and this painfully slow movie mercifully ended!! The movie started out interestingly enough and kept my attention until about the 1/2 way point, but it seemed that it just dragged on and on and refused to end. Yeah - NOT all zombie movies have to be action-packed, some of the better ones are not, but this movie - was about to poke my eyes out with a plastic spoon.",1425772800,,3623,4.791666666666667

6472963,5,B00L6AW0M4,"When I first heard of THE DEAD more than a year ago, I decided to watch it. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. The acting and the zombies were right on in my book. I am a big zombie movie fan and enjoy ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"", ""Zombie"", and ""The Dead"". Now, I am proud to add ""The Dead 2"" to my library! At the end of Part 1, I was a bit wary of how they were going to make a part 2. Easy! Transfer the ""infection"" to another Country! lol Alas, they did that with a man that had been bitten by a ""crazy woman"" after visiting a part of Africa. This time, we see the ""infection"" spread across India.

 An Electrical Engineer is on a contract job in the Country of India. While on the job in the ""field"" he learns of distressing information coming out of Mumbai and other areas around him while in contact with one of his friends via cellphone.  He is even witness to an attack on a man not that far from him attending his field. He knows somehow this is all wrong and something deadly is happening. His thoughts go to his pregnant girlfriend near the slums of Mumbai and how to get to her safely. With time literally running out on him and his girlfriend, he immediately leaves on a treacherous journey to get to her. On the way, he meets up with an orphan boy that ultimately guides him to the city in chaos, but not without several attempts by infected undead to stop them!

 I won't give away the ending, but I think the Ford Brothers did a great job on this one and can make a 3rd if they choose to do so. I hope so.
Well done Ford Brothers! If you like these type of movies, I think you will like this one as well!

Special Features include ~ The Making of THE DEAD 2 and deleted scenes, 5.1 Dolby Digital sound,  Widescreen 1:85:1
 I gave an honest review of what I think on this DVD. Also, if you are thinking the zombies are going to be sprinting all over the place like that of the remake ""Dawn of the Dead"" several years back, you are sadly mistaken.",1421539200,,2037,4.126262626262626

The plot is very linear; the hero must get to his girlfriend during the beginning of the zombie apocalypse. But there are a couple of twists along the way. The cinematography was good, and the zombie effects aren't very sophisticated (weird eyes and bloody gashes, pretty much), there are some gory scenes of flesh being eaten.

So sick of the other zombies movies making them run like Carl Lewis and have this incredible strength.

While the first film was set in Africa, this film changed settings to India. The premise was also similar to the first, foreign white male engineer (a different character this movie) good with machinery has to travel across the zombie infested countryside aided by native. The African soldier companion from the first movie is here replaced by a young Indian boy. You care for the characters and want them to succeed and reach their destination so the movie is successful in that sense. The zombie makeup is not as good, zombies sometimes being represented simply by some whiteout contact lenses. Still they were creepy and threatening.

It was first rate. The location was also a great choice. It fits the movie perfectly.

I never saw the first movie ""The Dead"" so I can't compare the two, but I can tell you this is one of my favorite zombie movies because it was so much more than a ""rabid monsters eat everyone in sight"" type of film.

This one is very good and similar and fans of the first one should find this a good buy for sure.  This isn't a classic but it's got a great cinematic feel to it.  it is of course very low budget and that's ok because of the care the film makers took it seems like it had more of a budget.  They understand filmmaking is more than just telling a story , it can expand to include lots of  wide shots and landscape views.  You get this in this movie.  The story is similar to the dead one,  the zombie plague has spread to India and the people must react to it.  The only flaw is that if Africa has been destroyed people in India would already know what is up and how to destroy the undead.  In spite of that flaw ,this still is a fine zombie movie. The child actor really shines in this one as he tags along with the main hero.  Like all horror films you can pick apart the mistakes but who cares?

If you aren't specifically into zombie films, and just looking for a good horror movie to watch, then overall I give it 3 stars.

The best part about the movie is it's setting in India and the characters travel through so many different places. I was more enthralled with the topography and scenery...farming villages, forests, temple ruins, and Mumbai city itself. The movie gives viewers a glimpse into a raw, real India and helps what's happening seem more realistic. As a zombie movie, this movie succeeds. It provides a feeling of both something beautiful and horrible, and has a social message under its surface that good zombie movies are known for.

There are several pretty good intense scenes, but in general the zombies provided only an occasional big scare and of course, some gore. But the story is focused on the characters, their trials and the bond that grows between them. The characters are interesting and you care what happens to them.

The first movie, ""The Dead,"" is a little better and is a little more intense if you ask me.  If you haven't seen the first movie, do see that one! If you have already seen it, then this a decent sequel but you'll know what you are getting.

6472997,4,B00L6AW0M4,"The Dead, by the Ford brothers, was such a groundbreaking movie that I felt it was the best zombie-themed movie I'd ever watched.  Naturally I could not resist watching The Dead 2, as soon as it came out.
There's some hating of this film going on, perhaps because the first film was so fantastic that everyone who watched it wanted, basically, for them to ""give me The Dead all over again but even better"".  Such is the dilemma of doing a sequel to a great film.

Viewed on its own The Dead 2 is a very good movie.  But we can't help comparing it to the original.  Plusses and minuses: A plus is they got the same musician, Imran Ahmad, to do the score for this film, and it is equally as good as the original: the ideal combination of tense yet beautiful, and non-Western.  Minus: Nobody can equal Prince David Osai as second-lead character.  Here we have the Indian girlfriend Meenu Mishra playing Ishani.  She does a credible job.  A plus: once again we have a kid as an unexpected and unwanted companion to the lead character who is desperate to get somewhere.  This time it's Anand Krishna Goyal who I think was 9 years old at the time of filming and had never been in a feature film before.  His English and his acting are both impressive for his age.  A minus: Joseph Millson as lead character, an engineer (again) working on wind turbines who, when the plague reaches India, is desperate to travel 300 miles to find Ishani and somehow escape the horror.  Nothing really against Millson's acting, but somehow Rob Freeman did such an impressive job in the first film that I was really hoping he would reappear in the sequel.  Speaking of which: the end of the first film left plenty of room to pick up the story exactly where it left off, as it left off in a cliffhanger (like old 1930's films).  For various reasons they didn't do that, but they do give the audience a tie-in to the first film, as someone from Africa, infected but not yet dead travels by plane to India [Shades of Ebola: it would have been IMPOSSIBLE for the Ford brothers to have PLANNED this-- yet here is this eerie coincidence between their film and real life--rather like the shuttle near-disaster in the disastrous The Core, and the real shuttle disaster which occurred shortly before the film was released].  A plus: the vast vistas alternating with claustrophobic interior and city scenes, much like the first film.  The Ford brothers, in short ""bonus features"", speak about the terrible obstacles they experienced filming the first movie in Africa, which made them think for awhile they might never make another movie, let alone a sequel.  Perhaps that's one reason they didn't pick up again in Africa but chose another continent for the sequel--bad memories from the first film.  They discuss some equally harrowing moments trying to film the sequel, like getting pelted with stones and physically attacked by villagers at one point...  A minus?  I can't put my finger on it, but somehow Millson's cross-country trek never captures quite the same magic as Freeman's does in the first film.  It's not the little things some people nit-pick in my opinion, like how the zombies sometimes seem incredibly slow then at other times seem more energized.  Look: zombies aren't real, right?  Why do they have to behave absolutely consistently?  Are we all zombie experts now?  No--one other short on realism bothered me a little more: why not more attention to the sheer problems of finding food, water and fuel while crossing the 300 miles of zombie-infested countryside?
Some fault the conflict between Indian concepts of marriage versus the more contemporary Western idea of Millson and Ishani's love for each other and determination to re-unite despite their cultural and national differences.  I thought the dynamic was sensitively played, and the family dynamics of Ishani's family were a strength of the film.

A plus?  Yep once again the film ends with a cliffhanger: one can alternatively view the characters as doomed or as maybe having another trick to pull out of their sleeve or a happy turn of fate to extricate themselves.  Will there be a Dead 3?  If so, is it going to pick up with this couple?  With Rob Freeman again [seems unlikely, but one could hope].  Somehow bring them all together unexpectedly?  Or will we just see yet another continental region ravaged?  America and Europe both seem overplayed with zombie themes, so what would we have left?  China?  Australia?  New Zealand, or South America?  Still a number of good options left for a new setting.  If you liked The Dead, you ought to enjoy the sequel; just don't expect exactly the same thing the second time around.  I'm hoping they can do another 2 sequels!  As for viewability: considering it IS a ZOMBIE MOVIE, the R rating is appropriate: basically for scenes of violence although they are not unnecessarily gruesome for the subject.",1412380800,5,4896,4.759193357058126
6472998,4,B00L6AW0M4,"Three years ago I watched the Ford Brothers' zombie film, THE DEAD.  It was one of the best zombie films I have ever seen.  I loved every second of that film.  I was very excited to hear that they were making a sequel.  As you know, most sequels are never as good as the original film, but I am happy to report that THE DEAD 2 is just as good as the first.  In fact, it is almost a carbon copy of the first film, with different characters in a different location, but as good as the first film was, I was fine with ""more of the same"".

  If you saw THE DEAD, then you know exactly what to expect from THE DEAD 2.  It is more of the best zombie mayhem you will see in most zombie movies these days.  The story is simple, yet interesting enough to keep you entertained the entire running time.  The cinematography of this film is amazing as well.  Just like the first film which took place in Africa, the scenery in this film now set in India was breathtaking at times.

6473003,3,B00L6AW0M4,"The Dead 2 also known as The Dead 2: India is the sequel to the very successful and entertaining 2011, The Dead and once again written and directed by Howard and Jonathan Ford.  As with the original film, the Ford Brothers take the action out of the usual confines of big American cities and moves it to foreign lands.  The first was set in Africa and the sequel takes place in India.

The Dead 2 is a sequel in name only.  The film doesnt featuring any returning characters or plotlines other than the zombie plague arriving in India.  Nick is an American engineer working on windmill turbines in India.  He has fallen in love with an Indian girl named Ishani who he learns is pregnant just as the zombie outbreak begins.  As the city of Mumbai comes under siege by the zombies, Nick has to undertake a perilous journey 300 miles across the wilderness to try and reach the woman he loves.  Along the way be meets a young orphan boy who becomes his guide across the zombie infested wasteland, traveling on foot, by car, and motorcycle.

Like the first film, much of the action in The Dead 2 takes place in remote areassmall villages and outlying areas which offer little refuge from the zombies.  By contrast, Ishani and her parents lock themselves in their small home in the slums of Mumbai, Indias largest city, as soldiers battle the zombies overrunning the city.  The Fords again do a great job with a small budget.  The makeup effects are not spectacular but they are solid.  The Dead 2 is average in terms of the amount of gore.  Blood and guts don't ooze off the screen but its certainly superior to many other low budget zombie films.

Other than lead actor Joe Millson the rest of the performances are wooden and forgettable.  The biggest detraction in The Dead 2 is the overly sappy love story between Nick and Ishani.  Ishanis father is opposed to her daughter dating a foreigner and the melodramatics tend to get in the way of the horror.  While not as atmospheric and chilling as the original The Dead 2 is a worthy sequel that again takes the zombie plague into a new direction.",1411776000,,2092,4.533333333333333

To add insult to injury there's a half hour interview with the directors talking like this is some kind of masterpiece.  ""We did Africa, what next?  India!"" I guess we can look forward to another lifeless retread in every country now? I wish I could unsee this movie, the studios could unrelease it, and the filmmakers could unmake it so I could go along with fond memories of the original.

The zombies were very well done and the scenery in the film had some outstanding moments when it came to the landscape of beautiful India.
I have seen part 1, and have to honestly say I liked it better then this one, but nevertheless this movie is definitely one that you would want in your horror collection, despite a few hitches.

He is up on a windmill talking to his Indian chamber maid pregnant girlfriend when all hell breaks loose. The film consists of him crossing desert by car, bike, foot, and that flying thing in an attempt to reach her.

Like the zombies, the characters are rather lifeless. The zombies have zombie teeth, and walk in half steps...unless a gun is fired then they swarm and move fast, like piranha who never attack until someone yells ""Piranha!""

The film includes the problem of western ideas vs. prearranged marriages, a theme used in 99% of Bollywood films, but failed to have a musical number.

The Ford brothers attempt to take the zombie film up a notch by creating faux-drama and unnecessary metaphors as zombies are their own metaphor. If you liked the slow moving first film, I will say this one is better.

6473013,4,B00L6AW0M4,"For those who liked the first film, this will be a sure thing. The director makes good use of incorporating zombie threats into a culture that is largely rural and impoverished. This one tends to focus a little more on personal drama, following a man who has just learned his girlfriend is pregnant, and he must rush 300 miles to save her from zombies in Mumbai. This one felt a little more gory than the first, with teeth gnawing their way through necks. I was a little dissatisfied with the ending, which leaves the fate of the leads in question. But that pretty much happened in the first one, too. Another small quibble: At points the jerky camera movements had me pausing and rewinding so I could see the image again. .",1410998400,4,724,4.492424242424242
6473014,2,B00L6AW0M4,"As predicted, yet another mediocre sequel. I was hoping it would take off where ""The Dead"" ended and with the same main character. Indian zombies are not scary and the played out domestic squabble sub-plot ruins the entire feel of the film. I've seen worse but man, why do so many films wind up as extensions of ""General Hospital""? Get some creativity already. Zzzzzzz..",1410912000,,370,4.796875
6473015,3,B00L6AW0M4,"Friends, I was excited to buy this dvd because I enjoyed the first one so well.  I was a bit upset after viewing it because I expected more. The first movie had a spark.  This one, well our main character was ok.  His love interest, well, I wouldn't have fought through a city of zombies for that.  Basically, our hero is a wind farm engineer on a work contract in India-(other than as an observer, I cannot imagine even a single job India or their government would pay American contractors to do)  A more believable job would have been (The dude from America that outsources jobs to India).  He finds himself in the midst of the zombie apocalypse, in the desert working on the wind farm.  His goal is to survive the apocolypse and rescue his woman.  Most of the show is his going from point A to B.  It is hard to rate this as poor simply because comparing it to the indy films in this genre makes it stand out as very good.
The gore and special effects are just ok.  My dvd leads me to believe that the camera equipment used could have been much better.  The CG helocopters were too clean.  One mode of transportation our hero used was a motorized parasail.  It was interesting, but not the fastest way to get around.  My attitude about the zombies has trickled to a yawn in this film.  If you chased one down, and grabbed the zombie, forced your arm in it's mouth and helped pushed it's head down to chew, one might get eaten.  I loved the first ""The Dead"" by the Ford Brothers, so was just disappointed with this one.  If you have time to kill, it is ok.  If you wait for a longer, director's cut, you will likely be alone in that line.

Zombie effects again were phenomenal and the zombies were creepy as hell !  I highly recommend this film for zombie fans like myself , if you enjoyed The Dead , then you this sequel !",1410825600,4,355,3.971830985915493

Both movies are exceptional and they definitely didn't get the attention and accolades they deserve.

But it wasn't perfect, the main problem I have is how weak the zombies are. They are like Romeros zombies in that they are slow and clumsy except they have absolutely ZERO toughness and strength.",1530921600,,399,4.181818181818182

Every scene she appeared in, especially the ones with her father, took away from the film.  The ""Cloverfield"" copied ending feels like a cop-out.  Since the sequel is a virtual clone of the original, I was hoping for a more uplifting ending.  Overall a disappointing follow up to a minor classic.",1517097600,,436,4.824324324324325
