8377753,1,B002QFGAAQ,This is the worst DVD I have ever bought!  No Stones music at all.  Just a bunch of babbling by a couple of unknown people with poor quality images of the RS's in the background.  Save your money!  I only wish I could give it a negative 5 star rating!,1127088000,25,251,3.96
8377754,1,B002QFGAAQ,"Yes this item has a low price, but it's not worth a penny.  I'd give 0 stars if I could.  Please don't waste your time or money.  This DVD is unauthorized, so it doesn't include any Stones music.  The very limited stage footage is obviously on a loop behind the boring uninformed narrator and is poor quality at that.  The footage of Mick speaking is cropped to only show his upper face - I'm assuming because the creator doesn't have authorization to use the full footage.

Again - do not buy this!  Mine went straight in the garbage after viewing.",1126742400,22,549,4.43
8377755,1,B002QFGAAQ,"Only 45 minutes long - 70% of it sounds like a lecture. Sure, there are cool clips of Rolling Stones playing in the background (from the 60s), but you cant hear them over the lecturer. There's MAYBE 10 minutes of interviews w/ the actual band itself (mostly Mick, a little of Bill). Other than that, the dvd is disappointing for a Stones fan -- opt for Gimme Shelter instead.",1124841600,23,375,4.449275362318841
