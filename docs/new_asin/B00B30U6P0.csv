5554409,4,B00B30U6P0,"As a musician, I was astounded with each performance in this film.  As one who appreciates the artistry of dance, I was spellbound with each performance in this film.  But that's not all.  The art of cinematic composition and audio engineering was so well represented here that this film should be presented to all students pursuing these fields.  I do wonder why it has fallen into the category of documentary however. If you are into music and dance, you will love this piece of art.",1438905600,14,485,4.670588235294118
5554410,4,B00B30U6P0,It seems short and has departures from traditional Flamenco that challenges ones attention.,1421712000,3,91,6.076923076923077
5554411,5,B00B30U6P0,"I bought this BD from Asia though Amazon, as it can't be found locally.
Very good performances by a variety or artists.
The sound , image and production are top notch.
I'm not a Flamenco expert but like the more classical styles (as opposed to the rumba Gypsy Kings style), so I really enjoyed this BD.
If you like flamenco you will definitely enjoy this disc.
I wish there were more concerts in all genres recorded with such attention to quality and detail.",1402531200,7,458,4.530120481927711

5554418,5,B00B30U6P0,"I was flipping through my streaming list when I watched this out of curiosity.  Once I turned it on, I couldn't take my eyes off of it!  Beautiful cinematography and set-designs.  The artistry and skill of the dancers is unbelievable--how do they move their feet so fast?!  The guitarists are awesome.  The singing may not be ""perfect"" like the sound-engineered/auto-tuned stuff I'm so used to hearing in mainstream music today, but they're singing straight from the heart.  You can see that clearly on the faces of each singer.  My favorite number was the ""Cancin de cuna"" by Miguel Poveda and Eva Yerbabuena.  I re-watched that part twice.  The depth of feeling nearly moved me to tears.  All in all, this is a beautiful celebration of Spanish culture and history!  I've never had the fortune to travel to Spain, but I felt like I was able to ""visit"" a corner of Spain for at least a couple of hours while watching this!",1465603200,,922,4.6645962732919255
5554419,5,B00B30U6P0,Best flamenco video ever made to date.,1465344000,,38,4.571428571428571
5554420,5,B00B30U6P0,"Haven't viewed this copy of the movie but I have seen it elsewhere. FAntastico!!! Check out Carlos Saura's ""Flamenco"" (1995) . The children in that movie are adults in Sara Baras version. Great to see the growth of the artists. Flamenco has made a new direction in embracing the art beyond its borders while maintaining its classical tradition.",1463529600,4,344,4.948275862068965

5554423,2,B00B30U6P0,doesn't come close to tango or fado dvd's....yes in photography and choreography but not in enjoyment.  The dance and music were enjoyable  but most of the singing was not.,1455321600,,172,4.896551724137931
5554424,5,B00B30U6P0,Carlos Saura does it again! His passionate love of this art form is very obvious in this film. The artists chosen are all excellent and span a huge spectrum from vintage/classic to present day fusion. I highly recommend this disc to afficionados of this genre.,1453593600,4,260,4.8
5554425,5,B00B30U6P0,"Having previously obtained and reviewed the CD soundtrack from this film, I at last viewed the actual DVD. It is 1 hour 40 minutes, of course longer than the CD album, which had edited away some instrumentals, pure dance works, and other set pieces. The film consists of a series of individualized sections of musicians and dancers capturing traditional and contemporary flamenco. Each section has its unique set design, often with astonishingly colorful backdrops derived from 19th-century paintings. Seeing the expression of each singer and watching the dancers make the film even more interesting. Also the sound quality is excellent. Translations of the lyrics are given as subtitles, to offer additional insight to the vocal interpretations and improvisations. The earlier film, Flamenco, was itself very good, but this one is every better, with lessons learned about cinematography and design and choreography. While I have enjoyed formal concerts and getting up close at flamenco clubs here and in Andalusia, Spain, this film adds to my appreciation by its emphasis on the varieties of flamenco art. Beautiful music, beautiful dances, beautiful film.",1446336000,7,1157,5.433333333333334

8561886,1,B00B30U6P0,"one star, except I didn't even want to put that. For what I wanted, this is NOT the dvd. It's in spanish. I used the english subtitle, but it didn't translate properly. I know some spanish words and they did not use them. Mostly women dancing.. and not in traditionall costume. Nudity in a painting of female shown and way too often. Never did see what i bought it for = traditional, costumed male flaminco dancing. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. ""Strictly Ballroom"" shows alot more of the dance. Alot of singing in this one.. looked like they were dying. Male and female singing. Round, open big mouths and weird expressions like dying. Too much..The songs were very weird.. ""I love green"" was one. Never saw the spanish word for green though. Weird words/songs. Just not my thing.",1501718400,,775,4.7481481481481485

8561888,4,B00B30U6P0,"Filled with music, dance and art, Flamenco Flamenco was so interesting and beautiful.  This is not for those interested in the history of flamenco, but rather just allows the beauty of the dance and music to shine.  There are more traditional and more modern forms of the music and dance and I really enjoyed watching this.  Some of the songs that I know were sung very differently from any way I had heard them before.  Very nice!",1494806400,,431,4.558441558441558
8561889,5,B00B30U6P0,"""Flamenco, Flamenco"" is the superb follow up to Sauras' earlier film ""Flamenco.""  A must see if you're a fan of flamenco dance and music.",1494806400,,137,4.708333333333333
