8227490,2,B000XA6GG4,"In my opinion, this instructional DVD doesn't spend enough time on the basic step which is the foundation for all other steps.  The instructors dance beautifully together but I found their instruction lacking.",1381708800,9,209,5.333333333333333
8227491,2,B000XA6GG4,"This Dvd is not good for a beginner - especially if you are a woman. The ""instructors"" may be good dancers but they are not good instructors. They do not spend enough time on the basics and barely show the woman's part at all. I am very disappointed.",1344470400,11,250,4.229166666666667
8227492,5,B000XA6GG4,I bought this because my wife and I went to Charleston SC and were introduced to Shag and beach music - it is a fun way to dance. I hope it makes it up north someday! This DVD is very helpful in teaching the steps.,1258934400,12,214,3.7777777777777777
