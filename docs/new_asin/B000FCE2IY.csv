My husband is a surfer (40 yrs now) and has a lot of memorilbilla, and looked forward to getting this DVD, but was really let down by the music used (modernized).  Bummer!  Definately not one of his favorties in his DVD surf library.",1214265600,4,399,4.351351351351352
2560652,4,B000FCE2IY,"First,I don't think anyone can come close to this classic. I was on the
north shore when they were shooting some of the footage. I was in middle
school at the time;o.c. and riding my skateboard was all i did.when 5. S.S.
came out at newport mesa theatre. I saw it 3 times. What a great impression
it made. Cause, I never forgot it. Now this dvd is an updated version.
So I cant give it a top 5 stars. If they re-release the ORIGINAL I wont
think twice about 5 stars.",1203638400,7,466,4.076086956521739
2560653,5,B000FCE2IY,"If you surfed in the seventies, you had to hear about this film. It was perhaps the best portrail of the period in surfing. With an excellent soundtrack by ""Honk"" it is a must have for older surfers and new ones alike. It has been out on Video (VHS only) for several years, and when I first saw it I was reminded of the first time I saw it on Screen in the 70's. I like it now as much as I liked it then- check it out!",1197849600,,418,3.7613636363636362
2560654,5,B000FCE2IY,"One of the best surf films I have seen and, for the first time it was a little more than 30 years ago. Gerry Lopez at his best, Jeff Hackman at Sunset, lots of frames that make me go back to old issues of The Surfer. Action, sense of humour, skateboard action, good soundtrack, magic footage by Greenough... Even today a collector's piece and enjoyed by surfers that were not born when 5 Summer Stories were ""told"" on the screens around the world.",1179360000,9,447,4.397590361445783

2560668,4,B000FCE2IY,"Great surfing footage from 1971-72 mostly of the north shore, with the greats of the era represented- Gerry Lopez, Corky Carrol, Sean Thompson, et al.  Laird Hamilton has a few cameos as a 10 year old.  The music is amusing, a lot of it I had never heard before.  The resolution on the copy I got did not hold up on a high definition large flat screen.  It feels sort of long to watch in a single sitting.  There are some interesting side features, like skateboarding of that era and hang gliding.  The section on the early years of professional competitive surfing gives a much different take from the way it is viewed today.  The five summer stories theme is sort of a conceit, and is not really accurate to the content of the film.  The narration is a little over-blown at times, but does not detract much from enjoyment of the film.  I really like the style of surfing from that era, which is so fast and fluid, and there are endless sequences of tube riding at Pipe.  A fun historical document.  Reminds me of the years when I was new to surfing- the formative years.",1405209600,,1072,4.3908629441624365

2560672,5,B000FCE2IY,"4 Stars for content and advancements of the day. 1 star for taking me back to answer the question, ""Where were yo in '72"". MacGillivray and Freeman championed the slow motion in the water shots that truly allow the viewer to see the actual angles, motions, and colors as a surfer sees paddling out and riding the waves. They are simply beautiful.

2560674,5,B000FCE2IY,"This is a very fun surf film. It gives you a small glimpse of the surfing life. Having been a surfer my entire life this film brought back some good memories. I grew up surfing Hunington Beach, Trestles, and various spots south of those breaks. The movied shows a few of them off. MacGilivray is one, if not, the best surf film maker. I attended one of his early films in the 60's, where we watched the movie in a school gym. The good old days. I enjoy the fact that this movie brings those times back to life.",1391385600,,510,4.161616161616162

Such a classic-- the cinematography is gorgeous, as are the settings, love the flashback scenes, and the soundtrack is a classic in itself.  A great time to grow up and a great movie to document that era.  I loved it so much I bought another as a gift for an old surfing friend.",1383264000,,412,4.1125

2560679,5,B000FCE2IY,Five  Summer Stories is a really great surfing movie - great coverage - even included a couple of tandem surfing clips - I wish though that it had shown a little more of tandem surfing since it tandem with its lifts and all is so different from regular surfing and so picturesque in its own way. Most surfing movies skip tandem completely.  I'm glad a recent movie (Deeper Shade of Blue) mentioned this one and commended it or I wouldn't have known it was available.  I actually think someone should do a whole movie on tandem surfing competition and the tandem surfers and how they train.,1370649600,,589,4.537735849056604

2560682,4,B000FCE2IY,"As a kid, I remember seeing ads for this movie when it came out in Surfer magazine, but it never played in our area. I always loved the graphics for it and would see it pop up in places over the years. I'd heard some buddies talk about it and they said it was pretty good (apparently it used to get shown a lot down at Buxton Campground on Hatteras Island). Finally got a copy on DVD and it brought back a lot of memories...good ones, of the 70's surf culture (even though I was a right coaster) when everyone was really having fun and enjoying life. Back then, (as the old man goes on) the only surfing you'd see was on ABC's Wide World of Sports, and staying in on a Saturday afternoon to watch Gerry Lopez get barrelled at Pipeline was the best! If you're young, this is a wonderful little time capsule of a period where the spirit was more important than the fame and fun was the name of the game. Pop this one in on a cold winter's day for a little stoke or during the summer with some surf buddies and acoutrements. It's definately worth having in your surf movie quiver.",1360281600,,1077,4.207729468599034
2560683,2,B000FCE2IY,"To hear some people, it's the greatest movie ever...  Poor quality, not very professional.  Some good stuff on Lopez and the Hawaiian crew, but way too hippy influenced.  I expected so much more.",1358812800,,195,4.848484848484849
2560684,5,B000FCE2IY,"There is no doubt that modern surfers are phenomenally athletic and gifted but I still prefer watching guys like Lopez who seem to embrace the wave rather than attack it. This film captures the essence of what surfing is all about - not seeing how many stunts you can perform but embracing the ocean and the sheer joy of riding a wave. One of the soundtrack songs ""High in the Middle"", sums this up perfectly.
This is a film you will watch over and over again without getting sick of it. I'm just sorry that it took me so long to see it again after the original release in the 70's.
The DVD soundtrack is not as good a quality as the CD but with a little EQ adjustment, it's fine.
If you have ever surfed or even just admired the sport and wished you could, you will enjoy this film for it's great footage, humour and brilliant soundtrack.",1340236800,2,839,4.283018867924528
2560685,2,B000FCE2IY,"I never saw the original film at the movies, but I have to think that Greg MacGillivray and Jim Freeman would not have filmed something that looks like it was made by sitting a camera in front of a TV set.  The station identifier was even in the lower-right corner of the screen.  For the price, this was a very disappointing purchase.  The only reason for the second star was because of the content.  Great movie, great soundtrack, but the quality was terrible.",1310515200,2,462,4.530120481927711
2560686,4,B000FCE2IY,"This re-release is not the original movie, but then again it is!! I was dissapointed to not find it in the original form that the jacket cover suggests it to be . That said, I was 'there'(Huntington Beach Surf Theatre) when this movie came out and it was followed by 5 Summer Stories Plus 1, ..then 5 S S Plus 2..etc.. I think they got up to about ' 5 SS Plus 4 ' or so, I lost track ! This ' Version' is a carefully crafted montage of 'all' the 5 Summer Story films.... Yes I want the ' first / original 'un mixed' version too !' This should be titled something like 5 Summer Stories the Mixed Chronicles.. but that might confuse 'Spicoli' so guess they kept it simple and figured many were too buzzed to know the difference this many years later... LOL.. Still, lots of stoke and it's the closest thing you can get to that point in time and day ... many good memories. P.S. Buy the Honk CD for the best Honk tunes that were in the original release of the movie, much cleaner studio recordings, especially of the tune,  Pipeline Sequence.",1303516800,4,1039,4.247474747474747
2560687,5,B000FCE2IY,"Saw the original release in Seal Beach during quarter break from Cal Poly.  Waited some twenty plus years for it to be released on VHS.  Simply, it is the best surf movie ever recorded.  Sometimes I will play it for the sound track alone, but catching glimpse of the surf photography from time to time.  This is the one all should be judged by.",1296345600,3,344,4.328125
2560688,5,B000FCE2IY,"This 1972 surfing movie is a iconic classic. I first saw it at the age of 13 on Maui when it was first released. The cinematography isn't the greatest by todays standards, but it has a wonderful feel of the early 70s. I haven't confirmed, but I heard the DVD version has been edited and has parts missing, so I went with the VHS tape (my 2nd). Check out vintage Mr. Pipeline, Laird Hamilton as a kid, Eddie Aikau, David Nuuhiwa, animation, skateboarding, bikinis and the awesome soundtrack by Honk.",1291680000,2,498,4.544444444444444
2560689,5,B000FCE2IY,"I've heard so much about Jim Freeman and Greg MacGillivray's (the founder of IMAX) film ""Five Summer Stories"" (and ""Sunshine Sea "") many times from fellow surfers and before it was released in DVD, I'll admit seeing the VHS at various surf shop for years but I always found myself using the money towards surf wax or new boardshorts because what people were selling were these expensive limited edition signed sets and so I passed.

Flash forward many years later and it's been gnawing in the back of my mind that I still haven't seen the film yet and so, I drove to my local surf shop and picked up ""Five Summer Stories"" on DVD.

I've heard about how this film was one of the first major budget films as it was the first film on stereo, it was the first film that paid a surfer (Gerry Lopez) for appearing in the film and how this film literally packed theaters who just loved the surfing, seeing popular surfers from the '70s and also from the past just showing off their passion and also music by the Beach Boys and Honk.

Having watched the DVD again for I don't know how many times since I bought it, I figured that I might as well type up a review on my thoughts of the film.

The film is titled ""Five Summer Stories"" and features various stories somewhat broken down in five categories.  The first story titled "" A Hawaiian Odyssey"" featuring Hawaii in 1972 and various surfers in Hawaii at various locations such as the North Shore, Sunset, Waikiki.  From shots of the various activities in the 1970's, from people in Hawaii at events, to ladies in bikinis and even a young Laird Hamilton at the age of 10.

Chapter 1 3/8 would feature the surfing scene in the 1950's and 1960's with the popularity of surf films, surf shops, knee boarding, Duke and the big surfers at that time.  Micky Dora, Nat Young, Midget Farrelly, Corky Carroll, David Nuuhiwa and more.

Chapter 2 titled ""Different Drummers"" features major surfers commenting on up and coming surfers of the early 70s.  Also, an interesting segment with Corky Carrol with a mic taped to his body while surfing.

Chapter 2 1/2 is titled ""Magic Rolling Board"" and this featured the popularity of skateboarding during the '70s.  This was pretty fun to see the various stunts that people would pull off and the crazy fandom at that time.

Chapter 2 3/4 is titled ""Contest Weight"".  This would focus on various surfing competitions in the '70s.

Chapter 3 titled ""Women in Motion"" features popular women surfing from 1958 through the early 1970s.  It was great to see women such as Lynne Boyer, Linda Benson, Joyce Hoffman and others who revolutionized surfing.

Chapter 3 1/4 features Shaun Tomson and 3 1/2 is titled ""Bright Stars"" and features two surfers.

Chapter 4 features a combination of surfing and old school animation.  Chapter 4 3/4 titled ""Is Surfing Closed Out"" and this one features popular surf breaks and its changes from the 60's to 1995 (new footage).

Chapter 5 is titled ""Heaven's Gift to Man: Tunnel of Love"" which features a combination of surfing and animation.  Focusing on surfers riding the tube.

VIDEO:

Considering the film was released in 1972, many scenes looked pretty well done and the video looks like it held up quite well through the years.  The problem is that I don't know how much was added in newer footage versus what was shown in the 1970's.  But all in all, the older footage looks pretty good on DVD.

AUDIO:

A lot of music and narration.  A lot of people who grew up in the 70's have always talked about the awesome soundtrack and people who have seen the original film have said the film version of the DVD has its music replaced (half of the Beach Boys music replaced).  So, again...not having seen the original '70s film, I don't know how much music was changed from the original to this present DVD version.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features but there is a 1:29 minute prologue asking people ""What were you doing in 1972?"".  Prologue was misspelled as prologe but very minor quirp.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Personally, I can see why this movie is a classic and I definitely agree it is a time capsule for surfing past.  There are so many cutscenes, surfing and a bit of humor and fun included in this film and for a film created in 1972, I can tell you that the footage looks much better than a lot of surfing DVD's and VHS I own from the 80s and 90s.

For me, I enjoy watching legends like Gerry Lopez and even seeing Corky Carroll just ripping and just having fun on the waves.  There are so many legendary surfers on this film and of course, many of them were in their teens or twenties at the time, so it was cool to see them surf.

I actually enjoy humorous cut scenes and footage that may not seem as much to others but yeah, sing Bill Hamilton and little Laird surfing at the age of 10 and 11 was pretty cool because that little kid has grown up to become one of the best big wave surfers of all time.

I've read some reviews about how the DVD version of the film does not have the original music as the original film and it truly was a bummer to them.  I have not seen the original film with the original Beach Boys soundtrack, so I am not affected.  But I supposed I can understand in someways when I watch a DVD for a television show and the music was changed because they don't have the music rights for the DVD releases and yeah, if you don't like the music which replaced the original, yeah, I can see that really dampening the experience for some.

Also, I noticed that the original film clocks in at 94 minutes, while this DVD version clocks in at 89:38.  So, five minutes maybe were cut?  Not sure.  I do know that near the end, we see 1995 footage, so not sure if the film was re-edited to celebrate its 25th Anniversary or what.

But all in all, this film is one of the few surfing DVD's that I can say is worth owning.

I enjoyed watching the classic 70s footage and the fact that the film tried to introduced so many parts to it, all in all, it was fun.  Was it better than ""Endless Summer"", I'm more biased towards ""Endless Summer"" but overall, ""Five Summer Stories"" was just fun to watch and having it in my collection definitely has me stoked!",1280361600,15,6186,4.442375886524823
2560690,5,B000FCE2IY,This was the best of the first true surf movies.  I have been looking for this title of and on for years.  I remember seeing this movie downtown; my good friends and I took the Leeward bus from Ewa Beach. With this movie it made surfing all the more sweet.,1254787200,3,256,4.1
2560691,5,B000FCE2IY,"Good movie from the 70's of surf/beach culture of the time. Good music, fun animation, lighthearted entertainment.",1245801600,,114,5.764705882352941
2560692,5,B000FCE2IY,"I was lucky enough to catch this movie in Laguna when it was new.  Corky Carroll, David Nuuiwha, Mike Hopps, Rocky (thanks for the ride home, bro), and a crowd of hooting locals watched it.  Honk produced a thumping soundtrack in sync with the action, the beat punctuated with saxophone; the intervals pulsing with piano.  Gerry Lopez captured the imagination of the surfing world in this movie.  A dozen copy-cat movies would follow.  Everybody started riding seven-six pintails at California beach breaks hoping to emulate Gerry.  Mac/Freeman got rich off this movie as they re-released it or toured the surf movie circuit with it again and again, with updated versions.  It was really popular.

I especially enjoyed the insightful commentary by the likes of Dru Harrison (a really hot South Bay surfer that passed a few years ago, RIP), Drew Kampion (one of the few surfing writers with any literary talent), and Chuck Dent (an anti-hero of the highest order).  Some of the sixties (which lasted until 1973) philosophy seems dated today, but most of resonates truth.  The surfing seems stiff and simple, compared to the manuevers done today, but it was state of the art at the time.  My old surfing buddy, Mike Hopps, for example, shown on 3 waves (blond guy on a white board at Rocky Point and Pipeline), really labors just to complete a bottom turn and off-the-top.  The portraits of David Nuuiwha and my high school classmate, Brad McCaul (one hardly ever saw him in Algebra II, because he was always in Hawaii) focus on the best California surfers at the time.  McCaul's surfing at the Santa Ana River Jetty used to blow my mind.  Nuuiwha's surfing was poetry in motion, smooth, like a yoga or zen master would surf. Mike Purpus, hated at the time, surfs really well in this movie.  But most of the surfing features Hawaii, glorifies ""da country"" (it's not the same anymore on land) living, and especially Gerry Lopez.  Chuck Dent's (RIP) diatribe at the commercialism creeping into the sport was prophetic.  Rick Griffin (RIP), a famous surfing and psychedelic artist, did a neat poster for the movie.
The movie documents the end of the golden era of surfing, when it was done for the love of the sport, not money, fame, or competition.  It was a great time to live, and I'd love to do it again on today's boards, to tell you the truth.

If you were a surfer in the 70's, you've probably seen this movie already.  It will bring back memories.  If you haven't seen it, it's a good look back into the history of the sport.",1230681600,2,2528,4.687074829931973

The seller had this at my house before my Amazon Movies I bought at the same time.  The movie arrived a week in advance.  Very cool - thanks!",1456185600,,334,4.092307692307692
