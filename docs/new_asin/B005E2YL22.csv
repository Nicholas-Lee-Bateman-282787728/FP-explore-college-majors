4663399,5,B005E2YL22,This is a good movie from start to end. There is plenty of action. Apparently is based on true events which makes the movie even better.,1325030400,,136,4.269230769230769
4663400,3,B005E2YL22,"Hmm, I wanted to like this film a lot more than I did by the time the credits rolled. The story of a talented marathon runner who is also a cold blooded, unfeeling bank robber/killer. As a runner with nowhere near the talent of the 'anti hero' of the film played by Andreas Lust, the scenes of him running throughout look better than any I can ever recall in a movie. As the film opens Andreas gets out of prison for bank robbery and immediately returns to the only two things he lives for--running and crime. Its unclear why he does either activity as neither one seems to bring him pleasure or meaning in his life any more than the beautiful girlfriend he resumes living with upon release. In fact the 'why' of what is driving Andreas in his life is never explored or revealed in this film. He's gifted athletically; his Parole Agent & others bend over backwards to help him; and yet he seems to be a complete, unfeeling, 'zombie' hurtling towards self destruction. 'The Robber' seems to be driven by the theme of nihilism to its quiet, near wordless conclusion. Be aware this is not a 'satisfactory ending', it all makes sense now kind of film, but it is compelling & well done.",1324944000,4,1181,4.472222222222222
4663401,5,B005E2YL22,"This is a must see, although its in german, its a great intellectial cat and mouse film too watch.  I've seen great films before and this is one of them...if your into cops chasing criminals or escapees from prison, you'll definately love this... Very simular to ben afflicks film ""the town""",1322092800,,291,4.705882352941177
4663402,5,B005E2YL22,"A spare, minimalist Austrian film (in German, with English subtitles), skillfully rendered. We first see the subject as a thin man in his thirties, in prison for robbery. At the same time he is a dedicated long distance runner, so much so he has convinced the authorities to place a training treadmill in his cell. But for unclear reasons he is deeply angry, committed to his path of defiance no matter the cost. When released from prison, he unhesitatingly reverts to criminality, in a series of daring daylight bank robberies. Simultaneously he trains for and wins some significant marathons. His diamond hard way of life is humanized only by the relationship he forms with a woman; of course this becomes his downfall. The script has its origin in the real life story of one Johann Kastenberger, but has been appropriately fictionalized to work as a film.

A straightforward dramatic development, in the form of a Greek tragedy, with the action narrowing down until only one possible outcome remains. The opaque psychology of the criminal mind is portrayed without being discussed as such; here is someone focussed enough to be able to succeed in a normal life if he would choose. But he will not choose. ""What I do,"" he tells his woman friend, ""has no relation to what you call life.""

That is as much as we are told about his thinking. Indeed there are sparse words in the movie. Instead the story is told in cinematography, as it should be in film art of high order, with simplicity, in a near documentary style. The shots are natural, not flashy, with nothing extra, yet the director manages to create more tension in one straightforward chase through the Austrian countryside than a dozen tricked out James Bond spectacles. A clean, elegant work of art. I was impressed with director Heisenberg, whose disciplined cinematic style may have something to do with his descent from two generations of scientists. I look forward to further work from him.",1321056000,,1956,4.8532934131736525
4663403,2,B005E2YL22,"So yeah, that image of the guy with the freaky mask on and the preview with him running everywhere hooked me pretty good. Also, heard the chase scenes were pretty good based on another review here.

But really, overall, this movie fails to deliver. As background it's not really based on a ""true story"", but an adaptation of a novel that was loosely based on some actual events. That's far from based on a ""true story.""

And that's a good thing too, because the protagonist in this story is about as endearing and audience-engaging as a dried banana peel. He utterly lacks color, and there's nothing really to identify with him with the exception of that he seems to derive some vague diversion from running. But we're not allowed to enjoy that with him because he does not externally enjoy it. It's very irritating to watch.

There is one splendid chase scene. One. Only one real chase scene. It's amazing scene, extremely well choreographed and shot. I was very impressed. But there's only one of them, and it lasts about 1.5 minutes. I recommend just watching that as opposed to the whole movie.",1320796800,4,1098,4.678756476683938
4663404,4,B005E2YL22,"There's a new ""running"" film available on DVD/Blu-ray. It's ""The Robber"" (aka Der Ruber), which is the Benjamin Heisenberg-directed film based on the true story of Austrian bank robber/marathoner, Johann Kastenberger. The screenplay was adapted from Martin Prinz's 2006 book, ""On the Run."" The film made the film festival rounds in the spring, but the DVD/Blu-ray release will be most's first exposure to the film. It's also available on Netflix Instant. The film is in German, but is sub-titled in English and is very easy to follow, as the dialogue is very deliberate.

So who was Johann Kastenberger? According to the film, and to Wikipedia, Kastenberger was a convicted bank robber, who was first arrested in 1977 for robbing an Austrian bank. He served a 7-year prison term and trained extensively while in person. Upon release, he made an instant splash in the marathon, setting an Austrian national record (the film shows 2:20, but I can't corroborate that anywhere online and haven't read Prinz's book yet). The film does show him winning the ultra difficult Kainach Mountain Marathon in a still standing record of 3:16. Not long after being released from prison the first time around, Kastenberger reverts to his bank-robbing ways and becomes known as ""Shotgun Ronnie,"" due to his penchant for wearing a Ronald Reagan mask during his robberies. This is something that is left out of the film.

Andreas Lust does a very passable job in portraying a competitive runner. He's fit, has good form and most importantly, looks the part. There are some excellent action scenes in ""The Robber,"" particularly one after a robbery nearly goes awry and he runs through multiple buildings being followed by a single camera, and ends up hopping on a trail to evade the police. It's a very entertaining film and is well worth 90 minutes of your time.",1319760000,8,1843,4.98051948051948
4663405,5,B005E2YL22,"The Robber is loosely based on a true story of a champion marathon runner who also robbed banks in his spare time. The cinematography in this movie is fantastic - the running and chasing scenes where the camera follows is as good or better than any hollywood production, overall this is well worth having a view on a quiet evening...",1308960000,11,333,4.566666666666666
8467850,4,B005E2YL22,"Well I say it's a true story it is, as usual, based on real facts. The film is about a marathon runner called Johann Rettenberger played by the uber brilliant Andreas Lust (`Munich'). After being released from prison for armed robbery he goes on to win a Viennese marathon. He is though a loner and his parole officer is concerned that he seems to shun the company of others - `the loneliness of the long distance runner' personified as it were.

He soon moves in with an old flame who is still carrying a torch for him. He meanwhile remains as cold as a fish and aside from practice runs he starts to do armed robberies all over Austria. He seems to love the thrill of the chase as much as the loot he is making off with. What follows is a really extraordinary story of a life quite literally on the run. This is in German with good English sub titles.

This is a very well made film, with Lust putting in an excellent performance of a man who is so far removed from societal norms that he has his completely own set of values. This is based on a novel but the real story comes from Johan Kastenberger who did all his robberies in a Ronald Regan mask and his story is probably more sensational than as depicted here. Either way a really superb way to spend 100 minutes and a film I can recommend to all lovers of Euro based crime cinema.",1431475200,,1338,4.243137254901961
8467851,4,B005E2YL22,"Take a look at this very good Euro version...before Hollywood cranks out their dummied down crappy edition (intended for ten year oldsas most Tinseltown flicks are these days.)

My only beef is they did change the way this guy's life finally 'unraveled' at the end. But hey, what they did in the film does work. Cast is quite convincing, especially the lead actor.",1424131200,2,364,4.777777777777778
8467852,5,B005E2YL22,I could've got this movie somewhere else for free but oh well at least I got it in bluray. No behind the scenes or any of that extra footage.,1388275200,,141,3.896551724137931
8467853,4,B005E2YL22,Must see...  Not your typical Hollywood smash & grab shoot em up style action flick. Great performances by both the main Character and supporting. Great ending.,1361923200,,160,5.153846153846154
8467854,3,B005E2YL22,"This movie has it's moments, but is a missed opportunity. I have never watched a film with such an interesting subject matter be so boring most of the tiime. There is virtually no character development. The chase scenes are extremely well done and that is what saves this movie from being a total disappointment. I had read many positive reviews and was expecting more.  I am an American that really enjoys foreign films.  I hope someone else tells this story again that is capable of really good story telling. It's clear that the film crew is very talented to do some of the things they do, but someone really needs to re-tell this story and do it justice. Definitely rent before buying. The PQ & AQ are top notch.",1361836800,,716,4.542635658914729
8467855,5,B005E2YL22,"It was really interesting, well-acted and had lots of action! I have loaned this movie to some friends and everyone has loved it so far.",1354320000,,136,4.48
8467856,4,B005E2YL22,"""The Robber"" (2010 release from Austria; 96 min.) brings the story, ""based on true events"", of Johann, who is a convicted felon for armed robbery and after a 7 year prison sentence is finally released. He promptly (as in: the next day upon his release) goes back to robbing banks in and around Vienna. While he was in prison, he trained for long-distance running, and soon we see him running marathons in Vienna (where he promtply sets a national record) and elsewhere Austria. Johann meets social worker and one-time family friend Erika (""You're all grown up"", he remarks), and she gives him a room to stay at her place. Of course they strike up a relationship, even though Johann remains the ultimate loner, living from robbery to marathon, as if his adrenaline drives him to that. Eventually Erika finds out Johann is robbing banks, and the police gets on him too. To tell you more would be to ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, Andreas Lust brings a terrific performance as the loner Johann, with steely nerves and determination. Second, there are a number of great cat-and-mouse sequences (not all of them chase scenes) between Johann and the police as they track him down, just riveting. Third, this movie was released on DVD in the US last year and the DVD box notes that ""this movie is already slated for a Hollywood remake"". I haven't heard anything about that yet, but if Hollywood does remake it, I can only hope that they will keep the same grim yet riveting tone of this Austrian movie (I somehow doubt it).

In all, I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign crime drama, ""The Robber"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1351468800,,1733,4.660130718954249
8467857,5,B005E2YL22,"I saw this film on Netflix and it is a masterpiece, lots of twists, and a very interesting style, considering the amount of time that the protagonist spends by himself. I highly recommend seeing this film.",1342828800,,205,4.722222222222222
8467858,4,B005E2YL22,"It was known as the largest investigation in Austria's post-war history.  In the late '80s, over 450 police officers trying to capture the most elusive criminal in the country, Austrian marathon runner Johann Kastenberger.  A man known for robbing banks while wearing a Ronald Regan mask and was known as ""Shotgun Ronnie"", also a man wanted for murder.

Austrian author Martin Prinz would write the novel ""Der Ruber"" loosely based on the true-life story which would later receive a film adaptation courtesy of director/screenwriter Benjamin Heisenberg (""Sleeper"", ""At the Lake"").  The film was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival.

The film would star actor Andreas Lust (""Revanche"", ""Fast Forward"", ""Munich"") and actress Franziska Weisz (""Hotel"", ""Dog Days"").

VIDEO:

""The Robber"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  The transfer looks absolutely wonderful as it features the beautiful cinematography of Reinhold Vorschneider.  While overall picture quality is more towards the ""cooler"" side in terms of colors, the overall image looks good with some indoor scenes having higher levels of noise.  But for those most part, there is wonderful amount of detail, you can see the detail of clothing and surfaces of objects.

If I did have a negative about the video, it was not more of the video but the fact that some scenes are extremely dark.  From the lovemaking scenes between Johann and Erika, for several minutes, you can barely make out certain images but I suppose that Reinhold Vorschneider wanted to capture natural colors and natural environments which I do understand.

But sticking with Kino's rule of non-modifications to their Blu-ray release, the overall picture quality for ""The Robber"" is very good!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Der Ruber"" is presented in German DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and the lossless soundtrack is primarily dialogue, but there are some scenes such as Johann stealing a car and we are greeted with various styles of music.  The film also presents quite a bit of ambient noise, may it be during scenes with crowds at the marathon to the sounds of the police (cars or copters) that are chasing after him.

But overall, lossless audio is good for this film.  Nothing too immersive but works perfectly for this film.

Optional English subtitles are presented.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""The Robber"" comes with Kino Lorber trailers and stills for the film.

EXTRAS:

""The Robber"" comes with a slipcase cover.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Robber"" is a loosely-based film on the actual events that took place in Austria back in the mid-to-late '80s.

There are obvious differences from the film and the actual true-to-life story as the real Johann probably was involved in multiple murders and of course, the final events depicted in the film.  But if there is one thing to say about this film, director Benjamin Heisenberg's goal was to create film without following Hollywood banality and providing a reason of  why this man has become a robber.

Is he stealing because his family is in financially in trouble, money for lifestyle reasons, stealing because he wanted to help the poor or someone in the family or is it one man's way of creating excitement in his life?  There is typically a reason given of why one would risk their life and that would help the viewer understand why they commit these criminal acts.

For ""The Robber"", one can psychoanalyze the situation and probably think that his robberies is his entertainment, his excitement, his version of instant pleasure.  He's not a man that goes out and spends the money on whatever he wants.  He just robs banks, stashes the money and doesn't indulge in it.  In fact, he's probably a man that is fixated on the risk of being caught and being able to runaway from it.

And that is possibly the intention of Johann Rettenberg.  He is a man who has run away from things.  Possibly an altruistic individual.  His life, danger...he keeps on running, he keeps pushing himself to be in this top condition and surely enough, he beats marathon records but when there is no marathon, what does a man who enjoys running do?  While the obvious answer is train...train and train, perhaps he needs a little more excitement in his life and thus robbing banks and the danger associated with it, is what fuels him?

And just to read the story of the real life Johann, it's hard to fathom how a wanted man was captured but escapes and is able to elude authorities.  It's what makes ""The Robber"" have such a unique scene never seen in a movie, a man's escape and he keeps running away from authorities, literally.  There is not much focused on the actual drama that surrounds this character, we just watch and see how long he can elude authorities and how.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""The Robber"" looks great on Blu-ray and the lossless soundtrack is quite adequate for this film, as it is front and center-channel driven for its dialogue and ambiance.  Unfortunately, there are no special features aside from trailers and stills, but I was hoping to hear an audio commentary track or see a featurette on the making of the film.

Implausible as the real-life story may seem, many of these events indeed happened. I felt that director Benjamin Heisenberg made the right decision to end it the way he did, rather than follow the go out with a bang storyline (which happened to the real-life Johann).

Overall, ""The Robber"" is an intriguing heist action film.  Granted, it's not heavy in the drama department, nor did I find it ebullient.  The film will not give  you any answers of why Johann does what he does, but still, ""The Robber"" was exciting and different nonetheless.  The cinematography by Reihold Vorschneider and the planning for the various scenes were well done and I definitely was hooked.",1336176000,,5821,4.901840490797546
8467859,4,B005E2YL22,"A fine movie about really, really focused OCD and the impact that singular compulsion has as it becomes more intense.",1326240000,,117,4.9
