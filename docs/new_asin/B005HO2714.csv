8473333,3,B005HO2714,"This 1974 sequel, ""Harrad Summer"", also known by alternative titles, ""Love All Summer"" or ""Student Union"", is the sequel to 1973's ""The Harrad Experiment"", but ""Harrad Summer"" cannot compare in quality to the original movie, albeit there are good points to it. The edition viewed, on the label E-1, a.k.a. Entertainment One (without release catalogue number), is in the PAL video format and has Dutch subtitles (but worry not, the dialogue is spoken in English); it seems to be full screen, rather than the more desirable widescreen display. However, for a film of such modest value, those factors are not too unduly distressing. The image quality usually is good, except for stretches here and there some of which may have their derivation in ""stock footage"".

In ""The Harrad Experiment"", i.e. in that film, not necessarily in the novel on which the earlier film was based, the newly sexually liberated kids at movie's end still were in their initial semester. ""Harrad Summer"" takes up the story at summer break, following their second semester of the freshman year. Four of the kids travel and stay together at the homes of three of them. The roles of Beth and Sheila are taken by the same actresses as in the original film, respectively Victoria Thompson and Laurie Walters. Richard Doran plays Harry Schacht in the 1974 sequel, having a strong physical resemblance to Bruno Kirby in the 1973 movie. However, while there is some faint physical resemblance between the more ruggedly built Robert Reiser as Stanley and the ethereally beauteous Don Johnson, who was so memorable in the 1973 film in that role, Reiser does not generate anywhere near the sexual and physical charisma of Don Johnson. However, who could have done so, really? Don Johnson in 1973 was at the height of his youthfully bewitching physical beauty and screen magnetism. However, it is the screenplay itself for the 1974 sequel that is the most inferior aspect compared to the memorable 1973 film.

The Harrad students make an effort to stay mum about the teachings about polyamoury which they so recently have studied and especially about the sexual relations which they have been enjoying at college, hiding all of that as best they can from their parents. However, most of the mothers and fathers find out, one way or another, about what their offspring and their friends had been experiencing or these elders already either have had suspicions or have heard about those scandalous matters. The cast members who portray these older characters, parents and adult family friends of the  college kids, are decidedly positive assets to this movie, turning in some vivid and droll performances. As the film comes to its end, on return to Harrad College after summer's end, Sheila drops out, merely visiting Harrad to explain her situation to the faculty in person, due to class and parental tensions with Stan that, during summer, have proven insurmountable.

The sequel (with its merely dorsal nakedness, and very little thereof, at that) is worth seeing if one is an hardcore ""Harrad"" novel/film fan as this viewer has been right from university days onwards, even briefly meeting Robert H. Rimmer himself, the notorious author of ""The Harrad Experiment"" novel at one point. For others, probably only the 1973 original ""Harrad Experiment"" (including on DVD only as much of the nudity, dorsal AND full frontal, as the editors of any particular video edition permit to survive cutting from the more massive presence of nakedness in the move itsef) is the film to see.",1496448000,,3538,5.011904761904762
