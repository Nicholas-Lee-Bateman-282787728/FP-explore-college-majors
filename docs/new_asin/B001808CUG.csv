8267983,5,B001808CUG,I actually only wanted Destroy all Monsters but who could pass up the two at the price offered. The new Gamera movie is of much better quality in story then the older ones were so I did enjoy that one as well. Destroy all Monsters is one of the best old Godzilla movies an I was very pleased to be able to get it,1365292800,,312,3.890625
8267984,5,B001808CUG,"Destroy All Monsters is a Blast to see again, it's still great fun 40 years later!  Gamera: Guardian of the Universe is one of the best Kaiju films made.  Getting this twin pack of movies is a great deal, don't let this one go.",1311379200,,227,4.136363636363637
8267985,5,B001808CUG,"For some reason, this was the only way I could find Gamera: Guardian of the Universe on dvd.  If you don't already have Destroy all Monsters then this is what you really want because this package is a very good deal at the asking price, better in fact than DaM by itself.  The quality of the newly remastered prints is increadable and just adds to the value.",1303603200,,358,4.3283582089552235
8267986,5,B001808CUG,"I already had the Godzilla movie ( which is NOT anamorphic, and it also lacks DVD menues ) on a better asian DVD, but I bought it for the Gamera movie. It's fantastic. I highly recommend it.",1290384000,,190,4.162162162162162
8267987,5,B001808CUG,These movies are awesome & they remind me of when I watched them for the first time as a child.,1282867200,,95,3.8
8267988,5,B001808CUG,i just ordered it and what can i say two of my favorite kaiju in one. first with DAM (destroy all monsters) i love the art work in the front of the box and the disc is a bit bland but im not gonna complain about the disc. im talkin about the movie its pretty damn good i loved all monsters in it but their is one thing when you see gorrosaurus coming up from the ground in france they call it baragon. other than that its pretty good and another thing is that varan came up in one second i wanted more action with varan. ok now with gamera the box work is badass and i loved the movie. oh yea when you recieve your oder you get this little card and its just the catalog for the company. i am gonna order the catalog for it. i did like the servouis forom this company  and i will buy from them in the future,1265414400,3,806,3.8848484848484848
8267989,4,B001808CUG,"Great movies, but the DvDs don't offer much. I've never watched these on DvD, but they are definitely the old discs repackaged. Gamera is the only reason I bought this 2 for 1 set and that disc offers plenty of special features.

Both DvDs are non-anamorphic and the DAM DvD is a single layer disc with no chapter stops. The packaging says 16:9 on the back cover, but it's 4:3. Very misleading. The one thing I do love about the DAM DvD is the cover art. I love it. If they ever release this film in a ""digitally remastered in HD special edition set"", they must keep the art.",1247702400,2,575,4.275229357798165
8267990,4,B001808CUG,"These are both ADV releases, yet Destroy All Monsters (DAM) is as barebone as can be, and Gamera Guardian Of The Universe (GGOTU) is nicely loaded with bonus features. The DAM dvd has no scene selecton, it a has no subtitles, it a has no Japanese audio, it a has no trailers, it a has no special features, it a has no knickers, it is a knock-ed. (I hope a Benny Hill fan reads this). The GGOTU dvd is loaded with special features like a press conference, interviews, behind the scenes stuff, theatrical and tv trailers, and other stuff. It has english subtitles and a choice of Japanese or English audio. Destroy All Monsters is presented in 2:35.1 Tohoscope. Gamera is listed as 16:9 LB. Possibly a 1:85.1 aspect ratio. As for the movies themselves, I prefer DAM, it's just a lot more fun. But seeing a Gamera movie with a large budget is pretty cool too. One final thing, the DAM dvd plays in a continuous loop. When it ends it automatically starts again.",1245715200,8,957,4.474285714285714
