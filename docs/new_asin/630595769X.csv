This film can truly be called ""artsy fartsy"".  :)  If you're familiar with the Brothers Quay short animations, then you'll recognize many of their concepts here.  I own this DVD and only watch it every now and then.  It's one of those movies you keep around to watch when the mood is right.

1092458,3,630595769X,"""Institute Benjamenta"" has all the positive attributes one would expect from the Brothers Quay: poetic and haunting scenic composition, magnificent photography with ultra-shallow depth of field (a Quay hallmark), and an eerie  off-key musical score perfectly mated to the visuals.
What the film lacks -- and lacks quite desperately -- is effective writing.  The Brothers' verbal skills are, unfortunately, several orders of magnitude below their compelling visual imagination.  The result is that scene after scene is damaged by lines of dialogue that range from pedestrian to downright painful.
While ""The Brothers Quay Collection"" DVD of (dialogue-free!) short films remains an enthusiastic five-star recommendation, ""Institute Benjamenta"" is much more hit-or-miss.  Fans of the Quays will at least want to take a look; others may be better off skipping this one.",995760000,14,865,5.682170542635659
1092459,5,630595769X,"The imagery and subtlety of this film is beyond compare. I bought Institute the night I rented it.  The Brothers Quay make excellent animation pieces, and at first I didn't think they would be able to pull off a film with actual people in it quite as well. But Institute is by far their greatest achievement!! I'm not sure why some reviewers thought the characters were flat- I didn't see that at all... and the pacing was perfect for the film (not atin any way boring). Each line said in Institute had meaning and usually was brought up again in a different context later in the film that would alter the sense and thus understanding of the words, adding texture and depth to the story. It is difficult to always hear what the characters are saying, and so this film warrants multiple viewings in order to fully grasp the entirety of its concept. I loved the religious inferences made to Kraus (indeed all the main characters had some Jesus/Judas/devil characteristics)and how wonderfully it was all tied together. It was a film with humor and sensitivity completely without pretentsion, which is rare in art films (think ""Begotten"" and David Lynch). The cinematography was the most original and lovely I've ever seen- if Kafka and Carroll made a film, it would turn out like this. The film was based on a novel and some short works by Robert Walser (who was around in Kafka's time- Kafka actually took a little of his style from him)and it helps to read them to make better sense of what goes on at times.  The music is typical modern classical stuff the Quays usually use, and it is as always exquisite, especially ""classroom dirge""- that scene gave me goosebumps!. This is a hard film to describe because it is so completely otherwordly and original. A must see for any literature fan or lover of dynamic, elegant film. These guys deserve a lot more credit than they get as directors.",986688000,4,1888,4.666666666666667
1092460,4,630595769X,"Sun Ra lived in Germantown.  David Lynch was across the street from the Mutter Museum of Pathology (that houses the remains of the original ""siamese"" twins amongst other oddities).  And the brothers Quay obviously were influenced by the Franklin Institute.  The commonality seems to be a sense of madness and epiphone that lies within the structure of discipline and study.  Institute Benjamenta is not so much a story as an experience,  exactly what you'd expect from a private fraternity with a history for specializing in visual abstractions.  Only it is now startling to see the activity produced by live actors rather than their usual bits of shop class remnants and broken dolls.  The effect is less fascinating, but more disturbing.  I have a friend who contacted the distributor of this film when it was still restricted to rental, hoping to get enough friends to cover a screening.  Instead, when the video came out, she couldn't sit through it.  Yet she still is haunted by it.  This is not an easy movie to recommend, but you may not want to take the chance of missing it.",985564800,15,1083,4.8
1092461,5,630595769X,"A quiet and softly spoken man arrives at a ghostly building to enrol for the servants class taught there. He rings the doorbell and is greeted by a monkey's face through the small hole in the door. The man's name is Jakob. He enters and meets one of the two owners (a brother and sister). The brother is unpleasant, and informs Jakob that there are no favourites here.
Jakob goes into class to meet the other students. They all announce their names to him and then fall over. The lessons are presumptuous and iterative. They involve the men swaying from side to side and standing on one leg. They really are quite eccentric. The institute seems to be its own little world away from reality, with its low ceiling rooms. The sister soon has a strange fondness for Jakob. This is a very sombre film, but has a unique air to it. The pacing is pedestrian, but you stay with it. The acting is good, and the camerawork is meticulous and probing.",973641600,10,938,4.459302325581396

1092583,2,630595769X,I just rented this and watched it last night.  Frankly I couldn't find much of a coherent plot.  Some of the images were cool and some of the lines were interesting but I couldn't feel anything for any of the characters.  Each character was too strange and too distant to relate to on any level.  Perhaps that was the feeling the Brothers Quay was shooting for.  I was hoping for a challenging commentary on domestic service at the end of the 19th century with neat animation as the movie write-up suggested: didn't get it.,1064102400,2,523,4.5212765957446805
1092584,5,630595769X,"I sought to obtain this film for my collection almost immediately after seeing it.  I cannot give it enough praise.
I was quite drawn into the 'perfumery' mythology the Brothers had created for this translation of Walser's work.  Of course this mythology has a framework all its own, but is seamlessly fused with the story.  Although I have yet to see the rest of the (stille nacht) series, it appears they had built the foundation of the visual largely from their previous pieces ""Stille Nacht""(1988) and ""The Comb"".  The photography and animation, as always, commands the highest respect.
Some may have difficulty appreciating the dialoge in this film, but I for one thought it was delivered flawlessly; the unstable vibration in Jakobs voice, the side-saddle yet wanting manner of Lisa...I have no clue as to the extent of engineering that went into the voice track, but it exhibits a clever aesthetic nonetheless.
The soundtrack is spectacular, not only according to its own merit, but also how closely it embraces the ambience and imagery of the film.  Lech Jankowski is quite skilled as a composer, and I look forward to hearing more of his work.",1061337600,5,1152,4.917525773195877
1092585,5,630595769X,"This film was my introduction to the Quay Bros.  It took me completely unawares - I happened to see it at a festival one day, having never watched the stop-motion shorts, and what can I say...it blew my mind.  I had no idea what was going on and I still don't; I mean, there's the obvious domination and submission theme, the fashionable fascination with turn-of-the-century class politics, the inevitable reluctant revolt against the System, ""similar to Eraserhead,"" blah blah blah; what you're really looking at is an arty, deliberately weird version of ""Gosford Park.""  Yet it's chock-a-block with the most absolutely incredible, riveting, breath-taking visuals you will ever see.  The Quays are indeed consummate master image-makers. In fact ""Institute Benjamenta"" is for me is almost completely about the atmosphere created; the plot and dialogue are simply layers in the mix.  The grainy black-and-white expressionist beauty of the film, the scintillating light and looming shadows, the uncanny choreography of the characters: this is what trips my trigger.  I rarely watch it all the way through.  I find some of the ""comedy"" elements trite and embarassing, the sort of cute intellectual in-jokes that smarmy hipsters chuckle at in art-house theatres to signify the extent of their reading or whatever.  The storyline is really pretty boring and predictable, if obscured by frequent formal attempts at strangeness.  I'm not all that charmed by ineffectual, witless Jakob.  But none of that matters.  ""Institute Benjamenta"" is indeed ""a great feast of fetishized imagery,"" an eye-candy tour-de-force, and I can't recommend it enough on these grounds to anybody capable of becoming completely visually immersed in an object of incredible aesthetic beauty.",1053907200,4,1760,5.386861313868613
1092586,5,630595769X,"After viewing their collection of short animation pieces I had high hopes when I purchased this DVD.
I just viewed it a couple of days ago and I was astonished by the beauty of it.
I noticed a lot of the themes the brothers used in their short animations. For example, Anamorphosis is being used for the image of two copulating deer, a lot of 'Stille Nacht' influences and there appears an animated piece in the movie that is taken directly from 'Stille Nacht 3' (the Brother's obsession with deer antler is very noticeable throughout the whole movie).
Some accuse the Brothers of being pretentious but you can't deny the beauty of this movie, especially the use of lighting and their play with shadows.
After viewing 'Institute Benjamenta' I only hope for Zeitgeist to release more of the Brothers' alchemical short movies.

1092587,5,630595769X,"I recently bought the DVD of the Quay brother's INSTITUTE BENJAMENTA, or THIS DREAM PEOPLE CALL LIFE.  I bought it purely on reviews, which praised its expressionist B & W cinematography and bizarre nature.

To be honest, I've bought many film because of high praise from a dozen or so reviewers and found the films somewhat boring, e.g., THE VIRGIN SUICIDE, GHOST WORLD, etc.  Yes, I know I'm a heretic. But German expressionism is a special interest of mine and so I decided to take a chance, preparing to curse my vulnerability to persuasion if I was disappointed.

The film starred Alice Krige (most famous as the Borg queen in STAR TREK, FIRST CONTACT and Mark Rylance, best known for playing William in ANGELS AND INSECTS.  This time the reviewers led me to a fine film.  Bizarre, to be sure, and much like ERASERHEAD, with a decided noirish atmosphere.

The story concerns a man who applies to a school for servants and learns, through a series of classes, to totally subordinate his ego to the will of an employer.  Alice Krige is the sister of the headmaster, who is the catalyst for revolutionary changes------------or is she?  The film may be about man's relationship to the State, revolution, class structure, obedience, or a few other things.

The expressionist atmosphere is thick enough to choke on and the possibilities of what's really going on may be as much a puzzle as MULLHOLLAND DRIVE.

If you have a taste for the strange, like noir or expressionism in B & W, or found ERASERHEAD intellectually engaging, you might like to try this film.

  Whilst not as magic as the Quays short films, (Personally I can't think of anything that is). This film is still a beautiful one. Others have commented on weakness in the dialogue, while this may be true in places, scenes such as that where members of the institute act out scenes from life are wonderful. A classroom full of grown men, (where did they find the actor who looks more like Egon Schiele than Egon Schiele did?), chanting in unison ""The institute is no place for your vile fantasies duchess, please remove your hand from my knee"".

For anyone who has watched films like Eraserhead, you must apply the same laissez-faire attitude and allow the fantastic imagery to speak for itself because any attempts at interpretation will only lead to confusion and frustration.  This movie is an absolute masterpiece of surrealism and leaves you in wonder and awe!  The bizarre actions and camera work leave you begging for more.  The overall atmosphere of the film is sad and reflective, bordering on nearly being morbid, but that is it's allure.  The spiritual numbness and insane behavior of the characters is somewhat similar to that in David Lynch's Eraserhead and leaves you feeling like you just got back from a funeral populated by inmates from an insane asylum, but the effect of the film is superb !!!

For me, the Quay brothers are right up there with Cocteau, David Lynch, Man Ray, Duchamp, ... you get the picture.

I found this film mesmerizing from start to finish. The Quay brothers, as usual, lovingly, meticulously, and fervently pay attention to all details of their creation.

With so much attention to detail, one would expect to find the film stultifying and stilted in result.

However, the brothers stay true to and present myriad and interesting versions of their iconography, symbolic logic, and weird beauty referencing their other creations.

I found this work to be very sympathetic with Guy Maddin's ""My Winnipeg"".  In order to appreciate ""My Winnipeg"" or ""Institute Benjamenta"" you have to be a fine artist or have a very strong artistic bent.

I highly recommend this film to all art film lovers and Quay brothers enthusiasts.",1349222400,,908,4.973509933774834

7898049,5,630595769X,"Institute Benjamenta is a brilliant brew of dream, N.European myth, Buddhist philsophy, and emotional repression and longing, and asks us what it means to exist in a world. It's mesmerizing in dark-toned black and white, full of rich textures and fascinating camerawork, often coming across as a film and story from 100 years ago. Maybe unsurprisingly; it's based on the German novel Jakob Von Gunten by Robert Walser (who was possibly mad), written in 1908, though for the Quays this is only a jumping off point. It also seems to pay homage to Bruno Schultz, who mined similar literary territory in Poland some thirty years later. The film asks other questions - who saves, and who is saved? What is nihilism and what is freedom? And it has plenty of strange and subtle humor as well. The music, by Lech Jankowski, is great - somber cellos here, free jazz explosions there, broad humor ensembles here, medieval psalms there.
Rylance, Krige, and John excel in their roles as humiliated nobody (and anti-hero), haunted longing headmistress, and passionate crazed headmaster. The students in Walser's novel were actually youngsters, and the Quays smartly transpose them into the childishness of adult pupils, which gives the movie yet another layer of meaning. The actors who portray them also do a great job... A tremendous meditation full of symbolism and craft that becomes richer with repeated viewings.
  Well, topically speaking it's about Jacob, a person lost in a dream, who goes to an institute (perhaps in Switzerland) to learn to become a servant to wealthy folks, at the turn of the century. They have lessons - strange apparently meaningless ones, and there is antagonism between students as there always is in reality - they are definitely adults being kids.... The Institute is run by brother and sister, and their relationship with Jacob is by turns confusing, controlling, and erotic. Jacob wonders at the Institute - what are they learning? Why are they there? What's going on? All in his dreamy odd way.... The richness of it, though, lies in the many layered images and mythic/religious references, along with it's superbly off-kilter low-key humor. A man biting a pine cone?

Strange maybe, but it's a world created by the twin brothers Stephen and Timothy Quay who are known for their claustrophobic animated shorts which are little dreamlike environments, filled with wood, iron, feathers, shattered glass and worn-out, strange little moving puppet things. Now there is their first live action feature and the Quays have managed to keep the dark brooding atmosphere that was so deliciously present in their early works.
The Institute is a school for butlers, but expect no standard training procedures. It feels more like some `last resort on earth', a school in which lessons are repeated to infinity and makes the students move and look like marionets.

There is no real story here, in the minds of the Quay brothers that concept probably doesn't even seem to exist. It's a series of tableaus in which not action or dialogue but movement is the main treat; there is the motion of the actors, who are sometimes directed to make seemingly unreasonable moves, and there is the perfect collaboration between lights, camera and editing. It's a ballet, a theatre of motion, and the spoken dialogue is more part of the music than of the plot.

The decors are incredibly detailed: pictures, mis-en-scene, objects, nothing escapes the eye of the filmmakers, who seem to operate even more as one single person, then most single movie directors do.
