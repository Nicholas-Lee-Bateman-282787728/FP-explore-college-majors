288717,3,6300270106,"Originally titled ""Smorgasbord,"" this 1983 Jerry Lewis comedy never received an American theatrical release yet remains among his better efforts. The film is little more than a collection of sketches involving a suicidal misfit named Warren Nefron. Some routines are priceless (notably the pantomimic tour de force in a psychiatrist's office) while others misfire. Nevertheless, it's nice to see writer-director Lewis in relatively good form after the astonishing sloppiness of ""Hardly Working"" (1981).",1140134400,2,502,5.890410958904109

My brother and I have watched this movie several times since first seeing it on cable as kids, and everytime I see it I can't help but laugh louder than ""a land-to-air missile""  Screw all the skeptics, Jerry is one of the funniest freaks in Hollywood history and it's a shame you have to go all the way to France to find people who realize he's a genius.

289107,5,6300270106,"The year is 1983 and Jerry Lewis is already an industry comedic legend. Cracking Up was a hilarious, terrific film taken on its own merits. But I feel this film was Lewis's homage to spontaneous comedy and for the dozens of times I watched it, I can't help but notice how much fun it looks like everyone is genuinely having.

""Cracking Up"" combines such a classic congolmeration of talent (Lewis, Milton Berle, Foster Brooks) with well-timed cameos (Dick Butkus, Sammy Davis Jr.) and terrific writing that maximizes the imagination and spontaneity that a cast like this should exude. Viewed as a whole, it may seem like a mash collected skits from Lewis's mind -- and you'd have a good argument for this -- but I dare you to not laugh at it.

Despite the dark subject matter of a suicidal lead character (played by Lewis) who is such an indelible screw-up that he can't even secure his own death, the film interchanges between lighthearted and caustic comedy. In one moment, Lewis is trudging through Bugs Bunny-like mishaps at an art museum, the next moment he is being subjected to Butkus's style of forcefully quitting smoking. All the way through, Lewis's improvisations and trademark energetic wit are evident. I was extremely excited to see this released on DVD, and for anyone who has not seen it, I urge you to give it a chance. The only things missing from this film were cameos by an abusive Don Rickles or a haughty, drunken Dean Martin, both of which were covered by Foster Brooks and Dick Butkus' roles.",1427673600,3,1516,4.716981132075472

289155,4,6300270106,"I think by this time in Jerry's career, he just wanted to see if he could throw out a film to determine if anyone would come to see it based on his marquee name alone.  What you get is a film filled with bits.  Most hit, some don't, but all of them remind you of the genius of Jerry Lewis.  Even the scenes that miss still bring a laugh because Jerry reminds you that humor can have you clutching your sides by physical comedy alone, without going blue.  Among the scenes that definitely hit are one in a therapists office with a HIGHLY waxed floor, and a restaurant scene with what has to be one of the funniest depictions of a waitress I've ever seen in my life played by Zane Busby.  If she had been the waitress in Five Easy Pieces, Jack Nicholson would never have stood a chance. A definite slapstick winner is a scene with Jerry as a ""good ol' boy"" cop who pulls over an abnormally large man in an abnormally TOO small car.  I basically gave it four stars because I could see that at this point, Jerry still had the old school genius in what is unfortunately a modern world where sexual innuendo has been substituted for an easy four letter word.  Jerry, if you see this, you still have it!!",1407110400,,1197,4.246696035242291

289158,4,6300270106,"This film is a much better effort than Jerry Lewis' disjointed & muddled ""Hardly Working"" (although HW was a hit at the box office). The nicest thing you could say about HW is: 1. It marked Lewis' return to movies after a decade of exile. 2. It paved the way for better films. ""Cracking Up"" is among his better ""comeback"" efforts.
Using his tried & true ""free form"" directing style to tell the comic tale of what has to be the most hapless soul on the planet, Lewis does an older version of his ""jerk"" persona who seeks help from a psychiatrist (nicely played by Herb Edelman) to cure him. From the opening scenes of Lewis sliding all over the shrink's slick office floor to the film's payoff gag (Lewis is cured, but the doctor discovers he's inherited his patient's problems), it's just one hilarious moment after another. The couch sessions provide a loose framework upon which Lewis' character introduces zany stories of suicide attempts & histories of luckless relatives.
There's a bonus of guest appearances from Sammy Davis, Jr. & Milton Berle (Uncle Miltie in drag, naturally).
While not quite the classic that early Lewis films such as ""The Bellboy"" & ""The Errand Boy"" were, I dare you not to laugh at this one. Lewis hasn't lost his talent for making people laugh. Check it out!",1382140800,4,1288,4.6784140969163

289330,3,6300270106,"His ""darkest"" movie since ""The Patsy"", this occasionally odd '83 mix of mild satire of contemporary life with quiet but serious pokes at various professions, most notably Psychiatry (Herb Edelman is the low-key cliche-ridden analyst who asks his patient, Nefron, how many visists have transpired, not by number of visits but by number of dollars); but in a more fun way, at the many occupations *attempted* by Jerry.

Interesting family flashbacks, as the patient recounts trials and tribulations of ancestry....who also do not exactly have their act together. A French prisoner in the Bastille even struggles to keep his French accent going, as actor Lewis adlibs that it's easy to slip into his ""Japanese"" voice!

A good number of hilarious bits to be treasured by aficcionados and students of film comedy. Lewis in his mid-50s is spry and vital and has retained the best comic timing since Stan Laurel - showing Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, Martin Short, and the rest how physical comedy is done; how a touch of pathos can make a scene memorable.

Fun to watch Lewis ""players"" like Bill Richmond and Buddy Lester do their thing. (Who can forget one of the funniest scenes in history, back in 1961, as JL, ""The Ladies Man"" helps Lester ""clean up"" for a date with one of the many ingenues at the Boarding house for young women?).

Uncle Miltie shows up in ""drag"" - a good premise is dragged out, however. Sammy Davis, Jr., is also on the scene, looking fit and playing himself. Good job.

Most of Lewis' films do have a good number of prolonged and pointless passages, and, sadly, with Cracking Up, we must bear some extra-curious, embarrassing tries at ""adult"" humour, replete with juvenile toilet jokes - the kind of thing which became a staple of Cable TV and Radio talk shows. Enough said.

In the end, it's nice to see Jerry Lewis, though somewhat subdued, deliver a true ""Jerry picture"" at that juncture in his career.",1316822400,5,1923,4.794561933534744
289331,5,6300270106,"Jerry Lewis has always made me laugh!  Anytime Jerry is going to be playing multiple roles, it is certain to make me laugh the whole way through.  This was a DVD that I had specifically requested that Amazon start carrying and I want to give a big THANK YOU to Amazon!  This has been a great movie and I plan to enjoy it for years to come!",1302566400,,339,4.029850746268656
289332,2,6300270106,"I was really looking forward to finally getting this movie in DVD format (great movie). I was pretty disappointed when I received this DVD and found that the Warner Archive DVD's are very finicky about where they will load.  It doesn't work in my main DVD player which is only a couple of years old.  I have a small 9-inch DVD player that it will play in, but if you have a DVD player that records, forget about the Warner Archive DVDs, so now I have to watch this movie on a tiny portable player.  Every other DVD I've ever purchased before works fine except for this one.  For the price of this DVD, it should have been recorded like most all other DVDs.",1294272000,2,656,4.266129032258065
289333,2,6300270106,"It can be comforting to find that lovable Jerry on screen again: the movie is our usual Jerry that we have definitely seen in a dozen movies before this one.

There are moments where continuity and editing suffer greatly. Because Jerry plays different characters throughout the movie...the viewer is confused if it's Warren (Jerry's character) dressed in a disguise---or if it's Jerry Lewis as another character. Some of the gags can be tough to follow if you are not a Lewis officionado.

It boggles the mind that Lewis has kept his comedic style rooted to the 1940's. I suppose the phrase ""if it ain't broken--don't fix it"" comes to mind but some things do become outdated.

The structure of the film follows more of what Lewis has always done in the past: an episodic film with a string of clips rather than a strict story that arcs (ala The Nutty Professor). It can feel a bit limiting to constantly watch Lewis films in this way. It's a never ending cycle...the structure complements the comedy and vice versa.

There are few good moments though: smoking/being knocked out; the (confusing and out of place) bank robbery/musical; the waitress at the diner and spline operation scene. That's about a handful of gags from a film that has maybe 20.

Older fans, I suspect, will enjoy this movie. They will not notice any difference with this movie to any of Jerry's past films. If you're looking for a typical Jerry Lewis film--you won't be dissapointed. If you're looking for something different...you'll be dissapointed.",1287532800,,1523,4.864864864864865
289334,3,6300270106,"As far as the Movie itself, I liked it and thought there were a few VERY funny scenes. My only complaint is with the DVD itself. It won't play on my best equipment because it's a player AND recorder. It says right on the back of the case that it won't play on machines that also have recording capability. That's a first for me. Very aggravating.",1281916800,5,346,4.257575757575758
289335,4,6300270106,"I've never been a Jerry Lewis fan which isn't to say that I haven't liked some of his work.  What I'm trying to say is I haven't seen much of his comedic work so I really can't formulate an opinion.  He was brilliant in Martin Scorsese's masterwork, ""The King of Comedy"" and he had a terrific turn as a garment salesman on the great TV series ""Wiseguy"" in the Eighties.  ""Cracking Up"" isn't  a comic masterpiece but it's darned funny.  There's no real plot here persay but a series of vignettes.  Some of it works and some don't but enough does to make this worthwhile viewing.  Lewis demonstrates his adeptness here not only as a great physical comedian but also a master of the visual pun.  I was reminded of Rowan Atkinson's inspired comic creation, Mr. Bean, but I'm sure Atkinson took some of his cues from Lewis.  The greatest compliment I can pay to Lewis is that this film is an impetus for me check out some of his other films.",1280016000,2,936,4.395348837209302
289336,5,6300270106,Many people have seen this but not in a long time. I think it's one of his best. He plays a man trying to seek psychological help but runs into many odd characters along the way. The scenes of him sliding all over the doctor's plastic furniture and in the restaurant with that waitress are unforgettable. Tape played well.,1256688000,,322,4.47457627118644
289337,4,6300270106,"I can't add much to what other reviewers have already stated; if you like Jerry Lewis, you'll love this film. It has many memorable parts that'll make you laugh out loud even though you think it's stupid. Of course, not all of it is great. But one scene that comes to mind is the trooper pulling over the obese speeder. Another knee-slapper is ""hey, can you give me push?"" ""Sure!"" the man says, knockng Jerry on his butt. ""No, I meant my car."" ""Oh, OK!"" as he proceeds to push Jerry's presently driverless-car down the hill. Naturally, it's better to watch.

As for why no DVD, who knows. Amazon had it as a download-rental, but that's gone. If you search [...], you can find a torrent, but it is an old vhs recording that looks all of its 25 years with tracking lines and horizontal flagging at the top of the screen, but it's the only copy I've seen out there (other than spending $85-100 for a used tape!!",1233446400,,908,4.372781065088757

When I was 3, my brother taped this off HBO, and I watched it every day.  3 times a day.  I am not kidding.  My family went nuts.  They loved the movie, but cmon, 3 times a day, isn't that excessive?  Yes.  It was.

But this movie is hysterical.  And the caveat is, people will either love it or hate it, and you'll never be able to predict who will fall into which camp.",1144195200,5,535,3.9065420560747666

7807954,5,6300270106,"Jerry Lewis wrote and directed some classic comedy films such as The Bellboy, The Errand Boy, The Ladies Man, The Nutty Professor, The Patsy and The Family Jewels.  He had a patented character stuck in adolescence and virginity.  But when the 60's ended, his Jewish schlemiel character was eclipsed by Woody Allen and Mel Brooks who could be funny while having sex.  Lewis attempted a movie comeback with Hardly Working, which followed Steve Martin's The Jerk by a year and promoted itself on the poster as ""the original Jerk"".  He tried using the same adolescent schlemiel character, but it didn't fit on a middle-aged man with bags under his eyes.  It wasn't as funny as his previous auteur comedies and he had trouble getting studio backing for Cracking Up (also known as Smorgasbord).  But this time, it seemed like Jerry had been watching a lot of Mel Brooks films and updated his character with a lot of pee-pee doo-doo jokes and a lot of ogling breasts.  It worked.  It was his funniest movie in years, and it could have been the start of a whole new chapter in his movie career, but it wasn't properly promoted and died at the box office, so he never wrote and directed another movie.  It's a shame.  See this movie.  It is funny.",1509235200,,1238,4.607305936073059

This is not just a cinematic masterpiece, it transcends genre and medium and must be regarded as one of humankind's great works. Ethics? Aesthetics? The Good Life? Compassion? Justice? They're all in here, along with a great instantiation of what happens when you give a narcissist all the uppers and downers he can handle AND complete control of a moviemaking budget. I used to think of Don Knotts's How to Frame a Figg as the greatest motion picture of all time, but watch this and you'll come away saying (like I did) ""Don Knotts was no Jerry Lewis.""",1506988800,,608,4.8
