8405245,5,B003TLM564,"The Revolt Of Mamie Stover was released in 1956. It starred Jane Russell with good support from Agnes Moorehead. The story of a prostitute driven from town to town. She finds love but throws it away for money. Fans of Jane Russell, and Agnes Moorehead will like this the most.",1481241600,,276,4.54
8405246,2,B003TLM564,"I just received this DVD and I'm disappointed in the video quality (grainy and soft) and the audio seems to be in mono - not 4 track stereo in which the film was originally released.  This is basically a bootleg copy of the movie (released by Feel Films) not authorized by the copyright holder, 20th Century Fox. Hopefully one day, Fox will give this little gem of a movie the proper treatment and release it in a restored version on Blu Ray.  Jane Russell gives a solid performance.",1450137600,4,483,4.4772727272727275
8405247,5,B003TLM564,"Overall  good transfer on  this  hard to come by film.  Toned  down  for  U.S.  consumption and  censors.  (A hostess?  A  prostitute  implied,  but
not  outspoken)",1436313600,,164,5.0
