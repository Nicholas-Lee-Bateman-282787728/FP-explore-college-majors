777842,5,6304091192,"In another review, someone asked what happened to the real Mr. and Mrs. Loving. I have read several newspaper/magazine about the Lovings. Richard Lovings was killed in a car accident shortly after he and Mildred were able to return to Virginia permanently. Mildred became blind in one eye as a result of the accident. Mildred is still living in Central Point, Virginia (the town where she and Richard grew up and met), but she does not want to be bothered by the media. For the reviewer who said the movie did not explain why Mildred and Richard got together, I have an answer to that as well. The town where the Lovings grew up had been racially mixed for decades, and had a long history of peaceful, friendly relationships between blacks and whites, as well as many interracial relationships. So, a white man and black woman becoming romantically involved (and the white man respecting and not using the black woman) was nothing unusual.",1112054400,14,939,4.766871165644171
777843,2,6304091192,"The story falls short in bringing Mildred and Richard alive.  It jumps too quickly into the love story, failing to acquaint us with either of them as a person, failing to give us any idea why a rural working-class white man born and raised in the Jim Crow South would choose to marry the black woman he loved instead of enjoying her in the bushes, as his contemporaries did with their communities' tacit approval.  Is Richard noble, or mentally deficient?  This movie will never tell you.  Nor are you told what Richard's parents thought of his marriage.  We never see inside Richard and are given but limited glimpses into Mildred.  Still, it is a significant movie because it tells a story few Americans know about their history.

The Loving decision is getting a lot of attention these days because the legal definition of ""marriage"" is at stake.  At the time of the Supreme Court's decision in 1967, interracial marriage was banned in sixteen states, including Virginia (thus a minority, not a majority, of the United States).  Interracial marriages had been celebrated elsewhere in America, and legally, since shortly after the first blacks arrived here hundreds of years ago.  So it isn't true that ""blacks and whites have only been able to marry each other since 1967.""  At the end of the movie, though the caption gets the number of states wrong, at least it is made clear that it was a minority of states that banned interracial marriage in 1967.",1106092800,3,1455,4.78
777844,5,6304091192,"Having read recent newspaper accounts of the repeal of the remaining anti-miscegeneration laws in various states. I wanted to see more about the case which began it all. The State of Virginia V Loving. With a name like that the State of Virginia did not really stand a chance. But it would take another six years after Richard and Mildred Loving married before the United States Supreme Court overuled the State of Virginia's viciously racist findings to allow the Lovings to finally cohabit and return to their waiting relatives in Virginia.
This wonderful film is about a genuine love story in which the Lovings a interracial couple from Virginia marry in segregation era America and feel the full impact of the old slavery laws come hurtling down on them. On their wedding night the Lovings are dragged from their beds and thrown unceremoniously into jail. Richard Loving is freed a day later because he is white but his wife has to languish in jail for another seven days before she is informed of what ""crime"" she has committed.
The Lovings are invited by the judge to accept jail or be banished from the state for 25 years. After choosing the latter the Lovings find it impossible to shake off the homesickeness for old friends and family and decide to secretly return home. The remainder of the film is dedicated to their participation in the Civil Rights movements, the birth of their children and the legal battle which ensues with the State of Virginia. The Lovings  legal representation was rpovided free by the American Civil Liberties union after Milded Loving wrote to President John F Kennedy. This scene is particularly moving.
The leads are played by the beautifully sensual Lela Rochan ( Waiting to Exhale 1995) and the gorgeous Timothy Hutton (The General's Daughter (1999) This stunningly sexy couple who are instantly likeable and engaging , really bring the Lovings story to life. However this is a Hallmark film on a smallish budget so no one should expect riveting car cashes or lenghty court room speaches. The focus is always on the emotional chemistry between the couple and how their right to live without being harrassed by the state of Virginia or separated from their extended family is a matter of personal dignity and essential to the integrity of American society. Watch out for some original archival footage from Martin Luther Kings legendary ""I have a Dream"" speech.",986342400,42,2403,4.9041769041769046

777846,4,6304091192,A young interracial couple of the 1960's fights Virginia's racist laws against mixed marriages. It seems unbelievable today that such laws would exist in the United States. Viewing this film reminds us that racial  prejudice has deep roots and it takes ordinary citizens with the courage to  stand up for their rights if discrimination is to be overcome. The movie  was well done with good performances. A good film for young people to see  to remind them not to take their freedoms for granted.,956534400,7,495,4.857142857142857
777868,5,6304091192,"I fist saw parts of this film in 1997 when I was 8, and enjoyed whatever I viewed. Now 16 years later I can say I saw the whole film, and enjoyed it. Its still an inspiring case and such a touching real life story the Loving's had. This film touches so nicely all the moments during their turbulent times.",1376352000,,305,4.1
777869,5,6304091192,"I did not want this movie to end. Usually, when there is so much heartbreak and racial injustice i lose interest and become disappointed, but it  was great to watch a good ending that turned out in their favor. This was a very courageous couple whether they realized it or not. I have wanted to see this movie for awhile and i am so glad i finally saw it. I think these two played the role of the Lovings very well. Their chemistry was wonderful to watch and so believable, thus it brought the story to life. The original Lovings definitely deserve the honor of being remembered for what they went through to change those ridiculous laws. Without knowing they somehow helped pave the way for a better society and made people have an open mind about what love really is, and can be, no matter the color or culture. Love is something that if it finds you, if you do not pursue it,or are scared to,the results will probably be regret and unhappiness, or being with someone you really don't love, just because of the opinions of others.",1371513600,2,1032,4.4603174603174605

777873,3,6304091192,"I have never seen this movie, and I am really into Timothy Hutton ever since he won an Oscar for the film Ordinary People.  It is a good movie, not great, but good, and its a true story.",1318809600,,186,3.8947368421052633
777874,5,6304091192,This is a great movie about love. But the sellers have lost their ever loving minds about the price of it. This movie should be no more than 9.99 at the highest and 4.99 at the lowest,1310428800,6,183,3.972972972972973
777875,5,6304091192,"Why? Because it's the perfect way to celebrate ""Loving Day"" an unofficial commemoration of the Supreme Court decision that struck down anti-miscegenation laws in Virginia, 16 other states and nationwide. Naturally, Richard and Mildred Loving weren't the first (or the last) interracial couple in America, they were the first to have the courage to challenge an unfair law...and for that alone, they are heroes and role models to all who believe in personal freedoms.

If you ask me, Mr. & Mrs. Loving should be re-released into theaters rather than just limited to cable television. This is the kind of movie I enjoy watching most...a love story that is based on the inherent romance of Reality. I thought that Timothy Hutton and Lela Rochon played the roles of Richard and ""Bean"" Loving in a very believable and empathetic way...and the actors selected to be their children were just adorable! One of the things I appreciated about this movie was the way it demonstrated how the Lovings were like any other ordinary couple: how they had the same good times and that they sometimes had similar miscommunications, jealousies, and insecurities other couples experience, and how they sometimes fought with each other about the same relationship issues that any other couple has to work their way through. By showing the various emotions displayed in this movie, I felt that it helped the viewer, even if they've never been in an interracial relationship, identify with the Loving family and their plight.

While I firmly believe that the Civil Rights story in Mr. & Mr. Loving is an important story...and is one that definitely needs to be told rather than downplayed, I must say that I was glad that this movie wasn't treated as some dull and dry ""documentary"" or ""advocacy"" type of story. I'm even gladder still that the message of this story wasn't blurred by some sensationalist trash bordering on soft core racist pornography. Far too often most interracial love stories are treated in this manner...and I find that patently offensive. As a person who had dated/married interracially, I have a vested interest in seeing more movies done featuring realistic portrayals of couples that look like my partner and I, quality romantic movies with beautiful cinematography, fully developed characters and believable well written plots...and at the same time are still entertaining and allow that bit of escapism we crave when watching films.

One of the things I appreciated about this movie was watching the transition of ""Bean"" from being that naive trusting teenager,the one who practically worshipped the ground Richard walked on...and watching transform into a strong, confident mature woman with her own tastes and opinions apart from her husband...and to see her be able to stand up to her husband without alienating him.

Overall, I thought it was a very good movie, but I do have a few suggestions that would improve the DVD: Showing more deleted scenes, include some outtakes, perhaps a documentary about the actual family and the case, one that lets real life interracial couples talk about their lives and experiences, as well as the making of this movie with interviews from the actors, producer and director.",1308009600,4,3217,5.087121212121212

I tell everyone watch the movie at least once. Mildred was a wonderful friend, one of my closest friends. She knew me and I knew her. She has told me so many stories about her and Richard. And Loving was the perfect name, they loved each other so much. I can remember sitting at Mildreds kitchen and us talking for hours. Or laying in Mildreds bed and talking about our lives being so simular. I loved her so much & I miss her even more. She is in my every thought. Leslie Houser.",1257033600,5,647,4.4
777903,5,6304091192,"My husband and I first saw this when it was released 10 years ago.  We found ourselves mirrored in this movie--the struggle of soul mates who happened to be different races to simply be together like any other couple.  As played by Hutton and Rechon, this movie is one of the best love stories you'll ever see.

Who knows why Loving took to his wife so?  In a part of the country where race was always a factor, love between these two people easily materialized and created lasting bonds.  The Duke of Wales had no problem giving up his throne for the woman he loved; Richard Loving had no problem sacrificing for his love either.  And this love story is just as heartfelt and powerful as any told in books or movies.  The forces that strive to separate them, drive them out of their home in Virginia, pressure them, whatever, just don't succeed.  It's a fascinating look at our country under apartheid and its growth out of it by activists who could find legitimate cases challenging our legal and moral views.

Aside from the politics, the love story soars.  At the end, it will make you weep for a soul mate if you haven't been blessed to find yours yet.",1181520000,21,1157,4.466666666666667
777904,5,6304091192,This was a powerful TRUE love story and much more. It was well acted and stayed true to the real story.  My wife and I owe a debt of gratitude (to say the least) to Mr and Mrs Loving. We were Married in Louisiana in 1994. I am white and my lovely wife is black. I highly recommend this movie.,1176681600,18,292,3.8666666666666667
777905,3,6304091192,I had been doing research on interracial relationships/marriages and came across the Lovings. They pretty much were the final straw that helped do away with interracial marriages being illegal in the south (it happened in June 1967 which is a crying shame that it took that long). This movie was pretty good. Tim Hutton always does well in his acting and Lela Rochon was OK. It was a rather quick movie and it told the basic lives of Richard & Mildred Loving and what they had to go through because they were a black and white couple and got married in the south. I recommend seeing this movie if you have an interest in the interracial struggles of those who fell in love and did what they wanted against the odds and prevailed.,1175040000,5,729,4.488721804511278
777906,5,6304091192,"This is truly a powerful movie.  There are many people that need to watch this movie.  So that they can understand that it is wrong to try to keep two people apart just because of their race.  Mr. Loving truly loved Mrs. Loving.  He did not see color.  He saw her as a woman he loved.  Their love overpowered adversity.  It doesn't matter what nationality you are.  If you love someone.  Then whose business is it.  But the two individuals involved.  It is wrong to say that God meant to separate the races of people.  Mrs. Loving truly loved her husband.  It was good that she wrote the letter explaining their situation which brought the Attorney into their life.  It was their right to be married.  The racial harmony in Central Point, Virginia was beautiful.  But not allowing two people of different races to marry was definitely unconstitutional.  I would love to see the different races come together and try to be at peace with one another.  We currently have a war going on and many men of different races are being killed trying to bring about peace in Iraq.  I'm getting away from the movie.  Just wanted to make my point.  President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. died trying to bring equality among the people.  Mr. and Mrs. Loving was a very powerful and moving movie.  Timothy Hutton and Lela Rochon were excellent in their role as Mr. and Mrs. Loving.  It's no one's business as to the race or the ages of two people that love one another.  As long as one is not involved with a minor.  Love should have no boundaries.
