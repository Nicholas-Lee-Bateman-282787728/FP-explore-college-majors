8312136,3,B001J85GLU,"first off i want to say that i believe there are two types of musicians. the players, and the learners. learners being the type who spend more time learning theory than they do actually playing. which is where i would put this guy. he seems to know a lot but his knowledge of the theory far surpasses his ability to play bass. another thing i noticed is that this guy is obviously primarily a guitar player who is just taking what he knows and trying to cash in off the bass market as well. but i don't want this to sound like a bashing. this is a decently presented instructional dvd that does present some good information. but if i were to recommend a bass instructional dvd to someone i would be quicker to suggest others that were written by acutal bass players.

there is a ton of scale information here just as advertised. but the sections tend to just bleed together one after the next. so to make sense of it all you will probably be watching this video over and over or just giving up on it.",1302998400,4,1001,4.296296296296297
