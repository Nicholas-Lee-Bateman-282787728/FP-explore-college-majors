5402048,5,B004MNGSWK,One of the best martial arts films I have seen in a long time. The final battle was amazing,1463184000,,91,3.8421052631578947
5402049,2,B004MNGSWK,"I wanted to like this, I really did but in the end I was glad it was over. Very disjointed plot. Not actual flashbacks, more like flashback-foward- further back. Really only the little girl was like-able. Most of the characters I could have dropped off a cliff and no one would have cared. Some decent fight scenes. More often than not the fight's weren't just wire-fu (which I can dig) They where superhuman, over done drag it out bad wire-fu. The final fight I just wanted it  to end.
  Ton's of symbolism with no real reference as to where it comes from. I was hoping the guy whose heart was needed by his cruel, evil, greedy, A***e brother would just die already and he was one of the good guys!
  If you can get it on the cheap than sure check it out. I picked up a copy at Biglots for 3 bucks and felt cheated.",1505088000,,816,4.205128205128205

5402065,4,B004MNGSWK,"Kill Zone 2 is not very similar to Kill Zone 1 outside of it's determination to be the biggest downer action movie out there. The original title in Chinese refers to the worst combination of symbols you can get in Chinese astrology. They go all out here.

The basic plot is about a guy who helps a bunch of really bad people cause his daughter is going to die without medical treatment. It puts him on a collision course with a Hong Kong cop and his nephew. Along the way, you meet human traffickers, organ harvesters, murders, gang bangers, Triad members, rapists, etc. It's all good action movie fodder.

The main reason to watch the movie is the fight sequences. They are all pretty good. They're not quite based in reality. They got a lot more of that old HK wire and Japanese anime flair to them. It doesn't cause any huge issues as they still feel really visceral. I expected this from the director of Dog Eat Dog, Motorway, and Accident and the wire/anime aspects caught me off guard. They aren't a bad thing. Just an interesting and unexpected quirk.

The blu-ray looks really good and I had a lot of fun with this. Definitely worth getting your hands on.",1479427200,,1163,4.502369668246446

5402111,3,B004MNGSWK,"Kill Zone 2 is a martial arts action thriller featuring illegal human organ harvesters, a corrupt prison warden, and lots of knife-proficient bad guys. Kit is an undercover cop whos ingratiated himself into the inner circle of human organ-trafficking crime boss Hung Man-keung, turning into a drug addict in the process. When Kit gets too close to revealing the identity of the crime boss, his cover is blown. Double-crossed and under a false identity, hes thrown into a Thai prison, where a guard conveniently discovers the new inmate is a bone marrow match for his dying daughter.

For an 80-minute action flick, theres far too much plot in Kill Zone 2. And though the title suggests a sequel, its actually a stand-alone picture that features only one minor character from 2005s Kill Zone. Though the action takes a while to ramp up, once it begins, it is elaborately staged, fast, and thrilling to watch. With so many movies these days reliant on computer-generated images, its fun to see some good old-fashioned martial arts mayhem.

A highlight occurs toward the end of the film in which theres a two-against-one hand-to-hand fight in a Hong Kong high rise. The editing here expertly matches the moves of the actors, resulting in a veritable martial-arts ballet, with the sounds of bodies crashing and grunts contributing to the illusion that these guys are going at it for real. There are far too many coincidences, but plot is secondary to the fights, which definitely deliver in excitement.

Bonus extras on the unrated widescreen Blu-ray release include deleted scenes, trailer, and making-of behind-the-scenes featurette. The film is in Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai, with English subtitles and English dub options.",1469232000,2,1724,5.1063829787234045

5402114,5,B004MNGSWK,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Actor/action star Tony Jaa continues to impress me with each new film he releases.  I never get tired of seeing what he can do, and he tackles each role with zest and intensity.  Such is the case with KILL ZONE 2, a film released this week from Well Go USA.  Jaa once again wows with his propensity for bone-breaking fight scenesbut this time, we get to see a more emotional side of the talented martial artist as well.  This makes KILL ZONE 2 a well-rounded and entertaining action flick.

This is one of those films you can watch over and over, just to relish in the high intensity action.  While the fight choreography never gets too outrageous, its still crazy fun to watch regardless.  And the best part is that you don't have to watch the first film to know what is going on in this one.

KILL ZONE 2 is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The production value appears high, and the filmmakers do a great job of putting the film together as a whole.

The acting is very good, with Jaa portraying the main character.  He is joined in a co-leading role by Wu Jing, who is an action icon on the rise.  Both men do a great job with their parts.  They are supported by Simon Yam and Louis Koo to round out a stellar cast.

The story in KILL ZONE 2 is emotionally charged and full of tension.  I like how it makes the characters more than just two-dimensional fighting machines. But when combined with the action, the result is pure gold.  You cant ask for much more out of an action picture.

KILL ZONE 2 is great on every level, and I highly recommend it.  The film is available now in a variety of formats, so give it a look.",1469059200,8,1702,4.2625

For some reason there just don't cut out the organ, put it in an ice cooler and travel around the desert for a few days like in US films. In a subplot, Chai (Tony Jaa) is a Thai prison guard whose daughter has leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant. He is given money by his warden to help her.

Kit is discovered as a plant and winds up in the same prison as our two protagonists collide as enemies. Meanwhile there is a rich man who needs a heart transplant and his brother is the only person in the entire world who can supply him with one. Needless to say this all ties in together.

Chai is torn between doing what is right and saving his daughter's life. While the film has tons of action, it hasn't lost its oriental touch of combining ethic complexity into the script. I liked what they did with the relationship of Kit, Chai, the telephone, and coincidences.

5402158,4,B004MNGSWK,"This film has everything going for it except a way to keep things simple enough that the subtitles explain everything.  This film hardly does this, and I spent a lot of time guessing who was who and doing what for why.  High quality production all around.  At least 200 fight stunts....or more.  Story lines never got ""compelling"" for me....always figured the various endings and resolutions -- no surprises.  Sometimes too talky, sometimes too long to almost boring fights extended by marked discontinuities that had the seriously harmed heroes again and again come back to consciousness in the nick of time....it got to be a bother.  Still, it earns the four stars the hard way -- these stunts cost a lot of folks some serious bruising.  Nice.  But, I won't watch this again, and that's why it doesn't get five stars. Okay, four and half stars, but I don't like this style of fighting that much.",1463184000,7,897,4.741935483870968

The prison warden is a major league bad guy. It was sub-titled and not hard to follow and I don't think Ive seen a fight in a passenger ship terminal since sometime in a 1940s movie.

I don't mind subtitles, but my wife doesn't like it. I wouldn't care except that the the description for the audio language is totally incorrect and there is not even an English setting in the options.

Luckily Amazon did grant me an exception to the ""No refunds after starting"" rule.",1528156800,,358,4.578125

8548919,5,B004MNGSWK,"So much more brutal, exciting and interesting than the first Kill Zone (2005), and featuring multiple excellent martial artists!

Kill Zone (2005) was about revengemean revenge.  Now, ten years later director Pou-Soi Cheang (The Monkey King 1-3) escalates the plot to the black market organ trade.  But much as the Fast and Furious sequels expanded their family values and geographic coverage, this sequel accordingly spans Hong Kong to Thailand and includes more family ties than its predecessor and that sense of blood ties urgency is strong here.
Chan Kwok Chung (Simon Yam; Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, Ip Man 1-2, Kill Zone) and his nephew Kit (Jing Wu; Wolf Warrior, Kill Zone) get caught up with organ traffickers who run a Thai prison and incarcerate Kit.  Our boss bad guy is in need of a transplant from his unwilling brother.  Chatchai (Tony Jaa; Ong-Bak, The Protector, Furious 7) needs a transplant for his little daughter, and he works with her godfather as guards in the Thai prison.  Oh, and the organ harvesting prison warden Ko Hung (Jin Zhang; Pacific Rim Uprising) is apparently an all-star ninja assassin in a three-piece suit.  With all this going on it should come as no surprise that the plot gets complicated.

Much as I found Kill Zone (2005) to outweigh its martial arts with drama, so follows part 2 for most of the first half of the film.  This had me worried at first.  Both are very gritty mainstream crime movies that are more about the crime-fighting than the kung fu fighting, except part 2 lets the kung fu (and muay thai) shine in the second half.  Instead of just bullet-ravaged bodies in firefights, we have guns disarmed in close-quarters, leading into modernized Asian action: kung fu while wearing suits because they offer such great mobility!

And speaking of martial arts, I felt that Tony Jaas acrobatic stunt talents were a bit underutilized, and his combat action and choreography in Furious 7 (2015) felt more exciting even if not technically richer or more stunt-heavy.  But lets be clear.  I really enjoyed the action in this movie.  When the fights fired up, the combat was richer with grappling and stabbings than part 1 (which was more classically techniqued).

Like its atmosphere, the fight scenes mix the style of chaotic street brawls and classic kung fu cinema; even the action photography and editing fit this notion.

The best fights are saved for the end. The tonfa-knife fight in the lobby was great, and the final fight brought together the three best fighters in the film for a long, drawn out, wire-work spectacle during which Jaa appropriately explodes into a whirlwind of knees and skull-cracking elbows.  However, everyone gets their moments (and a LOT of them).  Which brings me to the notion that, much to my surprise, this was not a Tony Jaa movie.  This was a Jaa-Wu-Zhang triple showcase.

I appreciated the more visceral action, the amusing chaos of the prison riot, and the fact more than just one hero and one villain were able to brandish their skilled flare.  In my opinion, way better than part 1 and well worth owning.",1515974400,,3112,4.843100189035916

8548922,4,B004MNGSWK,"When an undercover cop gets too close to revealing the mastermind of a drug syndicate, his cover is blown. Double-crossed and under a false identity, he's thrown into a Thai prison, where a guard discovers the inmate - claiming he's a cop - is a bone marrow match for his dying daughter...and his warden may have an even deadlier operation hidden within the prison walls. That is the description you are given, I don't want to tell you anymore because it is just so good and I would actually go for 4.5 stars if I could. Let me say that for the fight scenes alone this is worth the viewing. If you like action and lots of adventure this is another one for you. I do like Tony Jaa""s fighting style and it really works here. I love the bad guys being this bad and the good guys being somewhere in the middle. This is without a doubt a wonderful movie that if you love this type of fighting action....take this one and run to a TV.",1507766400,2,928,4.248587570621469
