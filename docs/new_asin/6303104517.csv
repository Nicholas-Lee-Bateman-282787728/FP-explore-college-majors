The only thing I didn't really aprove of were the tanks. With a name like Tank Police, you'd expect there to be some really cool tank designs, but the action made up for it. The action is very intense and exciting. Seeing a tank jump on to the wing of a plane was so cool. I just wish U.S. Manga would put more thought into the subtitles. The subtitles were so small and hard to read. That aside, I really like this title and I will propably buy the DVD.",978739200,,598,4.033613445378151
