8505257,3,B006W00B9M,"BEWARE!  I suspect this is a PAL/All Regions.  I received it from a US seller (Shepherdsville, KY), not one hour ago, and my NTSC/Region 1 DVD player (Panasonic) instantly displayed the message, ""Cannot Play.""  It did, however, play on my HP computer.  This was NOT disclosed anywhere, on Amazon.  This had not been reviewed by anyone before, and listed a US seller.  An good Michael Caine movie that I'd seen before and wanted.....but terrible seller disclosure.",1455062400,3,463,5.026315789473684
