8330341,4,B001OBT3E8,"Before you buy, be advised that this a documentary, not a full length ballet.  It follows the Paris Opera Ballet as Nureyev sets Raymonda for them.  It is almost all behind the scenes studio work.  After the initial setting of the ballet, the documentary follows a resetting ten years later.  At this point, the producers seamlessly weave clips from different dancers performing the same roles and their coaching of the younger dancers.  If you know what to expect, you'll love it.
