8647108,5,B00J0EE8R8,"We feel compelled to watch this film because it's yet another under-appreciated Noir. Why else? Dan Duryea, Sterling Hayden, Murder, Deception. It has some familiar qualities that work in its favor (some Maltese Falcon, some Woman in the Window). It also has a weakness - namely the silly detective and his ridiculous side-kick obsessed with fixing the car brakes. Hayden's not in his best element, but he's there. Duryea is great as usual, and it's unbelievable that the cops find his story, well, believable. The female lead is for once not a femme fatale, but still not an Angel (perhaps a bit of a Fallen Angel). Overall, it's good Noir and worth it for fans of Duryea.
