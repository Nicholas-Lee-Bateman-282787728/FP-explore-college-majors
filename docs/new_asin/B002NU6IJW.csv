8375447,1,B002NU6IJW,"If this is a ""documentary"", then every amateur U-tube video should also be called a ""documentary"".  It is about that quality.  All this amounts to is a few (very few) shots of some guys going down trails, almost no dialogue or explanation, and some heavy rock music - for 9 (nine) minutes!!  The whole DVD is 9 minutes in length !!  Almost no substance.  So you spent over a dollar a minute, plus shipping, watching something of a quality you could have filmed yourself on almost any bike trail around.",1263513600,4,502,4.533333333333333
