2618276,4,B000GTJSLW,"Rude, crude, and sometimes lewd... yet consistently hilarious and righteously reasonable. Never before have sacred cows such as gun control, the Endangered Species Act, and, yes, even circumcision been slaughtered so gleefully.

2618277,4,B000GTJSLW,"I agree with what everyone has been saying- Season 3 is the weakest, but still great.

The college episode was all over the place- but you gotta love that ""hip hop dance instructor""

and why bring nobel prize winning physicists on to talk about ghosts? Penn even joked about that, but they need to start taking on things that aren't so obviously BS- it's the third season!",1165536000,,372,4.537313432835821
2618278,5,B000GTJSLW,"P & T get better with each season. Its amazing the freaks that they end up interviewing on their show. Season three tackles such bs as life coaching, college, ghostbusters, gun control, religious fundamentalism, etc. If you're a P & T fan then you're going to like this season.",1165017600,,277,4.673469387755102
2618279,5,B000GTJSLW,"This season is right up there with the other two.  The episode on circumcision was one of the most uncomfortable things I have ever watched on TV.  It was uncomfortable because they were RIGHT!!!  Any circumcised man who sees this will want to go and punch his parents right in the face.  It is a story that had to be told and should be shown to all parents contemplating circumcision.  As for the other episodes, like the Boy Scouts...BRAVO...Its about time someone stood up to them.  I am going to guess that the others didn't mention this episode because they are still working on their merit badges.  Anyway, it continues to get better and I can't wait for future episodes.",1160092800,16,677,4.591666666666667
2618280,5,B000GTJSLW,"I believe that this is definatly one of the best seasons that goes in complete line with the brilliance of the last two seasons. The episode on guns was my favorite (any show that brings on revolutionary war reenactors has to be awesome).  All of their straight talk follows with new absurdities to laugh at. Sure their were some moderately good episodes, that dose nothing to take away from the pure greatness of this season

this is a must buy for fans of the show!",1158796800,4,467,4.482352941176471
2618281,4,B000GTJSLW,"So far, I've really loved Seasons 1-2 and while I enjoyed their 3rd Season, I didn't enjoy this quite as much as the other two.  They are still funny, but I just wasn't quite as captivated this season around.

Here is a list of some of the topics they talk about: Circumcision, Conspiracy Theories, Hair, Gun Control, Signs From Heaven and Life Coaching (to name a few).  The one thing I really love about them (apart from being funny), is that they are honest and tell it like it is.  You can't watch this and disagree much with them because they more than not, make total sense.  I like the fact that they are blunt and yet they don't shove it down your throat; they just say what they've got to say and hope you'll think about it.

Give this a go.  I think you'll find it as entertaining as I did because you know they are right.  I highly recommend this DVD.  It's classic.",1156809600,22,877,4.266666666666667
2618282,4,B000GTJSLW,"I'm going to say this right now and get it out of the way: The third season of Penn and Teller: Bulls***! is definitely the weakest.  It seems that they had hit a bit of a dry spell, and some of the topics weren't as interesting as they seemed, while some seemed to be rehashes of earlier episodes (Ghostbusting being the prime example).  The good news is that despite the somewhat weaker episodes, the show is still highly entertaining (Penn and Teller are as hilarious as ever), and things pick up again in the fourth season.

For the uninitiated, Bulls***! is a show where Penn Jillette and his partner Teller research concepts, many of which are taken for granted to be true in society, and thorougly discredit and mock them.  Using humor, sarcasm, and most of all, well-researched facts, the duo attempts to show people that not everything is as it seems.  Some of the better episodes this year (many of which were at the level of quality that has been established in previous seasons) deal with Signs from Heaven, The Best, Hair, Conspiracy Theories.  For example, in the episode about Hair, Penn and Teller discuss why having hair shouldn't be as important as Americans make it out to be.  Furthermore, they question why haircuts can cost so much when they interview a stylist who is known to cut the hair of celebrities, and charges exorbitant amounts of money for the service.  Hair-care products are attacked, and we also are treated to a bit on the comb-over, wherein it is both mocked and praised when a colleague displays his own comb-over, which truly deserves praise as the world's greatest.  In the episode called The Best, Penn and Teller talk about why people's pursuit of having ""the best"" can often lead to bad results, especially an insatiable obsession.  One man they interview is nuts about palm pilots and buys pretty much every new model so that he can have the ""latest and greatest"".  Seeing as how new models come out very often, he is throwing away a lot of money to upgrade to a new model when the improvements are almost non-existent.  Sometimes in the show, Penn and Teller show their disgust for what certain people are saying or doing.  In previous years, they've accused mediums (people who claim that they can talk to the dead) of conning grieving family members.  This year, they attack conspiracy theorists who say that 9/11 is a hoax and a religious couple who are actually profiting off of their comatose daughter by selling merchandise claiming to be a miracle.  At these times, Penn and Teller drop the humor and implore the audience and their subjects to see the error of their ways.

After two nearly perfect seasons, a drop in quality was inevitable, and it occurred this season.  The episode about College was a little hard to follow at times and didn't make sense (though maybe I'm just a little biased because I am currently a college student).  The Life-Coaching and Circumcision episodes were also a little out there.  There were other episodes that may have been good overall, but displayed a few segments that didn't seem to fit.  However, a bad season of Penn and Teller is still very enjoyable and is better than a lot of other stuff on television these days.  Fans of Penn and Teller will enjoy these episodes very much, if not as much as earlier (and subsequent) seasons, but people who have never viewed the show should try to see it on TV before buying (assuming you have Showtime).  The show is full of profanity and even nudity (usually gratuitous) and may be offensive to some people.  Also, some people may find some of the subjects to be offensive.  While I enjoyed the episode about Family Values and the ""traditional family"", I can definitely see how certain people would find it offensive and even horrifying.  As for the Signs from Heaven episode, let's just say that not everyone gets Showtime.  Still, if you don't mind a little cursing and nakedness, you should definitely check out Penn and Teller: Bulls***!",1153180800,48,3978,4.728985507246377
2618283,5,B000GTJSLW,"The third season in a series that debunks myths and half truths and just plain utter sillyness about certain aspects of life that we may just take for granted. It's absolutey hilarious and right on the mark in offering the other side's opinon based on a variety of science and expert accounts on a whole range of topics.

Warning. If you don't like blatant openness of sexual inuendos towards the female body, foul language and demeaning comments then you might want to think otherwise. This is a non-politically correct documentary sieres.",1359590400,,540,4.934065934065934

2618286,5,B000GTJSLW,"My Dad absolutely loved this gift. He had originally known Penn & Teller from vegas as performers but not from their Bull**** series. They were in great condition, the content was awesome and we all had a fun time watching it.",1252713600,,226,4.536585365853658

2618289,5,B000GTJSLW,"A lot of the shows are good and informative. Some would be better if longer and some are so, so. Worth the price. This is entertaining and informative at the same time.",1194307200,,168,4.28125
2618290,5,B000GTJSLW,"I've read some of the other product reviews claiming that this season was a disappointment, and I'm afraid I have to disagree. Penn and Teller did seem to take a temporary step back from the truly devisive issues, but every episode is still insightful, funny, and fascinating. Yes, even that one on hair (I mean, did anyone else actually WATCH that? There was some pretty horrifying footage. If you've never seen someone get a Brazilian wax before, this is a real ""eye"" opener. Ick!)
I don't always agree with Penn and Teller--I've read plenty of critisism of their techniques--and they do seem to interview a lot of people from the loonatic fringe to help them make their point; but they are always articulate, and even when I strongly disagree, I still enjoy their point of view and I appreciate their endorsement of independent thought.
There aren't enough of us out there willing to questions what we see on TV or read in the paper. Sometimes it's painfully disillusioning to know that recycling isn't the environmental salvation I thought it was, or that the only thing protecting us from Big Brother is our innate human incompetence. But I'm glad I made this purchase. It was worth every penny.

Oh, and this is something that irritated me when I was looking to buy this series on Amazon: I couldn't find an episode list for the season, so I'm including one in my review.

Disc 1:
Circumcision
Family Values
Conspiracy Theories
Life Coaching

Disc 2:
Holier Than Thou
College
Big Brother
Hair

Disc 3:
Gun Control
Ghostbusters
Engangered Species
Signs from Heaven

2618291,3,B000GTJSLW,"It hardly needs to be said that television is rife with nonsense.  My cable provider is kind enough to send me broadcasts of televangelism, infomercials, and FOX News 24 hours per day.  PBS is usually good, but when they need money they roll the Deepak Chopra tape.  Ugh.  I get another channel that features shows about psychics and makeovers.  And it's called The Learning Channel!

So Penn & Teller are providing a much-needed service.  I particularly enjoyed the first two seasons because P&T focused their energy on targets that are both widely believed and thoroughly bogus.  Examples include ghosts, creationism, and animal rights extremism (PETA).  Most of the major media continues to handle these issues delicately, as if there were two legitimate sides to the story.  There aren't, and P&T deserve credit for telling it like it is.

However, as other reviewers have pointed out, the material seems to be getting a little thin in the 3rd season.  It's a little too easy too attack positions that hardly anyone believes (like the extreme version of gun control that is the focus of one episode).  And issues like the Endangered Species Act don't really seem worthy of their talents.  It may be a dumb piece of legislation, but the episode (complete with a wheelchair-bound woman who is purportedly homeless as a result of the ESA) comes off as a little hysterical.  Some of the topics are pretty similar to ones they have already covered.

For better or worse there is no shortage of BS for them to focus on, and I'm still looking forward to the fourth season.",1183680000,3,1569,4.820224719101123
2618292,1,B000GTJSLW,"I do not watch television on a schedule, so I miss a lot of programming.  It is good that television shows are available on disk now.  And it is handy for review later.  Penn & Teller use scientific facts to support, or destroy common beliefs and opinions.  This is good.",1178928000,,271,4.36
2618293,3,B000GTJSLW,"While not as spectacular overall as the first two seasons, this is still a lot of fun.  My lament is that the discs are all single-layer, thus the shows are squeezed down to half the size they should be.  Not grotesque, but if you have a large TV you will notice compression artifacts.",1171843200,3,285,4.3584905660377355
2618294,4,B000GTJSLW,"This is my first exposure to Penn & Teller's wit, and it was wild - like sticking your head out the car window into a tornado.

Penn&Teller use humor, righteous outrage and sarcasm to attack some truly soft-headed people whose ideas that continue to pulsate in the national psyche. Whether they be 9/11 conspiracy nuts, people who see Jesus in their bathroom door or supposedly-scientific ghost trackers, P&T go after them mercilessly and called them out as charlatans, frauds or fools. Actually, they don't do this exactly, since they'd be in trouble with the slander police. In order to demolish the reputations of those they dislike, they call them (loudly) *ssh*oles and f*ck*rs. If this kind of vituperative name-calling is not your cup of tea, at least you  have been warned.

I like the work that P&T do. There are far too many people making a buck at the expense of truth. Whether you're peddling a book claiming that the moon landing was a hoax, or selling tickets a the Dallas, Texas JFK Conspiracy Museum, or (as with the Dalai Lama) trying to get support to re-establish a priestly autocracy, you are an idiot or a scammer and deserve to have P&T come after you hammer and tong.

Some criticize P&T for using the same techniques that their targets use. I was more bothered by P&T's attacks on humble people of genuine faith. The poor woman who sees Jesus's eyes in her bathroom door may be wrong, but at least she doesn't appear to be profiting monetarily. That's unlike the woman who found an image of the Virgin Mary in her grilled cheese sandwich, who made a few bucks when she sold the sandwich to a casino. Audrey Santo's family may be faking the ""oils"" that drip from the statues in their brain-damaged daughters' room, but they are living with a real family tragedy and deserve some measure of restraint. P&T use these examples unfairly to attack religion as a whole. They can spout atheism if they want, but they could be less abusive to those with genuine faith. And who's to say that God *doesn't* speak through sandwiches, bathroom doors and tacos? Is he limited to whirlwinds and burning bushes?

That said, BS Season 3 is fun and challenging. Even when P&T go over the top, they provide plenty to ponder.",1169769600,2,2229,4.676020408163265
2618295,4,B000GTJSLW,"What can I say? I really enjoy the series, and while I did disagree with them on a few episodes, I still enjoyed the season. I didn't give it a glowing full rating not because we disagreed. We have a right to disagree, and really, if you're never exposed to viewpoints that challenge your own, your mind becomes really really narrow. I just thought the subjects they tackle weren't as fun, so some of the episodes weren't as fun. Most, however, were pretty enlightening, at least.",1168300800,2,480,4.593023255813954
2618296,3,B000GTJSLW,"I'm a huge P&T fan, but unfortunately this endeavour is getting stale.  Most of the topics didn't interest me (although I'm sure that's not the case for everyone).  More on bogus medical treatments and fraudulent claims (such as the Q Ray bracelet... dodgy advertising such as for ""Head On"", which avoids fraud by not making any claims) would be better.  ""The Best"" and ""Family Values"" didn't really provide any ""content"".  I'd like to see less ad hominem attacks on the participants (even if they do sometimes seem to deserve it) and more emphasis on thinking lapses, lack of ethics, and superstition.  If there's another season, I hope they step back and try to hit their earlier stride.  I saw there's another professor who uses this to teach critical thinking (the profanity makes me reluctant to bring it into the class, but I admit passing along their arguments and a recommendation to view these to my own students!).  If you're a fan already, you might like it.  I wouldn't suggest this title to anyone not already interested in their work.",1168128000,3,1048,4.815642458100559

Season three was basically Penn saying ""Take a look at these idiots."" There are a few things in season 3 that ARE informative, but most of it is either obvious ""Wow, you mean God ISN'T showing up in grilled cheese?"" or opinionated ""Hey, I never finished college, and now I'm rich!""

2618302,5,B000GTJSLW,"Ok, I am not impressed easily; but this show impressed me tremendously. Penn and Teller in my opinion are the smartest, most straight forward and blunt people on Television today, actually in all of television history! They take on subjects that America holds near and dear and basically PROVE that it's Bulls**t. You would have to be a very uneducated and sheltered person to not see and agree with what Penn and Teller present. They take cold hard facts combined with statistics, science and expert testimonials to debunk the topics they choose. Are they crude? Yes. Are they offensive? Yes. But that is the genius of the show. People do not respond to things that are not right in front of their face...they make people look at the reality of the situation. The bottom line is people who think this show is bad or wrong and who do not ""get it"" are the very people that buy into all the BS the show is trying to reveal. Any educated person cannot disagree with the facts this show presents and its presentation is shocking enough to make people wake up. I think it should be required viewing in schools, in the work place, in colleges, hell...everywhere! Penn and Tellers basic theory on all of their shows is the majority of people in this country are VERY miss-informed and naive and this is sadly all too true. Most people do not understand how much crap is out there and they believe things that are totally asinine. While the show is very entertaining it is also extremely thought provoking and it makes you really reevaluate your own stance on these issues. The bible episode was pure genius and I make all my religious friends watch it, 3 of which have converted to atheism as an end result. My other religious friends could not even find anything to counteract Penn and Tellers point. That is how good this show is. Watch it...think about it and you'll see how in the dark you have really been. A stand out show, I hope it is on for many many more seasons.",1166832000,,1966,4.540845070422535
