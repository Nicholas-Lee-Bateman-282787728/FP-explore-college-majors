8177480,4,0792840496,I received this one double feature Lake Placid & Python and the Lake Placid works but the Python didn't. Can I get a refund for a movie that doesn't work or send you the single movie for a working one? Please!,1519603200,,209,4.121951219512195

8177483,5,0792840496,Very good western movie.,1442534400,,24,5.25
8177484,3,0792840496,"It's a low-budget film but the Arizona scenery is gorgeous. It was filmed in the North and the South, so you get a mix of the upland trees and low desert cactus areas. The story is a bit short on intelligence and the acting of Clark Gable's son John Clark Gable is a bit awful.

They also have Indians ""Counting coup"" against some dumb settlers in a ridiculous scene.

The Indians are supposedly Cheyenne but the setting is a desert.

The end was just out of nowhere as well.

James Brolin and Richard Roundtree give decent acting performances.

In all, it's not that good.",1426550400,,573,4.471153846153846

8177486,2,0792840496,"A decent B western with James Brolin and Richard Roundtree! It's main draw is the appearance of Clark Gable's son, born shortly have Gable's death, in the 1960s.  He doesn't really look like his Dad, and at this point in his career he needed a few more acting lessons.  Watchable, three-guys-on-the-owlhoot-trail flick.",1344988800,,319,5.115384615384615
8177487,1,0792840496,"WEll, I thought I'd give this one a shot, and wish I could have shot it!  If it was possible to give no stars for a video, this would be it! From the start it's like watching a script read-through, and you can't help  but keep watching with the thought that anything this bad must get better!  It doesn't! If this isn't the one with Clarke Gables son in it, please  disregard this reveiew. Thank you, Botley.",953164800,3,408,4.259740259740259
