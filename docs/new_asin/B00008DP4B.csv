1839377,5,B00008DP4B,"This four-disc set contains all the episodes from the entire run of ""Yes Minister"" -- with one GLARING exception: the one-hour Christmas Special, ""Party Games"", where Hacker becomes PM. (MAYBE that episode will be included in the Box Set of ""Yes Prime Minister"" due Aug. 26; still it would've been better on THIS one, if only for ""continuity"")
Other than that, this is a GREAT box set! The DVD extras are NOT ""plentiful"" but what's there IS enjoyable. I liked the ""Brief History of 'Yes Minister',"" where it is revealed that the ""Communications Roon / Booze Room"" was based on an ACTUAL UK mission to the Middle East! Although the creator did not reveal  specifics, he said that MANY of the story ideas were based on ""leaks"" from real senior officials in Whitehall!

1839378,5,B00008DP4B,"Yes minister is truly the best political comedy series ever created for the TV (or the movies for that matter).
British humour at its very best..
The true strength of the series is the truth behind the jokes. Everything the script and the characters imply during the episodes is ideas and scandals taken from real live politics. Especially when referring to the dubious role of English Foreign Office regarding the EU is hilarious but absolutely true. To quote from the series itself ""For the past 600 years the foreign policy of England has stayed the same, divide and conquer. We are part of the EU so that we can break it from inside"".
One of the true TV Classics of all times.",1052092800,12,680,4.581967213114754

1839462,5,B00008DP4B,"Ill write this review as if speaking to someone who is not an ""expert"" in British sitcoms but is a regular, everyday American guy or girl looking to expand on their experience.
This show has been around for as long as i have known what a television is. Made popular in America in the 80s by PBS, in an import deal which was, curiously enough, started by Owen and Luke Wilson's father, bringing the Flying Circus, (and thus all Britcoms subsequent to it) to America's shore. This is the very pinnacle of dialogical humor. Others say its easy to understand. I consider myself to be reasonably intelligent, and when I first began watching this, it made my brain hurt. It requires a commitment. But the payoff is so great. You get amazingly witty punchlines that are so worth what you put into it.
This is a FANTASTIC series for the political science majoring college student, or anyone probably above age of 16 thats interested in the machinations of political power, mixed with intelligent comedy. (Try doing that in America today, see how far you get!)
This stuff will make your brain hurt, and this stuff will make you smarter for having watched it. And Nigel Hawthorne is simply one of the very best thats ever been. I cant say enough in loving Yes Minister.",1492819200,,1259,4.625

1839647,5,B00008DP4B,"Here it is... the ultimate look at the workings of the highest halls of power.  ""Yes, Minister"" succeeds above and beyond the limits of a sitcom: I would understand if people at first found it to be wordy and rather bland, but if you really listen it is a bitingly accurate portrayal of the inner workings of government: there are the elected officials who want to leave their mark on government, and then there are the career civil servants who do everything in their power to keep things the way they are.
Jim Hacker (Paul Eddington) is elected to be Minister for Administrative Affairs (a fictional department in the British government) and soon finds himself in pitched battle of wills (and words) on a daily basis with his Permanent Private Secretary Sir Humphrey Appleby (Nigel Hawthorne), whose real title should be ""Permanent Obstruction to Change of Any Sort in the Way We Do Things in Government"".  The third man is in this triumvirate is the minister's Personal Private Secretary, Bernard Woolly (Derek Fowlds) who doesn't say much but when he does it is usually funny!
As I say, you want to pay close attention to ""Yes, Minister""... at the heart of this show's success is the chemistry between the three lead characters and the exquisite, wickedly clever dialogue by the show's authors Anthony Jay and Johnathan Lynn.  The writers reportedly had help with plots/situations from one or two informants inside the British government of the day and their off-the-record talk led to some extraordinary comedy moments.  Another triumph is that there isn't a hint of political bias anywhere.  We never know if Hacker is a liberal or a conservative.  This is a show about the workings of government (philosophically something far bigger and greater than mere party politics).  Each episode presents a unique situation to be confronted by the minister and rebutted by the civil servants, but roughly the same thing happens in every episode.  The minister wants to do something (cut down on waste in government/have more women on staff/pass some piece of legislation) that will either leave his mark on government, make him look good, or both... the civil servants will be slightly alarmed and argue against him going forward, only to be met with his determination to march on... eventually something will happen that makes the minister realize his civil servants were right (usually there's been manipulation of certain forces to reach this conclusion) and there is a compromise of goals (with each side thinking they have emerged victorious) or an outright victory (by the minister or the civil servants).  In other words... it is the very essence of government!
Despite definitely looking and feeling like an early 1980s show, this show is truly timeless... there will always be elected officials trying to change things and there will always be career civil servants doing everything in their power to keep things the way they are.  It's up to you to decide which side is right...",1409875200,2,2986,4.977911646586345

Highly recommended for the comedy,  the satire and the political lessons it teaches.",1383177600,5,398,4.764705882352941
1839680,5,B00008DP4B,"Yes Minister is a very witty satire of, primarily, of the British Civil Service and political system (or at least of the time the show ran, which was the early to mid-1980s). However, it is more than that. It also satirizes, though to a smaller degree, other things British such as the class system, education and the arts (of the 1980s). As the show is quite subtle in its humor one does have to have an understanding of its topics to appreciate the series (i.e., role of the civil service in advising political figures, the English educational system, etc.). Hence many who are not familiar with these topics would not be able to appreciate the humor.

The show is extremely witty and quite well written. It is the very epitome of well written satire. The ancient Greek playwright Euripides once said something to the effect that satire, to be truly successful, has to be almost indistinguishable from what it attempting to satirize. Yes Minister, along with the show it evolved into, Yes Prime Minister, manage to hit this nail right on the head. It is as if the writers of this series are Euripides incarnate. Highly recommended for those who appreciate satire and wit at their best.",1380326400,2,1187,4.734299516908212

1839683,5,B00008DP4B,"This show leaves me howling sideways every time I revisit it. There's a tricky but capable balance of clever plots, good characterization, and one-liners as sharp as vinegar. A healthy sprinkling of puns brings it back down to earth and prevents it from becoming too ""high brow."" Figuring politics into the mix is just icing on the cake. This is what true greatness looks like, plain and simple.

The premise for this show sounds mundane, but incredibly strong writing instead transforms bureaucratic busyspeak into an art form. The ne'er-do-good Jim Hacker (Paul Eddington in some of his best work) squares off with the sniveling underling Sir Humphrey (Nigel Hawthorne, immaculate as usual), whose ""gray area"" mentality often makes him more dangerous than a plotting, malicious rival ever could be. Then we have the underdog secretary Bernard, who just can't decide whose side to be on and whose witticisms are delivered brilliantly by the quietly genius Derek Fowlds.

Admirably, this show doesn't actually name parties or point too many explicit fingers. It's so busy analyzing the futility of bureaucracy and the contradictions of politicians that it hardly wastes one breath complaining about reality. This show isn't really meant to be an attack on one particular party, which is rare for any TV show and sometimes especially tricky for a BBC-produced show.

The only sad thing is that politics haven't changed much - in England or America - since this show aired over 30 years ago. If you think about the plots too much, you might pick up on some hints of melancholy...but the writing and delivery are so darn good that this show is more likely to make you belly laugh until you're exhausted.

1839750,5,B00008DP4B,"The great thing about this wonderful series is that it is close enough to the truth to be believable. I was in a public sector job in London at the time this series was produced and I had a first hand opportunity to see some of the interaction between civil servants and politicians. I remember after one meeting a senior civil servant saying ""Well, let's present this to the Minister and see if it appeals to what he likes to call his mind"". Anthony Jay, himself a senior civil servant, had a hand in writing the show, so its provenance is impeccable.

Besides being funny, the acting is wonderful, and the relationship between Paul Eddington as the Minister Jim Hacker and Nigel Hawthorne as Sir Humphrey Appleby is brilliantly realized. The device of having Bernard, a rather naive younger civil servant played by Derek Fowlds, learning the ropes from Sir Humphrey enables the devious means of getting the Minister to bend to the civil servants' will to be explained without becoming cumbersome.

The writers also had the sense not to make it one-way traffic; although Appleby is presented as the wily manipulator and Hacker as the simple party hack who gets his strings pulled, Jim the puppet sometimes finds a way of confounding Sir Humphrey the puppeteer. Those are my wife's favorite episodes- she doesn't like sneaky Sir Humphrey!

A very funny series which can be watched repeatedly and always seems fresh. Don't miss 'Yes, Prime Minister', either, when Jim ascends to the leadership- and Sir Humphrey comes, too, of course. Very highly recommended.",1345766400,4,1558,4.893939393939394

But here he outdoes himself as he tries to maintain his monumental verbal poise, and suppress his vehement indignation when the tables are turned on him to challenge his confident assumption of power over his minister. MInister Hacker is a riot as his face shows how his anxiety over how he is perceived starts to overwhelm him in the face of a threatening criticism by an obnoxious questioner in a committee hearing, and challenging interrogation at number 10---until he can somehow find the strength to fight back. True comedy acting and writing virtuosity all round.",1266624000,4,851,5.085714285714285

After watching the ""Yes, Minister"" and the ""Yes, Prime Minister"" collections I have to say that what the reviews have stated is true. Both are political satire of the highest quality in every respect. All episodes are funny, and a few are belly laugh funny.
Although the series reflect British politics in the eighties, the subject matter is just as relevant today and is applicable to American politics with minor variations. Aside from the governmental and social differences, one characteristic is that there is no ""left"" or ""right"" party. The opposition party is referred to only as the ""opposition"", without expression of ideology. Another is that the media is portrayed as independent, rather than partisan, and intelligent, rather than pedestrian. An added bonus is the honest and humorous insight into the British social structure. I highly recommend the series.

1839817,5,B00008DP4B,"What a delightful comedy series this is even after almost 30 years. The financial calamity engulfing the world at present has exposed much of the machinery of government as countries around the world seek to attribute blame for the credit crunch.

All of which makes this series ever the more timely. As a great fan of Parliamentary knockabout (Questions to the Prime Minister, Spitting Image), I recall this show on a weekly basis even while watching Gordon brown take questions for the House of Commons. For all the talk of permanent revolution which has pervaded the Home Civil Service for well over the 12 years of Labour governments, this show reminds one of how little has changed.

That is not to say that many of the issues raised in the show, such as the number of women in senior positions, have not been dealt with, but to what extent has the establishment, in the form of the Old Boy's Network, been disempowered? How many of the jobs of the top echelons of the Civil Service been given to non-Oxbridge graduates.? The opening up of the London Financial Community to non-graduate traders gave the political system a jolt which encouraged the employment of non-traditional graduates into many fields. What was intended as a bourgeousie expansion became little more than an affectation of upper middle and upper class behaviours and airs as well as aspirations. Private schools attracted many candidates from lower income families who scrimped and saved so that their offspring cound advance up the social and economic ladders.

The relevance of this is clear. Imagine an updated version of this show again written from an insider's perspective. I think it would be very similar although the furnishings and offices would be more expensive as well as expansive.

Yes, Minister continues to have relevance and many of the jokes still find a response from viewers. My son, about to embark on a year long civics course at high school, found it quite funny despite some of the very British comments and with some background explanation.

Perhaps it could be reissued with a special features disc including clips of Westminster Model of government as well as views from interested observers, like unions, think tanks, journalists and MPs.

While the series has been abundantly exaggerated to create the element of comedy, sometimes fact is stranger than fiction.

Paul Eddington is brilliant as Jim Hacker, the Minister of the title. A decent man who is destined to become Prime Minister, but who is greatly hindered by his Permanent Secretary Sir Humphrey Appleby. Appleby, as played by Sir Nigel Hawthorne IS one of the greatest TV comedy characters ever created. A man with only one interest; protecting the Civil Service and its staff. He also ensures that if anything is done by the Minister it is done exactly as the Civil Service wish it to be done, regardless of cost and damage to the Government.

Apart from the casts brilliance and the marvellous scripts, the reason this show is so successful is that it is very close to the truth, as was admitted by the writers many years after the series finished. The writers met and got inside information on the running of British Government departments. So whilst there is some dramatic licence the essence of each episode probably has some basis in truth.

Derek Fowlds plays the lesser role of Bernard Woolley, a slightly innocent Private Secretary, but given some wonderful lines by writers Jay and Lynn. Bernards petty observations contrast wonderfully with the Machiavellian plotting going on between Hacker and Sir Humphrey.

1839847,5,B00008DP4B,"This is a 1980s BritCom that is finally released on DVD.  Yes Minister and its sequel, Yes Prime Minister are simply brilliant satire of politics, manners, social classes, and Britain.  The running gas is the struggle between Jim Hacker, the newly-appointed Minister in the Department of Administrative Affairs, and his senior civil servant Sir Humphrey Appleby, KCB, MVO, MA (Oxon) who is the Permanent Secretary in charge of the department.  Hacker's Principal Private Secretary, Bernard Woolley finds himself as the straight man between the two.

While politicians such as Hacker are elected and their objective is to be  re-elected, they need to show results and accomplishments.  They must show that they are people of action, integrity and leadership.  On the other hand, unelected civil servants live a comfortable life with decent salaries and no penalties for failure or incompetence. As any institutional change would threaten the civil servants' easy life, politicians and civil servants are in a constant conflict. And these conflicts are magnified in this comedy with the politicians losing as often as the civil servants.  The acting is superb.  Paul Eddington plays Hacker; Sir Nigel Hawthorne portrays Sir Humphrey Appleby in his breakthrough performance; Derek Fowlds is Bernard Woolley. Eddington is understated, bumbling, and funny, often prone to diatribes and meaningless political speeches. Sir Nigel excels in creating complicated sentences reflecting his cynical views on government, his obsession to obfuscate, and his upper crust persona.  Derek Fowlds is just there supporting the interaction of Eddington with Sir Nigel and interjecting his linguistic pedantry.

Although, performed (as light comedy by an elegant cast) in the 1980's and in Britain, these portrayals and ideologies are also true today in this second millenium and in the USA.

Most of the facets of the civil service, which undoubtably exist are almost lost here in the US. So this series is a reminder to us all that all politics is not wholly by politicians as the media would have us believe, but the doing is by the unheralded civil servants.

Having all the episodes of the Minister's trials and tribulations in one box jacket is convenient.

The Yes Minister series, starring Paul Eddington, Sir Nigel Hawthorne, and Derek Fowlds, is set in the 1980's. The Minister for Administrative Affairs, the Right Honorable Jim Hacker, MP, is an ambitious minister who has real ambitions to make life for his fellow citizens better. Alas, if it weren't for his Permanent Secratary, Sir Humphrey Applegate, who usually has a different point of view on things, a bit like ""a terrorist and his hostage"" (although neither of them knows who is the terrorist or the hostage). Between the two chairs sits Bernard Wolley, Jim Hacker's Principal Private Secretary.

This series is state of the art comedy. It was created during the early Thatcher years to help beat the excessive power of the civil service that stalles all sorts of innovation for the purpose of ""good government"".

1839851,5,B00008DP4B,"I first happened upon the 'Yes, Minister' series while living in Britain and working in Parliament. How is that for timeliness! Paul Eddington and Nigel Hawthorne (both knighted for their services to entertainment and the theatre, so the official story went -- Maggie loved the show so they both got awards, if you must know the truth) are perfectly matched as the new Cabinet Minister and experienced, somewhat jaded Permanent Secretary, poised to spar over virtually every detail of work together.

The series begins with Jim Hacker becoming a Cabinet Minister for the first time. It proceeds through his gradual process of gaining experience and then surprisingly being elevated to the position of Prime Minister; at the same time, Sir Humphrey Appleby is elevated to the position of Cabinet Secretary (the most senior of civil servants) and the 'Yes, Minister' series graduated to become 'Yes, Prime Minister', made all the more hilarious by virtue of the fact that Jim Hacker becomes PM largely due to a crisis about sausage (narrowly escaping being called an offal (pronounced awful) tube).

Political situations large and small are highlighted throughout the series. The humour shifts from being blatant to being very subtle; the common wisdom about the House of Commons with regard to the accuracy of the programme was that 'Reality is twice as true but half as funny'. The issues of promotions, wages, policies, inter-departmental struggles, down-in-the-dirt politics (British-style) all arise at various points. Sir Humphrey and Jim Hacker win their share of victories over each other, shifting back and forth in their pericoretic movement that typifies politics, from as minor as who has which office, to recognising heads of state and setting election dates.

The duo of Hacker and Sir Humphrey are wonderfully served by Bernard, a faithful PPS (personal private secretary) whose subtle shifting loyalties provides grist for both mills. Those who will be so enamoured of the series that they seek out the printed form will be happy to learn that eventually Bernard becomes Sir Bernard, and is himself eventually Cabinet Secretary. The books of 'Yes, Minister' and 'Yes, Prime Minister' are done in the fashion of diaries, with the neat addition of verbatim letters, photographs, charts, etc., providing a wonderful companion to the series.

This is British political satire at its best. Some of the episodes include:

--Open Government--

In this episode, prior to the usual opening credits we get a shot of Jim Hacker being re-elected to his seat in Parliament. Nervously awaiting the call, he finally gets contacted by the PM to become Minister for Administrative Affairs, a bit of a political graveyard, we are informed. There is his introduced to Bernard Wooley, his Principal Private Secretary, and Sir Humphrey Appleby, the mandarin of the department. They spar, with Sir Humphrey easily manipulating the inexperienced Hacker through near political-suicide in pursuit of his name in the paper. It ends with the words, 'Yes, Minister' -- which is one of the hallmarks of the series.

--The Official Visit--

In this episode, Hacker engineers an unknown African leader's visit to Britain to help the struggling party's by-elections in Scotland, much to the dismay of Sir Humphrey, who would much rather have the visit take place in London (much greater chance to wear medals at a state function). In the end, the African leader turns out to be Hacker's friend from the LSE, who was sharp as a tack then, and turns out to be still a formidible adversary. In the end, Hacker and Sir Humphrey agree to an interest-free loan of 50 million pounds, to keep egg (or, at least imperialist yolk) off their faces.

--The Economy Drive--

Frustrated at every turn with trying to cut expenses, Hacker is persuaded by the manipulative Sir Humphrey that 'economy begins at home' -- so he gives up his fancy office, staff car, and all the perks to get his name highlighted in the paper. When his own car breaks down and he is found face-down in the gutter after a champagne reception at the French embassy, he thinks better of it all, acquiesing to Sir Humphrey's juggling the figures to make it seem as if all is being cut after all.

--Big Brother--

Hacker, as the minister responsible for wiretaps, has been dubbed 'Britain's chief bugger' by the press. Anxious at first to limit the scope of government to eavesdrop, Sir Humphrey informs Hacker that his name is on a death list, and this was discovered by the methods Hacker wants to prevent. After several agonising days of police escorts and protective custody, his security is removed when the terrorists had rearranged their priorities, or, in Sir Humphrey's analysis, 'they don't think you're important enough to kill.' Hacker then welcomes the petition to limit government involvement in wiretaps, saying that, after all, 'ministers are expendable, but liberty is indivisible.'

--The Writing on the Wall--

In this episode, the department is under attack, and not just in the usual political fashion. Sir Humphrey must engineer a way to save both Hacker and the department from becoming the easy budget cut the Prime Minister is in search of; playing on the fear of National Identity Cards inland and Euro-phobic identity abroad, Sir Humphrey and Hacker team up (a rare occasion) when the enemy without seems greater than the enemy within. It ends with the words, 'Yes, Minister' -- which is one of the hallmarks of the series.

--The Right to Know--

In this episode, Hacker has finally had enough of the double-speak and silences Sir Humphrey uses to keep the him in the dark. Ironically, Sir Humphrey floods Hacker with so much information, it is worse than ever. However, when Hacker's political career hangs in the balance over his daughter's protest over a badger colony (the operative phrase would be 'nude protest' at a badger colony), Hacker concedes, once Sir Humphrey defuses the issue, that perhaps there are some things better left unknown.

--Jobs for the Boys--

Sir Humphrey's cronies are looking for Government top-up consultancies; Hacker is looking for sainthood a la St. Francis. When the animal farm he used for a photo opportunity is about to become a carpark on his order, Sir Humphrey uses the opportunity to get his friend a Quango, Hacker's name on the new zoo, and Hacker's political advisor (and Humphrey's greatest pain) a well-deserved and well-removed Quango of his own, in Tahiti.

Sir Paul Eddington and Sir Nigel Hawthorne

Both stars of this incredible, lesser-known series have passed away, Sir Paul several years ago, and Sir Nigel just days prior to this writing. Both were ubiquitous in the London stage, screen, and television during the 80s and 90s. Both were very talented Shakespeareans who had no trouble with comedy subtle and gross. Sir Paul was honoured with a television tribute a very short time ago which gave insight into his true wit and character. Sir Nigel, best known in his later years with the success of 'The Madness of King George', was a modest and unassuming actor, capable of remarkable bits of genius.",1127088000,10,7127,5.039082412914189
1839852,5,B00008DP4B,"I'd beeen hearing about ""Yes, Minister"" for years-how it was Margaret Thatcher's favorite and suchlike-but I didn't get around to watching it until just this  month.  It measured up to expectations, although a couple of things surprised or intrigued me.

One: I guess I didn't realize how /dense/ the social commentary is.  I mean dense in the nicest possible way, as in ""thick on the ground.""  You could run a pretty good undergraduate course in organizational behavior out of this show.  Or rather more likely, You can almost picture the writers lugging a textbook into the hutch with them, and checking off each and every iron law of bureaucracy as they wove it into the script.

[There are snippets of useful background on some easy-to-find websites.]

Two: I knew how funny it was supposed to be, but I didn't know how it was funny.  It is, in particular, a wonderful give-and-take comedy, with Paul Eddington and Nigel Hawthorne in a breathtaking patter act, somewhere between W. S. Gilbert and Tom Stoppard.  It's the kind of thing the Brits do well, and rarely better.  Indeed the only point that puzzles me is why Hawthorne as the bureacrat gets so much credit: Paul Eddington as the minister seems just as necessary and about equally funny.

[Derek Fowlds as the minister's private secretary provides impeccable rhythm and a lot of helpful plot-points, but inevitably he ends up being a bit like the third Stooge, the one whose name you can never quite remember.]

Three: It's worth a moment to reflect on structure.  ""Minister"" is one of those shows built like a Bollywood movie, with the same plot structure in every episode-indeed, virtually always, the same closing line.  After ""Hill Street Blues,"" after ""West Wing,"" it all seems almost terminally primitive: no moving cameras, no overlapping dialogue (though there is some hilarious near-slapstick, almost on the model of Feydeau).  Inevitable; yet it is easy to forget that there is a market for this kind of inevitability.  Think Bollywood again, think Perry Mason.  What a concept: Max Weber meets ""Law and Order.""  In any event, it's a classic: everything about it lives up to the hype.",1123545600,8,2157,4.925207756232687
1839853,5,B00008DP4B,"In one of the special features, Eddington or perhaps Hawthorne, or maybe Fowlds (does it matter? any of the three could have said it) mentions that the 7 years together on the series was so much fun it flashed by in a moment.. I'm sure many people who watched them as they came out on TV remember that time the same way. That so many of them are now dead is tragic to me :(

Er, anyway, the material has hardly aged at all, probably because politics hasn't changed either. Selling weapons to terrorists, the defense budget, taxes, the european community, 24 years later and it is all still fresh, (perhaps excepting some of the union/boss/socialism/strike stuff).

I did notice a couple of continuity problems here and there. I guess on a DVD and a big screen more attention is paid than the producers probably imagined when they filmed it for TV. ""Yes Minister"" also has some charming low budget moments, but overall the video quality is excellent even more so considering the age.

The laugh track also appears to be a live studio audience, at least in ""yes prime minister"" - not the constant stream of fake giggles and laughs you get with US sitcoms.

Anyway this series is really special, and if you are the least bit interested in TV comedy you must get it so that Hawthorne and Co will never age -- at least in your home.",1103587200,9,1327,4.4937759336099585
1839854,5,B00008DP4B,"""Yes, Minister"" is simply the best political satire ever committed to film. The BBC series originally ran on British television from 1980-1982, with one hour-long special in 1984. Jim Hacker (Paul Eddington), a man who could be described as mediocre in all things,  is the Minister of Administrative Affairs. Ever conscious of his popularity with the voters and concerned with his career, Hacker tries to assert his own agenda but finds himself constantly thwarted by the realities of government....in the form of his Permanent Undersecretary of State, Sir Humphrey Appleby. Sir Humphrey (Nigel Hawthorne) is a veteran civil servant and bureaucrat by distinction. His job is to serve the Minister, but his role is to guard the status quo and the welfare of the Civil Service. Jim Hacker promised the voters change; his right-hand man will do anything go prevent it. The results are hilarious as these two try to outmaneuver one another. The Minister's Private Secretary, Bernard (Derek Fowlds), is caught in the middle, from which he never fails to  correct any mismatched metaphors that his colleagues toss at one another.

""Yes, Minister"" mines the English language's large and curious vocabulary to great comedic effect. The characters' sparring and obfuscation are all verbal. I can't imagine how many takes it took to make some of Sir Humphrey's tongue-twisting dialogue intelligible. ""Yes, Minister"" produced more memorable one-liners than I could count.

Writers Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn have assured their place in comedic history. ""Yes, Minister"" was the favorite television program of Margaret Thatcher while she was Prime Minister of Great Britain. In her words, ""Its closely observed portrayal of what goes on in the corridors of power has given me hours of poor joy."" She's not the only one. ""Yes, Minister"" is laugh-out-loud  funny and a sure cure for the blahs brought on by a depressing political climate. If you can't beat'em, laugh at them.

The DVDs: ""Yes, Minister"" originally ran in three series, one per year with 7 episodes in each. They are not arranged on the DVDs in this way, however. Disc 1 includes episodes 1-6. Disc 2 is episodes 7-12. Disc 3 contains episodes 13-18, Disc 4 includes episodes 19-21 and a handful of bonus features: ""Sir Nigel Hawthorne Remembered"" is a 42-minute documentary about the late actor's life and career, produced in 1999. There are interviews with colleagues, and Sir Nigel talks about his childhood in South Africa and his personal as well as professional life. In ""A Short History of Yes, Minister"" (5 minutes) writers Jonathan Lynn and Anthony Jay comment on the basis of the show. There is a 1981 BBC ""Jonathan Lynn Interview"" (3 1/2 minutes). ""The Inner Circle"" provides text bios for the principle cast and writers. ""Lobbyists and Bureaucrats"" are text bios of actors who played supporting roles.",1100908800,34,2865,5.111111111111111
1839855,5,B00008DP4B,"Few television programs stand the test of time. Many age badly, becoming less pleasurable to watch with each viewing. Yes, Minister is the opposite!
When my government is preaching economies and telling us that there is no money for anything, I think of Yes Minister.
When I watch politicians squirm and flap about waiting to learn what to think from the next poll, I think of Yes, Minister.
Each time I watch an episode, it rings more true and relevant. What better compliment can one give a decades old comedy.",1073520000,15,512,4.7
1839876,5,B00008DP4B,"It is high time this outstanding britcom (plus its sequel, Yes Prime Minister) was released in its entirety on DVD, but it was well worth the wait for the BBC has done an outstanding job.  It contains all twenty-one 30-minute episodes (which ran from 1980 through 1982) in a beautifully packaged four-disc set.  The quality of the picture is very crisp and clear for a 20-year-old production (I know I'VE never seen it look so good!), and the DVD extras are a real treat.
This is an intelligent, extremely well-written series--a satire of the inner workings of government.  Sources within the government provided the writers with all the fodder they needed, and it is highly accurate in its depiction of the corruption, politics, red tape, and manipulation that forms an integral part of the administration of government (ANY government, mind you--which is what gives this series such universal appeal).  Indeed, Margaret Thatcher, herself a fan of the series, referred to it as being a ""closely observed portrayal of what goes on in the corridors of power.""
The series opens with Jim Hacker (played by the late Paul Eddington (Good Neighbours), who sadly died of skin cancer in 1995 at age 68), who has just won the parliamentary seat for his riding (his party has won the election), being appointed as the new Minister of Administrative Affairs.  Now that he's in a position of power (or so he thinks!), Hacker has high hopes for making some positive changes--things like instituting an open government policy, linking honours to economies for civil servants, and so on.  But he's thwarted at every corner by he who wields the real power--the cunning, quick-witted, hilariously verbose and extremely manipulative civil servant, Sir Humphrey Appleby--the DAA's Permanent Secretary (the late Nigel Hawthorne (The Madness of King George, Mapp & Lucia)).  Lastly is Hacker's Private Secretary, Bernard Woolley (Derek Fowlds (Heartbeat)).  Bernard is a likeable, pun-loving, unassuming character with conflicting loyalties.  He is himself a civil servant, and though there are times when he'd like to assist Hacker in achieving his goals, he must exercise extreme caution in doing so lest Sir Humphrey find out!
DVD EXTRAS include a splendid 42-minute profile of the late Nigel Hawthorne who, having battled cancer of the pancreas for eighteen months, sadly died on Boxing Day 2001.  He was 72.  The profile was filmed over four months in 1999, during the period when Hawthorne was preparing to play King Lear for the RSC.  The series provides a brief bio with photos and snippets of other productions in which he's been involved.  Derek Fowlds, Helen Mirren (his co-star in The Madness of King George), Jimmy Perry & David Croft (writers of Dad's Army), and Trevor Bentham (Hawthorne's partner of 22 years) all provide contributions, but the vast majority are from Hawthorne himself.  He touches on many of the themes which are elaborated on in his splendid autobiography entitled ""Straight Face""--things like his uneasy relationship with his father and his homosexuality.  The final features are ""A Short History of Yes Minister"" (1999) which features Fowlds, Hawthorne, and series' co-writer Jonathan Lynn (it's only 5 minutes but very informative); and a brief 3 1/2 minute interview with Jonathan Lynn from 1981.  Lastly are text-based bios of the main and many supporting actors.
This lovely collection set is truly a must-have for fans of the series.  It is a unique, extraordinary britcom (a personal favourite of mine!)--one that is sure to appeal to anyone who enjoys the best in British comedy.  I would also, however, recommend it unhesitatingly to anyone simply looking for an intelligent, brilliantly written, and impeccably acted series--British or otherwise.  Highly, HIGHLY recommended!",1069200000,103,3800,5.2
1839877,4,B00008DP4B,"Easily the best BBC comedy available; what a pity the DVD looks no better than a VHS tape. A decent VHS, mind you, but smeary and low-definition like all of them. The sound is OK.
This show deserved better. It deserved the best: the actors' facial expressions are subtle and their British accents require close attention by American ears. Oh well, at least we have them safely on disc, and perhaps better quality was just not available. I bought both sets and enjoy them hugely.",1062547200,16,478,4.635294117647059
1839878,5,B00008DP4B,"""It was three elderly men sitting around a table talking about government.  No action, no women, no sex . . . I don't know how it worked."" -Jonathan Lynn.  Well it did work and anyone who is familiar with this series already knows how brilliant it was and still is.  The new minister of Administrative Affairs (Jim Hacker) arrives believing he can make the system more accountable and cost effective--thus assuring his popularity with his constituency--only to find that the stubborn traditions of the civil service (brilliantly portrayed in the controlling character of permanent secretary Sir Humphrey Appleby) are impossible to budge or too convenient in saving his own neck.  Hacker often appears intellectually challenged; however, he sometimes manages to win a victory or two at the expense of the Sir Humphrey with personal secretary Bernard Woolley always willing to add a pedantic comment. In addition to the 21 episodes, extras include a brief (very brief) history of the show (which left me wanting more), a period interview with writing Jonathan Lynn (why not a recent reflection on the show?), and a lengthy, and very touching biography of Nigel Hawthorne (Sir Humphrey) who passed away in 2001.  The witty political observations in this series are timeless whether one considers British govt., American govt., etc. Minor complaints about the DVD itself is that the volume is rather low and the discs are a little tricky to remove from the case (but worth the struggle, of course). I am looking forward to seeing the Yes, Prime Minister set.",1062028800,7,1554,5.0546875
1839879,5,B00008DP4B,"Though done in the 80's Yes Minister is as fresh and funny as it was 20 years ago! What makes this series great is there isn't a weakness to be found. Nigel Hawthorne is Brilliant as Sir Humprhey and Paul Eddington as the bewildered yet good-intentoned MP James Hacker. Casting was perfect for these roles.
At the same time, the supporting cast was mostly overlooked, including the ""3rd lead"" Derek Fowlds who plays Bernard, the MP's undersecretary who seems torn in allegiance between Civil Service and his MP. While the first season also had some great moments outside of Parliament, later series removed the emphasis on Jim Hacker's home life, which served well early on, but could of weighted down the series as it grew.
Another strength is that the series had no real political affiliation. It didn't matter the issue, it found a way to have fun with it and cause mayhem.
Often Imitated, Never Duplicated. This is the gold standard for Political Comedy.
On the DVD specifics, do enjoy the special on Nigel Hawthorne on the 4th disk. I just hope that they can put together a similar tribute to Paul Eddington on the release of Yes Prime Minister.",1057968000,55,1150,4.72636815920398
1839880,5,B00008DP4B,"This is a real treat for those fans of the British brand of humor with its peculiar emphasis on  understating things. Not to mention Bernard Wooley's jugglery of the English tongue - you might pick up a few latin phrases along the way. All in all - a superb commentary on modern day democracy.

1839881,5,B00008DP4B,"I love Fawlty Towers, but for my money Yes Minister/Yes Prime Minister is the funniest sitcom I have ever seen. While most of the humor is political in nature, you don't have to be a C-Span junkie to get all the jokes. You also don't need a background it the British political system (though it helps) as political corruption is universal. Indeed, this show was a worldwide hit and is being aired somewhere right now!
The U.S. video tapes for this series only included the first seven episodes of this series, so many of us will be seeing 14 ""new"" episodes! If you have those video tapes or have seen this show on public television, what are you waiting for? The video is of high quality and there are no gotchas; it's a wonderful set I'll keep mine for the rest of my life. If you are an anglophile who enjoys the likes of ""To the Manor Born"" or the Ian Richardson ""House of Cards"" trilogy (soon to be released on DVD as well), you will more than likely enjoy this set too. For the rest of you who have never seen this show, just know that it is an incredibly witty (though never silly) look into a well-meaning minister's (Paul Eddington) attempts to reform the civil service and an incredibly clever director of the civil service's (Sir Nigel Hawthorne) attempts to prevent any reforms. Don't let the subject matter fool you, it is never dull and will have you laughing throughout.
While there is a lengthy segment on Sir Nigel Hawthorne including an interview conducted shortly before his fatal condition was diagnosed, I wish there had been commentary on at least one of the episodes from the writers or producers (or even Derek Fowlds, who sadly is the only major surviving member of the cast) just to get a insider feel for the show. No matter; the quality of the video a great and the content is, of course, first rate.
I've checked with the BBC and the ""missing"" one hour ""Party Games"" episode, which came as a Christmas special the year after the final Yes Minister was aired, will be included on ""Yes Prime Minister - The Complete Collection"" scheduled for late August 2003. As this is the episode where Hacker ascends to Prime Minister and as it has never been released in the U.S., this is great news.",1055376000,41,2214,4.523690773067331

You cannot help feeling that the essence of the skulduggery is very true.  I think Maggie Tatcher affirmed that with her comments when awarding Nigel Hawthorn and Paul Eddington their MBE's.  The acting, the humor, the satire are superb.  The supporting guest stars add so much too.  So many times, at the end of an episode I have had a great sense of satisfaction.  A sense of enjoyment not usually felt when watching TV.  I share the sentiments of your reviewer ""cbstar"" about the one hour Party Games episode that seems to have got lost.  I only saw it once but I still see Arnold's tears of laughter when he and Humphrey decide to pick Hacker for PM.  Hacker's speech on the British sausage is superb.",1054512000,4,845,4.573333333333333

50p that  if it WAS, the laughter by the studio audience was prompted, and then sweetened electronically.
Personally, I prefer to supply my OWN laughter.
