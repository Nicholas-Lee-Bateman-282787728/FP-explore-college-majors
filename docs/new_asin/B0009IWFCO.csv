8169303,4,B0009IWFCO,"Hal Hartley is smart enough to use the short-film form to experiment and express his least commercial ideas (not that his features have set box-office records, but whatever) -- instead of to just make short stories.

Because of this experimentation, some of the shorts are abstracted to the point of incomprehensibility... and not in a good way.

The highlights are the martial arts-modern dance fugue thriller THE NEW MATH(S); THE SISTERS OF MERCY, a kind of making-of of an otherwise nonexistant movie (which begs the question whether the outtakes seemed more interesting than the intended footage, or whether SISTERS OF MERCY was always intended as a deconstructionist piece); and the excerpted play SOON, which -- unlike many of the shorts -- has some of Hartley's fine wordplay and some intriguing acting.

Quite different from most of his features, but also with an innate familiar quality that could belong to only one filmmaker.",1120348800,5,936,5.144736842105263
