8726182,2,B012HF6TQY,"Dennis Hopper's other innovation, it turns out, is ""reality t.v.""  It isn't his fault--at least not entirely.  I blame the filmmakers, Kit Carson and Lawrence Schiller.  They somehow managed to make orgies and high powered rifles boring.  As I watched this film I sensed a lonely, sad man who really wanted to work, was thinking about his work and art, but didn't know what to do.  He was famous, and the filmmakers knew it and wanted to capitalize on it.  When this film was re-released, they even said that they staged a lot of this, including the weird idea of bringing in a bunch of young women to Hopper's Taos estate for an orgy (which just as weirdly turns into a Manson-like encounter session).  The sad thing about the film is that, in hindsight, we know that Dennis Hopper was a pretty darned good artist.  We don't get to know that guy.  Instead we get the sensationalistic ""branding"" of Hopper as the so-called wild man of Hollywood.  The hippie burn-out.  The druggie.

This is unfortunate, especially given his enormously prodigious and wonderful output as an artist.  He had a hand in this, of course, but there are moments in the film where we get the sense that Hopper is trying to direct the filmmakers to the art, but they just don't want to go there.  For example, the most poignant scene, to me anyway, is the one in which Hopper is showing the filmmakers his photo collection, which we now know is quite remarkable in its quality and value.  They follow Hopper as he examines the photos displayed on the floor of his Taos home (once owned by Mabel Dodge Luhan).  At one point Hopper turns around and asks them plaintively why they don't film the photos.  It is as if he is reminding them that it isn't the personality that really matters, but the work.

Finally, as a historical document, they blew it (to borrow a phrase).  During the filming of this documentary, or whatever it is, Hopper was editing 'The Last Movie,' which turned out to be an infamous financial disaster for the studio, and the end of Hopper's directing career (at least until 'Out of the Blue,' which predicted his fantastic comeback phase).  The first part of the film spends some time with Hopper as he edits 'The Last Movie,' but inexplicably abandons that process in order to create the sensationalistic scenes that Schiller and Carson apparently preferred.  Wouldn't it be nice to know how Hopper was talked out of the linear narrative that he had originally created?  Wouldn't it have been helpful to ask him about his vision for the film, especially given that his final cut turned out to be a heroic (if flawed) attempt to put abstract expressionism on the screen?  Reality television sucked then and it still sucks.  I'm glad that Hopper the artist got to outlive all this dreck.",1477094400,8,2782,4.6652977412731005

8726186,5,B012HF6TQY,"To hear about this release was wonderful news. For decades it was only available in very poor quality - after all it is an important entry in the history of one of America's greatest artist. Of course the content is a sometimes weird experience, but so were big parts of the 70's in general :). GREAT RELEASE. NICE RESTORATION JOB! (using 4 surviving 16mm prints, the 16mm camera negative was destroyed in a fire many years ago). NOW WE ONLY NEED The Last Movie !!!!",1447027200,14,466,4.4941176470588236
