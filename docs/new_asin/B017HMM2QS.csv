7505233,1,B017HMM2QS,Terrible.  Didn't even watch more than 2 minutes of it.,1457740800,,55,4.5
7505234,1,B017HMM2QS,I didn't make pass the first five minutes.,1457222400,,42,4.375
7505235,1,B017HMM2QS,I so rarely give anything 1 star but this was horrible rubbish!  It looked like a home movie.  None of the plot made sense and the main character spends most of the movie throwing herself around and pretending to be pushed.  They even have her opening & closing doors herself so you can make believe there's something else doing it.  Crazy horse pucky. Some of the worst acting ever.,1457049600,,383,4.507246376811594
7505236,1,B017HMM2QS,"I expected something at least tolerable since checking the IMDB rating of 7.1, but I was fooled.  The story was okay, the acting also okay, but between the almost inaudible regular speaking voices & the screaming volume of everything else I almost turned it off in the beginning.  I wish I had because I could have found something worth watching.  Don't waste your time on this one folks.",1456358400,3,388,4.676470588235294
7505237,2,B017HMM2QS,wasn't the best movie in the world had moments when it got boring so if you are looking for a good movie to watch I do not recamend this one.,1456272000,,141,3.7333333333333334
7505238,4,B017HMM2QS,Classic  movie to me somemay like some may not to eachs own.,1456272000,,60,4.0
8739282,2,B017HMM2QS,"** 2 Stars **  How can you rate a well-made bad film?  OK, so ""House of Afflictions"" has great atmosphere, great sets, decent acting, and is carefully-paced ... a good thing for a (sort of) haunted house flick in the classic British style.  But when all is said and done, the story makes little or no sense, and it is pretty boring in spots.  I don't hate it, but it is a disappointment, and I cannot recommend it to anyone.  Re-runs of  the 1960's 'Dark Shadows' is 10 times more fun.",1501459200,,485,4.274725274725275
8739283,5,B017HMM2QS,A truly haunting movie without all the blood and  gore that most writers think they need. Very well done. Had me holding my breath through most of it.,1463443200,,150,4.357142857142857
8739284,2,B017HMM2QS,"This movie could have been a lot better, but there are severe pacing issues.  Pacing issues lead to boredom, and boredom leads to me turning off the move about 2/3 the way through.",1461715200,,180,4.454545454545454
8739285,4,B017HMM2QS,"This isn't for someone looking for a terrifying horror. I wouldn't recommend paying to watch it, but I was able to stream it for free with Prime. I would give this one 3.5 stars. I was thinking three stars aka ""it's ok"" until the end which bumped it up for me. There were definitely some issues with the plot (aka it's killed people who aren't in the house, but we'll be safe once we get out), and it was very low budget. However, it was a pretty interesting ghost mystery.",1460592000,,473,4.266666666666667
8739286,2,B017HMM2QS,Low budget and a slow story.,1459209600,,28,3.8333333333333335
8739287,3,B017HMM2QS,"The other reviewers are overly harsh on this one. It's an old-fashioned haunted-house story with a small plot twist in the last five minutes. It's clearly a beginner's movie. The plot has a few holes, such as doors that are supernaturally shut but then can open when two people (instead of one) try. And the soundtrack is not mixed well for home viewing insofar as some sounds are very loud but others just as relevant are barely audible (on standard home equipment). But overall it's a good beginning.",1458345600,,502,4.715909090909091
