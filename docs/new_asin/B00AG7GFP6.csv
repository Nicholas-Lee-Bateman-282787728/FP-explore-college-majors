8551287,3,B00AG7GFP6,"This program shows off the unique Solar Impulse aircraft, designed to fly around the world on solar power alone.  The interviews with the very enthusiastic Bertrand Piccard are most entertaining.  (Since this was recorded, the aircraft has successfully crossed the United States; the world flight is scheduled for 2015.)

But I cannot give more than 3 stars to any video that represents such rotten value for money.  $17.95 for 12:29 is unacceptable.  Amazon needs to take $10 off of all of the 60 Minutes video series.  Then I might give it another star.

Note that all of these videos have sound recorded at a low level, and you'll have to raise your volume control substantially.  Be sure to lower the sound level back as soon as the video is over!",1380758400,,751,4.723076923076923
