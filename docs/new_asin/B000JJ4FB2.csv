2671789,5,B000JJ4FB2,"As an avid horror fan for 30 years, I was truly impressed.  I yelled out atleast twice and jumped several times. The scarest scene for me was the stairs, but I don't want to give anything away. I thought the plot and the acting were good enough to be in the theaters.  This movie has earned a spot with my other favorite horror greats. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be scared, or is a horror fan.",1221523200,7,425,4.170731707317073
2671790,5,B000JJ4FB2,"Okay, for two huge horror fans, this movie delivered.  Me and my husband had a hard time getting through this movie.  We had to stop if a few times to get a breather and turn on the lights.  It makes you jump and breathe fast because of sudden scares that keep happening.  It is a true jump out of your seat, when will it happen next, heart pounding scary, etc...movie!!!  Watch it and you will know what I am talking about.",1199577600,9,424,4.185185185185185
2671791,4,B000JJ4FB2,After their daughter is murdered a couple move into an isolated cabin to get away from the city. The problem is that the cabin is haunted. Some of the acting is questionable and the script didn't always flow but for a low budget film it was okay. The woman playing the mother was too young for the part but did an adequate job.,1194825600,7,327,4.2063492063492065
2671792,3,B000JJ4FB2,"Dark Remains is a brave and mostly quite accomplished attempt at a ""Grudge""/""Evil Dead"" style horror film which works at making you jump but is sadly in need of a good script. A couple named Alan and Julie lose their young daughter when she is brutally and unnaccountably murdered in her bed by persons unknown. The distraught couple move out to a remote cabin in the woods to come to terms with their grief, but it turns out that the cabin is not the most peaceful place for them to be, as several of it's former occupants have died mysteriously, and soon the couple are fighting for their lives and their sanity.

Let me say first off that for a low budget independant production (which I think this is), the film has a lot going for it. If you are of a nervous dispositon and don't like being made to jump, then this film could give you nightmares. Once Alan and Julie arrive at the cabin and start getting spooked, the scare scenes never let up. Ghostly faces appear behind every window or mirror, things drop and clatter on the floor unexpectedly and doors and windows keep opening and closing with no warning. It actually gets quite wearing to be constantly waiting for the next ghoulish figure to pop up over someones shoulder or glide down a distant corridor. However, the ghosts, when they appear are spooky enough, and some of the surprises are very well done. Camera work and frame compostion are very nice, although a lot of it, such as close ups and montages of ordinary things like Julie having a shower or photographing an abandoned prison that happens to be next door to the cabin seem to be little more than attractive padding. It almost seems like there is nothing to do but watch the screen for the next ghost.

This brings me to the films major failing. When the ghosts are not on screen, there simply isn't enough happening. And there isn't much attempt to develop Alan and Julie as human beings. The two leads are competent actors but they barely speak to each other. Despite their relationship since the death of their daughter being crucial to the atmosphere, the conversations between the two are limited to mere scraps of words at a time, such as ""I'm going to take more photos"" or ""I don't feel right here"". It's ok that the couple are greiving and not communicating, but as a viewer I needed more insight into their characters to be able to understand their motivations. I could almost see in the eyes of the actress playing Julie the craving to actually have something more significant to say than ""I'm tired"" or ""I don't feel like it"", over and over again. Because of the lack of decent conversations or visible personalities in anyone, the film boils down to being an exercise in looking at spooky imagery without having any involvements with the characters being menaced.

So in some ways the film is a failure, and it is crying out for a script to put some intellectual meat on it's scary bones. They could have also added more in the way of explanations, as the story ends with a lot of plot holes still unexplained. I'd probably call the film an overall success due to the scares, particularly some terrific scenes of ghoulish figures falling down stairs, or the phantom of the dead daughter cropping up unexpectedly to the great distress of her mother. It also handles that old chestnut of ""characters waking from a dream sequence that we don't know is actually dream at first"" pretty well, too. But a bit more attention paid towards giving the actors real characters to work with would have paid off enormously.",1182729600,7,3548,4.610759493670886
2671793,2,B000JJ4FB2,"Scares? Yeah, there were a few and, at times, the movie almost lifts itself out of a morass of leaden acting, weak dialogue, I've-seen-this-before-story, and . . . well, how scary are ghosts that never actually hurt anyone? The ghosts pull the usual on-screen antics of silently creeping behind characters, of running across doorways, and appearing behind a character after they've turned away. Most of the scares are when the ghosts jump out at you or crawl and the music bangs and crashes. We're talking Disney Haunted House stuff for most of the journey.

I didn't begin to *get* the character's motivations until late in the last act. Without giving anything away (or any more than I have already), their daughter dies and they move into an isolated home in the hills (though not so isolated that we are never at a loss for neighbors popping in and saying howdy). What follows is dialogue and story below-par with even late night Cinemax fare.

It's a poorly written, poorly directly, poorly shot indie film with a few easy scares. If you can get past that, my wife was grabbing onto me as the ghosts jumped out and ran past. Longtime horror fans, jaded by scores of similar-feeling spooks, will yawn or laugh through much of the movie. Your girlfriend or wife may just gasp and grab for your arm.",1181520000,,1301,4.701754385964913
2671794,5,B000JJ4FB2,"Rarely does a film come along that I can say was truly scary with so much coming out these days. This film satisfied a long time need of mine in that department. The timing, cinematography and directing were excellent, combined with a overall complimenting score and sounds. The ghosts thruout could easily compete with any ghost film out there...so to summarize this has become a new fav of mine, that I'll recommend to all my friends. If your like me and tired of being let down, then here ya go.....

2671796,4,B000JJ4FB2,"Creepy, Eerie, Frightening, Unsettling.....one of the best ghost films ever made.  Even though this film was made on digital video all the interior shots are film-like. It is only the exterior shots that give the video away. Even so you cannot imagine how scary this film is. I viewed it on a big screen projector setup with 5 to 1 dolby, and the scares come unexpectedly.  I would not recommend this film for children or the faint of heart. It is incredible that a low budget film like this can deliver more Frightening terror than most grade a gimmick cgi Hollywood films. Congratulations to everyone involved with this movie. The shame is that most people will never see this film.  A little masterpiece!  See It yes, but don't watch it alone.",1168560000,4,746,4.67175572519084

2671798,5,B000JJ4FB2,"It is too bad that the masses will never get to see this film on the big screen.  This is a classic horror film in the real definition of the word horror.  It is a classic ghost story to compete with any of the Asian films.  The good thing is that it is not a remake or ripoff of an Asian film.  It is an original.  This film will get under your skin and stay there for a long time.  If you like horror, this is a must see but be warned...it is not for the faint of heart.  If you enjoyed the original Ringu...this is for you....only more frightening.

The acting is not good, but it is better than the other indie title I watched right before this one; I like to give these types of titles a chance just for the heck of it (you don't need a Hollywood budget just to make a great movie) but this one doesn't deliver.

It's not scary at all.  The most ""real"" horror that I saw was in the very beginning at the little girl's death - everything else was based on cheap jump scares (a loud bang of sound effect accompanied by a ""scary"" scene; it might make you jump, but I find it resentful and nothing horrific about it).  I actually think scenes like that lower the value of a movie and show the lack of creativity in the writers, but that's just me.

I also didn't like the dialogue.  It was very inorganic.  It felt like they memorized lines from a script, instead of adapting the script into common tongue; what I mean is, instead of saying things like ""we'll"" or ""I'll"", they say ""we will"" or ""I will"" - it just feels shallow and fake.  That's just not how people talk in general.

Really have to agree with what other reviewers mentioned: Movie begins with a child's murder, BUT, the parents never push, nag, harass, beg the police to find out who killed their only child. Oh no, they run off to a secluded cabin in the woods to reflect and 'get over it.' Oh yeah, like that's realistic. Murders have been happening annually on May 22nd since 1988, yet the local sheriff is totally clueless and never looking for any similarities between all of these deaths. C'mon, even people that have no respect for the police cannot believe a cop could be that stupid and clueless - and for those of us that follow police procedurals, fictional and real, it's nothing more than insulting to law enforcement everywhere.

Forget the plot holes and nonsensical behavior after ""the big event"" in the beginning. These two actors have ZERO chemistry.

The ironic thing is, after the event that occurred in the beginning a couple growing apart/distancing and feeling awkward toward each other would have been explained...even expected. But this wasn't that. This was two actors, the female lead especially, trying so hard to act that she overacted everything...from lines to facial expressions. I felt like I was watching an actress reading the lines in the amateurish script. The male was not much better but, compared to her, he was Robert DeNiro.

But the final straw for me was when the friends showed up at the cabin. If two bad actors wasn't enough, they added two more. For a total of four actors who sounded like they were auditioning for a high school play.

If you ever see the trailer for this film, it's actually all the time you need to waste on this. I rarely bash movies unless they really reek and this one really does, believe me.",1287273600,,441,4.238095238095238
2672094,5,B000JJ4FB2,"""Dark Remains"" is an independent horror film that should not be overlooked.  Placing a major emphasis on creating a ""creepy"" and ""disturbing"" environment, the film is full of shocking scenes that are sure to frighten the viewing audience.  The shocking moments come when you least expect them, and the tension remains with the viewer as they expect further shocking surprises at every turn.  The film is good at keeping these scenes evenly paced out, in order to not only build more tension, but to also keep the film interesting without overdoing the ""jump"" moments.

The story focuses around a couple, Allen and Julie Pyke, who recently had their young daughter brutally murdered in their home while they were asleep.  Following the murder of their daughter, the two are torn with grief and decide it's best to move away for a while.  So, the couple decides to rent a cabin far away from their home, in order to try to forget and heal their wounds of the past.  Allen uses this time to begin writing a new book while Julie uses the beautiful scenery of the forest as a new subject matter of her photographs.

Everything appears to be getting better for the couple, until Julie discovers an abandoned prison located deep within the forest.  She becomes fascinated with the prison, and obsessively continues to return to the site to take photographs of it.  After developing the photos in her dark room, the audience is shown that Julie has actually been photographing spirits that reside within the prison.  With each passing day, Julie slips into a deeper depression, and refuses to leave the cabin.  Allen discovers the truth behind the cabin and its past inhabitants, everyone who has ever lived there has committed suicide after falling into depression.  It becomes Allen's main goal to save his wife from becoming the next victim of the house.

From the opening scene until the last scene, ""Dark Remains"" continues to leave the viewer with chills.  Scaring the audience at every turn with sudden appearances of ghosts and other eerie actions, the film always leaves you waiting for the next scary moment, which usually isn't too far away.  The story is good, the acting is decent, and the special effects and scary moments are amazingly done.  The pacing is perfect for a horror film, and it gives enough time for the story to develop without neglecting the ability to scare the audience at every turn.

""Dark Remains"" is a truly frightening film, that is guaranteed to shock you and leave you wanting more.  The ending is left open for the viewer to interrupt for themselves, and the gore is well balanced and serves a purpose to the development of the overall plot.  If you're a fan of horror movies, you cannot go wrong with picking up ""Dark Remains"".",1280102400,,2760,4.79492600422833
2672095,1,B000JJ4FB2,"""Dark Remains"" may help your insomnia-it put me to sleep. Here are no visuals, no story, no scares. And who cares what happens to these very unengaging characters? It was as if someone with a camera found a couple of empty buildings and had people (the scary stuff) pop in and out of the background while something boring was going on in the foreground.
There weren't even any laughs, inadvertent or intentional.
Give me Evil Dead II for scary (and funny) any day.",1268438400,,464,4.602409638554217
2672096,1,B000JJ4FB2,"Dark Remains (Brian Avenet-Bradley, 2005)

Dark Remains is the back-alley abortion of what could have been a really, really good movie. (For some reason, as I was watching it, I kept comparing it to both Grace and Ring Around the Rosie, though thematically it has nothing to do with either; it is much closer to Shutter.) Given the right treatment, it probably still could be. But what's here is nothing but a mess.

Allen (3: The Dale Earnhardt Story's Greg Thompson) and Julie (The Signal's Cheri Christian) Pyke, traumatized by the death of their young daughter Emma (Rachel Jordan), retreat to a secluded cabin in the woods to try and heal. As time goes on, however, and their mental states get worse, Allen starts digging and finds that the house has a history of seemingly driving depressives to suicide. From there, the film becomes a race against time as Allen tries to figure out what's causing the problem as Julie slides deeper and deeper into depression.

All of which is well and good, except I know I'm probably leaving out some major plot points. Why? Because beyond a certain point, I found it impossible to understand anything that was going on in this movie. There are all sorts of things going on here, but they're all reflections of other, usually better, movies. (I'll make an exception for Ring Around the Rosie, which was just hysterically bad.) They all get jumbled together like strands of Christmas tree lights; no matter how you try to keep them separate, they tangle up until you've got to spend an entire night picking them apart. No one bothered to spend that night, or even fifteen minutes, trying to make anything intelligible out of the plot points here. The movie's got a good sense of atmosphere and understands that creepy and subtle is better than the stupid jump, and I have to give Avenet-Bradley points for that. But the characters and situations he plonked down in the middle of that atmosphere are not only godawfully stupid, but horribly-acted as well. If you're the kind of person who can listen to a tenth-generation bootleg cassette and hear the crystal clarity of the original concert where it was recorded, you may be able to get enough out of this movie to like it. The rest of you are liable to find yourself holding a tangled mess of Christmas lights and wondering how they always end up this way. *",1259539200,,2350,4.7128953771289535

He's always snapping orders and bossing her around, getting all up in her face and invading her privacy.

The wife could not distance herself from the  self-imposed guilt of what happened to her daughter. The movie solved nothing and was a waste of time.,1475712000,,402,4.2894736842105265
