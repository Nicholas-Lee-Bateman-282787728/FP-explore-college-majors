2711263,4,B000LP5D88,"Look, this ain't a piece of art, nor is it a big budget special effects feature.  On the other hand, I was expecting a lot less, and found myself entertained.  Yes, it's low-budget.  Yes, it's definately B-movie.  But if you're in the mood for such fare, then this will satisfy.

Actually, I would give it 3.5 stars, but Joey - er JOSEPH Lawrence is awefully cute, so I'm rounding up.",1177632000,16,384,4.428571428571429

2711321,3,B000LP5D88,Was a decent movie.  I must say I am very picky and critical.  I would recommend this.  The acting was great (the main characters) and this kept my attention.,1431302400,,158,4.379310344827586
2711322,5,B000LP5D88,i remember watching this a few years ago and wanted to watch it again but scfi never played it for some reason.,1387756800,,111,4.090909090909091
2711323,4,B000LP5D88,"I really enjoyed this movie, it was a very unique storyline and the casting was great. The story itself seems to lack some continuity and flow, but overall it is very entertaining. Joseph Lawrence is extraordinarily believable as the android. I've always enjoyed his acting but he takes it to a new level here. A really solid cast keeps this from becoming predicable or boring.",1304467200,,377,4.815384615384615
2711324,3,B000LP5D88,"I'd heard a lot of bad comments on Android Apocalypse and had decided I would never see it. Then I found out Chris Jericho was in it and as he is one of my favorite wrestlers and I love his band Fozzy's music, I thought I give it a try. It's no Academy award winner, but I enjoyed it. It really doesn't deserve the bashing it gets. It's just a fun little movie where stuff blows up. Sometimes, that's what you need. I do wish Jericho had been in it more.",1291593600,,454,4.0
2711325,2,B000LP5D88,"Android Apocalypse: 4 out of 10: Well it did not make me want to poke my eyes out with a dull fork... so it has that going in its favor.

Dateline the future... Phoenix is a domed city surrounded by a horrifying wasteland. (Kind of like now) Humans are in short supply so androids that look exactly like humans do most of the work. Our mullet wearing racist (androidist?) hero loses his shoveling things job to an android. A few eighties flashback fistfights later and he finds himself on the run through the wasteland handcuffed to an android. (Joey Lawrence of Blossom of all people.)

The leads are actually quite good and it is unusual for white trash to be a hero in these (or any) type of films. That is a nice change of pace. The story on the other hand is pretty awful. For example the ending is so truncated they either ran out of money or forgot the whole apocalypse promise of the title.

While Lawrence does his best data impersonation, the other androids are all over the map. Many of them emote more than their human counterparts, while others are clearly the same five grips wearing facemasks.

Set design also needs work. The prison is clearly a factory. The humans headquarters is a glorified office park complete with fernage. (I was having Overdrawn at the Memory Bank flashbacks) In addition, items such as blankets with do not remove tags and Jeep Cherokees litter the film.

Overall a decent if slow Sci-fi time waster. Just do not get you hopes up for an apocalypse.",1258416000,2,1489,4.561797752808989
2711326,4,B000LP5D88,"I bought this movie on sale, half expecting to turn it off after the first 10 minutes, like a lot of other bargain bin movies I get. This was actually interesting enough to watch all the way through. Acting was good, plot ok. All in all, not a bad sci-fi movie.",1222560000,3,261,4.137254901960785
2711327,2,B000LP5D88,"The sets are minimal, the dialog is stilted and the acting is third rate.
The plot is very predicable as well.
This may be a new low even for a TV movie?
Well I guess the 60's series lost in space may have been worse,
but it was trying to be funny? These guys seem deadly serious
and come out like a ""Killer Tomatoes"" movie.",1208476800,,324,4.0
2711328,5,B000LP5D88,"Thoroughly enjoyed this entertaining sci-fi feature.  As with movies of science fiction one has to use his/her imagination which includes overlooking the overwhelming impossibilities of them (abilities, inventions, etc.).  I must add, however, that some impossibilities do not remain impossible and at some future date become possible.

A great find and to me a movie worth the purchase!!!!!!!!",1188950400,7,394,5.758620689655173

Some of the actors were convincing in their roles, some not so much.
The weapons were sub-par for a sci-fi plot such as this one, and the special effects were obviously low budget.",1522713600,,268,4.489795918367347

8162712,2,B000LP5D88,no.  I did not like this.  I watched it for 45 minutes and my ears hurt from the dialogue.  the android's were the best actors. they didn't have to express humanness.  the actors tried and did not succeed.  some of you will enjoy this film.  some of you might like sitting on thumbtacks.
