3497761,5,B001BQJL1Q,You think well this is just to damn old to appreciate. Well wine is not the only thing that gets better and Karloff is another. I love everything about this set. Quality seems excellent and will continue to enjoy these titles a long time I hope.,1263772800,10,245,4.3478260869565215
3497762,4,B001BQJL1Q,"The cool thing about this set, in my opinion, are the early silent films in which Karloff appeared. I picked up this set for $5 brand new and am most gratified because it has greatly enhanced my Karloff collection! Here are the films in this box set:

You can't go wrong with this collection--one of the best deals around on Karloff's films!",1258416000,18,662,4.508333333333334
3497763,3,B001BQJL1Q,"With the exception of ""The Ape"" and ""The Mr. Wong Series"", the remaining movies are unknown. All the flicks in this package are ""B"" movies, some cheaper than the others. The color movies are washed out  with horrid sound with the exception of the well-known ""The Terror"", Karloff made towards the end of his career. Included is an old serial with poor picture and sound (but interesting to watch), several silent movies (the best being ""The Last of the Mohicans"") and several gems. During the Depression we had three famous Chinese detectives (all played by non-orientals), Charlie Chan, Mr. Moto (Japanese) and Mr. Wong. The Mr. Wong series of the late 30's was made by a poverty row Studio, Monogram and didn't receive the recognition the Chan and Moto movies did. Karloff made 5 and became bored and left. These 5 movies are included throughout the 4 discs. The quality and sound are far superior to a special Mr. Wong set, I bought sometime back. Another Monogram flick, ""The Ape"", is stunningly preserved.

Karloff was the true movie monster but underneath some his most famous creations, was a highly cultured and kind man. This inexpensive box set gives us an example that he could play non menacing roles. He is mainly remembered for creating the Frankenstein Monster and The Mummy. But he an incredibly fine actor that was misused and stereotyped by Hollywood and rarely given a chance to display show his consummate acting ability. In all his villainous roles, he managed to convey empathy.

Karloff was not just the King of Horror, but a talented and highly skilled professional. He even manages to overcome some of the pretty rotten material presented here in this box set.",1258416000,37,1685,4.86411149825784

8284228,1,B001BQJL1Q,"DVD's seem to be in ok shape. However the case is broken, and the plastic on the front appears to have been intentially cut in two vertical lines on the front. I guess for the price I shouldn't complain, but a discription of the poor condition would have been nice.",1418083200,,265,4.32
8284229,1,B001BQJL1Q,"I'm a huge Karloff fan, & (for relevancy about to be explained) also
a huge Bela Lugosi fan. I've had a bit more success with tracking
down the obscure Bela b-pics & poverty row stuff than I have had
with BK, so I grabbed this set.

In a nutshell, it's AWFUL. What I've learned: bad Bela Lugosi films
were much better than bad Boris Karloff films (partly because the
Italian & Mexican films (other than the superb Black Sabbath)
BK did at the end of his career were much worse then Bela's Ed
Wood films). I usually enjoy the Monogram (& other poverty row)
& serial Lugosi's. Not the case here!

All the prints range from poor-unwatchable.

The best stuff on here are the superb Mr Wong's, but
they are available in much better quality elsewhere; notably the
Roan box set.

Probably the rarest item here is the full 226 minute version of the
DREADFUL serial King Of The Wild. It is the worst serial I have
ever seen.

Other titles I didn't already own include: Dynamite Dan, His
Majesty The American,  Sabaka &  The Snake People. None of
which I can recommend. Picture quality on His Majesty is
unwatchable.

Someone asked me about Juggernaut. The Platinum has a much
better picture (though still not good), & it is a terrible film. This also
includes The Bells (available in much better quality elsewhere),
several episodes of the fine show The Veil (available both much
cheaper & in better quality elsewhere) & more similar.

The prints are so bad I can't even recommend this for the good
films (the Wong's are superb films for the genre; if anything better
than the Mr Moto's), The Bells, The Veils, Last Of The Mohicans
& the ok The Terror; also available in better quality elsewhere).

Higher quality Print recommendations of the decent films:

Mr Wong's: Roan Box Set

Last Of The Mohicans: Slingshot/LumiVision/Eastman Restoration

The Bells: Image

The Veil Episodes: I have both the Something Weird & the Platinum.
I have been told there is a 3 disc metal box set that bests both
of those, but have never seen it.

Dick Tracy: Roan or VCI if you can't find the Roan.

The Terror: I own 3 versions; a no name Asian Copy is the best
of the 3. I have heard that the recent HD Cinema Classics
Blu-ray is the one to own. I have also heard that the dvd that
it is packaged with is often defective.

Stay away from this dreck; far, far away.

To be perfectly clear, I am a huge BK fan, just not of this dreadful
set!",1387584000,5,2417,4.466970387243736
8284230,5,B001BQJL1Q,My husband always loved Boris Karloff in every movie he starred in.  This was for his birthday and he really loved it at least the ones he saw there are so many good classics he played in and we really enjoyed it.,1374364800,,213,4.071428571428571
8284231,5,B001BQJL1Q,"I can't really review all the movies on this disk as I don't know what all the disk contains. I bought the DVD collection for a Christmas Gift for my middle son last year because I know Boris Karloff is a great HORROR FILM actor and enjoyed everything he was in when I was growing up. When my son told me he was looking for the old B movie horror shows, I had to get this collection for him. He was tickled pink and has watched several times already.",1342396800,,450,4.067415730337078
8284232,3,B001BQJL1Q,"This collection might not be available so check with the seller first. The reviews suggest that this box set has somewhat better picture & sound than the ""15 Frighful Films"" box set, but I can't verify that. Now that I have an LCD TV, I try to get all of my flicks with the highest quality picture & sound available and ALL OF THE FILMS IN THIS COLLECTION ARE AVAILABLE SEPERATELY, so do your research. This box set is a great way to inexpensively explore the works of one of the greatest genre actors of the 20th century. But if you are seriously building a Karloff collection and you care about picture and sound quality, well... as they say, you get what you pay for ~",1334448000,,671,4.333333333333333
8284233,5,B001BQJL1Q,"Boris Karloff, like fellow star Bela Lugosi, made some real quality movies for major studios and also some low budget efforts for minor studios.  The silents being an exception, the work here is mostly the lower budget stuff for Monogram and studios like that.  The prints are not pristine, but are quite watchable.  I wanted this set because I had several of the Wong films but not all of them; it was nice to get them all in one set at such a bargain price. ( There was one Wong film made after Karloff left the series, which is NOT included here; too bad but then, with no Karloff in it, I suppose it doesn't really belong in this set. ) I haven't watched all of the other films.  I did watch ""Island Monster and have to admit; it's really terrible. The script is bad, the acting is awful, Karloff not being awful,  but turning in a weak performance for him, and featuring one of the most obnoxious child performances ever put on film. The dubbing is so bad it's very hard to hear what people are saying. Still for this price, a clinker or two in the set isn't such a big deal.  Again, lesser films but some of them are rare and well worth the small price tag.",1312329600,4,1163,4.263636363636364
