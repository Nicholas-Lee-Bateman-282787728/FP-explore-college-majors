2963111,5,B000W7M1I0,"This is a great documentary video, maybe because Prince doesnt give input.  I though it was going to glorify Prince in the do's that he did instead of the don'ts that he didnt'  But instead critics, close friends, and musicians talk about the tracks he had to jump on to stay on the rails.  Realizing he didn't stay on the same train, this guy had to jump on moving trains to moving trains.  He was swimming underwater in a sea of punk rock and disco during the late 70s and held his breath for almost 8 years, thats really tough going.  For the first time I actually enjoyed watching in its entirety with the facts that the critics talked about the negatives and the positives.  Also the way hip hop came into mainstream and pushed Prince aside as he brought himself to hits throughout the 90's.  The thing about hip hop and Prince is that hip hop was a closer live life to reality than Princes fantasy space songs, fantasy to us.  Pretty little red corvett or pretty little red gunshot, which happens more often.  Plus, one of the critics comments about Prince sing i wanna jack you off and how he got everyone into it--Im glad im not the type of person who can go dumfounded and start singing i wanna jack you off when where are people allowed to do this in a normal reality society, in jail.  And i don't beleive the Micheal Jackson ping pong story.",1281312000,,1353,4.376
2963112,5,B000W7M1I0,"i don't know what some of the other reviewers are talking about....saying this is a ""garbage"" documentary and that it's poorly done.  The only thing that it's missing is actual dialogue with Prince himself.  But this is a unauthorized biography, so what do you expect?  However, although unauthorized..it STILL features Prince's music, video footage, and clips of live shows.  It starts with telling of his background growing up in Minneapolis, and kind of goes step by step through his career in the late 70's through the 80's & early nineties.  There's in-depth commentary about each album he released during these periods from the people who were there recording it with him.  I really enjoyed watching this and i can't say i've ever seen a better documentary about Prince.  Every fan should definitely check this out!!

It showed clips from music videos, and the staged portions of the Sign O' The Times film, but nothing live.  David Rivkin was the only really interesting interview.  Everyone else was pretty much filler.  Don't waste your time unless you are truly a new Prince fan.  It wasn't awful, but nowhere near worth the asking price.",1222646400,7,407,4.583333333333333
2963117,5,B000W7M1I0,"When it comes to entertainment the one and only Prince Rogers Nelson is at the top of the tree. In listing his talents it is more likely that a skill is left out rather than scratch around trying to find superlatives. Singer, songwriter, musician, arranger, producer, dancer, fashion guru and industry catalyst are the areas of expertise that are most apparent.

It is crystal clear that the Purple One has had a major effect on the shape of the contemporary music industry. His war against the ruling record company forces can be seen as a monumental force-and. this endeavour opened the door for a greater deal of artistic freedom.

His imprint upon contemporary culture cannot be underestimated and it is with extreme sadness that the passing of Prince came on April 21, 2016. The death of Prince occurred at his Paisley Park Estate, Chanhassen, Minnesota, near Minneapolis-and, it is without even a consideration that aside of illness this wondrous workaholic would have been turning fresh ideas in to another reality. The productivity of this supreme showman was second to none and he had even performed recent dates although fragility had curtailed an April 15 gig.

A super human studio stamina resulted in a rate of albums that equated to almost a release per annum since 1978 and a surfeit of sublime singles taking in funk, soul, rock, R n B, jazz, hip hop, psychedelia and more always made the radio a better listening experience. It was most noticeably in the 80s that those mega-hits came flying out of a non-stop assembly line. The albums such as 1999, Purple Rain (with an accompanying movie of the same name), Around the world in a Day, Parade and Sign O the Times had this legend at the peak of his powers-and, the Top 40 was awash with chart champions that brought in audiences from across the sonic spectrum. The Glory Years DVD analyses this electric era and shows an artist at the peak of his critical and commercial identity.

1999, Little Red Corvette, Lets go Crazy, When Doves Cry, Purple Rain, I would die for U, Raspberry Beret, Paisley Park, Kiss, Anotherloverholenyohead, Girls & Boys, Mountains, Sing O the Times, If I was your Girlfriend, U got the look and the list goes on! Every one of these tunes lit up the pop world-and, ultimately this decade proved to be the most commercially viable period for a diminutive and dexterous deity.

It is not as if the story ended there as his industry became anthems of that decadent decade for other acts as well e.g. Manic Monday (The Bangles), Sugar Walls (Sheena Easton), Nothing compares to U (Sinead O Connor) and I feel for You (Chaka Khan-giving this lady her most productive smash). The range of artists who collaborated with Prince is endless and so are the credits. The recording went on and the creative juices always on stage reputation extended the kudos.

On a subjective note it is a pleasure to put on any of the aforementioned albums or a compilation-and, there is absolutely no doubt that Prince has certainly had a positive effect on my listening experiences. There will be many deserved plaudits because we are talking about a legend. Along with the recent departure of David Bowie the world has lost a couple of Heroes (and, amazingly this maverick had paid tribute to the Thin White Duke with a cover of this phenomenal number during a late March 2016 gig that consisted of a breathtaking 57 songs!).

Talent is wrongly applied to a whole host of bankrupt here today, gone tomorrow wannabes. However, on a tragic day the globe waved goodbye to the Diamonds and Pearls of one of the most influential icons of our (New Power) Generation. The doves will be crying as will many of his devoted disciples. Thank you for those glory days and many more years of Midas. Prince Rogers Nelson RIP.",1464393600,4,3780,4.753048780487805

As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, I am the ultimate Prince fan (which accounts for me adding this ""Prince: The Glory Years"" to my collection)and I guess this puts me in the category of 'completist' as well, but if you are a fan, this documentary is as essential as any other DVD in your collection. The only problem that I have with this DVD, is the false statements printed on the back cover. For example, the description on the cover claims that there is live concert footage included in this documentary. This is entirely false. The only performances on this DVD were taken directly from Prince's music videos (none of which are live).
