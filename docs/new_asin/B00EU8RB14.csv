5943577,5,B00EU8RB14,"This is one of those rare films that makes you believe in love. People really do fall in love; and begin to care for someone else more than they care for themselves. I'm stating that because I'm in my 50s now; I'm alittle dented and dusty; alittle cynical; alittle world weary; alittle misanthropic but this film erased some of it. That's the story of Tom and Shane. Love is real.

One could view this film with many different eyes..
political, equality, injustice, etc. I feel at it's heart it is a love story plain and simple. It's so well done it pulls you in before you know it; you're right there with Tom and Shane. and then.. Tom is gone. I was hangin' pretty tough til Shane's first birthday after losing Tom. In his narrative he states that he tells people he's ok and doing fine but admits he's NOT ok, he's NOT fine. Man, does that bring it home! Anyone who's lost someone close to them will FEEL that line. Because you're NOT the same, never will be; and the underlying truth is you don't stop loving someone because they've passed away; that love stays with you and you feel it everyday. This film illustrates it perfectly...even in death.. Love endures.

On a broader human/political note.. Anyone who sees this film has to recognize that gay people are not just physcially attracted to one another but emotionally, and spiritially attracted as well. To be more specific, This film clearly shows that Tom and Shane share a physical, emotional, and spirtially bond; THAT constitutes a real marriage. I believe this film will take us a step closer to the legal acknowledgement.

Thank you Shane for putting yourself out there; for sharing Tom will us.

God Bless Tom Bridegroom!",1382918400,65,1690,4.6610738255033555
5943578,5,B00EU8RB14,"This incredibly well done documentary reminds you that you can overcome the most difficult of the obstacles in life and turn the darkest experiences into something powerful and beautiful. The most touching I have ever seen. Very inspiring, to say the least.",1382918400,8,257,5.142857142857143
5943579,5,B00EU8RB14,"When I first learned of Shane & Tom's story last year, I was, like many around the world, moved to tears.  It's awful enough to loose someone you love, but for it to be the love of your life & then to have that person's family completely shut you out of everything...I can't even imagine.

This easily could have been a sad and bitter documentary but it was a celebration of Shane & Tom's life together.  The director/producers even seemed to go the extra mile to try & show that even though they were completely wrong in how they handled things, they believed that Tom's family did love him...& for all their shortcomings (& there are many), Tom loved his family in return.

Since Shane's video first hit YouTube last year, we've come a LONG way in the battle for equality.  We have a long way to go still, but I think the more people that watch this documentary (& especially the video that started it all), we'll be there sooner rather than later.  You just can't watch this film (& if you have a heart) come away not knowing that love is love & who you love just shouldn't matter.  Thank you Shane.",1382832000,45,1102,4.372549019607843
5943580,5,B00EU8RB14,"This tragedy has happened to numerous friends of mine over and over again. Here in the Land Down Under we are not yet privileged to have equality in marriage, in fact until relatively recently homosexuality was a felony. Reason saw that change, but the battle for marriage, or at least equal rights as to family has dragged on and on. I've seen partners of 30 years shut out by the partners family--yes, even from the funeral. I would have gone anyway !!! This film shows very beautifully the story of a very deep relationship between partners, and the bastardry that ignorant people can inflict on the surviving partner. But above all it shows the strength of a relationship between two people. I think that our hero came out the stronger for it and I hope that he eventually finds happiness with another and marries or has a watertight agreement drawn up that blocks the nonsense that went on. Wonderful, thoughtful film. I saw this video at a friends but I intend to now buy one tonight. Anyone in a relationship male/male, female/female, must see this.",1382832000,10,1056,4.713513513513513
5943581,5,B00EU8RB14,"How a movie about such a sad subject winds up being inspiring is quite awesome. I think it is because it is done with such heart and love.  It is truly a tribute to his lover Tom and also a celebration of life in general.  I also feel it is educational in that it is very important for people (especially unmarried couples) to have some sort of written directive.  As loving people, we tend to forget that a death can bring out the worst in many people! I just have to shake my head when I think of how far that Family went!  God bless all of the film production staff on such wonderful, and yes.. life changing film!",1382745600,14,617,4.159663865546219
5943582,5,B00EU8RB14,"I won't go over the story here. I'm sure most of you who are interested in this movie already know it. What I will say is I saw this film in the theaters and it was absolutely incredible! The film mostly follows Shane's life, from his beginnings to his life after the love of his life and center of his world is killed in a freak accident. His story of the struggles that came to him because of the fact that same-sex marriage wasn't legal in California at the time and he'd not married his significant other, he had no rights.

Shane's story has touched so many hearts and changed many people's minds about this subject. It is certainly worth the 80 minutes you invest in watching it. I was thrilled to find out it is to become available on DVD! Please, do yourself a favor and watch this film. But be sure you have some kleenex nearby.",1382400000,24,837,4.2974683544303796
5943583,5,B00EU8RB14,"This is a true story about two people who loved each other.  Tom and Shane were the perfect couple until a sad accident left Shane alone.  This documentary shows the lives of these two men from their beginning years, through high school, their introduction to each other at a bowling alley, their love story, the sad accident of Tom, the support of Shane's family and how Tom's family came into Shane's home after Tom's accidental death and took his belongings without any compassion towards Shane but instead banned him from attending his partner funeral.
This was a very powerful story of true love.  This documentary was created with the support of over 6800 Kickstarter Donors as well as many other people including Bill Clinton.
On a personal note, after hearing this story in May 2011, my partner and I realized how important it is to protect ourselves in case something ever did happen to either of us.  Thank you Shane for sharing your love story with us.  You truly are an inspiration.",1381795200,148,994,4.755813953488372

5943625,5,B00EU8RB14,"One of the most simple and stunning films I've ever seen.  Even though these guys weren't the macho men I would have preferred to see, their story hits deep and hard.  Love is so difficult to find and truly keep; so many in the gay world are merely into ""who's next?' and have no character or integrity.  That's what makes this hardest of all to take -- their simplicity, genuine reality, and knock-out love for each other.  Such a tragedy it should ever have ended.  So many will spend a lifetime and never come close to this.  Me, for one... sad to say.

Something to send to all your homophobic pastors, who profess being Christian, and haven't a clue what John 3:16 really means -- or Romans 13:10, much less Galatians Chapter Three... the whole foundation of Christianity, and all of how life was meant to be, should be made.  God is love, and the world was created by and for love (not necessarily for procreation: because many can't, nor never will).  Does that rule out being a fully human person?  Only the stupid would say yes.  Christ came not to condemn the world but to save it -- nor, for the heterosexuals only.
Ahhh, but the lack of wisdom and common sense in the world is more than appalling,  (not to mention in the church, as well).",1470182400,,1251,4.43859649122807

5943634,5,B00EU8RB14,By far one of my favorite LGBT documentaries. This film will pull at your heartstrings. I just wish our God fearing brothers and sisters would stop preaching hate and start preaching love. The travesty in the end would have been prevented if acceptance and love were the norm. I felt the burden of guilt that the Bridegroom family should have felt for denying their son and I certainly hope they were able to cleanse their evil souls because that's no way to love! Their cross to bear was the world knowing their son was gay and they are bigots! I can only hope that I in my life will experience the love these two had for eachother.,1450656000,,633,4.418803418803419

5943640,5,B00EU8RB14,"This is by far one of the most powerful films since Tom Hanks in Philadelphia. This movie brought me to tears hearing how Tom's family basically cut Shane off from the source of his love,  comfort,  and really everything they shared in the 6 years they were together. It just shows that Christians who fight so hard for this to not be,  but what good Christian that has faith would want to wish that upon someone, or just Barr a person to say their final goodbye.  This just shows that the world needs to open their eyes.  Put yourself in Shane's shoes and live what he had to live through because of Tom's parents non acceptance of tom being gay. For the fact that Tom's mom connected to shane and his family and then turned a complete 180. I know people mourn in different ways but someone who lives by faith everyday in their lives,  would god want you to deny someone the chance to say goodbye to the person they have loved for the past 6 years? I don't think that is god's message.  This movie is just by far one of the best movies I have seen based off the LGBT world.  We are all human,  we all deserve love,  but what toms mom did to shane was just uncalled for.  I hope shane continues to live on the memory of Tom and hopefully he has found happiness and peace regardless of not having Tom here. Shane you are an inspiration to many young and old.  This movie definitely gets an A in my book.",1447113600,,1402,4.209737827715355

5943685,2,B00EU8RB14,"In this DVD, a young man tells of the tragic, accidental death of his partner of 10 years and of his complete exclusion from the hospital and the funeral by his partner's family. It's a sad (if all too familiar) story of the pain that can be inflicted by bigotry. Unfortunately, the story told in this DVD could have been told better and far more succinctly in a 20 minute segment of ""60-Minutes."" The surviving partner babbles on at length about a situation that literally thousands of gay men and women have experienced throughout the years [perhaps most dramatically and most poignantly throughout the AIDS crisis of the 80's and 90's when life-partners were routinely excluded from hospitals, sick rooms and funerals]. One regrets the young man's loss, of course; but surely the producers of this film could have used his story to tell a far bigger story. One could also wish that they had used a professional narrator, since the young man's tearful recounting of his own tragic tale becomes extremely cloying after the first 30 minutes. In one of his letters, Ned Rorem writes about the period after the death of his own life-partner and how he found himself isolated and ruled for awhile  by ""the egotism of grief.""

The reason why this film is not just another true life love story w/ a tragic end, is because of the important depiction of an all to common scenario.  If you can't or don't want to get married, make sure you have legal documentation stipulating all plans in the event of your demise.

5943718,5,B00EU8RB14,"For a while, I felt interested but a bit removed. Certainly the story is tragic, but there are so many tragic tales in the world. Certainly any homophobia is horrific, but when there are still gay men being beaten to death, this story seemed not nearly as dramatic and shocking as others. And its style is basic  talking head interviews with friends and family, home videos, photographs.

I thought (in my smug liberal way) that its good for the country to see a film showing how normal, likable and in love two young men could be. But this wasn't news to me. It felt rudimentary, aimed at those who had never known a gay couple and realized 'hey, they're just people'.

But then something strange happened. In the film's last half hour it built into an emotional tidal wave. I didn't realize I was hit until I suddenly started to cry. These two men were so deeply, sweetly, truly in love, and Shane Crone, rather than simply crawl into a shell after the untimely death of the love of his life, and after being barred from the funeral by Tom's homophobic family, and dealt many other emotional (and legal) cuts and bruises only because he and his life partner were gay, managed to rally himself, and make a you tube video that has reached millions with an impossible to argue with plea for gay marriage. That he could take this devastating loss, and the mistreatment, and instead of giving up on life do something important and life affirming was profoundly affecting. Suddenly the whole film seemed to have more weight. I wept through the very moving responses his video (the one that got me is a self proclaimed life-long redneck, vowing to never oppose gay love again). Even the end credits full of thousands of names of those who cared enough to contribute to the Kickstarter campaign for the film moved me with joy for the resilience of human beings, the fact that things are getting better, and that love is still the most powerful thing in the human experience, both in personal and political terms.",1410048000,2,2006,4.629213483146067

You do not get to pick what parts of your child you love. Tom was gay, and he loved Shane. They had a life together, and Tom's family should have accepted that.

""Bridegroom"" is not about a gay couple, it's about a couple that suffered from ignorance from people that doesn't accept the gay community just because they think it's wrong, or probably because it's what society made people believe since the very beginning.
The documentary follows how Tom and Shane met and all the good times they had together; this documentary has a little bit of everything (happiness, sadness, being angry), but once you end up see it you wish you find something like they had, the love of your life, and how everything can be taken away from you because of people with closed minds that they were never able to accept their son's sexual preference, when the truth is that love is love. This film almost made me cry of joy, or even of anger, because even when things look so dark, there's always a little light waiting to be seen.
I hope ""Bridegroom"" opens some closed minds, because it shows how unfair society has been to the gay community, and how they are advancing from step to step to have ""equal"" rights to straight people, it's not about equality, we're all humans at the end of the day and we deserve all the rights anyone would have.
I truly hope to find a love as strong as Tom and Shane had one day. This movie made me believe that true love is still possible.

5943768,5,B00EU8RB14,"This is a superb documentary of the lives of a couple who had an amazing relationship for several years.  It's filmed in a very casual style so feels like the very personal story that it is.  The background for these two quite different individuals helps the viewer to realize how important it was that they found each other and shared so many experiences.  There is the suggestion that things would have been different if the two men had been allowed to legally marry.  When tragedy struck, Shane would have had legal rights that allowed him to have control over final arrangements for Tom.  Conceptually, that may be valid.  However, given the situation and people involved, I doubt Shane's experience would have been much different.  Tom's family was so controlling and manipulative that they probably woukd have dismissed the rights Shane would have as a married partner.  The family was extremely conservative and especially Tom's father was used to getting his way.  At the time, Shane was not the fighter that he later became, so most likely the Bridegroom family would have stepped all over Shane in any case.  Shane could have then fought for his rights in court to eventually correct the situation after many years and much expense.

It's a nice thought that the ugly situation would have been avoided had the couple been allowed to marry.  We have the expectation that marriage brings with it a certain amount of respect for the relationship of the partners involved and the legal status they have.  In this case, however, it seems that the only thing that mattered was whether or not the family approved of the relationship.  One family approved and the other did not.",1393286400,,1680,4.849122807017544

5943784,3,B00EU8RB14,"The Movie was good......these two people shared a love for life and for each other.
However.  The events on top of the roof as described in the movie really bothered me.
First of all, Alex made like the whole evening was about her.  She describes her outfit,
how she didn't fill it out because she doesn't have anything to fill it out.
She was In front of the camera, why didn't she start warning him that he was getting too
close to the edge, she's hearing impaired, not blind.

Then when he did tragically fall, which I still don't understand how it happened, she rushes
down and is rubbing his back, then states ""meanwhile, I looked like a total hooker""  who cares?
A man is mortally injured and dying, who cares if you look like a total hooker, and she snickered about it too.
I just think her comments were distasteful  JMHO",1391212800,3,829,4.427631578947368
5943785,5,B00EU8RB14,"This documentary is about love and that is the love shared between two men. Shane was the beloved partner of Tom, who tragically dies too young in a clumsy accident. Shane was obviously emotionally crushed; his pain and grief were added to in a most cruel way by the parents of his dead loved one banning him and his friends from the funeral.

The film takes us back to both of the boy's child hoods and shows the similarities and differences that both of them had in growing up. Both from small towns but whilst Tom was the golden boy in everything he did, with a smile that would win the heart of the strongest critic. Shane on the other hand was rubbish at sports (a bit like me) but loved singing, dancing and wearing sequins - so no real clues as my GBF would say.

Their story is told through the use of video footage and personal pieces to camera of their friends and family. Shane had a terrible time when he came out at school as I did when I did likewise at University - as Stonewall says some people need to get over it - being gay is not a style choice. This is a very moving and well made film and Tom comes across as the sort of man that made the world a better place for having him in it. I was seriously close to blubbing at this, which is no bad thing at all. I feel it would appeal to anyone who understands love; at one point Shane says `who fights against love? Sadly the answer is too close to home. I can not recommend strongly enough an absolutely emotion laden and brilliant piece of honesty.",1391212800,6,1516,4.188356164383562

Not only is this a tragic love story, but it is also inspiring. Never before have I seen a love like Shane and Tom's. I have been watching all of their Youtube videos and you can clearly see the bond they shared (share) together. And then the tragedy strikes. Shane is devastated. Tom's family, who never accepted their son for being gay, threatens Shane not to attend the funeral. The mother comes and takes everything of Tom's-hence ""The Worst Parents Ever."". Shane however, has his own Memorial Service for Tom and now speaks upf or gay rights. He is a strong and amazing individual. In my opinion, this is the greatest love story that I have seen and I think everyone should see this, gay or straight.

It is a must see for anyone on the fence about gay marriage or anyone with a child who is gay.
Tom and Shane, the couple in the film, share much in common. Both are from small towns in the Midwest. But Tom's parents are not accepting of Tom and his partner as Shane's parents come to be. This film shows the price couples pay when they cannot marry and things take a wrong turn.

5943814,5,B00EU8RB14,"In May of 2012, Shane Britney Crone posted a heartbreaking video on YouTube, about his six year relationship with Tom Bridegroom.  The two young men, both from small Midwest towns, had met when Shane moved to California, and each knew he had met his ultimate soulmate.  Their love for each other was obvious to all around them, accepted by Shanes family and, it seemed, reluctantly by Toms parents.  When a tragic accident took Toms life, Shanes grief was further complicated by the decisionof Toms family to shut him out of the funeral arrangements, since they had no legal standing as a couple.

The video was viewed over three million times, and translated into 20 languages.  Actors George Takai and Neil Patrick Harris were among those who approached Shane about the possibility of doing a full-length documentary on their story.  They brought Linda Bloodworth Thomason (The Golden Girls) onboard to write and direct the film, and raised money from over 6500 people on Kickstarter to finance the production.  The result is absolutely amazing, and a must see for anyone who believes that we live in a world where love must be respected.  The film won awards at numerous film festivals, including Best Documentary at both Outfest L.A. and the Tribeca Film Festival.  Rated R for adult content.  DVD includes some public service spots and the trailer.

5943826,5,B00EU8RB14,"This inspiring, touching movie really struck a nerve with me as I lost my partner in 1990 to AIDS.  His family were from California and showed no interest in him during his 2 1.2 year life struggle but when he died they were suddenly in our home in DC asking ""Is this his couch?  Is this his chair?  Where are his bank accounts.""  Thankfully, we had anticipated this and had written wills, Powers of Attorney and had all of our bank accounts as joint accounts with rights of survivorship.  He had totally protected me and as the house was mine alone they couldn't touch it--not that they didn't try. I was forbidden to even mention the word ""AIDS"" in the funeral service.  Now this last October I married a wonderful man--we had built a life together over the past 8 years.  I simply could not believe the callous, cruel disregard the Bridegroom family showed to their son after his death.  Cruelty towards others is not sanctioned in any Bible I have ever seen.  What they did was deliberate, premeditated and designed to cause Shane and his family as much pain as possible, all the while Tom's mother was pretending that Shane and his family were important to them and she lied the entire time.

5943828,2,B00EU8RB14,"The love story of Tom and Shane is touching, inspiring and memorable one. But the movie itself is struggling with its focus and actual message. The first part is the story of Tom and Shane growing up, hundreds of miles apart, going through the same struggle that young gay men face. While young Shane's unrequited love emboldens him to come out, he suffers devastating humiliation and this forces him to abandon his home, Tom arrives to this relationship without revealing to his family that he is gay. As their love develops toward long term commitment, Tom attempts to come clean and his mother seems to accept his lifestyle and partner. So far so good. Part two is a shocking tragedy, abruptly ending Tom's life. Part three is where the movie appears to focus its message. First, as the hospital emergency room staff does not recognize gay relationship as family, Shane is not allowed to be with the dying Tom (Case Against the System). This is truly, deeply heartbreaking, an issue that alone could have lifted this film above the status of a simple documentary. Unfortunately, though, it was not enough. Next, when Tom's family finds out about the tragedy, his mother comes to town and reclaims Tom's body, life and belongings. Tom's family does not allow Shane to attend his lover's funeral and does everything to erase or hide his existence along with the gayness of Tom from their and their hometown's memory (Case Against the Old Society). As far as the Case Against the System goes, the filmmakers should peruse that little law called HIPAA. As far as the Case Against the Old Society...

The filmmakers interviewed a large number of quite likable friends of the couple, some are family members, some friends (mostly gay), but every one of them are supportive, understanding and accepting toward them. But Tom's ""unaccepting side"" of his family was shut out of this movie, just as Shane was shut out from Tom's funeral. We never hear their side of the story. Of course they then come across as dumb, unsophisticated, stiff, closed minded people, stuck in the past, in dishonesty, in wanting their son to be straight. As such, they are depicted just as stereotypically as the other side was just decades ago. The film does not give them an opportunity to try to fight their way out of this clich, color themselves into loving, but tormented human beings, only to remain blurred, uninteresting, hopeless and predictable antagonists. Obviously the documentary makers feel they have no story as they are clearly wrong. But how could you change their mind without actually trying to understand them?

""Coming out"" is a process, a lengthy one, where first the gay person realizes his/her orientation, then, gaining the courage and conviction arrives to a deliberating confession. A ""Hero's Journey"", it is. Again, this is a process, aided by good and cheering kin spirits and supportive friends, reaching a cathartic conclusion when and if he/she is ready. But, to the (unsuspecting) family members it is a sudden shock, depending on their beliefs even a devastating one. They are not given time to process this, they have to accept it now or else. I personally felt sorry for Tom's mother. She made an attempt, a feeble one, to accept this couple, but when tragedy struck, her universe collapsed and she defaulted to her original, archaic feelings. She desperately tried to keep Tom's memory as she remembered him and was unable to accept the real, gay Tom and his lover. Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, anyone? There is no way of knowing that without this jarring tragedy Tom's family perhaps could come to accepting Shane, although it would have taken years to get there. So the movie, applauded by the gay community, shows very little inclination to offer an olive branch, while does not hesitate to judge anyone not accepting gay lifestyle without an awkward, hesitating and fumbling process. Preaching to the choir this part of the movie was.",1387584000,9,3943,4.918918918918919

I hope this film makes people understand that these guys were soul mates, they were best friends, they were two men who were truly in love with each other.

I've never been to Egypt or Paris or Machu Picchu or any of the other marvelous places they went together. I've never been in love, never had a serious lover or a husband or a partner or a relationship anything like theirs. I've lived alone all my life.

I tend to envy and resent people who have what I don't have; so what surprises more than any of you can know is that I'm not jealous of them, at all. I don't resent their youth or their beauty or their passion or their happiness or the adventures they shared or the delight they had in each other.

From my point of view, their story is a beautiful story of REAL love, of a blessed life, a holy life together that very, very, VERY few people ever know - maybe one in a hundred million, if even that many.

At my age I tend to see things long term, not because I'm wise but only because I'm old. I can't help it. When I look at things I see them in the context of centuries, not years. So when I look at Tom and Shane I don't see tragedy; I don't see injustice; I don't see the hateful, ignorant, fearful cruelty in some of the people around them.

Like it or not, those things are ephemeral. They don't last forever. LOVE lasts forever. Joy lasts forever. Beauty lasts forever. What Shane and Tom had will last forever, because, folks, Tom is not dead in any way that matters.

Bodies die, but the persons who live in the bodies never die. Tom is as real and as alive now as he was when Shane kissed him in front of the Eiffel Tower.

You can feel Shane's pain in this real life story of unequivocal love and tragic loss made all the more worse by society's mistreatment of two men in love. If you have a heart at all, even if like me you don't usually cry, this film will make you at least shed a tear. The great thing about this film is it didn't portray gay people in the highly inaccurate way the media usually does (as flamboyant and effeminate). Instead it showed that gay people are like anyone else - they can feel true love for one another and when tragedy happens they can feel heartbroken - and never quite be the same again. Watch it - it will definitely have some sort of impact on you. Highly recommended!",1386979200,3,778,4.335616438356165

5943851,5,B00EU8RB14,"I watched this beautiful documentary with my son, it was so inspiring and emotional. From the very beginning, Shane  is very honest in his growth to be true to hiimself through the struggles he confronts only to meet the love of his life Tom. With Tom, Shane finds a beautiful soul , the unconditional love, commitment and the respect Shane and Tom have for each other is touching.  Their personal journey of their life and happiness is a lesson to us all on how to live our own lives. The documentary shows the struggles of inequality in far too many couples and as in Shane's case, when the loss of the love of his life, the effects it has on what he can and can not legally do in many states. Shane has turned his pain , an unimaginable loss into an awe inspiring, strong and positive truth, we are ALL Equal. I strongly recommend this documentary for every one, whether you struggle with Equality issues or as myself am a Proud Mom who has two adult children who both deserve the chance to be married if they choose to. I'm so Proud of Shane and his family for supporting him through this very wonderful story of his life.

The fact is, a story like this has so much potential to make a powerful statement, but after I saw it, I was left feeling sad for the surviving partner and that's about it. Saying this film makes a statement about marriage inequality is a stretch, and calling it a love story doesn't really work either. The problem is is that we simply don't know enough about the deceased partner or the life they had together. It doesn't help that the man is essentially depicted as a saint who excelled at everything and was beloved by everyone who ever met him. We see countless photographs, videos and testimonials from friends and family, but apart from one brief clip featuring the couple together, we never get a sense of who they were as a couple. This despite that the surviving partner apparently has hours of footage of everything else, including their dog. As a viewer, I felt like I was kept at arms length the entire time, and then asked to be outraged when the deceased partner's family excluded the surviving partner from the funeral. Sad? Absolutely. But if this is meant to be a call to arms, it fails. A more balanced portrait (not to mention a better editing job) would have gone a long way to make a more powerful statement.",1386028800,3,1299,4.485232067510548
5943863,5,B00EU8RB14,"This movie is this generation's ""Brian's Song""  a guaranteed tear-jerker. The story is so tragic and underscores why granting the right to marry to everyone above the age of consent is so important. To be in love with and committed to another person is deeply fulfilling but, if tragedy should strike (as it did in this instance), means absolutely nothing in the eyes of the law. It is truly sad that Tom's family felt and acted the way they did but the law says they were completely permitted to do so. Anyone watching this movie cannot help but see the love that Shane and Tom shared and the wrenching grief Shane felt at Tom's death. To then have Tom's family try to shut him out and act as if he had never been a part of Tom's life is almost beyond comprehension. Shane proved himself a man of honor and principles by trying to respect the family's feelings even though they had disregarded his. I think he really displayed that whole ""turn the other cheek"" thing.

The movie is beautifully done and, hopefully, should be nominated for an Oscar for Best Documentary. And it *is* a documentary  none of it is made up. This is the reality faced when two people (no matter what gender combination) are forbidden to marry. I hope as many people as possible see this movie  especially those that don't understand why marriage equality is so important. I can see no valid reason why the law cannot be applied equally to any two people who wish to marry. I believe that marriage equality is coming but it can't happen too quickly for other couples like Shane and Tom. Unfortunately, their story is far from unique. This kind of emotional agony is experienced every day by people whose only ""mistake"" was to fall in love with someone who comes from a family that cannot or will not understand.",1386028800,6,1789,4.56386292834891

This should be required viewing for everyone in the Congress and Senate.  They need to know the extent of pain and suffering they are inflicting on the GLBT American citizens!  As it was stated in the documentary, this is not a GLBT or straight issue, it's a HUMAN issue.  Parents of GLBT youth should certainly purchase this documentary.

5943865,5,B00EU8RB14,"Like pretty much every else likely purchaser, I saw the original video on YouTube and saw that it had been made into a documentary, so I decided to purchase it. I was worried that it might be overly sentimental or sappy, but it actually steers fairly well clear of that. Given the tragedy it portrays, sentimentality is maintained at a pretty appropriate level throughout. I rather enjoyed the details about Tom and Shane growing up; I know some may think such details irrelevant, but I suspect those reviewers aren't from or familiar with a midwestern or mountain western upbringing themselves, which establishes a lot of context for why Tom and Shane were like they were and why they meant what they did to each other. Shane was fortunate enough to have a pretty large video and audio record of Tom, and frankly I had wished we had gotten to see a little more.

There is also not a shred of expressed ill will toward Tom's parents in this movie. Their unfortunate decisions, deplorable attitude, (and in the mother's case, what turns out to be pretty thorough deception) are told in a pretty matter of fact, here's-what-happened tone.

5943871,2,B00EU8RB14,"Earlier this year I happened to see a promotional video on YouTube for this documentary.  Watching the ten minute mini-doc which chronicled the last thirty minutes of this movie (the tragic death of Tom Bridegroom, and the horrible treatment his partner Shane received from Toms family) I found myself in tears.  It felt so honest and the emotional weight of loss and prejudice hit me like a ton of bricks.

I knew that I needed to see this film.

I saw this last night.

Bridegroom is a multifaceted title, for it simply states the deceases last name but it also foreshadows the films stance on equality.  As Shane states towards the films close, Tom was always denied his last name (in other words; they could not get married).  Sadly, one of my biggest qualms with this film is that lack of depth given to that aspect of this story.  As much as they state their frustration for not being able to marry, when the film gets into the guts of the story it is almost like that aspect of things is brushed completely over.  Lets mention it, but lets not add any depth.  Lets not attack the legality of it all and elaborate on the injustice we faced.  Lets simple state our inability to marry, and call it a day.

My issues don't remain there though, for a big problem I have with the film is the poor quality.  The film feels very amateur in construction, like something that was made for television (much like those I Survived shows) and the manipulative nature of much of the flashbacks felt painfully obvious and ill-advised.  I understand the devastation of the situation, but the use of sentimental music overlaid on montages of Shane and Tom laughing and cuddling felt sappy and tacky.  The whole first half of the film felt pointless, really.  The guts of this story have to do with the tragedy and what happened afterwards, but instead we get nearly 40 minutes of Shane growing up and his crazy great-grandmother and the fact that she doesnt remember anything about him moving or the fact that he was gay.  We don't need to know about this, and it all felt so uncomfortable to watch (those cheaply staged interviews).

I think this is what really bothers me.  They spent so much time elaborating on useless information, that when we get to the tragedy and the treatment Shane experiences afterward, it gets some passing remarks and a manipulative construction.  Yes, Toms parents were ashamed of their son and his lifestyle and they did everything in their power to cut Shane out of their lives and erase them from Toms past once he had passed.  That is awful and hurtful and very touching, but this documentary had to opportunity to make this bigger than a sole experience.  It had the chance to make a bold statement about the state of equality in the world today, and instead it seemed more focused on making Toms parents the chief antagonists.  Im not saying they deserve our respect for what they did, but by the films end this all felt so vindictive and distasteful.

And the less said about those video diaries the better, to be honest.

I hate to say this.  While watching the film (or really, while hearing the story for the first time) I felt truly touched and even connected to the story.  My brother is gay and my parents (and quite frankly, a lot of my family) has yet to embrace him and his partner, and so that aspect of this story resonated with me deeply.  Sadly, I felt as if this documentary dropped the ball and came across more self-serving than anything else, when it could have served a greater good than Shane Bitney Crone.

I am sorry for his loss and I am horrified at how he was treated by the Bridegroom family, and their lack of participation in this documentary (but really, can you blame them?) is unfortunate, but change is VERY hard for people set in their ways.

5943876,5,B00EU8RB14,"Amazing, see this movie! [Spoiler Alert!] This is a love story of Tom Bridegroom and Shane Bitney Crone. Tom is fascinated with Shane's great-Grandma Pat's snake killing prowess. ""I'm always after a snake, I don't want them around here."" So goes the plot. And she kills forty in a season - impressive. Revered Grandma Pat is the matriarch of this clan and she's one tough old bird. ""My mind is gone,"" she laments, but clearly, her strength of character is intact.  She declares of Shane and Toms' relationship, ""It's Romeo and Romeo, get over it."" Like Grandma Pat before him, Shane is called on to confront a bunch of snakes, first at Flathead High School (you can't make this stuff up), and again, almost a decade later in Knox, Indiana, with the likes of Tom's mom and dad. In the first encounter, Shane is too young and inexperienced to defend himself from these vipers and his soul and spirit are ruthlessly torn apart in collective acts of unimaginable cruelty, by high school classmates, parents, and a high school principal. He contemplates suicide - all this the consequence of a love note sent to a school-boy crush. But he survives, is patched back together by his loving mother and sisters, and at 18 he sets off for Hollywood. The family is afraid, but they have to let him go. Shane, the shy and unsophisticated high-school grad finds Tom, the Hollywood groomed, incredibly talented and popular, Culver Military/Vassar educated, too-handsome guy. It's not so surprising that they fall in love, hormones work that way, but the terms of the relationship are eye-opening. Tom positively thrives on Shane's emotional depth, no doubt a familial legacy of Grandma Pat. Shane finds in Tom his knight in shining armor, his protector, his first true love - his everything. Then tragedy. As if the camera lens connects him to the spirit world, Shane pleads with Tom, ""Is this really happening?"" It is. And it hurts.  A lot.
The most satisfying moment is the second time Shane confronts the snakes. It's Tom's family this time, an emotionally challenged clan that substitutes homophobic Bible verses for family values. The Bridegroom's attempt to sanitize their son Tom's legacy of any mention of the couple's six years together, to deny Shane any hint of consolation or compassion, colossal acts of cruelty and deceit. Unlike the Flathead disaster, and despite incredible odds, Shane is no longer a boy incapable of defending himself, and he has learned well the lessons of his elders. Most importantly, Tom has infused in Shane everything that he was - Shane is a force to be reckoned with. Even in the depths of despair, he plots his strategy with great skill, then engages battle on the first anniversary of Tom's death - defining the terms of engagement in his YouTube video, ""It Could Happen to You."" And it goes viral. And it is amplified in this documentary. Shane overwhelms the incredibly mean spirited snakes in Tom's family, yet in victory he is not hateful, even if the vanquished feel the sting of his victory. Nevertheless, all that remains is Tom's memory - enough perhaps to make Shane's life bearable, but that's all there is. And it still hurts. As a postscript, Flathead has not seen the last of Shane, he's scheduled speaking engagements there this November. Don't you wonder what the snakes think?",1384819200,7,3322,4.8674911660777385

But... I watched this with my husband recently and absolutely hated it. The bulk of the movie is spent on the surviving same-sex partner, covering trivial stories/details about the past... demonizing the parents (who are now also deceased) who stopped the surviving partner from attending the funeral )...  I just couldn't connect with the story beyond what I already knew. The details which were the most important (e.g., not being able to see his partner, the legal aspects of it, etc.) were brushed over and some completely overlooked. There are numerous clips where the surviving partner films himself crying with sad music in the background... it was... uncomfortable. And not in a good way.

I knew the story before watching the film and was really struck by the circumstances they encountered: man denied the right to see his dying/dead same-sex partner because their relationship is/was not recognized legally. I remember crying when I read about it. But this film... was such a huge disappointment.

The editing was also horrible, but I won't even get into that.

At the end of the day, I'm glad that an additional story is available in the media to help the public see that love can exist between two people of the same sex.",1384819200,30,1368,4.829059829059829

5943884,5,B00EU8RB14,"I've never written a review for anything on Amazon before, but for ""Bridegroom"" I couldn't stop myself. I'd discovered Shane and Tom's story back when Shane first made the YouTube video ""It Could Happen To You"", and just that 10 minute video had brought me to tears. When I heard that there was a full-length documentary being made, I couldn't wait to sit down and hear a more in-depth story of their life and love. Thanks to Netflix, I watched it yesterday, and within the first five minutes I was teary eyed. My eyes didn't dry for nearly 90 minutes. If you have a heart, if you have a soul, this documentary will drain you emotionally and stay with you. It's been over 24 hrs since I watched, and it's still all I can think about. Never have I been so haunted by a film. If this story doesn't open the hearts and minds of those who are against equality, then I'm not sure anything will. ""Bridegroom"" Is one of, if not the most powerful LGBT film there is. Watch. Learn. Love.

5943887,5,B00EU8RB14,"I caught this film on Netflix and was instantly hooked by the multi-layered story. ""Bridegroom"" begins as a story about growing up gay in a small town and addresses bullying and homophobia that both young men, Shane and Tom , faced. Fate brings them together in California and the two begin a wonderful relationship that is documented by friends and by Shane. Their careers take off, they travel, even their families seem to accept them. The Tom dies in an accident and this becomes something even more heartbreaking: a Partner is not allowed to say goodbye because he is not ""family"" and then is barred from the funeral by a family full of hate, ignorance, and denial. Anger and sadness give way to complete heartache when you witness Shane's video posing a few days after Tom's death. A couple Reviewers seemed put off by the fact that Shane and Tom are ""hot"" but that is irrelevant. Only at the film's conclusion do we learn that Tom's last name is Bridegroom when Shane makes the observation that ""Tom never even got to be what his name says.""

They are young and beautiful and full of life.  I am sure this has happened to many gay and lesbian couples.  This is the true account of what happens to two people who love each other but are denied the rights our government and society as a whole grant to heterosexual couples.  It is a beautiful story made most appealing by the beauty and sensuality of the characters. Highly recommended as it serves the purpose of bringing attention to the insensitivity of government laws.",1383609600,6,613,4.638888888888889

""Has this not happened before? Sad film and sad story but I have to ask. If these guys were not ""hot"" or ""cute"" as everyone is saying would people still care about this story? I don't believe this was put out there to raise attention but rather get attention. Sorry to the person who lost their life."" - November 3, 2013

Yes this has most certainly happened before. The LGBT community has most certainly been robbed of their rights not only by government officials but by their ""friends"" and neighbors. That the key players in this particular saga are ""hot"" or ""cute"" should not take away from the fact that this happened to them, has happened to others before, and will happen again and again... unless people like me and people like you stand up to it. If you are not hot or cute, so what? Still stand up to it. In comparison, think of all the white people who stood up to racism even though they themselves were not black.

Why care about this story? Because someone put their heart and quite possibly their soul into it. Because it's well-made. Because the fight for LGBT rights is far from over, though amazing progress has been made in the last few years. Because it could happen to someone who knows someone you know--or worse, it could happen to you.",1383523200,104,1377,4.4563492063492065

5943891,5,B00EU8RB14,"I saw this documentary at a film festival in Atlanta. If ever a film will tear your heart out, this is the one. The young man seated to my left wept softly during the last 30 minutes of this movie that only lasts 80 minutes.  The friend with whom I saw the film thought it was too sentimental. I disagree. ""Bridegroom"" is written, directed and produced by Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, who along with her husband,  gave the world ""Designing Women"" and ""The Man From Hope,"" a documentary about  President Bill Clinton. It has won awards  at festivals from Los Angeles to Little Rock and was produced after Shane Crone's posting on May 7, 2012, the anniversary of his beloved partner Tom's untimely death, ""It Could Happen to You"" on You Tube (with over three million hits and translations into twenty languages).

The story is simple: a young man from a small town in Indiana (Tom) meets another from a small town in Montana  (Shane) after both have moved to Los Angeles.  They fall in love, start a business together, adopt a dog,  travel to exotic foreign places together,  and plan to marry as soon as marriage between members of the same sex becomes legal in California. Then Tom dies in a freak accident. And his parents  show their awful true homophobic colors.

The film in a beautiful way reaffirms the importance of love in all our short lives here and should be a reminder to all same-sex couples to make sure your legal house is in order. These two young men, so in love and so looking to a long life together, had not prepared wills or durable powers of attorney.  As Shane Bitney Crone said in his remarks after the showing of this film, people in their twenties do not expect to die. (Somewhere in Los Angeles there are heroic nurses who risked their jobs by breaking hospital rules and allowing Shane, who was technically not a family member,  to come to the bedside of his dying partner.)

One of the best things about this film is that we get to see and contrast two families: Shane's who were supportive and did the right thing, and Tom's, who were reprehensible. (And we have seen their faces and know their actual names.) I was particularly moved by Shane's dad, who had the longest way to travel in accepting his son's homosexuality but made that journey. Additionally his ninety-one-year old great grandmother, although not always totally with it, was completely at peace with Shane and Tom as a couple.

While this film probably will only be shown in art theatres, it is available on DVD and should be seen by a wide audience, particularly those politicians in state government who do not believe that people of the same sex should marry and have the same rights as everyone else.

Highly recommended.",1383177600,11,2720,4.6471816283924845
5943892,5,B00EU8RB14,"That feeling when your heart aches, when you feel empathy for people you don't know but their grief is so palpable it feels like your own. Those are the feelings Bridegroom evokes. You would have to be made of stone not to be moved by this very beautiful, very tragic, very inspirational documentary. I don't want to get into the details of the documentary because simply put, my words wouldn't do it justice and other reviewers have already summarized it.

 The love these two had for each other is glaringly obvious. Watching everything Shane experiences as he tries to come to terms with losing Tom, emphasizes why equality matters, why the GLBT community should not be treated as second class citizens and why we need to be brave and open minded to accept people for who they are not who you expect or wanted them to be.

I was so moved by this story that I make it a point to recommend it to my friends, bring it up in conversations  and I write about it on all my social media pages. I have no doubt in my mind that this documentary will: Change hearts and minds (as it intended), it will make you cry and will play a significant role in convincing the remaining 34 states in the USA, to legalize same sex marriage.
