8207426,1,B000T28PMO,This video is a glossy overview of the Gulf War. A lot of focus on the personal lives of a few individuals. No mention of in-depth topics or events. And no mention of Gulf War Illness.,1328832000,,184,4.138888888888889
8207427,2,B000T28PMO,"I served 22 years active duty (now retired) in the U.S. Army, and served in the Gulf War (1990-1991).  I was looking for a decent documentary that covered that rather hectic time period in my life.  This comes woefully short.
This was made in late 2001, even though in says 2007 on the web site.
The DVD is barely 50 minutes long, so the events between August 2, 1990 and March 2, 1991 are covered very quickly, and not very thoroughly.
There is some decent footage of the war but not much.  It centers on interviews with a few Washington officials involved at that time, reporters, and about six veterans of the war.  One of those interviewed was the former SPC Nealy (Fort Bliss, Texas) who was captured by the Iraqi's in late January 1991 near Khafji, making her the first female POW since WWII.
There is no mention of the battle for Khafji (where Nealy was captured), which occured in late January 1991.  The Iraqi attack on Khafji, a Saudi Arabian town on Kuwait's southern border, was Saddam's attemp to get the coalition to prematurely start thier ground offensive.  His hopes were to cause enough U.S. casualties so he could get a cease fire, and be able to withdraw from Kuwait intact.  It didn't work.  Though the Iraqi's surprised the coalition, they were beaten back with heavy casualties.
At the end it talks a little about Gulf War Syndrome.  Also, being a bit dated it descibes how Saddam is still in power.
I'm still looking for a good Desert Shield/Storm Documentary. Don't bother with this, unless you know those people interviewed.",1219536000,12,1550,4.669117647058823
