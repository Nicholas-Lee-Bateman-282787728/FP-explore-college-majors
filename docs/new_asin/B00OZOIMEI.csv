6779872,5,B00OZOIMEI,An immensely important story to be disseminated worldwide.,1422489600,6,58,6.375
6779873,5,B00OZOIMEI,"This video sheds light on how part of the medical and hospital systems do not provide equitable treatment to children with Autism because they define them as mentally ill, and do not consider that many of their behaviors may stem from underlying medical symptoms.  Since so many children can't verbally convey their pain or discomfort, and parents opinions are often ignored, their conditions often slip through the cracks and worsen over time.  I know children who have been refused care for a host of conditions, including neuro-ophthalmologic care by specialists, even after being referred by their own top notch board certified pediatricians.  Its 2015, and its time that children with Autism, and all children be treated with dignity and respect by everyone, including the healthcare professionals licensed to do so. Also, I thought I knew a lot of the story from the media, but what really happened leading up to Alex's death was never fully explained by them. It is an ethical imperative for all healthcare professionals, educators and parents and policy makers to watch this video.",1422144000,10,1089,5.141242937853107
6779874,5,B00OZOIMEI,I thought I new this story. I followed it on social media. I didn't know the half of it. I can't express the importance of this movie. Everyone needs to watch this award winning film. It pertains to everyone dealing with the medical industry.,1422057600,10,242,4.5227272727272725
6779875,5,B00OZOIMEI,"This is a harrowing, heart breaking but MUST WATCH video. Every medical professional should have to watch it as part of their training. They have to see what can happen when the physical problems of autistic people are ignored and left untreated. And they should also see what can happen when autistic people are prescribed psychiatric drugs which they can't efficiently process. Even his poor mother was victim to these drugs, having been prescribed an antidepressant which can cause suicidal and homicidal ideation. This should never happen to another human being!",1418688000,15,566,5.230769230769231
6779876,5,B00OZOIMEI,"What happened to this boy is shocking and inhuman and the amazing thing about this film is that the filmmakers followed him around for months without knowing that there would be a dramatic murder. The footage they have of Alex suffering in one emergency room after another as he's shown to be unwelcome wherever he goes, and treated with an ever-expanding cornucopia of mind-numbing drugs is completely damning of the US healthcare system's approach to autism. Must see.",1415577600,19,470,5.038461538461538
6779877,2,B00OZOIMEI,"While I am very sympathetic to the plight of any caregivers with adult children far along on the autism spectrum, I have a problem with a documentary that so blatantly pushes a point of view (anti-mmr vaccine). It distracted from the already poignant story of a pair of caregivers at their wits' end trying to provide for the young man in a caring and supportive environment. It is well-known in the disability community that care for severely disabled children and adults can be extremely hard to access, and that should have been the relentless direction of the documentary. Instead, the former physician/surgeon Andrew Wakefield and his organization use this tragic situation to advance his thoroughly discredited research. Yes, some people have had serious reactions to vaccinations, as some people also have serious reactions to peanuts, strawberries, dog dander, etc. but to push this junk science as fact only obfuscates the real issue here, which is the lack of quality care available for people with serious disabilities and their families.",1433030400,4,1049,5.21301775147929
6779878,5,B00OZOIMEI,This is a heart felt movie of the love of a mother to a son with autism among many gastrointestinal problems.  The medical community needs to stop treating symptoms of autism and treat the underlying causes.  It is easy to stand in judgement of people and events until you can get a glimpse into the whole story as this movie does.  This movie is truly eye opening and should be seen by anyone who know a person diagnosed with autism.,1432252800,3,434,4.4
6779879,1,B00OZOIMEI,"Oh if only I could give zero stars. Andrew ""Andy"" Wakefield is a disgraced and disgraceful former doctor (he's been stripped of his credentials and rightfully so). This movie is another attempt to blame vaccines for autism.  A premise that's been proven wrong again and again.",1431907200,5,276,5.0
6779880,5,B00OZOIMEI,Eye opening movie.  Any one concerned about the healthcare system in the U.S. should watch this movie.,1427068800,3,102,5.0
6779881,5,B00OZOIMEI,This was an excellent documentary.  It reveals the truth of what happened to Alex Spourdalakis and how the medical community failed him miserably.  It enlightened and educated me on how so many kids in America are over medicated and how parents are running out of places to go for help.  EVERYONE should see this film.  It is a persons right to know the truth.,1425600000,5,360,4.578125
6779882,1,B00OZOIMEI,Can we please make Mr. Wakefield go away?  His attemps at using families to profit for himself are absolutely disgusting.,1425168000,8,121,5.05
6779883,5,B00OZOIMEI,"This documentary is something everyone truly needs to watch, This is a real true look into what families with autism have to deal with. This is vaccine injury, this is toxic overload, this is GMO's, this is REAL",1424649600,5,211,4.578947368421052
6779884,5,B00OZOIMEI,A sad reality. Very well done and heartbreaking.,1424390400,4,48,5.125
6779885,1,B00OZOIMEI,"Whitewashes a brutal murder of a child and promotes the work of  discredited quack Andrew Wakefield,  While this is an appealing combination, it seems not quite enough.  Perhaps if the producers also could have  worked in some Holocaust denial and chem-trails conspiracies it would have held my attention better",1424131200,11,311,5.285714285714286
6779886,1,B00OZOIMEI,"This ""documentary"" is anti-vaccination hype. It is clear that Alex Spourdalakis was murdered in cold blood. Vaccines have nothing to do with this. The ""documentary"" is an attempt to twist the facts of the murder and to blame vaccinations and ""the healthcare system"" for this heinous act. She tried to chop his hand off as part of the grueling murder process.",1423785600,10,358,4.885245901639344

8685873,4,B00OZOIMEI,"I really liked the documentary. It was informative of the backstory behind the frightening murder story heard on the news. I thought all this was quite interesting. I do want to squash some claims that this documentary is about vaccines -- it's not. It mentioned the MMR, once, and only as a potential catalyst of Alex's downfall at 18 months of age. The documentary goes into no further detail illuminating the risks of the vaccine, nor does it elaborate on the benefits. Why? Because this is not what the documentary is about. It is not about the anti-vaccine movement at all! I want to make that very, very clear.

The documentary is about how medical doctors refused to understand, or treat Alex accordingly. He had an underlying gastrointestinal problem that was causing him pain, which he was unable to verbally articulate, since he was mute. One example used in the documentary which I found quite convincing was that children that have autism use violence to best elaborate their feelings, and hurt. Alex one time cornered his counselor while walking up a flight of stairs with his mother and caregiver. He started to act violent, and the counselor immediately understood something was wrong. They all took him to the emergency room, only to find his foot was broken from sledding earlier that day. He was trying to tell them in the best way he knew possible. It is sad that the doctors did not understand that his actions were violent due to ""miscommunication"", as he was mentally ill, and in serious gastrointestinal pain. His mother, and caregiver tried repetitively to have doctors help them, and no one took them seriously. With this being said, I do not blame the medical facilities for the death one-hundred percent. There was an opportunity for a doctor in Boston to treat his gut issue (this is all documented and shown in the movie); however, the mother was led astray by another doctor giving an alternative diagnoses -- saying he could be cured by a few rounds of antibiotics. He was wrong and the antibiotics failed, and caused harmful effects to his digestive system.

It's an interesting portrayal. I honestly cannot imagine what these people went through trying to give Alex the best treatment. Yet, I do believe they should be held accountable for his death. The movie does not argue this -- yet, they are simply trying to explain the back story, and give the public more sympathy towards the parents struggling with children of autism, and the other factors that did indeed lead (or antagonize) his mother to murder him.

There was only two complaints. The movie was obviously low budget, and it is shown in the visual effects. I will not rate it down for this, as it is difficult to get funding on this type of material. However, they did mention that Alex was on anti-seizure medications, and implied that the doctors were ignorant, as he did not have any type of seizure disorder. Yet, using seizure medication is COMMON in those suffering from mental illness due to its intricate interactions with the brain's hormones. I am not suggesting this is a correct method, but it is far from ignorant, and it is according to protocol of psychiatrists. I am not exactly for this protocol, as it does have logical facilities in the research; however, it is not a mindless mistake to put a child on autism on these type of drugs. This needed to be better articulated. Other than that slight issue, definitely would recommend.",1455235200,6,3445,4.796296296296297

8685876,5,B00OZOIMEI,"I'm just disgusted with Dr Berman!! I took my one year old son to see this Doctor in 2013. My son was not diagnosed as ASD at the time, but I new that was the case. He had horrid reflux, and a slew of GI issues. I brought some info to my first apt, about the link between ASD & GI issues. He actually read it, and said that the truth was somewhere in between. I'm appalled that he let this boy down so horrifically. His mother clearly loved him, and felt deserted by EVERYONE! Just a devastating story.",1442966400,3,502,4.08080808080808

8685880,5,B00OZOIMEI,"A movie that all need to see.  Shows how the medical community as a whole has no idea how to treat a person with autism.  While treating GI problems may not be a cure, the improvement from treating that issue can literally be the difference between life and death.  I hope you view this as a wake up call and support research into the Gut/Brain connection.",1433376000,3,356,4.363636363636363
