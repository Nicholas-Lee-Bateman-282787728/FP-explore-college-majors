6432963,5,B00KJ1DD4U,"Love this show it's so Juicy....drama here I'm here for it... Power and Empire are two very different shows I watch both and their both good shows Power is Rated R and has more adult content. That's part of the reason it's on a premium channel which is not free and Empire is on Fox where anyone can watch without paying. Just because a has manly a black cast doesn't mean it's about the same thing, please don't listen to 50cent when comparing these two shows he's a little crazy now days. Watch the show if you haven't already",1481155200,,528,4.343434343434343

6432970,5,B00KJ1DD4U,"I caught ""Power"" one night. It peeked my curiosity.  Did this belong to a series, or was it a single show, movie perhaps?  I did some checking, it was a series. I quickly found series #1 on Amazon and ordered it. Holy Moley. I watched from episode 1 and was brought up to speed. About every bad thing you could imagine is conjured up in this drama. The two main characters are Ghost and Tommy, and both  are Hotter than fire. The sexy steamy sex scenes are just as hot. You'll blush in your own living room! The two leading role woman are of the same caliber.
Ghost is the best looking black night club owner in the world. And Tommy, his white partner... well he is the reason I watch the show. He is scary, gorgeous, cool, and tough as they come! Haven't seen anything as criminal and gutsy as this done on tv. Will order season 2. Season 3 just ended a couple of weeks ago. I have it recorded for safe keeping till I'm caught up. Try it, you'll be hooked, too.

6433024,5,B00KJ1DD4U,"A very good stylized drama with a sensible love story. The drama of this show is more so realistic and wealthy, adding core components of smartness in ways of how the negativity of drugs distributions affect lifestyle while St. Patrick makes the effort to pursue deliverance from the drug lifestyle to a legitimate business; while St. Patrick attempts for that deliverance he realizes that others don't want him to change. The show is filled with modest livelihood, elegance, practical thinking, uncensored sexual contents, and cleverness.
Power Season 1 can become of addictive show, and somewhat cultural in the diversity of Black, Latin and White entertainment blended together to make a interesting show in a sense of unity (which I really like about this show as well).",1455148800,2,774,5.150793650793651

Just a short briefing of the show. although there is good qualities to this show, it is filled with cliches and corniness. The story follows Ghost, a drug dealer who just happens to own the most successful night club in N.Y. first question, why even bother messing with crime if you already are succeeding legally? He encounters his 1st true love who just happens to be a huge success herself as the lead procecutor hunting him down although she doesn't know it. Really?? Oh by the way Ghost also happens to have the perfect marriage, kids and all, but out of the blue is willing to lose it all for someone he hasn't seen in 18 years. My biggest complaint is how they switch mid sentence form English to Spanish and back. It leaves the viewer not knowing if they should be watching what's going on or focusing on the bottom of the screen preparing to read a story. Lastly on the discs you go to choose episodes and they aren't numbered. With years of viewing dvd I've learned sometimes the episodes go in order from left to right and other times from top to bottom then over to the right top to bottom so you are risking watching episodes out of order if you choose wrong so it's best to select ""play all"" and skip thro those you've seen to get to a new one. All in all, I'd say if you're very bored and have seen all the top shows then give this a try, if not skip it. You aren't missing anything that hasn't been done better before",1453766400,2,1466,4.296028880866426

6433066,3,B00KJ1DD4U,"This could have been an outstanding series. Unfortunately, the writers, producers and actors are too caught up in using the N-Word and the B-Word, and promoting how cool it is to be involved in criminal activities, i.e., using & selling drugs, cold-blooded murdering of your enemies, having sex at will with anyone and everyone, how easy it is to lie and cheat and get away with it, and demonstrating how anyone can be bought at a price.
It's truly unfortunate the Black actors do not have enough self-respect for themselves and their young black audience to perform with dignity and pride. This is 2015, and one would think the Black community would resist any temptations to use the N-Word and the B-Word for the simple reason, young people who watch this program will think it's cool and fashionable to be disrespectful to one another and exciting to participate in criminal activities too - How can Black actors complain when they see the majority of our prison's filled with Black's? It truly shameful to see outstanding black actors tainting their skills promoting this behavior!",1444348800,2,1085,4.934426229508197

He wants to build network a of high end clubs. However, St. Patrick has a secret for he leads a double life. He is also a major drug dealer in New York City. His nuptials, family and his legit business will all become embroiled, as he wants to leave his felonious life behind and be a legitimate businessman. Actors Omari Hardwick (Ghost) and Naturi Naughton (Tasha) have real chemistry as husband and wife, even though their marriage is in free fall, for they are not only husband wife but also business partners, regardless of their marital situation

This is a very good crime drama, which is stylish and has a decent and vibrant sound track.",1439078400,,803,4.695035460992908

I also like to add that POWER and EMPIRE are both great shows, but are not in the same category. EMPIRE is more so like drama/comedy show; it's  similar to Glee but has a Hip-hop/drug twist to it. POWER on the other hand is more so a crime show with drug, guns, killing, sex, etc and a crazy love twist.",1439078400,3,388,4.243243243243243

EMPIRE is about the music industry and the head of the label and family, Lucien Lyons, who is expertly played by Terrence Howard, who rules with fear and with being a total tyrant.  POWER, on the other hand, is about James St. Patrick, aka Ghost, who has just opened one of the newest, hottest spots in NY, known as TRUTH.  Little do anyone know is that the club is being funded by drug money, because Ghost is an expert drug smuggler.  Well, Ghost has decided to try to give up the game.  He wants to go legit.  However, there are two factors here that won't let him leave.  One is Tommy, his best friend.  The other is T., his wife.  Neither wants him to go on the straight and narrow, because they love the money the game is paying off for them.  The struggle between doing what's right and doing what makes money makes this a fascinating series, and the introduction of Angela, a former flame who now works for the DEA, puts Ghost in a bind that's not easy to break, because he doesn't know about Angela's profession.  He just knows that by being with her makes him forget his present.  CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 2 TO BE RELEASED!!!!",1435795200,38,1210,4.376681614349776

6433150,5,B00KJ1DD4U,"Fifty Cent has made his transition from rapper to businessman to show producer with seemingly effortless movement. This is accomplished because Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson surrounds himself with talent that's undeniable. Omari Hardwick was a major addition as the lead, James St Patrick aka Ghost. Most of us don't have a complicated life as a drug distributor/club owner/family man. However, Omari makes a convincing argument that such a life can be well packaged. After serving as eye candy for the ladies in BET's ""Being Mary Jane"", Hardwick shows his acting chops extend beyond a well pressed suit. His wife, played by former 3LW member Naturi Naughton expects Ghost to maintain and ascend his illegal empire. Ghost, however is tired of the street life; the underground lifestyle, murders and watching his back. However, his partner Tommy will do everything he can to remind Ghost the street life is what made them and what will keep them. So much to say but this show sells itself well to those who love to see what happens next. The first season justified the recent entry of the second season on Starz.
