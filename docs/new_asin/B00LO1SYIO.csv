6494979,4,B00LO1SYIO,"For those of you who, like me, are interested in which episodes of ""Strawberry Shortcake's Berry Bitty Adventures"" are contained on this DVD, here is the list:
01. ""The Berry Big Harvest"" (November 5, 2011) - Orange's store is overflowing with Berrykin Bloom's new line of Berry Bitty Fruits & Veggies. Orange thinks she can tackle any challenge, but things soon get comically out of control.
02. ""Room At The Top"" (November 12, 2011) - Strawberry adds a new bedroom over her produce marketplace with her friends' help.
03. ""On The Road"" (March 29, 2012) - The girls go to the city for a concert and must teach the Berrykins how to keep the town running while they're away.",1408752000,13,673,4.663865546218488

6494981,5,B00LO1SYIO,"I purchased this for my 4 year old daughter.  This is the 5th Strawberry Shortcake DVD I have purchased for her and she loves them all.  They are perfect for her age and all have a great story line she can follow with great values.  They are great movies to have on hand for girls between the ages of 3-6 over 6 and they tend to lose interest.  Highly recommend for little girls.

*I paid full price for this product and the opinions stated are based on mine or my familys use of it.",1466380800,,483,4.095744680851064
