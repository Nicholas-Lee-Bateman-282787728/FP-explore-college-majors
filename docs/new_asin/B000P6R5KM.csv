This volume could be considered filler, but not by me. We get to know some of the supporting characters, like Karura, Oboro, and Kamyu. Hakuoro is also visited by the empress of a neighboring country. She also wears a mask to hide her appearance. This was a welcome break from the intense action and drama. Even though things are more relaxed now, another war is on the horizon.

Once again, I am singing the praises of Utawareumono. This series is a welcome change for me. There are so many convoluted mecha and harem animes out there that one focused on a plot and compelling characters is like a breath of fresh air. I have seen some great harem and mecha anime series, but I prefer a good drama and compelling characters. Utawarerumono has both. I love it! I hope you do to!",1354492800,2,919,4.502994011976048
