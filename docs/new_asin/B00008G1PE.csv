7982425,5,B00008G1PE,"If you're wondering why I still have a VCR & buy VHS tapes from thrift stores & occasionally order them online, I present to you Macron 1 as exhibit A.  The tapes with episodes of Disney Afternoon shows not available on DVD are exhibit B (especially this one & all the Aladdin tapes).  Anyways, this was always my favorite of the Haloween Disney tapes.  Monster bash had one of the worst Ducktales on it, Boo Busters had a great Chip N' Dale, but they both had Goof Troop, one of my least favorite Disney Afternoon shows.  This one had Darkwing Duck & Chip N' Dale Rescue Rangers on it, so already we have my 2 favorites of the 4 shows released (Ducktales was my favorite as a kid but not anymore although it's still great).  The Darkwing Duck episode Ghoul of My Dreams is an excellent episode featuring my favorite guest character Morgana.  Like I said, I'm a huge fan of romance as an element, & this does not disappoint.  But that episode is available on the Darkwing Duck Volume 2 DVD.  So why do I still keep it?  Because it has my all-time favorite Chip N' Dale Rescue Rangers on it!  Good Times Bat Times, which sadly isn't available on either DVD set, focuses on Dale, my favorite character & gives him a girlfriend in Foxglove, a cute & extremely likeable bat.  The villains are some of the best too.  I usually find the human villains pretty lame, but Winifred is very effective, & I love her henchman Bud the snake & Lou, who's probably the cutest spider in all of animation.  This episode also has exciting action, great comedy & good animation by Walt Disney Japan.  What more could you ask for?  I give it 5 stars despite it being half obsolete because it's an excellent & very romantic collection.  And it has my favorite Rescue Rangers on it.  I've seen it dozens of times & have yet to get tired of it.",1365552000,,1820,4.385074626865672
7982426,4,B00008G1PE,Very good cartoon shows and Darkwing duck isn't a bad episode but the R and R isn't a very good episode. It is still one tape that you should because over all it isn't bad.,1185580800,,172,3.942857142857143
