8195418,1,B000QCQ8B2,"I am a big supporter of independent film making, especially when it involves T&A, but June Afternoon in simply not worth the money. The production quality is very low, however the must disappointing element is the lack of creativity (no story, no dialogue, not artsy!). Whoever was shooting this was obviously lacking vision, erotic or otherwise. The model is cute but she is boring and fails to bring that certain amateurish charm I was hoping for. The only redeeming part of this DVD is the extremely short run time (30 minutes). I tried contacting the production studio to find out more about their business, but they are nowhere to be found.",1258416000,5,645,4.81981981981982
