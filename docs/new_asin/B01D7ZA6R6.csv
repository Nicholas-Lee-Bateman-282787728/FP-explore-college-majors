8755166,5,B01D7ZA6R6,"This is a great video! All the positions are easy to understand, and with each position Lynn explains the benefits. You can choose from different sections, depending where you're during your cycle. I always feel better after each session, and it's incredibly easy to memorize a few and do them everyday. I have no doubt that doing these routines will help support fertility, and calm the mind.",1512259200,,393,4.880597014925373
8755167,5,B01D7ZA6R6,"I've been in Lynn's yoga class in Seattle for over a year, and supplement it with an at-home practice with this DVD. The DVD routines are excellent, and Lynn does a great job of explaining the purpose and benefits of each position. It's almost like being in her class. The two different routines based on where you are in your cycle are really helpful. I have found that doing this DVD at home helped me better manage my emotions and health during a sometimes difficult fertility journey.",1497571200,,488,4.620689655172414

The yoga routine was gentle and easy to follow, the voiceover gently guided me through the practice and the music was deeply relaxing. The author guided me step by step and made it so easy to follow along. I would highly recommend this DVD, and I also like the book by the same author.",1467763200,,355,4.313432835820896
