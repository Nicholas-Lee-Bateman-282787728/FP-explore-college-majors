4990587,5,B006IOJKUI,This was a gift for my nephew who loves Radiohead.  He was so excited to get this so I'd recommend this for other Radiohead fans.,1354320000,,129,4.16
4990588,5,B006IOJKUI,"Jeez, I've watched this about a dozen times. For 60s Beatles fans like me, this is what ""Let It Be"" should have been. A killer band recording an album in front of cameras without overdubs. And it looks and sounds great.

The weird thing is, this is much better than the official ""King Of Limbs"" album. I bought the WAV download of the official album when it was released, and I liked it, but the only song that REALLY clicked was ""Morning Mr. Magpie"" (which, I think, is about a morning bird singing outside and screwing up your songwriting efforts).

The rest of the album was good, but the ""glitch"" effect was applied too liberally, distracting the listener's attention from the song. (To hear glitch at it's best and most melodic, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE pick up the rather expensive import CD of ""Tronika"" by Sketch Show. It's one of my top twenty albums!)

This DVD puts the songs in a different light. There's two drummers keeping the weird rhythms going along with three guitars (and the occasional retro keyboard). My God, it works VERY well. I actually took the time to capture the audio to CD. This is a killer album.

This is way up there with stuff like The Talking Heads' ""Stop Making Sense"". Buy it now, before it's gone.

(P.S. ""Giving Up The Ghost"" is the most sublime and breath-taking musical performance I have on video.)",1348099200,9,1339,4.609243697478991
4990589,5,B006IOJKUI,"Radioheads King of Limbs is an excellent short-play album, yes album, I own it on vinyl.  This video is excellent, just the band playing in the studio, no elaborate out-takes or nonsense.  The only negative remark I have is that it appears to be dubbed from the studio mix and not actually played live.  Personally I prefer live mixes vice the studio cuts.  Other than that this is excellent.",1345680000,,392,4.63768115942029
4990590,5,B006IOJKUI,"So I kept this on my DVR for months.  Supposedly high def in 5.1 surround - recorded off Palladium (with commercials of course).
In an effort to clear room off my DVR, I ordered the DVD because I already knew this was a keeper.  Watched it over and over again.
When the DVD came, I had to do a little A-B comparison between the 1080i on DVR and the lowly 480p that is the DVD.
(Let's forget the fact that the DVD has no commercials and 3 more songs than the broadcast version.)
I was floored by the sound and video quality of this DVD.  It simply blew away the recording I had been saving for months in both sound and picture quality. No comparison - this DVD is superb.
I'm just saddened by the fact that I can't find ""In Rainbows Live from the Basement"" on DVD.  I have to enjoy watching those videos with headphones on my iPod.
Simply put, their Live from the Basement stuff is unbelievably good.  Sound/Video/Live Performances as good as they get!
Highly recommended...",1344902400,9,973,4.383333333333334
4990591,5,B006IOJKUI,"I am a new Radiohead fan and I have bought all the books, DVD's and CD's I can find. I love this DVD because the music is beautiful and the band members are more at ease than on stage. I play it over and over. I am especially glad that Staircase and Super Collider are on the video. I just want more!!!",1342310400,3,302,3.8870967741935485
4990592,4,B006IOJKUI,"I didn't love the KOL CD. Then I saw them perform 7 of the 8 songs live and really
liked most of them, especially Separator, Mr. Magpie (James Brown from Jupiter) & Given up the Ghost (early '70's Neil Young).
If you can't see them in concert (tix are always tough to find) at least get both ""In The Basement"" DVD's.
KOL has at least 10 songs (vs. 8 on CD). After you watch it 2 or 3 times, the songs that sounded unformed or droning on the album start to grow on you like a fungus. Yes, I love The Bends & OK Computer too, but that was then, this is now. You can sit around grousing, or open yourself up to what they're doing now. Seeing them in concert helps the transition. I'm not sure their enormous, layered sound can be contained on a CD anymore.",1334534400,22,753,4.094594594594595
4990593,5,B006IOJKUI,"This dvd is similar to the in rainbows dvd where they play in a basement without a crowd watching. Both of rainbows and KOL are played just like the cd Thom Yorke sings phenomaly. Plus this video has the rare cuts that were not included on the cd. If you are a fan its a no brainer, buy it.",1329955200,2,290,3.9322033898305087
4990594,1,B006IOJKUI,"The BluRay will simply do not run on any PS3 in the US, as well as a lot of BluRay players (in fact, all the players i could access to). Why? I quote an email i received from W.A.S.T.E. (the company behind the BluRay): ""The Blu-Ray video was encoded at 25fps and remained this way as converting to 30fps drastically reduced the visual quality. This does mean however that some US region locked players may experience play back issues due to the standard setting of 60fps in the States.""
But obviously this is a classic problem when editing videos, it only shows that this company has no experience or whatsoever when they target the international market. They just hide behind the ""quality excuse"" to justify a mistake they made.

W.A.S.T.E. has a name that fits them well: a big waste on time and money...",1329436800,7,806,4.597222222222222
4990595,5,B006IOJKUI,"I had been anticipating this release for a long time and have watched various low quality versions of the performance. After receiving it I was totally blown away by the amazing video and sound quality after watching such low quality versions. The performance has such a different feel from the album. It feels more complete, powerful and organic. I can't stop watching it, and it's great to have the addition of the three non-album tracks, the daily mail, staircase, and supercollider, which are all excellent songs. While some will mourn the days of (insert your favorite album here), I think Radiohead are at the top of their game and the performance certainly reflects that.

As a side note on the Blu-ray, which I received, I had no difficulties playing it and I live in the US. Radiohead noted on there website that there may or may not be some playback issues in some other countries. I'm assuming this is why the DVD is also included.

No matter how you watch it though, you'll certainly love it.",1329091200,14,1004,4.698863636363637
4990596,4,B006IOJKUI,"I love Radiohead. They are one of my favorite bands and their music is so much better than most of what we hear today. I was very excited when I heard news that they would be releasing a live from the basement session on not just DVD, but for the first time a Blu-ray release! Now, I've watched the DVD, and it is fantastic. They really set the bar performance wise and have grown over the years in maturity. Picture quality looks great. Nothing to complain about. The sound quality is pretty good too. It comes in either Dolby 5.1 or PCM 2.1 stereo. The problem with this release though is the Blu-ray. It is encoded in a different region (B or C) and will not play on a standard Blu-ray player here in the U.S., which is very disappointing. I hope this gets re-released as a region 1 Blu-ray soon so we can enjoy the DTS HD 5.1 master sound quality. For now, the DVD will suffice.",1328486400,12,882,4.255952380952381
4990597,5,B006IOJKUI,"TKOL is fantastic live!  DVD has great audio, mostly good shots for the video.  Quality is definitely better than various free versions of this session available online.",1465516800,,169,5.222222222222222
4990598,5,B006IOJKUI,A killer DVd and much worth your money. Radiohead fans should pursue immediately,1465084800,,80,5.230769230769231
4990599,5,B006IOJKUI,Great live performance and the dvd comes with a booklet as well.,1457568000,,64,4.416666666666667
4990600,2,B006IOJKUI,Blu ray doesn't work,1453680000,,20,4.25
4990601,4,B006IOJKUI,"Like many Radiohead fans, I enjoyed The King of Limbs but found it to be somewhat disappointing after masterpieces like Kid A, OK Computer, In Rainbows, and The Bends. With this live release, though, the band not only re-arranged the track listing and re-instated two outtakes (The Daily Mail and Staircase, both of which are very good and should have been on the actual album); they also took material that sometimes felt a little lethargic and brought it to life with a level of energy and passion that much of the original album lacked. Bringing in a second drummer (Clive Deamer, from Portishead) may sound like a silly idea, but he and Phil Selway play terrifically together and add a strong percussive drive that many of these songs benefit from.

The King of Limbs: Live From the Basement is a better-paced, more energetic rewrite of the original album; whereas The King of Limbs worked decently in its studio incarnation, it works fantastically here. The band sounds terrificnot many contemporary bands could play their latest studio album from start to finish with no overdubs or second takes and do it so well. Overall, this is a perfect release for people who love Radiohead and if you don't love Radiohead, well, add that to your ""to do"" list.",1452470400,,1255,4.810185185185185
4990602,5,B006IOJKUI,A fantastic rare recording. Sound Quality and Picture are excellent. I ripped the PCM tracks to a CD so I can listen to it anywhere.,1447718400,,132,4.32
4990603,5,B006IOJKUI,"As a frequent visitor to live music venues I thoroughly enjoy watching as well as listening. I find ""The King of Limbs"" addictive and I have watched it many times. The energy and interaction of the musicians and the voice of Ed O'Brien keep the 'live' quality of the music; it is more real and more raw than obtainable on a CD.
The packaging is an additional gift. The bound book with strong graphic layout and excellent photographs makes this a 'must have' for not only lovers of live music but also for lovers of well designed books.",1432339200,2,535,4.469387755102041

4990605,5,B006IOJKUI,"Amazing, and includes one of their best songs - ""Staircase"". Why that didn't make the album, I don't know.",1428537600,,106,4.631578947368421
4990606,4,B006IOJKUI,Very mellow and somewhat maudlin - makes you reflective.... You need to follow written lyrics to be able get any understanding of the singing. Bass is very heavy - max your treble if you don't want every loose object in the room to vibrate!,1423785600,,240,4.4772727272727275

4990609,5,B006IOJKUI,"Some songs from this studio session sounds go much better than the album recording.  While both are amazing, I feel like Radiohead's live performances are absolutely breath taking; especially their From The Basement sessions.",1389916800,,225,5.617647058823529
4990610,5,B006IOJKUI,"Nigel is a boss. If you love radiohead, buy this DVD for yourself, your friends and your family. :) These songs you've heard 1000000 times sound new each time. The whole live from the basement series is such a fantastic idea. If my house was burning, this DVD is one of the items I'd grab for sure.",1389830400,6,298,4.245614035087719
4990611,5,B006IOJKUI,Got this for my husband. We watched it with cigars and cocktails... Amazing!!! Amazon made it easy to purchase and enjoy,1377561600,,120,4.761904761904762
4990612,3,B006IOJKUI,"Very quickly- the actual content of this is amazing.  I love the concept of From The Basement and the power and talent of Raduohead is on full display.  If only one of could be a fly on the wall for a session right?

But the main reason I am writing this is because if you are looking forward to the full 1080p version with any type of lossless sound and live in the US, chances are you may be disappointed.  I tried it on 4 different blu ray players and it will not work.  The reason is because of the different frame rate they used (I believe 50fps) and the inability for most N. American blu ray players to play this.  It is not a region code issue at all as some may believe.  If it weren't for this issue I would give it 5 stars.

Luckily it comes with the DVD also but it's still disappointing spending the extra money for the blu ray disc that doesn't work.  I should add however that some players may not any trouble playing this (most high end Oppos can play it).  I should add that my PS3 as well as 2 Panasonic players was not able to handle the frame rate.  (They all have latest firmware as well).

My recommendation is to verify your player can handle the frame rate before buying the blu ray version.  Otherwise save the $$ and get the DVD version.",1377388800,11,1263,4.148148148148148
4990613,5,B006IOJKUI,"from the packaging that resembles a book, I knew this was going to be good..
and wasn't wrong, this is probably one of the best (if not THE best) music dvd I have seen!
The first time I watched it, I was with some friends, and we just couldn't stop playing again the whole thing.
The shots are great, quality is perfect, and it sounds amazing.

4990615,4,B006IOJKUI,"I gave negative feedback to the seller (Movies, Cds Games & More)because the Blue Ray disc would not play in any of my devices. However, the DVD played beautifully which was the reason I did not return the item. This show is excellent and as many reviewers suggest this is exactly what making music is about. I highly regard vendors that take responsibility for their products and make the effort to keep customers happy. I have just received a phone call from Shawn at Movies, CDs Games & More who's offered me a $10 refund for the unfortunate Blue ray disc, which I thought it was only fair. He mentioned that given my experience and that of a couple of other customers, they have decided to remove the product from Amazon, a fair move as well.",1361836800,,746,4.492647058823529
4990616,5,B006IOJKUI,"This DvD is an immense pleasure to watch for music lovers. These are the same kids from Meeting People is Easy, just few more creases on their foreheads! Thankfully for us, there is no sign of their acquired fame or celebrity, they are the same focused, dedicated, poised musicians! It's a thrill to see them up close, the camera moves around and captures subtleties, it is a thoughtful, art minding movie.
Because these are artists, at work! The music is metamorphosing again, transgressing genres, it is a rock band that plays a jazz symphony. The music feels layered, there is a steady foundation of drums, on which there are brush strokes of diaphanous melody, of sublime beauty...Debussy's Preludes for Piano came to mind in their delicate experimentation with sound!
King of Limbs is a strange album. It might not grab your attention immediately, the way In Rainbows did. The music is insidious, there are elegies and ballads, they will slowly seep into your consciousness until you can't get them out of your head!
That's right, Little By Little, give them a chance to creep into your blood! Let the eeriness of Separator surround you. Oh, how I love the way this song builds up, those strange harmonies, they manage to be lofty and tense at the same time!
The heavy emotional burden of Codex...
Staircase... I did review that before, how much I love it, I should have given Phil Selway more credit though, yes Clive Deamer is there too, but if you can imagine a Radiohead without Phil... I can't! The drums- the foundation of a rock band... just think Idioteque, if you need an example of his gifts!
Of course there had to be a Lotus Flower, the whole album has a Buddhist feel, a detached, enlightened acceptance ( I am not trying to interpret any of their meanings, that is every listener's duty)
In Chicago, we are lucky, XRT airs Lotus Flower on the radio. The way American radio goes nowadays though, this Radiohead can't go on it anymore! This music has no commercial streak in it, it is a search for beauty and knowledge...these guys managed to stay true to themselves and to their art!
"" I'll set you free... Just to see what if""
My only regret is that Identikit is not on it, I'm not familiar with the timing, maybe it was not put together then. It is on the Austin City Limits concert. It is great to see them there, adored by an audience, but this DvD gives you the intimacy of a private performance!  Treasure this gem!",1360454400,2,2439,4.606896551724138

8498728,3,B006IOJKUI,"Buyer beware that there is no ""exclusive downloadable version"" that comes with the package should you buy it from Amazon; as far as I can tell, that's only true for those who order the DVD directly from Radiohead's website.  This essentially means that you can only listen to the Basement recordings in a DVD player unless you have the software to rip it into another format, which really limits your listening flexibility for this incredible performance.
