1109982,4,6306010971,"We rented this video based on the legend on the cover, and didn't quite realize it would turn out to be the treat that it eventually was. This brilliant adaptation of a Somerset Maugham novella turns out to be one of the best things about 2000's art-film scene, though it has gone largely unnoticed, and even passed the eyes of critics without so much as a murmur.
That is sad, because 'Up at the Villa' features Kristin Scott Thomas in her strongest and most well-written role yet. This is an actress who deserved to pick up an Oscar for 'The English Patient', but her performance in this film beats that hollow. It also stands out because its a faithful reproduction of the character in the novella, making this feature one of the more successful book-to-movie transfers.
Sean Penn however, falters. In a role that could well be carried out by anyone from Henry Thomas to Harrison Ford, Penn is dull, lifeless and utterly uninteresting. However, his chemistry with Thomas is fodder enough to keep this film on its feet and the fast pace never slows down, even in the slower conversational segments. Set in Florence, Italy, the cinematography is flawless and the acting superb, though the real scene-stealer could well be Anne Bancroft, in a role that she walks through splendidly.
The story is simple : Scott Thomas is a penniless well-bred girl at the Villa of her beau, an aging man soon to be the Governor of Bengal (they are all British, by the way). Shes doing it solely for the money and the sense of security, as her last marriage was a total disaster and she 'doesn't believe in love anymore'. It takes Sean Penn, a smooth talking American to make her see that passion is what makes life worth living, and that one must take ones' chances. This lends the film a predictable and thoroughly plain ending (it even read quite plainly in the book, if I remember) but it works.
This film made me realize what a treasure we have in Kristin Scott Thomas. She has one of the most expressive faces and such an excellent sense of timing. She also carries herself with the most regal bearing, bringing to mind the days of Ava Gardner and Audrey Hepburn. No contemporary actress can hold a candle to Thomas - at least not in this film!
'Up at the Villa' should be seen for many reasons. One, its not often that an unsung movie of this calibre shows up. Second, the performances of all the female leads are outstanding, and third, the screenplay is the best I have ever witnessed the whole of this year. This is story telling at its' masterful best, and it should not be missed. Compelling, essential viewing.",980035200,32,2605,4.604301075268817
1109983,4,6306010971,"I am used to having Sean Penn, Kristin Scott-Thomas and Anne Bancroft completely knock me out in their screen roles.  However, I'm also well accustomed to not being one of writer Somerset Maugham's fans.  His writing bores me to death on the written page. The era of this work should have inspired impassioned writing.  It takes place right before the Fascists take over Europe, before the outbreak of WWII, in Florence, Italy.  Since it is Maugham's writing though, it always verges on the strained.  Nevertheless, the actors give it all they've got and there is a good night's home viewing for you here.  Scott-Thomas's character is attracted to security in the form of possibly marrying a real dullard of an older suitor.

Actor Fox seems to embody my idea of Maugham himself as that stuffed shirt.  Scott-Thomas is also attracted to adventure and danger in the form of a married man, Penn, and a penniless Austrian refugee.  Advising her throughout is Bancroft, who married for money, not love, and now enjoys her well-heeled and titled widowhood.  Who does Scott-Thomas choose and what are the problems along the way?  You'll have to watch it to find out.  My only regret is that these actors didn't have five star material at their disposal.  The way hubby put it was, ""Well, I guess you can't expect 'The English Patient' or 'Dead Man Walking' every time out.""  Indeed.

1109984,3,6306010971,"A rich period piece centered on the lives of wealthy residents of pre WWII Florence, ""Up At The Villa"" is lovely to look at, but dull to watch.  The story focuses on about four days in the life of Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas), an English socialite living in Florence.  Mary's serene and boring life is turned upside down by a proposal from Sir Edgar (James Fox), a very wealthy man she doesn't love; her fascination with Rowley Flint (Sean Penn), a roguish playboy who irritates and attracts her; and a peccadillo with an indigent Austrian refugee.  As if that is not enough excitement for the bland widow, the refugee commits suicide when she tries to explain to him that their night of passion wasn't true love, but an act of kindness and pity on her part.
The principal problem here is that the main characters are so flawed that the viewer is unable to care about anything that happens to them.  The only charismatic character is Princess Ferdinando (Anne Bancroft), a delightfully irreverent busybody.  Mary makes so many bad decisions in such a short period that it is difficult to have any respect for her.  Rowley is simultaneously repugnant and pathetic and Sir Edgar is about as interesting as a decapitated mushroom.
The best thing about the film is the cinematography and the period renderings.  Director Philip Haas and cinematographer Maurizio Calvesi combine to bring us breathtaking scenes of Florentine splendor.  The Villa that was selected was majestic and the period costumes, cars, furniture and props were wonderfully accurate.  This natural beauty in conjunction with some excellent lighting effects made this film a feast for the eyes.
Kristin Scott Thomas' performance was marvelous despite the haplessness of her character.  She was emotional and confused, and she looked lovely doing it.  Sean Penn was utterly miscast as Rowley.  Penn is best playing offbeat and outrageous characters.  In his attempt to contain his natural outlandishness, he came across as far too restrained and lacked the dashing and cavalier attitude that one expects from such a playboy.  Together they had as much chemistry as used dishwater.
The best performance was unquestionably that of Anne Bancroft.  She gave an unrestrained and effluent performance as the Grande Dame that glistened with dynamic energy.  It is too bad she didn't get more screen time.
I rated this film a 7/10 on the strength of the photography and a great performance by Anne Bancroft.  The story isn't bad, but it is far from inspiring.  It will probably play better to female audiences than male due to the highly emotional nature of the heroine.",974160000,2,2632,4.983981693363845
1109985,2,6306010971,"Despite some quality elements, foremost among them a lovely performance by Kristin Scott Thomas, `Up at the Villa' emerges as a fairly dull, ultimately unsatisfying tale of stiff-upper-lipped romance played against a wartime backdrop. In a way the film serves as something of a companion period piece to the recent `Tea With Mussolini' since both films involve wealthy American expatriates living and flourishing in Italy in the days leading up to the Second World War.
Thomas stars as Mary, a young British widow who, while she is occupying a Florentine villa, finds herself the object of romantic overtures by an assortment of men including a wealthy but married American man, Rowley Flint (Sean Penn), and a penniless Viennese refuge (Jeremy Davies) with whom she has a one night stand. Shattered by her rejection the next night, the latter commits suicide in front of the distraught woman and it is in the attempt to cover up the incident with the help of Rowley that the film's few moments of genuine drama can be found. One of the problems with the story, based on a Somerset Maugham novella, is that, although Mary comes across as a sympathetic and often even a complex character at times - she is a caring, well-intentioned woman whose pampered existence leaves her unsuited for confronting the harshness of much of the world around her - the men whom she involves herself with emerge as both incredible and shallow. Penn seems particularly miscast in a role that calls for debonair subtlety when all he seems to be able to provide is insipid callowness. Indeed, rarely has a pair of screen lovers conveyed less dynamic chemistry than this one does here. Anne Bancroft provides dramatic intensity in her stereotypical role of the aging grand dame, but unfortunately, she doesn't get the screen time one would have liked seen accorded either her or her character.
The film is indeed stunning to look at, filled with views of beautiful Florentine architecture and the lush Italian countryside, but the look of the movie is not enough to distract us from the overall languid pacing, the undramatic exposition, and the lightweight histrionics of Mr. Penn. As a result of such unequal pairing, Kristin Scott Thomas seems almost as if she is occupying this film alone for long stretches of time. Considering the utter richness and beauty of her performance that may not be such a bad thing overall - but `Up at the Villa' provides her with precious little support all the way around.  **1/2",973382400,7,2492,4.9052132701421804
1109986,4,6306010971,"UATV is from a Somerset Maughin novella. It takes place as World War II reaches Italy. Kristin Scott Thomas plays a complex Mary Panton, widowed,  in search of romance and a rich husband, who stays at her friend's Florence  Villa. Sean Penn plays the catalyst, Rolly Flint, a dashing American  playboy out for fun and frolic. But Mary Panton is about to accept a  proposal from the older Sir Edgar (played by the worst actor I've seen in  years, James, or is it Edward Fox, one of them can act, to quote another  reviewer) and she spurns Flint's offer. She has four days to decide to  accept the marriage proposal and thus change her life and move to India  with Sir Edgar. In the meantime, Flint makes his play for her. But Mary  makes a play for a penniless refugee, who is a restaurant Waiter turned  terrible violinist. The violinist falls in love with our Mary and kills  himself in the process. Why she would jump in the sack with this loser is  beyond me and obviously the scriptwriter as well. There's no stisfactory  lead-in to action here and the explanation that she wants to do something  'good' is too comical to be believed. But, hey, Penn gets her out of the  mess!
Anne Bancroft is the light touch with thoughtfully-placed humour.  The directing by Philip Haas is amateurish at best and is drastically  annoying. A film school dropout could do better! Or perhaps it's the  editing and the major continuity mistakes. But--and it's a BIG 'but'--the  real pleasure is watching Kristin Scott Thomas in the lead role as Mary  Panton. She's almost in every scene. Without her, the picture is a dud, but  she raises it up beyond an Oscar Acadamy nod. Her acting is aggressive and  carries the accolade of being in the vein of a new artistic style. Her  acting/reaction during a possible rape scene is worth the price of  admission, as is the scene in the small chapel with lemon trees. See it  just for her! I hope the American Academy does give her a nod, a big one!",967852800,17,1976,4.529745042492918

The location photography is fine, and cars, interiors, clothes, conversation, and drinking habits are all appropriate to the era, and well done.  It all must have cost a pretty packet.

In fact, personnel are distinguished before, and behind the camera.  David Brown produced, with credit given to Sydney Lumet as executive producer, and Arnon Milchan as associate producer, and all three of these men have made some very good movies.

Yet somehow, things didn't turn out very well here.  Scott Thomas and Fox have no chemistry, but they aren't supposed to.  However, Scott Thomas and Penn have no chemistry, and Penn acts as if his entire face has been Botoxed, leaving him unable to move a facial muscle.  He also, although he has been introduced as an American, speaks with an extremely strange midlantic accent.  Jeremy Davies is just not particularly convincing as Karl, and Scott Thomas has no chemistry with him, either. Anne Bancroft tends to overact as the English princess when, just off the top of my head, there is that trio of English Dames that could have played the part,  Helen Mirren, Judi Dench, or Maggie Smith.  Who cast this thing, anyway?  Beautiful scenery.  Acceptable history.  Yet, good people before and behind the camera somehow conspired to make this film, which feels as if it should have been released direct to video.",1302048000,2,3873,7.147991543340381

1110033,3,6306010971,"Although I am no fan of Sean Penn, I found UP AT THE VILLA an interesting and well executed story.  The protagonist is played by Kirsten Scott-Thomas, who demonstrates again that her strength lies in her ability to play a relatively honest and forthright woman who manages to get into one compromising situation after another involving fornication. Scott-Thomas' character in VILLA seems to have a penchant for becoming involved with the wrong sort of man, and in spite of her comment that she is not likely to engage in the same foolish acts she committed when she was younger, she does exactly that. Supposedly, she acts as she does in part because of her attraction to Penn's character, although as far as I am concerned there is no chemistry between them at all, so her statement rings hollow. This film is a thriller as opposed to a mystery. The only mystery is how can a woman who is so beautiful and smart do such stupid things? And yet, I cared what happened to her, so as she slipped down the slope, I hoped that somehow she would land on her feet. Whether she does or not is a matter of interpretation.

The setting of the story is a villa belonging to friends where Scott's impoverished character has stayed while she visited nearby Florence, Italy sometime just before the outbreak of hostilities in pre WWII Italy. The set with whom she mixes is composed largely of British ex-pats and a few Americans-comparable to the crowd in TEA WITH MUSSOLINI-although we discover little about any of them except the princess.  Anne Bancroft plays the ""princess-by-marriage"" who has a little dirt on everyone, and she isn't afraid to use it in a crises. This attribute comes in handy because the princess has paperwork in her possession revealing the doings of one of the local officials-paperwork he would just as soon not see land in the hands of the new masters in Rome- those brown-shirt rogues who like order and efficiency and relative honesty in their underlings.",1127001600,5,1971,4.740524781341108
1110034,3,6306010971,"UP AT THE VILLA illustrates the mischief one can get into when burdened with too much spare time.

Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas), a widowed Brit whose husband recently died after squandering their fortune, blast his eyes, is residing in 1939 Florence. Chamberlain has just sold the Czechs down the Vltava, Mussolini is getting uppity, and war appears likely. Panton lives UP AT THE VILLA, the owners of which, friends of Mary's, are away. Mary spends her idle time swanning about with fellow expats and contemplating the not entirely welcome offer of marriage recently tendered from the aging, but rich, Sir Edgar Swift (James Fox), who's expecting any moment to be named the new Governor of Bengal.

One evening, Panton attends a lavish dinner put on by her friend, the Princess San Fernando (Anne Bancroft), which comes off swimmingly except for a wretched example of entertainment for hire by a refugee Austrian musician, Karl Richter (Jeremy Davies). Later, Mary almost runs the man down with her car, and subsequently invites him back to the villa for a meal. Feeling sorry for the young fellow's miserable life, and wanting to show him a good time, she sleeps with him believing it'll be no more than a one time tryst. But, he returns the next night and forces himself upon her while professing his undying love. After Panton rejects his advances, Richter kills himself with a pistol given by Swift to Mary for her protection in these unsettled times. So now, what's a poor girl to do with an inconvenient corpse, especially as Sir Edgar is soon due back and anticipating her answer to his proposal?

UP AT THE VILLA isn't a bad film so much as just unengaging. Panton is so imprudent and so lacking any real purpose in life that it's hard to care what sort of predicament she gets herself into. The man who eventually bails her out, a rich and maritally unfaithful traveling Yank named Rowley Flint (Sean Penn), is equally undeserving of audience sympathy if for no other reason than the director didn't develop his character enough. Is he a cad or a knight in shining armor? The local cop investigating Richter's death, Beppino Leopardi (Massimo Ghini), could perhaps have achieved some viewer goodwill if it wasn't for his SS-like black uniform and his unswerving allegiance to Fascism. Richter starts out with a boyish appeal, but swiftly loses it. Except for the well-intentioned and honorable Swift, there's no one here to like, and stewing in their own juice probably serves them all right. For this fictional group of misfits, the war probably did a service by forcing them into something less frivolous - like survival.

If Panton calls me up offering a quick tumble, I might award more than three stars. I can be bought. Otherwise, UP AT THE VILLA has marginal merit.",1108684800,3,2788,4.850840336134453
1110035,3,6306010971,"If there was ever a need for evidence that one great actor/actress cannot carry a mediocre film, ""Up in the Villa"" satisfies that need. Kristen Scott Thomas is asked to carry nearly the entire load in this film and she does marvelously; however, the story itself is pedestrian and the essence of stereotyping and clich.
Set in Italy at the threshold of WW II, the film is the consummate exercise in pigeonholing. The Italian police are corrupt, brazen and supercilious; the European petty nobility are arrogant, easy to dislike and appropriately self-consumed; the lone American (Sean Penn) is hopelessly irresponsible, brash, superficial, cocksure and a borderline incompetent; and the innocent refugee (Davies, who is also great) is loveable, poor, misunderstood and eventually suicidal because of his adulation of a woman (Kristen Scott Thomas). The English gentleman is, of course, properly moral, quietly patrician and appropriately self-effacing when required.
Kristen Scott Thomas, Mary in ""Up in the Villa,"" plays the part of widow beset by many urges, ghosts, a spot of rebellion, not to mention some deep-seated personal insecurities. As only she can, KST pulls together all these facets with dialogue, delicate mannerisms and her copyright look - but in the end, even the writer must have been unsure that the story was carried, because, reiterating the boorish plot out-load falls to bare discourse between a now apologetic Mary (KST), and a suddenly (again) haughty Princess. Sean Penn plays the role of the American, but he comes off more as sort of amalgam of Fonzy and a mongrel pound-puppy. The stereotype of the American seems to be aimed at portraying the Euro version of a ""strong silent type,"" but he just comes across as an American looser - which, on second thought, may have been the director's intent all along.
You'd think after devoting a couple of hours to watching this, that the writer would reward the audience with an ending at least worthy of the actors, if not the plot. Regrettably even the ending is weak, so weak in fact that when Mary wanders off with the American, who can tell whether it's good, bad or if it even matters to them or anyone else. It amounts to sort of an ""on the train"" version of riding off into the sunset -- but just looks like the director finally admits to being bored with the whole affair.
If you're a Kristen Scott Thomas fan, see the film to watch a great actress at the top of her craft, otherwise your time may be better spent on other things.",1041292800,2,2510,4.866822429906542

Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas) must decide: does she play it safe and marry a stuffy Englishman (James Fox) for position and security, or does she follow her heart and take up with a charming but feckless married American playboy (Sean Penn)?  A few days of melodrama involving sex, suicide and the menace of Italian fascism help make up her mind.  The performances from Scott Thomas and Penn are solid, with Anne Bancroft, Derek Jacobi and Massimo Ghini delighting in minor roles, though Jeremy Davies is less convincing as an Austrian peasant.  It's probably worth seeing just for Maurizio Calvesi's cinematography and Paul Brown's production design - the lavish villa and the ripening tomatoes at the tennis club are a treat.

I pondered just why I found the film lacking, besides the rather unconvincing romance between the two stars.  I think that a big problem is that the story is so dated.  Sure, others have written of that era and much earlier times, in which the plight of women was dire.  Women, especially of Mary (Thomas' character)social rank were really in trouble if they didn't have a man to support them.  Mary, a widow, whose ex-husband drank away all their money is offered a proposal of marriage from a much older, but very eligible man...a diplomat who is on his way to a high position in India.  He is kind and obviously loves her but is dreadfully dull and terribly stuffy.  Perhaps casting a more attractive actor in this role would have made her decision to consider his proposal seriously more credible.  I found her protestations of love and affection for him to be really a stretch.

Then there is the rich, married American playboy -- enter Sean Penn, the polar opposite of the English diplomat.  The only thing they have in common is money.  Penn's character is married but cares little for that bond, has a reputation for womanizing and cares little for the conventions of the time. This sounds like something Penn could pull off with his hands tied behind his back but again, somehow, the charisma that he has projected in other films just isn't here.  Perhaps the faul is in the script--we really don't know if this is a good guy who deserves the affection of dear Mary or if he is just another player.  If that had been clarified we might care more about him and Mary's choice.  He makes it clear that his marriage is loveless and that they lead separate lives, but we don't know why he remains married.  He gives a few speeches about leading with your feelings and living for the moment, and promises her that he can't promise ""forever"" but that they ""will have fun.""  Oh, run, Mary, run!  Surely there is someone better for you than either of these two guys.

Again, I think the problem is that today's audiences know too much to fall for this dilemma.
Kristen Scott Thomas does a terrific job of making this woman and her actions credible. I was quite moved by her encounter with the Austrian refugee, an act which was purely motivated but which got her into a tub of trouble.  The Penn character does show virtue in helping her out of that jam...but again, Penn seems to score high on the notes of honor and anger but low on those of true love.  He has told her, after only chatting with her for five minutes, that she is the most beautiful woman in the world.  Oh, please....can't you do better than that?

I think that we, in this time period are more used to characters being fully rounded out which may be why this film is so unsatisfying.  These people are stereotypes:  the  beautiful,innocent victim woman, the bad but brave playboy, the stuffy diplomat, the friendly gay chum, the aging dowager (played grandly by Ann Bancroft) who has married for money herself and the poor Austrian refugee.  Again, due to the beuty of Florence, the wonderful performance of Kristen Scott Thomas, and an interesting period of time, this makes for a film worth seeing.",1340409600,2,3601,4.607535321821036
7899501,4,6306010971,"UP AT THE VILLA received a rather lukewarm acceptance at the box office when it appeared in 2000.  One of the advantages f DVD and of On Demand television viewing schedules is that we are offered a second, less than prejudiced look at a film that holds up rather well with age. W. Somerset Maugham's story is adapted for the screen by Belinda Haas and directed by Philip Hass and t proves to be a rather credible tale of the British and American outlooks on love and life all in the setting of pre-WW II Italy. There are flaws in the film, but it is the opportunity to see the radiant Kristin Scott Thomas deliver a role with such understated and quiet dignity (she now is playing in French films as well) that makes the re-visit worthwhile.

Mary (Scott Thomas) is a penniless well bred woman who has a brief assignation with an Austrian immigrant Karl Richter (Jeremy Davies) that ends in a tragic death.  At present Mary is living in a villa in Florence, Italy, the intended of the wealthy Sir Edgar Swift (James Fox) who despite being older than Mary and less ardent in his association with her (he is close to being assigned the Governor of Bengal), offers her a future of ease and means.  Mary is counseled by Princess San Ferdinando (Anne Bancroft) to proceed with the planned marriage, but Mary meets American playboy Rowley Flint (Sean Penn) and begins to challenge her own concepts of the forces of physical attraction and independence against those of promised luxury.  A bit of intrigue enters to muddy the waters, and all characters become involved in an Italian scandal that represents the tenor of the times: Mary has the good fortune to discover some documents that not only free her from accusations but brings down the Italian officials as well.  If this all sounds a bit confusing then it should be noted that the story (and film) are more about human actions under pressure of circumstances, about relationships, flights of fancy, slip-ups, weaknesses, trust and emotional maneuvering than a simple straightforward Italian/British/American tale.

The cast is varied - Bancroft gives one of her signature performances, Sean Penn seems out of his element - but the beauty and skill of Kristin Scott Thomas make the film worth savoring.  Grady Harp, September 11",1316736000,3,2279,4.795918367346939
