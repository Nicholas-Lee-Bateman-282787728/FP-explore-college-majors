8417713,5,B00474L5EA,"Mas Vidal  is an excellent yoga teacher.  This practice includes breathing technique which is essential to a good practice; you won't find this instruction on most DVDs or studios, for that matter.  I love the mat salutation and the tempo of the practice, is just right.  We need more yoga teachers like this.  When you do this practice you can feel the healing aspect of it.  Good for beginners through advanced.",1313712000,2,413,4.746478873239437
