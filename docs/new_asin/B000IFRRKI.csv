2655705,5,B000IFRRKI,"Quite entertaining. Erie, funny, and gross all at the same time! Some really good shorts in this one. There is a re-animator spoof that is rather unsettling.",1265846400,3,157,4.851851851851852
2655706,1,B000IFRRKI,"I run a website called Bloopwatch.org, and I received a review copy of this film. This was one of the worst movies that's ever been tied to Lovecraft, in my opinion, and I have seen some really bad pieces based on HPL's writing. The centerpiece is a softcore porn version of Re-Animator (yes, I know...another one.) The framing sequence is one of the most painful things I've ever forced myself to sit through. A couple of the segments were at least interesting to watch, but overall, I don't recommend wasting the money or the time. If you want to see good indie horror film-making in the Lovecraft vein, buy a copy of the H.P. Lovecraft Collection 1 and watch ""Cool Air"" or the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society's excellent ""Call of Cthulhu"". Trust me on this.",1232236800,10,762,4.651851851851852
2655707,4,B000IFRRKI,"This is cutting edge, avant-garde, underground, horror filmmaking.  Scream XI this is not.  Neither is this the next installment from Hollywood's digest of McHorror films.  These are original pieces of art--like raw sugar cane.  Like all things new and original there will be resistance to fully appreciate the films on this anthology.  However, this is a compliment.  Many of the short films in the anthology could easily be expanded into feature length films.  There is no doubt many of the films will generate controversy and criticism.  It's apparent the executive producers enjoyed successfully (unlike Cloverfield's gimmick) the act of unprocessed cinema.  It is true that a 100 million dollar fat-cat budget would smooth out the edges--but then again look at Kevin Costner's Waterworld.  One can even surmise that the producer's were satirizing the over-inflated, unnecessary budgets of Hollywood.  There are hilarious flying fake bats on strings and an obviously unplugged microphone that the host absurdly pretends to talk into throughout.  Alas, my only fear is that after the success of this anthology the producers may regress into another (lost soul) John Carpenter.",1201219200,4,1179,5.417582417582418
2655708,4,B000IFRRKI,"Presented as an anthology of stories loosely tied together through vignettes featuring an investigative reporter researching the life and writings of horror/fantasy author H. P. Lovecraft, LOVECRACKED! THE MOVIEis sometimes amusing, but often is too hard to follow or falls flat. There are some truly brilliant, wacky pieces throughout the movie, but not enough of them.

I'd tried to watch the movie twice before I finally got through it on the third attempt. Earlier, I figured the problem was me. I was distracted, too tired from work to concentrate, or really in the mood for something that was easy to get into. But I had the same problems the third time through. The movie is so disjointed in places that it's almost like channel-surfing captured on DVD, although the stories all have to do with some aspect of Lovecraft, his work, or his Cthulhu Mythos so as not to be completely disjointed.

The stories featured on the DVD only pay passing homage to Lovecraft's work. Key pieces and conceits were borrowed or cannibalized but the new stories didn't really push into the deep thinking that lay behind those tales. Even though the movie is about Lovecraft, we don't really get to know the author. There's just not enough factual material in the presentation for someone unfamiliar with Lovecraft's fiction to get the paradigm behind the pieces. There was no discussion as to why the writers, actors, and directors show the path they took to create their films.

The parts of the movie that really work are the ones that are over-the-top. I loved the investigative reporter shtick and would often laugh out loud at the actor's antics. He had some really good stuff, and he was great with his expressions and dialogue delivery. He has a good sense of timing.

But there were several stories within the movie that just never connected, not with the rest of the movie and not with the audience. I often found myself scratching my head and wondering what it was I had just seen. Or why I was supposed to care.

Case in point was a story about the guy whose ex-lover sent him a marriage announcement. He grew angry with her and obsessed over what she was doing with her fianc. So, somehow, he mutated into a Bugboy. He entered a cocoon and managed to metamorphose at the same time she happened to come by to check on him because she was worried about him. This section is shot in black and white, which is effective, but the prosthetic makeup is a complete joke. Plus you don't really care about any of the characters.

Many of Lovecraft's own stories were hard to understand, contained characters the reader could not identify with, and didn't have real endings. Maybe this was a pastiche representing those kinds of stories. Unfortunately, I can't confidently reach that decision based on my viewing.

A lot of people really liked Shaun of the Dead. I didn't. I felt that movie had some highlights that were worth watching, but that it missed the boat on delivering a solid film experience. So maybe it's just me. Maybe the audience that enjoyed that film will enjoy LovecraCked! The Movie. It's watchable but just so very uneven that I believe it will depend on the individual as to whether or not it's enjoyable. But it's worth looking at to find out for yourself.",1185753600,10,3269,4.734622144112478
2655709,2,B000IFRRKI,"I, personally, didn't get this movie.  Maybe it's just not my thing.",1430352000,,68,4.666666666666667
2655710,1,B000IFRRKI,I would give this negative stars were it possible to do so. Stupid and awful don't even begin to describe it. Don't waste your time.,1428192000,,132,4.32
2655711,5,B000IFRRKI,"At first when I began to watch this I thought, ok its a silly stupid B-ish Lovecraft movie like most of them are unfortunately BUT as it progressed I really started loving this. Its a perfect combination of Cracked magazine and Lovecraft at its best. Some of the segments were silly, some were stupid and some were genius. Capturing the insanity and sometimes chaotic reality of this world. Some of the segments I felt were truly symbolic  of the underbelly of our supposedly sane world. In a way I felt this movie was very subversive in that some of the segments were silly which sort of put one in a state of sleepy compliance as if to ease us into lowering our guard then some of the segments were insane chaotic intrusions into our minds with underlying frightening meaning. Like looking at a comfy scenic painting only to realize the painter painted a horrific murder way off in the distance. This I think is the meaning and method  of Lovecraft and the old ones. On the surface is calm and sanity but underneath is something far worse and horrific. This movie is a ""cracked"" smile with an insane foundation much like the lady in this movie  in the kitchen with her tea and cookies.",1421712000,3,1187,4.537383177570093
2655712,1,B000IFRRKI,Not worth the time I gave it.  I wound up fast forwarding the movie to get to the end of it.  Totally not worth it.,1415059200,,115,3.56

2655714,1,B000IFRRKI,"Hmmm - a parody of reality/slasher/horror.  Wincingly unfunny. It was free, but not worth the time. Puts you in mind of some of the other performance art around these day. Production values, script, theme all miss the mark.......could not find the funny.",1413417600,,254,5.0476190476190474

2655716,1,B000IFRRKI,"I've seen better home movies. Of course, I couldn't finish watching this one. The knowledge of Lovecraft is perfunctory.
My best guess is that it is supposed to be a farce about Lovecraft fans.",1410739200,,193,4.705882352941177
2655717,1,B000IFRRKI,"It's seem to be trying so hard to be ""wacky OMG random"" humor. It's a self-consciously bad movie and those are rarely fun. It's just so boring and the ""jokes"" keep hammering away as if by sheer repetition it will somehow become funny.

Nothing is worse than bad comedy. Bad horror can be funny, bad drama hilarious, but bad comedy will never be anything but bad. It just sits there like a stale fart and life's too short to sit around waiting for it to disperse.",1409788800,3,462,4.372093023255814
2655718,3,B000IFRRKI,"It's good that Lovecraft is dead because my god! He wasn't much for movies but yeesh this would have turned him away for good. It's campy, it's horrid, it's almost pornographic in some skits, but it does have enough for the Lovecraft fan to hold on to and know that he's watching satire. If ever anyone tried to create a Troma movie then Biff Juggernaught has achieved it. It's not always a good thing, but it is a ...thing.",1272067200,2,424,4.379746835443038
8145296,1,B000IFRRKI,"Lovecraft would have rolled over in his grave to hear that this monstrous (in a bad way) adaptation -- no, wait -- it's not even that -- of some of his works had been created.  I can NOT even go on about how awful this is.  Just DON'T watch it.  There is no point, no reason, nothing to redeem this piece of crap.  Just go away as fast as your computer will let you!!",1478217600,,367,3.918918918918919

8145298,1,B000IFRRKI,"Sorry, this was just bad, really bad. I am a big fan of indie stuff, but this was executed horribly. Should have never been distributed in any form and relegated to to the world of youtube and dailymotion, which actually has better Lovecraftian shorts available. Feel bad for the legacy of Lovecraft that idiots made a film truly not understanding his works and trying to make a cheap buck.",1456617600,,390,4.666666666666667
8145299,2,B000IFRRKI,"The moviemakers obviously enjoyed themselves.  It is a pity the audience doesn't share their delight.  The framing device (an ""investigative"" reporter researching an ""obscure"" science fiction writer) is silly without being funny.  Two or three of the framed short stories showed promise.  One wonders why Elias and company bothered with this project.  One wonders why I bothered watching it.",1454457600,2,391,5.559322033898305
8145300,2,B000IFRRKI,"I am unsure what this is supposed to be or supposed to represent. Performance art or some experimental kafka-esque theater of the absurd. Is it some parody?

There are but few Lovecraft movies. Maybe there are more than I have found. All of them can be watched in the course of a weekend. There are some terrible ones. Lovecraft stories lend themselves better to print than to motion pictures, pacing and cinematography do not work as well with the slow boiling of terror and insanity he describes.

For a struggling writer that began the genre of horror, more has been written about him than the stories Lovecraft had written.

I just don't understand LovecraCKed! The Movie, from the opening animation to the end credits.

8145301,2,B000IFRRKI,I used to be big into the scary stuff and Lovecraft was a groundbreaking writer that gave me nightmares.  The movie had a tongue-in-cheek narrator trying to weave these short stories together.,1447113600,,192,5.0
8145302,2,B000IFRRKI,"Not really a movie, and not really a comedy, but a collection of student ""horror"" shorts, which may or may not have anything to do with Lovecraft (I vote mostly not,) tied together with ""new, funny"" footage featuring a reporter/journalist attempting to find the truth about good, ol' H.P.

Your patience with the collection depends on whether you feel curious or charitable towards no-budget student efforts.
Not really good but some are interesting, including puppets, animation and an early version of ""Jenifer."" Also features a non-sequitur visit to Tromaville.

Shorts included:

The Outsider
The Thing On The Doorstep
BugBoy
Chaos Of Flesh
History Of The Lurkers
The Voice Inside

8145304,1,B000IFRRKI,"I should give this movie 0 stars, as I could not even sit through the whole thing, so don't he lured in by fancy titles and art work, its about as bad as it gets in the acting and set department, not even really funny if that was the intended perspective.
