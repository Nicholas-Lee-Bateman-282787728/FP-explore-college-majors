8052166,5,B0007US866,"This dvd was even better that I expected. Not normaly what I would have purchased, but for a special reason I came accross Rolling Thunder, and this dvd was ideal to learn more about the great man himself.",1347926400,,205,4.421052631578948
8052167,3,B0007US866,"I was a little disappointed in the content of this dvd as it was very vague and gave very little real insight into this man, his power, knowledge, his heritage and legacy as compared to the book ""Rolling Thunder"" (by Doug Boyd)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rolling-Thunder/dp/0440574358/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rolling Thunder</a>.  I found it generally very sad as they (the filmmakers and narrators) led a tour of the now-ruined Meta Tantay Foundation's buildings and terribly neglected lands. I nearly feel as if I wasted my money. Read the book instead!!  Maybe I will find Rolling Thunder's own book ""Rolling Thunder Speaks: A Message for Turtle Island"" (by Rolling Thunder and Carmen Sun Rising Pope)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rolling-Thunder-Speaks-A-Message-for-Turtle-Island-Rolling-Thunder-Speaks/dp/1574160265/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rolling Thunder Speaks: A Message for Turtle Island (Rolling Thunder Speaks)</a>&nbsp;more worthwhile than this dvd was.",1302393600,2,1060,7.338582677165355
8052168,5,B0007US866,"This is a good video that was shot in the latter portions of Rolling Thunders life.  The video quality is average but the significance is seeing Rolling Thunder and hearing his voice and seeing him as he was is priceless.  RT discusses using herbs for healing, he shows you his herb garden at his community (Meta Tantay) in Carlin Nevada.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in Rolling Thunder or using plants and herbs for healing.  A great movie!",1215648000,3,464,4.621951219512195
8052169,2,B0007US866,"I met Rolling Thunder in 1979 and what was immediately noteworthy about him was his incredible charisma.  His energy seemed to fill the arroyo where he was staying, and it felt rumbling, like rolling thunder.  I had hoped the video might capture some of his energy, depth and charm as a keep sake of my meeting with him.  Unfortunately, it didn't.",1212105600,6,347,4.655737704918033
