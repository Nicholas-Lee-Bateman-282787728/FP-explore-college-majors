Leann hunley as an actress get this movie for it is really good.  the packaging was in perfect shape and their was no damag to it at all",1370908800,,148,3.774193548387097
5572417,5,B00BC1UOQG,"I love Leann Hunley as an actress. She won me over instantly as Anna DiMera on Days of Our Lives. And now I will watch her in anything. She is convincing in every role she plays!

UPDATE: I finally watched this and Leann Hunley reminded me why I love her as an actress. She truly did make this movie, in my opinion. When an actress is well-known for a particular role, as we all know and love Leann as Anna Dimera, it is hard to not see the character she is known for when watching the actress in another role. As soon as the storyline developed in this movie, however, I completely forgot Leann as Anna DiMera, as this character was (in many ways) a marked departure from Anna DiMera. It truly gave us a chance to see sides of Leann's acting abilities that were amazing to watch, as we saw Leann reach deep insider herself and pull out so much angst.

Yes, there was so much angst in her character that we rarely got to see in Anna (so special when we do see it in Anna though because of its rarity). It was great to see Leann portray the angst with such emotion in both her voice tone and facial expressions. It was a dramatic departure from her portrayal of Anna, and it allowed me to (after awhile) forget Anna while watching Leann in this role, a HUGE task to achieve for an actress.",1368748800,3,1288,4.2317073170731705
5572418,5,B00BC1UOQG,I loved this movie.. I am trying to get others to buy it and watch it.. If you like drama movies then you will love Blissful Lies.. :-),1368403200,2,135,3.857142857142857
5572419,1,B00BC1UOQG,"Watching this movie made me ponder the question if anyone actually gets up in the morning and sets out to purposefully make a horrible movie.  I say that because Blissful Lies is honest-to-God the worst movie I have had the displeasure of ever seeing.  I recall seeing a very obese young lady wearing what appeared to be a thong in a Walmart store once.  It reminds me that just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should.  I believe the same applies to this film.  The cast and crew were given the chance to make it but if any of them had any shred of decency they would have left the set on the first day of filming.

The plot of the film purports to be based on the book of the same name.  Characters are not developed, plot points are not explored, the cinematography is inane, and the acting is downright atrocious.  I've seen better performances by little old ladies in community theater productions of Steel Magnolias.  Seriously.  This film should not be viewed by anyone seeking anything remotely related to entertainment or pleasure.  It's more appropriate for those dark, dank interrogation rooms at Guantanamo Bay.  I doubt anyone could resist the urge to comply with pretty much anything just to be relieved of the punishment of watching Blissful Lies.

I've been harsh and a little dramatic in my description so far, but in all seriousness.  This movie is horribly acted from a horrible script and led by an even more horrible director.  Jennifer Brown-Thomas should be ashamed to have her name associated with this project.  Leann Hunley must have either been desperate or smoking crack when she agreed to attach her Emmy-winning name to it.  I will be surprised if anyone in this cast or crew is seriously considered for other legitimate work in the future.  Oh well, there's always porn.",1366070400,5,1819,4.720634920634921
5572420,5,B00BC1UOQG,"The Book was amazing, and the author is wonderful. I own both a signed copy, and a copy on my NOOK. Now I can't wait to own the DVD, and be able to watch it OVER and OVER. Looking forward to the next book & movie.",1361923200,2,213,3.652173913043478

5572424,4,B00BC1UOQG,"Firstly, shout out to Amazon Prime for being able to see this for free! This is the best, lamest, movie I've ever seen. It starts with some super rich kids trying to go on a college trip and speeds into one of the kids loving the MILF in the movie. Fast forward to the thrown fist, stolen kisses, bootie pumping, and a couple dinners to two kids sleeping with parents, another first is thrown and they all go to their college trip... right before the girl kills the father lover of course. After a night of fun on the beach, we wake up to a wonderful game of Clue! White envelopes left by someone are on every pillow and secrets shall be revealed! What do we learn:

1. Young people kill.
2. Young people get over murders quite easily.
3. Murder should be forgiven - but who needs that when it can be hidden!

The acting goes in waves of being decent. The constant twists and turns made this a great lazy day watch. Have no expectations and get ready to laugh, yell, and moan.",1443225600,3,976,4.27027027027027

8565676,3,B00BC1UOQG,"If you're going to watch this movie, I think its vital you know just how long it is, especially if you fancy ones that end at 80 or 90 minutes.

Secondly, the description the seemingly unbreakable bond of five women isn't entirely accurate. Think a woman, her college-aged son, his male best friend, his two (or three - its a bit unclear) female best friends, and the sons female college sweetheart. There are several side characters, like the womans husband/sons father, but they're not the ones whose unbreakable bonds are in question.

Its not a bad movie: the womans storyline drives the plot despite it presumably being about a group of college seniors. It has sexy moments, little violence, and no graphic/gory violence. If you like scandal and deep, dark secrets, youll love the last twenty minutes.

Would I watch it again? I wouldnt seek it out, but Id give it another go.",1517011200,,881,4.745098039215686

8565680,4,B00BC1UOQG,It was really funny. It should be marketed as a soap opera parody. I think it could be one of the classically bad funny movies.,1447027200,,127,4.12
