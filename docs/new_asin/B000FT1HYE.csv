8126255,5,B000FT1HYE,"This is a documentary on the making of the tapestries for the new Cathedral in L.A.  It interviews the artist and shows his process as he paints, then follows the production of the tapestries in the ancient city of Bruges, Belgium, using modern technology.  It is simply marvelous, especially if you have a spiritual nature.",1373328000,,324,4.872727272727273
8126256,3,B000FT1HYE,The book is very good but does not show the tapestries in any complete way nor does it identify the many people who are depicted. It does go into great detail on how the tapestries were made and that is interesting but otherwise....,1369440000,,232,4.4186046511627906
8126257,4,B000FT1HYE,"New Cathedrals are not born everyday. But, they are built to last and when it comes to choosing the art that goes in them, well, I keep thinking of Michelangelo. This is a well-made documentary on artist John Nava and the inspiration behind his tapesteries that reside in the Cathedral of Our Lady of Angels in Los Angeles.  It takes us to Nova's studio in Ojai where we see his original sketches, then travel to the factory in Europe where the images are transferred into woven fabric and shipped back to LA. I especially enjoyed the candid interviews with the every day people(restaurant owner, teacher, etc) who posed for Nava's saints. If you have the chance, visit the Cathedral and take a close look at the fine work. you'll appreciate it more after you watch this doc - simply Divine!",1152662400,9,791,4.65
