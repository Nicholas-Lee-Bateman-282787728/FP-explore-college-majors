7980266,5,B00008978D,For my husband's birthday I gave him this movie with other movies of this genre.  He enjoyed it especially because of the actor Jesse Borrego.  He highly recommends this movie.,1379635200,,176,4.833333333333333
7980267,3,B00008978D,"Why I rented this DVD.  I remember Jesse Borrego from the television series ""FAME"" and I have not seen him act in a long time.  And then I like Jacob Vargas (Selena, My Family/Mi Familia [1995], Next Friday [2000] and the WB tv series ""Greetings From Tucson"").  Jacob Vargas is one of my favorite Latino actors.  Vargas plays ""Miguel"".  Jesse is a dishwasher and Miguel is a cook.  They work together in the same restaurant.  Miguel has never been outside of San Antonio, except for going to SeaWorld.  So Jesse takes him for a ride on an adventure.  They look for some buried treasure, but on ""Come And Take It Day"", the hunt for buried treasure turns into tragedy.  A small film, but easy to watch.",1051920000,,700,4.484126984126984
