7959295,5,B000063JZL,"Absolutely lovely to add this to my Rozz collection.
The DVD has a secret feature that not many people know about:
At the main menu, go down to ""Biographies"". Instead of selecting it, go right, and although it seems like there's nothing there, the swastika on the right hand side of the screen will light up. Once you select it, you can watch a 40-second tour of Rozz's apartment (shot by Rozz himself in 1997) that shows his artwork.",1481673600,,434,4.506329113924051
7959296,4,B000063JZL,"So I've just finished watching this film a second time and this time I went back and watched the commentary and explored the special features, I'm VERY glad I did.

PIG is a 23 minute black and white art film, shot in 16mm and finished in 1998. It was created by Rozz Williams and Nico B.

The film features Rozz Williams (of goth/punk fame) acting as a murderer towards a seemingly willing victim (James Holland). The two travel into the desert until they reach an abandoned house where an artistically-shot ritualistic murder takes place. I won't go into detail on the murder and ritualistic aspects of the murder because obviously that would spoil the film (as their symbolism is more what the film is about, rather than just being a horror film about a murder)

So many of you are probably wondering if such a short film is worth the cash. If you're a fan of Rozz Williams' work then get it. It's probably where the majority of the appreciation for this film comes from because as an art film it's probably a bit disturbing and as a gore film it's too artsy and maybe a bit too tame. There's gore and disturbing scenes, and when they hit they hit HARD but they're spaced out and aren't exactly viewed for their carnage as much as they're used as symbolism.

It's a weird mix of art and gore that will probably alienate a lot of fans of either genre. Again, it's mostly going to be fans of Rozz that are going to ""get"" or ""enjoy"" this film.

It includes a really nice booklet that acts as a replica of the book used in the film. Definitely a cool piece to flip through and I'm sure fans will enjoy trying to understand the meaning of the images inside it.

The commentary by Nico B is WORTH THE WATCH. I typically don't go into the special features for films but because this one was so short I gave it a shot. Amazing information in it that truly makes watching this film much more horrifying, much more real. I won't spoil anything but I will say that watching the film with commentary was scarier than without the commentary.

I'm not sure what it is about this film that prevents me from giving it 5 stars. Something about Rozz's work usually loses me, there's always something I don't ""get"" and I think I missed it in this piece. It's a short sensory captivator that will keep you interested the whole ride through but don't be surprised  if you don't totally get it.",1446768000,,2375,4.418764302059497
7959297,2,B000063JZL,"I'll start by admitting that I was not familiar with Rozz Williams, his music or any of his endeavors outside of this film prior to watching ""PIG,"" so this review is more of a cinematic critique.  Furthermore, since others have adequately summarized the plot of the film (essentially a poetic exploration of the relationship between a killer and his victim--there are also further details on Wikipedia), I will focus on technical aspects.

Although all of the DVD features total 40+ minutes, the film itself runs 23 minutes.  It was shot on b&w film (a combination of super-8 and 16mm, I believe) with no dialogue but features a soundtrack by lead actor, Rozz Williams.  Cinematography, a mixture of hand-held and tripod shots, is amateurish--composition is simplistic, exposure shot to shot is uneven, and neither zooms nor pans are smooth.  Along with significant film grain, dirt and scratches are evident on the transfer.  There are numerous ""jump cuts"" in the editing and screen continuity doesn't seem a priority --one scene features a shot of the killer leading the victim towards an abandoned house, the victim walking freely, in the next shot the killer is pulling/leading the victim now with bound hands and some sort of leash.  S&M ""gore"" torture effects are actually minimal, marginally effective and again, amateurish.

I'm sure an argument could be made that some or all of the above mentioned details were intentional and that the viewers attention should be primarily focused on the imagery and its symbolism (not sure if more knowledge of Williams history would help here) but I'll admit it was a little difficult to fully submit to the artistic vision when hindered by these flaws that burden the film with a ""film school"" quality.  Rozz Williams lore aside, this film is not a cinematic treat and doesn't break any new ground (seriously--keep in mind this was made in 1998).  Richard Kern and Nick Zedd were entertaining and shocking, utilizing a similar aesthetic to better effect, nearly 20 years earlier with their ""Cinema Of Transgression.""  And if you are seeking, specifically, heavily symbolic, lo-fi, b&w horror (and you have this kind of money to throw around), I would recommend Merhige's ""Begotten""--expertly crafted with mind-numbing, high-contrast b&w cinematography (in the first few minutes there are even some shots that are startlingly similar to a couple in ""PIG,"" close-up of an eye in gauze, empty abandoned house--""Begotten"" pre-dates ""PIG"" by 9 years!) AND a feature length running time.

Included in the extra features, are some audio interviews with Rozz Williams (apparently his last?)  that give a bit more conceptual insight into the film and his mindset at the time (specifically involving the films imagery and getting inside ""killer"" thought processes) which are fascinating, albeit brief, and prevent me from rating this DVD lower than 2 stars.  The photo gallery contains a few behind-the-scenes shots of the bare bones production crew as well as the DVD artwork photos.  There is also a decent memorial video that ""PIG"" director Nico B made for Rozz Williams' services.

Be aware that this film features, along with the general S&M type torture mentioned above, some full frontal male nudity including close up shots of male genital torture.

As far as the different pressings or ""editions,"" it seems that there was an initial run of 1334 DVDs as well as a secondary run that brought the total number of DVDs to 2000 (cleverly making the second run a press of 666).  Apparently, any copies that are hand numbered are not legit, all copies from Cult Epics were print numbered.  There are a significant number of the DVDs that are signed by director Nico B (Cult Epics website says 250 of the initial run, no mention of signed copies from second).  Copies of ""PIG"" on eBay from ""cultdiscount"" are actually direct from Cult Epics (which is Nico B's DVD distribution company)--seems that the director schemed that he could sign and hoard the last run and get more than the $29.95 list price...

In summary, a bit of a heavy price to pay if you are not a hardcore Rozz Williams fan/follower.  I think both independent cinema and horror fiends will be equally disappointed.  A better place to begin exploring these lo-fi, DIY type cinematic explorations can be found here:

7959298,3,B000063JZL,"IT is intresting how amazon keeps the minutes off The listing I would not pay this amount of money for 23 minutes. Trust me cult epics will re-issue this movie...Have not seen, wanted to buy but my luck it went out of print. Ridiculus Pricing for that amount of time on a Movie.",1179273600,4,278,4.264150943396227
7959299,3,B000063JZL,"Being a fan of early Christian Death & The Shadow Project, I had to see the film for myself. Before I say anything about the visual part of the film I must say that the soundtrack is a great piece of ambient noise (5 Stars). The DVD extras contains a Rozz Williams memorial video set to one of his songs, which was a nice touch. There is also a small insert booklet of collage artwork by Rozz Williams and there are more images of his work in the DVD extras (5 Stars). So why 3 stars you ask, well the ""movie"" itself it seemed juvenile and if it didn't have the soundtrack to keep it moving along it wouldn't have gone anywhere. With that said, all fans of Rozz Williams should view and interpret the work for themselves.",1119571200,3,721,4.231884057971015
7959300,5,B000063JZL,"Gorgeous. It's a strange film: artsy, morbid, one of those things that typify what most imagine when they think of dark, college, indy art, but still impossible to pin down, and not what you would have thought it was. It is original, fluid but jarring, disturbing, and not for a second clich. There is no questionablity as to its validity as a work of art by two men who had a vision and carried it out perfectly.

The only negative thing I would say about this film isn't about the film. It's about the fans' regard for Nico B, who gets little credit for the film from Rozz's following, but who was a huge part of the film, and I don't think that PIG would be half of what it is without him.

Wait for a seller to offer a decent price or find it on eBay and WATCH IT! No Rozz fan will be dissappointed. Following Rozz's stated purpose of early Shadow Project and Premature Ejaculation concerts - This film will make you feel sick and ashamed, even if you still haven't figured out why.",1119484800,4,986,4.295698924731183
7959301,3,B000063JZL,"There are a finite amount of images that shock, awe, and surprise the audience. Some of them are in this movie. In this sense, I think the movie was an unequivical success. It sent image after image straight into my admittedly jaded and desensitized senses.

The plot, or should I say sequence of images was rather straight forward. One man tortures another. Actually, torture might not be the correct word. In fact the other man does not let us know that was is happening to him is remotely painful, he does not fight back, and gladly steps into the other man's Jaguar. Part of the movie is in Russian, which I could for the most part understand.

However, the message I could not quite understand. Maybe I was not supposed to? Maybe, Rozz Williams was pulling a fast one on the audience and just linked a string of shocking images in black and white frames? Or maybe there was a meaning, but it was hidden beneath shaky camera movements and a few layers of celluloid? I don't know.

It was however different. The Nazi book was very well done and looked like a refined collage that a bi-polar high schooler would make. The scenes were sometimes hard to watch (I always had a problem with genital mutilation). But, as hard as it was to watch, this movie had no problem keeping your eyes glued to the screen. Where so many silent movies fail, this one succeeded. As I was nodding off while watching begotten, my eyes attempted to discern the happenings in the darkness of Pig.

For an art film, this was not too bad. Maybe, there is a meaning, and maybe I will find it another day after thoroughly rereading some Jacques Derrida books.",1115942400,,1634,4.5288135593220336
7959302,4,B000063JZL,"Well, Another reviewer covered the details of the film so I'll skip most of that..

This is definitely an odd little film. It's one that makes you think instead of telling you everything thats happening (really it doesnt tell you anything considering there are no spoken words). Its worth seeing at least once though I wouldnt say its the best of its kind.

Really what made the package worth having are 2 things, the ""Why God Permits Evil"" booklet of Rozz's artwork and the Memorial video to Rozz with the soundtrack of his song ""Flowers"" which I found very touching and thoughtful in paying respect to him and all his works.

With only 1334 copies made available it was a nice collectors touch while at the same time it does prevent alot of people from seeing one of Rozz's final projects (take a look at the used selling prices, lowest price at the time I'm writing this is $147.99, OUCH! - *glad I got my copy early!!*)

-extra note, I'm not sure if all copies are like this but mine came signed by Nico B.",1107648000,9,1010,4.443243243243243
