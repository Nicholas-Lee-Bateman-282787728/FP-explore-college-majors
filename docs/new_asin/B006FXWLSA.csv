8497233,4,B006FXWLSA,"Fans of actor Edgar Ramirez (Carlos the Jackal mini-series, The Bourne Ultimatum, Domino) will be in a treat as he once again shows that not only is he a capable supporting actor but an intense, visceral leading man as well. This is a thinking man's thriller with plenty of taut moments and dramatic tension to fit the bill. The plot follows an ex-guerilla soldier who has been allowed back into society and encounters a relative of one of his past enemies who wants him to pay for his crimes. Plenty of questionable morals, unexpected twists and ransoms follow. This often shows on HBO/Cinemax late at night and I couldn't recommend it any higher than I already have. :)",1382918400,,671,4.694915254237288
