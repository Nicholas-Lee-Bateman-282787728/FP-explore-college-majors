I too am a poet/songwriter and he has helped me improve upon these  talents.  This video is a wonderful example of his creative abilities.  I  was fortunate enough to see him on the Live - Greetings From The West tour  and this video is one of the best example of LIVE recordings I have ever  seen.  Whether you are already a fan or you are trying his music for the  first time - YOU ARE IN FOR MUSICAL EXALTATION!

1391101,5,B000053VAB,"I have owned this video now since it was introduced way back in 1991.  Dan Fogelberg is a poet, a teacher, a linguist, a thrilling tribute to every emotion felt by people who love, or dare to love.  You can never tire of  watching him in motion at his concerts and in interviews.  I imagine one  day the world will turn and glance his way again and appreciate every song  he has ever written as we get further in touch with ""Mother  Earth"" and our own hearts and souls.",933379200,8,469,4.202247191011236

1391175,3,B000053VAB,"Love the music of Dan Fogelberg and this concert but the dvd seemed to be less than perfect considering it was listed as new. It seemed to 'miss' for a moment in places, which I attributed to the fact that it was a concert from a long time ago. I assumed for this reason that this particular concert DVD purchased from another source  might have had the same issue, so I just accepted the fact, although it was annoying.",1440892800,,420,4.3164556962025316

1391206,5,B000053VAB,"This is a very nice DVD of a gig Dan did at the Fox Theater in Saint Louis. I may be mistaken, but it is one of the very few DVDs where we see Dan and his crackerjack band play well and it's all live. I do not know if any other videos or dvds exist of live Fogelberg other than this one. Very nicely put together and is captioned as well. Worth the money from a guy who died way to soon for my liking. Still missed, still loved, still rocking out. Great DVD.",1410134400,,458,3.831578947368421
1391207,4,B000053VAB,"Oh man, could Dan Fogelberg WRITE songs!
This collection is wonderful.
Sometimes, on a  few songs, his voice seems rather muted, (kind of hard to hear clearly), but otherwise, it's a great set of songs &  some very, very fine songwriting.
He is missed to this day; he'll be missed forever.",1408320000,,289,4.647058823529412
1391208,5,B000053VAB,I love Dan Fogelberg and was never able to see him enough in concert while he was still alive. I love this DVD and can watch it over and over again. But then I am a Danfan. Everon,1402876800,,179,3.736842105263158

1391220,5,B000053VAB,If you love Dan Fogelberg as I have it is really a good concert dvd. My only complaint it is not as clear as it would be in Blu Ray but still I loved his music from the day I found out about him.,1393200000,,195,3.4545454545454546
1391221,5,B000053VAB,"The DVD was used and for some reason the sound was low volume. But getting on DVD was great - I had a video of it but gave up my VCR.  I believe Dan Fogelberg is the BEST - better than his contemperaries, classical, or ANYBODY!",1391558400,,227,3.9347826086956523
1391222,5,B000053VAB,"I just bought this again. I got the first one before Dan's passing. My wife and I drove 21 hours, from Canyon City Colorado, on our honeymoon in June 1977 to see Dan and Fool's Gold at the Music Hall in Houston. Since then we saw him six times, including his last concert in Houston, before his illness. This DVD may not be a Bluray, or an audio lover's dream, but it is the only full concert that we have to remember what a tremendous talent he was. If you are just discovering this, then you may not be aware of the posthumous release of his final album, Love In Time, which is also a must have. Dan played all the instruments, and left instructions with with his wife to release the album after he was gone. Let me just say how much Dan's music has meant to me, and my beautiful wife, of almost 37 years. So many memories of our favorite artist. You should not be afraid to spend 10 dollars to have a look back on what we can never see live again. I loaned my original copy to a friend, to whom I told to keep it. That person, and his wife saw him with us 3 times, and they love it as well.",1389657600,2,1093,4.018348623853211
1391223,5,B000053VAB,"I miss Dan Fogelberg and his music. Fortunately, this concert was recorded for posterity and shows the many sides of Dan's lifestyle and beliefs. One great concert!",1389398400,2,164,5.111111111111111
1391224,4,B000053VAB,"The biggest complaint is that Sony didn't clean up the sound. It's not bad quality, but it could be better. That said, how many complaints are made when CD's are re-mastered and the sound is too clean. My wife saw Dan in concert on his Innocent Age album but I never got the chance. I was a Dan fan in the 70's and wasn't really a big fan when he hit the charts. I think it was more my own perception that if you're getting airplay, you've sold out. I was an idiot. I got this for my wife as a Christmas present and really enjoyed watching Dan perform. If you love music from the heart, you'll love this.",1387411200,,604,4.084033613445378
1391225,5,B000053VAB,"Awesome DVD by a great writer/singer, well produced and presented, crystal clear video and audio, highly recommend you buy this if you like Fogelberg music",1386460800,2,155,5.24
1391226,5,B000053VAB,"Dan is every bit as good live, maybe better, than in the recording studio.  His talent really holds up.  And he gives 100% all the time.  Not sure there is a better singer - songwriter - musician - arranger - producer out there.  It is so sad that he was taken away at the age of 56. I'm sure he probably had a lot more to give!  This concert from 1991 - two decades removed from The Innocent Age release, and now two decades ago still holds up.  I saw him live 3 times - perfect each time.",1385078400,3,490,3.9489795918367347
1391227,5,B000053VAB,"I saw Dan many years ago and will never forget the concert. What many do not realize about him is that not only was he a great musician for the ""soft rock"" stuff, but he was a prolific lyric writer, song writer, arranger, producer, and artist. He passed away in 2005 I believe. He gave a great deal to the music world. This particular set shows off talents that he was not normally known for. His raw blues and slide guitar work on Road Beneath My Wheels is amazing.",1382486400,3,466,4.247191011235955
1391228,5,B000053VAB,I get misty eyed when I think that Dan is no longer writing great songs and playing live acoustic shows. He was such an incredible performer. Just being able to play this old concert brought back good memories.,1379376000,2,210,4.552631578947368
1391229,5,B000053VAB,"I have always been a fan of Dan Fogelberg and was delighted to find that there was a live performance on DVD.  I had seen him perform in Delray Beach, Florida and love his music!  This DVD is excellent.  It was as though he were still here passing on his music to all of us if only for a short time.  If you like Dan and his music you should have this!",1374796800,2,352,3.8472222222222223

1391251,5,B000053VAB,"As a big Fogelberg fan since the 1970's, I'm just glad this DVD exists. I particularly liked the interview parts of the DVD. Also, I was impressed by his blues rendition of ""Wheels to the Road""song. It exhibited not only his amazing guitar work, but also his vocal versatility.
I wish there were more DVD's of his performances available.
Any real Fogelberg fan who doesn't have this one is missing out on a gem.",1373932800,3,411,4.5675675675675675
1391252,5,B000053VAB,"This is an awesome concert where Dan sings some of his favorite songs.......live! His voice is lower but his band's harmonizing and reaching some high notes for him, makes every song as special as if Dan sang and played every instrument. Incredible!

I was supposed to go to this concert but it was my first night of Graduate School,,,,,my friends went, I did not. Thanks to this DVD I can experience thIs fantastic evening!",1367280000,2,424,4.72972972972973
1391253,5,B000053VAB,If you love Dan then you have to get this DVD. I saw him in concert 11 times and he delivered songs that were beautifully written and masterfully sung. Dan was a true poet and will always be my favorite singer/songwriter.,1365984000,2,221,4.414634146341464
1391254,3,B000053VAB,"I am glad I bought this but the sound is disappointing for DVD. Not remastered. Sony should redo this. If you like Dan and these songs, you can overlook this. Late great Dan Fogelberg at his best. His band on the disc is really great.
The drummer Mike Botts on here used to be a member and drummer for Bread. Sadly, he has passed away too.
I got this before it became unavailable from Sony. The sound quality is great. The VHS might be better.",1363305600,,443,4.223529411764706
1391255,3,B000053VAB,I had this on VHS and wanted to get it on DVD thinking it would be so much better.  I think I prefer the VHS.  Still love Dan though!!! Just wish he were around to do another one!,1362700800,,179,3.6842105263157894
1391256,5,B000053VAB,"This is one of the truly great concert performances.  Run For the Roses and Leader of the Band are standouts.  It is perhaps the only DVD I have ever got and then played, over and over again.  It was everything I hoped it would be, and so much more.  A must for any lover of great music.",1361664000,2,287,3.982456140350877

deceased. I treasure the memory of his artistry , and this video locks it in.",1357257600,,287,4.433962264150943
1391259,4,B000053VAB,"I received this DVD from my sister for Christmas, 2007, just a few days after Dan's passing.  It was exactly what I would have asked for and I burst into tears when I watched it.  I have been a fan of Dan Fogelberg since the mid-70s when I was fortunate enough to see him live on stage in Cincinnati, Ohio, in a small theater.  I fell in love with his music and his spirit that night but didn't have another opportunity to see him again.  I have most of his recordings and to have this DVD as well is special to me.  Other than to say that I wish the DVD lasted longer and covered more of his music, I have no criticism of it.  Perhaps his widow will produce a DVD for his fans to enjoy.  If you love Dan Fogelberg and his music, you'll love this DVD simply because it's about him.",1349395200,,781,4.032467532467533
1391280,4,B000053VAB,"I got this wonderful DVD for Christmas 2011.  Finally got around to obtaining this performance by Dan Fogelberg more than 20 years after it was first recorded in St. Louis in June 1991 following the release of his ""Wild Places"" album.

Dan is backed up by five other musicians on stage, and the show opens up majestically with ""Aurora Nova"", and the title track from ""The Wild Places"" project. There's a surprise guest appearance by friend Tim Weisberg with whom he teamed up on two albums, namely ""Twin Sons of Different Mothers"" in 1978, and ""No Resemblance Whatsoever"" in 1995. While Tim was on stage with his flute, the group performed masterfully ""Twin's Theme"", ""Intimidation"", and ""The Power of Gold"" from the ""Twin Sons"" album. Perhaps my favorite segment of this concert was when Dan was on stage alone; just he and his acoustic guitar, and performing unplugged and very personal versions of ""Believe In Me"", ""Run For The Roses"", and the deeply personal ""Leader of the Band"", which nearly brought me to tears!  Most of Dan's other well known hits are performed wonderfully in this set, along with Dan's off-stage talking segments between songs which added a different, yet personal touch to the overall effect of this concert video.

Disappointing aspects here include Dan & Company not performing his highest charting pop hit ""Longer"" (from his album ""Phoenix"") which peaked at #2 in 1979, and ""Hard To Say"" (from his ""Innocent Age"" album""), which also crossed Top 10 territory in 1981.  ""The Language of Love"", Dan's last Top 40 entry, also was left of the performance list.  I guess it hardly mattered, as the audience it seemed was giving the group a standing ovation after every song performed on stage.  Still, in my opinion, not performing ""Longer"" was a huge oversight!

I deeply regret that prior to Dan's tragic and untimely death in December 2007 at the rather young age of 56 I never was able to see him perform live in concert.  This wonder musical testament to Dan's incredible talents will have to wonderfully suffice.  Highly recommended!",1327795200,,2063,4.885386819484241
1391281,5,B000053VAB,"Dan Fogelberg's final and finest years captured in a the way only he can be.  This richly documented presentation sheds light on many of Dan's popular hits, highlighting some little known facts about the songs.",1304208000,,210,5.0
1391282,4,B000053VAB,"Since the late release of this DVD long after Dans death, I have listened to it many times and grown to love this DVD even thou its a poor copy of VHS to DVD, there are many of Dan's great songs on here and many good sit down and talk sessions with Dan. You come away from this 110 min DVD feeling like you have a personal experience with Dan and thats what counts, the pops and clicks and noises at that point really are not as important anymore.
This is not a straight thru concert video, there is plenty of Dan Fogelberg talking and joking and behind the scenes shots. So if you are looking for strictly a concert tape, you might get let down. For me, its a good choice, I feel like I know the real Dan better.",1290038400,,713,4.0638297872340425
1391283,3,B000053VAB,"As a huge fan of Dan and his songs, i was somewhat disappointed in this concert.  I thought the song selection could have been better.  Perhaps less emphasis on social commentary would have altered the playlist.  ""Each has his own voice,"" but i am not as interested in a performers political / social views as much as in their craft.  I can enjoy your music without agreeing, or listening to, your perspectives on life, especially when these perspectives decide how you will perform.  That being said, i will always miss Dan and wouldn't return the concert media if i could.",1277337600,2,574,4.7
1391284,4,B000053VAB,"I never went to see Dan Fogelberg perform in concert. I love his music but I just didn't think it was something that would make for a good concert experience. BOY WAS I WRONG and now really regret never going to see him perform live after watching this DVD. Sure the sound and and video quality could be better but the concert itself is incredible. It shows how talented Dan was and it was great to see him and Tim Weisburg jam together on Power of Gold.

Audio: LPCM stereo.

Overall, this performance is stunning, and a must have for any Dan Fogelberg fan. His voice sounds higher and different than most of the renowned studio songs, and that may surprise some, but there's no complaint about its quality. The songs are so fine, that one can help but wonder why Dan has been so overlooked and underrated as an artist and songwriter. It's a pity that this is the only way that we can hear Dan Fogelberg on DVD, because they didn't put a lot of work on the sound. As somebody said it, this looks like a simple transfer from the VHS, a poor one in sound, and just acceptable in picture. Luckyly, most of the songs have an average sound, but the interview snippets and some of the songs have a very noticeable distortion. But it's hard not to enjoy the concert even having to go through the abscense of quality in the video. Come on, SONY MUSIC, is this the best that you can do?.",1270080000,2,951,4.337078651685394
1391286,5,B000053VAB,"Ssince I will never get the chance to see him ""live"",  this is the next best thing.  All things considered, I love it.

1391287,5,B000053VAB,"Yes, both the sound and picture quality could be and should be better, but if you are a fan this is the only concert footage of Dan Fogelberg currently in release. The concert itself is first-rate, the only complaint is that it looks like a direct VHS to DVD transfer. Fogelberg deserves a better legacy, and I hope that in the future it will be remastered and a fitting tribute presented.

An accomplished musician, Fogelberg switches between keyboards, acoustic guitar, electric guitar and bottle-neck slide guitar. I so regret never seeing him perform in person, but at least this DVD preserves a live  performance so I can see what I missed. It is bittersweet to watch the DVD but it is also a meaningful reminder of a man we thought we knew because his music mirrored our experiences. He will be missed.",1256428800,,808,4.683098591549296
1391288,4,B000053VAB,"To be honest: I haven't seen this DVD yet as it took six months to cross the Atlantic. I have watched the VHS many times though. As I understand, there is no other footage of a Fogelberg concert, which gives this DVD great historical value. Also, he is the only favourite artist I have never seen live. Dan wasn't keen on travelling, and the only time I got close to seeing him was back in 1977 when he was supposed to accompany The Eagles. Alas, he didn't turn up. So, I (and a great many other fans around the world) will have to do with this DVD. Well, it could be worse - there could be nothing at all. That would be really sad. So if you're a fan, get this by all means. I'm sure Dan has done better, more intimate, more intense shows - but this is well worth having as a tangible memory of a beloved and sadly missed old friend.",1246147200,,834,4.091463414634147
1391289,4,B000053VAB,"I saw Dan Fogelberg in Concert once at the Mann Music Center in Philadelphia. It was an accoustic outdoor concert and he was phenominal!
This DVD, even though the sound quality isn't so great, lets me see some
of his music that I never saw performed, and also brought back memories
of the concert that I saw. Thanks for the memories Dan, this DVD brought
tears to my eyes. May he Rest In Peace",1240099200,,393,4.324324324324325

His spirit and talent live on with me forever!!!
God Bless his family. I miss him and never met him. I'm sure his family is hearbroken.",1237852800,2,344,4.3076923076923075

 brought some great memories...Money well spent.. Thanx'''",1233878400,,131,5.238095238095238
1391303,5,B000053VAB,This is a great way to remember him and his amazing talent. He's one of my favorite singer/songwriter/musicians. He will be missed.,1232496000,,131,5.0
1391304,5,B000053VAB,I have recently upgaded my stereo to a Denon 7.1 surround and thia has caused me to become so enamored with concert DVDs. I have long been a fan of Dan Fogelberg and this DVD has shown me just what a treasure he was. The only thing that disappoints me is that I wish the concert had been longer. Of course with all the great songs he has written it could last for quite some time. That being said for a 1991 concert the sound was pretty good. The picture was not the sharpest but if this is what I have as a memorial I'll take it. If you are looking for something on Dan there is a lot here to like. It is also a treat for Tim Weisberg to play on this as well. I thought the commentary before songs would be a problem but it really is not. The lyrics that run with the song are a little distracting but at the same time are a nice touch. All in all this was a treat for me and I highly recommend it.,1225843200,,899,3.864864864864865
1391305,5,B000053VAB,"This video shows Dan at his best...his music is wonderful and he is healthy and his voice is strong. For anyone who's been to his concerts this will be a gentle (and a little sad) reminder. For those not fortunate enough to have seen him, this video is an excellent example of the music of this most beautiful artist.",1221523200,,317,4.389830508474576
1391306,4,B000053VAB,"I owe a great debt to Dan Fogelberg; he and specifically his tracks ""Longer"" and ""The Leader of the Band"" are what made me interested in picking up the acoustic guitar years back when I was a tween. It has been a hobby of mine that has made me love all kinds of music and guitar styles and hence opened up a whole new world to me. Because of his first ""Greatest Hits"" album which I had on vinyl, I was influenced to explore the field of acoustic/folk guitar in greater depth which eventually led me to names like the brilliant Jim Croce and James Taylor as well as Clarence White and even Paul Simon which further increased my repertoire.

The two tracks that I mentioned at the very top I actually spent hours painstakingly listening to the lp trying to figure out just what he was doing. It wasn't enough to just sound like the lp I wanted to play exactly like the lp and so the transcriptions that were on sale at the time although they helped to guide me a little but at the time none of them were accurate and so were unhelpful. That type of discipline and work ethic that I went through to play those tracks exactly as I heard them held me in good stead later on when it came to learning other tracks on the electric and classical guitar and so I can safely say that Dan Fogelberg is the reason I'm an all-round guitarist today. Thanks Dan!

And now to the DVD itself: if you are an audiophile, you should know that this doesn't come in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and so you are left with the PCM Stereo option as the best sonically that you can get out of this baby.  Here's hoping they re-release this after another remastering job on Blu-Ray offering much better sonic options.  Also, the picture quality is a little better than VHS and so any Blu-Ray release should try to improve upon this as well and I think with today's technology this shouldn't be too hard to do.

Watching the content though was a real treat as you get to see just how well rounded a musician Dan was which isn't apparent from just listening to the albums.  Unlike James Taylor who himself admits that he is just a guitarist, Dan shows that he's as good on keyboards as he is on acoustic and especially electric guitar.  I had always assumed that a session guitarist played all the hot riffs and solos on the albums but lo and behold Dan does them excellently live showing that he could if he wanted to beat the pants off any of the current rock, grunge or punk guitarists today.  I was impressed with his tone, attack, speed and phrasing and overall he convinced me that he was a much more complete musician than many had made him out to be just from listening to his records.

Another treat was that Jim Photoglo, a great singer and musician in his own right who was responsible for personal favourite early 80s tracks of mine such as ""Fool In Love With You"" and ""We Were Meant To Be Lovers"" was actually playing bass!  Interspersed with the live performance was also included interview snippets with Dan which I really enjoyed as it gave us glimpses of what the man's beliefs were so that you get the opportunity to know the man behind the music.

Recommended for fans of great music ala the way only Dan Fogelberg can play and an excellent way to remember the man and his music.  For me, I'm waiting for an improved upgrade to be released; I hope it's not a long wait.",1217030400,3,3361,4.3514376996805115
1391307,4,B000053VAB,"This is the only chnace now to ever see this man in concert.  I was a radio announcer for almost 26 years and worked late many nights listening to ""Same Old Lang Syne"".  It brought tears to my eyes then and still does on this video.  Although the video quality isn't perfect, considering the equipment they used back then it is amazing.  And I have no complaints about the audio.  Buy this and share it with someone you love.",1211328000,3,425,4.329113924050633
1391308,4,B000053VAB,"The show itself, that is what we are allowed to see, is really good.  I noticed that near the end, Mr. Fogelberg stated that the he and his band were performing for two hours.  However, the whole DVD, which includes interviews interspersed throughout the show, opening credits, and closing credits, lasts one hour and forty three minutes.  So, where's the missing concert footage?

Not only that but my favorite song of his, Longer, is not included.  That is a disappointment.",1210204800,2,476,4.9
1391309,4,B000053VAB,"I didn't have any issues with the sound or video quality. Maybe if I had higher quality stereo equipment I would notice a problem.

The music and performance was very satisfying. My only real complaint was that they insert Fogelberg's sometimes lengthy commentary between each song, and, for some reason, the volume jumps up about 10 decibels when he talks.

I'm not sorry I bought the DVD. It will be put into my list of favorites. R.I.P Dan Fogelberg",1205798400,,452,4.708860759493671
1391329,4,B000053VAB,"Greeting From the West is pure Fogelberg at his best. If I had taken in the most critical remarks on this DVD, I would of missed out on one great pleasure. I follow a true heart when it comes to Dan Fogelberg. He does not disappoint on this concert DVD. The beginning of the DVD is awesome with everything to the end being great. The original was taped as a VHS and then transfered to a DVD. The quality of the recording is not bad, but for what it is, it's pretty darn good!! Dan and the boys(the band) put on a heck of a show. To see Dan and Tim Weisberg is magical. I had the pleasure of seeing him twice in concert and this was a pure joy to watch. It's a must for any Fogelberg fan. Enjoy!!",1203552000,2,695,3.9714285714285715
1391330,5,B000053VAB,I didn't know much about Dan Fogelberg except for his music CD's which I own and which I have listened to over the years.  This DVD was a truly enjoyable and welcome surprize.  Dan Fogelberg is a much greater artist than I ever imagined.  I highly recommend this DVD.  It's a tribute to what is becoming a vanishing generation of truly fine American spirits.,1201737600,,358,4.546875
1391331,5,B000053VAB,"I have owned this performance on video for a number of years. Since it has deteriorated somewhat I decided to upgrade to a DVD since the technology ages better. Previous reviewers expressed disappointment with video quality. I did not find this to be true. Both the sound and video quality were excellent. Those of us who remember that when this video was first made the video tape technology was relatively new and DVD did not exist for the general public will realize that this is a good video. This is probably the only non-bootleg video/DVD of a Dan Fogelberg performance out there. As an avid long time fan I wish there were more, but he is immortalized in his words and music. He gave the world the gift of his immense talent which never diminished, and he will be greatly missed.",1201219200,2,786,4.581560283687943
1391332,5,B000053VAB,"Sadly, Dan has left us but what a treat it is to watch Dan perform in his unique one-of-a-kind, never to be duplicated style and to hear Dan speak in between songs. This is a must have for Fogelberg fans. It's a bittersweet concert to watch, knowing he has passed on, but a wonderful treasure for anyone who enjoys the music and talents of Dan Fogelberg.

I hope, in time, perhaps another DVD will be made to honor Dan's memory.",1201046400,2,428,4.35
1391333,5,B000053VAB,"I thought twice about buying this because of negative comments on the technical issues and how Sony didn't live up to expectations. Well, I'm glad I ignored that and what I gained seeing Dan in concert far outweighed any of those things. The man had an astonishing range of talent, which I was unaware of until I watched the video. His vocal range is exceptional in my opinion, as well as his guitar playing. When he sings the blues, I had goosebumps. It was also wonderful to hear him give some background to the music, especially to Leader of the Band which is a tribute to his father. The man was clearly a hugely talented and sensitive individual. I only wish I'd had the oportunity to see him in concert while he was still here. We've lost another good one folks, so get the concert on DVD and see for yourself!",1200355200,2,816,4.410596026490066
1391334,5,B000053VAB,"I rediscovered Dan's music after many years of only knowing his early work.  Now that I've smartened up and snarfed up about all his releases, I was glad to find this video so that I could get a better sense of what this remarkable person is like.  For others in that position this video gives you excellent music and some snippets from an interview and I highly recommend it.  I just hope he releases more videos of straight concert footage, with another interview as a bonus track.  What wonderful moving music.  Please Dan, tour again and film it!",1169856000,2,550,4.571428571428571
1391335,5,B000053VAB,"I really liked this concert. He covered his music up to the date of the recording, and he was excelent.",1168300800,,103,4.2
1391336,3,B000053VAB,"It's quite hard to pin down this one. Great music - a good selection of hit songs very well performed by a talented artist. The acoustic pieces are especially good, the performance of ""Make Love Stay"" is superb. Easily 5 stars for the content.

But what's up with the production? The video quality is worse than a worn-out VHS tape, the sound is barely better (and don't be fooled by the Dolby logo on the cover, the DVD has only a stereo PCM audio track). This has the potential to be a great concert DVD but the (lack of) production quality all but ruins it.

Nonetheless, I watch this quite a lot just because Dan Fogelberg is such a good artist - just seeing him play the guitar is worth it.

A minor gripe is the fact that the introduction to each song, while interesting, overlaps the actual performance. It is a little distracting in some cases, interrupting the mood. Still, the DVD is worth getting if you're willing to overlook the sub-standard video and audio quality.",1156377600,,979,4.519774011299435
1391337,1,B000053VAB,"I have the VCR copy of this and I purchased the DVD, hoping to have another way to watch it. However the quality of the DVD is horrible. It's like someone pirated it from the VCR copy. I could've done a better job with lesser equipment.",1127606400,13,236,4.1521739130434785
1391338,4,B000053VAB,"I've had this concert on VHS for several years, and it is one of the very first great concert videos.  I couldn't wait until it was on DVD, but I shouldn't have bothered.  My VHS tape looks better and sounds better than the DVD.  The audio CD of this concert blows away the VHS tape, so I know good audio is there--why didn't we get it on this DVD?  And the video looks like a VHS dub, and not even to DVD, but maybe to another VHS tape.  The video smear and blur added to the audio dullness and distortion makes for a very poor transfer to DVD.  I kid you not, I did an A/B comparison of my VHS tape to this DVD, and the tape won on both audio (VHS-HiFi) and video!
  On the other hand, this concert is such a great performance that if you like Dan Fogelberg, you'll still like it, even with the horrible DVD quality.  His rendition of ""Power of Gold"" alone justifies the price of this disc, and there are many more great songs for a bonus.  Forget the picture and sound quality and just enjoy the concert.  I'd give 5 stars for performance and 2 for the transfer and this averages to about 3.5, so I'll round it up to a 4.",1088380800,24,1124,4.0636363636363635
1391362,3,B000053VAB,"I missed Dan playing support to the Eagles back in the 70's when for some unknown reason he never turned up. Being a D.F. Fan since first hearing Homefree I had to buy this DVD. However it was never released in European format so I had to wait until I moved Stateside. I was a little disappointed to find that half the songs on the CD were missing from the DVD (what you playing at Sony!). Never the less, it's the nearest thing to seeing him live.
When are Sony or Full Moon going to release a full D.F. Concert in DVD format with decent Dolby sound? His Later material is just as good as ever and it's about time others got to see this unique artist in concert (including me!) As for only 3 stars, well if the sound quality was better and the DVD was as long as the album, it would have merited 5.",1073001600,5,799,4.095541401273885
1391363,3,B000053VAB,"The music is his usual great stuff.  But this DVD appears to be pretty much a straight copy off a tape.  The only extras are subtitles, a textual biography, and a discography.  The sound is simple PCM stereo.  The sound quality is less than wonderful.  In the spoken word bits between the tracks the sound quality is frequently very poor.  They also break up the flow in an undesirable way.  They should have been shunted off to the extras section.  Overall this DVD did nothing worthwhile to exploit the available technology.  I probably won't buy another of Dan's DVDs until I see one with rave reviews of the DVD production values.",1003708800,8,634,4.63963963963964
1391364,4,B000053VAB,"This DVD is a testament to the talent of Dan Fogelberg. His song writing is well known and has been admired for years, but his talent as a musician may not be realized by everyone who listens to his music.
I was in awe of his guitar playing, electric and acoustic, as well as his piano playing. He also does a blues number that is as blues as you can get. His acoustic slide guitar playing is awesome.

1391365,2,B000053VAB,"When I purchased my DVD player, I knew my first DVD had to be  Hell Freezes Over by the Eagles. Next, it was The Dance by Fleetwood Mac. So perhaps unrealistically, my expectations were high when I purchased this DVD, Being a Dan fan from way back.
The song list is great, and this must have been a good concert to see in-person. All the good stuff is pointed out in the other reviews, so i'll focus on what was wrong with it, and try to balance out the score.
Unfortunately, it shows it's age. It should have been a clue that it wasn't being presented in Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS, or even Pro-Logic. This concert should have been remastered before pressing the DVD. The sound stage is almost non-existent, at best when Dan plays the solo accoustic work. There's little or no separation of the stereo image. You might as well listen to it on your 50.00 boom box. And when Dan injects his commentary in-between, and sometimes on top of songs, it booms out, and distorts. especially if you've pumped up the volume a notch to make up for the lack of depth. The same applies to the picture quality, but this may be more at the source, than the way the DVD was pressed.
The presentation was also disappointing, with a bleak stage, having a kind of adobe walls, and American Indian folk art being the extent of any artistic expression. I know Dan is a nature boy, and I think that's cool. And he certainly needs no elaborate stage to present his music on. Quite the contrary actually, as I was hoping for a setting the likes of Kenny Loggins Redwoods Concert, and outdoors at a minimum. Perhaps Sedona (AZ) would have been a good setting (can you imagine)!
As far as his supporting band, and even some of Dan's equipment is concerned, there was also something to be desired. Don't get me wrong, the talent was there, just not the quality. For instance; There was far too much ""synthesized"" keyboard, bringing to mind a cheap one man bar band sound. In Leader of the Band, listen for what should be the horn solo. Instead it's poorly presented by a synth, that sounds well, like a synth. And again on Same Old Lang Syne, which should have been played on a baby grand. Instead Dan used a synth with the depth of a garage sale keyboard.
So there's my take, but if you're expecting to ""experience"" the concert, like you were there, forget it. Send Dan a letter and tell him to please do another. ""If he builds it, it will sell!"" Dan's music is certainly deserving of much, much more. It was just a marginal first attempt. If you only want a documentary, you won't be disappointed.
C'mon Dan, let's have it!",994204800,14,2594,4.438155136268344
1391366,5,B000053VAB,"Okay, I'll be honest. I've given this video the ultimate 5 stars because Dan is the only long time favorite artist that I have never seen live. He was supposed to appear as the opening act for the Eagles in 1977 (!!!) in my hometown, but he didn't turn up. So you can understand my excitement when playing this video for the first time. Dan has grown up; he started out with love-gone-by lamenting songs and has gradually introduced themes like the preservation of nature and wildlife. He remains a true gem among all singer/songwriters. This video is incomplete, compared to the album; some of his classics (like 'Ol' Tenessee') are missing. But what the heck.

The songs are familiar, if reduced in number, from the ""Greetings From the West"" CD. The best ones are the purely acoustic versions. ""Make Love Stay"" is exceptional. Best bit about the DVD is that there are between-song snatches of a Dan interview. Sound quality is pretty much as the CD as far as I could tell.

He is also a very talented musician and songwriter, and I fell in love with his music the first time I heard it.

It is such a treat to see this great performance. I have been to many of his concerts, but this gives you a chance to see him up close, and he and his band are terrific. The music covers a wide span of his work, and there are songs, such as a few from his CD ""The Wild Places,"" that I have never heard at his other concerts.

Again, as DF has never  made it across the ocean for a concert tour over here, the video is all  have after 23 years of listening to the man's music to make up for never  having been able to see him on stage.
