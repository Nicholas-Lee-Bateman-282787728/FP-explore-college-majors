A largely forgotten era, the Malayan Emergency was a time of personal differences going through the whole gambit of interaction to find a satisfactory conclusion which didn't rely entirely on force of arms.",1360454400,,289,5.041666666666667

I really look forward to watching this oldie. It was made in 1950s depicting the then British Malaya which was under the threat of an armed uprising by the remnants of the Anti-Japanese Force led by Chin Peng in the deep jungles. It was a bloody struggle between the 5 thousand armed ""Communist Terrorists"" or C.T. and the British Commonwealth Troops. Several thousand young British service men died in the cause of this political uprising. If one visits the Cheras Christian Cemetery today, one would be able to see rows and rows of white marble tablets which inscribe the names of the departed young British service men - usually aged 19 to 25 or older. The then British High Commissioner, Sir Henry Gurney, while serving in Malaya was murdered by the C.Ts on the windy road leading to Fraser's Hill in 1951. Under attack, the brave Sir Henry exited from his official car and was instantly shot to death just to save his Malay driver and his wife. His remains are  buried along with his service men at the Cheras Christian Cemetery. I was then a mere kid when I saw the funeral of Sir Henry Gurney. Then British  under PM  Sir Winston Churchill desptached another High Commissioner to Malaya with wide civilian and military powers - Sir Gerald Templer, nicknamed The Tiger of Malaya. His military strategies helped  to defeat the uprising eventually. He said: ""Whoever called off the Emergency would be shot at, this bastard...""
The national Emergency came to an end in 1960 when the C.Ts were routed....Cheers...!",1268956800,9,1677,4.752577319587629
