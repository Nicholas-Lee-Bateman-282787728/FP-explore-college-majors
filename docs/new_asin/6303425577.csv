644756,5,6303425577,"I can't believe the reviewer from East Asia. Somehow he/she missed the point. The point was to depict what was going on in the Soviet Union at a time Soviet revisionists in the West were writing that the Soviet system was strong, viable, and was transforming into some sort of Euro-style socialist democracy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Even the CIA missed the boat on what really was going on (read Walter Laquer's book on the fall of the Soviet Union). Without the character played by the American, there would have been no story. The movie was contrasting the spirit of American ""can do"" with Russian fatalism. I suspect the reviewer from East Asia has some affinity for either socialism or communism and this is his real objection to the moview. Great movie! (read the new Applebaum book on the Gulag system.....). Lavrentiy Larenchencko",1084147200,13,854,4.8561643835616435
644757,5,6303425577,Saw this movie years ago and am now lucky enough to have one on the way.  I think the actors portrayed a realistic version of a potentially deadly situation.  It takes awhile for them to realize that their country isn't coming to their rescue and they must do it themselves.  One of my favorite David Keith movies!!! (a movie loving grandma!).,1061942400,8,343,4.590163934426229
644758,5,6303425577,I think Gulag is a great movie one you can watch over and over. I taped it off HBo years ago and have misplaced the copies after all these years I have been looking for it. It is a movie worth watching. It keeps you guessing.,1008720000,5,225,3.9130434782608696
644759,1,6303425577,"I cannot believe that the reviewer before me gave this movie such a good review! I will start with some of the good points first - the misery and conditions of the camp that the prisoners go to is probably a good represention, although not having been to one, I can only imagine... Another plus or authenticity is the fact that the Russians use Russian to each other, instead of speaking English in fake East European accents that we are supposed to take for them speaking another language. Now to the bit I like the most - the bad bits!
I don't know whether this is just me - perhaps this type of hero is what Americans in the 80's loved, but the main character was one of the most unpleasant, arrogant fools I have ever seen in a movie! I would have been quite happy for the Russians, who, frankly, were much more prepossessing, to get rid of him in the first scene. Come on! If you had got sentenced to 10 years in a gulag, don't you think that your spirit may have been broken just a little. No, not him! Our all-American hero is still too mouthy...or too stupid!!! In general terms, I felt that there was no depth to any of the characters. You hardly know them, but to empathize with them you need to be able to get into their minds more - a great failing of this movie. My advice is - avoid this awful film at all costs!",1001462400,3,1326,4.203921568627451
644760,5,6303425577,"Luckily I have had this movie for quite a while.  I watch it as often as I can.  Michael Almon, an olympic athelete, is participating in the goodwill games in Moscow.  He is conned into smuggling some secret doccuments to the west.  He is then convicted as a spy and sentenced to a nation of Siberian prisons called the Gulag.  By learning a magic trick there using a box and piece of paper, he learns how to escape this man made hell on Earth.  After getting out, he and his companions must learn to face the tundra, the weather, and each other.  This is a must-see movie.  I wish they would re-release it.  It shows just how much a man is capable of enduring when he has a dream he believes in.",997401600,18,696,4.212121212121212

7846844,5,6303425577,I am a retired  DOC Correctional Counselor and I used to show this film to Inmates.  To show them what could happen to them if they tried some of there fun and games in another Country where your American citizenship doesn't protect you.  I think more of our people need to see movies like this.,1401926400,4,295,4.327272727272727

Goodwill, it is not rated, yet, Gods name was defamed several times.  the f-word i can handle.....but, i continued to watch the entire movie. It makes one stop and think before going to a foreign country.  espcially one like russia or iran.",1313884800,2,321,4.696428571428571
7846847,4,6303425577,"I won't write a synopsis or critique of the film here, as that has been done by people who both love and hate it.  Suffice it to say I love this film and am glad any version of it is available in any format.  If you get a hold of the 1985 VHS release by Prism Entertainment, it will have 11 minutes worth of scenes missing from the original film, notably the scene where Keith and Macdowell have a glove-sewing contest.  Other than that it was very enjoyable.",1290556800,3,459,4.193181818181818
7846848,5,6303425577,"To the point - when I saw this on TV, I bought it right away when the VHS became available.  It's old now, useless, won't play without dragging because it's been played A LOT!  This movie should be put on DVD without delay.  A no brainer, Lorimar & HBO (yeah, I'm talkin' to you!).  One of the best dramas of its time.  If one should find it at a garage sale or used outlet venue, get it!",1282176000,,388,3.987012987012987
7846849,4,6303425577,"I remember when this movie was on HBO back in the mid 80's and I watched it each time it was on. I was lucky enough to get a VHS edition of this movie off eBay for pretty cheap a couple of years ago, but I was disappointed to see that on the VHS version of the movie, they totally eliminated the glove sewing contest that was the film - where Roddy McDowell and the Asian man were competing to see who could sew the most gloves! I remember that scene distinctly and it wasn't on the video!

I just hope IF it ever is released on DVD - they put ALL the scenes back in like it was originally shown on HBO.

This is a great movie for those who also enjoyed Midnight Express - another foreign prison movie!",1100390400,5,702,4.007142857142857
