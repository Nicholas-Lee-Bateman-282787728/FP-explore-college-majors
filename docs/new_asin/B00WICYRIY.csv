7132607,5,B00WICYRIY,"really enjoyed this dvd, yes there's a lot of filler, but it's tolerable filler, like the Kakashi and Gai vs the swordsmen.

i love it when they put other characters on the covers of the dvds. i hope that when they get to the Kakashi ANBU arc they'll use one of the Japanese dvd covers for that mini series (there were 4 covers for that arc), but since they'll all be in one volume (28 i believe) it would make sense to use ANBU Kakashi on the cover.",1450483200,,450,4.113636363636363

7132640,5,B00WICYRIY,"While this set contains several canon episodes, the most noteworthy feature in my opinion is the six-episode Power Arc (episodes 290-295) that was created to commemorate the completion of 500 total episodes of Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, which are often regarded as the only ""filler"" episodes in the series that are truly worth watching.

It's widely believed that Power was originally conceived as the Naruto movie for 2012, but was instead turned into a televised arc when Kishimoto decided to make Road to Ninja. This is a pretty solid assumption, as the Power Arc features six straight episodes of feature film quality animation, easily the longest stretch of consistently high quality animation in the entire anime series. The entire arc is beautifully animated, with excellent composition and some of the best fight correography in the series.

The story of this arc centers around Kabuto perfecting the Edotensei Reanimation jutsu while seeking out an ancient source of power in a secluded village. Naruto and the Konoha ninjas find themselves protecting a group of orphans and their caretakers while doing battle with Kabuto and a small army of reanimated ninjas. Kabuto also creates genetic clones of Naruto and Hidan, resulting in some pretty amazing battles. There's even some foreshadowing of Naruto's eventual mastery of Chakra Mode and Tailed Beast Mode, as well as Kabuto's eventual metamorphosis, and this is the only time you'll ever see Naruto lose control and do battle in his Seven Tailed form.

To sweeten the deal, the DVD version of the Power arc is an extended director's cut, expanded well beyond the original Japanese television broadcast.",1439078400,7,1666,5.208955223880597

7132643,5,B00WICYRIY,"This box set is pretty cool, it starts off with fighting & sealing 5 more of the Seven Ninja Swordsman of the Mist (1 left). Then it shows 6 episodes on how Kabuto perfected the Reanimation Jutsu & in the last episode of the box set, Naruto & Bee finally enter the frontline on the battlefield.",1438646400,4,294,4.267857142857143
