943738,5,6304932812,The book and video by Monty Roberts are very good.  I wish more people could realize how important his style of handling animals should be used in real life situations (with people as well as animals).  Hope to hear more  from this great man before he gets too old to write.  Would love to read  more of his tales of his life experiences.,913507200,,338,4.301587301587301
943739,5,6304932812,I was fortunate enough to see Monty Robert's in person.  His work with horses is beautiful!  The whole arena was completly captivated from the moment he began.  Please see this video if you can't see him in person.  No  one should go near a horse or any animal without taking some of this with  them.,913420800,,300,4.363636363636363
943902,1,6304932812,"Round penning is useful for some horses but is contraindicated for others.

Only kids and novices and the extremely gullible are impressed by Monty's stuff. The rest of us have seen and used round penning long before Monty became an international superstar through the use of modern media.

943903,5,6304932812,"I saw the vidio some time ago ( 4 years?)  and was totaly impressed.  As a young girl some 45 years ago I used to be very involved with horses and used a lot of Mont Roberts techniques although I never new it at the time.  Many people commented on how horses trusted me and I could get them to do things that other people couln't.  I just thought that they liked me and felt comfortable around me and just did what was expected of them untill my father told me that I had a special gift with them and to just go with the flow.  I never realized until I read the book and watched the vidio just how special my connection was with the horses.  Unfortunately I do not have any horses now, But my grand daughter has inherited my love for horses and wants to learn more about the training and handling of them, which I am really happy about.  I want to get the vidio and book for her and I'm sure she will be wonderful.  I saw how Monty Roberts spent so much time and patience to earn the respect and trust of the horses and have done the same as a young girl and nothing else mattered just as long as you could spend time with the horses and win thier trust and just be able to pet them and talk to them, never mind to be able to ride them eventually.  I saw how they would respond to different tones of voice and body language and would act accordingly.  It was wonderful, how I wish I could go back to those wonderful carefree days.  Maybe my grandaughter will do it for both of us.  I strongly recommend both the book and the vidio to anyone who really wants to learn about horses and to train them the right way with love and understanding.  I am glad that Monty Roberts wrote the book an did the vidio so as to pass on the knowledge he has so young people like my grand daughter can get the benifit of his experiences and the tradition can carry on.  Thank You Monty Roberts!",1126224000,10,1876,4.090163934426229
943904,5,6304932812,Monty has nothing but the best in mind for these horses. I don't care if he is making money from his books and videos. Would anyone do this for free? I doubt it. The critics giving reviews must not be true horse lovers or they would support any non-violent methods for working with these beautiful animals. I wish there were more people in the world who see horses the way he does. Horses are not the mindless creatures people make them out to be and I think Monty's methods prove that.,1079049600,9,486,4.351648351648351
943905,5,6304932812,"This is an amazing story of triumph!  Monty takes you on a quite a journey as he attempts to tame a wild mustang.  As trying as it seems at times, he refuses to lose faith in his method for taming horses.  You are hopeful for him as applies his techniques and the story gradually unfolds.  Monty shows his viewers that, with gentle understanding, we can learn to see our own horses for the wonderful, docile creatures they are.",1002672000,8,427,4.435897435897436
943906,5,6304932812,This tape is a very useful tool for both the beginner and the advanced  horse owner.  I have used the Monty Roberts methods and have found them to  be very effective.  An absolute must for your video library.  You won't be  disappointed.,965347200,18,237,4.523809523809524
943907,5,6304932812,I thought this video was excellent!  I enjoyed watching it....and after viewing it...i wished there were more.  If you like this video I would suggest listening to the audio book by the same title...it really goes  further than the movie.  As for all the recent scandalous news about Monty  Roberts - I would suggest not believing all you hear or read.  This man  obviously knows his stuff and unfortunately has bad relatives.  I found  this video to be entertaining and educating!  I used Monty Roberts join up  technique on my mare with amazing results!,955584000,7,555,4.797872340425532
943908,5,6304932812,"I don't understand the two reviewers who thought this was a farce. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have tried a variety of Monty's suggestions albeit with well-trained polo ponies. Still, the responses of  these horses to my Monty Roberts-inspired methods of getting their  cooperation and the whole experience borders on the Zen of the relationship  between man and horse. Why am I convinced Monty is right? Because these 6  horses belong to a friend of mine. Not me. They don't have the day to day  familiarity to accept me unless Monty is right about everything. My 11 year  old daughter is convinced too.",939686400,43,619,4.7924528301886795

7880060,5,6304932812,Monty Roberts is the best horse trainer I have ever had the pleasure of watching. He knows the true nature of horses.,1375142400,,117,4.363636363636363
7880061,3,6304932812,Well done. More  self advertisement thoough then of what he really does. HIs other videos are much better. Study him well,1374019200,,121,4.761904761904762
7880062,5,6304932812,Really good read.  I've met Monty several times at equine events and he's truly a nice guy.  it was nice to read about how his life and career came to be.,1365120000,,154,3.935483870967742
7880063,5,6304932812,THIS IS ONE EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF DISCIPLINED LOVE CONQUERING THE WILD BEAST.  IT WORKS WITH CHILDREN AS WELL AS WILD HORSES!  It would be a worthy goal for all of us in raising children to be caring adults because of the disciplined care parents give them.  I can't say enough good about this film!,1304812800,,298,4.481481481481482

7880065,5,6304932812,"This documentary is a very touching review of how Mr. Roberts learned the secrets of equine communication, and an even more touching revelation of how that language connects man and horse.  As Mr. Roberts learned, he applied the principles to communication with troubled children and got the same touching and astounding results.  God has blessed this man!!",1284940800,,357,5.245614035087719
7880066,5,6304932812,"I have bought/studies different methods of Natural horsemanship, from Clinton Anderson, Parelli, John Lyons.... I really liked his simplicity and getting to the most important aspect of enjoying our horses and loving them. I have 3 colts and have done all the exersises to a point where they are programed but lost the real communication that you have when your a kid and are not embarressed to show your feelings and connect as if you were a horse communicating. I grew up around horses as a kid and as an adult (38 yo) we seem to loose that intuition. My hat off to Monty at humbling himself, as other cowboys would never love on their horse like that. In public non the less. My horses have been much more conected with me now and I truly enjoy them and our parnership. Unlike the Slave relationship that horses have had to endure for so long. Monty's educational background in Phycology has brought him far and his antilitical concepts help us see what others have ignored. I have read his books. You don't have to be a whiz that something so simple works so effective. He has been around far longer than all these young guy's. He has far more popularity in Europe. I think he breaks tradition so much here some have a predudice against him. Too bad so many are stuck in that Mancho image.",1174262400,3,1293,4.506382978723404
7880067,5,6304932812,"Monty Roberts trained the Queen of England's Stable Hands, at her behest. She ask Monty Roberts to come to England to demonstrate is techniques to Her Majesty and her Royal Stable Hands.  The Queen went to the Royal Stables to watch him demonstrate his technique, on the horses her staff had selected.  Her Majesty was so impressed with Monty Roberts and his techniques, she hired him to train several of her most senior stable hands.

How do I know this?  I lived in London England at the time.  Now, I don't know about you but if it is good enough for one of the most experienced riders, not to mention the QUEEN of England, I wager I am not the fool for believing my eyes; the fool would be the person who doesn't.

I am a very experienced rider as are many in my family and I KNOW horses and horse behavior - when I used the techniques I learned, THEY WORKED!

When I saw the 3 documentaries aired on the BBC, I thought ""I have nothing to lose, I'll try it"" and I have to say this man is unbelievable.

I think you need only look at how his approach has worked on humans to know, God gave this man a gift, a gift of spirit and compassion for all living things and it shows in his work.

Honestly, think to yourself ""what have I got to lose"". For $20 (for a good used copy of the tape here on Amazon), it is worth trying the 'softly, softly' approach.

I think you will be shocked at the results.",1152489600,6,1399,4.16728624535316
