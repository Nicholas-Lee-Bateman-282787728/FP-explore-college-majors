4648484,5,B005BX3K80,This is a great video.  I have five of the Leslie Sansone walking videos.  This one gives a good upper body workout by adding hand weights while doing the walking exercises.  I like to alternate this with other Leslie Sansone videos throughout the week.,1323648000,10,253,4.704545454545454
4648485,2,B005BX3K80,"Unfortunately, I had to return the video.  It did not work at all.  The pixels were jumping all over the screen.",1323302400,,112,4.285714285714286
4648486,4,B005BX3K80,"I have several of her dvds and this seemed to lean to the overly cautious side. She warns again and again about not using too much weight or moving too quickly or over stressing your muscles. While this is good advice for a beginner and not a bad thing to mention, you need more weight than she uses to put a bit of stress on the muscle if you want to make some progress.

It just makes me wonder if someone did something foolish and they got sued. It is just another sign of the overly-litegous society we have become.

I do like the choice of the one, two or three miles and in general all of the moves are really very helpful. She is cheerful and encouraging without being too giggly or chipper. After you have worked out using a dvd for the umpteenth time it gets annoying to hear that giggle. Although I must admit I totally get jazzed when I hear we have done a mile and my dog who watches me work out gets woken up by my cheer.",1322179200,9,934,4.098360655737705
4648487,5,B005BX3K80,"The combination of walking and weight training in this one workout helps you get a better workout in less time.

If you're new to weight training, the one-mile workout is a perfect way to get started.  Leslie gives very good instruction on proper form, technique and safely using one-pound wrist weights.  If you're more advanced, this is a good workout for days that you're short on time.

The two-mile workout is my ""go to"" workout for week days.  It's approximately 30-35 minutes long and after using it for two short weeks, I could see that my arms were more muscular already.  Even though Leslie takes a conservative approach to this workout using one- and two-pound weights, it's possible to get results by following the DVD exactly.  For those people who want to use the weights longer than she recommends, she also gives direction on how to do the moves safely.  Very smart.

If you're looking for a challenging workout that doesn't exhaust you, the three-mile workout is for you.  She uses two- and three-pound weights and even incorporates some gentle jogging.  The pace is brisk, so the cardio is good.  I like the slow, controlled lateral raise sequence she does at the very beginning of the workout because it helps me focus on proper form.

A couple of things I would like to have seen in this workout are longer cool downs and more upper body stretches.  I find that I need to do extra stretches after every workout.  A separate, optional segment with extra upper body stretches would be a great solution.

The music is also on Leslie's other workout DVDs, which is fine.  There's a nice variety of songs.

One thing that could be improved about the production of the DVD is the audio.  The volume needs to be turned up and seems to be uneven throughout the DVD.

Overall, this is a great DVD - I recommend it!",1322179200,50,1825,4.626168224299065
4648488,5,B005BX3K80,"I love this DVD. You can chose different lengths of walks, so it fits into your day better. I've been doing this workout 2 weeks and can already see results. Leslie is fun and motivational. I have done TONS of video workouts and this is by far one of my favorites. She's so laid-back and easy to follow that you won't mind working out!",1320710400,28,335,4.25
4648489,5,B005BX3K80,Leslie definitely boosts the energy in this DVD. The use of weights (I used 2 lbs for most of it) increases the calorie burn and intensity of the workout. Absolutely worth adding to your fitness library.,1319932800,15,203,4.666666666666667
4648490,5,B005BX3K80,"I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with this newer dvd.  Over the past year, I have done a lot of Leslie's dvds.  I like change, so I usually mix up my collection so that I am not bored.  This dvd is a nice mix to add to my collection.  I have only tried the 3 mile walk, and I was pleased with this walk.  She uses a variety of hand weights with the routine...she switched from 1lb. to 3lbs.  I kept my 2lb. weights on most of the time.  After the three miles, I was very sweaty.  It has been a long time since a Lesley dvd has made me sweat so much!",1319328000,110,559,3.8
4648491,5,B005BX3K80,"This is by far the best leslie sansone released.  She alternates 1, 2 and 3 pound weights throughout the tape which she uses during cardio workouts.  i have never burned so much calories before.
In addition it is a tremendous amount of fun.  Buy it!",1318204800,114,249,4.488888888888889
4648492,5,B005BX3K80,"This is a great DVD. I love the focus that Leslie has in this one, and I personally found each mile wonderfully challenging. As with all of her exercise programs, you can tailor this one to fit your own abilities by adding more weight and boosting the moves (lift legs higher, stretch out on the side steps, etc.) I own a huge variety of Walk at Home DVDs to keep my workouts interesting. Also, one of the most motivating points I've ever heard in her DVDs is that ""you can always fit in time to workout."" And, it's true. With each DVD broken down into single miles, you can do a 12-15 minute mile-per-day. Hey, it's a start, right? Can't do 15 minutes? Do 5 minutes. Before you know it, you'll be hooked like the rest of the Walk at Home fans, and you'll start wondering where you're going to fit in the rest of your life around your new passion: walking! And, one more thing: if you are new to working out, Leslie is one of the greatest fitness motivators ever. She doesn't make you feel like an idiot, and she's not one of these ""feel the burn"" divas. She's a real person, with a huge heart, and an obvious passion for fitness. Not because she wants you to look like a cover girl from Cosmo. But because she cares about your good health (physical and emotional), quality of life, and longevity. Buy the DVD, and get walking! You'll love it.",1318204800,258,1343,4.333333333333333
4648493,5,B005BX3K80,"I LOVE this DVD!!!  I had gastric bypass surgery 3 months ago and have lost 70 pounds and have now added working out to my daily routine!  This is hard for me, but I can still do it without feeling like I'm going to pass out.  I am able to choose between 3 different workouts and whether or not I want Leslie talking while I do the workout.  I have done each workout, and they are really great.  It's best to have 1 or 2 pound hand weights that you can strap on to really do the workout correctly.
I feel amazing when I have done this, and love her stuff.",1453766400,,555,3.963963963963964

4648496,4,B005BX3K80,"The key with this is you have to challenge yourself a bit.  I boost in this one.  I only use up to 5 lb hand weights (average between 2 and 3lbs hand weights) or I may go with the weighted balls and wear a weighted vest or use ankle weights since the walking is a good pace but not so brisk that you risk rolling your ankle.  This is an older DVD - Leslie's entire set and style is completely different to what she uses now so for those who hate this, just keep that in mind.

That being said, this is a good one to keep in rotation when you don't want to do high impact and want to focus on arm toning - I use this with one of her older strength training DVDs - good workout.",1448928000,2,676,3.841726618705036

4648503,3,B005BX3K80,"I was a little disappointed in this video.  The sound quality is not as good. We did the 2 mile first and she dressed in black top on black background. Also, Leslie gave very little advance warning of the moves coming up. I'm sure I will get used to it, but it was difficult to follow on the first go round.  And almost NO stretching.  Just a VERY few arm stretches in less than 30 seconds.  What is up with that.  On all the other videos that we have of hers (6) she stresses the importance of stretching.",1441324800,,506,4.122448979591836

4648521,4,B005BX3K80,"This is hands down one of my favorite dvds of hers.  The fact that you can carry weights and move adds greatly to intensity, calorie burn and overall cardio activity.  I have very select Leslie Sansone dvds that have faster pace, longer times and either weights or interval training.  These are the ones I come back to time and again to retain the fitness I have gained and move beyond it.  This one is definitely a keeper.

The sad thing is that she loses count and rhythm in this dvd quite a few times.  And for her being a professional doing this dvd I find this inexcusable.  She gets paid doing these dvs and they are no better than some of the trainers in some of the workout spas.... as a matter of fact some of those women are much better than she is.  I use the dvd because it IS a good workout, but listening to her at times really gets to me.  Especially when she loses her rhythm and screws.  I have given up looking at the dvd and just go by her cues and the music.  I don't know if anyone else feels that way, but it really gets to me.  To pay for a professionally made dvd and then you get something that she probably just did one time and never even rehearsed to get all the steps right.  I guess I am a perfectionist and I have been exercising for over 40 years and therefore these kind of things really get on my nerves.",1416182400,3,1088,3.967741935483871

4648564,5,B005BX3K80,"I have a number of Leslie's videos, but this one and 4 Fast Miles are my 2 favorites.

Nuts and bolts:  This DVD has 3 different videos, so you can select one mile (19 minutes), two miles (34 minutes), or 3 miles (48 minutes), each with its own warm up and stretch at the end.  Also, for each session the user has the option of music only or full audio with Leslie's chatting and cuing.

My input:  I did the 3-mile today and I burned about 276 calories (as rated by my monitor).  If I push, I can burn 300 in 45 minutes, and I could have ramped this up myself (which I sometimes do), but I wanted to follow her exactly so I could post the outcome.  She swaps from no hand weights, to one pounders, to twos, to threes, and back, so that's another place where you can push yourself that little extra, or just take it easy if you've had a long day and want the feel-good of at least moving around.

My sister-in-law was visiting, did this video and went home and bought one.  I loaned my first one to my neighbor (early 60s) and never got it back as she and her husband were doing it almost daily, so I bought another for myself.  Then I found out that my neighbors bought another one to give to another neighbor!  Happy walking!",1394668800,4,1227,4.156779661016949

I should note that I ONLY use 3 lb weights for these workouts because I don't have any weights less than 3 lbs.  I am young & pretty fit, but I definitely sweat with this workout (even the 1 mile).  I highly recommend this DVD, whether you're trying to lose weight or just maintain, because this is a wonderful low-impact workout that makes you sweat as if you're doing a high impact workout.  Easy on your joints, yet VERY effective (and safe). I love leslie!!",1390003200,2,557,4.378640776699029

I have lots of workout tapes, and I can really get into them when I turn up the jams, but Sansone's doesn't go up!  This workout is among the best 5 that she has put out.  It really brings about the sweat because of the light weights.  Even the one mile workout is a sweat producer.

I have several of her videos that I like, however this one gets you breathing heavy since you use weights for most of the entire 3 miles.  I used 3 pound weights till she said to stop.  This one had me sweating more than the 4 mile walk videos I own.  So happy to add this to  my rotation!  I'm hoping this can help me walk off the pounds!",1382745600,8,419,3.7586206896551726

Leslie is the only person in these workouts and gives her usual great motivational comments which I truly enjoy! I also enjoy the boosts without weights that she includes.  I am so thankful I made this purchase!",1381449600,2,305,5.08
4648577,5,B005BX3K80,"I made fun of Leslie Sansone's latest DVD (30 Days Something or Other) in my review of it, but I like this older workout. There's no group of grinning 20-year-olds behind her, just Leslie talking directly to you. (And you can choose a music-only option if you wish--although I've done this workout so many times that I know exactly what she's saying and find myself actually reading her lips.) I do the one-mile walk nearly every day around lunchtime.

The best thing about Leslie's approach is her emphasis on proper form, which is relatively easy to maintain because the steps in her workouts are so basic. And I am here to tell you that BASIC STEPS ARE A GOOD THING. The best shape I was ever in was during my 30s, when I took a twice-weekly low-impact aerobics class with an instructor who wore a headband, leotard, and leg-warmers (yeah, it was the '80s!). Basic marching, sidesteps, knee-lifts, front kicks, kickbacks, toe taps, etc., etc., done with proper form, beats jumping around, dancing, and all the other junk that's out there in terms of getting you into good shape. For years I've been looking for someone who skips the baloney and concentrates on the basics--and Leslie really does deliver. (I know she has Pilates and other sorts of workouts available, but they don't interest me. I'm guessing, however, that they are done with the same emphasis on good form and safety.)

The worst thing about her DVDs is the music, which is pretty repetitive and boring. (Ahhh, I fondly remember my 1980s instructor's mix tape that included Springsteen's ""Pink Cadillac""...) But it could be worse. I work out at the local YMCA gym two or three times a week, and there's usually a Zumba class in progress. That music makes me want to blow my brains out. And as I watch the poor participants flailing about, trying to keep up with stupid dance steps, I want to tell them all to go buy a Leslie ""Walking"" DVD. Boring music or not, they'd get fit faster. I'm not yet back into the shape I was during my 30s, but I'm getting there. And Leslie's walk-at-home program has really helped.",1378425600,4,2083,4.657608695652174

4648579,5,B005BX3K80,I like this DVD because it really helps you get toned and stay that way.  It is challenging but not too much and the results are exactly what I expected.,1377216000,,153,4.1

With my Doctor's OK, I slowly started adding the weights and after building up to the full 3 mile exercise program (it took approximately 3 weeks) I have noticed more arm strength as well as better back. sholder, and ribcage definition.
I will never be a young person again (I am 69) however I do look much better and have met my weight loss goal. I am on Weight Watcher Maintenance now and feel so much better about my body and myself in general that I recently went out and purchased almost a whole new wardrobe.

4648593,4,B005BX3K80,"**Pros**
1) When you view the menu screen, it's broken into separate miles. You got One Mile, Two Miles, and then Three Miles. But it also gives you the choice to either do her workouts the normal way, or do her workouts to where you only hear the music and not her voice. I did music only for her 2-mile one and it was so awkward watching her talk but hearing only the music. Plus I don't know how much help that'd be as you miss your step, trying to read her mouth to guess when she'll stop or start the next move.

2) She does not kill you with the weight lifting. She's very pleasant with the arms and the pace of the workout and will encourage you to take a break from it if you need to.

3) Each Mile has it's own length of time, meaning she does not stick Mile one from Mile One level and combine that with Mile two level, etc. Each level is actually their own thing. So you're not bored with looking at the same mile one for all levels.

**Cons**
1)Almost all of her music is recycled from the DVD 'Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home - 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk'. I'm really BIG with music. I LOVE music, but when she uses the same songs, it makes me feel like I didn't buy anything different from the last purchase. But I have to give her some credit because there must be a reason as to why she continues to use the same songs. Even she may be tired of it.

2) She's alone. I usually like when she's with people. It just gives you more personality, more to look at/observe, maybe even more distraction. I find her too lonely when she's alone.

3)It only gives you a countdown clock on Mile one level. For whatever reason it disappears for the last two levels. But it is on the back of the DVD case. HOWEVER, even though in total it says 101 minutes, the minutes seem a little off. For example Level Mile One says 19 minutes, but it's really 15 or 17. Level Mile three says about 48 minutes when it's really like 45. But just in case I'm wrong and the workout is a total of 101 minutes, If you do the entire DVD in a day, I think you burn like 470 calories. At leas that's what My calorie counter profile says.

4)The music also changes up quickly only for the Mile 3. It doesn't finish fully. It's like they wanted to stick a bunch of songs in the last mile. I guess this really would not be a pro or con, but usually two full songs equals one mile done. So the changing in music might get your hopes up too early.

5)When popping in the DVD, it does not go straight to the menu. There's some little hindering you have to watch before you get to the menu screen. I'm not sure if you can skip it. Also before starting each level, there is some hindering too.

Overall, I still think this DVD is worth it.",1368057600,6,2705,4.090566037735849

In fact, the only type of exercise I really enjoy is walking. I love going out, turning on my music and walking by myself for literally hours. Needless to say, when it's 20 degrees and snowing or raining, that doesn't really pan out well either. So, when I found this video, I thought it wouldn't hurt to give it a try, and the worst that could happen is that I'd be out ten bucks. As it turned out, I absolutely loved it. First, the instructor is middle-aged, which gives hope to the over-40 female set that fitness can be both achieved and maintained. Second, she doesn't do any showoff moves. She had my attention the minute she said something along the lines of, ""Left, right, whatever, you don't have to follow this exactly!"" She demonstrates four easy-to-follow steps and shows how to use the handweights to exercise the upper body, so the workout is very easy to follow. I also like the fact that I don't need any special equipment beyond a TV, DVD and the handweights, which are optional. Her exercises don't require a great deal of space, either. The area rug in front of my TV was all the workout room I needed. The best part is that the video comes with a 15-minute one-mile, 30-minute two-mile and 45-minute three-mile workout, which allows me to work out even on a tight schedule and feel like I'm still making progress toward my fitness goals. This video is ideal for someone who is just beginning to work out, but it can be intensified for a more advanced workout, so there's something in it for everyone.",1361664000,,1929,4.626822157434402
4648617,4,B005BX3K80,"I love this workout. One of my favorites that I've done, from Leslie!! She is really focused on this one (not too talkative or laughing too much, etc.). That's what I really liked about this video. Great workout, highly recommend!",1361491200,,230,4.775
4648618,4,B005BX3K80,"I have a lot of the Walk at Home DVD's- I am giving this one 4 stars as it has the main feature I like, Multiple complete workouts to choose from (In this case 3)- it gets a star knocked off b/c I find in these sessions Leslie isn't as vocal about annoucning the transitions into different moves.  Not a big deal- just watch her closely and you will know when she transitions.  For me, I tend to just listen and not watch her unless it is a new move that I am not familiar with.  So I found myself glancing at the DVD and realizing she was back to walking or onto a different move when I was still doing the previous one.  Again, not a big deal- now I know for this DVD I have to watch her more closely.

While it doesn't matter to me, some viewers might not like the fact that this is a solo Leslie workout, meaning she doesn't have a team of people with her also performing the walk.  It is just her.

What I really love about this work out is the focus on the arm strength training- it really gives your arms a good workout so if you want a day that focuses on upper body and arms in particular,this is a great Walk at Home workout to add to your collection.  In the video Leslie uses hand weights- they are not included but you can get your own or just do the workouts without them.  One good thing is that she provides instruction on how to perform the moves with or without weights (slower, smaller controlled movements if you are wearing the weights; bigger and faster movements without the weights)

Overall I really like this workout collection from the Walk at Home line and it will definitely feature strongly in my rotation.",1361059200,2,1636,4.214743589743589

4648624,4,B005BX3K80,"Let's cut to the chase. The one mile and two mile walks are dull. The three mile workout is dynamite. Leslie uses different weights and keeps the music zippy to keep you going. This is a good, fun workout that will have you sweating and smiling. I can't imagine doing the one or two mile again for any reason (she has better workouts for those distances) but I will be definitely be coming back to that three mile fat burner.

These three workouts seem to come from different universes, although they all take place in her studio. The one mile has a backwards counter a la Exercise TV, from which it may have originated. Pretty cool. The other two do not have any counters at all. Wouldn't it be nice if Leslie made her formats more consistent with the same sort of counter on all her videos? What about a step counter along with a distance and time counter? Wouldn't that be a great motivation? How could you ever quit if you saw your achievements ticking up on the screen? I'm sure Leslie could do this--that woman can do anything!",1357344000,,1033,4.436842105263158

In each she uses the weights to help keep if fun while talking you through it.  I choose this rating because I like it more than love it there isn't too much to dislike about it I was just used to her other routines from other 2 Dvd's i bought so I guess I expected more of the same but with a twist.

4648630,4,B005BX3K80,"I have a couple other Sansone DVDs, the difference with this one is that she uses 1-3 pound weights, so it's a bit more of a workout than some of the others.  You also have the option of music only vs listening to her, and there's no group walking with her.  I like that her workouts are simple and I don't have to think too much first thing in the morning when I want a workout.  The down side of that is that they can get a little boring over time.  I use these a couple of times a week when the weather is not conducive to getting outside early in the morning, otherwise I'd much rather just go for a walk.",1355875200,,609,3.9672131147540983

I love that she uses 1,2, and 3 lb. weights.  I think this is a very intense DVD and works all parts of the body.  I like that all the miles are different.  She doesn't do the one mile and just add another mile or two onto that to make the 2 and 3 miles.  I wish she would come out with another DVD like this one.",1347926400,,483,3.5428571428571427
4648639,5,B005BX3K80,"Terrific video for beginning to intermediate exercisers. My husband and I both like this one -- I'm a beginning/intermediate exerciser, he's a beginner and rather choreographically challenged. We are both around age 40, and each have about 30-40 pounds to lose. We like exercising together, but finding videos that suit both of us is a little challenging. This video is so flexible, it's perfect for us!

The option of doing 1-mile, 2-mile, or 3-mile walks lets us tailor the video to our available time and desired intensity -- 2 or 3 miles when we want to work harder, 1 mile for a light day or a rushed morning. Within the video, Leslie consistently demonstrates both easier and more advanced moves, and gives you lots of options to do a more challenging step or stick with a more basic one. Her cuing is excellent, and she is very affirming. My husband, who has very little sense of rhythm, especially appreciates how Leslie encourages you to do the movement without worrying about whether you are in sync with her -- no counting, no worrying if your left/right is backwards from how she is demonstrating.

The weights work is invigorating, but not especially challenging. This is essentially a cardio video that gives your arms a better-than-usual workout, but isn't a substitute for a more toning-focused workout (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Debra-Mazda-ShapelyGirl-Let-s-Get-Moving-2-Cardio-Toning-w-weights/dp/B0026GDVAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Debra Mazda - ShapelyGirl: Let's Get Moving 2! Cardio Toning w/weights</a>). The plus side of this is that I am perfectly happy to do this video for any cardio workout, even if I have done more intensive weights the day before (or plan to do them the next day).

My only real disappointment is that -- although her gradual cool-down is excellent -- the stretching at the end is perfunctory. We add a longer, more thorough stretch on our own or do one of the 10-minute segments from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Total-Stretch-for-Beginners-with-Tamilee/dp/B00005N8AN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Total Stretch for Beginners with Tamilee</a>. But shortchanging the ending stretch seems to be a common problem with cardio videos; this is no worse than most -- definitely shouldn't dissuade anyone from buying this, but just be aware you'll probably want to add your own stretching, especially if this is one of your first videos on your fitness journey.

I do have to note this was my first Leslie video, so I can't address the comments other reviewers have made about whether or not it is repetitive compared to her other videos. (Those frequent complaints about Leslie's videos discouraged me from trying her earlier -- I'm sorry I waited!) But taken on its own merits, we found it to be fun, challenging, upbeat, and affirming.",1346025600,5,2882,5.513574660633484

The addition of the hand weights really does add a lot to this workout but take out the hand weights and its exactly like others.

This is probably her best complete workout. you get lower body from the walking moves, upper body with the weights and standing ab work with the alternating hands to leg lifts.

4648649,5,B005BX3K80,"First, a little background -- I started out my fitness journey with Leslie Sansone. Fast forward five years and I am now a certified personal trainer, STILL doing Leslie's DVDs! Although I've since branched out to ""hard"" stuff like kickboxing, spinning, heavy weight training, and other things, I still love Leslie's workouts. With her, I have NO EXCUSES. Sometimes I can just dread putting myself through a brutal workout, but if I put in a walk DVD I can ""trick"" myself into working out harder than I intended. Or I can take it easy. It's up to me! Leslie's workouts make it easy to get in activity EVERY DAY. Leslie's workouts are SAFE to do every day.

And that's what I love about these DVDs. They're great for any time, at any level. You get what you put into it. For example, if I feel like it, I add higher impact moves into the walks. Like on ""tap-out"" I get down very low into a squat and jump the taps from side to side, and when she says to turn I change the squats to jumping lunges. This REALLY, REALLY gets your heart rate up. I also add a hop into my double side steps, add in extra jogs, and use weights even when Leslie doesn't carry them. BUT -- sometimes I don't do any of that. Sometimes I want to walk just to burn extra calories easily or wake myself up.

Using Leslie's DVDs makes it easy to sneak in an extra burn of an average of 100 calories per mile, throughout the day! There have been days where, after my regular workout, I've actually done 5 extra miles in pieces throughout the day. That REALLY adds up. Try it! On days when you're home most of the day or all day, put in a DVD with 3-5 miles on it, start from the beginning, do a mile and pause to cool down. In the next hour or so, do a second mile. Then a third, and a fourth, and so on. It's addicting! The miles feel so good and it's such a great way to wake yourself up if you're feeling sluggish... and I'm not gonna lie -- I've been known to do the workouts BAREFOOT because I'm lazy sometimes ;-) I've also been known to mute Leslie and walk while I watch one of my favorite shows on TV. Leslie's on the laptop and my show is on the TV :)

NOW... let's get to the actual review of not just Leslie's workouts, but this particular DVD.

First of all, I love it because it has THREE WORKOUTS on it! Usually Leslie releases a DVD with just one 2-mile or 3-mile or 4-mile workout on it. Example? Walk Away Your Hips and Thighs. The Big Burn. 5k With a Twist. These DVDs have just a single workout on them. Burn Body Fat has a total of 6 miles on them, and they are GREAT miles. You could do all 6 miles if you wanted to, without having to change the DVD. I love the addition of the weights and especially in the 2-mile walk, she uses them for almost the entire workout. It really adds punch to the calorie burn for sure. And after the 3-mile walk, I am always really sweaty!! I don't really feel a burn in my muscles unless they're already sore, but using heavier weights while moving like that can be dangerous, so... but I'm happy to use the weights whether I really sculpt my arms or not because carrying 4-6 extra pounds is hard! And you burn more calories overall.

I'm not sure whether I like it better when Leslie is alone or with people. I guess it depends on what I'm doing. If I DO have her on mute, then I like her by herself. But if I'm exercising to the DVD alone, or if I am working out with a friend, I like the groups better--so we can watch and talk about the group, lol. Not in a bad way, it is just more entertaining :) I find that when Leslie is alone, the DVD doesn't get ""old"" so quick. Although they tend to feel the same after a while, I don't mind using this DVD several times a week, whereas with one that has a group, I do them less often.

This DVD also has the option that I haven't seen on any of her other workouts-- MUSIC ONLY! Great option to have. I haven't used it, because I do like Leslie's reminders and perky, positive attitude. It sometimes gets me out of a rut if I'm not feeling motivated to work out for the right reasons (health, not appearances!).

This DVD is just no frills, solid workouts, and I think the pace--and the price-- are perfect. Again, you get what you put into it, so it can be as easy or as hard as you want. You could literally jog the entire workout if you wanted to.

If you made it this far into my review, don't think about buying this DVD. Just DO IT!",1335398400,9,4406,4.133022170361727

4648653,4,B005BX3K80,"The disc offers three workouts ranging from 1 to 3 miles, and all three are good workouts in my opinion, it's just a matter of how much time you have.  The weights add a lot of challenge - she uses light ones the majority of the time, 1 to 2 pounds, but I prefer to do the whole workout with 3 pounds to really feel like I'm working out my arms.  I like the fact that it's one of the ones where Leslie is solo, I think the groups can be distracting.  However, I wish it had the timer countdown - I like knowing how much time I have left in each mile.  And she skips stretching legs entirely at the end, just does a few half-hearted arm movements, so I added on some stretching.

4648656,5,B005BX3K80,"As a full-time working mom, I prefer to work out at home in the evenings.  The treadmill gets too boring so I like to change up things with a diffent dvd each day.  Leslie Sansone is my favorite instructor. I prefer Leslie's workouts, because I'm getting a good cardio exersize without all the crazy moves and without feeling like an idiot trying to keep up.  I have a variety of her dvds, and this one is awesome.  I just got it in the mail today, and I immediately popped it in.  I have already been working on three miles WATP and went with that right away.  The use weights makes a huge difference.  Leslie is less cheesy than usual.  Towards the end her goofiness came out a bit, but not enough to be annoying.  I'm glad she's by herself because her friends can be distracting.  At the end of 3 miles, I was smiling and felt rejuvenated.  The stretch felt great at the end.  Tomorrow, I'll try the 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk that I also received today.  Enjoy, and good luck to everyone trying to stay healthy!",1332201600,3,1012,4.319148936170213
4648657,5,B005BX3K80,I am very happy with my purchase of the Leslie Sansone Burn Body Fat DVD. I already had Leslie 5 miles walk and this one has challenged me even more.  I love using the hand weights - I feel like I am getting a better work out.  I also like that you can do the music only or music and instruction.  Without a doubt this is my favorite!!!!  I have been exercising now for about 3 months - just aerobics- no weights.  This is a great addition to my collection - it is the one I will use over and over again!!,1332028800,7,505,3.911764705882353
4648658,5,B005BX3K80,"I have been a huge fan of Leslie's for many years. So, needless to say I have acquired a few of her DVD's over the years. This by far is my favorite and the one that will kick my .... the most. Using the weights as of part of the routine seems minimal with maximum results. I now use weights with a few of her other DVD's. I love that it is just her and not with her usual group of people; I feel I can focus better with just her. You can use as much or as little weights as you choose. She truly motivates me to join her daily to get back into shape. She says low metabolism and weight gain, is the lack of using muscles.........after 3 weeks with Leslie I feel stronger, so I agree. My muscles are not sore, as with other routines I have use; with this I do feel stronger through my day. You will not regret this purchase..",1332028800,4,825,3.9759036144578315
4648659,5,B005BX3K80,"I have eight of Leslie's DVDs and this is my favorite. It feels like a good workout. Definitely more challenging than her usual workouts, in a good way. The addition of the hand weights is great. But, she doesn't kill you with constant weights. She uses them on and off and even has a boost. There is also the option of working out with just the music and not her cheery chatter.",1331769600,6,379,4.277777777777778

These are my ""mild"" workouts that I use on days where I want a little cardio, but don't want to do a big, sweaty workout. This dvd is just Leslie, without any other walkers, which I don't really like, but you use hand weights throughout the whole workout (which has 1,2, and 3 mile option on one dvd), so I felt like this is one of the more intense workouts from Leslie. You can do the walks without handweights, but they really add a lot to the workout. I was more sweaty than with any other walk at home workout...which is nice! I would recommend this workout because beginners can do it without the hand weights, and more in-shape people can add 1-5 lb hand weights for a more challenging workout.",1331510400,7,772,4.405594405594406

The warm up is just right, and even with the one mile your heart rate gets going.  She alternates between weights (1, 2, and 3 lbs), or you can do the workout without weights.  The music is ok, better in this DVD than in some of her others.  I enjoy doing the 1 mile first thing in the morning before work.  It takes about 15 minutes, including the warm up.  I like that you can choose a 1, 2, or 3 mile walk depending on how much time you have or your mood.  I'm very satisfied with this workout!",1330992000,2,596,4.0

4648668,4,B005BX3K80,"Tired of the treadmill?  Tired of spending $ on memberships?  Tired of traveling to the gym?  Then buy this tape.  Firstly, Leslie is alone in this video.  After reading other reviews, I knew I would not like all the chit chat with other people.  I would rate this a 5 if Leslie's voice was a little softer.  My only unkind word about Leslie. But, she is sincere and explains all the moves and instructs on what and what not to do.  Each section does begin with warmups and ends with cooldowns.  I like that she has a 1 mile piece that is a power walk that takes only 15min.  I am doing the 2 mile walk and can feel the muscles in my back that have not been used in a while.  I like the use of small handweights which workout the upper body.  Easy to follow the steps and I think this is an excellent start for someone who has not exercised in a while. Most important:  you do not need a lot of space to follow Leslie and you are not doing any jumping around.  Like that!  I will be researching Leslie's other videos as long as the reviews don't mention the incessant chatter.  PS:  my husband is doing this walk also.  Never thought I would see the day!",1329264000,13,1154,4.144796380090498

I did mile 1 then the 2 mile segment and after that I was wiped. I also hold 2 lb hand weights which really add to the arm sculpting segments.  I like the choice of picking different workouts but only having to use one dvd.

4648673,5,B005BX3K80,"WOW!  Who knew 3 miles could make you sweat so much?  I actually bought this video for my ""easy days"" since I've been doing 4 and 5 mile dvds with Leslie for a long time, but using the weights really pumps it up!  Plus I love it when Leslie is by herself in her videos.  She is much more focused, and she stays on topic more than when she is with all of her friends.  For those of you who like it when she has a big group to chat with, this might not be the dvd for you.

Another reviewer mentioned that Leslie seems overly cautious about the weights, and that is true.  She mentions a LOT that you shouldn't swing the weights around, don't over do it, put them down if you are too tired.  It was almost a bit much, and made her look really fearful of being sued.  But overall, she was the same happy chatty Leslie that her fans know and love.

If you're looking for a way to tone up some arm muscles while you walk and to get some extra sweat time in, this might be the one for you!",1327622400,9,983,3.9441624365482233
4648674,3,B005BX3K80,"I was stuck  between a 3 and a 4 so I decided to round down.

I'll go workout by workout for clarity's sake.

Surprisingly, the 1 mile workout, I feel, was the best one. It was 15 minutes long and begins with a moderately-paced warm-up with one of my all-time favorite Leslie Sansone songs. Even in this warm-up, she has on 1-lb hand weights. A little more than 4  minutes in, it speeds up to another common song that she uses in the first mile of her 5-mile Fat-Burning walk. She uses the basic combination of side-steps (no doubles in this one), kicks and knee-lifts. The last 5 minutes ends with another song from the 4th mile of her 5-mile Fat-Burning walk that is a tad quicker and at that point, Leslie adds in a pair of 2-lb. wrist weights to make a total of 3-lbs. on each arm. The cool-down goes back to the mellow song that the walk starts with and it is only about a minute-and-a-half. Leslie does a very quick stretch (literally a few seconds) and the workout ends. Leslie is less chatty than normal on this one.

The reason that I call this mile the best one is because it follows a format that I wish Leslie would follow in all her videos. Instead of slowing down before the mile is complete (like she usually does), she carries out the fast pace through the end of the mile and then slower cool-down pace doesn't come in until the mile is complete.

On to the 2 mile workout...the warm-up stars with Leslie using the 2-lb hand weights. She goes over the basic steps and lets us know that this mile is going to offer a 15 minute mile pace. After that, Leslie speeds up with another song from the 5-mile Fat-Burning workout and almost immediately integrates the weights with overhead presses. Throughout the rest of the 1st mile, she does moves like kickbacks with a bicep curl and knee-lift series (single and double), double side-steps and ""power kicks"". She repeats that you can always put the weights down if they are too much.

The second mile begins with a song she uses in other videos to do boosted walking, although she does not boost on this workout. She presents other moves like ""tap-outs"" and bicep curls that extend into triceps kickbacks. She also notes that it is okay to slide the weights onto the forearms to give the hands a break from gripping. At the second song (my second all-time LS favorite), she takes off the 2-lb. weights and switches to 1-lb weights but notes that you can totally eradicate the use of the weights at the point if you wish. She introduces the grapevine into this section. She ends the workout with a much slower song, taking the weights away but pretty much keeping with the standard moves. She also takes the time to let the audience know that if they're fat, not to feel bad because technology helped facilitate it and to not skip meals. A little more chatty in this one. A two minute extra slow pace officially ends the 2-mile walk at around 32 minutes and then she walks a little more before the stretch.

I feel the disadvantage to this workout is the fact that it slows down so noticeably before the 2 mile mark is reached.

Lastly, the 3-mile walk...this one started out okay. She started with the 1-lb weights throughout the warm-up and lets us know the weights won't be used throughout the whole thing because it's a long workout and she wants to avoid overuse. Again, this begins with the standard at-home walking moves. She again speeds it up with a few songs from her 5-mile Fat-Burning walk (my third all-time LS favorite is the third song of the first mile) and uses moves such as the traveling side-steps and kickbacks with overhead press. The first mile is about 15:30 (although it doesn't seem like it).

In the second mile, she switches to 2-lb hand weights. The music is more brisk. She continues with the standard overhead press and kickback/bicep curl combo. Then a gospel-type song plays that is very brisk and kind of delightful. Unfortunately, that was the climax of this workout. After that, she turns to her ""boosted"" walking song from the 5-mile Fat-Burning walk. She does do a move where she is walking while doing chest presses and eventually boosts for a few seconds.

The last mile, she appears with 3-lbs. worth of hand weights on each arm. The music gets so slow, it's intolerable. Then, after about a minute-and-a-half, it speeds up to that dreadful ""Everybody"" song from 4 Fast Miles. As an aside, I can't stand that song. But, if that wasn't bad enough, every minute-and-a-half the song changes and it is a total motivation killer. I think her aim was to alternate slower songs with not as slow songs but it totally bored me to no end. I was at the point where I was wondering when it would end. This cycle goes on for about 6 or 7 songs and then she finally drifts on into the cool down. At least she ends this workout with my first all-time favorite LS song.

I felt this workout was unfortunate because up through the gospel-style song, she was on track for a good workout. Even the boosted walking song was okay but that stunt she pulled in the last mile with the bipolar DJ mix was where she went wrong for me. She does do a more substantial stretch in this one than the other two.

A plus to this overall DVD is that all workouts have a music-only option. I would probably recommend doing a hybrid of all three workouts to get the most bang for your buck. Start out with the one mile, before the cool down switch to the second mile of the three mile walk and finish with the last mile of the two mile walk.",1327449600,70,5506,4.455809334657398
4648675,1,B005BX3K80,"So disappointing! I have used her DVDs a lot over the course of the last 10 years, and I was looking forward to shaking up my routine with a fresh version. Unfortunately, this video is so poorly made that I was distracted throughout the entire routine. The transitions between moves are awkward. She doesn't count down to begin or end movements. She is caught off guard by the change in musical pace. There is no clock counting down the minutes. What you do get is a bizarre pink bar at the bottom that flashes miles and healthy phrases with a weird stripper outline commonly found on trucker's tire flaps.

Spend your money on her videos produced by Exercise TV. They are well made and challenging!",1327104000,9,699,4.592

She's a truly wonderful fitness instructor with unique motivating talk that sticks with me through my day. ""We have about 650 muscles - they aren't made to sit, they are meant to move!"" ""Walking is your sport for life!"" (I was so thrilled she gave me a sport, since I was never very athletic!) ""You are strong!"" This is my absolute favorite DVD to date. I prefer Leslie alone, not chatting with a group of walkers, as nice as they may be.  She works and tones the upper body at the same time as the legs, back and butt, using weights as well, and offers variations on her moves for all levels. Somehow, she managed to incorporate all my favorite moves in one DVD. Three miles, to me, is enough though I know she offers 4 and 5 miles in other videos. ""Walking"" 3 miles brings my heart-rate up, works me into a sweat to burn the body fat and uses the energy, as she says. I am completely satisfied with this DVD so I felt the need to write this review. I think Leslie Sansone is a real find and hope you enjoy her style as much as I do.
