2662135,4,B000ION2H6,"A new German general, a new Le Clerc (son of the old Le Clerc, played by now-deceased Jack Haig), and a new female counterfoil to Arthur Bostrom's character (the French-speaking English gendarme) join the regular cast in this installment.  Improbable schemes to return the two English airmen seem to culminate, but as usual, something goes awry at the last moment. These episodes end with another attempt at long-distance communications via a ""homing podgeon"" and a truly strange wedding ceremony between Edith's Maman and Le Clerc.",1171843200,2,532,5.258823529411765
2662136,5,B000ION2H6,"After having taped many 'Allo 'Allo episodes on VHS

years ago with tapes in poor condition with cut off beginnings and endings and flickering images, I was overjoyed to find my favorite tv program on DVD.  I have bought every series available; there is no way to say that one is better than another--they are all superb.  The only way series six excels is that it has some episodes I have never seen.

Upon receiving series six however I discovered the whole series hadn't been aired.

2662174,1,B000ION2H6,"I love the show!  My reason for the low stars is the quality of the disk.  I bought several season's to complete the collection for a Christmas present.  Unfortunately neither disk in Series Six would work. I returned it and got a refund.  I have since read many other reviews that showed that many are having the same problem.
I wonder if BBC Video has been made aware of the fact that they produced alot of bad DVD's, and should do a recall.  I would love to buy a working set, if I can ever find one.",1424563200,2,503,4.144329896907217

2662176,1,B000ION2H6,"Disc 2 does not work at all. I tried it in 2 different DVD players and both indicated that the disc cannot be read. Before ordering this I read the reviews and many others reported the same problem.  I took a chance thinking that surely the manufacturer would have taken notice and fixed it by now.  Foolish me! Fortunately, Amazon has a great return policy so I am not out any money.  It's too bad because this is a funny series and I may never know what happens to poor Rene in Series Six, Disc 2.",1413072000,,499,4.177083333333333
2662177,1,B000ION2H6,"And yes, I do mean ""defective,"" not ""detective."" This is one of my favorite TV shows. I first saw it on PBS as a kid, watching with my parents, and the whole family thought it was hilarious. I have been re-watching the series; I have all 9 seasons. Seasons 1-5 are just as laugh-out-loud funny as I remember. Yes, there is some potty humor, and quite a bit of slapstick. But watching the characters get into more and more convoluted plans (that seem far-fetched at the start and just get worse as they go) adds right in to the fun. If you're looking for high-brow, intellectual humor, look somewhere else. If you're looking for an excuse to have a ""bring your own potato party,"" however, when the potato actually has a spy camera hidden in it, you've found the right place!

So, given the glowing review and the happy memories, why the low rating? Unfortunately, I have been unable to watch Series 6 (and 7-9 are languishing because it really is best to watch them in order). I am now on my 5th order of Series 6 - 3 were returned as defective, 1 was canceled after I attempted to have the vendor verify the discs weren't defective (the seller refused to check, I took a chance and ordered anyway and they canceled the order), and one is in the mail (fingers crossed). From looking at this site and others, it does appear that the BBC put out a very large batch of defective Series 6 (in some cases it's both discs - that's what I've run into - in some cases just disc 2). They load forever and do not go to a menu or play. Eventually, they generate a general ""defective/damaged"" error, NOT a ""wrong region,"" etc. error. The three new copies I ordered previously were all this way; I'm hoping that the used copy might have better results. We'll see.

BEWARE these discs! It is entirely possible that the super-low prices reflect that the sellers (and let's be honest here, they're all resellers) got a ""super-good"" deal on these discs because they were probably defective. And most of these sellers have such large operations/remote warehousing, they couldn't play-check the discs even if they wanted to.

All I can say is, good luck. I've had worse luck playing the lottery - but not by much!

***UPDATE*** The most recent purchase seems to be non-defective. The discs will load and play. I have not yet watched them all the way through, but at least I'm running better odds than the lottery!",1412899200,10,2393,4.532407407407407
2662178,1,B000ION2H6,"Disc 2 is absolutely blank as in no data on disc. I've been through 4 of these including the defective one in the box set, and all have the disc 2 issue. I suggest trying to go through the manufacturer for resolution.",1411862400,,217,4.190476190476191

This is also the second time the second disc has been unreadable on any of my computers, dvd, or blu-ray players.  DO NOT ORDER this set until Amazon or, more probably, BBC Video fixes the issue.  I'm assuming that they have one or more bad master sets that they are duplicating.  I've got all of the other sets and have had absolutely no problem with any of them.  The series itself is incredibly funny and well worth buying.

I also had to return a Season 5 part 2 where the first disk was bad.  To verify the problem, I tried the bad disk on two different laptop DVD players.  One just spit the disk out.  The other reported ""I/O errors"" in trying to read the disk.  Evidently a batch of bad DVDs has been produced.  BBC Video needs to recall them and put out a good batch.

2662208,5,B000ION2H6,"Has the economy got you down? Have politics got your blood pressure up? Will one more idiotic ""reality"" show on TV send you round the bend?

Time for another dose of 'Allo 'Allo!--the magnificent nonsense that proves the old adage that laughter is the best medicine. And series six, like series five, four, three, two, and one, will leave you whooping with laughter, no matter how many times you have seen its variations on the same theme. The maids and Lieutenant Grueber will find the podgy Rene irresistible; Edith will sing off-key; her bed-ridden mother will complain ""Will nobody come to the aid of an old woman?""; Helga will bellow ""COME IN!""; the black-leathered Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen will hatch their fiendish plans to no avail; the chicken-helmeted (and -hearted) Capitano Bertorelli will make-a mistake-a; Michelle of the Resistance will ""say this only once;"" Sergeant Crabtree will murder the ""French"" language, and the thick-headed British airmen will still not get away from Nuvion, that small village in occupied France where everyone collaborates with everyone else (I am passing over the ""Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies"" by von Klomp and the ""Cracked Vase with the Big Daisies"" by van Gogh.).

The running gags are what make 'Allo 'Allo so much fun, and the gags in this delightful series have been running a long way for a long time. And despite the fact that the show hits all the various national and social stereotypes, the humor is good-natured; even the sexual puns and innuendo, completely lacking in subtlety, are hysterically funny and devoid of the patent crudity that infects so many ""modern"" American sitcoms.

So, in the words of Sergeant Crabtree, witch this twee-dosk sot in the oovening and you will be sure to have a good moaning the nayxt doo.",1221091200,6,1792,4.946843853820598

I was disappointed to find that when I went to order series 7, that it won't be released until September.  I guess we'll just watch all 6 series' all over again until it comes out!",1186012800,,277,4.2075471698113205
2662221,5,B000ION2H6,"Where has this been all my life?! (Or at least since the '80s.) Twenty years after this British series aired I was introduced to it by my parents. I bought the entire series for their anniversary and we proceeded to watch it from beginning-to-end over the course of about three weeks. The humor is as fresh and hilarious as the best of the best, and we were howling at the zany antics in the story lines.

Set in WWII in a French cafe owned by Ren Artois (whose stray left eye is funny all by itself), the story line throughout involves trying to smuggle two British airmen back to England. The town is occupied by Germans, who are some of Ren's best customers. Michelle, the leader of the French Resistance, appears in every episode in the cafe's back room to announce yet another cock-a-mamy plot, saying, ""Listen very carefully, for I will say this only once.""

A stolen painting called ""The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies"" is coveted by the Germans, Ren, and by Hitler himself, and Ren hides it in a knockworst sausage which hangs in his storeroom. He plans to sell it after the war to live on, but some of the German officers have the same idea. Copies are made and stuffed into more sausages, and that's only the beginning.

The Resistance installed a radio in the flooring below the bed of Ren's aging mother-in-law, and a piss-pot serves as the speaker. When they have to send a message to England they tilt up the foot of the bed, much to the protests of the mother-in-law, and Ren says into the microphone, ""'Allo, 'allo, thees ees Blackhawk speaking.""

There is a brilliant device used to differentiate French and English: the actors portraying the French speak English with a French accent, and those portraying Brits speak a form of pigeon English. A Brit impersonating a French policeman says such things as, ""Good moaning. I have bad nose."" Ren rolls his eyes and says, ""Who taught you how to speak French?""

No one is spared. The French are sex-crazy, the Germans are rigid idiots, and the Brits are complete buffoons, all making for a most entertaining series. Highly recommended!",1184198400,3,2102,4.654986522911051
