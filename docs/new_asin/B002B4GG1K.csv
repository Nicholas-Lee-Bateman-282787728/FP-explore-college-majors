8360651,1,B002B4GG1K,Made me watch it in piano class most boring experience in my life. Skits were very dumn,1441065600,,87,4.176470588235294
8360652,5,B002B4GG1K,Hilarious fun with classical music by a pair of expert musicians and actors.,1419120000,,76,4.923076923076923
8360653,4,B002B4GG1K,"Igudesman and Joo's comedy is something worth watching over and over again. If you enjoy music, and especially if you are a musician yourself, I highly recommend it.

Why four stars? The performance is top notch, but the recording quality is not that good. The video looks like it was done with a home video camera, and the audio is not much better. Until they come out with a better quality recording, though, this will have to do...",1379203200,,434,4.564102564102564
8360654,5,B002B4GG1K,"After having spent the preceeding 50 years as a musician (i.e, school band/garage band/rock and roll band/even directing the Choir at Church), I haven't been too pleased with the direction my beloved Rock and Roll has taken since Elvis' demise.  And looping over to ""country..."" NO!: like the late great Johnny Ramone says on the ""End Of The Century"" DVD when an unctous interviwer notes that Blondie achieved ""success"" by going disco with ""Heart Of Glass,"" John says, ""We still have OUR integrity.""  Yeah, brother.  Even ""country's"" close to being gone now, replaced by ""fashionable"" entities (dig Pinkard & Bowden's ""I'd Rather Hear A Fat Girl Fart Than A Pretty Boi Sing""), so, thank The Lord, Classical Music is there where it's always been.  Even so: Nothing needs to be taken ""too seriously,"" and violinist Aleksey Igudesman and pianist Richard Hyung-Ki Joo, supremely gifted classical musicians the both of them, inject a healthy irreverance into the realm of Classical Music.  If you have not witnessed their freaking BRILLIANT rendition of Mozart's ""Rondo Ala Turk,"" AKA, his ""Turkish March,"" stop reading this now and go to youtube and look it up.  See what I mean?  And ""Nightmare Music"" continues this...schtick a bit longer, captivating AND insulting Classical Music fans in Vienna.  The look of supreme annoyance on some of the audience's faces is exactly the same as when, say, oh, when Richard Bowden & Sandy Pinkard make fun, playing & ""re-interpreting"" Country Music, or my favorite band, Big Daddy ""remake/remodel"" Rock & Roll into fifties rockabilly.  This is great stuff, folks; I only regret that the afore-mentioned ""Turkish March"" isn't on ""Nightmare"" (it really IS, just another venue, another time...)  The sorely-missed Monty Python's Terry Jones says it best: ""'A Little Nightmare Music' brings surrealism to the concert hall and takes its trousers down!""  I've honestly enjoyed this music DVD more than any I've purchased since, um, ""Ladies & Gentlemen The Rolling Stones"" was all spiffed up for re-release.",1377216000,,2036,5.176829268292683
8360655,5,B002B4GG1K,Makes me want to hear them LIVE! They play live more in Europe than in the United States. But they will be in Palm Springs soon.,1365379200,,128,3.9615384615384617
8360656,3,B002B4GG1K,"I discovered Igudesman & Joo on Youtube just about three years ago, and promptly watched everything I could find on their channel.

After just happening across this on amazon last month, I decided to order it.

Much to my disappointment a good %90 of all the material on this DVD was already available to watch for free online.

Also, the included bonus material was not really worth even putting on the DVD.  All I can hope is that they'll come out with another DVD soon and keep it off youtube!

Overall, I love the content, but you can legally watch this without having to pay for it.  Making it hard to validate.",1346803200,,616,4.455357142857143
8360657,4,B002B4GG1K,"the video is really fun, classic music lovers should be cautious with this, those guys require an open mind, you can see on the video some faces that doesn't look very happy with the show, but for me they are good",1293321600,5,213,4.219512195121951
8360658,5,B002B4GG1K,"Saw them live and bought the DVD, it's the next best thing to seeing them live. I&J are not only amazing musicians, but gifted performers making their show a feast for the ears, eyes and funny bone :D",1269216000,13,200,4.2894736842105265
