8075939,4,B000A7QB06,"This instructional video on rope splices is the best I've found so far.
However, it could be better.
At various points in the video the instructor refers to a rope's end but the videographer does not show which end is being referred to. Perhaps it is supposed to be obvious, but it wasn't to me and would have been helpful to ""show"" which end was being referred to.
Also, regarding the double braid splice, halfway through the instruction the instructor says, ""Oh, if you were intending to include a snap shackle, it's too late, that had to be done at the beginning."" My question is this, why not re-record that portion to ""show"" where, and at what stage, the snap shackle should be installed?",1274918400,,693,4.596774193548387

Very professional camera work and lighting, good audio, and several examples done from the viewer's perspective.  I can't wait to try doing my own eye splices in double braided rope.",1141344000,,278,5.021739130434782
