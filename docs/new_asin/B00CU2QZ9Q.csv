8586290,2,B00CU2QZ9Q,"Harodim is not a thriller, although that's what the artwork makes it look like.  It's barely even a movie in terms of storytelling--it's basically a lecture explaining the beliefs of 9/11 Truthers disguised only just barely as a paranoia thriller, likely because the minor fictional trappings seemed like a way to reach a wider audience than a crackpot documentary.

The film opens with an American soldier who faked his own death named Lazarus Fell who has captured the world's most wanted terrorist, a man billed only as Terrorist who is Osama Bin Laden in everything but name.  Lazarus plans to kill the terrorist to avenge his father's death in the 9/11 attacks but for reasons that are never clear allows him to tell his story first.  The terrorist (Michael Desante playing Osama Bin Laden as the measured voice of reason) claims US security services were actually the ones behind the destruction of the Twin Towers--anyone with a passing knowledge of 9/11 Truther beliefs is already familiar with everything the terrorist is going to say.  Harodim makes only a minimal effort to present the information as dialogue and includes lots of rapid cutting to snippets of actual news footage both to help the conspiracy theory seem more credible and also to make what is little more than a monologue of 9/11 Truther theories seem more cinematic than it actually is.

The second half switches POV, bringing in Peter Fonda as Solomon Fell, the father of Lazarus (the biblical names are obviously not an accident) who supposedly died when the Twin Towers collapsed.  Surprise--he isn't dead.  Solomon explains the New World Order Conspiracy which is where the national security apparatus has us headed in the big picture conspiracy of which 9/11 and the war on terror are just a small part.  This involves bringing about the collapse of individual nation states and the controlled use of war and man-made disaster in order to bring the global population down to a manageable level so the human race can survive and avoid destroying the planet.

Like the Osama Bin Laden character in the first half Peter Fonda's Solomon in the second presents what is little more than a lecture and the filmmakers make a minimal effort to punctuate Fonda's lengthy exposition speech with occasional reactions from his son or the terrorist to make it feel a bit more like dialogue.  As frustrating and obviously problematic as the script for Harodim is I have to admit that Peter Fonda does an exceptional job of selling his part of it, embodying the paranoid fantasy of the man who meticulously plans and orchestrates not-what-they-seem events from behind the scenes.  Peter Fonda's Solomon bears the weight of the terrible decisions he believes are necessary to ensure the survival of the human race and he manages to make his character's perspective seem almost alarmingly reasonable.

Unfortunately Harodim never even comes close to working as entertainment or for that matter as a narrative film.  The Parallax View was a classic paranoia thriller inspired by John F Kennedy assassination theories but there was a layer of fiction between the events in movie and reality that allowed it to function as an entertaining thriller.  Harodim, on the other hand, presents completely unadulterated conspiracy theories about actual events and implicates real people.  Since there is no layer of fiction between Harodim and real people and events the movie can't really function as anything but a mouthpiece for conspiracy theories that have already been meticulously debunked.  Anyone looking for thrills should stay clear of Harodim but people with an open mind for conspiracy might find some of this engaging--just keep in mind that Harodim only presents one side of the story and that a quick Internet search of any of the conspiracies suggested in the film will turn up detailed attempts to debunk those very same theories.

Presumably Harodim hasn't been released in the United States in the three years since it was made because of the distasteful presentation of Osama Bin Laden as a fundamentally good man set up to be a fall guy by the CIA and members of his own family with longstanding business and personal ties to the family of President George W Bush.  Or maybe it's a conspiracy to keep the truth from American audiences.  Or maybe it's just a flat-out crap movie that nobody wanted to release--if you manage to track down a copy that is something you will need to decide for yourself.",1425772800,2,4475,4.97319034852547

This is a three man play involving Lazarus Fell (Travis Fimmel), a Seal Team 6 member who faked his own death to pursue Bin Laden (Michael Desante) on his own. Lazarus' father Solomon (Peter Fonda) died in the 9-11 attack, although his body was never found.

The film consists mostly of an interview/interrogation of Bin Laden by Lazarus. He is informed that Al Qaida was created by the CIA and Bin Laden was a reluctant puppet. The movie uses certain facts to drive the point home such as the shorting of airline stocks prior to 9-11 and the Bush's family business connections to the Bin laden family.

Politically, this ""truther"" conspiracy theory is so far to the left and right, it is off the charts. The production and information did nothing to convince me that our own country order the attacks on itself in order to create an enemy for the military industrial complex to keep operating. This is Michael Moore's ""Canadian Bacon"" theory without the humor or entertainment.

I found the presentation of the material dry and boring. It essentially asks the viewer to go ""look it up"" and draw your own conclusions. Lazarus represents the skeptic in all of us. Unless you are into 9-11 conspiracy theories, you won't find much entertainment in this film.

Do the rich and powerful need to conceal their intent of world domination? Seriously. They already dominate the world, that is why they are rich and powerful.
