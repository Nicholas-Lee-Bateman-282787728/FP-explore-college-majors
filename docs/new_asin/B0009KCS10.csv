8062591,5,B0009KCS10,"I love this DVD.  The tunes are beautiful.  Norman Blake uses them to teach techniques that range from advanced beginner to intermediate.  These are not the same old fiddle tunes everybody knows (those are great too, of course, but it's nice to learn some new ones).  Best of all for someone of middling skills like me, Blake doesn't burn through these at insane bluegrass tempos, so it's possible to learn them and then play along with Norman and Nancy at their full tempo.  If you are ready to keep up with Sam Bush or Chris Thile, that might be boring for you.  But if you are a mere mortal this will give you a great sense of accomplishment, especially since nothing sounds artificially slowed down or simple--these arrangements and tempos all sound great.",1459728000,,760,4.676691729323308
