678806,2,6303523072,"Barefoot Gen is based on a famous award winning japanese comic book.  Frankly you're better to read the original than sit through this sentimentalized and trite offering.  While there are moments of spectacle (the bombing and the horrific aftermath), it's basicaly a ""good feeling"" movie set in Hiroshima.
While it might've been worth renting, it's definitly not a ""must have"".  Much better you spend your cash on the masterpiece ""Grave Of the Fireflies"".
The DVD includes some liner notes but no additional information.  The picture quality is fine -- no particular problems.",996537600,6,576,5.228260869565218
678807,4,6303523072,"Few animated films can be comfortablly labeled ""important"".  Mamoru Shinzaki's ""Barefoot Gen"" is, without a doubt, one of these films.  Based on Keiji Nakazawa's poignant graphic novel, the film tells the story of a family and how their lives are affected by the atomic bomb dropped on Hisroshima in 1945.  Shinzaki perfectly adapts Nakazawa's somewhat akward style of drawing and adds dimension to these already strong characterizations.  The animation is a bit on the stiff side.  The style of animation looks a bit like what we stereotypically think of when picturing anime.  While there are moments of great beauty and grace (mostly in the film's backgrounds), the animation is closer to Speed Racer than Princess Mononoke.  The film elegantly re-tells Gen's tragic story of survival, streamlining the narative for the big screen.  Missing from the film are several charming vignettes as well as two of Gen's brothers.  Focusing mainly on Gen and his actions and responses, the film loses some of the comic's political vigor but retains a strong voice against war.  Never is the film anti-American.  It matter of factly cries out against the pointlessness of war.  It is mainly through the horrors witnessed in uncompromising graphic detail (even more so in the comic) that this message is most vivid.  And yet Barefoot Gen is ultimately a story of survival.  Gen is a hero and his actions speak of the amazing potential of the human spirit when faced with the unspeakable.  The only thing you will be longing for after the film's somber closing is more.  Like ""Grave of the Fireflies"", ""Barefoot Gen"" is more than worthy of a spot in any collector's library.",983232000,19,1663,4.992727272727273
678808,5,6303523072,"I think it is important that many people, not just anime fans, see this movie!
Barefoot Gen, like Grave of the Fireflies, left me deeply impressed. Before I saw this one, the dropping of the atomic bomb on  Hiroshima was just a date I remembered from my history books.
I don't  think anyone can *ever* convey what it was like, but I think this movie  makes a good attempt.",956620800,,372,4.36231884057971
678809,3,6303523072,"If you found Grave of the Fireflies difficult to watch, Barefoot Gen will be even more difficult. Although it shares similar WWII themes, Gen lacks the sensitivity that you see in Grave. The imagery in Gen is simply  horrific -- the most disturbing that I have ever seen in an animation. But  since it is about the Hiroshima bombing, I guess it would be considered  accurate and is therefore effectively disturbing. It should be noted that  the quality of the animation is not even close to Grave of the Fireflies.  So I would not recommend this to those searching for something in league  with Grave. It is definitely not for young children. Although older  children *might* watch this under adult supervision in some sort of  educational environment. In terms of content, this film is more in league  with Saving Private Ryan or Shindler's List.
DVD anime fans should be  aware that the subtitles in the film are very difficult to read. They are  *bright purple* with blue outlines, but there is transparent space in  between the purple and the blue. This makes it especially hard to read on  brighter backgrounds. There is no option to turn the subtitles off unless  you watch it in English. Therefore I would only recommend this DVD to those  looking for an English dubbed version.",950745600,2,1285,4.777272727272727

7849972,5,6303523072,"Not everyone has the where with all to purchase the entire Manga (?) series from which this film is drawn.  Several years ago, I was substitute teaching in a HS chemistry class full of privileged white kids who never had to worry about anything more important than what they would be doing on Friday night (personal observation).  I chucked the lesson plans and brought in the VHS tape and showed it over 2 or 3 days depending on length of the class.  Later, I was chastised (deservedly so) for not following the lesson plans, however for a few years afterward students that had been in one of those classes would stop and tell me how moved they had been to see this film.  Animation can show the horrors of an atomic bomb (flesh being blown from a body, an entire body being vaporized) and its after effects without grossness of SPFX that would need to be accomplished if it were done in live action.  One may say it is over sentimentalized, however, exactly how far back does the dial need to be set when showing the burning to death of a family.  Excellent anti-war story.  BIG QUESTION:  WHY ISN'T THIS AVAILABLE ON DVD OR BLU-RAY AT A RESONABLE PRICE?",1451260800,3,1156,4.497607655502392
7849973,5,6303523072,"When discussions of the greatest war films come up, Barefoot Gen should be in those discussions if not for anything other than the human dimension of the war from the perspective of innocent civilians caught in the crossfire.

Barefoot Gen is Keiji Nakazawa's semi-autobiographical account of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in the morning hours of the year 1945. The film is described through the eyes of Keiji's childhood alter ego, an 11 year old boy named Ken who loses most of his family in the the bombing and through whom we witness the horrors of this holocaust from a personal perspective, beginning with the death of his family and his indomitable spirit and determination to overcome at all costs and to care for his mother and newborn sister.

Although this is a cartoon, I strongly urge parents to view this with their children. There are many brutal scenes in this film. Also, keep a box of Kleenex handy because if you have anything beating inside your chest, male or female, you will cry. I've seen this film many times and the emotional power of this film is as palpable as the first time. At times it can be unbearable but that's not to say that this is an altogether depressing film. Gen is one of those characters that you'll remember. There are just some people, though rare, who can maintain their self dignity and positive outlook in any situation no matter how bad and this perfectly describes Gen. The power of effective storytelling in full effect here. The animation is extremely crude, even primitive, by today's standards. It does not matter at all. I challenge anyone seeing this extraordinary film to find any film, animated or live in the past 10 years, that affected them as deeply as this film. True Japanese animation.",1321401600,2,1753,4.7631578947368425

7849976,4,6303523072,"I expected to see some deamons, naked girls, blood, hear profanity but Barefoot Gen has none of those things. It deals with a 6 year old kid back in World War 2 when a big bomb hit japan killing most of his family. Gen was on his way back from school one day and saw ruining building from the blast. That's about all I will give away.",1118448000,,334,4.0
7849977,4,6303523072,"I saw Barefoot Gen recently and I must say, this is truly the most disturbing anime I've ever seen. I am a big fan of Studio Ghibli's ""Grave of the Fireflies"" so when I saw the reviews for this I wanted to see if it would live up to Fireflies. Well I must say it's a good contest. While this movie isn't dead serious the whole way through like Fireflies, it does get very serious when the bomb drops on Hiroshima.(Try to imagine a bomb dropping halfway through My Neighbor Totoro) Let's get on with the technical stuff. The Audio quality is about as good as the next film from the early 90's. Streamline updated a few of the soundeffects such as puching and what not. The sound is alright. The Music is pretty basic and nothing special. The video quality is also pretty basic aswell. I was pretty upset that the film is still not availible in widescreen like it should be. I don't know what kind of people they think are going to watch this movie, but these days to not release a movie in widescreen or at least give you an option is just plain rediculous. Overall I'm truly at a lost for words at this point. I just can't get over the incredably disturbing images shown that were so graphic I'd rather not describe them and at the same time highlight the lightheartedness of the some of the scenes. I recomend this movie anyone. Everyone should see it at least once.",1065225600,3,1367,4.364705882352941
7849978,4,6303523072,"I recently watched Barefoot Gen and some of the imagery is still sticking with me.
I'll avoid a plot summary and cover the highlights.
The Story
A great story with two important messages.  Barefoot Gen depicts, rather gruesomely, the horrors of a nuclear blast.  With our current President considering expanding tactical nuclear weapons programs, its story still hits disturbingly close to home.
The other message is more personal, told in the story of a boy named Gen and how the blast affects his family.  Oftentimes touching, sometimes downright depressing, Gen's story often worked me to tears.  The resounding message is that bad times pass and that a person's strength is enough to last through the worst.
The Sound
This is the worst part of the movie.  The sound is not at all effective, sometimes sounding like a soap opera or game show.  It can often detract from the somber tone of the movie.
The dubbing is sub-par, especially the voice of Gen, he has the exact same voice of any boy in any anime in the history of mankind.  You know the one, that scratchy, arrogant, annoying voice.  I wish that someone would re-score this movie; it would definitely take it up a notch and add to its effectiveness.
The Animation
The animation in this movie is quite inconsistent.  At times, it achieves a dramatic cinematic style with moving camera angles and stunning, fluid movement.  At other times, the slapstick seemed kind of inappropriate, and fulfills the stereotype of Japanese Animation set by Robotech and the like.  To add to this, it occasionally suffers from the animation trick where only the mouth moves and while the body remains perfectly still.  If you would like to see a Japanese movie that earns its merits from compelling animation, I suggest Akira or Princess Mononoke.
Despite its shortcomings, I still definitely recommend Barefoot Gen; it's a beautiful story and a chilling reminder of an epic tragedy that is too often forgotten.",1064707200,2,1954,4.923780487804878
7849979,5,6303523072,"While there are moments of spectacle (the bombing and the horrific aftermath), it's basicaly a ""good feeling"" movie set in Hiroshima.
_______________
I don't know how this person could get a feel good idea from this anime but I think he should seriously go back and watch it again. This isn't a ""feel good"" anime by any stretch. It is however brilliant, a tribute to the man who's life story brought it forth. The first time I saw it back in 1986 in Japan I turned it off, it was that powerful.
It blames no side, it takes no stand for the weak policy of victimhood now running rampent in Japanese schools, it lays bare the horror of that era of warfare for all to see in the hopes we shall never visit that era again.
It is a true magnum Opus of Anime and I think everyone should watch it.",1054252800,19,790,4.23841059602649
