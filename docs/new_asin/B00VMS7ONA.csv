7098659,5,B00VMS7ONA,"Great, entertaining movie!  I had never heard of ' Eat with Me '....but I am sure glad that I took my chances on it.  It is a very entertaining, well acted Gay themed movie, and we know those are hard to stumble upon very often.  The cast and story line shine through. Enjoy,,,you will not be sorry.",1432684800,5,299,4.2105263157894735

7098663,3,B00VMS7ONA,"It is always refreshing to see Asian stories dealing with the clash between gay individuals, ancient traditions and values and evolving human self-determination. This film posits that these elements, though difficult to reconcile, need not be exclusively compartmentalized. Though it is not easy, the result can be well worth the effort and in the end strengthen familial, community, and individual growth. The title of this film is somewhat interesting in that the characters always seem to bond around food rituals, which tend to have an ameliorative effect by their very nature. Pacing tends to be a little slow and some of the devices used to propel the action seem a little contrived, but the characters ulitimately face their demons and each other and enjoy a tasty dish or two along the way. What more could ask of good food!",1431648000,2,832,4.9928057553956835
7098674,5,B00VMS7ONA,amazing movie - some oddball production choices but made sense in the terms of consumer value. I invited my mother to watch it and she was touched by the film. She teared up a little at how much she identified with the mother in a couple scenes - so big props to the writer.,1470787200,,274,4.092592592592593
7098675,5,B00VMS7ONA,"If you like to see grown-ass men being awkward and flirty with each other while one of them deals with the generational divide between himself and his parents who can't accept that he's gay, definitely check this out. It's very funny and no one dies!",1461542400,,250,4.5777777777777775
7098676,5,B00VMS7ONA,Fantastic movie.  Loved watching it over and over.  I'm Asian and this movie fit the bill.,1460851200,,90,4.5625
7098677,4,B00VMS7ONA,"A nice movie, somewhat slow moving, but a nice story. Acting isn't bad. I enjoyed it, but wanted more, so only 4 stars.",1460419200,,119,4.217391304347826
7098678,3,B00VMS7ONA,"Sweet intentions, great cast pretty much, but the script and the snails-pace script fails them. The sloooooooooowest dialogue in history. Did I say slow? Yes, it was so very slow. So slow in fact you can kinda mind-read what they're thinking in advance of the syllables taking forever to come out of their mouths. In fact, if anybody moved quickly in this film it might break something. The lead actress was about all that redeemed it, but even she was undermined by the pace - in fact, a few times I thought this was an old super 8mm movie that got stuck in the projector - while waiting for something to happen. I know: you should rent this in summertime, therefore you have a slight chance of insects flying in front of the screen which may help move things along.",1458950400,,767,4.485714285714286
7098679,4,B00VMS7ONA,I was really surprised by this movie. The acting was very strong and the story/concept was interesting and fully realized. It wasn't a typical Hollywood ending and very enjoyable to watch.,1453248000,,188,5.096774193548387

7098682,5,B00VMS7ONA,"This is one fantastic film...one of the best I've seen in years!  The plot is refreshing and the acting is nothing short of superb.  I also liked the idea that it's a gay-themed story that's not all in-your-face about it; instead, it's a funny, touching film about family issues where a couple of the characters just happen to be gay.  This film is both laugh-out-loud hilarious and tears-inducing poignant...I don't think I could have enjoyed it more.  While the acting of the entire cast was excellent, the person who really stood out and, let's face it, stole the show was Elliot's mom played by Sharon Omi.  Her acting was nothing short of brilliant, plus she had an incredible way of drawing you in...making you wish that you knew someone just like her.  Amazing.  I can understand why this film won all the awards that it did; it's one that I plan to watch over and over.",1448496000,,877,4.583333333333333

7098699,4,B00VMS7ONA,This well-written and acted movie is a compact story to itself and does not overreach into any number of by-paths that would have ruined the narrative. The celebrity cachet of George Takei helps but is really just a garnish on what is already a well-blanced confection.,1443139200,,269,4.869565217391305
7098700,4,B00VMS7ONA,"Only give it four stars because the acting was great, but the movie was sort of slow.....",1442966400,,89,4.294117647058823

7098702,5,B00VMS7ONA,"This story is about the midlife awakening of a mature Asian mother to worlds other than her own.  While it is not a phenomenal motvie, it is a good one with generounderstaus amounts of humor and several memorable characters.  The  man to man romance is understated and almost an annoyance but otherwise the story works.",1440806400,,319,4.763636363636364

7098714,4,B00VMS7ONA,An elegant movie of Ang Lee type austerity.  The two male leads are gorgeous together and acted their parts with great sincerity. What is interesting about this film is that the mother who is struggling to come to terms with her son's sexuality could have been any mother.  This film goes beyond its Asian-American underpinnings to tell a story that everyone can relate to. Isn't that the beauty of stepping past racial profiling? We learn more about ourselves in the process.  Bravo for this unpretentious movie!,1440115200,,513,4.941860465116279

7098719,4,B00VMS7ONA,"I loved this movie.  The restaurant foreclosure scenes were a tad overblown, but everything else, from the comedic scenes between Sharon Omi and Nicole Sullivan to the main romantic relationship, was perfect",1438905600,,207,5.46875

7098723,5,B00VMS7ONA,"This movie REALLY impressed me. I've seen many movies about estranged parents and children reconnecting and learning to accept their differences, but this movie tells it in a ""magical"" way The whole cast is excellent, the lead actress playing the mom - SHARON OMI - is a joy to watch and GEORGE TAKEI has a fun cameo. I sat down to watch this movie with no expectations and I was very touched by it, Great atmosphere and soundtrack - plus it takes place and it was shot in my hometown: Los Angeles. I totally recommend it",1437436800,,521,4.4375
7098734,5,B00VMS7ONA,This was a really original movie. I really enjoyed it. There were a lot of surprises in it. I definitely recommend it.,1437436800,,118,4.409090909090909
7098735,5,B00VMS7ONA,"LGBT films can be disappointing: all too often they string one-dimensional characters along tired story lines. Eat With Me from director David Au was a pleasant surprise: yes, the themes of Asian and LGBT identity are given more than lip-service but at the heart of the film are very human characters wrestling with universal demons. The measured dialogue gave depth to the family and personal drama while comic relief via Nicole Sullivan (MADtv) made the film avoid the pitfalls of melodrama. The cameo from George Takei was an unexpected bonus. In short, a great genre-defying film showcasing new and established talent.",1437436800,,622,5.1683168316831685
7098736,4,B00VMS7ONA,"The movie was a cute, family friendly, dramedy, I quite enjoyed it. I particularly liked the performance of actress Sharon Omi. Her character was very relatable and sympathetic as she struggled to come to terms with her son and the course of her own life.",1437004800,,255,4.688888888888889

7098739,5,B00VMS7ONA,"Wonderful, charming, and culturally relevant. Gay Chinese men have a challenge ahead of them beyond just Judeo-Christian beliefs; familial bonds and culture is stagnant for thousands of years, being gay has always been a hidden fact, a taboo, and hardly acceptable.

I like the way the director approached his subject and went about crafting the story around it. Well worth a good viewing.

Also, George Takei guest stars, it is so sweet to see him!",1435449600,2,449,4.973333333333334
7098740,4,B00VMS7ONA,Heart warming and mostly nicely done.  Better than the average fare of gay themed films available for Instant download.,1435363200,,119,5.2631578947368425
7098741,5,B00VMS7ONA,"This one reminded me of some of Ang Lee's early films. The script is quite strong, although I don't know why George Takei is in it beyond his celebrity. Elliott is an interesting character and Teddy Chen Culver brings out his charm as well as his hangups. It's a challenge to play such an emotionally constipated character, but Chen Culver succeeds. His good looks certainly don't hurt. Sharon Omi is also excellent. The film parallels effectively the separate flourishing of mother and son as well as the deepening of their relationship. Well worth seeing.",1435363200,6,557,4.9361702127659575
7098742,4,B00VMS7ONA,Nice movie with good acting. Loved seeing George.,1434412800,,49,5.25
7098743,4,B00VMS7ONA,"I watched this on Amazon, and I hope it plays in theaters soon. It is a recent film (made in 2014) and, like a lot of films with good acting, good photography and good writing, it is under the radar.
It is a comedy of the feel-good sort, so if you're looking for satire, you won't find that. There is drama here, of course, but not a searing indictment of society.
What makes this different is its atmosphere of pathos. Sharon Omi, as Emma, a conventional mother trying to re-connect with the gay son she has rejected, is a wonder.
The cast is uniformly excellent. Ken Narasaki as Ray, Emma's indifferent husband, gives realism to what could have been a thankless role. Nicole Sullivan adds vibrancy to her role as someone who brings people out of their shells.
The gay theme is put in relief by its observation of culture clash. Emma, her husband and son (Elliot) are Asian-American. Elliot is dating an English rocker, and the focal point of the contrasts and changes is the makeover Ian's Chinese restaurant is getting, as Western foods are being introduced to the menu.
This could have been a zany movie, but it is guided by a level hand. David Au's direction never allows it to be silly.
George Takei's cameo as himself works.
All in all, what looks so easy in this film is the result of dedication to craft. I recommend it to anyone who admires good movie-making and who doesn't rule out a brighter future.",1433980800,5,1412,4.541176470588235
7098754,3,B00VMS7ONA,Entertaining with a happy ending. It's worth watching. The acting is good and the story line flows.,1433894400,,99,4.882352941176471
7098755,5,B00VMS7ONA,"Loved the movie. It was light, funny and romantic at the same time. Would recommend it.",1433721600,2,87,4.5
7098756,2,B00VMS7ONA,"To be honest, i was a bit disappointed by the plot. While the team seems market the movie as another foodie movie, I find the foodie element very weak and banal; i don't quite understand how the son can achieve any sort of refinement for his cooking all of a sudden. The transition at the end seems like a stretch to me (only because he stole his mom's dumpling recipe?). If it is part of the director's intention to portray a double-edged bildungsroman (mom becoming more accepting/ son becoming more refined as a cook), the plot leaves considerable room for improvement.",1433462400,3,572,4.673267326732673
7098757,3,B00VMS7ONA,"With such an engaging cast and a relatively lively script, I wanted to like this movie much more than I did.  But the whole premise of the film - a mother trying to accept her gay son -- is so out of date.  It felt like this mother must have been living under a rock for the last 30 years.  Maybe if the story had been set in the 80s or in Idaho, instead of contemporary, ultra-hip downtown LA, it might have worked better.  And the food angle seemed more an after-thought than essential to the narrative.  So, yes, not a bad movie, just way out of date.  We need better efforts from our gay filmmakers.",1433376000,2,603,4.155172413793103
7098758,5,B00VMS7ONA,Great film! Poignant and uplifting. Definitely worth the watch!,1433203200,,63,6.111111111111111
7098759,4,B00VMS7ONA,"When I randomly come across an obscure movie I have never heard of that actually ends up being good, always some how seems to increase my over all enjoyment of a film. This one was no exception. A little slow at times. However, I think did a good job of subtley bringing up a variety of matters about going through life and trying to cope and adjust to a reality that we might not have wanted or had intended, despite our best efforts. While learning that change is neccesary for growth, harmony and prosperity along the way. Great reminder of the bond between mother and child, although mom's may not always understand or accept things about their childrens lives, most never stop trying to and still giving love all the same. I'm a sucker for a happy ending, so I enjoyed the picture. Plus the cameo of George Takai as himself playing the Gay yoda sage to mom... 4 stars.",1433116800,,873,4.4625
