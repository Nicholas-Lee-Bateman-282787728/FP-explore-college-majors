2615570,5,B000GNOSCW,"I loved this movie: Jason Lee, just has bad lick until almost the end movie. Just a great movie to watch.",1207958400,,105,4.0476190476190474
2615571,4,B000GNOSCW,"So you're a big fan of Crispin Glover, especially in his wilder and more eccentric roles. And you like Jason Lee.

But... this sounds like it could be a really dumb, banal comedy. And the reviews aren't so hot. So should you bother with it?

That's what I was mulling over before I finally bit the bullet and rented it. And I'm glad I did.

First and foremost, Glover and Lee are fantastic. They carry the movie. They're in top form here, and they create two wonderful bozo characters.

There is some very funny material, and some great, even classic, lines. I laughed out loud several times. And the story zips right along, doesn't get tedious or slow.

Having said that, it's a pretty conventional, routine storyline, despite many detours into inspired craziness. And some of it is kinda dumb or obvious.

This isn't risky or edgy material. But it is fun, funny viewing, with outstanding weirdo performances by Glover and Lee.",1202688000,,928,4.697530864197531
2615572,3,B000GNOSCW,"This movie features Crispin Glover (an undertaker) and Jason Lee (an unemployed used car salesman) as two smalltime crooks looking to make a big score to get out of a small town in texas, and get to big time las vegas.  Sure enough, these two have all the man power, but non of the luck and brains to get it done...or are they being under estimated.  There is a lot of dark humor, and has several funny moments, but just not a consistent flow.  This could have been more, but wasn't.  Good to watch once, but then return it for others to see.",1177632000,2,542,4.233009708737864
2615573,2,B000GNOSCW,"Jason Lee and Crispin Glover play two small-time crooks in a small-time Texas town (that looks remarkably like Austin). They dig up a dead woman to steal her necklace and end up ""kidnapping"" her and holding her for ransom from her husband. Supposedly, hilarity ensues, but I must have missed that part.

Crispin Glover creates a very believable, original, and funny small-town hick, but it feels like Jason Lee isn't even trying, and the movie definitely suffers from that.

There's a good amount of gratuitous nudity in several scenes that take place in the local strip club (The Mean-Eyed Pussy Cat) and even in the morgue. If you're looking for nudity go for this movie. If you're looking for anything else, don't bother.

Overall this movie moves along slowly and without too many laughs. I checked it out because it was filmed in Austin and I was interested, but it's really not worth the time.",1166745600,5,899,4.787096774193548
2615574,3,B000GNOSCW,"This is a cross between a fun-loving NATIONAL LAMPOON party flick and a black comedy.  I'm still un-decided exactly where it fits in between the two.  The story is certainly an interesting concept, albeit creepy.  Melissa Keller is certainly sexy and the few sequences where she is ""alive"" are quite memorable.  However, these scenes could have been done better, if you ask me.

If you're into comedies about people who brush up against the mob (or mobster-like characters), this one might be worth a watch.  If you have a morbid sense of humor this one might also be worth checking out.",1163030400,6,587,4.762376237623762
2615575,4,B000GNOSCW,"This movie is decent, not Crispin Glover or Jason Lee's best but it's good.",1159401600,4,75,4.428571428571429
2615576,2,B000GNOSCW,"It seems like Drop Dead Sexy started out with an interesting idea for a dark comedy, but ran aground somewhere in the writing process. The plot holes, awkward characters, and rather thin resolution make me wonder if money ran out somewhere along the way and the script was hastily finished and/or doctored up to get the movie released quickly.

Jason Lee is surprisingly flat as the main character. I am guessing the problem is, again, more in the writing than the actor since Lee is doing a great job playing another hapless loser in My Name Is Earl. Crispin Glover was probably the only consistently funny character in the movie (and is really the only reason I give this movie any stars at all). His innate awkwardness lends a special humor to a role that could have otherwise been played as the naive idiot sidekick.

Drop Dead Sexy isn't without its funny moments, most coming from the interactions between Lee and Glover, but it does suffer from lowbrow humor (e.g. the running joke about a gay biker named Tiny) that actually feels like an afterthought. In better hands this could have been a great dark comedy and possibly a cult classic, but instead it will probably languish as a trashy comedy stuck next to Dorm Daze in the local Blockbuster.",1158278400,6,1253,4.6909090909090905

2615582,1,B000GNOSCW,"The story isn't very interesting and just about the worse movie I have ever seen. I like Jason Lee from other shows and movies, but this one he was just average. I don't like Crispin Glover character and I think he was weird. All I liked about this movie were the HOT girls. But even that didn't save this movie from a 1 star review.",1316217600,,333,4.138461538461539
2615583,5,B000GNOSCW,"This movie is a dark comedy.  It is funny, and it stars Jason Lee (My name is Earl, Memphis Beat) and Spider, one of the bad guys, is played by charactor actor Pruitt Taylor Vince, who is so good in any role he takes on.  (Most recently LaRoche on the Mentalist, also Heavy, Legend of 1900, too many other roles to list.) It was worth it to my family to buy it and spend an evening watching.",1313280000,3,391,4.064935064935065
2615584,2,B000GNOSCW,"Even though I'm a big Jason Lee fan, I've been avoiding this movie. I find its premise offensive. Well, Lionsgate has put the entire movie on YouTube. You can watch the whole thing for free, all in one shot. So I finally couldn't resist.

It's a little more interesting and funny than I expected. I especially like Crispin Glover as Eddie, the dim, kind-hearted gravedigger who really doesn't want any part of his buddy Frank's schemes. When Frank (Jason Lee) messes up a job he's doing for a very bad guy named Spider (Pruitt Taylor Vince), he needs to come up with $250K to pay him back. He decides to dig up the body of a beautiful rich woman to steal and sell a necklace she was wearing. This being a comedy, Eddie and Frank are unable to put the body back in the grave, so they're stuck with her.

Frank decides to make the most of the situation by asking her husband for ransom. The scheme looks like it might work, and meanwhile, some interesting connections show up between the woman and Spider.

The movie is offensive partly because of the treatment of the deceased woman but also because of the treatment of women in general. Almost all the women are strippers or otherwise sex objects. Glover's Eddie gives the film its heart and even a moral compass as he genuinely likes the strippers he frequently visits and he's also protective of the body he and Frank have kidnapped, trying to treat it with more respect than Frank does. In fact, if it weren't for Eddie, I'm not sure I could have sat through the movie.

I hate to say it, but much as I love Jason Lee, I think he was the weak link in this movie. His Frank basically yells his lines at Eddie, coming across something like an immature Brodie from ""Mallrats,"" when something more along the lines of his Azrael from ""Dogma"" would have been more appropriate. I'm sure he could have created an interesting character, the kind of guy who is sleazy enough to think nothing of digging up a body while being interesting and even a bit likeable. But I never really bought his character as the kind of guy who would do a job for a guy like Spider or think nothing of digging up a body to make money (Frank doesn't seem to think it's a big deal and gives Eddie a hard time when he objects).

But if you're still wanting to spend your money on this, just look it up on YouTube and save yourself a few bucks.",1312070400,,2363,4.373576309794989
2615585,4,B000GNOSCW,I bought this movie to add to my Crispin Glover movie collection. I thought that it had a few good laughs in it and very likable main characters. Both Crispin Glover and Jason Lee were great-but Crispin carried it for sure. It was a little dark but not over the top. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting and kinda cute movie night movie. Four stars.,1283212800,,370,4.3768115942028984
2615586,1,B000GNOSCW,"A friend recommended this movie to me, but I can't say the same. The online reviews kind of make it out to be a black comedy like 'Fargo' (did these people even see that movie??). But it's really just a poorly written/directed rip-off of 'Weekend At Bernies'. Turned it off after a half-hour.",1244505600,,292,4.528301886792453

8133653,4,B000GNOSCW,"Frank (Jason Lee) and Eddie (Crispin Glover) are two guys in Texas looking for the big score that'll set them up for life. They're in some trouble, though; they recently screwed up a cigarette-smuggling trip to Mexico and now owe $250,000 to the mobster who hired them, so they need to raise the money pronto. One day, they read about the tragic drowning of a society beauty, Crystal Harkness (Melissa Keller) in the local newspaper, and decide to relieve her of the fancy jewelry she'll never need again. So they go down to the cemetery that night, exhume her casket, and find that lovely Crystal is, in fact, not wearing any jewelry. What to do? Frank gets what he thinks is a brilliant idea...""kidnap"" the sexy blonde's dead body and hold it for ransom from her rich widower.

If all this sounds like a darker, indie version of ""Weekend at Bernie's"", you're not wrong at all.  The movie, while often uneven, is also often quite funny, and anchored by strong performances from Glover as the dim, sweet-natured gravedigger Eddie and Lee as the bungling small-time hustler Frank; gorgeous Melissa Keller does her bit as Crystal, especially in several dream/fantasy sequences where she comes back to life and flirts with Eddie.  It turns out that Crystal herself was an ex-stripper who was involved with the mobster (Pruitt Taylor Vince) for whom Frank and Eddie are trying to raise that quarter of a million dollars, and with that twist, things get *really* tangled up.

Be advised/warned that there's a strong necrophilia subtext (played for laughs) in the movie. There's one scene where Frank catches Eddie in what appears to be a compromising position with Crystal's corpse (unintentional, of course, as Frank was just trying to move the body around), and another scene in which the duo visits a morgue where the coroner (Brad Dourif in a hilariously creepy cameo) is setting up for a romantic evening with the dead body of another beauty.",1470787200,,1942,4.858006042296073
