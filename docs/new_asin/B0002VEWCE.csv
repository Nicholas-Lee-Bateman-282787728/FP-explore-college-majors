2125022,2,B0002VEWCE,"It drew me in at the beginning and the killing in the middle, but near the end was stupidly confusing.  Normally whatever you see on the cover on the title is what you would be expecting to see.  Instead of some ""cybernetic-type monster"", you got something else, I'm not going to ruin the surprise.",1231286400,,298,4.5
2125023,3,B0002VEWCE,"This movie was okay. Just okay. The plot was strange. Well, everything was. A waste of five bucks, but it's a great collectible if you like the Spice Girls. Watch if you like Mel B or you like really boring movies.",1215388800,,214,4.2439024390243905
2125024,1,B0002VEWCE,"Seems to be alot of pointless, incoherrant movies about theses days. Alothough you are aware this group is in a compound of sorts...I am not sure why. There aren't any animals there. I might have missed the point somehwere before they went, but I really didn't care to rewind to go find out. The characters are not likeable, and you're glad to watch them get killed. And what is with the one girl's hair? At first, when they are heading towards a different lab filming in the back of a van with face camo paint on, i thought her hair was a mophead attached to the hat she had on as part of a disguise. A few frames later, I realized it was her hair in blonde dread locks. She dies about an hour into this mess after she throws up on her shoes, whick is shown, and then tossed face first into a door.  Which is what you should do to yourself if you waste your money on this garbage. Throw yourself into a door, and slam it on your own head as punishment.",1158278400,,953,4.151351351351352
2125025,1,B0002VEWCE,"The premise of this movie is seemingly solid, and it begins like ""28 Days Later"" Animal Rights Activists break in to a lab and free the cute and fuzzy bunnies. One of them gets captured, and then it turns into some kind of ""Altered States"" heist movie.

Seems our Activists are now set on freeing their captured comrade from the lab where he has become the focus of a new experiment that is gradually stripping away his humanity in a ""Lawnmower Man"" kind of way.

Sounds cool, right? That's what I thought. The problem is that once the heist portion of the movie starts, it goes nowhere fast. There's a lot of pointless screaming as members of the crew start turning on each other. It's another entry into the current string of U.K. funded programming that features people turning on each other. For more of the same, watch ""The Bunker"". The Bad Guy doesn't make an appearance until the last ten minutes of the movie, and it's a pretty dull ride up to that point.",1120003200,2,963,4.497142857142857
2125026,1,B0002VEWCE,"LETHAL DOSE is one of those scifi flicks that in its attempts to be esoteric and ""original,"" it gives the audience no real clue as to what exactly is going on and therefore loses any impact it might have had.  A group of seven young animal activists break into a laboratory to free all the animals.  One of their men is trapped in a bear trap and they are forced to leave him behind in order for the organization to continue.  A year later, we find that the young man caught has been sentenced to three years in prison.  Via a confusing e-mail, the other six activists are reunited.  One of the members visits the imprisoned Gary and finds out that he has volunteered to participate in some kind of experiment, obviously a very hush hush one.  The friends decide to break into the isolated lab and rescue Gary, picking up a couple of new enlistees on the way, one of them a seemingly psychotic ex-marine.  Once they infiltrate the research facility, however, they find themselves locked in and virtual prisoners of someone or something.  They start dying one by one, and its up to the remaining group to find out just what the heck is going on.

From thereon, the plot ricochets off the walls, never becoming coherent, and one is left to wonder just what the experiment's goal was, and what happened to Gary...really.

While there are some atmospheric elements and a few jolts of suspense, the movie descends into such ridiculous territory, one scratches their head and says WHAT WAS THIS ALL ABOUT.

Avoid unless you're into Rubix cubes.",1109894400,5,1538,4.617647058823529
8032853,3,B0002VEWCE,"Well, even after reading all of the negative reviews, I got curious and had to see for myself just how bad all the people said it was. Also, I'm a big fan of Tom Hardy's, so I just had to take a look.
Having said that, I've seen movies that were MUCH worse, right here on Amazon. Several come to mind as I write this, but I don't need to rehash  the really bad ones.
So, in LETHAL DOSE, at least most of the actors were good, the story was interesting, but did move at a snail's pace! if the writers, director and editor had done a better job, it could've been pretty good for one of those ""disease of the week"" stories. In closing, I just wanted to say that compared to the hundreds (if not thousands) of movies I've watched over the course of my life, this one was definitely NOT one of the worst.",1451606400,,799,4.089171974522293
8032854,1,B0002VEWCE,"This is probably the worst movie I have seen in years. It has no redeeming qualities at all (and that is including a couple of minutes of ultra cute and youthful Tom Hardy). Even when I thought it should be over, it just went on and on and on - really awful. OK, I admit it I had to sit through to the end just to assure myself that there was an end. There is, but I have no idea who was in the boat.",1437782400,,400,3.7176470588235295

8032859,1,B0002VEWCE,"This movie is kind of crap.  There I said it,  I watched this for Hardy and was not disappointed in its badness.  Reminded me of Lawnmower Man, a very slightly superior film.  Everyone I wanted to live dies and those I wanted to perish clung stubbornly to life.  Their must be better films to waste your time with, pass on this, life is too short.",1361750400,,347,4.276923076923077
8032860,3,B0002VEWCE,"The film is a typical super-low budget sci-fi horror flick. They're in an underground bunker maze thing and they all start getting knocked off one by one. I actually watched it twice and still have no idea what was going on with the magnets and the electricity and the weird noise that caused people to get sick. And why was that rat bite poisonous?

But, you know what? I kind of don't care because, as usual, Tom Hardy kicks @$$. He has several good moments in the film. And for those 2-3 moments, I'll probably watch the movie again because it's got Tom Hardy in it.",1361404800,,569,4.367924528301887
8032861,5,B0002VEWCE,Movie is interesting and different. For a lower budget movie I think they did very well with it. I enjoyed it :),1344816000,,112,4.136363636363637
8032862,2,B0002VEWCE,"LD 50 (Simon de Selva, 2003)

Is it really possible to give a good review to any movie containing a Spice Girl? I guess nothing's out of the question, but LD 50 is not the movie that will prove this particular rule of thumb wrong. Well, okay, it's not an entirely unredeemable film, but it's certainly not going to turn ex-Spice Girl Melanie Brown into as big a movie star as she was a pop star.

The film starts off with a disbanded animal rights activist group receiving a call for help from one of the former members. The others get back together to try and rescue him from the animal testing lab where he's being held prisoner, but the hunters quickly become the hunted as the owners of the lab start putting the activists through grueling mental, emotional, and ultimately physical tests. Will any of them escape?

Thing is, we don't care. None of these characters has enough depth for us to invest any emotion in the outcome. It's your typical slasher film, with the only variation on the theme being that technology takes the place of the big knife. Put together a bunch of people, add a killer, and for the most part, you can throw such niceties as character development, a complex script, etc. out the window, and that's pretty much what de Selva (an actor by trade directing his first, and to date last, movie) does here. Still, there are some inventive kills, so if you're into that sort of thing and it's enough to carry a movie for you, then this should be right up your alley. Everyone else, hold out for something better. **",1277251200,,1539,4.489285714285714
