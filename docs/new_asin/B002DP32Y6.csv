8365638,5,B002DP32Y6,I have never laughed so hard in my life!  I watch the dvds over and over and they never get old. The comedy sketches are hysterical.  The music is wonderful!  Dean Martin is a born entertainer!  I recommend this dvd set to anyone and everyone.  You will not regret buying these dvds!!!!,1350950400,,286,4.423076923076923
