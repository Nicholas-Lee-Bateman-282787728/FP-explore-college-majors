8504347,5,B006U1WIX0,"There is a chilling realistic vibe to the film, as you are taken into the intimate world of a mental asylum ""Banewood"" where the staff is sadistic and crazier than the patients. It seems they like to remove parts of peoples brains for profit. One young victim, a druggie, Mr. Kowalski, has enough brain left to stalk the hospital, seeking surgeon ""Dr. Brett"" played by Keith Collins who's the main sadist at large here. Theres a group of lovely girls who are slated for surgery and it turns out pretty creepy as they try and escape their fate, another young girl wind sup a zombie like vegetable.  A doctor, sexy Sophia Sassoon, was locked up by Dr. Brett at another facility and escapes , coming to Banewood to get her revenge on him. A sexy nurse who assists in the depravity gets up locked in a room with the Mr. Kawalski with bad results. Its a well assembled cast of good actors and the shooting style is a voyeuristic docu-horror view of the madness. The music is insane and keeps the weirdness at a peak throughout the film. Its a great low budget effort, and intelligently written.",1379721600,,1089,4.527918781725888
