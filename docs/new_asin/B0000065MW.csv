1192467,5,B0000065MW,"The great thing about the 90's is that it still had action and it had cheesy good action too. Dr. Giggles isn't going to be a big franchise like the Friday the 13th movies are, however, it brought forth a good story, dark humor, lots of puns, lots of blood and overall it was just fun to watch. My VHS copy of the movie finally bit the dust so it was time to break down and buy the DVD (and yes, I know, it's on Bluray and on a different movie provider but I like to have physical copies in my hand).

1192493,5,B0000065MW,"I saw this back in the day when it first came out in theatres and I still love it today!  The people who down movies like this really irk me. Sure, this isn't ""Masterpiece Theatre"", it's just good campy fun for a creepy movie night at home, to be enjoyed as it stands. If you understand that concept, then you'll enjoy this movie.  If you're expecting a cameo appearance from Sir Laurence Olivier..well, you're gonna have a bad experience and should probably know better than to watch a movie titled ""Dr. Giggles"" in the first place. The story is actually pretty decent as far as most horror movies go and the acting is well done. Larry Drake is awesome as the mad doctor and the one-liners he delivers as he dispatches his ""patients"" is priceless. I still recall the laughter that came over the theatre when he delivered his final line of the flick. We even get the obligatory ""nursery rhyme"" that goes along perfectly with most small town killers. This movie is just good fun from the early 90's.  Grab some popcorn and some friends and enjoy!",1411948800,,1045,4.547872340425532

1192497,4,B0000065MW,"Dr. Giggles is an early 90's vintage slasher film with a pun-heavy script and a cast full of attractive young people who would go on to be TV stars later in the decade. The plot follows slasher convention with an escaped madman returning to his hometown to wreak havoc on the local teens. There is a back-story told in flashbacks that probably owes more of a debt to Freddy than to Michael. And there's Larry Drake, gleefully hamming it up as the title character. This is not a movie to be taken seriously, at all. That becomes clear when certain unlikely props start showing up seemingly out of nowhere. The actors all seem to be in on the joke though, which elevates the material somewhat. And the movie does have some atmospheric panache going for it, in spite of the bad 90's fashions on display. The hair and makeup styles were clean and simple, but those clothes. Who pairs a bared midriff with jeans roomy enough to hide a pumpkin in? If you like this genre and you're in the mood for a silly gore-fest check this one out.",1382140800,,1029,4.449735449735449
1192498,3,B0000065MW,"Don't go into this one for a serious plot or with a serious frame of mind.

 The whole plot is basically the Dr. going around killing people until he discovers one girl has a heart problem and wants to do a successful surgery on her. The catch is he gets to choose the heart!

 The good ol' Doc, Evan Rendells (Larry Drake) mother died of a bad heart when he was a kid and his father, a heart surgeon, went mad watching her die. The way he ""transplanted"" the boy will stay with you. The villian spews one liners and...giggles.

 We get some predictable but interesting kills, some stereotype characters, offbeat humor and cliches. While not coming off sounding like an oscar winner it still remains an enjoyable B-fest that keeps you glued to the screen. Not to mention instilling yet another phobia concerning the medical community.

 The giggles are what's creepy here. Whenever he gets excited or nervous the giggles come forth as the result of habit. It's not as stupid as it sounds and works pretty well.

 The deaths are cool. The one that stands out the most was the liposuction from hell - youch!

 The main character is a pretty teenage girl named Jen with a few friends, some unfortunite policemen and others, a bitchy stepmom, a cheating jerk boyfriend and more. Some of the acting needs work but Jen (Holly Marie Combs) and the doctor pull their own weight full force and leave you wanting to let out a giggle of your own.

 The body count for this movie is ALMOST 20 PEOPLE!!! So it's obvious the reason people watch this movie. Surprisingly not everyone you pegged as fillers for body bags dies.

 Not meant to be creepy but we do get the jump out of the shadow false scares, particularly in the docs old house. We also get to see some rather sad flashbacks in the docs mind concerning his dad/mother/scenario. And some drama on the part of the main character with her own mother.

 Again...it may not be art. :) But it's fun!",1379635200,,1940,4.510028653295129

1192508,3,B0000065MW,"Honestly, something has to be done about the security levels for mental institutions; they're always allowing the creme de la crazy to escape. This time around it's a John Doe aptly renamed Dr. Giggles, due to his belief that he actually is in the field of medicine as well as his high pitched laugh disposition. But lo and behold, when our unlicensed loony returns to the decayed home he grew up in, we discover his father was the family doctor of Moorehigh City, CA (did future Prop 19 supporters write this?). That is, until family issues prompted medical practices that were, ahem, unethical. Oh well, at least ole Giggles doesn't know about Holly Marie Combs' mitral valve prolapse problems... teehee, snicker... ok, he does, eventually. In the title character's role, Larry Drake drops just about every stereotypical one-liner about doctors on record when making his house calls of horror (typically bloody, often unrealistic). Since Glenn Quinn plays a similar role to his stint as Becky's husband on ""Roseanne"", it's likely he felt right at home with the aforementioned zingers.

1192510,5,B0000065MW,"This film was recommended by Sid the Elf as a can't-miss! It had been ages since I've seen it. To be honest I didn't care for it upon its release, but after years of maturity and openess I took another look at it and was quite pleased!

You can pretty much look at a movie and tell what decade it was filmed in with little difficulty. Many films have that ""look"" or feel that just screams 70s, 80s, 90s. This is one of those that has early 1990 all over it. Not just the clothes or hairstyles, but the overall feel of the movie. If you've seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Nightmare-on-Elm-Street-4/dp/0780630874/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Nightmare on Elm Street 4</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2/dp/B00008PC2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard-with-a-Vengeance/dp/B000O78KW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard with a Vengeance</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-to-Kill/dp/B00005RFNR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard to Kill</a>&nbsp;(among many others), you might know what I mean.

First of all to really enjoy this movie you MUST give plenty of slack with the storyline. Overall its solid and believable but there were a few points that I questioned. Second you CANNOT be annoyed by the countless cornball lines that Dr. Giggles gives throughout the movie, usually after he's just killed someone (personally I think they enhance the movie), but sometimes before. Other than that I can't see any other reason NOT to like this movie.

It stars Holly Marie Combs long before her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charmed/dp/B001BN4WL8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charmed</a>, legendary TV star Cliff De Young (whom you'll recognize only if you seen him), Glenn Quinn, who played Becky's jerk boyfriend on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roseanne/dp/B000WSVBG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roseanne</a>, and Darin Heames, who seems to be Hollywood's go-to guy for goofy-looking dorks in various bitparts on TV. And of course, the good Dr. himself, Larry Drake, who's been in countless movies as ""that guy!"" as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Darkman/dp/0783226012/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Darkman</a>, and many cartoon voices.

The special effects are great and the acting is what you expect from horror. Need I say more? There are a few scenes that had me spooked, too. I'd thought there was a sequel to this but don't see how. It's still a fun movie all these years later.

Thanks Sid for recommending another classic!",1246320000,,2803,6.906779661016949
1192511,5,B0000065MW,"When it comes to Sid there isn't much better then a fine b horror from the 90's. If you've read any of our reviews in the past you know we have a true affection for the films showcased in this time period. And Dr Giggles is no exception. For years we've known about it but for some reason never took the bull by the horns on this one. Thankfully on-demand, whose supplied us with so many gems, had it available which gave us no choice but to take the plunge.

The small town of Moorehigh is unaware that the wildly insane Dr. Giggles (Larry Drake) has just broken free from a mental institution and is on his way to pay a visit. Years back that very town murdered his equally crazy father who experimented with the townspeople. His dream was to perform the first heart transplant with no anesthesia, but was stopped in his tracks. Motivated by revenge Dr. Giggles shows up and the killings begin, along with his sinister laughs while in the act. His first 2 kills are non other then Doug E Doug & Troy (the white kid with the identity crisis) from the Fear. Yeah awesome! His main goal is to find Jennifer (Holly Marie Combs) who is in need of a heart transplant and perform it himself. The ultimate revenge for his father's twisted legacy.  As the bodies pile up Dr Giggles finds his patient but of course is stopped by all 105lbs of her.

This movie simply had everything we look for in a campy 90's b horror. There is no doubt it was the inspiration for the 1996 classic The Dentist, which we also loved. The story was perfect, the acting was hilarious, and the gore was just enough to be fun without going overboard. Not to mention it came out in 1992 along with the immortal action powerhouse Death Ring. Our only regret is that we watched in 17 years after it came out instead of enjoying it in it's hayday. Without question this is one we Would have loved back in the good old days. We're even going to close it out with the Drive In totals.

1192512,4,B0000065MW,"This was a surprisingly entertaining B-type film with a lot of good lines by ""Dr. Giggles"" (Larry Drake).

 ""Dr. Giggles"" is a mad doctor who has this high-pitched giggle when he kills people, which is frequently. It sounds hokey, and it is, but it's done with great tongue-in-cheek humor. Actually, that's what I think this is: a takeoff on grisly horror movies. Drake's Ines, mostly doctor clinches, are very funny and his face is strange enough so that he fits the part.

This movie is well photographed, too and with nice color sand some good camera angles.

Overall, I'd rate this a ""sleeper,"" something much better than anticipated.",1229472000,,638,4.87962962962963
1192513,4,B0000065MW,"At a mental hospital, a patient nicknamed Dr. Giggles (Larry Drake) because of his giggling whenever he kills someone has escaped. His father was considered a great doctor as now he follows his footsteps by wearing a doctor coat and has a medical kit full of stuff like stomach-pump, scapal, bonesaw, syringes filled with chemicals etc. as he uses them to terrorize a small town's folk to kill them, he also stalks a beautiful young girl with a bad heart as he needs her for a sick experiment.

Well made and funny splatter slasher comedy from Dark Horse productions who would later give us ""The Mask"", ""Sin City"" and ""Hellboy 1 & 2"". The film does offer some cringe-inducing sequences of murder like a probe up some lady's nose then into the brain and a stomach-pump sequence that will gross you out. The acting is decent and the make-up effects are chilling, but there is some dark sick humor presented in the motion picture. Fans of slasher flicks should give this one a try as it's one of the most overlooked and enjoyable horror entries of the 90's.

This DVD does have great picture and sound but there's no trailer or other extras, oh well at least it's back on DVD.

1192514,4,B0000065MW,"Remember Larry Drake's Emmy Award-winning portrayal of ""Benny,"" the mentally challenged office worker on L.A. Law?  Well, a couple of years before he started winning the hearts of L.A. Law viewers, Larry Drake was busy removing the hearts of the residents of Moorehigh - while they were still alive, no less - as the infamous Dr. Giggles.  Now let's just stop for a minute here and talk about this giggling thing.  I think all of the maniacal giggling did this movie more harm than good, and I for one would never have released a film with this campy a title.  How can you take this movie seriously with a title like Dr. Giggles?  It might be different if this were a horror comedy, but it isn't - sure, there are elements of comedy strewn loosely about every so often, but I defy anyone to watch this movie without getting sick and tired of the one-liner overkill that plagues it.  I don't have any complaints in the horror department, though, as Dr. Giggles turned out to be a pretty successful slasher film.

Young Evan Rendell always wanted to be a doctor, just like his father.  That didn't change just because his father went mad and ended up killing several patients in a futile attempt to save his wife's life.  Mrs. Rendell died, Dr. Rendell was killed by a mob, and young Evan disappeared, eventually ending up as a John Doe in a mental institution.  As the movie opens, ""Dr. Giggles"" escapes, not before killing several staff members, and heads toward home to continue his father's work.  The old Rendell house, abandoned all these years, gives him access to all the tools of the trade - not to mention a few that he comes up with on his own.  His first patients, in the form of dumb teenagers exploring the spooky old house, actually come to him, but his attention focuses on young Jennifer Campbell (a pre-Charmed Holly Marie Combs) when he learns that she has a ""broken heart"" just like his mother - in Jennifer's case, it's a mitrovalve prolapse.  Dr. Giggles is determined to save her, and he certainly has plenty of brand new hearts to choose from by the time he finally gets her under his control.

It's just a bad day all around for poor Jennifer.  Her doctor gives her a heart monitor to wear in order to see if she'll need heart surgery to repair her valve; her step-mother is just as annoying as ever; her boyfriend proves to be less than loyal (making for just the kind of excitement she's supposed to avoid) - and now the dangerously schizophrenic son of the man who killed her mother is coming after her, determined to cure her ""broken heart"" with the most radical of unwanted surgeries.

There's nothing all that scary about this movie, although some might experience a few creeps during a certain morgue scene, and I don't think true gorehounds will find the film excessively gory, either.  Still, the body count is most satisfying, all of the victims are killed in the most interesting and unusual of ways, and it's always nice to see a mad killer who cares so much about his work.

The titular character is a demented doctor who, following his escape from an insane asylum, goes around town killing people with medical instruments. Before each kill, he utters a corny medical-themed line such as ""Time to take your medicine"". There is one scene, set in the hall of mirrors at a carnival, that is particularly effective, as the bad guy and a couple of the characters chase each other around inside. I guess what turned me off was too many bad jokes, way too much unrealism, and one or two too many ""he's dead- oh, wait, he's not"" moments.

1192520,2,B0000065MW,"What can you say about a movie like this after viewing it, really? With a title like ""Dr. Giggles"" can anyone really expect anything but a real cheesy, campy horror film? Films like these are a dime a dozen, some better than others, but in general, most are nearly unwatchable. And though this film teeters on that edge, it doesn't quite get there. No, this is not a good movie. Just as 99% of the other films like this one, the plot is fairly stupid, and the comedy injected into it is horrendous. Yes, there are horrible play -on-words or stupid one-line jokes throughout this thing! This movie is about a psychopathic son of a murderous doctor that escapes from a mental institution and goes back to his hometown to get revenge and continue his father's devilish work.  However, the acting is not as horrible as one might expect in these films. To be honest, I'm a fan of Larry Drake, mostly because of his role as the bad guy Durant in the first two Darkman films. This was one of the main reason I purchased this film without watching it first. (That reason, and that it was real cheap too!) And though I think he did an ok job in this one, I can't help but hate that stupid damn giggle he does all through the movie!!! The other lead role played by Hollie Mary Combs, better known for her role in Charmed, did a alright acting job as well, but all in all, there's nothing special going on here. But like I said, I wasn't expecting anything real good out this one, except maybe some decent gore. But even the gore level wasn't nearly as high as I would have liked to seen. But there were a few camera tricks that I did notice that were kinda creative. But ultimately, you get 2 different views of opinion from a film like this. First there are those horror fans that go for this sorta thing and like a lot of campy comedy in their horror movies. The more stupid, the better, it seems like to me! And then you have the hardcore horror fan who wants straight-edged terror, blood, and violence done in a at least, semi-serious way. And its that category that I fall into. Hey,I try to have an open mind about most of these campy films I watch, I really do. That's why I bothered to watch (and even buy) this DVD. And there are certain films of this nature I do like (Evil Dead and House come right to mind). And I suppose that this movie is worth watching at least once. But overall, I'm left with the feeling of why? Why make movies like this? I guess the answer is that some people do like this kind of horror, but as for me..I'll pass. What's troubling me is that more films like this one keep making their way into my DVD collection for one reason or another, and being the collector that I am, I don't have the heart to get rid of them! With that said, depending on what type of horror fanatic you are, you'll either laugh with enjoyment at this one and consider a good horror comedy, or you'll simply dismiss this as stupidity. And I tend to lean toward the latter of the two.",1193011200,,2984,4.290780141843972

But when his wife is diagnosed with a deadly heart disease, doc snaps and hurriedly rushes to find a suitable donor for his beloved. Since searching for a donor involves murdering the locals and cutting them open, doc is soon rumpled.
 As the mob descends on him, doc manages to conceal young Evan away (sick - Cartman has spoofed this scene in South Park).

Years later a now adult and deranged Evan (Larry Drake `Darkman') escapes from a sanatorium, and heads home to set up his own practice.
After some one liners and kills involving various medical instruments Evan learns of local girl Jennifer (Holly Marie Combs `Charmed), who suffers from the same heart condition as Evans dear mum did. Evan only wants to save her, but his idea of life saving surgery is basically just ripping her heart out.

1192526,5,B0000065MW,"It's silly, it's predictable, it's got every cliche in the book, it's full of awful one liners and bad puns, it bombed at the box office, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Dr. Giggles was a movie that came along at the very end of the long slasher movie run.  I'm talking about the original slasher movie run now, not that idiotic ""I know I'm in a slasher movie"" genre resurrected by Scream a few years later.  Slasher films exist today in one form or another, but usually direct to video.  Dr. Giggles was one of the last, if not the last to hit theaters.  Around this time the public wasn't really ""feeling it"" anymore when it came to this genre, and the film makers here must have known it, so it was decided(wisely if you ask me) to play Dr. Giggles tongue in cheek.....and tongue in cheek it certainly is!  This is why I don't understand these schmucks who whine about the film not being scary.  Well, it's awfully clear it's really not supposed to be.  Hell, the title should be a hint.  Most slasher flicks use revenge as the motive for the killer's killing spree, and Dr. Giggles is no exception, but there is a twist.  Dr. Giggles comes back to his hometown to slaughter everyone for revenge of the lynching of his father many years back.  His father was the town doctor who killed many patients in order to find a heart for his dying wife.  About half way into the film Dr. Giggles decides to try to attempt the heart transplant that his father never got the chance to try(Dr. Giggles' mother eventually died from that failing heart).  Conveniently enough, our leading lady has a heart problem, and becomes the doctor's focus.  So, he takes a hiatus from mass murder and chases our heroine all around hell and back in order to get her into his operating room.  Naturally he kills anyone who gets in his way.  It's weird coz the one character who's the target is the one who you really don't have to worry about being killed.  It's an interesting twist in a rather cliche riddled film.  Nothing in this movie is meant to be taken seriously.  If you haven't realized that by the time he kills the town slut with a giant Band-Aid, you'd better just shut the movie off.  The real star of this film is Larry Drake.  It wouldn't be half as fun without his performance.  You won't be able to help yourself from laughing at the rotten jokes and puns, and he's never at a loss for one.  One of my personal faves being when he shoves a bone saw into a guy's stomach and says, ""you think that's bad, wait til you get my bill"".  And of course there's the giggle.  Since it has a rather definite ending, I don't think this was meant to be a franchise, but it would have been nice to see more Dr. Giggles mayhem.  Very funny movie and definitely worth a watch if you're into the sillier side of the horror genre like Ice  Cream Man, Leprechaun or Jack Frost.  Lets just hope it gets rereleased on dvd.",1184716800,,2901,4.353817504655494

1192528,4,B0000065MW,"I can't understand why so many people are surprised by the prices on Dr. Giggles here. It's important to realize those prices don't reflect the film's cultural value or its cult status. And it's all the same if a movie got Oscar, Golden Globe and whatnot. It's just that this edition is being OOP for a long time so the price goes for the rare release itself, no matter what the film is. Believe me, when Skinned Deep is out of production for a couple of years, it will cost exactly the same. If here, on Amazon, you look for such flicks as Fun, Parents, Phantasm or Puppet Master (different installments), you'll see they all cost a pretty penny, because it's just almost impossible to find them elsewhere. And all the sellers know the rule: collectors are crazy, they'd buy what they need for any sum of money.

So now for Dr. Giggles itself. I remember first watching it in 1993 and I was totally mesmerized - not by the film itself although I liked it a lot, but by Larry Drake who without any doubt stole the show here. First the music during opening credits was great and that was a good sign (it's always a good sign). The story itself wasn't new, and I'm sure given to any other director and other leading actor it'd become another mindless slasher to forget the next day. Oh, and we certainly shouldn't forget about the script, because Dr. Giggles is written fabulously. All that phrases put in the mouth of Larry Drake's character made this film an incredibly funny yet creepy experience. Me and my friends were quoting them endlessly. Just a couple of examples: 'If you think that's bad wait until you get my bill' or (pulling out a golf club) - 'Time to do what doctors do best' or (watching a boy playing video game) - 'Terminal' or (before performing a stomach lavage to a girl) - 'We got to start taking better care of ourselves. Remember: we are what we eat'. All those lines were just hilarious especially seeing what followed them. But of course it was not all just fun. Dr. Giggles contains one of the most grisly scenes I've seen - with a woman's dead body in the cellar (you know what I mean if you watched it). So even if we put it like a black comedy, it's one of the darkest I've ever seen.

Anyway this little gem became somewhat a cult film among horror buffs and Dr. Giggles is still one of the dearest VHS copies in my collection. I started to follow Larry Drake's career, but as I know he didn't have parts like this anymore and that's a shame because here he proved he can carry the weight of a movie on his shoulders.

1192533,5,B0000065MW,"Plot: In the small town of Moorehigh, back in the late 1950s, a doctor-gone-mad was murdering people in an effort to save his wife who was destined for her ultimate end because of heart problems. The neighborhood stoned him to death, but his young son was never found. However, a modern-day psychiatric facility holds a John Doe patient known only by his nickname -- Dr. Giggles -- and, of course, it's him. He escapes the asylum and returns to his hometown to exact revenge for his shattered childhood -- his only company being witty one-liners, various murder devices, a maniacal drive to kill, and plenty of laughs to go along with it.

I was expecting a flop of a slasher movie that would fail to rise above any other film in the genre, but entertain nonetheless. What I got was a definite cut above the rest. One of the greatest choices made for the film was casting Larry Drake as the diabolical Dr. Giggles. An undeniably creepy man, he fit perfectly into the role. The majority of the acting and script were also surprisingly well executed, but Drake really made this movie worth the five stars. Playing around with a darkly humorous atmosphere and equally impressive dialogue for the amusing doctor of death, I felt the character was one of the greatest slashers ever produced. Put that together with some decent gore and you've got one hell of a killer flick.

1192545,1,B0000065MW,"Manny Coto, the director, is let down in this wannabe slasher classic by Manny Coto, the cowriter.
Larry Drake is an escaped mental patient who returns to his old hometown to exact revenge. It seems years before, his dad killed seven patients looking for a heart for his ailing wife. Being a good dad, he involved his young son in his diabolical scheme before being killed by angered townfolk. He did manage to save his son, however, by sewing him up in his dead wife's corpse so he could dramatically emerge later at the morgue. Gosh, and all my dad ever did was encourage me to do better in school.
Drake becomes fixated on Holly Marie Combs (who wouldn't?) who has mitral valve prolapse, a heart condition that could worsen. Holly is having boyfriend troubles, her dad Cliff DeYoung has shacked up with a young Michelle Johnson (who wouldn't?), and Holly's mom died after going in for a routine heart operation.
The script also throws in enough victims who get slashed and ripped before we have a chance to care about them. We also have the rookie cop who figures the whole thing out, despite the rest of the police department poo-pooing the teens' stories about a lunatic doctor with a bad bedside manner. You can script the ending, as Combs is rescued in the nick of time from Drake's twisted heart transplant, but the real battle comes later on during Combs' real heart surgery, as the villainous doctor is one of those unkillable type slashers.
The set up for the film is introduced immediately, and then the cast really has nothing to do but wait for Drake to come a-killin'. This makes for some pretty suspenseless scenes. We know who the killer is, we know why he kills, and we know who he is going to kill. Coto has great visuals here, but his cowritten script gets goofier and dumber as it goes along. The excellent funhouse mirror room scene is offset by an embarassed cast with embarassing lines. Poor Drake, normally a superb actor, is given a literal ton of bad doctor cliches to say. I have never been a fan of the ""funny"" killer in horror films, and this just proves my point. I could not warm up and laugh, especially at all the carnage going on here. If you want to laugh at buckets of blood, see ""Body Melt"" or ""Killer Tongue.""
Coto also ignores rather a obvious plothole. Drake escapes from a mental institution, where he was listed as unidentified. Yet, the town where his father did all the killing, and where the child Drake disappeared from, is within fifty miles of the asylum. If a seven year old boy went missing from a local mass murderer's family estate at the same moment a seven year old boy was knocking on the asylum's front door, I would be suspicious. I guess news does not travel fast in movieland. Also, a lot of the action takes place in the old basement offices of the killer doctor. The film makers shot this in an obvious real hospital, which means the basement of this decrepit house is the size of a football field, complete with working fluorescent lights. Sloppy, sloppy.
I am not kidding when I say every cliche a doctor has uttered is here. From ""physician, heal thyself"" to Drake turning to the audience while dying and asking if there is a doctor in the house. Unfunny, but watching this bad film gave me the same feeling as the last time I was asked this question, oddly not found in the script: ""Turn your head and cough."" ""Dr. Giggles"" is not funny, and in need of an emergency suspense transplant...",1032307200,,3454,4.545746388443018

1192547,3,B0000065MW,"Your typical 80s-early 90s slasher flic, but with that added sense of absurdity.  This movie either tries too hard or not enough (hopefully the latter), and the end result is an amusing, if not gruesome, horror movie.
""Dr. Giggles"" is the son of another doctor who was stealing various necessary body parts, specifically hearts, from his patients to save his ailing wife.  Eventually, the doctor was caught, the wife dies, and Dr. Giggles (whose father taught him how to take the organs out of patients) eventually goes crazy or something and ends up in a mental institution.  Fast-forward years later, and Dr. Giggles (aptly named for his habit of giggling like a small child) has escaped from his padded cell or whatever and is working on an unconcious hospital orderly in a large surgical auditorium, much to the delight of other onlooking crazies.  Later, he escapes and makes his way to his boyhood town, the inhabitants of which he still blames for seperating him from his father.
While he is holed up in his childhood house, four teenagers venture into the abandoned house on a dare (of course).  Two of them get seperated, and the other two run off to do what hormonally-raged teens do best, apparently forgetting their ill-fated friends.
The two unfortunates who are stuck in the house get killed by Dr. Giggles, unbeknownst to the other two horny teens (one of whom has a debilitating HEART condition, did I forget to mention).  The good doctor then goes on to wreak his havoc on the rest of the good townspeople.
""Dr. Giggles"" is probably one of the most inventive slasher movies of all time, with each victim being disposed of in a completely different medical-esque fashion, and an antidote from most slice-and-dice horror films that contain your basic cleavers and big knives.  In one scene, a woman who has just eaten a bowl of ice cream gets tied up in a chair by Dr. Giggles.  He takes out a long sort of vacuum tube, with a roto-rooter style spinning blade in the middle.  Jamming it down the throat of his victim, the tube sucks up a whole load of creamy vanilla ice cream, followed by bright red blood as the roto-rooter blade chops up the woman's stomach.  Oddly amusing, once you get over the fact that it's utterly disgusting.
Add to the mix a hot-shot new officer on the town's police force, an old sheriff who has a confusing flashback with a boyhood Dr. Giggles breaking free from the inside of his dead mother's corpse, and the broken heart girl's father, and you still have a generic slasher movie with a sterile, clichd plot with the emphasis on bloody violence.
But if you like that sort of thing, then they rarely get bloodier, gorier, or brutal as this.  It's what sets it apart from all the other horror movies of its day.  Probably better renting it, though.",1019865600,,2792,4.6871165644171775
