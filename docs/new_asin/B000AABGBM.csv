8077116,4,B000AABGBM,"This is technically not a great film.  It has a low budgety feel about it.  The title of the movie was changed three different times and held for US release for 7 years, which is never a good sign.
Still, it manages to be fun and entertaining, primarily due to Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland, who still manage to generate a strong sexual chemistry in their 50s (Miss Rogers certainly retained her gorgeous good looks and figure long past most of her contemporaries).  It's hard not to think of Ray Milland and Ginger Rogers in their other films together, 'The Major and the Minor' (1942), and 'Lady in the Dark' (1944).
This film has a very swinging sixties feel throughout even in the opening credits and animation.
As a huge Ginger Rogers fan, it is a definite recommend if you're collecting her films.",1425686400,4,803,4.601398601398602

8077118,5,B000AABGBM,"i love this movie,combines humor,truth,and satire together to let you feel and believe in miracles along with Barbara Eden's Pia. A innocent minded young girl from the wrong side of Toe-Knee -do,Italy-pregnant and goes to Saint Joseph for answers unknowingly to get advice from a source higher than a conman as to what to do-""Have faith and everything will get better"".",1412467200,2,369,5.065573770491803
8077119,3,B000AABGBM,Quick Lets  get married  had  a good  cast  but  the  script  just wasn't  that  great.  While I love Barbara Eden if I had  seen a clip of this film I would  have not  bought it. Try a different film and avoid this one. It  really isn't funny.,1405036800,2,244,3.893617021276596
8077120,5,B000AABGBM,"""Quick Let's Get Married"" (1964) is such a wonderful comedy. The story of this movie is a little romantic and a little dramatic, some episodes are funny. ""Quick Let's Get Married"" also known as ""The Confession"". I like all of actors' play, especially delightful Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland. It was really fun to see them in their older years! At that age Ginger still was good looking. Also, I like the play of Barbara Eden, very impressive.",1387929600,5,443,4.6923076923076925
8077121,1,B000AABGBM,I bought this because I thought it would be fun to see Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland in their older years.  Not to mention Ceaser Romero.....but man oh man what a stinker of a script.  Don't bother.,1361318400,2,198,4.324324324324325
8077122,5,B000AABGBM,This movie was filmed in 1964 but wasn't released until 1971 due to editing problems. The treasure search plot is actually dominated by a  miracle that can only seen by Pia(Barbara Eden) when she starts praying at the local Church Statue that eventually changes the character for the better of the otherwise corrrupt townspeople. This movie also is the film debut of Elliot Gould who plays a deaf mute and an ageing Ginger Rogers who is still beautiful! It wasn't the best movie but it was very nice to watch regardless!!,1347494400,11,521,4.725274725274725
