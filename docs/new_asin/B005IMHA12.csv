8474820,5,B005IMHA12,"The DVD's presentation is excellent... He comes on the stage and drops solid game for about 30 minutes, then takes questions from the audience for the rest of the DVD. I suspect this is to engage the audience in a dialog and possibly - because (IMO) Tariq does best when he reacts to an audience need... rather than plan to speak on something that the audience majority already knows. He even included Jeff Carroll's ""Yo Jeff, the Hip-Hop Dating Coach"" corny question segment on there, I was surprised. I mainly bought this DVD to show my appreciation for all the good game Mr. Nasheed has laced me with over the years (have been listening to his podcast shows since 2006). Tariq Nasheed has really changed my life, from helping me create options so I don't waste time on worthless women, to realizing that some of my friends were actually bisexual... enabling me to plan accordingly (not sleeping in their house overnight - I mean, NOW I think ""why did dude just come out of the shower and walk to his bedroom naked -- while I'm here?!!!"" I immediately left and haven't returned).
Check out his podcasts on macklessonsradio - it might change your life also!",1322352000,6,1158,4.6536585365853655
