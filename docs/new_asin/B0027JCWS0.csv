3867818,5,B0027JCWS0,"This was a well documented review of the (ABMC)American Battles Monument Commision's role in honoring the war dead of WW1 and WW2.  The video begins with an overview of the worldwide locations of the various cemeteries then focuses on each particular location.  There are several personal interest stories embedded within the narrative as well as interviews with veterans, locals, and ABMC administrators.  There is no shock and awe here just a somber, well done story about America's war dead.",1251331200,2,494,5.227848101265823

3867825,5,B0027JCWS0,"Well worth watching. I had no idea about our soldiers who died and were buried in forgein cemeteries. It's a trip back but also shows the beauty and reverence of our sacraficial men. My Dad, who served in WWII watched with tears in his eyes.
Now after researching my family, I have two ancesters buried in France and would love to visit.",1405209600,,337,4.451612903225806
3867826,3,B0027JCWS0,"So much new information and reasons for the foreign burial.  So many different sites around the world.  Unfortunately, the program felt repetitive and I found myself bored.  I was hoping for something with more heft.  Moving in many ways, the love and respect shown by the locals for our honored dead.",1403654400,,301,4.8431372549019605
3867827,5,B0027JCWS0,"A very moving tribute to the men and women who gave their life in service to their country. Although WWI and WWII are the primary focus of this film, the sacrifices made by our service men and women are for all eras.",1402358400,,216,4.166666666666667

3867829,5,B0027JCWS0,"'Hallowed Grounds' is a dvd of Americas overseas military cemeteries.  For those fortunate to be able to visit these cemeteries where 125,000 military men and women lie buried in foreign lands become instantly aware of the sacredness of these designated places.  They are grateful that these cemeteries are well landscaped and beautifully maintained.  One who visited  a First World War cemetery north west of Paris will always remember hearing the perpetual sound of thousands of song birds, and the bell tower sounding the hour. That day there was an absence of visitors except oneself accompanied by two friends.  The landscaped grass grounds with its rows of  white marble crosses, or the Star of David, marked where an American warrior lay buried.  The Hallowed Grounds dvd is a beautiful and worthy tribute in depicting these overseas American military cemeteries.",1387065600,,870,5.260869565217392
3867830,5,B0027JCWS0,"Everyone who had family serving during this war should view this DVD. It is a moving tribute to our war dead. I wanted to have this DVD because I have  an uncle lose his life getting on to shore, not even having a chance to defend himself. I am not able to visit  Utah Beach where he is laid to rest so this gives me chance to pay my respects to him and all those who gave the ultimate sacrifice
for us to have the freedoms we have today. I suggest this be passed to veteran groups and schools for us to NEVER forget .",1386201600,,518,3.9238095238095236

3867832,4,B0027JCWS0,Beautifully filmed and with good historical background. A little superficial but worth watching. I would have liked a little more footage of the parks themselves.,1384905600,,162,5.52
3867833,5,B0027JCWS0,"I got a bunch of cemetery DVD's last year for Christmas, as I have a cemetery photography business that goes by the name of ""Graveyard Walker"", and also I work locally in cemetery preservation, so these were all very entertaining and appropriate for me!! :D",1381190400,,257,4.733333333333333

3867835,5,B0027JCWS0,Every citizen in this country should be required to view this DVD. Everything we hold dear as Americans is directly related to the sacrifices made by all those souls who are buried around the world for upholding the freedoms that we have the privilege to realize everyday. Children should be taught from a very young age to understand what these men and women sacrificed and adults should be reminded. If people in Europe and around the world have the compassion to care for our fallen soldiers then we should follow their example and do the same.,1376611200,,547,4.708333333333333

3867838,5,B0027JCWS0,I had no idea these national cemetaries were so well preserved and cared for -- by foreigners!  It was so moving to hear their words of gratitude for our soldiers.  The grounds are beautiful!  I am thankful that they exist as a witness to the sacrifice of our boys.,1368403200,,265,4.36734693877551
3867839,5,B0027JCWS0,"This was a well-done and extremely moving documentary.  War leaves its mark on us, each and every one - living or dead.  I was moved to see that local residents visit these U.S. military cemeteries abroad.  It is heart warming to think that have not forgotten the sacrifices we have made for their freedom.  I had no idea that anyone overseas could show such compassion for fallen Americans, since we as a people have long been despised round the world.  Even yet, I would gladly support a call for aid from foreign countries who ask for our help.  It is an imperative, after all - to right the wrongs of others.  Our participation in World War I and World War II clearly depict that this imperative is deeply ingrained in us, one and all.",1348963200,,739,4.470149253731344
3867840,5,B0027JCWS0,"This video is awesome!  One of the most interesting parts was watching French childfren interact with American WWII Vets.  They treated these men like hereos and idols.  They are taught what these men did for their country.  I have never seen children here react this way to vets.  It was quite inspiring.  This video can be watched repeatedly and never get old.  Just a wonderful, educational and inspiring piece of work.",1348272000,2,422,4.859154929577465
3867841,5,B0027JCWS0,Very moving movie. Everyone should see this! How many fought for our freedom and to remember those who have come before!,1344988800,,120,4.761904761904762
3867842,4,B0027JCWS0,This DVD is beautiful and very informative.  Most of us will not have the chance to visit these cemeteries and this  makes it possible.  Glad its in our DVD collection we will watch it again.,1311033600,3,191,4.4
3867843,5,B0027JCWS0,"Excellent produced documentary of America's finest in their final resting place overseas.  This is very suitable to watch during Memorial Day, Veterans Day or even if you are curious about those who sacrificed their lives, so we could remain free.  So many Americans take our freedom for granted.  They shouldn't.  I highly recommend this PBS Home Video.  Thank you to all our men and women serving in uniform, those who have served in uniform, and those who served that made the ultimate sacrifice.",1298678400,3,499,4.963855421686747
3867844,5,B0027JCWS0,"I work for a cemetery district, and I am always looking for new information on cemeteries. I saw this show on my local PBS station, and I knew I had to add it to my collection.  Until I saw this DVD I never knew that the USA had any military cemeteries outside the USA.  What an eye opener! When I was very young I knew that I had an uncle who was killed in Germany in WWII, and I always thought he was buried in Germany.  After seeing this video, I found out he is buried in Luxembourg Cemetery (where General Patton is buried)  I was able to go on line and find out the location of his grave, and when watching the video I could place the approximate location of his grave.  I am in awe of these cemeteries, they are without a doubt the most beautiful cemeteries I have ever seen.  Every American needs to see this video to really appreciate what the USA has sacrificed for the rest of the world.  The video shows how students take field trips to these cemeteries and are being taught that Americans gave the ultimate sacrifice for their freedom.  Maybe that is something our schools should be teaching our children? Anyone who sees this video will have a new respect of what we have given to the world.  A must see!!!!!!!!!",1286928000,6,1226,4.2956521739130435
3867845,5,B0027JCWS0,"I cannot write anything in this review that would add or take away from what has already been written in previous reviews. I will say though, this documentary was quite moving. It is shot in a style very similar to A&E's ""America's Castles"" but is somber and humbling. I have never, I repeat, I have never gotten emotional over anything from a movie or television show. However, this feature moved me to tears. I'm not talking about getting misty-eyed but copious tears running down my face. Every subsequent cemetery featured would only bring more tears. My wife became quite alarmed walking in on me like that. She decided she should probably watch it also and as you can imagine, was brought to tears as well. Specifically moving were the stories of soldiers buried there. Also, the vast amounts of people who still show gratitude for these Americans is overwhelming. One old Belgian lady still tends a grave her family adopted since 1945. In one celebration an older French man sings ""The Star Spangled Banner"" in French and that was emotional overload. It was something they did since school age; going to the American cemetery and sing national anthem to the fallen. I plan on making this one of my families memorial day traditions by watching it that weekend every year. Even Speilberg or Hanks haven't produced something comparable to this. This really shows the ultimate cost and sacrfice for freedom.",1275955200,14,1410,4.879166666666666
3867846,5,B0027JCWS0,"`Hallowed Grounds' tells the story of the American cemeteries overseas that serve as the final resting place for those killed since 1917, WWI and the years after. There are 24 cemeteries that are a reminder to those on whose soil Americans fought.
This documentary is a splendid example of how these cemeteries not only honor the dead but are also for the living. The narration and filming capture the heart of the hallowed grounds. If you have never walked through one of them, you have missed one of the most moving experiences in the world. They are indeed a symbol of peace and the price of war.

The film gives short narrations of battles and the nearby cemeteries from France and Belgium to the Pacific; of course not all can be covered in this one DVD. Some examples of the men and women who are buried there are given. It would be hard not to be moved watching this. The surrounding countrymen's impressions and visits as well as those of visiting Americans are shown. Students of history and veterans would be well served by viewing this.
This is the next best thing to visiting where these men and women died far from home. These are some of the most peaceful places on earth and the film serves this spirit well. It is almost impossible not to shed a tear.",1259280000,24,1267,4.532751091703057
3867847,5,B0027JCWS0,"This is a well done video.  Unlike the constant reports of how everyone in Europe and the world hates Americans, this progarm shows how we are not hated by all but actually revered by many.  There are the same holiday ceremonies in foreign lands which recognize our men and women who died for (their) freedom.  Classes of school children are taken on field trips to the American Memorial Cemeteries they have built to honor our dead military heroes.  Very much worth watching and owning.  Interesting things I never knew.",1258243200,10,521,4.808988764044944
3867848,5,B0027JCWS0,"The Hallowed Grounds film, superbly done by PBS, is a wonderful walk through the cemetaries on foriegn soil of those who gave the last full measure to our country while serving in the uniform of our nation. It is respectfully and tastefully produced and sends chills down the spine when one sees the enormity of the monuments and the markers that represent the best and the bravest our society had to offer. This DVD should be in every American home!",1255219200,3,450,4.6375

8354863,5,B0027JCWS0,"This film is a must-see for everyone.  I had no idea there were so many burial grounds for fallen Americans around the world; I only knew of Normandy, France.  This is the film that should be shown to school students who have no idea, nor do they seem to care about the ultimate price our servicemen have paid.  The French man singing our Star Spangled Banner, brought a lump to my throat.",1439337600,,389,4.375

8354867,5,B0027JCWS0,Well Worth Watching to see that our American soldiers are still being honored overseas today from the people who were liberated and others. Also good to see the school children learning about the History of the war. I would like to visit some of the cemeteries some day soon.,1420156800,,275,4.63265306122449
