Not a lot of talking just enough and I like that in a video like this.",1490572800,,335,3.6027397260273974
8642638,5,B00IJNYKP6,"Joe is a great instructor and I learned more from watching this DVD than I did in 6 months of Tai Chi in a local group.  Love the DVD and have started doing it, will update you on progress.
  I had never heard of medical QiGong before reading his amazing story of how he recovered from almost total paralysis by visualizing his QiGong routine--incredible!",1489276800,5,355,4.515625
8642639,5,B00IJNYKP6,"Received the DVD quickly and as described.  Very informative.  Mr. Pinella in an inspiration after being in a car accident and yet was ""healed"" through QiGong and Tai Chi movements.  He describes the movements slowly enough so one can follow his instructions.  Very good video.",1453852800,5,277,5.088888888888889
