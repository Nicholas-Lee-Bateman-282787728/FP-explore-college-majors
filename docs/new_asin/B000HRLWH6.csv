8140854,4,B000HRLWH6,"If you are a complete beginner/improver I would recommend this 'How to Play the Irish Mandolin' by Anthony Warde [Waltons Music - CW Productions Ireland].
The unassuming, easy manner and clear introduction is in sharp contrast to many other DVDs.
In addition to scales, tuning, left & right hand focus and exercises also covers the following-(clearly explained)
Triplets, Arpeggios, Hammer ons, Pull-Offs, minor keys, using tone, Tremolo, Cross Picking, Damping, Pinkie (Luidin)-little finger exercises, split strings etc.
However note that it does NOT include sheet music of the tunes.
After 1-2 years of that you are then ready for Chris Theales DVD. Be advised that you may require a 'MULTI-REGION' DVD or player.
Get a Slowdowner to play your practice set at 65->85% of full speed.
Also get a portable CD player with an AB repeat loop (eg: Panasonic) to practice phrases at full speed.
Jigs v's Reel: dR: if you can say doubledecker,doubledecker it is most likely a Reel.
  bJ: if you can say rasers and sausages (bacon) it is most liely a Jig.

For Intemediate to Advanced players I would recommend 'New Celtic Mandolin' DVD by Simon Mayor [Acoustics Masterclass] with a number of tunes with 'Top of the Class' breakdown of how they are played. One of my favourites a slow air 'Buchail Chaol Dubh'(in Gaelic 'the dark slender boy')and associated booklet ISBN:095227762X [Acoustics].
For Irish session music sheets and accompanying CD recording use 'The Foinn Seisiun Book' ASIN: B000PSR3FW from 'Comhaltas', Monkstown, South County Dublin, Ireland. This is now becoming the standard for
all Irish Sessions or O' Neills book of Tunes (1,850+ 'port/foinn'- i.e. tunes) [Waltons]ISBN:1857200276 or [Mel Bay]0786624981 or the series of 'Irish Traditional Music Session Tunes' by A. Sullivan [Halshaw Music UK]. Also Paul Kellys '110 Irish Mandoling Tunes Vol1' +CD [Waltons] ISBN"" 9781857201918 (with a handfull of gems halfway through the seetmusic)

Note session tunes ARE meant to be short and simple affairs to allow many musicians to play together and help nurture talent. It is a starting point, a minimum point of entry, and is not meant to be a final point nor destination.
See also 'Teach yourself Mandolin by Ear' 07866 07149.
For Irish Tin Whistle Tunes [Waltons] in Spanish 185720-1345, in Italian -1353, in French -1337, in German - 1329 and in Japanese -1329.
Due to their friend 'Musical Al', most musicians have advanced Alzeimers and can never remember the names of tunes, hence you should use the following LAS system for Aural development.
L-Build up your LIBRARY of Tones, learn to recognise reference/key notes - 'D' could be the beginning of a tune eg:'Tonto & the Lone Ranger', 'E' could be the sound of a mosquito/phone hang-up tone/your alarm clock etc.
A-practice ARPEGGIOS on sheet music (and whistle the arpeggio 'dots', also use another instrument at hand eg:piano/tin whistle).
S-when learning a new simple tune, SEE the 'dots', whistle and visualise the notes.
This will help your ear see the notes while listening to unfamiliar tunes. Have patience it takes time, also SlowPlayers org, youTube and MusicMoose Org are very useful.
Get connected to your local group via TheSession Org. Get a list of tunes you like that is being played by your local session. Select 15-20 tunes and get them taped.
Most musicians do not mind you taping their set if you intend to join the 'Guild'.

Learn your 'tune set' off by heart at full speed (at least 10). Drop the 'Dots' (sheet music) do NOT bring them into a session. Play softly/quietly and keep the Ego at bay.
Remember 'master the craft' and enjoy the journey with your companions.
Those pauses in the session may be used to sound you out. To see if you are a looking for music companionship or somebody looking for a 'Pop-Idle' platform.
For a guide to 'SessEtte' ('Sessiun' Etiquette) see 'Field Guide to Irish Sessions' by Barry Fox[Rinehart]ISBN:1568331940. Good luck and enjoy.

After learning the melodic skeleton go for melodic fragments  and variations as described in 'Developing Melodic Variations' by John McGann[MelBay]0786650990.
If you like O'Carolan harp music below- see 'Celtic Music for Mandolin' + CD by Allan Alexander & Jessica Walsh [ADG 2003] 1882146891
