8321609,3,B001MS7JR6,"This film was not groundbreaking in originality.  It, like many other films of its type, is simply a reimagining of the story of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

However, this film is worth watching.  The story of ""BROTHER"" with his metal teeth and hunger for flesh is horrifying.  His brothers are fiercly devoted to family and dedicated to keeping Brother safe and well fed.  The actor portraying Jones, Parrish Randall, does an excellent job - giving his body and sanity to the character.  Jimmy Hazzard perfectly complements him as his insane brother.

The gore f/x are great - covered in blood and dripping with gore.  The cinematography is beautiful and the lighting is perfect.

If you enjoyed Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you must see this film.",1231372800,,746,4.951612903225806
