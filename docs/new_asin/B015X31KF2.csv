I have two month old twin boys and It really came at a perfect time for me because both my husband and mom were complaining that I don't sing nearly enough to my babies, even though I am a singer.

Zero stars I want my money back.,1463961600,,335,4.1692307692307695

8734830,5,B015X31KF2,"I bought this Smart Singing DVD with the CD for Babies Smart Singing Lullabies. I was worried I was too late with my 3 year old daughter, however the ability to watch a chapter then practice for a few days, I saw my daughter really catch on to the techniques taught in the video. Since I don't have time to sit and watch the program from start to finish, I love the ability to break it up and put it into practice. My daughter is now signing the lyrics with just the instrumental on her own. A fun new activity for us. Hope there's advanced training to follow!",1450483200,,560,4.194444444444445
