8169447,5,B000MKE9KU,"I got this in the mail yesterday and put it in the DVD player for my 3 year old. She watched it for FOUR hours! She wouldn't let us turn it off. Sprout used to have this on their programming. They discontinued it and it is a shame. The characters have moral lessons about getting along with others and of course, getting what you think you want, which turns into a disaster every time. Very good lessons for preschoolers. Sprout is a poorer channel for discontinuing this program, but getting back to the review. Great video and wonderful opportunity for discussion with your preschooler about what is really important.",1340409600,,619,4.6880733944954125
