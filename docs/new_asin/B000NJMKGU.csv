8542928,5,B000NJMKGU,"Hello, I would like to say Benny Meng's Shaolin Wooden Dummy is one of the best instructional videos I have seen on the Wing Chun Wooden Dummy.  Benny Meng takes you step by step through each section of the wooden dummy form.  You are clearly given examples of each movement on the dummy and, with the help of his students, shown how the movements are applied in real situations.  The picture and sound quality of the DVD is clear, though the production quality is not great.  Regardless, the information on these DVD's is worth every penny.  After viewing both Shaolin Wooden Dummy DVD's, I decided to purchase the other three DVD's in Benny Meng's Wing Chun Series.",1197849600,2,667,4.666666666666667
