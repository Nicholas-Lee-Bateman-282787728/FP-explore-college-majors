1592956,1,B00005JPD0,"I kept my hopes low for this mediocre time machine movie and my expectations were not exceeded! I realize the filmmakers are solely in it for the money. Film is now, for the most part,  a commodity like toothpaste and paper towels - and it shows! I wouldn't even be surprised if Hollywood hired Public Relation firms to write fake positive reviews on sites like Amazon.com!

While I have no complaint with the acting, the storyline is just utterly ridiculous, and boring as sin. I don't think it is asking too much  for a story to make some sense, instead of  treating the movie going public like a bunch of teenagers looking for some cheap thrills!

Where do I begin? This highly professional terrorist has no motive for his madness. He pops out of the blue, belongs to no organizations or movements, and has no ideology, no allies, and no one helping him. Our meany terrorist quotes Thomas Jefferson, claims he's not killing people because the U.S. military hurt his feelings when they rejected him for being ""too much"" of a patriot (I kid you not), and all he wants when he's captured is to confess like he's talking to a priest. (Plus a cigarette, of course, don't all bad guys smoke these days?) Oh, please, give me a break! How sanitized a story can you get? The filmmakers and screenwriters of Deja Vu have absolutely no guts, whatsoever, to make any kind of statement other than that terrorists are crazy and get hurt feelings! Wow! What an interesting insight!

Next, The U.S. Government has a time machine that uses so much energy it caused the last  Canada to New York blackout while doing experiments with just small animals, which, in-turn, all end-up going into cardiac arrest, and dying. But when our fearless hero, Denzel Washington, goes back in time the energy problem miraculously disappears. Keep in mind a single piece of paper was sent through time a couple of days earlier, and it knocked out a whole city's power!

The dying problem is also solved too, with a full recovery taking less than a day. Keep in mind, when most people recover from  going  into cardiac arrest, they are usually not stong enough to waltz out of the hospital a couple of  HOURS later! But Denzel is special, and he doesn't even have super powers!

When Denzel is shot by a rather large caliber bullet, he begins losing blood fast. So fast in fact, that it's obvious to everyone he needs to make a trip to the emergency room, pronto! Instead he goes over to his women's home because of time constraints. There they wash his wound with water and dry it with paper towels. He miracuously stops bleeding because he washed his wound. No need for stiches or compresses, just soap and water stops bleeding from gunshot wounds. Imagine what other miracles would have occurred if he had the time to wash the rest of his body!

I think you get the picture. This is such a dopey film because the  stupidity is non-stop! It's a shame films are not rated based on cleverness and intelligence. If they were, perhaps filmmakers would start making more interesting movies!",1164499200,10,3055,4.6437847866419295
1592957,5,B00005JPD0,"Denzel Washington fans will not be disappointed with his latest work in this sci-fi / action / drama / thriller quadruple punch of a powerhouse film.

The plot centers on an honest, hard-working ATF officer Doug Carlin (played by Denzel Washington) who is recruited by Agent Pyzwarra (Val Kilmer), into a super secret domestic spy agency to help them track down the identity of a terrorist bomber who killed 500 innocent people in the most horrific act of violence since 9-11. Agent Carlin almost immediately becomes suspicious of the voracity of his recruiters when they demonstrate a new piece of spy equipment that they conveniently fail to mention allows them to peek four days into the past and piece together the scene of a crime.

As with all films dealing with time travel, temporal paradoxes pop up everywhere as Carlin tries to save the life of the stunningly beautiful but hapless Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), who unwittingly falls prey to the vile terrorist, and with whom of course, Carlin falls in love.

It's fascinating to watch Carlin chase clue after mysterious clue that he left for himself in another time line as the two alternate realities collide in a series of mishaps that ultimately lead to the death of his partner, the murder of the woman he loves, (Loved? Will love?), and an ever chaotic series of time shifts as he races against the clock to save the lives of innocents as well as the object of his love interest. Will he succeed? All I'll say is the cliff hanging finale will surprise and delight you as our hero finally confronts the most vicious human being he's ever encountered.

The cast is superb in this mind twisting race through the imagination and the film will positively keep you on the edge of your seat until the very heart stopping end.

It's rated PG-13 for graphic violence but if you enjoy brain teasing action that will thrill you from start to finish, then you want to watch this movie!",1164412800,4,1941,4.730769230769231
1592958,4,B00005JPD0,"Dj Vu is an engrossing picture that appeals to the inner longing of anyone who has ever wished to somehow go back in time and change things.  What better things to change than preventing the death of hundreds of innocent men, women and children in a horrific bomb attack by an American terrorist, and saving the girl of your dreams at the same time.

The movie starts as a straight investigative thriller and soon diverges into science fiction territory involving viewing the past, a la ""The Dead Past"" by Isaac Asimov, and eventually physically traveling back in time.  Denzel Washington's acting convinces the audience that this is possible and in this and other ways carries the film with his performance of a dedicated, affable, and noble man.  I have seldom seen him in a role I liked better.

There are many clever twists and turns that add credence to the movie's premise, and a number of edge of your seat situations, including a chase sequence that occurs simultaneously in two different times that has to be seen to be believed.

My only reservation is the PG-13 rating, as the mass murder at the beginning of the film is realistic enough to give an impressionable mind Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and the graphic evidence of torture found at an autopsy along with scenes of mayhem and murder are not suitable for younger audiences.  There is also a strong element of voyeurism and brief nudity.",1164412800,3,1409,4.773662551440329
1592959,5,B00005JPD0,"""Deja Vu"" is excellent! The third re-teaming of Denzel Washington-Tony Scott-Jerry Bruckheimer combo is excellent and smart and one of the original films of the year. The directing by Tony Scott (his third go-round with Denzel Washington since ""Crimson Tide"" (1995) & ""Man On Fire"" (2004) & his sixth go-round with Jerry Bruckheimer since ""Top Gun"" (1986) is excellent. The story and screenplay by Bill Marsilii & Terry Rossio (who is known for his work on the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" trilogy) is excellent. The music by Harry Gregson-Williams (the sixth go-round with Scott since ""Enemy Of The State"" (1998) is excellent. The cinematography by Paul Cameron (his third go-round with Scott since ""Beat The Devil"" (2002) is excellent. The film editing by Chris Lebenzon (his seventh go-round with Scott since ""Top Gun"") & Jason Hellmann (who also film edited Bruckheimer's ""Glory Road"" (2006) is excellent. The casting by Kerry Barden, Billy Hopkins (his second go-round with Scott since ""True Romance"" (1993), Suzanne Smith, & Denise Chamian (her second go-round after Scott's recent pic ""Domino"" (2005) is excellent. The production design by Chris Seagers (his third go-round with Scott since ""Man On Fire"") is excellent. The art direction by Drew Boughton (his second go-round after Scott's recent pic ""Domino""), Gary Diamond, & Scott Plauche is excellent. The set decoration by Rosemary Brandenburg is excellent. The costume design by Ellen Mirojnick is excellent. This is one of the most original films of the year. This is smart, excellent, and well-paced. This is another one of Tony Scott's hits.",1164326400,2,1605,5.249027237354086
1592960,5,B00005JPD0,"Deja Vu.  I went to this movie with some friends of mine with LOW expectations(I wanted to see The Fountain, but thats a long story).  I was expecting a big, dumb action thriller with some time travel garbage thrown in.  Don't get me wrong, I think Denzel Washington is a great actor, Adam Goldberg is also great, but the trailers made it seem(at least to me) like a big action movie.  Bruckheimer's name didn't help.  Surprisingly it was fresh, smart, funny, and exciting.

Tony Scott, what can I say.  I feel bad for him, but I'm gonna have to stop if he keeps directing good movies like this.  Would that not suck to have Ridley Scott as a brother.  I can think of Thanksgiving.

*Scott's mom* ""Dear Lord, thank you for Ridley's amazing directorial abilities and gifts.  And thank you for Tony's um, action films.""

Sorry, off track.  I thought Scott's editing and cuts were great, I was really surprised at how good a job he did.

The acting is great, what else would you expect from Denzel?  It wasn't Oscar worthy, but it was a great performance and with anyone else it probably would have not have been as good of a story.

The story.  Its a bit confusing, but not confusing enough to be scratching your head over.  Basically, there is a government program that can look 4 and a half days into the past(theres more to it than that, but its too hard to explain).  Denzel falls in love with a lady(Paula Patton) who is a victim in a ferry explosion.  There are some fabulous scenes, such as the Ferry, the car chase, and the room with the computer.

Overall this movie has a little bit of everything: Humor, action, suspense, great CG, and a bit of a love story thrown in.  Go see this movie, I was surprised at how well it worked and this is the type of movie anyone can enjoy.",1164326400,2,1783,4.388379204892966
1592961,4,B00005JPD0,"I found Tony Scott's ""Deja Vu"" incredibly fascinating, but I don't really understand why; many of the plot elements are based on the ideas and theories presented in science fiction stories, all of which are completely implausible, let alone unrealistic. And yet, for some inexplicable reason, the film works as a whole. It's both a crime thriller and a sci-fi marvel, a combination that has only recently found its niche in cinematic narrative (such as Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report""). The story is founded on the idea that deja vu--the strange sensation of familiarity in a new circumstance--is more than just a trick of the mind. It's actually a phenomenon resulting from an unprecedented scientific discovery: the ability to literally look into the past. What an intriguing concept, especially when it can be used to prevent a crime from happening. It may be impossible, but my God, it's entertaining.

The film begins with the explosion of a New Orleans ferryboat, one that was carrying over five hundred people, specifically military officers and their families. Brought on to the scene is Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington), an ATF officer with a keen eye for detail. In attempting to discover the identity and whereabouts of the terrorist, he learns of a murdered woman named Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), and right away, it's clear that she's somehow connected. For one thing, her body was found in the same river where the boat exploded. Furthermore, half of her body is burnt, and the fingers of her right hand are missing, seemingly because of the flying debris. But Carlin knows that she's more than just one victim of a nautical tragedy; something more sinister befell this woman, and he intends to find out what.

This is where the odd occurrences begin piling up, and if you're not watching closely, you'll leave the theater feeling more confused than satisfied. Consider the scene when Carlin searches Claire's apartment; her refrigerator is adorned with letter magnets, and they spell the message, ""U Can Sav Her."" Who exactly is this message for? Who's sending it? What does it mean? Also consider the moment when Carlin checks her answering machine; it contains one of his own messages from earlier in the day. He called because he was given a phone number from an unknown person, one who supposedly wanted to speak to him. How does this make any sense? For most of the film, it makes no sense at all; the woman who left the number would be found dead only hours later.

Bear with me, because that's just the start of the film's cryptic, cyclical nature. Carlin meets Agent Pyzwarra (Val Kilmer) and is immediately appointed to a special unit of the FBI, one that has access to special surveillance footage (supposedly obtained by top secret satellites orbiting the earth). Despite the fact that the material is four days old, the operators have the ability to view any person from any angle. How is such a thing possible when no surveillance equipment is present? Carlin begins to suspect something as he views footage of Claire; she has moments when she feels as if someone is watching her, and it's making her uneasy. His suspicions are confirmed when she actually sees the light of his laser pointer shining through the screen: he's looking into the actual past, not just recorded footage of it.

The theories behind this technology are far too complicated and wordy for me to cover in-depth. For the sake of simplicity, let's just say that a select group of scientists have found a way to fold the fabric of space, and we can now watch what has already happened. Such a radical new form of security leads to the discovery of Carroll Oerstadt (Jim Caviezel), a militant psychotic who holds a grudge against the American government. It also leads to a pretty outrageous idea: if one can look into the past, then can one actually change the past? Carlin is willing to give it a try, not only because he wants to save the people on the ferry, but because he wants to save Claire, as well. Of course, doing so will require him to be physically transported into the past, an act that's more than a little dangerous (according to the lab technicians, anyway). Will he be able to save the day, or are his actions an echo of events that have already transpired?

You've probably noticed that I've been asking a lot of rhetorical questions in this review, but short of revealing the outcome, there's no other way of summarizing the plot of ""Deja Vu."" This is the kind of film that forces you to observe every single detail, no matter how minute or insignificant it may appear. Even if you are paying close attention, I can assure you that a couple of important things will come as a surprise by the end. For the sake of complete understanding--or, at the very least, for the sake of avoiding confusion--you may have to see this movie more than once. I'm considering doing that; even though I understood everything that happened, I'm almost positive that I missed some key details.

If such mind-engaging material is too much for those who merely want to escape in a story, then avoid ""Deja Vu."" This goes double for those who seek plausible uses of science and technology; as entertaining as I found this film, it relied a little too heavily on suspension of disbelief. It's far too difficult to accept any of these ideas as possibilities, especially since they were included in a crime drama. Tony Scott was able to pull it off this time, and that's why I'm giving the film four stars. But I have a feeling that other director's may not be as lucky with such material; the genres are simply too different to allow for a completely cohesive narrative. If another such film is attempted, then here's hoping for the best.",1164326400,4,5738,4.7734138972809665
1592962,4,B00005JPD0,"Everyone's had that feeling of deja vu, right? That unsettling sensation that you've done this before, or said this before, or have seen this before - but you just can't pinpoint it? DEJA VU (French for ""already seen"") takes that unsettling sensation and comes up with an incredible explanation: time travel. Now, I love time travel stories, and I'm also a fan of Denzel Washington, so it was a no-brainer that I check this one out. DEJA VU is the third movie in which Tony Scott directs Denzel Washington (the other two were CRIMSON TIDE and MAN ON FIRE, two excellent films). With DEJA VU, Scott and Washington come up with another searingly pulse-pounding thriller.

The plot revolves around ATF agent Doug Carlin's attempt to solve two cases: the terrorist bombing of a New Orleans ferry which causes more than 500 fatalities and the murder of a woman whose corpse had washed ashore an hour before the ferry explosion. In his investigation, Carlin ends up working with a federal surveillance agency which boasts a new hush-hush toy, called Snow White. Using key space satellites and a high-tech program, this agency is able to somehow look back in time for the past four days and six hours and witness a constant stream of selected events unfold on various monitors and screens, complete with crystal clear video and audio. However, Carlin and the agency discover that the individuals being watched can sometimes feel their invisible eyes (thus, partly explaining the feeling of deja vu). That leads to Carlin questioning just how far they can affect the past, which then takes up the rest of the movie. I'm trying not to give away any more of the twists and turns, so I think I'll stop right here with the plot breakdown.

DEJA VU is a gripping film which will elicit some conversation from the viewers after it's over. Now, the first half of the film is set at a leisurely pace as, for much of the time, Carlin and the surveillance group are busy, well...surveilling; it doesn't go into overdrive until almost an hour into it. The intellectual sci-fi/fantasy aspect is meshed nicely with enough action and suspense to satisfy both the high- and low-brow audience. One standout action sequence showcases Denzel in a metal-rending car chase as he pursues a vehicle from the past, meanwhile still destructively maneuvering his way thru traffic in the present. Some very nice automobile bashing.

Denzel Washington, of course, drives this movie with another forceful and charismatic performance. Denzel, as everyone knows, can certainly bring in the scene-chewing intensity with the best of 'em. In fact, the implausible premise and plot would  totally come off as ridiculous were it not for Washington's credibility. Denzel's fiercely cool and intelligent acting persona of past films proves to be crucial here as the audience instantly buys into the likable actor's character. His ATF agent, like most of his past roles, is very capable, independent, intelligent, and not at all gullible, so when he gets over his skepticism and finally accepts the reality of the time machine concept, the audience is right there with him.

But Denzel's not the only one who dazzles here. Paula Patton is really convincing as the beautiful, angelic victim. She could pass for Rosario Dawson's sister, she's so fine. And that smile! It isn't hard to see why she left such an indelible impression on Denzel's character. Val Kilmer is effectively subdued, while Adam Goldberg provides the funny. James Caviezel, on the other hand, strays pretty far from Christhood. It's a good cast.

So what if the ending might make veteran time-travel aficionados erupt with a ""Say what?"" or a ""Now, wait just a minute!""? Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Tony Scott combine their vast experience of professional film-making to come up with yet another patented slick looking effort. With an intriguing ""what if?"" premise, some very riveting sequences, combined with the wistfully romantic touch of LAURA and the skills brought along by an acting superstar and a winsome, gorgeous female lead, DEJA VU is a bonafide thinking man's knuckle gnawer. So, yeah...go see it.",1164240000,6,4145,5.0087082728592165

Sure, it was a bit hard to follow here and there because anything involving time, travel or otherwise, usually seems to require one to relax and go with the flow of the story to avoid getting a headache. It's science fiction, so don't get all flustered if you don't find it realistic. Nobody asked you to invent the technology to go back in time.

1593821,5,B00005JPD0,"I especially enjoy the mix of drama, science fiction and science fact. Of course, Denzel Washington is perfect. Director Tony Scott ,  along  with producer Jerry Bruckheimer combined with the writng magic of Bill Marselli have a crime to solve in retrospective. A hyper zealous military reject blows up a ferry in the middle of the mississippi river, leaving hundreds of dead bodies. Special agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington )(Training Day, Crimson Tide, Fallen),  is called in to put the pieces together and analyze what happened, from the wreakage. Tony Scott used real footage, with real stunts, not trick photography and not CGI to create the explosion.  The combined collaboration of the FBI, local police, and ATF are called in to investigate. I especially loved the use of the high tech, secretive  government surveillance system to augment the existing crime lab equipment to solve the crime quickly. However,  the investigation becomes increasing complicated because of the dead woman on the slab in the morgue, whose emergence from the muddy river becomes linked to the bombing of the ferry. Carlin informs the team that when they solve who killed the woman, they will know who the bomber is too.
With the use of the high tech time machine, the Atf team, along with the scientist  at the crime lab, have a window of opportunity. The 3D  high definition camera, linked via satelitte, allows for one look in time. They can not rewind, but they can travel in time. So they push the bounds of science . According to Scott, ""Time is like another character in the movie"". I especially like the car chase with the ""Time Goggles"", that enable Doug Carlin to drive the Hummer in real time, with the goggles mounted he goes back in time to the actual day of the murder and catch the killer Carol Ornstadt, before he commits the bombing and the murder of Claire Kuchever played by Paula Patton. I also like the weird allusion to ""Love"" that magically adds a very supernatural element to the movie. It takes palce in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina devasted the entire Gulf region. There is a feeling that the catastrophe permeates the essence of the movie. The funeral scene, when Claire's father gives the eulogy, and the music, sad and haunting in the backround, lend an feeling of great sadness, a life lost, taken, so young. This element is like she embraces the detective , even from the grave, to find her killer. I liked that this pushes the detective very hard. Plus, as everyone,  Doug carlin in particular, becaome emotionally involved with every aspect of her life because the equipment enables the cameras to see through walls, as if they are moving through walls.  The satalittes that roam the stratosphere capture images, and put the images together to build a picture of the past, so they can zero in, and move in and out of the time widow.  The huge leap, stretch as leverage, is when , after the perp is caught, and Doug is removed from the case, he enlist the help of the lead scientist, a very cool, down to earth scientist who breaks all protocol to send Doug back in time, and thats the scence with the time goggles.
I enjoyed this movie.  It is believable that this technology is the state of the art and science has the potential to take crime prevention to the next level... for real...",1479081600,,3317,4.729636048526863

The premise of the movie was an updated spin on time travel, however the plot literally had Denzel's character was literally cyber stalking a woman to find answers before it was too late to save her, prevent a domestic terrorist attack, and catch the perpetrator. His character seemed to be obsessed with her. That was the part of the movie that I really disliked.

The cinematography of Katrina ravaged, New Orleans was evident in lots of the scenes.

It was entertaining and I overall enjoyed it.",1466380800,,734,4.503759398496241

1594436,4,B00005JPD0,"There are lots of good things about this movie, but it still falls into the same trap most time-travel movies fall into.

Supposedly you can only peek into the past. You can't go there. But later the movie breaks its own rule because filmmakers just can't let a character stay dead.

Also, its happy ending is a sham. In a time travel movie, sometimes there seems to be *two* of a certain character. But it's actually one person, just at different ages.

SPOILER

The two Denzels are four days apart. The older one dies.

Well, four days later, the younger one will *become* the older one.

That means there's no chance the two characters will live happily ever after.

They have a maximum of four days together, and then one will die.

(No one making the movie seems to have realized this.)",1465084800,,791,4.52112676056338

It is one of those movies I enjoy watching several times, because each time I see it, I pick up some minute detail I missed before that links parts of the story together in other ways.

Film borders on outsmarting itself, but very entertaining and keeps moving. Story flaws are minimal and forgiveable.

Imaginative twists and creative, sidewinding plot recoveries make this film very enjoyable and worth watching multiple times, even if to just close gaps or mend loops in your own head.

One thrilling sequence has Denzel using headgear that allows him to see video of the past through one eyepiece while seeing the present though the other, WHILE DRIVING.

1595394,4,B00005JPD0,"It's a Jerry Bruckheimer produced movie so the explosions mayhem is loud for those using Dolby 5.1 audio setup. James Caviezel demonstrates his acting skills as a sinister character in this film. Paula Patton does a good job, but those ""Fatal Attraction"" ""Alex Forrest"" characters don't come along much for women actors. It seems there is nothing to distinguish a lot of female actor roles. It's like the roles are interchangeable, just use a different face. It seems, if a woman character doesn't speak southern, chances are you won't be very impressed. I am biased about this film because I am a very long time James Caviezel fan. After seeing ""Thin Red Line"", I was hooked.",1443225600,,676,4.836206896551724

I especially liked Jim Cavaziel as the protagonist bomber and the concept of the ""each bomb has its destiny"", and the momentum of certain acts which are hard to stop and cause other ripples in the fabric of time.

Denzel plays a detective in the movie and gets call in on a mass murder that takes place on a fairy boat. They find that one on the victims was murdered early and her car was used for the bombs. Denzel fines out that the F.B. I has a special machine that they can look in the past to see what someone did. So he gets them to go back to when the victim was in her apartment. While they are watching, Denzel gets a call from another detective tell him that his fingerprints are all over her apartment. Knowing that he didn't know this victim he starts to think and has them to some test with this machine. He has them go back to where she is in her apartment and he flashes a light into her apartment and she see it. He writes a message and has them go back to a day in his office. He puts the message in this machine,  see if it gets back to that day and it does. He then finds out all the other things that this machine can do. They have a headset that they can have a person wear while drive to follow what someone is doing. Denzel decides that he might be able to go back in time himself and save these all these people. He gets one of the operators that run this machine to help him and it works. What a good movie.",1418169600,,1335,3.89010989010989

1596363,4,B00005JPD0,"This is quite an interesting film mixing the thriller genre with bits of science fiction. The film is quite good overall, though doesn't quite reach it's full potential it is still worthy of a watch.

The story starts off with ATF Special Agent Douglas Carlin (Denzel Washington) being sent to help investigate a terrorist bombing of a ferry carrying U.S. Navy sailors and their families, in which hundreds of people are killed in the explosion. Carlin teams up with FBI Agent Paul Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) and both start to try to piece together the events using more traditional investigation methods.

They soon find that an apparently unrelated incident involving the murder of Claire Kuchever (played by Paula Patton ) has a lot more to do with the ferry bombing than another murder case that happened to be at the same time frame as the bombing.

This is where the science fiction bit slips in, and depending on how you like your films it's either a good move or makes the plot somewhat stretched. It comes to light that there is a secret super high tech surveillance program called ""Snow White"", which allows the investigating team to look back into the past. The storyline unfolds using a mix of present and past events, with a view to trying to stop the bombing happening in the first place via time travel. It's similar in some respects (but not all) to the arguably better ""Source Code"" which was made some years later in 2011.

Despite the conveniently dropped in science fiction twist, which may explain the mixed reaction from critics, Deja Vu is both well acted with good performances from the cast which features Jim Caviezel doing a respectable job of the bomber Carroll Oerstadt, direction is strong with Tony Scott providing some nice action sequences and effective camera work.

Having watched the film a few times since release I still quite enjoy it, though as is common with these time travel genre films once the first watch is over, some impact is lost in subsequent viewings. Some folks will feel the sci fi time travel aspect is a bit silly, and some might like the unusual twist this provides to the plot. I'm not sure the ending is as strong as it could be, but it remains a fairly interesting production, though it's a little long at just over 2 hours, I didn't get bored watching it.

Worth checking out if you are in the mood for something a bit different",1414627200,2,2385,4.68019093078759
1596364,5,B00005JPD0,Wow! Incredible film... Amazing amount of research coupled with imagination has gone into this film. Don't miss it! (of course it never hurts to have Denzel),1414540800,,157,5.076923076923077

1596367,5,B00005JPD0,"""Deja Vu"" has an excellent cast--OK anything with Denzel is going to be worth watching--but Jim Caveizel plays the lone wolf psychopath to a tee and the woman who plays Claire shines as well in an affecting combination of vulnerability, intelligence and grit--not easy. The supporting cast of familiar faces, including Val Kilmer-gone-to-seed makes this an almost wonderful ensemble effort.

Tony Scott renders New Orleans, after Katrina and trembling on the brink of a horrific domestic terrorist disaster, as a damaged place, energetic with hybrid vigor but also still a setting in which awful things happen. Scott delivers a thoughtful time travel film, without a lot of ohh-ing and aawi-ng over hardware, with enough action to qualify as a detective noir thriller. Not quite as moody or self-reflexive as ""Chinatown,"" but close.

A smart film neglected, I suspect, because it manages to be both exciting and understated. Everyone involved, cast, crew, director and producers seem to know they're outside the box, but kudos all around for stepping away from all to easy, Hollywood blockbuster formulas.",1413676800,,1105,5.308571428571429

1596647,3,B00005JPD0,"3.5 could be an option, barring that, just 3. Honestly, the movie was not bad. Yet, although as a story the movie had an amazing prospect, it kind of fell short. It's a hard topic, to use the time paradox in any movie. The director took a brave step trying to combine mundane with the lofty idea of philosophy as well as metaphysics--intentionally or not. However, in trying to create an entertainment, he failed to address some fundamental question so common for any story involves time travel. Yet, in a way it does: the movie seems to tell us that each moment we live on the verge of falling into many possible realities, which are open to take shape based on the steps we take. Does the present leads to the future, or the future pulls the past towards itself?",1408060800,,764,4.464285714285714

I've been on a Denzel kick recently, as most of his movies, while maybe not particularly memorable, are usually entertaining.
Most folks I know that have seen a lot of his movies had not seen / heard of this one, so I'm passing the DVD around.

I enjoyed watching him unravel the crime, coming at it from a different angle rather than trying to solve the main tragedy of the movie.

I do tend to watch a number of documentaries etc. on space / time, etc. and thought the movie did a rather good job of forcing you to think or consider possibilities based on current scientific understanding of the same.

Highly recommended if you're looking for a murder / mystery, with some sci-fi thrown in.

They lost me very quickly, but if I can be led to believe that detective Dick Powell could come back as a dog to catch a killer why not believe that Denzel Washington can back to try. After all, Washington is a better actor than Powell was, even though the latter's  mid-career reincarnation as a tough detective was one of my favorites at the time.

Denzel Washington's ATF agent is placed in one of these unusual situations in this film.  Using a government facility that is able to send a single person back in time to the very recent past, Denzel's character strives to prevent a tragedy.  In doing so, he encounters a attractive young woman whose life may be in jeopardy.

The way in which he meets this woman and falls in love with her is fascinating!  Also wonderful is the demeanor that Denzel's character assumes when he risks his life to thwart the villain.  Unlike heroes in trivial stories, he shows instantly relatable fear and anxiety in the face of this evil--which makes his courageous acts all the more compelling!",1369526400,,904,4.689873417721519

Time travel has been done to death, if you are going to do it, you need to put an interesting twist into it. This did not happen as film is so similar to other movies that it comes down to more of the same. I am thinking to myself would it really be a better world if only bad things could be reversed? The other problem is the story itself is not consistent, it is claimed that a person cannot go back in time but yet someone does.

To me, there is an added problem that I do not like Denzel Washington as an actor. His holier-than-thou with his superior and self-righteous attitude I find obnoxious. Having said that I think he is a good actor as is Paula Patton.

The only character I found really absorbing was the terrorist.  At least, he had something engaging to say although parts of the terrorist speech do not make sense unless you assume he knows something about time travel.

1597861,3,B00005JPD0,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Deja Vu"" starring Denzel Washington. The highlights of the movie were some really spectacular explosions. How do they ever do it? The destruction was awesome with mayhem, dead bodies and wreckage everywhere. Making movies like this must cost a fortune. In any case, Denzel Washington was a chief investigator whose task was to go back into the past, with the aid of a hocus-pocus machine, and study the event and how it came about. Well, I have a problem with this. Traveling back and forth through time is an imaginative concept, to be sure, but there is not even the faintest evidence that this has ever happened or ever will. My mind is simply unable to cope with such a happening and any story in which time travel is an important part is impossible for me to watch. I don't mean to be hostile. It's just the way I'm wired. I'm somewhat in envy of people who can relax and enjoy this type of thing.

Well, the movie had a nice brisk pace to the drivel and was well directed. The acting was rather good and Val Kilmer was especially fun to watch. The special effects were spectacular to say the least and the movie used up a load of really expensive equipment. It's an action-adventure story that may be enjoyed by many. I'm just not one of them. To me, I could hardly wait for the movie to end and the story was so bad that I seriously considered not even writing a review, and reviewing is one of my major hobbies. But, that's just me. Have fun and enjoy your trip.

Any story based on the premise of time travel is ultimately absurd, since the very idea raises so many conundrums and logical fallicies as to make time travel seem ridiculous as a plot mechanism. The one exception to that statement is Jules Verne's Time Machine, which was more credible than any time travel saga since. In this film, not even the ivy-league physicists who concocted the whole scheme in the film can make anything more than crude sophomoric observations about the mechanics of time. Nevertheless, the film is well-made and creates a credible story line as long as one is willing to suspend disbelief in the utter silliness of time travel in the first place. The personal relationship between the stars adds another entertaining dimension, and the film ends up being fun and suspenseful, for which I credit the director and cast if not the writers.",1361318400,2,1093,4.8138297872340425

It's tightly plotted, with great effects, the science fiction premise carefully introduced and kept plausible.

Philosophically, the movie grapples with the difficulty of changing destiny, and it's from this difficulty that the movie derives a tension that arches over the immediate problems faced by the main character. By turns it appears that he has, and then hasn't, been able to change fate for the victim the movie begins with.

1598347,3,B00005JPD0,"this is basically a good popcorn film; a blend of thriller, action, and the paranormal genres. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Tony Scott, it boasts a first rate cast (Denzel Washington, Paula Patton, Jim Caviezel, and Val Kilmer) and backs them with solid production values. It was the first film shot in New Orleans after Katrina. The story centers on a terrorist bombing of a ferry carrying navy sailors with their families during shore leave.  Washington stars as an ATF agent who is pulled into a federal task force using proprietary technology to reconstruct the crime scene in ways never thought possible. Interestingly, the technology is not totally dissimilar to the machine later created in the television series ""Person of Interest."" Just about the time you permit yourself to buy into the believability of that technology, the plot takes things to a whole new level of incredulity involving time travel. Without providing too much in the way of plot spoilers, the ending is satisfyingly happy. The plot clearly requires the viewer to set aside issues such as credibility. However, it does move a long at a sufficiently fast pace, and I found the acting, production, and suspense sufficiently interesting to permit me to enjoy the film for what it is-- a fun two hours.

As far as the Blu-Ray disc is concerned, it looked and sounded good in a high end home theater. I never saw it on DVD and cannot comment on any technical comparisons between the two formats.",1349395200,,1486,4.892857142857143

1598352,4,B00005JPD0,"Deja Vu(released Nov/06)stars Denzel Washington as  ATF agent Doug Carlin,Val Kilmer as FBI agent Paul Pryzwarra and James Caviezel as Carroll Oerstadt,the bomber. This is a taut thriller set in today but with an intriguing futuristic twist,guaranteed to keep you enthralled from beginning to end.
The setting is New Orleans and the place there is the Algiers Ferry dock. The ferry is loaded with armed forces personnel out in celebration and shortly after it leaves the dock,there is a huge explosion,condemning over 500 souls to their doom. Enter agent Carlin who is there investigating the carnage. He is an agent who is extremely on the ball and attention to detail is his fort.
During his probing a woman's body is found washed up on a nearby shore. It is first assumed it is just another body from the explosion,but its`placement on shore in conjunction to the boats demise is impossible as it would have to have floated there against the tide. Not only that but the ends of the fingers of one hand have been removed. Carlin attends the autopsy to find out the body was evidently placed there before the explosion and had nothing to do with the ferry blast;or did it?
Enter FBI man Pryzwarra who entreats Carlin to join in their investigation. He takes Carlin to some office where a group of folks are looking at seemingly real time four day old footage of the ferry,from any angle they choose and with sound. He is first told this is just new satellite techno stuff,but the explanation doesn't sit well with him. He goes along only so far until they are looking at the woman whose body was found,and who they have since identified,but is now alive,being,supposedly,four days before. The woman comments that she thinks she's being watched. Carlin pulls out a laser pen and points it into the picture,and the woman sees it. Carlin realizes what he is seeing is more than what they're telling him. It is finally revealed that this is top secret technology government researchers stumbled upon previously,and are now using for the first time here.
With Carlin fully in the picture,as it were,he is now able to identify the bomber,arrest him and learn what his steps were before and leading up the actual event. The team also sends Carlin a message into the past to help him stop the bombing before it happened,but it doesn't reach him and instead his partner gets it,and gets himself killed following the lead. Carlin then asks for himself to be sent back in time. Although never done with a human before he takes a terrible risk. He travels back to the day of the bombing but at a hospital,where he is revived as his heart stopped,as it was feared would happen. Once out of the hospital he saves the woman and together they tackle the problem at hand;stopping the bomber. They arrive at the ferry dock and the woman disobeys Carlin's pleadings to stay behind. She gets captured and tied to the steering wheel of the truck with explosives in it,but between her and Carlin they take the bomber down. They drive the truck off the ferry but only the women escapes and Carlin gets killed in the explosion.
In the aftermath the woman is told by authorities to sit tight while an agent is coming to interrogate her about the explosion. The agent comes and the movie fades to black.
The movie,produced in conjunction with Jerry Bruckheimer,is well crafted and ably directed by Tony Scott. The film is in an off colour sepia-like tone which enhances the movies feel throughout. Washington has got game as has the entire cast. I always like movies that start out going in one direction but branch off and head in another,and this is one of them. The original Predator,where a group of army types is on a rescue mission and are later fighting for their lives against of all things,an alien,is just one example. This movie starts off as a ""routine"" investigation of a terrorist act in New Orleans,then suddenly vaults into the realm of Sci Fi with the use of secret government controlled time travel. And thanks to the great direction and editing,and attention to detail,the film works on alot of different levels.
Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 2:35:1. It's clear and crisp and includes commentary,a featurette,and deleted and extended scenes.
All in all a highly recommended bit of filmmaking by the late Tony Scott(I never thought I would be saying that about a director whose works I really admired),who passed much too soon. This film will have you on the edge of your seats from start to finish.",1347408000,,4518,4.755414012738854

1598475,1,B00005JPD0,"Apparently, Tony Scott isn't much of a director.  In this movie, all that matters are the special effects.  CGI must reign supreme over script, storyline, continuity, and semi-reality.  The movie itself is quite a mess.  How can I count the ways?

First of all, the chase scenes are not suspenseful at all.  No character development left me not caring about any of the characters, particularly Denzel's character.  I saw no point in the movie for Val Kilmer's character.  His reason for being in the movie defies explanation.  Bruce Greenwood is only in the movie for 5 minutes or less and his character is also pointless.

Secondly, the autopsy scene: there is NO WAY in the world the dead woman would look that good after washing up on the beach.  She was still wearing mascara, nothing was wrong with her face, eyes.  Unbelieveable when the filmmakers go to no effort to make her look like a corpse.  Completely stupid scene.

Third, Denzel's character runs around town supposedly ""chasing"" the bad guy but not really!?!  That is about the gist of the whole plot and it is not interesting enough to watch for two hours or more.  There seems to be no compelling reason for anything, including going back in time.  The real turkey is when, of course very predictably, Denzel cannot save his partner's life, but the girl he is lusting after -- she gets saved via his time travel.  It is a tired plot line that dragged on endlessly.  Then, when the bag is removed from the girl's face, she should have been in shock, but she ""recovered"" after less than 5 minutes.  Unrealistic, just like every other scene in this film.

Fourth and finally, I enjoyed Jim Caviziel as a murderer but not in the end scene when he was on the ferry.  At that point, when he saw that lady again, (and if this movie had even a grain of realistic storyline in it) he would have shot her and been done with it.  There was NO REASON whatsoever to tie her up, put her in the SUV, and leave the keys in the ignition so that she could run over him.  How stupid, contrived and unimaginative was that plot hole?  Viewers of action movies want at least SOME dose of common sense and the ending to this movie was extremely lame.

Skip this one.  Denzel has made some turkeys in the last few years, but this one gobbles worse than most!  If you want to see a good Denzel movie, I would recommend ""Man on Fire.""",1340582400,4,2375,4.473193473193473
1598476,4,B00005JPD0,"This movie has been publicized in a way that makes it sound like a paranormal fantasy story. But the fact is, there is a science-fiction type explanation for why ATF agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) knows what's going to happen. I can't explain it rationally, because I don't really understand, so don't worry about a spoiler in that direction.

What really gets Doug involved in this situation is not just his job: it's the beautiful Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) whom he first sees as a corpse. But if he can change the course of events, she will survive. He's motivated.

The basic story is a huge explosion on a ferry boat in New Orleans that kills over 800 people. Agent Carlin is there to investigate, discovers that it was caused by a bomb, and begins to track the bomber. He is soon asked to join a highly classified research team that may be able to help. Here's where the science fiction part comes in, and is probably designed to confuse you.

There's plenty of wild chases and explosions and gun play, if that's the sort of thing you like. But there's a great deal more to the story than that. In fact, I found much of the mayhem a distraction from trying to follow the story line when it refuses to stay linear.

Denzel goes back in time to save a young woman's life and to stop a ferry from being blown up by a terrorist. I love the way little details came together after Denzel traveled backwards (bloody rags at Claire's apartment, the ambulance in the burned out structure, etc).

Unfortunately Val Kilmer added nothing to this movie.

Even though the end results were predictable I still enjoyed the film. Everything worked for me except the final, sappy-sweet ending. How did Denzel pull that off? Who saved him? It confused me further, but I still liked the movie.

1598484,4,B00005JPD0,"I first ordered another Denzel Washington movie, Out of Time, and realized I wanted Deja Vu.  He is great in both movies and always plays a neat police role.  Not sure why he needs to get shot or blown up in his roles but it does provide for an interesting plot.  Then there are the attractive women in his movies.

With TV quality going down, I am more inclined to add to my video library and this is a movie I can watch again and again.  If you like action movies with requiring some intelligence you will enjoy this one a lot.

It examines the problem of a terrible terrorist attack with a new angle and Densil Washington's character asks why are we just watching when we should do something about it.  It has a good concept based in science and explores the posibilities.  Good acting and filming, a well paced chase thriller.",1304467200,,344,4.796610169491525
1598617,4,B00005JPD0,"This is the first movie that I have streamed on my laptop from Amazon and the first movie I've rented from Amazon.  It streamed with no glitches, good video and strong sound.  The purchase was quick and it began streaming immediately.

The movie was fun and interesting to watch.  Denzel was great.  Paula Patton was too.  And I've had a soft spot for Val Kilmer since Top Gun although the only other thing he's ever done (that I've seen) that is worth noting is Tombstone (in which he was brilliant.) This movie is worth the rental price even for someone like me who cancelled my satellite subscription because paying for TV is kind of wasteful.

Once football season is over, who needs live TV?  I would rather pay for the occasional movie to stream and for some Netflix DVD rentals.  Then I can watch what I want when I have the time instead having full-time cable TV.  Even if I rent TV shows and movies galore I will be hard pressed to spend the same amount I spent on my satellite TV bill each month.

For others who are somewhat new to this streaming thing, I can tell you that I tried renting from Amazon today in hopes that I can have multiple options for my new entertainment way of life. I don't want to be bound to iTunes, Netflix, Hulu or any single source exclusively.  Now, off I go to look for something else to stream from Amazon.  Maybe I'll check one of the movies that's free w/ my Prime membership.

By the way, the prices here are comparable to iTunes but the 48-hr rental period is preferable by far.  I love watching movies from my iPad but the 24-hour limit on iTunes stinks so I'm look for an alternative!  I rarely watch a movie in one sitting.  Now, I hope Amazon gets to the point where I can download a movie rental so I can watch something I rented while I'm on an airplane or stuck somewhere else with time on my hands but no high-speed internet connection.

The idea (or people science) might not be possible/real in today's world, but the movie makes it believable - that the the most important part as many movies have too many holes prompt too many questions during the movies. But the two most important things about this movie are that the director does a great job (1) filling any possible holes and (2) keep the movie going quickly so there isn't anytime for you to sit there and look for the flaws. That is why this movie is soooo good. It is very fast paced, great cinematography, great character development and great acting. I loved the movie when I saw it in DVD, but the bluray disk just kick it up another notch. It is one big roller coaster that at the end of the movie you will be like ""wow"".

1598623,5,B00005JPD0,"This isn't an overly deep movie, but it deals with issues of time travel, causality, determinism, destiny, limits of science, and multiple universes in a manner which I found both new and intriguing.  The science is surely flawed in ways that a cosmologist would be quick to point out, but any such flaws aren't glaring enough to ruin the movie.  Related to this, the time travel aspect created the usual logical paradoxes (if not outright contradictions), but they weren't severe enough to render the plot incoherent, and I like the way the movie kept me trying to figure out what was going on and what might happen next, right up to the very end.

Regarding the acting, as always, the character portrayed by Denzel Washington comes across as smart and commanding.  I can't recall Denzel ever having disappointed me.  I suppose Val Kilmer was also OK, though his role was very minor and dispensable - probably just there to help bring in revenue.  The other actors were also adequate, except that the character representing the co-star's father was implausibly unemotional, whereas the co-star herself was pretty good (and pretty too).

Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone interested in an action-packed detective movie which covers some rather intriguing themes.  Though it won't become a classic, this movie was still entertaining enough to warrant 5 stars in my book.",1278374400,3,1377,5.008771929824562

1598719,5,B00005JPD0,"Dj Vu, starring Denzel Washington, is a heavy action, suspenseful thriller that will keep viewers captivated and pushes them to the edge of their seats as Doug Carlin (Washington) is racing against time to do the impossible: alter the past. The film in located in the southern United States, where several crimes fueling the movie's story line, take place. Dj Vu is packed with action, romance, and the thrill of a time governed adventure.
 The movie starts abruptly with the explosion of a ferry carrying hundreds of celebrating southern folks celebrating a return from war. Doug Carlin, an investigator in the area is located at the scene of the crime where he meets a girl, Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), who will later evolve into one of the main protagonists of the movie. Carlin is turned on to the criminal responsible for the death of Claire a little bit later in the movie. Throughout the film, Carlin seeks to find the corrupt suspect. Happening to come along a top-secret government project involving a highly intricate time altering system which can see into the past, Carlin teams up with a few of the guys working there to try to solve the mystery. The time device sees exactly 4 days into the past, which is a highly time sensitive disadvantage. Using the film captured from the past, Doug traces the criminal who plans to kill Claire. Carling must keep up with him in order to halt his operations before they turn deadly.
 Several important factors prove crucial in the plot and desired suspense of the film. The ingenious concept of the delicate fold in time adds a bit of positive confusion for the viewer. This allows the viewer to contemplate the concept to fully understand the film. This unique trick gets the audience thinking deeper into the complexity of the movie. The director, Tony Scott, does very well in this aspect, but also the acting. Denzel Washington played an exemplary part in the movie, his ability to create an extremely convincing illusion of sheer skill and adventure. Washington's convincing performance did well drawing in the theatergoers to keep them intrigued as to what will happen next. James Cavielzel played the part of the antagonist in the film, Carroll Oerstadt. Caviezel's performance, too, was very convincing and creates a harsh tension between Washington's character as well as the audience.
 Dj vu, as a whole, drew me into the action. Throughout the film, I found myself drawn into the action, complete with a pulsing heart rate and a real connection to the characters. The special affects and the all around hair raising experience gave the movie a great feel. The advanced technology featured in the movie was laid out so well, it would have been surprising to know it was not real. In my personal opinion, Dj Vu is a must see for any avid adventure film addict. The movie never ceases to amaze in the way that you never really know just what will happen next. I challenge anyone who doubts the quality of this movie to see it, I guarantee, you will not regret it. Undoubtedly, four stars. ****",1264032000,,3057,4.807984790874524
1598720,3,B00005JPD0,"This film is nearly three years old but still drawing considerable comment. That should tell you something. For all its flaws, this movie is an enjoyable, fast moving action thriller that's worth the viewing.

The ""science"" itself relies on a science fiction cliche which doesn't hold up in reality. If you know the real science behind wormholes, the plot device may bother you to the point that your enjoyment of the movie will be lessened. But if you can allow yourself the ""willing suspension of disbelief"", you'll have an enjoyable experience.

Denzel Washington is one of the finest actors of our time and he shows why in this movie. His character provides the moral center and action focus of this movie. Denzel's riveting performance makes this man come alive as you see the plot unfold from his viewpoint, drawing you in and keeping you focused.

Val Kilmer is a disappointment in the way he plods through the movie. He reads his lines, but that's about it. Paula Patton does a fine job, creating a believable, vulnerable character, such that you really care about her fate. The actor who plays her father has a small role but a key one. His scenes are small but crucial, and he does a fine job.

Tony Scott's ability to craft an action thriller makes the best use of Denzel's talents and the talents of all the cast. The story moves along, never dragging nor jumping too much, and the action sequences keep you completely engaged. Scott does a fine job of combining a good action film with a well done human story. For all his technical skill, he never makes the big mistake you see in other films such as the Bourne series. In those films, the director is always saying ""Look at me! Look at how I use the camera, or how I x,y,z."" Scott keeps the focus on the story, and uses his considerable skill to let the story tell itself.

It's not a great social statement by any means, but it's an enjoyable evening's movie viewing experience, even with the bogus science.",1263081600,8,1973,4.60968660968661

1598722,4,B00005JPD0,"Tony Scott's Dj Vu (2006) is a film based on a totally unrealistic premise, but is fascinating none the less.  Intricate, very well-written and acted, this film, which is totally wrapped up with the subject of travelling through time, has to be seen more than once to be fully appreciated.

Denzel Washington (Training Day) is ATF agent Doug Carlin, called to investigate an explosion aboard a ferry in New Orleans, that has killed over five hundred.  A dead woman, Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) washes up on shore, and becomes the focus of his investigation, when it appears that her SUV, loaded with explosives, was the source of the explosion.  Working with an FBI investigative team that includes, Agents Paul Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), Jack McCready (Bruce Greenwood), and Dr. Alexander Denny (Adam Goldberg), Carlin discovers that a technology exists that enables the past to be viewed on a computer screen.  Known as Snow White, the team has the ability to look back in time exactly four days and six hours.  Not only can they see the past, but they can see through walls, and at any angle.  The technology is complete and utter fiction, explained with a multitude of scientific babble.  Accept it or not, the presentation is straightforward, drawing you deep into a world of all seeing voyeurism.

The tone is unwaveringly serious, and the atmosphere tinged with darkness.  Things become only more absurd, as the laws of physics are bent further, when a message from the present is sent back to the past, resulting in the death of Carlin's partner.  The team is able to identify and apprehend Carroll Oerstadt (Jim Caviezel), the terrorist responsible for the bomb blast.  The Government is satisfied, but Carlin wants more, he wants to change the past.  With Denny's help, Carlin returns to the past to try and save Claire.  In a quite remarkable way, Carlin, Claire, and Oerstadt relive the past.  It is decidedly different, and almost all the loose ends are tied up.  Reality is given a radical twist, in this most provocative thriller.

Although the story is completely out there, as you might expect in a Tony Scott film, and a Jerry Bruckheimer production, the action sequences are slickly executed and well done.  Denzel Washington is very convincing as a man interested in solving a crime, and obsessed with saving a woman he thinks he knows.  Paula Patton performance is also very good, although her character's transition from victim to action hero is a bit much.  Dj Vu thoroughly plays with your mind from start to finish, and yet at the end, you probably won't mind at all, although it is almost impossible to get the full impact of the film in a single viewing.  The wacky idea of being able to view the past is one matter, but what is perhaps the hardest thing to believe, is that the technology  would be used for law enforcement, rather than to kill, or destroy, or for profit, or to gain power, or further some other dark evil purpose.  The nature of man being what it is, the possibilities are limitless.",1261785600,2,3029,4.79383429672447

1598724,4,B00005JPD0,"The story:
The story is interesting and compelling. It is hard when it needs to be and soft and touching when it should be. It touches many emotions. The plot grabs your imagination and keeps you interested. You do need to give in to the plot concepts to enjoy it the most.

The direction:
What I like most is the way your viewing time and attention is never wasted. The director skips over unnecessary stuff and keeps the story and action moving along. There is not a lot of filler conversation unlike many other movies.

The acting:
The acting is excellent. Denzel is Denzel yet, somehow different. He has a more 'humane' nature in this movie. He is more humble and polite in ways that don't diminish his strength and inner character. I found him to be very believable.

I thought this movie started off quite interesting, as Carling gets his teeth into the investigation, but once the technological parts of film 'kicked in', it got a bit too far fetched for my liking. As the movie progressed it got more and more ridiculous, and I feel the 'technology' bits would have worked better, if it had of been set a few years into the future.

1598859,3,B00005JPD0,"Denzel Washington is one of the finest actors of our time. This film did not reflect those talents and unfortunately the rest of the cast is not developed adequately.

The storyline of going back to prevent the future has been done many times before. The concept was a bit confusing, due to the numerous flashbacks and flashforwards, but it was also not consistent as some other reviewers point out. For instance, why was it that some things stayed the same, when Denzel traveled back, and some were different. You could argue that ""you can't change fate"", but it just was a bit ambiguous. And why was there no reasonable explanation of how this would be applied. Sure, the viewer could speculate, but concrete examples could have added to the story.

Since this is a review for the Blu-Ray it is worth mentioning that the picture and sound quality was excellent. Colors were rich and detail impressive. Amazon, please add a space where we can separately rate the film, and the quality of picture and sound. Sometimes the movie is less than exciting, while the picture is.

Washington stars as an ATF agent investigating the bombing of a ferry, and discovers a victim (the gorgeous Paula Patton) that shouldn't be there.  Soon he discovers a method of looking back into the past when he is recruited by an FBI handler (Val Kilmer), and begins to have feelings for the woman, so much so that he contemplates going back in time and saving her life.  The time travel element could have felt hokey, but it manages to work surprisingly well here, and Scott's visual flair only helps.  What hurts Deja Vu is that it's pretty predictable.  Some of the twists, well, just aren't all that twisty.  Not to mention that when looking at Deja Vu as a pure action movie, it just meanders quite a bit.  However, much of Deja Vu is compelling, and Washington is great as always, and there's solid turns from Kilmer, Patton, Adam Goldberg, and Jim Caviezel to boot.  All in all, Deja Vu is certainly worth a look at the very least, but the end result just doesn't live up to it's potential.",1215993600,,1204,4.593457943925234

1598978,5,B00005JPD0,"A strange film on a very trite and over-used theme. The dedication to New Orleans does not change that fact. After ""Back to the Future"" we cannot accept some of the rather sloppy elements we find in this film. A few examples. At the beginning, thanks to the machine to explore the past, we discover the car with the explosives on the boat did not have a number plate. How can security rules explain the fact that a car without a number plate was allowed on a boat transporting more than 500 people? The terrorist stole a car because he needed one. But he actually had one. So why did he use a stolen one? But the worst part is how the Doug from the future when arriving in the past does all kinds of antics, leaving all kinds of traces behind him in the past, obviously cutting short the plan of the terrorist, and yet the terrorist will fulfill his plan entirely in the first version of the attack, but in the first version still the investigation reveals the Doug from the future has already intervened in the past and hence should have changed the result of the terrorist attack by hijacking it off its normal course. If he was in the girl's apartment before the terrorist attack, leaving his finger prints and his blood everywhere, how could the terrorist succeed in killing the girl and blowing the boat up. And he the Doug from the future dies in the past, that would make him dead for the future. He could not come up alive and start everything like normal after the explosion. If the past is changed, then the future is changed too. If you die, you die and you do not exist any more. And the Doug who died in the explosion will not be able to arrest the terrorist who was killed just before the explosion, both being dead for the future. And if the girl managed to escape from the car when it fell into the Mississippi through a broken window, and she was not trained like a federal agent, how come Doug, a trained federal agent, could not follow suit and get out from the car through the same window? But we can suspend our disbelief and then consider the film as something that does not have to be logical. Pure action. Fine. What's the meaning of this action in 2006, five years after 9/11 and three years after the invasion  of Iraq, not to mention today in 2008? Terrorist attacks in the USA come from white Americans who define themselves as patriots and consider they have to attack the security forces and the people of the USA to make them realize they have to start a third world war to stop the world from changing and to prevent the USA from becoming a second rank nation, and do not forget the USA became the first nation in the world after and thanks to the second world war. And in this scenario, one little bomb can kill more than 500 people. They don't need four or five Boeings to do that. One man alone, properly trained can be a lot more effective than Al Qaeda. That's what you call economy of scales. The second idea is that in such cases the terrorist, when caught, will be buried by the FBI into silence and disappearance because the government will not want details to be given on two subjects. First of all the absolute incapability of the state to protect the territory and the people of the USA. Second the fact that they possess a technology that enables them to reconstruct everything that has happened in a particular place, behind walls, closed doors and any kind of protection. There is no privacy and no protection of privacy in this new hi-tech vision. That is a lot more frightening than a few berserk patriots who consider the death of a few thousand people to be a good thing to arouse consciousness. There, beyond believability, this film is a really scary movie. ""Minority Report"" was frightening but they only read the future, and in the end dropped the technology for political reason. Here it is a lot worse since they can read the past, what really happened. We are trapped 100%. We are under constant surveillance and control by people, forces and agencies we do not even know exist or will exist.

Denzel was superior. Paula Patton is gorgeous and has promise.  She played the helpless victim role well.

I will certainly watch this movie again.",1214697600,,350,4.898305084745763
1598981,3,B00005JPD0,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie.  Sure I saw the previews and it just looked like a crime mystery.  I greatly enjoyed the ""Bone Collector,"" so I thought maybe I would like another starring Denzel.  In fact this movie is way more than that, and that was a pleasant surprise on my end.

Like the preview suggested it starts off with a mystery.  They're trying to find a killer, but Denzel's character gets brought into a top secret fold when other people on site recognize his potential for recognizing major details.  You get brought into a hi-tech world that eventually turns into a time travel twist.  It felt more like it was drawn off of Michael Crichton's ""Timeline"" rather than something like ""12 Monkeys"".  Except, instead of going back to medieval times it's a lot sooner.  The time travel concept has been done before, so on a creative level this movie is nothing new.  The only real difference is that it's directed by the guy who did ""Enemy of the State"", thus it has that kind of cinematography in feel.  The parallel universe/timeline question gets brought up and that whole path was great for me because I really like that kind of stuff.  The only problem I had with the science is when Denzel's character pointed a laser pointer at the screen and the person they were monitoring saw that.  That really didn't make sense to me.  Maybe the writer's thought they were dealing with such an anomalous subject that it would just ""be possible"" in a blanket concept.  It didn't make sense to me because the device that is actually providing them with the time travel ability is in a completely different room and normally technological concepts wouldn't work in such an interactive way, unless the screen was physically a gateway, which it's not because Denzel touches the screen and nothing happens.  Plus to interact with the other time frame they have to physically put something in the device, thus making the laser pointer even more nonsense.

Okay enough of my gripe with the film's technological proposals.  At the very least the movie is quite entertaining, though I did spend some time wondering when Val Kilmer put on that much weight... he's a minor character anyway, kind of a waste for him because he's usually pretty good.  The movie revolves far more around Denzel though, who plays an ATF agent and if you've seen Denzel play one smart alec cop you've seen them all.  This movie is really no different; kind of has some semblance of the same character from ""Inside Man"" if you ask me.  The end of the film is very suspenseful and it's a great feel.  The ending, for me, was a little overly happy in a sense, just because when you're messing with technology that theoretical, everything shouldn't go right in the end.

Anyway, I enjoyed the movie.  It's probably not Denzel's best by any stretch of the imagination, but it was still an entertaining watch.  I may not pull ""D&eacute; Javu"" out to watch frequently, but I don't feel I was robbed of my time.  I have to admit I really did enjoy the time travel twist in the story and if you're into that kind of stuff you may find this movie quite interesting as well.",1214265600,,3149,4.618705035971223

Some very imaginative ideas were interspersed into this plot, which offers glimpses of ""Minority Report""'s futuristic crime solving, but Denzel Washington gives a performance a step (or two) above Tom Cruise's version.  The sequence of events peaks the imagination in DejaVu, and supplies well enough camoflaged leads, that makes the production a progression of links into the climax, transitions that are as smooth as possible, with only a minimal amount of fragmentational scenes which never seem to add-up.  Its a difficult theme to digest, even after the movie.

1599068,3,B00005JPD0,"This film asks some fantastic nonlinear questions of human capabilities and comprehension regarding our relationship to timespace; however, since it's a Hollywood rendering of speculative fiction it answers them with densely linear logic.  Doug Carlin (Denzel) is charged with unraveling a terrorist act against civilians in New Orleans, and in the midst of doing so stumbles into governmental technology that allows him to venture into the past.  Throwing in quite a few quantum physics buzz words to seemingly seal the logic behind the mysterious technology or either confuse the clueless, the writers were accurate in relaying the current theories and scientific conjecture.  Other films (Minority Report) have perhaps done the metatechno better than this one, but I still thought it stood up well.  However, there were gaping holes in the fictionalized aspects of the technology, that really only served to further confuse what would otherwise have been a really cool premise.  Given the twist of timing, transitions between the present and past were well edited and moved the flow along nicely.

I really didn't want to see this film slide into a romance, as it was clear that Carlin was falling for the damsel.  Luckily it made only passing acknowledgment of attraction, which was so slight that it was in perfect character.  Blending scifi and action genres worked well for this content, though.  Along that line, Denzel is a gifted actor, and he does really well in this film.  It's no stretch for him to play a vigilante racing against time to forestall some twisted fate.  This character could have been any one of about four roles he's done already.  Paula Patton (damsel)  is absolutely gorgeous and did well in this role.  James Caviezel was mesmerizing, as a bad guy should be, and he really stood out in terms of how he brought the role to life.  Considering his performance I also have to accept that the one character who seemed to have a metaphysical understanding of timespace was also crazy.  Val Kilmer's character was either under represented in this film or unnecessary, and as such I'm not even sure of the purpose of his character.  His presence did not move the plot forward in any way that another of the more meaningful cast (Adam Goldberg) couldn't have accomplished.

In short,  no ground be broken here.  It's an interesting film,  well acted, well directed.  Just don't look to it for anything more than that.",1202256000,,2441,4.99009900990099

Well casted (Denzel, lovely Paula Patton, light work by Val Kilmer, and James Caviezel in a much darker role).  Well acted, budgeted, directed, and filmed.

1599070,4,B00005JPD0,"This movie directed by Tony Scott (Man on Fire) was filmed with great effect entirely in New Orleans. It is not a true sci fi film per se. Instead it blends crime thriller action with a science fiction staple- time travel. Denzel Washington plays ATF agent Doug Carlin. He along with hundreds of other law enforcement and emergency service workers have responded to the banks of the Mississipi after a terrorist bomb has killed hundreds. He lends his expertise to the FBI in sizing up the situation. They are impressed with his skills and invite him into their secretive investigative team. And their big secret- Quantum physicists working for top research universities and Uncle Sam have stumbled upon a way to bend time and space and remotely view recent past events.

They want to look at this crime scene as it happens from their many aspects and find out who the terrorist(s) are. From his normal detective work Carlin has already found a murdered female(Paula Patton) whose death is dissimilar to the hundreds of other victims found in the river. He encourages the team to focus solely on her. The team begins remotely viewing the events in the life of this beautiful women as it is believed that she will have a very personal encounter with the terrorist at some point before she dies.

But Carlin wants to push the envelope- can we do more than just look at the past? Can we send a message to ourselves in the past? Or travel there ourselves? That, as most science fiction fans know, creates immense complexities. Can you go back and fix one bad thing and keep everything else the same? If so what else will change. The plot is believable and plausible(although there is some strain at the end). The movie is entertaining from start to finish as Carlin is always running into something he might have had a hand in but can't remember (hence the title).",1199923200,3,1859,4.681957186544342

Kilmer brings Washington in on a special team the FBI has formed using a new technology they think will help them solve the bombing. Washington becomes suspicious of this new technology and finally gets the team to admit that in actuality they have discovered a way to go 4.5 days back in time.

Deja Vu was an enjoyable movie. It has a great look to it and the performances are all good. Then again, they don't ask anyone to do that much. Val Kilmer's FBI agent sits behind a table most of the movie and Denzel Washington could play this part in his sleep. There was no real depth to the story and they didn't make me care about it enough. The time travel technology was never explained very well and after saying early in the movie that it's impossible to send a person back, they've tried it, of course when Washington needs to go back, he survives.

1599165,4,B00005JPD0,"Deja Vu lingers just below the surface of being a great movie. Its superb cinematography and A-List cast save the movie from being just 'okay'. There are several vivid and emotional scenes that definitely make the movie worth watching. As for plot, don't take your logic hat in with you. You will need to suspend your knowledge of  physics, space and time, and sometimes even your common sense in a way similar to how you have to do to enjoy movies like ""Frequency"" and  ""The Matrix.""

But in Dj Vu, the logicalness is too haphazard. Yes, you do have to let your mind imagine the possibility, but you can't discount logic altogether. Even in the sci-fi world, things still have to make sense for that world. And Deja Vu fails for me in that regard. There are some gaping holes in its presentation of time travel. For example, from some of the statements made by Caviezel's character (he's the evil bomber), one would think that he is aware of the government's time travel capability, which he indeed is not. For instance he makes a comment like, ""Destiny -- Anyone who tries to stop it from happening will only cause it to happen.""  In an earlier scene, we see where this was true -- attempts to change the past didn't work and in fact, may have caused further trouble. But how does Caviezel know this?  Also, toward the end, there is some business with a gun that Denzel takes from Paula that I still don't understand. Without giving too much away, the gun scene just doesn't jive with some things that happened earlier.

Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer, and James Caviezel give good performances in spite of a mediocre script in which the dialogue is sometimes overplayed. Adam Goldberg as the wise-cracking genius also gives a noteworthy performance. And Paula Patton as the victim Denzel's character becomes attached to gives, I think, the best performance of the movie. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the movie and though I may be guilty of too much logical analysis, it was quite entertaining.

I know that opinion is not shared by most, but I do like Denzel in most films, and here he just can't rise above the cop-movie-gone-sci-fi premises. The time travel idea doesn't really seem that convincing, the concepts are dealt with far better in many other films (and Twilight Zone episodes), and the film is 30 minutes too long. I couldn't care much for anyone in it, so there was little suspense.

I think Fallen and Training Day are twice as good as this, and even Man On Fire is far better, to name a few Denzel flicks I've enjoyed over the past few years.

1599281,2,B00005JPD0,"Well, I guess it's probably because I have.  Yes, sadly, `Dj vu' brings absolutely nothing new to the table.  I was very intrigued by the trailer and all that I had read about the film.  I imagined I would be seeing something much different than what was presented before me, that's for certain.  About halfway through the film though I began to realize that this was not going to be as deep as I originally thought, and when Adam Goldberg's character Dr. Alexander Denny starts to explain what's really going on I felt my mind go numb and my blood start to boil for it was within those few stuttered sentences that I realized this movie was, point blank, stupid.

The film starts with a terrorist attack on a ferry boat killing hundreds of people.  ATF Agent Doug Carlin comes to the crime scene to uncover evidence when he bumps into FBI Agent Paul Pryzwarra who is heading a new branch of the FMI investigations team and wants Carlin's help.  With this new technology the FBI has attained they can watch what happened four days and six hours in the past in order to solve crimes.  They intend to use this technology to uncover what happened with the ferry.  In related news, a young woman named Claire Kuchever was washed ashore moments before the ferry exploded with wounds similar to those of someone burnt to death in an explosion so Carlin begins to speculate that whoever planted the bomb on the boat must have first murdered this woman and left her to look like yet another casualty of the blast.  He insists that this investigations team make Claire their main focus of attention the days prior to the attack.

Up until this point I was at least interested.  And then Doug makes an observation about the technology.  He realizes that this must be more than just surveillance video.  Claire can hear them, she can sense them watching her and she can respond to them.  It was at this moment that the film lost me, well, not lost me but lost my interest.  I just really expected them to go somewhere other than the time travel thing.  I really wanted this to be smarter, more original than that.

As far as the acting is concerned, it's decent at best.  An actor of Denzel Washington's caliber should know to pick better material than this.  I mean, when you're considered one of our finest working actors you just don't do films like this.  Maybe one or two is acceptable but for every `Malcolm X' Denzel gives us three or four `Dj Vu' type films.  It's sad because when he sticks to his strengths he excels but when he pulls out movies like this it further proves my belief that Denzel is not as strong an actor as so many believe for he needs strong material to elevate his performance.  `Dj vu' is not strong material, thus he falters, as does the rest of cast really.  Jim Caviezel is really the only one in the cast who makes a real impact and that's mostly because he's playing a vicious sociopath who hardly speaks and when he does he's given some creepy fear inducing dialog to joggle.  Val Kilmer is quite chunky here but his character makes far less an impression, and is it just me or does Adam Goldberg always act like he's strung out on coke.  Paula Patton is genuinely gorgeous but aside from that she's not very effective.  Her character isn't really fleshed out much so I blame that on the script.

Yes, the script, that stack of paper that is supposed to make a film work.  This script was a stack of paper that ultimately squeezed Denzel Washington into a cubicle called a time machine.  I guess the biggest feeling that I felt when watching this movie was that of disappointment, major disappointment.  I had more faith in Tony Scott.  I absolutely loved his last two films `Domino' and `Man on Fire' and just felt that he would recapture that magic between him and Denzel this go around as well.  Sadly that couldn't have been further from the truth.

*I want to make an edit to my review.  I feel that I made an unfair assessment of Denzel Washington's career when I made the comment that I didn't feel he was a strong actor.  After careful consideration this past weekend I realized that my statement is an unfair and ultimately false one.  Denzel Washington is truly one of our more talented actors.  I do feel that he has his niche and when he sticks to his strengths he soars.  When he chooses weak material he seems to get stuck and can't quite rise above it all.  I just wanted to clear that up because after thinking back this weekend I realized that I actually really like Denzel.*",1193097600,,4518,4.488970588235294

I've always loved well-done time travel movies (or books, or games) dealing with cause and effect.  Sadly, this movie breaks one of the biggest rules of time-travel movies: it leaves some plot holes big enough to blindly drive a hummer through.  Or, if you want to give the director a little more faith: merely some big loose ends he forgot to tie up.  It's a shame, because this movie otherwise seems very clever, so those gaffes are all the more jarring in comparison.

That coupled with a much-touted car chase that I found a bit ridiculous (the way it was executed in the movie, not the premise behind it) take this from being a great movie to merely an entertaining one.

You mean the U.S. military, who holds overt blame, under a multitude of evidence pointing to weak, poorly structured, and purposefully destroyed levees, for the majority of the destruction to the region? Nice ""foot-to-the-throat"" of the poor citizens of a once grand, and culturally rich sector of our country.
Other little flag-sucking messages are sprinkled throughout, viewable to the alert and observant, such as the ""Support Our Troops"" sticker clearly visible in one scene. Yes, ""support your troops"", the thin line between caring for the poor misguided or desperate grunts (of which I was one, before realizing the sham I was involved in) who signed up out of economic despair, illusions of grandeur, or Unca Sam's college money, (treacherous bait to lure the desperate to the front lines, i.e the multitude of ""National Guard"" and ""Reserves"" deployed OVERSEAS in the war zone)and supporting the heinous attrocities of one's government.
 Then there is the subject of the whole time travel debacle, where large leaps of faith and stretches in reason are depicted as a scientific and technological possibility, instead of the pure egg-headed, jerk-fest, fantasy they represent. Large leaps of reason go unquestioned, when we're on the journey we predestined, viewed purely as entertainment, it was a success, a meal for the mind, lacking the soul's substance.
 Ohh whoa whoa its magiccc! An approach to time-tavel as a realistic, technological probability, that rings as true to me, as an evolutionary theory that states as fact, our arrival here as 'modern man', in a complex and intricate universe, which we as humans still know so little about, as a miracle of chance. Res Ipsa Loquitur, as Hunter would say.
 The ending, in particular, attempted to tear credible rationale from my brains, which were already cowering in the wake of such a vicious beating. K, he was transported, by the souped-up zapper, back in time. Which eliminates his ""present-self"", correct? So, during the rescue, his ""time-travelling-self"" drowns, yet he reappears later on shore, re-united with his love-interest. That point in the timeline is still in the past people! So WTF? What of his ""present-self""? Is it dead? Is he now doomed to live out his days, three days or so in the past? F*** me. My cranium erupts and out sputters a warm goo. I lap it up greedily because it tastes like chicken. Amen.
 Also of note to my fellow ""free-thinking radicals"", the cliched lines muttered by the traiterous Jim Cavietzel, in defense of his treachery. Only a flag-sucking ignorant could set up such weak-minded dialogue from a character who suredly would have had much more, or far less to say, on the subject of tyrants and kings. Another wet-dream, patriotic jerk-fest, tackled with an O'Reillian passion, how enforcer Denzel, ""The Protector"" shuts him down with pre-formed government lines, intent on making the ""insurgent"" Cavietzel look like an ill-informed goon, self-righteous and self-centered. Something about the tree of freedom being watered by the blood of the innocents. Crap propaganda. Spoken as a freely admitting insurgent against our corrupt and oppressive regime, I would state, at best, that the tree of freedom be watered by the blood of tyrants and kings, but, in fact, most of us would agree that blood-shed on either side will in the end solve nothing, as one beast would simply replace another.
 I had high hopes for this movie, as I was surprised at how much I liked, ""Enemy of the State"" (Even under the torturous scenario of it starring the Prince of Bel-Air)from this director. If I had one gripe, I would like to switch Denzel, whom I generally like and respect as an actor, although I realize him to be not particularly enlightened, and Will Smith, who could then rank this film right up there with ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" as all-time great American propagandist films for the un-assuming masses.",1192233600,,4747,4.994943109987358

1599288,5,B00005JPD0,"Deja Vu is a movie that shouldn't have worked. This genre of movie was tried before in movies like TimeCop and 12 Monkeys and failed. It is a sci-fi time travel/crime drama, two types of movies that mix about as well as oil and water. It is possible that this movie would not have worked with a lesser actor in the lead role, that the silliness of the concept - that the U.S. government accidently develops a time machine that can see only only a few hours into the past and is fatal to anybody who tries to use it to travel and, by the way, only works within a radius of a few miles, and, by the way, also fits into the back of a semi-truck so it can be hauled around - would have killed the movie. However, Denzel Washington approaches the whole concept with, at first, the contempt and ridicule it deserves. Then he decides, if this junk is real, why should he accept the rules that he must only watch and do nothing to change the past - or future - and prevent another 911 style attack. The movie skillfully unfolds with tantelizing hints that Denzel has done just that - has been tampering with the time-stream all along, only he just hasn't done it yet. The director throws in an interesting and unnecessary cross-time car chase just to get the action rolling at one point. The movie has a satisfying ending. It's worth watching to see a sci-fi movie closer to home, with Chevys instead of space ships, and cell phones instead of phaser pistols.",1190937600,3,1451,4.377777777777778

1599423,4,B00005JPD0,"*D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu* is the perfect blend of science fiction and action film for the average movie watcher as well as the science fiction fan. At its core, it is a thrilling, well paced action adventure story about an ATF agent, Doug Carlin, investigating a terrorist bombing on a ferry full of US Navy sailors in New Orleans. 540 people are killed in the massive explosion, but one young woman's body washes up and doesn't seem to fit with the other victims; though it looks like a victim of the explosion, the body was discovered 8 minutes before the bomb went off. Other pieces of evidence regarding this victim quickly lead Carlin to roughly piece together where she fits in the puzzle; unfortunately, none of it is enough to provide leads to the perpetrator.

When Carlin presents his information to the FBI agents in charge, they are quickly impressed by his keen ability to size up a crime scene and filter out the noise from the pertinent details. They invite him to join a new test project that uses the latest technology to analyze a crime scene. Though the FBI and scientists involved try to hide the true nature of the technology, it doesn't take agent Carlin long to realize that there is more to it than advanced surveillance camera processing. This is where the science fiction weaves itself into the crime action drama film. While testing a new high-powered telescope technology, a way to bend the fabric of space/time is discovered, allowing the ability to watch the past in ""real time"" exactly 4+ days before.

What makes this film work so well is that the action mostly takes place in the present, but the technology leads to some very good storytelling and the most interesting car chase ever conceived. I had read in some positive reviews that as good as it was it didn't fully make sense...well they are wrong - it complete sense - just pay attention to the details along the way and the story comes together nicely. Yes, there are a few inconsistencies - whose explanations probably were left on the cutting room floor to keep the film well paced - but they are small. If you have a basic understanding of the physics and space/time you can piece them together yourselves; if you are not, don't worry and ignore them because they don't take away from this very film.",1189555200,,2292,4.684863523573201
1599424,4,B00005JPD0,"The first point is the acting. It had too small of part for Kilmer, but all the acting is top notched. Denzel plays a guy who is good at his job and is morally upright, who uses his charm to speed up the bureaucratic process.  Caviezel was intense and good. The plot was good. The trouble with the plot was that once Denzel goes back in time, he should not have been able to change the past. For example, the Twelve Monkeys did this well. However, since it was Denzel Washington, the past had to change. What happens to Denzel once he went back in time was pretty obvious to this viewer.

There was a previous reviewer who said the science made perfect sense and was straight-forward. Funny. The movie was about time travel and worm holes. Give me a break. People watch NOVA a few times and think they understand space and time. I have a physics degree, I did not understand their mumblings, and I thought it was silly. They explained the massive energy requirements by having the lights of the city dim when the time machine was in operation (stolen from Weird Science?).

The movie for a while reminded me of ""Laura"" in which a detective falls in love with a portrait of the supposedly dead victim. Who wouldn't fall in love with Gene Tierney or Paula Patton? I thought they should have kept working with that idea instead of the time travel, but the problem was that this victim was very dead indeed.

The movie had some very interesting ideas. The car chase scene was very good. How well they tied in the future and the past was very good. The problem was that once you figure out what is going to happen to Denzel and Paula, the movie lost its edge and excitement for me.",1189296000,2,1676,4.396774193548387

Somehow their mission mostly involves observing the leading actress in the shower and also walking around her apt in her underwear. Denzel is suddenly smitten and decides he has to go back in time to save not 300 victims in a ferry explosion but one woman he has seen in her underwear. This is Hollywood at its most insipid and this would have been a pretty decent movie if it wasn't for this adolescent spin.",1188172800,2,643,4.551724137931035
1599428,5,B00005JPD0,"So, what does it take for a movie to get my attention? It's an assortment of factors, some of them would be the following: a story that appears intriguing, a director attached that has a solid record of hits, a star or group of stars that I'm a fan of, or merely be a sequel to a movie that I enjoyed. Many times it only takes one of those items to get me interested in a movie, but sometimes it helps to have more than one factor working to a movie's advantage. This is the case of the action-packed thrill ride ""Deja Vu"" that stars Denzel Washington (one of my favorite actors), is directed by Tony Scott (director of ""Man on Fire""), and is produced by uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer (whose movies I thoroughly enjoy 9 times out of 10). With all of those factors together in one movie, this was definitely one film that I wanted to see from the moment I saw the first trailer.

""Deja Vu"" focuses on federal agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) being called in to recover evidence from a deadly ferry explosion that rocked New Orleans. While working the case, Doug is pulled aside to aide in a top-secret government experiment dealing with time-shifting surveillance, basically they can watch events of the past as if it were in the present. The team behind the experiment is hoping that this revolutionary technology will allow them to see the crime before it happened in hopes of catching the person(s) responsible for the heinous act. But can this technology assist in changing the past or merely watching it from the sidelines?

Here is a movie that caught me completely by surprise. I was fairly confident that I was going to be in for an enjoyable action-packed thrill ride, based solely on the facts that Jerry Bruckheimer was producing (a man known for delivering the best action movies in Hollywood) and Tony Scott was directing (whose use of quick cuts and groundbreaking camera work has created some of the most thrilling sequences put to film). Sure this movie delivered explosive action and intensity, but what I didn't expect was the use of so much science fiction with the concept of bending time and even some time travel. Surprisingly, the sci-fi aspect actually worked for the film, which couldn't have been easy to execute due to time-themed science fiction being rather difficult to pull off in a way that makes sense, and doesn't create plot holes within the story. But the writers of this movie managed to craft a story that was filled with plenty of action, intriguing drama, and some sci-fi thrown in to mix things up a little bit without allowing the story to become bloated and clunky. Another aspect of this movie that surprised me was Tony Scott's seemingly more reserved direction. After filming both ""Man on Fire"" and ""Domino"" with such frantic camera work, extremely fast cuts and stylistic color manipulation, it was somewhat relaxing to watch a much more straightforward approach to movie making from this talented director.

Denzel Washington was superb as always in his role as federal agent Doug Carlin. He handles the action and drama with great ease, and even the science fiction aspect seemed like second nature to him, which is a genre he's had very little experience with (his last foray into sci-fi was the lackluster film ""Virtuosity""). The main supporting cast comprised of Val Kilmer and Jim Caviezel provided interesting, three-dimensional characters from a script that seemed to have them painted very thinly, based on their roles and screen time, but these two talented actors made the most of what they were given. It was nice to see Val Kilmer back on the big screen, he's a gifted actor that it seems like we don't see much from anymore (though that may have something to do with his apparent weight gain, a career ender for some in Hollywood). The remainder of the cast were all solid, but weremade up of fairly run-of-the-mill filler characters that were used mostly for exposition.

""Deja Vu"" is a surprisingly original, entertaining thril-ride that grabs you from the opening sequence and never lets go. This is a movie that is a definite must-see, and one that is fun to watch time and again.

""Deja Vu"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief nudity/sensuality.",1187827200,4,4230,4.789041095890411

Dj Vu  starring Denzel Washington is an outstanding movie.  Of course I don't know if Denzel was ever in a bad movie.  Anyhow, the movie has a slight Science Fiction aura, its basic premise is a machine that can look back in time for approximately 96 hours, no more, no less.  A ferry is blown up and this machine is used to solve the crime.  The movie is set in the city of New Orleans, BTW.

1599430,4,B00005JPD0,"I had a geat aniticipation about the movie as the previews seemeed to advertise with actions packed & intrigue... Great movie like this reminded me of D. Washington astonished performance in drama ""Man of Fire"" as far as acting goes. His performance here is no precedent not discarding other great cast-actors in this film were also perfect.
I give a 4 stars for the production itself as far as editing, casting and a minus one for the plotline coherence. I'd agree that the end was non-sense as far as seeing a deceased back from nowhere. The Fed's project Sat surveillance is cool as far as it parameters what it has access-datas-to, but foreseeing through walls and no-data-access angles is kind' of too unreal even to produce, and that mixed with time travel element. There's too much datas to reconcile into one data-work as seen in the movie.
The fact that the program could actually time travel could be too unrealistic, I think the end just shattered the whole plot apart and contradicted itself. Carlin should have been left dead, and that would of wrapped up the whole story line as if as nothing ever happened. In that, the only changes done, was Carlin's death and the terrorist's mission demise, but that nobody would ever know about but his other dogg who helped him out. Then, that would make the whole time travel idea more credible.
However, I give credits to the production as a whole, the director Tony Scott's guidance unshooked. I recommend the film but wished the end didn't violate the borrowed time tangent with Carlin's reappearance.
However, as a fan, with D. Washington acting just minimized the whole prejudice...",1187481600,,1641,4.843416370106762
1599431,4,B00005JPD0,"MINORITY REPORT meets A WRINKLE IN TIME meets PREMONITION. . . .  All in all, a very intriguing couple of hours.  It reminded me of several other concepts previously discussed and presented (a bit of intentional deja vu itself. . . ?):  Philip K. Dick's and Spielberg's idea of pre-crime in MINORITY REPORT; Madeleine L'Engle's brilliant explanation of the ""fifth dimension"" leading to time/space travel in her novel A WRINKLE IN TIME; the whole concept of altering the course of ""future"" events in the recent PREMONITION (which really dropped the ball).

This movie's success (for me) falls somewhere between that of those others.  MINORITY REPORT stayed in that ""science"" realm, showing what the future will be like as technology progresses, and Spielberg produced a spectacular movie based on a great book by Philip K. Dick.  DEJA VU wasn't quite there.  PREMONITION tried to show us that past events can be changed (or something like that), but it didn't work, and they really copped out at the end.  Madeleine L'Engle presented--in a very kid-friendly way--the scientific concept of a ""fifth"" dimension and how that would change the space/time continuum and did so brilliantly.

Where this movie succeeds is in walking that fine line between science ""fiction"" and science ""fact,"" an idea they talk about in one of the interviews.  Could this technology really exist. . . ?  Maybe.  Could it be applied in this kind of setting?  Sure.  Is it still a stretch for my simple mind. . . ?  Yes.  Sorry.  Did it work anyway?  Yes!  I was entertained, challenged, intrigued, and confused.  That works for me.  When it began, I went back to the opening again, just to see what happened the first time (or the second time. . . ?)--I rarely do that.

It is worth watching just for two scenes (in the context of the rest of the movie):
  1.  Denzel's ""simultaneous"" car chase--absolutely brilliant concept and execution;
  2.  Adam Goldberg's character's description of the physics of making the present connect both to the past and future (depending on which way you're looking)--again brilliant, despite the ""borrowing"" of L'Engle's images.

Denzel, as expected, is great; the ensemble works very well together--with bonus points for Adam Goldberg; and the whole concept, while not entirely original, is presented in a fairly original and fresh way.  Well worth a rental and possibly a second watch. . . .  Or a first one again. . . .",1187395200,,2429,4.9088669950738915

Add to the roster the talented Adam Goldberg and the devastatingly attractive Paula Patton and you've got all the ingredients necessary to provide a truly great viewing experience. Unfortunately even with a cast of this caliber the film doesn't quite deliver all the potential it could have.

Time travel movies are always popular but could be a little tricky at times. I think the script handles the scientific explanation of time travel and warping space surprisingly well but some sequences are a little too unrealistic and you can ask an audience to suspend reality for only so long. I also found the ending to make no sense whatsoever so that definitely is a minus. On the positive side, the romantic angle works wonderfully and Denzel Washington's love interest Paula Patton is drop dead gorgeous. `Dj vu' combines the futuristic vision of `Minority Report' (`02) with the romantic longing of the '44 classic `Laura'. Not too bad a combination don't you think?

Here he plays ATF agent Doug Carlin who is brought in to investigate a ferry bombing that killed more than 500 people.  Some odd details start bothering him including the body of Caire Kuchever (played very well by the beautiful Paula Patton).  At first she looks like another victim of the blast on the ferry, but Agent Carlin notices some things that don't match up.

Agent Pryzwarra (a nicely done turn by Val Kilmer) brings Carlin into a special investigative unit  that has a special tool to view a stream from the past.  I can't get into details of this team or much more of the movie because unraveling it is part of the fun of the film.  You know from the title of the film that it has something to do with reliving the past, but how this film does it is pretty fresh.  There is one very cool car chase that includes trying to drive in the present to keep in view the villain in a car from the past and is something I hadn't seen before.

Yes, there are things in the plot that require artificial limits on things and require the cast to say and not say or do or not do things that would make things much more mundane and realistic, but still, as a romantic thriller, it is a pretty good entertainment.

Another thing I didn't like about this movie is the computer graphics. The director must have believed we will think the past viewer CG so cool and like it so much that he used it over and over again. On the contrary, I feel slightly insulted to be thought of that way. I like computer graphics in movies that are used to reproduce reality to show spectacular scenes that cannot be shot otherwise, like those in Star Wars episodes. However, I loath CG used as if it were something cool, e.g. CG on computer user-interface. When PCs are so ubiquitous these days everybody can tell a good user-interface from a bad one. And bad ones are not cool to me, no matter how much computer graphics you put into it.

He sends groups of well-trained specialists (bringing high tech technology with them) that will prevent all the evil that has ever infected the history of humanity.

-I suppose I should comment on the movie, as that is what reviews are for.
If we are open-minded enough to ignore the silly story, I think the movie itself was really bad. (I might sound like someone who has no clue and gives 1star ratings for a reasonable movie, whilst most others have been giving 5stars)
But, it's one of those kind of movies where a lot of money is invested (even if the story is ridiculous), add a bunch of (stupid)car crashes, sound effects, explosions and all that, to try to make it look spectacular, just to pick up the cash after.

Denzel Washington plays a sharp ATF Agent investigating a ferry explosion which left over 500 people dead. He figures out (rather quickly) that the ferry disaster is connected to a seemingly unrelated murder of a young woman whose body washed up on shore shortly BEFORE the explosion. He eventually joins a special ""surveillance"" team that has technology that I cannot even begin to explain accurately here. In a nutshell, they are able to use satellite imagery to recreate everything that took place 4 days and 6 hours ago, from every vantage point. As the team uses this technology to find the identity of the person who blew up the ferry, Denzel's character devises ways to maximize its potential to save lives. It's already been mentioned in several reviews that he travels back in time, so that's no surprise, but what he does when he gets there will blow you away (no pun intended...sorry.)

This is a WILD ride...there's no need to understand the science behind the technology, the murder mystery/suspense is enough to grab you for the duration of the movie. It is extremely fast-paced and features excellent (beyond excellent, really) acting by Denzel. The ending totally blew me away, although I really didn't get that either! Highly recommend.

1599825,4,B00005JPD0,"Denzel Washington plays Agent Carlin, a sharp, valiant AFT agent who is so extraordinary talented, that he can analyze a crime scene with little more than a glance or quick walk-through.

These talents come in handy when a ferry, full of innocent people suddenly explodes near New Orleans.  The terrorist who sent the 500+ people to their fiery deaths filled up an SUV with explosives and all of the evidence seems to have been blown sky high.

That is, until Carlin checks his voice mail and discovers a phonecall that took place shortly before the explosion.  The phonecall would be of little consequence if not for the fact that the young woman who made the phonecall washed up on shore dead, but was not a victim of the explosion.

A little ingenius reasoning in typical Denzel fashion comes to the conclusion that the killer of this young woman is also the terrorist.  But there isn't enough evidence to find this man/woman.  Impressed by Carlin's skills, he is recruited into an elite group of investigators bent on finding the mysterious terrorist before he permanently escapes or strikes again.

Carlin finds out that the investigators have a set up of high tech imaging equipment that might just get a glimpse of the young woman who washed up dead, or, better yet, her killer.  But something happens, the plot takes several twists and Carlin starts to experience a little Deja Vu as he visits the key sites of the investigation.

He begins to fall in love with the images of the woman who was murdered and starts to doubt the imaging equipment is really what they say it is.  You might just think that Carlin is the terrorist, with his odd recollection of the crime scene, and you may or may not be right.  Perhaps there is a conspiracy that strikes at the very heart of America, or perhaps it is something else entirely.  What is certain, is that the evil is efficient and frightening and might be deeper and darker than a single warped mind.

For a few moments, I thought the the investigation began to question the very essence of time and space and thought I had it all figured out.  I was wrong.

The acting is superb, the plot twists keep the viewer glued to the seat, and there is sporadic action that is always well done.  For those who like suspense, don't miss this one.  The actors are well selected for their roles, the cinematography conveys an action filled and mysterious environment to near perfection, and the dialogue is neither excessive nor insufficient.  The movie is well balanced and well put together for a nail biting Saturday night.

1599827,5,B00005JPD0,"This movie put me in the mind ( A LITTLE) of ""12 Monkeys"". But the difference is that 12 Monkeys was about time travel alone. ""Deja Vu"" concentrates more on video surveilance by the government to go back in time, but ultimately, it too concerns actual time travel.

The story goes like this:

A ferry in New Orleans blows up one morning with over 500 people aboard. A lot of them are sailors, thier wives and children.

Denzel Washington is a detective investigating the case, when the Government picks him to bring him into a new system they have, and the system is this:

Basically it is ""Big Brother""-

for miles thre is satellite video equipment in space, circling this certain area and capturing EVERYTHING within so many miles. It can actually go right through houses and walls.

They (police (Denzel), and the FBI) are stationed at tables in front of big screen TV's and can literally go ANYwhere within the crime area- up to 4 days in the past.

They are able to go back and try to find the person responsible for the blast if they do it in the next few days, that is .. AND they need to have some idea of where to begin to look.

That is where Denzel comes in, he focuses in on a certain young woman and they begin to track her last days, which ultimately leads them to thier killer.

It goes a LOT deeper than this too, actually. Because while tracking this girl, Denzel discovers there is a certain magnetic field in time and space which causes a ""time warp"" type of thing where he can pass a note through (to himself) 4 days in the past, warning of the disaster, hence, preventing all the deaths.

Of course, although it has not been tested, Denzel himself goes through to apprehend the killer, which makes for some great chase scenes.

This movie has got to be one of the best I have seen in a long time.

 I recommend it to anyone who likes a movie with a lot of action, and one that takes a lot of thinking. I also LOVE movies concerning time travel, which this also has.

It's worth the price just to learn about the Time Window -- trust me. Didn't see the movie or forget what it's about (that seems impossible to do), it's a police procedural drama updated with a time-travel twist that is plausible (maybe not totally believable) but if you suspend disbelief, the special and visual effects reward you for doing so. Denzel Washington is as charismatic as ever as the lead His co-star Val Kilmer actually plays a decent second fiddle in this film. Maybe that's where he belonged originally as a character actor not a lead...which I always found him a bit miscast in the past. Paula Patton plays the romantic love interest who tells us more with action than words thanks to direction by Tony Scott. Scott doesn't disappoint -- therea re car chases and major fireworks when a River ferry is blown to bits. But it's the twist and turns of the script that complement the visual and special effects. Plus the Time Window that brings a very 21st Century feel to this movie. The backdrop of a rebuilt New Orleans adds drama and a bit of romantic mystery to this chase tale. Chasing time, chasing bad guys, chasing bombs...chasing life!

Doug meets Paula's character Claire first time in the morgue...or does he...this is where the TIME WINDOW changes it all...I'm a SCI FI fan -- but believe me most of this plays like Science Fact -- and that's what Tony Scott wanted and he got it.

He's also worked with the best Hollywood has to offer, from Madeleine Stowe and Gary Oldman to Nicole Kidman and Denzel Washington. This last name is significant since Washington and Scott have worked together on several previously successful film ventures (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crimson-Tide/dp/B000CDGVQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crimson Tide</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-on-Fire/dp/B00005JN0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man on Fire</a>), and come together again with DEJA VU.

More of a science fiction action-drama, Scott dips gingerly into the genre to test its waters utilizing his own unique style. The staged explosions. The high body count. The dessication of morality through characters. It's typical Scott fodder but brandishing the SF genre adequately if somewhat disrespectfully.

There's a lot to like about Deja Vu and one big hunk of burnin' dislike that might make or break it for some viewers (and we'll cover that in a moment). But first, let's look at the film's machinations...

Denzel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside-Man/dp/B000GFLKF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside Man</a>) stars as Doug Carlin, an investigator for the ATF. He's summoned to a ferryboat explosion in Louisiana and quickly wraps-up evidence regarding its cause: terrorism. Domestic or foreign? We're not sure. But the ferry carried a bunch of navy personnel on shore leave, which brings in the FBI. Specifically, Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10th-and-Wolf/dp/B000GDH9N2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10th and Wolf</a>), who realizes the brainpower of Carlin (Denzel) and asks him to join his team of experts. Carlin agrees and Pryzwarra takes him to an elaborate mobile facility where ""monitoring"" equipment takes on surreal proportions. Carlin meets up with the rest of Pryzwarra's crew, Denny (Adam Goldberg), Gunnars (Elden Henson) and Shanti (Erika Alexander), and checks out the new gadgets (involving wormhole/foldspace theory coupled with time-travel).

Carlin isn't immediately let in on how the technology works, but soon surmises that they are looking at the past. Three days past, to be exact. He's also interested in finding out who killed a woman who's body was found several hours before the explosion, burned and battered like the rest of the ferryboat victims but who's time of death doesn't match up. She's a beautiful Louisiana native named Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Idlewild/dp/B000JJSL1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Idlewild</a>), and even in death, Carlin is oddly attracted to her. And when he sees her walking around in the FBI's three-days-past time-machine, he knows there's a connection between the bombing and her life.

While checking out her kitchen, Carlin also finds a message on her refrigerator (""U Can Save Her""). Who wrote that and why? How can you save someone who's already dead?

Racing against fate, destiny, and lateral time-lines, Carlin boldly goes where no man has gone before. And this is where the hitch comes in. When Carlin offers to risk his life to save Paula, we as the audience are supposed to believe that an entire human body can be transported through time using a machine never designed for such a thing (they send back a piece of paper and, in so doing, use so much of the local power grid that they blackout most of the South). Imagine the power required to send something as complex as a person and you see where the problem lay.

There is one other thing that I have to mention that bugged the crap out of me, and that was the film's title. Deja Vu isn't really mentioned or hit upon until the closing moments, which made me wonder why they gave it its current title. And Deja Vu is more of a feeling and that didn't come through in the movie.

But it was certainly entertaining. Tony Scott has another successful action film on his hands. But you might want to switch-off your overly analytical brain when it comes to the SF elements.",1181001600,6,4635,6.186335403726708

1599950,2,B00005JPD0,"There's one certainty to Tony Scott's ""Dj Vu:"" It makes sense in only one way, and the movie never really addresses it, which either means the filmmakers assume you'll figure it out, or they're willfully confusing us. Its final act is more or less inexplicable, and that makes it nearly impossible to recommend.\

There are other ways to consider this science-fiction/thriller, I guess, because it's set in New Orleans, post-Katrina and post-9/11, because it involves terrorism mixed with toxic patriotism, because the letters ATF and FBI ignite some mixture of pride, fear, regret and anger in our collective memory. But you don't judge the quality of a steak dinner by the seasonal vegetables.

A ferry explodes in the New Orleans port. ATF agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) investigates and quickly calls two shots: It was a bomb, and the man who planted in also killed a local woman named Claire (Paula Patton) for her Ford Bronco. Based one look at Claire in the morgue, Carlin falls in love with her.

He falls even more in love when a secret FBI surveillance machine run by agent Przywarra (Val Kilmer) allows Carlin to look at Claire four-and-a-half days into the past in an attempt to find out when she came in contact with the terrorist.

Written by Bill Marsilli and Terry Rossio, the first hour of ""dj vu"" is thoughtful, compelling work. The writers devise a clever car chase 108 hours apart, as Carlin must follow the terrorist and dodge present-day cars as well, with mixed results. Washington is his typical cocky self, bellowing when pertinent, cracking a joke in the right spot. He's starting to enjoy the untucked shirt, Steven Seagal look too much, but he's an effective Everyman. Patton, the wife of singer Robin Thicke, makes a pretty damsel.

But once Agent Carlin makes a key discovery about the machine, the script falls apart. Or, rather, it's been setting itself up for a hard fall since its first scenes, and we're just realizing it. Events and evidence seen earlier in the movie are recycled in ways that seem, upon reflection, impossible unless - well, that's the secret of the movie.

Good enough to say ""dj vu"" plays the idea of changing the past without making enough of a commentary on (numerous, and possibly infinite) alternate realities; Marsilli and Rossio seem more intent on driving to a predictable, boring climax that's little more than a shootout.  An argument between two FBI technicians (Adam Goldberg and Erika Alexander) seems to hold the key to explaining movie last 30 minutes, but it doesn't do so with any real satisfaction.

We, and a major character, are left with the idea that something's ""weird."" That's not enough. The movie makes a choice to be more than its roots in voyeurism and crook-catching after-the-fact, and, so it can be clever in the most basic way - viewers are expected to think or say out loud ""Ohhhhhhh yeaaaaah"" several times, apparently - it cheats the parameters of its own logic.

Anyone who was alive during 9/11 has already had a lifetime overdose of news coverage of terrorist tragedy - I don't need a film to present the same.  The few shots that cut away from big band military music, flaming bodies and crying bystanders are straight from a bad, made-for-TV movie - Denzel gazing steely eyed at clues like grease smears under a bridge while mouthing soap opera'esque explanatory bomb specifics to the police.  And these few lines of awful dialogue only occur about half hour into the movie.  I'm serious, no one says a word for the first quarter of the film! Once again Hollywood cranks out another movie that lacks a plot or screenplay and has forgotten to be entertaining.  Not even the promise of staring at Denzel Washington for two hours could keep me awake.  The only entertaining moment is seeing Val Kilmer's beyond bloated face and neck appear on the screen and wondering how the neck of a 600 pound man could fit on the only marginally over weight Kilmer.  Bad Liposuction perhaps?  That's the only mystery worth pondering in Deja Vu.  Still lacking any semblance of a plot or more than five lines of dialogue, the movie starts showing close ups of burned and mutilated body parts, including severed children's hands.  Considering I was eating dinner, and not only bored but extremely irritated by the film at this point, I turned it off.  It was forty minutes into the film and they still hadn't gotten to anything to do with the manipulation of time - which was what sounded interesting about the movie to begin with.  While watching I kept thinking about how pathetic this era would seem to future historians looking back on the decade of ""terror"" - where every action film uses terrorists as the stock villain now replacing the Bolsheviks in the bathroom.

1599956,5,B00005JPD0,"I was pleasantly surprised by how good this movie was, with an extremely tight script and some great acting wrapped around what turns out to be a love story.  Denzel Washington is one of our best, and he shines here as the genial genius investigator tapped to hunt down a terrorist in New Orleans.  The only problem with the story is that it requires some focus from its viewers -- the pieces are all there, but the film never spoon-feeds the audience, which puts some people off.

Get over it.

The best science-fiction stories are love stories, and the best love stories are those where the main characters overcome impossible odds to be together.  What's more impossible than getting to know someone after they've died, then deciding to try to prevent their murder?  A truly intelligent story told by a gifted director with an excellent cast, what more can you ask?

It was sheer coincidence that I rented this DVD after re-reading a favorite Robert Heinlein novel where time travel was a dominant theme.  Heinlein wrote these type of stories with the same meticulous attention to detail that made his best novels so believable.  His ""prime directive"" in these matters was simple:  there are no paradoxes, just sequences of events that the characters (and the audience) don't understand until after it's over.  This story has a very Heinleinian flavor to it; Mr. Scott and Mr. Bruckheimer did their homework on this one.

There are a number of wonderful homages sprinkled throughout the film, not the least of which is to the City of New Orleans itself.  One scene in the final cut was remixed so the background audio wasn't clear; view the same scene in the ""extended"" features section and you'll hear the voice of Rod Serling (""Twilight Zone"") coming over Claire's TV, right before events get hairy.  Very appropriate.

Even my wife, not a sci-fi fan by any stretch, loved this film and demanded to see it twice!  There is no stronger recommendation than that.",1180137600,2,1965,4.803571428571429

1599958,3,B00005JPD0,"My Review:
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say...This was not Denzel's best! I know he's adored by millions of people, myself included, but this movie was just o.k at best. The whole time travel thing was interesting, and it made for a very complex plot, but the ending that everyone seems to be bragging about failed to impress me. Frankly, I'm still puzzled by what they were trying to say at the end. I know at this point in his career it seems like Denzel can do no wrong, but trust me, this movie wasn't as great as so many people try to make it sound. I'll be honest, Denzel is one of those actors that never cease to amaze you. Everytime you think he'll never top himself after his latest film...he does! I just felt like this movie was missing something. It was like lukewarm water, and everytime you expect it to start boiling, it never does. The pace and tone is set in the beginning, and it never really builds any real momentum. Don't get me wrong, it held my attention, and I wasn't bored, but nor was I on the egde of my seat either.

Summary of the film: In the beginning of the film a ferry full of soldiers, women, and children is blown away killing everyone aboard. Of course, that raises the question... was it an accident? or, was it done deliberately? was it an act of terrorism? or, was it done right here at home? Of course, Denzel plays Doug Carlin (an ATF Agent) that's determined to get to the bottom of this. He's convinced that the key to finding the culprit lies with a murder victim. The body of a very beautiful young lady washed ashore just prior to the bombing. After being totured and burned alive of course, and meant to look like she was just another casualty on the ship as well. From there, it's his mission to find out who killed her because once he finds her killer he'll have found the person responsible for the bombing. Of course, since she's already dead that's where the time travel comes in at. An elite team of scientist have figured out a way to go at least 4 days into the past. That's where the fun begins.

Conclusion: That's the story in a nutshell. It's not a bad storyline or plot. The acting is pretty good, and there are quite a few familiar faces. It's just not something I would brag about.",1180051200,,2252,4.308962264150943
1599959,5,B00005JPD0,"I heard a lot of bad things about D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, with words tossed around like ""contrived,"" ""unbelievable,"" and ""Jerry Bruckheimer."" My parents, with their big screen television, forced me to sit down and watch the movie at 11 p.m., when I was ready to go to bed.  But instead, I watched right to the end around 1 a.m.  It's that good.

D&eacute;j&agrave; vu entails a terrorist attack by a really safe-kind of terrorist, the now almost-quaint homegrown American type who doesn't like America because...well, just because.  Back when we didn't have enemies lurking around every corner, for a brief time America was its own worst enemy, and it's obvious D&eacute;j&agrave; vu was created from that era.

Our resident terrorist Carroll Oerstadt (Jim Caviezel, who once played a famous carpenter you might have heard of) decides to bomb a New Orleans ferry full of Navy sailors.  The incident is no less horrific despite Oerstadt's unspecified reasons for the attack.  Enter our hero, ATF agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington), invited to join the investigation by FBI Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer).  Since Carlin can't seem to find his partner and has the expertise to ""examine the data,"" it seems like a good idea.

The plot thickens when Doug discovers the body of Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), who appears to have been murdered before the bomb went off.  That's when the science fiction piece comes into play.  The FBI team has a device that allows them to track four days in the past.  Of course, Doug figures it out soon enough--they're not just viewing the past, they're actually experiencing the past.  And if one can experience the past, then maybe one can travel there...

This little restriction (only four days in the past, no more, no less) is an important plot twist.  It lends a sense of urgency to an otherwise difficult concept for a thriller.  D&eacute;j&agrave; vu makes the time travel element easy to accept, because the tantalizing possibilities spiral from there: other plot paths tie together (what happened to Doug's partner?) and there's even an amazing car chase where Doug must race in the present to view where Carroll goes in the past. It has to be seen to be believed.

Summaries of this film make much of Doug falling in love with Claire.  But it's a borderline stalker relationship, as Doug knows Claire primarily through his time traveling surveillance.  Fortunately, D&eacute;j&agrave; vu doesn't overdo it; there's not even a major onscreen kiss (more like a peck on the lips).  And that's just as it should be...the events are too action packed, the pacing too frenetic.  Anything more would border on camp.

Because D&eacute;j&agrave; vu is always moving, the actors primarily stay out of the way and let the action roll.  There are a few clever lines (""We held hands once.""), a few bad script rewrites (""I need more cowbell""? Come on guys, stop trying to be so hip) and plenty of gravely serious meditations on the existential nature of the universe.  But mostly it's about blowing things up.

D&eacute;j&agrave; vu is an awesomely entertaining thriller with enough action, enough science fiction, and just enough skin to keep everybody interested.  Don't miss it...again.",1179792000,3,3217,5.011299435028248
1600071,3,B00005JPD0,"The movie and storyline was good and kept us entertained.  My problem was with the DVD itself.  The playback had problems and got 'stuck'/froze at the start of the movie.  The only way to get the movie to play was to advance to chapter two and then rewind to the beginning of the movie (without going all the way back to 0:00:00 or the problem would re-occur).  I have an ONKYO DVD  player and have never had this problem with it, it still plays all of my other movies just fine.  I did have the exact same thing happen with 'The Queen'.

This movie is VERY predictable. Also, I decided within the first few minutes that the filmmakers obviously thought they shouldn't ruin a good film with things like logic and continuity. One scene in particular is so ridiculous that even Denzel wasn't believing it. Also, the filmmakers went out of their way to make sure the audience knew that this film was not anti-muslim terrorist. So the villain was a terrorist with no motivation, other than (like any good terrorist really) hating the US government for no reason(I mean,that's not offensive is it?). Here's another thing-what happened to Val Kilmer? He seems to have swelled like a south american toad. Its really not becoming. I think the essential statement made by this film is that viewers are so stupid it doesn't matter that the movie is illogical,predictable, unscientific because they'll watch it anyways.

  1. I absolutely loved Man on Fire, starring Denzel, and the same director (Tony Scott) was handling this film.

  2. The plot was intriguing and I was pretty sure the movie would take some risks. Plus, Denzel Washington is nearly always compelling, always watchable.

  I wasn't disappointed. Yes, the plot has some holes (so I only gave this one 4 stars)but it is also a combination of suspense, science fiction thriller and even a love story. I found it fascinating.

  Without giving too much away, I'll simply note that the plot revolves around a violent crime and a Federal agent (played superbly and with great understatement by Washington) who is brought in to help solve the crime.

  That is when things take an interesting, time-bending twist, making for that extraordinary film that rises above the average ones. It doesn't hurt that the rest of the cast is good, from Val Kilmer to Jim Caviezel.",1179532800,,991,4.781065088757397

Motivating Denzel's character, in part, is his desire to save the beautiful woman the terrorist used as a torch to in essence light the bomb. Gradually, Denzel's character becomes convinced that maybe he too can cross the time barrier and take matters into his own hands.

1600172,4,B00005JPD0,"I watched the blu-ray version of this film, and the picture is stunning. Color saturation, black levels and sheer image crispness make this movie one of the finest i've seen yet on blu-ray. As for the movie's story it's pretty simple. Washington is an atf-agent sent to investigate a bombing aboard a New Orleans ferry where he meets Val Kilmer's character. Kilmer's an fbi agent who is in charge of a top secret ""surveilance"" project assined to this case as well. It's pretty clear early on that there is going to be some time travel in this flick, especially with a title like ""Deja-vu"". But the director knows how implausible this premise is, and tries hard to pull the viewer into the emotional side of this bombing first. This works with a lot of help from Washington's conviction to a beautiful victim of the attack...or is she? All the little clues of her death & the case in general don't add up. This combined with Denzel's performance makes the viewer care. It makes us want to stop this thing before it ever happens. I could empathize with Washington's desperation to try anything to help the girl, and of course stop this 'terrorist attack'. It's at this point where the film draws you into the techincal side of how Kilmer's fbi-team accidentally figured out a way to witness the crime scene before it actually happens...hmm. Anyhow, there are some nifty action pieces a lot of which revolve around the premise that all the events leading up to the attack are intertwined. True, there are a few times where whats happening onscreen can be a little confusing. That's okay. The movie-goer is supposed to be in a flux at these times. It's all going somewhere, so don't overthink it. One could endlessly analyze all of the parallels of time-travel until...well, the end of time, (ha-ha)...instead, just roll with the premise of this film, and have fun.

We know that Denzal came out a hero, saving the womens life and the lives of all the people on the ship, but we don't know how his actions altered the future that he already lived.  Another problem with the movie is that it is too predictable.  I had a pretty good idea of what was going to happen and how it was going to end.  I had ideas of how the future would have been changed, but those went unconfirmed.  Besides that, the movie was good.  There was a decent amount of action, and the scienctific ideas brought into play made it very interesting.  I like how they toyed with the idea of the Einstein-Rosen bridge, making it seem like a somewhat believable physics concept.

1600176,4,B00005JPD0,"The combination of talented Denzel Washington, with mega hit producer Jerry Bruckheimer and action thriller director Tony Scott help create an intriguing film shot in New Orleans around the time of Katrina.

Washington plays Doug Carlin, ATF agent called in to investigate a terrorist bombing of a ferryboat on Mardi Gras Tuesday killing more than 500.  Washington who lost his partner played by Matt Craven in the inferno is alerted to the corpse of apparent victim of the blast, Claire Kutchever played by a fetching Paula Patton.  Autopsy results confirm that she's been killed before the explosion and has a connection to the bombing.  This evidence sets Washington on a different tangent as he teams up with FBI agent Pryzwarra played by Val Kilmer.

Kilmer introduces Washington to a clandestine FBI operation headed by scientist Denny played by Adam Goldberg.  The scientific team using Eisteinian theory have created a device which enables them to pass through a wormhole to observe the past.  They hope to discover the identity of the killer.  Washington, in the dark when explained the technology gets the brilliant idea to use it for time travel to save Patton and avert the disaster by altering the past.

Jim Caviezel playing super patriotic terrorist Carroll Oerstadt is creepily effective in his role as the bad guy.  Using some beautiful cinematography, well orchestrated special effects and a creative plot with similarities to ""Minority Report"", the film provides an enjoyable two hours of viewing pleasure, especially if you don't get bogged down in the nuances of the technology.",1179014400,,1599,5.162790697674419

1.  FBI guy wearing ""past viewing helmet cam"" at crime scene within a couple of hours of explosion.

2.  Reference to Denzel's character having worked at the Oklahoma City bomb explosion  (Theory is that FBI knew in ADVANCE of that explosion)

3.  FBI's super secret ""past viewing"" equipment only goes back to four days.  This means this had been collecting data from four days before the explosion.  And all that complex gear doesn't get set up in a few hours.  It would take weeks to set it up.  What a coincidence that it was set up in a city about to experience a huge ""terrorist"" event!

4.  ""Terrorist"" character has same ""profile"" as Timothy McVey.  Loner, super ""patriot"", etc.  His comment at the end saying ""It wasn't supposed to end this way"" tells me someone had TOLD him how it would end.  He wasn't working alone.

5.  Conclusion, this ""attack"" was a test.  It was known in advance. The FBI was ready for it.  They needed Denzel's Oklahoma City experience to see if he could solve the crime.  Next step, all major cities have this type of surviellence.

So again I ask my question; ""What is this film REALLY about?""

This film is a combination of Minority Report, Max Headroom, Star Trek and Enemy of the State.  Of course the technology and the ending is a stretch but it makes for an thought provocking flick.  Denzel, as always, puts on a great show.",1178928000,2,1523,4.527675276752768

I'm all about cashing in my suspension of disbelief at the movies, but this bending time rubbish was handed to the audience like it was no big deal.

The film, directed by the stylish Tony Scott, opens with tons of marines boarding a ferry to go to a party. We see smiling kids, happy families and all sorts of other joyful scenes.  Then the ferry explodes and over 500 people die.  Agent Doug Carlin (Washington) of the ATF arrives on the scene, clues are gathered and details of the crime are slowly put together.  Meanwhile, Carlin finds a dead body, a woman, who appears to have been a victim of the ferry disaster, but actually died a few hours before.  An FBI team led by Val Kilmer decides to let Carlin in on a secret.  They have special project that allows them to see what happened exactly four days in the past. They can't alter the past, but if what they want to see is within range, they can watch anything.

The middle part of the movie involves Carlin watching the dead girl, Claire Kuchever, go about her life as she approaches her impending death. This new technology allows them to identify the killer and ultimately apprehend him. The big question is, Carlin wonders, can this technology allow him to go back in time and prevent the murder of the beautiful Claire, and also prevent the Ferry bombing.

As with most time-travel viewers, the plot will often force more questions than it will give answers. This movie is interesting, the acting is good, but it also has a few problems. The time-travel questions aren't aswered clearly. Caveizel's character is wasted, and the ending seems out of place. Still, if you're a fan of the actors in this film, I recommend it, just don't expect too much, and you won't be disappointed.",1178582400,3,1782,4.670926517571885

Denzel Washington did a somewhat better-than-okay job as ATF agent Doug Carlen.  His character was not especially deep, but he had some great support, including Val Kilmer, Adam Goldberg, and a wonderfully psychotic Jim Caviezel.

Overly melodramatic and entirely predictable, the story is saved by the always convincing work of Jim Caviezel as the villian. On the other hand, Washington's acting is unfortunately stereotypical. He really needs to get a new persona - it's no fun to see him adopt the same sly, intense, smirking image that we have seen so many times. Maybe Clint could do it and we loved it, but DW? I don't think so. Ultimately this flick succumbs to its convoluted plot and instead of a gripping movie full of surprises we get a dismal bit of sci-fi confusion.",1178496000,7,807,4.65034965034965

That was basically my reaction after watching Deja Vu. Unlike similar action director Michael Bay, Tony Scott makes weirdly interesting movies as if you know it's not brain food yet you just go along with it (whereas in the case of Bay you can't get it out of your mind how much awfulness there is). It's got time aspects, it's got action, attempts at drama and at times it was even a smart script and that's quite surprising, really.

The one odd evidence, Carlin finds a group of people who specialize in a quite advanced technology: the ability to see 4 days into the past (they can't rewind or fast-forward, they can only just watch and manipulate from what angle to see from). Carlin uses this technology to try to prevent the murder of Claire, the explosion on the ship and the bomber responsible.

I gotta say that this feels like one disjointed film. First it's a forensic investigation a la CSI, then it's some kind of sci-fi thing, then just a straight action thriller. Now, it does each thing right but it does feel kind of all over the place. For a long while, there's a scene of characters basically watching Claire's life before she dies and you feel like ""wow, exciting...we're watching characters watching another character who's maybe a little aware she's being watched"".  Not to mention the science is quite out there. You can tell this was written by a guy who probably studied a physics textbook and said ""I know how we're going to write it now"". It's a neat idea but it's used a bit too sparingly although it does have one cool scene involving Carlin watching a mark on the ground while the technicians and the goggles Carlin's holding (which acts as a ""past viewfinder"" for lack of a better term) sees the grisly act that makes the mark.

Acting though is pretty solid although characters aren't necessarily one-note, just slightly uninteresting. Val Kilmer plays one of the members on the tech crew yet we barely know anything about who he is, ditto for the other 2 crew members. The only ones that get development are Doug, Claire and a bit about the bomber. It's hard to tell if this is a serious action thriller, a simple thrill-ride or a serious actioner that didn't handle the serious properly. Who knows. It's a Tony Scott movie (you know, Top Gun and Donimo?) so this is basically nothing new; good, but not new.

1600421,3,B00005JPD0,"Did you watch Deja Vu and think to yourself, ""Where have I seen Denzel Washington's character before? Am I experiencing Deja Vu while watching Deja Vu?""

Either a major coincidence has occurred every time Denzel was cast for his last 23 movies where each director successively said to him, ""Could you play the same character you played in your last movie?"" Or Denzel has just found a character comfort zone that he knows the audience will love every time. And indeed the Denzel character works. The last time I saw Denzel not playing the same character that he was playing in Deja Vu was all the way back in 1992's Malcolm X (he played Malcolm X).

Deja Vu was a good movie. I was entertained from start to finish. Good story with good story flow. Suspenseful. Some good twists. But you'll need to open up your imagination to director Tony Scott's attempt at how time and space can be shifted.

The whole time travel thing can often be very confusing, and if a director isn't careful (or just chooses not to try too hard), continuity issues can come crashing down on an otherwise good story. Scott pretty much goes with the latter in Deja Vu.

Time travel, as futuristic and Sci-Fi fantasy as it is on its own, is muddled by ""The How"" in Deja Vu. I am a spoilers biggest adversary, so I won't give out the details of The How, but I will say that the director relies on the viewers playing along with a weak time travel explanation a-la, ""Okay...we'll bite...the machine allows you to move through time,"" instead of presenting a ""hey-that-could-happen"" concept.

So in Deja Vu you get to see Denzel Washington in a role acting exactly as you would expect him to act (good but familiar), and you get a story that'll keep you interested for all 128 minutes.",1178236800,3,1754,4.555555555555555

1600428,4,B00005JPD0,"Deja Vu is a gripping and smart thriller about a Federal agent (Denzel Washington) who's investigating a ferry explosion. He's also investigating the murder of a woman who's death was staged to make it look like she was on the ferry. After showing his skills in finding evidence. He's taken to a top secret lab that has technology so advanced that they can investigate what led to the ferry explosion and who might've done it. Washington figures out that the equiptment isn't all that it seems. It actually can see into the past and might even be able to be used for time travel. He doesn't want to only use the technology to catch the killer but to stop the ferry explosion and to save the woman.

  The movie is fascinating through-out with a really good cast too. Denzel Washington is good as always and I love the supporting cast too. Val Kilmer is pretty good in a small part as an agent who brings Washington in on the secret project. It's funny how he trys to lie about the technology not being as advanced as Washington is starting to believe it is. Jim Caviezel is pretty chilling as the villian as well. Such a talented actor shouldn't be type-casted as a villian though. I mean come on this guy was Jesus after all lol.

  Anyway DEJAVU isn't only a good action thriller but it surprisingly works as a science fiction film as well. Plus the breakthrough technolgy time travel stuff is actually done in such a smart way that it almost convinced me that this kind of stuff exists. Even if I didn't entirely understand all the mumbo jumbo that was being said. The movie can be a little mind-blowing too. I'm still trying to figure out how everything is gonna work-out for Washington's character at the end. Still I can't say it's not a satisfying ending either.

1600430,4,B00005JPD0,"I think I will always remember watching ""Deja Vu"" as the moment when I realized that I was old.  Not ""old"" in the physical sense where I prefer to be asleep instead of awake or try to find a way to avoid walking up stairs, but ""old"" in the psychological sense where as you encounter others in the world around you the question that is always on your mind and threatening to come flying out of your lips is ""What the hell is wrong with these people?""  I say that because for most of the first act of this 2006 film that was pretty much all I was thinking.  The film is set in New Orleans, where there is an additional insult added to injury for a city ravaged by Hurricane Katrina when a massive explosion destroys a ferry, killing more than 500 people.  We have all seen footage of police, firefighters and other first responders dealing with the aftermath of 9/11, and they were uniformly grim, angry, and determined.  But Denzel Washington's ATF agent Doug Carlin and the other main characters are cracking way too many jokes.  After all, the Big Easy is Carlin's home turf, so this has got to hurt, even before the investigation becomes decidedly personal.  I understand that his humor may be a way of dealing with the intrusion of the FBI and others who ineptitude is always bubbling dangerous close to the surface, but director Tony Scott makes it really clear that a lot of children ended up dead on the Ferry.  Every time Adam Goldberg's character cracks wise, and he has some funny lines, inside my mind I am screaming, ""What the hell is wrong with you?  Dakota Fanning's little sister is dead!  Wipe that smile off of your face!""

The good news is that ""Deja Vu"" digs itself out of this hole, which is pretty impressive when you consider it had one foot in the grave with me from early on.  If you have seen the trailer for ""Deja Vu"" then you will not be surprised that they do a similar trick during the opening credits, but beyond that point the title is something of a misnomer.  There are a few points where Carlin might be experiencing deja vu, but once he understands the big toy the special FBI squad led by Agent Andrew Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), any feelings of having been there before are replaced by the obsession to change the past and save all of those people.  Despite the deaths of hundreds of people, for Carlin the focal point become Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), whose dead and burned body shows up on shore BEFORE the ferry exploded.  One of the things this movie does well is establish Carlin's abilities as an investigator.  Working as much by abduction as deduction and induction, Carlin knows that it was Claire's SUV that the bomber used.  He tells those in charge that if they solve her murder, they will find the bomber.

Pryzwarra offers Carlin the opportunity to do that via what is initially described as satellite surveillance tape that was shot three days and six hours earlier.  But it does not take our hero long to figure out that satellite surveillance is not going to be able to allow him to watch Claire taking a shower when she was alive three days ago.  Then it all comes down to finding out what is possible and trying to change the past.  At this point how much you like ""Deja Vu"" is going to come down to whether you are a science geek, in which case the scientific explanation for time travel and its attendant paradoxes provided by the film will probably drive you to distraction, or whether you are an incurable romantic, who likes the idea of love transcending death as Carlin tries to find a way to save Claire and everybody else.  For the former what matters is the method and the ability to willingly suspend belief, while for the latter it all comes down to the payoff of the film's end game, although I would add that also coming into play is how well the payoff is set up in terms of the time loops.  Wrapping your mind around how what has not happened has already happened is part of the fun here, whatever problems you might have with the theory and practice of looking into the past as developed in the film.

Bill Marsill, who co-wrote the screenplay with Terry Rossio (""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl""), shows up for the commentary track on the DVD and comes right out and tells us that ""Deja Vu"" is not so much a science fiction film as it is a love story: just one in which the first time the hero sees the girl it is at her autopsy.  I certainly agree because I kept thinking of the film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laura/dp/B00008LDNZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laura</a>"" a lot more than I did anything like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Back-to-the-Future/dp/B00006AL1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Back to the Future</a>."" I suppose ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Somewhere-in-Time/dp/B00004W46I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Somewhere in Time</a>"" is more in the ballpark as a cinematic reference point, but there is obviously a big difference in the method of time traveling between the two films (duh).  But that film would be the prime example of how a love story can overcome the limitations of realistic time travel.  I would not say that the payoff for ""Deja Vu"" is great, but it is pretty good given the specifics of the situation that it has set up.  Let me put it this way: when the credits started to roll I was not thinking, ""What the hell is wrong with these people?""

I was almost going to round up on this film despite the fact that I was willing to bury it early on because I really like Claire's involvement in the end game and the way the characters keep the focus on what is really important here.  Obviously, this is a film that you want to watch twice, so that you can better appreciate how all of the myriad payoffs are set up earlier in the film.  Final Note: In addition to deleted scenes and extended scenes, the main extra on the DVD is the Surveillance Track, which has Scott, Marsill, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer providing commentary during a ""seamless behind the scenes experience"" that cuts away from the film and back again to provide interviews and featurettes.  Not having to find the remote and push enter time and time again to see everything was a nice touch.",1177718400,10,6310,4.739488117001828
1600543,4,B00005JPD0,"I enjoyed Deja Vu quite a bit.  I really did not know anything about it beforehand, except for the title and that Denzel Washinton was in it. Now I am glad that I got to find out everything as the story unfolded on the screen, naive to the time concept central to the plot. Anyway, that is how Doug Carlin (Denzel's character) would have experienced it (ironically, though), so it was easier for me to put myself in his place--to discover evidence with him, to be surprised by the same events that he was, etc.

Therefore, I won't tell you very much about it, except that I was pleasantly surprised.  The opening scenes have some compelling shots that draw you into the story, and it isn't complicated to follow, but, at the same time, it is a smart film, in it's own way.  No one really completely understands about the ""true"" science of this anyway, so it is interesting to explore ""what ifs"". I saw at least one angle on the topic that was new to me.

I also liked how Agent Carlin fell in love before he ""met"" Claire and how he seemed to be compelled to save her at great risk to himself, as if he somehow knew that she belonged with him.",1177632000,8,1142,4.293023255813954

During the investigation, he stubles into a top secret crime research tool that allows one to look back exactly 4 days 6 hours into the past.

2.  Denzel Washington is such a good actor he can even take on roles that would normally fall into Steven Seagal or Jean Claude van Damme's hands;

3.  Jim Caviezel has played bad guys 90 percent of the time since playing Jesus, but is still a competent actor;

4.  Scriptwriters can get away with implausibility in movies like this, IF they are as well done.

1600546,4,B00005JPD0,"D&Eacute;J&Agrave; VU is a riveting film about time travel in tandem with crime investigation that works on every level. Tony Scott is back in his element as the top director of intrigue/thrillers. Working with a challenging script by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio that asks the viewer to accept the possibility of time travel, Scott is able to make the story work clearly despite the interplay of mixing the viewing of the past form the vantage of the present with placing a character into that past to alter it.

The setting is New Orleans, still suffering from the devastation of Katrina,  where a ferryboat explodes killing hundreds of people.  ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms) agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) is brought into the investigation of the 'accident' when he discovers elements that suggest the explosion was the act of a terrorist. Agent Pryzwarra (a very fat Val Kilmer) and his team of secretive experts (Adam Goldberg, Elden Henson, Erika Alexander and Bruce Greenwood) introduce Doug to a highly sophisticated machine that coordinates cameras and heat detectors from satellites and security cameras that is able to mix images and reveal the past - a tricky means of examining a crime scene ex post facto to capture the perpetrators.  Spurred on with Doug's discovery of a beautiful female body (Paula Patton) washed up from the water before the explosion, Doug examines all the evidence, observing the replay of the days leading up to the explosion, and finally asks to be placed in a time machine to return to the scene in hopes of altering the inevitable and unmasking the terrorist (Jim Caviezel).  How this occurs forms the climax of the film, and while many viewers may have trouble swallowing the time travel aspect, the action is so tight and the technique of creating the incident so convincing that few viewers will fail to be wholly involved.

The cast is excellent, beginning with Denzel Washington as a terrific lead to the work of Jim Caviezel and all the more minor roles in between.  The musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams and the cinematography by DP Paul Cameron heighten the tension of this exciting suspense movie.  Grady Harp, April 07",1177632000,,2187,4.989010989010989
1600547,4,B00005JPD0,"Time machines are not exactly a new and untested device in movie history. They come as 'serious' science fiction following H.G.Wells, or as hilarious comedy (which works well for Back to the Future), or as outrageous chaos, like the Butterfly movie; and this one, Deja Vu, may be the first terror thriller using it. I did not expect it to work, but it does! It is a surprisingly coherent story about trying to change the past. It is a thriller that thrills.

What it does not do, is, it does not keep me from getting dizzy. Time machines do that to me. It is probably impossible to be entirely logical in this kind of plot, because the principle may be clear and well known, but the how is obviously still in the dark. And so are a few questions, like e.g. what happens when you move into the past with such a machine and become your own contemporary? Intriguing.

'Only' four stars due to some of the plot's weaknesses. But I liked it.",1177632000,5,936,4.404624277456647
1600548,4,B00005JPD0,"Deja Vu is a very interesting take on the time travel spectrum directors, writers, and producers alike are all interested in. Tony Scott (Man on Fire, Enemy of the State) once again goes with Denzel Washington to boost his movie. If it weren't for Denzel's supurb acting, I'd give the movie 3, maybe 2 stars. Putting aside the silly time-travel lingo tossed around throughout, the movie itself has strong performances and good action/supsense...that's all if you're able to set aside the time travel idea. It IS a pretty far-fetched way to do the whole time travel thing. Movies should just assume you accept time travel, and spare the viewers a long, detailed explanation of how it actually works when everyone is just sitting there scratching their heads trying to figure out what the hell they're talking about. Adam Goldberg's character is our science geek who goes on for a good couple minutes giving a very vague explanation on their time travel conception.

Tony, spare us! Just assume we're ok with your time travel device and don't try to explain it...but, I understand why you would have to. Denzel is a question man in this movie, and boy he was so good in this movie. I love a good Denzel role (which I'm sure most of you do too), and his character is basically the reason this movie did well at the box office, and the reason I (along with many others) bought the dvd.

So, the whole time, Denzel and co. are trying to figure out how to go BACK in time to stop a terrorist (Jim Caviezel) before he blows up a loaded New Orleans faire boat (which is shown at the beginning of the movie). In the procces, gorgeous new commer Paula Patton is tossed in the mix of the whole bomb act, and thus Denzel forms an attachment to her, and is determined to go back in time to rescue her before she dies as she originally died in the beginning, but he wants to go back and prevent it (ahh, mind boggling huh?).

I know this sounds super Sci-Fi ish, but its really more of a romantic action thriller. The sci-fi aspect is overshadowed by strong performances by Denzel, Caviezel, and Patton. I think as viewers, you'll really enjoy this movie a lot by putting aside the sci-fi aspect and watching it for its suspense and thrills. I think Tony should stray away from trying to do far-fetched sci-fi from here on out and just stick to his high-octaine action thrillers...and use Denzel because as far as Im concerened, he's one of the strongest actors in Hollywood as of now. Pretty good plot, decent sci-fi aspect, great thrills, and awesome performances make up this movie.

1600549,5,B00005JPD0,"Preferably before you watch this movie, you should read the book called ""The Holographic Universe."" You should also read about the Montauk project, or study Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Time travel is possible and always has been possible. It is not science fiction. It is highly difficult to understand from our perspective, but it is not impossible.

If you are familiar with concepts of time travel and real nature of the things you see around us, then you will appreciate the depth of this movie. Because of the depth of this movie (by way of showing an accurate portrayal of the technology that has already come to fruition) I could give it no less than a 5 star review.

No other movie has attempted to show what is really possible without screwing up the realism by going totally overboard. This movie, while lacking in trite organization, is filled with semi-realistic technology and physics concepts that are normally non-existent in the realm of Hollywood.

Because, as per the story, he saves the hottie after crashing the ambulance. Granted, it hadn't happened yet, to him, but to his past self in that present time, it had.

1600634,4,B00005JPD0,"'Deja Vu' is a thoughtful, edgy thriller that uses time-travel well.  Starring Denzel Washington as FBI Agent Doug Carlin, we find a truly intelligent operation that uses state-of-the-art surveillance equipment to reconstruct the past.  Agent Doug works with his skeptic supervisor Pyramarra (Val Kilmer) to put the pieces together for a terrorist attack on a Navy ship.  Finding a night before victim, Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), he is able to trace the crime back to its origins.  In pursuit is Timothy McVeigh-like suspect, Carroll Cerstadt, (Jim Caveziel).  Can he put both present and past pieces together to meet in one healing kiss?

'Deja Vu' is as much alike and different as 'The Lake House'.  Both using time travel, this film is much more plausible. 'Deja Vu' has a head that leads the heart with the latter picture working in reverse.  The screenplay and technology pave the way to past and present that suspends our disbelief with greater ease in this outing.  The dialogue and development are much more solid with a romantic bond between the hero and his leading lady.  The chase scenes and investigative scenes complement one another without a wasted moment.  'Deja Vu' draws from mind bending innovations--like 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'--even if it is more mainstream, but remains a better exercise for both heart and mind.",1177372800,3,1358,5.099547511312217

While there are contradictions to every result of the movie, every other movie about time travel doesn't recover as well (I'm thinking of you Timeline).

The acting is great (Adam Goldberg does great as Denny). The visual effects and qualities are great. And there are enough questions lingering (up until the end) to keep you guessing. I highly recommend this movie.",1177372800,3,657,4.963636363636364
1600636,4,B00005JPD0,"Tony Scott's ""Deja Vu"" surprised me since I had believed I'd seen all of his tricks as a director before. I thought this would be a mind numbingly typical Jerry Bruckheimer big explosion sci-fi thriller ride. While it does fit into that category, it's also surprisingly bright for a Bruckheimber-Scott thriller. I'd always thought of Tony as the less talented brother of Ridley since his films generally don't have a lot of personality but are solid workman-like thrillers. I guess Tony showed me (and all the critics out there as well). You'll note that there are 4 stars above but the system won't allow you to give half stars--this is really a 3 1/2 star film quite clever and enjoyable.

Denzil Washington plays an ATF agent named Doug Carlin who investigates the bombing of a ferry in New Orleans. When the body of Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton)up on shore that appears to be linked to the bombing he thinks that it's just another case of a body drifting down the Mississippi. What's even more mystifying is that she CALLED him only hours before the explosion and he's never met her before. That is until he realizes the person despite appearences to the contrary was killed and put in the water at least two hours BEFORE the explosion of the ferry. He takes this discovery to an FBI Agent (Val Kilmer)also working the case. The agent asks for Carlin's feedback on surveilance footage of the site and surrounding area from three days before the explosion. What mystifies Carlin is that the video feeds are treated like they are live and they are far too detailed to have come from satellite feeds. A science team working with the FBI has figured out a way to punch a hole through time to see 4 days into the past no more, no less and it must unfold in real time in other words they can't fast forward or rewind what they see unless it has been recorded. Now the team has to gather clues as to the identity of the bomber from this ""footage"" from the past. Carlin find himself falling in love with one of the victims who was killed by the terrorist(Jim Caviezel in a creepy extended cameo).

END OF SPOILERS

Imagine ""Time After Time"" combined with a contemporary thriller and you've got ""Deja Vu"" in a nutshell. Now I haven't given away the major plot twists of the movie (the trailer gives away TOO much information I might add)but if you can wrap your mind around ""Deja Vu"" you'll enjoy this thought provoking action thriller with as many twists and turns in its maze like storyline as you can imagine. I did find the ending predictable (I figured it out midway through the film but I was thinking about the only possible way the story could resolve itself successfully. That's not to a deficit on the part of the film's script or director that's just how I think. My advice--don't think about the film just watch it and go along with the flow).

Tony Scott turns in his usual tour de force of action direction here with nice character development for Washington, Kilmer, Bruce Greenwood (underused in his role I might add--someone give this terrific actor a role he can sink his teeth into again!). ""Deja Vu"" is an example of an extremely good mainstream Hollywood thriller. It's not innovative (unlike some of Ridley Scott's films)but it is a fun thrill ride that is definitely worth taking.

The DVD features an audio commentary/behind-the-scenes feature with producer Bruckheimer, one of the writers and director Scott discussing the development of the script throughout the film.  The feature will take you into behind-the-scenes stuff just before the scene occurs much like seamless branching that allows you to watch two different versions of a movie or like HD-DVD where you can watch behind-the-scenes stuff while you're watching the movie. You can't do that here unfortunately but it is a pretty cool way to combine a behind-the-scenes featurette with the film itself seamlessly intercutting the two and you really don't have to do anything except turn it on.

We also get deleted and extended scenes with comments from director Scott as to why he cut them and most make sense. Sure there was more character development but he also comments--accurately--that these scenes slowed down a time sensitive film like ""Deja Vu"". This is the third go round for Scott and Washington and the films they make together have been terrific.",1177200000,4,4460,4.750645994832041
1600637,4,B00005JPD0,"Follow this fast-paced and hypnotic thriller through time and space (...okay, I didn't really mean to rhyme there...). Denzel Washington stars as Doug Carlin, an ATF agent called in to join a special forces unit that is tapped to discover the identity of a terrorist who recently killed over 500 innocent people in a ferry boat explosion. As Doug struggles to accept and understand the high tech methods utilized by this special unit to try to track this murderer, he unwittingly finds himself falling in love with a young woman who was killed in the explosion...or was she? Can Doug use the special unit's ""surveillance"" machine to transport himself back in time, and save the lives of so many innocents -- including the woman he's falling in love with? Or will his attempts to change the past forever negatively alter the future?

Once the mechanics of the plot are understood, the average observor can theorize for themselves the natural course the storyline will take. In this respect, the big ""shockers"" of the film turn out to be not as shocking -- but in my opinion, that doesn't make them any less exciting. When they are initially explaining the way the unit's special surveillance machine works, it kind of throws you for a loop and you're left trying to digest this new information and understand it, while at the same time trying to keep up with the plot that has moved on without you. Afterwards though, it gets easier to understand, which is good.

As always, Denzel Washington excells at this particular type of role (you know, the strong, in-charge detective, who will stop at nothing to save the day). Val Kilmer and Adam Goldberg embody solid supporting roles, providing some much needed nuggets of comedy and sarcasm amongst a sea of thrills, chills, and edge-of-your-seat drama. James Caviezel's character is in a very minimal portion of the film, but he is still important nonetheless. James seems to excell at being the really creepy guy in a lot of movies -- he is very good at it, regardless of the amount of screen time he receives.

The film is a little choppy, with key elements appearing very early in the film, and are not elaborated on to the point where everything makes sense until much further in the movie. This sort of editing reminds me a little of the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memento/dp/B00003CXZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memento</a>&nbsp;in that respect, although ""Memento"" utilizes this out-of-sequence kind of editing far more than ""Deja Vu"" does. Either way, it's a lot of fun to try to piece everything together, and do a little vicarious sleuthing to try to figure things out before each twist is revealed.

Special features on this DVD include deleted and extended scenes, and a few specially formatted ""behind the scenes"" type featurettes designed to tie into the theme of the movie, which is kind of cool. Overall, it's a good disc, and is probably worth owning, even if it's the kind of movie that can't be watched very often due to the fact that it loses some of it's excitement once you know whats going on.

Bottom line, give it a try, and you won't be disappointed. Have I already said that? Whoa...deja vu...",1177027200,,3219,4.953703703703703

1600640,4,B00005JPD0,"The complicated plot of Tony Scott's thriller ""Dj vu"" may be scientific impossibility, but it is surely fun for most if the action film fans. This film is probably Scott's best since ""Enemy of the State"" with which ""Dj vu"" shares one topic - surveillance system, but the new film starring charismatic Denzel Washington is much more ambitious.

""Dj vu"" starts with a horrifying explosion that killed more than five hundred passengers of the ferry boat on the Mississippi. Denzel Washington's character Doug Carlin, ATF investigator attempts to find out the criminal, using the cutting-edge surveillance technology that can not only monitor the events of the past, but also do more than Doug and we think. This part you must see for yourself. Either you find yourself attracted to the concept, or you are disappointed, thinking it is just nonsense.

The uniqueness of ""Dj vu"" lies in the way how it develops the incredible story from the standard procedures of the agents investigating the case, to the territory of sci-fi thrillers that reminds us of such films as ""Frequency"" or even the world of P. K. Dick. Obviously Tony Scott chose not to use the flashy camera works that ruined his previous ""Domino."" Instead he opted for slick storytelling. It works, and ""Dj vu"" manages to constantly surprise us with plot twists and turns. In spite of several contrived situations that become nearly ridiculous, the film provides thrill to us by insisting on the difficulty of changing the course of time that we once experienced.

Some viewers would dismiss the convoluted story as utter nonsense, and that kind of reaction is understandable. Some might say they couldn't care less if the film has plenty of plot holes, but actually the script of ""Dj vu"" has a neat conclusion, which I am afraid, too neat. Still, with Denzel Washington's presence and Tony Scott's slick storytelling, I find ""Dj vu"" is a pretty enjoyable ride to the past and the future that might be.",1174089600,6,1960,4.897590361445783

If you like movies whose ending pulls together all subplots and even minor details, you'll get the pay-off with this one.  I prefer movies which offer varied subplots, if the director and script writer make it work.  This one delivers, and will twist your mind on the journey.

Mid-movie, we find out that we're watching a time-travel movie.  Yes, the thought came to mind that the story writer had recently watched Timecop (man goes back in time to try to ... well, I won't spoil it any more than that).

What I didn't like was that I also felt like the director had recently watched The Forgotten.  Deja Vu has that same kind of out-of-the-blue mid-movie genre twist into scifi.  I think that's cheap.

The other thing I did not like was the overuse of shaky-camera stuff.  Thankfully, that annoyingly vogue style of filming is utilized less in the second half of the movie.  I think it is a cheezy way of making the viewer think that frantic action is occuring.  I'd rather see clever scene delivery and truly captivating action.  It's better to create real tension rather than merely make the viewer feel that if you don't fixate on the screen, you'll miss something important.

Movie is about an agent (Denzel) who is called into a scene where a ferry ship has just blown up. He is to find the person who caused it.

He turns to a group of people that have designed a machine that can go back 4 days and some hours and see exactly what a person was doing at that time. For some reason, they can also transport items back to the past. This agent decides to transport himself back to the past in order to save the woman and the 500+ passengers on the ferry.

Movie is full of action. Towars the end it has you on the edge of your seat. The acting is great by everyone. It has a sorta sci-fi deal to it with the whole ""time machine"" but it is played off good for this movie's purpose. It doesnt come off as a joke.

1600758,5,B00005JPD0,"As usual, no synopsis here; just a comment. And, yes, definite SPOILERS.

When I realized at the start that it was a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, my reaction was 'cool'! A time travel theme done by Bruckheimer; what more could anyone want? With Denzel Washington and Val Kilmer to boot--plus one Paula Patton, who in the beginning on the morgue slab looks almost like Halle Berry, almost to the extend of making me think 'what the...', but then turns safely into a non-Halle-Berry, which is all good, because Patton has several times the personality of the former.

Since I write SF I am a clued-in kind of guy, and so when a terrorist/CSI tale turned into a time-travel story, well that was even better. It's a daring genre mix--a bit like The Island was--but that makes it more interesting. I know a lot of cinema goers get 'genre-confused' when the clues are pointing _this_ way at the start, but then the movie ends up going _that_ way, but in this case it worked.

The sci-fi premise was simple, supported by the inevitable and probably necessary bit of yak-speak in which the word 'wormhole' just _had_ to figure. But once you accepted the basic idea, it was followed through with fairly solid logic. That's the hallmark of good sci-fi premises, and especially those involving time-travel, and even more especially those set in a current-day context.

In this instance (last spoiler warning!) it was this:

Take any given location on the map. You can build a device that peeks a fixed amount of time into the past within a given radius around that location. Meaning that you can't peek outside the area thus defined. The only way you can do that is if you carry some remote to the device around and position said remote close to whatever you want to look at, since it was a much smaller viewing radius. Also, you can only always look at a given point in time a fixed interval 'behind' your current position on the time-axis; that is, if you are looking back using the device at time 't' and you can look back by an interval of 'dt', the point in time you're looking at is 't-dt'. Meaning you'd better look close, because if you don't you might miss it--and even recording what you see doesn't help, because you can't look everywhere. Just like you can't look everywhere right now.

That was the premise and they basically ran with it. I like those kinds of plots, because they allow you to spin out things without too much strain on credibility. Stephen Gould writes books like that: _Jumper_ and _Wildside_ are two examples of the same kind of approach. I've tried it myself. It's a very neat way of story-telling. Simple and clear premises often give rise to much more complex tales than worlds created with too much artifice.

Another thing I really liked abut Deja Vu was the nature of its characters. They were intelligent people and behaved as if they were. In other words, they were also 'competent'. All-too-often this is a neglected aspect of characterization that tends to make otherwise potentially great movies seem unbelievable. The viewer sits in the cinema and says to him- or herself (and to the character actually) ""Oh, come on, how could you not see that coming? What a dimwit!""

It doesn't happen here, and especially to the main protagonist. What he doesn't predict and can't factor into his decisions are things he genuinely cannot know--because stuff just happens and that's life. But when he _can_, he thinks and calculates and judges and knows well enough what's what. That goes especially for his ability to judge people. He's the kind of guy who'll try to convince someone that something should be done, but at the same time sizes up and assesses a given situation, and knows when it ain't working and people aren't going to do what he wants them to. So he smiles, pretends to be agreeable--and then finds the best way to get around the problem. No temper tantrums and really stupid moves.

I know some people think a character needs a significant 'flaw' to be interesting, but I always thought that there's plenty of 'interest' in someone being smart and competent. Life is complicated enough. 'Doug Carlin' is a character that could have sprung straight from a Robert Heinlein novel. Mixed in with his competence is 'backbone' and a capacity to make decisions about what's what and what he has to do, given that he is who he is.

Of course, part of what drove him was not just what would have driven him anyway (the notion that he could maybe prevent the deaths of several hundred people), but the fact that he fell in love with the woman the back-in-time-peekers were peeping-Tom-ing at, and whom he'd previously seen on a slab in a morgue. That was very sweetly done, and also very believably. Another example of how the whole movie hung together almost seamlessly.

Great flick. Worth every dollar my wife and I spent on seeing it, and more.

1600759,4,B00005JPD0,"Dj Vu is the perfect blend of science fiction and action film for the average movie watcher as well as the science fiction fan. At its core, it is a thrilling, well paced action adventure story about an ATF agent, Doug Carlin, investigating a terrorist bombing on a ferry full of US Navy sailors in New Orleans. 540 people are killed in the massive explosion, but one young woman's body washes up and doesn't seem to fit with the other victims; though it looks like a victim of the explosion, the body was discovered 8 minutes before the bomb went off. Other pieces of evidence regarding this victim quickly lead Carlin to roughly piece together where she fits in the puzzle; unfortunately, none of it is enough to provide leads to the perpetrator.

When Carlin presents his information to the FBI agents in charge, they are quickly impressed by his keen ability to size up a crime scene and filter out the noise from the pertinent details. They invite him to join a new test project that uses the latest technology to analyze a crime scene. Though the FBI and scientists involved try to hide the true nature of the technology, it doesn't take agent Carlin long to realize that there is more to it than advanced surveillance camera processing. This is where the science fiction weaves itself into the crime action drama film. While testing a new high-powered telescope technology, a way to bend the fabric of space/time is discovered, allowing the ability to watch the past in ""real time"" exactly 4+ days before.

What makes this film work so well is that the action mostly takes place in the present, but the technology leads to some very good storytelling and the most interesting car chase ever conceived. I had read in some positive reviews that as good as it was it didn't fully make sense...well they are wrong - it complete sense - just pay attention to the details along the way and the story comes together nicely. Yes, there are a few inconsistencies - whose explanations probably were left on the cutting room floor to keep the film well paced - but they are small. If you have a basic understanding of the physics and space/time you can piece them together yourselves; if you are not, don't worry and ignore them because they don't take away from this very film.",1168646400,93,2274,4.640198511166253

Add to that the superb acting of everyone in this movie (Denzel Washington plays his role to a T) and it's one of the most solid movies I've seen in awhile. It's not *special* enough to be Oscar quality, but its a movie you can enjoy watching again and again without getting bored or tired of it.

We have the Back to the Future films, the Time Machine and many more. Now, a new acquisition to this genre has been created. An entertaining thriller by director Tony Scott starring Denzel Washington: Dj Vu.

The story in short without any spoilers:

A ferry explodes in New Orleans and there are over 500 casualties. ATF agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) wants to investigate this chase till the bottom and gets the help of Agent Andrew Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer). Pryzwarra and his team have a special methode of solving crimes. They have the technology to look 4 days in the past. With this methode, Carlin has a chance to change the past.

The story feels a bit farfetched sometimes but is well worked out and leaves an entertaining and thrilling impression. The performances by the actors are great and Denzel Washington definitely steals the show. He was a great choice for the leading role. The story takes the characters from good dramatic scenes to thrilling action sequences. Trust me, following someone over a busy highway who is 4 days in the past is absolutely spectacular.

The film is well balanced and leaves you with a satisfying feeling inside.

The atmosphere is also something that helps the film, which is mostly created by the colourwork. Green and dark colours give the film a serious and thrilling look. Another thing is the music, composed in a certain style that gives the film it's special feeling and sound.

So Dj Vu has become a good and entertaining thriller with fine acting performances and a fantastic story that gives you a fun time at the movies. Recommended to action and thriller fans.",1168128000,9,1753,4.807308970099668

Best described as a time travelling action mystery, ""D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu"" is highly entertaining.  Denzel Washington brings a typical Denzel Washington performance to the film, and that is just fine.  He is not stretching here, but the performance is familiar, and it gets the job done.  The story is interesting and not too confusing as time traveling stories can sometimes be.  There are some action sequences, but they are not as prevalent as one might expect from a Tony Scott film.  Overall, ""D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu"" delivers the entertaining diversion that it sets out to provide, and I recommend it.",1165881600,3,1259,5.087804878048781

Five minutes until the end, you still don't know what is going to happen.  In this day and age of audiences being spoon-fed story lines that are way too predictable, this film is a breath of fresh air.

As we were leaving the theater, we found ourselves discussing ""But if THIS happened, THEN..."" type questions.  We started yelling ""Ow! Ow!  This makes my brain hurt!""

So there you go.  Deja Vu is a suspenseful adventure, has an intriguing plot, is full of great acting, has huge explosions,  and contains a terrific ""chase"" scene (following somebody 4 days in the past on a busy highway is a neat trick).

Absolutely worth a second viewing!",1165622400,5,801,4.788321167883212
1600861,2,B00005JPD0,"Even Denzel is entitled to the occasional flop.

Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington), an agent with the ATF, arrives on the scene of a horrific ferryboat explosion in New Orleans. As the various agencies investigate the cause of death of hundreds, including many service people, Carlin lets his senses lead him to the bridge crossing the Mississippi. There, he discovers a possible accelerant, confirming the explosion was probably caused deliberately. He soon meets FBI Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) who introduces Carlin to a special project he is working on with Denny (Adam Goldberg), Shanti (Erika Alexander) and Gunnars (Elden Henson). They appear to have a very sophisticated surveillance system set up and they give Carlin a story about how they are able to amass information from surveillance cameras at various locations, to provide a look four days into the past. But Carlin realizes they have more than that; they are able to zoom in, move through walls, hear Claire (Paula Patton) talk. Claire, a victim who washes up before the accident happened, and deliberately made to look like a victim of the ferryboat explosion, becomes their number one lead. As they watch her, Carlin becomes suspicious and soon learns this ragtag group of people has created a time machine of sorts, but it can only look four days in the past. Soon, they decide to send a letter to Carlin, two days before the accident, leading him to the potential terrorist, Carroll Oerstadt (Jim Caviezel). But Carlin's partner gets the message instead, leading to a dangerous situation. But if they can send a printed message to the past, couldn't they send something larger?

""D&eacute;j&agrave; vu"", directed by Tony Scott (and from the first frame you will recognize it as one of his films) and written by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio (he was one of the writers of ""Pirates of the Caribbean""), sets up its own logic, which is fine in a fiction film, but in the end, it cheats on its own rules, robbing the film of any suspense it may have been able to generate. Part of the point of working in fiction is that you are able to set up your own rules, govern your new universe. If you have to cheat on yourself for the climax, you haven't done that good a job setting up the universe in the first place.

As soon as Denzel struts into the middle of the crime scene, you have hope for the film. Perhaps it will turn out okay. Just perhaps. And Washington is Washington. He has played cops in numerous films and this is no exception to that work; he is a commanding presence, forceful and mesmerizes you on the screen. As Carlin, he appears to have seen many crime scenes, adding both experience and world weariness to his persona. As soon as he arrives, he lets his instinct lead him to the nearby bridge and the discovery. Then he has an assistant pull surveillance tapes and immediately spots the motorcycle driver who stops at the side of the bridge, at the same time as the accident.

But as soon as Carlin comes into contact with Pryzwarra and his team, the story moves into a more fantastical realm. The film has to work hard to make us believe what is happening. To accomplish this, the filmmakers have created a scene in which Carlin watches surveillance tapes of Claire. Okay. That could work. But the scene goes on for an eternity, as Carlin watches this character move through her life and we hear him bark instructions at the team. ""Can we move in?"" ""What is she reading?"" This leads to quick intercut shots of hands moving joysticks, cameras zooming in, etc. The shots of Claire are given a high tech treatment, which does little to disguise the fact that we are simply watching another character without interacting in her life. Worse, Carlin is doing the same, simply watching her as a passive observer. It doesn't make for the most exciting viewing. However, the filmmakers also want us to believe Carlin is becoming attracted to her, simply by watching her.

Unfortunately, this scene also occurs at the beginning of the second act. Many action films fall into the trap of a slow second act; the detective is investigating, the wrongly accused man is trying to prove his innocence. Generally, this is where the writer's and director start to kick in the story. The first act had some good action, here is why. Hopefully, the third act will wrap things up with a bang. But just watching another character is not very interesting.

Naturally, with a time travel slant on the story, whatever happens in the beginning of the film will be revisited during the conclusion. But this time, the hero will be participating. Carlin is now part of the action, racing to stop Carroll from blowing up the ferry boat and all of those service men ready to party in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. Now attached to Claire, he gives her a specific set of instructions, mainly stay off the boat, but she has seen one too many damsel in distress films and naturally doesn't follow his instructions, making herself a liability to his actions.

I can't really tell you how ""D&eacute;j&agrave; vu"" cheats, because I would have to reveal the ending. But how lazy is it for writers to create their own set of rules and then cheat on them. If you realize the rules aren't going to work, change them at the beginning of the story. Make them work. That's what you do when you are writing a piece of fiction. If you make the rules, your universe, and the people's actions believable enough, the audience will go along for the ride. Because the writers didn't bother to work out these details, the film is even more of a letdown than it needed to be.

As soon as the first frame of film hits the screen, you will recognize this as a Tony Scott film. I could tell from the first moment of the trailer. No other filmmaker appears to have been so clearly influenced by MTV and made it his signature style. Scott rarely uses one shot when he can use one shot. In the beginning of the film, and near the end of the third act, Scott's camera lingers over various servicemen, jovial with anticipation for the upcoming Mardi Gras celebration. There's an officer with his wife and small daughter. There is a group of school children with their teacher. There is an elderly couple, ready for a vacation. There is a woman passing out beads to more service men. Rather than show a single shot of the officer, his wife and their child, Scott's camera lingers on them for seconds, then jerks away and we then see the same thing from a slightly different angle, before jerking away again. Few shots are static or longer then a couple of seconds. Perhaps Scott thinks this will imbue a sense of drama within his film. It merely resembles an overlong music video.

Tony, no amount of camera work or over editing will help disguise the problems inherent in a bad screenplay. If your story is good, you don't need to do this type of thing all the time.

The one good thing about the film is that it is set in New Orleans post Hurricane Katrina. In one scene, they follow a lead into the Ninth Ward and the cameras reveal the devastation still prevalent in that area. Perhaps this will help call some attention to the fact that the city still has large areas of destruction, where the garbage hasn't even been cleared up, and the rebuilding has yet to begin. But in order for that to happen, people would have to see the film. I don't think a lot of people are going to see ""D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu"". Perhaps they feel like they already have.

1600862,4,B00005JPD0,"So what if the terrorist is one lone nut who was rejected by the military for being too much of a psycho.  Muslim terrorists are getting boring.  9/11 was in many ways a fluke and occurred because the people who could have stopped it weren't allowed to for a variety of reasons: FBI guys had ""sharp elbows"", CIA guys were being ""geeky"" when they brought it up, etc.  If just one element of oversight hadn't occurred, they would have been stopped.  And we could have destroyed most of Bin Laden's network if the hawks hadn't pushed for Iraq.  Come on, it was some people with box cutters who can be easily stopped if everyone is allowed to do their job.  The Patriot Act was just a sham to erode civil liberties and gain momentum for later activities.  I personally dig the idea that loner Caviezal is pretty much proving to the world how good a SPECOP soldier he could have been by masterminding and carrying out this entire thing by himself.  That's a unique concept and he plays a convincing sociopath of the type that is capable of raping and murdering in some foreign war if they had accepted him.

I also like the time machine, as it bares a close resemblance to the believable one in Twelve Monkeys: a huge superconducting-supercolliding, high-voltage, solid-state thingy with a bunch of logistics surrounding it...and a teeny little portal on the business end.  That and the techno-babble involved had an air of authenticity.  The scene where Washington shines a laser pointer at what previously he just assumed was a flat-panel display is absolutely genius.  So many times during this film in the theater I could see half the audience literally lean forward in anticipation.

One of the strongest elements in the film is the acting.  These people all have excellent chemistry.  The writing is also neither overdone nor underdone.  I got excited when Val Kilmer tells the head tech to ""turn off the lights"" when he's finished, rather than give some lecture about grandfather paradoxes.  We feel like they really have gotten to know one another in the last few days and are willing to give each other respectful room to make choices or take risks.  That speaks to a surprising level of emotional maturity to the writing that carries back over to the acting, especially in Washington's moments of longing for this dead woman.

And finally, this movie is a feat of post-production.  This is by far the best looking Tony Scott film, from both an aesthetic standpoint and a technical one.  The ferry explosion was flawless.  In the time portal lab or office, whatever you want to call it, every single color was lovingly tweaked, right down to little pastel highlights on laptop corners.  And I gotta say, Century Theaters at the Orleans Casino did the film print proud.  I've been wasting my money over at the Palms, where the lamps seem to be in low-contrast econo-mode and the teenage projectionists appear to need glasses.  D&eacute;j&agrave; vu won't win any non-technical Oscars, but it's not a bad way to spend $8.",1165276800,3,3023,4.767307692307693
1600863,1,B00005JPD0,"Wow, what a daring approach to terrorism they must have spent countless hrs to work that in so that it doesn't - god forbid - offend anybody. A lonesom guy with no affiliation or believes that would explain that motivation, just another faceless cookie cutter villain.

My main beef however is that time machine movies rarely work (with maybe the exception of Orson Wells classic) because there are no consequences that stick and it becomes painfully ovious when you get to see the same scene for the second or third time (especially when it wasn't particulary interesting the first time around).

Denzel might have tried this 100 times like groundhog day before he got it right and it doesn't matter, because its not a compelling story and the car chase gave me a royal headache",1165276800,10,779,4.762962962962963
1600864,4,B00005JPD0,"Director Tony Scott and Denzel Washington's ""Man on Fire"" is one of the best films of the last ten years, though it was much neglected when it was released a few years ago. It features a towering performance by Denzel, a much tighter than normal for him directing job by Scott and a thoughtful and heartbreaking story that lingers in the mind long after the final frame flickers away.

Now Scott and Denzel have teamed again in ""Dj vu"" (literally ""already seen"") and though the results are not as dramatic as they are in ""MOF,"" it is a strong film due to several factors: Denzel's performance as Federal Agent Doug Carlin(his persona and mere presence on the screen gives anything he does importance and resonance), newcomer Paula Patton as Claire Kuchever (a dead ringer for Hallie Berry and just as talented) and once again Scott's taut and waste-free direction. The problem here is with the story or more to the point the part of the story about going into the past and changing the outcome of an event that hasn't yet occurred. The problem is that it is hokey and we've seen it done a lot better in Spielberg's ""Minority Report.""

All that being said, despite the creaky plot conceit, ""Dj vu"" is pretty terrific: basically a police/government, find the bad guy (a not the usual for him performance by James Caviziel who brings his patented humanity and kindness to this role and then twists it all up) police procedural drama filmed in gorgeous saturated color.

Though ""Dj vu"" is not a great film, it is a good one. Come to it with an open heart and mind and you will not be disappointed.",1165017600,38,1593,4.602112676056338
1600865,4,B00005JPD0,"MOVIE: Tony Scott is one of my favorite directors and it's too bad he has had some ups and downs recently. I was really looking forward to Deja Vu after I saw the travesty that was Domino. Then Ridley's movie came out and flopped hard. So I was in the mood for a good Scott film, thankfully Deja Vu is a sharp thriller that bleeds Tony Scott's ultra visual style. The plot is a bit over the top, but it's not so preposterous that you won't be able to enjoy the film. Essentially a terrorist blows up a ferry filled with navy soldiers on leave in New Orleans. ATF Agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) is assigned with the case of solving the crime and motive for destroying the ferry. An agent played by Val Kilmer offers Carlin the opportunity to solve the case by using a technology that is able to see any event 4 days in the past, a wormhole if you will. Carlin tries to map out the terrorist's location by studying a young woman's accidental involvement. The terrorists is played superbly by Jim Caviezal and the young woman is played by Paula Patton. Doug Carlin decides to use the machine to throw himself back in time to prevent the act thus saving the lives of hundreds of people. If you can suspend your belief for 2 hours then this film is simply great action entertainment.

The script was written by first time screenwriter Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio who has gained fame for co-writing the Pirates Of The Caribbean films. Tony Scott made this film his own and kept things really tight and focused. The scenes where the group of people are searching back in time to focus on certain locations for clues reminds me of the camera work that Scott used in Enemy Of The State. Scott's last two films (3 including Beat The Devil) relied heavily on his highly stylized exposures and quick paced editing. Man On Fire used this style to perfection while Domino was just a way for him to show it off some more. Deja Vu does have that same style but there is so much less of it, very similar to the way Spy Game was shot. He uses lots of close-ups, which make the movie really tense because we are always staring right into the eyes of the characters. Every time Tony Scott works with Denzel Washington it seems like a winner. Crimson Tide and Man On Fire were two extremely extraordinary action films. We also have Jerry Bruckheimer producing, which is great because he has such a great history with both Tony Scott and Ridley Scott.

One thing that I always look forward to when I see a Tony Scott film is the score by Harry Gregson-Williams. Harry Gregson-Williams is #2 favorite composer behind Hans Zimmer, and his electronic style matches Tony Scott's vision so perfectly. Tony Scott originally worked with Hans Zimmer and Zimmer scored Days Of Thunder, Crimson Tide, The Fan, and True Romance for Tony Scott. I guess Ridley Scott decided that he wanted Hans all to himself, so Harry Gregson-Williams was assigned the job of co-composer for Enemy Of The State and the two have worked together ever since. If you recall Spy Game's score and Man On Fire's score you could probably place your finger right in the middle of those two and sort of get a feel for the score for Deja Vu. Harry Gregson-Williams didn't go balls out like he did with Domino, but resorts to the piano and the occasional single trumpet to create tension. Strings back up the electronic parts of the score that has Harry Gregson-Williams written all over it. An interesting thing to note was that he used a unique technique of having the orchestra play the music in reverse and then forwarding it in the computer so as to create a unique feel for the central theme of Deja Vu. From what I can tell he only did that on the first cue during the opening credits where we see the logos. A terrific score that really enhances the film greatly.

ACTING: When you have Denzel Washington as your lead actor it rarely means a bad movie. As I mentioned before, Denzel Washington has collaborated with Tony Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer many times before. You can sense that everyone feels like they are in their element because the cast and crew are close. Another tidbit worth mentioning is that there is one scene where we see the young woman played by Paula Patton babysitting a little girl. That girl is Elle Fanning, sister of Dakota Fanning who played Pita in Scott's Man On Fire. Anyway, back to Denzel, he creates a great character here. Jim Caviezal was actually incredibly good as the terrorist. The only downside to that role is that the guy is just mentally unstable and that's why he does everything that he does, which is not very original when it comes to bad guys these days. Paula Patton plays Claire and while she doesn't really craft a character in this film she does provide support for Denzel Washington's character. Val Kilmer enters in his middle-aged scruffy mode and isn't the main focus of the supporting cast, but his presence is nice and he adds some credibility to the cast.

BOTTOM LINE: Deja Vu may be a little farfetched, but I really liked it as a sharp and smart piece of action entertainment. It was tense and kept me involved all the way through. There were no slow pockets in the film whatsoever. The fact that the bad guy is just a man with psychological problems makes the movie a little unoriginal, but Deja Vu will entertain you and is worth the price of admission.",1164758400,37,5375,4.538144329896907
