8747678,4,B01AKUNOAW,"The Million Eyes of Sumuru is a low budget, somewhat silly, somewhat sly parody of the Spy movies that were all the rage at the time. Shot entirely in Hong Kong and boasting a bevy of beauties including Shirley Eaton of Goldfinger fame. Inexplicably also stars Frankie Avalon whose action scenes involve a stunt double who is obviously Asian. A bit slow but gorgeous to look at and quite amusing in parts. Shirley Eaton returns for the less rewarding sequel but ditches the majority of the first film's cast other than the beautiful Maria Rohm who plays a completely different character. Directed by Jess Franco (Vampyros Lesbos) whose action sequences are weak, as is the film's humor, but he makes up for it with tons of fetishism, eroticism, unexplained plot holes, a non-sensical almost non-existent story and kitschy weirdness. All in all, a great, mindlessly fun double feature and highly recommended. Of the two, The Million Eyes of Sumuru is the best, considerably so, and I say that as a Jess Franco fan.",1471478400,2,1013,4.861271676300578
8747679,5,B01AKUNOAW,"The best Batman movie never made: George Nader does a nimble turn as a virile but slightly slapdash spy/hero (think Adam West's Batman if he played all the action beats as Bruce Wayne), Frankie Avalon is Robin in all but name, and Shirley Eaton is flawless as slinky, sadistic Sumuru, dealing death and domination in one dark stare. The template for Catwoman long before Bob Kane dreamed her up. ""The Girl from Rio"" is Jess Franco's usual hodgepodge of obsessive sleaze and lackadaisical craft, but ""Sumuru"" is a near-perfect artifact of a moment in low-budget filmmaking: light, a little crude, obviously short on dough but playing high cards in terms of style. It took capable, good-looking actors, threw them into a well-meaning whimsy, and employed the right mix of competence and corner-cutting to pull off a mock spy flick  that's fun to watch and re-watch. Mystery Science Theater be damned: this is a good time on the cheese circuit of movie making.",1466553600,2,957,4.907407407407407
8747680,3,B01AKUNOAW,"The two movies here are not very good but we should be thankful for companies like Blue Underground that make them available in blu-ray quality. Even though I will probably never watch them again I don't mind buying them because it's my way of supporting companies that put out these old movies. I know not everybody feels that way nor do they have the disposable income to waste on a DVD they will watch just once.

I give it 3 stars. Lets call it one star for each movie and another star just for the fact that these two movies are available on blu-ray.

The two movies, 'The Million Eyes of Sumuru' and 'The Girl from Rio' have basically the same theme and have some similarities but they are two distinctly different movies. The directorial styles are very different. 'The Girl from Rio' is directed by the very well known Jess Franco and has a very different style than 'The Million Eyes of Sumuru,' which is more straightforward.

Both movies star Shirley Eaton as a leader of an all woman, man-hating colony.

Blu-Ray DVD and Extras: The blu-ray quality is average. It's nothing extraordinary but better than any previous releases. The second movie, 'The Girl from Rio' comes with an interview of Shirley Eaton and Jess Franco.  It's about 15 minutes long and is quite informative for the amount of time given. Jess Franco speaks in Spanish but there are subtitles in English.

The Million Eyes of Sumuru:

This movie stars Frankie Avalon as Agent Tommy Carter and George Nader as agent Dick West along with Shirley Eaton as Sumuru. George Nader gets more screen time than any of them. The two agents are team up or more like, 'prodded' along by an English agent, Sir Anthony (Wilfrid Hyde-White). The movie is about a woman, Sumuru, who makes it her business to try to eliminate all men from power in the world and replace them with women. She owns one of the 200+ islands that make up Hong Kong. This is her base of operations where she has developed a small army of women soldiers and spies or whatever.

As the movie opens, we see the 17 sons of the richest man in China be killed by a bomb at his funeral. After the bomb goes off we see a sly smile break out on one of Sumuru's agents face. Sir Anthony, an English agent, wants Agent West and Agent Carter to assist him in solving a murder. A Security chief is kidnapped by Sumuru during the investigation and eventually, Sir Anthony sends the agents to meet up with Sumuru after they are framed (I think?) for killing someone in Italy. I know, this doesn't make any sense to me either. There were a lot of things I'm totally confused about in this movie. Somehow, Agent West is made President Boong's closest advisor after the previous one perished. I guess no background check is needed and foreigners are welcome for the position. Easy enough to get an assassin to kill the President. Sumuru just tells Agent West to introduce him to one her girls. After an assassination attempt, the President and his bodyguard just allow West to leave and take the girl into custody without so much as questioning her nor do they make much of the fact that West introduced her to the President. West just makes a bs excuse and they let him go on his merry way with the girl. The whole tone of the movie is sarcastic and the movie never really takes itself seriously. It seems like Frankie Avalon is still in one of his 'beach' movies. We also get Klaus Kinski, who believe it or not, plays the philandering Asian president! One of the usual problems of blu-ray quality shows up here, you see too much detail. Kinski's face has way too much make-up on it. Frankie Avalon's Agent Carter has very little to do here other than to sleep with the would-be assassin (Maria Rohm) and run around making jokes and looking for Agent West. Agent West bumbles along and somehow manages to stay alive. Ultimately it's up to Sir Anthony to call on the Hong Kong military to take on the forces of Sumuru in a climactic battle.

The Girl from Rio:

While this is not a great movie either, it does quite a few things better than the first one. Both movies border on being campy probably because they are campy. While the first one has a lot of comedy and is never serious, 'The Girl from Rio' doesn't have quite the same sense of humor. The humor is there but it is a darker humor. Much of this dark humor comes from Sir Masius (George Sanders), the bad guy who wants half of Sumuru's fortune. He seems to have no problem ordering people to be tortured or killed but can't watch and even reads 'Popeye' comic books while this is going on! Shirley Eaton is back as Sumuru and Richard Wyler plays Jeff Sutton, supposedly a thief who has made off with 10 million dollars.

The movie opens with Jeff Sutton running around with a suitcase filled with money that he has stolen. Sir Masius sends his thugs after Sutton with hopes of getting the money. Meanwhile, Sumuru has sent her agents after the same thing. Sumuru escorts Sutton off to 'Femina,' her island fortress guarded by supposedly top notch female soldiers. While here, Sumuru shows Sutton all her captives which are held in glass cages (where do they go the bathroom?) in which they are very slowly being gassed to death. Each captive is responsible for a big chunk of her money. Once again, it's her plan to take over the world. From here we find out Sutton's true motivation. I can't say much more about the plot without lots of spoilers. Sutton becomes the first person to escape 'Femina' only to be captures by Sir Masius. Sutton is now caught up in the conflict between Sumuru and Sir Masius. A battle for 'Femina' ensues.

Unlike 'The Million Eyes of Sumuru,' this movie contains quite a bit of nudity. The woman are scantily clad and there are quite a few nipples peeking out from beneath the very short tops. There is even some full frontal nudity. Also, this movie is taken far more seriously, despite the fact that it is more campy.

Both movies have 'weak' endings that are very similar and lackluster. 'The Girl from Rio,' in particular goes out with a wimper.

These are not great movies nor are either of them particularly good. 'The Girl from Rio' is definitely the better of the two. At least it has good direction. 'The Million Eyes of Sumuru' is a mess that could have used better editing.

In any event, thanks again to Blue Underground for making these available in Blu-Ray.

Recommended for fans of 60's spy thrillers and Jess Franco fans.",1462060800,4,6449,4.5322441960447115
8747681,1,B01AKUNOAW,"I just received my Blu-ray in the mail, and just finished watching the first movie, Million Eyes of Sumuru. First off, I was hoping to see a good part for either or both Frankie Avalon and Shirley Eaton, both of whom were under-utilized in most of their films. Strike one---neither has very many good scenes, as it seems to focus on George Nader's character, though I'm still not sure why, as he possessed a real lack of personality.
Second, I was hoping the Blu-ray would have all of the footage usually missing from films such as this. Strike two---after watching the film on youtube in a version at least five minutes longer, there are at least three scenes I noticed missing in this Blu-ray---first was right before Maria Rohm/Helga first meets Frankie Avalon, she is walking at night and finds his hotel; second is after George Nader/West is being tortured and Sumuru kisses him, the girl guard shoots his chains loose, then opens the cell door, shoots the woman prisoner, then jumps on him; third is the very ending, where Frankie and Maria exchange a kiss and talk of a future together---here it is totally missing!!!!
The third reason I purchased this is for picture quality--admittedly, it looks better here than on youtube, as the picture is sharper and not as blurry....but with all the missing footage, it was much more enjoyable on youtube, despite the poor picture quality, as you're are able to see the ending, and for free-----AND since the movie is so badly written, directed, and does not feature the stars I like-----Strike three, you're out!!!
My advice---watch on youtube for free.
I feel so ripped off. I am already sorry I purchased this, a real lemon----and I haven't even watched the second film!",1461974400,,1721,4.797979797979798
8747682,4,B01AKUNOAW,"I have an old vhs copy of this. It is good to see it in wide screen. One slight issue- it is not the complete film. There is a scene where SuMuRU tells
one of her guards to cut a prisoner down and kill him. She does so, then kills a woman in a cell, thrown him in and starts making out with him.
On this copy the scene stops just after she cut him down.
Aside from that, it's a fun little no brainer.",1461801600,,400,3.7176470588235295
