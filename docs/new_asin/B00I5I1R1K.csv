8639400,3,B00I5I1R1K,"As a big fan of Churchill, I was disappointed in this portrayal of the great man.  The actor makes him seem like a petty, foolish bully most of the time.  He was a complex human being, not an irritating small-minded politician.  It was hard to watch for that reason, but also because the background music was very, very harsh!  I kept turning the volume down low--or fast-forwarding past it--because it was so unpleasant.  Finally I just turned it off.  There are other, better productions about Churchill available, so I recommend everyone skip this one.  It's not worth watching.",1516406400,,581,4.86734693877551
8639401,5,B00I5I1R1K,"This is an excellent film. With the help of some fine actors it reconstructs the era of World War II when Winston Churchill succeeded Nevil Chamberlain and then had to make some very difficult decisions and even collide with his generals sometimes. Although his finest moment was without a doubt the Battle of Britain in July-September 1940, the film gives ample time to other periods as well like the campaign in the North African Desert, the complex decision making process before the invasion in Sicily in July 1943, the disastrous British adventure in the Aegean in September 1943 and of course Operation Overlord in 1944. Alongside Churchill parades a host of British and American generals of the time: Wavell, Ironside, Dill, Alanbrook, Ismay, Auchinleck, Montgomery, Alexander,  Eisenhower, Marshall, and of course FDR and Stimson from the political sphere. If you like to study World War II you will love this wonderful film of the 70s.",1471824000,5,944,5.090322580645161
