8675557,1,B001OI36J4,Complete waste of money. This is what you get with video technology available to just abut anyone. Just because you CAN make a movie doesn't mean you SHOULD make a movie. I don't care what your subject matter is but make it worth watching.,1428969600,,239,4.454545454545454
8675558,3,B001OI36J4,"If you're not a hockey fan, you will not understand this movie, but I think that was the idea all along.  Luckily, I am a hockey fan.  I wish they would have had more dialogue with the fans and less video of people constantly high-fiving each other, but I guess that's an Edmonton thing.  I found it interesting and creative in terms of focusing on hockey fans but I wasn't blown away by it though I will probably watch it a few more times.",1370390400,,440,4.214285714285714
