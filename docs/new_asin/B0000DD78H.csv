8000777,4,B0000DD78H,"A great action series with humor and plenty of fan service, but this is the creator's style of course. I may suggest a different series if you are not into panty shots and nudity, but it's all a joke pretty much. I love the action and characters and the designs. Enjoy.",1345420800,,269,4.294117647058823
8000778,3,B0000DD78H,Same story throughout - bring the Hermits back alive (if you can).  Story is repetative but enhanced by some good action sequences.  Lots of undies fanfair for those who interested in that kinda thing (sometimes you wonder from which angle they were making this animation...),1122854400,,275,5.088888888888889
8000779,3,B0000DD78H,"I will admit I am new to the whole Najica thing and I may not be the perfect reviewer but...I do watch a lot of anime and so maybe I know what I am talking about. These are not bad anime, what with the impressive art and well set up action. But I think that to place a rating of five stars on them is a little...pretentious.

The voice acting is so so and although a few people may experience increased heart rate because of all the undies, it seemed to me a little...campy. Like the artist realized they had a subpar story on their hands and something more was needed to kick it over the top. Well, I wasn't kicked. Something that especially irked me was the Pink Panther style music that really precluded me from getting to far into the story or the action.

In the end, Najica will probably play well with neophytes to anime and folks who like campy stuff (to each his own...). I, however, as a watcher of the greats like Akira and Ghost in the Shell, both of which receive a 5 star from me, chose to warn others like me. Najica is pretty immature. Says a guy who watched lots of anime. Oh I am going to get sooooo many unhelpful's for this. :(",1093132800,15,1147,4.162162162162162
8000780,5,B0000DD78H,"In this final DVD of the series we finally get to the meat.  While the other episodes were all stand-alone, these four are linked together with a common thread - humaritts are starting to think for themselves.  In fact the first two episodes deal with humaritts who do just that.  They lie, kill and refuse to listen to orders.  Is this the future for mankind's children?  will Lila change also?
In the last two episodes it all falls into place as Shinba Industrial attacks Dr. Ren's secret laboratory with their private army.  But Dr. Ren, the creator of the humaritts, has a private army of her own.  A massive battle outside the complex mirrors the one inside as Najica and Lila sneak inside.  But they will have to face Triple-X (a super-humaritt), a boy named Alpha (a male humaritt) and they have to finish the mission before an air strike levels the city the lab is under.
The ending is amazing, but not surprising for a Japanese anime.  They really bring the story together in the last 100 minutes.
Extras include previews, sketches and a commentary of the last episode with Kira Vincent Davis (Najica), Monica Rial (Lila) and David Williams, who directed Najica Blitz Tactics AND Angelic Layer.  The commentary is only interesting if you like women cussing and saying ""panty"" a lot.  But it's still fun to listen to.
I happen to love the closing song and I hope they come out with either a second series or a manga.  For age 17 and up.",1086739200,3,1444,4.575875486381323
8000781,5,B0000DD78H,"NBT is a like James Bond, only there's a really appealing female instead of an English man.  Najica is a super spy for the government when she's not working as the President of the most successful perfume company in the world.  The animation is very racy with gorgeous females in skimpy clothing in every scene and the action scenes are magnificant.  This is a very ecchi anime with each episode like a rollercoaster ride.  Najica's humanoid partner Lila is much like the character Chii from Chobits: ignorant at the beginning of the series, but she goes through a lot of character development until the end.  This anime is pure eye candy.  It's not meant to be a philisophical anime like Evangelion or .hack//sign.  Instead, it's much like Cowboy Bebop in that Najica must find and retrieve a line of missing humanoids who are usually causing trouble in the world.
Bottom line: This anime will keep you VERY happy for a few hours!!",1080691200,6,932,4.716049382716049
8000782,5,B0000DD78H,"The first two volumes of Najica were basically individual stories involving the same two people. Almost any episode could have been viewed at any time. In the third volume, however, Najica Blitz Tactics takes a sharp turn. All the stories have become very inter-related. The conclusion makes the series as good as it truely is. This aniume, in my opinion, as with most anime series that I view, end on a depressing note. This may not be as depressing as NGE or Noir ( personally one of the greatest animes ever, but also one of the most depressing), but it does take a turn from the joyous episodes prior. All in all, I enjoyed the series and I find that I enjoy the depressing endings.",1069113600,5,686,4.496
