The box set arrived to me with a damaged box.  The seller, DaaVeeDee, is no fun to work with.",1456876800,7,233,4.523809523809524
8509432,5,B0073UHUYO,"This is a review of the sitcom, not the DVD-box set.  Like the other review stated...Curb Your Enthusiasm (2000-2011) is even funnier than Seinfeld from the 90's. Hands down, the funniest sitcom I have ever watched.  This is comedy of the highest order...and I am very picky when it comes to something being ""funny"".  There is much comedy out there to choose from, but most of it falls flat on its face.  Curb Your Enthusiasm has something for everyone here.  It is situational comedy that mixes neurotic humor with old jewish humor.
Larry David is a comic genius he is up there with the greatest comedians of all: Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, Dave Chappelle, Chevy Chase, Peter Sellers, Steve Martin, Louis de Funes, Benny Hill, Dane Cook, Woody Allen, Bill Burr, etc.",1446422400,2,769,4.795454545454546
