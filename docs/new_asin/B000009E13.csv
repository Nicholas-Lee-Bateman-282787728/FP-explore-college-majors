1197851,1,B000009E13,I was expecting this movie to be great considering this was the guy from Brotherhood of the Wolf. What a disappointment. I fast forward through alot but still couldn't bring myself to finish watching it. The plot is slow and the actions sequences look like a TV shows.,1018396800,3,268,4.604166666666667

This movie had the potential there but it lost it and was quite confusing in bits as well as being slow.
My recommendation is to see the movie first before you buy it.",995241600,4,393,4.116883116883117

It's a thought provoker, which is what I like about this movie. But you still get the action that Mark Dacascos is famous for...but he gets to stretch his acting muscles too. As for the title I chose for my review, it's as thought provoking as the movie.  In the end; this is the choice that Mark's character(Father Luke) must make! After renting it,  bought it!",993513600,14,534,4.2772277227722775

1197948,4,B000009E13,"Amazon Prime Included Film: The Plot has several major twists & turns; just enough to be sure that you are not ever quite certain  ""Who Are"" the Good vs Bad Guys. The underlying theme of Atonement is an ongoing challenging process for the films protagonist; ""Father John""; aka: Luke, Former CIA Black Ops specialist; despite his vows and new life as a Parish Priest in Chicago. The ""Hook"" of ""Reaping what one sows"" is also played out to the very end; with Father John once again having to face a major life-turning decision; and one is left with the sense of ""What Would I Do"" if in his same shoes ....  Quite a Clever Film produced in 1998. I give this a 4 star due to the fact that this film; as are what; 90-95% of Mystery-Suspense-Thriller movies for too many years; was filmed in very Low Lighting and Sound; making it difficult to see & hear details clearly; no matter how many adjustments I made to my screen.",1453680000,3,917,4.420118343195266

The characters were mostly kind of single sided; but the star was a complex character.  The script and dialog was good and delivery was pretty smooth and professional.  I didn't know about the star's fighting abilities until I read the other reviews after I saw the movie.  The music was OK.  Lots of killing.  I liked that in the one scene where they could have had some nudity, they didn't do it (though the stopping short was in line with the main character's new and developing personality.  It's the kind of a movie that, now that I know the plot, I won't want to see it again for a year or so.  One of the other reviews says that you better not leave the room or you'll miss something and not understand what's going.  It's true.  This is not a casually viewed movie.

You need to keep your eyes wide open all the time as you watch this 3 dimensional fiction or you will miss it.

How the CIA Clandestine services operates and expects those employed to always be a sacrificial lamb  when required appears to be a part of the plot.  Be assured though,  the action is straight to the point and the plot takes several turns, including an unexpected finale.

It might make one wonder, ""...is there another plot in the writers mind that will be covered in a follow up.."" say a  Sanctuary II?

The violence was excellent. It was shooting. It was exploding. There was kicking and punching. There was some reading at the beginning and ending but it was relevant. The bulk of the movie was in English and it was originally made in English. This movie was a recommendation by Amazon Prime for me.
