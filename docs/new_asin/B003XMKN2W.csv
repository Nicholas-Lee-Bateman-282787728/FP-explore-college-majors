4217709,3,B003XMKN2W,"Three years after his unsuccessful 1967 cinematic adaptation of James Joyce's ""Ulysses,"" director Joseph Strick had better results with Henry Miller's 1934 novel. ""Tropic of Cancer"" (1970) is one of the few notable attempts to translate the author's sexual exploits to celluloid.  Much of the film's success can be attributed to an outstanding performance by Rip Torn  ideally cast as the earthy Miller during his Parisian exploits. Unfortunately, Strick didn't have the budget (or was too arrogant) to film this classic literary work in its proper era.  Instead, he shot ""Tropic of Cancer"" on location in 1969  regrettably updating the sexual flavor and atmosphere of Miller's book. Nevertheless, Torn dominates every frame with his believable portrayal of the expatriate writer and his erotic obsessions.  Another standout is Ellen Burstyn's small but effective role as Miller's wife. If you can get past the modern-day look of ""Tropic of Cancer,"" you will find it a provocative and rewarding experience.  However, director Philip Kaufman's ""Henry & June"" (1990) did a better job of recreating Miller's world by not taking short cuts.",1276387200,7,1136,5.353932584269663
4217710,1,B003XMKN2W,"I was reading Ellen Burstyn's autobiography and I wanted to see her in one of her first movie roles. I didn't know anything about the movie except that it was considered dirty and explicit in 1970, but I thought it would be tame for today.  I hated it. I had trouble getting all the way through it because I couldn't stand ALL of the characters in it (and Ellen Burstyn is only in the very beginning.)",1212364800,2,401,4.276315789473684
4217711,5,B003XMKN2W,"This film, fairly explicit for its time, in its frankness with language and nudity, tells the story of Henry Miller (excellently played a young Rip Torn [you gotta love that name].
Ellen Burstyn (who looked surprising good in this movie) plays Mona [which had her be pretty revealing in the opening scenes of the movie; surprising me, since this was the '70's].  It seems tame in todays XXX world, but for the time, it was open and frank in its discussion of sexuality.  Although not very politically correct in its view of women, it did reflect much of what Miller writes/wrote in his books.  Although the VHS copy had some garbled sound (considering the age of the movie, or perhaps the copy I had) it was a pretty decent movie just the same.  Not for everyone, and some might argue the NC-17 rating, but it's not a bad early exploration of erotica by one of the most famous (or infamous) names in literature.  Given the restrictions of the times, they did a pretty decent adaptation of the book.",1082419200,21,998,4.584269662921348
4217712,2,B003XMKN2W,"Tropic of Cancer, the book is filled with titillating imagines, it flows uneven at times but somehow remains focus. Our little movie here is like a dream of the book. Clouded and fuzzy, but still titillates. Henry Miller was alive with the soul of an angel, disguised in the body and mind of a scoundrel. I believe if you love his work, you'll appreciate this movie. It's uneven, to be sure, the dialog drifts apart at times. However, you will enjoy the moments of recognition and taste the infatuation with life, even when faced with despair.  Of course Henry and June, the Kaufman Movie is superior, however, it's the uneven parts of ToC that remind one of HM's Books. Life is uneven!",1016755200,5,686,4.622950819672131
4217713,5,B003XMKN2W,"Reading Miller gives you an immediate feeling of being alive. Sitting at the drive-in watching this movie with friends and a bottle of homemade wine, I believed that I was indeed living it up...and maybe I was! The  actual Henry Miller made a tiny cameo appearance at the beginning of the  picture.",956966400,9,298,4.711538461538462
8408369,3,B003XMKN2W,"Based on his novel of the same name, this is a literary, erotic and humorous story of Henry Millers exploits in Parissponging off friends and pursuing romantic liaisons. There is a lot of beautiful women, full frontal nudity, and vulgar language throughout. Weak plot and mediocre acting make this a movie you can skip without missing much [regarding a good film, at least]. If you choose to view this film out of curiosity, make sure the kids are out of the room.",1511136000,,464,4.670731707317073
