8011427,3,B0001EQIHY,"""Red Ryder Double Feature Vol 3"" has two movies on the disc namely
""Fighting Redhead"" and ""The Cowboy and the Prizefighter"".
Red Ryder is played by Jim Bannon and his companion Little Beaver
is played by Little Brown Jug.

There have been a number of actors playing Red Ryder and Little
Beaver during the course of the series but I believe this
combination to be the best.

Both movies are in cinecolor and they virtually heralded the end
of this long running and popular series. Each movie has a good story
with plenty of action and shooting.

All lovers of B grade western films should be more than satisfied with
this disc.",1282003200,3,626,4.571428571428571
8011428,5,B0001EQIHY,"This third volume in the Red Ryder Double Feature gives the assignments to the great B-Western film director Lewis D. Collins...featuring Jim Bannon as Red Ryder, Little Brown Jug as Little Beaver, Marin Sais as The Duchess, Emmett Lynn as Buckskin Blodgett and some great screen writing from Eagle-Lion Studios who took over from Republic Pictures...both features are just under an hour, but what an hour each one brings to the big screen...hold on to your hats (cowboy hats, that is) and we'll travel down that dusty trail together.

First up is ""Fighting Redhead"" (1949/Cinecolor/56 mins), featuring Jim Bannon as Red Ryder, Little Brown Jug as Little Beaver, Marin Sais as the Duchess (Reds Aunt), Emmett Lynn as Buckskin Blodgett, Peggy Stewart as Sheila O'Connor, John Hart as Faro Savage, Forrest Taylor as Dan O'Connor, Lane Bradford as Henchman Wendy, Lee Roberts as Henchman Goldie Grant, Bob Duncan as the Sheriff, Sandy Sanders as Joe and Bill Hammond as Bill Evans...Red Ryder has his hands full with Faro Savage who is rustling cattle from neighboring ranches...Dan O'Connor sends for Red to help him handle the situation with Savage and cattle rustling...fiesty daughter Sheila O'Connor is too proud to accept help from Ryder until her father is gunned by Savage's henchmen...Bannon does a good job portraying Ryder and trying to solve the murder of Dan O'Connor and put Faro Savage behind bars is a true detective episode...not as much action that we're use to from Wild Bill Elliott or even Allan Rocky Lane, but still pretty good.

Second on this double bill is ""The Cowboy and the Prizefighter"" (1949/Cinecolor/56 mins), in the fourth and the last Red Ryder Film Series...once again Jim Bannon as Red Ryder, Don Kay Reynolds (Little Brown Jug) as Little Beaver, Marin Sais as the Duchess (Reds Aunt), Emmett Lynn as Buckskin Blodgett, Don Haggerty as Steve Stevenson, Karen Randle as Sue Evans, John Hart as Mark Palmer, Lane Bradford as Henchman Deuce Sampson, Marshall Reed as Bart Osborne, Forrest Taylor as Miles Stevenson, Frank Ellis as the Sheriff, Bud Osborne as Ernie the Stage Driver and Lou Nova as Bull Mason the Prizefighter...Steve Stevenson saves Ryder's life and in payment Red gives Steve a job on The Duchess ranch...supposedly Steve's father committed suicide after losing his ranch when betting on a prizefight...there is doubt that it happened that way and The Duchess and Steve are out to prove otherwise...Palmer and Osborne are working together to get the Ryder Ranch...a scheme is in the works to have Ryder fight Bull Mason, but Steve who boxed in college takes Red's place...can Steve take Bull and save the ranch...when there is a robbery at the stage office, can Red bring back the loot or will he have to fight Bull, Palmer and Osborne to stop all the lawlessness...grab up your copy quick from Amazon or VCI Entertinment before they're all gone
