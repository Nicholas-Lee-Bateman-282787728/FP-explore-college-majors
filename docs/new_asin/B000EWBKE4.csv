2542033,4,B000EWBKE4,"This is a great video to understand how documentary's can capture such an elusive animal as the Cougar in an environment that is all its' own. Being able to watch a mother Cougar rear its' young was very educational and entertaining, I only gave it a 4 because I wished it was longer. If you or your kids are sensitive to hunting photos and hunters harvesting a cougar, then you may want to shield your eyes once they show the truck releasing the hounds. However, it's not anymore gruesome then watching an animal suffocate another animal on the National Geographic or Discovery channel. Cougars do hunt and kill too, and often not so humanely either, there is suffering involved. If you can handle watching a lion pride rip into a zebra while it is still alive, which is what you would see watching the National Geographic channel for example, then the hunting scene won't phase you. As a hunter myself, I think it would have been more responsible and intelligent to use a higher caliber handgun for a quicker harvest though.

I will definitely purchase more videos from Exploration Films, as their other videos depicting science and showing intelligent design found within life itself is highly interesting, and far more astute then the same ole' deaf, dumb, blind processes of evolution and natural selection.",1286236800,6,1312,4.857142857142857
2542034,3,B000EWBKE4,"I was feeling this documentary until they showed some hunters killing a cougar.  Yes, the cougar is not on an endangered species list, however, the narrator said they once lived in all 48 states and now only live in 10 of them.  They showed scores of 1930s photos of cougar corpses, implying that this was bad, but then they renege on that by showing a modern cougar murder.  The narrator ends saying something like, ""We are so blessed to have the cougar in our world.""  By showing a cougar murder by humans, the work basically adds, ""We are so blessed to have the cougar, BECAUSE THAT WAY WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO KILL IT FOR FUN!  :D""  I can't recall any other nature special where the murder of a threatened mammal was shown and implicitly portrayed as being a good thing.  Most nature documentaries are targeted at animal lovers or people the documentary makers want to see become animal lovers, so why show a murder of your subject animal?  I'm very disturbed by this inclusion and think it really shows a sign of poor taste.

My outrage aside, this was a cute work.  You get to see baby cougars and coo over them.  The narrator eventually explains why they have spots when their mother does not.  Back in my day, you didn't see humans filmed in wild life specials.  The purpose, then, was to make it look like the camera was truly portraying reality.  This work is filled with humans because they say it's hard to record and map the elusive cougar.  The scientists here basically want to pat themselves on the back a bit.  They briefly mention the cougars in Florida.  I wish they had said more as I imagine that they are almost extinct.  Idaho is sparsely populated with humans, whereas Florida is the third most populated state.  I imagine that West Coast cougars have must better lives than Floridian ones and thus it's easier to make a documentary on them.  A focus on the cats in Florida may have inspired environmentalists and others who promote biodiversity more.",1193961600,8,1973,4.582857142857143
2542035,1,B000EWBKE4,"You would think this was just a cute video - but my daughter went to tears as we had to watch a ""hunter"" kill a cougar with multiple shots from his pistol - what POOR taste in a ""nature"" video. BUT worse, this video seems to be a cover for anti-evolution creationist ""science"" as you would learn from all the DVD extras. Go rent or buy any of the wonderful David Attenborough DVDs instead (The Living Planet, The Life of Birds, The Life of..., Life on Air, and MANY more). David brings you the REAL science and wonder of nature - like nobody else.",1193356800,6,547,4.269230769230769

8114862,5,B000EWBKE4,"Great documentary! I have seen ""Living with Wolves"", also filmed by Dutcher (and I highly recommend it), and he once more lived up to the standards of filming previously unknown behavior in captive animals roaming a large space (and not in a comfortable setting such as a zoo). If you love wild cats, then I would suggest this documentary. I just wish it was longer...",1457049600,,368,4.676923076923077

8114865,5,B000EWBKE4,"This is a great addition to any curriculum or animal oriented child.  I don't always want to worry about detailed ""mating"" information so I was glad to find this did not have that.  There was only one or two times wherein the Cougar was hunting and killing prey but it was not graphic.  Overall, very informative and enjoyable.",1382572800,,327,4.603448275862069
8114866,5,B000EWBKE4,There aren't very many mountain lion documentaries out there so this one is great.  You really get to know about the cat.,1370736000,,121,4.5
8114867,5,B000EWBKE4,"I am not basing these remarks on the DVD, but on a VHS copy of this film that I made when it was shown years ago.

This is an excellent film that shows some pioneering research by Maurice Hornocker, probably the world's foremost authority on the mountain lion.  Most of it focuses on observation of a more-or-less domesticated mother cougar and her cubs, and on the efforts of Hornocker and his team to prepare the cubs for life in the wild.  The film also provides historical context, describing the mass slaughter of cougars (and other so-called vermin) in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

As with any realistic nature documentary, there are grim and unpleasant scenes, including the death of a cub.  The most troubling scene, mentioned by others here, is of a mountain lion hunt led by a guide; this is something of a digression in the film, and Hornocker and his team clearly were not participants in the hunt.  I strongly disagree with the comments here suggesting that the film conveys an approval of the killing of this lion, and am frankly mystified as to how it can be so interpreted.  There is no explicit commentary on the killing, but it seems quite obvious to this viewer that we are meant to come away from the scene with a strong distaste for this ""sport.""

Not having bought the DVD I have not seen the extras, but as for the film itself, I am equally puzzled that one could find an anti-evolution agenda in it.  There is not the slightest mention, explicit or implicit, of such issues.",1304121600,3,1516,4.626865671641791
