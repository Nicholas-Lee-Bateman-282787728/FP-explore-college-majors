What I got instead was an overdubbed, Japanese-language copy of the movie.  Once again, not an English version with Japanese subtitles, not a selectable English/Japanese language track; AN ENTIRELY JAPANESE UNSELECTABLE AUDIO TRACK.  The Japanese voice actors don't even sound remotely similar to the actual actors.  It's practically a comedy!  Imagine Samuel L. Jackson with a tiny Japanese man's voice speaking Japanese for awhile then saying ""Quarter Pounder.""  Then John Travolta with a slightly fuller (yes, FULLER) Japanese voice speaking Japanese followed by ""...Quarter Pounder?""
