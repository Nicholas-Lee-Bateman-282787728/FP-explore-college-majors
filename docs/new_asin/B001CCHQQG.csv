3508384,4,B001CCHQQG,"This is a finely danced La Scala New Year's Eve Gala which primarily features the set from Scala's Swan Lake with guest artists dancing mostly scenes from Swan Lake but also Sleeping Beauty and the Nutcracker. Roberto Bolle is a classy dancer with beautiful style and dances the Swan LAke excerpts well. I found Polina Semionova to be also a very fine dancer but her acting is a bit coy for my taste. The Rose Adagio, the Bluebird Pas De Deux and the Pas De Deux from the Nutcracker are solidly danced but no fire works here. It would have been nice to see some party pieces danced by the artists especially Bolle but no such luck. The Gala portion of the DVD lasts about 90 minutes and is filled out with an unfocused film about La Scala and Milan at Christmas including some scenic but pointless travelogue-type footage of Milan at Christmas and some backstage scenes of the dancers rehearsing. Sections of the film are also used to fill the actual Gala recording. Given the steep price of the DVD, I would have preferred more dance and less filler.",1227225600,25,1051,4.536842105263158
3508385,5,B001CCHQQG,"From the stage of La Scala on the last night of 2007, this is the first Blu-Ray ballet title that I have viewed and I give the high-resolution format high points for clarity.  There probably will be no motion-picture format that captures movement perfectly, but Blu-Ray comes the closest yet.  I was very critical of DVD motion ten years ago, so I am not damning Blu-Ray with faint praise here.  The dance motions may still be a little blurry, but the sense of space, and depth of field around the performance definitely adds to the sense of dance.
The camera operators here could have benefited from being raised a little higher than floor level.  The sets and dancers look taller from this angle, and the profiling is great, but there isn't much toe room at the bottom of the screen, and the floor geometry of the choreography is entirely lost.  At least the feet are not frequently chopped off as in many ballet videos.
I appreciated the PCM 2.0 sound better than the DTS HD Master Audio 5.1, but my current Blu-Ray player does not have the multiple analog outputs that will extract the best sound from this disc.
Now for the program.  This has more continuity of action than a usual gala, splicing excerpts from three ballets together.  Act III of Swan Lake acts as the framework within which cameos appear from Sleeping Beauty and the Nutcracker.  All three ballets have a big showcasing act with multiple solos, duets, quartets, sextets and ensembles.  So, for example, Bluebird and the Rose from Sleeping Beauty suddenly crash Siegfried's party in Swan Lake.  That is interesting as a concept but there are some things I didn't like.  The black swan appears at the beginning of the party, and the evil wizard introduces not only her but each of the individual acts thereafter.  He seems transformed into the Fledermaus (not even as threatening as the Mouse King), and this trivializes the danger underlying the beauty in all three of these ballets.
Much is made in the liner notes of the contribution of Italian dancers to the premieres of the Tchaikovsky ballets.  This is true.  As long as this gala is, perhaps a complete performance of Swan Lake would have only lasted a few minutes longer and would have been a better tribute to the link between La Scala and the Russian ballet repertoire.
These are Italians, but they are not Neapolitans.  The tarantella is a pretty sad spectacle.  Anybody from south of Rome could have probably given a more spirited castanet dance.  No tarantulas bothering the feet of these Milanese girls!  I hate to be negative, but Tchaikovsky was paying a tribute to Italian dance with that number, and yet the Russians dance it better?  Come on!
Not to let the Russians off the hook, however, I have never been fond of that joker introduced into Swan Lake in the early 1950's.  I tolerate him when he crashes the stage of the Kirov or the Bolshoy, but I don't like to see him invading Italy.  The wicked wizard has been tamed, but the joker has grown in menace and seems like the real nightmare presence for the first half of the program, dancing the very first number and then weaving annoyingly among the onstage guests.  If Von Rothbart has become kinder and gentler like the Fledermaus, then the Joker seems to be a younger version of Rigoletto.
Roberto Bolle assumes a modest stage presence, and doesn't get a lot of dance action.  He is billed as ""etoile"" but never hogs the stage, leaving that to the joker and the wizard.  We have become accustomed to gigantic egos in male dancers, but it was not always so, and Bolle shows how commanding a presence he can be without a big head.
Many classical discs have really annoying audio clips while the main menu is on screen.  Not this one.  The menu page shows the well of La Scala, and on stage there is a whole duet segment between Bolle and the black swan, Polina Semionova of the Berlin Ballet.  Very nice, and I don't mind hearing it over and over after the program is over.
I like the final bows taking place during the music, not as a separate event afterwards.  So the gala is wrapped up in a nice ribbon, with New Year wishes at the very end in several languages, wineglasses for every body on stage during final waltz music.
I give this five stars because though I would have staged it differently, these people at La Scala know what they are doing and I cannot fault them for it.  It was New Year's Eve, so they deserve a little leeway.  At least they weren't throwing firecrackers at each other like the people outside in the Galleria!",1226620800,12,4537,4.6
8286639,4,B001CCHQQG,"It's alright...you get 3-4 ballets available on one disc.  I'll appreciate it more as we get closer to the Chrismas season.  If a lot more ballets were done in this fashion...four to a dvd, that would be nice.",1434326400,,209,4.473684210526316
8286640,5,B001CCHQQG,"How much did I like the Blu-ray of La Scala's 2007 New Year's Eve extravaganza called Tchaikovsky Gala? After watching the copy I'd received from Amazon, I read a review that said the regular DVD was better than the Blu-ray, and so I ordered the DVD to make sure I had the best version possible.

Anybody want a DVD?

I'm not particularly fond of videos of opera aria recitals or composers' greatest hits or holiday concerts in general. As I scanned video productions of Swan Lake, I passed over this disc many times despite its tempting cover. After I had seen every 21st century release of Swan Lake and a bunch from the 1900s, I came back to this Gala -- the sort of thing weak, hopeless addicts are prone to do -- and the wicked angel sitting on my shoulder somehow made me click on ""add to cart"" and then ""proceed to checkout."" If I ever find the little devil, I'm going to give it a big wet kiss.

There's more coherence to La Scala's soire than you would think from reading the list of tracks. In fact, a fitting subtitle might be, ""The Lake of the Black Swan, Brought to You by La Scala's Roberto Bolle.""

Some Amazon reviewers are disappointed Bolle doesn't perform more at the gala. Instead, I count it to his credit that he so generously gives way to a glittering procession of talent rather than hogging the limelight. Other negative remarks bemoan the disc's ""skimpy"" 114 minutes. That running time does include a half-hour special feature (in standard definition) about the artists in rehearsal, but I'd say the event's duration is just right. The quality of an experience is not measured by its length in time.

The video begins on the streets of Milan, which is decked out for the holidays, and brings us into the Teatro alla Scala, where conductor David Coleman first leads the renowned orchestra in playing the music for the pas d'action from Swan Lake's Act II. While that is underway, we are taken backstage for a rare and revealing glimpse of the dancers who are preparing for the show.

When Swan Lake's overture follows, we see the beginning of Vladimir Burmeister's mid-20th century choreography for the ballet, which La Scala used in its 2004 Swan Lake production&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swan-Lake/dp/B0040Y7EME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swan Lake</a>&nbsp;with Bolle and Svetlana Zakharova. A princess (Polina Semionova) enters in front of the curtain, is engulfed in Rothbart's huge cape, and after a sleight-of-hand costume change, emerges as the Swan Queen, now Rothbart's prey.

I won't try to summarize what takes place for the next hour or so, but it's terribly entertaining. And teasing, like a burlesque, all leading up to the 23-year-old Semionova's dynamic entrance as the Black Swan. Bolle's Siegfried is hardly the only one captivated by Semionova's Odile. She is magnificent. I had not seen her before. I hope to see her again and again.

It would ruin the tease to tell the ending. Suffice it to say that out of disparate parts is born a satisfying unity. This would have been a wonderful night to be in Milan. And thanks to BelAir's superb Blu-ray, which looks and sounds as good as any I've purchased, each of us can re-experience that night anytime we want.

I don't see how I could ever tire of such a journey.",1408233600,2,3306,4.868327402135232
8286641,5,B001CCHQQG,"The Black Swan pas de deux of Polina Semionova and Roberto Bolle is brilliant, worth watching several times.  One she spreads her wings you know he doesn't have a chance.",1384905600,,170,4.666666666666667
8286642,4,B001CCHQQG,"This Tchaikovsky Gala recorded at the Teatro Alla Scala  Milan, Italy , is, at same time, sumptuous and entertaining. A year-end extravaganza staged to celebrate Tchaikovskys most popular and loved ballet music. As regards the dancers, this particular recording has the benefit of many outstanding artists who perfectly fit their roles. Undoubtedly, the Swan Lake  black swan sequence  performed by the dancers Polina Semionova and Roberto Bolle is simply admirable and filled of enraptured sequences in which the world of reality and illusion are merged. I really enjoyed watching this Blu-ray Disc: stunning dancing and outstanding quality of recording.",1370822400,,655,5.595959595959596
8286643,5,B001CCHQQG,"I suspect (although I am not certain) that a Naxos-issued Tchaikovky Gala item on offer from Amazon.com does not correspond to the the DVD which I reviewed that appeared under a simpler form of my name (""Gerald Parker""). Amazon may have posted that review which I had written to at least one Amazon entry too many.

I refer to the ""Tchaikovaky Gala"" at the Teatro alla Scala, starring Roberto Bolle and several other famous dancers, which is a publication of Bel Air Classique (BAL-037), not of Naxos.  Naxos has offered on DVD or CD a few gala events of music and/or dance which include, in whole or in part, music of Petr Ilich Tchaikovsky, but I doubt that it has duplicated the availability of La Scala's Tchaikovksy Gala with Bolle et alia. If my hunch is right about this, Roberto Bolle and other dancers of La Scala's ballet troop probably would not appear at all on whatever gala event that Naxos has issued. ""Caveat emptor."" However, let the buyer rest assured that Amazon.com indeed does offer the Teatro alla Scala gala with Roberto Bolle and his fellow star dancers on other Amazon listings for it, and at quite advantageous prices, too!",1288569600,,1149,4.711442786069652
8286644,5,B001CCHQQG,"Acquire this DVD (Bel Air Classique BAC-037), or the alternative blu-ray edition, if you do, for the sake of this Teatro alla Scala ballet gala as a whole, rather than for the sake of one dancer alone. I say this at the very outset of my comments, because the relative prominence in the product's presentation of the great (and exceedingly handsome) Italian dancer, Roberto Bolle may lead the unwary buyer to think (as I myself had assumed) that he is purchasing a DVD of a ballet gala oriented to display Tchaikovsky's genius, of course, but also to serve as a ""star vehicle"" for Roberto Bolle's undeniably glamourous star qualities as a dancer and celebrity. It really is only at the end of this staged ballet suite of excerpts from Petr Ilich Tchaikowsky's ""Swan Lake"", ""Sleeping Beauty"", and ""The Nutcracker"" (to cite these works by their familiar English titles) that Bolle really gets the opportunity to do some relatively extended and blazingly virtuosic solo and female-partnered dancing. This 2007 gala in Milan is a showcase for La Scala's ballet troop as an entity, one that has attained status as one of the greatest in dance, now fully (well, very nearly, at least!) on a level with the longstanding fame of La Scala's opera forces and roster of distinguished singers.

However, that said, do not let the fact that Roberto Bolle (as Prince Siegfried) very much shares the spotlight and the glory with the dancing of several other male soloists, namely the very elegant Ronald Savkovic (as the Nutcracker prince) and the pert, diminuitive, and lively Antonio Sutera (as bluebird), very balletically ""cute"" (and, for such a role, quite appropriately so). Others of the male dancers impress mightily, too, but have rather less solo exposure in the choreography than do those men and the the roles which they perform. As for the female dancers, they are, predictably, very, very good, but I shall not mention them much further since I am trying to clarify the appeal of this gala for the sake of its several fine male dancers. The Teatro alla Scala's orchestra is world-famous for its excellence, which also adds to the lustre of the production and of this video product thereof.

Vladimir Bourmeister's choreography (incorporating some of the original choreography of Petipa and that of Patrice Bart) and his staging are traditional yet full of imaginative touches, stitching together music and dance from the three ballets into a simple tale of a prince and his royal parents who are viewing a choreographic concert held in their honour; this requires only a single set and facilitates the continuous action. It is a spacious and beautiful set of which the eyes never tire. The costumes for dancers, and for non-dancing personages, too, are rich, varied, and quite splendid, as well. The fairy-tale prince (the one whom Bolle dances) falls in love with an occultic lady beauty, but he is thwarted in his desire to obtain her for himself and so the ballet ends, after their final sequence of solo and duo dancing, with the prince being bitterly frustrated, but (thankfully!) still alive to lead the rest of his life, one assumes, without her. With the eye-poppingly attractive physical assets of Roberto Bolle's lithely slender and muscular physique (which enables him to do lifts and other demanding male dancing feats with the ease and smoothness of few others than Carlos Acosta and himself) and, of course, of his nobly beautiful face, one can assume that his character can have, when that day comes, any future princess that the prince desires among those who may come his way!

If the buyer would like to acquire such a gala production, with splendid choreography and a tale that only touches tangentially on the action of the ballets' original synopses, this is a worthy purchase. For those whose interest primarily centres on Roberto Bolle, another of Bolle's several DVDs would make for a better choice, especially in acquiring an initial sampling of his combination of impressively athletic skill, physical beauty, and superb artistry.",1288483200,,4055,4.995562130177515

8286647,5,B001CCHQQG,"A stunning example of ballet with dances to music from his 3 ballets ""Swan Lake"". ""The Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Nutcracker"".
It is unusual in that all the dancing from all 3 ballets has been integrated into the one scenario. Basically it uses the Swan Lake scene where the Prince chooses a bride and is duped into the wrong decision but the choreography is unique and is not the traditional scenes from those 3 ballets.
The staging, costuming and dancing are brilliant and the music is also appropriately excellent. It opens with the music of the love scene from Swan Lake played as an overture and then moves to a series of dances from the three ballets, so skillfully interwoven it has one perplexed as to which of the original ballets it originated.",1245542400,2,749,4.681818181818182

This was followed by some behind the screen excersizes before the dances began (where the whole program was 83 minutes).
