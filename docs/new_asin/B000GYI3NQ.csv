8135438,1,B000GYI3NQ,"Firstly, David Tennant and Matt Smith don't really work as 'keywords' for this 1/4 of a set. There are only FOUR episodes here. Amazon has the entire first series for just a few dollars more than this four episode set. $48 new and $36 used.
This is from the 2005 revival starring Christopher Eccleston. It originally sold for $19.99 in stores. I recently purchased this same DVD for less than $10 right here on Amazon.
Four good episodes, but not worth the inflated price.",1343606400,,472,4.630952380952381
8135439,5,B000GYI3NQ,"I absolutely love Doctor Who. I previously watched the series on PBS with Thom Baker as the Doctor.  My son discovered the series when David Tennant took over the role as the Doctor and we began watching together.  We are both huge fans of the series.  He owns all the dvd's including the Eccleston version of Dr Who and they are all terrific. Great acting and writing are a staple of the current Dr Who series. The stories are funny and sometimes quite touching.  I have laughed, been scared silly (the episode Blink) and even cried.  Excellent entertainment! I am sad that David Tennant is leaving the series and I hope the next actor to take over the role will be just as engaging.",1243209600,3,684,4.483870967741935
8135440,5,B000GYI3NQ,"He only last one season ( 2005), but Christopher Eccleston revive one of the most beloved SCI FI serials of all time, Doctor Who. In this 3rd Volume you will see the introduction of Capt Jack Harness in the 2 part Empthy Child - Doctor Dances, one of the greatest adventures of the Doctor. If you have the previous two volumes, this is a must, trust me.",1239148800,2,353,4.2835820895522385
8135441,5,B000GYI3NQ,"I've had a crush on Dr. Who for a long time because he is intelligent and low key and knows how to treat a lady.  This latest incarnation fills the bill that Tom Baker left when he was the doctor.  He is like the heroes of the past, Lancelot, Sherlock Holmes, Zorro, and all those daring men you fall in love with.  Also, the adventures are absorbing and take you all over the galaxy through time and space and I have always admired H.G. Wells and the Time Machine and all those movies about going through space and time.  The past or the future seems so tangible and yet, like death, no one will ever know what it's like.",1193011200,,622,4.201680672268908
8135442,5,B000GYI3NQ,"It is worth noting that the two-part episode included on this disk, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, set in London during the Blitz, won the 2006 Hugo for best science fiction Dramatic Presentation Short Form  -- and have the kind of dramatic quality that will hold up long after most contemporary science fiction will seem cheesy and dated. The courage and decency of characters that you really come to care about,the originality, in video anyway, of the ideas,and the superb dialogue and acting make this well worth watching.",1173312000,8,529,5.011363636363637
8135443,5,B000GYI3NQ,I purchased these dvd's without ever seeing the new Dr. Who. I am pleased with my purchase and will continue to buy future dvd's of Dr Who. I also will buy some of the older ones . Janice K.,1168300800,,190,3.8974358974358974
