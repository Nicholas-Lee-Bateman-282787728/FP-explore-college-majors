2260471,5,B000929VRC,"This film attempts to show the development of Yang style T'ai Chi from its progenitor - Chen style.  A difficult thing to do, it neverthe less succeeds fairly well.  The ""flying"" is kept to a minimum, and the ground fighting techinques, including a lot of chin na, are shown with some clarity and realism. The film also attempts to show the use of T'ai Chi against other styles of wu shu.  All in all, a good attempt.",1178409600,,417,4.3896103896103895
2260472,5,B000929VRC,"If you like watching martial arts, this is a fun show. Tremendous fight choreography and lots of it. Simplistic but fun plot. A good on to pop in the DVD player when you want to see some good action without having to think too much.",1171843200,,232,4.177777777777778
2260473,5,B000929VRC,"Wow, a real jewel! Be warned though, this is not 'a movie' per se, but a set of scenes chopped out of a chinese TV series and put together. Tai Seng has done this before for two Donnie Yen TV series but this time the commercial trick actually works: plot can be followed rather well and there is tons of action and actually some nice acting.

The coolest thing was the fighting, heck it's a series directed by seminal Yuen Woo Ping! Lots of long shots and a well made version of Game of Death pagoda fight, where Wu Jing rises floors and beats master fighters in each floor. Jackie Wu Jing is so awesome and the opponents kicked butt as well. Felt like a remake of Tai Chi 2 made in, but with fights done BETTER than most Yuen Woo ingP movies of similar style I can remember. And this comes from a big YWP fan. Even the sound effects rocked with big bass la The Fearless spicing most impact shots. Tons of cool (and wired) stunt falls with people flying all over all the time; always entertaining to see. Camerawork was phenomenal and doubling was done very well. Insane overall quality fight scene wise, at least for me. The best fights definitely catched the notion of 'drama' in aristotelian wise.

But my points go to the damocle's sword fight (the first one with tai chi masta), which is felt one of the most exciting fights I've seen in years, perhaps ever. Tons of intricate taichi, joint locking, long shots and sword interaction. A spectacle if I've ever saw one. A diamond of a match that lacks only in that it had in a couple of reused moves and rather 'normal' ending. Iron Monkey meets, hell, Damoclee battle opera!

Wu Jing acts mostly a goofy yet a ethical boy, a role which seems to fit him  exceptionally well here. Not a much of killing in the film either, reminds in that sense old Lau Kar Leung films. The mood is entertaining.

Sadly, no extras for such a brilliant chopjob. Just 5 trailers for a couple of similar films and three for similar TV series chopjobs Tai Seng seems to like doing. With this one I could't recommend this move enough. Yet I'd still would like to see the original series, the plot wasn't a bad one at all. Yet the fighting was absolutely phenomenal and a tribute to people like actors Billy Chow and Wu Jing and of course, the mastermind Yuen Woo Ping. Pick this one now, as local Hong Kong films like Fatal Contact are starting to make Jackie Wu Jing the next major martial arts movie star.

Oh and in case you were wondering, Tai Chi looks absolutely brilliant on the screen when it's done as well as this. Which I think is not going to happen anytime soon.",1169424000,2,2605,4.383022774327122
2260474,5,B000929VRC,"Tai Chi Master, note this is not the theatrical version with JET LI and Michelle Yeoh.  This tv/movie has some amazing choreographing that rivals most of the martial arts on film.  One thing that I liked was it had less 'wire fu' than the traditional yuen wo ping movies. The condensed tv program paces very quickly into the action and doesn't stop.  Besides the amazing Tai Chi that Jacky Wu displays, he goes into battle with all kinds of masters from various styles including a drunken master (reminds me of how kung fu video games stages are).  A must for martial art movie fans!!!! Tai Chi II is also sweet!!!!",1138752000,11,615,4.5636363636363635
2260475,5,B000929VRC,"Not only best Tai Chi but also i condiser best martial movie i seen, top performance and all area, is english dubb version from a 13 chinese epidose suprise cut down to perfect fit 2 hours it could be been little longer to explain some scene skip but chinese movie usually don't get over 2 hours any way.  Fight scene is aresome, a good exaple for tai chi leaner as well, great plot and acting whise,  if u think watch hero or matrix is amazing then u must watch this too seen a another masterpiece out there",1135987200,7,508,4.22680412371134
2260476,5,B000929VRC,"If you've seen Tai Chi 2 you know who Jacky Wu and Yu Hai are.  Oddly enough, Tai Chi 2 didn't seem to have an originating film.  Where the 2 came from I don't know.

Tai Chi Master is a compilation of a TV series starring both great martial artists.  Yu Hai gets to show off his Tai Chi while Jacky Wu is a natural and learns Yu Hai's martial arts from watching.  He gains such a high level of martial art skill that he realizes the philosophical aspects of the art and becomes wise for his age.  A true Tai Chi master.

In this film Jacky Wu and Yu Hai aren't connected in any way, but their roles are so similar it will feel like the first movie that goes along with Tai Chi 2, even though the characters and plot are completely different.

Being able to see Jacky Wu and Yu Hai in action again is worth the money alone.  As far as I know this is Jacky Wu's second film.  Yu Hai, as you know, has a decent list of films... an established figure in martial arts movies.  It's a shame he isn't in more films as good as he is.  Watching him move is like watching art in motion.

I give this film 5 stars because Jacky Wu and Yu Hai are two of my favorite martial arts actors.  Seeing them again is like coming home.",1128816000,15,1215,4.008333333333334
2260477,5,B000929VRC,"At first I thought I had bought a crap kung fu film,however,if you look past the TV soap style picture and sound quality,there lies a really cool kung fu film with a great story and excellent fight scenes masterly crafted by genius Yuen Woo Ping. In fact the film is actually an edited version of the TV series with the same name. I strongly recommend this title to hardcore kung fu film fans.",1123113600,6,393,4.397260273972603
2260478,5,B000929VRC,"First of all this isn't the Jet Li version of the same title. It's actually the edited version of the ""Master of Tai Chi"" TV series that showed in Asia in 1997. With fight scenes done by the Yuen Clan, it's better than every effort they've ever done (that says a bunch, too). No doubt it's the best examples of Tai Chi ever seen on screen. I watched the whole 25 episode series in Chinese only (without understanding) and it was still highly enjoyable. Now it's finally availible in English and easier to find, even though cut down to two hours. Even for non Tai Chi fans, still here are the most intricate fight scenes ever put on film, as well as a great storyline without dragging too much.",1119225600,40,693,4.37984496124031
2260479,5,B000929VRC,I loved this movie and believe it had one of the best action. Really fast. Jet li is awesome. Like most Hong Kong martial art movies it has comedy and action together. I don't recall any moment where I was bored in this movie. Fantastic movie.,1118102400,,243,4.304347826086956

8056603,5,B000929VRC,"From the legendary action director of THE MATRIX trilogy, KILL BILL 1 and 2, and CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, Yuen Wo Ping, comes this epic kung fu adventure starring Jacky Wu (TAI CHI FIST, THE LEGEND OF ZU)! Wu is Yang, am ambitious martial artist who leaves home to learn Tai Chi. But Chan, the Tai Chi master, refuses to teach Yang because he is not a member of the Chan's family. With the help of Chan's dauighter, however, Yang was able to learn to learn Chan's Tai Chi secretly. When Chan is kidnapped by the ruthless Lord Tun (Billy Chow from Jet Li's FIST OF LEGEND), Yang must use his newly learned Tai Chi kung fu to defeat his formidable opponent, but not before he fights Lord Tun's seven kung fu masters first.",1255305600,,727,4.432835820895522

8056605,4,B000929VRC,"This is basically an edited-down to movie length version of the TV series and therefore suffers from several continuity problems from a story point of view. Having said that, the fight scenes more than make up for the patchy story and if like me you have been longing for some more authentic looking tai chi and bagua in a movie then this is well worth getting hold of.",1226966400,2,369,4.4411764705882355
8056606,5,B000929VRC,"This movie has definitely moved into my top 10 movies of all time.  A lot of people complain about the photography and how the movie is shot, but I love it.  It makes the movie seen very real.

The acting is awesome, not too many corny actors and jokes no one really gets.  I was blown away by the acting and the humor of the movie.  The fight scenes in this movie take on a whole new high.  The movie does a great job with giving you background education on Tai Chi.

I definitely love this more than the Jet Li version which is still good as well.  If you are thinking about this movie think no longer and just get it, it is that good, so good I decided to give it my 1st review on Amazon.",1225843200,,691,3.9565217391304346
8056607,3,B000929VRC,"If you can get over the photography style of Chinese television, and assuming you enjoy kung fu flicks in the first place, you will likely dig this.  The photography bugs the crap out of me but I think I'm in the minority.  I can tolerate it.  What really makes it work though is the choreography of director Yuen Woo Ping.  Way less wires than he usually employs, which is a big plus in my book.  If only he could merge this type of choreography with cameras that shoot movies made to be shown on the big screen instead of this videotaped look.

This is the condensed version of a TV series that has Wu Jing, in an ""old-school"" time frame, wanting to learn Tai Chi from a man named Chan, who cannot teach outside of his extended family.  The women in his family cannot learn either.  This is why Chan passes his daughter off as a dude.  She helps Wu Jing learn by having him hide and watch her father practice and teach.  Billy Chow then kidnaps Chan and a whole lotta fights ensue.

Wu Jing and Billy Chow are both very good.  As is the older gentleman who played Chan.  I have become quite a Wu Jing fan recently.  Dragon Dynasty will release ""Fatal Contact"" later this month and I suggest you see it.  Not much on plot, but the fights in that are some of the best I've seen.  He's reason enough to see this one as well.

8056608,4,B000929VRC,"Though the movie is a patch-job of an earlier TV series, it's hugely enjoyable. I gave it 4 stars for two reasons :

1. The cut-n-paste job doesn't have the sheen of a regular production film and at a couple of points in the movie one can tell that there must have been something else to follow but has been cut.

and more importantly,

2. Some of the brilliant fight scenes have been cut. I know this because I have watched the fight sequences on you-tube and when I was expecting a certain move, I saw something else. MOVES WERE CUT. :-(

That said, for all you martial arts film buffs, I would slot this one in the same category as Master Killer (aka The 36th Chamber of Shaolin). So it's a must see movie ..... I'd even go so far as to say that it's a must have movie.

Enjoy !!",1192579200,2,782,4.118421052631579
