8184923,4,B000OGZE7E,Great product. I would definitely suggest to anyone.  Buy this for the right price. You won't be disappointed. I was very happy.  It was good.  Accent of lady was a bit rough.  Not bad.,1388707200,2,185,4.352941176470588
8184924,3,B000OGZE7E,"The video quality is awful.  It would be better if it was in HD.
Susan is difficult to understand. Her accent is pretty thick. Sound quality lacks on this dvd, so it makes her sound too muffled.

The video does show a cartoon knight and king that speak at different times in the video, which makes it more kid friendly. It's interesting though that these cartoon characters speak clearly and can easily be understood.

I wish they focused more on en passant, castling, and promotion.  They just briefly touch on it.",1384128000,2,515,4.626373626373627
8184925,4,B000OGZE7E,"The presentation of the material is done well. Ms. Poldar's accent is charming , but at times difficult to understand. All of the material is there ready to be absorbed, but it moves very fast, so that it is probably necessary to see the dvd several times before it is truly at your fingertips. Learning chess in thirty minutes is a lofty goal that a few adults may be able to accomplish, but a stretch for children.
I bought this for our school library for the beginning chess students. Hopefully they will benefit from it.",1324425600,4,524,4.526315789473684
8184926,5,B000OGZE7E,"Very nicely done .. a good gift for children.
