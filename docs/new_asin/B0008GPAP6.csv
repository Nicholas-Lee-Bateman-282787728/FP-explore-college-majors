2259408,5,B0008GPAP6,"I was really nervous about the prospect of breastfeeding. Many of my friends were so frustrated that they gave up after a few weeks! I watched this video before I gave birth and again when I got home from the hospital.  Within days my baby girl and I were in perfect harmony.  It answered all my questions with humor and in terms I could understand.  The demonstrations are great.  They actually got a new mom to breastfeed on the camera and the close ups were really helpful, as well as all the different ""holds"".  My husband watched it with me and was laughing too.  Since then, I've bought it as a gift for two of my girlfriends and they loved it.  Highly recommended!",1118102400,32,671,4.40650406504065
2259409,5,B0008GPAP6,"Although these are a little outdated, the information you learn is amazing! My husband and I were able to watch these from the comfort of our own home.  I took notes and then asked my doctor any questions I had.  I would recommend the entire set for all first time parents",1399593600,,272,4.313725490196078
2259410,5,B0008GPAP6,Sessions are helpful and to the point. I recommend it for new breast feeding mommies. Very basic and straight forward.,1399593600,,118,4.95
2259411,5,B0008GPAP6,I was very set on breastfeeding both of my kids. This dvd was a great help to teach me how to feed my baby. I was a step ahead when baby came and I was able to nurse all the way until they both turned one! :),1394668800,,208,3.4468085106382977
2259412,4,B0008GPAP6,"This video was hilarious!! I don't know if all of it was meant to be funny but I was rolling. That said the information was good and matched with what we were told in a live breastfeeding class at the local hospital. Information is still current, completely accurate, and presented in a fun manner... Plus you don't have to leave your home.

Minus one star for the cost based on how short the video is. I'd rather they lower the price and provide a download version. Still, it's worth getting if you don't want to go to a class.",1390867200,,528,4.333333333333333
2259413,2,B0008GPAP6,After a great experience with the Laugh and Learn childbirth DVD this was highly disappointing.  I didn't learn anything I hadn't already read in a few articles on the top baby websites.  Very short and suprisingly dissapointed.,1390089600,,228,5.135135135135135
2259414,4,B0008GPAP6,I am new to breastfeeding and just had my 1st child. I think this dvd was pretty helpful for a new mom!!,1388620800,,104,3.772727272727273
2259415,1,B0008GPAP6,"Limit baby's time on the breast???  Breastfeeding is supposed to hurt???  Smack the baby's back so you hear it across the room???  The only thing I laughed at was the bad advice, but that is not really funny because people will follow her suggestions and wind up having more problems than this will prevent.  Bad information.  A recipe for disaster.
Go instead to a FREE La Leche League meeting prior to birth and contact a Lactation Consultant that works in the community, not in a hospital, to help you after you go home.",1385769600,,523,4.580645161290323
2259416,4,B0008GPAP6,"I wasn't expecting this to be funny, but I did laugh while watching! Very practical and helpful, but I would have rented this from the library if it was available.",1379548800,,163,4.466666666666667
2259417,5,B0008GPAP6,"As a soon to be mommy, expecting in December, this DVD came in handy. It was informative, with updated information. My husband and I opted for dvd's instead because the hospital recommended taking these courses closer to delivery date so the information is fresh in or minds. However, my husband schedule at work is hectic from september to valentines day and we both work nights and hospital classes were only offered later in the day, usually when we are sleeping trying to get rest for work. I bought this dvd and a few others so that we could watch them together at home. I am glad I did too because the hospital classes are way more expensive for all 3 classes, and we saved a lot of money choosing the dvd's. Well worth it!!!",1377475200,,731,4.462686567164179
2259418,4,B0008GPAP6,"This DVD was not too long but had a lot of information packed into it. It gave me all the basics of what to expect with breastfeeding. As a first time mom expecting next month, I'm really glad I opted to purchase this rather than going to a class. It's nice to be able to watch it more than once and take notes so you don't forget everything as well.",1360540800,,350,4.014285714285714
2259419,1,B0008GPAP6,"If I knew then what I know now...  I failed to review this video in the past, but take it from me, the now experienced nursing mom of a second baby, this video got me off to the wrong start. I ordered this before having my first baby, and after watching this video I thought I knew exactly what to do. So after delivery I told the lactation specialist I didn't need any help (big mistake). This video teaches good positioning, BUT the lady teaches that you feed 15 minutes on one side, burp, switch, & 15 minutes on the second side. Also, that you go 2 to 3 hours in between feedings. Well, that might work for a few, but not for most. Because I followed this advice my milk did not come in as well or as soon as it should have. My baby was hungry & cried a lot. But as a new mom I didn't realize this at first. Take it from me, breastfeeding can be simple, but most babies (& moms) need more than 15 minutes per side, especially in the beginning. Find someone with experience if you need help with things. Don't fool with this video.",1356307200,6,1034,4.118811881188119
2259420,4,B0008GPAP6,"Breastfeeding basics are helpful, but I wish she would have talked a little more about managing breast feeding, like alternating baby holds to ease on soreness or more detail about alternating breasts for feeding and why that is important.  This may not be sufficient for the woman who plans on nursing and returning to work.  Still it was good for easing some of the fears about the process.",1355616000,,392,4.75
2259421,5,B0008GPAP6,I loved the video! It wasn't too long but was full of all the information that a new mom needs...I have been a mom for less than a week now and the breast feeding is now something that I am a pro at thanks to the film.  I have already given it to my family member that is expecting in March!,1352851200,,291,3.7704918032786887
2259422,5,B0008GPAP6,"This turned out to be a great resource for my husband and I. We watched this video before our little one arrived, while we where in the hospital learning to breast feed we had a reference to draw back on. This is highly recommended for any one who plans to breast feed. I also recommend the other videos in this series.",1345334400,,319,4.245901639344262
2259423,2,B0008GPAP6,"The L&L Childbirth video was chock-full of info. This was not. I watched the entire thing in less than 40 minutes!  A very few useful tips, but overall, not worth the time at all. I would recommend you rent it or borrow it, but this was definitely not worth buying.",1334534400,,265,4.3
2259424,5,B0008GPAP6,"I recommend all of her dvds. I didn't step foot inside a classroom for newborn care, breast feeding or Lamaze. This is the way to go.",1316908800,,133,4.153846153846154
2259425,4,B0008GPAP6,This is the kind of dvd i was looking for.  It gives you the basics on breastfeeding and basically everything you need to know.  I feel more confident now that i've watched this dvd.,1313020800,,182,4.323529411764706
2259426,4,B0008GPAP6,"This was a great video for me, a first-time mom in my sixth month of pregnancy. I want all the newborn care info I can find, but I don't have time to read books (I read for a living) and I don't have the attention span for long, dry lectures.

I love the straightforward, relaxed, no-panic approach this instructor takes. She presents very basic information in short lessons, demonstrating with dolls, and then follows each lesson with a short clip of a woman actually breastfeeding a real baby. (Warning: those short nursing clips are actually very sweet and tender and likely to make a pregnant woman teary, so have a tissue handy.) The sections on positions was the most helpful to me. She also covers nursing twins, diet, length of time at the breast, bras, pumping, and pain relief for sore breasts.

There's nothing political or overtly feminist or hippie about this video. It's just an easy way to get straightforward information and build confidence as you prepare for breastfeeding or are still trying to decide if you want to do it. I highly recommend this video and the entire Laugh and Learn series.",1312848000,,1111,4.721649484536083
2259427,5,B0008GPAP6,"This DVD shows everything you need to know about breast feeding and more.  I liked that different topics which were covered, regarding positions, nipple sizes, products that help soreness, etc.  I am a first time mom and have seen many free videos on youtube this DVD was definitely much more helpful and informative.  I did not have any unanswered questions afterwards.",1307491200,,370,5.032786885245901
2259428,5,B0008GPAP6,"This video is exactly what I hoped it would be. It is very thorough and informative. I am going to watch it a couple of times before the baby comes. It's not too long and held my interest by not dragging out steps. It has definitely given me a much better
confidence about my knowledge of breast feeding.",1305504000,,304,4.258620689655173
2259429,4,B0008GPAP6,"I'm pregnant with my first and was thinking about registering for the breastfeeding class at the hospital but thought I might as well check out this video first (it was available at my local library and therefore free!) -- what a great alternative!

*Sheri is knowledgeable and entertaining. My husband enjoyed watching the video and seemed to be taking mental notes for when our baby comes.
*The methods she recommends are presented clearly and matter-of-fact (although it's always a good idea to seek out your local professional help or lactation consultant if you're having problems).
*Filming and presentation was pretty good -- if a little bit staged, but not enough to make it seem really cheesey.

This video is totally worth watching and passing along to new moms. I'm not going to register for the brestfeeding class; I'll just rent the video again if I need a refresher course (and keep the breastfeeding book and La Leche League meeting schedule close at hand).",1294444800,,972,4.957055214723926
2259430,4,B0008GPAP6,"This is a great informational DVD. I must say that I decided in the end not to breastfeed, but I was glad that I learned about it and knew what to expect if I HAD decided to breastfeed.",1291939200,,185,3.8947368421052633
2259431,5,B0008GPAP6,"I thought I knew plenty about breastfeeding after my best friend and cousin had their babies last year, but with Sheri's dvd I learned quite a bit more.  I learned different positions of holding a baby and even though I got a boppy, Sheri suggested not to use it until after you lose a little bit of your belly.  I didn't know that breastfed babies don't burp as much.  I also did not know techniques on how to release a baby from feeding either.  There were all types of tidbits about feeding I was not aware of until I viewed this DVD.  You can read information in books and view websites, but there's something to be said for watching a trained nurse, lactation consultant, and a mother of twins leading a class and  demonstration on the topic.  We still plan on taking the lactation class at the hospital but at least we have some knowledge on the topic beforehand.",1286496000,,869,4.427672955974843
2259432,5,B0008GPAP6,"I was unable to get to the breast feeding classes provided by the hospital so I ordered this DVD.  All in all I thought it was pretty good.  The video was fairly short and very practical.  I appreciated the fact that it wasn't a breast feeding pitch, just down to earth tips on how to hold the baby, how to get started, and how to transition to pumping.  It'll also be nice to have on hand if once I get home I feel lost or frustrated.",1284681600,,435,4.023255813953488
2259433,3,B0008GPAP6,I found that the DVD is presented by a person who probably knows a lot but is uninterested in sharing all the knowledge.,1260489600,,120,4.260869565217392
2259434,5,B0008GPAP6,"This whole series is GREAT! We are having our first baby and the information we received from this set of videos (Breastfeeding, Newborn & Childbirth) & they let you know things to ask your Doctor. Our Doctor was impressed with our questions and we owe it to this video series!!!! We HIGHLY recommend!!!",1239753600,,303,4.735849056603773
2259435,1,B0008GPAP6,"I checked this video out at the library and I'm so glad I didn't spend money on it.  Where are the babies?  She uses dolls, which doesn't give you a good picture of how breastfeeding actually works.  I'm also glad I didn't check this out before I had been successfully breastfeeding for a couple of months, because I disagreed with the advice.  Stop feeding your baby after 10-15 minutes a side?  My baby is a slow eater.  Why would I deprive him of food?  And what's the problem with allowing him some non-nutritive sucking after he's done eating?  Breastfeeding is about more than just calories.  You have to meet their emotional needs too.  The worst part?  I didn't laugh.  Just not funny.",1235606400,7,693,4.590163934426229
2259436,4,B0008GPAP6,I found this video and the others to be very informative and helpful. I would recommend them for anyone without the time to take a class.,1228176000,,137,4.3076923076923075
2259437,4,B0008GPAP6,"I'm a first time mom and have had trouble finding classes in my area, so I purchased all three of the Laugh and Learn DVDs.  I watched the breastfeeding DVD for the first time today, and was very satisfied with it.  I had read reviews that Sheri Bayles is annoying and the film quality is poor, so I was a bit wary.  Luckily I found that I really enjoyed the video, and thought that Sheri portrayed herself very well - I would love to be in an actual class with her!  I didn't think her humor was hilarious, but it didn't seem like she was trying hard to be funny and entertaining either - she came across as genuine and simply being herself while sharing real-life experiences.

The DVD is rather brief, especially considering the price, but I felt that it presented all the information I needed to know.  I realize that most aspects of childcare just require practice and hands-on experience, and after watching this DVD I feel comfortable giving breastfeeding a try.  I felt that the DVD would have been overwhelming (especially for my pregnant mind) if it presented any more information.  As it is, I feel that I need to watch it again and take notes.

I am very satisfied with my purchase and would certainly recommend this DVD to other moms-to-be.  I hope the other two DVDs are equally pleasing.",1212192000,6,1302,4.5256410256410255
2259438,4,B0008GPAP6,"This DVD shows various breastfeeding positions & gives a wealth of useful information.  I would have preferred a little more in-depth information, but it is still well worth the time to watch this (especially if you are first-time parents).  I purchased this & her newborn care DVD & found them both to be useful.",1194998400,2,313,4.777777777777778
2259439,2,B0008GPAP6,"This video was informative enough, but it's brief, and really doesn't have anything I haven't seen on You Tube or other free sources.  I was a little wary about the humor since the title is 'Learn and Laugh About Breastfeeding' after all, but Sheri Bayles is simply not funny, and at points it's painful to watch.  She's clearly working hard to sell her schtick, but the purpose of the video is to get info on breastfeeding, not to allow an outlet for an obviously frustrated comedienne. She knows breastfeeding facts, and she'd do better to just give the information.  Finally, it'd be a better video if they included more footage of real babies feeding, latching, etc., rather than focusing on the baby dolls and Sheri's endless banter from the couch.",1194307200,,753,4.776923076923077
2259440,4,B0008GPAP6,"My wife and I watched this together after watching Laugh and Learn about Childbirth, which was really good. It gives a good baseline knowledge about Breastfeeding, but the lactation counselor at the hospital was awesome!! I would recommend this to new parents, even Dads who want to help out your wives, but don't expect this to be your only source of information and help on the subject. My wife was able to put what she learned in the video right to use after the baby was born. Sheri Bayles keeps the topic interesting in all her videos. Although some of her time lines that she gives in the video seemed a little overwhelming when you see how often you have to feed a newborn and such but it really hasn't been that bad so far.",1194134400,2,731,4.4222222222222225
2259441,2,B0008GPAP6,"I reviewed this DVD in the hope of showing it to young mothers in a mentoring program.  The instructor is obviously an expert and is very knowledgeable on the subject, however, 5 minutes into the video she uses the Lord's name in vain. She is referencing the pain you feel when the baby first latches on. The pain is real, but she says ""Oh my G-d"" to describe it.  She also tells her audience not to drink a 1/5 of vodka if you want to co-sleep with your baby. I believe she was saying this in jest, but her crudeness made this video inappropriate to use with young mothers. It is a shame because I think she knows her subject well.  I wish the editors of this video would have clued her in on the fact that what she said might offend.",1191801600,5,735,4.161971830985915
2259442,3,B0008GPAP6,"i read the review and bought it before I gave birth to my daughter. It is funny and interesting. However, what I learn from it is nothing new--a lot them are commom sense and you don't need to spend money to buy a CD to learn.
It did make me laugh at some point. And that is it. So, it is your call to buy it or not. Unless you are a really dumb parent (sorry about the d-word) you should know most of the knowledge and you will know what I am talking about if you buy it.",1185580800,,472,3.7777777777777777
2259443,5,B0008GPAP6,I am a first time mom and this video is a very helpful resource for me.  It tells anything you would want to know about breastfeeding.  I definitely would recommend any buying if they are interested.,1182816000,5,199,4.5
2259444,5,B0008GPAP6,"If you own the Childbirth DVD with the same instructor, please don't be turned off in buying this one.  She is a LOT less obnoxious and she is more staright to the point, without all the little wanna-be comedy routines.

This DVD was a fantastic, basic demonstration on how to breastfeed.  Each chapter was clear and concise and not too long.  I think I watched the whole thing in under an hour.  The real-life demonstrations of mothers breastfeeding their babies was extremely helpful, as was the chapter on pumping.",1180742400,19,517,4.764044943820225
2259445,4,B0008GPAP6,"Since I'm on bedrest, I couldn't make it to an in-person class. This was a solid substitute. I'm really glad I got it to see the positions for myself and get a few tips. Overall though, it's a pretty short lesson and could have included more. I'd supplement with a book or two to make sure you have enough information on hand.

One other note, I've got a childbirth/lamaze dvd with the same instructor and she is MUCH better in this one. I thought her sense of humor was a little too strong in the other video and the squealy voice got on my nerves. No problem with that here - a definite good thing.",1178496000,10,600,4.217391304347826
2259446,5,B0008GPAP6,I found this dvd very easy to follow and well explained.  It runs at a good pace and has a good sense of humor about it.  I found it enjoyable and have gone back to reference material again.,1168387200,4,190,3.973684210526316
2259447,2,B0008GPAP6,"When you buy this DVD, chances are that you are pregnant ... so: show me how this is done properly! I would have liked more hands-on.

2259448,5,B0008GPAP6,"I was happy and excited by the prospect of breastfeeding my baby, then my girlfriends started telling me one failure story after another.
