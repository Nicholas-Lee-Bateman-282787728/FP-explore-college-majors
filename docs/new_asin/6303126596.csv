7839484,5,6303126596,"The director of this movie Joseph b Vasquez Who also  directed hanging with the homeboys  , manhattan merengue , & street  hitz he unfortunately died years ago, out of the movies he made this is my favorite not because I'm in it but because it tell you how the Bronx was like back then the story was good , but unfortunately he used a few extras with no acting skills I was one of them , the rest of the cast , fabio urea who played his brother Tony is still acting , Andre brown who played ceasar I believe his still acting , he was in the movie the last dragon, but out of all of them the one who has had the most success is Marlene Forte she played the stripper in the movie , she played rose in house of Payne and she appearing in the new Dallas series. There's a lot of action with a few mistake but it's worth watching , I'm the first one to get shot after Tito says you know what this means this means war so be ready..",1360108800,4,926,3.9411764705882355
7839485,4,6303126596,"A GANG OF BLACK DRUG RUNNERS FEUD WITH A GANG OF LATINO DRUG RUNNERS IN THE SOUTH BRONX. THIS MOVIE DEFINITELY SHOULD'VE GOTTEN MUCH MORE ATTENTION WHEN IT WAS RELEASED 13 YEARS AGO. EVERYONE DID A GOOD JOB IN THIS MOVIE, ESPECIALLY THE MAN WHO PLAYED THE LEADER OF THE LATINOS [WHO'S BILLED ONLY AS JOSEPH]. SCREW ''EMPIRE'', YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE! THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED GANGSTA MOVIES EVER MADE.",1070323200,6,419,4.526315789473684
7839486,1,6303126596,"The first one third of the short film is filled with senseless old WWII history, essentially filler to make up for the lack of Grenada footage.  Not worth the purchase.",1015977600,2,168,4.6
