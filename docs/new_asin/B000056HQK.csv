1397631,5,B000056HQK,"The City This film is an eye opener to the struggle and hardships, the sad lives of immigrants who arrive from Latin America simply for a more productive future in a large, cold city of New York. Each snippet begins with those who preserve some connection to themselves by having pictures taken.

Abandonment. The migration to New York in search of work takes a toll on the women and children left in Mexico, waiting for hope and money. Jose treasures the letters from home while he and a crew of men clamor for work and are hired to clean bricks in an old abandoned lot. In turn, they are abandoned by the boss and are left with frustration, anger, infighting and an accident.

Lost. A young man, Francisco arrives and walks the street to search for his uncle on 187th Street. His attention is diverted to a quincinera, a young girl's coming out party. He intrudes, meets a young girl, she takes him home and he sleeps on the couch while they plan breakfast together in the morning.

Homeless. An unhealthy puppeteer, Luis, and his daughter, Dulce, live in an old station wagon because the shelters are full with sick people. Dulce helps with the puppet show and he makes sure she reads her books.

Work Without Pay. A clothing factory run by Orientals is the setting for the last story, where the workers have not been paid for weeks. Ana gets a call from Mexico that her daughter needs medical care and she begs that she be paid to send money home.

This black and white film was filmed in New York between 1992 and 1997 by David Riker who wrote, directed and edited the film. The actors are all immigrants. .....Rizzo",1139097600,,1621,4.51877133105802
1397632,5,B000056HQK,"Four simple stories to touch the heart.

1397633,5,B000056HQK,"This movie is so moving and so provocative that I have yet to see a movie this good since I saw this one in 1998.  Riker uses the techniques of neo-realist Italian cinema to tell 4 poigant stories concerning the lives of Latino immigrants.  Each story focuses on characters of different ages and genders, but they share the same struggle to survive in New York's lower east side.  There are fables, there are tragedies, but more importantly there is an endurance that the old man, the day-laborors, the seamstresses, and the couple put forth in a ghetto they call America.",985737600,9,572,4.7
1397634,5,B000056HQK,"La ciudad is an extraordinary movie to watch. This movie deals with the life of immigrants and the struggles they must go through in order to survive this cruel life. The movies first starts off at a photo studio where the photographer takes photos of immigrants and as the photographer zooms into the person and takes the photo: the life of the one taking a photo begins to arise. The first part deals with the fact that employers make promises they can't keep as far as the pay they offer and the immigrants have to deal with it because some pay is better than no pay. Sometimes even some pay can cause someone something more valuable, their own lives. The second part deals with being lost in a new place, an immigrant that is. Francisco is in search of his uncle and wanders into a party. At the party he is luck to meet someone from the same town as he and who has a generous heart, who offers him a place to stay. The next morning in order to do a good deed, he goes out to buy food. Francisco goes to the store and upon his return he finds himself lost. Everything seems the same from the outside and he becomes scared but there's nothing  he can do now. Then there's the part where a homeless man tries to enroll his daughter in school and couldn't. The school asked for a receipt or a bill as proof of address but since he didn't have any, they little girl cannot be enrolled even if she does live in the city. Finally, the part where a real crises arises and a mother is pushed to the limits for her child. The employers promised and promised a pay, week after week, but never did. Until a mother brakes down and the rest of her fellow co-workers join into her struggle. All these story in one way or another relate to many if not all immigrants and the struggles they are faced with. In addition to the stories something that is symbolic in the movie is that its in black and white. This makes it clear to the viewers that not everything is ""de color de rosa"". In other words not everything in pretty in color. Plus when people imagine New York, they think glamour, lights and wealth; this movie has none of these things. It truly shows the other side of the story, doesn't it?",1145836800,,2188,4.285024154589372
1397635,4,B000056HQK,"This movie shows what illegal immigrants have to deal with in their everyday lives in the United States. Scenes include how they are not getting paid, a kid who can't attend school because her dad didn't have a rent bill or a phone bill (which means that if you aren't the part of the city, and you don't own something, your kids will not be able to get educated), and all of the hardships that they go through. The movie portrays a different image of New York because it was filmed in black and white, compared to image we get from MTV of New York as a city which of full of colors.",1145836800,,583,4.168141592920354
1397636,4,B000056HQK,"La Ciudad was very great movie, specially because of how different it was from any other movie I've watched before. The way in which 3 different stories were put together to show what some immigrants have to go through to support their families. What most impacted me from the movie was the way the showed New York city. In most of the movies in which we see New York, it always appears as a city of big businesses, great economy, and the wealthy in general. But in this film, I got to see the side of New York we don't often see, where the immigrants live and the outside of the city. It really made me realize that there's no such thing as a perfect city or a perfect country. There's poverty and discrimination everywhere, and this movie made me realize that sometimes we get so caught up into our own little world and we complain about every little thing, but sometimes we should stop, look around, and be thankful for what we have.",1145836800,,936,4.385057471264368
1397637,5,B000056HQK,"What I enjoyed most about La Ciudad was their unique approach of narrating short stories through pictures. It is said that a picture is worth 1000 words however, watching this movie has helped me understand that there is a greater story behind each picture it is worth more than words. Each picture does not stand for itself, but it holds a moment in time. To some a picture can represent love, happiness, or life. For example, Ana the women whose daughter was terribly sick and her employers had not paid her four weeks. Yet they told her ""maybe next week"" when she asked for the money for her daughter's operation.  To Ana she had nothing more than a picture, to remember her daughter. The picture was Ana's source of both happiness and life. It was her daughter that Ana worked hard for to support, even if they lived in a different country it was her little angel that kept her determined to  work everyday.

 They showed four short stories of struggles that immigrants face. In each of the stories a reoccurring theme was evolved around children. At times the child in the story was illustrated through a picture, other times they played a more crucial part of their parent's  lives. Dulce who was Luis's daughter was a great help to her father while he tried to make money as best as he could she stayed near him at all times. I think the importance of showing children throughout the movie was to show the audience what happens to immigrants documented or undocumented effects their children severely. As we saw Dulce was not allowed to get education because her father did not have a telephone number or receipt of rent.  That was not an exaggeration, it's common that children of immigrants must stop their education due to undocumentation or to help support the family and must therefore work at a young age.

 I enjoyed the movie for its unique approach and the realism behind each story. Although it was sad, it showed true stories that everyone could learn from.",1145836800,,1975,4.655172413793103
1397638,5,B000056HQK,"La Ciudad is an expressive film which allows people to see what immigrants, especially illegal immigrants, have to go through in order to survive in the United States and the struggles they go through to get there. La Ciudad tells a few different stories of immigrant families. Although these immigrants are so different, they have more similarities than one could imagine. La Ciudad shows the struggles immigrants go through such as working hard and long hours with little or no pay wondering when their checks will come, the struggle to survive, trying to give their children good education, and most of all, the struggles of living apart from their families and loved ones.

 La Ciudad is filmed in a narrative perspective. Each different story starts with a family or individual taking a picture, and with a snap of a picture, a new story begins. Each picture taken captures each individual immigrant, and although different, all seem to have similar situations and share the same struggles and hardships. The pictures that are taken are all families have left to be remembered by their families. La Ciudad is filmed in black and white which helps to show how immigrants' lives are far from colorful. This aspect also shows that their lives are much more dark and depressing than anyone unfamiliar would know. Viewing this movie in black and white also emphasizes the slums of New York which is barely seen or recognized. La Ciudad also focuses on children a lot. This is possibly to emphasize that immigration affects every person in a family, regardless of age. Overall La Ciudad shows that immigrants tend to live their lives looking through glass windows; the opportunities are there, but for immigrants they seem impossible to reach. La Ciudad is an excellent movie which allows people to see the struggles which immigrants, illegal and legal, go through upon immigrating.",1145836800,,1881,5.006389776357827
1397639,5,B000056HQK,"La Ciudad is an exceptional piece of work. The movie portrays the point of view and the stories of Latino immigrants in the city of New York. The movie shows their hardships and experiences in America to try and get a chance to live a good life in the ""land of opportunities."" Whether the hardships may be hazardous jobs which could result in death and with such miserable pay. The right to an education being violated because one does not have proof of a reciept from rent or a telephone bill. Long hours in labor with no pay for a long time, cutting off family needs for medicine or better health. Or just not knowing the city and stepping outside to buy food result in the immigrant getting lost in the big city due to the strange and unfamiliar environment where every building looks the same.

It is shown in black and white to give more of an effect and some symbolism which may need a second viewing to catch. But overall, it is a wonderful movie. It allowed me see through the windows of reality to see the actual picture of the whole ordeal. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.",1145836800,2,1093,4.410891089108911
1397640,3,B000056HQK,"La Cuidad was a good movie that helps show what some immigrants have to indure. The movie takes place in an urban setting in New York. It gives four sepaerate tales of four Latin immigrants with all of them having a connection because they all eventually visit the same photgrapher. The movie is pictured in black and white which adds to the effect it has on the viewers. The tales work to show the mistreatment of immigrants here in America. In the movie, immigrants were being cheated out of their pay, children were refused by schools and more. The movie is well constructed and gives a real view of how hard being an immigrant can be. In one section, the film portrays dozens of male immigrants on a New York corner ready to work for anyone who came. I do reccommend this film especially to those who are interested or working with the subject of immigrants.",1145750400,,862,4.532051282051282
1397641,5,B000056HQK,"La ciudad is a movie which portrays the lives of immigrants in New York City. The movie starts with people taking their pictures at a photo shop, showing them at that moment and then when the camera clicks it zooms in to their lives. The first was a man that got a job for the day after getting picked up by a man that promised him and others 50 dollars for the day but when they got to the job site they were actually gonna get paid less and they had no choice but to take it because they needed the money. But it cost Jose more than he thought. The second is a man, Francisco, that arrives to New York and being lost wanders into a party. At the party, he is wowed by a girl named Maria and later finds out that she is from the same town where he is from. Later, Francisco finds himself lost in a city where everything looks the same to him. The next is of a man and his daughter who are homeless and live in their car. When the man tries to enroll his daughter in school they do not allow him because he does not have a rent or telephone receipt. The last is the story of a woman that works in a sweatshop that has not payed her for four weeks. After a call from her mother, she finds out that her 6 year old daughter is sick; and she must send money in order to pay for the hospital. The movie is beautifully directed because as a viewer you feel as if you are the character and you feel their pain. The movie is in Black and white which helps set the mood of the movie as somber; and it shows how not everything is in color, it shows the other side of the city which we never get to see.",1145750400,,1592,3.931888544891641
1397642,3,B000056HQK,"La Ciudad is a movie that is put together with several different stories that all relate to the mistreatment of latinos. The stories are linked together when one takes a photograph. In the movie the black and white sets the mood. If it was in color the movie would not give the audiance the full affect of how oppressed these latinos were. I also noticed in the movie that everytime that a latino would fall into a problem that the latinos would come together and help eachother out. Examples of this are when the wall fell on the man and then all of the other works stopped working and went to help get hom out of the rubble. Also when the one women needed money so she can pay the bills for her sick daughter many women that she worked with gave her money to help. This shows how these immigrant workers help eachother out. I also thought it was interesting that the movie took place in New York. Everytime I used to think of New York, I would think of New York City and Times Square. This movie really made me open my eyes to what also goes on in the outskirts of New York City other then big buildings. Overal I thought the movie was put together really well and I liked it.",1145750400,,1178,4.24
1397643,5,B000056HQK,"La Ciudad, directed by David Riker, comments on the presence of illegal immigrants in urban settings through a series of stories.  Each story begins with the protagonists getting their pictures taken in a photo shop.  Quickly we learn everything is not as it seems on the surface.  As they stand before idyllic backdrops, wearing their best clothes and a smile, their realities come to life with the click of the camera.  Jos, the first protagonist in the series of stories, is lucky enough to get a job for the day, but at what cost?  Lost and stranded on the work site and in their lives, the workers carry on, even with the knowledge that their lives are as worthless and ill-fated as Jos's.  Francisco thinks he has found his American dream in Maria, a young girl who shares with him a past and a longing for home.  Maria has felt trapped in America, while Francisco has been lost until he found Maria.  After a small mishap, Francisco loses his delicate sense of home, getting lost in the proverbial city once again, trapped by harsh realities.  Dulce cannot attend school, because she is without a home.  As illegal immigrants, they are not citizens, and as homeless people, they are not residents.  ""Every child has the right,"" according to the official story of the nation-state, while in reality the law acts as an obstacle to that statement.  Upon hearing of her young daughter's illness, Ana is faced with a double-bind: she can either continue to work for no pay in the hopes of eventually getting paid, or demand her pay and risk getting fired.  Like the other protagonists, she is desperate and stuck, and even when others protest on her behalf, the reality that they are all replaceable complicates a moment that could have been a moment of strength through unity.  In the end, they are forever outsiders looking in, lost among the fringes of society.",1145750400,,1866,4.719135802469136

7932043,5,B000056HQK,"Four short films that tell the story of new Latin American immigrants struggling to ""make it"" in New York City.  The first story is about day laborers begging for work on street and eventually finding it - and learning that they were tricked in the deal.  The second is about a young man coming from Mexico, wondering why he left everything he had behind, and eventually falling in love with a girl from his same home town.  The third is a seamstress working in a sweatshop desperate to send money home to care for her sick daughter.  And finally, the last is a homeless puppeteer who lives with his young daughter who tries to get his daughter into school without any papers.

The actors were not professionals but were perfectly casted - real and authentic.  The black and white cinematography and imagery was spellbinding - capturing the facial expressions, the anxieties, the emotions, the heartbreak, the sweat on the brow, and all of the frustrations.

This film is solemn and somber throughout but tugged at everything human in me.",1212192000,,1038,4.76536312849162
7932044,5,B000056HQK,"Honestly, I only took on an interest in The City (La Ciudad) on a whim when I saw that it had gotten plenty of good reviews, had been critically acclaimed by people such as Roger Ebert, but certainly low-budget. I had recently become a big fan of vignette style films and was willing to take a look at anything. But my hopes were somewhat strange when I saw it had been made in 1998 wondering if it might be a bit timely if not outdated. As it turns out, the film is just as relevant today as it was in between the years 1992 and 1997 when principal photography took place. There is just nothing to say that can justify this beautiful piece of art told through the black and white filter that takes over four people's dismal but emotionally charged lives.

THE CITY follows five principal characters: Jose, a young but hard working man who wishes he was home with his wife and son through the letters they always send him; Francisco, a young man who stumbles into a quinceera just after arriving from Mexico but meets Maria, a girl at the party who has felt trapped ever since her own arrival five years previous; Luis, a single father and street puppeteer who wants the best for his daughter despite living out of his car with her; and Ana, a young seamstress worker who must find a way to send $400 home to her daughter who desperately needs medical attention. The four will soon discover through their stress-filled and taxxing days that life in the city may make them or break them...but their lifelong problems will never end.

Usually a film will leave you with some sort of redemption even with a sad ending. THE CITY, however, displays the harsh truths for these poor immigrants and the emotional odysseys they must endure every day. You long for Jose, Francisco, Maria, Luis, and Ana, our loving protagonists, to find their hope. Some of them nearly do but it falls out of their grasp. The message is ultimately, their problems will never end and the ending to their stories is almost irrelevant in that it's just one part of their entire lives. It's a big fat slap in the face to an audience who is not used to this but for a lot of people it's a reality.

The amazing cast, which was made up of mostly first-timers including actual immigrants, completely blew me away. The five leads told so much with their eyes and facial expressions that you can sense desperation and blank feelings of not having a sense of comfort. Personally, it became connecting with the actual person instead of the characters they were playing due to the fact they were almost playing themselves. The long absences of words filled with atmospheric music will send a chill up your spine. Fernando Reyes as Jose brought out hopelessness but a light of hope. He's the one who spends the least amount of time in front of the camera but when you do see him, dread and sorrow immediately follow through reading the letters his wife sends him.

Silvia Goiz as Ana was my other particular favorite. Goiz was absolutely mind-blowing. Her desperation for her character trying to get enough money for her daughter's operation were incredible. The emotion she invoked on the screen was also impeccable. Her face fills the screen with hope much more than the others as her womanly stubborness dominates the screen. Her difference from Jose, Francisco, Maria and Luis is that we know, as the audience, she's the one who won't give up. Cipriano Garcia as Francisco also portrayed a feeling of innocence in coming straight from Mexico to New York and getting lost but finding a sense of comfort in a girl from the same town. The dread that envelopes his face in a twist-of-fate ending is a mistake that runs the story full circle in a simple way.

David Riker, who toiled years to put the full-length film together in starting it as a student film, has made a film that should not and will not be forgotten. It is a film that once you see it, it will stick with you. I saw it four months ago and it's all I've been able to think about for the longest time. It is not a waste of time and much different than anything you will ever see or have seen before. Give it a chance. It's not just an art film, it's much more than that. It's our world and a sign of our times. You might get something out of it and I personally never say that about any film. You may even relate.",1206489600,4,4339,4.480404551201011
7932045,5,B000056HQK,"LA CIUDAD (The City) is a beautiful film shot entirely in gritty black and white and focuses on the lives and experiences of four groups of Latino immigrants, newly arrived in New York City.  The story (with dialogue entirely in Spanish) has been compared to THE GRAPES OF WRATH and it is evident why.  Through the eyes of the many struggling and hardworking people we come to know during the four short stories, we see the stark reality of the immigrant experience in the United States.  While WRATH gave us a glimpse into the heartwrenching traumas faced by those who came on covered wagons during the Dustbowl to seek work in the fields.  The stories broke my heart, ten years ago, and breaks it all over again when I think about the subject matter in this film.  The first story tells the grim the tale of a group of brick layers on call for a job, the second is about a young Mexican boy who comes to the big city of New York, the third is about a homeless man and his daughter and the fourth depicts the plight of a woman toiling in the sweat shops, day in and day out.

7932046,5,B000056HQK,"I found La Ciudad a very different movie from any other movies I have wathched. This movie is split into four narratives of Latino immigrants living in the city of New York. Immigrants come to the US with many dreams in their minds. These dreams include getting higher education or getting thier childeren higher education, getting rich, and living a happy and high standard life. This movie shows how these dreams of immigrants are turned down and broken because of the exploitations at thier workplace and the laws of the city and the government. This movie also shows how the immigrant children are affected from these laws and exploitations. For example, Luis's daughter Dulce cannot get addmission to school, and Ana cannot do anything to treat her ill daugheter who is not with Ana. I like it how the movie is shown in black and white; it really matches with the narratives that are shown in the movie. It also indicates that although immigrants hope to have happy and colorful lives in the US, they are not able to have them because of the laws and exploitations. Overall, I really liked the movie and I would encourage anyone to see it.",1146009600,,1144,4.696517412935323
7932047,4,B000056HQK,"I would not recommend this movie to anyone who is close minded and not willing to see America in an alternate view.  La Ciudad depicts the lives of four illegal immigrant workers in the city in the 1990's.  This movie shows some harsh and very realistic footage of what life is like for these undocumented people in America.  To me, Anthony Rivera's intentions were for educational purposes for the rest of the United States that does not really know what type of life illegals live here.

Although these stories are fictional, they seem more real than anything I have ever watched before.  Each character comes vividly to life through the four intertwining stories.  The message sent in this movie is continually seen, and as for myself, after viewing La Ciudad, I see society in a different light.  This movie has made me more aware of other aspects of the American life.",1146009600,,873,4.741721854304636
7932048,5,B000056HQK,"La Ciudad is a significant documentary that provides full detail on illegal immigrants, more specifically Mexican immigrants, whom come to the United States.  The structure of the film as well as the narrative was well organized.  Each new story began a snap of a picture.  The picture and/or camera can be analyzed as a way of communication between immigrants in the United States and their family back in Mexico.  It is a way to keep in touch with their loved ones when they are far away.  Another observation on the documentary is the repetition of windows.  In the case of Luis, he takes his daughter to school and sees the classroom being conducted through a window. In order to enroll his daughter, Luis is to provide proof that he lives in the city.  However, he does not have legal proof, a rent receipt or a phone bill, and is denied the enrollment of his child.  In the film, immigrants would always look inside windows.  The windows can be seen as the United States and how legal and illegal immigrants see the United States as a whole.  However, it is the opposite of what immigrants might have expected the country to be.  Immigrants might have expected a better life and/or working conditions once they immigrated to the country.  They are struggling to obtain a decent job and are not allowed to receive public benefits such as an education as seen in the case of Luis.  The film's scenery is in black and white which gives the viewer an impact on the stories that have been presented.  It lets the viewer see that not everything in this country has color.",1145923200,2,1571,4.60431654676259
7932049,5,B000056HQK,"""La Ciudad"" portrays the detrimental and unfortunate conditions immigrants from Mexico and Latin America experience upon their arrival to the United States.  The film's symbolism emerges from the binary, black and white contrast and the recurrent appearance of photographs of several immigrants.  The film is structured on four individual cases which speak for and represent the faces of thousand of immigrants and the miserable life they succumb to as they realize earning a decent life in America is solely a bewildering idea. ""La Ciudad"" recounts and depicts the predicaments immigrants encounter: linguistic barriers, unemployment, and social discrimination through the denial of educational and proper health services, exploitation, and living life in the U.S. by chance, isolation, and misery. For instance, in two cases presented in the film, little money, high hopes, and luck is invested in lottery tickets, yet Jose (an immigrant laborer) dies as his work mates quarrel over their indigent lives as a consequence of exploitation, intermittent unemployment, and cheap commission. On the other hand, Dulce and her father are homeless and survive in the U.S. by putting up puppet shows and earning tips.

While the actual setting of ""La Ciudad"" is not specified, the setting is not mentioned to emphasize the situation for immigrants is continuous and periodic through space. ""The City"" the immigrants reside in, coupled with the binary hue through which the film was documented, takes the viewer back to the American Industrial Revolution, when workers and laborers lived in slums and nonetheless, continues to be the home of minorities and Latin American immigrants.  Once the film concludes, it is revealed the film was documented in the urban parts of New York City.

The format in which ""La Ciudad"" was filmed is poignant but realistic. The imagery illustrates the wretched lives immigrants experience on a daily basis, from numbing their hopelessness through illicit substance addictions, to child labor in the menacing streets of urban ghettos. Moreover, the role of the photographs in the film serve three functions: to reminisce the final day immigrants spent in their native countries as a memory keepsake or the photographs they want to send home as a form of showing their ""progress,"" and to convey the irony of living in America as people who observe these pictures cannot sense the truth, and the silent, penurious life, immigrants live.  In addition, the photographs are pivotal as they are tools of struggle to end skepticism across the borders in reference to the actual lives of immigrants in the United States.

Overall, the photographs in the film aim to break preconceived notions and stigmas against immigrants when they are charged for ""stealing"" American jobs as well as dismantling misleading ideas that money in the United States is easy to obtain as is a job.",1145923200,,2893,5.262472885032538

Despite their happiness portrayed in the picture that each one of them takes in the photo studio they all go to, the happiness depicted is actually just the image they want their family members to see, and themselves want to achieve.
