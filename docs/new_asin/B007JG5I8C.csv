8518334,4,B007JG5I8C,"I have seen both this British take on the brooding Swede detective and the Swedish version. I like both. Branagh brings his Shakespearean stage experience to the role and that, along with good script makes this worth rewatching which I did. My only complaint, and I have this complaint with many Brit dramas, is overdone acting of the other characters; in particular the daughter, Linda. Her bitchiness and whining as the daughter gets old and by season 3, I could hardly watch those scenes. The books may have characterized the daughter as neurotic, but the Swedish version did a better job in scripting and acting the role. But I have this neurotic overly dramatic characters as an ongoing complaint in many brutish Diana's, so perhaps it's not this particular o e but mist if them that drive me crazy. I had one other complaint - rwpeating qction scenes such as Wallander atabsing in front of a car coming at him, then jumping aside. They ahould have been a but more creative with actions. That  psaud, is loved this series (and the Swedish version) and only wish America made better written and acted dramas.",1496188800,,1112,4.761658031088083
