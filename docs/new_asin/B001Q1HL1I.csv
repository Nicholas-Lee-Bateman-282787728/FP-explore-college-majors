8334921,5,B001Q1HL1I,"Our family came across this unique little tv show on the ON DEMAND feature of our cable.  Our kids were 6 & 7 years at the time. They loved the show & we watched every episode repeatedly. Then we found this dvd & have watched it ad nauseum too. That's how much the kids love it! It is funny, smart, educational, creative and positive. This is the only dvd of it we have found but if we find anymore we will buy them asap. It's about a man Taylor who has these creatures/friends that live in his attic. Theres a pig, a bug a sumo wrestler for some reason, one is a even a dustball named Dusty.  The show is very clever & funny the characters are puppets that learn lessons & sing songs but it's cute and so unique & funny that it IS great entertainment! We chose it initially because we were sick of all the media garbage out there like the Disney crap that teached kids to be sassy and that adults are idiots, and to buy the stars latest CD etc. etc. The songs they sing are quite well written and the characters learn to all get along. Its a great show. I would say kids 0 - 8 would enjoy this and parents & grandparents too.",1300838400,2,1126,4.090497737556561
