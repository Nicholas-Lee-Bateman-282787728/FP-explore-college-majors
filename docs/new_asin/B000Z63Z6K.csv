8234761,5,B000Z63Z6K,GREAT! I love the Tommy Steele Collection the movie's remind me of when I was younger and I have wanted these movie's for a long time. Now I have them and I am so happy to have them. I love the music especially the 'THE LITTLE WHITE BULL' 'Watch the Birdie' just to name a couple. Tommy Steele is funny and if you grew up in the 60's like me you just love the music the whole feel of the movies is unlike what we have today they are good wholesome fun. I recommend this box set to anyone who loves the error and enjoyed these movies when they were younger.,1292716800,,556,4.018018018018018
8234762,1,B000Z63Z6K,"I got portions of The Tommy Steele Story (or Rock Around The World it's other name)about 30 years ago from tv and STILL waiting to get the full movie on cd.(when I first got the portions it was on F'n Beta!)Transfered to vhs then to dvd but total it's only a little of the whole movie (the singing parts)And one final thing about this movie (that always made me laugh)This is a movie about a Rock Star (named Tommy Steele) and they get the actual Tommy Steele to play out basicly his own biography. It seems they would have changed the star's name in the movie.(but on the other hand) How many other movies do they hire the star to hypathiticly play himself,play out his rise to fame,and don't come right out and say it(like if Buddy Holly played The Buddy Holly Story or Johnny Cash to do Walk The Line etc...)It's like he's NOT playing his own story but like a actor playing Tommy Steele. I can't think of any movie that has done this.(and it would for sure be a flop in today's movies if they did)Plus they would straight out call it a bio movie called The Tommy Steele Story STARING Tommy Steele.(but it is kinda hard to do a bio pic filmed only a couple years as a star (when he did go on to do do 3 more movies/t.v. and I do have all his audio recordings that he did for MANY years after this movie)Well I hope that helped (CONFUSUSED you even more about this little known British star)",1256342400,,1392,4.256603773584906
