3953145,5,B002MYW5SW,"the first time i did this video was without weights, just to see how the workout was gonna go. and i thought it was tough. the next time i added 5lb weight..... WHOA! the burn cranked up! i feel tht in 45 min i got a wonderful, challenging workout. im 17, and adv beg-intermideate level fitness, 134 lb, and 5'3''. bu like the title says, you do alot of squats in fact there is one section in there where you do plie squats for like a min straight with weighted arm movements. lots of reverse lunges too. guess im gonna get really toned legs!",1309219200,8,542,4.221153846153846
3953146,5,B002MYW5SW,I did this workout and loved it !!!  She works every body part.  You get a lot of bang for your buck with this 45 minute workout. It's a head to toe routine.  I consider myself fairly fit and this really challenged me.  Love love love it!!!  It's definitely time well spent.  You'll truly feel that you accomplished something when you complete the workout.  I've bought a lot of home workout videos and CDs over the years and this is one of my favorite.,1281916800,7,453,4.321428571428571
3953147,4,B002MYW5SW,"This is a brilliant workout that works your whole body and is very easy to follow. It is mostly a weights/resistance workout, with some knee raises and roundhouse kicks to add some cardio. It goes for 45 minutes and you just need a set of hand weights, maybe two if you want to follow her suggestion of starting light and moving to heavier ones later. My body feels fantastic after doing this dvd. My star rating has everything to do with the workout itself and nothing to do with the trainer, I'm afraid Jeanette Jenkins does little to add to the joy. She makes annoying jokes that are not even funny the first time and she and her team don't actually do the whole workout in one go, so I don't feel like they're really there with me when the going gets tough. If you are able to block out her voice and concentrate on your own movements you will enjoy it, otherwise you could turn the volume off once you're used to the exercises.",1274572800,4,932,4.331428571428572
3953148,5,B002MYW5SW,Great workout!,1432166400,,14,6.5
3953149,5,B002MYW5SW,"This is a good workout that is easy to follow and fun to do.  She has such a great demeanor about her, and I appreciate that the moves are clearly directed and easy to follow while still getting a great workout.",1430179200,2,211,4.146341463414634
3953150,5,B002MYW5SW,"Length was good for a busy working mom, 45 minutes. Mostly strength and sculpting moves, but with the bits of cardio and sequencing, my heart rate stayed up. Moves were challenging enough without being too much, you know the dread factor. I also was not bothered by Jeanette's quirky/giggly comments. It felt more like working out with a friend.",1423612800,3,345,4.864406779661017
3953151,5,B002MYW5SW,It get's the job done!! Thank you Jeanette!,1421280000,2,43,4.5
3953152,5,B002MYW5SW,"This DVD kicks my butt! I do agree about it being for intermediate to advanced with this said however stick with it and you will see results, not only that but I work up a great sweat and feel accomplished after her workout with this dvd...I struggle with depression and this just is a great boost for my energy levels and for some reason her smile is infectious...A plus workout, I highly recommend....",1411084800,10,403,4.534246575342466
3953153,5,B002MYW5SW,"I love Jeanette's workouts so even if the package was late, torn up,,, I would still be thrilled. BUT the DVD arrived on time, and its a great workout DVD.  No problems whatsoever.",1410220800,,180,4.454545454545454
3953154,5,B002MYW5SW,"I love Jeanette Jenkins workout videos, and I have purchased several of them before......I enjoy my videos and you will not regret this purchase.",1407369600,,145,5.083333333333333
3953155,4,B002MYW5SW,"Love this work out. Love the way Jeanette combines both the cardio with the sculpt moves. She especially  focus on the arms, which is a part of my body that I love to work out. Hoping to get those Michelle Obama arms. I also have her kick-boxing workout wich is just as great as this. Her workout partners in the DVD are just as fun, and helps to keep you motivated.",1373846400,,366,4.154929577464789
3953156,5,B002MYW5SW,"Great workout! Jeanette is the best and she really works you so get ready to sweat, but it is well worth it.",1348876800,,108,3.9545454545454546
3953157,5,B002MYW5SW,"Received much earlier than expected!!! Would order again. The dvd is great, but im a beginner so took time  to get use to it. More for intermediate to advanced but its a good thing you can pause,stop or rewind. I do enjoy the workout but im a little overweight and she does ALOT of squats and my knees were bad but since i stuck with it my knees are getting stronger. If you stick with it you will feel more energized and will start to see results!!!",1346716800,6,450,4.172413793103448
8374305,4,B002MYW5SW,Good workout.,1525219200,,13,6.0
8374306,4,B002MYW5SW,"Good workout.  Jeanette's commentary is a bit awkward in this version,  she is a good trainer and it's a good workout.",1521936000,,118,4.571428571428571
8374307,5,B002MYW5SW,"This workout is very similar to her Cross Training and 21-Day Workout, with a few new moves thrown in. I like workouts that incorporate weights and this one does as well. I would say this workout is for Immediate/Advanced people. If you are a beginner, you should take it much slower and take water brakes.

Although this video was created in 2003, it does not look dated or feel dated (except for the cheesy music).

HINT: You may want to use a very soft cloth or t-shirt to wipe the DVD before inserting into DVD player. I did not do this and the DVD skipped and gave me the message ""Skipping over damaged areas."" I took it out, cleaned it, then put back in and it was fine. But, I have to do with ever use.",1506556800,,709,4.205882352941177
8374308,5,B002MYW5SW,"This workout is fantastic! Prepare to sweat! Its fun also, I honestly am always surprised thats its been 45 minutes when its over. I ordered 3 more Jeanette workouts!",1503532800,,166,4.758620689655173
8374309,5,B002MYW5SW,"Tried it out first time yesterday...great combination of arms with weights and legs, little bit of abs. Got sweaty without wanting to die. Sore today, I expect to get the results I'm looking for.",1502064000,,195,4.764705882352941
8374310,3,B002MYW5SW,"Jeanette Jenkins is a fun, motivating trainer.  The workout is good, my shoulders hurt the next day.  I just wish there were more high impact cardio moves to burn a lot more calories.  This workout focuses more on sculpting the different body parts which is perfect is that is your main goal.  I prefer HIIT strength training cardio that make me breathless and torch major calories.  I'm 4'11 and weigh 104 lbs.  My Fitbit recorded 171 calories burned during the 45 minute workout.  I usually burn around 220 - 250 when doing 45 minute HIIT exercises.",1483920000,3,551,4.677083333333333
8374311,5,B002MYW5SW,This is one of my favorite DVDS to do. The quality of the video to me is fine. I did read the other reviews and someone said there was sirens in the background and either I'm so in my zone I don't notice but I don't know what she was speaking off. Jeanette brings her usual personality and her high reps. The transitions are very fluid as well. But you definitely get a great workout. You can not beat the price.,1481068800,4,412,4.098765432098766
8374312,4,B002MYW5SW,Good strong workout.  I enjoy the variety of moves and the ability to perform them without needing a large space in my co-op.  There is something about the simplicity of the routine combined with the repetitions that not only encourages but gives you a good sweaty workout.  Jeanette has a bubbly personality and keeps lively conversation throughout the session.,1473379200,3,362,5.101694915254237
8374313,4,B002MYW5SW,No  problems. It arrived on time. The DVD works well. It is an older execise DVD but is effective. I do agree the music is not very motivating but I just turn up my music. Jeannette Jenkins had some goofy moments but it does not take away from the exercises.,1456963200,2,258,4.16
8374314,5,B002MYW5SW,Great workouts Jeanette is the best ! Very motivating,1432512000,,53,5.0
