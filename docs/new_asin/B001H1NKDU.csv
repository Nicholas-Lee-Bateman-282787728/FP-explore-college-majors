8518602,5,B001H1NKDU,"in the 70's I have seen a movie about the struggle from Germany with their past in WWII. The movie from Fassbinder is hard to find in Europe. The theme of that movie Germany in autumn is to be compared with the recent movie the Reader with Kate Winslett & Liam Neesom. Fassbinders movie is a documentary style feature which brings you back to the intern struggle from the german inhabitants in the midst of the 70's. It brings the bloody past and the internal debate about the ideology from the RAF back alive.
Thanks to the webshop from Amazon I finally found my copy from that movie.",1252800000,,585,4.425925925925926
