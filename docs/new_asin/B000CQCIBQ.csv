2468982,1,B000CQCIBQ,"This dvd was a huge let down.  It also took several weeks to get it from the Monks web site.  If you know a little about training a dog, then do not get this video.  It is made for the person who knows nothing about dogs at all.  However, if you are having problems sleeping at night, I highly recommend this video.

2468983,5,B000CQCIBQ,"My husband and I have enjoyed the Monks of New Skete's book ""The Art of Raising a Puppy"".  I purchased this set, because I have 3 little children and not a lot of time to read through the whole book.  Also, I did not grow up around a dog and I wanted to see how they trained dogs.  So, these videos are very helpful to me.  The monks talk about dogs and who they are and how to care for them and love them well.  If you enjoyed ""The Art of Raising a Puppy,"" I highly recommend this set.  It is worth watching.  I'm sure you will enjoy it!",1236470400,7,538,3.8807339449541285

I understand that the monks of New Skete do not receive any revenue from this DVD, which I think is a shame, but I still recommend it as a supplement to their books.",1198972800,40,369,4.138888888888889

The dog training part is set up in easy chapters that you can replay and focus on, if necessary.

It is a nice production with peaceful and beautiful landscapes and relaxing music that make it a really gentle and peaceful DVD to watch with any dog lover, as it really emphasizes the companionship that is the very essence of all that we love of dogs.",1180742400,89,574,4.519230769230769

2468997,5,B000CQCIBQ,"This is actually a fun video to learn dog training with. I have trained with world class kennels and I believe the Monks of New Skete have a program that can benefit any dog trainer, novice or pro. They are clear, concise, and even a bit entertaining.

2469005,3,B000CQCIBQ,"Cute video, but not worth paying for. Rent it from the library if you can since you will probably only watch this video once. It's more of a documentary of the Monks of New Skete, but unfortunately it jumps around a lot (puppies are 1 week, then they are 3 months, then back to when they are 1 week...etc.). Editing could be better in that sense. Also, there are two DVDs, but the second one re-uses a ton of footage from the first DVD so it gets sort of redundant. Not a lot of training tips as hoped, so we will just read the books instead. Also, the first DVD is a whole bunch of the Monk's ""philosophy"" which will make you sort of sleepy when watching it...good relaxing video to watch before bed I guess, but not worth paying for.",1410825600,,735,4.219858156028369
2469006,5,B000CQCIBQ,"This is a wonderful companion DVD to any and all of the books written by The Monks of New Skete. If you're reading the reviews then you already know who they are, their story, and what they have accomplished. The DVDs offer a vivid glimpse into the men, their dogs, their dog-raising ethic, their training methods, and the monastery ... bringing your reading and appreciation full circle.

This is so much more than any other dog training DVD out there. So much more.

That said, the Monks make nothing off of the sale of the DVDs, having ended up in a tangle with the producer. The latter chap continues to sell the DVDs and there is just something wrong - dare I say parasitic - about that. So, buy this DVD set in used condition if it is at all possible, and send the dollars you've saved to the monastery as a charitable gift!",1410480000,8,830,4.383116883116883

We already used some of the monks' techniques, and we have gotten many more ideas from the video. The monks' knowledge is absolutely sound and correct. I have always liked Cesar Millan, but after seeing this video, I feel that the Monks of New Skete have more and better methods, especially for German Shepherd owners. If you are thinking of buying a German Shepherd puppy, watch this video first, and you will be a better owner and trainer.",1375056000,6,616,4.508928571428571

2469021,5,B000CQCIBQ,"This compilation is excellent, I think there have been some minor changes - but our old copy dies some time ago and here we are with a pup again (never hurts to refresh). We have raised and trained several dogs by the Monks of New Skete philosophy and I think it's a must have.
Lessons on training are very good, the teachings of the dogs point of view and how we can communicate and share life with dogs is the best.  Presented in thoughtful and compassionate ways, with visual guidance, this is a solid foundation for anyone wanting to or already blessed by a dog.",1362355200,,566,4.390476190476191
2469022,5,B000CQCIBQ,"I read The Art of Training your Puppy a good 15 yeaars ago when I got my first dog and was having difficulty meeting his needs and becoming increasingly frustrated, both with him, the messes and myself. Then I found decades of experience in the books very casually written by the Monks. Having spent decades breeding and raising German Shepard puppies, their reason and experience was a guide with raising my new puppy. Dog training is not inate knowledge and the etiquette and expectations of your life and household must be taught to your new dog. After several weeks of work, I had a well behaved dog to share life with and the stress of coming home to creatively engineered messes diminished with training, making both me and Indy happy for his lifetime.",1359417600,4,758,4.706766917293233
2469023,1,B000CQCIBQ,"The monks have incredible insight into how to train your dog. Nothing about this review should discourage the reader from purchasing their other works. This review is about the circumstances of how the video was produced, not the quality of its content.

According to this Amazon listing, the video supposedly sold over 1mm copies. Allegedly, the producer (Atmosphere Entertainment) claimed that the DVD was ""not profitable"" and so refused to pay the monks for their work. Search for ""Atmosphere Entertainment New Skete lawsuit"" on Google and you'll see the controversy. The monks apparently sued Atmosphere Entertainment though the only case I was able to find seems like that their case might have rejected because the damages were too high for the court's jurisdiction (I am not a lawyer). It's also worth noting that the monks themselves do not sell the DVD on their website, which seems to further support this. If this is true, I think it's unethical to buy this DVD since it would exploit quality, loving folks.

All that said, the monk's books on training and raising dogs (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-to-Be-Your-Dog-s-Best-Friend-The-Classic-Training-Manual-for-Dog-Owners-Revised-Updated-Edition/dp/0316610003/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend: The Classic Training Manual for Dog Owners (Revised & Updated Edition)</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Art-of-Raising-a-Puppy-Revised-Edition/dp/0316083275/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Art of Raising a Puppy (Revised Edition)</a>"") are absolutely excellent and well worth reading. My uncle adopted a German Shepherd from the monks many years ago and I still consider the pair to have the strongest bond between man and dog I have ever seen. I have recently adopted a pitbull from the shelter and we are training her primarily with the monk's philosophy and methodologies.",1357171200,64,1953,6.176470588235294
2469024,4,B000CQCIBQ,"This package contains 2 DVD's, the first one covers the monks philosophy on raising dogs from whelping, birthing, puppyhood and into adulthood. The second video has about 20 minutes of actual dog training in it. For the most part it is a good instructional video but I would have liked to have seen more dog training and less philosophy. They only cover the very basics in the training portion, for this price I expected more.",1353801600,,426,4.693333333333333
2469025,5,B000CQCIBQ,"I love this DVD (already have it as a VHS so I know what it is like). I am giving this as a gift to my niece. This is a very relaxing DVD filled with a lot of data on how to raise and care for your puppy with out any harsh training. After watching and repeating the training exercises your puppy should be housebroke, walk on a leash by your side and so on. There is also a book by them that covers the exact thing so if you can't afford the DVD or don't want it I would strongly encourage you to purchase the book for training purposes if your puppy needs to learn manners. The thing I like about the DVD is it puts you in a relaxed mood before heading into the training; which is very good if you have a cute little monster on your hands. When I am short of time or want a just want a refresher I always turn to the book. I was very impressed how the dogs stayed in there place so you could eat and talk in peace. You can't beat a well manner puppy. I hope you try this out. I don't think you would be disappointed. I would mention another plus and that is if you contact them and set up an appointment to go to Cambridge, New York where they live and you can get help in training your baby plus you get to see all the beautiful scenery there in a very peaceful atmosphere. You should come away very relaxed and with a much happier well behaved puppy. Cambridge is near Albany and Vermont very beautiful area. These are 2 books by them that I have: The Art of Raising a Puppy and How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend: The Classic Training Manual for Dog Owners.

The photography, music, and scenery make this DVD a pleasure to watch.  It was informative as well as entertaining.  My only complaint is that some of the same clips are repeated on both DVD's; a minor issue.  I don't know how accurate the information is, being a novice at puppy raising, but most of it seems like common sense.  I am also in the process of reading 5 books on the subject (2 by the monks) and there seem to be differing opinions on puppy raising; from training to grooming to feeding.  I think it would be wise to educate oneself as much as possible.  It's those first few days, weeks, and months that will create the relationship you will have with your dog for the rest of his life.  After watching this DVD, I wanted to go visit New Skete!  Beautiful!",1324252800,2,893,4.390243902439025
2469029,5,B000CQCIBQ,"Great dvd for anyone wanting a well behaved dog. It's best suited for those bringing a puppy home but the techniques can be used for older dogs as well. I have a 2 1/2 year female pitbull (dog aggressive)and used the techniques they outline in the behavior section in order to correct her when showing aggression toward other dogs. Needless to say she much more well behaved around other dogs when out on our walks. As a result, she's much calmer and is finally able to enjoy the walks we take!

The philosphy they teach may be a bit long at times but well worth listening to. This dvd is not meant for those people who are too sensitive to the type of physical correction they teach. They are by no means cruel or advocate physical punishment as a means to train BUT they do teach you the proper way to physically correct them in a way that does not hurt the dog but gets their attention. Their techniques work period! My dog and I are much happier as a result of this dvd.

Yes, the monks share a lot of teaching philosophy; they encourage you to be a benevolent leader, among other things. But, these guys are professionals. What should you expect? The training DVD is easy to follow. You'll be able to make your dog heel in 5 minutes! No, I'm only joking; it's not that easy....but, honestly, I've worked with a trainer before purchasing this DVD. The basic philosophy presented in this DVD is pretty much the same method used by the trainer. If you're really serious about wanting to have a well-mannered animal companion, then you might want to give this one a try.

This training video is a most informative,heartwarming and sensible dog training tool. It shows you how to teach your dog the basic commands. The video clearly demonstrates each command; and your role in teaching the command to your dog. The monks give insight into the world of the dog..explaining how dogs think,their natural pack order..and what makes dogs respond. Dogs are given praise for good behavior. Other training systems use food incentives for good response from animals. In my opinion,food as a reward is not only unhealthy for an animal but impractical when working in the field.

2469035,1,B000CQCIBQ,"This is nothing but mystical drivel.  I checked the DVD out of my library hoping to glean something, but watching it was a complete waste of time.  They show pictures of scenery that are totally irrelevant to the topic of dogs and when one of the men say anything, they're always trying to sound incredibly profound or poetic, but it turns out that they communicate nothing.  I wouldn't mind if there was a religious moment on the video to reflect on the greater purpose in which we relate to and raise dogs but there is never anything that resembles a Christian perspective on the video.  It's a lot more like eastern mysticism, existential double-talk, and mumbo-jumbo.",1272585600,8,671,4.758620689655173

But about this video, I feel this video doesn't add any additional training info that wasn't already in the book.  There are 2 DVDs, the first one is essentially about the Monk's philosophical approach to raising dogs.  The second DVD continues this philosophy and then finally, finally in the very last section there is some actual training demonstrations that lasts about 20 minutes.  But is is the SAME training material that is covered in the book as well.
