2171263,1,B00067BBZK,"Once again, I feel like, I have wasted my money. First, I purchased the C.D. and, I was disapointed. Then, I purchased the DVD thinking that it would give me a better idea of what the C.D. was lacking but it did not. I became a listener of Tonex's in 1998 when a friend of mine loaned me a copy of his {taxi} C.D. and, I have been a supporter of Tonex's projects every since then, I have nothing bad to say about him as he is a very inventive producer and singer but as for this project it seems like he is trying to get somewhere before it is time to arrive. I see nothing wrong with wanting to be successful but I feel it would be better if he would wait and let someone other than Tonex create the myth.

ps I also thought that he was a better dancer and performer than he showed us on the DVD I always thought if he had a chance to give a show on a stage big like the one he was on that he would really show the world that GOD can give the world better dancers and performer than the world has ever seen.",1103587200,,1008,3.8932038834951457
2171264,2,B00067BBZK,"I would recommend the out of the box cd. It is way better to listen to the album than watch it. I couldn't tell if this was a Prince or Usher concert or a gospel concert. I was seriously waiting for Michael Jackson to make an appearance on the stage. The dvd has way too much self promotion on it and at the same time some sacreligious pictures like where tonex replaces Jesus and puts his face(doesnt make sense). Alot of worldy material on here too, Way too much distractions. Is he suppose to be a man of God looking and dancing like that? Looks like a rock star to me. Towards the end it was alright with Sheila E. and Kirk Franklin but could have been better. This dvd DOES NOT fit in the ""MUST HAVE"" catergory, I recommend, Israel and Newbreed ""live from another level"" or Marvin Sapp ""Dairy of a Psalmist"" those dvds are must have gospel dvds. Im not satisfied with this dvd.",1102896000,3,882,4.287425149700598
2171265,3,B00067BBZK,"I got this dvd in total excitement. The CD was incredible so i assumed the DVD would be too. The dvd is just average. I personally feel tonex could had done so much more with this project. The show first started of slow. In the begining, Tonex comes out in some tight burgandy leather bootcut pants and it looks like he feels he is too cute to really let loose. After the first custom change the show improves a whole lot. The songs, like the cd, are incredible, the pictures of him and his wife before the 'taxi' song are adorable, and miss shelia e. gets really crunk on the drums in 'Todos juntos'. I would personally suggest getting the cd over the dvd (Buy the Cd, it is one of the best gosple cd's of 2004), but the dvd would be a nice addition to your movie libary.",1102118400,,772,4.1879194630872485
2171266,5,B00067BBZK,"This album is better seen than heard! Having a respect for Tonex and his unparallel vision, I have to say that I was more than inspired this Thanksgiving Day when I saw the concept companion DVD to the ""Out The Box"" album. WHOA!!! When you really want to get more from an artist, psalmist or minister of this caliber, you don't expect to get everything in one place. That's the reason why DVD's are produced; to receive extras that are not covered on VHS and CD formats. Tonex took me back, brought me closer to the present, and wet my interest for more to come in the future. This is unlike any other gospel live performance. This is more like sitting in the middle of an action movie or a stage play. (I have DVD surround sound and a Sony Trinitron HDTV, so the effects are impeccable. LOL!) The portion of the DVD that really gripped my attention was noticing the depth behind every section and scene by merely adding various backgrounds to the concert giving the show a storyline. (i.e. - ""Games"" surrounded by the ""Family Feud"" show setting.) Also, we see a host of excerpts of him preaching at his church with a very supportive membership, The Truth Apostolic Community Church. His messages are awe-inspiring, by the way!! Lastly, which I think is probably the most creative part of the DVD is the added visual features, like seeing Sheila E. appearing in hyperspeed while playing her percussion set on ""Todos Juntos"" and definitely, seeing the names of the people he mentioned on ""Your Word"" in the prophetic worship section. If you don't understand the lyrics on this song [they're also in the cd cover] you will be able to see them in part or whole on this DVD. Overall, this video is a must-see. Big ups to Steve ""The Chef"" Russell (Tonex's long-time technician, props and sound manager) for putting such determination in bringing Tonex's unique style and sound to life and etching it into our eyes, hearts, and minds. Don't contain Tonex!!! His talents and anointing are irreplaceable and needed to bring more souls closer to Christ. Creativity is never meant to remain in an enclosed area.",1101600000,,2101,4.681081081081081
2171267,5,B00067BBZK,"This DVD is a MUST have. I've never seen anything better,(and I've seen every gospel DVD there is to see) it's totally fresh and new.  Most gospel DVDs are just the standard performance--BORING--...Tonx brought the live experience, a  7 peice band, 40 voice choir, 4 dancers, and a crowd of almost 4,000 and packaged it all very neatly into this DVD. If you have the CD, you've gotta pick up the DVD, it gives you a look into Tonx's, ministry live. Even if you don't have the CD it stands alone as a great project.  Everyone I've shown it to has loved it and it ran out to pick up their copy. The music, creativity, choreography, most of all the anointing will compel you to watch it over, and over again.  There are so many things I'd like to say, but I want don't want to spoil it, just go get it, you'll be glad you did.

2171268,4,B00067BBZK,"This DVD is actually the Out The Box cd,as far as the concert is concerned its the same as the cd,it do have a few extras as far as intermissions not on the cd and seeing Tonex dance. I really was expecting more the concert is constanly interupted by other footage like pictures and other live shows in the midst of the

Out the Box concert.

From the hype for this DVD I was expecting a

uninterupted concert of praise like CeCe Winans DVD.

CeCe's DVD is much better because its uninterupted

worship and praise like I was expecting Tonex's to

be and to make it worse Tonex's DVD is the same

as the cd so if you already have the cd you may

want to save your money on the DVD unless you want

to see the visuals but I must say I did enjoy

watching Tonex and Shila E on ""Todos Juntos"" Shila

E is awesome and my mother likes her,so thanks to Shila

E I feel my money was not wasted and also thanks to the

extras that you don't get on the cd so for me its like

a better/sweet buy.

God Bless",1101340800,3,996,3.984771573604061
2171269,5,B00067BBZK,"Everything you liked about the cd...is represented in picture form. I like to write reviews but i'm gonna pass on this one... the cd should have been called off the hook cos it's more than amazing... usher take lessons; everyone take lessons. the standard of gospel has been raised once again.

this isn't the most helpful review but when you see it, you'll know what i mean when i say i have no words for this.

2171290,5,B00067BBZK,"Tonex has a very free spirit. Those who believe that he goes over board or does a little too much are those who are still living on the ""STONE AGE!"" This is a new generation with new demons and new blue prints. They way the enemy tempted the older saints is not the way he is tempting us today. He's coming harder and more powerful than ever before. It's time out for tradition or church as usual because you can rest assure that Satan is not rising up against us with fornication as usual, drugs as usual, homosexuality as usual, rebellion as usual, even hypocritical and judgemental as usual. We can't continue to fight the devil and his boys with their new strategies with our traditional tactics. Our praise needs to be free. If dressing a little outside the church satisfaction is what it takes to bring them in then let's do what we have to do to get the lost souls in and THEN once we have them home we can begin the healing process and start to impart to them what being saved is all about but they have get in the door first. By Any Means Necessary. And if we feel that someone is doing something inappropriate than we need to incourage whoever it may be to maybe do it a little differently not discourage them because WE FEEL it's wrong. We all have our ways of praising God. There is no where in the Bible that states HOW He want us to bless Him and praise Him...He just wants us to do it. Basically you have to have a radical praise to understand a radical praiser.(it takes one to know one) Also take into consideration what his past may have been. We don't know ALL that he had to overcome and there may still be strongholds on him that through his RIDICAL PRAISE are being broken off him so that he can be as free as possible. We ""christians"" need to learn not to point the finger or bad mouth everything that we don't understand. Everything that God may give someone is not for everyone to understand.(what God has for me it is for me) If you are a rdical saint with a radical praise, if you are ready to break out of tradition and tear down the walls of the church, if you are ready to experience a greater more powerful demension in the spirit realm, even if you are craving for a new way to worship the Lord...this CD is for you. (Tonex, keep on doing what you're doing because you do it well. Get all that God has for you. Continue to do everything you do for the Lord so He will get the glory in all that you do. Let the haters hate because ""The Lord shall cause your enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before your face; they shall come out against you in one way and flee before you in seven ways. The Lord shall command the blessing upon you in your storehouse and in all that you undertake. And He will bless you in the land which the Lord your God gives you."" Deuteronomy 28:7&8 The best is yet to come...Your latter shall be greater than your past. God bless you all and be encouraged in the Lord. God Is Good and All Is Well.",1139356800,3,2964,4.210896309314587
2171291,2,B00067BBZK,"This young man has no anointing. I saw him live in concert in DC this past summer, and when the audience didn't quite react the way he thought they should, he kept saying that his voice was only 90% cause he has been touring, but that's not why they did not react, there was no evident anointing, and I went to see him specifically because I'm a fan of some of his recordings. DC has seen it all and this is no easy audience. You have to come correct here with the anointing! You can be as eclectic an artist as you please, but if God does not anointed it, It's only entertainment. Some may debate stepping out of the box is good, and it is, but when you step out it has to still be anointed. I don't need a ""Gospel"" version of anybody, I need to be ministered to under the unction of the Holy Spirit! Nor do we need a revolution in Gospel music, we need young folks who will stand and declare the delivering power of Jesus Christ, under the anointing of God!!!!!!! I like Tonex, but the anointing is universal, so you can't hide the fact that there is none, just cause you like the dude or his talent. The anointing doesn't just sound good, it destroys yokes! Gospel music is the good news of Jesus Christ! You can sing it, but the singer still has to be anointed, not just the words.

Forget talent and production, ONLY what you do for CHRIST will last!!!!! I'm praying for him!",1138233600,9,1380,4.2272727272727275
2171292,5,B00067BBZK,"This anointed man of God is truly, truly blessed. I just recently got the DVD and, to say the least, I was completely blown away. This DVD has changed the way I look at Gospel music today. I am only 16 years old and I am crazy for God. I believe that Tonex was strategically placed, by God, in this time for young people. He has really touched my life in so many ways. Songs that have really made an impact on my life are Children's Bread, Spirit Realm, Make Me Over, Alive, Since Jesus Came, and Personal Jesus. My favorites are Games, Work On Me, Alive 2, or better yet, THE WHOLE DVD. Please get a copy. It will help you in more ways than one.",1134000000,3,646,4.094488188976378
2171293,5,B00067BBZK,"THIS DVD IS AWESOME. TONEX DID AN EXCELLENT JOB. OUT THE BOX IS DIFFERENT FROM YOUR ""REGULAR"" CONCERT. THIS CONCERT IS OFF THE CHAIN. THE BAND, TONEX, AND THE CHOIR IS BLAZZIN' SOME OF THE DVD ARE REALLY NOT THAT GOOD. FOR AN EXAMPLE I WISH THAT ONE THE SONG ALIVE 2 THEY WOULD SHOW MORE OF THE CONCERT INSTEAD OF THE GRAPHICS THAT ARE SHOWN. THE SONG IS STILL EXCELLENT BUT THE GRAPHICS WAS REALLY NOT THAT GOOD.

IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS DVD YOU NEED TO GET IT",1127088000,5,459,4.1
2171294,5,B00067BBZK,After reading the reviews I felt in my heart to say something.  Tonex's DVD has brought a special annoiting in my home.  I did not feel that this was at all about Tonex.  The ministry that has unfolded in this DVD clearly shows how God has blessed this youngman and given him many talents.  Please remember what the purpose of ministry is..don't look at the person but the God that is inside them.  If you've watched this DVD with a closed mind then I pray for you.  My family and I will watch it over and over and continue to be blessed through the words and instruments God has given him to share with everyone.  I'm only 28 but it enlightens my heart to see young people go crazy for God.  We need more people that's not afraid to step OUT OF THE BOX.  Get this DVD if you're not afraid of change and want to see young people on fire for the Lord!,1117756800,8,850,4.134146341463414
2171295,3,B00067BBZK,"When asked how he would describe Tonex's concert on the DVD, Kirk Franklin pretty much described it as a concert by an artist who happens to be a Christian.  He said he wouldn't call it a Gospel concert and he was right!  This is NOT a Christo-centric performance!  It focuses 90% of the energy on Tonex'!  From the intro to the news clippings, to images embedded in the visuals of him as a Christ figure!  If you are honest about it, it doesn't cause you to focus on Jesus, but on Tonex'!  This concert is all about Tonex'.  Having said that if you want a high energy performance from an artist who just happens to be Christian.  You will enjoy it, because he is a gifted young man.  I just do not view it as a Gospel concert or the so-called next level in praise and worship!  Many have tried as Tonex' proclaims to take us to the next level, to make history.  Trust me it won't happen unless you focus on His-Story!  At the end of the day it's still all about Jesus, and in this performance you will find yourself searching for Him, because His-Story is buried beneath Tonex's desire to be the next great entertainer, the next Prince, or Micheal Jackson!",1116547200,21,1157,4.355140186915888
2171296,5,B00067BBZK,"Well, I finally saw the DVD, and I was impressed. I wasn't blown away as I expected, but I was impressed nonetheless. The best gospel DVD I've ever seen, in terms of innovation and energy. I thought that they could have showed the choir more though, because I only saw them in bits and pieces, and when they did show them it would be for a millisecond. But still, great DVD........

Favourite scenes:

Alive 1 & 2

Children's Bread

Taxi Overture/Taxi

Todos Juntos (Sheila E. is a MONSTER)

Make Me Over (Seeing it live was a whole new experience, as if I heard for the first time again)

Get it now if you don't have it, and don't be like the naysayers, nit-picking on every little detail. Just enjoy the DVD for what it is.",1105315200,9,726,4.333333333333333
2171297,5,B00067BBZK,"I love Gospel Music, Traditional, Contemporary, Rap, As long as it is Praising JESUS CHRIST!! TONEX IS COMPLETELY OFF THE CHAIN!!!!. I always wondered what the music scene would be like with someone who is as talented as Michael Jackson, Prince, Steveie Wonder, and Terrence Trent Darby and was SAVED AND FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST!!. I NEED WONDER NO LONGER!!!!. This Man is truly gifted and Blessed by the Holy Spirit. Please do yourself a great blessing and pick up this DVD and the CD... DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS YOUNG MAN!!",1105142400,7,524,4.645161290322581
2171298,5,B00067BBZK,"I consider myself to be the harshest of critics.  As a musician and singer myself, I'm very particular about what products deserve my hard earned cash.  Because of this I rely heavily on well thought out reviews and don't usually pay much attention to those hyped up fans who give 5 stars to everything!  Thankfully, however, this time I completely ignored the unjustifiably negative reviews that I read and went out on a limb to get this DVD.

If there is anyone dithering over whether to get this or not... buy this without delay!  Not only is Tonex an exceptionally great singer, writer, producer and musician (evidenced on the dvd), he is a great conceptualist and this dvd showcases this to the max.  There is nothing like this at all in gospel music today.  In all honesty, if there were more gospel music/live experiences like this around I would never buy another secular CD as long as I live!  As it stands this isn't the case so I'll just have to store this among the other great music classics in my collection.

Well done Tonex!",1104969600,8,1040,4.578378378378378
2171299,5,B00067BBZK,"Tonex is an incredible vocalist, dancer, producer, conceptualist. I think that he has the vision and the potential to cross over into the mainstream market of music with his visions.

My 8 year old hasn't put this video down since we've received it. (the day after Thanksgiving). She's learning the dance routines and knows the names of all of the performers, as well as, many of the lyrics.

For all it's worth, I would rather see today's youth watching something like this, than many of the other audio/visual presentations I've seen on MTV & Bet, Vh1, etc.

The musical genre's are similar, (jazz, neo soul, rock, r&b, hip hop, latin, etc.)  but I think the message in the presentation addresses the concerns of today with fundamentals of Christianity. Many of the complaints that many have had about today music videos, including extremely revealing dancers, nasty lyrics, confusing messages about sex, etc. are addressed in this DVD.

Anyone who has come to our home and has seen the video, goes out and buys a copy for themselves. While there were a couple of things that I did not understand, much of the editing is wonderfully creative.

For those who are traditionalist in terms of gopel music (...and this DVD will have a tendacy to point you out), this may be a little 'over the top'. For those who are more open and for young one's, the general message is that you can dance, party, sing, have fun, dress funky, wear your hair wild (...or not) be ""cool"" and still be a bona fide Christian. It would take just such a movement to bring the younger generation back to the church.

My favorite scene was the ""shout"". A must see...I've never seen anyone do that dance like Tonex! Sheila Escovito, was great and so was Kirk Franklin...a forefather of this evolution in non-secular music.

With all of this in mind, I would say this is a must see dvd experience.",1103673600,10,1867,4.670731707317073
8039633,5,B00067BBZK,"I wish he were still around to do music like this! I would have liked to have been apart of this concert too. It was jammed packed with banging beats, beautiful voices, and guest appearances. And that was over ten years ago that this concert was done. I would pay to see him now if he redid Out The Box. He's such a musical talent that, again, it is a pity he retired this name, and moved on.",1445558400,,392,4.038461538461538

8039638,4,B00067BBZK,"This dvd was very fun and up lifting. Tonex goes to show how talented he really is and how much of a follower of God he was back then. I pray that he continues to follow God the way he did in this video. I enjoyed it.

8039639,4,B00067BBZK,"Tonex is so out of the box, he is a genius for titling this ""movie"" as such.  I call it a movie, even though its a live concert, its organized by genre of  type of gospel music.  You can tell he put some serious time into the editing of this dvd.  Also, the concert is very well choreographed and executed.  Some of the songs is over my head, but I did enjoy the ""slower"" songs as well as the older songs he sang. This is worth having in your dvd collection if you love good contemporary gospel music.",1218585600,,501,4.071428571428571
8039640,1,B00067BBZK,"Tonex is out of his mind.  This dvd gave me and my sister a headache after only 15 minutes.  Don't waste your money or time on this project.

8039641,5,B00067BBZK,"I don't have a DVD player, but I said if I ever did, I would get Tonex's dvd first. I kept waiting and waiting till I could buy the player and then I said I'm gonna stop waiting for the player and just buy it, and so I did a little over a week ago. I watched it at other people's houses who have dvd players about four times. I can't get enough of this dvd!!!!! Every time I watch it, I am filled with joy and praise like an abundant river..after a dry season feeling like a bare oak tree in my walk, this has been refreshing and more than an answered prayer!!!!!!!!!! I have most of Tonex's work and I appreicate ever line and key, it's so beautiful his heart after God, being used in boldness stepping outta the box and being unique, I am in awe:) Wonderful how the concert and dvd with each chosen individual was for such a time as this--videos, awesome graphics, reflection, sign-language, spanish, interview, dance, Holy-ghost feet-washing festive time causes every soul to draw close to Jesus and change!!! Amen, Tonex,amen. I am so blessed by your obedience and this is not half of what my heart has to say after being washed, cleansed and tanned from the light of my Lord...this was not a gospel concert, this was a LIFETIME EXPERIENCE!! Those individuals I went to, borrowing their dvd player, I thought would enjoy this and fall down in the hours of the Holy Ghost, but they fleed from the house..and because of that, I was able to find my Lord in an intimate and personal way, renewing and restoring my soul. If you are looking to be entertained or for some ordainary gospel concert, you're gonna get your feelings hurt when you watch this. Cause this warfare, in the drum beats, in the scriptural lyrics, even in his high notes and moans, the Holy Ghost was speaking and moving. Don't delay another moment reading reviews and listening to other views..get Tonex's dvd now and reap your reward. This is definitely for those of us who have searched and searched for something extra-ordinary in many elements of our life, not ever wanting to be put in a box or defined by our outward appearance, but by our heart for God alone. To those peculiar people, in the chosen generation, want you to know there are others like you, more than Tonex, hold on, we'll all meet up in a little while. Thank you sooo much, Tonex, you're bringing us outta the box..look forward to meeting you in due season.",1143849600,5,2400,4.481735159817352

What a powerful man of God he is!!",1142899200,2,338,4.524590163934426
