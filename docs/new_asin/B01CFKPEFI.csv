7682810,5,B01CFKPEFI,This documentary is a must see! The conversations are candid. It clearly let's us women know that we do not have an expiration date after a certain age. The women in the documentary can't help but inspire! I'd like to see a sequel!,1465603200,3,231,4.395348837209302
7682811,5,B01CFKPEFI,"Don't miss this one. Beautifully done interviews with dynamic women who are older in age but not in body or mind. Ertha Kitt and Nancy Freedman, in particular, light up the screen. Kudos to director and interviewer  Elaine Madsen, and her equally gorgeous and famous-actress daughter (Virginia) who encouraged her mother to do this project, accompanied her along the way and was the executive producer. Bravissimo!",1463788800,3,414,5.2727272727272725

8752949,5,B01CFKPEFI,"I loved this! I am in the beginning of my silver haired, creaky joints and invisible years and this movie inspired me to get up! I am still here, and I have much to do and say! Thank you so much for sharing all the wisdom and the joy!!!",1507939200,,236,3.836734693877551
8752950,5,B01CFKPEFI,"This is an inspirational and motivational documentary women and girls of any age should watch (boys too) about how one person with the right attitude can make a difference. It is also an illustration of how important it is for women to encourage, mentor and lift each other up so we can continue to change the world! I bought copies for several of my friends turning 60 this year. I highly recommend.",1486339200,,400,4.569444444444445
8752951,3,B01CFKPEFI,"My wife and I watched this together last week. The women were very inspiring and intriguing, and it certainly gave me more hope about my own aging process, which I feel is going well! I loved their vitality and messages.

The very poor film editing, however, really got in the way of enjoying the film as a film, and many times the flow of the thought, story, emotion of the moment was herky jerky chopped up and cut away. Poor planning for sound in the cafe was a demonstration, unfortunately, of the amatuer approach to the making of the film. I was also sad to see the main interviewer gaining weight and aging, indicating some kind of stress happening for her during the course of the making of the film. That most of the interviews  were accompanied with wine also I felt not a positive choice. Do we really have to see people drinking and talking?
Thank you for making the film and sharing the peoples' stories. It is kind of an unfortunate aspect of our cutlure, and world, that we have to make a film like this...",1481932800,,1021,4.425531914893617
8752952,5,B01CFKPEFI,Awesome movie on our misconceptions of aging.,1475020800,,45,5.571428571428571
8752953,5,B01CFKPEFI,A very well done documentary.  I enjoyed watching it and sharing it with my girlfriends.,1471132800,,88,4.866666666666666
8752954,4,B01CFKPEFI,"Good, inspiring, short documentary.  I could have done without the ""f"" bomb.",1469577600,,76,5.333333333333333
8752955,4,B01CFKPEFI,"This was a very pleasant experience for both my husband and I to watch this film.  It was very interesting the whole time, but not so intense it was ""stressful,"" or too serious, like some documentaries. Nor was it so light that it was not worth my five dollars to watch it.  We both felt enriched conversing, and knowing these people.  Very unique, subject matter, too.  Do yourself a favor and watch something uplifting like this, a slice of real life.
I left off one star, because I wanted the interviewer to go a bit deeper, let the interviewee be able to take the questions to their own place with it, she would sometimes interrupt them to stay on track, a bit controlling because her questions were fairly superficial at those times, compared to what the person may have begun to talk about. They could have been freer to answer more in depth, I thought.  Still, I feel it was an honest, authentic film for the most part, and admire that.",1467763200,2,943,4.491228070175438
8752956,5,B01CFKPEFI,"A great documentary.  This is a wonderful inspiration, while all those interviewed are women, I think it would be just as inspiring to men.  Getting older is something that we all must face, and how we handle it and what we do with our life skills is what makes you a Woman Like That, or not.  It's not about doing grandiose things, it's just about doing and never stopping, I recommend this for all ages",1467676800,,404,4.36
8752957,5,B01CFKPEFI,"This is a wonderful, inspiring look at beautiful women who have achieved admirable ages - in their 60s, 70s, 80. -and 90s. They are honest, funny and still enthusiastically involved in a productive life. Thank you for bringing this wonderful documentary experience to us, especially those of us who have wondered if it is possible to have an impact after a certain age.",1466899200,,369,4.873015873015873
