8471249,4,B005G6G3DG,"In ""Der Ostfriesen-Report"" 1 and 2 (""The East Frisian Report"", East Frisia is a region in the northwest of Germany, situated between the Netherlands and the North Sea), which were both directed by Walter Boos; one gets two for the price of one.

In ""Der Ostfriesen-Report - teil 1: O mei, haben die Ostfriesen Riesen"" (from 1973), when the imposingly tall and fat, overfed, and gluttonous owner (resembling a typical Gauleiter or Reichsleiter of the Nazi era), of a struggling Munich ""strip tease"" bar, sends his two underlings to the backwater of East Frisia: in search of new, young and fresh talent; not everything goes according to plan. There's plenty of shapely, beautiful, and sexy Nordic women on display!

The cast of ravishing lovelies: Margot Mahler, Alena Penz, Alexandra Bogojevic, Elke Boltenhagen, sensuous Claudia Fielers, Gisela Schwartz, Elke Deuringer, Marie Luise Lusewitz, Karin Hofmann, Monika Micklich,Tina Lercher, Isa Brandt, Evelyn Raess, Juliane Rom-Sock, Uschi Stiegelmaier, the voluptuous Melitta Tegeler, from ""Gef&auml;hrlicher Sex fr&uuml;hreifer M&auml;dchen 2: H&ouml;llisch hei&szlig;e M&auml;dchen"" (see my review), and ""Die M&auml;dchenh&auml;ndler"" both from 1972, Gudrun Thiel, and naturally sexy Marita Vogelsang from ""Liebesmarkt"" from 1973, Rosi Schubert, etc.

""Der Ostfriesen-Report - teil 2: Die Rache der Ostfriesen"" (from 1974), which was a kind of follow-up to the first one, with pretty much the same cast; except the characters were different. When a couple of fast-talking, heavy farm-machinery salesmen head north to the ""cow pastures"" of East Frisia, thinking they could con the unassuming locals; not everything goes according to plan, again! The cast of lovelies:  Alexandra Bogojevic, Elke Deuringer, Gaby Steiner, etc.

As I've said numerous times already---oh......how I wish time travel were possible......I'd know my first destination!
The DVD picture and sound quality is absolutely perfect, completely pristine. PAL format, German (no English subtitles), FFN, NR 155 mins. (BTW: I bought the DVD through Amazon.de for 10.08 euros.)

Love and Peace,
