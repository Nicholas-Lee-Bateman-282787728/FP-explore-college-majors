8185674,5,B000OMNYSY,"Fireboats of 9-11 is not only about 9-11, rather it is a history of the Marine Division of the FDNY.  The archival movie footage - some from the nineteenth century, is truly amazing.  It is supplemented by excellent animations of other events, and still photographs enhanced with the ""Ken Burns effect.""

Some of the little-seen images of land-units responding to 9-11 illustrate why the firefighters' loss of life was so high - the crashes happened during shift-change at most fire houses, so units responded with double or triple crews, men riding anywhere they could hang on.",1236038400,,578,5.0
