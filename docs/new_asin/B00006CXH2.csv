1742891,5,B00006CXH2,"Godard brought an element of playfulness to the cinema.  He turned the conventions of filmmaking and writing upside down.  Roman Coppola seems to be following Godard's lead, about 40 years afterwards.  The story is silly, routed in satire not all that different from Kubrick and Godard.  It's the story of a young understudy, who after studying under several directors (the unhappy artist re: Coppola or Kubrick and the glitzy sci-fi sex and action guy re: Lucas) on the same film, eventually gets his big break since he knows the film best.  He's seen ever inch of the film backwards and forwards repeatedly on the editing table.  Why he was given this break, we are not sure.  Could the producers have thought they could create a puppet to make the film their way?  Not to mention that he's in love with a stunning lead actress who's otherworldly beauty could only actually exist in the movies.  But the plot plays second fiddle to much of the philosophy behind the film.  The critical analysis of filmmaking, especially that of Hollywood filmmaking
The cinematography and set design looks like a combination of Blow up and a low budget 2001: A Space Oddessy.  And the soundtrack is very similar to the atmospheric ambience created in the Virgin Suicides.
The only problem with CQ is that it seems too short.  Maybe Coppola thought he couldn't pull the joke off for more than 90 minutes but I was left wanting more.",1053388800,2,1417,4.762295081967213
1742892,4,B00006CXH2,"""CQ"" is the first feature film directed by Roman Coppola, son of much famous director Francis Ford.  But you should forget that fact for a while, and enjoy the strange world of the 1960s he created for the film.
The film is set in Paris in 1969, the time of revolution.  An American film editor Paul (Jeremy Davis) is working for a small studio there hired by an Italian producer (Giancarlo Giannini, ""Hannibal"").  At his small flat, with his camera, Paul keeps on filming his own life, or making a film about the ""truth"" of life -- meaning cinema verite, you got it? -- while his sweet French girlfriend is not so enthusiastic about his works.  Well, his life seems going nowhere when suddenly he is given a chance: a chance to direct a grade B-Sci-fi movie ""Dragonfly"" (not that Kevin's film).  But there is one big trouble.  They could not find the right ending of the film yet.
Coppola's ""CQ"" proceeds side by side with Paul's film-within-film ""Dragonfly,"" featuring the titular female spy, who looks as if coming straight from ""Modesty Blaise"" and ""Barbarella.""  Paul is absorbed in making this film, and drawn to the heroine (and its actress Valentine, perfectly played by Angela Lindvall) while his own life, especially the relations with his girlfriend, begins gradually to play the secondary role.
Even if you are not particularly a fan of the films of the late 60s, you'll soon find that the greatest virtue of ""CQ"" lies in  its re-creation of the psychedelic fashion and energetic atomosphere of the time.  Cheep-looking, but strangely amusing production designs, and delightfully quirky costumes of ""Dragonfly"" would be joyful to you, especially when you have some knowledge about the time of Yellow Submarine even though Paul's own story is, compared with the detailed images of ""Dragonfly,"" weak and uninteresting.
You can, however, find lots of intriguing reference to the films in the past, and its interesting cast are really helpful.  See. for example, the faces of Billy Zane, Jason Schwartzman, Gerard Depardieu, Sophia Coppola, Dean Stockwell, and John Phillip Law (who was in, yes, ""Barbarella"").  The film (I mean the entire ""CQ"" and ""Dragonfly"") is sometimes too self-indulgent, but the first-time player Lindvall is so credible as beautiful  Dragonfly/Valentine that if you fondly remember that constumes of Jane Fonda, you will love her anyway.  And the French group Mellow's soundtrack, which might remind you of the music of the Beatles of post-Sgt. Pepper era, is another merit of the film.",1043193600,6,2519,5.011990407673861
1742893,4,B00006CXH2,"I agree with most reviews in that this movie had no real punch at the end that made it feel complete. But, it was interesting the whole way through, a highly enjoyable rental. Thats more than one can say for 99% of the movies out there. Hence, four stars.",1042416000,,255,4.224489795918367
1742894,3,B00006CXH2,"Cheeky, cheesy, funny, and thoughtful!  I discovered this small gem of a film and rented it w/no idea of it except for what the back cover disclosed.  Upon initial reading, I thought it might be akin to the ""Matt Helm"" or ""Flynnt"" films of the 1960's with a twist or a spoof of the spy film genre.  I was wrong.

  It's Roman Coppola's (Nicholas Cage's cousin) sentimental treatment of his early movie-watching experience as well as the personel odyssey of a first time director against the backdrop of the making of a late 60's/early 70's spy film.  The idea of a film within a film is not new and could be confusing; however, Mr. Coppola's use of the technique works for him here.  Though it is not the best film of 2002, it is an intelligent, thought-provoking, and entertaining little movie.

  The caliber of talent Mr. Coppola assembled in Jeremy Davis, Elodie Bouchez, Angela Lindvall, Giancarlo Giannini, Gerard Depardieu, Jason Schwartzman, John Philip Law, and Dean Stockwell go a long way in making this a little gem and not a lump of coal.  The choice for casting worked nicely for this 1st time director.  The confusion and searching portrayed by Davis' character kept me interested in his trials and tribulations as he tries to find truth through the media of movies in his life.  It is his search that ultimately made me like the film.  This main character is neither good or bad, but a man trying to find his way in the world he has chosen, meanwhile, like the rest of us, he still has a day job [sound editor-turn-director] to contend with while searching.  It is Mr. Coppola's handling of this character that will either keep or lose you in the film.  His first outing shows he has definite potential and not just b/c of family ties.  As his first directorial movie, its likable.

  On a secondary note, the music and cinematography are reminiscent of the times.  The Dragonfly visual sequences and soundtrack provided by Mellow almost take you back to those psycodelic times.  Compare the Dragonfly scenes w/movies of the same period and you will notice how well the cinematography was done.  The background music, though could sound cheesy, comes across authentic.  In both categories, Mr. Coppola did nicely.  It would seem his choice of music was influenced by his sister's ""The Virgin Suicides"" OST, except the dark electro-synth sounds of Air are replaced in ""CQ"" with the dreamy, relaxed sounds of Mellow.

  In conclusion, if you're looking for a little movie done sentimentally, but not sappy about a person searching for truth to the background of some laid-back sounds, then CQ is the film for you.",1033948800,15,2627,4.775555555555556
1742895,3,B00006CXH2,"On the surface, CQ seems to hold promise as an off-beat look at the art of filmmaking. The story of an editor turned director struggling his way through a cheesy sci-fi film of the late 60's sounds very intriguing. I had high hopes for this film, directed by the son of Francis Ford Coppola.
Indeed, the directing style shows some promise, and I hope this Coppola refines his story-telling methods, because there is some promise here. But for the most part, what he delivers here is a scattered, schizophrenic film that seems to have a lot of ideas, yet never makes any one of them clear. It's like the director had so much to say, he couldn't decide what was important, so he threw everything in the mix. Perhaps the film is supposed to emulate Jeremy Davis's director role in the film: trying to say something in his movie but not knowing what that something is.
What somewhat saves this film is the quirky sci-fi film the characters are making and the excellent cast. Jeremy Davis is great as the editor-come-director, and Gerard Depardieu and Jason Schwartzman as the directors that came before him play their roles perfectly, especially Schwartzman.
But in the end, the film just seems to fail making a single point. Worth a rental to check out the cast, but that's it.",1032220800,3,1274,4.666666666666667
1742896,5,B00006CXH2,"OK maybe this film isn't the best thing since sliced bread and maybe some of the melodrama is unbelieveable, but this is a darn good debut from a promising new director. In fact, many of the camera angles and artifices Roman Coppola used in the film were very reminiscent of his fathers golden years (Pre-""Jack"") more so then say.....The Virgin Suicides? And although it isn't going to change the history of cinema in any way, I give this one five guilty pleasure stars. Fun to watch without taking you for an idiot, a very rare combination in Hollywood today.",1031616000,2,560,4.666666666666667
1742897,3,B00006CXH2,"One of the taglines from Roman Coppola's ""CQ"" is ""every picture tells a story.""  Indeed.  Unfortunately, the writer/director (son of Francis) also believes that every story is worth telling.  This is where ""CQ"" falls short.  It's three movies all rolled into one.  Well, sort of.  Actually, it's really only one movie--about the making of two movies.  Still with me?
Its 1969 and the revolution that swept through French cinema is all but at an end in Paris.  Most of the visionary and radical techniques developed during La Nouvelle Vague have been absorbed into mainstream movie-making.  So much the better.  Those who once critiqued film, invaded the movie-making process.  Renouncing the steady gloss and glow of Hollywood counterparts, their trademarks included dominant hand-held camera motion, natural light instead of manufactured, follow-spot tracking and convention-breaking editing styles that presented stories which favored the inner human struggle over exterior conflicts.  Long, uncut takes, open-ended endings and improvised dialogue from mostly unknown actors were not uncommon elements for these directors who sought out the appeal of a younger, more influencing audience.
We meet filmmaker Andrzej (Grard Depardieu), a veteran of this revolution hired by a main-stream producer to direct a main-stream ""sci-spy"" sexploitation film, ""Dragonfly"" (think ""Barbarella"").  Only he's not delivering on the goods.  The bombastic producer (played with relish by Giancarlo Giannini) wants gloss, glitter and an explosive ending to top all endings.  Andrzej would rather punch a hole through a wall than compromise his art.  In fact, he does.
Enter Paul, the young American film editor, a meek, bleak character that Jeremy Davies plays so well.  Paul is lost.  He's searching for personal truth.  Truth in love, truth in art, truth in life.  He edits ""Dragonfly"" by day but uses his free time to produce a personal documentary, filming himself, his girlfriend and his sourroundings--an exercise he hopes will reveal the truth in his life.
But what happens when Andrzej is fired from ""Dragonfly"" and Paul is promoted?  That's the strength of ""CQ.""  Truth in art is put to the test as Paul finds himself in the director's seat.  Truth in love is challenged when he falls for Dragonfly herself.  Will he find his personal truth when all is said and done, or is personal truth something you make up as you go?  What a wonderful theme to explore!  Does Paul evolve from a boring, lifeless sap into a caring, feeling, hopeful individual?  Here's a guy looking for the truth in his life yet he can't see the forest for the trees.  Will he ever?
Coppola doesn't care to answer.  Instead, the film trips over its own potential.  It uses all three films (""Dragonfly,"" Paul's documentary, and itself) to tell the story.  One moment we're watching Paul film ""Dragonfly,"" and then we're actually watching ""Dragonfly.""  This is a gimmick that has worked brilliantly in such films as ""Living in Oblivion"" and ""The Big Picture.""  But it fails here.  Why?  Because it doesn't serve the movie.  And why should it?  It plays rather nicely on its own.  Coppola knows his story and characters are barely above the line of interest and could never survive a straight telling of the tale.  They need the gimmick.  It's a diversion.  It diverts.
Hows that for personal truth?",1031529600,,3359,5.134935304990758

1742930,5,B00006CXH2,"This first effort by writer/director Roman Coppola has left me wanting more from him for the past decade. It's sharp, unbelievably fun, a gorgeous recreation of late 1960s B-movies, and at its heart something quietly moving & poignant. The premise: Paul, a young film editor in Paris, December 1969, is working on a low-budget sci-fi/spy film (""Codename: Dragonfly"") with artistic & revolutionary pretensions, one that partakes of the political & cultural ferment that's been in the air for the past few years. When the director is fired, Paul suddenly finds himself in the director's chair himself, charged with coming up with a viable ending for the film.

The problem, of course, is that Paul's real life is at extremely loose ends. His relationship with Parisian girlfriend Marlene is fraying, he's struggling to make a B&W documentary that's ""totally honest"" but somehow uninspired, and his vision of the film keeps overlapping with everyday life -- so much so that he's not sure if the actress playing Dragonfly is interested in him, or if it's the fictional character herself, speaking from within the story. Or is that just what's playing out in his confused head?

What I especially love about this little film is that while it glories in the ridiculous excess of the times, it also has a real affection for it as well. Perhaps the original director's hope of making a truly subversive & revolutionary film is just naive self-delusion ... but it's how so many creative people at the time actually felt. That feeling of hope, of boundless possibilities about to reach full flower, is captured beautifully, even as it's gently deflated.

And it gets the look right, too. Too many contemporary films about the 1960s look as if everyone onscreen is at a bad 1960s-themed costume party, awkward & unconvincing & far too 21st Century. Not so here! Even as it goes a little over the top, the film looks & feels authentic, true to the time it's recreating. This is aided immensely by the look of ""Codename: Dragonfly"" itself -- no CGI, no modern special effects, everything done as it would have been done in 1969.

There's so much to like in the little details here that I can't possibly name them all. As just one example, let me single out Billy Zane's portrayal of the Che-like revolutionary on the dark side of the moon -- he must have had a ball playing this character! And the presence of veteran 1960s actor John Philip Law is a real bonus. Plus the DVD itself is packed with features & a fine commentary, a welcome embarrassment of riches that puts many bigger DVD releases to shame.

In the end, this is something of a coming-of-age film, both for Paul & for youthful ideals in general. If it doesn't have overly grand ambitions, it succeeds completely in its modest goals. It's wonderfully rewatchable, and you may find yourself thinking about your own youth when it's done, remembering those lost dreams & ideals, wondering where they all went. Yet Paul gains more than he loses -- he's ready to meet the world more on his own terms, now that he knows what those terms are -- most highly recommended!",1376956800,3,3113,4.778810408921933

It is a homage to the quirky, avant garde European sci-fi films of the 1960's that is part history lesson (if you know what to look for) and part love letter to an era of cinema magic. It's heart is Barbarella, but it's so much more then that. The cinematography is spot on for the time period, as is the soundtrack. And what a cast! Well worth hunting up!",1354579200,2,376,4.094594594594595
1742933,3,B00006CXH2,"This is the first feature film by Roman Coppola (son of Francis Ford Coppola) and is one of those films that says ""I'm not sure why I liked it but I did,"" which means of course, many won't.  Paul (Jeremy Davies, TV's ""Justified"") is an American living in Paris in 1969 working in the movie industry that focuses on schlock ""B"" movies.  His current film is a silly sci-fi secret agent film called ""Dragonfly"" (Angela Lindvall) which is the government agent's code name.

Paul's real passion however is a black and white documentary he is working on which mainly consists of filming things around his apartment which he shares with an Air France flight attendant (Elodie Bouchez).  He spends much of this personal film sitting on a toilet (uh, like a chair) talking into the camera.  Better lighting in the bathroom I guess.

The filmmakers do a nice job of creating the look of films shot in the late 60's, especially those of smaller budgets.  And the film within a film, ""Dragonfly"" carries that same look of the era.  ""Barbarella"" is certainly an influence.  Paul is essentially a quiet, insecure individual not sure what he's trying to accomplish.  His relationship with Marlene (Bouchez) is souring as he ignores her for the most part.

A couple things transpire that begin to change his life.  The director of the film, as well as an interim director (Gerard Depardieu and Jason Schwartzman), leave the picture that isn't finished.  The producer (Giancarlo Giannini) then promotes Paul who is the editor and second unit director, to write an ending and finish the film.  Using influences of his own life, dreams and fantasies (""CQ"" = seek you), he does.  The movie isn't polished and hits a few snags, but I found it enjoyable and fun.",1344297600,,1740,4.7725752508361206
1742934,1,B00006CXH2,"CQ, 1969 film

The story starts in an apartment where a man is taking monochrome home movies in 1969. [Didn't they have color then?] Then there is a surprise. This is filmed to look very amateurish and unpolished. But this doesn't fool anybody. The script sounds like something a student would write. No ending? No sale? ""Shut down the production"" says the producer. ""This is the worst."" This movie seems to get worse as it runs on!

There are changes in personnel. They plan a science fiction movie set on the dark side of the moon. ""World Council Headquarters"" plans to hire agent ""Dragonfly"" to capture the secret weapon. The director offers his plans to finish the movie, then start on a vampire movie. [Was there a market then? Do they seem clueless? Its in the script.]

If you are looking for action, sci-fi, etc. look elsewhere. It is more of a movie lover's insider's pun than anything genre-wise.

I laughed at much of the satire, and had a great Sunday afternoon distraction. Also, the soundtrack is GREAT!

1742936,4,B00006CXH2,"Sofia Coppola may have got all the kudos with The Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation, but, from a 60s movie buff's point of view, the other Coppola kid, Roman, turned out an even more enjoyable feature, CQ. Shame that no-one saw it. Barely released in the US (and not released at all in most countries), it's an engaging little number that pits underground cinema against Eurotrash moviemaking at a time when people still thought even pulp cinema could be the stuff of revolution (1969-70 to be precise).

A riff on Sullivan's Travels and 8, it sees Jeremy Davies' editor of Franco-Italian co-pro 'Codename: Dragonfly' struggling to come up with a new ending while making his own personal film with borrowed equipment. Oh, and falling in love with the fictional main character, confusing film and reality (not only is he too busy documenting `the truth' of his life to see it around him but he even enters the film to sort out a plot hole) and possibly being targeted for retribution by Gerard Depardieu's fired firebrand director. (The door panel that Depardieu breaks that is later framed and given to the editors is actually one that Francis Ford Coppola smashed on one of his films!)

Filled with sly 60s cinema references from Fellini to Warhol (even the trailer he cuts for the film is inspired by the one for Dr Strangelove) and with some character touches straight out of James Joyce, the visual influence is much more Danger: Diabolik than Barbarella (John Phillip Law even appears in the film within the film), and Dean Tavoularis' spot-on production design and Robert Yeoman's superb photography are both pitch-perfect. Davies, so irritating in Soderbergh's disastrous Solaris, is quietly fine here, Jason  Schwartzman has fun as a bizarre hybrid of a young papa Coppola mixed with Roger Corman via Austin Powers, Giancarlo Giannini does Dino de Laurentiis to a tee (with Sofia Coppola cameoing as his mistress), and there's good work from Dean Stockwell and Massimo Ghini as well. At the end of the day there's not much there, but Coppola's love of moviemaking makes it surprisingly joyful to watch if you're in a receptive mood. And MGM's DVD is filled with extras, both interesting and appropriately self-indulgent.",1142726400,17,2234,4.967914438502674
1742937,3,B00006CXH2,"There are two films within a film in this campy debut from Roman Coppola.  There is the introspective black and white, experimental, ""student"" sort of film that the young director Paul (Jeremy Davies) is making in his Paris apartment, and there is ""Dragonfly,"" a kind of Barbarella (1968) sci-fi space shoot 'em up that he ends up directing.  These might be seen as the twin realities of the young film maker: on the one hand there are those short films you made at USC or UCLA film school to get your degree; on the other, there are those mindless commercial entertainments that Hollywood needs to crank out for the masses.  These represent the bookends of the young director's reality.

The third film, the film that exists over and above these two, is the film that Roman/Paul would like to make, a film about what it is like to be a young film maker amid the crass commercialism of the producers, the seductive lure of the glamor that is the film maker's world, and the daily often tedious work of the actual film making.  In other words, Roman Coppola is self-exploring in public.  He is the novelist as a film maker.

""Dragonfly"" itself is indeed Barbarella without the benefit of Terry Southern's contributions to the script or the services of Jane Fonda.  It is unconsciously campy and a satire on such films.  Model Angela Lindvall, five feet ten and three-quarters inches tall, anorexically thin, and sporting some very serious hair, plays Dragonfly with a kind of Barbie doll intensity.  It is immediately obvious that she has the muscle tone of the languid and the athletic ability of a preteen.  Yet her character is a ""for hire"" secret agent skilled in the martial arts and the use of weapons.  Playing opposite her is Billy Zane as ""Mr. E"" a kind of Che Guevara revolutionary who is absurdly stationed on the far side of the moon where he is training revolutionaries.

In the introspective black and white film, Paul sits on the commode and talks to the camera much to the disdain of his live-in girlfriend Marlene (French actress Elodie Bouchez, best known for her work in the outstanding The Dreamlife of Angels (1998)) who would like him to pay more attention to her.

This might be compared (distantly) with Francois Truffaut's La Nuit Amricaine (Day for Night) from 1973 in which the great French director plays himself making a film--in other words a film within a film.  Jeremy Davies reminds me somewhat of the sensitive, boyish actor Jean-Pierre Leaud, who played in that film after gaining prominence in Truffaut's Les Quatre cents coup (1959).  It is easy to see Truffaut's influence on Roman Coppola, as indeed Truffaut has influenced many directors.

I don't think CQ (""Seek You"") was entirely successful mainly because I don't think Roman made the transition from the self-indulgence and showiness characteristic of the very films he is satirizing to the mature project that addresses itself more directly to the needs of the audience.  There is some fancy camera work with mirrors and characters seen from interesting angles, and some beautifully constructed sets, and some witty dialogue amid some telling satire of filmland people and their world (especially producer Enzo played by Giancarlo Giannini and Dragonfly's idiot second director), but we are never made to care about what happens to any of the characters, this despite the fact that Davies is a very sympathetic actor.

Some of the jokes in the film include the three-day five o'clock shadows on the faces of the young actors.  (That style is almost contemporary--not sixties-ish.)  The hairstyles of the women with the beehives and such hinted of 1969, the year of the main film, but the eye makeup again was more contemporary than sixties-ish since it lacked the very heavy black eyelashes and eye liner that one recalls.  To get it right, Roman should have reviewed, e.g.,  Blow-Up (1966) or Elvira Madigan (1967), films I am sure he has seen.  Another is the view of Paris in the year 2001 as seen from 1970.  It is futuristic in a silly way, and recalls some science fiction that exaggerated the technological changes that would take place.  Orwell's 1984 (from 1948) has not yet arrived, nor has the overpopulated, polluted world from Blade Runner (1982).

Appearing in small roles are Dean Stockwell as Paul's father, and veteran French film star Gerard Depardieu as Dragonfly's original director.

Bottom line: worth seeing if only because it is the first film of the son of Francis Ford Coppola who may yet do something to rival the great works of his father.  By the way, this might also be compared to The Virgin Suicides (2000), his sister Sofia Coppola's first film, just to see who is more likely to best please Dad.

And beyond any earthly explanation, no matter how small his role, anything Billy Zane has been in somehow becomes one of my favorite movies. This film is no exception. Roman, I hope to see your name attached to a lot more writer/director credits in the future. If you were a band I'd buy your t-shirt and put you in heavy rotation on my iPod. (now I just need an iPod...)
Don't think, just buy it.

1742966,5,B00006CXH2,"This movie goes way beyond just the making of a B movie sci fi flick in Paris.  Yes, Roman Coppola's first feature - which is probably why the real content of this film is about a young filmmaker coming of age in life and career - struggling with conflict both personal and professional to produce his art.  Fortunately the sci-fi B movie backdrop is very creative and fun and some may interpret a deeper understanding of 20 year-old-Americans-in-Paris in 1969 which adds to the artsy underground ""revolution"" feeling of film.  Overall a very smart production with unique appeal.",1070496000,,579,4.887755102040816
1742967,4,B00006CXH2,"The creative process should boggle anyone's mind.  I mean if you took one look at the time and energy exerted on one motion picture you'd probably scream.  Sure some movies deserve the time spent on them.  Nobody is going to begrudge the creative team behind 2001: A SPACE ODYESSY or CITIZEN KANE.  But what about the creative team behind HOWARD THE DUCK.  Did not talented people put just as much time and energy into that film?  CG is a film about the creative process thru the director working on a film just a stupid and banal as HOWARD THE DUCK.
It tells the story of a young and talented film editor named Paul (Jeremey Davies, Spanking the Monkey) and his short stint as director on a B grade science fiction film in 1969.  The film about a secret agent named Dragonfly (Anglea Lindvall, New York Stories).  It's Moonraker meets Charles Angels.  This film is directed by a creative visionary named Andrezej (Grard Depardieu, The Closet).  After months of editing the end still needs to be reworked, and Andrezej has been thrown off the picture because his producer (Giancarlo Giannini, Hannibal) he taking for to long to finish.
Andrezej is replaced by a snotty kid named Felix DeMarco (Jason Schwartzman, Rushmore), he's the kind of guy who doesn't deserve to be where he is and everybody knows it.  When tragedy strikes the new director.  Paul is called in to finish the picture.
First time director Roman Coppola, has crafted a disjointed but still overly satisfying film.  Making movies is a game of luck and CQ (The Morse Code phrase for Seek You) has some real moments of brilliance. It's about the lengths money men will go to make a picture, it's about compromise, and it's also about the creative quest to make an audience happy all while keeping yourself from going crazy.
Jeremy Davies is one of the most underused actor's in Hollywood.  He does so well with each and every performance, even if the films suck (See Million Dollar Hotel, for example).  His Paul is both nervous and yet calculated.  He hides in the shadows only to jump out and surprise you.  Like any number of craftsman and artisans he's the real talent and he props up those around him.
I loved how Coppola, counterpoints the silly B movie with Paul's other black and white art film.  Paul is making this drippy and disjointed film at his house.  It's this surreal black and white film that features disjointed takes, and exists for arts sake more than anything else.  Of course it's silly and pretentious, but in the end it's all about creating your own film, and moving on with your life.  Plus it's really an excuse to piss off his live in lover Marlene (Elodie Bouchez, Dreams of Trespas).
Marlene is a good counterpoint to Dragonfly or Valentine whom is the lead in the movie. She's the woman Paul truly lusts after.  Each women stars in one of his movies and you can tell which on he thinks is a hero and which is a villain.  This gives Paul a flawed dimension and these women bring out the two faces of this talented man.
Overall CQ is a tad vague.  I liked it that way; something tells me if I knew what Coppola was truly trying to say it would be quite a letdown.  Thankfully I will take my interpretation and leave it at that.
I also loved the B-picture itself.  It was campy and silly.  Like Austin Powers without the laughs, and tons more style.  Lindvall was the perfect choice for Dragonfly because she looks like a Model in the Sixties.  Like a Breck girl from the 60's. Plus, Billy Zane's (Titanic) small roll as Mr. E, is so goofy and yet so suave you can't help but be pulled in.
CQ is not for everyone and a nominal understanding of the creative process of film will enhance it.  But if you're looking for something a little different, a little out of the ordinary, and a little weird, give CQ a try.

1742968,4,B00006CXH2,"Roman Coppola officially joins his family's business with his directorial debut, CQ. For anyone out there who loves BARBARELLA it's a must-see.
CQ is a valentine to Roger Vadim's fabulous sci-fi/soft-core flick as well as the French New Wave movement. Jeremy Davies stars as Paul Ballard, an aspiring American filmmaker living in Paris with his French girlfriend, Marlene, an Air France stewardess. Paul is working as an editor on a cheesy sci-fi flick called ""Dragonfly"" a collaborative French and Italian production starring a leggy young woman in progressively scantier outfits (sounds familiar?). In his spare time, Paul makes a documentary about himself and his life with Marlene.
The film is about seeing -- how we perceive ourselves and how limited we can be in our vision, even those who are supposed to be masters of a visual medium -- and seeking out love. (The title CQ refers to Morse Code shorthand for ""seek you"".)
The action cuts smoothly between the narrative action in color, Paul's black-and-white footage and ""Dragonfly"" footage also in color. The costumes and particularly the soundtrack are both fantastic, helping to set the mood and establish the time period.
The strong supporting cast includes Gerard Depardieu as ""Dragonfly""'s director, Coppola's cousin Jason Schwartzman as a buffoonish Eurotrash wunderkind director, Billy Zane as a ""space-age"" Che Guevara figure in green satin fatigues living with his rebels the moon, and model Angela Lindvall as Dragonfly. An added bonus is John Philip Law as The Chairman of the organization that hires Dragonfly for her mission; Law played the angel Pygar in BARBARELLA.
The sum is not quite equal to its parts, and it is not as strong a debut as sister Sofia's THE VIRGIN SUICIDES but it remains interesting throughout",1064448000,2,1787,5.165517241379311
1742969,1,B00006CXH2,"As someone who has enjoyed In Like Flint and Barbarella and other movies of the era, I thought this movie would be along the same lines.  After watching CQ I found out it couldn't have been farther from the truth.  The movie within the movie was interesting and would have made the movie more enjoyable if it was done better.  The ""Secret Agent"" part of the movie would have made a great ""B"" movie if it was more than just a short portion of the film.  However the ""real"" part of the movie left a lot to be desired.",1062979200,4,515,4.171717171717172

7967307,5,B00006CXH2,"This is an excellent movie (IMHO) that appears to have slipped under the radar.

The recollections of a young, aspiring filmmaker working as an editor on a French-Italian science-fiction flick in 1969-1970, ""CQ"" is part homage to the tradition of reflexive films (where the film is about the making of a film), part nostalgic reverie for late 60s aesthetics of science fiction (""Barbarella"" being the obvious source material), part coming-of-age narrative, and part love story.  Such a film might easily get bogged down in pretentious twaddle but ""CQ"" is irreverent and whimsical enough to avoid this despite connections to far ""weightier"" films.  There are Criterion films I don't like nearly as well - it is easily among my top 100 favorites.",1447718400,,744,5.132231404958677
7967308,4,B00006CXH2,"CQ is the quirky, entertaining writing and directorial debut of Roman Coppola, son of the famous Godfather auteur Francis Ford Coppola. Starring Jeremy Davies (Saving Private Ryan) as Paul Ballard, an introverted but determined American film director working in 1969 Paris, the film masterfully cuts between the surreal world of late 1960s Europe, the wild speculation of the B-grade sci-fi/spy movie that Davies is working to complete, and the introspective documentary that is Paul's passion project.
CQ has great performances by Elodie Bouchez as Paul's exasperated French girlfriend, Giancarlo Giannini as Enzo, the film's larger than life producer, and Angela Lindvall as Valentine, the inexperienced but luminous American who is the star of the sci-fi film as Codename: Dragonfly.  Although its' plot is light as a croissant, CQ really captures the setting and mood of what being an expat American in that time must have been like. The excellent soundtrack by the French electopop group Mellow really adds to the exercise. Overall, this is a fun film that leaves you wanting to know what happens next to Paul, Valentine and all the rest of the cast.",1441152000,,1155,5.209677419354839
