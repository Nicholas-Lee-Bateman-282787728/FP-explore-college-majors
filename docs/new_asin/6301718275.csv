348447,4,6301718275,"""Blood Alley"" is a big, sprawling, grandly mounted and sumptuously photographed adventure story starring John Wayne and Lauren Bacall that tells the tale of a merchant sea captain (Wayne) who has had his freighter stopped and boarded illegally in international waters by the Red Chinese, and who has been imprisoned by them for some time since. A village downriver from the prison where Wayne has been kept antes up a bribe to the prison guards and gets Wayne sprung. Taken downriver by his ""contact"", big Mike Mazurski made up to look oriental, Duke is informed that the entire village wants to escape to Hong Kong and they want him, Duke, to captain them all down the Formosa Straits (""Blood Alley"") to Hong Kong and freedom...and they want this to be done on a leaky, creaky, pokey-slow and prone-to-breakdown stern-wheeled ferryboat. With no charts.

  Wayne mulls this and decides he has no choice in the matter. He makes a homemade chart from memory and sets about to put the escape plan in motion, taking everyone with him, including the headstrong daughter (Bacall) of a medical missionary, and an entire family of loyal communists who can't be left behind because their masters would kill them as ""responsible"" for this flight.

  Down the straits goes the ferry boat, dodging commie gunboats day and night and slipping into forests of reeds for camouflage when their pursuers draw too near.

  The telling of the story of this journey is so well done that the viewer tends to be detoured away from the story's great glaring logical pothole. This escape is set in the mid-1950s and NOT the EIGHTEEN fifties. Decades earlier it COULD have happened the way it is shown, but NOT in its supposed time period. The reason? Airplanes. In the mid-1950s Communist Chinese forces would have aircraft up and down the Formosa Straits LOOKING for this ferry and they WOULD find it. Yet there is never a mention of aircraft here and no aircraft ever shows up anywhere in the movie. Its almost as though there is no such thing as a search plane in existance...or any kind of plane at all!!!

  Very Strange. Yet, it is only later that you realize this. Throughout the film the movie-makers keep you so involved with the dangers and rigors of the journey that you don't even THINK about planes while you're watching it. Very clever diversion.

  There is good chemistry with Wayne and Bacall and they go through the typical ""difficult"" time with each other before becoming hard-breathers as they enter Hong Kong Harbour together.

  Aside from some minor silliness (Duke perpetually talks to an ""imaginary friend"" named ""Baby""....which happened to be Bogart's pet name for Bacall) and the aforementioned mysteriously missing aircraft, this William Wellman-directed story hangs together well and delivers the goods on excitement and interest.

  Good movie overall.

  Now...WHEN are they EVER going to release one of Wayne's all time masterpieces? WHEN are we EVER going to see ""The High And The Mighty""???????",1116028800,17,3003,4.94810379241517
348448,4,6301718275,"First off, you can't beat the Duke in just about any movie. Blood Alley and The Sea Chase were a departure from his typical westerns and WWII movies, but he handled them in his true dominating fashion.

Now, I noticed that in other reviews, there was some discussion about how many movies John Wayne died in. Let me give you the complete list of those from 1939 onward. I don't know how many he may have died in during the 1930s, if any, because I haven't seen that many of his B westerns.

1. The Shootist (1976)

2. The Cowboys (1972)

3. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). He is dead at the start of the movie, and the entire story is told in a flashback.

4. The Alamo (1960)

Powder your nose, baby, the craggy-voiced skipper bellows. Were coming into Hong Kong. Getting there wasn't easy for wily Merchant Marine Capt. Tom Wilder. But its exciting  and what an action fan might expect from a movie teaming legends John Wayne, Lauren Bacall and director William A. Wellman. Merchant Marine Capt. Tom Wilder braves dangerous waters and pursuing Red Chinese forces while steering a boatload of Chinese refugees and a doctors daughter Cathy Grainger [Lauren Bacall] along a 300-mile waterway to freedoms shores. Director William A. Wellman and his crew cram the CinemaScope frame with riches both scenic (Northern California locales authentically stand in for the Formosa Straits) and action-packed.

FILM FACT No. 1: Awards and Nominations: 1956: Golden Globes: Win: Most Promising Female Newcomer for Anita Ekberg.

FILM FACT No. 2: The screenplay for the film was written by Albert Sidney Fleischman, based on his novel, and was produced by John Wayne's BATJAC Productions Company. Location filming took place in and near China Camp, a shrimp fishing village in the San Francisco Bay. Additional filming occurred at Point Orient shrimp camp, which is located on Point San Pablo, where the film crew was largely based in what is now known as Point San Pablo Yacht Harbor. The Chinese Communist soldiers who search the village are armed with the 3-line Model 1891 MosinNagant rifle (probably ex-U.S. Rifle, 7.62 mm, Model of 1916 rifles) rather than the more appropriate Model 91/30s the Communists would have carried, having been exported to Mao's army during the Chinese Civil War. The Communist patrol boat that the villagers are trapped on the artificial reef was actually a rescue boat on loan to the film company by the U.S. Air Force.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: BLOOD ALLEY [1955] was the first film to be made by John Wayne's BATJAC Productions Company and the film is one of John Waynes most politically propagandistic films of the 1950s, and is based on A.S. Fleischmans novel, and directed by William A. Wellman. On the surface, the film is about the escape of the Chiku Shan village in Red China to freedom in Hong Kong, and is a quintessentially a John Wayne action-adventure film.

The CinemaScope format was in common format used in the classic era of cinema for filming that were to be released in widescreen. This method of filming was known as the anamorphic lens series which first came to life in 1953 when Spyros P. Skouras, the president of Twentieth Century Fox, marked the beginning of the modern anamorphic format in both principal photography and movie projection. These anamorphic lenses allowed the process to create an image of up to 2.66.1 aspect ratio, which was almost twice as wide as the Academy formats 1.37.1 aspect ratio. By 1967, CinemaScope was in decline. There has been an array of films being shot in CinemaScope during the years. Some of these films being crowned as some of the most memorable the world have known. Almost every star from the fifties and sixties has appeared in a CinemaScope production. But some studios started abandoning the CinemaScope format in previous years, but by now even 20th Century Fox had started to use the new format known as Panavision, which had a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.

The 1955 film BLOOD ALLEY was shot in CinemaScope, which was directed by William A. Wellman, and stars Lauren Bacall and John Wayne. The film was shot in glorious WarnerColor, with China Camp, a fishing village situated on the San Francisco Bay serving as the location. Written by Albert Sidney Fleischman, and based on his novel, the film opened to critical reception, and was a moderate success, but as the years progressed, it is now hailed as one of the finest CinemaScope presentations.

The plot of BLOOD ALLEY centres on the story of Merchant Marine Capt. Tom Wilder [John Wayne], who is seized by the Chinese Communists, and is sentenced to many years in prison. On his release, and Merchant Marine Capt. Tom Wilder is recruited to transport the people of Chiku Shan Village in Red China in a small sternwheeler Ferry Boat steamer to safety in Hong Kong. With efficient memory of the coast, and the help of a hand drawn chart, he is able to navigate successfully. At the village, Merchant Marine Capt. Tom Wilder is met by Cathy Grainger [Lauren Bacall], a strong and obstinate young woman whose father is a medical missionary.  When Dr. Grainger is murdered by the Reds after a fallacious error on an operation he was performing, Merchant Marine Capt. Tom Wilder is forced to break the news of her fathers death to Cathy Grainger before they are set to escape from Chiku Shan, which Cathy Grainger does not believe and in the process is totally selfish and nearly causes a disaster on her return to the Ferry Boat steamer.

On their journey via the ancient Ferry Boat steamer to Hong Kong, they encounter a plethora of problems. Cathy Grainger doesnt believe that her father is dead, and is persistent about getting off the boat at the Graveyard of Ships at Honghai Bay to find the whereabouts of her Cathy Graingers father. Tom Wilder is adamant by annunciating that nobody leaves the boat, but Cathy Grainger demands that he grants her permission to exit the vessel, which results in several altercations along the way.

Further down the river they are trapped in even more obstacles. First they pass the Peoples Liberation Army Navy destroyer that has not yet learnt about their escape. Then they discover that all their food has been poisoned by thugs on board the Ferry Boat steamer, leaving them with a diminutive quantity of food and water. Later the same people try to take the ship during a storm, but fails at their first attempt. Ever since they first met, Merchant Marine Capt. Tom Wilder has been interested in Cathy Grainger, but doesnt pursue any relationship. It is not until they are in the midst of the ferocious storm that Cathy Grainger comes to terms with her passionate feelings for Merchant Marine Capt. Tom Wilder. One of the most dramatic scene we get to view is that the Ferry Boat steamer is a massive hurricane storm that nearly destroys the Ferry Boat steamer, but of course as always with these Hollywood films, things eventually calms down, but again the hurricane storm scene is so realistic and also the damage to the internal part of the Ferry Boat steamer, so making you feel part of the action with such dramatic effects, makes you nearly go green around the gills, meaning (of a person) looking or feeling very ill or nauseous.

This is the first of two films that Lauren Bacall appeared in with John Wayne, and while it is not one of Lauren Bacalls most honourable roles, and one that showed her true acting ability, against the Right Wing Republican John Wayne and of course Lauren Bacall delivered a very commendable performance in her fine portrayal of Cathy Grainger, the doctors daughter and a sort of love interest for Merchant Marine Capt. Tom Wilder. Sadly Lauren Bacall doesnt get enough credit for her commendable presentation in the film, and is often overlooked and dismissed by many who think Lauren Bacall was miscast, but that is not true. Lauren Bacall was definitely first rate in everything this superb actress has done. John Wayne also had his moments in the film, and adds some sort of humour to his character which makes the film rather comical at certain intervals, but one thing that really annoyed and grated on me was when John Wayne kept looking up at the ceiling and keep on talking to a fictitious female he calls BABY.

What really makes this film exceptional are the settings and the great cinematography, which showcases vivid scenes of the Chinese coast, especially being substituted in having been filmed in the San Francisco Bay. A 1955 review in the New York Times praised William A. Wellman for his direction. But in filming his story at China Camp in San Rafael, near San Francisco, and in San Francisco Bay, and William A. Wellman appears to have approximated, in flavour at least, the authentic hillside Chinese location as well as the reedy shores and choppy waters of the Formosa Strait. And William A. Wellman has added to that flavour of the film by employing scores of Chinese-Americans as realistic extras. The stunningly composed landscapes that are bathed in ravishing WarnerColor and lovingly splashed across the CinemaScope screen, is well worth viewing in themselves, especially in the capable and professional hands of auteur William H. Clothier (Director of Photography).

TRIVA INFO No. 1: Robert Mitchum was originally cast as Merchant Marine Capt. Tom Wilder and was fired from the film after an altercation in which he shoved the films transportation manager into the San Francisco Bay. Director William A. Wellman complained to John Wayne that the star was on dope, always walking about six inches off the ground. Director William A. Wellman said either he or Robert Mitchum had to go. Gregory Peck subsequently turned down the role of Merchant Marine Capt. Tom Wilder, and Humphrey Bogart wanted a $500,000 salary, which would have put the film over budget. Without a major male star involved, Warner Bros. contacted producer John Wayne, threatening to pull out of their distribution deal for the film unless he took the role himself. To keep his new production company Batjac afloat, John Wayne agreed to play Merchant Marine Capt. Tom Wilder. There was some surprise when Lauren Bacall agreed to make the film since she was a left-wing Democrat and the film was right-wing Cold War propaganda.

TRIVA INFO No. 2: In an interview Lauren Bacall said that she took the role when Robert Mitchum was to be the male lead. When John Wayne took the role after Robert Mitchum was fired Lauren Bacall expected to clash with him since Lauren Bacall was a left-wing Liberal and John Wayne was a right- wing Conservative. Lauren Bacall said that he was warm and friendly and they did not discuss politics and Lauren Bacall later starred with him again in his last film The Shootist [1976]. Lauren Bacall related in her autobiography that gossip columnist Hedda Hopper had, for some reason, campaigned to keep John Wayne from hiring her for in BLOOD ALLEY. Lauren Bacall had given Hedda Hopper the cold shoulder after that until a party where Clifton Webb corralled the two of them and insisted that they make up. Bacall, who had been drinking martinis, told Hopper she'd been ""a bitch to try and keep me from working."" Hedda Hopper agreed and suggested that, to even the score, Lauren Bacall l should give her a good kicking. ""Whereupon she turned around and I kicked her in the ass  most unladylike, but very martini-like,"" Lauren Bacall wrote. ""Whereupon everyone laughed out loudly and a truce was declared.""

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Archive Collection has once again brought us a stunning 1080p WarnerColor image presentation and equally impressive is the 2.55:1 CinemaScope aspect ratio for added spectacular visual enjoyment, and showing off the film in the best way possible and it looks spectacular and despite being filmed in the so called Formosa Straits, which of course was filmed in the Northern California location to authentically stand in for so called China landscape that looks really fantastic and totally excellent, especially viewing the great fine grain of a WarnerColor visual experience for a film that was released in 1955. But most important there is a generous amount of nice saturate colours, which includes some very nice splendid primary reds, greens, and blues. Never too intense, and the WarnerColor is very accurate for the flesh tones. As far as I can see there I did not notice any visible signs of age-related wear and tear, so all in all this is an all-around terrific looking visual transfer and is another big winner for another Warner Archive Collection Blu-ray disc release.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Archive Collection have sadly only been able provided a 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo experience, which of course was the only sound recording available when the film was released in 1955, compared to what is available today and handles it very well, despite the age of the film. Dialogue is really clear and carries surprisingly very well and articulate at most points in the film and highly responsive to the environments throughout the film. The music score by composer Roy Webb is robust and handles the ambient sounds rather well. So all in all Warner Archive Collection has done a really splendid job overall.

Blu-ray Special features and Extras:

Special Feature: Warner Path Newsreel Footage [480i] [1.37:1] [3:56] Here we a get to view four individual Warner Path Newsreel footage [unknown date], which are as follows:

01. Hollywood Foreign Press Awards in Santa Monica, California: Title card: FOREIGN PRESS ASSN. AWRADS HENRIETTAS superimposed over awards ceremony attendees seated at tables and applauding at the Club Del Mar in Santa Monica, and actor Vincent Price stands at table with several Henrietta statuettes. Vincent Price and Gene Wilson award it to actor Dick Wesson for an international stardom award and are seen being handed the statuette, and Vincent Price and Gene Wilson attendees applaud. Actor William Holden presents Susan Hayward with a Henrietta for most popular motion picture actress; both smile as she takes it and attendees applaud. Actress Greer Garson presents John Wayne with the most popular motion picture actor with a Henrietta. Male and female photographers are seen taking photos and John Wayne smiles as he holds his Henrietta as Greer Garson looks on.

02. CRUSADE FOR FREEDOM: Here we get to see the actor John Wayne making a speech apparently during production on Operation Pacific which we see co-star Patricia Neal is in costume. Unfortunately you get several intermitted no sound happening, very strange. The Crusade for Freedom was an American propaganda campaign operating from 1950  1960. Its public goal was to raise funds for Radio Free Europe; it also served to conceal the CIA's funding of Radio Free Europe and to generate domestic support for American Cold War policies.

03. JOHN WAYNE BEGINS LEGION POPPY SALE: Here we get to see John Wayne smiling and enjoying himself promoting the sale of the said poppies and two old unknown ladies were roped in for this little promotion. For some unknown reason this is completely without sound.

04. AIR FORCE HONORS CAST OF BLOOD ALLEY: Here we get to see quite a bit of behind-the-scene filming of BLOOD ALLEY, that mainly consisted of scenes on the ancient Ferry Boat steamer. We also get to view clips from the film BLOOD ALLEY. We also get to see John Wayne taking the oath for the The United States Air Force Recruiter Service to Cast & Crew of BLOOD ALLEY. Sadly we are not given a lot of detail about this event.

Special Feature: Warner Brothers Presents: Promo on BLOOD ALLEY [#1] [1955] [1080i] [1.78:1] [7:30] ""My dad was a great man, but he wasn't a rich man,"" Marion Mitchell Morrison (aka John Wayne) laments to host Gig Young in the first of two appearances on this show to promote his film BLOOD ALLEY that also co-starred Lauren Bacall and we are shown several clips from the film, but unfortunately the image has been enlarged to the 1.78:1 aspect ratio and so certain scenes lose their impact. Gig Young asks John Wayne how did get the idea for the film BLOOD ALLEY, so John Wayne hands Gig Young a piece of paper, that he has to read out and was a copy of a news wire message that read, HONG KONG BULLETIN [AGP]      AN ENTIRE VILLAGE HAS VANISHED FROM THE COAST OF RED CHINA. ACCORDING TO AN UNCONFIRMED REPORT REACHING HERE TODAY. IN WHAT MAY BE THE MOST DARING MASS ESCAPE OF MODERN TIMES and here John Wayne tells Gig Young that this was a four line news dispatch, which was hot off the news wire and from this John Wayne and his BATJAC Productions Company was able with the help of director William A. Wellman kick start the making of the film BLOOD ALLEY. John Wayne also discloses that at one time his dad was in business driving a horse-drawn ice cream wagon and further reveals that the actor Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., was his boyhood screen idol. John Wayne also informs us that first job on a Hollywood movie set was less than glamorous job in Tinsel town, where director Jack Ford had hired John Wayne to toss leaves via a big fan so that they ""flew"" onto the actors in a film scene set in the Bavarian Autumn season. John Wayne also discloses that Hollywood had once tried to cast him as a singing cowboy, but that also did not work out, since John Wayne did not have many musical bones in his body; even his ""Whistling Dan"" character in THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY had to have his tunes ""looped in"" by an off-screen lip-purser, so much for so called glamorous side of Hollywood.

Special Feature: Warner Brothers Presents: Promo on BLOOD ALLEY [#2] [1955] [1080i] [1.78:1] [7:40] This second Warner Bros. Promos presentation for BLOOD ALLEY and is a much more technical aspect than the first. Here once again Gig Young introduces himself in a different location and before he introduces John Wayne again he introduces ""The Monster of Movieland,"" which is in fact a 35mm Mitchell BNC-R type Camera that was used to film BLOOD ALLEY. But with this second Warner Bros. Promos presentation it focused primarily on host Gig Young shooting the breeze once again with BLOOD ALLEY star John Wayne. Here we get to see John Wayne talking to Gig Young about the 35mm Mitchell BNC-R type Camera that filmed BLOOD ALLEY in ""Cinemascope"" and explaining the squeezed film process of this widescreen format when filming and then when the film is shown in the cinema. Next John Wayne has set up his home projector to show rare behind-the-scene filming of BLOOD ALLEY, which he informs us that this his habit of always taking ""home movies"" and shows us the actual much smaller hand-held camera that he films on the movie sets and what scenes we see being projected also gives John Wayne an opportunity to display some background footage of their BLOOD ALLEY film set of so called ""China"" that we view on the small projector screen, and John Wayne especially talking about how they went about building the sets to look like China, which in fact was substitute for the Richard Bay area near San Francisco. Anyway, all in all both these Warner Brothers  specials with John Wayne and Gig Young are quite rare and I enjoyed watching them, as it gave another side of John Waynes private personality in a much more relaxed situation.

Theatrical Trailer [1955] [1080i] [2.55:1] [2:36] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film BLOOD ALLEY. They proclaim . . . Where the SEAS RUN RED with DANGER! It also proclaims, The Stormiest Romance, Two People Ever Had! Adventure Thats High, Wide and Mighty! Despite the quality is not as good as the film, it is still a brilliant presentation that certainly gives you a flavour of what you will view when you watch the film.

Finally, BLOOD ALLEY [1955] is a much underrated film, and deserves more accolades than what it has achieved during the years. Its a highly entertaining film that offers a conglomeration of action, suspense and romance. What really makes this film exceptional are the settings and the great cinematography, which showcases vivid scenes of the Chinese coast which was substituted by having been filmed in San Francisco Bay. A 1955 review in the New York Times praised William Wellman for his direction. But in filming his story at China Camp in San Rafael, near San Francisco, and in San Francisco Bay, Wellman appears to have approximated, in flavour at least, the authentic hilly Chinese locales as well as the reedy shores and choppy waters of the Formosa Strait. And he has added to that flavour by employing scores of Chinese-Americans as realistic extras.' The stunningly composed landscapes that are bathed in ravishing WarnerColor and is splashed across the epic CinemaScope aspect ratio screen, is well worth viewing. Highly Recommended!

He is joined by Lauren Bacall who, though somewhat underused, is a welcome addition to the cast and has nice chemistry with Wayne.  There are some action and adventure aspects to the film as well some nice emotive moments that tug at the heart strings a bit, particularly when the boat finally departs the refugees home and we see their reactions to leaving.  The blu-ray quality is quite nice - a big improvement over the DVD version which I've owned for years.  The image is sharp and the colors faithful.  Overall it looks great!

The Blu-ray disc looks amazing and sounds great. A huge upgrade from the DVD. Being an early CinemaScope film, and having been shot in Warner Color, his is a difficult task to achieve, but Warner has done so with their usual excellence. I ordered my copy early to get a lower price than what Amazon was offering (although the price is now lower here, too), and I had the pleasure of watching it last night. It looked so good, I wanted to watch it again. However I'm posting a review here to let people know this is a great-looking Blu-ray, as another post here indicates a disc quality deficiency that I find astoundingly unjust. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but don't just take my word for it. I recommend one also look at reviews on review sites such as the Home Theater Forum (praise from famed film restoration expert Robert Harris) and DVD Talk (another great review from their 'dvdsavant' - Glenn Erickson)  in order to see what others have to say about this excellent Blu-ray remaster.

Lauren Bacall plays a tough lady, the daughter of an alcoholic missionary doctor, who is still sexy in a remote unreachable sort of way, until she finally gives it up for the Duke at the end. This film was produced by the Duke's BatJac film company.  The Duke plays a ship captain imprisoned by the Chinese Communist regime, who in one of the movie's first scenes, is broken out of prison by Chinese republican villagers from a small town along the Yangtze River. Their quest is simple pilot their stolen steam-driven paddleboat 500 miles to safety in British held Hong Kong.",1481328000,,716,4.59375

349201,4,6301718275,"It's the Duke! How could it not be good?  It's a good story about a time when American society was constantly worried about having ""lost"" China to the ""communist horde"". It fits the narrative we carried around in our heads - how our American merchant sailor hero did a great thing. It's why people of a certain age still have the effrontery (in the minds of elites) to think that there is such a thing as ""American exceptionalism"". I have to admit the ""Baby"" thing got a bit old, but the rest of it is fun and it holds your interest. Good cast, Bacall was truly a beautiful heroine. Highly recommend it as a fun alternative to seeing another silly vampire fantasy or political message dressed up as a cartoon, and very little gratuitous blood is splashed about despite the title of the film. How the villagers dealt with the commie patrol boat makes it worth watching all by itself. Sure it's dated, but you wouldn't mind having your kids watch it with you, and it's so much better than what passes for large (or small) screen drama these days.",1416009600,,1044,4.494736842105263

It's a post-war story of an American tramp steamer captain imprisoned by the Red Chinese whose prison escape is arranged by an entire village who wish to shanghai a local ferryboat and wish John Wayne to captain it down the coast to Hong Kong (at that time a British crown colony).  The trials of avoiding the Chinese navy, local Communist villagers, and the simple agony of taking a freshwater riverboat to sea all make for a great movie.  In addition, Lauren Bacall plays the part of a missionary doctor's daughter who becomes Wayne's counterfoil and romantic lead.  All in all, it's a fun movie that the whole family may watch together without fear of nudity or profanity; interesting plot, good writing, excellent direction (William Wellman) and a strong cast.

349643,5,6301718275,"This is one of my favorite John Wayne films and is certainly a change of pace from the westerns and war films he was best known for. In this film, Wayne plays a China sea captain who has been freed from communist imprisonment in order to sail an entire village to Hong Kong - and freedom.

Wayne's character, a slightly batty but tough and experienced captain, is asked by the elders of a coastal Chinese village to navigate and sail a steam-powered, paddle-wheeler ferry boat hundreds of miles down the China coast, dodging the communist navy all the way, to the freedom of Hong Kong. His cargo? The entire population of the village.

This is a well-directed and acted film. Wayne and co-star Lauren Bacall both give fine performances and it's interesting to see Wayne a little more vulnerable that in most of his roles. Bacall's performance is excellent as the daughter of an alcoholic doctor who has lived in China since childhood. Her screen presence alone is worth the watch! There are a number of veteran supporting actors in this film that give their usual fine performances. The color and cinematography are excellent and the film is visually stunning.

This is an excellent film that focuses on the desire of a people to be free and the sacrifices they are willing to make to attain that goal. A fine film that is more than deserving of five stars!",1375574400,2,1357,4.669456066945607

How about with the Phillipino/Japanese/Hawaiian/Mexican actors hired to ""play chinese"" (what's the difference, they all look alike, right--ugh)? Or, (and this had me laughing out loud every time I saw him)---the actor Paul Fix as a Chinese man (6' 7"", caucasian former pro boxer from the bronx)---they didn't even TRY to tone down his New York accent....A TERRIBLE script (can't believe most of this hasn't ended up on YouTube)....total lack of chemisty between John Wayne and Lauren Bacall (not to mention a completely unbelievable portrayal of Bacall, looking like a 5th Avenue doll, who has supposedly been holed up in Communist China for 10 years)...HILARIOUS miniatures (the ones of the boat look like Wellman shot pictures of one of his kids' toy boats--while it was in the tub)....After viewing this (and ""The High and the Mighty"") I finally understand why Wellman quit directing only a few years after this movie was made (though he lived for 20 more years)...he really was a less-than-stellar director ( although ""Island in the Sky"" was probably his best--along with ""Wings""--though even in the former film, the viewer can see too many obvious visual errors a good director simply shouldn't make). ----This film is just a hilarious mess....and a waste of the talent of John Wayne....In a word: Drivel.................",1368057600,4,1563,5.181818181818182

349793,2,6301718275,"Pairing screen legends Wayne and Bacall sounds like the recipe for a must-see movie, but this adventure film lacks gusto and merely plods along amiably and predictably. Other reviewers have pointed out plot problems, and between the by-the-numbers screenplay and William Wellman's competent but mostly unimaginative direction, there's little tension, no strong characters, and no memorable dialogue. Thank goodness the two stars had their innate screen presence to help keep this film from sinking outright; that said, there's no chemistry between Wayne and Bacall. For that matter, Bacall is woefully underutilized here. Other problems: Westerners cast in Chinese roles and lame attempts at Pidgin Chinese humor. Some decent production design, albeit rather too studio-bound.

Wayne, Bacall, and Wellman all did much better work.",1339372800,,830,5.747967479674797
349794,4,6301718275,"John Wayne, Mike Mazurki and Lauren Bacall, in that order of importance, provide a couple of hours of entertainment in this film made very shortly after an armistice had been agreed to that stopped Americans and Chinese soldiers from slaughtering each other in Korea. With the excision of very few words and a few minutes film, the production could play in Mainland China today without offending anybody, even the censors. Mostly it is Wayne providing the expertise to allow the Noble Chinese political deviants to escape from the implicitly terrible Communist Chinese. With few other changes, it could be Bogart and Hepburn, or Wayne and Claire Trevor, fleeing the Germans or the American Indians (Native Americans). Given the lack of much uncertainty as to what the Wayne character would be doing, William Wellman and his stars did a good job with what was written for them, so that  reality had little chance to mar this fictional tale of a brave ship captain, his equally heroic lady friend-to-be, and the strong man of the Chinese community (Mike Mazurki), and how he managed to maneuver a rotten old ferryboat, with the population of a small village on it, from Communist dominated China to free Hong Kong.
A footnote to the history of the film: Robert Mitchum had been playing the ships captain but was fired for self-indulgent behavior that interfered with production. After other choices proved unavailable or too costly, Wayne, owner of the production stepped into the Captain's role.

I recently bought the DVD and was apprehensive about it not living up to my memory of it. It was actually better than I remembered it. I am also surprised at how many people seem to share my opinion. I thought this movie was far less well known and appreciated than it seems to be.

However, I think some people miss why it is such a good movie. Yes, it is a John Wayne movie and the narration follows his character throughout, however, the real star of the movie is the Chinese village. The villagers are the ones who plan and execute the ingenious escape from Red China. Wayne is just a hired hand; hired to accomplish one of the necessary tasks; and not a very enthusiastic hand at that.

The real story is about the patience, ingenuity, dedication, sacrifice, and determination of the village to accomplish their escape. Although the scenes featuring Wayne and Bacall appear as if they are the main thrust of the story, they are actually, for the most part, just interludes in the real story; which is of the progress of the villagers' plan.

I think this is the key to why this movie holds up so well after many viewings and after 30 years. It would have been a fine movie even without the Hollywood stars. Adding Wayne and Bacall was just the iceing on the cake.",1236124800,4,1367,4.395256916996048

The scenes between Lauren Bacall and Wayne show zero chemistry.  Frankly, much as I love Bacall's early films, she never quite made the transition from alluring ingenue to fully adult actress.  This film is Exhibit A as to why her career never made it to the heights it might have.  I don't think Wayne's conversations with the invisible ""Baby"" work either.  They are annoying and don't add anything to the film.  Finally, I have no political objection to using Caucasian actors to play Asian parts.  In this case, though, using such familiar faces as Paul Fix to play the Chinese villagers is a major distraction and detracts from the realism of the film.  So, unless you are determined to watch every film the Duke made, I would say not to waste your time with this one when there are so many better films to watch.",1217030400,5,984,4.386740331491713
349875,4,6301718275,"BLOOD ALLEY (directed in 1955 by William A. Wellman and produced by John Wayne's film company Batjac) is one of the more unusual John Wayne adventures of the period.  Set in Communist-run China, Wayne plays Tom Wilder, a sea captain assigned the task of taking a boatload of Chinese refugees to the safety of the Hong Kong harbour.  To do so he must guide the boat down the dangerous 300-mile waterway known as 'Blood Alley'...

Also along for the ride is Lauren Bacall.  She provides a much-welcome presence as Cathy Grainger, the daughter of a local doctor who has been murdered by the Communist regime.  The cast also includes familiar Batjac personalities Joy Kim (""The High and the Mighty""), Anita Ekberg (""Man in the Vault""), Paul Fix and Barry Kroeger.

Although John Wayne's Batjac production company bankrolled the film, Robert Mitchum was originally-cast in the role of Captain Wilder; but he was later fired following a violent on-set incident.  Both Gregory Peck and Humphrey Bogart (Bacall's real-life husband) were considered until it became necessary for John Wayne himself to step into the role.

Released hot on the heels of the previous years' John Wayne/William A. Wellman collaboration ""The High and the Mighty"" (1954), BLOOD ALLEY did very well at the box office, earning great notices for it's stars Wayne and Lauren Bacall.  The timely political theme of the story had a lot to do with it's resonance with film audiences of the period.  Today, we can still enjoy BLOOD ALLEY for it's tense action scenes, stunning CinemaScope photography and the memorable chemistry of Wayne and Bacall (they were later reunited in 1976 for ""The Shootist"").  Highly-recommended.

349876,4,6301718275,"In the 1950s, patriotic, conservative actor John Wayne joined the bandwagon of those who believed that Communism was a serious threat to the U.S.  These were the days of the cold war and McCarthyism.  While some, such as Senator McCarthy, used the ""Red Scare"" for political purposes, there were those, such as Wayne, who were sincerely concerned about Communist threats.  Historians are still debating whether the threats were real or not.  It didn't matter to John Wayne or studio head Jack Warner, who agreed to make a series of films dealing with the perceived dangers of Communism.

Some of the anti-communist films Wayne made for Warner Brothers, such as ""Big Jim McLain,"" seem very dated and even silly at times, but ""Blood Alley"" remains a good action adventure film with some real twists.  Wayne again worked with veteran director ""Wild Bill"" Wellman, who had directed one of Wayne's most popular films, ""The High and The Mighty,"" the previous year (1954).  Wellman, who had directed the first film to win a Best Picture Oscar way back in 1927, ""Wings,"" was nearing the end of his career.  Although Wellman's energies were clearly diminishing, he still managed to put some exciting touches into the film, along with charm and humor, as he depicted how Wayne led a group of Chinese villagers to freedom on a battered, aging ferryboat, from the People's Republic of China to Hong Kong (then still a British crown colony).

Wayne was paired for the first time with Lauren Bacall, who was then married to the legendary Humphrey Bogart.  (Years later, they again worked together in John Wayne's final film, ""The Shootist."")  While the romantic elements are shaky in the film, they clearly worked well together.  Bacall often played strong, determined women and this is one of her better performances.  Wayne and Bacall were joined by a mostly Chinese cast, along with an emerging young actress named Anita Ekberg, who would later achieve some notoriety in her famous wading scene in ""La Dolce Vita.""  Try and spot Ekberg in the film; she is heavily made-up as a Chinese villager.  Another non-Chinese actor in the film is beefy Mike Mazurki, who often played heavies or sidekicks in films; this is one of Mike's more likeable characters, as he assists Wayne on the ferryboat.

Of all of Wayne's anticommunist films, ""Blood Alley"" is probably the best because it is entertaining and exciting.  Underscoring the action is a very enchanting musical score by Roy Webb, who benefited from the excellent Warner Brothers studio orchestra.",1181692800,2,2534,4.980997624703088

All that has kept him sane and unbrainwashed is his imaginary companion, ""Baby,"" to whom he talks throughout the film.  Without warning he gets a mysterious note advising him on escape.  Provided with a Russian uniform and a handgun, he slips out of the prison and is ferried by sampan to the village of Chiku Shan, whose people, led by elder Mr. Tso (Paul Fix) and their American friend Cathy Grainger (Lauren Bacall), daughter of a doctor who has recently been shanghaied off to treat an important commissar, have made up their collective mind to defect en masse to Hong Kong, 300 miles away via the Formosa Straits, known to seamen as ""Blood Alley.""  What's more, they have a plan: hijack an ancient sternwheel ferryboat (on which Tso's nephew, the American-trained Tack (Henry Nakamura), is Chief Engineer) that plies the straits to Amoy.  But, with no charts, they need a captain/navigator, and that's where Wilder comes in.

The creativity with which Wilder and the villagers carry out their program is perhaps the best part of the film.  (Watch for the way they trap and cripple the local patrol gunboat to give themselves time to get away.)  But even before they set out, there's peril from the Reds (a detachment of their soldiers searches the village for Wilder, who bayonets a straggler when he attempts to assault Cathy) and the necessity of working out from memory a crude chart of the course the boat will have to follow (which Wilder does on the back of one of Dr. Grainger's anatomical charts, furnished by Cathy's maid SuSu (Joy Kim)).  There's also the issue of the Fengs, the local collaborationist family, who have to be taken along because the Reds would blame them for the escape of the village and probably kill them all--""even the little ones.""  The ferry herself--an 1885-vintage craft manufactured in Sacramento and named after their abandoned home by the villagers--is almost as much a character as any of the people, and they too make the movie worth a look: SuSu, who tries to get Wilder interested in ""Missy Cathy"" and, when he jokingly turns the tables on her and claims it's she who sets him afire, indignantly tells Cathy that ""Captain Sailor-Man"" is ""clazy...full of ginger;"" Tack, a slangy, cigar-smoking expert who can make his ship do things she wasn't designed for and has trained a ""black gang"" (engine-room crew) consisting entirely of his own cousins right under the nose of his Communist captain; Old Feng, who persuades his family to poison the refugees' food supply; scholarly Mr. Tso; and tough, loyal Big Han (Mike Mazurki), whose cheerful presence brightens several scenes.  There's an ""African Queen""-ish sequence in which the villagers, male and female together, literally cordelle the ferry through the reed marshes like a keelboat in order not to betray her presence by burning fuel, and a thrilling battle in the wheelhouse in the midst of a raging thunderstorm when two of the Fengs try to overpower Wilder at the wheel, only to be foiled when Tack, in the engine room, hears the ruckus through the speaking tube and sends up a couple of his cousins as reinforcements.  And the sequence in which the villagers come aboard--bringing with them all their goods and chattels, from pigs and goats and poultry to carved furniture and golden household Buddhas to several small machine guns acquired Heaven-knows-how--is reminsicent of a similar scene in Heston's ""Ten Commandments.""  Though no longer Politically Correct in these days of official recognition of ""the Mainland,"" it's a good adventure film and one families can enjoy together.",1150761600,3,3948,4.962121212121212

349921,4,6301718275,"I recently visited ""China Camp State Park"" near San Rafael on San Francisco Bay.  I was surprised to learn that Blood Alley was filmed there.  I had seen the movie many years before in a pan and scan version on regular broadcast TV.  I had assumed that the movie was filmed in Hong Kong or someplace in the orient. I was very pleased on viewing the DVD that it contained a couple of short ""making of"" added features, based on home movies that John Wayne took during the filming at China Camp.  It surprised me to learn that John Wayne was as much a producer of the film as its star.  His home movies revealed other surprises too -- like the need for fog making machines in San Francisco Bay.  I was pleased that little has changed at China Camp and it still looks much the same as it did in the movie.  I am not a particular fan of John Wayne, although I do admire several of his movies very much including Hatari, The Cowboys, True Grit and The Shootist.  It was especially nice to see another movie with John Wayne and Lauren Becall.  While I like Lauren better in ""The Shootist"", her feisty personality works well played against John Wayne's usual self portrayal.  I must agree strongly with another reviewer that the costume designer for the film was really off the mark with the dresses and make-up for Lauren Becall.  Unfortunately, that really dates the film to the early 1950's.  Otherwise, the story, action, special effects are all first rate and the film holds up well when compared to recent productions.

349924,4,6301718275,"Sort of a strange film but, dare I say it, entertaining. Nicely made. This feels as if were made in between major efforts. Not one of Wayne's best but certainingly not his worst. For that, see (or don't see) ""The Conquerer"". The pairing with Bacall is very good. The two stars work well together and their interaction provides the story's framework and keeps things interesting.

Just curious, are the Chinese village sets the same as those used in the Bogart film ""The Left Hand of God""? Now there's a DVD candidate.

The DVD image looks good. Yes, the color is somewhat muted, but this film is around 50 years old and film stock from that period wasn't the best nor was it carefully preserved. Still, this film has never looked, or sounded, better on home video -- and at long, long last we have the full CinemaScpoe image!

Duke and Bacall in an entertaining film. Microwave some popcorn and enjoy.",1122940800,6,901,4.61875
349925,4,6301718275,"John Wayne has his hands full in this one. He plays an American sea captain captured by the Red Chinese and held for the crime of not being a communist. While he sits rotting in a prison, he gets a mysterious note telling of arrangements made for his escape. He makes good on his escape only to find that his benefactors are the daughter of an American doctor (Lauren Bacall) and a village of Chinese who are less than thrilled with their communist masters. They have arranged to steal a ferry boat and want John Wayne to pilot it 300 miles to Hong Kong and take the entire village with him. The communist gun boats make for dangerous adversaries but navigating the river with a decrepit paddle wheeler, no charts and lack of fuel makes the going even more difficult. Taming Lauren Bacall makes all of that easy in comparison.

As usual, John Wayne plays himself in this film. He is a tough, uncompromising man who sets out to do a seemingly impossible task. This time it happens to be in China and aboard a ship. The character does not change but no one expects the Duke to be anyone but himself.

Bacall plays her part as a feisty American woman. She is, of course, Wayne's love interest in this film and her strong willed nature seems perfect to clash with Wayne's own will of iron. The conflict of wills comes across well. The love story comes across less well. Still, it is an entertaining movie.",1120608000,36,1401,4.46875

John Wayne has great chemistry with Lauren Bacall, despite the fact that she looks rather out-of-place at times (Western clothes in a Chinese fishing village? Hmmm...). Wayne's humor and heroism are well-displayed, much better than in ""The Green Berets"". The dialogue is snappy and the film never bogs down. My rating: 10/10.",1119830400,2,392,4.865671641791045
349927,5,6301718275,"During the early years of the Cold War when the so-called ""red, John Wayne (1907-1979) and Lauren Bacall starred in a wonderful film entitled ""Blood Alley"" in 1955.  John Wayne plays a merchant marine captain named Capt. Tom Wilder that has been imprisoned by the Chinese for several years.  To keep from losing his mind during his imprisonment, Capt. Wilder creates an imaginary female friend that he names ""Baby"" and who he talks to frequently.  One day, Capt. Wilder is given some unexpected assistance to escape, which he does by setting his mattress on fire.  Wearing a Russian military uniform that had been smuggled into the prison, Capt. Wilder makes his way to a waiting junk that is steered by Big Han (Mike Mazurki, 1907-1990).  Big Han takes Capt. Wilder along the river and into the East China Sea to a small fictional fishing village named Chikushan.  There, he is taken to an old castle that overlooks the bay and the village and is the home of an American doctor, his daughter Cathy Grainger (Lauren Bacall) and a sassy maid named Susu (Joy Kim).  Cathy then introduces Capt. Wilder to one of the village elders named Mr. Tso (Paul Fix, 1901-1983), who explains that the 180 residents of Chikushan have risked their lives to rescue him from prison so that he can assist in their escape from Communist rule to freedom in Hong Kong, which was under British rule at the time.  Their intended means of escape is to hijack a steam-powered river ferryboat that was built in the nineteenth century and propelled by a large paddle wheel.  Capt. Wilder initially doesn't agree to help them, but then changes his mind as he recollects the entire coastline between their position and Hong Kong.  However, not everyone in Chikushan is aware of the villagers' intentions.  Specifically, the Feng family, lead by Old Feng (Berry Kroeger, 1912-1991), is loyal to the Communists; but the village elders have decided to take the Fengs with them so that they will not be held accountable for the villagers' escape.

Not only did John Wayne star in ""Blood Alley"", he also produced it and co-directed (uncredited) it with William A. Wellman (1896-1975).  Though not a completely believable story, ""Blood Alley"" does have some very good action sequences (such as when Chinese soldiers visit the village and when the ferryboat is shelled), some very emotional scenes (usually between Wayne and Bacall) and good color cinematography for 1955.  Though some aspects of the film would be regarded as stereotypical and politically incorrect by today's standards (such as the manner in which Susu talks), the story is both engaging and entertaining as are the characters.  Overall, I rate John Wayne's 1955 film ""Blood Alley"" with 4.5 out of 5 stars, rounded up to 5 stars, and I am very glad to see it finally released on DVD.",1118102400,,2815,4.859832635983263
