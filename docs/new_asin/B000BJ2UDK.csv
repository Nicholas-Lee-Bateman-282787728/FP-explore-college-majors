8087435,5,B000BJ2UDK,"Bosko Video's The Complete Superman Collection: Golden Anniversary Edition two volume VHS releases of the classic Max & Dave Fleischer cartoons are the best that I have ever seen of the classic Paramount Pictures produced Superman cartoon shorts of the early 1940s. Bosko Video got their episodes transferred from original 35mm prints and negatives, and never before have prints of this quality been available from ANY source, including laser disk (and not like the various public domain copies out there in VHS and DVD that are just horrible quality from cheap rate video companies). The print quality of Bosko's Superman episodes is excellent, with both visual and sound among the best I have ever seen of these classic animated, historical shorts. Volume Two contains the last 9 episodes (of the 17 produced): Terror on the Midway, Japoteurs, Showdown, Eleventh Hour, Destruction Inc., The Mummy Strikes, Jungle Drums, The Underground World, and Secret Agent. Volume One contains the first 8 episodes in the series.

This Bosko Video release is also now available on DVD by Image Entertainment as ""The Complete Superman Collection: Diamond Anniversary Edition"" since the year 2000. Just like the front of the box says on both the VHS and on the DVD package, a review quote regarding this collection from Bosko Video: ""The best and only Superman collection a fan should own"" -Animato!",1131494400,,1386,5.16
