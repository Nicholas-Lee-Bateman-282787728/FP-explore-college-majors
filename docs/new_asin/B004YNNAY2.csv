8448694,5,B004YNNAY2,"For anyone who is a fan of Sailor Moon this is a must have, in fact this movie along with the R and SuperS movie the same concept applies! This DVD has remastered picture quality and sound that is similar in fashion to a blu ray. Its price is fantastic as well for if you wanted buy it from amazon.jp it would cost $30 instead. This DVD gives you the uncut Japanese and Italian dub. Now for all English speakers there is a downside there is no English subtitles, or audio track but unless you are a brand new moonie you will have known the plot for hearts in ice for a while and should not have an issue understanding it. This DVD will NOT play on an American DVD player you do need a multi-region DVD player but remember computers can play them different regions DVDS a few times there are also programs to help anyone out with that issue. Make sure to get all 3 movies for it won't be two long until they are off the market!",1360627200,,926,4.15
