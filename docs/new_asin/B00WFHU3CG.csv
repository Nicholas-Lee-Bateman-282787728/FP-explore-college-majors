8713146,5,B00WFHU3CG,"This video will call upon the average person to think! This film is what we all should endeavor to challenge ourselves, and ask what I am doing with my life? Show this to our kids and help them to live a more purpose driven lifestyle. Its more to life than consumption, following the masses and pleasures that leave us feeling more empty and searching for something and can never seem to be satisfied.",1517875200,,401,4.506849315068493

8713148,5,B00WFHU3CG,Definitely a five-star! But you have to watch it at least twice to get a clear understanding.,1508716800,,93,4.529411764705882
8713149,2,B00WFHU3CG,"The lecture is interesting, but the unrelated B-roll and poorly matched music are incredibly distracting. Try listening without watching, and you'll surely have a better experience.",1483315200,,181,6.0

8713153,5,B00WFHU3CG,"I can't wait for this doc to be released on DVD. It's a 5-star keeper for sure. I never really thought about how ""programmed"", strapped and trapped in a corporate-controlled system of B.S. that we (humans) truly are until I watched this documentary on Hulu. And you can catch it there before it's actually released on DVD if you have access. If you ever wondered why things are the way they are in the world and why people behave the way they do as a result, then this is definitely the program to check out. I must admit, I didn't quite know what to expect of the content after reading the description. But, I was ""glued"" to the show after just a couple minutes. This program explains everything we are ""forced"" to conform to from our birth to our death and how our programmed life starts from Day 1. It's very truthful and riveting information. And only an absolute robot would disagree after viewing the program. As well, this show is 1 hour long and gets to the meat of the subject in pretty short order. I for one will most definitely be purchasing this program when it's released.",1438646400,2,1086,4.4623115577889445
