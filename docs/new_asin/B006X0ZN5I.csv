5028088,4,B006X0ZN5I,"Jake and the Never Land Pirates combines a tot's-eye-view of make believe pirate games (where pirates have pop music dances and tea parties) with the Peter Pan setting -- plus a morsel of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, a dash of Dora and the coins of Mario Bros.

What is doesn't always have is Peter himself, except in this ""feature"" special now on DVD (actually a hour long episode) in which he does appear and the gang helps him regain his gift of flight and happy thoughts. (Fans of Walt Disney's original 1953 Peter Pan might get a kick out of his reverse angle song, ""I Can't Fly, I Can't Fly, I Can't Fly.""

Adam Wylie, who costarred as a child on Picket Fences and has become a veteran of stage, TV and voice acting (as well as a magician at Disneyland), voices Peter with a good feel for Bobby Driscoll's performance. The show really doesn't try to recapture the film, but instead takes a colorful preschool approach, with simple characters designs and lots of peppy songs. There's even a live-action pair of singing pirates in each episode (similar to what Filmation did back in the early '70s with The Hardy Boys).

The breakout star of every show is Captain Hook, played brilliantly by Corey Burton completely for comedy and minus the menace. To keep true to the source material, Hook, Smee and his crew are never familiar with the more contemporary materials that Jake and company enjoy, calling anything modern a ""thingy"" or some such. Scooby Doo fans take note: more than once, Hook refers to the young pirates as ""meddling swabs.""

The DVD is generously supplied with other episodes in addition to ""Peter Returns"" with ten additional segments, or the equivalent of five half hour shows -- including one featuring Hook's mother, voiced by Sharon Osbourne!",1334188800,6,1763,4.751633986928105
5028089,5,B006X0ZN5I,"This is a cute DVD for any Disney fan, especially Jake & the Never Land Pirate fans!  My boys (3 and 5) have loved this show since it started and I admit I like it too because Peter Pan has always been one of my favorite Disney movies!  This DVD is great though because it features so many great episodes, including one we hadn't seen before featuring Captain Hooks mom!  Even though we have seen all the other episodes it is nice to have the DVD to watch Jake and the gang anytime.  We brought this DVD to grandmas, the car, even the hospital while my little guy was there.  The animation is great, the singing is fun, and the lessons are perfect for preschoolers to understand.",1334188800,,679,4.31496062992126
5028090,4,B006X0ZN5I,"My son absolutely loves Disney's Jake & the Never Land Pirates, so I was excited the company released their newest/big promotion episode, ""Peter Pan Returns."" He loves this show because of all the music and pirate stuff, and I love that they learn to solve problems, work together, always encourage each other and count their gold doubloons.

I found the term ""full-length adventure"" a little confusing; when I think of full-length, I think of a movie. This DVD comes with ""Peter Pan Returns"" as well as five additional episodes for a running time of 169 minutes. Their ""full-length"" is the televised, one-hour-with-commercials episode. It's definitely my son's favorite episode (he's almost 5 years old).

The other episodes included on this DVD are:

1. The Elephant Surprise!/Jake's Jungle Groove (Capt. Hook and Smee hide in a wooden elephant then try to steal all of the pirate crew's treasures; Izzy and Cubby have a dance party with the bongos and teach Jake the Skull and Bones Stomp)

2. The Pirate Pup!/Pirate Rock! (Jake's puppy steals Capt. Hook's boot; Capt. Hook tries to keep Jake and his friends from playing their pirate music but ends up joining them)

3. The Sword and the Stone/Jake's Home Run (Jake's sword is the key to opening a mysterious door; Jake and his friends have to get their only baseball back from Capt. Hook)

4. The Pirate Princess/The Rainbow Wand (Izzy tells her mates about the cursed pirate princess, then they find her and set her free; the pirate crew finds the pirate princess's wand and return it to her)

5. Mama Hook Knows Best!/Pixie Dust Away (This is a new episode, Capt. Hook's mother comes for a visit and wants to go on a treasure hunt, Jake and his crew follow a map to treasure, Capt. Hook steals the treasure only to have his mother reprimand him for taking something that wasn't his; Izzy loses her pixie dust, but the fairies lead them on a hunt to the Fountain of Forever to replenish her store)

This is described as a two-DVD pack; the first DVD is all the episodes and the bonus material (A game where you follow the clues to find Peter's shadow, and a sing-along, I assume with Sharky and Bones, at a pirate party); the second DVD is your digital copy.

UPDATE 04/09/12:
My son was really excited to get this DVD and he's enjoying the fact he can watch it when he wants, not just when it's on Disney Junior. I also like that I can let him watch just one episode at a time, or when we need more entertainment (like on long car trips), this DVD has plenty on it to keep him happy.

The bonus features were more simple than I expected. Each episode has a Sharky and Bones song at the end, and the bonus Pirate Party is the six songs again but with words at the bottom of the screen. They include ""Never Land Pirate Band"", ""Roll Up the Map"", ""Shipwreck Shuffle"", ""Castaway on Pirate Island"", ""Never Sky"" and ""Pirate Mom"". We like most of their little songs (especially ""Roll Up the Map""), so I think this is a good feature.

The other bonus feature, Yo Ho, You Ready To Find Peter Pan's Shadow?, was described as a game, so I thought it would be interactive and you would need to use the remote to follow clues or something. Not so much -- it's more like a very short episode. You just play it and it goes, and it's actually more about following Peter's shadow to find Jake's sword. In a way this is probably good; I don't exactly want him to be playing with the remote. Jake encourages his young pirate friends to get up and jump across lily pads and use their sword to help him cut vines and then trace the shape of shadows in the cavern of shadows from the ""Peter Pan Returns"" episode. They get some gold doubloons and Jake gets his sword back.

The bonus features are both cute, but it wasn't anything impressive and we probably won't use them much.

I think this is a decent price for a DVD, and I like how many episodes you get.

The episodes do get a bit forumlaic -- either Capt. Hook is stealing from Jake and his friends or from someone else, then they get it back. For that reason, and the bonus material, I just can't bump my review up to 5 stars; I would give it a strong 4.5 stars. Perhaps kids enjoy the familiarity of similar stories, but as the parent, it gets old. However, I like that the characters are usually trying to improve or learn something. And in the new episode about Mama Hook, although it follows their formula very close, Hook's pirate mother reprimands the captain for stealing the kids' treasure and makes him share (even though she's a pirate and it seems very out of character with a pirate, I'd rather my kids learn that even pirates share).

Long story short, I would recommend this DVD. I'm so grateful that Disney is coming up with new, fun kids' shows that still have good morals and educational value. I don't like most of the new cartoons on television. I'm also glad I can get these on DVD so I can offer my kids something they enjoy on our timing.",1333497600,49,4951,4.4673311184939095

5028140,4,B006X0ZN5I,"I'll start off by saying that it was love at first watch for my daughters, 4 and 6. This show is full of fun music, which adds a lot to program. The characters are cute. BUT there are a lot of put downs, which perplexes me. Constantly the name calling between captain hook and the kid pirates annoys me. And it is particularly over done with this Peter Pan episode. I am personally quite disappointed with how Peter is personified. Jake, Izzy and Cubby look up to him and would follow him to the ends of the earth it seems, yet I haven't seen any redeeming qualities in this hero. He is cocky and rude. To captain hook he can't get through a sentence without throwing in something about him being a codfish. Captain hook is naughty, selfish and childish, but not too threatening of a villain, which is nice for young watchers, and the show does try to teach things like stealing is wrong...but it really falls short on portraying real role models. The name calling by captain hook I can accept as he is the bad example in the show, but the kids?? This is disappointing for me. Now, aside from that, the catchy music is nice. Another positive is the French and Spanish tracks are well done, and it is very good for my kids to watch programs in French and Spanish, and since they are so magnetized by this show they are willing to watch in these other languages. Also, I think mostly kids do learn from us and as long as we talk about how name calling is not acceptable and model appropriate behavior...well it helps. Obviously I have mixed feelings about this show. It also inspires a lot of imaginative play in my house.",1411948800,,1620,4.403333333333333

Every time they outwit the pirates, magic coins appear and someone says ""Oh great, 9 gold doubloons!"".  What is with that?  Don't kids get enough of this kind of pointless empty reward from computer games?

PS The songs are dreary beyond all believing.  The old baronet JM Barrie is rotating in his grave.
