The director provides an honest but factual view of the development of lesbian love in Wartime Germany. The actresses that portray Felice and Lily have a sexual quality that makes this story even more believable. The fact that it is TRUE and Lily is a survivor makes the film even more interesting.

1353963,5,B00004U421,"Max Farberbock has brought an amazing story to beautiful life in his first feature film Aimee & Jaguar.  Based on the true story of Lilly Wust, a Nazi wife and mother and Felice Schragenheim, a member of the Jewish underground, it is a film of incredible emotion and intensity. A stunningly visual work, it is a gorgeous film with rich and complex performances by Maria Schrader and Juliane Kohler in the lead roles. Nominated for a Golden Globe for best foreign film and winner of the Berlin Film Festival's Silver Bear, this is a film that cannot be missed.",1008460800,6,559,4.646464646464646
1353964,5,B00004U421,"An important story about beauty, strength and the human touch in a time of sick paranoia and insanity. No Hollywood movie could ever convey with such honesty the message of the power of love, the greatest human potential and chance for making this world more liveable to everyone. I hope the price goes down fast so this videa can start to fulfill its task to educate and touch in the States as well--especially, this would be my hope, on college campuses!",1007683200,6,456,4.6419753086419755
1353965,4,B00004U421,"Max Farberbock's first feature, Aimee & Jaguar, builds such a strong opening act that it's almost tragic when things settle into a happy groove. The film, which is stunningly acted by its leads, follows Lilly (Juliane Kohler), a somewhat repressed housewife to an Army solider, and Felice (Maria Schrader), a Jewish lesbian that seems embroiled in some sort of lesbian resistance, as they form a relationship in WWII Berlin. Obviously, Felice must keep her religion secret, but her sexuality is an added burden. She is forced to live a lie on so many levels that when she takes a convenient interest in Lilly (after ending up homeless), you can't help but question her motives. Lilly seems to have never before flirted with the idea that she is a lesbian, and her early scenes show her pursuing affairs with men in an apparent attempt to anger her away-at-war husband. There's a suggestion that her lesbianism is only her latest ploy to gain her husband's attention. For both of them, any subversive act that they can perpetrate becomes a blow to the oppression that the Nazi regime has caused them to endure. The film walks a tightrope here, creating a giddy sense of danger that energizes the film as it piles on reasons why both of these characters need this relationship to work, and it manages to sustain a complex believability for an exceptional length of time.
I definitely felt the final half hour of the film became much less interesting, however. What was a startling example of the necessity to manipulate others and disregard their emotions in order to survive during the Holocaust descends into a bit of lesbian wish fulfillment. It's as if we're supposed to cheer these women for doing what they're doing while there's so much evil in their world. I suppose that's a worthy thing to celebrate, but it's hardly an interesting one, especially since the audience knows the circumstances under which the relationship began, and that makes their newfound happiness seem delusional on some level. The film was based on a true story (though I am not sure quite how faithful what we see is to reality) so such complaints might be a bit unjustified, but there's something to be said for knowing when to stop telling your story, be it fiction or nonfiction. As it is, it allows the blame for the relationship's failure to shift to the ever-present bad guys of cinema, the Nazis, despite the extraordinary first ninety minutes of the film that exposed that failure as the result of the relationship's faulty construction.",1005350400,23,2525,4.860788863109049

1353969,5,B00004U421,"This is such an important movie. I saw it first about 17 years ago, and was moved by it then.
It takes place during the Second World War as we follow a group of woman who are lesbians and also Jews.
For me, the love story which develops between the two main love interests in the story is really secondary to the atmosphere of tension surrounding the circumstances between the German hierarchy and occupation of the Country and the total apathetic persecution of the basic population of Germany as a nation.
The movie very adeptly portrays the veil of abject fear surrounding those in Germany who just wanted to go about their daily lives. While the Jewish and gay members of society were sought out, we can see that even those who associated with them were persecuted for giving splice or friendship.
Not a movie for lighthearted voyeurysm, but historically in depth and thoughtful.",1483920000,,883,4.740259740259741

Fast-paced, absorbing, didn't always know what was going on but it's more about the behavior of people in relationships.  ***Spoiler Alert*** I knew people like this in my youth [in the earliest days of the AIDS epidemic], swinging from devil-may-care hedonism to utter despair/desperation.  A dense, rich depiction of people filled with fear over their identities, their secrets, their safety, the fact that the world is in chaos and that no-one can be trusted.  A bit like Cabaret but less stagey and glamorous- gritty, so realistic (the clothes, the makeup, the settings, the acting) you forget you're watching a film, become utterly immersed.

I mean it's about a relationship between a Jewish woman and a woman with a Nazi husband. I wasn't born yesterday (plus the movie starts with scene from more contemporary time so you have a clue). But I mean to say that the relationship is so captivating that you just aren't gonna wanna see it go any way but blissfully.

Beyond that the cultural exploration is interesting and the character development of the individuals is very well-established. Again here the acting is just a joy to watch, particularly ""Jaguar's"" character who can be entirely vulnerable and yet also strong at the same time, whether that means in some scenes the pathos/ethos/whatever oppose each other or they just blend together entirely.",1429142400,2,974,4.903030303030303

In some sense too it took me awhile to figure out who the blond was in the movie. There is a choice of two and I just wasn't sure at first who the correct lady was. The end is sad as well.

1353994,5,B00004U421,"Didn't buy this one as a love story, or as a film about two ladies who fall in love, I bought this one because I'm seriously into WWII history, particularly German history, and I wanted to see the film.  With that background out of the way, this is an absolutely fantastic movie.  It's not trashy, it's not preaching any political motives, it's not offensive in any way, it's just a really good movie.

If you're reading this, you already know the subject matter so I'll not waste your time rehashing what everyone else has said.  Coming at this movie from the perspective of a history fanatic, they got all the little details right - and I was impressed!  The wardrobe, the uniforms, the props, the cars, every bit of scenery, is spot-on perfect for wartime Berlin.  The acting is top-notch, the camera work is as good as it gets, and the story is extremely well-written and the characters are all very well developed.

My grandparents were German, so that is where my interest in wartime Germany stems from.  As for the subject matter of the movie, my Opa was a teenage boy during that time and served in the Luftwaffe.  He told me, many times, stories of wives and girlfriends throughout Germany that are very similar to this one, only without the espionage twist this tale has.  Lesbianism, or perhaps more correctly bisexual behavior was apparently fairly common and widely tolerated during the war, and this is the only film I've seen thus far that tackles that subject and does it tastefully and with a great story as well.

HIGHLY recommend this one to any history buffs interested in wartime Germany.",1402272000,7,1609,4.690391459074733
1353995,4,B00004U421,"Max Frberbck's first feature film is based upon Erica Fischer's book, chronicling the true story of Lilly Wust and Felice Schragenheim, and their lesbian affair in war torn Berlin.

Both Maria Schrader (playing Felice) and Juliane Khler (Lilly) were born in 1965, so they would have been about 34 years old when making the film, which was right for Lilly, who was about 31 when the events took place, but wrong for Felice, who was only about 22.  This is one reason why the dynamics of the relationship - the why and how of their falling so passionately in love - are never made clear.  The performances are fine - that's not the problem - but in addition to losing that age difference, the film simply does not devote enough attention to tracing the genesis of the love between the two titular characters.  We see it happening but are not given sufficient clues about why it is happening.  Nonetheless, the story itself is extraordinary, and well worth telling.

If you are not familiar with the historical background, then you might well find the film confusing at times.  The director seems to assume that many details, such as the failed assassination attempt on Hitler, which are central to the action, will be familiar to the viewer.

The cinematography is excellent.  The Allied bombing raids, the quiet moments in the park, the erotic episodes are all strikingly well done.  The film is visually compelling throughout.

The sense of place and the atmosphere of wartime Berlin are very strong.  As might be expected, there is meticulous attention to period detail.

Despite the caveats mentioned above, this is a very fine film and is recommended.  The extras on this DVD include actual photographs of Lilly and Felice, taken on occasions that are featured in the film.  To look at those pictures after seeing the film is a profoundly moving experience.

It's easy to criticize the decisions these women made with hindsight, But they wanted to stay together and that's the way it was.  The housewife was cheating on her husband, even before she met ""felice' the jewish lesbian. But that meeting changed both their lives. It's a good story and the acting is superb, but it is a long movie and I would have liked to have seen more of them trying to survive the Nazis.

1353999,4,B00004U421,"Set in Berlin during World War II, this tale of love and intrigue is based on a true story. Felice Schragenheim (Maria Schrader) is a Jewish woman fighting for the Resistance and living under an assumed name. Lilly Wust (Juliane Kohler) is unhappily married to a Nazi Officer and a mother of four children. When the two women meet, they are instantly smitten with each other.

As their passionate love affair blossoms, the women are under the constant threat of persecution and bombing raids. When their friends flee Germany, Felice opts to stay behind with Lilly however; the Gestapo is hot on Felice's trail.

Written and directed by Max Farberbock, Aimee and Jaguar is based upon Erica Fischer's book chronicling the memoirs of Lilly Wust. Narrated by an 85-year-old Lilly, the film is played out through flashbacks of the women's affair.

Maria Schrader and Juliane Kohler beautifully portray the wartime couple caught in an intense affair. The sense of urgency is palpable as the women enter into a forbidden love affair amid the threat of death.

1354004,5,B00004U421,"People who have survived the horrors of war will oftentimes say that the fear, all consuming in its totality, drives a revelation of the self. So it is with Felice Schroeder and Lilly Wust, the former a jewish lesbian hiding in plain view and the latter a German housewife loyal to the principles of the Third Reich.  Felice works for an underground movement based in Berlin and as the movie tells us, she is a woman with many faces.  Her unflinching strength in the face of adversity is humanized only by her extreme vulnerability in front of Lilly.  Here is a woman who sacrifices everything, her bonds with her family, her friends, and even her life for the good of the cause.  Yet, when confronted with the startling realization that a German housewife can love her, even knowing that she is a Jew changes everything for her.  Lilly, on the other hand, is first portrayed as a coward.  Her neediness is personified by her constant affairs with other men, in an attempt to channel her repressed passions - repressed, most likely, because she is a lesbian.  In true form, Felice is predatory when she sees Lilly - Lilly is a conquest of many facets, nonetheless because she is the perfect Aryan mother.  The two dance around each other and the desire is as thick as butter.  Yet, there is a transformation between desire to love.  We see both characters find courage within each other.  Felice, the courage to stay behind Berlin to conduct her relationship with Lilly, to live life on her own terms and Lilly, the courage to truly love another, no matter the consequences.",1324771200,,1574,4.666666666666667

Davon abgesehen hat mich an dem Film gestrt, dass nicht klar wurde, warum Felice sich (angeblich) in Lilly verliebt, denn die beiden Frauen schienen nichts gemeinsam zu haben; die Entstehung ihrer Beziehung war mir einfach nicht nachvollziehbar. Darber hinaus waren die Kulissen und das ganze Ambiente dissonant: die Szenen im Frisiersalon und in der Hotelbar schienen mehr in die 20er Jahre zu gehren, whrend die Silvesterfeier und husliche Szenen an die 50er erinnerten. Die Handlung findet an einer begrenzten Zahl von Drehorten statt, was den Film billig erscheinen lsst. Er streift die Not und Entbehrungen der Kriegszeit in Berlin nur am Rande, konzentriert sich mehr darauf, Informationen ber die Jdin Felice zu vermitteln, und setzt daher so gewisses Ma an Vorkenntnissen bei seinen Zuschauern voraus: Wenn man z.

1354011,5,B00004U421,"""Aime and Jaguar"" stunned me when I saw it; this is a remarkable love story between two women at a very dangerous time in World War Two Germany just as things are beginning to end the war. The cinematography; choreography; costumes; musical score and the script are virtually flawless. Indeed, I was mesmerized by this film; it held my complete attention from start to finish. The fact that the plot is strongly based on true life events makes it all the more meaningful; I doubt I will forget this motion picture anytime soon.

When the action starts, we see elderly Frau Wust being forced out of her apartment and into a retirement home which is the last thing she wants. When Frau Lilly Wust (played to perfection by Juliane Khler during the war years and by Inge Keller in more modern times) tries to escape the retirement home, she discovers much to her surprise that an old acquaintance, Ilse (played by Johanna Wokalek during the war years and by Kyra Mladeck for the modern day scenes), is living in the same retirement home! The two have much to discuss. For the most part the story is told as a flashback; and this works marvelously well in this film.

During World War Two in Germany, Lilly Wust is married to Nazi soldier Gnther Wust (Detlev Buck); but while he is fighting on the front lines for Germany, Lilly has affair after affair with other men to find true happiness, a modicum of fulfillment as well as some sexual satisfaction. Nonetheless, it isn't long before Felice Schragenheim notices the beautiful Lilly, and this creates huge complications as Felice hides her Jewish identity and her preference for woman in the midst of World War Two Berlin. Specifically, Felice ""hides in plain sight"" by working at a Nazi newspaper and watching very carefully how she behaves in public when she's not alone with her other lesbian friends.

When Lilly gets a passionate letter from someone she doesn't know who simply signs their name as ""Jaguar,"" she doesn't know who it could be but she is very interested in meeting the person she assumes is a man who wrote the letter. Much to Lilly's surprise, the letter has come from Felice who signed the name ""Jaguar"" to conceal her identity and protect herself against any backlash. Slowly but surely Felice encourages Lilly to start an affair with her--and for the first time in their lives the two actually find true love despite bombings from Allied forces; the Gestapo chasing Jews and lesbians like Felice (aka Jaguar) and a tough breakup between Ilse and Felice when Ilse realizes that Felice is no longer her girlfriend.

Although it seems as if I've written way too much and practically given it all away, I can assure you that I haven't. Gnther certainly isn't too happy when he discovers that his wife is having an affair with another woman; and Lilly's parents are not exactly thrilled, either. What will their reactions bring to Lilly and Felice who now call each other Aime and Jaguar? How does the war impact on Lilly's home life? Does Gnther fight for his wife or does he leave her? No spoilers here--watch and find out!

The DVD comes with some very good extras. There is a brief summary of Lilly Wust's life; and I liked both the ""behind the scenes"" featurette as well as the ""mini-documentary on the making of `Aime & Jaguar.'"" We also get interviews with both cast and crew--and even more!

I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in true life drama, romance films and even the impact World War Two had for same-sex couples in Europe. People also interested in high quality control foreign film will not be disappointed.",1287792000,,3606,4.715873015873016

One irony, a German soldier who is concerned that his kids be brought up right, probably adds to the suspense about which German soldiers will die if the war keeps going on. I enjoy this kind of thing because I keep hoping it will end, but ""forever"" seems like a perfect carved in stone tombstone kind of comment in this movie.",1245024000,,627,4.557522123893805
1354015,3,B00004U421,"I have mixed feelings about ""Aimee and Jaguar"" but more positive than negative. It's based on a true story set in Berlin in 1943. The film however begins in the present as we're introduced to one of the protagonists as an old woman. We then flash back to the war years where we meet Lilly Wust, married with four children, with a German soldier husband who occasionally comes home from the front. Felice is a Jewish lesbian, boldly hiding out with forged identity papers, working for a Nazi newspaper editor (brilliantly played by Peter Weck). Felice's girlfriend Ilse is Lily's household servant. When thrill-seeker Felice spies Lilly for the first time, she's determined to make it with her simply as a game. But after Lilly's marriage falls apart, the two fall in love. Along the way, one of Felice's lesbian friends is shot down in the street by the Gestapo. After about a year and a half, Felice's cover is blown and she's shipped off to a concentration camp where she presumably is killed (in real life, Felice's fate is unknown to this day).

Most of ""Aimee and Jaguar"" focuses on the relationship between the two lovers. It's a mature look at a budding lesbian relationship and there are some sensitively photographed love scenes. Felice adopts the masculine persona of 'Jaguar' and Lilly is the demure 'Aimee'. Most of the conflict within the relationship is primarily centered on Lilly's confusion about her sexuality, self-worth and decision to involve herself with Felice whose sensitive side is repressed due to her constant fear of being arrested by the Nazis.

While the relationship between the two lovers is at times compelling, it also becomes a little tiresome due to the fact that it's unnecessarily drawn out.

""Aimee and Jaguar"" is also a subtle Holocaust-related story, focusing on how ordinary German civilians reacted during the Nazi horror. Not all the Germans are happy with Hitler. In an early scene, Lilly's Nazi lover overhears Lilly's father badmouthing the regime and threatens to turn him in. Others act totally out of self-interest: a woman ends up selling black market food coupons to Felice and her friends inside a bathroom while they're attending a Nazi social function at a hotel. And then there are the hard core Nazis, such as Felice's newspaper editor employer who boasts that the German people are capable of ""tremendous feats"" despite all the bad news coming in from the war front.

In addition to the intense interplay between Felice and Lilly, there's also some nice tension between Ilse and Felice after Ilse becomes jealous over Felice's newfound interest in Lilly. Less interesting and predictable are the long, drawn out scenes between Lilly and her husband, Gunther, whose excursions from the war front are never explained.

Ultimately, the intensity of the performances of the actresses who play Felice and Lilly make up for the lack of conflict between the principal characters. As a history lesson, ""Aimee & Jaguar"" is also worth seeing, chronicling the Holocaust from the 'home front' perspective.",1236988800,6,3052,5.011834319526627

1354018,4,B00004U421,"Set in Berlin during 1943-4 and based on a true story, this unusual and moving film tells the story of bored repressed hausfrau Lilly Wust and her unexpected relationship with Felice Schragenheim, a Jewish woman involved in the underground and active in the local lesbian scene.  Lilly's husband Gnther is away on the Eastern front, and he seems to be a caring devoted husband, the way he visits her several times during the war, yet she doesn't seem to be finding fulfillment either as a wife to him (she has numerous affairs) or as a mother to her four sons (she's won the bronze order of the German Motherhood Cross for having produced this family).  Through her babysitter Ilse, she meets Felice, who was going out with Ilse at the beginning of the story.  As time goes on, she becomes more and more drawn into Felice's world of lesbianism, unknowing that her lover is also Jewish and in the underground, until finally her journey of self-discovery takes her out of the closet and she starts her affair with Felice, an affair the real-life Lilly considers the greatest love of her life.  Felice is so hopelessly in love with Lilly that she several times turns down the chance to escape from Germany.  It being set during wartime (the historical period, from the costumes to the air raids, is depicted absolutely stunningly), there are things and people at every turn threatening to derail their happy new home, but the women are so in love that nothing else matters.  They had to live intensely, as though every day might be the last, in such circumstances.  The final scene is incredibly moving.

As poignant, well-recreated, emotionally powerful, and masterfully-acted as I found the film, however, there were a couple of things that I felt could have made the story even better and stronger.  Why, for example, is it being narrated by Ilse, who is only a secondary character?  Wouldn't it make more sense to be narrated by Lilly?  And as moving and convincing as the love between Lilly and Felice is after they finally get together (the scene of their first night together is esp. powerful and realistic), I just wish there had been a bit more development of it prior to their getting together in that way.  What were their motivations for having pursued such a potentially dangerous relationship, particularly since hausfrau Lilly and partygirl Felice don't seem to have a whole lot in common personality-wise?  At times it also didn't really seem clear just what Felice's involvement in the underground was, since there wasn't an extraordinary amount of detail to that aspect of the story.  It also didn't seem extraordinarily clear as to whether Felice's three friends Ilse, Klara, and Lotte were Jewish as well as lesbian; at first it seemed as though they were both, but as the story wore on it didn't seem so clear.  And for being set in wartime Berlin, there did seem to be a rather strange lack of dramatic tension, with everyone knowing that any moment the Gestapo or SS might arrest or kill them for anything and everything they were involved in.  Having heard that the book on which it's based clears up a lot of these questions and goes into more detail, I can't wait to read it and get a better-rounded picture of the story.  And admittedly, the overall film is so strong, moving, and poignant that those are minor issues that shouldn't detract from one's full enjoyment.

Bonus features are trailers, a mini-documentary, behind the scenes footage (without subtitles), photos of the real-life Felice and Lilly, primary documents (such as the marriage certificate the women wrote for themselves and poems written by Felice), information on what happened to the real-life Lilly and Felice, and interviews with cast and crew.",1194134400,2,3742,4.847723704866562

1354022,4,B00004U421,"""Aimee and Jaguar"" is based on the memoirs of Lilly Wust, co-authored by Erica Fischer and published in 1994, which recount the love affair that Mrs. Wust, then a married mother of 4 young children, had with Jewish libertine Felice Schragenheim as the bombs fell in Berlin 1943-1944. While her husband (Detlev Buck) was fighting on the Eastern Front, Lilly (Juliane Kohler) kept the company of many German officers. Felice (Maria Schrader) used the last name Schrader, passed herself off as gentile, and worked for a Nazi newspaper. All the while, she consorted with a scandalous band of ladies, seemingly left over from more carefree Weimar days, and flaunted a string of lesbian lovers. By coincidence, Lilly and Felice meet. What at first seems like one of Felice's caprices turns into a life-changing relationship for Lilly. But Lilly is resentful of Felice's secrecy. Felice's underground compatriots resent Lilly's bourgeois sensibilities. And the Gestapo is closing in.

""Aimee and Jaguar"" may be more interesting for the picture it paints of life in Berlin in the final years of  World War II than for Lilly and Felice's affair. The time the film spends recreating the environment in which these two women live and their lives before they become lovers makes the film too long and poorly paced. Nevertheless, it provides insight into Berliners' efforts to get on with life as bombs rained down on them and corpses littered the streets as well as the struggles of Jews and other underground populations who remained in Germany -while the love affair impressed me as awkward and implausible under less desperate circumstances. Lilly and Felice have nothing in common except emotional needs -including an almost pathological need for attention- heightened by the stresses of war. ""Aimee"" and ""Jaguar"" were their pet names for one another.

Lily and Felice are so self-absorbed that it left me disinterested in the scenes between them. Neither is a sympathetic character. Lilly is an unfaithful housewife who takes no pleasure in her affairs, a mother who doesn't seem to care for her children. She shows no consideration for her husband's nightmare on the Eastern Front, instead inflicting her domestic drama on him. Felice refuses to live life on any but her own terms, to the point of delusion and self-destruction. She describes herself as ""ungrateful and desperate for admiration"" and values her ""mediocre little right to be free"" above all else. But it is an illusion of freedom she seeks. Felice turned down numerous opportunities to leave Germany, preferring to stay and lead the life of a lesbian party girl, which is hardly inconspicuous under puritanical Nazi rule. She toys with Lilly's affections. She's ballsy, but that's it. Lilly and Felice are both so caught up in their own personalities that they deny the reality in which they live. That put me off, while the scenes of wartime Berlin interested me. German with optional English subtitles.

The title was funny and the picture seemed odd to say the least. But what I recieved was an extremely high quality movie with true love and passion. The plot is amazing and not only do you get to see how the war affected everyones' lives, you get to see how it united to women that became passionately in love with one another. It is funny, sad, romantic, adventurous, everything you want in a movie. It is also foreign, which is always a plus. This movie is easily one of my favorites of all time, and by far the BEST lesbian themed movie I have seen. It shows how love can be between anyone, and that someone's sex is not important when love comes by. I recommend renting this, but you will want to buy it!

Then there is Lilly Wust (pronounced 'Voost', in German) whose husband is a Nazi soldier fighting on the Eastern front, leaving her at home with four boys.

  A movie of raw power, ""Aimee & Jaguar"" is not a story just about love but also accepting it in times of need and fear.  You may find yourself crying and i admit, i cried myself (i cry endlessly when seeing Felice's and Lilly's ""mistake"" when coming home from the picnic, i cry every time i see that part).

It is one of those few films about two women in love that doesn't drag in all the extra baggage that one usually sees (besides the unavoidable things caused by the time setting) It's simply about two women finding each other in a desperate and unsettling time. Jaguar is such a strong character and is portrayed beautifully by Maria Schrader who's performance was flawless. I think the film does a good job of building and conveying the strength of the relationship in the short time it has. The passion and intimacy of the love scenes is brilliant!

1354029,4,B00004U421,"Felice (aka Jaguar) is a Jewish woman living in Berlin during WWII. In her underground life she is the dynamic center of a group of avant-garde lesbian women artists and eccentrics and a sinful seductress of fair-haired women.  She is avant-garde in her tastes and in her always stylish appearance;  with her dark eyes and perfect form she looks like she has walked out of a painting by Klimt or Schiele. She uses her charms on her female conquests and to assist the resistance in any way she can. As a secretary for a prominent Nazi newspaperman she has access to valuable information which she covertly passes on.  Felice presents a convincing facade but beneath the elegant profile and pretty lipstick and dark eye-shadow is a woman who lives in fear .  So it is shocking at first that Felice should be drawn to the  very blonde and very Aryan and very bourgeoisie Lily Wust. And yet it makes perfect sense too. Because Lily is the perfect German Felice feels safe in her home and in her bed.  These two are instantly drawn together from the first time they lay eyes on one another. Felice immediately goes about seducing Lily even though Lily is married and has four children and has never had a lesbian relationship. Reluctantly at first but then wholeheartedly Lily succumbs to Felice's advances. And once they take that first trembling step they both realize they are made for each other. Soon they are living as a couple in Lily's large apartment while her husband is away at the front.  The bliss these two find together is something to behold; for the first time in their lives they feel a content they've never felt before. Felice's friends at first can't believe the avant-garde Felice has fallen for the bourgeoisie Lily but soon they all can see its the real thing and they all accept her. Eventually, however,  the husband stumbles onto what is going on when he arrives unexpectedly one night and finds the women in bed together. Lily is utterly devoted to Felice and decides to leave her husband and for awhile things are perfect for Lily and Felice (Aimee and Jaguar are their pet names for each other)but one night when they come home from a perfect day of swimming in the country and tumble on the floor kissing each other in the dark of the apartment  they hear a voice -- a Gestapo agent and his men -- tell them to enjoy that kiss for it will be their last. This is not a perfect film but it does a few things so well that you are willing to forgive it for its few minor faults. The most important thing in a film like this is the chemistry between the two leads and that we believe it when they say that they are in love and we do.",1069027200,13,2654,4.466942148760331

That said, this portrayal of two women falling in love in Nazi Germany is gorgeous. The acting is spectacular, the costumes are exquisite, and the script is flawless. It's best suited to a somber or appreciative mood, but every lesbian (and arguably every person) should see Aimee and Jaguar.
The special features alone make this DVD worth buying. Extensive photo galleries and a mini-documentary provide more insight into the lives of the real Aimee and Jaguar. The quality of these extras is truly fitting for a movie of this calibre.

I don't care who you are, if you've ever been in love, or been in love and lost it, this film will touch you deeply as it has me, and leave an impression of that touch lingering in your soul for days after. It's so superbly acted, that I don't want to know the actors' real names or see them in other films; they really are Lily and Felice (Aimee & Jaguar) to me. You are brilliantly brought right into Berlin at the height of the Allied's destruction of the city, and for a moment, you nearly hope the bombs don't find their targets! That's how captivated you are by everything about this film. Their love is beautiful, the cinematography is brilliant, and you fall for it all exactly as the filmmaker has wished you to. Bravo! Few films have given it all to me as this one does: high drama, suspense, passion, love, hate, fear, and danger entwined and pure in all of its emotions. Our characters' deepest feelings and values are challenged, as it is so often in real life, but normally to a lesser degree than they are forced to endure by their circumstance. They take on impossible challenges and show us extraordinary strength of character over seemingly insurmountable obstacles. And after all that, you are left without specific answers to some burning questions, that haunt you enough to make you ready to commit yourself to finding these answers yourself! If you see it twice, don't be surprised if you find yourself hoping the plotline of this true story will shift this time just a little more in favor of our heroines.
Romantic and beautiful are the characters, the story, and the tragedy. Pure wonderment!

1354035,4,B00004U421,"I've been familiar with the story of Aimee and Jaguar for a few years now, yet I've just been able to watch this film on DVD.  Unfortunately, after two years of anticipation, I was slightly disappointed.
Don't get me wrong--I thought this movie was beautiful, poignant, and suberbly acted.  However, I read the book.  I feel I knew Lilly better--I knew all along she wasn't the insulated, flaky, unstable housefrau portrayed in this film.  I watched the first minutes of this film, with Lilly's sorrowful sexual neediness on display, and I couldn't help but wonder if the general public will realize (before they hate her) that this woman's sexual neediness is rooted in her repressed lesbianism, not in the long absenses of her Nazi husband.
Felice was given a sexy Marlene Dietrich flair (wonderfully portrayed by Maria Schrader), but her underground activities should have been emphasized more.  I know people who sat through this entire film not realizing that Felice was not only Jewish, but very active in the resistance movement.  I think that would have boosted the plot a little, and added to the dynamic of the relationship.  That way, after Lilly came out to her husband and declared to Felice and her friends ""I'm one of you now"", the cold reaction would have been more understandable.  Instead, this scene makes Felice look cold and uncaring.  To make matters worse, it's never clear if Felice's friends are also Jewish, or just lesbians.  Felice's character could have been so rich.  Indeed, some of the most emotionally raw scenes in the film involve her secret identity--most notable the scene in which, as a secretary at a Nazi newspaper, she is forced to take dictation for a scathing anti-semetic editorial.  While there's some hint that Felice and her group of girlfriends are trying to get papers and arrange to leave Germany, it's not quite emphasized enough that Felice's affair with Lilly seriously impedes that process.
The scenes when Lilly and Felice come together (and become AIMEE & JAGUAR)are not disappointing.  Their kind of passionate, we-could-die-tomorrow desire is enough to melt any audience member.  Lilly's insistance that this relationship defined her life--was indeed what she had been searching for--begs the audiences's forgivness for her borderline bipolar state.  I'm sure she is forgiven.
If nothing else, this film captures the horror of wartime Berlin as vividly as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN captures Normandy.  The bombing raids are filmed against stunning, dramatic red skies and amid the flashes of anti-aircraft fire.  Viewers get a good sense of Berlin as a city stubbornly soldiering on in this midst of all this horror.  Lesbian romance or not, this film is unrivaled in its realistic portrayal of Berlin in this period.  The smallest details--from the costumes to the curtains--contribute to this mastery.
Unfortunately, the cinematic mastery of this film is not enough to save the vague plot.  For instance, why does Ilse narrate the film?  Her character remains on the periphery thought, and she belongs there.  Her injected voice leads to confusion about her overall relevance.  I actively tried to get swept away in this film, because I believe the storyline is history that can't be told enough, but I too often found myself substituting my prior knowledge for the film's narrative ambiguities.  I could easily give this film 5 stars because I feel I have the whole picture, but I fear it will leave most viewers (who haven't read the book) without a clue.  True, the DVD has sufficient background information, but that is irrelevant.  The film should have, could have, stood alone.  And it does not.",1024531200,101,3655,5.058430717863105

I'd have liked a longer and more graphic love scene between the women, but I guess too much to ask for from a masterpiece. Watch a good softcore ... flick (ala ""Good Bye Emma Jo,"") then this, and you'll be good to go :-D",1024358400,3,352,4.115942028985507
1354037,5,B00004U421,"This movie just plain breaks your heart, but it's worth the emotional journey.  With characters that are vividly brought to life against a cruel backdrop of war and bigotry, the movie shines because it never compromises on its characters.  All of the characters are rich and three dimensional - Nazi, Jew, and German alike.  There's Jaguar's boss, a Jew-hating Nazi with a surprisingly sweet and good-natured side.  There's Aimee's husband, who can be both sweet and cruel at the same moment.  And then there's the main characters - characters who are flawed, but in love with each other in spite of AND because of those flaws.  I highly recommend the DVD because it contains interviews with the original Aimee and pictures of the couple from World War II.",1017360000,9,756,4.8671875
1354038,5,B00004U421,"Perhaps one of the greatest love stories displayed on the silver screen.  Truth is stranger than fiction!  The photography and acting is superb.  This film takes you into the world of Berlin 1943 with bombs dropping, while two women find love and each other. The story haunts you long after the viewing.  What courage and compassion these two women expressed.  My warmest gratitude to Lily Wust for offering her story to us. If you are seeking to understand what lesbians in WWII Germany may have been like, with their little references to Marlene D, this is a must see.  If you are drawn to true love stories, you can't miss with this one.  If you like war stories, it'a all here.  If you care to dance amid the bombs, go right ahead and dance!",1015200000,5,745,4.507462686567164

7923546,5,B00004U421,"This is the saddest war time love story I have ever watched.  People should have the ability to fall in love and care for whom ever they want, no government should dictate that to any individual.  After all we are all homo sapiens and all of us are descended from  multiple people in the centre of Africa about 150,000 years ago.  It seems to be that Lilly fell much harder for Felice than the other way around (maybe Felice, in her experience, had been hurt and knew when to apply the brakes on her emotions, however, she did elect to stay with Lilly after the 20th of July plot, when she could had left the Country with her compatriots and leave Lilly by herself).  Humans needs to get themselves together else they will eventually destroy themselves.  Lastly, I abhorred the beating that the Geheime Staatspolizei  men inflicted on Felice, she is a woman!!!  Yes,  they delivered punishment to her like she was a man and chucked her down the stairs.  I hope both of these women no longer know any more pain and are finally united in a realm that mere humans are unable to cause them any more hurt.",1511049600,,1100,4.455
