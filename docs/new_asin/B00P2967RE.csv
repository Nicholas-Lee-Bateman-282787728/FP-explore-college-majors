6785715,5,B00P2967RE,"Now THIS is how you make a great action movie. Take an intriguing setup, put in some characters that get your attention, and ramp up the intensity to an absolutely insane level, driving you on the edge of your seat. Jan De Bont, a longtime cinematographer did this with SPEED in 1994, and now one of the best action filmmakers Tony Scott did it with UNSTOPPABLE. The late Roger Ebert liked to call it the bruised forearm movie, where your date is grabbing your forearm so tightly you end up with bruises on it. Movies like this don't have to have wall-wall violence; (only one person actually dies in this film.) But all the other ingredients, especially the intensity, are a must.

The setup is simple and well executed in the beginning. In Fuller, Pennsylvania a train carrying 39 cars turns into a runaway when an incompetent railroad worker (Ethan Suplee) forgets to tie on the brakes and hops out of the cab to throw a switch. He thinks the train will only be going at coast speeds, but the throttle ends up falling in full power. The trains speed quickly escalates up to 70MPH, and has to be stopped before it hits an elevated curve in Stanton. At that speed the train would derail, causing a major chemical disaster. (The train is carrying Molton Phenol: a highly toxic and unstable. As a Yardmaster says, This train is a missile, the size of the Chrysler building.

The Yardmaster Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson) learns of the runaway early on and knows there is a very limited window to stop this locomotive before it starts barreling through the towns toward the elevated curve. Before it starts going through that part of the train path it would be in the middle of nowhere and suggests a derailment. But Galvin (Kevin Durant) is against that because of the major financial loss it would result in. He tries to get it off the main using a vehicle in front of the train, but that doesnt work.

Two employees operating a train traveling in the opposite direction of the runaway ultimately have to risk their lives to stop the train. They are Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington): a 28 year veteran who was given a forced early retirement, and Will Colson (Chris Pine): a yellow vest rookie conductor who got an entry level job due to family connections in the rail-yard company. Both of them are faced with personal problems; in addition to a forced retirement Frank lost his wife several years ago, while Will is struggling with a restraining order his wife filed against him. They not only risk their lives, they are warned by Mr. Galvin theyll be fired unless they stop their plan of hooking onto the back of the runaway and going the opposite way to slow it down.

As I said in the beginning, the intensity of this movie is just phenomenal. When one plan after another doesnt work to stop the train we wonder how this train can be stopped. Tony Scott helps to increase that intensity by his wise method of the action. We can follow it every step of the way. And as far as I could tell, every bit if it was done for real: real trains on real train tracks. Not one scene appears to have any trace of CGI.

UNSTOPPABLE was Tony Scotts last film before he died. I was as shocked and devastated at the news like any other fan. Tony knew how to do action before, such as TOP GUN and TRUE ROMANCE, but UNSTOPPABLE proved he could really ramp up the intensity in any action film. I will miss him.",1480982400,,3396,4.4975688816855754

6785719,5,B00P2967RE,"Excellent ""thriller - movie with excellent actors.  Washington and Evans have plenty of dialog as they interact with each other to solve several tons of fast, out-of-control locomotive fully loaded with toxic and dangerous potentially explosive material..  Plot somewhat predictable - they solve the mystery and become heroes.  Plenty of background interaction with ""higher ups"" and support people - some of whom are more concerned with saving money rather than taking swift action .to do the right thing.  Good two hours of edge of seat viewing.",1478649600,5,546,5.313953488372093

6785726,5,B00P2967RE,"Tony Scott's final action movie was done with real Locomotives on a real Railroad with real railroad terms!  A loose expansion of the CSX runaway in 2001, it lets you follow the dedication of railroad men accross this nation. Top Gun, The Taking of Pelum 123, and now Unstoppable brings action to the screen.  Remember to set you B-Ray player to 1080 and correct the color to let your 4K set show it in its full brillance.",1470787200,3,422,4.467532467532467

6785732,4,B00P2967RE,"It falls short of Washington's finest but it's powerful nonetheless. Washington's performance holds the drama together.

As a whole, the film is a gripping, detailed look at corporate incompetence in a high-stakes transportation industry. The story has great relevance to current debates about our decaying national infrastructure. It's dramatic but also very informational.

The editing is a bit too fast and the score is heavy-handed. Washington's expressions alone are enough to telegraph quite a bit of tension without the music or the jerky camera cuts.",1456617600,,558,5.552941176470588
