8145080,5,B000067J71,"This video show's Marvin in a different light.
His kids talk of him as their Dad, and wives talk of him as their partner, something I'd never thought of when I watch this man on screen,as he always brought his characters to life.
From Monty Walsh to Walker and Slob he was always a larger than life player on screen. Angie Dickenson and many others talk of Lee and working with him.
The video shows that there was alot more to Lee Marvin than many of us thought. 5 Star recommended any Lee Marvin fan needs this in their collection.
THANK YOU to all family and friends involved in the making.",1027296000,3,592,4.342342342342342
