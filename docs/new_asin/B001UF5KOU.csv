8343526,4,B001UF5KOU,"These are two excellent movies by the French art-house classic R.Bresson. For me they are among his best .I would especially recommend ""A Man Escaped"" for the beginners as a starting point to enter the Bresson's world of art. Just one warning: the copy of ""A Man Escaped"" is much darker than on the Artificial Eye DVD.Anyway, recommended for a comfortable price.",1360281600,4,362,4.854838709677419
8343527,5,B001UF5KOU,"Two great movies in one package at an affordable price.  Both movies are masterpieces, gripping tales of human faith.  If you're looking for ""action"" you won't find it in these movies, but there is plenty of action to observe,  take in,  and ponder.",1338422400,4,249,4.72093023255814
