5111233,1,B007V2LNAQ,"I can only give this 1 star and I'll explain why. The series has it's good points, animation quality and sound quality, but mostly ends up being a Dragon Ball Z knock off. The first 7 (or so) episodes and the ova mini episode extras are the best parts of this series. The story premise is also ok, but for 2/3 of the series, the principle characters are all in this ONE SAME ROOM (or arena) trading blows Dragon Ball Z style for basically the rest of the series until the last 1 or 2 episodes. I kept watching this to see if they ever GET OUT of this ONE SAME ROOM and actually do something else, but sadly it never happens until the very end. I ended up forcing myself to keep watching. What started out as a very interesting anime in the beginning fizzled out into nothing more than ""Needless"" and endless repetitive fighting.

If you're a really huge fan of Dragon Ball Z style anime where the good and bad guys trade blows for endless episodes or love fighting anime in general, then this might be for you. But if you're like me and enjoy a little more depth to your anime, you might want to skip this and get something else.

Oh and yes, I agree with some of the other reviewers here. For the price of the set (I bought the blu-ray edition), the included spindle case should have been a lot better. This is the type of case usually included with the thin packs or S.A.V.E. packs.",1420329600,3,1384,4.258555133079848

Breif overview*spoilers*
the place of this anime is set in japan after a bomb goes of and creates a sot in the land were things are .. different. people with strange powers appear and fight to control this area now called the black spot, which is under control of a pharmaceutics company called simion controlled by the villian. the people with odd powers are ""needless"" and have a fractal or power they use. the beginning and ending animations make this show look pervy but at most it shows a bouncing boob or girls bending over and having a tight butt. mainly girls are small with small breasts so this isn't a common factor.

the main charater is normal oddly enough and is searching for his sister with the help of his friends and is going to defeat simion. for some reason reminds me of gurren laggen don't know why. anyway its great, comedy,action,romance anime and you will enjoy it , please don't be fooled by the cover its a very clean anime i recommend to 15 and up ages",1355875200,3,1072,4.492307692307692
5111238,4,B007V2LNAQ,"I purchased this video based on its description without first watching it online.  While it started off different than most that I normally watch, I found it entertaining enough that I actually had to stay up very late to watch it all the way thru.

The 24 episodes cover the story very well.  It is organized in mostly chronological order, although story background is covered in several sections by having entire episodes dedicated to fully covering the background stories of various characters.

The focus of the story is a basic struggle against oppression with a very healthy dose of fan service included.  Lots of magical powers, panty shots and humor mixed together well.  Not recommended for kids.",1343779200,4,705,4.982905982905983

8522092,5,B007V2LNAQ,"- Synopsis: The world has been left as an apocalyptic place due to the effects of a third world war in the distant future. The closest thing to salvation that this world has is a fake priest that has one fatal weakness: cute girls. Brutal battles, dramatic and over-the-top dialogue, and loads of fan-service will ensure that the adventures of these eccentric heroes will be an anime to remember.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Main character is a pretty cool guy that knows how to have fun, unlike many silent protagonists in animes these days. He's a bit of a pervert, acts like a goofball, and can be serious when needed. All in all, he's a very unique and interesting character with a diverse set of powers and abilities.

- Analysis: Nobody is perfect. Everybody has a weakness that can be exploited. Fortunately, utilizing teamwork helps make up for one's strengths and weaknesses. Not only that, having friends or associating with like-minded individuals helps make life more interesting and tolerable.

Everybody has something that another person may regard as strange, to say the least. However, it should be noted that a real friend, significant other, or family member would accept someone for who they are. If not, they probably weren't a true friend or relevant person to begin with.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. Includes 24 episodes on 3 Blu-rays with a run-time of about 10 hours. Rated TV-MA for violence, language, and sexual content. There isn't any nudity, however.

- Conclusion: Has nice amounts of fan-service, funny scenes, interesting character interactions, and cool fight scenes. Many of the scenes are exaggerated and silly at times, but this helps establish a satirical tone, further adding to the entertainment value that this anime offers. Furthermore, the protagonist is strong, cool, funny, knows how to have fun, and like me, loves his waifus.

8522096,4,B007V2LNAQ,"I like this series way more than I should.  It's a total guilty pleasure.  It's full of fanservice, yuri, crude jokes, etc.  Andrew Love's character, a fighting priest, is loud, obnoxious, but also really funny.  Brittney Karbowski voices the female sidekick who is pretty but not the sharpest tool in the shed.  Luci Christian voices the everyman main character, a little boy trying to survive in this post-apocalyptic wasteland and obviously way out of his depth.  If you like Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero, you'll probably love Needless, too.",1453939200,,542,5.033707865168539
