8580159,5,B00CC3XTCE,"I highly recommend this amazing film. This is the first in a series that will reach 18 episodes when it is finished. It is the story of a complex battle between good and evil with a great heavy metal score.  Aceifer Genovese portrays Six, a man caught up in a chess match between God and the Devil. The cast is amazing and the action is enhanced by the heavy metal original soundtrack. Gary Evans",1384387200,,396,4.351351351351352
