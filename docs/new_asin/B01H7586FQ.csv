8764807,5,B01H7586FQ,"This has all the great elements of the crime investigative series, but what puts it on an even higher level is the humor and outstanding writing and cast. The characters interact wonderfully. I know of no other show with this level of drama and intrigue that keep me laughing like they do. They couldn't have picked a better cast for the roles they play.
  I found the 13 season set on eBay new sealed for $129.95. great purchase!!!",1499990400,,432,4.5256410256410255
8764808,4,B01H7586FQ,"This is a great price for all the seasons, though it's risky as it may be packaged incorrectly which is what happend to me.
I give this a 4 start as it is a competive price though I believe Universal's Quality Control isn't up to par. I have Season 13, Disc 1 & 2 doubled and missing Discs 3 & 4.

Hopefully amazon can help me out on this. Will update later.",1494115200,3,358,3.9722222222222223
8764809,2,B01H7586FQ,"It's not that I don't like the series because I do.  However I am VERY irritated because one of the disks was defective.  I just finished watching all 13 seasons, just to make sure there were no additional problems, and I need season 4, disk 1 replaced.  There was no sound, so it's of no value or use.  Watching silent movies does NOT do it for me.  I tried to find a way to report this but there's no provision for it evidentually.  I WANT A NEW DISK!!!!!!",1488758400,7,458,4.1477272727272725

8764812,5,B01H7586FQ,Love this series!!! Unsure if I'll like the new characters so I thought I'd order the set with the original cast members. I will give the new characters a chance though.,1476489600,2,169,4.483870967741935
