8246610,1,B0012L0TFW,"When I started to see this DVD I was sooooo disappointed and sad. I couldn't believe what have they done with such and awesome piece of art.
Its a modern take with no relation at all to the original Zarzuela.
It is a ridiculous attempt to do something different.
The stage is what you see on the photo on the front of the dvd. They open and close a kind of curtain on the squares for each act.
The clothes are a joke.
If you enjoy watching Zarzuelas, DO NOT buy this ridiculous version.",1397692800,,486,4.180851063829787
8246611,4,B0012L0TFW,"This issue seems to have split opinion so it might be a good idea for purchasers to watch the bonus interview first and as outlined as follows: In the 12 minute interview with the conductor and Marina Boltain, who did the adaptation, the concept behind this updating and how that it fits with the zarzuela tradition is fully discussed and explained. Essentially the expressed view put forward by the interviewees is that zarzuelas were an art form containing song, dance and the spoken word in a contemporary setting. This contemporary setting had the effect of allowing the audience to closely identify with the characters and situation portrayed as they would be known to the audience of the time. If a zarzuela is not updated it becomes out-of-date and loses the point of its existence.

As a result of this thinking the production is set in a modern Madrid block of flats. Some of the characters undergo transformations - the old millionaire marriageable chemist becomes a younger, but attractive alternative marriageable proposition. Julian, the unemployed typesetter becomes a butane gas supplier with the same lack of employment future in front of him. Aunt Antonia becomes Uncle Antonio. Crucially the script and the music remain untouched. The final nightclub scene imported to round off the story is intended to fit with the tradition of importing current songs and dances to traditional zarzuelas as originally conceived and performed.

Thus armed with this thinking purchasers will fit into categories of those who will tolerate this sort of update and those for whom it is anathema. The actual performance is delivered with the aid of ear mikes and amplification which makes the libretto easy to follow and makes the sound artificial at the same time. In these respects the effect is much the same as in many modern stage productions including operas in some venues. The performance is marked by energy and commitment by all concerned on stage and includes quite a fair amount of somewhat raucous female communication amongst the cast which can certainly be heard in plenty of 'live' street scenes and must therefore be considered authentic too. Passions can run fairly high - authentic to both the libretto and to the Spanish community in this situation. Good humour and common sense generally prevail in the end.

The camera work is fully involving, crisply detailed and of good colour definition. The sound is presented in both DTS surround and stereo and is vividly suitable for the type of production. The orchestral playing under the attentive leadership of the conductor, Miguel Roa, is of good quality. The night club scene at the end is effective in rounding off the story while avoiding any suggestion of subtlety.

I have come to the performance as a classical music enthusiast with a general interest in other musical forms when done well - and I thoroughly enjoyed this occasion while making my own allowances for the amplified and updated nature of the production.

For those who are of a tolerant frame of mind I would anticipate that this will give a good evening's light entertainment without causing offence. Those who prefer their zarzuelas to be as originally produced would probably be best advised to steer clear of this one.

A 4 star rating seems fair as a guide to those who feel drawn to this production. There is no rating being attempted for those who are not sympathetic to such an update as there seems no point or purpose beyond the description as above and as this production is clearly not aimed at such an audience.",1349308800,3,3562,4.948160535117057
8246612,5,B0012L0TFW,"As a Spaniard, I got to know zarzuela tunes before I ended up hooked on opera. And while I appreciate the beauty and high musical value of many zarzuelas, particularly when sung by great Spanish singers as Berganza, Caball&eacute;, Domingo, Carlos &Aacute;lvarez..., their books or libretti are in their vast majority quite out of date, when not just downright male chauvinist. And for a good reason. They were very much product of the day, adressing -and sometimes mocking- mores of the time and current affairs. Unlike in opera, the public back then, more than a century ago, saw on stage a reflection of their own lives and world. So Marina Bollain, and here I disagree with other reviewers, has done a great job updating to modern Madrid (maybe with just a little bit more of colour) the action of the story (a conventional but efective boy loves girl who seems prepare to love somoene else just for his money). She rightly gets rid of much of the very outdated dialogue, without changing or cutting any of Bret&oacute;n's music. If she adds some songs , sort of current verbena music, in the dance of the finale, it is within the tradition of the zarzuela and dramatically coherent. Also, it facilitates the staging of the reconciliation of Susana y Julian without cheesy words. While someone sings a bolero (Dos gardenias) in the verbena, he squeezes oranges directly on her mouth, an effective and sexy idea. The singers -all Spaniards- know their music and, without erasing memories of any of the above mentioned of course, do the piece justice. Miguel Roa conducts with brio and class. All in all, a rather good night of zarzuela, unexpectedly funny and sexy.",1281484800,,1668,4.835664335664336
8246613,3,B0012L0TFW,This Zarzuela is a Spanish classic.  And I did not appreciate the final sequence that included a nightclubish act with modern music.  I would deffinitely not recommend this item to a newcomer to the Zarzuela.  Stick to the original Breton's formula.,1277337600,3,249,5.024390243902439
8246614,1,B0012L0TFW,"Una decoracion epatante para los que conocen la obra... y una decepcion para el resto. Paradjicamente, solo la escena ultima, la aadida, la actual es ""real"" o vlida. La obra exige una pareja de jovenes y una pareja de viejos. Aqui el viejo farmaceutico es de la edad del joven, los jovenes son maduros.. falla todo menos la musica.

8246615,1,B0012L0TFW,"[...] I could not have written a better and more accurate description of this assassination of a masterpiece, of perhaps the best zarzuela that ever was. What a pity that better productions, of which you can see parts on You Tube (and which were taped live at Madrid theaters) have not been produced on DVD, productions that completely respect the composer's work. A masterpiece, as La verbena is, neeeds NO modern adaptation, just as Puccini and Verdi and Mozart need no idiotic producer as this woman is to have the nerve and idiocy of changing and ""adapting"" such perfect works of art. [...]",1239753600,8,594,4.776699029126213
8246616,2,B0012L0TFW,"The adaptation to modern times of this zarzuela is unconvincing. The cubicles might have worked for the stage, but they don't work for the DVD version and absolutely distract from the music. At some points it is difficult to understand who is who and who is talking (or singing). I don't object the time adaptation per se, but this one does not enhance this masterpiece, on the contrary it takes away the essence of it, it makes following the plot and sensing the music difficult. In addition, the sound production is flat and at some points very week and confusing. In summary, not a good DVD to enjoy a zarzuela Spaniards are so proud of.",1226188800,12,640,4.573913043478261
8246617,4,B0012L0TFW,"I never quite understand the uproar when a classic play or opera gets a radical rethinking in a new production; after all, setting MACBETH in the contemporary Middle East, or LA TRAVIATA in WWII France, to take two examples I've recently seen, doesn't erase the memory of past productions or irrevocably defile the original material.  Sometimes the changes serve to further illumine the piece's inherent ideas, sometimes not.  Either way, the sun comes up the next morning, and the material in question's still doing just fine, too.  That said, unlike the previous reviewer here (who's vastly more knowledgeable about zarzuela than I'll ever be), I found much to enjoy in this revamping of LA VERBENA DE LA PALOMA. The production's brash, funny, and colorful (not nearly as semi-pornographic or tasteless as it seems to have struck some), with the stylized apartment building set making a sensible substitution for the original's street.  The modernizations don't obscure the cast's considerable vocal chops and acting ability; they do create a vibrant, believable setting to bring this material to a contemporary audience.  There's value in museum reproductions of historical material, no question, but there's room, too, for new treatments of classic works.  This DVD may not be the ideal introduction for a serious scholar of the form, but it provided this viewer a melodic, enjoyable taste of these unforgettable melodies -- and it's made me curious enough to seek out the original for further study.  As Judy Holliday plaintively asked, ""Is it a crime?""  Recommended (although perhaps for Anglos only....)",1216857600,16,1610,5.26171875
8246618,1,B0012L0TFW,"Yesterday, I had the misfortune of renting this DVD from Netflix.  The first thing I found odd was the title Noche de verano en La Verbena de la Paloma, as there is no such work in the history of Spanish Zarzuela.  There is however a LA VERBENA DE LA PALOMA, which happens to be the crown jewel of the Gnero Chico, and which has nothing to do with the travesty presented here.  But I was literally thrown out of my seat as the curtain opened on this aberrant production to reveal a large cubicle on stage with smaller cubicles within it (see DVD cover).  This is  nothing new.  The wonderfully talented Gower Champion did it on Broadway in 1960 in Bye, Bye Birdie.  These cubicles contained an array of characters and settings such as a laundromat, a roof, a beauty parlor, and a bar.  For anyone not familiar with La Verbena de la Paloma I will interject here that  the original takes place in Madrid at the end of the 19th Century, way before the advent of laundromats or washing machines in Spain.  The stage director and concocter of this travesty, one Marina Bollan, who is totally unknown to me, has decided that this masterpiece works better if she updates the action to 2008.  The shenanigans begin with a spirited aerobic session by the company to the tune of Por Ser La Vrgen de la Paloma.  They are all dressed in ridiculous versions of Almodovariana.  The sets are also Almodvar inspired, but neither the sets nor the costumes have that wonderful, magical, and surreal touch Almodvar manages to impart to his work.  In Ms. Bollan's hands the Almodvar touch  becomes plain ugly, illogical and distasteful.  Absolutely no one dresses like this modern day Spain.  This is not funny, this is sad, and so far not very original as Ms. Bollan has already freely borrowed from  Gower Champion and Pedro Almodvar.  Moving on we meet the character of Don Hilarin who in the original is a very old rogue but who here is a leather wearing, long haired man in his thirties and who, to the viewer's dismay, proceeds to shed his clothing and regale us with his over hirsute, overweight  torso, splendidly graced with two very plush, very ample breasts.  He then gets into a bathtub and begins to rub his summits with two adorable yellow rubber duckies while he sings his Coplas, by the end of which, his self pleasuring has moved from his breasts to his genitals.  Disgusting!  The Ta Antonia of the original is here To Antonio and Ms Bollan has made him an androgynous hairdresser, thus the beauty parlor set.  He sings a song in Gallician, which, to my knowledge is not by composer Bretn and which has nothing to do with the plot of this zarzuela.  Ms. Bollan has also chosen to add to the work an intermezzo that I also doubt very much is by Bretn.  This intermezzo cuts brusquely from the live performance and takes us into video footage of a real verbena in Lavapis complete with assorted midgets, people dancing in the streets and the sad spectacle of a bull being victory-dragged through the ring after having been assassinated by the bullfighter.  The Spaniards refer to this barbarism as tauromaquia, I refer to it as deliberate animal cruelty of the vilest kind.  From this horrific video we cut back to the live performance where Ms. Bollan has taken us from Bretn's wonderful  music to the shoddy hits of today like La Bomba and a flamenco tinged rap number, plus the old Antonio Machn bolero Dos Gardenias Para T.  All hell breaks loose at the celebration  and the protagonists end up on the floor having simulated sex.  The aerobics choreography is reprised as Por Ser La Vrgen de la Paloma finally brings down the curtain for good on this monstrosity.  To all foreigners who are not familiar with this work I stress here in capital letters  THIS IS NOT LA VERBENA DE LA PALOMA.  This is a sick mind's idea of revising a work that needs no revising because it is a masterpiece.  This is like setting Madama Butterfly in Siberia  or making Aida an Eskimo or Carmen a Martian.  Ms. Bollan is a Spanish woman who disrespects and defiles the work of her compatriot Don Toms Bretn who gave Spain some of the most beautiful music ever created for its lyric stage.  She is a Spanish woman corrupting, tainting and clouding a work of art, and belittling it for world consumption when she should be displaying proudly and globally the riches of her culture and heritage.  This is a woman who should be tarred and feathered for her utter arrogance in thinking that her ideas are better than what the composer and librettist of this work originally wrote and intended.  By purchasing this DVD you help ensure that ""the age of the stage director continues"".  Do not buy this DVD.  Do not rent it.  Let's bring back ""the age of the composer"".  Let's respect these works and do them as they were meant to be done.  Let not have any more Nazi Toscas, or any more rubber duckie Verbenas.",1215820800,48,4882,4.5790080738177625
