I decided to search the internet for a few answers to my questions during my current re-reading of her books and saw that there was actually a movie made.  However it appears that this movie is not for US DVD player?

4661331,5,B005DOSETC,"This a very distressing and poignant story about the  trumped up charges that were levelled at Eugenia S. Ginzberg by the Stalin regime in Soviet Russia. As a result , although she fought to exonerate herself, she was sent to Siberia for 10 years. The film relates her stay there.. The film is edifying in spite of the horror, and her indomitable spirit of survival against all odds is an example to us all. I went and bought the two books she wrote about her sojourn. I'm reading the first.  The acting by Emily Watson is simply brilliant. Ulrich Tukur as the patient and suffering German doctor is equally excellent.",1356998400,4,618,4.609090909090909

4661346,5,B005DOSETC,"This brilliant film beautifully conveys the arrest, imprisonment and poetry of Eugenia Ginzburg, a Jewish Russian literature professor. She was wife to Kazan mayor Pavel Aksyonov, a member of the USSR's Central Executive Committee in the largest city of Russia's Tartarstan until her arrest in February 1937.

The acting, scenery, music and poetry are all divine. This is one of the best films I have seen of late, and the recitation of the poetry is truly inspirational.

Ginzburg's troubles, like those of millions more, started with the Dec. 1, 1934 assassination of first secretary of the Azerbaijani Communist Party and staunch Stalin loyalist, Sergey Kirov, which launched the Great Purge.

In 1937 and 1938 alone, Stalin and his minions ordered the legal executions of some 700,000. An estimated 18 million Soviets were exiled to Siberian prison camps, from which 5 million never returned. Overall, Robert Conquest estimates that Stalin murdered at least 20 million, including those who died in great, party-induced famines.

In February 1937, Ginzburg was arrested for her alleged work with a counter-revolutionary Trotskyist group at the Krasnaya Tatariia newspaper. Officials had already apprehended her communist party card (effectively itself a criminal conviction). She never participated in any such activities by in Stalinist Russia such facts did not matter. Tried in August 1937 in a 7-minute proceeding, she was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor, a great relief to her, as she had expected a death sentence.

So much Soviet era poetry, chiseled with words alone (often secret and hidden from the authorities) is so stupendously magnificent. Ginzburg, Joseph Brodsky, Anna Akhmatova, Daniil Andreev, and on and on, many like Ginzburg deeply inspired by Pushkin, stands out for its extraordinary beauty.

This finely wrought movie represents the genre and era very well.",1512604800,6,1888,5.3830508474576275

But, the acting is incredible, the poetry lovely, despite the times and the problems.

4661358,4,B005DOSETC,"I waited a very long time in great anticipation to see this movie.  It was very well done.  The acting was tremendous and the feel of the movie set the right tone for the period and the circumstances.  I read the books many years ago and whenever anyone asks me what the best books are that I have ever read I always mention the books of Eugenia Ginsburg and nobody---ever---knows who she is or what she wrote about which is a bitter shame in my opinion.  Her two volumes about her nightmarish experience as a victim of Stalin's reign of terror should be required reading for all.  In my opinion her books are far better than the Gulag Archipelago precisely because she never makes it into a political treatise grinding her own ax of grievance as did the far more well known Solzhenitzin (apologies for undoubtedly misspelling his name).  the task of attempting to tell Ginsburg's story is nearly an impossible one but this is a very good stab at it.  The books are an epic tale of survival and a quintessentially Russian tale told unmistakably by a Russian soul that endures and endures despite unimaginable horror over many years.  It would be impossible for a movie to actually capture this epic tale and do it true justice.  Again, I'd say the movie is very good and it does a good job of providing a snapshot of Ginsburg's masterwork but if you only see the movie you will not really know the tale.  This is said of many movies that adapt books to the big screen but it is particularly so in the case of Eugenia Ginsburg's books and story.  If you like the movie I would highly recommend that you seek out and read her books--and even if you don't like the movie I would urge you to read the books!  You will find you are the better for it as you descend with her into the madness of totalitarianism run amok, clinging with her to the memory of her humanity and her life and joys particularly her poetry and then emerge forever transformed albeit with deep and abiding wounds but alive despite the trauma of it all.  If nothing else, I hope the movie sparks an interest in the books and then perhaps more people will value and protect the institutions that prevent such horrors from taking place.",1508198400,5,2201,4.4725

4661362,5,B005DOSETC,Excellent movie. History buffs like myself are always interested in the untold stories such as life in a gulag.

4661363,5,B005DOSETC,"Life in the Gulag just before, during and after WW2 as experienced by literature professor Ginsberg. This jewel of a film is brilliantly based on Ginsberg's book recounting her personal circumstances being judicially persecuted into and then enduring the infamous Gulag. Along with 18 million other Russians. 5 million of whom died in the camps.
Grim story? Well,no. Rather, inspirational testament to the human spirit. But if you are going make a brilliant, engrossing and compelling movie, then you need the brilliant acting of Emily Watson.  She's at her very best in This movie. Ably directed and strongly supported by the cast.
Sure, we may have seen this kind of story before.  Watson's performance makes this one special.",1507852800,2,728,5.161016949152542

4661365,1,B005DOSETC,"It's hard to say something about nothing.  Long, drawn-out, boring, over-done 'enslaved', 'holocaust' kind of movie.  I've had close to 100 yrs of this kind of stuff and I'm over it.  People live in the past because they choose not to forgive and move on.  People lie to themselves saying they don't want to forget so that ""it doesn't happen again"".  HOOEY!.  It never STOPS happening in THEIR mind.  God said the mind IS the battlefield.  It's up to each of us to learn the truth and get rid of the lies that are rooted in the mind that produce evil.  Lies are the enemy, they ARE what's evil.  That's how evil is created.  God said he HATES a liar (lying lips).  How does it feel to be hated by God?  What the mind thinks, it CREATES.  What the mind focus'es on, the mouth SPEAKS...as in ""let there be light"".  ""God first KNEW us (in his mind) then created us.  When the spoken word enters the world from the beliefs in the mind within, man ACTS out the thoughts.  That's HOW evil or good ENTERS the WORLD, through MAN.  ""What we think we create"".  Watching and listening to a twaddle movie like this is partaking in 'evil'.  God said to think upon these things - Joy, happiness, edifying, uplifting -  ""Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise"".  DON'T think about EVIL.  What does follywood want to incite the public to think and see, hear and do but EVIL?  Why do evil-thinking humans want to create hate and division upon the rest of the human race?  Evil creates evil.  Evil's purpose is to pit brother against brother as in, ""look what you've done to us, and you gotta' pay"" kind of beliefs.  Instead of changing themselves by ditching the garbage in their minds they never stop BLAMING others for their own problems.  BLIND!  DEAF!  FOOLISH.  GET OVER IT!  DEMAND that follywood and Amazon STOP buying filth - call it what it is, EVIL.  Ask yourselves why 'you' give movies a high rating when they are produced by evil men against God?  You still don't get it, do you?",1507334400,2,2093,4.464190981432361
4661366,5,B005DOSETC,Really Good movie. Sad Story,1507075200,,28,4.8
4661367,4,B005DOSETC,"To read Ginzberg's books is to know what an exceptional, refined intellect this woman had that goes far beyond what the scope of this movie can show.  Still, it's an entry point to have a movie made from her writings.  Just like the refrain from the genocide of the Holocaust, ""Never Again."", we need solid representations of what happened to forewarn against such atrocities from fomenting and catching societies unaware.

Watson's characterization worked mostly, but I never did fully suspend my imagination of her as a native Russian.  Furthermore, this story encompasses so much more material than can be truncated into a few hours without losing much of the substance.

Another reviewer commented that the camps came down to survival.  True enough, but Ginzberg's writings honed in on themes of loyalty, betrayal, belief systems, faith, humanism, and adaptations.",1506816000,,868,5.253623188405797
4661368,4,B005DOSETC,The hardest part in viewing this film is seeing the path this country is on and how similar the current stifling of thought is becoming so prevalent.  Very scary repeat of history.  Well-acted and written.,1506729600,2,205,4.828571428571428
4661369,3,B005DOSETC,The movie itself was good. The story and acting were very good. But beware of two things. It contains some strong sexual content and some sporadic bad language. Definitely not for younger eyes. And the description says it contains English subtitles and it does not contain English or any other subtitles.,1505952000,10,304,4.980392156862745

We see a passionate family woman, a devout communist, and educator run afoul of the authorities for standing up for a dissident. who made some minor infractions.

4661372,5,B005DOSETC,"Although I first viewed this film on TV, I wanted to order it to share w/my friends.  It  presented the horrors of the Stalin regime, something everyone ought to be acquainted with, esp. millennials, who don't seem to know much about US history or worldwide history...what a pity!! Highly recommend this film.  It would be great to include it in history classes.",1481328000,3,362,4.806451612903226
4661373,5,B005DOSETC,"The front of the package for this Polish/German co-production touts the fact this it is directed by Marleen Gorris, who is responsible for the Oscar winning film Antonias Line. And maybe that will draw folks to it. (It certainly did me.). When I saw the cast list  the only name that I knew was British actress Emily Watson. All the rest were Polish Actors. Since the film takes place in the 1930s in the former Soviet Union under Stalin  I somehow expected it to be in a language other than English. But its not. The only time there are subtitles is to translate signs which are in Russian.
This is a true story  based on the letters  of the character played by Watson in an amazingly understated performance. Eugenia Ginzburg is a Jewish university professor in literature, and a member of the Communist Party when a fellow teacher tells the government that she is a traitor. What follows is many years of suffering and yet still trying to keep her sanity. Its a powerful story.

The film was made in 2008 and  apparently  was released in Europe in 2016. It was released in US- NTSC format in 6 by Corinth Films (a company that I only recently discovered) in April 2016. It has a new distributor (Film Movement) and I discovered it from the trailer on another Corinth DVD>

I don't like spoilers and  if you are reading this, you obviously haven't seen the film  I won't spoil your discovery and enjoyment (not quite the right wodc for this powerful story of survival in a political regime change)  by telling you more than the minimum.
The film is NOT RATED but there is some very graphic visuals and there is some sex but not nudity.
Thats really all you need to know. If like independent films with superb acting by actors youve never seen before (except Watson) , I urge you to check out this 110-minute film

There are no special features on the DVD except some trailers for other Corinth films.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

I love the books about the Russian experience for some odd reason and I feel this author did the subject justice without expecting one to read between the lines.  Perhaps this is the reason the books, when I first read them,  were smuggled out of Russia for publishing.  The movie made it a very basic story that turned into a love story.  I thought they missed the point of the 2 books since I did not see the books as a love story at all. The movie completely missed the real issue which was SURVIVAL.  Movie will not be watched again since it ruined the whole story for me.  I will continue to read the books yearly as long as I can see the print.",1437696000,10,750,4.166666666666667
