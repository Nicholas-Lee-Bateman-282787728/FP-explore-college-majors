1175099,4,B0000016TP,"Joan Southerland gives a masterclass of singing in this opera, she is amazing. No other character sings in the same league as Joan's. Of course it is very hard to believe in Joan Southerland's character, she doesn't seems to be from India but still is very recommendable.",1194480000,,271,4.787234042553192
1175100,5,B0000016TP,"This is indeed one of the best operas ever made, and of course,

Dame Sutherland is rightly stupendous with a superb supporting crew.

And the music is--simply divine!",1163635200,5,167,4.928571428571429
1175101,1,B0000016TP,"The only French opera I like (and I love it) is Thomas' Mignon.  Other than that, I'll stick to the Italians.  The duet between Lakme and her servant (I guess that's what she was) was weak and faint, though it was the only tune in the first hour, which is all I watched.  I was bored stiff.  I was revolted by the cute Britishers invading the sacred temple, but that was the plot.  The only other tune in Lakme that I know of is The Bell Song, and I don't like it, too modal or minor or something.  Like Ophelia's mad scene in Hamlet.  Also French.  I love the French.  I wish I were French, wish I lived in France.  Sigh.  But I don't like their operas.  Before I forget it, I want to comment on the first review of this opera.  The idea of Sutherland singing wagner is obscene.  The man was a monster and a hack composer who like sondheim has one tune to his credit and nothing else.  (The wedding march, with sondheim it's ""Send in the Clowns"".)  Unlike the the other 3 or 4 rhapsodic reviewers, I can easily see why this opera is neglected.  It has no tunes.  And this is Delibes' only ""successful"" opera on top of that.  I own the CDs of a couple of his ballets which I heard on the radio and thought I liked and therefore bought, but they're mediocre too.  The French are intellectual and intelligent.  Music isn't.  Well, it takes an intelligent person to write it of course, but it takes more than that.  Music is not France's strong suit.  Alas for Delibes.",1159747200,6,1466,4.247272727272727
1175102,4,B0000016TP,"The singing is the strongest plus of this production. All of the singers do a splendid job with their respective roles. The acting is undistinguished and the stage settings although adequate to create an appropriately lavish, indian setting smacked of plastic.

For a 30 year old production the transfer to DVD is acceptable. Non removable English sub-titles are included as is a brief description of the plot during the orchestral  prelude to each act.

This is one of my favourite operas and this production has earned itself a top shelf location among my opera DVDs.  I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD to anyone who has an interest in either Lakme and/or Joan Sutherland.",1158537600,27,676,5.008928571428571
1175103,4,B0000016TP,"While this production of Lakme is far from perfect, the opportunity to see a rarely performed work of extreme lyrical beauty featuring the great Joan Sutherland in one of her signature roles is more than enough justification for purchasing the DVD.

Lakme is an unfairly neglected opera, more known for its showpieces than for the work as a whole, and it is difficult to understand why. Personally, I think audiences would take to this score, which is chockful of memorable melodies and is obviously influenced by Bizet, because of its post-Carmen sound(especially apparent in the orchestration) mixed with the exoticism that was so popular in French opera at that time. Granted, Lakme lacks the depth of Carmen, the uniqueness, the sheer untethered ingenuity, not to mention the standout characters, and the romantic connection here seems forced and unconvincing. Basically, it's all about the music, but what music. Lakme might be fluff, but fluff has seldom sounded better.

The title role is a great one for any dramatic lyrical soprano, since the Indian princess is onstage for much of the opera and is given a plethora of lovely music, from the well-known Bell Song and Flower Duet to some very moving introspective arias(my personal favorite is Act Three's Sous le ciel tour etoile...just devastating) to a couple of long winding love duets, finally to a dramatic death scene. Basically, Lakme is the soprano's baby all the way, a showcase for a true diva, and Dame Joan Sutherland is a diva-and-a-half.

This production was obviously done with the intention of promoting her above everything else. The performance is by the Australian Opera, where Sutherland is both a beloved native and a familiar presence, practically royalty, and it is led by her doting husband Richard Bonynge who conducts with loving attention to her voice. The supporting cast, lacking any big names, is serviceable but unspectacular(the inconsistent tenor gets an understandably tepid response from the audience during  his curtain call), as though the powers that be were careful not to cast anyone who might upstage Dame Joan. This makes for a less fulfilling performance overall. Still, if you are going to revolve a whole production around a single performer, you can't do better than Joan Sutherland, and the diva doesn't disappoint.

This was done in the mid-70's when Dame Joan was probably a few years past her prime, yet you would hardly know it based on her performance; the only weakness I could detect was the occasional tendency not to sustain some of the high notes for as long as she would have in her youth. Otherwise, the voice, that incredible voice, is still there, in all its power and glory, in all its heartbreaking beauty. Sutherland has never been known for her physical pulchritude, or for her acting ability, her main strength, aside from that distinctive voice, is a little thing called presence. Here she is as regal, as feminine, as strong-willed, as powerful, as larger-than-life as ever.

Bonynge has a reputation for being a by-the-numbers conductor, and that is in evidence here. He brings out the score's inherent beauty, but loses much of the passion(his reading from the '60's for Decca Records, also with his wife, is better, more definitive, but he is helped along by an abler cast). The production is pretty and colorful, appropriately atmospheric and exotic(giving a real sense of place) if a bit crowded for the somewhat compact stage. The picture and sound quality are superior for a broadcast from that era.

Vanity projects don't often succeed, but this is an exception. It helps to have a centerpiece with the chops of Joan Sutherland. And to have the lovely music of Leo Delibes, of course.",1153785600,48,3719,5.017828200972447
1175104,5,B0000016TP,"I tend to favour Wagnerian operas, so up until now my only exposure to Joan Sutherland's voice was her performance as the woodland bird in Solti's Siegfried.

I had no idea her voice was so magnificent; flawless notes from the lower register up into the stratosphere. And what warmth and expression; I now understand why she was described as the voice of the century.

What a shame she never performed Brunnhilde (as far as I know).

As far as the production itself is concerned, the sound is a bit ragged, and shows signs of heavy noise reduction. I suppose that means that we'll never see this production on DVD. Pity.",1109548800,13,620,4.618181818181818
1175105,4,B0000016TP,"For those of us who don't live in New York or somewhere in Italy, the reservations expressed by other reviewers seem a touch finicky.  We may live near enough to see a good local opera company sometimes, but what I'd give if my local company were Australia Opera!  The orchestra and performers, including fine guest dancers, are excellent.

Certainly the quality of the recording isn't what we've come to take for granted, but as a DVD transfer from a VHS tape made in the 70s, it's pretty darn good.  Dame Joan is not at her peak, but on a bad day she could still break your heart.  The tenor is a bit adolescent as her lover but he holds up very well.  If we don't want to see close-ups of imperfect faces and physiques, we can close our eyes.

I've never seen an opera I didn't wish someone had asked me to direct, but this staging is unobjectionable.  Rejoice at the chance to see this memorable production with this blessed soprano.  We will not see her like again.",1362787200,3,970,4.404494382022472
1175106,4,B0000016TP,"Obviously a dated production but as this opera is seldom performed today it was our only chance to see it. The music has become very familiar due to its use in television and radio advertising so it was very nice to hear it in context.
Quality was excellent.",1356480000,,258,4.395833333333333
1175107,5,B0000016TP,What can I say. Joan is a hottie in this gorgeous story of an impossible romance between a Hindu princess and a British officer. The aria in act one is worth the price of admission.,1303257600,,181,4.2
1175108,5,B0000016TP,"Why some of the top 100 operas and ballets have been left alone by the powers that be who produce these for DVD or Blu ray is sometimes a mystery. I have a list of these. We had to wait a long time for a visually and audibly satisfying Faust (Gounod) till this year. Wonder when they will produce a hi-def Samson et Delilah (Saint Sains) with the ballet in it, or ballets like La Boutique Fantasque (never produced for the small screen to the best of my knowledge) and/or Gaite Parisienne where one has to content oneself with a 1950s film... This applies to Lakme as well, to an extent.

The video is not as grainy as one might expect, but if viewed on a 40+ inch HD TV may appear muddy. It has 'ingrained' if I may put it that way, subtitles in English. They cant be switched off... no complaints. Audio is just about as good as it can get, given the time of the recording. No complaints there either.

The singing and the eye to detail - those factors make this DVD worth possessing. One is totally taken in by Joan Sutherland's voice and its clarity and absolute control - whether singing the delicate lyrical pieces that dominate most of the opera or for that matter the bel-canto portions especially in the 'Bell Aria'. The supporting cast, although overshadowed by Sutherland's reputation and singing is just about as good as it can possibly get. Absolutely everyone.

The eye to detail is simply magnificent. The costumes, Indian dances and the props are as authentic as they can get (except Sutherland's own costume). The dances in the second act are fabulous. Yes, they are a slightly westernized and sanitized version of some classical Indian dances, but luckily without caricaturization of them. I hope any future versions of these don't make them look like something danced in some unrealistic exotic dance bars. The deities, the idols and the costumes are as near to the real thing and unoffensive as they can get.

I have no hesitation in giving this DVD the maximum. This recording would familiarize one almost instantly with the music and approach that would be a benchmark for any future productions of this rather instantly enjoyable Opera. If the lack of hi-def bothers you, you can switch the TV off and still enjoy the sound... BUY IT.",1293667200,2,2257,4.635

The staging and setup is really is well done. It makes one feel like they are really are in India or in some tropical jungle.

The different singers perform at a very high level of musicality and ability, hitting the notes with perfection and in time with the orchestra. They support Joan very well in her role of Lakme. There is a wonderful flow and lyric about the singers and how they direct the flow of the music so it stays together, is not choppy, but adds a real harmony, both within the intonation and together as a group or solo.

Joan does a great job too. She is kind of darker than what I would have thought, but even at this point in her career she is able to hit the highest notes with clear intonation, perfect, brilliance and shine.

The acting is also well done. The way the singers come together as part of the story beyond the music, whether talking, standing, facial expressions, staging and costumes. It's very convening of what the actual (non musical event) might have looked like.

The only beef is the quality of the video isn't the best and sometimes the lights do odd things. Then again, this was recorded almost forty years ago.",1266537600,,1598,5.787234042553192

I was going to see this opera but I wanted to get familiar with it because I only knew the ""flower duet"", I bought this DVD, it was the only one I found, but knowing that Lakme was being performed by Joan Sutherland I was sure it would be a good selection.
All the cast sang very well, overstating! , but the acting that must convinced me was that of Clifford Grant as Nilakantha.
Beautiful music with a wonderful orchestra director, the scenery and costumes are colorful and beautiful.
The dancing in the second act was uneven.
The sound was great.
I am glad I've purchased this DVD, I enjoyed very much.",1237075200,2,946,6.221374045801527
1175111,4,B0000016TP,"First, simply to emphasize the point, the DVD version by Kultur, unlike the VHS, does have English subtitles, and, yes, they are embedded. To most non-specialist viewers the subtitles are a major plus (as Beverly Sills who introduced surtitles to America has pointed  out is true of live performances); I cannot speak for those who can follow the French language of the production.
Second, ignoring comparisons with other productions or other works in which Joan Sutherland appeared, focusing only on what is to be seen and heard in the performance which I have just seen on the TV screen, I can only say that, to me, it was quite a delight, visually rich with color,and, replete with garlands of wonderful melodies,
for the most part, admirably sung.
As have some reviewers, I found the lead tenor to be without the vocal or physical stature to allow Sutherland to be seen as the young, innocent girl of her father's description. What was required was a six foot four inch tower of vocal strength. However, the other singers were adequate to the demands made upon them, if not of the highest caliber.
All in all, a fine staging of what could be a great Broadway hit, and, I should think, a production which will provide viewers with an evening of rich pleasure.
A note on comparisons: By no stretch of imagination can Joan Sutherland match the performance of Lily Pons, who owned the role for decades at the Met, in concerts and on radio. However, it is equally true that Lily Pons could not match the statuesque presence and sound of Sutherland. Two styles, two appearances, two wonderful voices, neither with the acting ability that is increasingly being demanded. Better or worse need not be the judgment of a viewer with no intention other than find pleasure in a performance; each is distinctive, both can entertain, one or both, may impress mightily or disappoint. Each of us sees and hears differently, emotionally reacts differently. Take what is your cup of tea regardless of how others may react.",1230336000,2,2007,4.817391304347826
1175112,4,B0000016TP,"For being just 3 months short of her 50th birthday, Sutherland sounds and looks good.  Not her absolute prime, but still pretty good, except that she really didn't make the high E-flat at the end of the Bell Song, which ended up being a short squeak.  She shows up in some gorgeous gowns, almost all of them which are low cut and show some cleavage.  I've never seen an Indian woman showing cleavage.  Who did their research?  Though the huge size of Sutherland's voice and her overall size in general are great for a role like Norma, Dame Joan is not the ideal Lakme for film.  Nevertheless, I am very glad that this video is available.  It is not an opera that is often performed or recorded.  Perhaps one of the reasons is that it really is pretty boring!  You have to be a hardcore opera fan to enjoy it.
  The other singers are adequate.  The picture quality, color, and sound are excellent.  They really did an amazing job remastering this 1976 analog video.",1219449600,4,964,4.471264367816092
1175113,3,B0000016TP,"I won't comment on her supporting cast or production (other comments have covered those topics thoroughly), but I'd like to provide an alternate opinion of Dame Joan in this role. I find her sound much too covered and mature-sounding for Lakme. She really sticks out singing with Delibes' butter-smooth lyrical orchestrations. I love Dame Joan, but her singing is a bit choppy and dark. Especially Lakme's entrance prayer, but also in the entire role, I kept wishing for a brighter, lighter, and more easily-produced sound. If you're looking for a stellar cast and a singer that fits the title role like a glove, I would suggest the Dessay recording.

That said, if you've never heard Dame Joan's interpretations of the great bel canto heroines (Lucia, Lecrezia Borgia, Anna Bolena, etc.) please do, because her covered, dark sound is much better suited for those roles, and they are the roles for which she became legendary.

One last thing - don't neglect Lakme as an opera because it's not very commonly performed. It's very difficult to stage because of the voices needed for the principle roles and because of the setting, but it's a delightful opera. It is indeed very French-sounding; what beautiful music Delibes has created.",1213747200,11,1233,5.009756097560976
1175114,4,B0000016TP,"Joan Sutherland is again featured in this Opewra Australia production in a role which she made her own. Having seen photos of Lily Pons in the role of Lakme one may wish for a more alluring leading lady, but the Pons voice could never hold a candle to Dame Sutherland. This is a strong cast and Delibes is a master of this peculiarly French style of music. Just be aware that you are not going to see the musical counterpart to ""The Matrix."" There is not a dull musical moment in the whole production, and it is imaginatively staged. One does not go to the opera for great drama, except perhaps in Wagner when you get little else. (Rumpole was right: ""Wagner's music is really not as bad as it sounds."") It is not likely that you will have many chances during your lifetime to see and hear this composition.",1195689600,3,807,4.386666666666667
