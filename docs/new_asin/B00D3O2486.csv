MARIA STUARDA-Donizetti (4.2 stars)  2008
Performance: 4.8 stars
Staging: 3.0 stars
Mariella Devia is Maria Stuarda. Francesco Meli is Roberto, Conte di Leicester. Anna Caterina Antonacci is Elisabetta II. Antonio Fogliani conducts. Excellent performances. Devia, about 60 years of age, sings an amazing Maria. The performances are degraded by the scenery. Throughout the entire opera the whole stage is a prison made of bars. It is a constant distraction.

SIMON BOCCANEGRA-Verdi (4.7 stars)  2010
Plcido Domingo is Simon Boccanegra. Ferruccio Furlanetto is Jacapo Fiesco. Anja Harteros is Maria/Amelia. Daniel Barenboim conducts. Excellent singing. Acting is sometimes excellent, sometimes just standing and singing. Some scenery is abstract.
