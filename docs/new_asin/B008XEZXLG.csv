5189287,5,B008XEZXLG,"Gordon Liu (Chia Hui Liu) is a veteran and legendary Kung Fu master, whose career has included some 102 films as an actor. You have probably seen him on Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" movies. He is back in the exciting ""Kill `Em All,"" a film with a second title that goes ""I'm going to hell when I die."" And let me tell you, this is one quite riveting ride that you will truly enjoy - martial arts at its best.

The story takes place in Bangkok, and it opens with four professional assassins - three men, one woman --, each one independently performing hits on different targets. Once their missions are completed and they are relaxing, they are in turn kidnapped and taken to an undisclosed location. When they wake up, they find out that they and other four are inside the ""killing chamber,"" where ""hit men are taken to die."" Very soon they hear the voice of Snakehead (Liu), who informs them that they would be fighting with each other to death, with the last remaining one allowed to stay alive. It is ""comply or die,"" as Snakehead says, and the first one dies before combat, just for being impatient. Once they win a combat, they are allowed to enter a special room filled with weapons, and they are advised to take one. If, for some reason, they don't obey orders, the room is filled with gas. In addition, even if they manage to escape, there are more deadly obstacles ahead.

Directed by Raimund Huber, ""Kill `Em All"" is smart and dynamic, and, when you think that you know the end of the film, it takes another turn. In some way, it reminded me of ""Game of Death,"" Bruce Lee's final film. The last martial arts scene is priceless, one of the best that I have seen. The cast is fantastic, and, in addition to Liu, it includes Johnny Messner, Ammara Siripong, Joe Lewis (veteran kickboxer, who died in 2012 at age 68), Tin Man, and others. This is one engaging movie, for sure. (USA, 2112, color, 86 min).

5189288,5,B008XEZXLG,"This film is really fun with tons of action and lots and lots of different fight scenes. The film is a contained action film that pits the best assassins against each other in a ""killing chamber"" where they are forced to fight to the death until they can escape and take down the diabolical madman behind the twisted game of death.

This was the last film of martial arts legend Joe Lewis.

This is not a big budget, splashy Hollywood film but I can tell you that it delivers on all cylinders. If you are just looking to forget things for a couple of hours and have a blast watching tons of fighting and action, then Kill Em All is the movie for you!",1353888000,5,650,4.233870967741935

The acting was kind of poor but i was solely in it for the fight scenes and not too much more. There are a lot of them and you really get to see everyone's style of fighting instead of just say only kung fu style. I have seen a few of the people in the film before but have never seen THE KID ( actor Tim Man ) and was glad he was in this. He's a BEAST! I would love to see him and Tony Jaa in a movie together side by side as lead roles. The action in that movie would be insane. Think about it! The Ong Bak movies along with the Protector are some of my favorite movies simply because they are so action packed, which is what i look for mostly because alot of the times the story line is weak.

5189304,4,B008XEZXLG,"Coming off the heels of other recent, impressive fight flicks like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Raid/dp/B0085A9J18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Raid</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Soldier-Day-of-Reckoning/dp/B00A34LX9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning</a>&nbsp;is ""Kill 'Em All,"" the second film to receive a wide release from director Raimund Huber (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bangkok-Adrenaline/dp/B003X3BY74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bangkok Adrenaline</a>) who's in the process of perfecting the style of Thailand-set, Thai-looking action films made by a westerner. In contrast to its direct competition, ""Kill 'Em All"" is relatively small in scale and has sections of the story which definitely could have been written better, but it's still a remarkable powerhouse of diverse fight choreography done right, relatively intriguing characters, and a well-executed premise.

The story: eight ace assassins are drugged, kidnapped, and awaken in an enclosed ""killing chamber"" where a voice over a loudspeaker (Gordon Liu,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill/dp/B00005JMUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill</a>) instructs them how they're expected to kill eachother until only one remains. It will take ingenuity and persistence on their parts to find their way out of this alive.

The first half of this picture feels like a martial arts-themed take on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw/dp/B0006SSOHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw</a>, with the characters stuck in the room and being subjected to the instructions that pit them in one-on-one showdowns. Though some of the assassins are obviously expendable (e.g. poor&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Erik-Schuetz/dp/B0009VBTQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Erik Schuetz</a>, still waiting for a good role), there's a good deal more genuine acting and personality-exposition going on during this part of the film than one might expect, resulting in the viewer being able to take a genuine interest in some of the fighters beyond their action scenes. The majority of the acting falls upon the only real thespian of the bunch, non-martial artist Johnny Messner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tears-of-the-Sun/dp/B000095WW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tears of the Sun</a>), and while an okay character, I think he's the most detracting part of the film, having been written as overly talkative and sarcastic, especially in the second half. Additionally, while the second and more conventional half of the film might disappoint some viewers who had really gotten into the setup of the first half (for the record, I wasn't), it's the eventual reveal of the master plan behind the whole plot that's universally disappointing and that keeps the movie from a five-star rating.

However, like the best martial arts pictures, this one's fourteen fight scenes dutifully pick up the slack where the story falls short. Having seen the movie only recently, I can confidently state that karate flicks of the New Year have their work cut out for them in matching the action of ""Kill 'Em All."" Much of it, of course, has to do with the fine casting of unique fighters. There are acrobatic tricksters (e.g. Rashid Phoenix), hard-edged muay thai exponents (e.g. the uncredited ""Black Scorpion"" character), physical powerhouses (e.g. the male lead henchman), realism-based hand-to-hand practitioners (e.g. the late karate god Joe Lewis,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Cage/dp/B000H5U5H6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Cage</a>), and several more. Equally important to the strength of the fights is the truly masterful choreography by star/fight wrangler Tim Man. While not every brawl in the film is a grade-A affair, Man shows great ingenuity in not only allowing each of the performers to play to their physical strengths and therein nullifying the need for stunt doubles, but also in matching the subsequent diverse styles of the fighters harmoniously: even for the final showdown when a methodical kickboxer (Ammara Siripong,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chocolate/dp/B001L67A4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chocolate</a>), a grounded kung fu practitioner (Gordon Liu), and an acrobatic fighter (Tim Man) are pitted in combat, no fighter has to modify his style for the others, resulting in a very unique match.

Personally, I think this feature is unique enough just for being the last movie of the departed Joe Lewis' sporadic film career, which had been hit & miss thus far but I'm glad that his last one could be a winner. Though he died just months before this one's DVD release at age 68, his performance is stellar: despite appearing heavyset and visibly aged, Lewis' character gets a look in his eyes when it's time to fight that makes you believe he's going to sincerely beat the stuffing out of someone, and his rough, practical moves back it up. This aspect and all the rest accumulate for a very good martial arts flick - definitely one of the best of last year. Pick it up!",1358208000,8,5386,6.53921568627451
5189305,2,B008XEZXLG,"I was having high hopes for Kill'em all, but was left disppointed at the lack of creativity and enjoyment of this movie.
it had what seemed to be an interesting plot, the idea behind it sounded cool and intriguing, but the delivery of that idea was below what is expected.
the plot involves a group of highly professional assassins who got kidnapped and locked into a bunker together by a madman who forces them to play his game and fight each other to escape, with no clear reason or motive behind that, probably for his own sick entertainment.
the fight scenes in the film were impressive to some extent, some well choreographed fight scenes that involve mainly martial arts, but they add nothing new to the hundreds of action films out there.

the lead actress had some impressive moves and a cool sexy outfit, very delicious to look at.

generally, the acting was just awful, very rigid and lame, those people seem like professional athletes, but just don't cut it as actors which really harmed this movie big time.

the script and dialog was just as awful if not the worst i've ever seen in a movie, just awful writing, that nothing smart comes out of those actors, lame and boring dialog that i just screamed please shut up once a conversation starts !

Add to that a lame villain that looks like an Asian version of Blofeld of the Bond films. a bold villain in a grey suit with some good fighting skills actually, he also have an army of psychopaths and ninjas that ultimately fight our heroes.
"" one might ask why don't he just use his ninjas to fight each other for entertainment ? ""

the effects were also below average when explosions were involved, something that can be made with a simple editing program on your laptop.

picture quality and sound are what is expected nowadays, good cleen and smooth picture, but since it was a low budget, the picture does not have the film look that the big budget films have.

so generally, a boring film for the most part, low grade B film with only some good fight scenes as its positive, otherwise,atrocious acting and an avoidable B film that adds nothing new or special out of all the hundreds of B action films out there.",1358208000,,2177,4.538265306122449
5189306,4,B008XEZXLG,"I bought this for Gordon Liu and his prescence throughout is a treat, especially in the final fight scene. Basically, Kill 'Em All is Saw meets The Raid: Redemption with Gordon as the Jigsaw character, Snakehead. Several assassins are kidnapped and forced to battle each other and Snakehead's fighters for freedom. I would have preferred Scott Adkins or even Luke Goss over Johnny Messner and I wasn't crazy about Joe Lewis who died of Cancer shortly after the film was finished. He had a great Martial Arts career though and I guess the filmmakers wanted to give him something. The majority of the film takes place inside The Killing Chamber and like The Raid and Dredd made me feel claustrophobic after awhile. Other than that, the endless fight scenes are amazing. Gordon shows why he's still The Master Killer when he battles rising star, Tim Man and Chocolate's Zom Ammara in the finale. I felt that he was wasted in Blood Money and The Man With The Iron Fists so I appreciated his fight with the youngsters. I guess he's recovered from his 2011 stroke because he's awesome here. Overall, Kill 'Em All is fun weekend stuff. A few more outdoor scenes plus better all around casting and it could have been special. Hopefully, we'll see more of The Master Killer in upcoming films where he gets to flex his inimitable style.",1357948800,2,1326,4.719827586206897

Simply put: recognized bad people (assassins, contract killers, psychotics that just like to kill because they don't know right from wrong, etc.) are all drugged and than put together in a room to be challenged amongst each other to fight to the kill, just to satisfy some sicko that wanted to make this all happen, only for his own personal viewing pleasure.

Some fights ensue, some of the killing candidates want to talk rationally and reasonably to recognize the whole idea is dumb (as we the watching audience feels) just to please some ""nutcase"" who wants to entertain only himself with arranging death matches.

If this film were a book, it would be a bore beyond belief, even if it had pictures.
