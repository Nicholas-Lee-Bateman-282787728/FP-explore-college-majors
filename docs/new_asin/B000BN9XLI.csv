8515612,3,B000BN9XLI,"Released prior to the 87 season so it obviously does not include footage from the recent golden era in the 90s.  In fact the most reason clip was from 1983.  Because the running time is relatively brief (30 mins), it is a nice piece of nostalgia for the casual fan or someone learning about Yankee history for the first time.  (For those looking for a longer, more expansive film, there are other good vhs and dvds).  Also some of the moments are really more like compilations of clips from a player's career.  The main positive of the tape is that it includes TV or radio calls for most of the moments and keeps commentary to a minimum.  Counting down, the moments selected are:

10.  Reggie Jackson's 3 homers in 77 World Series- inc. a minute or so intro of the 77 season.  Main drawback here is that the homerun footage is taken from the MLB film and not the TV broadcast.

9.  Chris Chambliss' walk-off home run 76 ALCS- begins with a brief intro to the ALCS between the Yankees and Royals it then shows George Brett's game tying homer followed by Chambliss' game winner.  Uses the TV broadcast plus the Yankees radio broadcast so you get to hear Bill White's memorable call.

8.  Dave Righetti's No-hitter July 4, 1983.  Summary of Rag's no-hit game with Mel Allen's TV call.

7.  Mickey Mantle - Really more of a compilation of Mantle clips it focuses on his triple crown 1956 season.

6.  1978- AL East Playoff game- Recaps the Yankee comeback of 1978 and the famous Bucky Dent home run.

5.  Joe DiMaggio's 56 Game hit streak

4. Don Larson's Perfect game- call by Bob Wolff

3.  Highlights from Babe Ruth's Career

2.  Highlights from Lou Gehrig's career

1.  Roger Maris' 61 homers in 1961- includes the Scooter's famous call.

Once again the main drawback is that its rather short.  Its just too difficult to choose 10 moments from a team with so much in history.  It would be virtually impossible today with all the moments in the late 90s.",1220659200,,1953,4.510028653295129
