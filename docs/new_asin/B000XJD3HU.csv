3002709,4,B000XJD3HU,"Technically brilliant, considering the subject -- fast-paced camera, excellent cuts, thoughtful shot angles.

Mr. Dresnok, living in Pyongyang since 1962, does the narrative himself. He comes across as a convivial, honest, lying, brutal character, you name it, and saddened beyond repair. ""You do not like fishing?"", a North Korean sitting next to him at the river remarks casually, causing Mr. Dresnok to ever so slightly draw a hasty cigarette drag.

There it is, the truth of a squandered life in an alien country. The Korean angler sensed it.

There is a certain twisted authenticity to him, a bullyish bonhomy that makes him look almost great to have a beer with at a sports bar at one moment, and look sadistic without further advance notice the next, with nothing but just seconds to spare inbetween.

The famous defector foe/friend (it's hard to tell at times) Robert Jenkins, now relocated to Japan, gets an earful from Mr. Dresnok for having spilled some truths. At that moment, Mr. Dresnok's outrage is a staged emotion, given the Party cadre sitting next to him. The documentary seems to not be entirely fair and balanced on this particular subject, although it serves as an interesting ""audio et altera pars"" to Mr. Jenkins' autobiography.

Mr. Dresnok, though, knows what his former rocky yet close relationship to the re-defected defector Jenkins calls for: some harsh words, that come across as totally insincere. In the end, this unhappy man is a simple soul who turned himself in for life at a moment's whim.

He genuinely loves his likeable grown-up son who has ""Richmond, VA Caucasian college student"" written all over his face, yet does barely speak English with a pronounced Korean accent and is going to be, of all choices, a North Korean diplomat.

Mr. Dresnok would also love to see his native Virginia one more time. He probably won't. He chokes up when the British filmmaker presents him with contemporary images of his childhood town, and lets him watch a Quicktime movie on an Apple notebook of former friends talking about him. Apart from his love for his family, that is the only genuine deep emotion Mr. Dresnok allows himself to show.

An excellent documentary about the strangest of fates young men can visit upon themselves.",1205280000,28,2259,4.957671957671957
3002710,4,B000XJD3HU,"I saw this documentary at a local video store and I am glad I rented it. James Dresnok (spelling?) had a less than stellar life growing up. Neglected as a child and never finding his way to the ""American Dream"" he ended up in the Army on the DMZ. A documentary crew was allowed to go to North Korea to interview Mr. Dresnok who has spent his life since 1962 in that Stalinist state. It's an interesting documentary as it also points out that three other soldiers defected to North Korea around the same time. Dresnok is an interesting interview and his ""escape"" across the minefields, his interrogation by North Korean leaders and his ""fame"" as a ""movie star"" in North Korea portraying the U.S. as the Imperalist Evil General in their movies was fascinating to say the least.

Dresnok is a likable person at times and at other times I sat and wondered just how sad he really is in his life. Still, he seems content and he paints an interesting portrayal of life as a man, a husband and a father to his children in North Korea. When the documentary was over I learned a little bit about North Korea and about an American who found his ""peace"" in that Stalinist regime.",1203465600,12,1167,4.453271028037383

3002716,4,B000XJD3HU,"Made in response to the memoirs written by another Army defector to North Korea, Charles Jenkins, Dresnok is the last remaining American defector still living in North Korea.  He makes no apologies for his defection and downplays any mistreatment the NK's gave the Americans in the initial years of their detention there (according to Jenkins).  Given the terrible circumstances of his upbringing in the US, Dresnok probably made the right decision for himself to defect and live in North Korea.  An uneducated bully of a man without any real family in America, had he never defected he was probably doomed to a lifetime of dead end jobs, booze and jail in America.  In North Korea he became a celebrity in their movie industry, playing villainous American characters, received a pension from the NK gov't, married, had kids and had a steady supply of booze.  His kids all went to college, something that almost certainly wouldn't have happened for him had he stayed in America.",1431302400,,978,4.939024390243903

3002722,5,B000XJD3HU,"I had to watch this documentary a few times.  The production value is very good.  The editing, the music, and the overall presentation keeps ones attention.  This was the first time I had learned of Joseph Dresnok.  Heck...this is the first I had learned of defectors from the US military by crossing the DMZ to North Korea back in the 60's.  After watching this documentary a handful of times it allowed me to make an assessment as to the ""he said, he said"" nature of this documentary.  You have to decide the sincerity of each person and their story/side of things.  We aren't being told everything entirely from either side but there are a lot of inconsistencies in enough stories being told that one can make their own assessment.  I'm trying to explain this without giving away the entire documentary story line.

Aside from the psychological nature of this documentary and the political nature it does have a human side to it that has inconsistencies in how the defectors met their wives and what the actual intentions were with their Caucasian Korean speaking children.  Dresnok is quite emotional over his children but I almost get this sense that one of his children aren't all that close with Dresnok.

By releasing this documentary it gives North Korea the opportunity to present their society to the rest of the world that do not have access to it.  To say the least it's very engaging, and I feel, doesn't have a boring moment in the film.

If you are only familiar with the Korean war and have very little background on the history of that war and its motives this is a very good documentary to watch.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in varying cultures, governments, and attempting to figure out the motivations of people going against what the government otherwise detests and presents propaganda to the people so two societies personify such hatred towards one another.

What adjectives will you use to describe the characters at the end of this documentary.  Those adjectives will define your belief structure that you are instilled with.  This is one of the best documentaries I've seen in years.",1411084800,2,2127,4.799450549450549

He had a horrible childhood and couldn't catch a break, but his belligerent attitude reflected in his own words does not win him him much sympathy.

3002735,5,B000XJD3HU,"James Dresnock and 3 other American soldiers leave their posts at the 38 degree parallel to live in North Korea.  Each has personality issues and troubled pasts that led to their military service, none fair well in the controlled military lifestyle and thus they abandon their posts.  Once the North Korean's realize that these men are not spies but have chosen to abandon their 'capitalistic barbarianism', they are treated like royalty.  In return, they are used in propaganda films, as ceremonial figureheads to decry the wickedness of the capitalistic system.

James Joseph ""Joe"" Dresnock is the primary focus of this film.  Joe seems full of contradictions some which may be attributed to his past before seeking asylum and most probably a result of his speech restrictions as a representative of North Korea.  He grew up abused, then abandoned spending 6 years in a foster home run by a strict minister.  At 16, he ran away and joined the army.  He married a local church member before shipping out, upon his return, she requests a divorce, telling him she is in love with someone else.  He reenlists hoping to loose himself in a military career and creating a new life.  When he is assigned to the dangerous and boringly repetitive job of locating mines along the DMZ, he finds happiness with a local prostitute he wishes to marry.  He is denied by his superiors.  Despairing of his circumstances, while on duty, he escapes to North Korea seeking asylum in 1962.  Once the North Koreans realize he is not a spy, he becomes their trademark for propaganda demonstrating the tyranny of capitalism, with Joe, epitomizing the desire of American's to escape the brutality of the system.  Soon three (3) other men also escape for various reasons into North Korea, all of them apparently unhappy men with rough upbringing and finding no solace in a military lifestyle.

Joe often appears guarded although he attempts a genial uneducated persona.  He is anything but this, as the interview progresses, it is obvious that he is astute and quite clever.  His emphasis that he didn't finish high school does not diminish the fact that he manipulates any situation to his greatest possible benefit.

He embraces the superior treatment he is given by the North Koreans.  He enjoyed his film career and public relations duties.  At one point, he relates how the government has always given he and the other American asylum seekers greater quantities of food allotments and other privileges. During a recent famine, he and his family continued to get the same rations, while large numbers of N. Koreans died of starvation.  He has no remorse over their suffering, but he expresses gratitude that they loved him so much that they starved so he would not go hungry (he seems to portray that this was a consensual act of the community and not a decision by party leadership).

One of the other men married a Japanese woman, who had been kidnapped by the North Koreans.  Another man married a Lebanese woman, whom had been on a tourist visa and returned home pregnant.  Her family sent her back to N. Korea because she was a disgrace to the family since she was unmarried. The other married a Korean woman (he died quite young).  All those who fled had at least one son.  Of those shown in the film, all looked either extremely Caucasian (particularly Joe's two blond sons, who show no Asian features).  All received superior levels of education not available to the general population.  Joe's two son's were studying languages focusing on English, Joe claimed they would most likely have careers as ""diplomats"" though the general consensus was that they would serve as spies.  These men and their families really had unique life experiences compared to their Korean neighbors.  With only one exception, they married women that were not raised in the traditional Korean culture.  When Joe is interviewed he is filmed with his third wife (his second wife, a Korean, had died very young).  His present wife was the child of a Togolese diplomat and a Korean woman, so most likely her upbringing was not typical to other Korean's as she looked much more Togolese than Korean, she appeared to be at least 20 or 30 years younger than Joe.

There seemed to be a great deal of tension between the four men.  Joe had been the leader (he was the first to seek asylum) of the two other American men.  When Robert Jenkins (4th defector) was welcomed by North Koreans, he was given more preferential treatment since he brought an American Rifle that the Koreans had great interest in studying.  The other two men also preferred Robert.  Joe attempted to downplay his bitterness, perhaps even hatred toward Robert.  Though Robert claimed extensive abuse at Joe's hands, with multiple assaults and broken bones, which when asked, Joe emphatically denies. However, later Joe says they may have had a minor altercation -a drunken brawl.  When asked for clarification, he responds maybe it was more than once; he once again makes a claim that Robert is a notorious liar and he was intentionally misrepresenting their relationship.

All in all, this is a look at a small sample of men, who never really fit in anywhere.  In their attempt at finding happiness, they went to extremes, only to never really be a part of their new culture either.

The filming was probably very limited in its scope, at the beginning we see a North Korean sitting next to Joe during the interview leaving the impression that communism isn't the ""free lifestyle"" portrayed.  At times, I thought that there was much more to a story that may have been edited, but without any clarity as to what or why information was missing.  This made the film seem incomplete and unbalanced even possibly biased (which may have been at the behest of the North Koreans?).",1390435200,3,5801,4.8397565922920895
3002736,5,B000XJD3HU,"As a troubled young soldier stationed in South Korea, Joseph Dresnok made the fateful decision to cross the DMZ rather than face a court-martial. Upon his arrival on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Drednock was taken by communist troops. Soon his voice was heard over giant DMZ loudspeakers telling other Americans in South Korea to defect. His face would also be seen in DPRK movies, where he inevitably played an evil American.

Following the death of Kim il-Sung this film crew was permitted over a period of many months to interview Dresnok, his family and associates. One of them was Jenkins, another American soldier who defected during the 1960s. Jenkins would later return to the U.S. and make allegations which Dresnok had to refute. His brainwashing in the cult of personality is clear from this film... and more than a little scary.

One is left to wonder how different his life would've been if he didn't feel so desperate back in 1952. Also, getting the ""rock star"" treatment from the DPRK officials certainly made life easier for him than for the average North Korean. This is not a knock on him; he appears to be the kind of person who doesn't need much in order to be happy. I only started to wonder about his convictions near the end, when contrasted with clips of another defector who eventually returned to the USA. Still, taken at face value, the man seems happy, and perhaps tellingly, rather apolitical.

Having said that the film when it was not about him was good, the North Korean people when being filmed came across as friendly.

Having said that the picture of North Korea ranges throughout the film from sympathetic to horrific. The central character of the film - One of the first four defectors that the film is about - is also both a sympathetic and tragic figure and also one who at times seems simply to be a horrible man in terms of honor or courage.

I expected the film to try and gain my sympathy or to show me that Joe was a traitor and a look at how horrible life is in North Korea. Instead, overall it left me feeling pretty neutral and apathetic about the whole situation. The film presents a choice that Joe had in his life and shows what happened based on that choice.

He probably lived a better life as a turn coat. But only because that is what he was. A hero in the twisted place they call the People's Republic of North Korea. A wife and two sons that are treated like the landed elite. What more can one ask for?

Communist living obviously took it's toll on him. Little things like the gold teeth. And the way he smokes his cigarettes down to the filter.

Joe Dresnok defects one day while patrolling the DMZ between North and South Korea.  It was an impulse decision that has shaped the rest of his life. He has live his adult life in North Korea and recounts that life in this documentary.  I am stunned that the filmmakers were able to get this made, quite frankly.

He talks about his reasons for defecting, his life in the army and before joining. He recognizes that the strong father figure that communist Korea made out of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il appealed to him as a child of a broken home.

The documentary also explores the lives of the other three American defectors and Dresnok speaks of them freely as well.

He is a riveting personality and narrates his story with real authority.

However, their alternative fates at that time in the US military were certainly unattractive to them. Dresnok was about to be court-martialed. Another was going to be deployed to Vietnam into a combat position. At the time of their defection they were likely OK with committing suicide as they did not know what awaited them as they crossed over the line.

My guess is they were likely very useful to the North Korean government in teaching English for North Korean's to gain access to scientific information as well as teaching American customs to spies. Dresden obviously had very little contact with his son growing up or the boy would have spoken better English. The whole staged fishing scene would be funny if it weren't so sad as obviously this is not how Dresden spends his time when one fisherman comments about Dresnok not liking fishing.

I'm surprised that they let the one guy out but not surprised at all that his story is drastically different from Dresnok who still lives under the regime and has no possible way out. Dresnok can only tell a tale that is acceptable to North Korea. To do anything different would likely condemn his entire family to work camps and eventually death.

Despite the very sad look at a very sad life the peek into North Korea is fascinating.",1315872000,4,1596,4.6325088339222615
3002793,5,B000XJD3HU,"This movie is about the 4 American soldiers who crossed over the DMZ to North Korea and stayed there since the 60's.  This film shows their lives, but focuses on one main character, Dresnok.  This film shows how they ended up in North Korea and what their daily life was like, including becoming movie actors, getting married and having children.  It's hard not to have sympathy for their misery there but I don't feel sorry for them.  It's a strange tale about Americans living in a country that hates the US and not even talking to Westerners for decades.  You get a taste of how they live and were indoctrinated into a cult like society while being totally isolated from the modern world.  I consider this to be a fascinating story.  The film does a good job trying to show all of the facts and controversy with good historical background.  For another view on their story read ""The Reluctant Communist"" by Jenkins who is featured briefly in the film.

3002794,4,B000XJD3HU,"Crossing the Line details the actions of PFC James J. Dresnok, who defected on August 15, 1962 by crossing the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) from the Republic of Korea (South Korea) into the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea).  While the documentary focuses most of its efforts on Dresnok, it provides details on the other three U.S. defectors who crossed over into North Korea seeking asylum.  The details of the accounts provided by Dresnok and the other surviving defector, Sgt. Charles Jenkins, are contradictory and leave the observer to draw his/her own conclusions on the events.  Dresnok remains in North Korea while Jenkins has redefected to the U.S. and served time for desertion.  The other defectors, Jerry Parish and Larry Abshier, have both died in North Korea.

The documentary makes excellent use of interviews on each side of the DMZ, and Mr. Slater is very effective in giving a voice to the background information.  The use of the platoon commanders from the U.S. Army and the Korean People's Army on the events surround the defection of Dresnok is well presented.  The documentary takes a neutral stance, neither weighing in for or against communism, but it definitely doesn't sugar coat some of the problems in North Korea.  The portrayal of the U.S. forces in South Korea during the 1960's seems accurate; bars and prostitutes, clubs and problems with marijuana and VD in the units are all probable.  The lifestyle portrayed of Dresnok's family is also probably true, as he is a treasured antique of the Kim Il Sung regime and will likely be subject to excellent care until, as he says, his dying day.  Even during the Arduous March, the great famine of the 1990s, Dresnok reports he received his rice rations while acknowledging the deaths of the thousands (estimates are from 100,000 to 1.5 million) in the rest of the country.

I recommend this documentary for political science majors, psychologists, historians, and anyone following the events on the Korean peninsula.  Due to language concerns and topics discussed, I would not recommend this for viewers under the age of 13, but perhaps high school and college/university groups.  It provides some great footage of North Korea that is rarely captured elsewhere in other documentaries on the country.  Observers should definitely realize that this is a view of a North Korean life of luxury, authorized by the North Korean government.  The standard North Korean family does not enjoy these same luxuries.",1315008000,2,2494,5.078431372549019

He was in trouble with the military for forging a pass and seemed to have no future there. He didn't have a high school diploma or any job skills. At the time this film was made, he was clearly an alcoholic. Since we offer little in the way of support in this country for returning veterans, especially those with disciplinary or personality problems, it seems to me he would probably have ended up either in jail or living under a bridge drinking himself to death. Instead, he has a home, a family, enough to eat, health care. I'm not competely convinced he would have been better off here. You can't eat freedom. Just a thought.",1308441600,,801,4.531034482758621
3002796,4,B000XJD3HU,"I rented this to get a glimpse of what life in North Korea was like - anything at all - as with much history, when you start off with one journey, you find another. I did not know 4 US Army soldiers defected to North Korea in 1962-63. That was a huge embarrassment to the US and a propaganda windfall for the DPK, who not surprisingly, exploited these four soldiers. They made speeches denouncing the US, were wined and dined by the North Koreans and even starred in North Korean movies (as the bad guys, of course).

This documentary centers on the one of first to cross the border - James `Comrade Joe"" Dresnok. The story is told from his perspective. Since 2 of the others died and 1 escaped to Japan, only Joe is left in North Korea. Does he have regrets? Does he wish to return to the west? Has he been brain washed? How did he enjoy his life in a gilded cage? He learned the language, culture and to say the words, but does he mean them?  About the only thing you can be sure of is that Joe does not like fellow defector Charles Jenkins who managed to get to Japan in 2004.

One suspects that Joe is saying literally, the party line. He knows in order to eat in a land where natives are starving; he must continue to defend his decision and North Korea. Since the four defectors tried to escape North Korea in the late 1960's (by going to the Soviet Embassy - duh!) and spent the next 10 years being`re-educated', Joe's statements of loyalty to the North Koreans rings hollow. This is a good documentary, not excellent - it can be slow at times, and one tires of hearing Joe defend himself and his actions. He comes off as disingenuous at best, not someone worthy of hate, but pity.",1304640000,,1688,4.30188679245283
3002797,4,B000XJD3HU,"At the outset, ""Crossing the Line"" seems as if it's going to be one of those conventional narratvies that details the reason behind PFC James Dresnok's odd choice of defecting to the DPRK in 1962.  We're presented with the standard biographical summary, complete with subdued music, old photographs, and snippets of memories that's been a staple of documentaries since Ken Burns' Civil War.

However, it becomes clear after about 15 minutes that this isn't your run-of-the-mill ""Time"" Magazine type of story.  Instead, ""Crossing the Link"" quickly becomes less a documentary about why Dresnok decided to walks across the DMZ into North Korea (thus ""crossing the line""), and more a voyeuristic examination on the psychology of alienation and the degree to which people can delude themselves in their search for belonging.

Dresnok's story is an almost perfect recipe on how to psychologically screw up a child so that he remains wounded well into adulthood.  His childhood and post-adolescence are an almost non-stop series of devastating abandonment and betrayal from everyone important in his development: parents, relatives, and his first wife.  This sort of damage is some heavy dope for a child, so it's no wonder that several times in the film Dresnok stated that his main goal in life was to ""run away.""

It also explains why his defection to the DPRK - something that was an act of opportunity - ended up being such a good fit for him.  It's really no surprise.  In North Korea Dresnok finally found the perfect family: one that would not abandon him so long as he never abandons it.  And, this desire of belonging and craving a simple life in which permanence and security are guaranteed is repeated consistently throughout the movie.

After the defection, Dresnok joined the other three US servicement who ""crossed the line"" as prized tools for the North Korean propaganda machine, and there isn't much to refute the idea that he's still serving that function.  After all, it's hard to believe the North Koreans would allow American film-makers to interview someone who would be critical of them.  And Dresnok plays his role well.

However, even though Dresnok justifies and defends the DPRK throughout the movie (he never hints at any regrets or misgivings about his choice; he dismisses any ideas of North Korean misdeeds; and forcefully questions the criticisms leveled on his adopted land by one of his fellow defectors, Sgt. Jennings), one never really gets the feeling that he is a true believer.

And, considering Dresnok's psyche, that makes perfect sense. There is nothing about him, his reminiscences, or his background that would indicate Dresnok is either politically savvy or active. In fact, Dresnok's behavior, values, and priorities all point to a man who was simply looking for someone or somewhere he could go and be a part of something solid and permanent. Dresnok seems to be less involved in rationalizing North Korea's repressive dictatorship from a philosophical point of view, and more a child who defends their parent: ""Yeah, daddy may spank me sometimes, but it was because I was bad.""

Ultimately, though, one comes away with a sense of melancholy regarding Dresnok.  It's hard to dislike the guy.  He's affable, humble, and is a dedicated father.  But his willingness to ignore the realities of life in the DPRK makes it difficult to really sympathize with him.  At some point he had to make a conscious effort to block out the reality of his daily experience and to ignore the common sense that contradicts the wild propaganda spewed from the official channels of the North Korean government.  But, like a toddler desperately wanting to gain his father's approval, Dresnok is an accomplice in the tawdry game.  Perhaps the most poignant moment was, when emotionally discussing his oldest son's future, he rhetorically asked whether it could ever be possible for the son of a common worker to attend a University in the United States.  It was a stark display of willful ignorance and irony, particularly when coming from someone living in a nation where freedom and societal position are so rigidly maintained.  And it exposed just how far someone will go to achieve their desire to belong.",1302739200,12,4226,5.021489971346705

It profiles a great deal of his life before and after he ""crossed the line"" into North Korea.

3002800,5,B000XJD3HU,"In 1962 an American soldier serving in South Korea faced court martial after he forged a pass to leave his post. That soldier - James Dresnok - walked across the 2.5-mile demilitarized zone and defected to communist North Korea. About 45 years later, a film crew journeyed to North Korea where it caught up with Dresnok. The result is the fascinating documentary ""Crossing the Line.""

Surprisingly, Dresnok was one of four Americans who defected to North Korea in the 1960s. Crossing the Line details each defector's disparate fate. Eventually, the four tried to defect to the Soviet Union, but were turned down. After a period of ""re-education"" they became North Korean film stars by playing evil Americans in several films. I don't want to spoil the film - but the men's family lives are the most bizarre aspect of their bizarre lives.

Dresnok, however, is the focus. At the time of the film, he was in poor health but continued to drink, smoke, and overeat. He admits that he had no strong feelings about communism when he defected, but he zealously defends North Korea. As the Beethoven quote suggests, Dresnok cannot bear to admit that he might have ruined his life through a rash decision.

The filmmakers did a good job of uncovering Dresnok's awful childhood in Virginia, but he remains a murky figure. There is a hint about Dresnok's psyche. Dresnok first recounts that - even in the midst of a famine the decimated North Korea - he received his daily rations. Then he remarks that the North Korean regime will take care of him until the day he dies.

One of the best aspects of Crossing the Line is that the filmmakers leave the conclusions to the viewers. Whatever one concludes, it is a great story about a forgotten corner of history.",1281830400,,1748,4.740131578947368

Has he remained in the U.S. or U.S. military he would be dead or in jail because the U.S. treats it's vets like homeless bums has nothing nor does anything for them upon there return. It's disgusting how the U.S. ekects officials who do everything only for themselves not the will of the people then send our best out to die or loose body partsvin vain like Iraq or Vietnam then either loose there ekection bid or retire yet are set for life akk benefits and  $250,000 a year for life yet the real heros come back with no hope or future and are literally left to rot in the gutter. The way those soilders were treated like royalty in the DPRK is how our vets should be treated but unlike the U.S. which is controlled by corporations the DPRK is the exact opposite. I disagree with the method the dprk treats it's own people just as much as I disagree on how the U.S.  rewards illegal immigrants from all over the world with health benefits college benefits which should be a right and priority in the first place while a natural citizen has to go through hell and back just to get health insurance a job etc... our soilders such as Chris Kyle Joe dresnok Richard Jenkins are all heros. They knew and know that the U.S. would have offerd then squat upon returning so they looked for a completely different life and dresnok is right that his kids probably wouldn't have gone to college because of the tuition which as I said should be a right. The U.S. makes it almost impossible to obtain the three main things one needs in order to survive that's healthcare education and a career. I myself hope to live in a country one day where the people not corporations are taken care of. I do think dresnok however is truly brainwashed but then again he's taken care of. I do think he bullied Jenkins but Jenkins comes off as a real back stabber and traitor to everything and everyone he has no honor unlike dresnok but I don't think he deserves to go to prison because he defected trying to find a better life for himself. All in all this film is fascinating as is a state of mind which was also made by the same director. As far as the dprk and it's own people the government police state is an evil one and my heart goes out to the people of that country. The U.S. is also a semi police state with way to many laws.

3002833,4,B000XJD3HU,"""Crossing the Line"" tells the story of James Joseph Dresnok who has spent most of his life living in North Korea. Most of the material comes from filming Dresnok speaking, with the remainder from N.K. sources. Dresnok's story begins with a brief review of a troubled childhood (parents split up when he was nine, his father later abandoned him and he was placed in foster care), followed by dropping out of high-school and enlisting in the Army at age 17. Dresnok married during basic training and then was sent to Germany - without his new bride. While there Dresnok says he was forced to clean an armored truck with a toothbrush for a minor offence - at 42 below zero. (The latter portion, in particular, seems highly improbable.) Returning to the U.S. he found his wife had left him - in despair, he re-enlisted and was sent to Korea and assigned to duty at the DMZ in 1962.

There Dresnok became attached to one of the local prostitutes and snuck out one evening to be with her. Facing a court-martial upon his return, Dresnok instead ran into the DMZ and was captured by a North Korean patrol and taken to Pyongyang.

In Pyongyang Dresnok met another deserter, Larry Abshier, and they were soon joined by two others - Jerry Parrish, and Charles Jenkins. All were kept separate from the North Korean population. (Jenkins supposedly feared being sent to Vietnam, and hoped the North Koreans would send him to Russia, and from there he cold return to the U.S.) All became propaganda tools. (One wonders why four deserted within such a relatively short interval, with none since.) Used as propaganda tools, they appeared on magazine covers and Dresnok also made appeals over loudspeakers at the DMZ - trying to entice more to defect.  The group became lonely and felt out of place among a different race. They sought refuge in the Russian embassy, but instead were returned to the North Koreans. Their punishment - more 'education.'

At this point Dresnok decided to learn their culture, beliefs, and language, and by 1972 the group became N.K. citizens. Throughout most of ""Crossing the Line,"" Dresnok makes a point that he disliked Jenkins, believing that Sgt. Jenkins tried to boss the others around. In 1978 the group starred in the first of several propaganda films; Dresnok, however, didn't consider it propaganda. Jenkins married a woman kidnapped from Japan, and the others also married. Dresnok married a Romanian. Allegations were made that all four wives were in North Korea against their will - one testified, however, that she was not. Curiously, none of the wives were North Korean - probably because its leader declared that Koreans were a special race and should not mix with others.

Eventually Jenkins' wife was allowed to return to Japan, and he soon went to be with her. Arrested, he served 24 days for desertion and was given a dishonorable discharge; the light sentence was probably due to Japanese government pleadings. The other two deserters died in North Korea, leaving only Dresnok - employed as an English teacher, though probably not very much. At the end of ""Crossing the Line"" Dresnok is seen receiving medical attention (overweight, heavy smoking), expressing appreciation for The Great Leader's seeing to it that his food was undiminished during the nationwide famine, and blaming U.S. sanctions for that famine. (He never wondered out loud why he should receive special food allocations.)

Bottom-Line: Dresnok has wasted most of his life in North Korea and, with the three others, became tools of an extremely oppressive and ineffective regime. His three sons are growing up in North Korea - filled with one-sided false propaganda, and largely wasting their lives as well, along with the millions of other North Koreans. Unfortunately, ""Crossing the Line"" filming was limited to Pyongyang - North Korea's capital in fact and also a propaganda tool in itself that reportedly grossly distorts actual living standards in most of the country.",1266796800,5,3974,4.968421052631579

The documentary is very well done and shows the viewer the life that the four American defectors had to endure. After viewing this film, I got the sense that Joe Dresnok was simply an angry soldier who acted very hastily and thought that defecting to a communist country would solve his problem. The four Americans were never allowed to leave with the exception of Sergeant Charles Jenkins who was finally able to join his wife in Japan in 2005. Joe Dresnok chose his own destiny but I honestly believe that if he was allowed to leave North Korea that he would jump at the chance.

3002838,3,B000XJD3HU,"British director Daniel Gordon has a kind of franchise in North Korea, making films for the West that represent that country from surprising (state-approved) angles - this one curiously about defectors from the US Army who crossed the DMZ from South Korea in the early 1960s. The most prominent of them, James Dresnok from Richmond, Virginia, after a troubled childhood and a failed marriage, found a home there for himself arguably better than any he'd had before. Joined by three others, not unlike himself, he adapted to the culture and became a film star, playing ""evil Americans."" Meanwhile, he has been married twice and raised children.

Professing to be happy and well looked after by the government, even during the decades of food shortages and starvation that took the lives of uncounted North Koreans, Dresnok is an ambiguous presence in the film, though he has plenty of screen time. At the end, you know you have been told a coherent story of a man's life that is surely only partly the truth that it claims to be. Now in his 60s and in poor health, he comes across as sentimental at times, a gas bag at others, and finally capable of the beatings that he's been accused of by another American soldier who recently returned to the West with his own story to tell.

3002841,5,B000XJD3HU,"Some viewers of this film saw Dresnok as a regretful, sad man.  He and other defectors had tried to leave North Korea through the Soviet embassy; but when that failed, they settled into their lives in the ""hermit kingdom"" and married, had kids, learned the language and lived fairly ""normal"" lives.  Dresnok seemed rather satisfied with much of his life in North Korea, including his family life and the healthcare he receives.  The sadness he does display stemmed from things like the death of his first wife, and he was bitter over the way another defector (Jenkins) returned to the U.S. military and attacked Dresnok and North Korean society.
Anyway, the film is fascinating, and provides a window on North Korea we rarely see.  It humanizes this country that has been placed on the U.S. empire's ""axis of evil.""  In the course of the film, Dresnok mentions why many North Koreans are anti-American; and the answer is obvious to everybody except for Americans who are to busy talking about how great and god blessed they are to notice - the U.S. Air Force had utterly demolished their society, so North Koreans are understandably a little angry about that.

3237206,4,B000XJD3HU,"Technically brilliant, considering the subject -- fast-paced camera, excellent cuts, thoughtful shot angles.

Mr. Dresnok, living in Pyongyang since 1962, does the narrative himself. He comes across as a convivial, honest, lying, brutal character, you name it, and saddened beyond repair. ""You do not like fishing?"", a North Korean sitting next to him at the river remarks casually, causing Mr. Dresnok to ever so slightly draw a hasty cigarette drag.

There it is, the truth of a squandered life in an alien country. The Korean angler sensed it.

There is a certain twisted authenticity to him, a bullyish bonhomy that makes him look almost great to have a beer with at a sports bar at one moment, and look sadistic without further advance notice the next, with nothing but just seconds to spare inbetween.

The famous defector foe/friend (it's hard to tell at times) Robert Jenkins, now relocated to Japan, gets an earful from Mr. Dresnok for having spilled some truths. At that moment, Mr. Dresnok's outrage is a staged emotion, given the Party cadre sitting next to him. The documentary seems to not be entirely fair and balanced on this particular subject, although it serves as an interesting ""audio et altera pars"" to Mr. Jenkins' autobiography.

Mr. Dresnok, though, knows what his former rocky yet close relationship to the re-defected defector Jenkins calls for: some harsh words, that come across as totally insincere. In the end, this unhappy man is a simple soul who turned himself in for life at a moment's whim.

He genuinely loves his likeable grown-up son who has ""Richmond, VA Caucasian college student"" written all over his face, yet does barely speak English with a pronounced Korean accent and is going to be, of all choices, a North Korean diplomat.

Mr. Dresnok would also love to see his native Virginia one more time. He probably won't. He chokes up when the British filmmaker presents him with contemporary images of his childhood town, and lets him watch a Quicktime movie on an Apple notebook of former friends talking about him. Apart from his love for his family, that is the only genuine deep emotion Mr. Dresnok allows himself to show.

An excellent documentary about the strangest of fates young men can visit upon themselves.",1205280000,28,2259,4.957671957671957
3237207,4,B000XJD3HU,"I saw this documentary at a local video store and I am glad I rented it. James Dresnok (spelling?) had a less than stellar life growing up. Neglected as a child and never finding his way to the ""American Dream"" he ended up in the Army on the DMZ. A documentary crew was allowed to go to North Korea to interview Mr. Dresnok who has spent his life since 1962 in that Stalinist state. It's an interesting documentary as it also points out that three other soldiers defected to North Korea around the same time. Dresnok is an interesting interview and his ""escape"" across the minefields, his interrogation by North Korean leaders and his ""fame"" as a ""movie star"" in North Korea portraying the U.S. as the Imperalist Evil General in their movies was fascinating to say the least.

Dresnok is a likable person at times and at other times I sat and wondered just how sad he really is in his life. Still, he seems content and he paints an interesting portrayal of life as a man, a husband and a father to his children in North Korea.

He makes no apologies for his defection and downplays any mistreatment the NK's gave the Americans in the initial years of their detention there (according to Jenkins).  Given the terrible circumstances of his upbringing in the US, Dresnok probably made the right decision for himself to defect and live in North Korea.  An uneducated bully of a man without any real family in America, had he never defected he was probably doomed to a lifetime of dead end jobs, booze and jail in America.  In North Korea he became a celebrity in their movie industry, playing villainous American characters, received a pension from the NK gov't, married, had kids and had a steady supply of booze.

3237219,5,B000XJD3HU,"I had to watch this documentary a few times.  The production value is very good.  The editing, the music, and the overall presentation keeps ones attention.  This was the first time I had learned of Joseph Dresnok.  Heck...this is the first I had learned of defectors from the US military by crossing the DMZ to North Korea back in the 60's.  After watching this documentary a handful of times it allowed me to make an assessment as to the ""he said, he said"" nature of this documentary.  You have to decide the sincerity of each person and their story/side of things.  We aren't being told everything entirely from either side but there are a lot of inconsistencies in enough stories being told that one can make their own assessment.  I'm trying to explain this without giving away the entire documentary story line.

Aside from the psychological nature of this documentary and the political nature it does have a human side to it that has inconsistencies in how the defectors met their wives and what the actual intentions were with their Caucasian Korean speaking children.  Dresnok is quite emotional over his children but I almost get this sense that one of his children aren't all that close with Dresnok.

By releasing this documentary it gives North Korea the opportunity to present their society to the rest of the world that do not have access to it.  To say the least it's very engaging, and I feel, doesn't have a boring moment in the film.

If you are only familiar with the Korean war and have very little background on the history of that war and its motives this is a very good documentary to watch.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in varying cultures, governments, and attempting to figure out the motivations of people going against what the government otherwise detests and presents propaganda to the people so two societies personify such hatred towards one another.

3237232,5,B000XJD3HU,"James Dresnock and 3 other American soldiers leave their posts at the 38 degree parallel to live in North Korea.  Each has personality issues and troubled pasts that led to their military service, none fair well in the controlled military lifestyle and thus they abandon their posts.  Once the North Korean's realize that these men are not spies but have chosen to abandon their 'capitalistic barbarianism', they are treated like royalty.  In return, they are used in propaganda films, as ceremonial figureheads to decry the wickedness of the capitalistic system.

James Joseph ""Joe"" Dresnock is the primary focus of this film.  Joe seems full of contradictions some which may be attributed to his past before seeking asylum and most probably a result of his speech restrictions as a representative of North Korea.  He grew up abused, then abandoned spending 6 years in a foster home run by a strict minister.  At 16, he ran away and joined the army.  He married a local church member before shipping out, upon his return, she requests a divorce, telling him she is in love with someone else.  He reenlists hoping to loose himself in a military career and creating a new life.  When he is assigned to the dangerous and boringly repetitive job of locating mines along the DMZ, he finds happiness with a local prostitute he wishes to marry.  He is denied by his superiors.  Despairing of his circumstances, while on duty, he escapes to North Korea seeking asylum in 1962.  Once the North Koreans realize he is not a spy, he becomes their trademark for propaganda demonstrating the tyranny of capitalism, with Joe, epitomizing the desire of American's to escape the brutality of the system.  Soon three (3) other men also escape for various reasons into North Korea, all of them apparently unhappy men with rough upbringing and finding no solace in a military lifestyle.

Joe often appears guarded although he attempts a genial uneducated persona.  He is anything but this, as the interview progresses, it is obvious that he is astute and quite clever.  His emphasis that he didn't finish high school does not diminish the fact that he manipulates any situation to his greatest possible benefit.

He embraces the superior treatment he is given by the North Koreans.  He enjoyed his film career and public relations duties.  At one point, he relates how the government has always given he and the other American asylum seekers greater quantities of food allotments and other privileges. During a recent famine, he and his family continued to get the same rations, while large numbers of N. Koreans died of starvation.  He has no remorse over their suffering, but he expresses gratitude that they loved him so much that they starved so he would not go hungry (he seems to portray that this was a consensual act of the community and not a decision by party leadership).

One of the other men married a Japanese woman, who had been kidnapped by the North Koreans.  Another man married a Lebanese woman, whom had been on a tourist visa and returned home pregnant.  Her family sent her back to N. Korea because she was a disgrace to the family since she was unmarried. The other married a Korean woman (he died quite young).  All those who fled had at least one son.  Of those shown in the film, all looked either extremely Caucasian (particularly Joe's two blond sons, who show no Asian features).  All received superior levels of education not available to the general population.  Joe's two son's were studying languages focusing on English, Joe claimed they would most likely have careers as ""diplomats"" though the general consensus was that they would serve as spies.  These men and their families really had unique life experiences compared to their Korean neighbors.  With only one exception, they married women that were not raised in the traditional Korean culture.  When Joe is interviewed he is filmed with his third wife (his second wife, a Korean, had died very young).  His present wife was the child of a Togolese diplomat and a Korean woman, so most likely her upbringing was not typical to other Korean's as she looked much more Togolese than Korean, she appeared to be at least 20 or 30 years younger than Joe.

There seemed to be a great deal of tension between the four men.  Joe had been the leader (he was the first to seek asylum) of the two other American men.  When Robert Jenkins (4th defector) was welcomed by North Koreans, he was given more preferential treatment since he brought an American Rifle that the Koreans had great interest in studying.  The other two men also preferred Robert.  Joe attempted to downplay his bitterness, perhaps even hatred toward Robert.  Though Robert claimed extensive abuse at Joe's hands, with multiple assaults and broken bones, which when asked, Joe emphatically denies. However, later Joe says they may have had a minor altercation -a drunken brawl.  When asked for clarification, he responds maybe it was more than once; he once again makes a claim that Robert is a notorious liar and he was intentionally misrepresenting their relationship.

All in all, this is a look at a small sample of men, who never really fit in anywhere.  In their attempt at finding happiness, they went to extremes, only to never really be a part of their new culture either.

The filming was probably very limited in its scope, at the beginning we see a North Korean sitting next to Joe during the interview leaving the impression that communism isn't the ""free lifestyle"" portrayed.  At times, I thought that there was much more to a story that may have been edited, but without any clarity as to what or why information was missing.  This made the film seem incomplete and unbalanced even possibly biased (which may have been at the behest of the North Koreans?).",1390435200,3,5801,4.8397565922920895

Upon his arrival on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Drednock was taken by communist troops. Soon his voice was heard over giant DMZ loudspeakers telling other Americans in South Korea to defect. His face would also be seen in DPRK movies, where he inevitably played an evil American.

Following the death of Kim il-Sung this film crew was permitted over a period of many months to interview Dresnok, his family and associates. One of them was Jenkins, another American soldier who defected during the 1960s. Jenkins would later return to the U.S. and make allegations which Dresnok had to refute.

Communist living obviously took it's toll on him. Little things like the gold teeth. And the way he smokes his cigarettes down to the filter.

Joe Dresnok defects one day while patrolling the DMZ between North and South Korea.  It was an impulse decision that has shaped the rest of his life. He has live his adult life in North Korea and recounts that life in this documentary.  I am stunned that the filmmakers were able to get this made, quite frankly.

He talks about his reasons for defecting, his life in the army and before joining. He recognizes that the strong father figure that communist Korea made out of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il appealed to him as a child of a broken home.

The documentary also explores the lives of the other three American defectors and Dresnok speaks of them freely as well.

He is a riveting personality and narrates his story with real authority.

This documentary covers a very interesting subject that I had previously been unaware of.  One of the neatest things this documentary offers is a glimpse of some of North Korea's propaganda films that star these Americans as the stereotypical bad guys.

I'd definitely recommend watching this.",1325462400,,1351,5.610837438423645
3237289,5,B000XJD3HU,"This documentary is very well done and well worth watching. It is a fascinating look into North Korea and how it wants to be portrayed as well as a look at someone likely with Stockholm Syndrome. You do feel sorry for the four who made a rash decision and then later regretted it and tried to defect to Russia. However, their alternative fates at that time in the US military were certainly unattractive to them. Dresnok was about to be court-martialed. Another was going to be deployed to Vietnam into a combat position. At the time of their defection they were likely OK with committing suicide as they did not know what awaited them as they crossed over the line.

My guess is they were likely very useful to the North Korean government in teaching English for North Korean's to gain access to scientific information as well as teaching American customs to spies. Dresden obviously had very little contact with his son growing up or the boy would have spoken better English. The whole staged fishing scene would be funny if it weren't so sad as obviously this is not how Dresden spends his time when one fisherman comments about Dresnok not liking fishing.

I'm surprised that they let the one guy out but not surprised at all that his story is drastically different from Dresnok who still lives under the regime and has no possible way out. Dresnok can only tell a tale that is acceptable to North Korea. To do anything different would likely condemn his entire family to work camps and eventually death.

Despite the very sad look at a very sad life the peek into North Korea is fascinating.",1315872000,4,1596,4.6325088339222615

This film shows their lives, but focuses on one main character, Dresnok.  This film shows how they ended up in North Korea and what their daily life was like, including becoming movie actors, getting married and having children.  It's hard not to have sympathy for their misery there but I don't feel sorry for them.  It's a strange tale about Americans living in a country that hates the US and not even talking to Westerners for decades.  You get a taste of how they live and were indoctrinated into a cult like society while being totally isolated from the modern world.  I consider this to be a fascinating story.  The film does a good job trying to show all of the facts and controversy with good historical background.  For another view on their story read ""The Reluctant Communist"" by Jenkins who is featured briefly in the film.

3237291,4,B000XJD3HU,"Crossing the Line details the actions of PFC James J. Dresnok, who defected on August 15, 1962 by crossing the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) from the Republic of Korea (South Korea) into the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea).  While the documentary focuses most of its efforts on Dresnok, it provides details on the other three U.S. defectors who crossed over into North Korea seeking asylum.  The details of the accounts provided by Dresnok and the other surviving defector, Sgt. Charles Jenkins, are contradictory and leave the observer to draw his/her own conclusions on the events.  Dresnok remains in North Korea while Jenkins has redefected to the U.S. and served time for desertion.  The other defectors, Jerry Parish and Larry Abshier, have both died in North Korea.

The documentary makes excellent use of interviews on each side of the DMZ, and Mr. Slater is very effective in giving a voice to the background information.  The use of the platoon commanders from the U.S. Army and the Korean People's Army on the events surround the defection of Dresnok is well presented.  The documentary takes a neutral stance, neither weighing in for or against communism, but it definitely doesn't sugar coat some of the problems in North Korea.  The portrayal of the U.S. forces in South Korea during the 1960's seems accurate; bars and prostitutes, clubs and problems with marijuana and VD in the units are all probable.  The lifestyle portrayed of Dresnok's family is also probably true, as he is a treasured antique of the Kim Il Sung regime and will likely be subject to excellent care until, as he says, his dying day.  Even during the Arduous March, the great famine of the 1990s, Dresnok reports he received his rice rations while acknowledging the deaths of the thousands (estimates are from 100,000 to 1.5 million) in the rest of the country.

I recommend this documentary for political science majors, psychologists, historians, and anyone following the events on the Korean peninsula.  Due to language concerns and topics discussed, I would not recommend this for viewers under the age of 13, but perhaps high school and college/university groups.  It provides some great footage of North Korea that is rarely captured elsewhere in other documentaries on the country.  Observers should definitely realize that this is a view of a North Korean life of luxury, authorized by the North Korean government.  The standard North Korean family does not enjoy these same luxuries.",1315008000,2,2494,5.078431372549019

He was in trouble with the military for forging a pass and seemed to have no future there. He didn't have a high school diploma or any job skills. At the time this film was made, he was clearly an alcoholic. Since we offer little in the way of support in this country for returning veterans, especially those with disciplinary or personality problems, it seems to me he would probably have ended up either in jail or living under a bridge drinking himself to death. Instead, he has a home, a family, enough to eat, health care. I'm not competely convinced he would have been better off here. You can't eat freedom. Just a thought.",1308441600,,801,4.531034482758621
3237293,4,B000XJD3HU,"I rented this to get a glimpse of what life in North Korea was like - anything at all - as with much history, when you start off with one journey, you find another. I did not know 4 US Army soldiers defected to North Korea in 1962-63. That was a huge embarrassment to the US and a propaganda windfall for the DPK, who not surprisingly, exploited these four soldiers. They made speeches denouncing the US, were wined and dined by the North Koreans and even starred in North Korean movies (as the bad guys, of course).

This documentary centers on the one of first to cross the border - James `Comrade Joe"" Dresnok. The story is told from his perspective. Since 2 of the others died and 1 escaped to Japan, only Joe is left in North Korea. Does he have regrets? Does he wish to return to the west? Has he been brain washed? How did he enjoy his life in a gilded cage? He learned the language, culture and to say the words, but does he mean them?  About the only thing you can be sure of is that Joe does not like fellow defector Charles Jenkins who managed to get to Japan in 2004.

One suspects that Joe is saying literally, the party line. He knows in order to eat in a land where natives are starving; he must continue to defend his decision and North Korea. Since the four defectors tried to escape North Korea in the late 1960's (by going to the Soviet Embassy - duh!) and spent the next 10 years being`re-educated', Joe's statements of loyalty to the North Koreans rings hollow. This is a good documentary, not excellent - it can be slow at times, and one tires of hearing Joe defend himself and his actions. He comes off as disingenuous at best, not someone worthy of hate, but pity.",1304640000,,1688,4.30188679245283
3237294,4,B000XJD3HU,"At the outset, ""Crossing the Line"" seems as if it's going to be one of those conventional narratvies that details the reason behind PFC James Dresnok's odd choice of defecting to the DPRK in 1962.  We're presented with the standard biographical summary, complete with subdued music, old photographs, and snippets of memories that's been a staple of documentaries since Ken Burns' Civil War.

However, it becomes clear after about 15 minutes that this isn't your run-of-the-mill ""Time"" Magazine type of story.  Instead, ""Crossing the Link"" quickly becomes less a documentary about why Dresnok decided to walks across the DMZ into North Korea (thus ""crossing the line""), and more a voyeuristic examination on the psychology of alienation and the degree to which people can delude themselves in their search for belonging.

Dresnok's story is an almost perfect recipe on how to psychologically screw up a child so that he remains wounded well into adulthood.  His childhood and post-adolescence are an almost non-stop series of devastating abandonment and betrayal from everyone important in his development: parents, relatives, and his first wife.  This sort of damage is some heavy dope for a child, so it's no wonder that several times in the film Dresnok stated that his main goal in life was to ""run away.""

It also explains why his defection to the DPRK - something that was an act of opportunity - ended up being such a good fit for him.  It's really no surprise.  In North Korea Dresnok finally found the perfect family: one that would not abandon him so long as he never abandons it.  And, this desire of belonging and craving a simple life in which permanence and security are guaranteed is repeated consistently throughout the movie.

After the defection, Dresnok joined the other three US servicement who ""crossed the line"" as prized tools for the North Korean propaganda machine, and there isn't much to refute the idea that he's still serving that function.  After all, it's hard to believe the North Koreans would allow American film-makers to interview someone who would be critical of them.  And Dresnok plays his role well.

However, even though Dresnok justifies and defends the DPRK throughout the movie (he never hints at any regrets or misgivings about his choice; he dismisses any ideas of North Korean misdeeds; and forcefully questions the criticisms leveled on his adopted land by one of his fellow defectors, Sgt. Jennings), one never really gets the feeling that he is a true believer.

And, considering Dresnok's psyche, that makes perfect sense. There is nothing about him, his reminiscences, or his background that would indicate Dresnok is either politically savvy or active. In fact, Dresnok's behavior, values, and priorities all point to a man who was simply looking for someone or somewhere he could go and be a part of something solid and permanent. Dresnok seems to be less involved in rationalizing North Korea's repressive dictatorship from a philosophical point of view, and more a child who defends their parent: ""Yeah, daddy may spank me sometimes, but it was because I was bad.""

Ultimately, though, one comes away with a sense of melancholy regarding Dresnok.  It's hard to dislike the guy.  He's affable, humble, and is a dedicated father.  But his willingness to ignore the realities of life in the DPRK makes it difficult to really sympathize with him.  At some point he had to make a conscious effort to block out the reality of his daily experience and to ignore the common sense that contradicts the wild propaganda spewed from the official channels of the North Korean government.  But, like a toddler desperately wanting to gain his father's approval, Dresnok is an accomplice in the tawdry game.  Perhaps the most poignant moment was, when emotionally discussing his oldest son's future, he rhetorically asked whether it could ever be possible for the son of a common worker to attend a University in the United States.  It was a stark display of willful ignorance and irony, particularly when coming from someone living in a nation where freedom and societal position are so rigidly maintained.  And it exposed just how far someone will go to achieve their desire to belong.",1302739200,12,4226,5.021489971346705

3237297,5,B000XJD3HU,"In 1962 an American soldier serving in South Korea faced court martial after he forged a pass to leave his post. That soldier - James Dresnok - walked across the 2.5-mile demilitarized zone and defected to communist North Korea. About 45 years later, a film crew journeyed to North Korea where it caught up with Dresnok. The result is the fascinating documentary ""Crossing the Line.""

Surprisingly, Dresnok was one of four Americans who defected to North Korea in the 1960s. Crossing the Line details each defector's disparate fate. Eventually, the four tried to defect to the Soviet Union, but were turned down. After a period of ""re-education"" they became North Korean film stars by playing evil Americans in several films. I don't want to spoil the film - but the men's family lives are the most bizarre aspect of their bizarre lives.

Dresnok, however, is the focus. At the time of the film, he was in poor health but continued to drink, smoke, and overeat. He admits that he had no strong feelings about communism when he defected, but he zealously defends North Korea. As the Beethoven quote suggests, Dresnok cannot bear to admit that he might have ruined his life through a rash decision.

The filmmakers did a good job of uncovering Dresnok's awful childhood in Virginia, but he remains a murky figure. There is a hint about Dresnok's psyche. Dresnok first recounts that - even in the midst of a famine the decimated North Korea - he received his daily rations. Then he remarks that the North Korean regime will take care of him until the day he dies.

One of the best aspects of Crossing the Line is that the filmmakers leave the conclusions to the viewers. Whatever one concludes, it is a great story about a forgotten corner of history.",1281830400,,1748,4.740131578947368

Has he remained in the U.S. or U.S. military he would be dead or in jail because the U.S. treats it's vets like homeless bums has nothing nor does anything for them upon there return. It's disgusting how the U.S. ekects officials who do everything only for themselves not the will of the people then send our best out to die or loose body partsvin vain like Iraq or Vietnam then either loose there ekection bid or retire yet are set for life akk benefits and  $250,000 a year for life yet the real heros come back with no hope or future and are literally left to rot in the gutter. The way those soilders were treated like royalty in the DPRK is how our vets should be treated but unlike the U.S. which is controlled by corporations the DPRK is the exact opposite. I disagree with the method the dprk treats it's own people just as much as I disagree on how the U.S.  rewards illegal immigrants from all over the world with health benefits college benefits which should be a right and priority in the first place while a natural citizen has to go through hell and back just to get health insurance a job etc... our soilders such as Chris Kyle Joe dresnok Richard Jenkins are all heros. They knew and know that the U.S. would have offerd then squat upon returning so they looked for a completely different life and dresnok is right that his kids probably wouldn't have gone to college because of the tuition which as I said should be a right. The U.S. makes it almost impossible to obtain the three main things one needs in order to survive that's healthcare education and a career. I myself hope to live in a country one day where the people not corporations are taken care of. I do think dresnok however is truly brainwashed but then again he's taken care of. I do think he bullied Jenkins but Jenkins comes off as a real back stabber and traitor to everything and everyone he has no honor unlike dresnok but I don't think he deserves to go to prison because he defected trying to find a better life for himself. All in all this film is fascinating as is a state of mind which was also made by the same director. As far as the dprk and it's own people the government police state is an evil one and my heart goes out to the people of that country. The U.S. is also a semi police state with way to many laws.

3237330,4,B000XJD3HU,"""Crossing the Line"" tells the story of James Joseph Dresnok who has spent most of his life living in North Korea. Most of the material comes from filming Dresnok speaking, with the remainder from N.K. sources. Dresnok's story begins with a brief review of a troubled childhood (parents split up when he was nine, his father later abandoned him and he was placed in foster care), followed by dropping out of high-school and enlisting in the Army at age 17. Dresnok married during basic training and then was sent to Germany - without his new bride. While there Dresnok says he was forced to clean an armored truck with a toothbrush for a minor offence - at 42 below zero. (The latter portion, in particular, seems highly improbable.) Returning to the U.S. he found his wife had left him - in despair, he re-enlisted and was sent to Korea and assigned to duty at the DMZ in 1962.

There Dresnok became attached to one of the local prostitutes and snuck out one evening to be with her. Facing a court-martial upon his return, Dresnok instead ran into the DMZ and was captured by a North Korean patrol and taken to Pyongyang.

In Pyongyang Dresnok met another deserter, Larry Abshier, and they were soon joined by two others - Jerry Parrish, and Charles Jenkins. All were kept separate from the North Korean population. (Jenkins supposedly feared being sent to Vietnam, and hoped the North Koreans would send him to Russia, and from there he cold return to the U.S.) All became propaganda tools. (One wonders why four deserted within such a relatively short interval, with none since.) Used as propaganda tools, they appeared on magazine covers and Dresnok also made appeals over loudspeakers at the DMZ - trying to entice more to defect.  The group became lonely and felt out of place among a different race. They sought refuge in the Russian embassy, but instead were returned to the North Koreans. Their punishment - more 'education.'

At this point Dresnok decided to learn their culture, beliefs, and language, and by 1972 the group became N.K. citizens. Throughout most of ""Crossing the Line,"" Dresnok makes a point that he disliked Jenkins, believing that Sgt. Jenkins tried to boss the others around. In 1978 the group starred in the first of several propaganda films; Dresnok, however, didn't consider it propaganda. Jenkins married a woman kidnapped from Japan, and the others also married. Dresnok married a Romanian. Allegations were made that all four wives were in North Korea against their will - one testified, however, that she was not. Curiously, none of the wives were North Korean - probably because its leader declared that Koreans were a special race and should not mix with others.

Eventually Jenkins' wife was allowed to return to Japan, and he soon went to be with her. Arrested, he served 24 days for desertion and was given a dishonorable discharge; the light sentence was probably due to Japanese government pleadings. The other two deserters died in North Korea, leaving only Dresnok - employed as an English teacher, though probably not very much. At the end of ""Crossing the Line"" Dresnok is seen receiving medical attention (overweight, heavy smoking), expressing appreciation for The Great Leader's seeing to it that his food was undiminished during the nationwide famine, and blaming U.S. sanctions for that famine. (He never wondered out loud why he should receive special food allocations.)

Bottom-Line: Dresnok has wasted most of his life in North Korea and, with the three others, became tools of an extremely oppressive and ineffective regime. His three sons are growing up in North Korea - filled with one-sided false propaganda, and largely wasting their lives as well, along with the millions of other North Koreans. Unfortunately, ""Crossing the Line"" filming was limited to Pyongyang - North Korea's capital in fact and also a propaganda tool in itself that reportedly grossly distorts actual living standards in most of the country.",1266796800,5,3974,4.968421052631579

The documentary is very well done and shows the viewer the life that the four American defectors had to endure. After viewing this film, I got the sense that Joe Dresnok was simply an angry soldier who acted very hastily and thought that defecting to a communist country would solve his problem. The four Americans were never allowed to leave with the exception of Sergeant Charles Jenkins who was finally able to join his wife in Japan in 2005. Joe Dresnok chose his own destiny but I honestly believe that if he was allowed to leave North Korea that he would jump at the chance.

The most prominent of them, James Dresnok from Richmond, Virginia, after a troubled childhood and a failed marriage, found a home there for himself arguably better than any he'd had before. Joined by three others, not unlike himself, he adapted to the culture and became a film star, playing ""evil Americans."" Meanwhile, he has been married twice and raised children.

Professing to be happy and well looked after by the government, even during the decades of food shortages and starvation that took the lives of uncounted North Koreans, Dresnok is an ambiguous presence in the film, though he has plenty of screen time. At the end, you know you have been told a coherent story of a man's life that is surely only partly the truth that it claims to be. Now in his 60s and in poor health, he comes across as sentimental at times, a gas bag at others, and finally capable of the beatings that he's been accused of by another American soldier who recently returned to the West with his own story to tell.

He and other defectors had tried to leave North Korea through the Soviet embassy; but when that failed, they settled into their lives in the ""hermit kingdom"" and married, had kids, learned the language and lived fairly ""normal"" lives.  Dresnok seemed rather satisfied with much of his life in North Korea, including his family life and the healthcare he receives.  The sadness he does display stemmed from things like the death of his first wife, and he was bitter over the way another defector (Jenkins) returned to the U.S. military and attacked Dresnok and North Korean society.
Anyway, the film is fascinating, and provides a window on North Korea we rarely see.  It humanizes this country that has been placed on the U.S. empire's ""axis of evil.""  In the course of the film, Dresnok mentions why many North Koreans are anti-American; and the answer is obvious to everybody except for Americans who are to busy talking about how great and god blessed they are to notice - the U.S. Air Force had utterly demolished their society, so North Koreans are understandably a little angry about that.

It's kind of ironic how some Americans make fun of the North Korean's love for their ""fatherly leader,"" while they themselves adore Reagan, re-elect war criminals like Bush, and elevate their slave-owning, Native American killing ""founding fathers"" to demigod status.
Hysterical nationalism isn't limited to places like North Korea.

8228390,4,B000XJD3HU,"Tells the stories of four members of the United States military who crossed the Korean DMZ into North Korea. This focuses upon a man who had a difficult childhood and went into the military. Upon returning home his gal had another guy so he retuned to the military and through a series of events made his way to the North. Upon his arrival he was at first doomed, then he was considered a prize. Another guy that had gone over was brought to him. The four of them were prizes and even appeared in movies as evil Americans after they had a bad encounter at the Russian Embassy and years of...'reeducation'.

Surreal, insightful. He lives like...a king of a prison.",1517616000,,663,4.525
8228391,5,B000XJD3HU,"I served in the US Army from 1977-1981, while the Cold War was still going strong, especially in Korea. During my enlistment, I spent almost three years in South Korea, one tour with the 2nd Infantry Division at Camp Hovey and another 18-month tour with the Joint Security Area at Panmunjom. During my service in Korea, I often heard stories about a handful of US soldiers who had defected to North Korea. While stationed in the JSA, I sometimes wondered what life was like for those men, or even if they were kept alive by the North Koreans, after they defected. This film answers those questions. Produced by BBC, it interviews the American deserters in North Korea and a few of their relatives and friends still living in the US. Bruce Cummings, a famous Korea scholar (and a former professor of mine at the University of Washington), offers excellent insight into life in Korea, north and south, during that era. This is not a propaganda film. It does not seek to applaud or to denounce these men. It does offer an interesting glimpse into the lives of a few men who chose to turn their backs on the United States and to begin a new life in communist North Korea. I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in learning more about the Cold War, about recent Korean history, and especially about American military involvement in Korea.",1493078400,4,1350,4.652719665271967

I have read many many books on North Korea, and this is absolutely fascinating as it gives a realistic glimpse into daily life there, well....for those living in Pyongyang.",1483315200,,311,4.7407407407407405
8228395,5,B000XJD3HU,"Like others, I'm super fascinated by this documentary.  I know Dresnok can be bullyish at times but overall I have a lot of compassion for him.  I think people forgot or they don't completely understand the trauma of being abandoned by by both parents and being completely alone in this world.  Then he gets married, was faithful and she betrays him.  It's just too much-- these are the things that drive people to prison, suicide, etc.  While he doesn't have a formal education, I don't see him as someone who is unintelligent and he makes interesting observations.  Like others mentioned, he's probably led a better life in North Korea than he would over here.

I thought they did a great job with the documentary.  I like how it opened -- ""how have you been?""  ""Oh very good- a little angry but very good.""  It was interesting how Dresnok said that.  It feels like that's not socially acceptable to say over here-- I wonder if that's something that would be okay to admit in the N. Korean culture.",1477958400,,1000,4.593220338983051
8228396,5,B000XJD3HU,"This documentary/film probably isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I keep re-watching it. I guess I'm fascinated at this guy who defected to the north and never returned & how his life turned out living there.",1474243200,,206,4.75
8228397,5,B000XJD3HU,"I have watched this documentary thoroughly about five times, so I can confidently say that this is probably the most fascinating documentary that I've ever seen. The music throughout the film alone is worthy of some major international award, as it is very moving and effectively helps tell James Dresnok's incredibly inspiring story. Without taking sides about how right or wrong his decision to defect was, the film beautifully explains how drastic and challenging his decision to change sides was. I also really liked how the movie detailed his current life in the DPRK. Christian Slater, the sole narrator throughout the entire documentary, demonstrates an objective yet respectful and captivating tone.",1471910400,,707,5.378378378378378
8228398,5,B000XJD3HU,My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. This is your movie if you want a good defector documentary. We both find North Korea fairly fascinating and this movie provides an interesting look inside. The quality of the movie from Amazon was also very good.,1465689600,,256,4.711111111111111
8228399,4,B000XJD3HU,"Crossing the Line is a fascinating, tragic and somewhat disturbing documentary about James Joseph Dresnok, a US soldier who defected to North Korea in 1962. Together with three other American defectors, Joe Dresnok was used in the Communist regime's propaganda and even starred in a popular North Korean film, Unsung Heroes. In the film, Dresnok portrays an American villain! North Koreans still call him Arthur, the name of his character.

To this day, Dresnok remains in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), as North Korea is officially called. Another defector, Charles Robert Jenkins, has managed to return to the United States. Jenkins has alleged that Dresnok habitually beat up the other defectors on behalf of their DPRK handlers. Jenkins further claims that the women the defectors married in North Korea were kidnapped by DPRK agents in other countries and brought to North Korea against their will. We do know that this was true of Jenkin's own wife (who is Japanese). The documentary mentions Jenkins' allegations and Dresnok's vehement denials.

While Dresnok does his best to sound as an ordinary Joe, he occasionally switches to propaganda mode, praising the Great Leader (Kim Il Sung), attacking the Russians (who are considered weak and treacherous by the North Korean regime for abandoning Communism) and extolling the virtues of Juche (the official ideology of the DPRK). Occasionally, it surfaces that Dresnok's stay in the Great Leader's paradise wasn't entirely unproblematic. In 1966, he and the other defectors attempted to leave the country by seeking asylum at the Soviet embassy (presumably, no Western nation had an embassy in Pyongyang at the time). The attempt failed, and the Americans were subject to North Korean Communist re-education for years afterwards. It's also obvious that all defectors have native handlers who follow them wherever they go. On the plus side, Dresnok's children study at the Pyongyang University, and the regime gave the family sufficient food rations during the famine of the 1990's, which killed millions of ordinary North Koreans.

Joe Dresnok gives a tragic impression. It's difficult to hate the guy (at least for me  I can understand that his buddies in the army might feel different about it). He had a tough childhood and didn't defect for ideological reasons, but for purely personal ones. Once he had crossed the DMZ, there was no turning back. Arthur had no other choice but to adapt to life in the world's most authoritarian and bizarre state. All things considered, he seems to be doing pretty well. His fellow defector Jenkins was also lucky. Due to widespread sympathy in Japan for his case, Jenkins received a light sentence when returning to the United States.

Since the documentary was shot in North Korea, with the permission of the proper authorities, it does have a neutral or even DPRK-ish slant which gets annoying at times. Overall, however, I considered it extremely interesting. I therefore give it four stars.",1459123200,,3008,5.181069958847736
