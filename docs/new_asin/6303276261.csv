615256,4,6303276261,"I can't remember where we first found this movie, in a Goodwill store I think, but I am so glad we did. I have a VHS version and came here to look for a DVD version as my original is wearing out. My children (now 11, 8, 6, 5) have enjoyed this film for the last 4 or 5 years. I keep it put away with all the other 'Christmas' movies and just bring them out at this season. So far this is one of the only ones to be chosen and watched more than once. The quality of the film itself isn't great which is a shame because the sets and costumes are so obviously beautiful. It seems to combine many old fashioned fairy tales and is done in high pantomime fashion. Perhaps it is understandable that I would love the movie despite its technical failings, because of my English background of growing up with the brothers Grimm fairy tales (which I much prefer to the insipid Disney knock offs) and winter-time pantomimes. So that explains why I love it, but my children with no such background and raised on a diet of Pixar still rank this as their favourite seasonal movie. The dubbing is quite well done and they don't even realise yet that it IS dubbed, even tho it is obvious to an adult. The story is fast moving with lots of different twists and turns. There are great characters, the boy Ivan with superhuman strength but completely conceited, Poor little Nasteka, treated like cinderella, the 'ugly stepsister' who cracks nuts in her teeth and spits out the shells and the wicked stepmother who slaps her daughter then offers her a lollipop! There is a mushroom wizard who turns Ivan into a bear, a wooden pig who belongs to an evil witch of Handsel and Gretel vintage, and towards the end the magnificent old Father Frost himself who looks and acts like a wonderful Father Christmas (a European version of Santa). I only gave it 4 stars because of the poor quality of the film itself. I would love to see this film in a really good quality version so that all the costumes and winter scenes could be fully appreciated. My children, who vote by watching, would obviously have given it a 5!!",1325376000,,2089,4.4005167958656335
615257,5,6303276261,"Mystery Science Theater 3000 did a version of this movie over a decade ago, and since seeing it, I always wanted to watch the movie itself, uncut as it was originally presented.  If you are from the U.S., one might have a hard time wrapping his or her head around the concepts in this beautifully produced Russian fairy tale.  Watch it a few times, and you'll be hooked!  Even my kids, who love the MST3K version, appreciated the storytelling of this movie in its' original state.  The DVD transfer is almost perfect, with bold colors and sharp imagery.  There are a handful of great extras as well, including a recent interview with the actress who plays ""Nastenka"".  Amazon provides a great outlet for people to buy these DVD's.  I personally have purchased a few from the seller marinasbooks, and they always arrive quickly and are the best quality.  Regardless of who you buy from, make sure you get this all-region version with enough subtitle options to satisfy anybody.  It even offers Japanese!  And while you're at it, buy the MST3K collection that features the movie as ""Jack Frost"".  It's hilarious!",1292803200,,1110,4.7894736842105265
615258,5,6303276261,"Unbelievably fantastic film!  I cannot say enough about the feelings this film brings.  I have ordered the DVD version and will not be able to review the quality as yet, however; I can say that when it arrives, it will be the first time I have seen the movie since I was 12 years old.  For some reason, they stopped airing this treasure on television many years ago.  I thought it was lost forever.  Joyfully, it still exhists.  In my memory, I would be genuinely gleeful when I saw the entry  in TV GUIDE listing the shows upcoming airing. It is a tale that beckons us to the woods in search of fairies and trolls.  It sends us to our bedtimes and dreams of talking bears, witches and flying over the snow in a magic sleigh.  It brings to mind the innocent, sweet feelings of future romance for which all young girls yearn. Happily Ever After was just a gleen from a star when this this folk tale was born.  It seems to me that the art of storytelling was alive and well in Russis in the 1960's.  Many more movies are listed at various sites.  And now, as an adult, I will be looking forward to receiving my DVD copy.  I will also be researching more Russian Folklore in the future.",1287964800,4,1183,4.274774774774775
615259,5,6303276261,"this is a truly wonderful film.  it is an adaptation of many pagan/ pre-orthodox russian mythological tales combined into one sweet story with more happy endings than perhaps in their original forms.  whoever said this tales doesn't ""travel"" well is....  misinformed.  the story itself if very similar to cinderalla, snow white and sleeping beauty all rolled into one! morozko is a beautiful window into another culture in a time long ago.",1269820800,3,439,5.140845070422535

This is  in Russian, but you can choose to watch it dubbed in English, or with English subtitles.  The story is a blend of old Russian folktales, and offers a different perspective on some classic themes.",1260662400,,365,4.246376811594203
615261,5,6303276261,"I remember watching it when growing up in Russia.
It is one of the best fairytales ever.
The director - Alexander Rou - is a famous russian director. the cast for the movies is exquisite- many very famous russian actors. The witch is played by Alexander Miller.
A very talented russian actress plays spoiled mother's daughter - Inna Churikova - she is delightful in this role - so funny.

After watching Morosko you will understand where the creators of ""lord of the ring"" got an idea for walking trees. They just stole it from this movie.",1229644800,,539,4.614583333333333
615262,5,6303276261,"I love this film!  Well technically it's a kid's film and it ended up on MST300.  Well yes it was really silly, but it was fun to watch!  I couldn't find a time that I was board to tears.

""WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS""

Once there was a pretty young girl with a father and an evil stepmother and fat, stupid and ugly stepsister.  Her stepmother has no love for the girl, the girl's name is Nastenka.  She can somehow talk to the roosters and make the flowers grow from her tears.  She and her father are forced to do house chours, especially her.

Meanwhile in a distant village, there is a very handsome young man named Ivanushka, or Ivan for sort.  Well he's handsome all right, but he's so vain that he holds up a mirror singing about how beautiful he is, how hilarous!  He lets himself get robbed, plays a game with the Mushroom sorcerer, but then when he acts rude to the Mushroom sorcerer, even after he gives him a bow and arrow, the Mushroom sorcerer decides to play a cruel, but good trick on Ivan.

Well Ivan is out searching for a wife.  Well this actor that plays him looks to be about in his late twenties while the actoress that plays  Nastenka looks to be about in her teens.  Well then he meets Nastenka, he's taken by her beauty and asks her to marry him, she rejects, and he sees some bears across the stream, and decides to prove he's worth to her by killing the bears.  She gets mad and puts a bucket over his head, and when she takes it off he's a bear.  Well what do you know, it's the curse that the Mushroom sorcerer put on him.  Well Nastenka faints at the sight of him.  Everyone else runs away from him.  And in order to get his handsome self back he has to do some good deeds.

Well he does some good deeds and he's back to normal, and he's ready to meet up with Nastenka again!  And a lot of events lead to their meeting, from Baba Yaga to Father Frost.  And I'll end the spoilers here.

You'll have to watch the movie for yourself, I'll warn you, it might be a little silly by American standerds, but hey it's a kids movie!  Don't take it too seroiusly!  Watch it and have a good time!  Who knows, maybe you might feel like a kid again! I know I did!",1197331200,2,2178,4.160671462829736
615263,5,6303276261,"And by, ""How did they do it?"" I mean, ""How did they manage to make this  movie so good considering the title character is totally absent until the halfway point of the film?""  That's right.  Jack Frost doesn't show up at all until the movie's half over.  Yet the movie is fantastic.  Let's take a guided tour through it.

First we see our heroine Nastenka knitting stockings at the command of her evil stepmother.  She's a pretty girl with an ugly sister.  Her stepmother spoils the ugly sister while she's treated as a slave.

Nastenka is able to finish knitting the stockings by the deadline her stepmother sets only because she begs the sun to turn back and rise at a later time.  Her reward for meeting the deadline is getting more chores to do.

The film cuts to the male lead of the movie, Ivanushka (or Ivan).  Ivanushka is robbed by bearded thugs, but he doesn't seem to care.  While the thugs are dividing up his money, he throws their clubs into the air and says they'll come back down to Earth next winter.

Ivanushka runs into a magic mushroom elf guy who beats him in a game of hide and seek.  The mushroom guy thanks him for the game and gives him a bow and arrow set.  Ivanushka doesn't show proper thanks to the mushroom guy for the kind gesture, so the mushroom guy waits for an opportune time to mess up Ivan's looks.

No Jack Frost yet.

Shortly after Ivanushka meets our heroine Nastenka and asks the beautiful girl to marry him, the mushroom guy turns Ivan's handsome into the head of an ugly bear.  Ivanushka blames Nastenka for turning him into a freak and runs away.

After Ivanushka figures out the mushroom guy was behind his transformation, he tries to reverse the spell by doing a good deed.  It isn't until he forgets about his own needs and finally does a good deed out of true altruism that the mushroom guy sets Ivanushka back to normal.

Suddenly winter hits.  Ivanushka is looking for Nastenka to apologize for blaming her.  Little does he know Nashtenka was abandoned in the woods by her evil stepmother.  Thankfully, JACK FROST shows up to save her!!  Unfortunately for Nastenka, she touches Jack's wand by mistake and freezes herself.

Ivanushka asks an old witch for help finding Nastenka, and the witch isn't really nice.  She commands a squad of trees to kill him but her plan backfires.  She's forced to help Ivan out.  She tells Ivanushka to follow her magic pig-shaped sleigh through the snow and it will lead her to Nastenka.  Sure enough it does, and he finds the girl he wants to marry frozen in Jack Frost's house.

How will Nastenka ever thaw out?  You'll have to watch Jack Frost to find out.  There are other ways of finding out too, but they're not nearly as fun.  This classic fairytale is highly recommended for all ages.",1159833600,2,2774,4.524193548387097
615264,5,6303276261,"I've never felt the urge to write a review till now.

I just reviewed this film the night before writing this, and this movie was absolutely hilarious!!!!  Of course, I'm not familiar with the original Russian fairy tale, but seriously I couldn't stop laughing!  I'm a huge collector of ususual films, and this one blows others right out of the water!  The weird acting and dialog, was too much!!!  Mushroom people, a wandering man with a bear head, the sun obeying a little girl's will in waiting to rise till she finished knitting the last row on a stocking, a cabin that walks around on giant chicken feet, flying tree people, an oinking wooded pig sled, ... the extremely odd sequences in this film never seem to end!!!  |

Seriously it's the weirdest thing I've seen since ""Earth and Moon in Love""!

Guaranteed, to be placed next to other favorite films of sheer random weirdness like ""K. Gordon Murray's Santa Claus"", ""Troll 2"", ""Mr. Vampire 3"", or even ""Crazy Sufari: The Gods Must Be Crazy pt. 3""!

This film holds an honorable place in next week's Incredibly Strange Movie Night :) Forget the MST3K version, this film is a total riot by itself!

615265,2,6303276261,"Alesandr Rou's fairy tales don't travel well. They are very Russian and hard to understand outside of the USSR. He made many films of this type but I have not enjoyed any of them. This one makes no sense. If you want a good Russian faity tale get THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA, also very Russian but quite different, great fun and understandable.",1110240000,,341,4.428571428571429
615292,2,6303276261,"Frankly, this movie is the pits.  There's a reason it was included in the Mystery Science Theater lineup, and unsurprisingly it's because what you've got here is a bizarrely staged fairy tale that fails on oh-so-many levels.  The costumes and sets are hokey, the dubbing is atrocious, the effects are ridiculous, and even as budgetary constraints prevented the film from looking as magical as a fairy tale should, the filmmakers apparently decided that they could make up for it with the sort of slapstick that will appeal only to slow children under the age of ten.  Entertaining only as schlock.",1063843200,3,597,4.95
615293,5,6303276261,"A wonderful movie for both adults and children.  Laughs and maybe some tears.  Some tech details left off Amazon's page:  languages: Russian, also dubbed English and French; subtitles: Russian, English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Italian, and Japanese. Remixed to Dolby 5.1 (variable quality, sometimes electronically reprossed for stereo, some mono); full screen; 84 minutes; among the extras: an interview with the grown-up lead actress (what a change!).  There are two versions: one with the title MOPO3KO on the cover playable in all regions (my copy), and this one.  The first you can find in Russian stores.  If you're learning Russian, this is probably beyond second year, but you can follow the subtitles.  Very good picture quality.  Totally enjoyable.  Now one of my all-time favorites.

615294,4,6303276261,This is a cute Russian childrens classic.  A must for any childs international library of DVDs.  The DVD itself has been excelantly converted to dvd format far passing many other conversions that I have seen.,1016755200,,208,4.914285714285715
615295,5,6303276261,"i saw this as a Mystery Science Theater 3000 feature (in case you didn't know, that's a now-cancelled TV program wherein a man & his two robots watched terrible movies & made fun of them, w/great success). anyhow, most MST3K movies provoke hatred in viewers because of their intense stupidity, but i only remember this one w/affection--it's absolutely adorable! made in 1964, filmed in Finland, i believe, w/gorgeous costumes & beautiful scenery. what a wonderful, silly, adorable movie!!!",1003881600,9,489,5.282051282051282
615296,5,6303276261,"This is one of the greatest kids movies made back in the Sixties. Plot is based on the 1000+ year old tale (yes, thats before Shakespeare and even before most of the Brother Grimms tales were first told). This is certainly not a movie for a Generation X-Y-Z kid(""What do you mean they couldn't do no computer animation back there?!!!""). Think of it as a Russian ""Wizard of OZ"", an instant hit for it's time but now just a nostalgic piece of art, interesting for historians or real cinema fans. This is one of the few movies that is remembered 40 years after it was released (and who will remember 90% of today's ""hits"" even 10 years from now?). This is definitely not a film for wide audience today, but it doesn't make it less entertaining and you will definitely enjoy it.",985478400,12,774,4.457746478873239
615297,5,6303276261,"I think that Jack Frost is a very good movie.  It teaches many good things such as honesty and respect(episode of Ivan and mushroom-man). Teach us that lazy and wicked person  will be finally panished, for example, as this happen to the stepsister. In the opposite, kind and honest person will be rewarded. Maybe, this fairytale seems silly for some adults but children will love it.",981158400,10,383,4.787878787878788
615298,5,6303276261,"For some reason this film is distributed under the misnamed title ""Jack Frost"".  It is actually ""Morozko"", a beloved folktale from Russia's pre-Christian past.  This typically convoluted tale  provided the origens of many stories [more recognizable to Westerners] in  Grimm's fairytale collection.  It is necessary to remember that this movie  was made for very young children, and is intentionally simplistic.  Its  ""good"" characters are very sweet and pretty, its ""bad""  ones are very unpleasant and ugly, and its moral lessons very clear for  little viewers.  Keeping that in mind, parents and other adults can enjoy  its gorgeous settings (snow, troikas, little heathen villages, Sacred  Birches), its traditional folk costumes, charming pagan story, and magical  characters like mushroom sorcerer and troll bandits.  Too bad the dubbed  English translation is so poor!  Of course the ""hunchbacked  fairy"" is actually the witch Baba Yaga, whose cat-familiar carries out  her deranged commands, and whose enchanted hut stalks about on its huge  chicken-legs. ""Jack"" Frost is actually Grandfather Frost, in  pagan times the rather fearsome Slavic god of winter, and more recently a  kindly ""Father Christmas"".  Yes, this film does tell ""quite  a lot about Russians"" -- as you watch, recall that this colorful,  whimsical,  little romp delighted families during ""humorless""  Soviet times in the so-called ""Evil Empire""...  I am certain the  MST3K version of this film is absolutely hilarious!  But to tell the truth,  ""Morozko"" spoofs itself and is funny enough on its own -- even  without the running commentary of Crowww and comrades.",959126400,68,1637,5.424

615300,3,6303276261,"I, too, saw this on Mystery Science Theater.  I have to admit, it reminded me very much of the Ukrainian fairy tales I grew up with as a child.  Yes, they were this two-dimensional and wacky--the witch, the wicked stepmother  and stepsister, the strapping young cossack who is transformed into another  creature--all these are staples in Ukrainian and Russian folklore.  So in  that respect, it would probably make an entertaining children's movie.  Otherwise, a good B-movie for those parties where you're feeling, um,  surreal.",914889600,2,529,5.214285714285714
