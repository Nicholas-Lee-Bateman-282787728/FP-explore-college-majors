7832481,5,6302965349,The quality of the VHS is as expected considering when it was produced and our VCR is old. I was ecstatic to see the burned DVD created by the seller so we may enjoy this classic favorite at a better quality. Thanks so much!!,1377907200,,225,4.136363636363637

7832483,1,6302965349,"You think this film would be about having a pet monster,not have a boy turn into a pet monster. So even the set-up is flawed. The Monster in the film looks nothing like the toy. It looks like Rainbow Brite's poop. Everything in this movie is lazy:the story,the writing & the monster. It also focus more on the dog show plot then the kid. There are also homosexual overtones between the 2 bullies. I mainly dislike how everyone mistakes the monster for a dog. A DOG for crying out load. The villians are morons. The ending is too dark for little kids and also pointless. Overall,Don't buy and/or rent it ever. I give this tape a 1 out of 10.",1288828800,2,640,4.341666666666667
7832484,3,6302965349,"I bought this cause I couldn't for the life of me remember how it ended... I found out why too. It really don't end it just kinda drops the story after a dog show like they had already planned for the second movie, but were shocked when they weren't green-lit. Anyways its an OK movie at best, good times 'cause I grew up watching it, but I would be out of my mind to think any kid today will sit through such a film. Plus its never gonna get dropped on DVD. So skip this if you can.",1260748800,,483,3.938775510204082
7832485,4,6302965349,"Please Please PLEASE bring this to DVD.

I was excited to see Garbage Pail Kids on DVD...but I want My Pet Monster!
For a ""straight to video"" release...this was/is a pretty good one and is filled with childhood memories.  I beg of you...put this one on of them newfangled shiny discs!!!",1225152000,,286,4.588235294117647
7832486,5,6302965349,"""My Pet Monster"" is a live action straight-to-video film based around the toy. It's not related to the cartoon series of the same name, though it features the monster.

Max, the boy of the story, is exposed to a Babylonian artifact in a museum, which transforms him into a monster. The museum curator, Mr Snider, finds out and wants to capture Max, while his sister speculates about whether or not Max now has monster powers. He does, but even without them he's pretty frightening. So much so, he accidentally scares his older brother's girlfriend's dog Tippy, wilting her poodle perm. Dognapping, kidnapping and monster-napping follows, all coming to a head at the dog show. Will Max be able to put things right?

For a straight to video release, its got some pretty good special effects, and a witty (but cheesy) script. It's good fun.",1168041600,5,837,4.805555555555555
7832487,4,6302965349,"I may be older, but I still love this movie. Not only could it still be watched for good family viewing, but for people in the 18-21 age group it brings back good memories. I'm sure many of us remember the awesome My Pet Monster plush toy that at one point it seemed every child needed. If you haven't given it a watch in a while, I suggest doing it.",1068163200,6,350,4.014285714285714
