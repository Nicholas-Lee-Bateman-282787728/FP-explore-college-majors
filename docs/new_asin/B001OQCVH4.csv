3733899,4,B001OQCVH4,"I don't think anyone would go to MBV3D expecting to see an award-winning sweeping horror film, and it isn't, but it is still pretty enjoyable. The action is well-paced, and the downtime isn't boring because it is used to explain the plot more. The 3-D aspect is completely necessary for this movie to be enjoyed, however, because it is used in all of the right places. I would not want to be stuck seeing this without having the sharp end of a pick ax pointed at me. There were only a few cheap jump scares that didn't scare me in the least - they were more of an annoyance. The ending welcomes a sequel, and I expect one, but I've also seen this ending in more than one recent horror film - it's textbook stuff. I would recommend you see this in 3-D only, to get the full experience, and appreciate the movie for what it is... pure entertainment.",1232236800,,847,4.333333333333333
3733900,4,B001OQCVH4,"Saw this over the weekend.  My bloody valentine is an above average slasher flick.  Jason Vorhees is an ametuer compared to Harry Warden.  This guy is violent.  3D graphics were well done and the cast did a better then fair job of acting.  The only reason that I didn't give this a 5 star review is there are some glaring plot holes, but, hey we don't go to these kinds of movies for absolute realism.  Do we?  One very lengthy scene of femal full frontal nudity.  Can you say beaver anyone?  Yea that was nice.  It was a blast",1232150400,2,527,4.232323232323233
3733901,4,B001OQCVH4,"I watched the original a few days before I saw this to get ready for the remake! I had the pleasure of seeing this with my ex-girlfriend, whom I haven't seen in eight months. (We're still friends.) We both thought this remake was pretty good. I loved all the gory deaths and thought all the deaths with the pickaxe were very creative! The remake is pretty different than the original. Ten years after a Valentine's Day Massacre, Tom Hanniger returns to Harmony to sell the coal mine. Soon after, the murders start again. Another part I loved was when the smokin' hot naked girl was running around and trying to get away from the coal miner. I didn't get to see it in 3D, but that was okay. If you love horror, gore, sex, and chocolate, I highly recommend that you be MY BLOODY VALENTINE!!!",1232150400,,789,4.448275862068965
3733902,4,B001OQCVH4,"""My Bloody Valentine 3D"" is a remake of the 1981 film by the same title.  The plot remains the same, a crazy killer donning a miner's suit wielding a pickaxe is picking off people one by one.  While this is in essence the same film just updated, it delivers much more than the original ever could.

""My Bloody Valentine 3D"" doesn't take itself too seriously.  After all it is a slasher film and it doesn't require terrific acting (which surprisingly wasn't bad), serious storytelling or even plot depth.  Movies like this can make you feel repulsed by gore and laugh at the same time.  Add in first rate 3D effects and it just makes the film all the more fun and all the more entertaining.  It still has all the horror/slasher movie clichs; gorgeous women (sometimes naked for long periods of time), gruesome murders, gore galore, a few suspenseful moments and a killer who uses one weapon of choice and apparently never dies.

Overall ""My Bloody Valentine 3D"" was better than expected.  The 3D effects add something new to a film that is a remake.  It's recommended you go see it before the Miner comes for you!",1232150400,2,1112,4.598984771573604
3733903,4,B001OQCVH4,"I just had a blast with this remake of 1981's My Bloody Valentine. The cast is pretty good (lots of people you might recognize, but no big names), the dialogue is a little better than your average slasher and most of all the kills are very creative, with the gore taken to the extreme at times. The miner is an intimidating killer and looks scary, but sadly the movie really isn't (just some minor suspense moments). Oh, I almost forgot to mention that there are a few hot chicks and one of them runs around buck naked for nearly 5 minutes in 3-D. This flick is just sounding better and better right?

The digital 3-D presentation is a must for horror fans. The picture is crystal clear and it gives the film so much depth you really feel like you are part of the story. If buckets of blood, body parts and one mean pickaxe flying at you sounds like a good time, then go see this one before it leaves theaters. Now the regular 2-D version might be a different story.",1232064000,2,966,4.3076923076923075

3733961,5,B001OQCVH4,"You have to keep in mind this is basically a B-Movie with some B-List stars. This is also a remake of a 1970's movie. Sure the ending is fairly predictable, but it's also good about making you second guess your prediction because they know you probably predicted the ending. The acting isn't horrible, because everyone in the movie is good at being ""themselves"". Think of Jensen as playing Dean Winchester if Dean Winchester were in an alternative universe with an alternate family history. If you can approach the movie with that level of tolerance the rest of the movie is just fine. I recommend it for Halloween Parties where you want Cheep Thrills for the squeamish and eye rolls for the true Horror fans. If you're looking for something that will make you think, make you scream or keep you up at night - might I recommend, The Strangers or It Follows. If you want something disturbing try Funny Games.

How many ways can you kill with a pick ax would be a better title. We stuck with it because the mine scenes and the location shots keep your interest as well as the who gets killed next aspect. Stay with it for the running naked scene and that should get a chuckle. A 5.5 IMDb score is really pushing it. My favorite lines were: You make us look like an inbred mining community and the answer was We are an inbred mining community. All the gore actually added some humorous moments but its not enough to carry the film and I suspect any humor at all was unintentional and unintentional is how you should start watching it.",1506211200,2,811,4.342105263157895
3733977,4,B001OQCVH4,"At first when I had heard about this movie being remade back in early 2009 when I first saw the trailer, I had many concerns about whether or not this movie would show any respect for the source material that the excellent 1981 slasher gave us and that has been celebrated for nearly 30 years.  I have to admit that it all looked tempting from them selling it with the 3-D element and coming up with a creative ad for it.

Well I would say that how good this remake is is based simply more on how thrilling it is by its own merits and not in contrast with the original.  As I see it both versions are great in their own special ways.  I won't be comparing this version and the original but rather just to state what is good about this version solely.

The opening credits are awesome visually as computer effects(intended in particular for the 3-D aspect of this movie) are used to show a series of newspaper articles regarding the several slayings brought on by Harry Warden during Valentine's day.

Harry Warden still has a massively menacing appearance with the dark creepy miner's get up.  Once he walks steadily but surely with his big pickaxe you know that things are going to get freaky, brutal, and messy with him leaving few to no survivors.

The intensity, gore, and kills are all very well handled.  The miner is vicious, scary, and unrelenting in his brutality making for one intense serial killer with no limits to what he'll do.  He especially goes from biding his time in the shadows of the mine to subduing his victims with small effort.  As for the gore well it's awesomely bloody and graphic even in the aftermath.  The gore design may not be entirely as impressive as the practical gore shown in the extended version of the original but the gore showcased here still gets the job done in it's gruesomeness.  The kills don't vary a whole lot in execution but the masterful way that Harry wield his pickaxe through people's mouths and chests are remarkably done.

There's not as much nudity as there should have been but still there is still one bit of nudity that is sweet and enjoyable.

As for the actors well, Jensen Ackles did a great job as Tom Hanniger, gorgeous and smokin' hot Jaime King is good here and there as the lovely Sarah Palmer, horror movie veteran Tom Atkins was great as always playing Sheriff Burke, but Kerr Smith as Axel Palmer he really sucked.  Not only was his acting terrible but he was cheesy looking, not believable as a small town cop, and most of all he just couldn't hold a candle to Neil Affleck.

The cinematography by Brian Pearson was beautifully and fully shot showcasing gorgeous pictures of the forest, the town of Harmony, the well-lit yet creepy mine, the lovely interiors of the police station, the bridge over water and beyond, the grocery store, and interiors of the character's houses.  I also am highly impressed by the creepy and chilling dark and dreary night scenes.

The fight choreography at the end is intriguing and lots of fun to watch as well.

The 3-D aspect of this movie is really cool and it makes this movie all the more fun to watch.",1506124800,2,3113,4.534883720930233

(I'm look at you, 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre) In this case, the original My Bloody Valentine is just OK. There is no blasphemy in remaking films that didn't really execute the first time. Not only is this remake and really fun and well executed film, the 3D is amazing! I've honestly never seen 3D this clear on a DVD. I have a copy of Friday the 13th 3 on DVD in 3D and it's a lot of fun, but the old red lens/blue lens 3D has a tendency to be kind of dark and the images don't really pop. The glasses that came with this DVD are red lens/green lens and I don't know what makes it work better (science? sorcery?) but it truly looks 3D.

Wished they had extended a little more on the plot and give more character development (which is a good idea!)...

Like other fans, and to be honest with you, I did wondered why they didn't make a sequel to the original My Bloody Valentine (1981), the reasonable likely answer is due to its initial budget and other problems at that time...

There are few differences between the original and the remake, mostly noticeable the movie's bad guy Villain (the original has Alex/Harry Warden as the killer -- while in the remake, the real killer is TOM HANNIGER, due to his split-personality ego ""Harry"").

He is especially hated by the corrupt and morally bankrupt sheriff Axel (Kerr Smith).  Bad history and a woman stand between them.  And then the pickaxe wielding miner goes on the rampage again.

This movie was released around at 3D hype, but as all were of the time it ends up looking a little cheesy although it wasn't that bad at all in a theatre. That being said you can tell the obvious ""woah 3D"" and i feel like it does take away a bit on the horror.

Other than that tiny detail it was pretty great all in all. The costumes and makeup were good. Good acting. Sound and lighting were done well (nothing ruins a jump scare more than either not hearing the sound cues or not being able to see it happen).

If they ever make a sequel i would be there to watch it when it was released, and would deffinantly watch this one again.",1440115200,,773,4.045751633986928

3734329,5,B001OQCVH4,"WARNING: This movie is NOT for kids or even teens. Recommended age 18-20+

This movie takes place in a small mining town, but it has a secret. 20 years back, a local miner brutally murdered 22 people with a single pick axe. He was sent to a mental hospital because he suffered a coma and people thought he was finally dead. They were wrong. Now the axe wielding maniac is on his never ending killing spree, waiting for his next victim.

REVIEW: This movie is VERY GRAPHIC! I have never seen anything like it. People get killed in the most brutal of ways with an axe. I recommend having a strong stomach and maybe a barf bag.

BLOOD & GORE- As the title implies, this movie is bloody. Enough said.
LANGUAGE: Constant uses of the ""F"" bomb, a few sexual terms and other minor language.
DRUGS & ALCOHOL- A few scenes of young adults smoking and drinking at a party for example.
INTENSE VIOLENCE/TERROR- Yes! This movie is very intense and very jumpy with tons of unexpected scares.
SEXUAL CONTENT- Very graphic. View at your own risk. A woman is seen running totally nude for about 5min straight.

Now a big thing with this movie is the 3D. I was very skeptical with this because some 3D movies don't deliver a good impression. This movie is a direct opposite. This  is a true 3D movie and its got some of the best 3D effects I  have ever seen!. Besides having the many ,many ""Pop Out 3D"" moments, but it puts you in the movie ex) environments. Now some HDTV's don't like 3D movies like this so for me, I had to do some minor tweaking with the contrast etc.

Oh and just to clarify, this is a REGULAR DVD and not a Blu-Ray. It is also double sided which means youll have to read the disc label to see if Side A or B has the actual 2D or 3D version. This also comes with (4) pairs of 3D glasses. Don't miss the opportunity to by this movie. Its actually quite tuff to find and its one of the best 3D movie to date.

And it does a sloppy job accomplishing that too. Trust me, folks, its not worth your time. Also, for the Jensen Ackles fan girls out there, skip this title.

3734428,5,B001OQCVH4,"Let's be clear here. The original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is no dud of a movie. It is quite good, quite bloody and very scary. To me, what makes MY BLOODY VALENTINE 3d better is that the people who made it, looked at the original and said, 'we have to take what was already done and go further with it'. They put in a lot of gore, a lot of nudity, and they fixed the problem that I had with the original movie, which was the Sarah-Axel-JT love triangle.
In the original, JT just drops Sarah on her ass and runs off on her and they're expecting the audience is supposed to be rooting for this selfish prick and when he comes back, he expects everyone to just pave the way and make things easier for him. You could argue, 'Well, in the original, Axel was the killer.' We don't know that, until the last five minutes of the movie.
Also, considering that JT up and leaves Sarah, that she would actually WANT to go back to this guy. Not easy to build sympathy for her.
In the new version, we see Axel is a little bit of a prick, who is insecure. He's in love with a woman, who he knows isn't as in love with him as he in with her. He cheats on her, so when JT comes back into town, it makes a little more sense why Sarah would consider wanting him. JT doesn't come off as crappy, because we know why he ran off in this one. Running into a killer, messed him up, mentally. A little soap-opera, but they make it entertaining.
Instead of just ripping off ALL the kilings from the original, they actually come up with some on their own and the effects is quite good.
The women are fantastically hot and they never come off as bitchy that you couldn't care about them (even the girl who screws Sarah's husband has a likable quality to her).
Tom Atkins is in this movie, which is always a GREAT thing.

Now onto the movie. I really loved this movie from the first time I saw it. I haven't seen the original but I really want to now. This movie is far from predictable and has an amazing story line, at least I think so. Not many super well known actors, best known is probably Jensen Ackels because he is one of the main characters in Supernatural (amazing show by the way). The ending will blow your mind.

The storyline and acting are nothing to write home about, and are pretty much slasher boiler-plate. Where this movie shines, however, is in the 3D presentation. It is fantastic and proves my theory that the only movies that really should be in 3D are horror movies. Be sure however that you get the actual 3D Blu Ray and not the Blu Ray/DVD combo that comes with the red/blue 3D glasses because this version stinks in 3D. This 3D Blu Ray really takes advantage of the technology and turns a standard horror film presentation and amps it up ten fold.",1380585600,3,784,4.64748201438849

3734529,4,B001OQCVH4,"The 3d in this movie is very good as it comes to depth. They even attempt to do quite a bit of out of your screen 3d, but I will be honest.  The out of your screen 3d is barely out of your screen.  Since I've watched over 20 3d movies on my 3dtv I will say it does come out of your screen more than the other dvd's, but seriously the 3d is barely out of your screen. I come from the generation of Terminator at Universal Studios and sadly the Muppets at Universal and the bad Freddie Kruger movie but great out of the screen 3d generation.  These attempts now at out of the screen are sad.
As far as the movie goes it is a good slasher movie with a surprise ending and well acted movie. I enjoyed it a lot and I'm not a fan of slashers (although I have watched more than a hundred).  When it comes to simple slasher teen movies with a nice plot and twist without being corny or trying too hard to be cool this movie does great. It is shot very well and uses 3d perfectly when it comes to depth.

Just a sidenote: I think the movie industry knows audiences want out of the screen 3d, but they want to profit off 3d and 2d movies when they hit shelves in stores and if someone doesn't have a 3d tv (which 99% of the world doesn't) then the out-of-the screen parts of the movie look corny on 2d tv's. Knowing this to be the case, hollywood producers, distributors, and directors have taken off in the media and blogs to lie to audiences telling them that out of the screen 3d is not what audiences want and then stupid regular people go and sign-off on this too. Not like it's a conspiracy, just the fact that dvd's mostly in 2d make more money than truly investing in all the aspects and options of 3d (mainly pop out 3d).",1371772800,,1720,4.076923076923077

3734588,3,B001OQCVH4,"This is a review for the steroscopic version of My Bloody Valentine on Bluray 3D as opposed to the anaglyph version.
The difference being the anaglyph versions of this film come with small 3D glasses,and the film will look red and blue while watching.
That's what I call ""old school"" 3D so to speak.
My review is for the Bluray 3D version that requires a 3D TV.

With all the technical jargon out of the way here we go.

This remake starts out strong giving us quiet a bit of gore straight from the get go. unfortunately, My Bloody Valentine 3D only seems to decline the further you get into it,which is a crying shame considering the first half is so vicious. The best analogy that comes to mind is a heavy weight boxer with mediocre cardio. He'll hit you hard the first few rounds but after that the fight in him slows down dramatically. By the end, it almost feels like a  Scooby Doo whodunit with a mix of Scream for good measure.
It's not as ""trippy"" as the original in it's presentation and though it's more visceral than Urban Legend or I know What You Did Last Summer, it still,by the ending,feels like it's riding on the coat tails of those franchises rather than adding something refreshing to the genre. At times it has that old spirit of the classic 80's slashers but the glimpses are only fleeting.

The 3D.

The 3D in this film for me helps make the sell.  It's  simply great,and you can find this movie for damn near pennies. I found it at a local used movie shop for 5.99,and yes that was for the 3D Bluray. It has everything you would want from a horror movie in 3D. The occasional pop out effect,with enough depth to keep it from feeling simply like a gimmick.
If you're new to 3D movies and TV's,with a budget that isn't very large you can't go wrong by picking this movie up. The 3D certainly adds to the experience and for that reason alone I would recommend this movie for any 3D library.",1361664000,7,1910,4.363380281690141

3734596,4,B001OQCVH4,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed 2009's ""My Bloody Valentine"" since these types of horror films are a dime a dozen. ""My Bloody Valentine"" is a remake of a 1981 film, which I've never seen, but it includes most of the vital elements for an effective slasher movie.

What I mean by ""these types of horror films"" are the ones that follow the basic formula so well established by the ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" franchises -- a crazy masked killer and a group of youths in a specific environment, whether a town, camp, forest, college, resort, building, etc. In this case it's a mining town, shot in Kittanning and Bethel, PA, and points nearby along the Allegheny River (which are my stomping grounds, btw). So the film gets a big plus for filming somewhere other than British Columbia! (Not that there's anything wrong with BC, of course, but enough is enough).

Beautiful women is a must for these types of films and ""My Bloody Valentine"" delivers superbly with Jaime King, Megan Boone and Betsy Rue, the latter in an extended nude scene, which I think is unnecessary, but some might appreciate it.

Most importantly, the story keeps your attention and also keeps you guessing as to the identity of the killer till the very end. Great job on this front.

The film runs 101 minutes.

Having seen both, and enjoyed both, this version is NOT as gory as the original. So if you're looking for gore, this won't have much. I did like this film though. I liked it enough to buy it.

 It looks as if it was specifically shot to be seen in 3-D too, you can tell that certain things would have been VERY neat looking in 3-D when you watch the 2-D version (which is still great even in 2-D). I didn't like the way everything felt like it was shot digitally I think, and parts of it look a little low budget video but overall, it's a small price to pay for what turned out to be amazing 3-D fun.

3734635,4,B001OQCVH4,"Overall, I liked it and would recommend it. It's a gory, bloody, cheesy slasher movie. Heavy on gore, lighter on logic - exactly what it claims to be.

The plot started out strong and finished strong, the middle was weaker, the dialog meandered in places, and the killings were graphic.  Really, really graphic, but not overly disturbing--too over the top or maybe I'm just desensitized??  They built characterizations they didn't use and spend time on scenes that didn't seem to advance the plot. Plus it had more frontal nudity than I expected and surprisingly, it didn't annoy me as much as it usually does.

I'm not going to comment on Jensen character ""Tom"" too much before you see the movie, but I think Jensen nailed the role and it's only apparent how good a job he did after you watch the movie.

For you Supernatural fans, ""Dean Winchester"" is not in this movie and if you are expecting ""Tom"" to act like ""Dean"", you will be sorely disappointed.  About the only similarities are the wardrobe.  ""Tom"" is a normal person that has had lots of horrible things happen around him.  He's confused and off-kilter and trying his best to adjust to everything that has happened.  Or maybe not.  There is enough ambiguity that it's not clear who's the predator and who's the prey until the very end.

Not a bad waste of time.  I watched the 2D version for this review and probably won't watch the 3D version (3D gives me headaches) but I will definitely watch the 2D version again and probably drag my husband along for the show.",1344038400,,1527,4.614814814814815

But Harry Warden is in a coma, so since he was the only one alive everyone concludes Harry killed everyone in the collapsed mine to save himself. So the best way for Warden to prove his innocence is to of course wake up on Valentine's Day and murder 22 people, then get killed by the local sheriff. Only a few survivors are left and one of them returns to the town 10 years later, Tom Harringer (Jensen Ackles, TV's ""Supernatural"") is back in the town of Harmony where it all happened, and also to sell his father's mine where the murders occured.

Since this is taking place around Valentine's Day again, what are the chances of oh say Mr. Warden making a return to Harmony? Well if you've ever seen any of these type of films then you know its a forgone conclusion and what follows is a bunch of grisly murders all done in fairly goofy and often hilarious fashion.

Its honestly the type of horror film where you have to check your brain at the door, the writing and story are just a backdrop for the death and chase scenes. The acting is at least acceptable, Jensen is a capable lead who can carry this type of flick well.

I was fortunate mine was a little scuffed and was able to buff them off with disc cleaner.) I haven't seen alot of 3D movies. I loved this 3D. It has the Red and Green glasses not Red and Blue nor the new high tech shutter. I can't afford the new 3D  TVs with the shutter glasses so that is why I really liked this verson.  The movie takes place in a town called Harmony NOT Valentine Bluffs. There is a few of the same characters in it that were in the first.

3734738,2,B001OQCVH4,"Okay, first of all, since there's a laughable number of reviews here that seem to expect wonders from the normal Blu-Ray (i.e., not Blu-Ray 3D) movie, I need to mention that I purchased the Blu-Ray 3D edition, the one intended for viewing on 3D televisions and active-shutter glasses (or whatever is applicable to the technology used - point is, no Magenta/Cyan or anything like that).

The most damning problem with this movie is that there is a terrific amount of crosstalk. I've viewed several video games, and at least half a dozen other 3D movies on my TV, including both animations (such as Despicable Me or How To Train Your Dragon) and live action (possibly mixed with animation; including a couple underwater documentaries, and Avatar, courtesy of HBO on Comcast cable). I've never seen ghosting this bad in anything before. In many places it was beyond distracting, and I kept messing with the equipment, trying different pairs of glasses, etc, to try and correct the issue. It's not correctable. Given that I already expected the movie's content to be mediocre at best, this was a big let-down.

The story and script are pretty bad. Not the worst horror movie ever written, and probably pretty average for slasher movies (which is why I don't really watch them often), but basically devoid of any creativity or intelligence.

The one positive point is that the special effects are extremely good throughout, and when combined with the 3D in one of those rare moments when the ghosting isn't horrible, it can really be very striking.

I'm sorry to have purchased this movie, as I'm quite certain I'll have no interest in seeing it again. The only reason I got it was because it's currently the only 3D horror movie aside from (I think?) Saw 3D, but it's difficult to enjoy the 3D through all the many scenes with doubled images (it's really almost constant, and as I said, very very distracting).",1307145600,,1906,4.819571865443425
3734739,3,B001OQCVH4,"I have never seen the original version of this film, this being a remake and in 3D which seems to be all the craze as of late. I currently have a UN55c6300 TV (NON 3d) and a bd-c5500 Blu Ray Player (NON 3d as well).

I had noticed on some 3d Blu rays it says Blu Ray 3D and while others come with chintzy little paper glasses and also claim to be 3D. The difference being that for the newer versions with the 3D logo you will need actual 3d glasses (some being very pricey), a 3D t.v. and a 3d blu ray player and 3d movie of course. Since both my TV and Blu Ray player do not have 3D capabilities I decided to check out this chintzy with paper glasses version as Walmart had it on sale for $6 plus tax with free site to store shipping.

The movie starts out feeling a little bit like an ""I know what you did last summer"" type of film with fingers being pointed in each direction concerning a copy cat murderer in town. Most of the characters are pretty standard fare and not very likable. I enjoyed the ending and some of the chase scenes for what they were, campy good fun. Don't expect a thinking movie, but the twists will keep you fairly intrigued.

I have yet to watch the 2D version which also came on this disc with the 3D and Digital Copy. The 3D version looked decent when my eyes were able to settle in and really stare, otherwise it didn't stand out all to well through out the film. Also with the 3D technology they used (paper glasses and all), didn't have a great effect through out the film and it completely washes out most colors.

I thought the movie was OK, and a good little slasher flick, the 3D technology wasn't great. But it was a fun little ride and probably good for a Halloween or in this case Valentine's Day movie ;)

I will admit, though, I wasn't sure who was doing all the killings until the end of the movie.

3734743,4,B001OQCVH4,"Ok, first thing I'm going to say is that MANY people do NOT set their TVs up right (or at all) to view red/blue or magenta/green (aka red/green) 3D movies correctly.

You need to turn your brightness up high, not so high it's washed out of course, and then just tweak your color settings. I did so at a good 3D scene in the movie until the magenta/green (in this case) ghosting was nearly ZERO. Of course you may see it here and there, but once setup right you can watch this movie and absolutely enjoy it.

Once you're setup right this movie is an absolute joy to watch in 3D on a 1080p HDTV. Yes, the movie is a bit campy and silly, but the 3D is really well done. There are scenes in the mines and the forest that are absolutely awesome looking. Trees, cave walls, bushes, etc...all stretch back into the screen as if you could reach into it.

Just a warning to some, there is a very adult scene in this movie...and it lasts for a good 5 minutes..LOL...but it's hilarious if you're of age. Don't let the kids sit in on this one. (There's extended full frontal of a female)

In the end I HIGHLY recommend this 3D Blu-Ray to anyone that likes B movie slashers/thrillers. Remember, you CAN WATCH THIS without having a 3D TV or a 3D Blu-Ray player. You only need an HDTV and regular Blu-Ray player. This is probably about as good as it gets without spending thousands on 3D tvs, glasses, and players.",1285632000,,1399,4.307984790874524

3734770,4,B001OQCVH4,"I saw it in the theater when it first came out. I had not seen the original, but knew enough of the basic plot from reading about the first film online.

This to me was not so much a sequel, but an attempt at rebooting the series. In either event, I found it to be a delight, though a slightly squishy one. There are numerous gory effects and all are enhanced by the 3D process. That may seem an odd statement to make, but it's true: the reason is that the movie makers did not go wimply for flying body parts in your face (and they certainly ARE there), but rather the idea of sitting you down in the center of the scene and letting you look around; everything that should stand out does; everything that should not, doesn't.

In fact, the entire movie was - for my money - gloriously rendered in 3D. What I mean by that is there are scenes that are NOT gory that look marvelous here; one scene between the lead female and one of the lead males (it's been a long time since I saw it, ok!) in the grocery store is brilliant because of the approach mentioned above.

The mystery in the film, while it might be predictable at times, was a delight at the end as I tried to figure out who was who, and what might be what. The finale left the door wide open for sequels, and if another can be made that is as enjoyable as this one, more power to them.

The acting was actually far above par for a movie like this, and it's a joy to see Kevin Tighe (of ""Emergency!"" fame) back on the silver screen. The guy looks great and he nearly steals every last scene he's in.

Bottom line: it's not to be missed. It's just so much doggone fun in 3D that no matter how gross I found some of the killings, I could not tear myself away from it.",1275782400,,1725,4.091715976331361

3734772,4,B001OQCVH4,"A movie titled My Bloody Valentine is clearly non trying to pander to art house crowds, nor does it even seem to be reaching for a higher ilk in the horror genre, but while appearing as a fully tacky horror movie entry (a 3-D remake) My Bloody Valentine succeeds in avoiding and ultimately reviving the never ending pitfalls of such films; a strong, unique opening and a surprising and completely plausible, non-ridiculous finale.

Unfortunately the movie is not as strong as its bookend acts, but it is certainly gory, fun, terrifying, tense and nothing but entertaining. (And yes, there is also nudity). The use of the trademark, in your face, 3-D tactics is mostly restrained, although it seems that director Patrick Lussier (who has mostly been in horror movie limbo since he directed Dracula 2000) could not avoid the intermittent pickaxe to the screen. The performances are actually quite strong, and while this is becoming more the norm in horror films, MBV even forgoes the smart-alecky, prankster character which removes the propensity for us to be taken out of the film.

The unique opening is actually a three-tier start. Flashing newsreels reveal that the collapse of the Hanniger Mine in a small town which claimed the lives of 6 miners (Or was it something else that killed the men?). Awakening from a comma years later, the sole survivor of the cave-in, Harry Warden, picks up where he left off, slaying dozens before being killed himself concluding what the town dubbed the Valentines Day Massacre. But all is not what it seems, as 10 years later Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles), a near-victim of Warden, returns to the small town to sell the mine but the killings suspiciously begin once again and it is up to Tom to clear his name.

My Bloody Valentine is a full-fledged throwback to the golden age of slasher films, like Friday the 13th (and is ironically better then the Friday remake this year) and never for a single second tries to be anything it's not and in doing so, it ultimately becomes something it shouldn't be; fun.",1275350400,,2043,4.814814814814815

3734804,4,B001OQCVH4,"Surviving an attack by a madman with a pickaxe, is the horrific situation faced by terrified victims, in My Bloody Valentine (2009), a remake of the 1981 slasher classic.  It is a very scary, graphically violent, modern retelling of the legend of Harry Walker, the miner who turned into a pickaxe wielding murderer.

In this version, the Valentine's Day aspect is emphasized less, as instead of Valentine's Bluff, the setting is in a town called Harmony, and the killings have no connection to a Valentine's Day dance.  As before, after a mining accident, Harry Walker goes homicidal, killing his coworkers.  On Valentine's Day, after being in a coma for year, he resumes his killing spree at a mental institution.  Returning to the Hanniger mine, Warden attacks a group of college kids.  Among them are Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles), Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith), Sarah (Jaime King), and Irene (Betsy Rue), who survive an encounter with Harry and his pickaxe, as he vanishes into the mine, pursued by the police.

Flashing forward ten years, the Hanniger mines, are now closed, and Harry Warden is long presumed dead.  Tom Hanniger, the mine's new owner, has returned to town after a ten year absence, intending to sell the mine.  Axel and Sarah are now married.  He's the town sheriff, she runs a local market.

A masked killer, who favors a pickaxe, makes a sudden appearance.  His first victims are Frank the Trucker (Todd Farmer), his lover Irene, and a motel clerk (Selene Luna), who are all dispatched with brutal flair.  Ms. Rue is to be commended for her bravery in doing full nudity, and for a most remarkably well toned body.

The deaths shake up the town, and revive talk of Harry Walker's return, as a human heart is sent to Sheriff Palmer in a heart shaped candy box.  Grisly, bone crunching deaths follow, with the police making little progress in solving the case.  With Axel carrying on an affair with Megan (Megan Boone), a clerk in the market, and Sarah sill having feelings for Tom, their marriage is quite shaky.  When the killer strikes at the market, more blood is spilled, and Sarah barely escapes alive.  The level of suspense remains high, and the mystery about motives and the killer's identity, is preserved until near the very end.  The door is wide open to the possibility of a sequel, so we may not have seen the last from this group.

With the stage already partially established, taking a more adult and modern approach works well.  Besides the Hanniger mine, the bloody mayhem is spread to various other settings, and the film has some graphically outrageous kills.  One involves a pickaxe and an eyeball, and another involves a shovel to the jaw.

Director Patrick Lussier tries to feature 3D effects wherever possible, with impalements, various projectiles and flying parts, and objects that penetrate surfaces. Sets of 3D glasses are included with the DVD. How well the 3D effect works varies, but if it doesn't look right, or if you get eye strain from watching 3D, the double sided disc also includes a 2D version of the film. Lussier and co-writer Todd Farmer (who also appears in the film), provide an informative, low-key, and fun commentary. The remake of My Bloody Valentine provides the feeling of terror from facing a swinging pickaxe, in a more polished, contemporary package.",1269993600,3,3318,4.854351687388988

From Halloween 2, the absolute nadir of remakes to the equally hideous, ""Friday the l3th"", it's enough to make you suicidal--that is until I was totally amazed and thrilled with this scrumptious, inventive remake.

For one thing, it looks great and I wish and wish I could have seen it again in 3-D. For a second thing, you've got a cast of terrific young actors who give it their all.  Especally outstanding is Jensen Ackles, the tormented hero and his old girlfriend, Jaime King. They have great rapport and Kevin Tighe as her quick-tempered cop husband holds his own.

Equally outstanding are the way the murders are committed. None of them have ever been done before which adds to the WOW factor. From the very first one with a boy's eye socket being replaced by a pick-axe tip to the naked prostitute's demise, they all grab your attention.

3734808,4,B001OQCVH4,"I usually write very lengthy reviews but I just wanted to quickly pop in here and voice my enthusiasm for this film. I rarely view contemporary films of any genre (too much computer-oriented stuff and abrupt scene changes for an old guy like me) but this one somehow caught my eye in the ""pre-played"" isle at the video rental store. It was priced at four bucks so I took a chance -- I'm glad that I did.

The opening scenes of this movie are HILARIOUS... although I don't know that this was exactly the sentiment which director Patrick Lussier wished to generate in his audience. It was simply tongue-in-cheek over the top with all those cadavers (and partial corpses too!) positioned around at the hospital slaughter scene which the suspected mass/serial murderer Harry Warden, (who always dressed as a coal miner with the breathing apparatus and all so you can't see his face), was to have committed. And the sheriff's comments were really off the chain, very low key and straightforward based upon the monumental carnage. So I loved that part in particular.

In any case, the story is all about a typically economically-depressed coal-mining community where one of the miners once went nuts and started to massacre everybody in town, (plus those who foolishly went to party in the old mine.) And naturally, ten years later on Valentine's Day, the anniversary of the spectacular slaughter, butchery, and aggregate terror must be celebrated by doing it all over again! The hackneyed (but endearing) theme of ""All you irresponsible young folks who think that you're gonna get smashed and have a bunch of wild sex are gonna pay big time -- I'm gonna kill you all and rip your guts out and then roll in the blood..."" (and on and on.) This concept, (one which I have always merrily savored in film because I used to party like this every weekend and my pals and I should ALL have been whacked too), was absolutely adhered to throughout the film.

So the nostalgia aspect was a key positive point for me -- like most people, I've never cherished change. Like pretty much all the older and renowned slasher flicks, you can pretty much anticipate everything which is about to happen throughout this 2009 film. I especially relished that feature too, although I would NOT prefer to know such things while watching a movie of any other genre.

That's about all I have to say except to summarize that I was thoroughly entertained during the entire 103 minutes. It's all really grisly and gory and chiefly for that reason (plus a few sexual scenes and typical youth colorful language) it's been awarded an ""R"" rating.

One final important item for prospective purchasers: I'm reviewing the regular edition of this movie but there is now a SPECIAL EDITION available in which a number of edited scenes, (all supposedly way too gory and tasteless for the average person), have been reinserted into the film -- so if you prefer that one you should go here to order.

3734867,2,B001OQCVH4,"Not since Friday the 13th Part 3 have I remembered so vividly a 3D horror movie. Now, with the release of a My Bloody Valentine remake in 3D, Lionsgate raises the bar, at least in production value.

  When I first heard that My Bloody Valentine was being refilmed, I thought to myself, ""Huh?"" I had never seen the original, so it took a bit of research to find out what the movie was all about.

  Apparently in the original , directed by George Mihalka, a disgruntled miner named Harry Warden(played by Peter Cowper) goes on a killing spree, killing fellow miners by cutting out their hearts. Cutting to present day, a group of teenagers get the bright idea to hold a Valentine's Day party in the mine where the murders took place. It proves to be a fantastic idea, as the party-goers are dispatched one by one. Is Harry Warden back from the dead with his trusty miner's helmet? Possibly. The movie was reminiscient of those good old 80s slasher movies that we all loved. It was filmed in Canada(how about those Canucks?), and had 19 minutes of edited footage that was cut due to excessive gore, which was only included recently in a re-release by Lionsgate.

  Now, Harry Warden is back. AGAIN. Lionsgate revisited the sleepy mining town of terror by recreating the movie, but this time in 3D. And that is where the story goes bad.

  The original storyline is well intact. We have the flashback of Harry Warden(now played by Rich Walters)  going crazy in a hospital a year after the original mining incident, which we never see but are told was a ""mining accident"". We also don't know why he started killing everybody. We can only guess it has to do with some workers union disagreement. What we do know is that he returns to the mines after leaving the hospital, and happens on a group of teenagers who got the bright idea to hold a Valentine's Day party in the mine where the accident took place. After dispatching many of the teenagers, Harry Warden attacks Tom Hanniger(played by Jensen Ackles), but is held off by the police, who apparently shoot and kill Warden, and Tom is left a gibbering idiot.

  Ten years later, Tom Hanniger returns to take over the mining company after the death of his father(this fact was left out until now) after being in a mental institution. When he arrives, murders begin. Is Harry Warden back from the dead? Probably. Slasher stars never stay down for long(see Jason Voorhees, Freddy Kreuger, Michael Myers, etc.). The town thinks Tom is responsible. Tom isn't so sure(obviously.) The hunt ensues to uncover the truth, before the whole town ends up dead, or the mine is sold to Germans.

  The Good: My Bloody Valentine is brutal in the gore factor. It's in 3D, and not like Friday the 13th Part 3. The theater gave us these big Buddy Holly glasses, and I'm glad I kept mine on. When a woman gets half her head severed with a shovel, and the 3D has the head slide forward at you, that's good use of 3D. When a miner throws a pick-axe from fifty yards away straight at the audience, and it sticks into a car's windshield, that's good use of 3D. This movie played the 3D card for every grisly scene, as well as they should. There wasn't much else holding this movie together. Besides the drunken old men playing caricatures of old mining men.

  The Bad: Everything else. The storyline was annoyingly vague, which doesn't work too well with a basic slasher movie. It's as if the movie is meant to be watched after seeing the original to get the storyline straight. I hadn't seen the original at the time, so I was stuck. The twist ending made me, and half the theater, throw up their arms in anguish, since it wasn't suspenseful so much as, ""So wait, why did this all happen?"" Granted, it's a slasher movie, but usually a storyline of ""killer on the loose"" doesn't have so many scenes that you look back on and scratch your head about.",1260230400,,3874,4.543884892086331

From the very beginning, the story, action, and the visuals hooked me into it with lots of twists, turns, and shocks. Digital 3-D movies over the past few years have only offered family films or animation in 3-D.

Finally, Live-Action Digital 3-D that WORKS!! A MUST see movie if you like blood, gore, and full nudity; all in 3-D! A few story problems in the third act but everything else makes up for it. The movie is meant to be fun anyway, and it was!

3734874,5,B001OQCVH4,"Although I'm not usually one to jump on the bandwagon when a Hollywood remake of a horror film is made, my curiosity was sparked...well more like electrocuted, when I saw the trailer for this on the DVD for ""Haunting in Connecticut"". So what do I do? The only sensible thing! I buy it for myself to give it a good view. So what do I think of ""My Bloody Valentine""?

Well, the short version of my opinion would be that it's a great horror movie that really gives you the feel of the '80s classics, but also suffers from being too Hollywood. However, I wouldn't be doing my job as the horror aficionado I am without giving you all the whole enchilada. The positives about ""My Bloody Valentine"" are the positives of many classic slasher films: We have a sinister and seemingly indestructible villain who goes on a murderous rampage, lots of blood and gore throughout the movie, amazing special effects, a scene of ABSOLUTELY GRATUITIOUS nudity, a cool small-town setting and overall rather good acting.

So indeed, ""My Bloody Valentine"" is an old-school, nuts-out slasher film extravaganza. The only thing I didn't really like about the film is that it became too ""Hollywood"" towards the end. The last scene kind of turned from old-school slasher horror to a more drama-thriller sort of affair. The ending is also debatable; watch it and you'll probably be like me, hoping that they better do a sequel the way it ended!

Overall, this is for the most part a very good movie that could've had a less mainstream vibe to make it flawless, but the fact that there's a solid amount of special features, and that it comes in either 2-D or 3-D with four pairs of 3-D glasses makes me give it a five-star rating. Although it's a Valentine's Day related horror film, be sure to get this in time for Halloween! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1256342400,,1829,4.604294478527607

Armed with a pick-axe, our killer finds many clever and efficient ways of dispatching his victims which include quite possibly the first little-person ever to be splattered in a horror movie.

Few remakes nowadays are done with the kind of love and respect that 1981's Canadian cult classic ""My Bloody Valentine"" has received. As a 3-D upgrade, it's almost like a valentine itself to horror fans, being throwback to the 80's glory days of the slasher genre that it is.  With all the over-the-top violence you'd expect from a 3-D horror flick, the film also gets by with a touch of style from director Patrick Lussier (""Dracula 2000"") as well as a script from Todd Farmer (""Jason X"") and Zane Smith that successfully updates but doesn't manipulate its source material.

The only weakness to be found is in the 3-D aspect, which is limited, to be honest. While a better effort is made here to ensure that it's not just a useless gimmick like in ""Friday the 13th 3D"" or the final sequence in ""Freddy's Dead,"" the novelty wears off after a while, and when it's not giving you the funhouse horror thrills you crave, it'll just make your eyes hurt and distract from the pure slasher delight at hand. In all honesty, the film works just as well without the 3-D (thankfully, the DVD/Blu-Ray releases include a 2-D version as well). ""My Bloody Valentine"" is simply an efficient and crowd-pleasing remake that will no doubt thrill the young audience it was designed for, but the older one as well, who remembers and cherishes the original and other films like it.",1255478400,,1719,4.723333333333334

3734881,3,B001OQCVH4,"This is a review of the film ""My Bloody Valentine"" (2009) per se, seen in 2-D. As to the effects of 3-D images, please read other reviews. I know I should watch this film in 3-D and it is not that I don't like 3-D movies either. I just prefer the old-fashioned way.

""My Bloody Valentine,"" a remake of Canadian cult horror flick made in 1981, is a throwback to good old days of slasher horror movies, like the recent Hollywood remake of ""Halloween."" (You will notice the new ""Valentine"" film's homage to ""Jason"" and ""Michael""). In fact, the new ""Valentine"" comes with lots of blood and gores, violent deaths by a deranged killer with a pickaxe.

""My Bloody Valentine"" starts off promisingly, with a killing spree by one Harry Warden (Richard John Walters) in the small mining town of Harmony. Ten years after the massacre, Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles, ""Supernatiral"") comes back to the town and bloody murders start happening. Jaime King and Kerr Smith also appear as Tom's old friends.

The fast-paced opening doesn't waste time to show us what we want to see - deaths, some of them are very nasty - but somewhere in the mid-section it disintegrates into an implausible mess. ""My Bloody Valentine"" tries to be a mystery, but the answer is obvious for those who are familiar with the genre. The cinematography is spot on, evoking the atmosphere of a small town, but director Patrick Lussier (""The Prophecy 3: The Ascent"" ""Dracula 2000"") relies too much on quick edits and old visual tricks like sudden appearance of a thing. The set-pieces are decent enough, but certainly not as scary as it should be.

""My Bloody Valentine"" is an average slasher film with the elements of the genre that you can find somewhere else.",1252540800,,1717,4.713333333333333

I got about 30 minutes into this movie and just could not stand trying to watch it in 3D. I flipped the disc over and watched it in 2D without the annoying and horribly produced 3D giving me a splitting headache.

The story is of a guy who owns a mine had a bad experience a decade ago and has come back to sell the mines, when a killer who was thought to be dead goes on a killing spree... not exactly an original story, but I can give the movie at least 3 stars and say it is watchable, and worthy of at least a rental.

However, the effort put into the 3D side of it is nothing but horrible & disgusting and it's not my TV or DVD players fault. I never saw this in the theatres, so I don't know how it looked then, but this DVD version is nothing but a poorly made pile of $#!+

How is it movies nearly 30 years old like Friday the 13th 3D can look great in 3D on DVD, yet the latest technology of today can't produce something as good as a movie made way back when? I'm not even talking about how horrid the lack of color is, it's the blurry picture quality that killed it. One second it looks very clear, the next everything is blurry, or the background is clear, and the foreground out of focus, or someone looks like they have a blurry face where you can see an aura like image of them. I got sick of having to close one eye to try and focus on what the hell was going on in the film, it was just that distracting I had to turn the 3D side over to the 2D side so i wasn't distracted from the film.

I could see a lot of shots that intended to be great 3D effects, with things in your face and blood spitting at you, but due to the horrible quality and blurry, crappy efforts put into the 3D aspect of it, they fail to do anything but look 3dish, but not the kind of 3D that pops out of the screen at you, it just is a waste of anybody's time to try and watch in 3D, and my eyes are still screwed up trying to focus right now.

Harry Warden kills a few guy's after a mine collapse in order to save on oxygen, he get's out of the hospital (after a literal blood-fest) and goes to the said mine to kill some teens giving a party in there (yes not logical but who cares really). A group of 4 teens survive after the cavalry arrives. Now skip 10 years not only are the killings happening again but it must be one of the two leads. And believe me you hop from believing it's one only to believe it's the other one.

3734940,5,B001OQCVH4,"10 years ago there has been a series of horrific murders in the town of Harmony on Valentine's Day, a mine worker named Harry Warden (Richard John Walters) was left for dead in a accident until he came back as a mass-maniac that was killed by the cops especially the former sheriff Burke(Tom Atkins). Now the holiday has returned back to the town as everyone tries to forget that terrible night and get on with their lives, Tom (Jenson Ackles) has returned 10 years later back to the town for a visit as it seems to be now peaceful. Now suddenly there has been some ghastly clues like human hearts in candy boxes and bodies showing up everywhere including at the local mines, but could Harry Warden came back from the grave or is it somebody filling in his shoes including costume?

Co-starring Jaime King, sexy Betsy Rue, Kerr Smith, and Todd Farmer this reinvention of the 1981 Canadian slasher classic is brought to new life in this exciting and fun remake. I think this one is one of the better horror remakes of later as it uses a unique 3D presentation that makes the viewer feel like their in the movie and it's faithful to the original slasher classic of the 80's, it even gives the viewer the retro feeling of those stylish 80's and 70's slasher movies including the 90's classic ""Scream"" with a bit of self-referentialness and dark humor. The violence in this version is almost as brutal as the original and of course great acting even from the always brilliant Tom Atkins as it manages to to become a unique experience in 3D even though the new ending unlike in the original becomes somewhat of a cop-out but still i can't wait for the sequel.

Review of 3D Version:

 The 3D is anaglyph; one green lens and one red lens in the glasses. This is not ""state of the art"" but I must say that it is probably the best representation of an anaglyph film I've ever seen. The 3D elements pop off the screen pretty well. I'd say it is about %30 better than the Friday 3D, for those who have seen it in Blu-Ray. The trick is, you have to acclimate your eyes first. I'd watch the end credits first to prep, then, with the beginning credits, as you watch the film it will be a better experience. I found that watching it the second time around the ""3D vision"" was a little more sound in my brains execution of the illusion. Another tip, I found moving my head from side to side created ""color abstraction"" due to the different lenses, so I'd find a space where the whole screen is viewable from a single point and rotate my eyes to follow the action instead of my head.

Again, the viewings following your first will be better. But, this is a sound 3D effort. I don't see how they could have done a better job with the anaglyph 3D process. The movie is also good looking in 2D, for the record. The biggest tip I can give is to give it multiple viewings, because the 3D only gets better when you are used to it. You kind of have to ""train"" your eyes.

Movie: 3 1/2 out of 5 stars.
3D: 4/5 stars for anaglyph.
Overall: 4/5 stars for horror/slasher fans.",1247097600,3,1462,4.222222222222222

After the disappointment I went down and watched it on my laptop with a wide screen monitor approximately same dimensions sitting close to it.

3734973,5,B001OQCVH4,"Yes, I am a fan of the original ""My Bloody Valentine"", so when I heard about this remake I dusted off a place on my DVD shelf next to ""Prom Night"" and ""Halloween"".

Well I'm happy to say that ""Valentine"" joins the ranks of horror remakes that are better than the original.

Whereas the original film was a straight up slasher (which was excellent), the remake adds a great twist. From the opening credits we get a really cool backstory for the killer, and it sets the tone for the rest of the film. Because I'm not into spoilers, I'm not going to divulge any info regarding the plot....besides this is a slasher horror film....how much plot do you really need?

Here are the things you need to know:
1. Blood - Gallons are spilled in this flick. Seriously, don't go in expecting one of those watered-down PG-13 remakes. This sucker pumps out the blood and gore, and does so in great fashion.

2. Faceless Killer - Yep, just like in the original, the gas-masked miner goes after folks relentlessly. And in the best tradition of Michael Myers and Jason Voorheese, doesn't speak a work, always walks when his prey is running, and makes for a pretty frightening figure down in the mines.

3. Plenty of Victims - Oh yea. This puppy is LOADED with potential victims. And one nice twist with ""Valentine"", they aren't teenage kids. This is actually an adult horror movie.

4. Did I mention blood? - There is tons of it!!

Of course if you like the whole 3D thing, this film has that as well. I'm not really into wearing paper glasses for 2 hours straight...then suffering from a headache for the remainder of the evening, so I just popped in the 2D version. The 2D was awesome, and got me curious as to what the 3D version would look like, so I'll give a try sometime when I have Advil close at hand.",1246492800,2,2083,4.7245179063360885
3735014,4,B001OQCVH4,"To be honest, the movie was terrible.  However, if you thought a remake of My Bloody Valentine was going to be an Oscar winner, there is something wrong with you anyway.  I bought the movie for the fact it was in 3-D, which I knew was going to suck compared to theaters and it did.  Though, I was pleasantly suprised that it wasn't worse than it was.  My girlfriend and I had to sit about 3 ft from our 52 inch HD television and the color was less than optiimal, but it was in 3-D and she did jump sky high a few times when things flew at her.  It was mostly inward 3-D, and by that I mean it was like one of those Magic 3-D books, but on occasion the killers weapon would fly out of the screen or a bullet would pop out at you.  It was a good time in comparision to most horror movies in 2-D that I know are going to suck, but I (for some reason) buy them anyway.  I'm sure over the next few years 3-D will get even better, especially with the boom of 3-D movies lately, but I wouldn't be afraid to try this one out.  At least not if you have a big TV and it is HD capable.  I can't speak for the standard version.

It was more than just a hack-n-slash film as it tries valiantly to build characters and a storyline, albeit absurd, with a straight face.

3735017,3,B001OQCVH4,"My Bloody Valentine (Patrick Lussier, 2009)

I watched this year (so far)'s other big horror flick, the 3D renake of My Bloody Valentine, back-to-back with the new Friday the 13th flick last night, and I have to say I wasn't expecting much. And it's entirely possible that my judgment was clouded by the desecration of film stock that was Friday the 13th. But Lussier, whose directorial career to date has been riddled with bad, bad entries (Dracula 2000, White Noise 2) actually made a relatively decent movie this time. Much closer to the spirit of the original film than I expected and not entirely stupid.

The story: eleven years before the film opens, a miner named Harry Warden (Neverland's Richard John Walters), trapped in a cave-in with a number of his co-workers, is found to be the only one alive when they're dug out. It came out that he'd murdered the others in order to preserve oxygen, and Warden went from hero to villain while still in a coma. A year later, Warden went on a murderous rampage, killing twenty people (we find out later) before being hunted down by the local sheriff (The Fog's Tom Atkins) and forced into a blind tunnel, which they collapse onto him. No one, however, saw the body. Fast-forward a decade, and Tom Hanniger (Supernatural's Jensen Ackles), the son of the recently-deceased owner of the mine, has come back to town in order to sell it off. Hanniger, see, was the guy Warden was about to kill when the sheriff found him (he was also the guy who caused the original cave-in, though without malice aforethought). Yeah, I'd want to get out of town, too. He only plans on being in town long enough to get the papers signed, but complications ensue; his old rival Axel (Dawson's Creek's Kerr Smith) has married his ex-girlfriend Sarah (The Spirit's Jaime King) and is the new sheriff. Bad blood runs deep. And worse, it seems that since no one ever actually saw Harry Warden's body, legend has it that he's still alive. So when the bodies start piling up, everyone knows who to blame, right? Everyone except Axel, who thinks it's an awfully big coincidence that Harry showed up just when Tom got back in town.

It's not a perfect film, nor even close. I understand the urge to include scenes from the earlier version in a remake in order to cater to fans of the original film, but presenting them in an entirely different context can be anything from disconcerting (the discovery of the first heart-shaped box) to just plain annoying (the dryer scene, which is ""included"" only in that it contains, yes, a dryer). But it's not a terrible film, either. The average talent in here is relatively high for a movie like this (and Tom Atkins on a movie screen is always a welcome sight), and while the script is silly, as one expects from a slasher movie, it's not quite as overwrought as one might expect (after all, the original was). Most interestingly, it's one of the few 3D films I've seen where the filmmakers actually seem to realize that ""3D"" is not some sort of code for ""things always flying at the audience."" They realize there are six different directions that work in 3D, and they utilize them. Impressive.

It's a time-waster at best, but it's a pretty good time waster. ***",1245974400,2,3223,4.649122807017544
3735018,3,B001OQCVH4,"This remake hits the basic boxes for a horror film. The killings are graphic and quite inventive in some places, and the killer's approach does bring dread in the good way, so these count as a plus.

The drawbacks are that it's all a bit contrived and there are few surprises. This film has its moments and is worth seeing, although the 3D only works properly in the cinema, where it does work well.

I have a thing for 3D movies, and got this one almost entirely to enjoy the view, so to speak.  And for about 40 minutes I was utterly disappointed, as the disk didn't appear to have any 3D effects.  At that point, I realized I was watching the wrong side of the disk (they're not very clearly marked).  So I flipped it over....was it an improvement?  Well, there were some neat effects and some scenery that looked great in 3D, but also a lot of double images and blurring (especially with anything that was supposed to ""stick out of the screen"").  Maybe it looked better on the big screen, but I found that my eyes kept wanting to cross.

Certainly worth watching if you're a fan of the genre--this one has the standard formula down to a science.  If you're looking for great art or history-making cinema....well, you wouldn't be renting a 3D movie or a slasher film, would you?",1245715200,,1065,4.471502590673575

My Bloody Valentine is a brutal gory horror show with a 3D touch, the kills on this film is as hardcore as they come and with the 3D glasses you would be cover your face to stop a blood, an eyeball or someone jaw from flying at you're face!

3735021,4,B001OQCVH4,"Since the Scream trilogy, Hollywood have rehashed classic horror films from the 70s and 80s. Why? 1.)These films are very good 2.) No one has come up with a new fresh idea for the horror genre since Scream, and 3.)They are profitable. Usually these remakes fall in one of three sections:

1.) Excellent (example: Dawn of the Dead)
2.) So-so (example: The Fog)
3.) Terrible (examples: Texas Massacre, Friday 13th and Halloween)

This remake belongs between 1 and 2 because while is very good, its not better than the original Valentine. Once again, Hollywood decided to take this independent horror film and gloss it to the max. As a result, the film looses some of its intimacy and its realness. I do love how the director took the characters from the original film and mixed the storyline in an unpredictable manner.

In my opinion, nothing detracts from the movie experience quite like wearing uncomfortable cardboard glasses on your face to watch a movie that ultimately looks kind of blurry. But now that that is out of the way, let's get to the movie. My Bloody Valentine was an overlooked slasher flick from the 80's that was pretty good, and to remake this underappreciated gem is a nice idea. It didn't fully pan out though. They had the right game plan; just give the audience what they expect from this kind of movie, loads of kills and gore sprinkled with sex. And even though they achieved that, the movie was still ultimately very dull. The kills did not really look that great because they were mostly made up of poorly constructed CGI shots, and I still firmly believe that practical FX will always work better in these kinds of movies. And the story is just too loose; it strays from what made the original work. So this remake is shelved with so many others, inferior to the original.

3735075,5,B001OQCVH4,"""My Bloody Valentine"" is an excellent remake.  Its plot is similar to that of the original classic released in 1981, but is different enough to be enjoyed by fans of the original.  The strong mystery element is still there, coupled with more violence and gore, enough to please modern fans of movies such as ""Saw"" and ""Hostel.""

  The film's beginning explodes like dynamite.  On Valentine's Day, Harry Warden and a group of other miners are trapped underground.  When they are found, all are dead save for the comatose Warden who, it is later learned, murdered the others in order to conserve oxygen.  Exactly one year later, Warden awakes from his coma and slaughters hospital staff along with a group of teens partying at the mine.  This time he is killed in a cave in, or is he?  Ten years later, the survivors of the massacre are being killed by a man wearing a miner's mask and carrying a pick ax.  Has Harry Warden returned from the dead or is someone else carrying his pick ax, resuming his bloody quest for vengeance?

  The acting from the leads was excellent.  Jensen Ackles (""Devour"") and Kerr Smith (""Final Destination"") are great as Tom Hanniger and Axel Palmer, respectively.  They are enemies who are both in love with the same woman, Sarah Palmer (Jaime King of ""They Wait"")  The two men race to unmask the insane killer while the bodies pile up.  Unfortunately, the killer is always one step ahead of them.  The ending of the remake is very similar to that of the original.  I was always upset that the original didn't have a sequel; maybe this one will.

  ""My Bloody Valentine"" is highly recommended for collectors of great slasher fare.  Lions Gate has exceeded my expectations in its release.  The four pairs of 3-D glasses were inside a plastic bag and did not scratch my discs as others had complained.  I watched the film on my computer, with all the lights turned completely off.  The 3-D special effects were excellent, almost as good as if I was watching the film on the big screen.  The 3-D definitely increased the level of the plot's horror and gruesomeness.  One of the characters has an axe thrust upward into his throat and his jaws torn off.  I cringed in disgust and nearly screamed as they came flying towards me.  Gross!!!

  Was buying the two discs with the extra features worth it?  Yes, the deleted scenes answered questions I had while watching the edited version of ""My Bloody Valentine.""  For example, Tom Hanniger tells the deputy that he saw him at the mine but I didn't remember seeing him.  The deputy visits the mine in one of the deleted scenes.  Also, there are deleted scenes involving the beginning of the film, prior to the slaughtering of the teens in the mine.  The ""making of"" featurettes were interesting.  They usually are for horror movies and action adventures.  If you are a big fan of slasher fare, I recommend shelling out a few extra dollars for the extra disc.

His claim to fame happens to be ""doing a unit in the bushes"" at a family wedding. This is exactly what Sid should have done before going to see this one on the big screen, instead of waiting for its DVD release. But, that was Sid's only regret because this movie scratched us right where we itched. It was a harkening back to the original film, meaning it was a straight old-school slasher flick. So, you know what you are getting: Tons of gore and gratutitous nudity. Throw in the 3-D and we are in.

The film starts off with a mine caving in with 5 miners trapped. Six weeks later, all miners except one are dead. The surviving miner has killed the others to save oxygen for himself. Tom is blamed however for not venting the methane lines. The next year, the miner strikes again, killing a teenager at a party. Ten years later, Tom inherits the mine from his father. Soon after, more are killed, including the scene where Tom is trapped in a cage in the mine and is forced to watch the murder of a miner. Tom's old flame is married to the sherrif, Jack from Dawson's Creek. Tom tries to convince her that Axel(the sherrif) is the killer and Axel tries to convince her that Tom is. Finally, we get a resolution when we see that Tom is a loon. So he's the killer.

We must say that the ending was a little disappointing. The killings were done by a lone psychopath and it was all pretty implausable. However, the film was very enjoyable overall even without the superior 3-D experiance in the theater. This IS a flick we would have enjoyed in our heyday. Ok, quick Drive-In Totals:

1 Dawson's Creek alum

In fact, the first act is absolutely brilliant:  fast paced, fun, and bloody.  I was feeling all kinds of 80's nostalgic as I watched with an ever growing grin across my face.  Unfortunately, 2nd act character development was rife with unimaginative dialogue which slowed the pacing significantly.  Things picked up again as the third act approached, and I was feeling 4 star love coming on.  Then it happened:  one of those moments where after going along, forgiving the little bumps and potholes of lazy writing and enjoying the thrill ride, one of the main players says something so moronic, that any mystery or suspense built up to that point gets sucked right out of the room.  Instead of focusing on the action, I couldn't get past the fact that the writers allowed something so lazy and lame to play a major role in the storytelling.  I can't elucidate without spoiling the film.  It's just unfortunate that my suspension bridge of disbelief was demolished at that point.

Even in 2D format, My Bloody Valentine is mildly recommended, especially for fans of 80's horror.  Although diminishing returns set in after a stellar first act, there are some bloody good kills, skilled direction throughout, and enough thrills to keep the viewer interested.  If not for some unimaginative dialogue and character issues, I would have awarded MBV 4 stars, but have to take away one star for my issues with the lazy writing.",1243555200,,1562,4.805243445692884

3735146,3,B001OQCVH4,"Full disclosure: Since I did not see the 1981 original, the only reason why I was even remotely interested in the remake was Jensen Ackles. I am firmly biased in favor of him, and thought that he did the best he could with what he was given; for my money he was indeed the best thing about this movie. That said...

Watching this in 2-D is just a bad idea; it was blatantly obvious that the stunts were shot for the full-on 3-D effect, and the standard version suffered for it. Jumping if a pickax comes flying out of the screen at you is one thing, but without that extra element the gore was just gore. There were, perhaps, one or two moments that made me startle, but for a horror movie? I expected more than that. My only other nitpick was that some of the effects were abysmally fake; I don't want to notice that kind of thing and snicker, not when that wasn't the intent, as I'm betting it wasn't meant to be.

As for the story, the underpinnings were interesting enough that it could have been compelling. I don't want to spoil any of the twists, but suffice to say, if the final revelations had been more fully realized the story would have had greater depth. And since I don't believe that horror and depth are mutually exclusive, I'll leave it at that. Ackles aside, the acting was...sufficient.

For what it's worth, I did kind of enjoy My Bloody Valentine. If I had watched it in 3-D as it was meant to be seen, I might have even enjoyed it more. Honestly, I'm not a hardcore horror fan, more like a casual watcher, and like I said the sole draw for me was Ackles, so please do to take everything I've said with a grain of salt.

The glasses are the red/blue kind.  They are not like the glases you find in theatres and amusement parks today.  The problem with this is that the colors are washed away in 3D and you are left with a strange orange and purple mix.  For example, skintones become orange.  Everything else is purple or grey.

Its a good thing that the 2D version is included on the same disc as a menu selection.  After five minutes of watching it in 3D, we chose to restart the movie in 2D.

I'm really not going to waste any time tackling the movie itself. Overall, this actually ranks up there with one of the better modern horror re-makes I`ve seen. I didn't care too much for the ending, but I'm willing to let it slide because, frankly, I've seen so many crappy horror flicks lately, that anything that doesn't leave me wanting to throw the dvd in the garbage gets a passing grade.

Since Amazon reviews are suppose to be based on the product as a whole, not just the movie itself, I'm going to tackle my complaints with this release, many of which have nothing to do with the movie itself:

Packaging: As several people have mentioned, this dvd was carelessly put together. In an effort to cut manufacturing costs, Linesgate opted for a doubled sided dvd instead of a 2 dvd set. This wouldn't have been a big deal had it not been for the 4 pairs of fancy 3D glasses included with the movie. While I had no issues with my copy, I've read dozens of posts from people that have stated the top side of their DVD had been scratched to the point of either being unplayable or needing repair before watching because the glasses were loose in the case. What I'd suggest to people yet to purchase the dvd is to shake the case before buying. If you hear something moving around in there, there's a good chance the dvd's damaged.

Special Features: In order to bilk fans out of their hard earned money, Lionsgate released two versions of this film on dvd. Version one, which is the version I bought, features the 2D and 3D versions and a whopping zero special features (I'm sorry, but I just don't count commentary tracks as ""special features"") Version 2, which sold for $10 more, contained all the special features you'd expect to find on a standard, big budget  dvd release. The argument could be made that Lionsgate gave fans the option of purchasing this film at a reduced price sans features, but I'm still calling bull. Their ""special two disc deluxe edition"" contains nothing more than your typical one disc, regular priced dvd.

3D: Like many, I wasn't lucky enough to catch the 3D version in theaters. The city I live in got the 2D version. Going in to this, I knew the dvd 3D wasn't going to be as impressive in the comfort of my own home as it was in theaters, but I didn't realize how bad it would be. Where the 3D was successful was in adding dimension to the screen. The at-home 3D was also good at... wait... no...that's pretty much it. Nearly all the gags that involved things flying towards the screen failed. The 3D version was colorless and more times than not, blurry. I found it necessary to take my glasses off for a few seconds every 20 minutes or so to relieve the eye strain or, in some cases, figure out what the heck I was looking at. As an added NON-bonus, the 3D glasses don't fit over regular glasses very well. I thought this may have taken away from my 3D viewing enjoyment, but my wife, who has 20/20 vision echoed all of my complaints.

The following day I watched the 2D version of the film and found it much more enjoyable. There are only a handful of gags that seem really ridiculous in 2D (like the scene during the bar fight where a guy punches a mirror). I'll probably never watch the 3D version again, but I do see myself pulling out the 2D version from time to time.",1243209600,13,3371,4.440129449838188

The 3-D technology on the DVD sucks.  Everything is miscolored... the glasses are green and a pinkish-red color.  Parts of it are blurry.  Lionsgate should have either released in on DVD in only 2-D or found a way to mimic the theater experience.  I am disappointed with the 3-D.

I ran out of fingers and toes trying to count how many times this happens--damsels in distress-the BOO! scene where nothing happens.  Then there's the nice guy everyone blames for the killings and the slightly crazed, adulterous sheriff who is always lurking where he shouldn't be lurking. Which of these two are up to no good?  A tired old cliche and any true fan or horror or mystery will guess correctly.  The so-called ""surprise"" still cant save this pile of dung.  One missed opportunity comes during a nude romp in a motel. A shame the actress's ""attributes"" wern't part of a 3-D effect.

What makes the experience even worse is watching the damn thing with the 3-D glasses. Keep the aspirin handy unless you enjoy headaches, the picture looks colorless and dark-and the 3-D effects are very few-a flying pick-axe, a shotgun pointed at the audience, a chunk of someones' face(that's a new one)and a bullet fired from a gun that seems to hit the viewer between the eyes.

Another time I will try the flip-side which has the movie in 2-D-i want to see the movie in color and lighter but I'm sure nothing can save this stinking wedge of limberger cheese.",1243036800,,1515,4.837209302325581
3735190,1,B001OQCVH4,"This movie was such a let down being all the high praise it received(from fans only though). I'm not a fan of hack and slash horror, more of a psychological horror buff myself. Occasionally though my interested gears towards a movie like this just because it may have some scare factor to it. This was beyond cheesy we're talking even more so than the original Friday the 13th, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre. There is nothing original here except that there was an incident in a coal mines where people were killed by a crazed x miner with a pick axe, and now the boy that comes back after so many years is accused of killing all these people. Thats it, thats all, yay how unique. The 3d part however may be interesting though i'm not that interested in things jumping out at me from my television, i like to keep it simple. I also think they tried to see how long they could show a naked woman in an unrated film before it became offensive to many people, which it may have. I found it humorous that the woman just stays naked, gets under a bed, waits for the guy to come in and look for her, then tries to use the old bed frame to protect herself from a PICK AXE LOL. COME ON!! Anyway this movie is just cheese nothing more nothing less. No frills here, just run of the mill chase you down and chop you up like a wall of coal. Blah.",1243036800,5,1331,4.203125

Other problems I had with this movie is the killer who did a poor job in making me think that he could pull it off,and other then the gore it was a bore and void of any'good'humour. I like a remake when they can add something new to the movie,but this remake adds nothing new besides the special effects and some of the storyline. The orginal had a certain charm and mood to it that this remake can't touch. If you feel the need to see this,I would suggest that you FF between the death scenes.

3735214,4,B001OQCVH4,"As a horror fan, I can say that I have not been thrilled with a lot of people re-making some of the classic slashers. Some I have liked, but some should of never been touched. To many, the original 1981 My Bloody Valentine is a cult classic that shouldn't of been tampered with. I'm glad it was. I love the original film, and I think it is definitley the best of the slashers to come out of the Halloween/Friday The 13th/early 80's slasher boom. It wasn't a hit here in the states, and became an underground cult film, one lovingly embraced by the fans, but probably not well known by a good margin of mainstream audiences. I didn't see the original having needed much improving, but the re-make was great to freshen up a great idea, re-introduce the story and premise to more people, as well as a new generation, and maybe bring the original film more acknowledgement and recognition. And in 3-D!. So, let's get on with it....

The movie takes place in the little mining town of Harmony, Pennsylvania. There was a horrible accident in the mines many years ago that left one man, Harry Warden, bonkers. He did the unthinkable to stay alive and he went crazy. A year later, Harry goes insane and commits horrible murders, 22 in all. And now, years later, the quiet, peaceful community finds themselves being stalked by a madman in a miner's mask and carrying a mighty pickax. Is this Harry Warden, back to continue his brutal massacre?. Is it someone else?. Throw in a love triangle between the returning Tom Hanniger(Supernatural's Jensen Ackles), Sheriff Axel Palmer(Dawson Creek's Kerr Smith), and Sarah(Jamie King), and you have one bloody valentine filled with red herrings, suspense, and a mystery of who is really behind that mask.

My Bloody Valentine 3D is a film that definitley pleased this horror film fan. Director Patrick Lussier and screenwriter Todd Farmer have created a classic horror/slasher film that any horror fan who grew up on and loves old school 80's horror should appreciate. The duo have re-created a film that seems so much like it belonged in a time gone by, and that's part of the beauty and overall nostalgic fun the movie delivers. The 3-D element will bring to mind 1983's ""Friday The 13th 3-3D"" and other films of the time, and that part of it will add to the overall fun, retro feel of the movie. The story and premise may not be treading new ground, but the movie is so fun and unabashedly celebrates what it is. The look, tone and feel of the film is great too. Filming at real locations, and a real mine, certainly adds to the wonderful look of the film and brings a reality to it all. No sets or soundstages here. There is also a real dread feeling here that I remember from my favorite 80's slashers. It may not be over the top scary, but the film does manage some great set pieces that are truly effective and creepy. The movie also basks in what lovers come to expect of these types of things. Blood and nudity. There is lots of blood here, lots of violence and, if you haven't heard by now, one soon to be classic nude/horror scene that is almost unbelieveable. Actress Betsy Rue is one brave actress, and screenwriter Todd Farmer is one smart man to write a cameo for himself in that scene!.

The cast has some familiar faces, and some you may not know. Our three main leads, Ackles, Smith, and King, all handle their roles well. There is no real breakout performance here, nothing that many other actors couldn't of done, but they handle themselves accordingly. Elsewhere, another big cause for celebration(and another reason this feels like a classic 80's film)is the appearance of Tom Atkins. Atkins is an icon to many, and appeared in many 80's films like ""The Fog"", ""Halloween III"", ""Night Of The Creeps"", ""Escape From New York"", ""Creepshow"", and the first ""Lethal Weapon"". Atkins is cool, and his presence is most welcomed, delighting horror fans from all over. Kevin Tighe, who people may remember from TV's ""Emergency"", and films like ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", also appears. It's a fun and competent cast.

The big gimmick of the movie was the 3-D. Unfortunatley, I was not one of the lucky ones to have seen the movie in the theater, which is where you really should of seen the 3-D version. On DVD, it does not quite work as well, although there are moments where you really see the 3-D work, but those moments are few and far between. This is the case with all DVD's I have seen that have 3-D. It must be seen in the theater to get the fullest use out of it. Luckily, this disc comes with a regular 2-D version. The 3-D may be the big, cool gimmick of the film, but the great thing about the movie is that it works just as well without it, and stands on it's own just fine.

MBV-3D is a fun and entertaining romp, especially for those that grew up on movies like this, particulary in the 80's. The script, while not entirely breaking the mold, is well written, and has a more adult feel than the typical teenage shenanigans you'd find in a movie such as this. The miner himself is an iconic image to me, and he never got the attention many thought he deserved. Maybe now he will....with his pickax. Speaking of which, some have complained about the pickax and the murders in the movie, but I have no complaint. Just like Freddy's glove or Jason's machete or Michael's butcher knife, the pickax is the iconic weapon of choice, and it's used in some incredible, and messy ways. No problem in that department. I also liked the mystery of it all. Is it really Harry Warden?. Is it one of the guys?. We always know it's Michael or Jason, but the 'who is it?' aspect of this film, and others like it, are a lot of fun. I think it brings the viewer more into the picture as they try to pick up on clues and find out who is doing it and exactly why. The DVD special features are quite underwhelming. That's the only negative I have to say about the whole package. It gets a 2 disc treatment for extra material, but the material itself is so short, it could of been all on one disc. The features are all under 10 minutes as well. The deleted/extended scenes are interesting, as is the alternate ending, but the behind the scenes stuff left a lot to be desired.

In the end, there is a lot of fun to be had with this movie. I grew up on the 80's slasher craze, and this movie really satisifed me in that regard. It may not be everyone's taste, but director Patrick Lussier has directed one of the best slasher films I have seen in years.",1242864000,,6487,4.483925549915398

3735219,3,B001OQCVH4,"Horror remakes are usually frowned upon and rightfully so, they are usually pretty bad. There are a few gems out their that actually improve upon the original but that is far and few between. This is certainly not one of those films. However this remake did not fall in line with most horror remakes as being complete rubbish. Allot of people are thinking remakes are this new thing when actually Hollywood has been doing it for years and years. What has been fairly new and hip, is the remake of some 80's classic slasher films.

 This remake is of the classic 1981 original that still stands the test of time as being a damn fine slasher film and easily being one of the better slashers done in that day. The reason the original was so good was the realism in the film. The cast was not filmed entirely of good looking model type people and the film felt real for that reason alone. The cast was filmed with people that look like us today (With the exception of the haircuts). The remake went down a different path and cast the entire cast with extremely attractive people. That lends a little disbelief to the film. Sure, nearly every girl was quite easy on the eye's especially Betsy Rue who does almost her entire role completely naked, but that does bring some disbelief into the film.

  The remake follows plot points of the original while telling a completely different story than the original. The back story of Harry Warden is the same and the character names remain fairly similar to the original. I don't quite know how to feel about the story being different as I am so partial to the original and I would have had even more misgivings if the film was a carbon copy of the original. While the movie played several homages to the original, like I said before the story was quite different.

  This film brings the INCREDIBLE Tom Atkins back to the big screen in a big way and man, did we miss him! The story moves quickly and has plenty of gore which looks quite good. The film offers a little bit of suspense and a ton of cheap/fun scares and I guarantee you'll jump a time or two! The new story line is not bad but not as good as the original and the payoff to who the killer is not as big as the original in my opinion. The producers really wanted to something quite different in this film in which they succeeded, but alas does not live up to the original.

  The DVD sets are available in 2D and the theatrically released 3D, which is decent in home viewing but not as elaborate as the REAL-D offered in theaters. There is a one disc set and a two disc set. For the person just buying the film because they liked it, the one disc set is plenty! It has both versions of the film(2D & 3D)and a semi informative commentary on it well. The 2 disc set contains a bonus disc of a few  featurettes which are nothing to write home about. The first is a 7 minute feature with quick interviews with the director, writer and the cast. It was very bland and run of the mill. The second and last feature looks at the makeup F/X and was pretty informative. The disc is rounded out with deleted scenes and an alternate ending that is not very alternate at all. The 2 disc set is not worth the extra dollars they charge for it and I am bit surprised by Lionsgate for packaging it this way as the film was quite successful at the box office and there was no need to split the sets like this to try and recoup monies not made from the theatrical run. The 2 disc set are for die hard fans of the film only!

  All in all, a good remake  and I would recommend it to any horror fans but would advise to get the original as well which was much more superior to this remake. The original is available in a ""Special Edition"" with the cut gore the MPAA made the producers cut from the film so long ago, and that is the one to get!

3735221,4,B001OQCVH4,"In the current glut of rotten remakes, this one is different.  It is pretty good!  I saw it in the theatre in 3D and am happy to say that although the 3D version included on this blu-ray disc suffers somewhat compared to the theatrical, it still flys off the screen fairly well.  The disc includes four pairs of magenta/green 3D glasses (the same improved anaglyphic process used for JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH) and in spite of a few ghosting and bluring problems, the 3D effect is quite good.  The weird color scheme adds a surreal element to the film that certainly isn't there in the theatrical version or 2D version.  I liked it. The glasses are actually pretty tacky and have an advertisement for SAW VI printed on them./ The 2D transfer (viewed on a 52 inch Sharp LCD screen) looked perfect to my eyes, one of the best blu-ray transfers I've seen yet.  I didn't notice any grain or artifacting, colors were spot on and flesh tones accurate.  The sound is about as good as you can get, boasting a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack that will give your speakers a real workout.

The disc seems to be stuffed full of bonus features but this is a deception.  The second disc is merely a digital copy in 2D standard def.  Why anyone would ever want to view this film on an iphone or ipod or laptop is a mystery to me.  The code for the disc expires after one year.  I'll be using mine for a coaster.

Bonus materials are actually rather lame.  It may take you longer to read the descriptions of them on the back of the case than actually watch them.  There is a SHORT (7 minutes) documentary (in HD) called DEEP INSIDE MY BLOODY VALENTINE that offers no insight into the making of the film and is little more than a commercial.  Slightly better (but still only 5 minutes) (also in HD) is a piece on the making of the gore effects.  /  There are several short and uninteresting deleted scenes, a two minute gag real and an alternate ending that isn't much different from the theatrical ending. All of these are presented in gutterboxed standard definition and they look dismal. /  There is a writer/director commentary that simply describes what is going on on screen.  Not especially entertaining or informative.  /  This disc has the BDLive features that take you to a Lionsgate website where you will be prompted to download ringtones and enjoy Lionsgate advertisments and bask in their wonderful ""special offers"".  For a disc that appears to offer so much in the way of bonus features, there are really surprisingly few here and none of genuine interest.  I was quite anxious to learn about the 3D film process and what had to be done to transfer the film to the home video format.  Nothing about 3D is even mentioned in this material.  /The theatrical trailer (in HD) is included. Not included with the Blu-ray is the cool holographic slipcase that comes with the DVD version.

Summing up the good stuff:  Contains two excellent transfers of a decent remake.

Summing up the bad stuff:  All the spectacular bonus features the disc appears to contain are mostly garbage (and very brief garbage at that).",1242691200,5,3115,4.580470162748644

3735243,4,B001OQCVH4,"I would say this movie is more of a *** and 1/2 star pic.

Yes, all those dirty little, those-who-we-don't-speak-of cheapie slasher films from the late 70's and all throughout the 80's are being remade or revamped or whatever the hell term folks use so they don't have to say, ""We're out of fresh ideas"" are in full force in the new millenium!  Some work out or are mild time wasters.  Some fall so flat it's an embarassment to have seen them(The Fog,When A Stranger Calls,Prom Night).  Some do the original's justice and bring something fresh to the table.  Well, lucky for Hollywood that horror film fans, the most loyal and well versed of all movie goers, are so hungry for horror that they'll sit through any remake, since its all that seems to be made these days, just to go and see a horror film.  Now we have the most unnecessary of unnecessary horror remakes, My Bloody Valentine.

Well, not completely unnecessary.  I've always said if you want to remake horror, then why not remake the ones that didn't work, but had good premises.  The original film was a slight but fairly entertaining slasher pic from that far off land called 1981.  It was a little nastier then the usual slasher fare(Friday The 13th series helped up the grue factor that trendsetters like Black Christmas and Halloween so masterfully avoided)but was well made and an intersting enough murder mystery similar to an Agatha Christie novel by the way of Scooby Doo for movie goers to dig into.  It wasn't anything special or great, but it got it's job done effieciently enough.  These films cling to the suspense of eventually revealing who the masked slasher is.  Like most slashers the identity of the killer is besides the point, and it's more about the ride it takes to get there.  Whoever it ends up being is going to be a let down no matter what.  This remake does play fair with its red herrings, for the most part.

The new My Bloody Valentine doesn't rock the boat on the tried and true tropes of the original or the slasher genre, but manages to be a fun ride nonetheless.  This is what I call a funhouse horror film.  It's not particularly scary or original, but it has the mechanics to make an audience jump or cheer at certain moments.  This film won't follow you home and into your nightmares, but it will put a smile on your face while you're vieweing it.  The plot is essentially the same as the original, no major surgery was done to the structure or overall plot of the first film.

The acting is all spot on.  Our three main performers, Jamie King, Kerr Smith, and Jensen Ackles, play their parts realistically and garner enough sympathy or interst to give the audience a reason to care who gets axed next.  Ah, and this may not matter to anyone but me, but we get a cast made up of GROWN UPS.  There are no teens occupying any of the roles in this film.  The prologue sets you up for a typical 80's slashathon complete with drinking teens partying at an abandoned mine, but then shifts ten years later and gives us our survivors in their grown up form.  No high school meladrama.  No immature jokes or occupations.  The characters have families, jobs and actual responsibilites.  Hell, we even get Tom Atkins and Kevin Tighe to play major characters in the film.  I'm a huge Atkins fan.  Night Of The Creeps is a personal fav.  I had heard about his casting in this film and I thought it would just be a cameo so the filmmakers could prove how hip and down they are with the horror community, but no, he actually has a real character and gives a real performance, AND has a major role in the film's ultimate plot.

The film was directed by the great film editor Patrick Lussier.  He was brought up working with Wes Craven on Wes Craven's New Nightmare, the Scream trilogy, and the ultimately cursed Cursed.  He's a good filmmaker who hasn't made that many great films.  The only stand out in his directing resume for me is his first sequel to his mediocre directorial debut Dracula 2000.  His other films(The Prophecy 3, White Noise 2, Dracula 200, and Dracula 3) all had varying degrees of success without being outright awful(though, The Prophecy 3 came close).  He's keeps the pace quick and the energy level high.  The story all the way through to its final conclusions stick.  The suspense scenes are all very elaborate, much more so then the original or many other recent slashers including the Friday The 13th remake.  The gore level is high as well.  The gags are along the line of the type of funhouse horror I mentioned earlier.  It's all for fun and shock and it works this time.

Special mention must go to the hotel scene with the Irene character.  Thank you, Mr. Lussier for bringing sex back to the cinema, even if it's in the exploitation context.  That old horror film addage about how the audience will be more scared if a female is being chased as opposed to a man, and even more scary if that female is scantily clad, is truly exploited to it's fullest potential in this film and in this scene.  It starts off titilating and then turns kind of goofy but then switches gears into unrelenting terror and then grue.  Good job.

The problem that enters my happy horror town comes due to the lack of innovation.  I'm a slasher fan.  I like when the conventions are presented well and then executed even better, which this film does, but I do think after about 30 years worth of slasher films a little more originality could've been thrown into the broth, even if this film is a remake.  It's rote but done well.  Nothing overly imaginative or original here folks.

Secondly, the 3-D gimmick was one of the major high points this film acheived theatrically.  It was totally fun and added to my point regarding funhouse horror.  The 3-D is quite good, but not intrussive and obvious like most the ones from the 80's(Friday part III,Jaws 3).  It helped push this film past the fact that it wasn't that original.  The gimmick really helped this film alot.  On DVD we lose the gimmick almost entirely.  I'm afraid the home theatre technology regarding 3-D isn't at a place of innovation or interest.  The 3-D side of the two disc set is almost worthless.  You get only a vague semblance of the effect from seeing it in theatres.  Bummer.

The DVD itself is okay.  The second dis has the usual deleted, alternate and extended scenes.  Most are extensions and character beats of already existing scenes.  There's more red herrings offered, though in the final film only two of the red herrings actually have any interest and the audience knows who will be the major suspects in the final scene quite early on.  The two featurettes are far too short for life.  The only thing intersting about the first is that we learn that the mine was an actual mine and not a set.  The second is dedicated to the practical gore effects by the great Gary Tunnicliffe(Feast and all the Dimension produced Hellraiser sequels).  It's cool to see how the practical effects functioned and how CGI was used as an enhancement as opposed to the final word, but if you've seen one make-up effects featurette, you've seen them all.  Together the featurettes run about 14 minutes.  The real prize of this DVD, the one special feature offered on the single disc, is the commentary by director Patrick Lussier and co-screenwriter Gary Farmer(Jason X).  I have listened to commentaries by both these men on other films and they are truly entertaining, more entertaining then the film itself.  It's worth a listen.  It's a good place to start your commentary listening career if you've never listened to one, or start with Scream(Kevin Williamson, Wes Craven commentary).

A blurb on the DVD cover reads, ""Best 3-D horror film made ever!"" Well, not quite.  I would vote this one for a third place spot after Creature From The Black Lagoon and House On Haunted Hill(original, DUH), which I've had the pleasure of seeing both in 3-D theatrical showings.

This DVD uses the same glasses that Journey to the Center of the Earth used which amazingly worked well with that film. With this one, not so good. Some of the film works perfectly but other parts, normaly the ones with distance shots just failed badly. Not sure what went wrong in the transfer. Also, bought the special 2-disc release but it was not worth it. The extras were very slim and only advertise other films.
  Really, I expected better viewing of the 3D since they did use lighter lenses but the depth was totaly ruined in several scenes.
  Now the good parts. The out of screen effects totally worked. I know that's a big contrast to what I'm saying but they really worked well. Other than that the depth concern still weighs heavy. Expect to see thing being thrown in your face but don't expect to be able to look into the picture like most 3D movies.

3735248,4,B001OQCVH4,"With all due respect, the Amazon review is pretty much a whole lot of nuttin'.  My apologies to the author.  It's overly simplistic and dismissive and not in a fair way.  Not that this movie deserves the psychological dissection one would offer Bergman's ""Persona"" but it merits more than a begrudging, rueful wink.  Sure, the gore is evident; it's a horror film, but it's not, in any way, of the sadistic variety, like Hostel's or Saw's, two film franchises whose sole raison d'etre is find the most heinous forms of inflicting pain while simultaneously ratcheting zero on the mood and terror scale.  It's first rate sadism without any of the residual pleasure.  Just kidding.  Yep, the nude scene is pretty remarkable (and equally gratuitous) if for no other reason than its duration, but it's indicative of the director's take on the source material.  Tongue is firmly planted on cheek throughout, but not so much so that it borders on satire.  It's horror alright but just like the classic slasher films of the 70's and 80's it's steadily winking at its audience with the occasional jab at the ribs.  It's meant to be fun and it is.  It doesn't stray far from the original, but there are enough changes to make it feel contemporary but thankfully avoids the pitfalls that most modern horror films fall into and that is too much of everything except what matters - atmosphere, dread, panic, fear and sly humor; all essential components of the genre.  I enjoyed this movie a great deal more than I thought I would because I am a big of the original.  Great fun, jump scares and genuine edge of seat scenes, MBV, doesn't disappoint.  The 3D gimmick works well but the movie would be just as much fun and effective without it.",1241740800,4,1726,4.691029900332226
3735249,4,B001OQCVH4,"I watched the original a few days before I saw this to get ready for the remake! I had the pleasure of seeing this with my ex-girlfriend, whom I haven't seen in eight months. (We're still friends.) We both thought this remake was pretty good. I loved all the gory deaths and thought all the deaths with the pickaxe were very creative! The remake is pretty different than the original. Ten years after a Valentine's Day Massacre, Tom Hanniger returns to Harmony to sell the coal mine. Soon after, the murders start again. Another part I loved was when the smokin' hot naked girl was running around and trying to get away from the coal miner. I didn't get to see it in 3D, but that was okay. If you love horror, gore, sex, and chocolate, I highly recommend that you be MY BLOODY VALENTINE!!!",1241740800,,789,4.448275862068965
3735250,3,B001OQCVH4,"The gimmick alone was enough to draw me to this remake of a somewhat average slasher from my youth. I love 3-D on the big screen, no matter the genre, and this latest wave of films has by far the best technology behind it, a technology that looks set to stick around for awhile, too, unlike it's many predecessors. Sadly, this DVD edition is in anaglyphic red-green style 3-D, which will give you headaches. And the extended nude scene won't have a FRACTION of the impact it had in theatres. Thus, while I'd give the FILM a 4-star rating, I have to give this DVD an automatic 3-star for the lack of proper 3-D.

Still, even without the added depth of field, this would be a darned good retro-style horror flick just on its own terms, but probably no more a classic than the original. What surprised me most was the total lack of ""hipster ironic"" characters that have come to pollute the slasher genre in the last decade or so. There's a straightforward sincerity to the writing here (and thus the characters) that makes this one of the few legitimate descendants of the heralded, groundbreaking ""holiday"" slashers of the 70's and 80's. The characters here haven't been raised on a diet of horror movies. I like 'em like that.

Also refreshing is the lack of protracted scenes of suffering and torture that have also plagued the last few years of horror in general. There's gore galore here, and several tense pursuits, but the actual killings are quick, gruesome, and they make people giggle a bit afterwards, which is always fun, and not surprisingly they're preceded by (and punctuated with) as many tried-and-true ""easy shock"" tactics as the filmmakers can utilize from the genre playbook (shadowy whooshes, music stings, fake-out hand grabs, you name it).

Though the actors playing them don't always look it, the principal characters are late-20's/early 30's small town working stiffs (a trait this shares with the original, as I recall), a nice contrast to the reckless partying teenagers who've often inhabited these kinds of films in recent years. Another plus is the screen time afforded the even-more-senior characters actors on hand; most notably Kevin Tighe, genre stalwart Tom Atkins, and a handful of old coots playing the veteran miners who fear for their little town's livelihood when the mine-owner's son (Jensen Ackles) returns home after nearly a decade away to ostensibly close down the operation, until he decides to stay and rekindle an old flame (Jamie King) who's now married to his former rival (Kerr Smith), who's now the town sheriff and a philanderer to boot. No great drama here, but it's enough glue to hold your interest together between kills.

The writers try their best to whip up a convoluted keep-'em-guessing game with the identity of the vengeful killer, who may or may not be Harry Warden, the miner who awoke from an mine-accident-induced coma to go on a squishy rampage ten years earlier (in a way, the entire first film plays out in the first few minutes of this one). I guessed his identity before the end, but it was entirely dumb luck, as I'm sure most of us are fully accustomed after a lifetime of absorbing horror tropes to whittling down possible outcomes almost from the very first frame of movies like these. You're bound to be right once in a while, even when the filmmakers pull a couple of BIG fast ones to throw you off the scent.

Anyways, whoever he may be, the carnage the miner wreaks on his victims makes excellent use of the 3-D frame. Pickaxes, tree branches, breasts, shaved vulva, eyeballs, jawbones and squirts of blood fly out with an assured technical proficiency and giddy abandon, while plenty of craterous wounds are lingered on for all their worth; the filmmakers keep the technology in lively play between kills so they don't seem like grandstand moments in an otherwise ""flat"" picture.

This is definitely hard-R territory, by the way, most impressively illustrated by the lovely Betsy Rue, a TV bit player whose extended, fully naked, and, for the most part, full frontal run-in with the killer must set some kind of precedent for mainstream genre horror, past and present. While her respectable TV resume might never have gotten her any awards, she definitely deserves some kind of recognition for her very revealing (and rather amusing) work here. Go girl!

Hope to see a few more like this before the seedier fare starts to make use of the technology.",1241308800,,4428,4.826086956521739
3735251,5,B001OQCVH4,"First I would like to start off by saying this movie was really good. Even better since I saw it in the theatres in digital 3D. Wow oh Wow to that!

I am sick and tired of people always leaving bad reviews for horror movies only because they are remakes and they believe it is horrible. That is the only reason why people allow themselves to hate good horror because most horror movies anymore are remakes. STOP IDIOTS!!!

This movie to me was full of good acting and not predictable to me, because let me say sorry, I haven't seen the original. So that didn't ruin it for me! I love the Saw movie like surprise ending to it. The many ways people died in the movie...I will admit they happened before in other horror movies, but the way it happened was just totally great!

Like many people say...""oh this wasn't scary"". It always depends on how jumpy you are and how your nerves are and how easily you get scared at things. So if you are not scared easily, you may think the movie reaks of horrible movie flick. If you scare easily...you will jump alot to this movie, like I did.

Possible mini type spoilers below...They don't really give anything away though...so go right ahead!!!

Like every horror movie though...You will feel sad for one person...glad another died...they stay sterotypical and only allow two people to live...and....Make sure you watch the whole entire disc...by that I mean there is a surprise after the credits.",1241049600,,1437,4.59765625

You have the typical over the top graphic blood and gore scenes that are usually expected from movies of this genre and day and age. Let's be honest, assuming you never saw the original film anyway was there really a person watching this movie who didn't already see who the killer was a mile away. I, for one, wasn't surprised at all. I think that's what this film was missing the element of surprise, and everything else was like lukewarm water. Don't get me wrong, the movie was decent, but nothing to jump up and down about by any means.

Talk about added ""lost"" footage making a decent slasher flick really, really good. Back to the 2009 MBV. The cast is pretty good (lots of people you might recognize, but no big names), the dialogue is a little better than your average slasher and most of all the kills are very creative, with the gore taken to the extreme at times. The miner is an intimidating killer and looks scary, but sadly the movie really isn't (just some minor suspense moments). Oh, I almost forgot to mention that there are a few hot chicks and one of them runs around buck naked for nearly 5 minutes in 3-D. This flick is just sounding better and better right?

The digital 3-D presentation is a must for horror fans. The picture is crystal clear and it gives the film so much depth you really feel like you are part of the story. If buckets of blood, body parts and one mean pickaxe flying at you sounds like a good time, then go see this one before it leaves theaters. Now the regular 2-D version might be a different story.

Just to let some of you know, the DVD and Blu-ray version won't be digital 3-D like in theaters (can't wait until they perfect that), so you will get four multi-colored glasses for regular 3-D. You will also have the option of just watching it in 2-D.",1237075200,66,1384,4.3604651162790695

It is not a tiresome shot for shot study, and it is respectful of the original. The differences add to the story rather than taking away. This could have been better if shot in a real mine, but it looks good nonetheless. I would Imagine that the huge RealD cameras prevented shooting on location like the original. Aside from the modern looks and 3D, I felt like I was watching a late seventies, early eighties, non-meddling MPAA horror flick. It is just good gory fun and I think most slasher fans will like it.

While there are a few cool shots in the movie, nothing really jumped out at me and made me saw WOW! My Bloody Valentine was filmed in REALD and while it's not the first film to be filmed in this format, it doesn't have anywhere near the success that Journey To The Center Of The Earth had last summer. Watching the film it became apparent that the format has yet to be perfected and I'm hoping that when Avatar & Final Destination 4 are realeased later this year in REALD, that movie studios have worked out all the bugs. As for the film itself, it's just your run of the mill slasher film with dumb characters, pointless nudity and horrible acting. I've never been one to down a so bad it's good slasher film as I rank both the Sleepaway Camp & Slumber Party Massacre series high in my guilty pleasures book, but watching My Bloody Valentine was more painful than a New Kids On The Block Concert. Jensen Ackles from the hit WB series Supernatural gives a horrible acting debut performance as Tom. I didn't go into this movie expecting Ackles to have the same dramatic prowse of say Brando or Penn but, Ackles lines are amateurish in delivery and he doesn't have the experience or the talent to carry this movie. In the female lead role, Jamie King doesn't display the type of courage needed for a female horror heroine and I was just waiting for her untimely demise, which sadly doesn't happen. Finally Kerr Smith shows why he hasn't had a decent acting job, since his days on Dawson's Creek.  Lionsgate should be ashamed of themselves for remaking My Bloody Valentine, as the remake gives the original a bad name.  Horror films are supposed to be so bad there good, sadly My Bloody Valentine ranks as the worst horror remake since Dark Water; with the added 3-D effect it gains 1  star but other than that it's a waste of time of money.",1234051200,3,2185,4.482412060301508
3735282,4,B001OQCVH4,"I saw My Bloody Valentine on-line before I saw it in 3-D and it was a mistake. I really saw what I was missing out on when I saw it in 3-D. It was amazing and a lot of fun. Every horror movie should be in 3-D because it really works. Kid movies in 3-D have often proven to be corny.

  I liked the film before I saw it in 3-D but I was a lot more entertained by it in 3-D. I saw the original when I was younger and a lot people didn't want it remade. I hate remakes too but if it's a movie that could be improved, then I don't mind. I mean, Nightmare on Elmstreet ""coming 2010"" and Halloween shouldn't have remakes. Bloody Valentine however works, the killer is scarier and more of an animal. The gore is a hell of a lot better as well.

  The acting isn't that bad as well. Well, the performances by the leads anyway. Jensen Ackles is a little better in Supernatural where he can be cool and funny. I'm not saying he's bad though, since he's better than a few of the supporting actors. Jaime King (Sin City) as his ex-girlfriend and Kerr Smith (Final Destination, Dawson's Creek) as her jealous and paranoid husband are a bit better though. Smith, especially I think should get more work. It did work a little better in the original though that Axel was a coal miner. Smith playing a Sheriff named...Axel didn't entirely work for me. But he still gets some of the funnier lines. While the ending didn't entirely work for me the first time around but I accepted it a little better the 2nd time.

It was an entertaining thrill ride, though. I don't think MBV was horrifying or scary, but it was definitely suspenseful and riddled with awesome 3D blood-spattering effects. The jaw scene was really good effects-wise. Yes, the movie and gore is fake, but seeing someone get an axe in the face, even if it isn't real, definitely churns the contents of the stomach a bit.

The film does feature a few minutes of full frontal female nudity, but it wasn't over the top nasty or anything. It was actually kind of funny. And you know once someone gets naked in a slasher film, they're going to die. It was totally predictable, as was a lot of the movie, but the ending was definitely not foreseeable. There was a super twist when the killer's identity was finally revealed. It was a great surprise ending, and there was a cliffhanger to get us ready for the next MBV installment which will hopefully be released in 3D as well.

I would recommend this for the entertainment value, but don't expect to have nightmares or be terrified by what you see. And see this in the theater because watching 3D on a DVD is not that great.",1233014400,2,1338,4.502057613168724

And on top of that, this film is the first live action horror movie to be released in Digital 3D-yes, the Real D technology. This was my second time in the digital theater, the first being the second time seeing U2 3D (the first time I saw U2 3D was in IMAX). And Real D is a revolutionary technology and change to the 3D world. The lenses are polarized, instead of the godawful Red and Blue blur. This has to be the best 3D I've seen! Anyways, besides that, this movie is incredibly scary, and even scarier in 3D! On valentine's night, 1998, At a mine, there was a fatal accident, resulting in everyone down there dying except one- Harry Warden. He is knocked into a Coma, and awakens, taking a rampage on the city. He creates a brutal massacre and is later shot, thought to be dead.

However, Harry isn't dead, he has clearly come back to finish what he has done 10 years ago! However, the horrific killings are all related to Tom somehow. They all have Tom's name on him, and Tom goes to discover why he is attached to it.

Anyways, this is a fantastic 3D ride, and is even better than the craptacular original. It is everything the original should have been, and has LOADS of gore!!!!! There's gore everywhere. I love it. Me being a gore hound, I was satisfied with all the bloody stabbings, disembowelment and lovely stuff. It's what us horror fans expect. Plus the eye popping out of the screen was insane. The 3D was the most insane thing I've seen. I was dodging several times, and I jumped lots of times too. Great horror ride!!! So overall, this is a fantastic movie, one that's a must see for sure in the theater, and the ultimate 3D ride. As the trailer says, ""Nothing says 'Date movie' like a 3D ride to hell""! OK I did not see it with a date, but overall, it was one of the most fun times I had at the movies.",1232841600,,2382,4.3125

This one probably deserves a two or three star rating without the 3-D, so the impact of the visuals alone was pretty substantial in my view.  I get the impression we will see much more from 3-D in the near future.

For those who don't know, this is a slasher film so we get all kinds of body parts flying at us throughout the film.  I literally felt like I may have got some blood sprayed on me while watching, so take that for it is.  I laughed and was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. There was even plenty of nudity in an attempt to harken back to slasher movies of yesteryear.  The nudity was so gratuitous I had to believe they were joking.  The actress was literally full body naked for five or so minutes onscreen.  I'm oddly pleased to see the film not earn an NC-17 rating for that but I'm not sure what else there is to say.  It is what it is I suppose.  Two years ago the film would not have made it through with an R.

My Bloody Valentine follows a group of friends living in a small mining town that experiences several violent tragedies; including a cave-in followed by the loan survivor being accused of killing everyone else, a massive killing spree after that, and then another killing spree ten years later.  The latter of those events making up most of the film we see here.  There is very little attempt to make the story or events believable but this is exploitation horror we are talking about here. Not to say that makes it somehow forgiveable, just that those are typically the expectations. To actually credit some of the actors and perhaps even the writers, I actually cared about the scooby-doo-esque kind of ending by the time we got there.

Anyway, amazing effects here, and a whole new level of 3-D visuals.  If that sounds good to you see it in the theater before it's gone.  If you miss it, let's all keep our fingers crossed that we get some good 3-D technology for our home cinemas.",1232668800,16,2487,5.066339066339066
3735316,5,B001OQCVH4,"I really didn't expect much acting or plotwise but along with the very best and effective 3-D effects I have ever seen, the acting is competent and the plot keeps you engrossed and on the edge of your seat. Unlike Friday the 13th 3-D, of which I still feel the 3-D effects were the only worthwhile thing going for it, I will buy the remake of My Bloody Valentine on DVD when available, even without the 3-D effects. Aside from a few very minor quibbles, My Bloody Valentine 3-D is well-cast, well-acted, well-written, well photographed and well-directed. On top of that, it is also enormously entertaining and doesn't take itself too seriously. Even so, there are some very effective moments of menace and suspense. The make-up effects are also stunningly real and are extremely well-done. The film also benefits greatly from the excellent use of on-location filming in Pennsylvania, including partly in an old coal mine. The new Real D 3-D effects offer some moments that had me flinching and ducking for cover!! It is also great to see Tom Atkins back in a horror film as the first town sheriff. Betsy Rue was also very memorable as ""Irene"". Her scenes are all too short, but you won't forget them anytime soon!! Don't miss this in 3-D. I had to go out of my way to find a theater that was showing it in 3-D, but it is well-worth any effort, time and trouble. I highly recommend it.",1232409600,,1384,4.584677419354839

That alone made me inclined to go check out this remake in the theater, but then I found out that the movie was in 3-D and I also have fond memories of getting hit in the arm repeatedly by my date because I was laughing so much when Jason popped that eye out of the kid's head in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-Part-3-3-D/dp/B001K9OXEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th, Part 3 3-D</a>"" way back when.  So that was two good reasons to go see this movie, even though I knew there was a good chance that we would be getting the 2-D version and not the 3-D version here in the Zenith City.

That indeed was the case, but even in 2-D I think you can certainly pick up most of the 3-D effects, and director Patrick Lussier has the requistie sick fun when it comes to using the gimmick.  Yes, there is a lot having to do with the pick axe and various gun barrels, but the opening credits with the newspaper headlines looked like it would work well in 3-D and I have to admit the bit with the shovel was a certainly sick and twisted (but in a good way).  So I have to say that a strength of this movie in that even one dimension short of a full three they milk the gimmick for what it is worthy (certainly more than ""Friday the 13th Part 3 3-D"").

The basic plot is that once upon a time there was a mine accident and Harry Warden (Richard John Walters), well, he went a bit crazy and started killing people (the body count by the end of the title credits of this movie might be a record for one guy with using something other than a gun as a weapon).  Then we jump ahead ten years where we meet up with the kids who got away.  We have Tom Hanniger (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jensen-Ackles/dp/B000X5SPBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jensen Ackles</a>), the son of the owner of the mine, who was responsible for the original cave in of the mine.  His old flame Sarah (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaime-King/dp/B000TJBN76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaime King</a>) has married Axel Palmer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kerr-Smith/dp/0780631684/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kerr Smith</a>), who is now the sheriff of the town.  While Irene (Betsy Rue), Axel's date on the fateful night way back when, has become the local party girl.  Also in the mix is the former Sheriff Burke (Tom Atkins), his deputy (Edi Gathegi), and Ben Foley (Kevin Tighe), who manages the mine.  Then there is Megan (Megan Boone), one of those sweet young things who is just begging to be one of the victims in this movie.

There is, of course, the requisite stupidity on the part of the characters, so if there are two people with guns, they should separate as soon as possible, and if you are protecting yourself with a shotgun make sure you keep it unloaded.  Furthermore, if you go looking for a homicidal maniac with a pick axe, make sure you go check out the mine at night and in addition to a flashlight bring a crowbar, because that will help you get into the locked up mine.  It will not do anything against a homicidal maniac with a pick axe, but, hey, you have that flashlight, right?  However, it is one thing for the characters to have their stupid moments, and another to hope the audience sinks to their level.

This is one of those movies where early on in the ""ten years later"" part there is an obvious suspect who has a motive totally unrelated to what happened at the mine.  They are so obvious that you think, hey, it cannot be that obvious.  You then start thinking about how likely it is the most unlikely character could be the suspect, but then there is evidence to say that cannot be the case.  You also remember that unless you see the corpse a dead person is not dead.  Clearly there are only a limited number of people who can be actual suspects, so I was open to other possibilities.  More importantly, I did not remember who the killer in the original was; I just remembered the killer's last words (and was disappointed that the line was not used in the endgame of the remake).  However, when we get to the big reveal it turns out that it is based on what I consider to be a cheat, because it requires you to extrapolate on a telling detail that is focused on a couple of times and to ignore a key piece of evidence.  Actually, I am surprised I was not more ticked off at the turn of events, because it is one thing to be fooled by a well crafted script and another to be tricked in a manner like this.

Consequently, while ""My Bloody Valentine 3D"" was heading for at least a solid four star rating, there has to be a deduction for the way the movie plays with us in its end game.  I was almost tempted to put the movie in a position to round up, but there was a bit of adding insult to injury when one of the suspects says something surprising; it would have made for a nice moment if it were not totally inconsistent with his character.  Toss in the aforementioned fact that we do not get the original film's signature last line, and we end up not rounding up on this one.  Final note: Horror film buffs probably know that 9 minutes of the original version of ""My Bloody Valentine"" were cut because they were deemed too gory.  When Lionsgate got the rights to the original to make the remake, they got the rights to that missing footage and the un-cut version of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Bloody-Valentine/dp/B000069I04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Bloody Valentine</a>"" was released last week on DVD as the remake opened in theaters.",1232323200,4,6363,5.132623426911907
3735318,4,B001OQCVH4,"Opening weekend (intentional), and second row (due to cutting it too close, time-wise), my buddies and I (yes, I had to do some leaning) found ourselves part of the throng attending a screening of MY BLOODY VALENTINE in 3D. Happily surrendering to the goofiness inherent when movies are watched while sporting plastic and cardboard glasses, the four of us 40-somethings (somehow a minority at this show!) surrendered to this flashback of early-80s splatter cinema souped up with state-of-the-art 3D cinematography. As a lifelong horror fan I was psyched to see this, just as a Streep fan I was excited to see DOUBT. They won't be competing this awards season, it's true, but both come strongly recommended. As long as you know what you are getting into. I mean, it IS ""My Bloody Valentine in 3-D"". So no surprises?
I will start off by just saying WOW! The 3D effects are pretty jaw-dropping (LITERALLY, but that comes later in one particularly gruesome character bump-off). The opening credits come as a classy montage that show off not only some of the artistry of the filmmakers, but just how good this cinematic gimmick has become. The story is set up quickly and efficiently, with the horror standard of ""Tragedy Plus Time Plus Revenge Equals Terror"" not breaking any new ground. The iconic gas-masked miner-as murderer, often lit ominously from behind, gives both Jason and Freddy serious runs for their money, as the residents of this small mining town are systematically and gruesomely dispatched.
Make no mistake, this is not great cinema. However, it is a great entry in the horror genre that has lately only been notable for lackluster remakes of old B-Horror flicks that have somehow achieved ""classic"" status. An unconvincing love triangle fails, although DOES manage to succeed in throwing a wrench in the often easily-predicted actual identity of the killer. There is gore and gratuitous nudity to spare, so die-hard 1980s horror fans will have plenty to love. Ultimately, a film that seemed destined to impress no one succeeds spectacularly.

Anyway, it's still a helluva good movie without the glasses but 3-D would be pretty cool. The kills were fantastic, probably the best in years. It was also nice to Tom Atkins back in films, he was in so many 80 horror films. There was a few flaws, namely the story was beyond stupid like

The killer was attacking two women in a supermarket, she calls the cops and then presses an alarm not even a few minutes later.

Axel's father had a cabin in the woods. Its near the mines, in the middle of the woods, and there are no other cabins around. Does not make alot of sense.

The ending was seen from the very start of the film. While Axel is the killer in the original, he was not the killer in the remake. Sorry if you haven't seen the film.

All in all, the kills were awesome. The story and the ending were just plain crap but most people just want to go for the kills and sex, so it shouldnt bother many people.",1232236800,,1003,4.128205128205129

Not only does it carry a solid R rating, and for good reason, it's also in 3-D!!! This is the first 3-D theatrical movie I've seen in more than 25 years! The story is close to the original, which is another plus. A small coal mining town faces a disaster that leaves several miners dead. This time, though, the trouble was caused by inexperienced mine owner's son Jensen Ackles (TV's Supernatural), who didn't ""bleed the lines"" when he was supposed to. Eventually, one survivor is pulled from the depths, one Harry Warden, whose seeming triumph over death takes a sour turn when it becomes known that all the bodies in the mine died from pickaxe wounds. Hmm, sounds like ol' Harry was getting a little stingy with the air down there. Soon after Harry pops up from the hospital and does some ""bleeding the lines"" of his own. But we're talking veins and arteries here as Harry wipes out several hospital workers and some high schoolers partying at the mine before disappearing into its depths one last time, shot and bleeding badly. And we're only fifteen minutes into the movie! From there we move ""ten years later"" as Ackles returns to town just as someone decked out in miner's gear starts swinging that pickaxe again. Is it Harry? Or one of the other suspects the movie wastes no time in setting up. Like Ackles? Or maybe new sheriff and Ackles rival Kerr Smith (Final Destination)? Former Sheriff Tom Atkins (Halloween III)? Shady mine guy Kevin Tighe (TV's Lost)? Or deputy Edi Gathegi (Twilight)? In any case, if you like horror movies, this is simply a lot of fun. In the acting department it's always great to see old pros Atkins and Tighe; and Ackles and Smith handle their contentious roles well as they fight over Jaime King (White Chicks) and try to figure out who's doon it. Director Patrick Lussier (Dracula 2000) makes sure there's no shortage of zesty gore, and Betsy Rue has a wonderfully lengthy nude scene, a rarity in these days of too much PG-13 horror. The 3-D is fantastic, both in the depth it brings to the picture as well as stuff poked out at you. They actually don't do as much of that as you might expect, but they do throw a lot of stuff, which used to be a problem in the older 3-D movies because the thrown item usually split into two due to the problem of holding the focus on a fast moving object. This new process is great, however. I give this one my highest recommendation to those so inclined. Others who want to see 3-D but with a less blood might be better off seeing Bolt.",1232236800,,2686,4.513347022587269

So here we are with the latest in what seems the never ending run of remakes; My Bloody Valentine 3-D is of course a remake of the cult classic slasher flick My Bloody Valentine originally released in 1981. As a child I loved slasher films, but as I got older most just don't work for me as well anymore. The original MBV is one that sort of holds up for me, but it doesn't work as well with me as it once did. But I still enjoy it and I was actually looking forward to the remake. Even thought I did like the original I did see some room for improvement.

For the most MBV 3-D is its own movie, while there are some scenes that are like the original like the body in the dryer gag and the basic idea MBV 3-D doesn't rehash the original it just takes the basic premise and does its own thing. My Bloody Valentine is very much a throwback to 80s slasher flicks and while My Bloody Valentine won't go down as one of the all time greats it does serve it's purpose as a entertaining slasher flick that never really tries to be more than that even though there was potential for more.

The screenplay by Todd Farmer & Zane Smith is what it is; look this is a slasher flick and the script isn't that important. While you do need something decent the great thing about slasher movies is even with a weak script they can still work and this one serves its purpose, but could have been a lot more. Like the original MBV you have the love triangle aspect, but here it only seems more of a filler and only there to really make suspects out of Tom played by Jensen Ackles and Axel Palmer played by Kerr Smith. Like I said there was some potential with the script, but never reached it, but I suppose when all is said and done serves its purpose.

The characters were fairly interesting and are better than your average characters that normally appear. Some add to the plot and others are simply there to pad the body count. But as a whole Farmer and Zane Smith do a fairly good job with the screenplay. Like I said there was some potential with the love triangle aspect, which like I said sort of feels like a filler, but works better than the original with I personally found a little too soap opera like. The fact Axel cheats on his wife never really adds much other than to set him up as a suspect; like I said there was potential for the script to be more than what it was, but when all was said and done Farmer and Smith get the job done.

Director Patrick Lussier who also directed the surprisingly decent White Noise 2 and is best known as an editor and has worked with Wes Craven on several of his movies is a little hit or miss at times here with MBV, but overall Lussier does a solid job. While My Bloody Valentine has some decent moments of suspense, Lussier seems more interested in getting with the bloodshed, which isn't a bad thing at all. The only problem I had with some of the death scenes is some just sort of happen like the eyeball scene. The killer appears and kills the guy with no real set up, but despite that the scene does work well and even if some of the kills lack a bit of set up Lussier still makes them work. Patrick Lussier aimed to make a fun flick and he very much did that. My Bloody Valentine is simply a blast and the movie always moves forward is always a lot of fun.

The acting wasn't bad, but obviously we aren't gonna get Oscar worthy performances. Kerr Smith as Axel Palmer was an interesting character, but not enough was done with him, but he was still solid. Jensen Ackles as Tom Hanniger also delivers a solid performance and Jaime King as Sarah I felt was the best of the lot. Writer Todd Farmer makes a cameo as a trucker and steals the show. The highlight though was Tom Atkins; Atkins is one of my favorite actors and it was great seeing and even better in 3-D. Atkins the coolest man on the planet plays another memorable role.

The mine setting works well, but isn't as creepy as it was in the original and while Lussier manages to build some decent suspense at times like I said he just seemed more interested in the bloodshed, which again like I said isn't a bad thing at all. The original MBV was a splatter flick and that's pretty much what Lussier delivers on. While there are a lot of splatter flicks still being made at times it also almost seems rare so it's great to see a no hold barred splatter flick.

The death scenes are rather gruesome, but brought down some what by the use of CGI, which looks about average and that, takes a way from some really cool deaths, but in general the death scenes are pretty cool and have a nice amount of gore. This is what a slasher film should be like; violent and gory and the makers of MBV very much deliver in that regard. Even with some CGI it's still a blast!

I'd say this one is on par with the original; the original was an aright flick and the remake turns out alright as well. The only thing lacking here is the creepy feel of the original, but what it might lack there it does make up for in being a fun ride with some cool deaths and gore. I almost always favor the originals over remakes, but this is the one time where I might favor a remake. My Bloody Valentine is very much is the style of an 80s splatter flick. The casting is what you see in the typical horror flick these days, but they all did well and it's easy to overlook. But overall I'd probably has to favor the remake over the original, again it might lack the creepy feel the original had, but MBV 3-D makes up for that in pure fun.

I also gotta give credit to the filmmakers for having full frontal nudity. In America these days' sex and nudity is wrong for some reason, but it's good to see Patrick Lussier not giving into the PC world. So many movies released with nudity are for what ever reason called porn and movies like Zack and Miri Make a Porno the previews simply started calling it Zack and Miri and one theater in Utah refused to show it, but yet had no problems showing the violent Saw V. So with the backlash on sex and nudity in films it's good to see a movie not shy away from it. And the full frontal nude scene isn't brief either I should add.

For the most part it seems 3-D never works when released in home video, but My Bloody Valentine actually was fairy decent with the 3-D. The biggest 3-D gags mostly work well. Don't expect it to be as good as it was in cinemas, but it wasn't bad and does work for the most part. When the characters are just standing around it doesn't work all that well except a couple of scenes. But when something is thrown or aimed at the camera it looks pretty good, not great, but good. I was actually surprised at how well the 3-D worked at times. Again it's not as good as it was in cinemas and there is some double images, but for the most part I was surprised at how well the 3-D was.

As for the Blu-ray itself; the picture quality on the 2-D version looks good, but I only checked out a few scenes since I watched it in 3-D, but the quality is strong, but not the best transfer. The audio is 7.1, but I wasn't too impressed with it. It wasn't bad or anything, but like the transfer the sound isn't the best Blu-ray and I watched it on a TV with extra set ups that makes all Blu-ray movies sound amazing, but I just wasn't too impressed. The features are a bit weak. We have some deleted scenes and an alternate ending an audio commentary track with director Patrick Lussier and co-writer Todd Farmer. Deep Inside My Bloody Valentine is a brief making off and was decent, but nothing special and Sex, Blood and Screams a look at the death scenes, which was also decent. The DVD and Blu-ray have the same features with the exception of BD-Live.",1232236800,,7960,4.245706737120211
3735322,3,B001OQCVH4,"""My Bloody Valentine 3-D"" goes for all the cheap thrills, none cheaper than the 3-D effects. This could very well start a campaign to re-animate the gimmick movies pioneered by filmmakers like William Castle, where 3-D glasses are teamed with seat buzzers and costumed ushers running up and down the aisles. On the basis of this film, however, that may not be a good thing to bring back; if you can look past the 3-D effects, ""My Bloody Valentine"" is really no better than your average teen slasher film, paying more attention to gruesome death scenes and dark comedy than it does to story. Want proof? As I was leaving the theater, a group of about six or seven teenage girls were feverishly giggling as one of them shouted, ""Oh my God, he's behind you! Look out!"" Had their thoughts run any deeper, they would have left discussing the film's one graphic sex scene and the possibility that it could usher in an era of 3-D pornography.

My own thoughts tend go in such directions when I really don't care about what I'm watching. The experience of sitting in a theater wearing 3-D glasses should have been enough; after all, I'm seeing all sorts of horrible things fly at me from off the screen, from pickaxes to guns to spatters of blood. But somehow, I didn't find it very frightening. Could it be that the whole 3-D thing was over-hyped? I certainly didn't think the visuals were all that impressive, and this is despite a scene that involves a naked woman angry with a sleazy trucker, a dwarf motel manager that dresses like a Southern prostitute, and a couple of really bloody murders. There are also quite a few shots of the tip of a pickaxe coming directly at us.

The story: Ten years ago, the town of Harmony lost its reputation as a thriving mining community when an inexperienced coal miner named Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) caused an accident that killed five people and put one into a coma. On Valentine's Day one year later, that survivor, Harry Warden, awakens and goes on a rampage, brutally killing pretty much everyone in the hospital before returning to Harmony to murder twenty-two people with a pickaxe. Dressed in a sadistic-looking miner's suit and a creepy mask, Harry Warden met his end in Harmony's coal mine, where Tom and a group of friends had planned on having a party.

Flash forward exactly ten years. On Valentine's Day, Tom returns to Harmony to sell the mine, which was owned by his father. He's motivated by guilt over the five original deaths, which unfortunately isn't winning him any sympathy from the locals. This goes double for Sheriff Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith), who's now married to Tom's old flame, Sarah (Jaime King). As Tom struggles to come to terms with his past and his broken relationship with Sarah, the residents of Harmony live in fear of a new masked killer, whose trademark is slicing open his victims, cutting out their hearts, and placing them in a heart-shaped chocolate box. It is possible that Harry Warden survived ten years ago, that he's come back for another night of terror? Or does Tom have something to do with it, as Axel believes he does? Determined to prove his innocence, Tom turns to Sarah, who may still have feelings for him.

I neglected to mention at the start that this movie is a remake of the 1981 film directed by George Mihalka and written by John Beaird, which, as far as I know, was not released in 3-D. Having not seen this version, I'm afraid I can't say how faithful this remake is. I can say that, regardless of faithfulness, I have no plans to rent the original film. It could be that I'm getting tired of teen slasher films, with their unoriginal plots and cardboard characters and death scenes that get less and less elaborate with every rehash. Let it be known that my problems with ""My Bloody Valentine 3-D"" have nothing to do with the violence or the over-the-top gore effects. Believe me, I expected nothing less. My problems stem from how bored I was; I left feeling as if I had seen the exact same film before, and nothing, not even the 3-D effects, were able to thrill me.

The annoying thing is that I can't think of anything that could have been done differently. Like romantic comedies, slasher films rely heavily on a formula; if you deviate, you no longer have a slasher film. Everything that happens in ""My Bloody Valentine 3-D"" is supposed to happen, right down to the self-indulgent plot twist that only makes sense in the absence of logic. So, since I can't think of a way that this movie could have been made better, the only conclusion I have is that slasher films are past their prime. Not many will agree with me, I know. On the basis of the audience's reaction the day I saw it, some might think I'm a horror fan who has lost his way. Considering how thoroughly they were into it, laughing and screaming pretty much all throughout, they could be right. All I know is that this movie gave me a lot of the same when all I wanted was something new. Maybe filmmakers have to try a little harder than having pickaxes fly at us from off the screen.",1232236800,3,5053,4.572847682119205
8331191,2,B001OQCVH4,"(Being nice to give 2 stars) I like Jensen Ackles from TV's ""Supernatural.""  Plus, there's Kerr Smith and nice supporting roles for Tom Atkins (from ""Halloween III,"" if you're a fan of that original horror film series) and Kevin Tighe (TV's ""Emergency"" from the 70s).  But why did someone have to go and offer them this non-thinking-man's script, which really scrapes the bottom of the barrel in not producing hardly any original horror-genre material (it's a remake of the 1981 movie).  Having said that, though, I used to love this sort of a movie:  A masked killer, his prey on the run half the time (making one bad decision after another), and over-the-top, blood-and-guts mayhem.  Then, I got promoted to the 6th grade.  The ending is almost funny (surely unintentional).

8331194,1,B001OQCVH4,"The movie was just disgusting and awful. I was so excited to see it as I recently watched the original movie and wanted to see the remake.

At the beginning of the movie, there is a scene that shows a fit blonde girl fully nude and shaved running around for 8 minutes. It was shocking is because we're so used to seeing these girls from the waist up! The camera made sure to show her entire body. The scene was really unnecessary and ridiculous. I mean, hello? She could of at least put a bra and a thong on.

Anyways, I didn't enjoy the rest of the movie. For what I saw, there was tons of blood and guts - though it was entertaining enough to finish....I was just... disappointed... What did anyone else think?",1524873600,,712,4.266666666666667

8331199,2,B001OQCVH4,"As a huge fan of Jensen Ackles, I really wanted to like this movie but, unfortunately I didn't. I can't quite put my finger on what went wrong with a typical slasher movie. Some of the acting was atrocious (although the 3 leads did the best they could with what they had), the dialog was the normal horror/slasher crap, but I think the editing is what made this movie so awful. Having watched Jensen in Supernatural for the past 13 years and his role in Ten Inch Hero, I know that he is an amazing actor who is so much more than eye candy. This movie barely shows that at all and it is a damned shame.",1522108800,,601,4.145299145299146
