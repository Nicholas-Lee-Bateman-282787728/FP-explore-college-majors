3157054,5,B0016J9IOS,"Without question, the very best of the workshops I have purchased from Abraham-hicks.
I find the material richer, more poignant, more relevant and more empowering than previous workshops, which when released was still on the cutting edge of free thinking.
If ever you want to find a source of information that will help anyone find their focus in life or resolve any issue, this is it!",1227398400,22,385,4.848484848484849
3157055,4,B0016J9IOS,"I was inspired by Abraham in many ways. I hope this DVD will do the same to you. I love the hot seat questions/answers section. I believe those would be the questions we ask Abraham if we happened to be on the hot seat. I enjoy reading spirituality books and other new age and health topics, however, the message of Abraham has brought my understandings to another level. I recommend this DVD to anyone who is open minded and ready to take your spiritual walk to a different level.",1226966400,7,481,4.415730337078652
3157056,3,B0016J9IOS,HAVE 3 OF THEIR DVD'S AND WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE MORE NEW MATERIAL.  I DO USE LAW OF ATTRACTION AND IT'S WORKING!,1246838400,2,114,3.9565217391304346
3157057,5,B0016J9IOS,"This is the first Abraham-Hicks DVD I've purchased but it won't be the last. It's about getting comfortable ""in the gap"" between where I am and where I want to be, so much so that I feel joy and enthusiasm about the process instead of taking score on where I am and when I'll get there. This is incredibly practical spiritual information and is a great help in understanding the emotions as a personal guidance system.

Abraham uses the classic metaphor of a stream to illustrate the current of life and refers to thoughts as being upstream or downstream. It's not that any one thought is good or bad. It's whether those thoughts are pointed upstream or downstream from where I am in that moment. Essentially, if it feels ""bad"", it's upstream. If a thought makes me feel better, it is downstream (headed towards joy and enthusiasm).

Evidently, all the workshops adhere to the same structure. Abraham talks for about 40 minutes on the basic teaching and then opens the floor to questions, which are answered in depth. There are about 8 questions and answers on the DVD set. Each of the chosen audience participants get their chance in ""the hot seat"" (down by the stage). These are not casual questions. They all resonate as being well thought-out in advance. At the same time, one doesn't get the sense this is staged in any way.

The overall feeling is authentic and deeply spiritual because it's all about love. The beauty of the format is that Abraham uses the questions to discuss the teaching extemporaneously from a variety of angles. So even if a question doesn't seem to pertain to me, the answer touches my experience and provides a more enlightened perspective on the subject. That means I can be ""downstream"" on that subject relative to my own life.

It is wonderful to know that by constantly reaching for improved feeling thoughts, no matter where I am at any given time, my relief tells me I'm headed downstream (towards joy and the manifestation of my desires). And as I keep reaching for better and better feeling thoughts, eventually I reach hope and enthusiasm. That's when I'm thrilled in my experience. That's how I know I'm in alignment. And that's when manifestation comes.",1245024000,10,2195,4.753280839895013
3157058,4,B0016J9IOS,"I learned something about the chakra system and now I also came away feeling less anxious about alarmists who raise issues we are all ""supposed"" to support. I hate running with the crowd and here is more argument that we can all march to our own drumbeat.",1239062400,3,255,4.446808510638298
3157059,1,B0016J9IOS,"After purchasing this item, I wrote a negative review for the video.  My negative comment appeared on the review website for awhile and then suddenly diappeared.

Woderful self help infromation ,well presented. Inspirational and enjoyable. I really love this DVD. Discovered her on the net and believe these teachings have helped to change my life for the better. Can't recommend this highly enough.",1235433600,2,369,5.379310344827586

3157062,5,B0016J9IOS,"As always, Abraham is insightful and curiously entertaining.  Would suggest to anyone to purchase this Episode.",1233187200,2,111,5.9375
3157063,5,B0016J9IOS,"Allowing allowing allowing.....that's the only thing we need to do. The universe already receives what you request through your vibration. We just need to keep finding thoughts to help you feel better at all time. I've been practicing it for a couple years. When I look back, I realize how far I have come. I got a job that brings me joy everyday. My love life looks more and more promising. Thank you to Abraham. At this point I know for the fact that all wonderful things that I want will come to me in a timely fashion if I just keep chilling and being happy.

Every time I start to have upstream thoughts. I will put Abraham mp3 or dvd on. Abraham just brings me back to balance instantly. Because of Abraham, I am a big fan of taking action only when I feel good even when I have conflict with my loved ones. It proves that every time I do that all conflicts came to an end effortlessly.

To people that are reading this review, you are in control of your vibration. So keep on doing and you will get everything you want!",1229990400,15,1026,4.256410256410256
3157064,5,B0016J9IOS,"Very valuable and useful. I have all the LOA workshop series and I really like this one. It is a 2 DVD set of an uplifting intro and then audience questions with response by Abraham.  Immediately after watching, there were several interactions we wanted to watch again.  I keep receiving new insight from the same ideas approached from different angles, brought forth from the unique slant of diverse questioners.  It is amazing. There is always more clarity and a new twist of aha, or a simple statement restated that triggers a delightful sense of 'that ease'. This DVD triggered some great thought bridges for me.
I am so glad they are making these available. With video, it's like being there, almost, at a live presentation - I like the stronger focus it allows.
But what I love, is being reminded who I really am. I love re-remembering and feeling that. That feeling is worth a million dollars+.
This  is excerpted from a Phila, Penn workshop on 5-17-07.  The first DVD is 1 hr 48 min, the second is 2 hours.  The intro is 46 min.",1229212800,18,1036,4.572972972972973

But be careful, once you consciously start on the path of expansion, manifesting your desires, make sure your desires are truly what you want to come into your world -- for they will -- event-ually.  Finally, having tried to apply Abraham-Hicks' teachings for many months, I can truly state that their truth coincides with my own and brings joy to my being.
