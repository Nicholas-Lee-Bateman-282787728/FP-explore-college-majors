7986350,4,B00008QOP6,"I'm quite familiar with this DVD since I produced the original video some years ago. I wanted to clarify a few things in response to comments made by another reviewer here.

One idea behind this instructional video was to show three approaches to scale and arpeggio fingerings, as follows:

1. scales/arps in one position (all keys in one five fret area)

2. one octave scales/arps on two strings, which repeat on the next two two string sets

3. scales/arps on one string

With these three approaches you have access to the entire fretboard and movement in any direction.

I also explain the most common chord types used in jazz and show various scales that can be used.

All the examples are explained and played slowly and clearly, with the names of the notes on the screen, so that anyone with the minimum amount of patience can learn them. With each example I also improvise a bit, to demonstrate what they sound like in context.

I used the progression to ""Blue Bossa"" and the melody and chords to a Charlie Parker blues for real-world examples of how to apply the concepts.

As an educator and pro player I know there is no one-size-fits-all instructional aid, but I did a great deal of research at the time I produced this work, and there was nothing out there with the same concepts as mine available in an audio-visual format. I feel it holds up well, and would be useful for anyone trying to develop a comprehensive approach to the fingerboard and the basic skills need to improvise on chord changes.",1158364800,6,1511,4.629213483146067
7986351,4,B00008QOP6,"This guy is a great player and teaches you some fundamentals to master. Position, diagnal, and single string playing. He goes over several scales used in jazz and then solos using them to give you an idea of the flavor. There are no lick or solo transcriptions but if you have time to transcribe them, you will have some killer licks to copy. This video gives you alot of things to practice that will enhance your understanding of the neck and get your fingers smarter. Its hard work. If all you want are licks I wouldnt buy this dvd unless you are a good transcriber, I wouldnt buy this if you want theory either. If you want some challenging scale work outs and a foundation to create your own licks I'd give it a shot. It's a dvd I watch over and over. If you have not learned the notes on your neck, don't be a bum, learn them like you did your multiplication tables.",1131321600,6,871,4.284848484848485
