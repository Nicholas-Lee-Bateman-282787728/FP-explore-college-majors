8100359,5,B000CQGTUW,"I love this movie. There are only three sets, but the music is stirring in one song and humorous in another and the way they work it into the scriptures is amazing. You will not be disappointed with this movie.",1269907200,,210,4.275
8100360,5,B000CQGTUW,"I'm a little biased, but I love this movie.  Katherine Nelson's voice is amazing, and so is Dan Beck's.  The characters are fun, the lesson is important, and it's very entertaining!",1174262400,,181,4.806451612903226
8100361,5,B000CQGTUW,"My kids love this DVD.  The songs and characters are hilarious (be sure to watch the faces of the characters in the background!), yet the story of a faithful young man still comes across very well.",1155254400,,197,4.472222222222222
8100362,4,B000CQGTUW,"This is a great show and a great series.  Although it is a little hokey and times it is great.  My family of all ages, 3-18 and several in between really like it.  The humor and songs keep them interested while they learn a lesson and a scripture story all at once.  I highly reccommend it for a fun little show.",1140739200,2,312,4.065573770491803
