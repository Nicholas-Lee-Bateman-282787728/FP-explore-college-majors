2555000,1,B000F8OIKU,"I have 2 reasons why I'm giving this a 1 star.  The first reason is because these episodes are not so good.  And karate Island is one of the worst episodes in the whole series.  The other reason is why would someone by this when you could by the first part of spongebob season 4?  It has the same episodes and a lot more.  The price is also better, If you buy this, you have to pay 13.49$ for 7 episodes, but if you buy the first part of spongebob season 4, you have to pay 18.99 for 20 episodes and 2 of them are double length episodes. If you want these episodes and more buy part 1 of season 4.",1311984000,,597,3.9008264462809916

2555003,5,B000F8OIKU,"My little nephew loves this series, and I finally sat down to watch this DVD with him.  I can see why just about everyone would love Spongebob who is charming, happy, clever, fair, and all around wonderful.  This particular DVD has about eight episodes.  Our favorite was Krusty Towers where Mr. Crabs opens a hotel.  We just about split our sides laughing.  This is fun and as far as I can tell not bad for kids.  I think Spongebob sets a good example because he is so friendly and helpful.",1208736000,,491,4.4
