2042997,5,B0001Y4M2C,Outstanding movie that shows the men in black are here..and are not nice.  Exciting from start to finish and the ending is sure to scare you and make you think.,1363392000,,160,4.333333333333333
2042998,1,B0001Y4M2C,"Stink-o-rama! This is one of the worst(and unintentionally funny) movies I've seen in quite some time. Gawd! The acting (or lack thereof) was apparent from start to finish. MIB? Hahahahahaha. No way. These guys would have you rolling on the floor instead of running for your life! In short then...if you want a good laugh this movie is for you...otherwise, go to your dentist. Nuff said...

Edit: I decided to watch this movie again and it was worse that the first time (full of laughs though). Save your money!",1168819200,2,511,4.741573033707865
2042999,4,B0001Y4M2C,"UFO lore holds that people who have experienced encounters are often visited by mysterious men in black who convince them not to talk about their experiences.  While Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones were in a movie that had a lot of fun with this idea, this movie takes the grimmer and darker path.

A family out hiking for a day has an experience with some lights on their way home.  They have little or no memory of the experience except disturbing dreams.  But as they try to figure out what is going on, they get a visit from the Men in Black.  Soon it becomes obvious that they are being watched and are in danger.  They turn to a UFO researcher for help.

Family and researcher piece together more of what happened but get targeted by the Men in Black again.  In the end we learn more about the Men in Black and who they are but not before some very tense action as the story fully unfolds.

Very well-done with a pretty good cast.  The researcher is simplified a little so that the story can unfold in the space of a movie but otherwise it was a tense movie with some chilling moments.",1109894400,16,1090,4.273170731707317
2043000,1,B0001Y4M2C,"I watched this movie today for the first time and I found it

unintentionally hilarious. I can't imagine what Stockwell and

Roberts were thinking when they jumped into this project. The film has the misfortune of being released in the same era as the intentionally hilarious ""Men in Black,"" which steals (and mocks) the thunder from the serious premise of the movie.

One scene in particular had me howling. Six or seven hybrid human/alien MiBs charge a house, and it looks like ""Revenge of the Blues Brothers,"" or something.

I gotta say, I found it riveting for all the wrong reasons.

The acting was horrible, as the actors must have known what

a dog they were in as filming progressed.

Speaking of dogs, Anthrax the Border Collie did a great job.",1093564800,3,753,4.702290076335878
2043001,5,B0001Y4M2C,"This is a well made film. Sure it didn't make it as a big budget film but it should have. The acting is excellent & so is the script. Anyone who likes sci-fi films dealing with shadow men will love this flick. Or even if your a fan of Sherilyn Fenn I recommend you buy it. ... Buy it used thru a auction or check out your video stores. Can't say enough about it, its just a great movie!",992563200,3,386,3.8987341772151898

Stan Mills (Dean Stockwell) has a close encounter that compels him to champion those other encounteries that have nowhere to turn to. Years later Bob Wilson (Eric Roberts) decides to take his family out hiking in a deserted area that he knew as a kid. It is not as if a weird gas station pump jockey did not warn him. Yep you guessed it. And the mysteries men come back to clean up any evidence later to clean up WHITNESSES.

Will the family turn to Stan Mills for protection?
If so can he really help?

Finally an insightful movie on the real deal on the men in black. The acting is made for t.v. movie, but the story line will keep your attention. There are not that many MIB movie out there-outside of the Hollywood franchise, so this one is one to watch-even though it was filmed in 1998-dated. However I would still recommended it. Not a scary movie for preteen & up. Young kids might get scared from some of the scenes. Are you listening Scully & Molder?;)",1376006400,2,596,4.378378378378378
8018134,4,B0001Y4M2C,This was an entertaining movie about men in black and alien abductions. Worth watching. A good entertaining SCI FI movie.,1371686400,,121,5.1
8018135,3,B0001Y4M2C,"This being a 1997 TV movie, THE SHADOW MEN is fullscreen, and was likely an attempt to cash-in on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-X-Files/dp/B000BOH986/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The X-Files</a>, which was very hot at the time.

From the film's title, one may surmise that the focus is less on aliens than on the ""men in black"" -- aka MIBs -- super-secret government men who cover up alien encounters. And that's true, up to a point ...

(When most people hear ""men in black,"" they likely recall the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-In-Black/dp/B00177YA1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men In Black</a>&nbsp;film series. However, the best portrayal of an MIB was by actor Michael McKean, in the ""Dreamland"" episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-X-Files/dp/B000BOH986/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The X-Files</a>. A role he later reprises in the episodes ""Jump the Shark"" and ""Three of a Kind."")

THE SHADOW MEN begins with an ordinary American family, going hiking in Nevada. On their return trip to California, along an empty desert road, they encounter a saucer-shaped light in the sky. They get scared, try to outrun it ... and then they wake up in the car -- and it's three hours later! Yet they have no memories of what happened. They assume they must have fallen asleep.

They report the incident to the Air Force -- and that's when the MIBs show up. Warning them to not tell anyone what happened.

This is where the film begins to fall apart. Instead of creepy, conspiratorial types, as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-X-Files/dp/B000BOH986/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The X-Files</a>, these MIBs are so robotic they appear almost comical. So is this film meant to be a comedy? Yet the rest of the film and characters are played straight, for scares and suspense.

The family eventually discovers that their son's video recorder was playing during their blackout, and recorded gray aliens removing them from the car. They realize they've been abducted! Dad contacts a UFO conspiracy author for help.

The MIBs continue harassing the family, and eventually try to kill them and recover the videotape.

SPOILER ....

These MIBs turn out to be alien hybrids. At one point, hordes of them attack the house in which the family is hiding out. The family blast away at them with guns, causing the MIBs to ""bleed"" white foam, yet they keep attacking, undead, like zombies. It's all very silly -- NOT scary, creepy, or suspenseful.

Such silliness degrades THE SHADOW MEN from 3 stars to 2, but the film also stars&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twin-Peaks/dp/B000UX6THK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twin Peaks</a>'s Sherilyn Fenn. I'm a sucker for anything starring a former cast member from that show, so I'll overlook THE SHADOW MEN's silly third act.",1366329600,2,2983,6.014150943396227
