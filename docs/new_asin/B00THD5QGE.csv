8701758,5,B00THD5QGE,"When this CD/DVD set arrived in my mailbox, I made myself some chocolate-covered shortbread fiddle cookies, set up the LCD projector, and had myself a private viewing party. I knew it would be good--really good--and it didn't disappoint.

Dan captures the sound and soul of musicians who've gone before, weaves in a creative bit of something that I can only describe as ""Gellert,"" and comes up with unique surprises that delight both my mind and my ear.

For anyone who has any interest in old-time music at all -- this is a must-have, must-listen-over-and-over-and-over kind of album.",1477094400,,585,5.020618556701031
8701759,5,B00THD5QGE,"This is the next best thing to having Dan Gellert come into your home and play for you.  (And don't we wish that were possible.)  Gellert is a master of old-time music, and thanks to this wonderful CD/DVD. we can enjoy and learn from him whenever we like.",1476662400,,255,4.291666666666667
8701760,5,B00THD5QGE,"Man oh man oh man...if you haven't experienced Dan Gellert, then you must buy this DVD/CD!!!!  And if you do know Dan Gellert...well. I'll bet you've already purchased this one...but, again, if you're not familiar, then immediately stop listening to that hipster old-time crap like Old Crow Medicine Show and dip your toes in the waters of some of the most down to earth, nasty funky old-time fiddle and banjo music you've ever experienced...but filtered through West Africa, Jamaica, Haiti and into America...this is not watered down music, it is fierce and full of funk, the intersection of African rhythm and Euro/American melody.  Liner notes by Ry Cooder??  I guess game recognizes game...bottom line, you'll want this DVD/CD in your collection...but buckle those seatbelts before you do, it's gonna be a funky ride!",1471996800,,821,5.157894736842105
8701761,5,B00THD5QGE,Dan Gellert is a genius & so is David Bragger - perfect combination - I own this DVD & it is amazing!,1463961600,,101,3.6363636363636362
8701762,5,B00THD5QGE,"Dan Gellert is the bluesiest, funkiest, most soulfully raw practitioner of old-time blues music on the fiddle, banjo and voice there is. PERIOD. This set is a national musical treasure. If more people heard this, the world would be a better place. Here's the catch, you can watch him play everything on the DVD that's included. After hearing about Gellert's cult status and Ry Cooder's affinity for him, I had to look into it. Gellert is Son House, Robert Johnson, Bill Monroe, James Brown and Uncle Dave Macon rolled up into one! Thank you Old-Time Tiki Parlour for being brave enough to bring this ""real music"" into a world saturated in commercial waste. This is the release of the ages. Get it along with anything this label puts out!",1459728000,,737,4.72093023255814
8701763,5,B00THD5QGE,A treasure for Old-Time music fans from an important contemporary performer.,1433548800,,76,6.0
8701764,5,B00THD5QGE,"Dan Gellert is one of the greatest living treasures in traditional American music. Not at all surprised that there's a Ry Cooder quote! This DVD & CD set puts you directly in front of a monster musician as he hypnotizes you with his signature funk and serpentine syncopations. Dan rarely records. Most of his catalog is out of print, until now. The Old-Time Tiki Parlour has provided the world with more than just a glimpse of this cult legend. They have literally served one of the greatest old-time masters on two golden platters! One for the eyes and one for the ears! I know who deserves the next Grammy.",1430179200,2,608,4.587155963302752
8701765,5,B00THD5QGE,"It's hard to calculate Dan Gellert's influence on the ongoing renaissance that seems to be taking place within the world of old-time stringband. He's been a constant presence on the scene for decades, and yet on records he's a phantom -- with just a handful of compilation tracks, a pair of Merimac cassettes, and an out-of-print CD (""Waitin' on the Break of Day"") as his recorded legacy. But old-time music isn't really about recordings, is it? It's a social, visceral, in-person kinda thing, and it's there that Dan has made his mark, inspiring generations of pickers with his canny knack for imparting both traditional and personal eccentricity in equal measure. Lots of folks look up to this guy.

But influential doesn't always mean accessible, and it will take a few listens to calibrate your ears to Dan's sensibilities. This isn't the sort of pretty, singer-songwriter-inflected strain of old-time music that seems to reach more people these days. What Dan does is rugged, earthy, and intense...and yet, sublimely musical and moving. His voice is raw and worn, his fiddle playing bluesy and largely limited to the instrument's mid-range. On both gut- and steel-stringed banjos he's got a great rhythmic thump, but also doesn't shy away from quirks and imperfections. He heard the music's masters and looked past the notes, into the personal idiosyncrasies that informed the notes, and made that his stomping ground.

We've got 19 tracks here, a great mix of standard tunes and songs (""Fall on My Knees,"" ""Raleigh and Spencer,"" ""Ruben's Train,"" ""The Cuckoo"") and lesser-known material. The fidelity is clear without being fussy, and Dan is in fine, fine form. There's also a DVD of the performance, which is invaluable for students of the music who can't make it out to Ohio to sit on Gellert's porch. The project is entirely solo, which seems to be his context of choice these days, and it makes sense -- who could follow this guy? He drops beats, repeats phrases, varies tempos, etc., all with maximum emotional impact.

If you're new to old-time music, you might need to give this one some time, but the unbridled soul of the music will grow on you over time...you just gotta let it in.

Let's hope we're not waiting another ten years for a new record from this guy...",1426723200,2,2278,4.893782383419689
