8323445,3,B000AABL5S,"The first thing I want to put in this review is to complain the cover of this DVD. That is not an aircraft carrier, ok? That makes me feel the making of this DVD not professional.

The content is fine with me. It is more about the evolution of aircraft carriers. The participation in Pacific War shares about half of the running time. I don't blame this since Pacific War is the grand stage for carriers, and the dominant power of battleships is replaced by carriers then. Instead, I think this part deserves.

For those who are specifically interested in modern aircraft carriers, they will feel disappointed since it shares less than 10 minutes. THC has this tendency that the title is put in a broad sense but the content is rather focused on another spot, especially for technology-oriented film. This usually misleads the customers and unfortunately this piece is just the case. Other examples includes Radar, Computer, ......and so on.

Make sure what this film really contents before you buy it.",1169683200,16,1002,4.813953488372093
8323446,4,B000AABL5S,"I enjoyed the History Channel's subject on the origins of the aircraft carriers up to the present day.  It was an eye opener also that some of the innovations of the modern US aircraft carriers were designed by the British.  However, I noticed that the jeep carriers of World War 2 were not included and that although the Forrestal class was discussed at lenght, the Kitty Hawk and JFK class of aircraft carriers were not part of subject.  The Enterprise is a class of its own and the Nimitz class ships were very detailed.  I would have preferred though that the latest and most modern and recently commissioned Ronald Reagan included in the film.  The LHAs and LHDs were also not brought out when one can see that they resemble the carriers, they still are by and large aircraft carriers.  Otherwise, the documentary was very good and I look forward to other films about modern ships not only of the US but also with the former Soviet Union.",1141430400,16,943,4.583333333333333
