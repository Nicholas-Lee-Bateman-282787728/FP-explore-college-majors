1785426,4,B00006LPDW,"This collection of classic low budget B-movie gore is a real flash from the past, they just don't make them like this anymore.  These are the 3rd or forth run movies that I used to watch at the Saturday Night Horror Movie fests at our local Drive-Inns.  The quality of video transfer isn't the greatest, but you've got to consider that the film source must have not been kept in the most ideal of storage conditions in the Philippines for twenty or thirty years, but I think of movies from the golden age of the Drive-Inn Theatres like most guys my age think of 60s muscle cars, all of them no matter what kind or type should be restored and preserved.",1238544000,,652,4.380165289256198

1785428,4,B00006LPDW,"""Drinking your own blood is the paradigm of recycling."" - Gary `Head Injury' Busey ""I'm with Busey"" (2003)

Producer/Distributor extraordinaire Sam Sherman and Image Entertainment have teamed up to present The Blood Island Vacation package, an awesoma DVD set of four Filipino produced, hemoglobin drenched, drive-in classics at one heck of a nice price...here's what you get...

Brides of Blood (1968)

Mad Doctor of Blood Island (1968)

Produced and directed by Eddie Romero (Brides of Blood, Beast of the Yellow Night, Beast of Blood), the film stars John Ashley (High School Caesar, Beach Blanket Bingo, Beast of Blood) and Angelique Pettyjohn (""Get Smart"", Clambake).  Ashley plays a scientist (not the same one from Brides of Blood), who visits Blood Island and finds himself caught up in some nasty business as a deranged scientist on the island is performing hideous experiments involving green blood.  Extras include a short audio commentary track featuring distributor Sam Sherman, an interview with director Eddie Romero, an original Mad Doctor of Blood Island `green blood' prologue bit, a ""House of Terror"" live horror show promo, a still gallery, liner notes by Jim Arena, a Mad Doctor of Blood Island essay by Christopher William Koenig, and a trailer for this film, along with ones for Brides of Blood (1968), Beast of Blood (1971), Brain of Blood (1972), Blood of the Vampires (1971), The Blood Drinkers (1966), and Raiders of the Living Dead (1986).

Beast of Blood (1972)

Produced, co-written, and directed by Eddie Romero (Mad Doctor of Blood Island, Brides of Blood, Beast of the Yellow Night), the film features John Ashley (High School Caesar, Muscle Beach Party, Hell On Wheels) and Celeste Yarnall (The Face of Eve, The Velvet Vampire).  Ashley reprises his role from Mad Doctor of Blood Island returning to the island to discover the evil that had thought been destroyed is still thriving.  Extras included are as follows; a short audio commentary track featuring distributor Sam Sherman, an interview with director Eddie Romero, an interview w/ Celeste Yarnell conducted by Sam Sherman, a `lost' opening sequence, a ""House of Terror"" live horror show promo, a still gallery, liner notes by Jim Arena, a Beast of Blood essay by Christopher William Koenig, and a trailer for this film, along with ones for Brides of Blood (1968), Mad Doctor of Blood Island (1968), Brain of Blood (1972), Blood of the Vampires (1971), The Blood Drinkers (1966), Raiders of the Living Dead (1986), and Horror of the Blood Monster (1970).

Brain of Blood (1972)

Co-produced and directed by Al Adamson, the film features Kent Taylor (Brides of Blood, Satan's Sadists), Grant Williams (The Incredible Shrinking Man, The Monolith Monsters), the colossal (7'4"") John Bloom (Dracula vs. Frankenstein, Bachelor Party), Regina Carrol (Blood of Ghastly Horror, Doctor Dracula), Vicki Volante (Hell's Bloody Devils, Horror of the Blood Monsters), Reed Hadley (The St. Valentine's Day Massacre), and the diminutive (2'11) Angelo Rossitto (Mesa of Lost Women, Invasion of the Saucer Men, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome), this feature has nothing in terms of relation to the three other films in this set other than the fact they were all distributed by Sam Sherman through his Independent-International Pictures, Inc. film company.  This film involves a sickly Middle Eastern dictator arranging to have his brain transplanted to another body, and a certain amount of wackiness ensues... extras included are as follows; a short audio commentary track featuring distributor Sam Sherman, an interview with director Eddie Romero, an interview with Beverly Powers, a ""House of Terror"" live horror show promo, a Blood Island still gallery, liner notes by Jim Arena, and a trailer for this film, along with ones for Brides of Blood (1968), Mad Doctor of Blood Island (1968), Beast of Blood (1971), Blood of the Vampires (1971), The Blood Drinkers (1966), Raiders of the Living Dead (1986), and Horror of the Blood Monster (1970).

As far as the picture quality on the four DVDs, they're all in full screen (1.33:1) aspect ratio and all look very decent.  There are some obvious age elements (white specking, the occasional vertical line), but the colors are bright and sharp, and the overall quality is superior to any VHS copies of the films you may seen in the past.  Also, each has audio presented in Dolby Digital mono audio, which also comes through well.  As far as the actual films go, I'd rank Brides of Blood and Mad Doctor of Blood Island among the best here, with Beast of Blood following a close 2nd, while Brain of Blood comes in a very distant 3rd.  One last note, distributor Sam Sherman does provide audio commentaries on each of the DVDs, but they're not so much specific to the film rather than to an overall history of the films and his experiences, and they don't tend to run the length of the films.

1785429,3,B00006LPDW,"Presented for your viewing displeasure is Brain of Blood (1972), yet another steaming, brown nugget of excremental joy from Al Adamson, that renown purveyor of fine cinematic scuzz, the same individual who inflicted such atrocities as Horror of the Blood Monsters (1970), Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971), I Spit on Your Corpse! (1974), and Blazing Stewardesses (1975) upon unsuspecting drive-in movie patrons back in the day.  Co-produced and directed by Adamson, the film features Kent Taylor (Brides of Blood, Satan's Sadists), Grant Williams (The Incredible Shrinking Man, The Monolith Monsters), the colossal (7'4"") John Bloom (Dracula vs. Frankenstein, Bachelor Party), Regina Carrol (Blood of Ghastly Horror, Doctor Dracula), Vicki Volante (Hell's Bloody Devils, Horror of the Blood Monsters), Reed Hadley (The St. Valentine's Day Massacre), and the diminutive (2'11) Angelo Rossitto (Mesa of Lost Women, Invasion of the Saucer Men, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome), probably best known for his role as Angeleno from the classic Tod Browning horror feature Freaks (1932).

The film begins with an establishing shot of the Taj Mahal, and we learn the leader, named Abdul Amir (Hadley), of some Middle Eastern country is dying (seems the `uranium' treatments have failed).  Amir, not wanting to go out like that, makes plans with his physician Dr. Robert Nigserian (Williams) and his girlfriend Tracey (Carrol) that after his death, his corpse is to be secretly taken to America where another doctor by the name of Lloyd Trenton (Taylor) will surgically remove his brain and transplant it into a suitable host body.  Once this is done, Amir's new body will undergo plastic surgery to make it look more like the Amir of old, after which he will then return and re-assume control of his country.  Well, Amir does croak, and his body is wrapped in tin foil making him look much like a giant Jiffy Pop bag of popcorn.  He's flown to the states and Dr. Trent, with the help of his dwarf assistant Dorro (Rossitto), a sadistic little schmuck, and Nigserian, perform the brain-ectomy.  Things seem to be going according to plan until Dr. Trent's hulking, simple-minded, facially disfigured assistant Gor (Bloom) returns with a damaged host body, forcing Dr. Trent to improvise (due to the fact brains, outside of the body, only last so long), and by `improvise' I mean he puts Amir's brain into Gor's body, the intent being to transfer Amir's brain at a later date into a more suitable host body.  The operation's a success, but, as you might imagine, Amir isn't too pleased with his new digs when he awakens...not only that, but complications set in as a sinister plot against Amir is uncovered.  From here the story quickly devolves as a number of various elements are thrown in, including, but not limited to, the escape of a woman (Volante) Dr. Trenton kept in his dungeon beneath his laboratory for the purposes of drawing blood for his experiments.  Mystery!  Intrigue!  Drama!  It's all here (sort of), if you're willing to wade through the often unintelligible mire that comprises most of the film...

If you've ever experienced an Al Adamson film, then you'll know they rarely make sense for more than ten minutes at a time given Al's tendency to present various plot points and characters with little or no proper introduction.  One minute you're with a couple of familiar characters and the next you're watching characters you've never met, doing things that seem to have no discernable relation to the story as presented.  An example of this is near the beginning as we see Gor stalking a cat burglar.  We later learn he was out looking for a suitable donor body, under Trenton's command, for Amir's body, but there was never any set up for this, so it seemed completely odd and unconnected at the time.  Another example was during a flashback when we witnessed how Gor's face got to be the way it was (an unfortunate incident with some battery acid).  There really was little point in detailing this, other than an opportunity to show someone getting battery acid dumped on his face.  While Brain of Blood is confusing, it actually wasn't as bad as some of Adamson's other films as I was able to follow a good deal of the story, what of it there was...essentially the movie shoots its plot wad early on, and the rest is pretty much downhill from there (the last fifteen minutes or so are of people chasing each other around like a bunch of idiots in California's Topanga Canyon).  What's sad is the core idea, a sickly Middle Eastern despot trying to cheat death by means of a brain transplant, had a lot of promise, but in trying to create a viable story around the concept, the writers failed miserably.  I did learn a number of things from this film, including the following;

1. The human brain, when removed from the cranium and put into a bowl, looks a lot like three cow brains mashed together.

2. Acting abilities are inconsequential when you're married to the director (I'm talking about Ms. Carrol here).

3. There seems to be an unwritten law that mad scientists must employ physically odd assistants, be it sadistic dwarfs or facially disfigured, simple-minded giants (or both, as is the case here).

4. I wouldn't have thought there a worse actor than Ms. Carrol, that was until I saw Angelo Rossitto in this film.

5. Vicki Volante was a fabulous babe (I have a thing for women with black hair).

6. Corpses can be kept fresh in tin foil.

7. The human head is full of red paint.

8. Having a dwarf for an assistant may seem cool, that is unless they're so short that they can barely reach anything above three and a half feet in height.

9. Having a dungeon underneath your laboratory comes in real handy, especially when you need a place to discard your brainless cadavers.

10. White Nehru suits were considered fashionable at some point in the past.

There are some positive aspects to this feature...I thought the laboratory was made up well, with lots of realistic electronic type gizmos.  It wasn't anything overly elaborate, but it worked well enough for this film.  The brain removal bit looked phony, but kinda cool, nonetheless.  There was an exciting, yet pointless, car chase sequence included, one that ended in a spectacular crash...what was so odd about this was there were four guys in a station wagon being chased by one guy in a sedan.  Instead of stopping and all four guys getting out and pounding on the one guy chasing them, they allowed themselves to be pursued and eventually forced off a cliff...idiots...also, I dig the DVD cover art.  All in all there is some fun to be had here, especially if you love rotten drive-in features from the 1970s, but if you're looking for something a bit more substantial, keep on looking...

The restored picture, presented in fullscreen (1.33:1) format, on this Image Entertainment release looks very good.  It does show signs of aging (some lines, white specking, etc.).  The Dolby Digital mono audio comes through very well.  As far as extras included, there's a short audio commentary track featuring distributor Sam Sherman, an interview with director Eddie Romero, an interview with Beverly Powers, a ""House of Terror"" live horror show promo, a Blood Island still gallery, liner notes by Jim Arena, and a trailer for this film, along with ones for Brides of Blood (1968), Mad Doctor of Blood Island (1968), Beast of Blood (1971), Blood of the Vampires (1971), The Blood Drinkers (1966), Raiders of the Living Dead (1986), and Horror of the Blood Monster (1970).  It should be noted that some of the extras, specifically the interviews with Eddie Romero and Beverly Powers, featured here do not related to this movie, but to movies from the `Blood Island' trilogy of films, and were just thrown on here to flesh out the release.

By the way, if you're interesting in getting this DVD release, I'd suggest trying to find the four DVD set titled The Blood Island Vacation, released by Image Entertainment, which includes the following...Brides of Blood (1968), Mad Doctor of Blood Island (1968), Beast of Blood (1971), and Brain of Blood (1972).  It appears significantly less expensive than buying the titles separately.",1149638400,10,8218,4.892573900504686
1785430,5,B00006LPDW,"I first saw this movie back in 1978 on a little b+w television on the late night horror film (hosted by Detroit/Toledo icon ""The Ghoul""). Over the years all I could remember of the movie was image of the evil dwarf drawing blood from the female victims chained up in the baesment...
Well, I finaly figured out that ""Brain of Blood"" was that movie which I ordered and watched last night.
What a treat, this is standard but classic early 70's blood schlock.
Brain of Blood has plenty of enjoyable/expected cliches...
a mad doctor, evil dwarf, big dumb oaf, busty blond, a twisted political plot, brain transplants, plastic ray guns, rubber spiders, and lots of thick, red movie blood.
The story is silly, but there's enough of a storyline to require the viewer to pay attention in order to follow it.
Other than the blood which may unsettle the very squeamish the movie is fine for family viewing (PG).  There's no sex (real or implied) and no foul language (although some of the trailers may show a brief flash of nudity).
Plenty of good disc extras make this package all the sweeter.",1071187200,10,1083,4.640625
1785431,4,B00006LPDW,"This is another in a long line of films made by the late great Al Adamson. The story is about a scientist who transplants the brain of a dying leader of a foreign country into the body of his hulking mentally retarded helper. You get a lot of gory brain surgery footage and a really mixed up plot involving government cover up's, sadism, spies, torture, and chained women. The cast is very good it includes Kent Taylor, Regina Carroll (Al's Wife), John Bloom and Grant Williams.
I happen to like Adamson's films a lot and this is really no better or worse than any of them. If you like verteran actors playing monsters and dress up, you'll like this film.",1043712000,5,655,4.466666666666667

7971758,4,B00006LPDW,"What a dilemma, a poor old geezer is dying but he wants to live but first he has to die so they can transplant his brain into some poor sap's healthy body.  Things do not end well for all concerned.

Before you can say egad, the poor dead sap in wrapped in tinfoil like a baked potato and shipped to a secret lab out in the middle of nowhere, where a not so comely imp (Angelo Rossitto) bedevils everyone as he assists the mad doctor with his ""dangerous, even illegal operation.""  It would have been nice had they a healthy young nubile body on hand to switch brains with but alas, it was not to be and they had to improvise.  (By brain switch I mean one of them gets tossed out, they were only ever concerned with the one brain belonging to Amir, the benevolent ruler of Kalid.)

This is a sad twisted tale of madness and deceit involving a dungeon littered with people no one thought were worth transplanting a brain into.  There are double crosses, a fabulous conspiracy, and a duplicitous faux blonde.  What more could you want?  Yes, certainly, a better script would rank high on a list of must haves, not to mention a cast with better credentials.  To say this is not a stellar production might be downplaying the depths of rigor involved.  It is unadulterated crap.  It's also freakishly fun and not a little silly.  I enjoyed it because it is utterly stupid.",1424217600,5,1366,4.42
7971759,5,B00006LPDW,Pretty good movie. Buy it because this is the only way you'll ever see it!,1422144000,,74,4.0
7971760,3,B00006LPDW,"Late director Al Adamson strikes again with one of his cheap knock-off films of the early 70's (in this case 1971). Kent Taylor is a well-meaning mad doctor who has little guy Angelo Rossitto torture chained-up females in his basement with a hypodermic needle, while he performs an illegal brain transplant on a world political leader, accidentally causing the patient to become a bloodthirsty monster. Hard to believe this was rated GP (later changed to PG) when originally released, but this is nothing special because Adamson pads out the film with enough filler to make a mattress. Not a good film by any stretch of the imagination, but worth a look for fans of bad films.",1414627200,3,676,4.836206896551724
7971761,1,B00006LPDW,"Not in the same class as the other ""Blood"" films. Poor acting,terrible makeup and effects. Just bad all around. Give this one a pass.",1408233600,,133,4.583333333333333
7971762,5,B00006LPDW,"Grant (""Brain of Colonel Barham"") Williams co-stars with Kent Taylor.

7971763,4,B00006LPDW,basically it is a story of a dead middle eastern ruler who is flown to america and brought back to life but with no donor body then the doctor looks to his aide who is backward  when he wakes and sees the disfigerment of his face he then goes on a killing spree i won't spoil the end for you myself i throughly enjoyed this film i would reccomend it to anyone who likes or enjoys these films  wayne shepherd,1366934400,,407,4.075
