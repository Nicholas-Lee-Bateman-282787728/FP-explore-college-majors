no matter how many times I tried to make it work.
The disc would not play. Unless you want to waste
your money. I do not recommend this movie.",1526947200,,191,4.1891891891891895
8592058,5,B00DCZZRNA,This is a good selection of stag films made when women looked natural not like the plastic fake boob's of today the highlight of this film is the inclusion of the film smart Aleck which stars the burlesque star candy Barr who was a big star in her day so seeing the only stag film she ever did makes this film well worth buying,1477440000,4,327,4.125
8592059,4,B00DCZZRNA,"I graduated from High School in June, 1968, i enlisted in the Air Force, and was inducted in August, '68 - while i was in H.S., i would pick myself up and travel into Manhattan and wander around 42nd St., walking in and out of the adult book stores on the ""Strip"", that's what 42nd was called, from Broadway to 9th Avenue.  The bookstores, and the Adult movie theatres were where a teenager really got his/her education.
I made friends with the 'older' folk who worked in that area.  i was allowed to just hang around the bookstores, doing odd jobs like restacking paperback books, emptying out the video machines, etc.  Also, some of the ""working girls"" and i got to be friends, and we would go out and have lunch together .  The documentary, HISTORY OF THE BLUE MOVIE brought back a lot of memories from the late '60's.  Of course, some of what the film leaves out is what went on behind the scenes. But it was still a decent film.",1446336000,4,933,4.369942196531792
