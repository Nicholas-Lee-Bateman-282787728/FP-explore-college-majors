8291751,1,B001D5C1MQ,"The idea is pretty cool, but the execution is really a shame. Betwin the ""Slasher's Trivia""'s questions, wich are not too bad but not enough (10 questions may be), you are subjected to stupids and bad acted scnes with not an once of originality or talent. Even if you're a fan of T&A, wich is the only thing this piece of junk have to offer, you better go elsewhere, where girls looks hotter. If you're a girl and if you like Geek's style guys, you'll find plenty of specimens in there. Do your own trivia at home with friends and use your money for more beer, that's my advice. If you're ugly and stupid, so do like these guys, use your money to make your own crappy movie, so you'll be able to pretend to make it out with some fat bimbos copycats.",1238889600,,749,4.244755244755245
8291752,1,B001D5C1MQ,"I'm a huge horror buff and thought this was going to be a lot of fun.  Oh my lord, THIS IS B-A-D.  If you want to ""choose your own adventure go elsewhere.  It's the same thing over and over, and the questions are the same over and over.  The story is terrible. The lead actor is terrible.  You are better off buying a DVD that is a real campy horror movie.  I could go on for days, but you should be shopping elsewhere.",1228262400,2,419,3.9879518072289155
8291753,5,B001D5C1MQ,"Saw this opening night at the Halo 8 space in Hollywood, and boy was I in for a treat. I initially went to support my friends (most of the girls in the flick) and didn't have especially high expectation, but it was hilarious and fabulous. Sort of like a dirty, gorey ""choose your own adventure"" book for deviant adults. Plus, the trivia is the shizz.",1226880000,,350,4.4
8291754,5,B001D5C1MQ,"I bought this DVD Game with a gift certificate at amazon.com. Of course, with a name like Slumber Party Slaughterhouse I really had very low expectations when I put it in my DVD player.

The premise is simple: Paul Tard gets uninvited to a graduation party with hookers by his buddies so that his girlfriend can have his hooker. He decides to deal with the pain of finding out his girlfriend is cheating on him with his friends and being uninvited from the party by enjoying a little internet porn on his laptop in the bath tub. OK.. yeah, yeah, you know where this is going - the laptop falls into the tub, fries him, he dies and he is visited by a heavenly angel and an evil angel and is given the choice to forgive his transgressors and go to heaven or seek revenge and go to hell. You, the viewer, make this decision. of course, you know the game has got to be more fun if you select revenge, so I did. The devil angel allows Paul to possess each of the hookers to kill his friend and then bring his friend back from the dead to kill the hooker but only IF you get the slasher trivia question correct.

So, is it worth the purchase price? YES!! The actresses are all incredibly hot and believe it or not do a good job with the characters. Each of the kill scenes is violent and gory and fun. One scene involves two hookers, three nerds, a guy in a chicken suit, and a guy in a clown suit. Oh yeah.. this movie/DVD game is just that much fun.

If you are looking for good clean intelligent fun - stay away from this DVD. However, if you are looking for hot naked scream queens and lots of blood, guts, and gore in a simple plot with a simple premise - then this DVD is a must have!",1225584000,8,1684,4.143730886850153
