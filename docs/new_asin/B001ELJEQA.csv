3555633,5,B001ELJEQA,How could I not love the stories about these incredible creatures. My heart breaks when anything happens to one of them. The Lowry Park Zoo that is near to me has a group of these little cuties. I never spend less than 30 minutes watching these lovable little animals. They have an adopt an animal program that helps support the animals at our zoo. I'm hoping soon I will save enough money up to adopt one of these little guys.,1271635200,2,427,4.35
3555634,1,B001ELJEQA,"I tried playing this on my six year old personal DVD player.  Nothing.  I have a laptop with Vista and it won't play on my Windows Media Center at all either.  I do have Quickplay, but the images which are clear, but jumpy sort of like a slide show.  The audio is jumpy and barely intelligible and not worthy of watching.  I would return it to Amazon, but I bought it over a month ago and I don't have a receipt.  If anyone can tell me how to play this darn DVD-R video disk, PLEASE inform me!!",1251331200,,494,4.041237113402062
3555635,3,B001ELJEQA,"I love every episode of meerkat manor but Stockard Channing stinks.  The show themselves featuring the meerkats are informing as to the new groups and family members.  If you can get by the dol-drum voice of the narration, I found it informative but not as attention getting as the last three seasons.  Let us hope season five will be better.",1246924800,2,342,4.666666666666667
3555636,5,B001ELJEQA,This is well worth the money!  They are back to a good narator who's precence does not overwhelm the Meerkats (Whoopie Goldberg in the disappointing movie version)  I'm looking forward to the next season!!!! JZ,1234656000,3,210,4.9714285714285715
3555637,4,B001ELJEQA,"It's fitting that Season 4 (considering how Season 3 ended) sort of rebrands itself as ""The Next Generation,"" because it is really both metaphorically and literally a new start--so that means if you haven't seen previous seasons, you can still follow the action and start here, though I would highly recommend the other seasons.  Meerkat Manor is, was, and continues to be a one-of-a-kind show.

This season, the narrator is Stockard Channing, and while she is adequate, I prefer Sean Astin's narration (Seasons 1-3).  This season is not as quite as heightened (or frankly, powerful--as Seasons 3 and 2) but it is a strong addition to the canon.  On one hand, viewers who felt a little...turned off...by how depressing and difficult it sometimes was to watch previous seasons, can find that the mood is lighter here overall (though darker moments abound.)  On the other hand, I found the various episodes uneven--some strong, some weaker--as a whole though, it adds up to a good season.  There are both new and familiar faces that come to the forefront: Sophie, Rocket Dog, Wilson, and Maybeline being the most interesting and endearing IMO.

At its best, it's still one of my favorite shows on TV (I watch a variety of shows; this is the only ""nature/animal"" show I watch.)  But for various reasons, the level of connection and involvement I felt was not as strong with these new ""stars"" than the meerkats of past seasons.  It should be kept in mind that it took three seasons to fully bring out the full power and arc of the series and ""characters"" (meerkats) of the past.  I feel like this is more of a first act, than the more exciting second or third act (so to speak) of the story of these meerkats, but it's a good place to start fresh and remains a singular ""animal"" documentary that rivals the best fiction narratives in terms of its depth, character, plot--it's really amazing what extraordinary ""humans"" these ""animals"" can be.

One final note for parents:  this show is very tastefully done and fairly reserved compared to other nature/animal shows, but nature can be cruel, so you may want to decide for yourself if it is appropriate for your whole family.  If you're curious about the ratings, since the dvd is listed as unrated, the majority of the season was rated TV-G, but the last four episodes they changed the rating to TV-PG.

The DVD versions of the television show are the same content as they air on Animal Planet and digital downloads and are good image/audio transfers to DVD (if you are concerned about that) but not having the direct early release copy of this dvd I can't say for sure what extras if any may be part of the set.  Traditionally, it is pretty much just the episodes.  Though, it would not surprise me if the informative and fascinating special, ""The Science of Meerkats"" was included as a bonus feature.",1232668800,14,2847,4.732793522267206

3555648,5,B001ELJEQA,This is like a reality show of Meerkat life.  It shows the rise and fall of meerkat groups.  It's always interesting.,1391817600,,117,4.523809523809524
3555649,4,B001ELJEQA,"This soap-opera-esk look into the fascinating lives of meerkats is not only educational, but very entertaining. love to watch it with family",1390953600,,140,5.409090909090909
3555650,5,B001ELJEQA,I've seen this series many times.  The sad part is that they stopped after 4 seasons.  These little creatures are so interesting and the way this is presented it gives the view the rare opportunity to follow a group of animals from birth to death.,1390262400,,247,4.466666666666667
3555651,5,B001ELJEQA,"I have always loved this show. I watched it on 'regular' TV and watched the families grow and change. I somehow missed more series after Flower died, and was thrilled to see it on Prime. It's very entertaining, educational and makes me feel good when I watch it. What's not to love?",1389830400,,282,4.4423076923076925
3555652,5,B001ELJEQA,"A reality shows thats actually real, Meerkat Manor puts to shame all of those pseudo-survival, celeb-sensationalized series that don't deserve to be called reality...actually, Meerkat Manor needs no such comparison, and can easily stand on its own merit. Despite the series having ended years ago, I find myself still thinking about Flower and her extended family, Im grateful to be able to watch this show now from start to finish, and to see all of our beloved meerkats live again.

By the series second half, were all familiar with the research project, and don't need the five-minute reminder which allows for more story in each episode; also the TV rating/disclaimer gets upped from G to PG allowing for a truly uncensored look at the very intimate and very real lives of these amazing creatures who have found their way into our hearts from the beginning. I always cry pretty much all through season 3 when we lost so many of them from Carlos, to Flowers selfless sacrifice, to (Wilson and) Mozarts tragic romance. Though I followed the series into its final season initially, I don't remember having seen the very last episode (season 4) when it originally aired, and finally did in re-runs; Rocket Dogs survival and strength of leadership was mind-blowing.

So intriguing is how vastly different meerkat society is from our own and how their daily life-and-death struggles make so many of our own human problems seem small. By the same token, however, despite all our advances, we are still living in tough times and it often makes me wonder if we are really any different or any better off than they are, which is why we the viewers can so easily relate to their everyday lives. Either way you look at it, you will be moved by and truly come to care about the Whiskers and all of the meerkat families.

I cant think of anything negative to say about Meerkat Manor, except that I wish it had gone on longer than just four seasons, as Im sure the Aztecs, Commandos, Lazuli, Zappa, and of course, the Whiskers are still living their lives to this day, and I would have loved have seen what happened next.

Rocket Dog, Mitch, Sophie, Axel, Wilson, Nikita, Houdini, Maybelline, Zaphod...where are you now?",1389657600,,2209,4.774869109947644

3555656,5,B001ELJEQA,"This show is adorable, and SO addicting. You really get caught up in the lives of those furry bundles of joy.

3555658,5,B001ELJEQA,"Not everyone is going to like the Meerkat Manor series, but anyone who is even slightly an animal person will get hooked.  Who knew these little guys had such distinct personalities?  And they truly show us what's involved in being part of a family and the hard work and endurance it takes along the way.  Start at the begin, give them a chance, and ""The Whiskers"" family and their rival clans at Meerkat Manor will (most likely) win you and your family over.",1382400000,,459,4.506024096385542

3555665,5,B001ELJEQA,"I chose a 5 star rating because this is a very cute show. It tells the tail/tale (pun intended) of a family of meerkat's and their daily life and death struggles. It's almost like a meerkat soap opera! You become so engrossed with the characters and what happens to them that you can't stop watching! Informative and entertaining, Sean Astin does such a remarkable job of narrating the stories,I couldn't imagine anyone else doing it, but Stockdard Channing comes in a close second.",1372204800,,482,4.819277108433735

3555673,5,B001ELJEQA,"I watched all the televised shows so I knew what I was getting.  In my opinion all households should add this to their video library especially if they have children of any age.  Some very sad places due to death of a Meerkat, kleenex time for sure.

3555674,1,B001ELJEQA,"I ordered seasons one, three and four. They were delivered either earlier or on the promised date.  I have not been able to see any of them because they were region 1 discs and it is obvious that I live in region 4.  So no more dvd orders from me.",1348876800,,247,3.92
3555675,3,B001ELJEQA,"My wife and I became addicted to Merkat Manor on DVD. Season four, however, leaves us both taken aback. Stockard Channing's narration gets the job done, I suppose, albeit a bit mumbly at times. What really turns us off, however, is the apparent dumbing-down of the writing. It is cutesy, sugar-coated and sappy to the point of making us groan. The tone of the writing and narration is a complete disconnect from the prevoius three seasons, to it's detriment. On another point, episodes in prior seasons each began with a brief recap of the prior episode's events. This is understandable, given the intervals of the episodes as originally aired. Season four, however, additionally subscribes to the general TV trend to accomodate increasingly attention-deficit viewers. Not only do we get the episode recap at the beginning, now after what was originally each commercial break (fade-to-black) we have to come right back with a recap of what the viewer just saw two minutes earlier! Or in the case of DVD, two seconds earlier. If a kid or adult cannot recall the events they just saw two minutes earlier without being reminded, this is a sad testament to the increasingly attention-deficit conditioning of the latest generation. Of course, the drug comapanies have conjured up pills for this ""illness,"" but that's a whole other issue!",1319500800,2,1332,5.031674208144796
3555676,4,B001ELJEQA,"I have absolutely loved this series and own all four seasons.  The stories of these true characters are wonderful and educational. Unfortunately when the ""Next Generation"" came with season 4 the format of the show changed including the narrator.  Although I still enjoyed the stories of this last season, apparently viewership fell off and the show was not renewed.  I recommend owning the earlier seasons and watch before seeing this last one.",1305158400,,444,5.138888888888889
3555677,5,B001ELJEQA,"We first watched these meerkat families on nature television.  My mom fell in love with Flower and the rest of the gang.  She found herself deeply involved in their lives; whether their pups lived, who was fighting with who, rival gang raids, etc.  The creatures are delightful and great entertainment for the whole family.  I purchased the entire series for my mom for Christmas and she watches her meerkats over and over again.  They are cute and precious and it's easy to fall in love with them.
