8453398,5,B0051ZH9GW,"Beautiful, touching film with unusual subject matter and terrific acting, especially by the young performers and James Nesbitt. The only nuisance was Jacinda Barrett's ridiculously long, thick hair! The few kisses she exchanged with Nesbitt might have been touching, but one could not see them for her stupid hair.",1509235200,,314,5.428571428571429

8453402,1,B0051ZH9GW,I loved the story; saw it on my cable movie channel; bought it and discovered the dvd would not play in this area where I live.  I had to send it back.  I am a novice and didn't realized one needed to be aware of playability/area of residence .,1392336000,,244,3.9591836734693877
8453403,5,B0051ZH9GW,"but it is not available for Region 1 DVD players. This is too bad because Matching Jack is the kind of movie I would like to watch again and again by myself, and at least once with family and friends.

The main theme of the movie is parent love. One parent goes to great lengths to find a way to make a son well, and another parent goes to great lengths to delight a son whose life can't be saved. Another theme of the movie is loyalty, and how it is clearly and wonderfully evident by some and, sadly, lacking in others--such as the infidelity of a spouse which causes a very important turn of events at end of the movie. The movie has sad moments, but also funny and surprising ones, so while you'll likely cry at times (as I did), this is not a depressing movie from start to finish. The acting is very good and the story line is excellent. I had the chance to see it one afternoon and was very disappointed to find out I can't buy it to watch and share since I live in North America. However, I feel fortunate to have been able to see it even once, and hope many others will be able to enjoy it as well.",1384473600,2,1107,4.077981651376147
8453404,4,B0051ZH9GW,"Saw this on Hulu, I believe. Now I must OWN IT!

I liked this movie on several levels. As a guy, I liked that the lead female was 'normal' cute, not covergirl unapproachable. The cast was so 'everyday' normal that we, the viewers, could have been eavesdropping on an extraordinary moment in typical human life. I liked these people.

The film excelled at portraying people as multi-dimentional, instead of the typical Hollywood ploy of ""if they did one thing wrong, let's make 'em evil all the way through...no subtlties!!

I was sorry when the movie ended, and even a bigger compliment, I was ready to watch it again very soon.

Find a way to see this movie on a cuddle-up, fireplace a-glow, winter's evening.",1360281600,2,710,4.701612903225806

Not many Australian movies win best picture at the Milan International Film Festival. This one did.
Great Aussie cast including Jacinda Barrett, Richard Roxburgh and Yvonne Strahovski. With Tom Russell thrown in for good measure.
It's a shameless tear jerker .  But tear jerkers have their right to exist and many do like them, I don't like them much,but this one is definately worth 4/5. My biggest problem was that everything happening in this film follows the kids cancer film clich. The reason it still works for me is because of the superb acting by everybody on the cast. The whole thing is believable because everybody on screen is simply great, and that's something to see. The director has chosen a low key approach for herself and simply lets her story play out - it also suits the case. A little more originality and this ""tear jerker"" could've been a real gem. As it is, it is still a superb film.
Matching Jack is the story of a mothers search for a bone marrow match for her dying son. After finding out about her husbands infidelities, she goes on a heartbreaking search for a love child that maybe a match for her son.",1315008000,4,1214,4.54337899543379
