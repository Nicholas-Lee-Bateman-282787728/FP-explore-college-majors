8171384,3,B000MRNWS8,"Despite apparently suffering from a director without a funny bone, more less experience directing comedies there are a few really good scenes. The satirical treatment of rap videos was hilarious. It does drag at points and some of the humor is esoteric. Overall it's worth watching if you're not expecting Oscar nominations for best comedy... Silly, rediculous situations, satire and goofy are keywords for this movie. As romantic comedies go, guys are more likely to like this one than most.",1181779200,,492,5.1625
8171385,1,B000MRNWS8,"one of the worst movies I have ever seen. the acting (what acting?), the dialogue, the plot--was this someone's grade school project. I don't know how it ended; I couldn't watch any more. the bunny was cute.",1179792000,3,207,4.621621621621622
