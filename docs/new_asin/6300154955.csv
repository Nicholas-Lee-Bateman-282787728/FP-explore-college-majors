7803134,5,6300154955,Truly one of the very finest performance of this theatre classic. It pains me that this is unavailable in a restored digital format. Heaven knows what shape the original elements are in--if they are even locatable. I do hope someone hears this plea and takes up the cause for our posterity.,1472169600,,290,4.705882352941177
7803135,5,6300154955,"Unfortunately this film had limited distribution and never even played in a movie theater in Chicago.  I was happy when it finally appeared on video.  I think she captures the boredom Hedda experienced and her supporting cast does very well.  Patrick Stewart is a superb Lovberg and Jennie Linden a perfect foil as Thea.  A pity this has never been transferred to dvd.  I would have thought the Brits would have done so by now.  Two other Glenda Jackson movies, STEVIE and TURTLE DIARY, are not on dvd either.  I guess I will always keep my VCR just for these.",1380326400,,560,4.54
7803136,5,6300154955,"One of the best performances of the 70's is going widely unseen because this film is not available yet on DVD.
I don't claim to have seen every screen adaptation of Ibsen's classic about the fatally bored and frustrated Victorian-era housewife, but of those that I have seen (Diana Rigg, Ingrid Bergman) Glenda Jackson's Hedda Gabler is a work to behold. This is a film featuring many of the cast members from the somewhat controversial Royal Shakespeare Company stage production and it is the best adaptation and rendering of the play that I have ever seen. Considered controversial for its translation and direction which dared to emphasize some of the play's comic elements (Hedda's rather endearingly obtuse husband, her manipulative toying with rival Thea Elvsted) while almost daring audiences to feel sympathy for its heroine, it nonetheless is the most vital and emotionally accessible versions I've seen.

As a woman who longs to step out of the constraints that society demands of a woman during this time, Hedda's tragedy is that she lacks the courage to set herself free and is embittered about her own fear of scandal and worry over what others may think. Glenda Jackson conveys Hedda Gabler's almost mercurial changes of mood in such vivid strokes that it is often difficult to watch the other actors on the screen. One senses the tension that seems so close to erupting behind the laced up clothing that is envisioned to be as much of a trap as her over-furnished home and dead-end marriage. Though she may not be the most sympathetic of heroines, as portrayed by Jackson, this Gabler is never less than believable. She quests power over her own life, and, if failing in that , is willing to do the most heinous things in order to feel some control over someone else's. The drama lies in witnessing her consistently working at cross purposes with her goals due to a basic inability to take a risk, emotionally or physically. Hedda is the absolute architect of her downfall.

The production is a handsome one (very Merchant-Ivory) and extremely well cast. It's especially pleasurable to see ""Star Trek""'s Patrick Stuart with hair, and to have Glenda Jackson and Jennie Linden reunited after their memorable pairing in Ken Russell's ""Women in Love.""  Still, for me, Glenda Jackson is close to miraculous here.
So many complex emotions play across her face and so much intelligence and craft is a part of her performance. Truly, she gives such ingenious and lively interpretations to scenes and line readings that each time I see this film I discover more.",1246752000,10,2568,4.912442396313364
7803137,4,6300154955,"Based on Henry Ibsen's play Academy Award Winner Glenda Jackson stars as Hedda, a woman who tries to be everything to everyone but can't and in the end she ends up paying for it. This is a great film that has been neglected since it hasn't been re-released on video since it's first incarnation almost twenty years ago, which is a shame. Enjoy it!!!!!!!
