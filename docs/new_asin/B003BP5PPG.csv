8393887,4,B003BP5PPG,The shipment was timely and well ahead of the scheduled date.  I watched it on a passive 3d monitor without the benefit of Sensio equipment.  It's simply side-by-side and can be plalyed on most every 3D monitor by selecting the side-by-side function and watching it through polarized 3d glasses.  The 3D effects in the film work well and it's a bright and colorful sight in 3d.,1408665600,,377,4.681818181818182
8393888,4,B003BP5PPG,"Having recently watched several superlative Douglas Sirk-directed films (Magnificent Obsession, All That Heaven Allows, Imitation of Life), I was curious to see what he would do with a low-budget B venture. So I was delighted to find Taza available in its original 3D (here in a field-sequential version). Though rather lightweight, the story does manage to incorporate some of Sirk's familiar themes: action based on personal principle, independence of thought, strength of character, etc. What's outstanding - and typical of Sirk's other films - is the tight direction and superb cinematography. Every scene is carefully composed, and here the composition includes depth. There are the usual objects flying through the screen, but most of the effects are carefully chosen for dramatic impact and serve to heighten the viewer's involvement in the action (and there's lot's of it). Not a great film, but very interesting to watch and think about within the context of this great director's more important work.",1270684800,4,1010,5.3584905660377355
