8466486,4,B005DCJ2I6,"This four movie collection including Bloody Murder 1 & 2, Junior and Deadly Species is worth the money. The Bloody Murder movies and Deadly Soecies make it worth purchasing. These are not great movies but have a high velocity for keeping an audience entertained. This four film collection has a specific audience, which is horror enthusiasts - and the collection succeeds in drawing the attention of that audience. But this collection is a welcome addition to my movie library. The acting is definitely mediocre in delivery, but the sheer entertaining premise of these movies is the real value of the set. For a fun time and a few thrills, check out the horror movie collection of Bloody Murder, Bloody Murder 2, Junior and Deadly Species. This is the right kind of horror movie collection for the die hard horror fan.",1370649600,,818,4.85

BLOODY MURDER (2000) *
Trevor Moorehouse is (stop me if you've heard this before) a psycho killer with a chainsaw who preys on kids at a summer camp. But enough about him, this movie isn't really even about him. It's about saying please and thank you, just like your mom taught you. Seriously, this is the most polite slasher movie ever.

BLOODY MURDER 2 (2003) ***
Hot paging action! Trevor Moorehouse is real, right? That's who all the kids talk about. This sequel ups the gore and nudity, as well as the writing. A considerable step up over the first picture. Ok, this theory might sound crazy, but I think there may be some truth to it: There's one actress (Tiffany Shepis, quite busy as it turns out) who agreed to be naked in multiple scenes. I think she was rewarded for this with a makeover! She just mysteriously appears all dolled up, with a different hairstyle, about 20 minutes into the movie. Bear in mind this takes place in the middle of the woods.

JUNIOR (2002) **
Unrecognizable accents in an unrecognizable location. Not even the stars know where they are. Sandra and Rebecca are friends. Really close ones. I mean to the point where I think it's a lesbian relationship. Unless they do things differently in Belgium (yes, I had to look it up). Their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, and things go south from there. I can't imagine the first hour of the movie is more than a few script pages. Just agonizingly long, pointless scenes. Until there's a big exposition scene with the father. From there, it gets a tad interesting, hence the extra star. ""Junior"" himself, for having brain damage, is really quite agile. Like the guy is a dancer or something. Downright goofy.

DEADLY SPECIES (2002) ***
Dr. Thomas is heading an expedition into the Florida Everglades to search for the elusive Calusa Indian tribe. Wilson Friels, their financier (or maybe he just donated the money, I don't know), mysteriously wants to be along for the ride. Seems the entrance to the Calusa sacred area holds the secrets to life and death. But the team needs to watch their hides, as there is a creature who guards it. Pervert alert! Major camel toe sighting, down the shirt shots, and a few naked ladies. Deadly Species is probably the most well-made of the collection, despite the fact it has men in rubber suits running around in it.",1357862400,2,2405,4.63849765258216
8466488,3,B005DCJ2I6,"First off this is not 4 discs, but 2 2-sided discs. It is basically a bad to so-so lot of movies you would never buy separately under any circumstances. But in a 4-pack they take up so less room on the shelf, you become tempted when they are in the $5.00 bin. I did it. I am not thrilled, but I am not disappointed. It is like kissing your sister.

BLOODY MURDER: A FRIDAY THE 13TH RIP OFF
A guy in a hockey mask kills kids at Camp Placid Pines. I was so upset by the rip off aspect of the film, it was difficult for me to enjoy it. This story includes the creepy old guy who warns the kids about the killer as well as the kid who wears a hockey mask just to scare the other campers. It is better than most low budget slasher films, but not where we want it to be.

No F-bombs or nudity.

BLOODY MURDER 2: AN IMPROVEMENT
Trevor Moorehouse is back for the closing of summer camp. Tracy (Katy Woodruff), who lost a brother (literally they can't find him) 5 years ago is having reoccurring nightmares. There is a new guy in the camp too. His name is Jason (Tyler Sedustine). Several of the scenes were simply remakes from the first movie. Tracy slinks around in tight shorts and sporting some high beams, but always has an excuse not to put out to her bf Mike (Kelly Gunning), so we know she lives. Even though she awakes with cold sweats it is Angela (Tiffany Shepis) who showers with friends and has sex, so she must die according to the slasher movie code. Far, far, better than the first one.

I liked Katy Woodruff. I would liked to have seen her in more horror movies.

F-bomb, sex, Nudity (Tiffany Shepis)

JUNIOR: BELGIUM SLASHER

The movie opens with a woman looking like she is preparing to go out, but instead hangs herself. After the opening credits, which are done in red so we know it will be a good movie, 2 women decide to go on a holiday. Their car breaks down. This is the first car I have seen overheat because they were trying to start it. Phones have dead batteries (they work later) and they can't read a map. One of them decides to go back to the service station for help while the other remains with the car...because they don't want anybody to steal it? European title is ""Engine Trouble."" But since ""Junior"" did so well in 1994, they opted for it.

A mechanic fixes the car with duct tape. Rebecca (Cecilia Bergqvist) drives back to the station but there is no Sandra (Marlene Simons). The sounds from within the gas station suggest that there is the proverbial man-creature locked up. Not much to figure out from here. All you have to do is to connect the creature to the suicide woman, have him get loose, give him a signature murder weapon or default chainsaw, add a gratuitous shower scene and you got yourself a hit slasher film. But NOOOOOO! Apparently in Belgium they have a different idea on how to make a Slasher film, there is no shower scene! Otherwise pretty much what to expect from a slasher.

F-bomb, good sound track, no sex, no nudity, chained up women

DEADLY SPECIES: BRING ME A DIRTY MARTINI
During the opening credits we find out this is a ""Dirty Martini"" production. Early in the film, the man who finances the expedition drinks dirty martinis made by a topless pool girl. Coincidence? I think not. Dr. Brinson Thomas (Pete Penuel) assembles a crack team of young co-eds that work cheaply, to find a missing tribe in the Everglades, most likely connected to the thing we did not see that killed two people before the credits. Hopefully these girls like to take showers because they can't act

Brian Minyard plays Wilson Friels, a bad actor who is made to look sinister with a goatee. He is financing the expedition, plans on going along, and has an undisclosed ulterior motive. During the first night camping, Friels tells the legendary story about the lost tribe and the creature. They discover the ransacked camp and human remains. They want to leave the island, but the boat won't be back for a few days. No sense packing a radio. The creature appears to be manufactured from the same high-tech polymer NASA uses in their space shuttle tires.

You could watch worse.
