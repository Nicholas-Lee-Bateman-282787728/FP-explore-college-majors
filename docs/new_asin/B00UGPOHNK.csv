7037337,1,B00UGPOHNK,"I saw this tour live and was so excited that this was released so fast right after the tour.  And unlike other Live DVD's the cost was much lower than the normal Live DVD at only $12.99. But that is where the good news ended.  When I watch a Live DVD, I hope that it brings me back to the show and that I can enjoy the memories while it recreates that experience I had at the show.  This DVD fails to even spark any of those memories during almost the entire show.  Rather than the traditional camera angles of the stage etc lights and close ups this film show a bunch of animation during the best parts of the concert. You don't get to see Tony playing during any important parts that he so often does.  You will be watching stuff under the stage however, which is something that should be found in the behind the scenes section of the DVD.  Horrible disappointment, out of hundreds of DVD's i own this it the absolute worst one I ever had the displeasure of trying to watch, and it was very hard.",1474848000,9,998,4.198952879581152

8705690,4,B00UGPOHNK,"I'll start by stating the obvious - I'm a big PG fan.

I bought this Blu-rays I previously only had an audience-shot boot of the same gig, same night. It's only right the artist should be paid for his work.

The song list is great, the band are utterly fantastic, PG is in good voice...but....
Where the bootleg DVD is entirely absorbing, this Blu-ray feels rather cold.
The nonsensical split screen adds nothing, but detracts from the atmosphere. A couple of clips of the very clever staging would suffice.
On Signal to Noise, the bootleg stands back & admires the very dramatic stage effects. On the blu-ray, it cuts from here to there & back again & some of the magic is lost.

Still love PG, but I wish I had stuck with the bootleg",1522022400,2,735,4.42962962962963

8705695,5,B00UGPOHNK,"From the the times of Genesis to his on: the best voice, the best actor, the best composer...Peter Gabriel is by far the best concert I've ever seen. I can't wait for his new one to come!",1479772800,,187,4.081081081081081
8705696,5,B00UGPOHNK,"Great to finally get Growing Up Live in HD, unfortunately, unlike what others have reported, it's only 1080i and all other features, and the second disc, are in SD.  In fact, Unwrapped + Still Growing Up on disc 2 is just a DVD.  So an upgrade that combines these two packages to save space, literally... my order from Amazon did not come in a blue blu-ray case like shown, it was instead in a cardboard CD-style case, see photos.",1476489600,15,430,4.430379746835443
8705697,5,B00UGPOHNK,"A fantastic upgrade to Bluray from the original DVD of Growing Up Live. The upgrade to lossless audio and 1080i video is quite the welcome addition to my favorite Peter Gabriel concert. This release also includes a DVD of Still Growing Up Live which is a nice bonus. Simply put, if you are a fan of his music, you should own this.",1476403200,9,330,4.338709677419355
8705698,5,B00UGPOHNK,"The previous review seems to be based on pre-conceived expectations that are not going to be shared by everyone.  It hardly gives a fair and unbiased evaluation of this set.  First, let me say that this is a review based on the DVD version of the set and therefore will only be based on the overall content and not the quality of the picture and sound.  That being said, one can hope that because it is a blu-ray version, that both picture and sound quality will be enhanced to some degree.
I found the content to be extremely entertaining.  Particularly, the way it started with just Peter Gabriel on keyboard and then was slowly ""built"" by adding musicians and instruments slowly throughout the first few songs.  As the band was built, so was the intensity of the music.  If you are a Peter Gabriel fan, this disc will satisfy.  The selection of songs played were basically a ""greatest hits"" parade with additional songs from the then most recent album ""Growing Up"".  Overall it is a very good setlist.  One song that I found a particular standout, was one of the new songs from ""Growing Up"", called ""Sky Blue"".  During this song, Gabriel was joined by a guest group of Gospel singers, ""The Blind Boys of Alabama"".  It's a slower song that that builds to an almost chant-like ending that is quiet dramatic.
The band that joins Peter Gabriel is nothing short of exceptional.  It includes long-time sidemen, David Rhodes on guitar, and ex-King Crimson bassist, Tony Levin.  These two musicians have played with Gabriel since he left Genesis in the late 70s and are extremely accomplished musicians in their own right.  However, the remaining band members are hardly slouches themselves.  The remaining members of this very talented group includes, drummer Ged Lynch, multi-instrumentalist, Richard Evans, keyboardists and vocalists, Rachel Z and Gabriel's daughter, Melanie.
As always, the theatrics and special effects of the show were very entertaining.  Gabriel is very good at balancing the theatrics with the musical aspect of the show.  At no time do they overshadow the music or the musicians.  I don't want to go into the exact nature of the effects because they are best served as a kind of surprise.
I must disagree with the previous, negative review.  I found this show to be very good.  I've seen Peter Gabriel several times, however, I did not see this tour in person.  I think where the previous reviewer made a mistake is approaching this with pre-conceived expectations of wanting to ""relive"" the live show.  I've found that it's extremely difficult for a recorded show to match the intensity of it's actual live version.  There are very few DVDs that accomplish very difficult task.  I think you kind of ""setup"" the recording for failure if you expect it to match the live show in atmosphere and intensity.",1475798400,14,2823,4.833333333333333
