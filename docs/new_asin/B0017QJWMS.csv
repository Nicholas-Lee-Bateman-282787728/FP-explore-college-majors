You can also visit DisneyCruiseLine.com and receive a DCL Vacation Planning DVD for free. They release new additions each year, so the only possible reason why anyone should be interested in this is if you're looking specifically for the 2008 version... And if so, then where's the Delorean because I'd like to go back in time too. That'd be fun. If this was maybe a Vacation Planning VHS from the nineties or earlier, I can see that being put up for sale for maybe fifteen bucks max. Don't spend money on this guys, I wouldn't want anybody to waste their money on something that he or she could get free... and unused.",1317772800,3,793,4.671428571428572
8266903,5,B0017QJWMS,"I'm a huge fan of Disney, and I love this DVD and the brochures that are included with it. It's very fun and informative for first time visitors and visitors who are going for the 100th time. I love the various tips and options that they give. Even if you aren't going to go for a while, this is a great keepsake item to have. It's cool how actual people talk about the experiences that they've had.",1314316800,,399,4.194805194805195
