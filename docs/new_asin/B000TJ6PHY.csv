The picture and sound quality of these shorts is ok, as long as you are not expecting anything special like a David Sheperd restoration. (They are similar in quality to Grapevine Videos product).
I also suspect that this disc has been ported from a couple UK (PAL) DVD's released a couple years ago by a company called IVL. My reasons for this assumption are as follows:
1. The two uk disc's released in 2004 have exactly the same shorts in exactly the same order as this new Televista disc.
2. The running time of the two UK disc's added together is exactly the same as the total running time of this new Televista disc.
3. The last 10 or 20 seconds on the second UK had a fault on the sound track (a loud hiss), this fault is present on the Televista disc right at the end.
In summary this is quite a good collection that I would recommend if you do not already have most of the titles on it.",1191542400,51,1813,4.7405063291139244

8209771,3,B000TJ6PHY,"This is only OK.

I thought there would be some Keystone Kops on this but there really wasn't. Picture was acceptable but that was about all. It was nice to see some Fatty Arbuckle footage. That was interesting but nothing was great. It was ok as a filler at our last 'movie night'. We will probably never watch this again however.

I would rate this an OK - 5.75 to 6.25 out of 10 - ok if you like Fatty Arbuckle but otherwise forgettable.",1443225600,,440,4.226190476190476

8209773,3,B000TJ6PHY,"This dvd is old short, silent movies. I was hoping for the keystone cops who would drive in front of trains at ridiculous speeds, barely escaping, and guys falling off the back and just chaos in general. Wanted the grandkids to see that kind of behavior.",1316390400,2,254,4.543478260869565
8209774,4,B000TJ6PHY,"I enjoy silent films, and this is one that is very enjoyable.  They did a good job of putting this one together.  If you like silent films, this one is just right.",1300320000,,163,4.0625
8209775,4,B000TJ6PHY,"This DVD is a collection of various Keystone comedies. The majority of this collection features the likes of Fatty Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin, and Ford Sterling. All of the films are in watchable condition, which is all you can ask for with these shorts (they're almost 100 years old). You get great value for your dollar--14 shorts on 1 disc can't beat that.

What I didn't like about this collection, and why it didn't get 5 stars from me, is the chapters aren't broken up correctly. You'll choose a chapter thinking it will begin a short, only to discover it's at a random place of the film itself. Very annoying, but you can work around this by manually fast forwarding to the short you wish to view. Plus, the bio section is pointless since it only shows a title card that reads ""Starring Mack Sennett, Fatty Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, and Ford Sterling"". No big deal, but that seems to be on there for no real reason.

Overall, I love this DVD. It's a great way to view random Keystones all in one place. It's fun to pop in the disc and let it play from start to finish--as if you're doing a ""silent movie night"" in your living room. If you're looking for Keystones at a very affordable price, do yourself a favor and pick this up. I'm happy I did.",1298332800,5,1266,4.452586206896552

8209777,5,B000TJ6PHY,"The ""Krazy Keystone Komedies"" DVD is hilarious!  Who ever said ""Black & White"" is out never saw this collection!  I laughed myself silly [er...sillier].

If you want a great set of laughs, you ought to buy this DVD!

8209779,3,B000TJ6PHY,"This DVD contains a lot of great, old Keystone comedies.  The quality of the films is acceptable.  However, production of the DVD was fairly amateurish.  There is no track list, which lists the films.  Also, the chapter menu does not index the films correctly.  For instance, ""Ambrose's Sour Grapes"" begins towards the end of track 4.  The remainder of the film is on track 5.  ""When Ambrose Dared Walrus"" begins in the middle of track 8 and continues on tracks 9 and 10.  Other films are indexed in similar manner.  These include ""Wandering Willies,"" ""Ambrose's Lofty Perch"" and ""Those Bitter Sweets.""  The omission of a film/track list and the problems with the chapter menu make the DVD very difficult to navigate.  For the price, however, it's still a DVD worth having.  (Hopefully, the producers and/or distributors of this DVD will offer a revised disc, to those of us who have already bought the DVD.)

The list of films has been provided, in another review.  Notable actors include Fatty Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, Al St. John, Mack Swain, Chester Conklin, Billy Bevan, Andy Clyde, Edgar Kennedy, Ford Sterling, Charley Chase, Slim Summerville, Louise Fazenda, Mae Busch, Minta Durfee, Phyllis Haver and Marie Prevost.",1192752000,25,1224,5.024875621890548
