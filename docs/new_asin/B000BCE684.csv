8085090,5,B000BCE684,With the discovery of Corner Gas I was searching for more Canadian shows and bought Chilly Beach. Always liked cartoons so I was real interested in the winter time setting of this show. Chilly Beach is Goofy and fun. Can't seem to be able to buy any of the other Seasons but can watch them online at Hulu.,1327536000,2,305,4.275862068965517

8085092,5,B000BCE684,"Somewhere between New England and the North Pole lies a vast, untamed Artic wilderness known only as Canada.
Here in this frozen wasteland lies a place where time stands still. Where proud traditions like hockey brawls and Canadian beer are cherished and passed from one generation to the next. Where the climate is so richly varied that you can ski in the winter, then come back in the summer and ski on slightly wetter snow.
Where moose and polar bears roam free and devour the local population as nature intended. And where people of different heritages live harmoniously side-by-side, and threaten to spilt from each other, not quite so harmoniously. Welcome to Chilly Beach, a small, unsuccessful Canadian resort community somehow built on the shores of a drifting ice floe, far north. This is a town where all of the common misconceptions about life in Canada are true. From the brutal year-long winter, to the over-the-top polite passivity, to the almost religious preoccupation with hockey; this is our country as we think the world sees it. It's Canada, but taken to the extreme.

Chilly Beach traces the adventures of the various residents of this obscure little village. In particular it follows Dale and Frank, two fun-loving, hockey-playing best friends who have spent their whole lives here largely oblivious to the outside world.

Along with the rest of the quirky townsfolk Dale and Frank confront the inhospitable climate, outrageous culture clashes with visiting foreigners, exaggerated Canadian customs both old and new, and whatever other surreal and perilous situations their unique home throws their way.

This DVD Box Set contains all 26 episodes from Season One and a 'toque-full' of extra goodies:
* Exclusive The World is Hot Enough Chilly Beach Movie Sneak Peek
* Original Webisodes
