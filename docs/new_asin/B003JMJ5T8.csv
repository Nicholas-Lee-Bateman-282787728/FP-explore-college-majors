4131008,4,B003JMJ5T8,"The Classic Album series is an impressive one. They've taken some of my favorite artists and have went inside some of my all time favorite albums. When I heard they were doing an episode for Paranoid, I was pretty excited. In September, this album will turn 40 years old. I wanted to rent it but I had to buy it as it wasn't on Netflix. I bought my copy today and I have to say this is a good documentary. It's authorized and has the band's music in it and all four members are interviewed. Unlike most episodes of Classic Albums, this one covers every song except one (Rat Salad. I believe it's in the bonus material). Personally, I'd wait until a channel like VH1 Classic airs this. If you're a Black Sabbath fan, you'll want this right away.",1279929600,,744,4.359712230215828
4131009,5,B003JMJ5T8,"When I first saw this I knew I had to have it, so I went on Amazon, but lets get to the DVD, Black Sabbath paranoid is a classic don't believe me look it up in the dictionary it will tell you that and more Black Sabbath are the fore-fathers of Heavy Metal,this dvd is for everyone,all fan's rejoice this is a must have! it's chaulk full of Iommi's riff's, Geezer's bass and lyrics, and Bill wards thunderous drumming, and last but not least the Ozz man Ozzy Osbourne's vocal delivery and his own lyrics, there's so much detail about how this album was made recorded and how or why they did this or that all by the band themselves ,What more do you want? in a stellar dvd with Black Sabbath no less, now do the right thing and go out and get it, on Amazon people!",1279929600,,762,4.155405405405405
4131010,3,B003JMJ5T8,"As a HUGE fan of Sabbath AND the Classic Album series - I would be lying if I said this wasn't somewhat of a disappointment. Overall, it seemed more like a ""VH-1 Behind the Music"" segment, than an in-depth look at a ""Classic Album"".

The first 10 - 20 minutes ran through everything true Sabbath fans already know, such as Tony's finger tips and Geezer's vision. There was entirely too much focus on the political climate of the time, with tons of footage from Vietnam and civil unrest of the late 60's - early 70's. While the era certainly had a bearing on the band's inspiration, the amount of time devoted to it simply robbed viewers of a comprehensive look into the production of an incredible album.
Segments where the producer isolated the recordings to showcase instruments and parts seemed rushed and very short, almost as filler to break up each main segment. For instance, Rodger Bain commented on a particular track and said something to the effect of (I'm paraphrasing here) ""This is my all time favorite vocal track from Ozzy. He sang this to perfection, so menacing and soulful"". I just knew he would play the isolated vocal track. I mean - it seemed too obvious - but, nope - bam - right back to the VH-1 style presentation. When I found myself yelling at the TV - ""Play the track!! let's hear it!!!!"" I knew this was NOT what I was hoping for.

REDEMPTION (of sorts)
For those longing for more in-depth coverage of Geezer, Tony and Bill's incredible talents - rest assured - you will get your fix in the bonus segments. It's a shame the producers choose not to include this footage in the main feature. There's plenty of track isolation, demonstrations and live performances to satisfy. In fact, if it weren't for the bonus material - I would have given this review 1 star.",1279152000,58,1789,4.5875
4131011,3,B003JMJ5T8,Just ok. I am a HUGE Sabbath Fan and Found This a Little Bit Borning. It was Nice to Hear the Boys Talking About the Record and Hear The Tracks Broke Down and isolated but there was no new classic footage of any kind etc..............Just thought it could have been better. Rent Dont Buy.,1278720000,3,288,4.351851851851852
4131012,5,B003JMJ5T8,"The Classic Album series is one of the best in the business.  From artists to producers to sound engineers to famous journalists, Classic Albums dissects the music that matters most.  This time around they take on one of Metal's all time great releases, Black Sabbath's  Paranoid.

The documentary features new and candid interviews with all four of Sabbath's original members including vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, guitarist Tony Iommi, bass player Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward.  Behind the board, showing off the original master tapes is none other than the future famous producer Tom Allom (Def Leppard, Judas Priest).  It is fascinating to hear all of the parts separately and then put together as the classic Paranoid was being built.

Everyone involved tells the story of what it was like to be a member of Black Sabbath touring America and become both famous and infamous at the same time.  This is a legendary album by a legendary band.  Hearing the sounds and the stories behind ""Iron Man,"" ""War Pigs,"" Paranoid,"" ""Fairies Wear Boots"" and ""Electric Funeral"" will keep you on the edge of your seat.",1275091200,31,1108,4.978260869565218

4131068,5,B003JMJ5T8,"wish they would do one on the first album, but just like Paranoid, they weren't really in studio long enough to make it a whole show so its kinda combined with this one. Maybe they will do Sabbath Bloody Sabbath one day. Either way this was great to listen to and fun to watch Geezer and Tony play.",1445385600,,298,4.155172413793103

4131073,5,B003JMJ5T8,"This DVD is a 'must own' for any fan of the timeless, mega influential Black Sabbath.  The DVD delves into how this seminal hard rock band, who many claim ARE the 'grandfathers of metal', conceived of and recorded the historic 'Paranoid' album.  There is excellent archived footage, band interviews, and demonstrations of the multi-tracked recordings themselves.  Don't miss this one!",1418947200,,384,5.366666666666666
