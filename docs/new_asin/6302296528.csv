8277284,3,6302296528,"Not some of the best episodes are on this VHS. It is becoming very rare and hard to find becuae the DVD series came out. One of the three stories is any good.  The bonus to buying this VHS tape is that it has two stories which are not on the DVD or any other tape at this time.

I would recomend that you buy the VHS volume 1 OR the DVD series which is WELL worth the money for the amount of stories you get and the quality.  This VHS book 5 is not very good comapred to the rest of the series.
