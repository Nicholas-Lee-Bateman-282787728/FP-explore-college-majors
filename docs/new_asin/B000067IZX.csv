7963022,5,B000067IZX,"Catalina Larranaga is not only gorgeous, she can act well enough to carry with credibility this interesting story. Fortunately, she has several nude scenes, and is she ever a voyeur's dream! For softcore (no penetration or erections shown), this film has unusually explicit female nudity with masturbation, and even a few full frontal male shots.
I disagree totally with several other viewers: the ""research subjects"" were generally attractive, both male and female. Candace Washington has an AMAZING body and is very convincing as a porn actress who loves her job for the sense of power that it gives her.
A very entertaining film.",1352678400,,632,5.145631067961165
7963023,5,B000067IZX,"...the general overview of this movie is a positive one, thanks to director Tom Lazarus...he knows how to push the bounderies of the softcore genre...to me softcore movies should be more like this...no unecessary hiding of the genitals, with a chair, blanket, awkward poses, camera angles, etc...but trying to be as natural as possible...who ever said that vulvas and penises were for hardcore porn or art movies only? Many mainstream movies do show male and female genitals, even the erect penis, which seems to be still taboo in this genre...(Shortbus, Lie with me, Dreamers, etc) The main reason many of us watch softcore dvd's is to see genitals without having to resort to hardcore movies which some find too extreme...so, for those of you who like me, are looking for a decent storyline, pretty good acting, good sex scenes with vulvas, then this one is pretty much what you're looking for...enjoy.",1191715200,2,904,4.993377483443709
7963024,5,B000067IZX,This is by far the best movie Catalina Larranaga has ever starred in. It's about a young woman(Catalina Larranaga)who is doing a study of exhibitionists. She tries to stay professional while talking to and watching people that have sex on film or in public but she gets in over her head. She has sex with one of the men she is interviewing and this guy starts stalking her. No matter how hard she tries to keep some sense of objectivity during this project something comes along and ruins it. In a couple scenes in the movie miss Larranaga tries to be an exhibitionist herself. She shows off her naked body at an open window and later on she masturbates in front of her own camera just for the thrill of it. This is a very hot movie that is well made and has a great plot.

In the Exhibitionist Files, Catalina Larranaga reprises her role as Dr Lisa Morrison, a psychological research scientist. Previously in Voyeur Confessions, Lisa Morrison is an attractive Psychological research scientist studying voyeurism, who gets caught up in the passions of her subjects. Now, one year later, she is delving into the flip side of the coin and studying exhibitionism.

The Plot

Once again Dr. Morrison is researching deviancy in sexual behavior and once again she finds it difficult to stay objective and detached. One of her subjects, named Robert, (Rafe Urquhart) garners her interest romantically and after terminating him from the project, she has a brief fling with him. At first annoyed by his obsessiveness, Lisa begins to fear for her safety, even her life as it becomes evident that Robert is a sick man.

The Story

Lisa's current research seems to center around six test subjects. There's Erin, (Sydnee Steele) a corporate executive who feels compelled to display her sexual intimacies with nearby bystanders. Second, we have Candy, (Candace Washington) a statuesque, hardbody African American porn actress, who gets a kick out of turning on her audiences on film or otherwise. Third, there's Jess, (Diana Kauffman) who has a web cam in her apartment where she periodically puts on shows for her subscribers. In addition, we have Della, (Flower) who in her travels puts on little shows for men, showing a nipple here, a V shot there. Mark and Ellen, a married couple who keep acting out the same sexual scene in their lovemaking, reliving a voyeuristic experience in Marks past, where a neighboring lady would exhibit herself to him. Lastly we have Robert, who models in the nude for art classes.

Lisa is attracted to Robert which she feels would interfere with her professional judgment. She removes him from the project but later goes to dinner with him and eventually has intercourse with him on her front balcony, Afterward, she begins to sense a strangeness in Robert and tries to brake it off. This only exacerbates Roberts's erratic behavior, which escalates to a stalker, with Lisa being the stalked.

Erotica

Except for a scene of Lisa and Robert and a couple with her subjects Erin and Candy, the remaining erotic scenes were those relayed by the various subjects to Lisa from memory. These memories were varied in degrees of excitement and some were quite compelling. Several different women were used in these scenes, which explain why there are so many women listed in the cast. There were no explicit views of sex but there were a couple explicit shots of woman's and passing shots of men's genitalia. Overall, there were some nice looking women in the movie with great bodies.

The Exhibitionist Files was produced by Playboy Entertainment. The director was Tom Lazarus.

Conclusion

Like it's predecessor Voyeur Confessions, I thought The Exhibitionist Files was an interesting new take on erotica, with a plot that, for a change, was more than fatuous. In fact I thought one of the subjects turning out to be a stalker was a nice touch which took this movie to a level higher than the average T&A softcore flick.

The cast was decent and so was the acting. I was especially impressed with the acting job Catalina Larranaga put forth regarding the stalker, Robert. It was some first rate acting.

I could see where the story was going but it didn't matter. Some of the scenes were highly erotic and some you couldn't even see what was going on. I didn't expect much from this film and I was pleasantly surprised. Final rating 4 stars.",1146960000,5,3786,4.921383647798742
