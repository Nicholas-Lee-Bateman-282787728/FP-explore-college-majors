7015462,5,B00TPN7DEO,I have seen this many times in many different versions ranging from good to unwatchable.  This one really hit it out of the park with an incredible print.  The quality is the best I have seen and the special features are a gem.,1435536000,,227,4.255813953488372
7015463,5,B00TPN7DEO,"As good as you're gonna get over here.  You can search and pay premium for a bit better picture, but face it, I've never seen it look better on my TV and that's what blu-ray's all about!  The picture does seem a bit washed at times but that's what video adjustments were made for.  Don't just slap it in with your TV set to THX or Cinema settings because they're basically for modern color extravaganza's...and you might have to play around a bit to get it right but you can if you try - I did!  The real surprise here is the soundtrack...which is as clear as a bell...no hisssss  or flutter like every other version I've ever seen in the quiet moments.  Astounding!!

The movie's a classic and Laurel & Hardy are eternally funny.  Even the dated parts are now like looking back at a time capsule so you can't go wrong.  If you're as big a fan as I am then this is good enough!!!!",1435536000,,880,4.221556886227545

7015466,4,B00TPN7DEO,"I pre-ordered this latest Home Video Release of Laurel & Hardy's THE FLYING DEUCES on the strength of a most reliable Technical Review by Paul Mular, and my decision to do this was further galvanized by what was ironically, a negative assessment of the Film by another, as I rather liked what I saw with that other Review's (From dvdbeaver.com) included Screenshots!

Before delving any further, I'll state that this latest Blu-ray Edition has my endorsement for the following reasons:

There has simply never been a better Print/Transfer issued for Home Video in North America, and most likely not anywhere else, either!  Never before have I viewed a Print of this Film that has good quality Video/Audio and also transferred at the proper fps speed!  Every quality version previously issued to DVD and Blu-ray has been affected one way or another by the 4% speedup that's associated with the PAL Format, which affects vocal pitch.  I find this especially noticeable when Ollie sings ""Shine On, Harvest Moon,"" which is one of the Film's big highlights!  Yes, this even includes the 2004 lauded U.S. release of the Kino DVD (Previously widely considered the best Region 1 version, which nevertheless, used a rather lousy looking replaced End Title!), as it derived from a PAL Digital Transfer.

In addition, all of the original Opening and Closing Credits are present, including the correct opening RKO Logo.  As an added bonus, the correct End Title music can finally be heard, as opposed to what is now clear to me was sloppily overdubbed with music taken from the Opening Credits, that has been heard on countless Public Domain Editions!

With all that said, I'll be perfectly honest and state that the digital transfer could have probably been at least a bit better, as current VCI Releases still utilize the MPEG 2 Video codec, rather than the superior H.264 codec that's the current industry standard for the Blu-ray Disc Format.  My positive recommendation is based on the fact that there is no better Home Video version of THE FLYING DEUCES available at present, and it does look quite good to my eyes!

As an added bonus, English Subtitles in easy to read Yellow Lettering, are included!

Special thanks are also most deservedly given to Richard W. Bann, Tim Beddows, Ray Faiola, and Tom Holland within the post credits!  I wholeheartedly second that, and also extend my thanks to those who were involved behind the scenes for their assistance in providing the best Home Video Edition of Laurel & Hardy's THE FLYING DEUCES to date!

Notes:  The Additional Bonus Content, while most welcome, doesn't figure into my evaluation of this disc, as I feel that in this case, the focus ought to be on what is in my opinion, the new Gold Standard for this most enjoyable Laurel & Hardy Feature!

The included screenshots were captured in part, by means of the ""PrtScn"" Function on a 720p screen, and thus the images are not displayed in their full 1080p resolution.  However, these should still provide some helpful insight as to the Visual quality level of the Film for this release!

***************************************************UPDATES********************************************************

1. The recently released UK Based Network On Air Blu-ray Version (Region ABC, or All Regions!) is visually superior to VCI's!  As the new Gold Standard for THE FLYING DEUCES, the Network BD has my full endorsement.  They also offer up a Region 0 PAL DVD version, that is subject to 4% speedup, as indicated by its 3 minutes shorter running time.

2. For those Region A viewers that are bothered by the 4% speedup and aren't set up for Blu-ray, VCI Entertainment is now offering THE FLYING DEUCES on DVD-R for direct purchase through their website.  The Bonus Features on this is identical to the Blu-ray.",1432252800,11,3805,5.004761904761905
7015467,4,B00TPN7DEO,"5/27/15 UPDATE:
I have the Network Blu-ray. It is better than VCI's. There is detail on Ollie's dark coat that is missing in the black-crushed VCI copy. The film speed is the correct 24fps, there is NO speed-up. I updated my review, but there is conflicting information regarding Network's disc playing in region A.

Original unedited review:
I have an advanced Blu-ray check disc of the VCI FLYING DEUCES.
Is this the ultimate Blu-ray restoration?  No, the picture is not Blu-ray sharp.  The contrast is higher than it should be.  The disc is encoded MPEG2 and not AVC.  I'm not sure if AVC would make any improvement here.

Is it the best on the market to date?  YES.
Let me say that VCI's 35mm RKO print is in PRISTINE condition! The Blu-ray was produced by Sabucat Film archives.

1) It is nothing like the Legend Blu-ray release or the Kino PAL converted NTSC DVD.
  a) TRT is 68:54
  b) It has the original RKO beeping tower logo and titles, as well as end credits never on U.S. DVD before.  It is mastered from 35mm, but I think the faces look a little light at times.  While it looks nice, clear and the best U.S. presentation to date, it lacks the crispness of video restored classics from major studios.  This has a natural film look and is the best release out there on this title.
  c) The audio is crisp and clear as if it was recorded yesterday.

2) The Bonus material is more than reported on other sites,
  a) This Is Your Life with Laurel & Hardy (29:31)  **Remastered from a 35mm Kinescope!  This is the sharpest I have ever seen this show outside of the
  official DVD release!
  b) Foreign trailer for Sons of the Desert called ""Hijos Del Desierto"" (2:32)
  c) The Paperhanger's Helper - an Oliver Hardy solo film. (8:52) this is the Castle Films cut-down 16mm home movie release with the Em Gee rental library logo.
  d) an extract from Lucky Dog (16:49) - the famous Stan Laurel comedy in which Oliver Hardy makes an appearance holding Stan up on the street.
  To be honest, this presentation of Lucky Dog is a waste, it is incomplete and has compression artifacting.

My apologies for the image quality on the screen captures, my computer does not have a Blu-ray player so I had to photograph them off of the TV.",1427068800,35,2386,4.769607843137255
8702596,5,B00TPN7DEO,"The blu ray looked great and the disc was everything it was advertised to be.  However, the disc was shipped with a case of cat food and the  case was crushed, with a part broken off of the edge. NOT THE VENDOR'S FAULT!  Bad packing job.",1525824000,,237,4.108695652173913

8702599,5,B00TPN7DEO,I thought this was copied from Kino Video's dvd. But that isn't true. The film was remastered from a 35mm print and it looks better than ever! This is your life included in the extras also was very interesting. Sons of the desert trailer and the 2 silent shorts look as if they were filmed yesterday! Overall a very nice transfer for the money!,1469923200,,344,4.390625

8702601,5,B00TPN7DEO,"This Blu-ray has a fantastic 35mm remastered print of Stan & Ollie's appearance on ""This Is Your Life"". I bought the official ""This Is Your Life"" Ultimate Collection, which is wonderful, but the original opening titles and commercials were removed, and the print itself was 16mm and rather worn. This version is uncut and crystal clear with outstanding video & audio. This alone makes this Blu-ray worth owning.",1449705600,,411,5.0588235294117645

8702603,5,B00TPN7DEO,"I needed a kick in the pants because I loved this movie and the guys when I was a kid.  The word Dated applies, and the sight jokes are now a bit off.  I am still amazed at what Laurel and Hardy could do, and here is another role for Ming The Merciless from Flash Gordon.  Back then, special effects were not CGI, so you might cringe at the simple gifts.  Enjoy, somehow, the slapstick.  Proves humans are crazy, again.",1438300800,,419,4.1875
