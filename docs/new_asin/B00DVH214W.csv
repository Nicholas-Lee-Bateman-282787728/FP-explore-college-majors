The original review:

Here is treasure indeed with the unbeatable and priceless combination of a spellbinding set of Chopin's 24 Preludes and a biographical documentary by Andras Schiff that is impossible to stop once it starts.

Schiff plays the preludes on an 1860 Pleyel grand piano of Chopin's period in the beautifully restored concert hall of the Ancien Conservatoire in Paris, a venue in which Chopin himself performed. This set of peformances is done without an audience but nevertheless communicates his love and devotion to Chopin's work wonderfully. At the time of listening it seems impossible to imagine any other way of performing the music.

This level of utter and selfless commitment is continued throughout the 50 minute documentary which one can only describe as gripping. It is one of the very few elite documentaries to be found as bonus features on discs that would give enormous pleasure on repeat viewings. The biography is illustrated throughout by Schiff with extracts from no less than 19 works played on a variety of pianos. There is film of countries and venues visited by Chopin during his short life coupled with copious paintings and artefacts. Schiff himself speaks gently and knowledgably on camera as if to an interested friend although one suspects that he might be on his own with the photographer.

The imaging comes from 1999 and is good for its time and perfectly well able to communicate all of this and give sustained enjoyment. The sound is in perfectly serviceable stereo comparable to CD sound of the time and faithfully captures the distinctive timbres of the Pleyel piano used for the recital.

This, as stated at the start, is treasure indeed and regardless of the lack of Blu-ray definition and surround sound options, I would suggest that its virtues far out-weigh its deficiencies. In summary, a totally fulfilling experience to be savoured and enjoyed time and time again.
