1697666,4,B0000640T9,I enjoy Placido Domingo's portrayal of the title character over Pavorotti's anyday.  He's a better actor by far.  A good performance of this opera.,1167436800,3,147,5.083333333333333
1697667,5,B0000640T9,"This is a dream cast (as the other reviewers have indicated).  All the voices are up to their roles, no mean feat...and this is a delicious opera.  Katia Ricciarelli is an ideal Amelia with her warm creamy tones and excellent acting ability.  Domingo revels in the role of Gustavo in his juicy young voice (he's about 34 here.

Ulrica is just perfect with a voice wholly up to the demands.. an exceptional Ulrica in my mind. Renato is fine...not show-stopping, but more than up to it nonetheless.  Reri Grist is fine too...again, not beyond the beyond (every Oscar I have seen live or recorded has been good to very good..this must be a vocally felicitous role in general or I have been very lucky).

BUT, the lighting for much of this is non-existent.  The darkness is appropriate to the libretto, but is not compatible with viewing as well as listening.  Maddening. The entire 2nd act is mainly flashes of white handkerchief or collar ruff with the occasional glimpse of a face.",1093478400,21,980,4.690058479532164
1697668,4,B0000640T9,"Enjoyed this very much.  Every one did a wonderful job, I thought.  Nothing spectacular or outstanding, but really engrossing and pleasing.  (It took the king about as long to die as Desdemona and Gilda!  They all kept coming back to life!)  I knew before but it didn't take until this show that there really are other sopranos besides Sutherland, Callas and Sills, good ones.  Ricciarelli was very good, liquid and warm.  Oscar I thought almost stole the show.  She was wonderful, a tricky, intricate, demanding part sung with ease, reminded me of Ratti, whose performance I've cherished for years.  Domingo (particularly during his curtain calls) seemed just like a very nice guy with a huge talent.  Good acting all around.  Was struck by everyone's calm self-assured competence during curtain calls.  Old pros.  Was finally struck by how much more is gotten (at least by me) from watching an opera than just listening to it on CDs.  Sets were beautiful, texture of the film or color seemed a little off, but minor, subtitles left lots to the imagination.  Subtitle:  ""I want to see my son.""  Amelia sings for 10 minutes, no subtitles.  ""You may see your son.""  Then her husband sings for 10 minutes, no subtitles.  The subtitles were just enough to keep you conscious of what the story was, little better than a synopsis, made me a little angry eventually.  If you like this music, I recommend this DVD, even, subdued, quality, good performances.",1086480000,12,1450,4.860655737704918
1697669,4,B0000640T9,"After spend some time in researches , I founded a complete list of the cast on this '75 ROH production:

Oscar - Reri Grist
Mlle. Arvidson - Elizabeth Bainbridge
Silvano - William Elwin
Samuel - Gwynne Howell

1697670,5,B0000640T9,"This Ballo is just excellent and I am sorry that as a teenager I didn't go and see it.
The Covent Garden production is excellent, although why the other characters retain their Boston status, and King Gustaf his Swedish one, is more of a mystery.  Also, Ulrika and Sam and Tom are uncredited and don't take curtain calls - why?
Forget that though, Domingo is perfect and puts into the shade Pavarotti's perfomance in two DVD's from the Met.  He seems to have studied the role to every fine detail and executes the role to perfection - as does Katia Ricciarelli ( in much better voice I think that in the Met DVD of the same opera).  Piero Cappuccilli gives a good perfomance, but my wife always reckons it ""was nice of him to turn up"".  That is a bit harsh, but I wonder if he deserves to get the huge ovation during Act III from the very reticent 1975 Convent Garden audience.  Better perfomances go unapplauded.
This though, is the best Ballo on DVD, and won't be over shaddowed by the second Met Ballo with Pavarotti which is due for release this autum.  As a Ballo addict though, I will have all three.",1023580800,34,1106,4.397058823529412
7960135,5,B0000640T9,"When first I saw Verdi's ""Masked Ball,"" it was in the Colonial American setting, and I thought it was about the stupidest plot ever. But set where composer and librettist wanted to set it in the first place, and told about King Gustav, it makes sense! And I cannot imagine a better production than this one: perfectly cast, lushly costumed, dramatically scene-set, and everyone working together wonderfully as a team. I especially like the Oscar.
Just one warning: as far as ""resolution"" goes, the reproduction on the DVD doesn't seem to me any better than it is on my old VHS of the same production. To me, the quality of the reproduction is completely secondary to the quality of the content, and I figured I'd better have this one on DVD for if and when my VHS player goes out and can no longer be replaced.",1505865600,,810,4.554794520547945
7960136,5,B0000640T9,"This is indeed a great performance.  All singers are first rate and, with one exception, all are first rate actors. The exception? Piero Cappuccilli seemed some what old-fashioned, waving his hands and striking poses when delivering his monologues. But in all other matters this cast is magnificent as is, as far as I can tell, the whole musical conception and execution.  Judging against modern recordings, though, the orchestral sound is somewhat constricted and congested in climaxes.  There are only subtitles in English and these no more than to keep one informed about what is going on in the plot.",1500422400,,604,5.08080808080808
7960137,4,B0000640T9,"There is a lot to like here.  But I had previously watched this opera for free on Amazon TV.  That production was Riccardo Muti, Maria Guleghina at La Scala.  I much preferred the Ulrica and the Oscar from that performance to the Ulrica and the Oscar from this 1975 ROH production with Domingo and Katia Ricciarelli.  Domingo, Ricciarelli and Cappuccilli were first rate in this one - three excellent performances.  The traditional costumes and sets were a pleasure to watch.  The subtitles were, as other reviewers have pointed out, few and far between, and when they did come on they were so bold and so bright I felt like a deer in the headlights.  I could not see the oncoming vehicle.  I could see only the high beams.  I much preferred the 1990 Salzurg production with Domingo and Nucci.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4.  ~ Celeste Downey",1470096000,,839,4.601351351351352
7960138,4,B0000640T9,"This 1975 Covent Garden performance is one of the best available on DVD, not only for the soloists' contributions, but also for attempting to reconstruct the original version taking place in Stockholm and not in Boston. The critical edition of the uncensored version of the opera was published only several years after this production, so there are several differences between this edition and the London production (and this London production offers many inconsistencies, either caused by lapses of the singers or careless preparation), expertly conducted by Claudio Abbado. Katia Ricciarelli and Plcido Domingo are in splendid voice and act in this very traditional production directed by Otto Schenk as good as possible. Reri Grist and Elizabeth Bainbridge (Oscar and Ulrica) are most convincing supporting performers. The only drawback is the unrefined performance of the golden-voiced baritone Piero Cappuccilli in the role of Ankastrm.
The main drawback of this DVD of a BBC broadcast is the poor presentation - there are some subtitles (in English only), but not enough to follow the action nor are they optional (they cannot be switched off). So they disrupt the attention rather then help the understanding of the action. The track listing contains some errors, and there are no further extras. I very much hope that this brilliant performance one time may be released on some other label so that we have eventually a release worthy of the performance.",1382140800,3,1461,5.247863247863248
7960139,4,B0000640T9,"It is an old production but Placido Domingo shows all his power!

This is one of Verdi's best operas and there are not many performances of This quality.  Video image is not that good but the sound is so good you forget that as a Jon issue.",1359504000,,240,4.085106382978723
7960140,4,B0000640T9,"This is indeed a sterling performance at the Royal Opera House. The cast is very good, if not outright the best.
I would like to point out that not all the lead singers are hundred percent Verdian singers, with perhaps the exception of Piero Cappuccilli.
Placido Domingo is good in the role of King Gustavo, but pales by comparison with Luciano Pavarotti in this role, or Carlo Bergonzi. Despite being perhaps the best vocal actor, Domingo, especially in his earlier days, did not possess the open and exuberant vocal and acting demeanour that he has come to acquire in his later years. Here he is a shade of a king, more a lovesick youngster than a head of courtiers. His vocalism did not quite possess the Verdian squillo of a del Monaco, Corelli, or even Pavarotti. In terms of style, he has not the musical thrust of a Carlo Bergonzi in the Verdian repertoire. Surprisingly, therefore, he is considered the 'weak link' in this cast.
As the heroine Amelia, Katia Rcciarelli also is not a total Verdian soprano in terms of vocal prowess. However, she does make the most out of the role, and her acting and stage presence more than compensate the minor vocal deficiencies.
Piero Cappucilli, though no longer in his absolute prime in this performance, nonetheless succeeded in persuading the audience what a Verdian baritone should be, and his acting is very fine indeed, perhaps even a cut above the 'King' in terms of his noble demeanour.
The package of the DVD is totally deficient. There is no full cast in the inlaid, and nearly nothing mentioned of the conductor Claudio Abbado.
Even so, the performance is a very even one, and Reri Grist's Oscar more than stole the show. If only her appearance could be a trifle less womanly (which would be difficult, any way), her portrayal would just be perfect.",1265500800,2,1806,4.7365079365079366
7960141,5,B0000640T9,"Let's presume that you don't have this in your collection and are ruminating over which production to buy. Here are the reasons not to buy this one: A) You don't like it when composers like Verdi try to ""up the ante"" over the likes of Bellini, Donizetti, and Rossini; B) You don't like it when every square inch of the set is designed by consummate masters in the arts, C) you hate it when costumes are so richly damasked, emroidered, and adorned with jewel colors, from the soldier's uniforms to the pastel confections worn by the ladies straight from a Francois Bouchard, or Fragonard - Baroque painting, D) It irritates you when the chorus is so precisely on tempo that you actually identify the words being sung ; or you find it irksome to hear a soprano who can sing notes usually reserved for baritones, all the way up to glass shattering high D's, with apparent ease, nor do you particularly like to see and hear the first exquisitely perfected ""Pants Role"" you have ever experienced, actually steal the show with her own vocal pyrotechnics; E) that you are bored by one of the finest batons in this century, Abbado, over an orchestra bristling with  talent, joy and sense of purpose; or F) You just don't get what all the fuss is about with this Placido Domingo singing with youthful exuberance and happy confidence and melifluous majesty, tossing of nuances of tonality, timbre, vibrato, emotion,and beauty with every single note,every single gesture, stride, posture and facial expression- who draws you into the story , allows you to suspend disbelief, and thoroughly enjoy every scene. Or G) You don't understand the candlelight painters of the Utrecht School, like Terbruggen, or Honthorst, where faces and figures ""emerge"" from darkness into light; and , thus, A) Seeing paintings executed by old masters come to life before your eyes, for some inexplicable reason leaves you yawning ...Well then, this production is not for you.
I do agree with the other reviewers that the subtitles are a bit paltry...very sketchy indeed. However it does cause one to focus on the music which more than limns the story line - one of Verdi's strengths. That beign said, however, many of us liek to have a libretto in our hands. A lovely little booklet with historical notes about the opera and composer, alogn with information about the performers should not add that much to production costs. I suppose some bean counter cut corners here, thinking...""oh shoot; opera isn't all that well prized and adored...is it?"" Rule number one when producing an opera as gloriously perfected as this one is....keep the bean counters off the premesis with drawn swords.",1228780800,14,2655,4.886917960088692
7960142,5,B0000640T9,"There are several things that make this ""Ballo"" a very special item.  Domingo is in so many productions that I feel that many people take him for granted.  The voice can get a bit tight but he is, of course, a pushed up baritone.  What distinguished him  is that he is a superlative musician.  Watch his performance.  Does he ever watch the conductor? No. He knows the music so well  that he can give himself over totally to acting the drama. In addition, we have Reri Grist as Oscar.  She is also totally in the drama.  I think the slenderness of her soprano kept her from getting some meatier rolls but she is without question one of the great stars to come from America.  As Amelia we have Ricciarelli before her vocal decline.  A lovely lyric sound which got pushed into roles bigger than advisable.  I'm sure she is better than Barstow on the Solti set for having a sound suitable for the role.  In a minor role (one of the conspiritors) we have the incredible sounding Gwynne Howell, one of the great English bass voices.  Add all of this to the conducting of Abaddo and very attractive sets and you have a real winner in my estimation.  Watching these productions again and again, the good ones get better and the bad ones get worse.  This is one of the real treasures.",1219536000,7,1276,4.435344827586207
7960143,5,B0000640T9,"it's a tremendous performance of a very great opera. I can't find any fault in any of the performers-all were excellent.

Seeing and hearing a true Verdian conduct also adds another dimension that the Met performance just cannot equal.  Not to take anything from Levine, but Abbado is in a class by himself when it comes to Verdi. The orchestra becomes another voice with him conducting.",1187568000,3,387,4.848484848484849
7960144,5,B0000640T9,"Oscar, Reri Grist, was amazing. Her performance of Oscar was simply outstanding and a gem to watch.  She is physically able to endure the jumping and singing simultaneously which is difficult and was exceptionally successful at it.  Great actress with great voice as well.  I wish I had a recording of her singing ""Voices of Spring"".  Acting and singing extremely good for the entire cast and Placido Domingo?  What can I say except just great.  I've never seen or heard him in anything that was not exceptional.  I enjoyed the other beautiful voices especially the ""bad guys"" plotting to kill the king.

Great production and highly recommend purchasing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1176940800,4,669,5.12962962962963
