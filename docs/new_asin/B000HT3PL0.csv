8141244,4,B000HT3PL0,My kid love all the movies that came in the package. The only thing that I found to be lacking was that the Fernfully - The last rainforest DVD didn't have a spanish soundtrack. I know that it wasn't a feature in the item's description but nevertheless I was expecting it. My son loves Ice Ace and Fernfully. I only hope that another collection including Ice Age 2 will be released soon.,1213747200,,387,4.388888888888889
8141245,5,B000HT3PL0,"I bought this for my daughter, she has watched all of them and loves them.  It was a great price for all dvds.  The best part was I got Ferngully which was a movie from my generation.  It is a DVD collection for parents and children.",1209254400,,233,4.021739130434782
8141246,3,B000HT3PL0,This set is hard to beat considering you get 4 movies. We really liked Ice Age and Robots but did not care so much for the other 2 movies which I think are geared more to young children. We have 4 sons between the ages of 9 and 13.,1179792000,,231,3.7346938775510203
