223535,5,6300184900,"This is seventies TV at it's finest. Lindsay Wagner becomes a megastar instantly thanks to her touching performance as Jaime Sommers. In this two parter from the SMDM series, we go through the whole gambit of  emotions..love,tragedy,and loss. We demand her back and an icon is born. I  wholeheartly recommend this touching story to anyone who hasn't seen  it. Lindsay Wagner has EARNED her stardom.",941500800,4,398,5.092307692307692
223536,5,6300184900,The origin of the Bionic Woman is both romantic and tragic! Lee Majors and Lindsay Wagner have great chemistry together and the ensuing story really elevates this series like never before. The release of this video will have  fans thirsting for more uncut episodes of their favorite bionic couple.  Where's Bigfoot when you really need him huh? C'mon Universal we crave more  classic 70's bionic action!,929750400,16,403,5.075757575757576
223537,5,6300184900,she just keeps getting better.she out did Lee in the Bionic shows...her looks is timeless...,929577600,,92,5.2
223538,5,6300184900,"This is our introduction to the Bionic Woman, and the talented presence of Lindsay Wagner.  Originally a ""Six Million Dollar Man"" episode, it was thought that if Steve Austin had a girlfriend, and there were tragic  circumstances, that it would humanize the big lug.  Well, it works!  Lee  Majors does some fine acting here, as well as do a ""fair""  imitation of Bogart!  But it's Jaime Sommers you look at throughout this  two part episode.  She is so natural, and witty at this role, that it is no  wonder there was a sequel and, eventually a spinoff series made.  Richard  Anderson gives strong support as Oscar Goldman, the charming boss of OSI.  The only problem with this video is that it leaves you thirsting for more,  and Universal Studios has not released  any more!!  (So you know who to  email about this, right?)",919555200,18,824,4.65034965034965
223539,5,6300184900,"Anyone know how to get VHS of :Six Million Dollar Man episodes, etc. Cant find it anywhere!",918691200,,91,4.411764705882353
223560,5,6300184900,"I saw this movie in 1976 in Mexico,now i'm in the US,I think
there's no other show like this one in years(actually)specially
the SMDM,episodes that I can not find around the US,it was great to see Lee Majors,and Lindsay Wagner together,now at 38 I would like mi kids to see them to,it's time for Universal to take time
and display the entire episodes around the United States,hope
that Amazon.com could help on getting this started!!!!!!",1031961600,3,437,4.84
223561,4,6300184900,"I have this video...purchased at a local dealer...and it is NOT, NOT, NOT the full cut of the original two part episodes of ""The Six Million Dollar Man"". This is the SIFI Channels' (for lack of better example) cut or later syndication episodes. And, it's funny to me that this is called ""The Bionic Woman"" when, as we die-hard fans of the two shows would know, these are actually SMDM episodes. Oh well...Lindsay Wagners face probably sells better...Sorry Lee (Majors). And another thing...with the two series having remained in the top ten all through their respective runs, and their continued success even to this day in other countries...why Universal has not seen fit to put both series full and uncut on VHS and DVD?!?",1026864000,4,724,4.846774193548387
223562,5,6300184900,I am A very advit fan of the Bionic Women Series looking for more vidios if anyone can get them I would like them.,1020988800,2,114,3.7916666666666665
223563,5,6300184900,"The episodes of the Bionc Woman were truly memorable when I was growing up as a child. I am so glad that I acquired this tape as it brought back so many great memories when I loved the whole Bionic couple. My only regret is that the Bionic Woman series was not available in the VHS format in the United States. The PAl versions from the UK make it inaccessible for the Bionic fan like myself. There are certainly others who would like to enjoy this wonderful series such as the Bionic Woman. The 70s nostalgic feel is invaluable and the fact that this was one of the greatest shows in its heyday leaves me sad that there is a lack of suitable copy. If Amazon ever gets the selections from Universal on boxset,I am the first in line!!! A must have for the Bionic diehard.",1018915200,3,770,4.280821917808219
223564,4,6300184900,"This two part episode of ""Six Million Dollar Man"" is a real treat.  Just hearing Lee Majors sing is worth the price.  I can't believe that this show was the ""coolest"" in its time.  (Then again, I can't believe I'm 37!)  Majors and Wagner are good together, and the video makes you hunger to revisit some more of these episodes.  Why Universal has only released these particular shows is beyond me.  Universal Playback, their European distributor, has many episodes of both ""SMDM"" and ""Bionic Woman"" available, but in the PAL format.  It's time for Universal to open the vaults and make these shows available to fans in the U.S.  I'm sure there are many people like myself who want to see Jaime Sommers fight the Fembots and Steve Austin slug Bigfoot!  UNIVERSAL- get it together!",1016841600,11,779,4.711111111111111
223565,5,6300184900,"I was so excited to receive my video The Bionic Woman in the mail and it arrived quicker than expected!  Growing up in the 70's, she was my biggest hero and even today I love to watch this show.  The video had pretty good resolution and having no commercials is a bonus!  If you can get more episodes of the best show ever made, please do so.  I hope to one day own the entire series.  Very happy with this purchase, thank you!",1014422400,,427,4.096385542168675
223566,5,6300184900,I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE AND PURCHASED IT. I was one of those fans that watched it every week back in the 70's. I would reccomend any fan of scifi to see this series. Too bad that video companys can release crap like POKEMON but you can't have the entire series of the Bionic Woman. Columbia House said that they are thinking about releasing the rest of this series. After all they just released Wonder Woman's whole series. I love Jaime Sommers. She had one of the most lovable characters of anyone on television. 'Doomsday Is Tommorow' is one of my favorite episodes. Too bad there's no exciting shows today!!!,982800000,19,610,4.554545454545455
223567,5,6300184900,this video is a must have for either a lindsay wagner fan or the bionic woman. you get to see and terasure the origin of the bionic woman. the acting abilities of lindsay wagner and lee majors are what brought the 2  characters alive and keep them alive to deciated fans around the world. the  video is ageless and it keeps the action coming. you will be very pleased  if you purchase this video. it is highly reccommended to any bionic fan of  all ages.,961459200,4,454,4.305882352941176
223568,5,6300184900,i loved this timeless classic movie jamie sommers is superb and she was so wonderful in this movie and no other actress could have replaced her. thanks so much for discovering her and her talennts and bring back the  bionic woman at the scifi channel we miss her so much.. kevin taylor,947980800,4,285,4.480769230769231
7804837,5,6300184900,"FINALLY......at long last. Universal has announced that the Original Bionic Woman series will be available for $39.99 on October 19th. It is reported that it will include all Season 1 episodes (not the one pictured here as it is actually a Six Million Dollar Man episode packaged as the Bionic Woman, However, it may still appear as a bonus or cross over episode on this set ) Universal also reports it will be available in Do;by digital and in 1.78:1 anamorphic but this has yet to be confirmed. Supposedly, The Six Million Dollar Man is supposed to be available somethime soon as well but as an exclusive to Time-Life. Nevertheless, the long wait appears to be over.",1275696000,,668,4.717948717948718
7804838,5,6300184900,"This one is very good  For all those in the USA interested in buying an old seasons in complete form of the original bionic woman of the 1970's you can find it on the internet sites (turnthetvup) or the same sister company at (myoldtvshows), if you call or order the lady will respond to phone calls and email, and send you a complete and good copy since we cannot get it in the USA yet, SHE DID SEND ME MINE!!!! Coming from a robotics student and career oriented lady who looks similar to the original series girl, I can identify with the series. It was worth watching and I would use this version to complete my copy of the original series plus the movies they did with the six-million dollar man and Jamie later after the original series was finished, the piolet is great though.",1204416000,,782,4.393103448275862
7804839,5,6300184900,"i would like to go on record as agreeing with everyone else, that they need to produce region 1, united states dvd versions, of all the seasons, because it is unfair that europe has the opportunity to own them and we don't.  Please someone produce this for us, this would be a great addition to our collections, especially if you're like me and you feel like you have to have almost all of the shows you grew up watching because they just don't make them like they use to.",1164067200,3,472,4.303370786516854
7804840,5,6300184900,"This is a great intro to the Bionic Woman series, and also the Six Million Dollar Man. I grew up watching  these two classic shows. I can believe that they are not already out on dvd. But you know what. They are out on region 2 in the UK and Europe. For those of you out there not familiar with region 2 dvd formats, and PAL, they will not play on region 1 dvd players, in which we have in the US. Why Europe has them all and we in the US do not? I really don't have the answer to that. I wish I did. If you can get your hands on this tape, I recommend you do so. Its all we have, at least until Universal wakes up and decides to put these classic shows on dvd. But, when will that be?",1086134400,18,685,3.7569444444444446
7804841,4,6300184900,"At 32 years of age, I have to say that today's TV shows do not compare to the shows I watched as a child. One of my favorite shows as a kid, and heck, even today, may be The Bionic Woman. Lindsay Wagner is just a unique woman, no other actress compares. What happened to all those wonderful and imaginative TV shows like Six Million Dollar Man, Bionic Woman, and Wonder Woman? The only way to see them is reruns on TV. This tape is available, but who really buys VHS anymore? I want all of the Bionic Woman on DVD. The company that owns the rights to this show should realize they are sitting on a goldmine, and release it on DVD. I remember I had received the Six Million Dollar Man  and Bionic Woman dolls for Christmas one year, it was the best present ever. I wish I had kept those dolls.
I want to see Jaime Sommers run with the Bionic Dog. I want to see her fight the Bionic Bigfoot. I want to see her rip telephone books in half and jump from windows. But most of all, I want to see the lovely Lindsay Wagner whenever I please, simply by popping in the DVD.",1066867200,36,1064,4.090909090909091
7804842,5,6300184900,"I've had this release in my collection for ages and it is a good introduction to Jaime Sommers, The Bionic Woman.  However, this is not a good example of what was to come in her own series.  The episodes had a lot more action and first-class acting from Emmy-award winner, Lindsay Wagner.  The story lines varied from week to week and there was a lot of variety.  Lindsay did not want to be typecast, so she made sure she was impersonating someone different every week so that the audience would get used to her in different roles and it paid off; she has been featured in over 50 feature films and made-for-tv movies in the last 25 years.  Now Universal needs to get their act together and release DVD season sets of this classic series starring one of the most talented and busiest actresses on television.",1063497600,13,808,4.506849315068493
7804843,5,6300184900,"I love this video! Steve & Jamie were my favorites growing up! Someone needs to release all the Bionic shows on DVD. This is just a tease. I glad there are still so many die hard fans out there that agree, Bionic Fans unite!!",1060560000,12,225,4.136363636363637
7804844,5,6300184900,"Hello Bionic Woman Fans:  When I saw that the Bionic Woman was available on VHS I jumped and immediately ordered online, growing up I always looked at the Bionic Woman and so often times pretended I was bionic.  Jamie and Steve were wonderful together. The production company should think about putting the SMDM and BW on VHS or DVD, believe me I would be the first to buy all episodes at once, no peace mill mail for me, just give me all episodes of each.  I have checked with Columbia House Video and posed the same question, but to no avail they are waiting to hear from the production company.  I do hope at some point and time these episodes become available on VHS or DVD.  Thanks",1048032000,10,686,4.3700787401574805

7804846,5,6300184900,It is a great show. To see steve and jamie together was awsome. To see what jamie and steve ment to each other makes you understand there relationship better and to see how jamies accident tore steve and jamies relationship apart. He ended up having to give her up because she was rejecting her bionics and everytime she remembers steve she remembered the pain from the accident. the only thing is they need the 2nd part of jamie where steve thinks she's dead but she's not and roody had to block here memory of steve. Jamie learns her bionics and steve finds out she is alive. they need to get that tape out PLEASE!!!,1037491200,4,618,4.4298245614035086
