8491545,1,B0062Y4U36,"This video is a complete waste of money. There is no good video or audio, no live footage, nothing whatsoever produced by the band. It is video of a group of fans who think they are industry movers, wannabes, talking about how great the band is.

Duh......we know how great the band is ......and why......they are awesome writers and musicians, and put on a spectacular live show. We wanted to see some of that awesomeness in a new live video......which this product is definately not.

In case you need proof: I have my copy for sale in Amazon Marketplace for 1/3 new price. Not one person has inquired.

A completely useless work.

8491546,2,B0062Y4U36,"Live and Burn.  I bought this DVD thinking it's a current Coldplay concert album with some interviews of the band.  Not so!  It's a 2011 documentary with small still photos, pans over mixer boards and a stadium, short sound bite interviews with (staff?) people, and background music that is irritating in its repetition.  If you want to have everything (about) Coldplay, if you're into where Coldplay came from (England - not London), what they think about being famous and music (they like it - but there's stress), and repetion of brief video clips of a band that is fogged out so it could be anyone (not Coldplay - set extras), then this DVD is for you.  The UK Amazon.com review says it covers to the 2002 release of Rush of Blood to the Head.  Next time, I'lll look there before purchase.  Oh, and no DVD insert with photos or text.  What is the crem de la crem?  On the back of the DVD case, at the very bottom, in teeny tiny letters: ""This DVD is not authorised (British spelling) by Coldplay, their management or their record company.""  It's 60 minutes long and I've gone to Judge Judy at 40 minutes.  If the last 20 minutes are real music and real videos, or even a real interview, I'll change my review.  To a 3.  Hope this at least helps others to make an informed purchase.  But, perhaps you already are informed.  Why such a high mark of 2?  It is Coldplay afterall!",1334188800,3,1379,4.434262948207171
