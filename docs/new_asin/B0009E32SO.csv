2279789,5,B0009E32SO,"War in the pocket takes place just before the end of the one-year war.  It is told through the eyes of a young boy Al, who befriends a Zeon soldier who has infiltrated the colony on which the gundam is hidden.  The third main character is Chris, Al's next door neighbor, who unknown to Al is a Federation Test pilot.
The Federation is shown as a big bureaucracy except for Chris. The Zeons are developed a bit more and range from Bernie, who is shown as a nice, idealistic person, to a few hardened soldiers who while seem evil are really just doing their jobs, to the honorable commander who realizes the war is ending but is still faithful to his orders.

Because of Al the two pilots meet and a relationship starts to bloom. But unlike the 8th MS Team, the two pilots never realize who the other really is, and end up fighting each other at the end of the story.
While slower paced that other stories in the Gundam saga it is a good story and well worth watching.",1271894400,4,966,4.2967032967032965
2279790,4,B0009E32SO,"I've come to the Gundam party rather late in the grand scheme of things.  After years of loving mecha-based shows like Robotech and Voltron, I finally decided to attempt to devote to the ever-expanding Gundam universe.  Beginning with the original Mobile Suit series, I then ventured into the Zeta saga.  From there it was on to Wing, Seed and Seed Destiny.  Throughout this tour, I picked away at some of the smaller self-contained stories like the enjoyable 0083 Stardust Memory and this, the War in the Pocket (0080).

Before I get into the story itself, this new collection is basically a repackaged, re-release of the 2005 Complete Collection of the same name.  Ban Dai has been going to great lengths in 2009 to not only release the latest incarnations of the show (like Seed Destiny) but also to repackage many of the earlier efforts that have slipped through the proverbial cracks.

0080 is a two-disc collection that contains a total of six episodes.  Originally released back in 1989, War in the Pocket commemorated the ten-year anniversary of the Gundam franchise.  In the Gundam timeline, it takes place during the One-Year War.  Like the series name suggests, it is a rather personal account of how a much larger war affects even the smallest individuals in the farthest reaches.

In my opinion the show succeeds on many levels even over some of the better-reputed series (like Wing) on account of its flawless balance.  Like in real life, there isn't a good guy versus bad guy theme here so much as there are opposing views of individuals both convinced that they are doing what's right.

The story takes place entirely on a single colony (Side 6) and is presented through the eyes of a ten-year-old boy whose own involvement in the war should be limited to sketches of mobile suits and talk of rumors with his classmates around the lunch table.  When a Zeon Zaku gets shot down after an unsuccessful raid on a top-secret Federation base within the colony, his life makes a radical change.

Perhaps the show's greatest strength is its ability to build a sense of scale and grandeur of mobile suit combat since it is entirely ground-based and shown through the human perspective.  It is all too easy to lose sense of the power and size of the suits when they are engaged against the infinity of space.  Likewise, entire colonies have been destroyed in other Gundam series without a fraction of the remorse 0080 manages to establish by simply reminding the viewer that these are civilizations of human beings; kids who want nothing more than a day off of school and families who work their jobs to put food on the table.

Though on the short side as a whole, the presentation, pacing, and conclusion of this OVA are all nearly flawless.  The ending, while sad, is a testament to the consequences of war.  This is a very moving piece that balances dozens of heavy themes through the simplicity and innocence of youth.

I've become enamored with the Gundam franchise for its depth and richness and can honestly attest that 0080 is perhaps the most impactual entry to be found.  A must-have set for any Gundam collection and a solid piece of anime even for those outside of Gundam obsession.",1234310400,42,3200,4.759057971014493
2279791,4,B0009E32SO,"""MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM 0080: WAR IN THE POCKET"" takes place in December, Universal Century 0079. Literally the final month of the One Year War between the Earth Federation versus the Principality of Zeon.

In Side 6 is the civilian colony of Libot which is neutral and have not been picking any sides between both the Earth Federation or Zeon but the Zeon are dispatched to the colony after the Earth Federation were seen, trying to fly and sneak something top secret to the colony.

For Zeon pilot Bernie, all he wants is to be the best pilot out there and assumes things will be safe on the neutral planet while on a mission, that is until the Federation mobile suits come out with guns ablazing.

Bernie's Zaku crashes into a dense forest-like area and is discovered by a young boy named Al. A 10-year-old kid who is so starry eyed towards mobile suits and space battles.

Al tends to get into arguments (and bad grades) in school because his interest is so much into mobile suits and space battles that he ends up helping Bernie and actually assisting the Zeon Cyclops Team, not knowing that he's being used.

To make matters much more interesting, his next door neighbor that he adores, Christina is back at home and has join the Earth Federation but not knowing that she is testing the new Gundam Alex, the new Gundam that Bernie and the Cyclops Team are after.

""MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM 0080: WAR IN THE POCKET COMPLETE COLLECTION"" offers all six OAV's on two discs. Re-released in 2005, this anime OAV series released back in 1989 was the first Gundam OAV series and also the first Gundam series not given to the co-creators to direct. This led to the side story that didn't deal with Newtypes but more towards the civilian perspective of the war.

I know that ""MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM 0080: WAR IN THE POCKET"" is a classic and many fans adored the storyline because it showcased the perspective of war from a young child's perspective and how war pretty much sucks!

I enjoyed the overall OAV series but personally, I had some problems with it and mainly it centering around the 10-year-old Al.

For example, in the first episode, Al sees Bernie's Zaku crashing from his school yard.  Automatically, he knows where it fell (in a dense forest area).  For days, this Zaku has remained stationary in that forest area with no one ever finding it but Al.  I can't believe that no one has found this Zaku (which is still somewhat functional) except Al and that bugged me a little.

Then there was a segment where Bernie and Al are in space suits (after breaking into a top secret area).  As if there are space suits and helmets for short kids instantly available in a working area.  I know that it was important to show this bond between Al and Bernie but this bugged me a little as well.

And then there is the final episode, a great episode but how a ten year-old kid can cover so much ground running versus an adult to get from point A to point B in time for a battle, again...that bugged me a little.

And of course, how Al seems to sneak into top secret areas and covertly gets information. Very stealthy!  Granted, I know this is me zeroing in on Al too much but this is a ten year old kid, not Solid Snake (ie. Metal Gear Solid).

But aside from these little nitpicky things that I found that in no means does it detract from the overall series because ""MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM 0080: WAR IN THE POCKET"" is a series full of action, humor, tragedy, happiness, sadness and warmth.

One of the things that I liked was how the screenwriter focused on the relationship between Al and Bernie which more or less becomes like his big brother or father figure that he looks up to.  And then showing the contrast of him being miserable at home, without a father figure and always complaining of his mother and you see how it affects him deeply, even in school.

But his emotions and his perspective of war from the beginning of meeting up with Bernie and then leading up to the final episode and to see how Al is affected was truly emotional and definitely gives a certain perspective of the war from a civilian.

It's a pretty interesting storyline to have that civilian perspective but also a perspective of fear after helping the enemy, the ramifications that come with it.  The animation really captured Al's emotions quite well.

I have to admit that by Takayama Fumihiko directing and Mikimoto Haruhiko responsible for character designs, ""MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM 0080: WAR IN THE POCKET"" had this special feeling of being something different compared to what was released around that time or before and just giving fans something fresh visually and in storytelling.

All in all, this complete collection on DVD can be found online for a good price and for any Gundam fan, this is a must have in their collection.

Definitely recommended!",1218153600,2,4819,4.579743888242142
2279792,4,B0009E32SO,"Some boys really want to fight in wars. Al is one of these mischievous boys, who gets involved in a deadly war involving the Federation and Zeon. Although he thinks that he's helping a Zeon soldier in a good cause, Gundam 0080 proves that even his best friends can kill each other, especially if they are on opposing sides.

The story focuses on Al, who loves to watch giant robots fight. He looked for a Gundam at an airport at his colony, but he could only manage to take pictures of a big metal storage crate. In a circumstance of sheer luck, Gundam and Zeon robots begin to fight at the colony. Al, rushing over to a fallen Zeon robot, finds a soldier named Bernie. He trades his photos with Bernie for a Zeon badge.

Bernie turns in the photos, and suddenly was promoted to the Special Forces team. The Zeon Special Forces team was assigned to destroy the Federation's Gundam at the colony. Al finds the Zeon group and works with Bernie to find the Gundam. However, he doesn't know that his next-door neighbor, Kensington, is a Gundam pilot.

Although the plot is complicated, the characters are set in difficult, violent situations. Eventually, the Zeon fight the Gundam, and no matter what outcome arises, Al will be forever scarred.

This is a sad, but touching look at the brutality and inhumanity of war. Like the American movie ""Syriana"", the characters get caught in situations where, even when they think they are doing the right thing, somebody always pays a price. The ending is tragic. The scriptwriters and director did an amazing job, even without frontman producer Tomino at the helm. Probably the only thing they should have taken out was the unnaturally cheery music at the end, which spoiled the depressing ending.",1195344000,3,1736,4.7194719471947195
2279793,5,B0009E32SO,"I just finished watching Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the pocket, and i must say it is one of the best anime's i have ever seen.  This OAV paints a deep, and more personal picture of the one year war, than i have ever seen in a Gundam sereies.  I haven't cared this much about any character in a Gundam series since 08th MS Team.  I usually watch Gundam just for the giant robot action, but I am moved with so many emotions after finishing this.  Such a great job was done with character development.  With each episode, you grow to know the characters, and care for them.  I don't want to give anything away, but this anime is beautiful, and tragic, and makes the one year war seem just like that, a war, and not just a bunch of robots fighting for no particular reason like in other Gundam series.  I am very impressed with this Gundam series, and would absolutely reccomend it to any Gundam, or just plain anime fan.  The animation is awesome!  I didn't really like all of the music, but I was so moved by this story.  Watch this!  Its worth the price of admission.  This has one of the best stories in any Gundam series I have seen, and will touch you on a deep level.  Its not just great action and animation; this series has a plot, and a message, and it is just incredible.  Buy this anime; you will not be dissapointed.",1193356800,3,1330,4.247011952191235
2279794,5,B0009E32SO,"There's something a little bit special about War in the Pocket that seperates it from the rest of the Gundam Series. Whereas the other Gundam shows seem to focus mainly on Action and Politics, this one is interesting because the story takes place on a much smaller scale.

The story is still about War and Robots, but this time on a much more personal level. It shows how War effects everyone, how it changes people, and how it is not fun or glorious like it is potrayed be videogames, books, and movies. Rather, war is an ugly thing in which people die for the wrong reasons.

This show is about how the one year War effects Al, a harmless youth who literally carries the ""war in pocket"". He obsesses over mobile suits, the war, and violence until the events that occur cause him to realize that War is not such a great thing.

The series is short- only 6 episodes. But I think helps make it great. It is more detailed and developed than most movies, yet you can still watch it in one sitting.",1172275200,6,994,4.3621621621621625
2279795,4,B0009E32SO,"Gundam 0080 is a great anti-war anime. Now don't take that wrong. When I first heard that it was an anti war anime I kind of lost interest in it. Then I watched it and loved it. It has tons of (meaningful) action, and the animation is very good. There isn't a whole lot in the way of objectionable content besides some strong language, blood/violence, and some very brief non explicit magazine nudity.",1130284800,10,401,4.506849315068493
2279796,3,B0009E32SO,"Gundam 0080 is a 6 episode long OVA covering the events surrounding a little kid who get's thrown into a Zeon guerrila operation to destroy the RX-78 NT1 Alex Gundam. It's one of the slowest and least action filled gundam series ever.

It was semi interesting the first time I watched it, but I honestly can't think of a good reason for owning this set unless you're a huge fan of the RX-78 NT1 and MS-18 Kempher, notably two of the coolest mechs the gundam universe has ever known.

The ending was very unsatisfactory for me, a rare miss for a Gundam ending.

2279841,5,B0009E32SO,Mobile Suit Gundam 0080 War in the pocket is a war epic from a child's perspective and clearly demonstrates it with the pain and loss of the Main character Bernard Wiseman from Alfred's perspective.

2279845,5,B0009E32SO,"I was in need of a break from studying for finals last year when I picked this up at a Hastings in Nacogdoches,Texas. It was 21 dollars plus tax.  A year later, I cruised onto Amazon and saw it in the 'other customers also viewed' spot, and noticed a considerably heftier price tag attached to what I presumed was a bargain at the time.  130+ dollars for two discs? Without an art book, a figure, or even a poster or something?  Wow.

Don't get me wrong, this is a nice little series to have-- but I couldn't imagine paying triple digits for it; I'm not even into Mobile Suit Gundam ( I used to watch it on Toonami way back when, but that doesn't count )  but this is one of my favorites by far. Having said that, 0080 War in the Pocket  is a very 'human' MS series, exploring the effects of war on a more personal note through the eyes of a child. Because the protagonist is a child, the series has something of a tragic overtone; The entire time you seem to be playing the role of 'parent' knowing full well that the wonderment Al sees in the conflict is naiive and unrealistic. It's hard to see children slowly face the facts-of-life, especially in the context of war.  At the outset it seems about as loaded as any MS series, but after a few episodes, the social circumstances surrounding the cast are driven home in an interesting and heart-wrenching way.

Anyway, if you can find this little set somewhere for a reasonable price, don't leave the place without it--you won't be sorry.",1404604800,,1489,4.389090909090909
2279846,5,B0009E32SO,"Thoughtful, more deliberate storytelling sits well with this 6 episode OVA about a young boy who dreams of mobile suits and space battles until he witnesses the reality of war first hand. I really enjoyed this series. Some might be bothered by the slower pacing, but this really shouldn't be too much of an issue for most people seeing as it is only 6 episodes... Once again the main cast were, for the most part, morally ambiguous. So don't feel strange if you end up rooting for the ""antagonists"" of this series. I know I was. The animation was decent, mech designs were amazing for this time period, the intro and outro really fit the themes of this particular story. Also (Slight Spoiler maybe??)  the build up to the final battle was done PERFECTLY, and had me feeling helpless during the  very tragic circumstance.

A must for anyone who already knows they like Gundam.",1399766400,,875,4.6688311688311686
2279847,5,B0009E32SO,"Just like other reviewers have said, it's the definitive Gundam for non-Gundam fans. It's amazing how accessible this anime is, yet at the same time remains an unparalleled masterpiece which will warm the hearts of fans, newcomers and non-fans. Without a doubt it is the pinnacle, the best of the UC OVAS: Stardust Memory is good, but not great (some of the middle parts are and the ending ruined it), 08th MS Team is generic and mostly boring (I'm one of the few who doesn't see what the big deal was) and as for Unicorn... I'm still not sure whether or not it's better than 0083. As such, War in the pocket excels in what these other series could not: most of its characters are likeable, it handles a simple story very well, and it has a tragic yet cathartic and satisfying ending which will leave you dysfunctional for a day. It's great, it's beautiful, it's a must-have.",1386460800,2,875,4.544303797468355

2279870,5,B0009E32SO,"Even for Gundam, this one is pretty heavy.

In contrast to many Gundam series, the main character is not some test pilot who stole a fancy mobile suit, nor a soldier.  He cannot even operate a mobile suit.  He is just a grade-school child during the One Year War, and he learns some very bitter things.

Gundam 0080 is a tragic bildungsroman that turns the protagonist into a man not by forcing him to grow up so much as by (somewhat literally) murdering his childhood.  Gundam has always focused to some extent on the civilian cost of war, but this time around the protagonist does not get to take up arms against evil.  All he gets to do is watch his best friends kill each other.  This show is, ultimately, all about the effects of war on the minds of children, and in this it is very thorough.  Even the opening credits hint at this, with a scrolling mural of children's drawings of mobile suit battles.  Schoolchildren get into arguments about whether Zeon or the Federation has cooler weapons, and take sides like sports fans, right up until they see their ""teams"" bring death and misery upon their colony.

The quality of the artwork surprised me.  It is much more detailed than in the earlier Gundam series.  It seems to be going for a very realistic, gritty, up-close kind of detail.  One of the pilots even keeps a canteen of booze and an issue of Playboy stashed in his cockpit.  Mobile suits and warships look like dirty, scuffed-up machines with a level of mechanical detail that takes them out of the realm of shiny sci-fi weaponry and makes them evocative of real military hardware:  Marred, dirty, blatantly functional in purpose and design, and looking like it's just been through a war.  No tank should have a shiny coat of wax after a year of worldwide war, and nor should a Zaku or a Magellan-class cruiser.  It'll give you a lot to look at.

Beautifully drawn and deeply poignant, with an unexpectedly powerful human focus for a franchise that usually just gets lumped into ""giant robot anime""; this is arguably much closer to Grave of the Fireflies than Gigantor.  Possibly the meatiest, most palpable story in the whole Universal Century timeline.",1359331200,15,2170,4.663157894736842

Al's neighbor is actually the test pilot of the new machine. As this story unfolds their lives will be changed forever.

With a story set at the end of the original One Year War, this is a much more personal & intimate side story that focuses almost entirely on characters and their perspective of war.

2279878,5,B0009E32SO,"As far as the Universal Century goes, many titles in this Gundam universe offer vivid storytelling against the back-drop of war between the Earth Federation and the Principality of Zeon. Each of them provides insight into the human condition, where war transforms friends in enemies, adversaries into lovers, and nothing is set firm in black or white. Of all of series, 0080 tells the best story of all; how a child first sees the war, and how then how the reality of war changes him forever.

Released as an OVA addition to the Universal Century Gundam universe back in 1989, 0080 follows Al, a ten-year-old boy living in the neutral colony of Lobot in Side 6, left mostly unaffected by the One Year War raging on around it. His views on the war are similar to many children: debating which side is better with his classmates (good guys vs. bad guys) and fascination with the mobile suits.

Al's life changes when he meets Bernie, a rookie Zeon mobile suit pilot, who was shot down in the midst of a mission to raid a secret Federation facility and destroy the mobile suit within. Al also meets his neighbor Chris, unaware that she is the Federation test pilot for the very mobile suit Bernie was sent to destroy. Chris and Bernie take interest in each other, unaware of each other's affilation, which sets the stage for the truly moving themes that set this series apart from its peers.

0080, in my opinion, is unparalleled by any other Gundam series or side-story in the method that it tells its story. Each character has their own intentions, their own personalities and beliefs, fleshed out in the best way that animation can. There is no good or evil in this series; no preconceived notions of who's right and who's wrong, only that what we experience in life will change us, for better or for worse.

I cannot recommend a better title in the Universal Century setting. If you do not watch anything else Gundam, watch this one! You will not regret!",1273104000,2,1955,4.641618497109826

8059230,5,B0009E32SO,Love this Gundam series.  Was planning to wait for the Blu-ray release but have been hearing it will be going for quite a bit so I decided to go with the DVD release instead.  You don't need to know much about the Gundam universe to get into this one it's a easy story to jump into that focuses more on the relationships between the characters.  If you want to watch something with all out Gundam battles this won't be for you.  This has a few battles but not as much as other series.,1498521600,,484,4.172043010752688
8059231,5,B0009E32SO,"Glad that this has been reissued this year. My old VHS copy is still good, but finding a VHS player nowadays is like Spike and Jet going to earth in Cowboy Bebop to find a Betamax...",1496620800,2,182,4.083333333333333
8059232,4,B0009E32SO,Bought this re-release thinking the quality would be better than my Anime Legends release I already had. The audio is slightly better on the Anime Legends copy.,1491264000,,160,4.962962962962963
8059233,5,B0009E32SO,"This was one anime I missed back when it aired on Toonami in North America (I saw half of one episode). Forgot about it then saw it on Amazon and decided to give it a try for nostalgia. Really glad I did. It's well told, gives a nice perspective of the battle from the citizens viewpoint, and is short and direct. It's a tv series but I see people call it an OVA and it really is more in line with that. A great mini series that I would recommend. FYI, I am not a huge Gundam fan but I still loved it. I would recommend you try it if you have any interest in anime from the 90s.",1487808000,2,578,3.865546218487395
