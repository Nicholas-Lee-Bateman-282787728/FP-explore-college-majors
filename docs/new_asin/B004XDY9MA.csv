4495332,3,B004XDY9MA,"The first part on Rome was very good. The Sienna/Tuscany part was good, the rest not what I was looking for (too much about the wine making). Overall I gave it a 3, okay.",1384992000,,170,4.029411764705882

4495337,5,B004XDY9MA,I can rate all of Burt Wolf travel videos the same good listening and good watching. Informative but fun. Burt adds his own personality to the travel and we enjoy it. Loved the little historical info passed along in Burt's style.,1364601600,,229,4.609756097560975
4495338,5,B004XDY9MA,"I enjoy it as it not doing this and doing that travel program. Burt gives you the flavors of Rome/Italy. Having been to Rome, Tuscany and Venice as few times I would not recommend it a travel information, but I will recommend to those have visited Italy and something to remember.",1346544000,,280,4.509803921568627
4495339,3,B004XDY9MA,"Not the most exciting presentation, together with bad jokes",1419292800,,59,5.666666666666667

4495342,1,B004XDY9MA,"I stopped watching when he ascribed the Copernican theory to Giordano Bruno.  This is very elementary high school material, not the proverbial rocket science.  His mistakes on panna cotta and gnocchi were also irritating.",1410652800,,221,5.470588235294118
4495343,1,B004XDY9MA,A very bad travel show. Seems to be Wolf wanted a free vacation on the company and no more. The 30 minutes at a ski resort was so boring and a waste and he has no idea how to really get to the heart of a trip to a European city.,1407196800,,228,3.4901960784313726
4495344,3,B004XDY9MA,"I was disappointed in this video as I had seen one of his previous video's.  This one did not hold to the same standard.  I expected coverage on the ease of starting a business and how government works or does not work to help businesses and especially out of country investors.  I did liked his historical presentation on the city, however.",1406764800,,341,4.557377049180328
4495345,2,B004XDY9MA,"Having been to Italy, I thought they could have shown so much more of the country than they did.  Most of it was about Rome and it gave you very little information on anything.",1402272000,,176,4.176470588235294
4495346,5,B004XDY9MA,As always Burt Wolf lends an interesting look at what ever he presents and his presentation of Italy is no different.. Great tips.. lovely photography.. would recommend to anyone thinking about visiting Italy.,1398643200,,209,5.363636363636363
4495347,4,B004XDY9MA,"Enjoyed the tour of Rome and Tuscany.  I don't recall seeing the footage of Milan in this Amazon Instant Video.  You see the different sites of Rome, and visit eateries and wine-making facilities.  Will watch it again.  It's a pleasant, light introduction to this part of the world.",1395878400,,282,4.8125
4495348,3,B004XDY9MA,He seemed rather bored with places he visited. The only time he showed any enthusiasm was when drinking wine. I purchased this dvd because I had enjoyed his shows on TV. Would not purchase any more of his merchandise.,1395100800,,217,4.589743589743589

He has a good sense of humor .",1485475200,,88,3.4
8446808,1,B004XDY9MA,"Not much substance, just promoting a few restaurants. How can you have a guide on Rome and not include or mention St. Peter's?",1467331200,,126,4.521739130434782
