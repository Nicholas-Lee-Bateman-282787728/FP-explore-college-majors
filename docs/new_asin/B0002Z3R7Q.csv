Then, during the beginning monologue, Mr. Steve Allen specifically says, ""for the next hour..."" making the viewer believe that the film is not the printed 30 minutes, but now, it's 60 minutes.  Well, the truth is, it's neither.  This is the only problem with this title.  The truth is, the film is almost exactly 37 minutes.  So if you plan on doing anything with this film that requires you to know the actual length in time, do not go by what the box says nor by what Steve Allen says; they both lie.  But once you get passed that, you're in for a fun-filled treat of laughs for 37 minutes.  Highly recommended.",1392076800,,764,4.293706293706293
