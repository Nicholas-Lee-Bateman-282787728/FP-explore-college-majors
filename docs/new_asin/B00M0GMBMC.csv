7352649,5,B00M0GMBMC,"This is an OFFICIAL release lassies, @Outlander_Starz the OFFICIAL Outlander twitter page just posted the link to this item. It's the REAL DEAL. It's not a scam, and about the ""Thai thing"", well, it means that it is dubbed and subbed in Thai, nothing more to it than that.

Obviously it's in it's original language, and I'm sure in English subbs too. Possibly and hopefully in Spanish too, but the listing just doesn't say that yet--I'm sure now that you've all pointed that out it'll be fixed. Dinna fash yerselves, just order the damn thing already. hahaha!

As for the show itself, the series is AMAZING, the books are the bomb, and you should buy this, NOW! Sam Heughan (Jamie Fraser) and Caitriona Balfe (Claire Beauchamp Randall Fraser) are amazing in it, as is the entire cast. Trrruly a great show and a fabulous story based on the books by Diana Gabaldon. I cannot wait to get this and bring Jamie (Sam Heughan) home with me.",1421712000,61,934,4.620481927710843

7352651,5,B00M0GMBMC,"I have never enjoyed a book to movie or series as much as this.  Ron Moore and the superb team of writers, producers as well as the entire cast and crew have done what most thought would not be possible.  By bringing much of the depth of Diana Galbadon's exquisite books to the screen, more people will be able to experience the pure magic of the series.  The absolute breathtaking beauty of Scotland is prominently featured.  The costumes, weaponry and locations seem so authentic offering proof that no one involved took the task of creating this show lightly.  Seeing it in HD now has just had me floored!  It is so crisp and the colors and sound...ah, there's just nothing better.",1421712000,,684,4.6115702479338845

7352653,5,B00M0GMBMC,"This is clearly the first half of Season 1, as it is clearly labeled Volume 1.  Bar none, one of the very best productions I have ever seen on television.  I fully intend to own it and watch it often. Amazing story, beautifully written and performed.  Got my husband hooked on the book series and he has now read seven out of eight.  Don't miss this one.  The production values would support double the price, in my opinion.",1421712000,27,424,4.384615384615385
7352654,5,B00M0GMBMC,"The title and the review section clearly states that this is Season 1, Volume 1 and that there is space for volume 2. I have just seen that Diana Gabaldon says this is on official release. I love the books and the series, but the price will have to come down before I even put in a pre-order. $39 for 1/2 of the first season is too much for me.",1421712000,433,344,3.9285714285714284

I seen each episode almost every day until the new one came out that is how hooked I am. My husband thinks I'm crazy :) I still have a few books to complete but the series Is just as exciting as the books I'm going crazy just having to wait for the new season in April .

I did more research and this is a legit product. I apologize to anyone who may have been influenced by my negative review. Changed to 5 stars because I love the books/series, though I will personally wait until the full season comes out to purchase.

Total scam! The second half of season 1 doesn't even start until April.  There's no way it can be released on DVD or blu - ray in March.  At least it's an easy catch.",1421712000,43,426,4.3

Just be forewarned that digital copy is unavailable outside of the UK, so if you're buying this set in the hopes of adding it to your digital library, you will be sorely disappointed. Were it not for that, I would give this set 5 stars.",1532476800,,351,4.333333333333333
7352660,5,B00M0GMBMC,Outlander is AWESOME! Caitriona Balfe just sucks you in and never lets go. Supported by an amazing cast it's a great period piece that keeps you involved in the story.

7352682,4,B00M0GMBMC,"One can't help but get drawn in.  The twists and turns keep you guessing!  While I am not a prude, I do feel they could have shown a greater degree of modicum and decency regarding the ridiculously numerous "" sex scenes"".  Honestly, instead of the somewhat graphic nature, I feel it could have been more tastefully executed by eluding to the obvious rather than giving a nearly complete show.  It certainly is NOT a movie you would feel comfortable watching with a younger audience.",1528156800,,482,4.7023809523809526
7352683,2,B00M0GMBMC,"The production values are good. But the story line gets worse and worse. It turns out, I hate romance. I hate that she's in all these fancy dresses. Really? Who's paying for all of that for this woman who just shows up out of nowhere? The worst was the multiple attempted rape scenes (again and again and again in just the first season), including one in which we get a flash of her sexy behind. There is absolutely nothing sexy about rape, and sexualizing it is abhorrent. When Jamie bursts in to declare the attacker get away from his wife, I was done: Dude, shoot the attacker now. End of story.",1528156800,,598,4.396396396396397
7352684,3,B00M0GMBMC,"Geillis Duncan was my favorite character from the first book. She was a hero during the witch trial as she decided to incriminate herself in a theatrical performance of witchness in front of the town's people. She didn't want Claire her friend to be burned. There are quite a few things different in the film version compared to the book. Of course the books are better and specifically Geillis was an extremely brave, enigmatic strong character in the book. Geillis was basically Claire's only female friend and their friendship was closer in the book even if Claire was against the murder. The book also makes Jamie a more psychologically complicated character.",1527984000,,663,4.981981981981982
7352685,5,B00M0GMBMC,I had read the book and Season 1 Collector's Edition of the DVD did not disappoint. It was wonderful and followed the book really well.

7352688,2,B00M0GMBMC,I love the story line but the sexual content deminished the actual story. This was nothing more than soft porn and not necessary for the story. I won't be watching.,1527638400,2,164,4.5

7352690,3,B00M0GMBMC,Watching this series is to similar to watching porn. So many explicit sex scenes prevent you from enjoying to story...,1527552000,,118,4.95
7352691,2,B00M0GMBMC,"I wanted to like this show, but I found the crude and vulgar sex scenes distasteful. I don't need to watch it to understand it's a part of life.

7352696,5,B00M0GMBMC,"I could do without the graphic sex scenes because it makes it awkward to watch this with others or even recommend it. Besides this, it is a unique, surprisingly entertaining series with great acting. It's clear why there are almost ten thousand positive reviews about it. It's very appealing to women who like fantasy. There's a bit of actual history thrown in too.",1525910400,,365,4.809523809523809

7352699,1,B00M0GMBMC,"I am definitely in the minority in my writing for this - so-called story. I gave it 7 episodes and found myself wanting to see the main char die in many different ways.

it is pornographic and too explicit. Hollywood trash.",1520640000,,331,4.426229508196721
7352731,5,B00M0GMBMC,"I bought this DVD during the Christmas 2017 holidays when Walmart had them for $5.00 or $7.88 to get people into their doors for the Christmas season.  I've heard some basic information about this series (probably from one of the award shows on TV) and I really enjoy period pieces, so I was intrigued.  After 3 months of sitting on this DVD, I actually had a little time to view this.  I've never heard of any of the actors and ended up binged watching the Season 1, volume 1.  It was a little slow at first to introduce the characters, but eventually picked up speed as the more of the story unfolds.  The movie writers did such a fine job with each character that it made me cared about what happens to each of the characters, whether they were good or bad guys, major or minor parts.  I felt like I was reading a book instead of watching a movie.  I commend each of the actors who did a phenomenal job in bringing each character to life.  The set people did an amazing job finding shooting locations that complemented and told such a rich story that I felt as though I was there in all the beauteous, overcast, muddy, bloody glory.  And the costumes ... I must say that the costumes are exquisite in simplicity and also in the more formal wear.  The love scenes in the movie was very intimate and sweet and done very well.  Once you watched the first DVD, you'll want to see more.  But most of all, thank the original book writer, Diana Gabaldon, who did an amazing job telling a story and weaving historical events into the story line.  Great characters, set, costumes, acting, and story.",1520640000,,1593,4.414383561643835

7352740,5,B00M0GMBMC,"This is an incredible, authentic historical-fiction television series based on the first of eight books authored by Diana Gabaldon.  We had watched the first three episodes by the time we departed for England & Scotland in April 2017.  Loved being at Glencoe in the Highlands - home to my Clan MacDonell.  There are 16 episodes in Season 1.  There are some pretty explicit violent and sexual scenes in Episodes 15 and 16 that are difficult to watch, and I definitely think they could have been toned down for television.  In fact, the description of events in the book ""Outlander"" was not as graphic as was the movie.  With that being said, I would still highly recommend the series (which at this time has completed three seasons -- one for each corresponding volume).  Season 4 will be out in late 2018.

But from Lallybrook on, it is a very, very poor adaptation from the book and very powerful 'scenes' and parts of the book are left out. Very shallow treatment and very moving pieces are not there. Disappointing. Clair (Caitriona Balfe) is insipid and poorly played by the actress. (Although the author deals poorly with developing the depth of this character). Jamie, of course gorgeous, however (Sam Heugan) is excellent and is really what the books are about.

7352793,4,B00M0GMBMC,"I like this series. This review is about S1-S3.  It's based on historical facts such as the Jacobite Rebellion and some really interesting look on how the highlanders lived during those times (having a Chief and a War Chief and how they collect 'rent' and the conflict between the redcoats and such.) It also gives a good sense of cultural difference between the highlanders and the English & French (this is the 1700s when sex is everywhere and a taboo.) However, this is a LOVE story that cross time and country, so the focus is about the main characters. When i say Love, i meant LOVE. How spectacular it is for someone to love another so deeply that it's so gut wrenching? Their love seems so unrealistic but at the same time, it's so nice to watch a couple who has each other's heart and soul.

Pros:
-Historical insight of cultural differences and way of life
-Love that knows no bounds
-Gorgeous sets and landscapes that is both mystical and breath-taking
-Close to accurate description of costumes.
-Addressing homosexuality during this time period
-Medicinal limitation and diseases during the 1700s
-Action packed
-I've come to love the main characters for their respect for one another.

Cons:
-too much sex scenes (so no kids allowed)
-some details are extremely gory (battle scenes, sex scenes, prison scenes.)
-slow moving (i guess if you're going to make a 800+ pages book into a tv show, it has to move slow)
-too much filler in between critical scenes
-It seems as though the heroine here (Claire) is constantly getting herself into trouble and ultimately someone dies or gets hurt as a consequence. She only ever redeems herself when it comes to healing, but even being a healer has gotten herself in trouble plenty of times. However, the men in the show always saves the day or dies for the cause.

This is all my personal opinion and i understand if not everyone agrees. :) Bottom line is that this is a good show (aside from all the erotic scenes) and i'll continue to watch it. I can't wait to see what they do in America! BTW, i never read the books.",1515542400,,2073,4.640326975476839

7352796,5,B00M0GMBMC,"I sort of agree at times it is soft porn, my only problem is it happens to often.  But it is not sex as it shows the soul deep love they have, for me, 62+, they just need to cut back on how often they show it, they do a great job most of the time, and often, with the deep connecting looks they give each other and please do not cut out those no words needed looks. As to plot I find no problem but maybe if one is a fan of the books you read between the lines that one who has not read the books is unable to follow a lot of the plot.

7352798,2,B00M0GMBMC,"What truly is a great miniseries turned into a nightmare of  porn. It seems Hollywood once more relies on porn to depict what was a great love story. Im not sure what is more disturbing, the Hollywood directors who reveal their distorted and raunchy sense of human love and sexuality,  or an audience that is so hooked on porn it can't watch a great production without it!  I wanted to recommend this show to everyone but the raw sex makes that impossible, Such a shame the nudity and explicit sex was so demeaning to the viewers, actors And production crews,  I wish directors and producers would realize there are many many viewers who would rather they watch their porn in a dark theater, not inflict it on us at at home with the family.",1515024000,4,740,4.5

I did not find it to be soft porn though it was very sexual it was tender and the obvious culmination of a new love came though for me as full of tenderness, pathos, and even courage.  I though both actors handle what must of been a difficult series of scenes very well. They were very convincing in their trepidation and awkwardness with each other as it began and quite sweet and touching in their evolving passion and love. What woman wouldn't want a man to tell her ""you have my name, my clan, my family and if need be the protection of my body"" The giving of the pearls, the beautiful dress and how it was obtained, even the dastardly Dougal trying to horn in on Jamies now wife made for a very entertaining episode. I've watched it several times now and even on re-watching found nothing pornographic in it as to me for it to be porn it would have to be degrading and there was simply nothing degrading to either actor in their performances.",1514937600,5,987,4.364130434782608

My wife and I made the mistake of basing our initial decision on the high rating and ignoring reviews due to possible spoilers. Now having gone in and looked at other reviews, I'm glad we didn't waste any more time hoping it would get better (cleaner). Deep exploitation of intimate and/or horrific details does not make a good story better, but only corrupts it. The high ratings is an indicator that our culture has become callous and accepting of it. What happened to the days when one could blush?",1514851200,3,595,4.6761904761904765
7352807,5,B00M0GMBMC,"This show is incredibly well done and as huge fan of the books I appreciate the effort that has clearly been taken to translate Diana Gabaldon's work to television. Outlander is atmospheric, beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted (for the most part) and it's truly a series you can get lost in. I appreciate just how authentic and believable everything is, from the costumes and sets to the gorgeous filming locations and the music, ect. I absolutely LOVE Sam Heughan as Jamie, he is spot on for the role and does a fantastic job bringing Jamie to life! I've personally been less impressed with Caitriona Balfe's portrayal of Claire, however. I'm not saying that she isn't a great actress, I just don't feel as though she is right for the role of Claire... she's grown on me a bit though but when I first starting watching this series, it was hard to accept her as Claire. She doesn't fit the image of Claire that I have in my head from reading the books. First of all she doesn't look how Claire is supposed to look (Claire has outrageously curly light brown hair and is shorter and curvier) and it's taken me a while to get past that. She's way too tall compared to Sam to be playing Claire: there is supposed to be a significant height difference between them. Sam is 6' 3"" (correct for Jamie) but Caitriona is 5' 10"" which isn't her fault at all obviously. I think that perhaps she's just not properly cast for the role... though I do understand that not all casting decisions can be perfect. Actually many of the actors are way too tall like the actor who plays Murtagh: Jamie's height is supposed to stand out majorly. I apologize for sounding too critical of Caitriona because I'm sure she's playing Claire the best that she can and she does have moments where she is great. It's not her as actress that is the problem, it's just I have a hard time comparing her to Claire in the books and not seeing the differences and being critical. Sorry for being picky... Book-Claire is just simply such a unique character that would be incredibly difficult for anyone to translate to screen so I do commend Caitriona on her effort. I also think the show spends far too much time on Frank/Jack Randall but I suppose Tobias Menzies has to get in his screen time... Overall I would strongly encourage anyone who enjoys the show Outlander to read the book series because the books are just SO MUCH better!",1514678400,2,2401,4.547344110854503
7352808,5,B00M0GMBMC,"I love time travel, and this series takes it to a new level.  You become so entrenched with the characters and their time and space that you find yourself looking past the barbaric time in our world and focusing on the beauty, grace and nobility of the characters that, sadly, seems to be far removed from today's world.  The chemistry between Jamie and Claire leaps off the screen.",1514592000,,382,4.602941176470588

7352811,3,B00M0GMBMC,"I'm not going to give this a 2 star review because I watched 7/8 episodes but the Outlander tv series is not that great. It seems predictable and the character development is weak. I don't even know why the main characters even like each other except perhaps physical attraction.  The development of the relationship is weak. These are not teenagers in puppy love. I might be prejudiced with this series because I have watched Poldark and read the books. Winston Graham is a phenomenal author and develops every character in detail and has an amazing ability to put you into the mind and historical times of the characters in the book. He is one of the great authors of all time and very little is predictable in Poldark but almost everything seems predictable in Outlander. Outlander is only entertaining but not much else. The series is shallow, character development is weak, historical aspects are questionable and there are some aspects of the sex scenes that border on pornographic. Despite all it's weaknesses the series is still entertaining enough to watch 7/8.",1513814400,,1070,4.911602209944752

7352817,1,B00M0GMBMC,"Horrible stuff.  So obviously the producers emphasize extreme sex scenes, including repeated violent rapes, and push the limits on violence causing me to think 1., they didn't think their capability of producing a great series based on a good storyline was good enough without it or, 2. they see the viewing public as below base level ignorants who believe the more vicious cruelty and violent sex, the better the show.  Unfortunately from the look of the high ratings it appears #2 is a big factor.
Where are we at in humanity that so many of us love to be entertained by cruelty and torture? I am not strongly religious or prudish either, having gone through the late sixties free love (and peaceful) era.

Caitriona Balfe is perfectly cast as the lovely and fierce but kind and beautiful Claire, and Sam Heughan as Jamie Fraser makes my heart stop. All the actors are superb -- I especially love Graham McTavish as Dougal Mackenzie (I find him almost as sexy as Jamie!), and Stephen Walters as Angus Mhor is so crude and fierce and funny. Be warned though, this series is NOT for kids -- not only are the sex scenes frequent and fairly graphic, but there is a lot of violence, with very realistic blood and guts. The story, acting and costumes are absolutely first rate. You will NOT be disappointed.",1513123200,,820,4.585034013605442

I wish the TV writers would pay more attention to the humor that the books contain. Diana Galbadon has a wonderful sense of humor and when I read the books I found myself laughing aloud many times. Where is the funny side of Jamie that we see in the books? The tv series has a tendency to dwell on the dark side and forget that Jamie has quite a comic vein. Also, what about diversifying the sound track? Every time somebody is making love there is this somber funereal music. What's up with the death song when they are having hot sex?The Season 3 (Voyager) had to cut too many good scenes of the book to fit in such short season. I wish it were as long as season 1, so we could  enjoy all the best of what the book offered. On season 3 Claire sounds a little bit unreasonable and stiff, but Jamie compensates with his amazing acting and looks (with the exception of the one part when he sees Brianna's photos and he is kind of unemotional, but I guess it is the spirit of The times and of Scotland).",1512345600,,1168,4.118421052631579

7352901,2,B00M0GMBMC,I watched most of the first season because it seems every magazine was obsessed with it. The first few episodes were interesting but after that it seemed to just be titillating with no real depth. If you want the television equivalent of a harlequin novel this is it.,1508284800,,267,4.583333333333333
7352902,5,B00M0GMBMC,To Who am I. You need to watch more than the first season. Maybe read the books. Claire is anything but a victim. You watch a few episodes and then write a bad review spewing the typical carp. I am a woman and I don't think she was a victim. She is much smarter than that. Keep watching. And Jamie is more man than 99% of those today. As Claire is more woman.,1508112000,,359,3.9315068493150687
7352903,2,B00M0GMBMC,"Take a doormat and try to make her 'seem' strong by giving her a few curse words to say and some moral judgements to spew and there you have the typical Romance Novel Heroine... Add in some men who are both good and bad (like most people) but who treat her poorly and she chooses to only see the good side anyway as she willingly subjects herself to prove how ""good"" she is to the reader and there you have your typical Romance Novel.

I'm struggling with how to rate this since the acting of many of the actors is quite good and the script seems to be ok.  The heroine Claire is unfortunately pretty two-dimentional and flat, but the other characters are much richer.  I Really like the medical aspect of it and watching her take action on wounds, but when it's missing it becomes ridiculous and boring for me.

One of the things that I HATE about this genre is that it often makes women play subordinate door-mat stereotypes while trying to disguise it as a strong female.  If you want some examples of this I'll post a couple of spoilers below.  But this genre tends to make it ok for women to stand up for themselves UNTIL it makes them seem less soft-hearted and so called 'feminine'.  That's the line they can't cross before they're required to be door-mats because somehow being a soft hearted female prisoner is better than being FREE.  Reminds me of the old view that a woman with a philandering husband would be lauded a heroine saint if she sucked it up, smiled, didn't fool around herself and cleaned her husband's socks anyway.  Because you know- that was the 'ladylike' thing to do.  And a woman who stood up for herself and chose her own freedom was immoral.

Claire is sexually harrassed, berated and imprisoned but she still finds it in her heart to stick up for her prisoners like a good little stockholm victim.  And no I'm not talking about the parts where she's just trying to gain trust to escape because unfortunately, most of the time that's not what she's doing.

(Spoilers ahead)

1) When Claire tries to escape during the ambush, Jaime gives her the choice of walking back or threatens to throw her over his shoulder and carry her.  Then the next day they are best buddies!  Why has she forgotten this man kidnapped her?  Is it because he's muscular and handsome?  Because as this genre constantly reminds us, when you're a woman freedom takes a back seat when the person kidnapping you is hot.

2) When Dougal throws Claire the shirt he just tore for Claire to sew up like a nice girl, she throws it back at him and tells him to sew them himself. I was impressed.  But then Dougal just  'knows' that women are willing to subject themselves to humiliation the moment they feel a little pity for a poor grown adult male without a shirt to wear, right? So he simply shrugs and says, fiine, he'll just wear rags then.  And this of course completely shatters our heroine.  So she pouts and crawls over to get the shirt to sew it. Ugh.  Cringe-worthy.  The only people in that scene who came off as strong were Dougal who got her to pick it up from the floor to sew it obediently and Jaime- who finally tore the shirt from her hands and said he'd be a grown up and sew it himself.

3) One of her 'shadows' sticks a knife in Claire's face when she refuses to eat stolen food and he tells her he will not be judged by a ""whore"" like her. Barely a few hours later Claire is smiling at this man and finding him charming.  What??  Who cares if he had good reasons to steal the food or not?  The man insulted you while sticking a knife in your face- HE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.

4)  When Claire is finally found by a band of British soldiers she is asked straight out whether she is there against her will.  At this moment, Dougal feels pretty confident that his obedient little doormat is going to have his back - despite the fact that he's sexually assaulted her, kept her from leaving the Castle, and continues to threaten daily.  You can tell because Dougal literally tells the officers there that the lady is none of their business and only his business and when the officers INSIST on getting an answer from Claire herself, Dougal actually looks back at Claire as if he's only slightly questioning whether or not she's actually going to defend him.  I mean, the fact that he looked back at her at all shows just how used to having the doormat he was.  He wasn't in the least bit surprised when she defended him and claimed she was there of her own free will!  God forbid she would tell the truth and have herself rescued because then our heroine wouldn't show her empathetic heart and we can't have that!

 I could keep going, but this is already enough and YES-  I know it's not this simple.  I know that Jaime is mostly a good guy and she could see that yada, yada, yada-  but the fact remains that he kidnapped her and did not go out of his way to help her escape.  And yes, she does need to act nicey nicey with her captors to gain their trust, but there are many times she is NOT doing it as an act to gain their trust such as in the examples above.  I just hope that girls under a certain age aren't watching this drivel because its partly stuff like this that makes them grow up thinking it's normal to be in a relationship with someone who intentionally hurts you.",1508112000,,5289,4.354081632653061

7352923,5,B00M0GMBMC,"This is a brilliantly written series. The combination of 'time-travel,' magickal beliefs & daily knowledge of life described regarding Scottish/English historical facts are what allows one's imagination to feel quite personally about the characters. It's also extremely 'spot-on' understanding how history continues to repeat itself & mankind is still foolish enough to continue making the same mistakes--such as the need for human cruelty & war's brutality. This series transcends literally all eras, not merely the past but sadly now, in our present-day world. I do wish the Scottish-Gaelic spoken so often would be translated by subtitles, but after watching it a bit, this 'Sassenach ken' the going's on. I absolutely love this series & cannot wait for Season 4. Bravo!",1506643200,,773,5.45

7352935,2,B00M0GMBMC,"At first, this series is pretty good: well acted, good storyline, beautiful landscape. But after a couple of episodes, the quality goes downhill. The acting is still good, no problem with that. Costumes, landscape, photography: all is fine. Unfortunately, too much of the story revolves around all male characters behind sexually attracted to the main female character. A lot of scenes, especially when she is alone with a male character, are way too long and could easily be cut in half. All after a while, it feels that the entire suspens revolves around one question: is this woman going to get raped or not? All in all, I find this series very disappointing and I regret having spent more than $10 to watch the first season. I won't pay for season 2.",1505952000,,754,4.71969696969697

So we thought, we'll watch one more and decide whether to continue. We turned the tv off when the first rape scene showed up. If you've ever wondered where people get the idea we're living in a ""rape"" culture, shows like this are exhibit A. We won't be watching the rest of the series.",1505692800,,447,4.397590361445783

I only read the five star reviews, but It pays to look at the one star reviews and I don't mean the whiners about the CD's not working. I know sex sells, but this is ridiculous. I wonder how an actor could read this script and see what is required and agree to play the part, but the desire to be famous is powerful.

7352967,5,B00M0GMBMC,"A faithful rendering of Diana Gabaldon's book Outlander (which I have loved since it was released in the 1990s). Ron Moore took great care to keep to the spirit of the book and it's story line. It is filmed in Scotland and the cast is mostly Scottish and become the inner eye's version of the roles they play (even if you pictured them differently from the book). Cait and Sam's chemistry is through the roof and they ARE Claire and Jamie to a T. Casting was spot on! The landscape is amazing and evocative - it too tells the story. Terry D did miracles with the wardrobe and went a long way to transporting the viewers to the time periods in the story. The music gets into your soul and thrills you. Great care was made to ensure that it was everything it should and could be. Every contributer outperformed - can you give an award to the entire crew, cast and country? It is : Consuming. Haunting. Evocative. Captivating. Moving. Transporting. Don't miss it!",1503100800,,960,4.491428571428571

7352973,3,B00M0GMBMC,"The show is watchable, even entertaining, as long as you:
1. Have at least some interest in Scottish history
2. Have close captioning on your TV
3. Are willing to learn some Scottish words like ""ken,"" ""bairn,"" ""bonny,"" etc.

I strongly recommend that you DO NOT watch the last episode and go directly to Season 2, unless you enjoy a drawn-out sadistic and graphic man-rape. There is absolutely no need for that, other than to show the producers' disdain for the viewers. You would not miss a thing, other than some flashbacks in Season 2.

Also, I did not appreciate another example of the current Hollywood infatuation with all things pagan, while portraying the established clergy as ignorant evildoers. FYI, the second season is better.",1502323200,,739,4.904

7352978,5,B00M0GMBMC,"When a TV series is attempted from books, it often falls short, but OUTLANDER is riveting. First and foremost, the casting here is impressive and well done. Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan had very big shoes to fill for Jamie and Claire, and are astonishing in these roles. I couldn't picture Jamie Fraser played by anyone other than Sam Heughan and if I didn't know better, I'd think Diana (the author) made him. Balfe's keen intelligence shines as Claire, and both of these lead actors' range is well utilized in the series. The series begins in Scotland, and this is historical fiction with a time travel twist. The show was filmed on location using a great number of actors from the locales featured in the storyline. The accents are highly accurate for those who demand authenticity, as are the costumes. The show has a fair amount of grit, too, portrayed in a stark and believable manner, and some scenes are definitely not for the sensitive or fainthearted. This show is so good, it has boosted tourism to Scotland.",1501891200,,1022,4.747191011235955

7353014,1,B00M0GMBMC,"Season 1 is just a drudge.  I only kept watching because I was sick and too lazy to find something else.  The script is horrid as is the narration (and why did Jamie just start well into season 1?).  This is a very simple plot/concept and you don't need narration at ALL.  It just is filmed like a pulp novel.  This is taken from romance novels, so things are going to be pretty simple, with apologies to romance enthusiasts.  I am just not one, but I did try to read the first book in this series as it seemed like it might be more than the usual romance novel, but I couldn't get into it at all.  The acting is mostly histrionic.  And the characters, esp Claire and Jamie, are their own very worst enemies.  Every time they set out without their brains, I just roll my eyes.  Not great as a plot mover!  Claire is a stubborn, high strung woman with no common sense or emotional control, and I could not like or respect her. Jamie is a sympathetic character (and this needs one so badly!!) but he is the perfect lover, which is a huge fantasy.  I kept mouthing, ""Oh come ON."". But who wants reality, I guess?  The villains and what they do is over the top gross and not necessary (and yet again, the homosexual/bi character is the evil one, alas).  The direction is very lacking as is the lighting.  And too many side trips into 'educational' things, but they really weren't of much use.  Not like the way Michael Creighton used that device, for example.  I am an American, but got to live in Scotland in the mid 70s (Dundee), and I went to all these places often.  I thought I'd love the locations in the series, and it is nice to hear them mentioned, but it has so little to do with anything other than just a location name, so I'm not moved at all.  I just love Ft. William!  Spent great times at wonderful B&Bs and sitting out by Loch Ness in the early morning.  Too bad the series doesn't mention the very important locks and where Ft. William is situated in relation to Loch Ness (which is heavenly gorgeous; forget Nessie!).  Doesn't give any reference for really any locations.  Skip this one unless you are a die hard fan of the books, and even then no guarantee you'll like it.  Can't believe the good ratings.",1497052800,8,2221,4.322033898305085

I would have stopped watching, but the rest of the cast is very engaging, and the story is great.  It is impossible to sympathize with the main character because she is so bitter and mean.  She plays the role with a chip on her shoulder the entire time, and it is impossible to believe that any man would be even remotely interested in such a woman.  It does not matter that she is pretty.  She just is not at all engaging.  I am not sure if this is the fault of the actress or the director or both.  I only wish that when they were editing prior to putting out the final version, someone in power would have seen how hostile and despicable the character came off, and had demanded that every scene be re-shot so that the main character would be someone we could identify with, and not hate.  Too bad really, because the rest of the production is simply wonderful.",1496016000,,1079,4.280788177339901
7353024,5,B00M0GMBMC,A wonderful book series brought to life in film.,1495929600,,48,4.444444444444445
7353025,2,B00M0GMBMC,"I've read this book series probably a dozen times or more in the last two decades, and I love these books (even the squicky parts,) because they're telling a story.  There's a distinct narrative. I've met Diana Gabaldon, have autographed books, the lot.  Believe me, I'm a fan and can quote certain parts of the books verbatim.

But I hate this show.  The acting is amazing, the scenery is stunning, so I'll give it two stars for that; but past that?  Even if it weren't a book series first, this show is not likeable for me.

It's not because of the usual mish-mash of arguments I've seen people make, i.e. ""Claire is too tall!  Her eyes aren't the right colour!""  ""Jamie's hair looks Hobbit-y!  He's not got the right nose!"" etc.  No, my distaste comes from a deeper place than that.  I could care less how they look, I care about the story.  And equally importantly, the characters.

We'll start with Claire, the protagonist.  What made this series so amazing for me is that Claire is a strong, well-travelled, well-read and inviting character.  She's got her issues; family ""abandonment"" (her parents died when she was a child), PTSD from serving as a war nurse, and of course the absolutely bewildering cognitive dissonance of having time-travelled into the past.  In the show, her strength and her sense of self were eradicated.  She became a soft-core porno heroine, rather than the liberated and powerful woman she was in the books.  I was not impressed with the way the writers chose to morph her character into something more approaching the pop-culture norm of a weak woman.  I was especially disgusted when Claire, in direct contrast to the book, chose to pretend to be a witch to satisfy a young girl's desire for a love potion.  Claire would never have done that, out of the very real fear she would have been prosecuted for it and she was held in a massively suspicious light already due to being English.  I'm very forgiving and tolerant of changes in a story when switching from a book-to-screen medium due to the constraints versus the freedoms of each, but changes in a character's core personality are not forgivable.  This continued to be my complaint with pretty much every character.

Next we'll talk about Jamie.  He's closer than Claire in his character, but he still acts out of character as established over 15 books and counting (yes, I'm including the Outlandish Companion and the Lord John books, as well as the forgettable graphic novel), as well as a number of novellas.  I'm trying not to give spoilers, so I won't go into details.  Let's just say the last damned thing he'd do is actually join The Black Watch.

Okay, so Dougal.  Okay, he's a complicated character (aren't they all?) and he has an interesting relationship with Jamie.  But oddly enough, he does love his nephew, and he's certainly not a rapist nor would his personal honour permit him to tell Claire he wants to ""grind her corn.""  While he does make advances at Claire twice, he's not that gritty.  He's an opportunist and a patriot, as well as infallibly loyal to his brother and his clan, but he's not this slightly monstrous somewhat sociopathic evilish guy.

Geilis Duncan.  Oh, what a character she is.  And again, complex.  But the writers chose to stage her as a pretty shallow, sweet-voiced ""wolf in sheep's clothing"" which isn't at all accurate to the character.  She's pretty bawdy, and very forthright.  She isn't hiding behind a sweet smile (unless she's playing with her husband) she's facing life head-on.

Murtagh and Rupert are changed from rough and tumble, loyal, intelligent, and somewhat bawdy friends into buffoons and comic relief.

And Jenny.  Oh, man.  Really, Starz?  Jenny is portrayed as this sharp-tongued harridan with zero empathy and zero compassion, when it's so exactly the opposite.  You took a loving, blunt, truthful and honest woman with a heart of gold and turned her into a nasty, unlikeable caricature of herself.  She certainly never called Claire a ""trollop"".... quite the opposite, she was very respectful even while in a knock-down-drag-out Fraser cat fight with her brother.  She was downright malicious in the show's portrayal rather than the loving woman with a very Scottish, motherly way of putting her foot down (which makes sense, since she became ""woman of the house"" at nine years old.  I'm appalled at what was done to her.

And then we'll go into the filming.  Look, many of the sex scenes are definitely in the book, but they're hardly gratuitous.  In fact, quite the opposite.  On Diana's Facebook page a year or two back, she posted a short essay she'd written on the art of writing sex scenes and something she was quite clear on was that ""less is more.""  Yes, they have frequent sex, but it's ""off-screen"" as it were, with Jamie making a suggestion or raising a brow, Claire responding, a few subtle references and then fade to black.  An example from the first book is Jamie telling Claire that they'll likely be ""sleeping in haystacks"" and then nodding at a patch of bracken and suggesting they try it, to ""get into practice.""  The book then cuts to the aftermath.  Then they do play again, but never is it said what exactly they're doing.  No ""throbbing manhoods"" here!  In fact, Diana raises the question of overly-purple sex scenes in a book later in the series and makes it quite clear how ridiculous she finds play-by-play sex scenes.  The show could have kept it tasteful.  I'm far from a prude, and I'm absolutely cool with sex and sexuality; I raised my kids to understand that sex is natural, beautiful, and part of life and absolutely not a sin in any way unless someone is not consenting.  And yet, I found myself turned off by the graphic sex.  The frequent, frequent graphic sex.  This is screen time that could be spent on character development, not gratuitous and unnecessary frequent depictions that ""they're banging.... again...""  ""Oh, look!  Breasts!  Again!""  And hey, I'm all for Free the Nipple.  I'd loooove to see Westerners stop finding female breasts so sexualised, and I'd love to be able to walk around topless like guys do with just as much... or rather, as little reaction or care.  However, they're hyper-sexualised in the show, and therefore are creating the opposite cultural thoughts.

And, finally: yep, the violence.  I do find it amusing that many reviewers are complaining about the sex without a word against the violence, when really I think depictions of love-making should be far preferable to depictions of violence.  However, while some violence needs to be depicted in order to get a point across, build a character, or make it clear that this is unacceptable behaviour, much of the violence in the first season was also gratuitous.  Again, that time could be spent building the character and their relationships with each other as a *result* of the violence, showing the healing as the books did in such beautifully written prose, instead of spending time almost lovingly depicting every gory graphic act possible with scant moments spent on the healing.  Yes, it was a brutal time period.  Yes, people got raped.  Yes, people got flogged.  However, they did what WE should be doing with our TV shows; making it clear that this is unacceptable, and then getting on with the healing.

Soooo.... basically what it comes down to for me, is that everything I liked about the characters got pretty much reversed in the series, and everything I liked about the story; same thing.

I'm glad many people and fans of the books like this series, but I'm going to be the dissenter; it does not work for me at all.",1495843200,,7610,4.786482334869432

think they added the offending scenes to get some people to watch it. The books are more PG
rated and not so in your face as a TV show is. I like the actor chosen to play Jamie, but not so
much the one chosen to play Claire. I realize they got to two weeks before the start of filming and
had not found a Claire, but surely there was one in the mix who fit the description of Claire even
a little better. She is ok, but definitely not my choice. The story is great even with a few additions

not used, but I realize they were working with time limits. How they will do in future books I do not

7353092,5,B00M0GMBMC,"Outlander is a brilliant series. The story is beautifully, smartly written. All the components are impeccable - the lighting, cinematography, acting. These writers and film makers understand story, pacing, how to transform history; and how to create a sense of kinship between characters and viewer. This NOT in the vein of misogynistic ilk - G.O.T., etc so if that's your deal, keep moving.",1489017600,,391,5.222222222222222
7353093,5,B00M0GMBMC,"This is one of the most faithfully adapted book-to-television series ever produced. Anyone who loves the Outlander book series will appreciate the care the writers, actors, and filmmakers associated with this show have taken in order to bring Gabaldon's books to life on the small screen. My only complaint is the explicit sex scenes, but have found that's what to be expected from premium cable stations. Definitely not a program for children under 16, but if you've read the books--actulally, even if you haven't--you will thoroughly enjoy Outlander.",1488931200,,552,5.284090909090909

7353097,1,B00M0GMBMC,"Just because it includes controversial themes and not seen on TV before (nursing mother expelling breast milk manually) doesn't make it a good show.  It is excessively violent and shows way too much explicit sex for a TV show.  I was tempted to quit it after the first half but plodded on to the second half of the first season and will see no more.  This is just an overly explicit romance novel put to film.  I actually think it soft porn with too much nudity!  Also, I am all for breast feeding but in our world breasts are still viewed by men as sexual objects and should be done in public discreetly.

I'm an R.N (like Claire!) and I've always enjoyed the concept of time travel, so needless to say I fell instantly in love! When I learned Starz was developing the entire series for television I was thrilled. They've kept closely enough to the source material to please me, and any changes they've made have actually enhanced the storyline, which I wouldn't have believed possible. The casting is perfect and beyond expectations, bringing beloved characters to life. The costuming is sumptuous. The settings are as magical and beautiful as I imagined in my mind's eye. The quality of this bluray set is excellent. It was shipped appropriately in the stated time frame. Highly recommend!",1488067200,,762,5.0078740157480315

It's borderline X in my opinion - I was a bit uncomfortable throughout many scenes.  Of course I watched it anyway because ya know - ya gotta because it's such a great story line!  :)  The actors they chose to portray the characters were no where near what I had in my head.

7353175,5,B00M0GMBMC,"I just recently started watching this series and my first thought was this is a woman's program.  It dragged a bit as the plot developed but my patience was rewarded by a nude scene in which Caitriona Balfe, the lead actress, who played Claire Randall gave the audience extended views of her beautiful breasts. Of course, there are many handsome men in the series to keep the women interested. I am now in the middle of Season 2 and Caitriona has bared her breasts in almost all the episodes, all instances being very tastefully done.

The series is purely fictional, but considerable effort was obviously given to some historical accuracy.  The wardrobes, speech, grooming, events of the time all appear to be what you would expect in Scotland of 1743.  Claire Randall is English and is forced to adapt as an outsider into 18th century Scotland during a period of high tension between the Scotts and occupying English forces.

I am almost done with Season 2 and will be lost when it is over.  Fortunately, Starz has renewed the series for a third season which is scheduled to start in early April 2017.",1486166400,4,1103,4.689119170984456

I have to say that it matched up well with the story and there are very few inconsistencies.  One is particular was actually addressed in the ""making of"" extras at the end of the episode and was done to give the readers just a slight variation so they didn't constantly know what was coming.  Over all, an excellent series!",1485820800,,461,4.3882352941176475

7353211,5,B00M0GMBMC,"Often if you've read the book (or books in this case as there are 8 so far in the Outlander series) the film, and especially a TV series, doesn't come close to meeting your expectations. In this case, I've enjoyed the TV series MORE than I enjoyed the books and I NEVER thought I could or would possibly say that. In fact I've recently gone back and started re-reading the Outlander series (for the THIRD time - to kill the time during DROUGHTLANDER!) and I find myself saying ""the TV series handled that plot line much better"". What I love most about the Outlander book series are the characters, Claire and Jamie primarily but also Brianna and Roger and many of the other characters. Diana Gabaldon developed characters that you either love or love to hate and a storyline that, while unbelievable at times, is simply addicting. I own all 8 books and the entire video series that is out so far (even though I've recorded every episode as I'm afraid I'll accidentally erase them). So, buy and read every book in the series and then watch every episode that has been made. Hopefully by then Season 3 will be here!",1485820800,2,1113,4.54228855721393

I LOVE the Outlander books, so I considered NOT watching the show. I finally decided to have a look-see at the first episode, & fell in love with Outlander all over again!
I am a huge fan of time travel stories which is what led me to the Outlander Series. Contrary to some others opinions...traveling back 200 years through the stones does indeed a time travel story make!
Yes there is some violence (just as I am sure there WAS violence in that time) And yes there is some sex (hasn't there always been sex?)  but it is NOT porn.
I feel the show follows the book very well, & I hope the entire series of books end up on dvd!!",1485302400,5,710,4.371212121212121

7353265,3,B00M0GMBMC,"Season 1 was spectacular. My only complaint is that they spoke Gaelic so much and there were no subtitles. I get that when Claire was around, the filmmakers wanted you to feel as lost and left out as Claire. However, there's an entire scene between Jamie and Murtogh that is completely in Gaelic and I'm sitting there wondering why I'm even watching it - why did they waste time on a scene that barely anyone will understand?

But that of course is minor. The rest is just fabulous. Great acting, story, cinematography, character development...everything.

Having said that, Season 2 did not utilize Gaelic as much -  it was just sprinkled in the conversation in between English and when they speak French, there are subtitles.

But S2 was not as good. The actors and crew are still stellar but there is no character development. They don't seem to have a real goal that progresses - the plot seems to be just a red herring and is not substantial or life or death as in S1.

I've never read the books and I'm told each season is one book so if you liked the book I guess you'll like the season. If you're like me and coming in blindly you might be disappointed.

I devoured S1 and this one I have 3 more episodes to go in S2 but I'm not in a rush.",1485129600,,1247,4.353448275862069

7353281,3,B00M0GMBMC,"No adaptation can live up to the power of the human imagination and this one is no exception. The essential story is there and the author tells us she is satisfied. Chief among my problems with the series is the actor playing Jamie. His hair is auburn, not the glowing golden red described in the book. He is big but not head and shoulders above the rest of the cast and I would not describe him as strikingly handsome or heavily muscled. Were not so much emphasis put on these points in the book it would not seem so significant.

I cannot comment on the authenticity of the tartans and so many scenes are so dark one can hardly tell. Must check to see where it was shot and what building is used as Loech Castleit certainly is an oppressive looking heap.

After the awkwardness of the initial episode and its inventions the series becomes more true to the novel upon which it is based and grows on one.

This is another series in which greedy studios have split a season into two parts and part one ends with Claire in the clutches of the villainous Captain Randall just as Jamie appears inside the armed British Camp to rescue her.",1485129600,,1134,4.390476190476191
7353282,5,B00M0GMBMC,"LOVED Season One of Outlander. It follows the books so very VERY closely. Few shows can do that well. In fact, Game of Thrones did the same thing for Season 1 and then they went their very separate ways.

Claire and Jamie are a funny darling pair. Scotland is magical. There are some very gory scenes but they are done well. The characters have great chemistry and come to life beautifully. The soundtrack is like no other.

Absolutely LOVED it and ordered Season 2 right away",1485129600,,476,4.523255813953488

7353284,5,B00M0GMBMC,"After trying twice to get into this show (Scotland has a way of pulling me into a story), the third try did the trick.
A little caveat, though: I've never read the books. As a guy, romance isn't my genre branch. And yet, this show grabbed me with its period piece, its culture, its interesting style of story.
Oh, man, the story is incredible! Whether you're in it for the sex scenes, for the language, for the violence, just know it's not in an equal ratio of per episode. I'm glad for the unpredictable element of adult content. That separates it from the typical premium network show these days. The story, though, has a historical quality that keeps drawing me in by episode's end. Never disappointed if there's no sex or violence, I just keep loving the Scottish atmosphere, the unique aspect of no subtitles when one speaks Gaelic, the critical subtext of each scenario, the deep characterization, even the Scottish Highlands politics.

I think it feeds into the new generation of girls who look for rich Men to whisk them away. They don't want to admit it but deep ingrained in their consciousness it's there. With Outlander it's the closest portrayal of LOVE and PASSION you can get out there! I have read almost all books in the Outlander Series. I have always loved history, I have Scottish roots and I am married to my soulmate so I find the connection with Claire and Jamie relatable. The author of the Outlander series is a total genius and you can truly tell how hard she works to keep facts straight.

I have read all the books and this series stays very true to the books.  There are some variations, but so far they have been OK.  The story is fascinating.  Because there is time travel involved, it might be considered SiFi, but I consider the story much more historical.  The author of the books has done meticulous research and the story portrays and very vivid image of Scotland in the mid 18th century. All the books and the series revolve around two main characters, Claire and Jamie Fraser.  They will be included along with the iconic literary couples of all time.",1483660800,,720,4.442748091603053

I wonder, occasionally, if the people enjoying this show have never experienced violent crime themselves? This is not entertainment, this is about folks enjoying the grotesque. I guess? I can't fathom it. This isn't great story.  (Main gal actually says something about how she and her husband are having relationship troubles, but at least they'll always have sex. - I about cracked up laughing at the shallow aspect and how this is the most untrue concept about relationships I ever heard.)

I had been interested in the show for a while, because the advertisements looked great, and im so glad that I decided to watch it. The detail, acting, sets, costumes all transport you back to the 18th century and tell the tale like your right there with the actors within the story. I loved it so much that I literally binge watched the first 3 seasons within 3 to 4 days. I have now re-watched certain episodes, researched the books, and started on book 6 to see what happens next. I am anxiously looking forward to season 2.5 to begin ( the season aren't numbered 1, 2, 3.. but instead, 1, 1.5, and 2.) I found myself in love with Jamie, and wishing for a husband just like him. I also loved the friend and loyalty exhibited by Martaugh, and the strength of Claire. Although I felt that Claire is a bit hardheaded, she is a strong female lead.

I highly recommend this show to anyone who loves historic, cinematic pieces and movies set in specific periods with great stories of romance, action, and intrigue.",1482710400,2,1133,4.473429951690822

Had to see for myself and I'm glad I did. As soon as I watched the first few episodes, I went back to the internet to dig out some of the stories I'd skipped over about season three of this epic. I wanted to make sure there was more of this to watch after I binged the first two seasons. It's a great story. The fact that the main characters are both gorgeous doesn't hurt its cause either.  Excuse me, I have to go back to watching this. It's worth the time",1482710400,,615,4.168067226890757

7353551,4,B00M0GMBMC,"Claire Randall is holidaying in Scotland, looking to reconnect with her husband following their service in WW2. However, while exploring an ancient stone monument she is transported back to 1743. Here she is quickly caught up in the intrigues between the Scottish clans and the British army. In some ways she is fortunate to fall in with the McKenzie clan, particularly the handsome Jamie Fraser. Conversely she faces terrible perils at the hands of Captain Randall, her own husbands ancestor.

Of all the story types, time-travel is one of the hardest to pull off successfully. There are so many issues regarding language and general credibility. Here, Claire is not as canny as youd imagine and seems to complicate her dealings more than youd expect. Indeed, Im not sure if shes a 1940s girl or a 21st century one? Maybe its just the scripting but you don't want to stretch believability further than you have to. Anyway, Claire has to use her slim knowledge of the times and the Randall family deftly.

This said, paradoxes aside, there are also some very interesting angles explored and some amusing exchanges. Note though, that it is foremost a drama and there are many very serious doings. The 1740s were a rough and ready time and there is plenty of violence and sex, including the mixing of the two (teenagers would say its quite rapey). An absolute highlight is the scrumptous sets and costuming. I personally have long been intrigued by the Scottish Highlands and its history and this series is a great way to see it all.

This said, the accents are hard to follow accents at times. Given there are eight episodes in this first volume, its also a little slow. Bear in mind too, that almost everything is seen from Claires perspective, so this has some limitations in conveying the story. In the end there was too much explicit violence for my wife but not quite enough action for me. Overall though, I feel this show would appeal most to younger women who have been introduced to stronger topics in GOT etc but with the themes here being more in tune with a womans areas of interests. 4 stars",1482105600,,2102,4.722070844686648

7353655,5,B00M0GMBMC,"I rarely enjoy when books are made into a movie/tv series. The actors are often not what I envisioned the characters from the book to look/sound like, particular events are omitted or altered in a way that make them hardly recognizable. I have read the entire Outlander books series (twice) so I was more than hesitant to view the tv series. I finally broke down one evening and began to watch...and I was absolutely amazed at how wonderful the tv series is. The characters are true, the story line stays in tact and certain scenes are spot on. The love/sex scenes have been included in the tv series, and though there is nudity, I did not find any of the scenes offensive and thought they were perfect. I have found the actors that have created Jamie and Claire's characters to be truly absorbed into their roles; you can feel their respect and love for each other. One would think they have an off screen relationship. I suppose if you had not read the book series yet, the storyline could drag on a bit, perhaps losing your interest. I recommend you read the books first, if you have not. If you are putting off watching the tv series, put if off no more. You will be consumed by the tv series as you were consumed by the books.",1481068800,2,1231,4.427312775330397

Um....one suggestion though: If your TV is visible to anyone walking their dog along your street, you may want to close your drapes/shades.

7353673,5,B00M0GMBMC,"Beautiful, entertaining show that combines fantasy, romance, and elements of history. Yes, this is on American premium cable, so it obviously contains nudity, sex, and violence, as do all premium cable shows. I feel that everything they do has a purpose. The sex scenes give us insight into the evolving relationship and intimacy of the main couple. The violence reflects the reality of the time period. Don't write this show off because of nudity, even if you're prudish. It has excellent actors, beautiful costumes and sets, and most importantly, good writing. It starts off slowly for the first couple episodes, but the story expands at just the right pace and you will fall in love with Claire and Jamie.",1480636800,7,708,4.957983193277311

7353716,1,B00M0GMBMC,"I have never written a review; however,  I feel compelled to do so after watching Outlander Season 1 (includes volumes 1 and 2) which covers the first book in the Outlander book series, by Dianna Gabaldon. I read the first book in the series four years ago and was very excited to learn that the story was unfolding as a TV series I remember loving the romance between Jamie and Claire, but I also recall being greatly disturbed by the Wentworth Prison scene. I was so angry that the author CHOSE to write that scene. She didn't need to make the villain that heinous. Nor did she need to make the hero suffer so greatly. So, with that said I began the TV series so excited to watch a sweet romance, and nervous about how the Wentworth Prison scene would be portrayed. The only positive comment I can share is that the acting was well done. Unfortunately, any decent aspects of the season were overshadowed by a lot of drama and boring episodes where nothing seemed to really move forward. The Jamie and Claire dynamic doesn't take up enough screen time. The nudity is abundant , offensive, and unnecessary (spent a lot of time fast-forwarding or looking away). Lastly, the Wentworth Prison scene was sickening. The scene in the book is bad enough, but the TV series seemed to want to bask in the filthy nature of the scene and force us to see it over and over again. During the time that I was watching the series, I was also beginning to read the series to completion. Last night upon completing the first season of the series I  was reminded of how disgusting the author makes Jack Randall. I was 54% into Book 1 and quit. I will NOT finish the books and I will NOT finish the TV series. This is a story that had potential, but went in such a vile direction that I can't proceed. I wish there had been a review for me to read that would have warned me of what was to come, and I hope that this helps anyone who wants to avoid investing their time and money into a story that is so deplorable.",1479168000,4,1994,4.343163538873995

7353987,4,B00M0GMBMC,I enjoyed purchasing a few episodes in season one that I missed (when I had a free pay-channel weekend and recorded most of the series). The price was a just a little too much per episode so I didn't buy the last 2 episodes I missed. I don't have Netflix but use Amazon Prime for movies. Sometimes my friends or family will talk about something available on Netflx and it's not always affordable on Amazon Prime.

Season One is incredible from the scenery, costumes, and casting, everything just works. I really like how the time travel is not a central part of the plot just an incidental occurrence so that the show is not overly sci-fi and is more period drama. I highly recommend this show and just know if you start watching you will be addicted.",1475971200,,510,4.378947368421053

7354053,1,B00M0GMBMC,"Unbeknownst to me was that the BluRay DVD comes from Price Clock in the U.K & Canada - it may not work in your BluRay player.
Once before I ordered a DVD (different movie, different company) and it came from the U.K. And it would not play but just attempt to read and read. And yes, I know the rule of BluRay DVD needs a BluRay player. I was right, The Outlander discs would only read and read and not play.
When the Outlander DVD took so long to deliver, I called Amazon and learned that it was coming from the U.K.  When I heard that I was concerned I would have the same experience as a few years ago but stellar, Price Clock - assured that it ""works in all regions"" and that ""all players need the firmware updated"".  I have an expensive NEW BluRay player, no updating of anything needed.  I was instructed to play it,....when I did open the pkg and found that it needed to be returned - AT THAT TIME I was told by the seller there is a 45% restocking fee.
The buyers should be made aware by Amazon that The DVD was coming from out of the USA and the HIGH restocking fee, and that there are not tracking of the product - this should be in the product description. Neither were included.
I filed an A-Z form and Amazon denied it.
I've been a loyal and happy customer for years - UNTIL NOW. Look at the reviews - others have had similar experiences
Amazon has faiked me.

****Update:  I am happy to say that the problem has been resolved BY Amazon, not the seller - keep this in mind. Also, beware of products from outside the US.",1475712000,8,1531,4.176271186440678

The show seemed a little slow to get started--partially because of its relatively complex setting and plot. But it does develop as the characters become better defined and we learn about their back stories, and a viewer is likely to be hooked by the 3rd or 4th episode.

7354064,1,B00M0GMBMC,"Believe me when I say I'm not easily offended and love a good mixture of action, adventure, and violence. BUT the number of RAPE scenes are tremendously disturbing.

I'm not sure if the numerous violent assaults, rapes, and beatings done to Claire is a comment on how men conduct themselves when they think they have absolute control over a woman, or a reflection on our 21st centrury RAPE CULTURE. Either way I don't think this t.v. series is healthy to watch because of how it portrays women as sex objects to be RAPED whenever left without the watchful eye of a man. This is unfortunate because the Scottish culture and adventure was exciting to watch.

In sum, Outlander's is written, directed, & produced in poor taste because of its obsession with repeatedly raping women! Disgusting.",1475625600,33,790,4.844444444444444

The version received shows the author does not know anything about Scotland. He makes them look like Klingons. He mixes up the 18th century with pre-Renaissance 14th century and makes the Catholics who tame and nurture orphans look as if they were abusive towards them. Also, nurses are not physicians.

The story could be told just as well, and perhaps better,  by leaving a bit to the imagination.  Not only are the scenes unnecessarily explicit, they are quite long.  It is as though the producer could not decide whether to make a porn movie or to tell a story. Well, I suppose at least there is no pizza delivery guy involved.",1475539200,13,467,4.8

The casting was fantastic, the plot is true to the books, though not identical, and the production is visually beautiful. I was very impressed. Only one warning - it is also true to the books in its graphic depiction of violence in various forms, so be aware if that bothers you.

There are quite a few rough rape and torcher scenes that I simply fast forwarded through. May I also highly encourage reading the books!

Other than that, it's an awesome story based on some historical events, which is my favorite type of program. You will fall in love with these characters who play their parts very well!  It pulls on your heart strings.
Cons: I did not really care for the abuse scenes between the 2 men in prison, but I guess it shows the brutality of some men. It could have left a little of it out and you could get the drift. Also, the sex scenes could be less vivid and you would get the drift. I don't think we have to ""bare all"" to get the idea of passion and love between 2 people.
I guess I should have given it 3 stars because of the cons, but I loved the story line so much that I have it a 5, and I couldn't wait to see all of it!",1474416000,2,806,3.769230769230769

7354220,3,B00M0GMBMC,"Has some good Character build ups.  The lead Actress is very elegant, and has a strong on screen presence, and it does feel like you are in a romance novel(which I didn't know that it was).  But this is also where it falls a little short.  The story arch is a bit dry.  Granted I've only seen a few episodes(season one Episode 4) and I am waiting for the other shoe to drop.  However, single episode storylines are also a bit on the slow side.  I do find the costumes very well done, and sets very nice.  But I'm still waiting for more drama?  I will continue to watch, but pacing is to the point where I end up doing other things will its on.  I call it a ""wall paper"" show.  Here's to hoping it picks up, because I do like the concept and main character.",1474243200,,756,4.081632653061225

7354235,5,B00M0GMBMC,"I wish I could give this show 500 stars! I totally loved it. It suits my interests perfectly: modern and historical drama, love story, action mixed with a little sci-fi - very well executed. The scenery was gorgeous. The actors were all amazing and I found myself watching the series back to back, hours at a time because I had to see what would happen next. The characters, Frank Randall and Black Jack Randall were both played by one person. I was amazed at how well he was able separate the two different characters. Very impressed. The actress who plays Claire is beautiful and eloquent. She can really pull off not wearing makeup. The actor who plays her romantic companion, Jamie Fraser, is very handsome and was a pleasure to watch as well. After I watched this series I immediately moved to watching the second season. It a little more disturbing but equally intriguing. I was so disappointed when I finished watching the second season because the 3rd and 4th seasons have not come out yet. Of course you are left with a cliff-hanger at the end of season 2. I read that Starz has picked up and ordered the 3rd and 4th seasons to be made but do not know when they will come out. I am so looking forward to it. Highly recommend.",1474243200,10,1234,4.488888888888889

7354239,1,B00M0GMBMC,"Individual tastes differ, but I couldn't get beyond the first 30 minutes of the first episode.  To me, it had poor screenwriting and acting.",1474243200,,140,4.833333333333333
7354240,2,B00M0GMBMC,"I really love the books and have read through the series several times and recommended it to others, but I think the director seriously and consistently misses key aspects of the characters, needlessly changes story line and ,the show ends up just being plain annoying and disappointing.  The Clare presented in the show is no where near the strong compassionate woman revealed in the books, and the Jaime of the show lacks the wisdom self awareness that is a strong part of the character, even in the first book when he is young.  He repeatedly displays a petulance that is just not present in the storyline, and is one of the reasons everyone loves Jaime.  Worst of all, the strong sense of humor and good humor that is a key component of both characters, and of their relationship, is omitted or short stroked way to often for me to think that the director really has a clue.
I think the cinematography, wardrobe and set design, and casting are all great.  Wonderful detail and richness.  There is plenty of story ahead, please, please, please rethink the screenwriting and directing!
Ms. Gabaldon - HELP!",1474243200,,1108,4.75

It grinds to a halt within ten minutes, and I have to restart the TV to get another 6-10 minutes.  Tech support was no help.  I guess Amazon doesn't support videos unless you are paying extra for them...or something. They did give me a $5 credit for my trouble, but that is less than I am having to pay Apple TV to watch the same video.

7354265,5,B00M0GMBMC,"I get lost in these episodes: brilliant natural colors as the backdrop, witty and quick dialogue in an enchanting Scottish English and Scottish Gaelic,  the irresistible chemistry between Claire and Jamie, and the unpredictability of living as a clan in the Scottish highlands under the oppressive rule of the Red Coats. The pacing of the story is perfect, as they juxtapose Claire's current life in the 18th century to her previous life in the 20th. The villain, Black Jack Randall (played by Tobias Menzies) is a brilliantly tortured soul. Menzies's ability to change his demeanor to bring Claire's loving husband, in the 20th century, to life is quite impressive. The supporting cast members, especially Jamie's band of highlanders, add humor and depth of culture to the show. I love when the writers make sure to highlight authentic Scottish traditions in the episodes. And, the opening song, ""Skye Boat"", primes one for the magic and drama that each episode delivers. I would highly recommend the whole series!",1474156800,,1015,5.114457831325301

7354325,3,B00M0GMBMC,"If you've read the book, you're going to be disappointed. Beautiful scenery and the use of old Gaelic is a lovely touch that might have been improved by adding subtitles so the viewer, if not Claire, is always in the know. Plodding direction.  The character of Claire is not terribly likable although I think the actress is beautiful and tries to bring nuance to the role.  Oddly, there seems to be very little chemistry between Jamie and Claire and the story itself seems to have been rewritten in some way that has made it less compelling.  There are, however, some very good performances from the actors.  There is an added scene where Jack Randall retells the flogging of Jamie that is meant to show the moral descent of Randall and the actor was actually quite mesmerizing.  The background scenes and action in the Hall are pretty lame;  I really wanted to see attention to little details that would express the richness of the book.  Overall a middle of the road period piece video that doesn't make me want to watch Season 2.",1473638400,,1032,4.637362637362638

7354362,5,B00M0GMBMC,"I absolutely adore this series. I've been a fan of the books since they first released. I remember eagerly awaiting each new book's release and being so excited to see what Claire and Jamie were up to next. Now, I feel the same way about the series. The adaptation of the series is beautiful, sweeping, epic and it honors this amazing story in an incredibly detailed way.

I will say that I have had some friends who have opted not to watch the series because there was a lot of sexual content in the opening episode. That stopped them after the first episode and they wouldn't go further. Having read the books, this didn't surprise  me. However, I have encouraged them to give the show another try. Subsequent episodes kept the  sexual activity relegated to storyline specific needs and though there are sexual scenes, it's not prominently displayed throughout all of the episodes.

I love each of the characters. I have not felt that there were any missteps with casting at all and to me, each of these actors beautifully embodies the characters.

If you are looking for a time traveling romance, historical adventure, or just some fabulous  action, Outlander has it all. Give it a try - you won't be sorry!",1473465600,2,1210,4.683962264150943

If they haven't stayed true to the book's scenes, they HAVE stayed true to Ms. Gabaldon's vision. Tobias Menzies has the hardest job of all and by golly, I don't know how he did it, but he has me crying for Frank's loss and then just as quickly he has me totally, thoroughly loathing Jack Randall. All at the same time. The man deserves an Emmy and that's saying a lot as I am partial to Jamie and Claire's characters and am Team Jamie all the way....It is all so believable, even when I want to knock Claire upside the head for being caught by the Redcoats ONE MORE TIME!!!!! JHRC! I am a writer and a very wise publisher once told me when I complained about Bella Swan acting so stupid I wanted to box her ears, that the writer did their job well, then didn't she?

7354402,5,B00M0GMBMC,"Brilliant transition from book to television series! The actors have done a wonderful job at portraying truthful, relatable characters, which were so artfully crafted by Diana Gabaldon (nice subtle cameo appearance by Ms. Gabaldon in episode four, The Gathering). As with all good stories, I love some characters and despise others, Claire, Jamie, Dougal, Mrs. Fitz and Murtagh, to name a few (Tobias Menzies is so versatile and effective as Frank and Jack, I cheer for one and curse the other). The conflict is tense and gritty, which drives the story forward, completely drawing me into the world of Outlander. I really appreciate how true the production is to the books. The attention to detail is amazing, from weapons and clothing to foliage hanging in the dungeon where Claire is compelled to work as a healer; the dedication to production values are a trully a tribute to the audience. Sets, costumes, make-up, fight sequences, special effects (i.e. Columns legs are an amazing, seamless effect) make the world of Outlander come to life. I would also like to give a special mention to the composer or music director. The music is subtle and emotionally driven. It pulls me into the highlands and makes me feel the story to my core (i.e. the haunting and beautiful music when the druids are dancing around the stones at Craigh Na Dun). Kudos to Mr. Moore, the writers, directors, artisans and actors of this well executed series. Well done! This is an amazing production! I can't wait to see more.",1473120000,,1503,4.898039215686275

7354437,2,B00M0GMBMC,My review is only for the season one-volume one. I have read the books by the way. All most didn't get past the first book. The reason for my criticism is the character Claire seems arrogant and has such a big smart alec mouth. The television version is not much better. All the actors seem to be well cast and perform well. Catriona is just not a very good actress.  When you first see Frank and Claire they are driving. He looks normal and she is grinning and moving around like she is at a modeling shoot. Every scene of her and Frank she is grinning and it looks a though she is constantly flirting with her husband. All her movements look like vogueing. So basically she looks like someone who is ACTING!  Other reviewers who complain about the sex are not reviewing volume one. Since I have read the books I know what is in volume 2 and it could be too much for some people. Volume one is pretty tame in that regard. The only reason I stuck it out with the books and the tv show is the character of Jamie. He is well written and well acted by Sam.  So far the books are better.,1472774400,,1083,4.172248803827751

7354442,2,B00M0GMBMC,"Gorgeous to look at! Costumes, locations all breathtakingly beautiful.
And yet...
I couldn't get past the first 50 pages of the book (only tried the first one) so never finished it. But I had a friend who raved about the series, so I watched the first season, even though I didn't much care for most of the characters.
The time travel ideas were compelling; the plot is what it is because in its heart of hearts, the story is a romantic bodice-ripper, which may explain why I found both lead characters unconvincing.
The female protagonist, Claire, seems to have no self-awareness at all, and no capacity to see anyone else's point of view. The character has 3 settings: happy, sad, and defiant. If she thought to consider her words and the impact of her actions, she would have - and cause - less drama and suffering for herself and others. But then, this sort of show needs to gin up drama, so her character makes sense from this point of view.
The male protagonist, Jamie, seems like a perfect guy. He is tall, handsome, muscular, has a great sense of humor, and is a paragon of virtue. Again, just the type of hero this type of story must have.
That said, I've never been a huge fan of Tobias Menzies, but in his dual roles here, he succeeds in presenting - convincingly - two very different characters, and finding the heart of darkness in one of them. When this dark character was onscreen, he was terrifying indeed.
Other than that, it devolves into soft-core porn; nothing wrong with that, but I was hoping for more.
I'll stick with Game of Thrones... the characters and dialog on that show feel absolutely real to me.",1472774400,5,1626,4.552901023890785

The series has enough history and  romance to keep me interested and enough conflict/plot tension to keep my husband watching, too.  The Scottish brogue is sometimes difficult to understand, but I appreciate the authenticity of the language, the costumes and the settings.

7354524,3,B00M0GMBMC,"Looks like many of the reviews refer to the Outlander series, not the DVD set.  I bought volumes one and two.  Very nice set but the discs I received skip badly.  Gave it 3 stars due to having the code for the online download.  I watch those from [...]  However, all four of the discs skip at some point and affect about 60% of the episodes.  It will blank, sometimes say ""invalid format"" and, then -- sometimes -- pick back up a few seconds or minutes later.  Tried the discs in a few different players, including a standard/used Blu-ray, a standard/brand new Blu-ray, and a wireless Blu-ray.  Majorly disappointed in the discs and annoyed that I didn't discover it until just after the 30 day return/exchange window.",1472083200,,718,4.5984251968503935

We are in droughtlander right now waiting for the new Season 3 to begin, so I am watching the whole series again from the beginning. I even purchased Starz for my IPad, so I can watch it anywhere at anytime.  My husband is taking me to Scotland in a few months, so I can see the land that I have fallen in love with while watching this series. Jamie and Claire's love story is so beautiful but there is also a lot of adventure and historical happenings, which makes for an all around wonderful story.  Adaptation from the books is different in parts but Ron Moore and his team have done an amazing job in keeping with the overall theme of the books, which makes us book fans very happy. The costumes and production are phenomenal and you can tell that a lot of time and effort have gone into making all things as accurate as possible for the time periods. If you have not read these books or seen this Starz production, please give yourself a gift and do both.

The landscapes and outdoor country scenes are lovely and make me want to go to Scotland. However, two things I don't like.

Claire off horse before ambush and her landing flawed by credibility of force, landing and the shot. Adaptation spot on.
S1 E2 - The barn scene: Jamie doesn't "" hold"" wounded or sore shoulder during eating scene. Unrealistic healing time and distraction for a film realist. Bandages confuse in this scene for me.

7354747,5,B00M0GMBMC,"I absolutely love this show!  I have my Amazon Prime Starz subscription specifically so I can watch it.  I am a bit of a history nut, so I love period dramas anyway.  This series fits right into that interest.  To begin with, the story is based on what I think are some great books and I really like the way those books are being adapted to TV.  I don't say that lightly.  I'm definitely the sort of person who usually always likes the books better than the TV or Film adaptations and I don't take kindly to screenwriters who think they can do a better job than the original author of the works.  That said, I really love the way this has been done.  I highly recommend this series if you like historical period romance.",1470096000,2,720,4.281481481481482

Glad that they are sticking closely to the events in the book. It is really nice to see it in action. I know our imagination can provide us an insight on what it must have been like, but seeing it in film makes it come to life more.

This is a very sweet, complicated love story, with beautiful historical details embedded in all facets of the show. It's also a very interesting take on time travel with a splash of Scottish folk lore to power the fantastical.  It's shot on location & the scenery is almost it's own character.  Love the costuming; very period appropriate. I'm an avid fiber artist & really like that they have employed local crafts people to create beautiful knit items from traditional patterns.
The actors sell the show and make you love & hate the characters. There are episodes I can't treat her because the are so so wrenching. Stars did a great job all around on this show.",1469923200,2,751,4.597014925373134

Ronald Moore who also developed the Battlestar Gallactica series, which was also captivating, has developed this show so if you know his work, you know it's good.

The acting is nuanced, genuine, and believable - particular stand-outs are Sam Heughan (Jamie Fraser), Caitriona Balfe (Claire Randall), Tobias Menzies (Frank/Jack Randall), Stephen Walters (Angus Mhor) and Graham McTavish (Dougal MacKenzie). Sets and costumes are much more than what you're used to seeing on television, writing is superb (especially anything penned by Matthew B.

7354829,5,B00M0GMBMC,"I enjoyed Outlander Season one Volume 1,  there are parts that I do not agree with, most of these are things that Moore changed, and added people  and things that were already there.  There was no need to change the ring, the original one was lovely, they used the key to Lallybroch. They could have used the key, and made the same lovely ring. They are putting more  sex into it supposedly to bring more readers into the fold.  The readers are already in there and Iike the  books  as  they  were  written,  Some sex is ok, but to put more than Diana put in is to take from her fantastic writing.  Her books do not have to have things thrown in or to bring more audience, The people already love her writing.  I feel if a book is full of sex, its because the author does not have the ability to keep their readers reading and interested.  Im afraid I went a little farther than just volume one.  I love the whole series, and have read it 3 times.  You always find something that may have been missed in the first 1 or 2 readings. I give it 5 stars because of Diana's writing, The books are strong enough to keep the reading and the viewing of the books enjoyable, and that is due to such great writing.  It is enjoyable to watch what you have already read, to see how much of the original book is left alone.  I realize things have to be changed a bit, because the time constrictions put in the viewing  compared with what you can read.  I still give it 5 stars, as I said because mostly because of the writing. Don't misunderstand me. Moore is doing a fantastic job filming Outlander.  I just hope he doesn't change too much.

7355069,3,B00M0GMBMC,"Okay series, but have not seen anything in this story-line that has not been done before by others.  In fact, wasn't Outlander about a British or Scot MAN that goes back in time?  I think this is the exact same thing, but from a woman's perspective.  The scenery is beautiful, but most of the United Kingdom rural areas are, whether your in the Highlands, or on the Emerald Isle.

Other than it is OK, I won't say more than that since many seem to think the world of this show.  I personally would not devout $40 for a season of this.",1468713600,,534,4.247524752475248
7355070,2,B00M0GMBMC,"The scenery, costumes, and acting are great in this series, however, the story is just bad and the characters are terrible. I have not read the books that this is based on, but I started watching because some of my friends were raving about it. It has a lot of things that I usually like: a little bit of fantasy, a little bit of historical fiction, some romance. Every time one of the main characters tells the other one to do or not do something, the other one does exactly the opposite. Then one of them gets captured. Then there's a ridiculous escape/rescue. Then they are angry with each other, then they cry, then they make love. Wash, rinse, repeat. This sequence gets boring really quickly.

The three main actors (that play Claire, Jamie, and Randall) are great, and they have chemistry that you can feel from their first scenes together, especially Claire and Jamie. The supporting actors are also good, and the roles provide some much needed humor breaks from all the crying and tragedy between Jamie and Claire.

The last two episodes were unwatchable due to the EXTREME and gruesome violence and torture (mental, emotional, and physical). I had to fast forward through about 90 minutes total. Besides that sequence, the entire series is filled with rapes, near/almost rapes, and gratuitous violence. I'm not squeamish or a prude, but this was just over the top, and I don't condone using rape/violence/torture as a plot device. Ugh.",1468713600,19,1445,4.82258064516129

It was good to see how men and women lived, in this era.  Watching this movie makes you think about all the wonderful things we take for granted. For me running women having a voice, water, vehicles, feminine products, paved roads, blow-dryer, cloths that aren't so heavy to wear, toilet paper and bathrooms are a few of the things that come to mind.  I am sure there are more things that I am missing. You are going to love this series.  I am not one to get excited about good looking men but Sam is on another whole level of hotness! Wow!

7355111,5,B00M0GMBMC,"This series was recommended by my daughter-in-law. I was hesitant to purchase the entire first season as I haven't even seen one episode. I am not disappointed at all. The storyline keeps you involved to the point where I have to turn it off as the hour gets late. The actors are terrific. Claire is strong, confident with firey independent spirit considering women's roles in both timelines. Frank's dual character is handled brilliantly and Jamie is boyish with an induring attraction as innocent and manly which makes me wish I was Claire. The Scottish accent can be hard to catch from time to time but that's why Closed Caption is an option. Love the show and will not hesitate to purchase Season 2.",1468627200,,703,4.723577235772358

The books are excellent, well written and researched so as to make this period piece feel real.  The TV series by necessity cannot developed characters (minor) to the same extent as the books do and that is understandable.  Abridging the story is also understandable.  A couple of things were added thus far that were not in the books (Frank''s quest for Claire and his despair was not related in the books) and that was a pleasant addition.  We all have our own ideas as to what the characters from the books look like and my Jamie was hit right on the nose.  Claire not so much, her acting has done the book character justice though.  All in all a most enjoyable and entertaining cinema experience.",1468540800,,826,4.578231292517007

7355260,1,B00M0GMBMC,I read and liked the first book. The first several episodes of season 1 were just ok. Whole episodes devoted to cruelty and sex is a tragedy. What a waste of time and money. Some things are better left for the imagination. Claire uses words and phrases that no one in Gaelic speaking Scotland would even begin to understand-especially in the 18th century. Unrealistic and above all - TRASHY! It is a shame because the scenery and costumes are gorgeous.,1468281600,9,452,4.6625
7355261,5,B00M0GMBMC,I love this show.,1468281600,,17,3.5
7355262,2,B00M0GMBMC,"BE WARNED - This show has a multiple personality problem. Vol. 1 is a captivating historical drama sprinkled with romance, but  in vol. 2  it turns into RAPE PORN. I'm not joking. Consider watching this show very carefully, because some images may stay with you.

Outlander's1st season with its 16 episodes was aired in 2 parts, 8 episodes each  ( here on Amazon It's referred to as  season 1 vol. 1 and vol. 2 ). I watched it on Starz channel and was totally hooked by the first part. Unfortunately I did not know the show would turn so violent and disturbing at the second part.  Had I known it in advance I would not have started watching it in the first place.

I did not read the book or heard of it prior to watching the show, so had no way of telling exactly what it's about. Usually I steer clear of the romance aisle in book stores but the show is done very cleverly, and it drew me in intro a setting of a rich and detailed historical drama. Romance came into the picture a little later, and when it did it was very touching and beautiful.
Even for a cynic such as myself It was simply impossible not to fall in love with Jamie Fraser ( super hot Sam Hughan ) and to root for his love affair with the other main character. By episode 7 I was down with the whole romantic stuff, and then came along Episode 8 ( both sides now ) with a HUGE cliff hanger, and I was left at the edge of my seat awaiting, anxiously,  the next episode that was like 6 MONTHS away.

Needless to say my expectations were high. I totally obsessed about the show, and convinced a great number of people to watch it. After a 6 months break the wait was over, and vol. 2 aired - and what started as a swashbuckling romance turned into a hard core rape porn.

Game of thrones got a lot attention and criticism for their excessive use of violence and sex, but it is NOTHING compared to the scenes awaiting for you here. Since this is not a fantasy TV show with snow zombies and dragons, every thing here seems much. much more real.  Just like in GOT the impact of the show lies heavily on production value, and it's stunningly beautiful and seems very accurate. Outlander's set designers and costume department made an epic and triumphant effort to transport you to the 18th century Scottish highlands, but sadly, it seems that there was a special department there that made the same effort to construct hyper realistic and detailed torture and rape scenes, designed to make you feel you are in the same room where they take place.
There is a whole episode that lingers on and on an on on those LONG rape scenes, savouring every minute of physical, sexual and emotional abuse one can think of. It was horrible to watch, and I'm very sorry I did.
By that time I was totally invested in the story and in the characters and I just had to see what happens ,and although I knew by then that things are about to turn ugly ( from the producers and actors commenting online on what's ahead ), I could not believe how far they would go  and portray shocking cruelty with so much detail.

Other than the fact that I was heart broken for my beloved fictional characters being abused and tortured , I find that the way it was portrayed in the show outraging for more reasons than the fact that it wasn't nice to watch. It took me a few days to recover from the last two episodes, and I felt disgusted and manipulated into watching something I would never have watched. I feel like i was lured to be a deprived peeper who pressed ""play"" and watches a video that shows ISIS beheading someone or doing some other horrific things just out of curiosity.
I'm sorry, I'm not curious about abuse and and I do not want to watch things like that.

There are a lot of die hard fans of the Outlander book series that might claim that all the sexual violence is in the book and that it's a vital part of the story and character's development, and that it was important to show it in this shocking manner. I disagree in advance.  For starters -  I fail to see the ""beauty"" and the value of those scenes in the book, where the author just goes out of her way to think of sadistic ways to torment and humiliate human beings. I honestly can't understand those who read that book and enjoyed it. But let's leave that point aside -  Books and TV are very different media, and you know what they say - a picture is worth a thousand words. What's shocking to read is a thousand times more shocking to watch.  I still shiver.",1468281600,2,4471,4.296076099881094

I was really disappointed because I was already into the TV series. Now, I can't watch it because it is too inappropriate. They sort of ruined the show for me :(",1468022400,,512,4.516129032258065

7355318,5,B00M0GMBMC,"I absolutely love this show.  The characters are rich and storyline is always moving with twists and turns.  After watching the first season I sought out the books because I had to know what happens next.  I pleasantly surprised to find that the show follows the storyline of the books.  Unlike other shows that have simply ruined the story from the book, this one adds to it.  Whenever the show deviates from the books it is small and adds to the richness of the story.
It is well written and well acted.  It is not a family show, be forewarned of significant, graphic violence and nudity.  It is a show for adults.
The final episode - spoiler alert - Jamie is held prisoner by Capt. Jack Randall. I had been warned about the extreme violence in this episode and have never watched the ""breaking"" of Jamie.  Fast forward is my friend.  I watched the aftermath of that and the impact on Jamie and his wife.
Despite those scenes, I still love the storyline, the characters and the way it is brought to the screen!  I hope they make all 9 books.",1467763200,,1043,4.4136125654450264

7355365,2,B00M0GMBMC,"I heard a lot about this show and thought I would try it out, but unfortunately it is very girly girl and all about emotions and surface material and little else. There are no twists and turns or any real strategy / story just ... sigh ... soft porn and a woman who thinks herself better than everyone else. She's annoying and he's hot at the beginning and then he slowly loses his manhood and becomes ridiculous. I have never seen a story or show so convenient in it's happenings. Things just happen as needed, no real reason or intelligence to it, it just happens. A woman just happens to get past all these soldiers unarmed to reach the dungeons to save her husband by herself ... ugh  ... please. Don't expect anything more than emotions and girly girl ordeals, this is not Game of Thrones or anywhere close to. I should say I'm not a girly girl, and I hate predictable writing and whiny women so clearly this was not my show to begin with so take it for what it's worth. I gave it two stars because it's not a horrible series it's just not my kind of series or rather it's very simple.",1467244800,2,1090,4.29126213592233

7355373,5,B00M0GMBMC,After reading this.. I was sceptical when I first saw that a show had been made from the book. After all.. it doesn't always work does it? They certainly had no trouble reminding me this time what a great story it is. I felt as if I curled up with the book.. transported in time once again. Bravo to the Writers.. the Cast.. Crew.. and Amazon!!,1467158400,,344,4.2272727272727275
7355374,3,B00M0GMBMC,"There's something missing in Outlander. Let's see: beautiful cinematography? Yes, stunning at times. Authentic accents? Aye, laddie and lassie. Accurate costuming? Who can be sure, but it sure LOOKS authentic. Acting up to snuff? That too.
Oh, it's compelling alright. It's taken from a historical romance series, I gather, and there's nothing wrong with that. The acting seems solid too. AND, there's even a literal bodice ripper (from Season 1, volume 1).
The characters are lovely to look at and handsomely rugged too.
There are many things to like, for sure. But I think it's the writing that has it fall flat. Not always, but enough to jar you out of your evening reverie as you are carried away to 18th century Scotland.",1467158400,,726,4.9105691056910565

7355390,5,B00M0GMBMC,"As a Scot - thought it as close a rendition as I have seen of the mores of the times (and may help explain why we have 'differences' with/to the English....However much better it is than Braveheart (450 years previously)  there are a couple of criticisms
-1) you MUST be aware that if it is a PAL dvd  will NOTplay on NTSC/Region 1,(which are US /Canada only)....Europe is Region2....so ensure your dvd player will handle it -OR get  a region free-We have the same problems in reverse using your dvds -but read the packaging!)
2) ALthough there are subtitles in 4-5 languages Why oh Why did they not have the sections in native Gaelic (the old language of the Highlands)-subtitled at the very least??? I can understand it may add a certain layer of authenticity to the main character as being in an ''alien'' environment as is frequently mentioned, but just to say 'speaks in Other language'' is somewhat insulting in this case...
3) for those who find it a bit 'rough and ready....well, it was ...modern sensibilties are perhaps so 'PC some may forget that it wasn't always so.....and be happy we live in an age of central heating and -so far- still functioning anti-biotics.
so.although I haven't finished the first series yet I am fairly confident  that the levels of behaviour shown are reasonably representative of the age.....and certainly how different cultures on these islands treated each other.....and that loyalty is earned....not 'bought' (or should i say rented' -that has a different name here.
4) One or two anachronisms have crept in....For instance the lawyer uses 'OK' which ,as far as I am aware wasn't used in the UK till WWII and I was surprised she hadn't been hung  (or burned)as a witch by about episode 4 or 5.....
5) while the origin of thename cruil]kshank may have become apparent he level of dentition in thefilm  is(of course)MUCH higher than in those days.....and almost everyone  has shoes !!!",1467158400,4,1926,4.818181818181818

As an avid reader of the books, I will say that you want to gripe about it but the reality is that you may not find the perfect actor who is going to look exactly like Ms. Gabaldon describes each character.  So the actors are excellent because of their abilities to encapsulate the essence of each character.  I very much enjoyed this translation from page to screen.

The show has done a fabulous job of adapting the book to a television format without sacrificing plot points or having to change many things at all, which I really appreciate.

I do enjoy it from an aesthetic standpoint, as Scotland's stark beauty is captivating; I am planning my vacation there for next year! I do enjoy it from a history standpoint as well. As the series went on though, I found myself disliking the main character of Claire, as well as just not buying her rapid adjustment to life in the 18th century. Let's imagine for a minute, in the blink of an eye, finding ourselves 200 years in the past. It would be devastating and completely and utterly terrifying...to start! Absolutely everything and everyone u know is gone...poof! It was just too easy. Claire, as a person...well...she is not a good one. Selfish, arrogant, outspoken in the worst way, reckless, heartless, vain, disloyal (to Frank), etc. I just ultimately had no interest in following what happens to such a person.",1466899200,2,891,4.830065359477124

The casting is spot on, the writing and acting is superb, and when they deviate from the book it's minor and very well done.

7355472,5,B00M0GMBMC,"Initially I checked this series out at the Library, because it looked interesting.  I fell in love with it immediately!  I had to own it, so I bought it from Amazon.  The second season is currently under way on Starz, but I don't have cable.  I can't wait to see season 2!  The story is based on the books by Diana Gabaldon.  Her Outlander series currently totals 8 books.  I have started to read the series.  Each book is over 600 pages long, so it will take a while.  The TV series does an excellent job of following the characters and scenes written in the books. However, I do find the TV series more enthralling, because the characters are much more animated with their Scottish accents, which is not as clearly indicated in the books.  The first season (Volume one and Volume two) only covers the first book Outlander.  The story line is interesting, because it throws a married woman for 1945 into a dangerous Scotland in 1743, under British rule.  She is a head-strong independent modern woman who has to come to terms with 1743 society where women were in constant peril and had little say or control over their own lives.  She initially finds herself in the position of being suspected as a spy by both the Scottish clan that is keeping her, and by the British. In order to protect her from the evil hands of her 1945 husband's ancestor, the clan decides it would be best for all concerned if she married Jamie, who is a relative of the clan's leaders.  She struggles with the morality of being married to two different men, from two different times, but does her best to cope with her current situation, when all she really wanted was to find a way home.  Under the circumstances, she starts to fall in love with her new husband, but Scottish life continues, with its ups, downs, and political intrigues, and she continues to serve as the healer (because she is a nurse) for the clan. Because she is from the future, she also has some knowledge of events that are about to unfold that may be used to help the clan she is with, especially since she is now a member of it.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outlander-Season-One-Volume-One-Blu-ray-UltraViolet/dp/B00RLK35H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Outlander: Season One - Volume One (Blu-ray + UltraViolet)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outlander-Season-One-Volume-Two-Blu-ray/dp/B00VMIU3CO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Outlander: Season One - Volume Two [Blu-ray</a>]",1466812800,2,2505,5.2275

Outlander doesn't shy away from dealing with even the most difficult of topics such as all the brutality of war and the savagery that man is capable of at times, such as rape and torture.  But there is also plenty of love, romance and of course sex to help balance things out a bit throughout the episodes, making Outlander a truly great experience to watch and become part of.

Not only is the plot interesting, but the characters have magnificent chemistry, especially the main characters Claire and Jamie.

7355567,5,B00M0GMBMC,"I've read all the books, and this film is very true to the story. Because it's complex, the film uses flashbacks (or flash-forwards?!) to help explain what's going on and why Claire makes certain decisions.
However, my husband, who has not read the books, has a bit of a hard time with the characters, and is glad to have me with him to explain who is who - but when I first read the books, I had a similar problem. Still, the gist of the story pulls you along it's still enthralling.
It is a very suspenseful tale, and beautifully portrays the dangers of life in 17th century Scotland. The main characters (Claire and Jaime) are well chosen for their roles, and the dynamic between them is intense.
Readers of Diana Gabaldon's books will not be disappointed!",1466208000,2,759,4.547445255474453

The last episode was extremely difficult to watch, however, and I cannot watch it again. The love story between Claire and Jamie is beautiful.

7355656,4,B00M0GMBMC,"Stubble upon this by accident and since we were ready for a new ""binge worthy"" show decided to try it.  It sneakily pulls you it and before you know it you hooked.  Spoiler alert: cool how the second half of the first season appears to be told by Jaime rather than Clare.  Love it for chance of perspective.  And all along you wonder after meeting the infamous Black Jack Randall, how Clare will ever try to find her way home or have fears of who's lies deep inside current day Jack/James and will it surface if Clare returns.  Definitely hooked at this point. Interesting to see where this leads.  PS. If you like Scotish/Bristish history, you will even enjoy more.  A romance novel perhaps for everyone.",1465689600,,705,4.5476190476190474

7355664,4,B00M0GMBMC,"Great story. It's over the top with the nudity and sex scenes. Steamy but distracting. It's a good enough plot and depiction that the graphic romance stuff isn't necessary to maintain the viewer's interest. This story has a magnetic leading man, feisty leading woman, supremely villainous bad guy, great camera work, costumes, scenery, supporting cast, and ya gotta love those Scottish accents!",1465689600,,394,5.370967741935484

I love the characters.  Would be nice if more characters are developed.  Wives children etc. It is a good story.  Sad with all the brutality of the world.  It is the human condition.  SO far I like the courage and commitment it portrays.  It is not easy to stay committed to overcoming.  It takes character.",1465689600,,434,4.4743589743589745

7355670,5,B00M0GMBMC,"Beautifully rendered film of Diana Gabaldon's book - Outlander!!  I have read this series a number of times and am very impressed by the interpretation of her work.  The characters are stunningly portrayed...the filming is magnificent and I am so pleased to see these characters come to life through this medium.  Oh and I forgot to mention the costuming!  Terry Dresbach (costume designer) is a magical being with magical thinking and magical creativity...how she and her crew create all of the garments and accessories required for this show is beyond me!  I believe everything is made as there certainly isn't a warehouse filled with 18th century clothing and accessories for hire!  Back to the filming - the sets and environments for filming are breath taking...every item, every detail is spectacular.  Thank you all for creating such a beautiful series!",1465689600,2,859,5.136690647482014

7355673,5,B00M0GMBMC,"The entire series is stupendous! Each episode is faithful to Gabaldon's series of books...so far. The historical realism is unlike any other history series, including The Vikings. The actors and their characters 'grow on you' with each episode, especially Jamie and Claire. The unfolding of their relationship....the development of their 'soul mate romance' will challenge you to rethink the meaning of love.",1465689600,,408,5.596774193548387

7355678,4,B00M0GMBMC,Amazing acting and realistic 18th century for the most part. Loses a star for flashing to her back in the 1940's in beginning of season 2. And a little too keen on rape. But really a fab series outside those few points,1465689600,,218,4.214285714285714

7355696,5,B00M0GMBMC,"Great show. Probably more geared more towards female viewers. Never read the books. The only bummer is that to buy a whole season you have to make two purchases. I've been rewatching season 1, and waiting for season 2.",1465430400,,218,4.615384615384615

Dogmatic restrictions to the exact text hardly ever work (Season One of Game of Thrones a notable exception).  Outlander stays in the spirit of the book while making small textual, narrative, and story changes to better fit ""the small screen"".

Um . . . not for the kiddies.  Dang near some ""Red Shoes Diary"" scenes, haha.  Enjoy some ""adult time"" and watch this series.  You won't be sorry.",1465430400,,510,4.419354838709677

I was glad to see the series, but the thing is a hot mess. Some bits good and others abysmal.  The bad really sours what is left.

Cable and the insistence of near porn. The rise and fall of vpices- indistinguisable, difficult to grasp.

At first, it was a bit of a shock seeing the characters on screen but not quite how I had them pictured.  I soon recovered however and am impressed with all the actors talent and abilities as well as the screen writers and whomever else may be involved in staying so true to the book and for creating such beautiful historical time periods.  For those interested in the series but are not familiar with the book, there is graphic content - mostly sexual.  I can assure all that this is ""simply"" how it was written, however I believe the book allows for more nuanced explanations for the why's and wherefores which make it more an understandable part of some characters as opposed to what might easily be construed as gratuitous sex scenes.

The books are incredibly written and the history impressively researched.  The series being created for Starz seems to be just the same.  Highly recommend!!",1464825600,2,976,4.705882352941177

7355834,5,B00M0GMBMC,"Years ago a literary friend recommended the Outlander novels by Diana Gabaldon, assuring me they were excellent. But I had a knee-jerk negative reaction to the fantasy aspect and never took her advice. My mistake! Gabaldon holds a PhD in quantitative behavioral ecology, so she's no dummy. The magnificent world she created is gritty, absorbing, and brought vividly to life in this outstanding production. Sure, the protagonist, Claire, is stunning, and her 18th century love Jamie is pure eye candy. But the themes, plot lines, and character development delight the intellect as well. Claire is every bit equal to the male characters, which led BuzzFeed to dub Outlander the feminist answer to 'Game of Thrones.'"" I intended to watch only during the one-week free trial period. Ha!

Over all the premise seems promising with lots of potential for an interesting story line... then it just bogs  down into a novella soap opera with the same old same old. If one is a fan of network TV and watches the lifetime channel then this show is for you. If you are more inclined toward the outside of the box creative story telling this show is not for you. Think ""Downton Abby"" mixed with the ""Time  Traveler's Wife"" set in Scotland. Beautiful scenery, Historically accurate to a point but bland story that is just a rehash of things you have seen before. It's trying very hard to be something and it is missing the mark.

A few minutes after being transported back 200 years, give or take, our plucky heroine expertly analyzes what has transpired, trims her sails and sets her course through what is about to befall her. If that's not plucky...All the characters are here, in place and on cue: The Handsome Stranger, The Dastardly Villain(s), The Roly-Poly Cook, ready with a ""cuppa brooth"" and a wardrobe that needs no alterations to turn our no-nonsense time traveler into the Belle o' the Ball. Hoot, Mon! But there's treachery afoot! Knowing glances and backhanded stage whispers abound as our...here it comes!... plucky imposter bungles her way through court intrigue and lustful innuendoes spewed by grubby but noble Highlanders that seem to carry their blankets around with them at all times.

Thank goodness, I didn't watch it with my mother or sons, I would have been mortified.  It does not warrant 5 stars and cannot imagine anyone sitting through the entire torture and rape scene.  I am compelled to write this review to bring down the rating to something more realistic and forewarn viewers.  Too bad the writers and director don't realize that a suggestion of what occurred would be better than these embarrassing scenes.",1464566400,,696,5.1875

On the other hand, the changes that have been made are improvements over the books. Actors are quite good. Love the costumes. (Although, it seems as if Claire has far too many dresses that are far too nice for the situation. Attempting to run away in a formal ball gown seemed a bit much. Beautiful, though!) I particularly like the way the video blends the past and the present. That's one of the improvements over the books.

7355893,5,B00M0GMBMC,"As an adamant fan and follower of Gabaldon's books for 20+ years, I was hesitant about purchasing this series.  The characters of Jamie and Claire are beloved to me.  I couldn't image how the breadth and depth of the characters, or the complex story told through her many books, could ever truly be brought to the screen with any justice.  But, I was wrong.  This series is as true a representation of the original books as I think could be made.  Visually it is heartstopping.  The costumes/sets authentic.  And the acting... Sam Heughan and Catriona Balfe (unknown to me prior to this series) are beyond belief.  I never would have thought anyone could so embody the characters of Jamie and Claire.  In fact, I didn't even want to see anyone try.  But, having now been swept up in viewing three seasons, I can no longer read the books without seeing the faces of Heughan and Balfe, and it makes the books even more poignant.  The episodes are stunning in their graphic portrayal of the books.  Many viewers will be repulsed by the violence and sexual content.  But, like the books, the series does a masterful job of weaving a timeless love story through a period of extreme violence and loss.  Not for everyone, but for fans of Gabaldon's books the series will leave you speechless.",1464566400,,1285,4.653333333333333

The lead actors, Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan fit my vision of Claire & Jamie to a tee.  The supporting cast is equally outstanding, especially Tobias Menzies in his duel role.  I discovered the Starz show first and then began reading the beautifully written books by Diana Gabaldon.  The show is currently at book 2, I am at book 5.  I strongly recommend you read along or ahead. There are differences, as you would expect, between the two versions, but the creators of this show really have tried to keep the spirit and intent of the books in tact while having to move the story along at a much bigger pace.  The locations, the sets, are spectacular. I don't know how they can afford to create the world of 18th century Scotland and Paris.  The costumes alone must cost a fortune. Attention to detail makes me feel as if I am living this adventure with them. The books are all quite large. I am totally addicted and have found lots of fellow Outlanders to chat with on social media.

I ended up enjoying the season quite a bit and looked forward to the next season with gusto.  Great acting, beautiful scenery, beautiful actors and yes, the costumes were nice too.

Viewers beware when watching this series you will be subjected to sadism and to the rape of a man and a small child. When did it become OK (LEGAL) and fashionable for actors, producers and directors to make visual representations of sexual violence to such a realistic degree? How is it legal for a child actor to play the part of a rape victim?  When did this become acceptable, that we pay hard earned money to allow this horror into our homes, with NO clear warning? Surely, such things cannot pass for entertainment? We do not need to film sexually violent situations acted out to such a high visceral level as this, in order to make viewers have an emotional response or for an attempt at historical accuracy. A hint, is just fine. Those of us with imaginations can fill in the details, if we so wish.

7355970,4,B00M0GMBMC,"I just finished episode 8 of the first season of ""Outlander."" I thought for $24.00 I had purchased the entire 16 episodes, so I was disappointed when my video feed ended at episode 8.
However, I did enjoy the series. The casting is PERFECT!
I have to begin by saying that I have read ALL of the OUTLANDER novels and adored them. The writing is magnificent, with humor and great characterizations. The TV series has wonderful acting but Claire and Jaime are a bit different from what I had in my mind, but very close.
I think Frank/Black Jack is an excellent actor!! I would love to continue watching him but I'm not going to pay the money.
I cannot give five stars simply because of the graphic nudity and sex. Yes, there is graphic sex in the novels but I guess I don't remember that there is so much. I think it's a bit gratuitous in the series.
I did go ahead and buy the musical score for the series, as it is beautiful and very haunting. For the music and scenery alone, I would watch the series again.",1464048000,3,1007,4.3052631578947365

7355973,3,B00M0GMBMC,"If I had not read the book I would have loved the series I think.  But the books are not only a LOT better, the story is changed in the first season and in the second season it is changed even more.  I'm not talking about leaving things out like I know has to happen but they have CHANGED the story.  Also the character of Claire has changed!  She really pisses me off in the series but in the books I really like her.  She is stupid and arrogant and makes decisions no 21st century woman with any sense of history would make in the series.  But in the book she is true to character.  I do not like the changes to the story in the series it cheapens the story and lessens the depth of it as well.  I think they could have done a much better job I am very disappointed in it.",1464048000,3,774,3.9483870967741934

What wonderful actors. The man who plays Captain Jack is just terrific. I read the books many years ago.  They are still my favorite books. It's the only time a stayed up all night reading.

7356030,4,B00M0GMBMC,"I give this series 4 and a half stars.  The historical recreation of both 1945 UK and 1743 UK are very convincing.  Being a stickler for historical accuracy, I couldn't give them 5 stars due to some inaccurate statements such as when Frank Randall in 1945, said to be a huge European history buff, incorrectly said that the Scottish Highlanders and other soldiers who fought against the army of King George II were armed mostly with broadswords.  In fact, most of the rebels had matchlock muskets.  They lost the Battle of Culloden bigtime because of exhaustion, poor leadership, and much inferior use of their artillery, which was also inferior in number to those had by the Duke of Cumberland.  But Frank was right about the violent suppression and dismantling of the Scottish Clan system after Culloden and about the Highlanders not being allowed to carry swords afterwards.  Caitriona Balfe does a marathon job of acting in a show where she is almost always in the spotlight.  Also, Tobias Menzies does a remarkable job of playing 2 men with practically opposite personalities.  He portrays the monstrous, sadistic Black Jack Randall with chilling and deep effect.",1463875200,3,1168,4.984536082474227

There was no way it could be done. I finally broke down and watched it a few  weeks ago. It is WONDERFUL! I couldn't believe it. The actors are ALL great. Its stayed true to the books this far. My favorite part had been as a fiber artist I'm blown away by the costumes and fabrics.(There is now a knitting book out so we can make Claire's cowls,gloves, stockings,etc.)  It's a beautifully done program in every way.

And also too real. I like my shows a little bit more happy with rainbows and unicorns. But this has a LOT of violence and and the bad guy is so horrible it literally almost makes me not want to watch it. He is just that awful. But the chemistry between the main characters is so real I almost forget this is a tv show. Either way, I will keep watching it.

At first I wasn't sure about the show and because I never read the series, I felt that I would be left out of the loop on some things; but I was wrong. Claire's Journey through time from post World War 1940's (which is an interesting time period to begin, but I'm told that further in the series the characters are met in present day. so make sure to keep up) to mid 18th century from a set of stones in the Scottish Highlands. From there, it gets interesting and even if your not a serious history buff then the romantic story between Claire and (oh so ever HOT and SEXY) Jamie is worth watching. Though I can't help wondering if she was meant to be there and help cause a lot of that country's history. ~smirks~ Thats the thing about stories with the time travel effect, you get more questions then answers..........",1463184000,3,868,4.43125

7356187,5,B00M0GMBMC,"I have been waiting for some sort of video for this book series, a movie, a television show, something, anything. The series of books is fantastic and I think the actors are doing an amazing job of representing their characters from the book. My only complaint would be that I wish they weren't split into 2 volumes, but they follow the storyline incredibly close and I really have become invested in their characters. Can't wait for season 2 to be out on DVD or Blu-ray, I know you can subscribe to Showtime to watch it but I prefer having a hard copy so I can watch them over and over!
Honestly I wish there were more books telling me what happens after the characters reunite after book 8 but that is just my wishful thinking. A great show!

The settings and acting are superb. Many people will be intrigued by references to the supernatural, changeling, pagan rites etc. These beliefs still persist in the Highlands as does the distrust of outsiders I don't consider this a time travel book, though.

The love story between Jamie and Claire was so beautiful and touching that I longed for them to be able to be together without the strife and pain that was constantly haunting them at every corner.
The sadistic, evil and disgusting Black Jack Randall never ceased to make me feel sick to my stomach.

It is sensually and sexually rich, deeply romantic and gritty at turns.  Caitriona Balfe as Claire Fraser, Tobias Menzies as both Frank and Jonathon Randall, and Sam Heugen as Jaime Fraser are nothing short of brilliant.  The rest of the cast also shines in a textured portrayal of a most unexpected love triangle, lived out across two centuries of English and Scots history.

The basic story of Claire's struggle to fit into a totally new culture where all the important characters know she is not telling the truth is fascinating. The characters are wonderful. The acting is great. The fights are reminiscent of the Vikings. The politics are complex. The scenery is expansive. The castles and countryside seem totally authentic. The villains are nasty. The sex is erotic. I have no trouble believing that the stories are true to actual history, perhaps save the ""witchcraft"" and time travel.

It does deserve its MA rating. The scenes that earned this rating are done with taste and refinement.

I was concerned the movie would not be able to capture the ""essence"" of the characters and the story as it was written. I was pleasantly surprised. I think it is a wonderful production and it lets me relive all of the same feelings I felt when reading the book.

7356297,4,B00M0GMBMC,"The TV show is like Cliff notes for the actual books.  But there is no way a TV show could go to the level of detail that the books do.  That being said, the STARs series is trying valiantly to be faithful to the spirit of the books and provide new content to build on the story that Diana Gabaldon created.  The costumes alone are worth the price of the STARs subscription!  And the locations are just as I imagined they should be.  Caitriona Balfe is the perfect Claire.  Astounding.  Sam Heughan looks the part and acts the part, but he has a bit of growth to do to become the larger than life real MAN that Jamie is in the books.  I think it has to do with an inner sense of history and spark of iron that it took to be a man in those times.  Who knows?  All in all, I recommend watching the series, but I recommend reading the books more.",1462752000,,843,4.054545454545455

7356319,2,B00M0GMBMC,"I started watching this series with hope and anticipation.  I continued to watch it even though I lost the hope, and finally the anticipation of episodes to come.  I expected an exciting fantasy, but what I got was an endless, boring love story, sprinkled with a few scenes of fun, gratuitous violence, and the occasional male tumescence.  I've nothing against love stories, but if I want to watch one that's what I'll stream, not a show that touts itself as an exciting fantasy.

In conclusion, I cannot recommend this series.  Perhaps it will get better, as I only managed to make it through 6 episodes, but, for me it was downright painful to watch.  That being said I don't wish to diminish the achievements of the actors, the director, or those fantastic set/costume folks.  As a period piece it sets itself up quite nicely.  In point of fact it's clear the team works hard at doing their job, and extra hard, unfortunately, at turning what could have been a thrilling, exciting trip into fantasyland, but that's not their fault.  That's the flawed script derived from the written stories of Diana Gabaldon, who may well have set up to write a love story after all.  If so, she succeeded.",1462665600,2,1193,4.6923076923076925

7356331,3,B00M0GMBMC,"Very atmospheric in parts and set against the majestic backdrop of the Highlands, but the action is too slow and the dialogue is often clumsy and wooden. The series is unfair to both the Scots and the English of 1743 who are mostly painted as brutish and foul-mouthed louts and low-lifes. There is no resemblance to David Balfour and Alan Breck Stewart in R. L. Stevenson's Kidnapped. That is not to say that there aren't quite a few strong performances (Colum, the chief of the Mackenzie clan and his brother, Dougal, Mrs Fitzgibbons, and the lawyer who accompanies Dougal on his round of rent collecting). Claire's other love interest, Jamie Fraser, is too good to be true. The series has an obsession with rape (or near-rape) and torture which it portrays in almost loving detail and which are allowed to slow the action to a snail's pace.",1462579200,,842,4.73469387755102

7356361,5,B00M0GMBMC,"While it can't match the books because we miss some of the sharp tongued and hilarious internal reflections and musings of Claire, the series is quite satisfying.  Also, what a relief to have the consistent use of a feminist perspective as Claire's sexuality is expressed on screen.  There is a lot of TV and film that I decline to watch because rape is used as a plot device.  But the Outlander series manages to deal with the threat of rape, and the evils of Black Jack Randal, while addressing the deep psychological damage created in full-bodied characters.  My only objection is that the gay characters are drawn as perverted (Black Jack and Sandringham), or as foppish (Sandringham), not as individuals figuring out a way to live well in a heterocentric society--but that is an issue I have with the books, as well as the TV series.",1462492800,,838,4.719178082191781

The evolution of Jamie & Claire's attachment is extremely well acted and convinces you they would die for each other.

7356481,2,B00M0GMBMC,"This was one of our favorite new shows, packed with exciting episodes.  We couldn't wait for the next show.  The entire year was incredible.  So far, this show has morphed into a period talk fest that is boring in my eyes.  The first episode of season 2 started out great with Claire's return to 1940's England and her loving husband very glad to see and care for her.
Next thing you know she's on a ship with her husband Jamie from 150 years ago.  I don't understand how she just reappeared to the past again.
When they arrive in Paris, that is where this show turned to the talk fest.  Even the sex scenes have been tamed down to boring.
Without being snarky or rude, can anyone explain all this to me?  I understand their purpose of heading off the war.  I'll try to watch a couple of more episodes and hope it gets better.

7356495,5,B00M0GMBMC,Like tobacco and caffeinated beverages this show is easy to get hooked on. Caitriona Balfe is a superb actress. This is a great escapist show and recommended for those who like period pieces where one can suspend reality for just a bit. The characters are relative well developed and each episode will keep you on the edge of your seat. The costuming is interesting (of course there seems to be the omnipresent cleavage dresses) and the grimy aspects of ever day living in 1700s Scotland adds to the fun. Not sure how long they'll be able to string this one out until they run out of story but this first year has been great for end of the evening watching. One warning - the first episode is slow developing so you need to stick with it at least through episode 2.,1461974400,,765,4.432624113475177

7356506,3,B00M0GMBMC,"Too coincidental for my liking.  Druids were around for a long time, apparently their 4th and most recent revival was in the 16th century, which is the 1500s, so when this woman is at a Druid site and taken back in time why is it exactly the time frame that her husband is interested in and researching?  Why not the 1500s or even 3000 BC when Druids first came about?  Yeah, it's fiction, but this coincidence bugs the heck out of me.  Everything is built on this flashback in time and she wasn't doing anything at the time she time traveled that would specifically link her to that very particular time frame.  She was picking a flower... heck, she should go back to the time that flower germinated, which would make at a little sense..

7356591,5,B00M0GMBMC,"while definately not for children or sensitive adults as there are graphic scenes, this is an excellent series made from the books.
The author makes a cameo appearance too. At the end of each show, there is a very interesting interview with the director, Roger Moore,
 a costume designer and others concerning some of their choices for script, costuming, scenery. These will give an rich view of the
period, why if may or may not differ from the books, and their choices as artists...and that they are in full.
If the viewer has read the books, they may find some things changed or left out, but that is the way of movies...not all can be included due to the time frame. However, much can be ""seen"" that takes many words to describe.  The actors are wonderful, well cast in their parts and should receive many awards, hopefully. I hope to see them again in many films. The Director, Roger Moore, was an excellent choice for the making of Outlander.
The crew and many people responsible for making this such an incredibly beautiful, visual film....well, I just can't say enough good things about them.  They are highly skilled, for sure, and have hearts and minds of artists.  As a historical romance, and that is ROMANCE in capital letters,
it is rich, dense, and seamless.  Odd words, perhaps to describe a romance, but there are lovely and tender visuals which are balance with
the beautiful scenes of countryside. It gives the viewer a groundedness even though it is basically a ""time traveler"" theme.
I, of course, binge-watched the entire series!
Things to watch for:  can you catch any of the Computer Graphic inserts? (explained by the Director)
Costumes:  incredible and they spared nothing to make them for the principle actors. Even the supporting cast have great costumes and their roles are nicely give some screen time too. I think that in itself, gives more verisimilitude to the film.  (explained by the costume director)
(side note: Knitters I know want to have some of those lovely knit shawls, gloves....must we wait for the patterns?)
Interesting sword and, medical, and herbal information for the time periods.
All in all, I could go on .....It is an incredibly beautiful film and the story is riveting!  Highly recommended.  Not for children and there are
screen warnings.",1461715200,2,2293,4.856410256410256

The only show I've seen Starz do well so far is Black Sails - and it had a lot of similar stylistic issues (and a lot of gratuitous sex and cursing - I have no problem with and even enjoy a good sex scene and a well-placed F-bomb, but it was a bit ridiculous) in the first season, but had some good characters and much better filming. Blerg. Plus, you just know it's all going to end up being a dream or a coma or some other tired s***.",1461283200,,587,4.068965517241379

7356678,1,B00M0GMBMC,"I am not familiar with the Outlander books, but saw so many promotional pieces and interviews, and read so many positive reviews that I was very interested to see it.  I watched the first 2 episodes then many weeks later 2 more, and binge watched 6 on and off in one day.  The filming and location were beautiful, almost dreamlike.  The music mesmerizing and the costumes extremely detailed and intricate.  Definitely, a carefully thought out production to the minutest detail.  The actors peformed exceptionally in the dramatic scenes, conveying the strongest emotions and excitement.  But even with all these attributes, I cannot justify watching it, and will not go any further in the series.  Art is intertwined in life, but there are boundaries when it no longer resembles art, but becomes dark and gratuitous.  When writers and directors graphically depict the most heinous crimes and sexual details, proclaiming it necessary for the story, they are really feeding their desires to be outrageous and contretemps.  They have tremendous talent, but reduce it to rubbish, using profanity, vulgarity, and torture in their scripts, painstakingly convincing themselves that it is art.  I am sorry for them, for the actors, and for the fans who have bought into this deception.  The professed success of a book or tv series, measured by the writers, producers, directors, actors, and fans involved is a biased opinion.  The Outlander tv series had all the elements to be amazing, but added in so much disturbing, irreverent, graphic material, it destroyed itself.  There is more than enough violence and sexual dysfunction in the world, now and throughout history.  Presenting it as artistic form does not change the reality of what it is.  It always must be rejected in reality and fiction, and overcome with virtue and industry, in real life and art.",1461196800,40,1851,5.082781456953643

7356763,4,B00M0GMBMC,I really like the setting of this show. There is a subtle fantasy/sci-fi element that isn't too science fiction nor does it take away from the romance and drama of Claire's story.

Difference between a book and a series is: nothing is left to the imagination. However overall, I enjoy this series. It's nail biting at times. Other times it's predictable (script wise). The cast is superb. Very good acting.",1461024000,,429,4.512820512820513

7356798,2,B00M0GMBMC,"An interesting premise, but from the 5th episode or so on, I was in ""Give it one more shot"" mode for a while, and I finally gave up on the show.  One episode in particular finally killed it for me because the character actions were blatantly motivated by plot needs rather than logical character motives.  One other negative for me (and I never thought I'd complain about this) was the sheer quantity of nudity.  No one likes looking at a beautiful woman more than me, but there is a point where the amount of nudity is so great it just takes you out of the scene.

It started to feel like a crutch for the show that whenever things got slow or something didn't make sense, it would be ""get naked"" time.  That an the overall slowness of the plot.  It plods along at fairly to slow pace.  And maybe it takes a women's perspective to appreciate him, but the male lead, the Scottish guy, his limited acting range really started to show.  He's basically the cover of a Romance novel, and he does a good job of being sexy I guess, but being a well-rounded character, I just wasn't buying it.  But then again, maybe it was the script that was the problem.  His character wasn't particularly well written, and the same could be said for the English officer.  He seemed to exist to solely be evil.  I didn't buy into his character at all.  It all fell plot driven and one-dimensional.

Maybe the show picks up when she magically travels somewhere else, but I frankly got tired of waiting.",1461024000,,1480,4.413284132841328

7356890,5,B00M0GMBMC,"Umm... wow.  I binge watched the entire first season in about 36 hours, and I must say - I'm hooked.  I visited Scotland recently on a family vacation and I love everything about it, so it makes sense that I also love the setting and scenery for this show.  Acting is also great, and the chemistry on set leaps off of the screen.  I've heard others criticize the acting as wooden, but I disagree (for the main characters at least).  I think I'll read the books now too, if I get the time.",1461024000,,488,4.204301075268817

7356895,5,B00M0GMBMC,This series is unbelievable.  The ability to stay so true to the books (few and minimal deviations) and the authors detail in 1 hour episodes is amazing.  You'll become addicted!  :),1461024000,,182,4.806451612903226

Warning...it contains adult subject matter and is graphic.",1461024000,,209,4.526315789473684

8726271,5,B00M0GMBMC,Addictive! I am on season 2 now! If you buy plan to binge watch!! Great acting and superb casting of characters. The male Scottish lead is easy on the eyes! I have not read the books but I bet they were great too! Very romantic but some scenes that are quite disturbing too so be prepared.,1535414400,,289,4.178571428571429
8726272,5,B00M0GMBMC,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this series. Id never heard of the books but was hooked within the first 3 episodes of the TV show. Being impatient, I couldn't wait for Season 4 & decided to purchase the Audible books. Ive now started the final book & will finish it just in time for Season 4 to air. This series has all the good & the bad. It can get a bit raunchy & test your own limits as a viewer, but its well worth accepting that challenge.",1534896000,,429,4.0
8726273,1,B00M0GMBMC,Stupid. Repetitive. Plays on emotional cycle of tormenting someone you love to just take care of them later.,1533686400,,108,5.055555555555555
8726274,3,B00M0GMBMC,"But as with other book-to-film productions, wanders from the story line for film's sake. Lovely cinematography but other than for Claire and Jamie the casting is amusing.",1533600000,,170,5.333333333333333
8726275,5,B00M0GMBMC,I had never heard of this series till two weeks ago. Now I have binged watched all 3 seasons twice! I love the story and the intense love/chemistry between Jaime and Claire. Its is the best show I have seen in a long time!,1533340800,,222,4.068181818181818
8726276,5,B00M0GMBMC,"Good, but I feel uncomfortable watching this at times. I feel like it is a half step up from porn. If I had not read the book and knew the awesome story, I probably would have turned it off after 5 minutes. I'm not a prude, but really... is all of that sex really necessary?",1533254400,,274,4.0

8726278,1,B00M0GMBMC,"Very disappointed in this show. I thought Claire was an intelligent/strong woman at first, but clearly she is not. She falls for an idiot headstrong clansman after going back in time and away from her husband. I don't understand how she searched for Jamie(the clansman) and did not have empathy for the husband she left in 1940's, who is searching for her. I was disappointed when she married Jamie and more disappointed that she did not return home when she had the choice. She is selfish and stupid. What intelligent woman would choose a smelly/dirty ignorant Scottish clansman, who literally beats her for disobedience, over a respectful and intelligent man. LOL I watched the first season and some of the second. I just can't, Claire is a very weak minded woman, as she is literally ruled by her emotions. I realize the series would have been very short had she returned home, but it would have been much better.",1532995200,,916,4.767295597484277
8726279,5,B00M0GMBMC,"This is fantastic and a must have with extras such as deleted scenes, interviews.  The tapestry of characters, plot, history, sex and violence is intricate and always a joy to watch.  The evolving love story is both true to life with its ups and downs and phenonmenal.overall.  I wish I had ten stars to give this Season 1 Collector's Edition.",1532649600,,343,4.683333333333334
