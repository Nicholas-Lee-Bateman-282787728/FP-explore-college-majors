8754362,5,B01CYDKA2S,"A film thick with a pathos of stifled refugee from wild and dangerous forbidden adventures lurking just bejond the gate. These are the lures of the supernatural, primal and unexplainable as manifested in the near coming of age young woman's dream world that the film takes place in, as represented by the forest and mystical wolves that lurk just beyond the path.

The film's narrative is not one of dramatic momentum (although the huntsman related end section scenes are particularly effective) but stylistic episodes of world building and tone, in building a non-specific sense of unease, repression, subversion and unreality - a timelessness and lack of normal causative world infused into the film.

Visually the film has a strong art direction of incorporating together a yound disney type fairytale look, a late night creature mild horror film and a 18th century rural period film. It is also an interesting film in relation to Interview with the Vampire's cinematic world.

There are a few interesting small extras on the disc of the film trailer and a production stills gallery, with a simple but fun spooky type of menu system, along with a Dir's commentary and subtitiles which are good to watch the film with as an option.",1498608000,,1233,4.975728155339806
