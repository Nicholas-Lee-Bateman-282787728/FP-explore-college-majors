8159470,1,B000KWZ23S,"I should have read the reviews before buying this because it is truly worthless. The image quality is incredibly poor - but at least it matches the quality of the music. If there is dialogue, I didn't hear any of it. I wouldn't even donate this to someone. This set is headed straight for the dumpster.",1381017600,,302,4.410714285714286
8159471,2,B000KWZ23S,"Bought this at Costco before going to tour some of the parks. It plays like a cross between EWTN and that euthanasia video from ""Soylent Green"".",1337904000,2,144,4.576923076923077
8159472,1,B000KWZ23S,"It could be a case of high expectations, but I don't think so. This collection is cheaply packed and poorly produced. I've only seen one disc, but I think that's enough on which to base a review. I probably will not see any of the remainder of the set, so one disc is all I have. That one was ""Yellowstone."" disc 1.

The first negative is the hard time getting the disc out of the box from the pile of four discs stacked on top of each other. Then the picture doesn't fill up the entire TV screen. Then there's no voice for maybe five minutes. Just shots of scenery and excruciating music- boring! But when the narration finally starts, it takes less than a minute to yearn for the music, such as it is. Pretentious babble rather than informative info. There's maybe five minutes of informative narration on the whole 60 minute disc.

A few shots of wildlife. No wolves until the last few minutes. No action shots, almost stills. I can't say how many shots there were of hot spring waters bubbling, but there were way more than I wanted. Very uninspired camera work. Maybe it was shot with a cell phone. ;-(

In summary, this is a bad collection. This disc captured none of the awesome beauty of Yellowstone and its ecosystem. It's a good thing I only paid $7.99 for it.

I'm sure other collections (probably any other collection) will do a better job.",1316304000,,1352,4.439516129032258
