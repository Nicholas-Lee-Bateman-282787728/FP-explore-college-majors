3418491,5,B0018PH3IS,"I instruct Intro to Sociology, and Social Research Methods at a college level.  I incorporate the social lives of animals in both of these courses because the standard textbook doesn't include the social world of animals. .  Human beings are social animals too :)  I like Jane Goodall's  research because she is a beautiful women who dedicated her life to the social beingness of animals and what they have to teach us as humans.  That is to be highly honored and admired. Although this film is not the best one of her documentaries  detailing her research, it is still a fun film to watch.  I use other documentaries on Humans studying the social world of animals too, along with human research studies.  How the research is conducted, what methods, and variables and etc....",1385596800,,776,4.7819548872180455
3418492,5,B0018PH3IS,I am sure that there are many Jane Goodall fans in the world as she is truly a fascinating lady with so much compassion for our animal kingdom.  It is a great pity that we haven't got more like her in our world as she makes this world a better place. I cannot write enough about this DVD as it is very educational and everybody who has children (or not) should buy it and learn so much information and knowledge that Jane imparts in this particular DVD presentation....Sophia,1370995200,3,475,4.3977272727272725
3418493,2,B0018PH3IS,"Its not necassarily bad, but its not what i thought at all. I actually think i watched it on animal planet. its like a lot of random different people talking about their experiences with pets and other animal experiences. I was looking for a factual documentary, this is not what i wanted at all. Probably good for kids 10-14 interested in animals.",1359417600,3,348,4.629032258064516
3418494,5,B0018PH3IS,"I was amazed in general on this DVD; also that parrot ; and of course the cancer sniffing dogs, too.",1357603200,,100,4.05
3418495,4,B0018PH3IS,"Goodall wants us to see our own roots in our fellow creatures, accept ourselves as different only by degree.  She would have us honor our ancestry all the way back.  Accept animal emotion and suddenly you have deep roots and an honest, unforced place in the scheme of life.  Conquest and submission are only a petty portion of our inheritance.  Shared care, all the way to love, is our natural path to growth",1356393600,2,408,4.5479452054794525
3418496,5,B0018PH3IS,"This is a wonderful documentary about animal communication. It tells the anecdotes of pet owners and others who have managed to communicate with animals, as well as the amazing abilities of those animals. Even for those of us who already understand that animals can communicate, this film is a powerful reminder of how much we do not know about animals and how much we have yet to learn from them.

One of the most amazing studies was with dogs who had the ability to sense tumors. The dogs accurately identified which tissue sample out of seven had cancer over 95% of the time. The dogs even correctly indicated that a tissue sample from a supposedly healthy patient did have cancer. Since the doctors had cleared that particular patient, the dogs probably saved his life.

Another great scene involved a Grey Parrot who not only talked, but conversed. He seemed to understand what to say to people at certain times and had garnered a vocabulary of over 1,000 words. Upon meeting Jane Goodall, he even asked her if she brought any chimps (and subsequently made chimpanzee grunts).

As with many documentaries of this nature, I found this to be a bit too short and sometimes too much filler (too many dog owners saying how much they love their pets). However, don't let that discourage you - there's still a lot to learn from this documentary.

8270630,3,B0018PH3IS,"Bought this for my 2nd grade granddaughter since she's obsessed with Jane Goodall and since she also loves all animals. SHE was totally into the whole movie (which we all watched as a family), however most of us thought it was a bit redundant (a lot of the same people--some of them very ""crazy looking"" and obviously really into their pets). Was not as scientific as I thought it was going to be, a lot of people talking about their pet - too many ""people minutes"" instead of seeing more footage of the animals in action. Hopefully my granddaughter doesn't ask me to watch it with her again...not sure I could sit through it a second time (but I know she will!)",1390348800,3,662,4.434426229508197
