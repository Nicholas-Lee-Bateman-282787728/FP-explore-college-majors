8596211,5,B00DQ0G1X6,"It's a movie with a simple plot, but it becomes an epic battle between good and evil, with touches of horror and a lot of comedy, as is typical of the films of Alex De La Iglesia, the movie is not boring in any time, I liked it so much that I returned to buy now on Bluray Disc.

Especially recommended if you you liked movies like 800 Bullets, The Day of the Beast and The Last Circus.
