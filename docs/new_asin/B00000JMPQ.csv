7912704,4,B00000JMPQ,"Armand (Franco Nero)is a shopboy, living with his mother in 1940 France. Elianne (Lisa Gastoni)is the unfullfilled wife for whom Armand works in the Pharmacy below the apartment where she lives with her husband and daughter.
The Germans are due to arrive in Paris. One night Armand gropes a woman he believes to be Juliette the shopgirl in the dark at closing. It is not Juliette, it is Elianne. Elianne is incensed but when she tries to tell her husband, he interrupts and tells her about his latest treasured art discovery. Distracted and disgusted with her husband, Elianne decides not to tell him at all.
Armand, aware that he has groped the wrong woman, waits several days for the ax to fall. When he is not fired, he is perplexed: ""Is it possible, does the woman like me?"" In a few days he gropes her again. Voila! It appears she does like him.
From there it is a slide down a slippery slope. Armand takes more liberties with his mistress. Gradually he can't be bothered to boff Juliette any longer. Except on one occasion he forces Elianne into an humiliating sexual triangle with Juliette.
Armand finds new ways to humiliate his mistress. On one occasion, he forces her naked out onto the nighttime sidewalk in front of the Pharmacy. From inside Armand baits her to strut her wares like a prostitute, walking up and down the street like a strumpet. An amiable drunk emerging from the bar across the street spots her. But by the time he has alerted his companions, Elianne has disappeared back inside the pharmacy. Where Armand finds her laughing uproariously and in good spirits. It turns out Elianne loves the erotic dare.
Now, with the German army closing in, Armand must find still other ways to bring down his aristocratic boss. And upstairs, Elianne's life with her distracted husband is imploding. She whispers a midnight confession of her infidelities with Armand to her sleeping husband's back. The Camera cuts to her husband. He is awake. And now he knows. But he does nothing.
Bombs are exploding in the distance and sirens warn of the approach of the Germans. Disaster is imminent for the French, and implicitly, for the family of Elianne and her husband, Professor Henri Michaud, collector of treasured artifacts.
Armand now directs his erotic gaze at Justine the couple's daughter. Elianne is appalled, but with war approaching and her husband distracted, there is little she can do.
The drama continues, the sirens blare, the war comes closer. And the audience waits for the denouement. Its a wonderful tragedy with a soundtrack that crosscuts between sounds of the approaching war and a salacious piece of music that heralds another erotic episode between Armand and Elianne.
Under whatever name; Scandalo, Scandal, Submission, this film is one of the most erotic ever made.",982627200,23,2797,4.878151260504202
7912705,5,B00000JMPQ,"I am adding an addendum. I forgot to mention that this VHS is the true authentic German version featuring Franco Nero and Lisa Gastoni.  According  to Golden VideoHound 2000
 ""A pharmacist's sensuality is reawakened  when she has a  provocative affair with a clerk in her shop."" 107  m/C VHS.
The director is Salvatore Samperi.
Note: Golden VideoHound  rates this movie 1 1/2*.  I have watched many movies.  The review is  incomplete. I disagree.
I must rate Submission as 5*.  The video has  great impact and shows conflicts of raw emotion as a foreseeable dilemma  deepens and most alternative options seem to be zero-minus to the  pharmacist.  A movie can be evaluated in part by its impact on the viewer.  This movie really opened my eyes, mind and heart.
Note to Amazon: The  addendum is added as a result of inquiries about the review from persons  all over.  They asked which version was being reviewed and who were the  featured performers.",965520000,6,948,4.80625
7912706,4,B00000JMPQ,"Submission has a lot of nudity. There are a few pictures of full frontal  nudity although quite different than depicted in erotic acts. The  husband/professor seems to be a cuckhold who forgot that love means more  than a peck at night. The neglected, frustrated pharmacist/physician wife  has driving needs. The professor is oblivous. The errand boy keeps after  his prey--the wife-with the sinister knowledge that touch can drive her to  any lengths. Manipulating this knowhow, the errand boy becomes the  dominator. One has to feel helpless and sad for the wife, almost living her  drives for touch and understanding the agony. The dominator has an endless  bag. Where does the beleagured daughter go, ignored by Mama in her needs  and father in his scholarly endearvors? The daughter's ability to stay the  course makes one marvel and wonder how could she be so strong when the  others ignore in their selfish self-satisfying indulgences or worlds.
The clerk is depicted as the sure thing, wanting, simple, ever-pleasing,  and also highly tolerant.
The dominator/clerk: how dare a person be so  callous? Is he a man or a cuckhold in a way, too? Reality makes us wonder  how many of his type roam the streets, stores and bedrooms preying on and  for more, not even being satisfied after achieving all that is  sought.
This is an older movie  and shows the 1940s. The main character  in her 50ish 40s reveals shows that natural beauty can have no limits or  wrinkles at all ages. Lovers of sadism can enjoy the film. Soap opera  lovers can find the film like an extended afternoon but unlike TV. The film  ends without ""tune in again."" Submission shows there are  endurance limits that do not continue from one episode to another and such  is life too with its climaxes.
Some can abhor. Some can marvel.  Four****seems appropriate. The clerk's greed seems to drag on  but isn't  the pharmacist living a long term need that must be faced by the viewers  too. Some will get highly involved watching this while others hope for the  ""glimpses."" Ego & heartbreak offset.  Mgmtdr",941414400,7,2075,4.845714285714286
