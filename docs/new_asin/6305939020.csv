7897991,5,6305939020,"Gloria Swanson made a few sound films before Tonight or Never was released. This sharp and clean restored print is a fun, lightweight romantic comedy costarring Melvyn Douglas and a funny cameo with Boris Karloff as the butler.  Gloria is an opera singer with a voice like crystal, pure but cold. She puts no feeling into her singing because she claims never to have been in love. Enter the mystery man (Douglas). (Spoiler Alert) Is he merely a gigalo with his patron/""aunt"" (Alison Skipworth) in tow? Will she be heard by the impressario who is touring Europe to find new singers for New York's Metropolitan Opera? The plot of this filmed stage play is fairly predictable, but it's so much fun watching the mistaken identities get sorted out and cold hearts melt.",1399161600,,764,4.787878787878788
7897992,5,6305939020,This entry in the Milestone Collection is a great pre-code feature.  It's great to see Swanson and Dougles together.  Picture quality is very good and it is a nice splice-free print.  No issues.,1356393600,,194,4.818181818181818
7897993,1,6305939020,"No wonder Gloria Swanson never succeeded in talkies. This movie would have wiped out the career of nearly any star--whether or not they could talk, sing or what. I gave up watching this after 45 minutes although I've always been obsessed with Gloria Swanson. You would think that as an opera singer, Gloria would at least have lip-synched some songs. Instead, the movie takes forever to get started. Clad in stunning Chanel gowns and jewels, Swanson looks fantastic. But she spends her time staring, staring, staring at the mysterious gigolo, Melvyn Douglas, who cruises her hotel. One glaring weakness, too, is Gloria's voice. It simply has no vibrancy or personality. Although she looks phenomenal, everytime Gloria opens her mouth, she loses her star charisma. The movie creeps along at a glacial pace. Gloria looks completely uncomfortable talking. I found this movie so depressing to watch--after reading about it for years--that I quickly put in my new DVD of ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" and had a ball!",1084406400,7,1015,5.083832335329341
7897994,3,6305939020,"Nella Vago is a young opera singer who is making her first major appearance at a Venetian opera house.  The critics are less than enchanted, and her teacher remarks that she lacks the passion & fire which makes the difference between a singer and a diva.  Gloria's voice takes on a newly-found timbre after an amourous affair with a handsome ""gigolo"" played by Fredric March...A fairly entertaining early talkie which was originally a stage play starring Melvyn Douglas and his wife, Helen Gahagan. The play was the last to be produced by Broadway legend David Belasco before his death.  Note that Boris Karloff has a slyly engaging comedy part in this antique curio which continued to keep Swanson's fading career in the talkies on the down-side.",1032739200,,747,4.912698412698413
7897995,4,6305939020,"""Tonight or Never"" is one of the ten best movies about opera ever made (There have been at least 10, right?  There is ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""The Great Caruso,"" and they go to an opera in ""Pretty Woman.""  Does that count?). Gloria Swanson plays Nella Vago, a young singer who has a rather disappointing operatic debut in Venice.  Her voice teacher, Rudig (Gerdinand Gottschalk), tell here that her voice lacks warmth and feeling.  Meanwhile, a young man (Melyvn Douglas) is following her around everything.  Nella returns home to Budapest, where she learns that a scout from the Metropolitan Opera has refused to sign her until she can truly feel her songs.  Depressed, she goes to the apartment of the young man and makes love to him.  The next night Nella stuns the audience with her emotional performance in ""Tosca.""  But now she has to choose between a career and the man she loves (apparently having both does not occur to her).

Swanson is pretty good in this early talkie, especially since she is dressed up in stunning gowns by Coco Chanel, which may well be the best part of the movie.  This 1931 film directed by Mervyn LeRoy was based on the play by Lili Hatvany and this would be a much better movie if it seemed less like a play.  Two other interesting tidbits about ""Tonight or Never"": The cameraman was Gregg Toland, the famous cinematographer who worked with Orson Welles on ""Citizen Kane"" and the scene stealing waiter was Boris Karloff, in his first role after ""Frankenstein.""",994896000,8,1498,4.679389312977099
