7884566,5,6305194645,"This WaiLana DVD is definitely one of the best yoga workouts I've had in years. Each of the poses let you test your limits, yet are energizing and calming. I feel great every time I do one of WaiLana's yoga DVDs and would highly recommend them to anyone! WaiLana is a excellent teacher, explaining each of the poses and also the benefits.

The DVD also has a great feature where you can customize your workout, which I love if I don't have enough time to do the whole workout. The music is very nice and the workout always ends with a very relaxing pose. I hope you like it as much as I do!",1178582400,3,590,4.175438596491228
7884567,5,6305194645,"Her 30 min yoga DVDs are always soothing yet energize me. I'm never bored & almost always disapointed it's over after 30 min.
She speaks slowly, gracefully with beautiful outdoor locations to look at. She performs them in colorful outfits & too much makeup, but we can blame the producers for that. She is always correct in knowing where you will feel the energy during & after the pose. She also tells you what the poses help your body with to keep you going if it seems hard. The pace if very slow & relaxed & she lets you take short breaks in between each one.
This one like her others has a play feature, extras contains: tell you seperately in pics what the asana helps with for organs or muscles, extra info on how to do it, customizing the working by deciding which poses to do or do repeatedly, guidelines/helpful hints if tired/weak & temperature of the room, fan speak/testimonials & more items to buy.
The poses are: arrow, bowing cobbler, plank, bridge, sidways leg lifts, reverse awwor, fish, knee to outside of arm, triangle, folding triangle, bulldog, sidebends, camel, lion & ends as always with a 5 min meditation/chant.

You can see pictures & trailers at her site wailana com",1159574400,7,1194,4.632075471698113
7884568,4,6305194645,"This was my first Wai Lana video, and it was not at all what I had expected.  First of all, I had assumed that she taught mostly beginner's yoga, so I was pleasantly surprised to discover that she includes many more challenging asasas.  Secondly, unlike most of my other videos, the practice did not really flow from one pose to the next.  Rather, each asana was its own stand-alone practice, with the pose being held for an extended length of time time and then a period of relaxation following the pose.  What I liked about this style is that it means that each time you do the video, you can do as many or as few poses as you choose.
The active part of the practice is approximately 35 minutes long.  Wai Lana begins with seated and lying poses.  The sequence is as follows (the names of all asanas appear on the screen, but at times, I have substituted the more common name for the pose rather than the one she used):  boat, cobbler's pose, plank, bridge, side leg lift, plow/shoulderstand, fish, and 1-leg happy baby.  Because each pose is held for several minutes, I found many of them to be quite challenging despite the fact that I consider myself to be at an intermediate level.
The next section of the workout consists of standing poses, including triangle, double angle twist (a forward bend variation), wide-legged forward bend, and wind-blown tree.  Wai Lana then returns to the floor for two additional seated postures, camel and lion.  Finally, the practice ends with a 5-minute seated meditation which includes Wai Lana's song-like chanting and beautiful background scenery.
I found Wai Lana's frequent outfit changes, gaudy appearance, and heavy accent a bit difficult to get used to, but she provided excellent instruction and cuing (although she does not give mirrored cues).  She is quite encouraging and offers a good bit of information about the benefits of each pose.  I was definitely impressed with this video, and I plan to try others in the Wai Lana series.",1089158400,,1984,4.752186588921282
7884569,5,6305194645,This video- and I plan to buy all the rest of the Wai Lana tapes!- is the best yoga tape that I have done. It is beautifully filmed-the locations are stunning- and keeps my interest up the whole time.  The soundtrack is  uplifting- and her instructions are very helpful to really get into the poses. It is so refreshing compared to studio set yoga tapes. I cant wait to get more.,1074384000,,379,4.323943661971831
7884570,5,6305194645,"I really enjoyed this video. Wai Lana is such a mellow yoga teacher. Her video made me feel like no other yoga video has. It reinforced the feeling I have that there is more to yoga than just excercise.
Thank you Wai Lana",1071964800,,221,4.162790697674419
