7688410,5,B01CQ33D7U,Excellent Series. I would like to get the other seasons when they become available.,1461369600,2,83,5.0
7688411,5,B01CQ33D7U,"Hack was excellent, but the show seemed retooled, ""cleaned up"" and ""PC'd"" in a glaringly obvious way by the 2nd season. David Morse is marvelous and it made me a big fan of his. The rest of the cast shines, though the son is a very wooden child actor. Mike Olshansky is one of the best characters on television. This first season is full of flawed characters you ultimately want to root for. Everything is painted in shades of grey. It has a beginning, middle, and promising end. It's totally worth watching this as if it were a 1 season mini-series.",1457740800,10,550,4.455445544554456
7688412,5,B01CQ33D7U,"Terrific show. Waited for this to be released on dvd for years.... season 2 much sooner, please.
Only 2 seasons... too bad...",1486684800,,125,4.7272727272727275
7688413,5,B01CQ33D7U,"Season 1 of ""Hack"" was quite superb.  This is an excellent series, with top-drawer performances, and compelling, moral, complex stories.  It still holds up very well, even after fifteen years or so.",1484697600,6,198,5.15625
7688414,5,B01CQ33D7U,Need to get other seasons out of ''tis powerful well acted series out.,1481155200,,70,4.461538461538462
7688415,5,B01CQ33D7U,"This was one of the best series on television in the early 2000s, and it is a crying shame that it was cancelled after only two seasons. I wish Amazon carried the second season so that I could purchase it as well.",1478044800,3,213,4.095238095238095
7688416,5,B01CQ33D7U,Long time coming; one of the most under rated series ever made. A shame that its run lasted only 2 seasons.,1477440000,,107,4.142857142857143
7688417,5,B01CQ33D7U,We enjoy this TV series very much and were delighted when it became available on DVD for Season 1. PLEASE make Season 2 available asap! Good character acting and story lines.,1471132800,,174,4.645161290322581
7688418,5,B01CQ33D7U,"I only hope that CBS releases season 2 also (unfortunately there were only 2 seasons made). David Morse is an ex-cop who
always seems to find adventures while driving his cab, I hope someday that St. Elsewhere (seasons 2 through 6) also get
released, 2 different sides of Morse worth watching.",1469577600,3,293,4.764705882352941
7688419,5,B01CQ33D7U,"Love this series so glad to get S1 on DVD now... Where the heck is the rest of the series???  Seriously, S1 was just the tip the show got so much better & I want it!!!  Give me the rest!!!!!!!",1468800000,,192,3.775
7688420,5,B01CQ33D7U,"I was so happy to see this series get a DVD release!  It is a little pricey since it is a MOD release but glad to have it nonetheless.  I loved watching this show on Saturday nights, as well as ""The District.""  The Season One release of ""Hack"" includes all 22 episodes and features some really great guest stars:  Bebe Neuwirth (The Good Wife),  Matt Czuchry (The Good Wife),  Viola Davis (How to Get Away With Murder), Martha Plimpton (The Real O'Neals), Chad Lowe (Pretty Little Liars), Jennifer Esposito (Blue Bloods, Taxi Brooklyn), John Benjamin Hickey (Big Stone Gap, Pitch Perfect), John Heard (Prison Break), Jason Ritter (Joan of Arcadia), Idris Elba (The Wire), Fisher Stevens (Early Edition), and Gary Cole (Midnight Caller).",1464739200,3,736,4.943089430894309
7688421,5,B01CQ33D7U,"Great series. Finally, a chance to binge watch an entire season. I hope that Season 2 will be released soon.
The cast of regulars was exceptional and they created a certain microcosm of what real life is sometimes like.
Bravo!",1462492800,4,226,4.675
8753688,5,B01CQ33D7U,"David Morse is a very good actor. He brings a quality of caring and thoughtfulness to the show. His character can also be tough and he portrays that very well, without showing any cruelty in his manner. There was a problem with the dvd. There was some pixelating here and there and some episodes were missing.",1532908800,,309,4.535714285714286

8753695,5,B01CQ33D7U,"Hack Season 1 is a real treat to watch on DVD. The transfer is clear, crisp and flawless...and the soundtrack is great. The TV series never seemed as sharp as this version has proven to be. The cast seems perfect for this drama, and their acting is superb. I encourage all fans of Hack to contact Amazon and request Season 2 be made available on demand (MOD) just as Season 1 has been, an Amazon exclusive.",1491609600,9,406,4.355263157894737
