8646872,3,B00IZNMEO4,"Sort of like a Michael Bay movie, in that it starts to be fun once you stop expecting it to make any sense.",1442793600,,107,3.6956521739130435
8646873,5,B00IZNMEO4,"Just like the other adventures of the dragons, this one is sure to please you children as well!
The animation is first rate and the dialog will be entertaining to tots as well!",1425081600,,176,4.363636363636363
8646874,2,B00IZNMEO4,"This movie is aimed at 5 and 6 year olds. The animation, characters, and quick changes in plot and setting are sure to keep their interest. The characters do call each other names - fool, idiot, and imbeciles - to name a few

The dialogue makes one think of bad day time soap operas. Language structure and word choices seem very formal and forced then abruptly very childlike.

The story itself is interesting but a little bizarre. If your little one likes dragons, elves, or aliens, s/he will probably like it.

I would not pay more than $5-$7 for this movie.",1404000000,,561,4.534653465346534
