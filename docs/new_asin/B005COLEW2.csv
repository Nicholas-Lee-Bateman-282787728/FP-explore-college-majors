4653684,1,B005COLEW2,"For lack of a better word, I call this expected release collection a rip-off.
My reasons? aside for the infamous 'double dipping' of 99% of the cartoons (which is legitimate, but greedy), there is the worse case of the remaining single new to DVD theatrical cartoon - ""Porky's Duck Hunt"" from 1937, which was Daff's theatrical debut. Why was this cartoon not released on the 'Golden Collection' or at least on the Daffy 'Super Stars-Frustrated Fowl' set, released not long ago?
This odd behavoir of warner bros. - releasing uncomplete and unchronollogically orderd collections like the late Golden collection (that, on the good side, had only unrealesed before digitally remasterd cartoons), than terminating them for single charachters collections-the super stars series, which apparently won't contain a single of the black & white cartoons, almost no cartoon from before 1948 and releasing some of them with unproffesional cropping, and finally planning a new collection series (the platium collection) which will again contain mainly double dips and will only be on blu-ray - must stop. I call to all looney tunes fans to do like i did and write to warner about this and for the meantime refrain from buying any release that will not contain only unreleased before to DVD cartoons.",1318204800,11,1285,5.123809523809523
4653685,3,B005COLEW2,"There has been no question that the Looney Tunes gang has been one of the most influential and driven cast of characters of all time. From Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig, to Pepe Le Pew and Foghorn Leghorn, there is still so much joy nearly 80 years after Porky Pig came around, that still ignites so much influence and joy in the hearts of classic animation. But 2012 coming up proves to be something very extra special for Daffy Duck. It will be his 75th anniversary since he debuted in Porky's Duck Hunt in 1937. Honestly, he has been the little black duck that could, and delivered in so many great ways. Now a new DVD compilation is coming around to celebrate what has made Daffy Duck so important in the cartoon universe. But is this fully what makes Daffy Duck re-sparkle in a generation so fully focused on Spongebob Squarepants? Well, it is not looney enough.

The Essential Daffy Duck is a 2 disc DVD retrospective of Daffy Duck in his prime cuts in the classic Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes that he is best known for. From his days in famous gems like Porky's Duck Hunt, to his later Warner Brothers' era in the 50's being more associated as Bugs Bunny's sidekick in classic cartoons like A Star Is Bored, amd Ali Baba Bunny. But honestly, the second disc on the set shows Daffy trying his looniest in new generations including latter-day cartoons like Night Of The Living Duck and The Duxorcist from the Daffy Duck's Quackbusters, to The Green Loontern from the 2004-2005 overlooked cartoon series Duck Dodgers which the great Chuck Jones never got to see come around before he died in 2002. Still, there honestly could've been a few more classics from Daffy's day that should've been highlighted that weren't like Drip-Along Daffy, and Beanstalk Bunny where Daffy encounters a beanstalk through beans, and he and Bugs climb up the beanstalk to go after Gold where they encounter a giant Elmer Fudd to just name a few.

All in all, I do wish that there should be more to help Daffy celebrate his 75th anniversary next year. Just like what The Essential Bugs Bunny was last year, it does short-change those who've been die hard looney tunes fans all this time, yet softly re-introduces Daffy to a whole new era of animation fans into South Park and Spongebob Squarepants. The cartoons have mostly been on DVD before as part of the Looney Tunes: Golden Collection series, but more from the looney little black duck isn't really here to tide fans all over. It is truly dispickable like what Daffy had said all this time that almost nothing new is here to help with Daffy's big 75, but still is a bit flat than what I could've hoped for.

The only new to DVD cartoons are Porky's Duck Hunt as I previously mentioned, Duck Dodgers Jr  which was a segment on the Tiny Toons TV series, superior duck, the 2003 short Attack of the Drones, and from the Duck Dodgers TV series, The green loontern. Not recommend unless you don't own the other DVD's from where these cartoons were previously seen.",1312761600,49,1146,4.5245098039215685

4653699,5,B005COLEW2,This is a very good collection of Daffy Duck classics. It even offers more cartoons and bonus features than The Essential Bugs Bunny set.,1382918400,,137,4.75
4653700,5,B005COLEW2,"Ok, this DVD collection has taken a bit of flack for containing much previously released material, and I can understand why.  Nobody likes to pay big bucks for stuff they've already dished out for.  But if you look at this not as a Daffy Duck collection, but rather as a  Duck Dodgers DVD set with plenty of Daffy bonus shorts, it suddenly becomes worth your hard earned dollars. Consider: not only do you get the original classic Duck Dodgers in the 24th & 1/2 Century but also Duck Dodgers in Attack of the Drones (a Star Wars parody), Duck Dodgers Jr. from Tiny Toons and the Green Loontern story from the sadly neglected Duck Dodgers TV series. And if that wasn't enough, they've included Daffy Duck's Thanks-for-Giving special, featuring the hard to find Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24th & 1/2 Century.  If you, like me are a fan of the Fowl of Tomorrow, this set is simply a must have.  So claim this DVD in the name of the Earth already!",1368057600,10,951,4.442528735632184

The first disc contains previously released shorts, and the second disc contains a few unreleased shorts and specials. I have never seen Daffy Duck's Easter Special.

4653704,5,B005COLEW2,"I really like this DVD.  I like the old Warner Bros. cartoons a lot but I don't need to invest in the complete collection.  The problem with this approach is that Daffy Duck isn't represented to the same extant as some of the other main characters.  So, I have two of the ""Collections"" editions plus this one ""Essential"" collection.
I was prepared to be disappointed with the later, 80s vintage cartoons, but instead was pleasantly surprised.  ""The Duxorcist"" is really quite funny and also kind of creepy all at the same time!
I recommend this DVD for those who aren't planning to buy all available Warner Bros. cartoon collections but who don't want to neglect a crucial character like Daffy.",1337817600,7,694,4.758333333333334
4653705,4,B005COLEW2,"Essential Daffy Duck is a good collection of classic Daffy Duck cartoons.  I love Robin Hood Daffy, Deduce, You say, Ali Baba Bunny and Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2 Century.  The second disc contains ""newer"" cartoons, dating from the 1980s; these are not ones I really appreciate.  I would have been happier with more of the classic Warner Brothers cartoons of Daffy, that is why only 4 stars.",1330041600,11,391,4.63768115942029
4653706,3,B005COLEW2,"True as it may be, that the cartoons on this DVD - on disc 1 anyway - can be considered essential watching for any Daffy fan, as others have stated, most of these cartoons can be found on better Warner Bros. cartoon collections, many of which include insightful commentaries.  Daffy's debut cartoon, Porky's Duck Hunt, is probably the most welcome addition here.  The cartoons presented themselves - again on the first disc anyway - are all top notch (though it's surprising that they chose to include My Little Duckaroo over the original, much better Drip-Along Daffy, and there are none of the classic Rabbit Season/Duck Season trilogy present - which should absolutely be considered essential for Daffy fans.)

Disc 2 drags the collection down a bit with some inferior modern works, mildly amusing at best.  Sadly enough, the worst one in my opinion, Superior Duck, or INferior Duck as it should rightfully be called, is the only one directed by one of golden age directors, Chuck Jones, who of course also directed some of the best efforts on the first disc (Duck Amuck, Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2th Century, the Scarlet Pumpernickel, My Little Duckaroo, Deduce You Say, Robin Hood Daffy.)  After Superior Duck, Jones may have picked himself up a bit with Daffy Duck for President, which was in production around the time of death and finished by his unit.  While it's no classic, the animation and voices are pretty decent.  The best of this disc, perhaps, is a fun little sequel to Duck Dodgers (which actually fares significant better than the other sequel to Duck Dodgers on the disc, sadly again, Jones' own creation.)  Then there are Daffy's two horror spoof theatrical shorts from the '80's, the Duxorcist (significant as Warner Bros' first theatrical short in nearly 20 years) and NIght of the Living Duck (""guest-starring"" Mel Torme as Daffy's singing voice, and presented with an ""encore"" by Torme in its closing credits [which I honestly don't recall ever seeing on TV), an episode of the 2003 Duck Dodgers TV series and two television specials - one directed by Chuck Jones, which includes his own sequel to his classic Duck Dodgers short, as well as clips from other Daffy cartoons, the other special, while not directed by Jones, rips off Jones' classic Duck Amuck (my personal all-time favorite cartoon) and features three mediocre shorts created specifically for this special.

In short, while this DVD collection may be a great introduc(k)tion to Daffy for anyone who's not already familiar with the classic cartoons, it will just disappoint long-time fans of the classics.",1325462400,,2594,4.95852534562212

No way to return it once it's been opened and viewed. All the great episodes with Mel Blanc and ensuing hilarity are NOT on this DVD. Waste of money.,1500336000,,356,4.409090909090909

8465725,5,B005COLEW2,"You're in for a lot of treats in The Essential Daffy Duck; disc 1 contains 15 of his all-time greatest shorts, including his debut short from 1937, Porky's Duck Hunt, never on DVD till this, and ain't on any other DVD to this day! Disc 2 has a ton of extras, most of which never on DVD till this, and ain't on any others! You even get his 2 holiday specials from 1980; Daffy Duck's Easter Egg-Citement by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, and Daffy Duck's Thanks-For-Giving Special by Chuck Jones Enterprises (the latter being a high-pitched print via time compression, for unknown reasons); all the new shorts in them would later be seen in theatres as individual shorts. The Thanks-For-Giving special has the uncut, albeit high-pitched, version of Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24th-and-a-half Century, where it originated! Disc 2 also has episodes from Tiny Toons and the Duck Dodgers TV series, and the original uncut versions of The Duxorcist & Night of the Living Duck, before being used in Daffy Duck's Quackbusters in 1988. However, it does have an edited version of Superior Duck for unknown reasons. Like with The Essential Bugs Bunny, Daffy's set is also a wonder to behold, whether or not you have the Golden and Platinum Collections!
