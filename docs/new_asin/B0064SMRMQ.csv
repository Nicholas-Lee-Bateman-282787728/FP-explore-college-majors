8492947,5,B0064SMRMQ,"Though as pointed out by the other reviewers, these are excepts from longer concerts what there is is wonderful.  The see a young, youthful James Levine leaping around the podium energetically conducting and singing along with the performers -- his joy is evident and contagious. Placido Domingo and Sherrill Milnes doing duets -- wow.  Leontyne Price and Marilyn Horne singing together -- what a joy.  The image quality is excellent and sound is very good.  As usual, when Brian Large is the video director --- the image choices, program pacing etc are impeccable.",1498348800,,565,5.043010752688172
8492948,5,B0064SMRMQ,"Another reviewer already listed the contents so no need to rehash. This is a double DVD of some of the greatest singers of their day. I own many opera and concert DVDs. This, along with Marilyn Horne In Recital, are my two favorites. I don't believe singing gets any better. True, the great Leontyne Price is just slightly past her vocal prime here, but that's hardly a criticism in her case. She, and the others, are simply astounding. The picture and sound of these early 80s recordings are very good for the era.

What bothers me are the thieving resellers here at Amazon who attempt to charge unconscionably high prices, hoping you'll believe this DVD is out of print and can only be obtained through them at an astronomical cost. But at least as of today, the Met Opera online shop is still selling it for $30. It's well worth the price. These are concerts to treasure and enjoy forever.",1421971200,4,892,4.575
8492949,5,B0064SMRMQ,"I saw the original Domingo/Milnes concert, and always wished to see it again. But it was the Domingo/Troyanos concert that blew me away. The Price/Horne concert was equally thrilling. I highly recommend this offering to anyone who loves opera or any of these great artists.",1408406400,,273,5.088888888888889
8492950,4,B0064SMRMQ,"Anyone who cares about great singing should buy this before its gone.  The Met rarely reissues anything they produce.  So once its gone, its gone.

The big negative (and why it only gets 4 stars) of this set is that it is only highlights of the 3 separate concerts - no concert is complete.  Even so, it is still over 3 hours long.  What is amazing is that the 3 concerts were given in less than 1 year.

TROYANOS AND DOMINGO
February 28, 1982: Three duets and 1 aria each.
   Mascagni - Cavalleria Rusticana: Tu qui, Santuzza?
   Verdi - Aida: Ah! tu dei vivere!; Ada a me togliesti (Judgement Scene)
   Verdi - Il Trovatore: Ah! s ben mio coll'essere
   Verdi - Don Carlo: O don fatale
   Bellini - Norma: Eccola! Va, mi lascia, ragion non odo; Va, crudele, al Dio spietato

This is the shortest of the highlights, but, thankfully it preserves the great Tatiana Troyanos at the height of her all too short career (she died of cancer a little over 10 years after this concert).  As she only made a handful of complete opera recordings, this is the best way to experience her in performance.  She is in better voice here than in any of those recordings.  Domingo is in great voice as well.  The Concert, while very good, is overshadowed by the two later concerts.

PRICE AND HORNE
March 28, 1982: Three duets and 2 arias each.
   Handel - Rinaldo: Fermati, non crudel
   Verdi - I Vespri Siciliani: Overture
   Rossini - L'Assedio di Corinto: Non temer, d'un basso affetto; Sei tu che stendi, O Dio
   Verdi - La Forza del Destino: Pace, pace, mio dio
   Verdi - Aida: Silenzio! Ada verso noi s'avanza
Encores:
   Meyerbeer - Les Huguenots: Non, non, non... vous n'avez jamais, je gage
   Puccini - La Rondine: Chi il bel sogno di Doretta
   Puccini - Madama Butterfly: Il cannone del porto! (Flower duet)

This is two legends simply showing off their voices and having a great time doing it.  Horne's ""Non temer"" is astounding.  Then Price sings a gorgeous ""Pace, Pace"" and holds the last note till the final chord.  The Aida duet is great.  Horne's Amneris is lighter and much more conniving than any other mezzo I can remember.  Price floats the ""Numi, pieta"" gloriously.  The encores are incredible.  This is truly one of the legendary nights of singing.

DOMINGO AND MILNES
January 30, 1983: Four duets and 2 arias each.
   Ponchielli - La Gioconda: Enzo Grimaldo, principe di Santi Fior
   Thomas - Hamlet: Brindisi
   Giordano - Andrea Chenier: Improviso
   Puccini - Manon Lescaut: Intermezzo
   Verdi - La Forza del Destino: La vita  inferno all'infelice; O tu che in seno agli angeli
   Verdi - La Forza del Destino: Solenne in quest'ora
   Verdi - La Forza del Destino: Urna Fatale
   Verdi - La Forza del Destino: Overture
   Verdi - La Forza del Destino: Invano Alvaro
Encore:
   Verdi - Otello: S, pel ciel marmoreo giuro!

Domingo and Milnes recorded and performed together constantly.  They are so used to each other they play off of each other constantly.  They can't seem to help themselves from physically acting their roles as they sing.  The result is wonderful.  This is the most theatric of the concerts.  And its incredibly well sung.

Buy it!",1358121600,7,3167,4.63302752293578
8492951,3,B0064SMRMQ,"this is a great dvd and rekindled a slew of memories.  Ms Troyanos is great and Price, as always, is splendid.,  My only criticism, and this is the reason for only three stars, is that the disc is highlights and that is a fact that wasn't readily apparent ordering....the image in-line was so small and the fact that it says ""highlights"" was too easily lost.  Amazon or its sellers should have to note this kind of thing in plain sight.",1352937600,4,436,4.425
8492952,4,B0064SMRMQ,"This DVD is part of a much larger (and much more expensive) set devoted to James Levine's 40-year legacy at the Met.  The set consists of (I believe) older telecasts newly released on DVD, and it's great that the Met is making the DVDs available individually.  I purchased this particular DVD mainly for the memorable Leontyne Price/Marilyn Horne concert from 1982, which I watched 'live' at the time (and regrettably didn't record on my VCR).  (The audio portion of this concert was once available on CD from RCA and has been reissued (sans a couple of overtures) in a new box set of opera arias with Price.)  There's a big caveat with this DVD, however: prospective buyers should realize that the whole Price/Horne concert is NOT included here.  There are several items missing, namely duets from 'Cosi fan tutte' and 'Norma', a Handel aria with Horne, a Mozart aria with Price, and the 'Norma' overture.  This is all very unfortunate, and I hope someday that the Met (or another label) will make the complete concert available on DVD.  In the meantime, however, I'm grateful for what we do have (duets from 'Rinaldo', 'Aida', and 'Madama Butterfly', arias from 'Les Huguenots', 'L'Assedio di Corinto', 'La Forza del Destino', and 'La Rondine', and the overture to 'I Vespri Siciliani').

I can't speak for the other 2 concerts included here, but I'll have to presume that they're incomplete as well.",1334102400,11,1402,4.886075949367089
