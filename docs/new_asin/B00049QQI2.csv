2156250,4,B00049QQI2,"In this 20 minute video, instructor Sara Ivanhoe leads a challenging yoga practice aimed at strengthening your core abdominal muscles. She begins with standing side bends, adding a twist with a knee lift. Next comes some additional seated stretches with forward bends, twists, and spine rolls. Sara then moves to an all-fours position and leads some particularly challenging work moving from down dog to plank pose with one leg pulled in towards your chest. This is followed by some additional seated twists, including a twisting boat pose. Lying on your back, you'll then perform Pilates-like abs moves such as criss-cross, bicycle, and stretches with both bent and straight legs. You'll also perform a half sit up with the legs both bent and stright as well as side knee drops with the legs both bent and straight.

Although the box for this video says that it is ""designed for all abilities,"" this is a tough, challening practice which is likely to feel overwhelming for beginners. The practice is best suited to those with some level of prior yoga experience as well as some pre-existing core strength. Overall, if you like Sara, have done yoga before, and want to focus more on your core, you are likely to enjoy this video.",1114560000,2,1229,4.880382775119617
2156251,5,B00049QQI2,"Sara Ivanhoe's 20 minute makeovers are not only challenging, they are all highly creative. The Flat Abs Makeover includes:

Intro
Core Warm Up
Core Work
Deep Core Work
Upper Abs Work
Letting Go - a stress release mudra

Special Features:

Health & Diet Tips
Workout to Music without Narration

The exercises are definitely intermediate because Sara has modified the yoga exercises to be more challenging. While standing and twisting, you are also lifting your knee. If you have excellent balance or experience doing many yoga exercises, this won't seem that difficult and you will enjoy the new variation.

If you have yet to try ""plank"" where you are holding your body weight up in an ""at the top"" of a pushup style position, then you can imagine how difficult it would be to also pull a knee in to your chest or imagine lifting your leg up into the air behind you. The arm strength needed for these exercises goes beyond beginner, although you could work your way into the exercises over time. I loved the boat pose with a twist and the variations to exercises I had already learned from yoga practice.

The exercises in this workout will encourage a flatter, trimmer tummy and improved posture. Due to the fast pace of this workout, you may want to warm up first with some walking. I like the Leslie Sansone Power Mile - also only 20 minutes. So, in 40 minutes you can be on your way to achieving your fitness goals. I adore all the Sara Ivanhoe workouts because she has a comforting teaching style and her creativity is especially impressive.

If you enjoy her teaching style, you may also want to look for Crunch Candlelight Yoga. It is my absolute favorite yoga workout with candles. A must-have if you need to relax before bed and want to fall into a dreamy sleep.

2156252,5,B00049QQI2,"I agree with the other reviewer that some prior yoga experience will help you move through this workout smoothly the first time, but I think even a beginner could probably pick it up after watching it a few times.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and was surprised to find myself struggling in a few of the moves (I've been practicing yoga via DVDs for a while now, and have also started Windsor Pilates).  I definitely felt the soreness in my abs the next day!  I'd recommend this DVD.",1104105600,14,479,4.482758620689655

8036098,3,B00049QQI2,"I fell in love with Sara's upbeat style, her tips for newbies and safe yoga routines in  Natural Journey's 'Yoga Makeover Buns.' I also like her in Yoga for Dummies and Beyond Basic Yoga for Dummies. I bought this DVD based on my experience with her as an instructor and also these reviews. I get the impression this is the last one filmed of the 5 (or is it 6?) DVDs in the Yoga Makeover series. She must be exhausted as she seems just going through the motions ...listless, disconnected. The workout I give a 'C'. I don't get her typical useful tips, which make the workout safe for the beginner and advanced beginner. Therefore, I think this is safest for the intermediate yogini. Mostly, its a bummer she missed some really good yoga poses for abs, and instead we get her 'yogic bike' and 'namaste sit-up'...lol...moves she co-opted which aren't really yoga at all. I'd get Yoga Zone's abs workouts, for a better, more well-instructed, abs workouts.",1388448000,,953,4.6726190476190474
8036099,5,B00049QQI2,I had never done yoga and decided to try it after talking with a friend who loves it.  I bought a couple of Sara's videos and I love them!,1365292800,,138,3.7586206896551726

8036101,5,B00049QQI2,"This yoga practice is fairly easy and flows nicely from one pose to another. I use it as a cool down after more intense workouts or by itself when I'm feeling stressed. I honestly don't think it's very effective at getting your abs in shape, but it does provide excellent stretching after a more strenuous abdominal workout. (I like the abs workouts in Tamilee Webb's I Want That Body dvd). The reason I gave this dvd five stars is because the practice is very relaxing, yet invigorating! Sara Ivanhoe ends the routine with a mudra, or yoga hand gesture, to ""seal in the practice."" I was suprised at how good I feel by the time we get to the mudra, and I love the way I feel when I'm done. Unlike so many other workout dvds I've purchased, this one doesn't just collect dust. I use it over and over.",1232496000,2,799,4.333333333333333
8036102,4,B00049QQI2,"I really like sara Ivanhoe so I bought this after I'd been doing
her hips and thighs video. This one is alright but I get the
same exersizes on my pilates dvd I wanted more yoga moves. It's
still a good workout but I like her others better.",1187654400,,240,4.020833333333333
8036103,5,B00049QQI2,"Its a good video becuase its has easy parts, and more challanging parts! So it great for the beginers and the more advanced! I DONT agree with the review that said it was for only for beginers!! I'm not a beginer! And there were some parts that were challanging for me!! Shes not cheesy and got a great bod! I plan to get all of her DVD'S",1174521600,,338,4.059701492537314
8036104,4,B00049QQI2,"I like this DVD. It starts with a stretch in obliques and works your upper and lower abs. Alls the moves are yoga moves and the breathing is accordingly. Sara keeps reminding you to inhale and exhale at the right time.

There are a couple challenging moves.

However, the DVD is exactly 18 min excluding her two min talk.

I expected a bit more of workout than talk.

Overall, worth for the $10.00 if you follow it regularly.",1141257600,,425,4.410256410256411
8036105,5,B00049QQI2,"This is a great workout for the abs in 20 minutes. This is a challenging routine that is not for the very beginner. Using this video everyday will give you a tighter stomach. There are a couple poses that are shown in full strength that are very challenging for the intermediate practitioners, that rely on major arm strength. This is a great video for people who want to work out but don't have much time. Also see sara ivanhoes other 20 minute videos.",1138752000,2,453,4.469879518072289

She does an excellent job explaining poses and reminds you of your breathing! Because it is such a well-rounded, quick program, I know I can get through it even before I start. This is what keeps me popping in the dvd each morning and evening. The yoga poses are manageable for even the very beginner! I only wish I lived in Santa Monica where she teaches classes...good thing I have the tapes! :-)",1127779200,4,553,4.326923076923077
