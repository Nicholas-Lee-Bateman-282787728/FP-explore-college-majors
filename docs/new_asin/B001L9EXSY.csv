3682154,5,B001L9EXSY,"I have not been the biggest fan of Dane's as he has become poisonous to rental/sales revenue lately, but after watching this comedy I have a different appreciation of his talents. I have read and heard how offensive this film is to some people but I would venture to say no one will be trying this film (now) that does not already know - if you get offended by chauvinism and egocentric male pigs in film, just skip this altogether. This is not a first date film, or a tenth date film, this is a Boston guys film all the way.

The BD contains both the rated full screen 101 minute version (yeck) and the unrated wide screen 113 minute cut. I watched the extended cut and was very impressed with the quality. Lionsgate went all out on preserving a plethora of beautiful Boston exteriors and landscapes in hidef. Both the day and night wide shots looked extremely detailed and rich. The 7.1 was not used too extensively but when Johnny Cash's ""Man Comes Around"" song overtakes the channels (wedding scene) I was sold on this one. Admittedly, 2 Live Crew's overamped song in the car tested the higher channels, but with over 30 different songs listed, your system's speakers will get a decent workout.

The featurettes total around 30 minutes and give some nice insight on Boston filming and production; 3 of the docus are short and forgettable on dating, chauvinism and prom stuff though. The deleted scenes could have been left in and would have made the film 2 hours long, but still laughable. I could not access the MoLog and associated features but they sound fascinating, including being able to import graphics and text into the film, along with the usual BDLive fun.

I gave this a higher rating because of the whole BD package: great preservation, good sound, awesome soundtrack (especially with Cash and the Cars), funny/informative commentaries, and for making an obviously crude, yet laughable film. Be aware that you cannot play the menus in a mixed crowd either (offensive language and text on screen), and that would be the main shortcoming of the BD are the unfriendly menu navigation screens and no ""play all"" options in any of the screens. In other words, for the amount of extras and menus, you would think they would make them easier to navigate and use.",1231545600,4,2271,4.701005025125628
3682155,2,B001L9EXSY,"Unfortunately, we barely made it thru this whole movie. I personally liked Good Luck Chuck, as I have no issues with nasty humor and it usually totally entertains me.  I watched My Best Friend's Girl with my boyfriend, who loves funny movies -- he most recently favorite is step-brothers. I myself like romantic comedies and really like listening to Dane Cook's stand up stuff, so I thought it would be a great choice for both of us. We both watch a lot of movies and we're not above loving fun ""bad"" movies.

I really like Kate Hudson & Dane Cook, I can deal with Jason Biggs. But this movie was just..boring and not funny!! My boyfriend looked even more bored then I did. I found myself going for the fastforward button and he would look at me with a sigh of relief.

Dane Cook was over-done and trying to push boundaries but in the end just looked stupid. Jason Bigg's character was pathetic and I felt so bad for him that when awful things happened, it wasn't amusing. Kate Hudson was fine -- but she was just her typical character to be honest. Very similar to her other romantic comedies, she's the ""awesome hot girl"". The only thing I really enjoyed about it was that it was filmed and set in Boston, so it was fun recognizing where they were being we live here.

It was predictable and not in a good way. I won't tell you how in case you're still looking forward to seeing this movie. The characters seemed to get in long drawn out talks and you knew where they were going so we skipped over a couple of conversations between Dane Cook and Alec Baldwin. We'd give it a chance to see if it'd be funny, but it wasn't -- so here comes the fast forwarding.

In all, I don't think this movie not being good can be blamed on the cast. Cook and Hudson definitely had chemistry and did the best with what they were given. It was well cast and the directing was fine and it made Boston look gorgeous. It was most likely the writing and story -- can someone please come up with something thats original and NOT predictable?? I would really appreciate it. =)

UPDATE: the special features were good. I really liked the one about filming in Boston and how Dane Cook was a real asset being he grew up in the area. There was also a cute one about the cast and crew's dating tips as well as one about proms and the prom scene of the movie. Sadly, there was no gag reel, which is something I really look forward to in the special features section of DVDs.",1231113600,2,2447,4.308695652173913
3682156,4,B001L9EXSY,"If you like any members of the cast, or just like a good comedy, this movie delivers.  It's not perfect, but it's not trying to be.  For my money, it made me laugh quite a bit, and that's all one should ask for in a comedy.  It's not for kids, mind the R rating, which it earns through moments of strong sexual content and tons of swearing.  The soundtrack is really very good too - including the title song which will get stuck in your head for days after!",1228262400,3,457,4.101123595505618
3682157,3,B001L9EXSY,"Good guy, Dustin (Jason Biggs) can't get the girl. Lucky for him his ""cousin"" Tank (Dane Cook) is a professional bad boy that specializes in being the worst date ever. The plan is for Tank to take Alex (Kate Hudson) on a nightmare date that opens her eyes to what she could have with a good guy like Dustin. Needless to say it all backfires, Alex and Tank find romance. The catch is will Tank's past catch up with him and blow this relationship apart?
The actors have good chemistry and it was paced well.  Personally, I don't like the premise of the movie but that's not something I'd give it a lower rating for. I did lower the rating because although the movie is cute there was only one laugh out loud moment for me, so my end review is it's a good movie to rent but not one I'll add to my collection.",1228003200,,805,4.193548387096774

We are suppose to find Dane Cook's behavior at his girlfriends sister's wedding funny because he is doing it for a good reason, because he loves her and he is doing it for her own good.

I picked it because Kate Hudson is a great comic actress, and a dream to look at for 1.5 hours. I was sucked in by Dane Cook's outrageous character. (Don't watch it with your children or parents.) In the end, I was actually fully invested in the romance.

It has the usual structure of a romantic comedy, but not the usual asinine-ness. Almost no use of montage. (Serious props!) And ALL the main characters are dynamic, not just the male lead.

Also, it's not actually offensive. Yes, there is some strong language and lewd humor, but when I read the other reviews I was expecting race jokes or something.",1378425600,2,651,4.692982456140351
3682303,3,B001L9EXSY,"Crude humor can be funny, but it works best as a surprise. In My Best Friend's Girl there is no surprise since the raunch starts as soon as the movie begins. With one shot gone it could still be a good movie if there was real character development or real wit, but there is precious little of either. What's left is OK, but for me the best moment was about halfway through the movie when Tank (Dane Cook) decides that he's been too hard on Hilary (Riki Lindhome) and spends the next few hours being honest with her. Unfortunately this goes essentially nowhere, and the rest of the movie is both hard to believe and hard to take. What's left is neither romantic nor comedic. It's not completely awful, but with better story development they could have done a lot better.",1377993600,,769,4.460992907801418

I have watched this movie several times now and there are certain scenes that make me literally laugh out loud every single time. Yes the humor is definitely raunchy. Not quite as over the top as The Hangover or Bridesmaids - but sort of along those same lines. (I can see how some would be offended.)

I can't imagine how they cleaned it up for basic cable because this movie is so crude, filled with obscenity and laced with ugly sex jokes (the male lead actually goes pants down in front of the face of his prospective mother-in-law). The F-word appears multiple times in just about every sentence and the c-word crops up gratuitously every few minutes. The plot premise is clever, but the development is so over the top that it is absurd. There is nothing that motivates the major romance, either.

The only reason I watched this to the end was to see if it ever pulled back from drilling down to the lowest common denominator. I can't believe Kate Hudson trashed herself for this pointless flick. I wish I hadn't and you shouldn't.",1356480000,3,827,4.550335570469799

It is rated ""R"" and there is no pretense that anything delicate or sensitive is in the offing. That said, this is an exellent comedy for those who love bold, brassy love stories. Re-watch ""Gone With the Wind""... see any green flags around Rhett or Scarletts relationship styles? I hope not-the dishonesty in alot of classic romances is a turnoff to anyone actually dating... the genuine male-female dynamic is one of tension and testing. George Cloonys' characters often exel at this type of banter. If you liked ""Wedding Crashers"" you might like MBFG... if you loved ""Old School"" then put this on your queue now. --Warning-spoilers ahead- The movie ""Someone Like You"" is actually a girly version of the same premise, that a strong, funny woman looks for a bad boy for thrills and a nice guy for stability... but doubts that she will ever find the whole package- so our hero is really a sex buddy- and then realizes that he's a player getting played...(I guess ""Boomerang"" and ""Whipped"" were like this, too.) The fact is, all the girls I know love to be teased...hard. The main caveats are: 1-tease as a sign of abundance, not anger. 2-tease her in proportion to her confidence. No withering zingers on shy people. Vince Vaughn and Dane Cook do it right!

Dane Cook is a turbo-charged laugh machine! Kate Hudson is every bit as beautiful as her mom, Jennifer Hudson. I know this didn't do very well in the theatres, but home viewers are in for a treat. I truly believe the critics were two hard on this film. You know what they say about critics though, right?

I once heard someone say if you had a roomful of monkeys chained to typewriters for all of infinity they would eventually type the entire works of Shakespeare. Which I say is a bunch of baloney. Where are you going to find a room full of monkeys and more importantly who is going to feed them? Not to mention that room would stink something awful.

I realized the movie was trash within the first 5 minutes but I kept watching thinking that it could not get any worse - wow, I was wrong.  When he met his father (played by Alec Baldwin) I was honestly surprised that people took the time to write this crap into a movie.  The level of crudeness was amazing - as I write this review, the movie is actually playing in the background, as soon as I finish this review I will press stop - actually I'm going to press stop now and eject the DVD, standby..... done.

The wedding is what did it for me and made me go straight to a review so I could give it the lowest rating possible.  The scene with him talking to the children at the table almost made me throw up.  The guy is a comedian but I have laughed at maybe 2 or 3 things in this movie.

3682356,3,B001L9EXSY,"`My Best Friends Girl' is an average comedy where a guy called Tank earns his money by going out with girls on dates and by giving them such a bad time they go running back to their ex boyfriends. Unfortunately, he does this for his best friend (Dustin) so he can win the girl (Alexis) of his dreams and ends up falling in love with her instead. This has some genuinely funny moments amidst some of the more cruder jokes and the bit where Tank dances at a prom is especially good. Alexis' roommate Ami is quite humorous as well and comes out with some funny lines. Alec Baldwin plays Tanks father and is an ageing lothario who taught Tank all he knew about women and although he is crass as hell, he also has some funny lines which will raise a chuckle. This has a good soundtrack with some standout songs by Teddy Thompson and Johnny Cash. This isn't the best comedy you will ever see and some of the more cruder jokes may make you cringe, but all in all it is a fairly innocuous way to spend an evening and will raise a laugh here and there. It is good, but not great.

3682360,4,B001L9EXSY,"My Best Friend's Girl is a pretty hilarious film.  It's about an EXTREMELY obnoxious guy (played by Dane Cook's character) who does and says the worst things imaginable to every woman he goes out on a date with.

Well, on one date he gets more than he ever expected (Kate Hudson's character).

Now the storyline is a bit tricky to understand but let me explain it.

Dane Cook's character has a friend, and this friend actually wants to be with Kate Hudson, but Kate apparently wants nothing to do with him as far as a serious relationship is concerned.

So Dane and his friend come up with this brainstorm idea- in order for Kate's character to truly fall in love with Dane's friend, Dane Cook must go out on a date with Kate Hudson and act like his typically obnoxious jerk self.  The logic here is that Kate will find out how lucky she is to be with a sweet gentlemen (Dane's friend) and fall in love with him.

What happens though, is a big surprise to Dane.  The storyline then develops from here.

I really liked the majority of the jokes.  Dane Cook's character takes his obnoxiousness to a whole new level near the end of the storyline.  Let's just say, talk about a complete wedding disaster!

This is somewhat of a fresh take on the romantic comedy genre, but because of so many extremely vulgar lines, I can't really recommend this film to anyone other than men.",1276041600,,1372,4.465863453815261

Its not that I have anything against him, its just that everytime I see him, all I see is Jim Levenstein, or the 'Pie f*****' from American Pie. He really is not that good an actor. Dane Cook, on the other hand, is hillarious! If you are a Dane Cook fan, then there is no reason why you shouldn't buy this move. if you however do not like Dane Cook, then this movie doesn't have a lot to offer you, as it is Dane who provides all the genuine laughs. Wasn't a great deal of chemistry between him and Kate Hudson, either accidentally or on purpose, she seemed a bit out of place in this movie. A couple of funny moments are lent by co stars Lizzy Caplan, and probably the biggest laugh of the movie from Alec Baldwin, in a scene with him and Dane Cook.

And Tank is good at his job-until he actually falls for his cousin's ex.(Kate Hudson).Among all this debauchery there is actually a love story-but this isn't really a 'date movie'.Unless your boyfriend or girlfriend has a good sense of humor and isn't easily offended.

MILD SPOILERS WARNING

The only thing I didn't like was how it ended.  I just don't buy that anyone would do all the stuff Dane's character did at the wedding.  It doesn't spoil the movie, however.",1257120000,,445,4.365853658536586
3682377,2,B001L9EXSY,"But I actually did laugh out loud several times. Dane Cook was only a name to this over-50 viewer; I have not seen (and won't seek, I don't think) his other starring vehicles. Kate Hudson seemed fairly blah to me, though based on what I cannot say; this certainly did not alter that perception. And as maybe the only adult who has not endured any of the American Pie franchise, Jason Biggs was also new to me.....so, no preconceptions, no expectations.

Well, I think you can get an accurate perception from the many reviews here. If you enjoy people saying outlandish things, especially to old women and kids, using profane language, and generally behaving as offensive and selfish jerks (the opposite kind of heartless jerk as The Wedding Crashers--over the top sludge instead of over the top loveydovey) then this is your kind of movie. If you expect something other than endless fish-very-out-of-water foul language, then, with a couple of surprising glimmers of humor, you will be bored. Not offended.... while Hollywood likes to ""push the envelope"" by trying to offend, the result of bad boys saying bad words is just ""bleeh"". In fact, the supposedly Christian-offending pizza place was, by far, the most clever thing in the whole film, though, yet again, Hollywood's understanding of Christianity is as comprehensive and accurate as it would be if they wrote their scripts after glancing at an excerpt from a magazine article paraphrasing an anthropological text that mentions some remote and unvisited tribe called ""Christians"".

And since I have been married for a long time I sure don't know, but if this is how the single/dating world lives, I am most grateful to be far removed from it. What a universe of coarse brutality (Alec Baldwin, yeech!) and callow hollowness.",1255046400,,1780,4.969798657718121

But if ignored as a leading man and put in the context of a genuine and nice guy, Biggs fits the bill. I loved Kate Hudson's expressiveness; Dane Cook has all the good lines but, in the final analysis, he is just a talking head.

Laugh-out-loud moments: Biggs in the hairdresser's chair
Biggs on a bllnd date date with a woman who just had a baby. ""I'll have what he's having,"" he tells the new mom. The mom's reaction and her friend's reaction is rolling on the floor funny.

And there are other scenes as funny.

But let me get back to Biggs. As usual, he's miscast. He should be the nerd, the best friend, the eternally put-upon guy.

I was especially disappointed in Kate Hudson, who seemed to play a great role in Fool's Gold. Her acting in this movie, however, left a lot to be desired.

Besides bad acting, the movie was obscene in all the worst ways and not even funny. I suppose it could have been a decent movie if the acting was better and they added some comedy to it.

I have an average tolerance for lewdness as I can stand to watch Sex and the City but this is probably on the level of a real bloke's lewdness.  The vulgar language was also something to be grasped.  May be all of that was part of the supposed charm of the movie but I was not convinced - all the comedic drama I can manage but the vulgarity of it all made me think - was that reaaaally necessary to the story?  Not really.  I had to 'chunk' the movie into manageable bits and watch a little bit at a time - as that was all I can manage - but I did survive the movie to finish it (unlike Good Luck Chuck...Bleh!!!)  If you can manage to sift through all the vulgarity, there is a sweet story behind it all.  Dane Cook plays a professional jerk who helps blokes get their girls back but ends up falling in love with one of'em.  He also tries to do the right thing which was also a sweet touch.  Kate Hudson is a force to be reckoned with as she is beautiful.  But I think the terrible-ness of everything else kills the sweet story line.  I must warn the ladies - this is NOT your conventional sweet romantic comedy.

I haven't seen much of him but he truly is the heart and the soul of the film if I'm being honest. Just like his character's relevance there is something about his on screen presence and attitude that will keep you intrigued.

I'm not the biggest Kate Hudson fan and despite her choosing many mindless films in the recent past, I must admit I liked her quite a bit in the film. This is You, Me and Dupree minus the apologetic, cheesy, wind blown humor. I must admit she's sexy in her own way, not that mentioning that will add poignancy for all readers.

Jason Biggs. He's come of age. His character's way of dealing with woman and the inherent shyness and direct head-to-mouth dialogues reminded me of myself. Not for one second did I feel he's overacting.

I know this is not an action film but I couldn't help but notice just how well all accidents happen in the film. How J.B falls, the slapping looks so real and the sound is just perfect. There were about two/three songs in the film that I truly liked. Namely, Separate Ways by Teddy Thompson and Best friend's Girl by The Cars.

Anybody who enjoyed 2005's Waiting will enjoy this film. If you're looking to give a comedy film a try, you might as well rent this dvd. IMDB has a criminally low rating for this film but imdb, just sometimes, a little more especially with comedies, is never quite right.

Alec Baldwin - Well it's good to have him play a short role in the film but I wasn't impressed at all.

3682389,4,B001L9EXSY,"Whoa ho ho!  Freakin raunchy, hilarious, offensive--just a great adult comedy.  This was my favorite laugh-riot since SUPERBAD.

Most of Dane Cook's movie's have been pretty abysmal.  He comes through this time as the chauvanistic ""closet romantic"".
He stars as Tank Turner, the dude that will go out with your ex-girlfriend and be a complete total prick.  Theoretically make her realize how great she had it with her former partner.  When he tries this technique with his best friend's girl, it backfires.  He falls for her pretty hard (pun intended).

Can't blame him when it's the hottie hot hot Kate Hudson.  Tank has met his match, and this story is a prime example of how nice guys finish last.

With all the derogatory insults and degrading acts toward women, this film won't appeal to many people.  This does have a heartfelt message though.  Plus it deals with friendship, betrayal, forgiveness, understanding--yes, it momentarily wavers torward chick flick material a tad, but not too much.

It has plenty of profanity, some nudity, and plenty of great one-liners.
Like this...""oh, she's a 2-bagger, you need a bag over her head, and yours in case one falls off"".  heh-heh, classic!
Plenty of other crazy insults, definitely not a flick to watch with your kids.

Now that being said the title and trailers are certainly billing this as a romantic comedy for everyone and it simply isn't. I picked this up at blockbuster with my friends and a few girls we knew and got to watch as a room full of people was gradually divided between the men, who progressively reverted to our college roots laughing at every cruel and immature slight, and the women, who thought the movie was tasteless (some of which even pleaded for it to be turned off). I couldn't even begin to imagine watching it with kids because of the language alone. Still if the nights plan is to watch a funny movie with some friends and hang out, or if you need something to thrown on before heading out one night this will certainly not disappoint.

Ultimately I would suggest you rent it or get it on Pay Per View instead of buying it, it's just the kind of movie that you need to be able to defuse any blame for its presence and owning it won't help the market value of your DVD collection any.",1239753600,,1284,4.368200836820083

To those here who walk out on movies in the middle, fast-forward through them, or in the case of one woman, HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN IT YET, I don't see how you can offer unbiased reviews.

To me, it's the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. With a fresh, clever premise and all the jokes that will easily flow from that premise.  Cook's best movie by far.

If you think the first two American Pie movies are funny, you'll love this one, too.  If you think you are too ""evolved,"" this one ain't for you.  But it IS incredibly funny, not just because F-bombs are thrown around as on Def Comedy Jam (where there's no humor in curse words alone), but in this movie, it's within clever dialogue.

You MUST get the UNRATED version; it is FAR funnier than the R-rated version. I've viewed both from beginning to end and compared them scene-for-scene where the differences occur, and there are LOTS of differences.  There is NO comparison between the two versions, the Unrated version is far, far funnier.

Dane Cook and Kate Hudson have some surprising chemistry (probably because it must have been a blast to play the bad-boy/bad-girl characters) and the comedy flows pretty naturally.

I can't believe that someone actually wasted part of his/her life to write this film, and that people actually wanted to act in it. I certainly wasted 2 hours of my life watching it. I don't know why I just didn't turn the film off. But, I kept telling myself that surely it has to get better. Unfortunately, no. I gave it a '1' only because the site wouldn't let me put nothing.

3682432,4,B001L9EXSY,"Kate Hudson is certainly the highlight of this movie, along with the actress who plays her roomate. Dane Cook does a great job as ""Tank"" and you have ""biggs"" doing his typical character that you've seen in every film he's ever been in. The scary part of this romantic-comedy is how true to life it actually is and the fact a lot of guys who have horrible horrible luck with women for being these wonderful, respectful, nice guys that a woman would bring home to meet her parents can actually figure out from this movie why they have that kind of luck with women.

Why do women always go for the jerk guys who don't give a crap about them and chase them and can't stand the nice guys. Yet women ""say"" they ""really"" want a nice, sweet, romantic, respectful guy. When they actually get one they lose interest faster than a Nascar Lap lol.

That blend of cocky, funny and confident, jerk guy that women can't seem to get enough of. We've all known a guy like ""Tank"" and that's why the movie works so well. You gotta love the ""mr right, but not right now"" thing lol. The unrated version has a ton of stuff that wasn't in the theatrical release and some real ""gems"" in the deleted scenes, which probably should have stayed in like the extended ending.  Kate Hudson is believable as Alexis and as a guy you can see why Tank totally falls for her.

Alexis and her room mate are the highlight of this movie. I rented it and then bought it and don't regret it at all. Tank and Alexis's first date and her sisters wedding are the best part's of the whole movie.",1234569600,3,1550,4.316151202749141

There is; however, a sweet little love story in there but likely only those who can get past the language will be able to find it.

Then it switches gears (or screeches to a halt is a better way to put it), and it tries to be romantic and sweet.  But trying to be romantic and sweet when you've just been wall-to-wall, balls to the wall vulgar for so long...it just seems pointless.  Luckily at the end it has one more great jolt of comedy left in it, which in the end was worth hanging around for.  If the fat was trimmed off this sucker, it could have been a classic.  Still recommended, and highly for Dane Cook fans; he really runs wild here.  If you were disappointed by his movies thus far (ex. Good Luck Chuck with Jessica Alba...horrible), don't worry, this one delivers the goods...albeit with the aforementioned and unfortunate ""shoe-horned in"" romantic plot which waters down the fun.",1233360000,,875,4.535031847133758

I have tried to give Dane Cook a chance, and he just doesn't do it for me. Besides His role in Dan in Real life, his acting is rather unbeliveable and he often looks as though he is just trying too hard. And Kate Hudson, well, she is the same person in every movie, very one dimiensional. I would like to say this would be a good movie for a snowy day, but it wasn't.

If you like to laugh and aren't afraid of a little nudity or swearing, you will laugh your butt off! I rented it and watched it twice in a row and now I am buying it!

3682439,4,B001L9EXSY,"Normally I would have to make the statement that I'm not a Dane Cook fan.  Normally.  But... having watched this film, and a few others that Cook has been in (Good Luck Chuck and Employee of the Month come to mind), I think I may have to soften that stance and admit that occassionally I actually do find Dane Cook to be, well, funny.

Cook's stand-up comedy is not funny to me, at least not regularly so.  I know he has fans, but I just don't care for his style and delivery and find his humor to be lacking in anything that would make me laugh.

Take Cook and put him in the appropriate starring role though and I find myself laughing along with the crude humor (as in Good Luck Chuck and Employee of the Month), which is precisely the forumla that the team behind My Best Friend's Girl has gone for.

Cook plays a character that proudly carries the a--hole tag as a badge of honor.  He works by referral to serve as a complete a--hole that takes a--hole to a whole new level.  I won't spoil the gags and bits, but if you watch the film you'll see how it all plays out and you too would recognize that Cook's character is intentionally behaving as an a--hole just so we can inspire the women that would be girlfriends or significant others for the guys that are paying for his services to run crying back into the arms of those guys.  After one horrible date with Cook the ladies he chooses to go out with typically call up their boyfriends and apologize profusely for having chased away those boyfriends somehow.  Basically Cook's character makes those women appreciate the guys that paid him to work on their behalf.

The title of the film is My Best Friend's Girl so you know that somehow Cook will wind up with his best friend's girl.  Sure enough his overly sensitive best friend (American Pie's Jason Biggs) is hung up on one girl in particular that happens to be played by Kate Hudson.  When you have a resource such as Cook at your disposal and you are faced with the thought of being a creepy stalker or watching the girl you think you love go search for someone else, of course you convince your friend to work his magic for you.  Except, well, that magic doesn't seem to work as expected and Cook and Hudson may just wind up as more than friends.

Cook definitely generates several laughs with his boorish and crude behavior along the way.  When he's 'in character' as an a--hole he goes all out with somewhat hilarious results.  Toss in the quirks of Biggs' character, and a small part that is played incredibly well by Alec Baldwin and you have a pretty funny, although crude, film.

The picture quality is quite nice along the way, and the soundtrack is laden with several current tunes to enjoy, and also a bit of music to date by (you'll see what I mean if you watch) when Cook picks up his dates.  If you are going to watch this film, definitely go for the un-rated version for the extra laughs.

As noted, the Blu-ray version comes with Digital Copy as a bonus.",1232409600,4,2981,4.385454545454546
3682440,1,B001L9EXSY,"Well, I am not offended by vile language and chauvinism, but I am bored with it. At ninety minutes this film is two hours too long. Fortunately I walked away from it after about twenty minutes. I recommend others walk away from it before watching and see something else.

This movie, he is an a-hole to give women dates of pure hell in order to make them realize that they made a huge mistake to leave their boyfriends, let alone date Cook.

3682442,1,B001L9EXSY,"This movie was horrible. I didn't laugh at anything. I am still in utter shock that Kate Hudson would choose such a horrible role for herself (well, I can't say SHOCKED...I mean, she DID star in Fool's Gold, right?) and that Dane Cook continually lands acting gigs despite his complete lack of acting talent. He's a funny stand-up comic and I sometimes even find myself quoting some of his routine material with friends, but his acting is subpar and he seems to be stuck in this obnoxious, crude, pervert persona that he terrified audiences with in Good Luck Chuck. I can't wrap my brain around his meatloaf pock-marked face being a leading man in a film...especially opposite someone as cute as Kate Hudson...it's almost sacreligious!

  Kate Hudson's character had to have been written by a man. She's like some sort of blonde career woman who suddenly decides she wants to be a sex-maniac so she randomely starts sleeping around and living it up! It's definetly double sided that we live in a world where our leading man can sleep around and no one even bats an eyelash at him, but when a female does it she instantly comes off as slutty...but, it works for all the characters in this film. They are all Hooch bag, crab infested skank-balls.

  Lizzie Caplan did a clever job as Kate's nymphomaniac roomie who gives her pep talks about banging ""bad boys"" and getting laid more... I just don't personally live in a world where it's encouraged to sleep around and be a whore-monster face.

  Jason Biggs was the same old American Pie, Jim character, that he always is. Goofy, annoying, and unlucky with the ladies...so, nothing much new here.

  Overall, I am actually going to ask for my money back at my video store for this rental (we get 7 free 'I HATED THIS MOVIE AND WANT A FREE RENTAL' passes a year) because it was so bad. I actually contemplated turning it off halfway through but instead decided to leave it on while I did some work on my computer.",1231804800,7,1959,4.6138328530259365
