8107908,4,B000EAIBPC,"Good for fans of Michael Zaslow and/or GL. Bit disappointing in that too much attention was paid to Roger and Holly, less to his dastardly deeds.

No mention was given Lynn Deerfield or how Roger got to Springfield in 1971, his rape of Rita, etc., etc.

Still the clips shown are illuminated by Zaslow's charisma.",1277683200,2,313,4.672727272727273
8107909,5,B000EAIBPC,Wow did this bring back memories of watching with my mother and grandmother years ago.  I really wish they would put out a dvd of greatest episodes or the last few episodes of The Guiding Light.  It was the last link to my childhood and a valued friend when life wasn't always going so well...,1258070400,2,293,4.3090909090909095
8107910,5,B000EAIBPC,"Michael Zaslow was my first crush when he was playing David Renaldi, pianist and government spy, on One Life to Live in the eighties. I didn't know about his past as Roger Thorpe. Once I started watching the show in July 1991, I was hooked and addicted to the downfall of Roger Thorpe, the town scoundrel, thief, rapist, liar, and basically the town villain. As Roger Thorpe, Michael Zaslow commanded your attention. When he played against Maureen Garrett's Holly Norris, one of his many wives, his true love, and one of his rape victims, it was like two rolls royces colliding as I remember one soap critic wrote. Roger Thorpe had been remorseful and had never forgotten the beast that raped Holly during their turbulent marriage. Roger Thorpe was a fascinating character to watch and his marriage to the wealthy baroness, Alexandra Spaulding, played by first Beverlee McKinsey was electricifying. I think McKinsey who was the star of Texas and Another World had met her match with Zaslow's Roger. Of course, I started watching at the end of their tempestuous relationship to the say the least. It would be Alexandra's antics in the country club dining room surrounded by her friends and fellow castmates when she ostracized Roger Thorpe. I felt sorry for him to experience a woman scorned. While Alexandra tried to destroy him, he rose like the phoenix back up and into everybody's life and business. Nothing gets Roger Thorpe down well maybe except his father. I would have liked to have seen more of his relationship with Adam Thorpe (Robert Milli) which could explain a lot of Roger's behavior. Roger Thorpe wasn't just a villain but a complicated character with the likes of Othello's Iago. He brought out the worst in everybody around him even though he just wanted to belong and feel accepted. It was never enough for Roger Thorpe. When Roger wasn't around, you wished that Holly, Blake, Ed, and Ross and others were to remember his presence. As dastardly as he could be, Roger Thorpe was entertaining and most of all he was engaging and charming. I was heartbroken when Michael Zaslow lost his battle against ALS disease in 1998. In 2004, they decided to write in his death. I was hoping that Doug Hutchison's Sebastian Hulce would become his heir. Now that the show has finished today, there would be no more wondering about Roger Thorpe. I would love a book about the character's life. I enjoyed the tape version and they had one of Reva as well. Michael Zaslow's Roger Thorpe was definitely one of the genre's best characters--villain or otherwise.",1253232000,2,2560,4.83371298405467
8107911,5,B000EAIBPC,I love going back and seeing Roger and Holly.  The man behind Roger was a great actor.,1220313600,3,86,4.0588235294117645
8107912,5,B000EAIBPC,"I enjoy this documentary of GUIDING LIGHT character, Roger Thorpe. There isn't much to add since everything has been touched upon in a previous review. Michael Zazlow and Maureen Garrett appear in this video and discuss the history of their characters, Roger Thorpe and Holly Norris. There is slight discussion of Roger's arrival in Springfield and eventual marriage to the character, Peggy Fletcher, but a large portion of the video centers on the storyline that dealt with Holly pregnant with Roger's child while married to Ed Bauer and the conflict and outrageous schemes from Roger during this period. Vintage clips of the Bauer's are shown...you will see Don Stewart as Mike Bauer...Charita Bauer as Bert...and Martin Hulswit as Ed. Also making appearances on this video via classic clips are Jerry ver Dorn during his first days playing Ross Marler...a character he would continue to play for almost 25 years, leaving the series when his contract wasn't re-newed. Chris Bernau's original portrayal of Alan Spaulding is another plus, in addition to everything else you will see on the video. The late 1979/1980 Santo Domingo storyline is pretty much played out via a series of edits...every action from the time Roger and Holly arrive there to Ed and Mike finding out Roger's whereabouts to the chase scene in the jungle ultimately leading to the classic cliff scene where multiple gun-shot fires are heard. Ed is shot...but then, he ends up shooting Roger...who tumbles off a cliff...Ed grabs for him but his hand slipped and Roger fell to his ""death"" in 1980. Zazlow tells the story of how he was talked into returning to GUIDING LIGHT in 1989...Daniel Pilon's contract wasn't re-newed...he was the actor who was filling in for an ill Chris Bernau during 1988-1989. Zazlow was asked to return to the show and play Alan Spaulding. Feeling that the audience wouldn't go for him playing Alan Spaulding, given that the characters of Roger and Alan had various storylines together in the past, Zazlow suggested that Roger be brought back from the ""dead"". The concept of this was believable because of Roger's previous plots of faking his death to avoid prosecution and the like. So, after Zazlow was brought back onto the show, the writers dreamed up the storyline of newcomer Blake Lindsay...her back-story was revealed and viewers learned she was Christina Thorpe...Roger and Holly's daughter. Soon, Holly made a return to the show...and lastly, Roger returned under the guise of Adam Malik...lurking on a remote island and wearing a brown mask and Arabian attire. This Roger Thorpe video shows the return of Roger storyline from 1989...where Alan suspects that ""Adam Malik"" is Thorpe and in a quest to expose Malik, Alan sets in motion a wide array of plots aimed at Blake to draw Roger out of hiding. Finally, driven partially insane, Alan confronts Adam Malik in the loft of a church where Alan's adoptive son, Phillip, and Blake are getting married. After a violent confrontation in the loft with Alan, Adam/Roger grabs a vine and swings down among the crowd at the church...as he does this, Alan aims his gun and shoots twice. One shot gets Phillip...deranged by his mistake, he shoots again and hit Adam/Roger in the back. He falls amongst the crowd...Ed Bauer rushes over as does Holly...Adam's arabian headpiece is covering up his face and Ed very slowly removes the article of clothing and Roger's true identity is revealed. Holly lets out a blood curdling scream...the look on Ed and Ross's face is that or horror. The clips stop right at that scene. It's interesting that this video was produced in 1994 but it never shown any of Roger's plots and schemes from the remainder of 1989, or anything from 1990, 1991, 1992, or 1993. Perhaps the video was produced in 1990...but wasn't released until 1994? It's hard to tell...but this is a wonderful look at Roger Thorpe, one of the most loved soap opera bad guy's of all-time.",1187568000,2,3937,4.948640483383686
8107913,5,B000EAIBPC,"CBS and Proctor and Gamble released this video back in late 1994, and it was a look at one of the soap opera world's most fascinating villains. The late Michael Zaslow made ""Roger Thorpe"" an unforgettable character on the daytime drama ""Guiding Light"" (GL) from 1971-1980 and again from 1989-1997. The tape is basically a set of clips that Zaslow and his co-star, Maureen Garrett, (Holly) look back on as they make commentary on the storylines. The 1977-1980 part of this storyline is what drew me into watching the show. It's the only soap I've ever been addicted to.

Thorpe was a character study of a person in whom low self-esteem and paranoia collide into one volatile mixture. He did horrible things, and yet you could not help rooting for the guy because he seemed to be lashing out for the love he wanted so badly and could never attain. He was just so blind to the fact that the person that was sabotaging every relationship he had ever had was himself. Who can forget Roger's wild and outrageous schemes as his relationships with several women came to an end? Who could forget the alcoholic Ed Bauer, at first unaware of Holly's adultery, agreeing to raise Holly's daughter with Roger as his own? Then there were Roger's business schemes with Alan Spaulding that forced Alan to help Roger in order to avoid going to jail should Roger spill what he knew. Through it all, Roger did have a deep obsession for his daughter that he perceived as love.

Of course, the highlight of this video is watching the breath-taking  Santo Domingo storyline play out where Mike and Ed Bauer are on the trail of fugitive Thorpe and an abducted Holly. The landmark scene of Ed grabbing for Roger's hand as Roger is dangling off that cliff, Ed's grip slipping, and Roger's blood curdling scream as he's falling to his presumed death is still chilling.

GL's ratings were having trouble by the late 80's. Plus actor Chris Bernau, who had played Alan Spaulding since the character was introduced in 1977, died in 1989. Thus, Michael Zaslow was asked to return to GL to play Alan Spaulding. However, Zaslow knew GL fans better than GL knew them and realized this would never be accepted by viewers given Roger and Alan's antagonistic past. Thus it was decided to write Roger Thorpe back into the script with Zaslow portraying him once more. The film concludes showing how Roger managed to survive his 1980 fall and how he is still obsessed with his daughter who is now going by the name ""Blake"". The video ends with Roger making his appearance at her wedding where he is unmasked after being shot by Alan Spaulding.

In 1997, after this video had been made, Michael Zaslow began to experience difficulty speaking. When it became noticeable on screen, he was placed on leave at GL. There are conflicting stories as to whether Zaslow was then fired. However, there was a legal action against GL and sponsor Procter & Gamble by Zaslow which was eventually settled. It was some time before Zaslow was finally diagnosed with ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease. Again, GL seemed to misjudge their fans. When they recast Roger Thorpe with another actor the backlash was so severe that Roger had to be written out of the script. The only actor GL fans would ever accept in that role would be Zaslow, who sadly passed away in December 1998. This video is a great tribute to a great actor and the role he defined.",1168300800,8,3384,4.661641541038526
