8748703,5,B01AWWUBYA,"CrazyLegs Crane originally got his start with another Pink Panther affiliate series called Tijuana Toads (alias Texas Toads), and appeared in other short series before getting his own in 1978! These 16 shorts were seen on TV in the USA in the late 70's, sandwiched between 2 new Pink Panther shorts, and all of which would be seen in theatres as well, all over the world, from 1978 to '81! Unlike his 32 partnered Pink Panther shorts, in his own 2006 DVD set, all of these CrazyLegs shorts are USA TV prints, and no human gets any screen credit! Luckily, the bonus features will tell you who was in charge of them, other than David DePatie and Friz Freleng, and especially a then-recent toon legend Frank Welker playing CrazyLegs Jr. and the fire-breathing Dragonfly; there are 3 commentaries and 2 documentaries, also used for The Inspector and The Ant and the Aardvark's sets! Unlike the other 2 collections this was paired with, all 16 shorts contain laugh tracks, even in spite of being remastered! The other 2 collections had laugh tracks in some of the shorts, even with their being remastered! Beware of cranes in swamps, especially if one is chasing a Dragonfly, that sings new songs by mixing up multiple old ones, and breathes fire to boot!",1471478400,2,1250,4.738532110091743
8748704,4,B01AWWUBYA,"Nice, not too bad cartoons produced by Friz Freleng after he left Warner Brothers around 1963 to create the DePatie-Freleng cartoon studio that mostly made short subjects for United Artists in the 1960s and 1970s, and then wisely made them available (along with The Pink Panther) for TV for many years, creating a new generation of fans.

I hope that The Pink Panther cartoons made in the 1960s and 1970s will be put on Blu-ray one of these days.",1469232000,,446,4.6455696202531644
