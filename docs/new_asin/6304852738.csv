Great acting and a beautiful though cold photography drag you down into the Maelstrom of this great masterpiece!
Besides: in this movie Shaw Brothers veteran David Chiang gives his come back.",1005004800,2,510,4.741573033707865
8296197,5,6304852738,"This movie won't thrill the people looking only for fight films but for those who enjoy the full range of Hong Kong cinema should watch this. Based loosely on the One-Armed swordsman story, it is a tale of love, honor,  revenge and tragedy set with great acting and a powerful storyline. For  those who saw ""The Blade"" will find this a great movie to compare  with since it takes from the same roots.",949017600,2,400,4.4520547945205475
