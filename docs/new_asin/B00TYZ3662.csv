7026055,5,B00TYZ3662,"Great collection despite ""The Private War of Major Benson"" being in full-frame format and not Widescreen. All movies except ""The Perfect Furlough"" are in full-screen format and this collection provides English-only subtitles. The quality of the films are great despite being only on two disks. Two of eight were released as DVD-R and you can get them as straight pressed-disks. Overall this is a great collection for the price and I would recommend it.",1431993600,37,452,5.121621621621622
7026056,5,B00TYZ3662,"I waited over 4 months for the release this movie by Amazon and finally got it.. ""The Private War of Major Benson"",  It is well worth the wait and price of this entire Eight Movies, Two DVD Set .. It was only available in VHS and Non-USA format for a long time..
Major Benson was a hard nosed Army Officer who trained recruits and was in disfavor of the general, He was ordered to be the head of a military school, that was in danger of losing it's ROTC charter, or leave the army. The results were heartfelt and also very funny. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another copy. because I know it would make a great gift.",1431993600,21,613,4.194915254237288

7026060,4,B00TYZ3662,"For $5.00, these are a good deal for a few good-old wartime movies. They are all entertaining and, for the younger viewers, may show how Americans thought about the Armed Forces and how we tried to make the best of bad circumstances.

Overall, the picture quality is pretty good for these aged movies. Unfortunately, the audio & video were out of sync on a few of the movies. Two (Major Benson & The Perfect Furlough) were the most out of sync. Since these are 2 of my favorites, I even tried them on another DVD player but they were still a bit off-kilter; a little better but still not perfect. This is why I slight 1 star.

Overall, an interesting look into the past depicting some real history and showing our growth as a nation and people.",1516924800,,744,4.423357664233577

7026064,3,B00TYZ3662,"Wow. Imagine my surprise when I watched some of these movies with my children who are young adults and felt ashamed for the film makers and stars I fondly remember. The best of the bunch: Hail the Conquering Hero, The Perfect Furlough and Francis Joins the Wacs. Abbott and Costello are still a hoot and there movies were in the middle of my ratings. Bob Hope sad to say was NOT FUNNY and was insulting when he fell into mud rose up with mud on his face, wiped his eyes leaving a rim of white around his eyes and uttered ""Mammy"". Bing Crosby sang a great song but in Black face! These minstrel references and musical numbers are particularly offensive.
In The Private War of Major Benson the woman doctor is, in today's terms, sexually harassed if not assaulted when Charlton Heston roughly grabs her and kisses her at a point in the movie when she has expressed NO interest in him. This may have been in character because he is clearly out of touch with normal conduct in the first half of the movie but it was a little alarming to see that happen and then have the female lead turn around and 'fall in love' after that kind of treatment.
All in all I love my old comedies and I have to take the good with the bad since we can't change the past.",1511827200,,1246,4.283898305084746
7026065,5,B00TYZ3662,"hadn't seen some of these movies in over 40 years like Major Benson with Charlton Heston, is a charming humor story of a mouthy officer demoted to head of a ;young boys catholic military school where is brand of discipline is even less appreciated ;but turns out well, also really enjoyed seeing hail the conqering  hero with  Eddie Bracken again for first time  in decades and Bing Crosby croning through a Johnny Mercer score from 1944 and when  Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh were still a couple in the perfect furlough as for the other 4 I already had on different collections but all great movies. 2 Abbott and Costellos. a Bob Hope. and a Francis the talking mule with Donald O'Connor",1510358400,,687,4.60655737704918

As to the content, personally don't quite understand what those late 1950 movies are doing in this package but the rest (truly wartime movies) are just great.",1510012800,,359,4.774193548387097

He is quite good, it's too bad he didn't take on more comedy roles, the only other one I can remember is The Pigeon That Took Rome. But the rest of the films are also quite good, Hail the Conquering Hero is top grade Preston Sturges. The DVD is a great buy for such a good collection of films..",1502150400,,447,4.149425287356322

Francis (the talking mule) Joins the WACS didn't seem as funny as when I saw this as a kid, but the humor has changed drastically since then - still an enjoyable pic.
