7813989,5,630170455X,I own over fifty ballet videos and this is the one I keep pulling off the shelf.  The white swan pas de duex with Natalia Makarova is worth buying the video alone.  The seven selections are wonderful and the dancing is near perfect.  What I can never seem to get over is how from the classical to the romantic each dancer understands the hues and shadows that each era has woven into its tradition.  The American companies tend to dance each era as if they were all from the classical/Petipa era.  Dance lovers will appreciate the subtleties and be under the dancers spell start to finish.,1086739200,10,589,4.518867924528302
