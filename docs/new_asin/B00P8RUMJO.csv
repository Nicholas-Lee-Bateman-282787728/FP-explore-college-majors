8686958,2,B00P8RUMJO,"Wicked Wicked is an amusing film about a stalker killing pretty blonde women in a hotel. There's nothing unusual about that except for the movie's gimmick of presenting the entire story in split screen, which is a novelty but it does kind of dilute the suspense rather. Split screen can work in horror - Brian De Palma has used it on more than one occasion and made effective use of it, but here it's rather irritating. What doesn't help is you never really get a good view o anything as the two images are small and not very hi definition (well it was 1973!). For just a couple of very short moments of screen time, the double screen reverts to a single view and seeing this left me yearning for the whole movie to be like this, so that watching it would be less hard work!
.
Apart from the gimmick, most other aspects of Wicked, Wicked are fun but mediocre. The only DVD release is on the Warner Archive label which is very badly cut! Those archive DVDs are sold at a premium price so pushing an incomplete version of the film is quite an insult to the fans who wish to buy it. For novelty value only.",1452902400,,1103,4.282296650717703
8686959,2,B00P8RUMJO,"The transfer is not in the original aspect ratio, so they crop a little bit of both sides, and one scene is cut from the original version. That scene is complete in any version you can download from the web. I don't understand how they do this. I'll still waiting for a good edition.",1451779200,,283,4.2592592592592595
8686960,4,B00P8RUMJO,"Although the film transfer still isn't perfect, I know that Warner Archives worked on this film for about two years.  Because of the split-screen DuoVision process, restoring this film was practically like restoring two different films.

Sometimes, information that we see visually on one side of the frame actually contradicts what somebody on the other side of the frame is saying.  This is done several times for humorous effect, and is quite clever.

The film itself is a decent masked-killer body-count film, but never ascends to the delirious heights reached by MGM's previous early 1970s shocker, PRIVATE PARTS (1972).  Odd that MGM released both PRIVATE PARTS and WICKED WICKED theatrically, as both thrillers depict hotels from which few people ever checked out!",1436486400,2,771,5.286885245901639
8686961,5,B00P8RUMJO,"Wicked, Wicked starred Edd Byrnes and was released in 1973. Good support is provided by Diane McBain his fellow Warner Brothers studio contract star. Wild mystery with many thrills, set around murders happening at a hotel. Edd Byrnes fans will like this the most.",1435622400,2,263,5.0
8686962,5,B00P8RUMJO,I have been waiting along time for this motion picture to be released on DVD.  The quality is very good with great stereo sound.,1424044800,7,128,4.333333333333333
8686963,3,B00P8RUMJO,"Sometimes ideas work better on paper than they do when put into action. The movie experience Duo-Vision was one of them. The ill-fated idea had an entire movie presented in split-screen. Each half showed a different angle or scene taking place during the movie with them merging together at certain pivotal moments. 1973s slasher film Wicked, Wicked is the first and only movie to utilize this unique viewing experience for an entire movie.

A masked killer (Randolph Robert) is stalking women at the upscale Grandview Hotel in California. Bodies begin to pile up as the manager does his best to hide the murders from guests. All the victims have one thing in common  they're all blond. Brunette lounge singer Lisa James (Tiffany Bolling) becomes a target when she dons a blond wig for her performances. Can her ex-husband and former police officer Rick Stewart (David Bailey) keep her safe?

Wicked, Wicked is one of those movies that would have worked beautifully as part of a Horror Remix. If you aren't familiar with Horror Remixes, let me enlighten you. Three films with the same themes (Christmas, Sharks, Sorority Houses) are put together as an anthology. Each one is edited down to its basic ingredients. For example, if all the superfluous narrative and dialogue is cut out from Silent Night, Deadly Night Part II, the 90 minute movie would end up clocking in at around 30 minutes. Most of the time all that is left is the killing sequences, nudity, and basic plot points.

The good parts of Wicked, Wicked are fun, while the bad sections are exhausting to watch as characters yammer with each other back and forth. Things get entertaining when the masked killer shows up onscreen and takes out his victims. Actor Randy Roberts does a great job keeping the viewer bouncing back and forth between empathy and fright. Flashbacks help communicate the murderers tragic past.

Most of the action in Wicked, Wicked is accompanied by the original Phantom of the Opera score. Its awkwardly played by an old lady sitting at an organ. Many times shes shown in one frame as the killings and drama unfold on the other half. It seems like the director was trying to fill space on one side because they didn't have enough footage to accompany certain scenes.

The only special feature included for ""Wicked, Wicked"" is a trailer. It was only released on standard DVD and is available as a manufactured-on-demand item. It would've been nice to see some reflection on the movie and its Duo-Vision gimmick by the cast and crew, but Warner Archive rarely includes much bonus material.

Wicked, Wicked is rated PG for adult situations, violence, profanity, alcohol and smoking, and frightening and intense sequences. If released now in theaters, it would be given a PG-13 rating. There are some bloody scenes with victims gawking wide-eyed out from the screen. Sexual situations are insinuated and include hints at incest.

Viewing Wicked, Wicked is an experience everyone should participate in at least once in their life. Its tiring at points and will no doubt test your attention span, but must be seen since the concept died with this film. By no means is it a good movie. However, the event is worth the headache you might get darting your eyes back and forth from left to right to take as much in as possible from each side of the screen.",1417651200,7,3333,4.8350877192982455
8686964,1,B00P8RUMJO,"Unless this film has gone public domain, I would worry about the legality of this release.  Warner Brothers now owns this MGM film, and Warner honcho George Feltenstein commented in the February issue of Fangoria Magazine that Warner has painstakingly restored the film for the label's Warner Archives MOD program.  The official Warner release is expected around Halloween of 2013, along with the Peter Lorre classic BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS.

For the best quality print of WICKED WICKED, I'd wait for the official Warner Archives release.

If I'm incorrect about this film's legal status, I'll delete this ""preview.""

The movie was filmed in ""Duo-Vision,"" in which much of the film is shown in split-screen.  George Feltenstein commented that restoring it (for Warner Archives) was almost like restoring two separate films, due to the split-screen imagery.

The oddball cast includes 70's lounge singer/exploitation actress Tiffany Bolling, Edd ""Kookie"" Byrnes from the hit Warner TV series 77 SUNSET STRIP, movie tough guy Scott Brady, 60's starlet Diane McBain, and a slumming Madeleine Sherwood (remembered for supporting performances in some 1950's Tennessee Williams adaptations).

The plot centers on a killer wearing a horror mask who's stalking and killing blonde female guests at a once-luxurious seaside hotel.  The story seems inspired by a great MGM horror release from the previous year, PRIVATE PARTS (1972).",1364428800,7,1422,5.427272727272728
