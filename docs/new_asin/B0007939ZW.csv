8045970,2,B0007939ZW,"This is an example of what happens when European filmmakers try to mimic an American family movie.  The problem is they are so steeped in the European film tradition that they don't know the difference.  They make a film centered around children, but they adopt their usual slo-o-ow pace, have no plot at all, and make a film in which there is nothing of consequence at stake and in which the only things that happen are trivial.  Even the ghosts are neutralized within the first few minutes, since the little girl makes friends with them and they are merely boring thereafter as they dance and sing choral songs.  Also, the movie is only 80 minutes long instead of the cannonical 96 minutes.

If you're a screenwriter, you might study this as an example of how NOT to make a children's movie, or a family movie, or indeed any movie.

Rates two stars for the good filming of scenes of Austria.

Not worth even one viewing.",1148428800,17,922,4.551515151515152
