At the beginning, I thought the movie was just starting slowly to create background for the characters.  This is annoying, but I chose to continue watching anyways.

Then the knight training began.  This was ok, and it finally looked like it was going to get really cool.  Maybe they would actually go on missions or work on making a postapocalyptic civilization.  But no.  It just ended right before the best part of the movie was supposed to happen.  No end credits.  What the heck?  Did the end get cut off?  Or does the movie just stop before anything happens?

Maybe it doesn't really matter.  The movie wasn't what I had hoped for anyways.",1449100800,,741,4.6
