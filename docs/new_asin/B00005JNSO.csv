8463513,5,B00005JNSO,"Among the many cameos in director Tom Schiller's bizarre cult film NOTHING LASTS FOREVER (1984)
is Calvert DeForest, best known to early David Letterman fans as Larry ""Bud"" Melman, a fat little
guy with a high pitched voice and a ""glad to be here no matter the reason"" demeanor.

Perhaps because Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels is one of this film's producers,
two SNL alumni, Bill Murray and Dan Akyroyd, have minor roles.

The cheesy lunar landscape set reminds one of an equally cardboard FORBIDDEN ZONE (1980),
yet the stories are as different as can be.

It's the story of a young man who wishes to be an artist. He's given the chance to travel to the moon
on a standard commuter bus. Once arrived, this being an MGM picture, a musical number with
semi-munchkin pretensions accompanies the many space voyagers as they're transported to a lunar
shopping center called MOON-O-RAMA (""Carousel of Consumer Values"").

Typical of ""classic era"" musicals, the story screeches to a brief halt during the female lead's solo spot.
No worries, for the plot then immediately resolves (after our falling hero screams, ""STELLLLLLLLAAAA!"").

Folks who have seen this most rare film either want to view it again, or wish they hadn't the first time.
If you've read this far, you're probably a ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" fan. As for me, I always enjoy
obscure, quasi-surreal, pseudo-antique cinema, and this 82 minute film surely fits that description!

BTW...
This picture may never reach official home video, but rejoice, it can be found at such websites as
Rare Movies Worldwide, and for an incredibly reasonable price. (No, I'm not affiliated with them!)",1433548800,5,1652,5.010948905109489
8463514,4,B00005JNSO,"I recently screened this film and it's very unusual. However, it's also a well-made production and very entertaining. And unlike many odd films, it isn't incoherent junk: it's a fun and engaging story (despite it's wackiness). However, it's not for all tastes. Too bad that it's generally unavailable (from what I can tell there are some rights issues preventing a DVD release).",1326844800,,378,5.112903225806452
8463515,4,B00005JNSO,"I saw this movie 20-some years ago, when it was released to a few select markets. How PHOENIX was chosen, I'll never know! There were more than a few walk-outs. My friend and I found it magical and captivating. A few years ago I bought a DVD from Five Minutes to Live, that was apparently transferred from a TV broadcast. The picture quality is pretty poor -- but those of you who've seen the movie know that doesn't necessarily compromise the experience. The movie has its flaws. Granted, the production design aims for an unpolished look, but sometimes the production quality is poor in ways that were surely unintended. And the final sequence of the movie is weak, with a rushed and clumsy wrapping-up of the story. The magic comes from the mixture of whimsy, satire, stylistic anachronisms, and delightful performances by an off-beat cast.  A terrific score by the now famous Howard Shore.",1261526400,3,893,4.798701298701299
8463516,5,B00005JNSO,I enjoyed this film very much because it was different from the usual predictable plots I have become accustomed to. You can make great films with a low budget and a little imagination and I cannot understand any harsh criticism of this movie. When is it coming out on DVD? Can't someone run off a few copies for creative people? Very alternative...excellent!,1230163200,3,359,4.806451612903226
8463517,5,B00005JNSO,"I first saw this film on the BBC in the mid 80's.  It was shown on Alex Cox's Moviedrome and I'm not even sure he knew what to make of it.  I won't go into the plot, suffice to say that it's a beautiful comic tale of love, passion and charity, but what sets it apart is the peculiar cinematography and use of 30's stock footage.  It also has a cast that even today would be to die for.

It's criminal that this film isn't available (legally).  It goes to show everything that's wrong about copyright law.",1167782400,6,504,4.154639175257732
8463518,5,B00005JNSO,"This film appeared a number of times on Turner Network over a decade ago--that's how I saw it--and it is crying out for a dvd release. It's as much an American, cinematic comedy classic as the best of Woody Allen.

It is a very original, witty and tongue-in-cheek film, part comedy, part satire and part fantasy. Written by a great comedy writer Tom Schiller (Saturday Night Live), it features great cameo appearances by Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd. It achieves the type of humour Woody Allen achieved at his very best, and then some more. Zach Gilligan stars as Adam Beckett, the original absurd young man, who wants to be an artist but has no talent. He undertakes the appropriate odyssey all the same. Indeed, if you ever wanted to make out on the moon and then end up playing Chopin's Heroic Polonaise in Carnegie Hall, then this is the film for you. It will also teach you many fine things, like who are the true spiritual overlords of the universe. Hail Father Knickbocker! Or else just repeat after me 'Snip Snap Snorum, Hey Kak Koroum!' and your spiritual conquest of the moon shall begin.",1160438400,,1097,4.625641025641026
