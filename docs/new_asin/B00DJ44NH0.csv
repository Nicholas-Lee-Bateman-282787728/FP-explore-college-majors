5819310,3,B00DJ44NH0,"Fun for what it was----overly exaggerated evils of marijuana and premarital sex.  I'm not saying there may not be consequences for reckless behavior, but it's hard to believe these films would ever actually scare someone straight.",1435795200,2,230,5.388888888888889

5819312,5,B00DJ44NH0,"A lot of good schlock films here. Terror of tiny town? An all midget, musical, western! The mind boggles.",1427241600,6,105,4.578947368421052
5819313,5,B00DJ44NH0,"What a hoot! Blast from the Past at it's best!! The film quality had deteriorated in parts of some of the flicks, but I tried to relate to it as part of the seedy, smoky, ambiance of these ""Perils of Vice"" hysterical, er, historical, films.",1422057600,8,240,4.355555555555555
5819314,4,B00DJ44NH0,"The title is surely misleading, but I enjoyed some of the movies. Unfortunately some of them seem very interesting, but the sound quality is so low, I could hardly understand what the actors say. Since I'm not a native speaker of English, I hope Mill Creek Ent. will remaster the films.",1421452800,9,286,4.627450980392157

5819316,4,B00DJ44NH0,"A wonderfully goofy -- and arguably classic -- exploitation film collection that includes infamous movies about getting ""doped up"" and paying the consequences of such dubious behavior.  The films, in various degrees of preservation (I use the word loosely), are campy and unintentionally hilarious -- except of course if you take any of it seriously.  The mindset presented in these unintentionally hilarious cautionary stories was in fact somewhat representative of the conservative concerns of the 30s, 40s and 50s.  And no doubt in some cases people still living.  As an art form, this sub genre can be enjoyed on more than one level -- and not just as an excuse for breaking out that medicinal marijuana stash.  I still have a warm place in my heart for TERROR OF TINY TOWN (a western with a cast of small persons and their shetland ponies), and CHAINED FOR LIFE (starring the real life ""Siamese twin"" Hilton sisters (no relation to Paris).  Recommended for what it is.  More than 12 hours of solid laughs at a great price.  How much is that worth?",1378598400,20,1052,4.805555555555555

8593670,3,B00DJ44NH0,Love these old movies. Reefer Madness is the headliner but Cocaine Fiends is the hidden gem. worth a watch if you love your propaganda heavy handy and with a large slice of cheese. Only downside is the poor transfers that look like they came from a vhs tape.,1464912000,,258,4.395833333333333

8593673,4,B00DJ44NH0,"Taboo Tales is a paring down of Mill Creek Entertainment's 2006 release ""Cult Classic"".  Which was a 20 movie pack.  Many, if not all, of these movies were made to be ""Cautionary"" films.  Meant to ward the viewer away from the topic material.  Like in ""Reefer Madness"".  It was made to ward us away from Marijuana.
  Instead, these films became hilariously funny!  Mostly because of how they were portrayed.  If you want a good laugh at how these films make us laugh at the subject matter, than by all means watch these!!!",1446940800,4,522,4.586956521739131
