Alternate English title: LOVE IS A CRAZY THING.

Korean actress Jeon Mi-Seon's cheerful face on the DVD cover gives the wrong impression. This is a melancholy story of a woman resorting to more and more depraved means to provide for her family. At movie's start, she works a phone sex line -- where there's one caring client who she confides in thru out the movie -- before descending to hostess/prostitute.

Most of the movie is surprisingly non-exploitive. Then, towards the end we get an excessively long scene of a beating, and a fairly tame (but dramatically shocking) sex scene. However, I found the story didn't really have depth -- relying on its star to provide the honesty of a woman in that situation.

But that's easy for Jeon Mi-seon (pronounced: chun mee-sun) with her achingly vulnerable quality, down-to-earth prettiness (altho often made to be plain) and shy smile. I couldn't take my eyes off of her. And I wanted so much to run to her aid.

This film is worthwhile if you can put-up with slow-paced, understated storytelling with some surprising twists, beautiful photography and the alluring Jeon Mi-seon.",1218758400,,1147,4.958333333333333
