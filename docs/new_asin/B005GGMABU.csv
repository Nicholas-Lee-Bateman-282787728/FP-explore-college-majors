4690474,5,B005GGMABU,"To quote Dan Sallitt, ""The Sleeping Beauty's devious achievement of concealing extreme artistic ambition behind casual genre play, and thematic scope behind narrative whimsy, places it among Breillat's greatest works--possibly at the top of the pile.""",1322956800,6,251,6.0
4690475,5,B005GGMABU,"The Sleeping Beauty is a beautifully told story. There are a number of characters that are varied and interesting. This movie is a fantasy with a sleepworld that feels like a dream as it's meant to be. The fairies explain the crux of what's happening. A little girl princess is a confident soul who doesn't scare easily, but she thinks her life is dull. After her personality is explained, the curse begins. There are wonderful things to look at throughout. For example, the mother princess and her outfits are gorgeous. She does cares about her little girl, but her emotions are flat. It doesn't seem like the little girl would miss her mother too badly if she didn't see her in the future. Besides, the mother princess was brought up by an aloof, but caring  mother herself.  Some parts are a bit subtle like when the little girl momentarily identifies with a bee queen because she is after all princess and a princess could become a queen. If this girl awakens from her sleep, would she know it was a dream? Would she know, understand or recognize anything? I saw this movie several times to catch more of the details and also just because I liked it.",1322784000,11,1154,4.570048309178744
4690476,1,B005GGMABU,"First alert as to the quality of this movie is the total gross US theater income was under $30,000.
Second alert is that the 10 most visible actors have either no previous acting, or a limited number of TV spots and series.
Third alert is a collage of scenes that not only have no interconnectedness but were just jumbled together. Plot had potential but sometimes a writer/director gets caught up in an arrogance of cleverness and the story suffers as a result. The viewer ends up detached with no connection to the story and actors. It's difficult to convey dreams since they are a jumbled personal amalgam of experiences; if not done with universality and clarity it just ends up like the movie - a mess.

Summary:
Grandma puts a curse on newly born grand daughter Anastasia to die at age 16 while mom is lying there smiling as she's listening to the impending doom. Second scene is of three girls standing in a pond waving their arms above the water like a ballet Port de bras who later show up to alter Grandma's curse to just have Anastasia go to sleep at age six; dream for a hundred years and wake up when she's sixteen.
The rest of the movie is about her dreams except the end which went nowhere.
The dreams are: In a cavern bowling a human skull at some leg bones for no reason; sitting in a train while traveling nowhere; found walking on the tracks by a mom and her son where she is adopted and just eats; a few months later she gets on a train and stops at a town with a dwarf who tells her to leave; ends up at a castle where she eats some more; leaves in a carriage where Gypsies bash in the head of her driver, kidnap her and she eats some more; saddles up a deer that carries her across a lot of snow; wakes up in contemporary times - end of story.",1322438400,6,1765,4.252976190476191

8471540,1,B005GGMABU,"This book is NOT FOR CHILDREN!! Be forewarned. I'm disgusted with this movie. How did they get past 7/8 of the movie to suddenly switch to what seems like an x-rated lesbian film? Also, it seemed to make the guys in the movie at fault? What the?",1376870400,2,245,4.23404255319149

8471542,2,B005GGMABU,"It could have gone somewhere, but it screeched to a halt.  The artistic value of this film deserves  four stars; however, watching this story, feels as if you are previewed to someone's mental burp; alas, it was probably an attempt to be subtle and way too clever.  It could have used a producer or someone to create scenes that meaningfully connected the scattered pieces. One thing is to make a symbolic film where the pieces are there if you look hard enough, another is to create a film in whatever order they were gathered. Perhaps if we had a peek of the mind that created it, maybe it would work.",1372723200,4,603,4.463636363636364
8471543,3,B005GGMABU,"This is a story about what happens when Beauty is sleeping. For most of the movie, it is a movie that appears very childlike and innocent to the innocent. But for the adults, it is anything but. It is only the ending that takes it in another direction.

It is very French in its vision and angst, so if you like that style of cinema, you will enjoy this little film.",1365638400,,366,4.154929577464789
8471544,4,B005GGMABU,"In the French tradition this does not sugarcoat a classic Fairy tale as Hollywood or Disney but treats the subject matter and even the children as actual human beings with complexity and edge.  I'm sure there are parents who may question this as appropriate for little children with some brief nudity at times.  But it's not really sexual though, except for some well depicted adolescent awkwardness.  Certainly for the teens or adults this is an interesting take on a classic.  And I'm sure for many Americans, myself included,  this will cause some reflection on the real meaning of the tale.",1363737600,4,594,4.9
8471545,1,B005GGMABU,"The beginning to middle is quite intriguing and I was enjoying it fairly well... then the plot disintegrated, the scenes became random and lacking in depth and the ending was totally ungratifying.  I literally rolled my eyes as the credits ending scrolled - felt like a total waste.  The fact that she's 100 years older but a character she met before she fell asleep is only 10 years older is still puzzling me.  *sigh*",1336521600,8,419,4.635135135135135
