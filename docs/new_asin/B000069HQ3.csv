1734468,3,B000069HQ3,"""Last Orders"" is a reasonably simple plot: a guy dies, is cremated, and has his ashes scattered. Within that plot are enough twists to make your head spin. Michael Caine as Jack does a good job in a role that doesn't demand a huge emotional output. Caine delivers his usual subtle performance as he faces death and worries about leaving something to take care of his wife. Helen Mirren from Gosford Park as his wife Amy does her usually brilliant job of extracting tremendous depth, even with a meager framework from which to draw.
The cockney accents were difficult for me, from the USA, to decipher. It was about 1/3 of the way through before I started picking up on them. In the meantime, there are so many flashbacks with the past characters played by different actors that it becomes hard to figure out who from the present is who in the past. Newcomer JJ Field has nice screen presence as Michael Caine's younger Jack. Kelly Reilly as the beautiful young Amy doesn't much resemble Helen Mirren other than hair color, but brought life and energy to the role. I appreciated the issues of having a mentally disabled daughter and how each parent dealt with it. Laura Morelli played June, now an adult, lost in her own world, emotionally disconnected and isolated. Bob Hoskins does a nice job of carrying a torch for Amy. His younger self is well played by Anatol Yusef who sets the brothel workers abuzz with the size of his endowments. David Hemmings, 40 years after ""Blow Up"" looks quite different with eyebrows wildly careening across his brow, looking like escapees from Hogwarts.
As with one other reviewer, my wife who rented the flick walked out on it. Although it's not easy at first, it is rewarding to finally connect the dots on the picture, making a satisfying evening's entertainment. Enjoy!",1039564800,,1806,4.7365079365079366
1734469,4,B000069HQ3,"The movies central characters are a bunch of bar buddies that have spent their adult lives in and around one another.  When one of them dies, the life of the party; Michael Caine, his last orders are for his ashes to be poured in the Ocean off a local seaside resort pier.  This requires the bunch of them (his 3 bar buddies and his son) to drive about a day away to complete this last task for their friend.
The dialogue is very well done, but I'm sorry to say for me, very hard to understand.  As an American, the dialogue was fast and with too many British figures of speak to pick up quick.  I'm sure I missed 25% of the movie.  Given that, what I did catch was marvelous.
As with any group of people that spent their lives together, they are intertwined with tensions and there is a history behind each one.  The movie flashes back to bits of recollection and gives some history for the tensions involved.  I thought this was very well done.  It gave you the true feeling that many have when a person passes away: He was just sitting here yesterday! This is really brought home with the flashbacks.
Michael Caine is the central character and the man that has passed away. His character and his past is well portrayed as well as that of his friends.  You get a sense of what pulls them together as well as what repels them about one another.  It is not a bigger than life story, but one you can easily imagine yourself being part of.
Here you see how some men grieve; silently, quietly and most often alone. You can also see as we all do, when another dies, we all start to take stock as well.
This is not a horribly sad movie, as the remembering is not done in a maudlin way.  These men remember their friend, the fun they had together, the animosities each have felt at time, then like with most of us, life goes on.",1038355200,7,1822,4.252173913043478
1734470,4,B000069HQ3,"Viewing this film a mere days after reading Graham Swift's splendid novel on which it is based, influenced my perception and no doubt limited my appreciation of it.

1734471,5,B000069HQ3,"What a delightful treat. In many ways it is a moving essay/ testament about the death of a friend and the end of an era. Yet, with the absolutely brilliant cast and dialog, this movie is like reliving beautiful moments in one's life: the loves, tragedies, sharing and joy of friendship. Because of the great writing, direction and editing, I was truly lifted by this film. Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Helen Mirren,Michael Caine, Tom Courtney and David Hemmings all shine in their moments. Ray Winstone has become a terrific actor and now belongs with the elete of British film actors. Hoskins, always so much better in these British dramas then Hollywood junk, shines. ""Last Orders"" is a film I hold in the highest regard. There are moments in this film where you feel like you are among friends. Suberb indeed!!",1037750400,3,811,4.8
1734472,4,B000069HQ3,"Do you ever wonder how your death will affect spouse, children, and, especially, lifelong friends in the short term? This is a question explored by LAST ORDERS, which in common usage means the final drink requests before the closing of an English pub.
Set in London and southeast England, the film opens with undertaker Vic (Tom Courtney) bringing the ashes of his good friend Jack (Michael Caine) to the local watering hole for a last pint with Jack's other lifelong friends, Ray (Bob Hoskins) and Lenny (David Hemmings), along with Vince (Ray Winstone), the son of Jack and Amy (Helen Mirren). Since Jack had expressed the wish to have his ashes scattered into the English Channel at the seaside city of Margate, the four men pile into a luxury Mercedes selected by Vince from his auto dealership as appropriate to the occasion, and set off for the coast. Amy has declined to come along. Rather, she spends the day visiting June (Laura Morelli), Jack and Amy's [handicapped] daughter, who's spent fifty years in an institution. June is so severely handicapped that she's never once recognized Amy as her mother, though the latter has visited once each week over the decades - alone.
The film's Cockney English dialog is difficult to fully understand until one's ear becomes attuned. For me, this was about a third into the movie. Since much of the speaking during this time occurs over a pint, or in the Benz headed to Margate, there's not much action to give clues as to what's being discussed. (My wife gave up and left me to hang tough.) Indeed, if it wasn't for the flashbacks generated by the memories and conversations among Jack's survivors - some extending back to World War II and before - the film would be a tad dreary.
The stellar cast of LAST ORDERS does a commendable job, along with the actors portraying the characters' younger selves, illustrating several truths surrounding death of advanced age: the old were young (or at least younger) once and full of life and passions; relationships of long standing are often not what they appear on the surface and can conceal deep currents; the lives of the survivors must necessarily go on. For these reasons, I liked this film in the balance, although the ordinariness of the plot is determined from the start by the middle class ordinariness of all the characters. I mean, the lives of Jack, Ray, Lenny, Vic and Amy are perhaps not far removed from the lives of most of that generation - perhaps yours, or that of the elderly folks next door. LAST ORDERS is nowhere near being a great film, but perhaps is a representation of real life that's worth viewing on a contemplative, rainy day afternoon.",1035590400,8,2661,4.761904761904762
1734473,5,B000069HQ3,"This is a lovely little movie, in a very small, unflashy, quiet way. For me it was about the extraordinary that we encounter in our ordinary lives -- the unbearable cruelness and sweet kindness that humans can show each other. I cried, but also was warmed by this gentle little flick. The cast is wonderful and really bring life to these flawed, complicated and very human characters. There is a lot pressed into this movie, and perhaps some of the stories could have been better developed, but isn't life like that sometimes too, half-realized, barely glimpsed?",1035158400,2,562,4.864583333333333
1734474,5,B000069HQ3,"Upon reaching a certain age, especially when a proper catalyst is provided, one may become won't to consider and reflect upon the life one has lived-- to take stock, as it were.  And, without question, the death of a long-time, close friend or associate can effect such a catalysis, which is precisely what happens in ""Last Orders,"" directed by Fred Schepisi, a drama that suggests that perhaps the end of a life can offer a valuable and renewed perspective to those who go on to write yet another chapter of their own in this great book we fondly know as the Human Comedy.  Finally, it's about individual resolve and beginnings that can be found in endings, and the life therein reserved for those who may yet count themselves among the living.
Jack (Michael Caine), a working class butcher in London, planned one day to retire with his lovely wife, Amy (Helen Mirren), to the seaside hamlet of Margate.  As often happens in life, however, Jack was denied the realization of his dream by the unbidden intervention of Fate, in the form of it's eternal emissary, The Grim Reaper.  But Jack enters his everlasting sleep even as he lived his life, one step ahead of the other guy; and the attainment of his final wish begins with the consigning of his ashes to his three closest, life-long friends and his son, Vince (Ray Winstone), along with a request he adjures them as a group to honor.  And so it is that Vince, Vic (Tom Courtenay), Lenny (David Hemmings), and Jack's best friend, Ray (Bob Hoskins), set out on a journey to effect the ""Last orders"" of their good friend, Jack; a journey that will take them into the future by way of the past, as they reflect upon what has gone before, and the possibilities that now lay ahead.
With this film, Schepisi has crafted and delivered what is essentially a moment in time; a moment he examines through a sentimental journey rife with all of the hard knocks and stoic truths that made up Jack's life, and which he presents just as Jack lived it.  And a sentimental journey though it may be, don't expect to be seeing it through rose colored glasses.  As the story unfolds, what emerges is a portrait of a complex individual made up of the myriad and many facets of the human condition.  And each flashback, combined with an episode from the present, reveals another piece of the puzzle that was Jack; and by the end, the picture we have of him is complete.  We see him for who and what he really was, good, bad or indifferent, with all the flaws and foibles that were part and parcel of the ebb and flow of his life-- everything that defined him as a human being.  Also, inasmuch as the story is told through the eyes of his friends and loved ones, it necessarily follows that they are revealed, as well, especially Amy and Ray.  We do get to know Vince, Vic and Lenny, of course, but to something of a lesser degree.  In the final analysis, then, what Schepisi has created here is nothing less than an intimate and incisive character study through which Jack, his friends and their story comes vividly to life.  Schepisi does the material proud, but then he was, of course, afforded the talents of an extraordinarily gifted ensemble cast, from which he extracts a number of memorable performances.
As Lawrence Jamieson in 1988's ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"" he was the most suave and sophisticated gentleman (albeit con man) the screen has seen since Niven or Grant, but without question, since his portrayal of ""Alfie,"" in 1966, Michael Caine has been everyones favorite cockney, and no one-- make that NO one-- does it better.  And it's precisely that nuance of character that Caine brings to his portrayal of Jack that makes him so alive and convincing.  Caine can be ingratiating even when he's playing a ""hard"" guy, and there is a decidedly hard side to Jack; but there's a very caring side to Jack, too, which Caine also manages to convey with facility, and he does a splendid job of fusing the many sides of his character into one very real whole.  It's the kind of top notch performance we've come to expect from Caine, and it makes his character and the film entirely credible.
When it comes to playing cockney, Caine may be the King, but Bob Hoskins is certainly the Crown Prince, coming in a close second.  These two, in fact, would clean up if the Oscars ever decided to include the categories of Best Cockney and Best Supporting Cockney.  There are times, perhaps, when you have to turn an ear in to understand what they're saying, but it's part of the charm and viability of their respective portrayals.  And Hoskins has an appeal all his own, and though he lacks Caine's charisma, he does have a definite screen presence, all of which helps to make the relationship between Ray and Jack believable.
The wonderful Helen Mirren, meanwhile, turns in a remarkably poignant performance as Amy.  Her portrayal readily brings the inner conflicts and complexities of her character to the fore, as Mirren successfully shows us the many sides of this woman, who is wife, lover and mother, all rolled into one.  Most importantly, her Amy is so human; there is an earthiness to her, but it is tempered by her more maternal and caring instincts, and it lends an honesty and integrity to the character that makes her very real.
Courtenay, Hemmings and Winstone turn in noteworthy performances, too, each making the utmost of the screen time they are afforded, successfully establishing their characters and the nature of their relationship with Jack as well as one another.  It's all a part of what makes ""Last Orders"" such entertaining and engaging cinema, a film that is both sincere and unforgettable.  And that's the magic of the movies.",1032912000,17,5686,4.681043129388165

1734476,5,B000069HQ3,"Prime British actors, Michael Caine, Helen Mirren, and Bob Hoskins, give us utterly believable characters in this intricate story about the mourners of Jack Dodds, a butcher from Bermondsey, London.
Jacks last orders come as a surprise to his family and friends, but nevertheless they respect his request and do him proud.  The lifelong drinking partners of Jack set out from their local pub to the seaside resort of Margate to carry out his final wishes  that his ashes be scattered from the end of the pier.
The friends, an ex-boxer, a car salesman, an undertaker, and a betting man, take his ashes on a day trip to Margate to do the honors, using a showroom Mercedes to send Jack off in style.  Along the way, they stop off at places significant in Jacks history and their own heritage, plus a few pubs, and reflect on their relationships with Jack and his family, and on their own decisions in life.
Meanwhile, back in London, his wife dwells with her own compromises and choices as she visits their severely disabled daughter, a girl Jack never could accept.
Last Orders is a poignant and mostly gentle story of the people who have surrounded Jack Dodds during his adult life.  The film is laced with flashbacks to earlier times and the long-ago causes of how their lives are inextricably tied together now.  The complexity of these interwoven lives highlights the humor, tolerance, and interdependence necessary for successful life long bonds of family and friends.
This movie deals with universal human questions regarding life, death, personal faults and strengths, and what it all means, all wrapped up in a package of superb acting and a wholly satisfying story.",1029542400,32,1672,4.873239436619718

This sort of film has been done before. Yet if you like this formula then it is a fairly well produced movie. It is mostly a series of flashbacks requiring two different sets of actors to cover the span of years. Much of the film is from a mock Mercedes with a rear projection screen. We do see some popular locations as backdrops to the story.

I was not that intrigued with Jacks history. However that are quite a few well know actors that make this watchable. Based on a Graham Swift novel ""Last Orders"", this would have made a better play than a movie.

1734522,5,B000069HQ3,"""Last Orders"" stars some great British film stars of the last forty years. Michael Caine stars as Jack, a family butcher who is dealing with the onset of cancer, and his desire to provide for his wife, Amy, played by Helen Mirren. He hopes that his horse-playing friend and ex-Army buddy, Ray(Bob Hoskins), can pick a big winner to secure some future for Amy. He also has asked Ray, his foster son Vince(Ray Winstone), and longtime friends Lenny & Vic(David Hemmings and Tom Courtenay) for one last favor, to toss his ashes off of Margate pier once he's gone, as he'd always wanted to buy Amy a little house there to retire to.
  ""Last Orders"" progresses back and forth, looking at the youth of the men. American actor JJ Field plays Jack in his 20's, and really resembles Michael Caine in his younger years. Kelly Reilly stars as the young Amy, when she and Jack meet while picking hops in Kent before the outbreak of WWII.
  The friendship, love, and hidden anger is really well brought out by the cast. Every week, Mirren's character, Amy, faithfully visits her and Jack's daughter, who is retarded and has been in a home since infancy, while Jack has never visited her. (Interestingly, Michael Caine's life paralleled ""Last Orders"": until 1989, he was unaware he had a half-brother, who was confined to a home near London. This brother, who suffered from epilepsy, caused brain damage to himself, and Caine's mother visited this brother every week until her death in 1989.)
  Vince(Winstone) was adopted by Ray and Amy after his family was killed during the Biltz, and has become estranged from Ray, but grudgingly agrees to bankroll Jack's attempt to win a nestegg for Amy. Vince and Lenny(Hemmings) have issues due to his getting Lenny's daughter pregnant, while Vic(Courtenay), an undertaker, attempts to modulate the conflicts between his friends.",1261872000,,1855,4.89171974522293
1734523,3,B000069HQ3,"Friends.  Not just ones that we occasionally see on the weekends, but those that buy you a round when they know you are blue, those that have lived their life right next to yours, those that will not quit even when you want them to forget about you - those are the friends that remain constantly in your mind.  In ""Last Orders"" we have a unique opportunity to see a group of four friends escape their lives to take one of their greatest friends (and family) to his final resting place.  Using a flashback technique that teeters on confusing at times, we witness six of our greatest actors dive deep into the hearts and souls of the characters they are portraying.  For once, in cinematic history, we see a story unfold that each and every one of the actors support, as well as contributes more than 100% to their respected roles.  This isn't a perfect film, but the flaws are overshadowed by the actors.  Each and every one of the actors in this film carried their weight (and then some) as we felt our heartstrings pulled and friendship refreshed.

As already mentioned, the acting in this film is superb.  It reminds me of discovering that perfect bottle of wine - all the characteristics of the blend are working in unison, creating a masterpiece out of what would be nothing more than than just your standard bottle of grapes.  The core of this film is bland.  ""Last Orders"" will not impress you with phenomenal storytelling or scenes that will demand your full attention - in fact - if it weren't for the actors who took their subsequent roles in this film - I probably would have fallen asleep shortly after the credits.  ""Last Orders"" is a dry film.  There is no denying that, but what sets the bar are the actors.  Michael Caine and Bob Hoskins give the performances of their careers in this little independent film that should have seen more attention..  Helen Mirren continues to prove that she is one of those diamonds in the rough when it comes to small roles.  She can handle either the big stuff or the small stuff, she continues to give her full ability each time.  The rest of the cast, Tom Courtenay and David Hemmings, make this group of friends even more thoughtful.  Then, there is Ray Winstone.  I have always appreciated his work since seeing him in ""Sexy Beast"", and this film just brought him to a whole new appreciative level.  He works, along with the rest of the players in this film, to ensure that their heart and minds are diving their characters into our hearts.  It is amazing that even with a weak script, this film was made better by those involved both behind the camera and in front of it.

With this applause for the actors, of which I can continue, but would sound like a repetitive critic, I must say that I wasn't impressed with the story.  I thought that director Fred Schepisi did a decent job with the imagery, long viewing landscapes accompanying our lush actors, but this story was a challenge to create as a screen writer.  Throughout his commentary, he talks about how he felt he had to guide the audience better through the flashbacks - there were quite a bit of them - but without giving us the proper guidance, we just jumped.  That was tough because we weren't fully introduced to the ""younger"" version of the characters with the respect that we were with the older generation.  At times we jumped with no reason, coupling our minds to be both confused as well as needing immediate readjustment to the situation.  One moment we were in a Mercedes driving, the next we were in a doctor's bed, the following we were in a war scene.  For the casual viewer, this would have been a difficult transition to follow.  For me, the jumps seemed too sporadic, too forced to push the story.  Unlike the book, each chapter isn't dedicated to each character, we must juggle the time, and I think Schepisi could have accomplished this task better.  He picked the right actors to play younger versions of their subsequent actors, but it took some time to make sure that we, the audience, knew who we were working with.  It was a struggle for this film, and it nearly - for me - took away from the phenomenal-ness of the actors.

There were other issues with this film with continuity and placement, some of which are typical in any budget of a film, but others occurred due in part to the constant change of time.  It is hard to change time as often as Schepisi does without missing some details, and again, it distracted in this film.  The pacing seemed lacking, I don't remember the book being as dull in some points, but I think it was because Schepisi didn't want to overload us with so much information.  The scene with the actors in the Mercedes as they drive to their friend's final destination was beautifully framed, amazingly acted, but seemed extended, dull, and a bit drawn out.  That, for me, best summarizes this film.  Acting and vision were impressively intense, but the film seemed to slip because of structural issues.

Overall, I liked this film, but could not say that I loved it.  I will stand behind ""Last Orders"" as a film that boasts the best acting from some of our most unique actors, but Schepisi could have done a better job behind the camera.  If it weren't for the actors, this film would have drastically fallen.  I am glad that our director pushed for great actors, but I think it is in part because he knew the story wasn't as strong as he wanted.  This was no ""Six Degrees of Separation"" or ""Roxanne"", it stands on its own - it just isn't sturdy enough.

1734524,3,B000069HQ3,"The novel was fascinating, but executing it on a big screen obviously was a huge challenge.  Both my spouse and I got lost when the film flashed far enough  back to change cast members.  Much of the quips were wonderful, dry British humor--and if I just kept up with them, it was fine.  It also helped to have read the book recently enough to make connections with the characters.",1180656000,,380,4.463768115942029
1734525,5,B000069HQ3,"What a beautiful film, with a marvelous ensemble cast.  Michael Caine (as ""Jack"") is brilliant and in a class by himself; and his love of acting is evident in each role he plays, always superbly.  And the addition of Helen Mirren (as his wife ""Amy"") brings together two of the world's finest actors, and worldwide treasures.  Bob Hoskins is always terrific, as is David Hemmings, and of course Ray Winstone (as Jack and Amy's son, ""Vince"").  It is so nice to see Tom Courtenay (first acclaimed in ""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"" and ""Doctor Zhivago""), as well as the lovely Kelly Reilly (as young Amy).

For those who love British films at their best, in contrast to crass American special-effects movies, this is well worth viewing.  The four men set out on a journey to honor Jack's final wishes; and it is moving in ways that are soft and tender, and beautiful.  Amy adds that special touch, both in her youth and the winter of her life.  Ah, to be a fly on the wall watching these great talents bring their magic to the silver screen--after waiting two and a half years for the money to make the film.

""Last Orders"" is also about a father and son, who pretend that they do not need each other, but who need and love one another very much, which is true of most fathers and their daughters too.  Also, right at the height of something--as director Fred Schepisi reminds us in the ""Special Features"" that are included on the disk--something goes wrong.  Or as John Lennon reminded us in prophetic words from his last album: ""[L]ife is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.""",1162166400,3,1609,4.571428571428571
1734546,3,B000069HQ3,"Fred Schepisi's film adaptation of Graham Swift's brisk novel about death and Britishness, or the death of Britishness, is a textbook case of how a bad script can stymie a brilliant cast.

The screen comes alive whenever Michael Caine's on it, even when he's in a hospital bed. But he's never on for more than a few minutes before a flashback sweeps you back to his disturbing younger double, or shifts to one of his four mates, all of whom have stories and flashbacks of their own that need to be crammed in. Despite all the cuts, the snippets themselves are amazingly static for a film--four men driving in a car, four men standing at a pub, a man and a woman sitting on a bench: that's about 80% of the screen time right there.

The characters seemed representative rather than real personalities: East Enders who fight in the War, bet on horses, run family butcher shops, go hopping of a summer, and mark their major life events down the local felt too pat, too pasteboard, to interest even the actors. London appears through a warm gauze of color and memory that doesn't really do justice to the personal histories the film sets out to tell. The cast is a Who's Who of the last 40 years of British cinema--I wish they'd been given more room to stretch out and pour their own histories into the characters.",1150675200,,1310,4.523206751054852

In the end, the little clues became the total sum of the movie.  It seemed that amid the peace and tranquility on the surface, there always seemed to be some ""dirty laundry"" or secrets that probably should remain as they were.  As best of mates, whilst some saw what they didn't mean to see, they were non-judgmental and took their friends as who they were.

We will watch countless ellipsis in different stages of his life: From the happy memories with his wife: the lovely Helen Mirren, his war stage in which he knew one of his more estimate friends, the birth of June and then the other birth conceived while he was in The War Front. But the love he had for his wife overcame the jealous to this last stage: the painful sickness and the last favor. To take his ashes to his beloved dock. All through the journey we can not forget two closed films around the friendship: An Italian film directed by Mario Monicelli named My friends and other Italian picture directed by Ettore Scola ""Cerovamo tanto amati"" ( We loved so much).

Anyway, a happy acknowledgement for Shepisi who directed this film with arresting inspiration. Canterbury Cathedral is true post card and a feast for your eyes.

Overwhelimg cast. Hopkins, Caine, Mirren and Couternay shine over the rest.",1118620800,,1265,4.668161434977579
1734549,3,B000069HQ3,"LAST ORDERS is the story of one man's life as told through the lives and stories of those who knew him best.  The cast in this film is absolutely terrific and the cinematography is gorgeous.  The lighting alone makes LAST ORDERS pleasing to look at.  Had I judged LAST ORDERS by the first hour, however, I would have been sadly disappointed.  The film takes quite a long time to get going, but once it does, it becomes something rather touching and memorable.

The plotline is one that will be familiar to most audiences.  Four gentlemen are brought together to carry out their friend's (Michael Caine) dying wish: to have his ashes scattered off the Margate Pier into the ocean.  The first hour of the film is a bit disorienting, as the audience has not a clue who these characters are.  But little by little, we begin to piece together the seemingly dead and anaesthetized present by examining the rich and vibrant past (aided by drastic color and lighting changes).  Inevitably, these old friends begin taking side trips, delaying their task more and more.  The time provides them not only a moment to reflect on their lost friend, but also on their lives, lives that have gone by so quickly with much left unsaid.  In fact, one of their detours is to visit Canterbury, rendering the end of the film into a bit of a pilgrimage of its own.

As LAST ORDER continues on into its second hour, the emotional impact of the film heightens and several of the scenes are rather heart-wrenching.  This is not the story of a perfect man gone before his time. It is the story about an ordinary man and those who loved him, their faults, their desires, and their collective journey along a small road in life.  I highly recommend it for a rainy, Sunday afternoon.",1114992000,4,1753,4.594855305466238
1734550,5,B000069HQ3,"Three friends who have known Jack Dodds, a butcher, for almost fifty years, along with Jack's son Vince, meet at their local South London pub carrying a box containing Jack's ashes.  Jack (Michael Caine) has died of heart failure, leaving a last request--that his ashes be cast off the Margate pier, several hours to the south of London.  Ray (Bob Hoskins), a gambler;  Vic (Tom Courtenay), an undertaker;  Lenny (David Hemmings), a former prizefighter and heavy drinker;  and Vince (Ray Winstone), Jack's son, a car dealer,  set off for Margate in a Mercedes Benz that Vince has borrowed to honor the occasion.

As the men drive south, they reminisce about Jack, joke around, sing songs, irritate each other, and even threaten each other in the emotion of the moment.  Director Fred Schepesi, who adapted the screenplay from the Booker Prize-winning novel by Graham Swift, alternates present scenes from the car with ironic scenes from Jack's life in the past, contrasting the deadness of the present trip to Margate with the liveliness of the past, showing the relationships among the various characters.  Jack's wife Amy (Helen Mirren) has chosen not to come with them for the ""ceremony.""  She is making her weekly visit to their mentally handicapped daughter June, now fifty, whom Jack has never accepted.

The nature of each man's relationship with Jack, with spouses and children, and with each other during World War II and after are all presented in flashback--from Vince's affair with Lenny's daughter, to Ray's relationship with Amy, and Jack's last minute bet with Ray to pay off a debt.  As the men's relationships evolve onscreen, the viewer recognizes that these are the kinds of relationships that ordinary men spend their lives developing.  The viewer comes to know not only Jack, but also the four men in the car heading south to scatter his ashes, and on a larger, universal scale, other men who have shared long friendships, jokes, and common experiences .

It is a tribute to the cinematography (Brian Trufano) that I didn't really notice it until the film was over--so apropos to the action and thematic development that it never called  attention to itself.  The original music (Paul Grabowsky) sets the scene at the beginning of the film but does not intrude on the character development or the interior action thoughout the film.  The sensational cast in this wonderful ensemble drama, the sensitive directing, the fully developed themes, and the overwhelming feeling that these characters and situations are real make this one of the best films I've seen in ages.

1734551,5,B000069HQ3,"Not only is the film bittersweet, but so is the watching of it for me. I've derived so much pleasure over the years from several of this excellent cast in superior films. Back to the early 1970s when Helen Mirren was a sassy girl in ""O Lucky Man,"" and later when she and Bob Hoskins were perfectly matched in ""The Long Good Friday."" Hoskins went on to other sterling work in ""The Dunera Boys"" and ""The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearn,"" and Mirren to fame and excellence in such as ""The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover.""

Way back, I go, with Tom Courtenay in ""Billy Liar,"" and through to his stunning and heartbreaking performance in ""The Dresser."" Michael Caine in so many things, of course, not the least of which was ""Educating Rita."" This is a good film, filled with pathos and tenderness. Thank goodness it is good enough to deserve a cast of this caliber. I hope it stimulates viewers to revisit some of their even greater works, as well as to make ""Last Orders"" part of their collections.",1095465600,,1002,4.475409836065574
1734552,4,B000069HQ3,"Looking for a sentimental Brit flick that leaves you feeling good?  Try LAST ORDERS with a stellar ensemble of favorite actors- Michael Caine, Helen Mirran, Bob Hoskins, David Hemmings and Tom Courtenay.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this tale of old friends who travel from their favorite pub in London to the Margate Pier to scatter the ashes of one of their group, Jack, who has made the request his `last orders' (phrase used when the bar is closing).  Using flashbacks, the Fred Schepisi, director of SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION, weaves a wonderful tale of one man's life as seen through the eyes of the friends and family who loved him.
Jack Dodd (Michale Caine) and Abby (Helen Mirran) were married for over 50 years. One of Jack's friends (Bob Hoskins) is a buddy from his WWII days who made his fortune playing the horses. Another (David Hemmings), is an ex-prize fighter. Yet another (Tom Cortenay), is an undertaker who began his career of tending to the dead during the war. Their son (Ray Winstone) is a successful Mercedes-Benz dealer who makes a good deal more money than his dad who never recovered from the fact his son would not join him in the family meat business.
On the trip to Margate Pier, each friend and family member recalls Jack, whose ashes are to be taken to the seaside place he and Abby visited years earlier. Each of them remembers a charming  vignette that took place with Jack in London, southern England (Kent County) and/or the Middle East at some point during the last 50 years of the 20th century. This film is a must for the dedicated Anglophile and those nostalgic for past times. The transfer of the film is excellent and the beautiful shots include visits to a WWII memorial in Kent, Canterbury Cathedral, and Margate Pier which is really a sort of paved boardwalk (""the jetty washed away years ago"").",1088985600,3,1849,4.697530864197531

7965798,5,B000069HQ3,"This stellar ensemble cast under the directorship of Fred Shepisi hits the metaphorical jackpot in this story of long-time mates disposing of one of their own's ashes. Warmth, humanity, humor et al. permeate the atmosphere of this realistic, yet sensitive story.

To me, Mr. Hoskins' role stands out just a tad from the rest, as he is, in no small part, the main facilitator in this film: he always seems to be in the right place at the proper time, especially at the track! Although not in the boys' club of disposing of the ashes, Helen Mirren's role here is more subtle and indirect, yet crucial as the deceased's (Michael Caine) wife who opts not to go along with the boys for the final ride. Her understated yet forceful portrayal here is one of her finer pieces of work, especially noted in her scenes with her mentally challenged daughter. M. Caine is his usual cad self, somewhat like an aged ""Alfie"" who likes his bantering with the birds at the pub (and at the hospital!), but unlike ""Alfie"", he won't make plays for them! The rest of the group of the boys carrying out the ""Last Orders"" provide more than ample thespian talent, not only in their individual roles, but also in how each relates to the group as a whole. The cast of the ""flashback"" scenes of yore does equally well in laying out the dramatic foundation for the modern day sequences.

Some say the total is greater than the sum of the individual parts, especially when dealing with the synergy of talents and overall heart as manifested in this production. It's all about heart, baby, and there's plenty here to go around. Cheers!",1425168000,,1604,4.624561403508772
