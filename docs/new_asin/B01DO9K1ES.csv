8756490,2,B01DO9K1ES,I didn't realize this would be on Aristotle's teachings. I didn't do the course once I saw this on the package. Just not what I was hoping for.,1483488000,,143,4.142857142857143

8756492,5,B01DO9K1ES,"Very well done.  The professor is extraordinarily clear; he has good vocal modulation and gestures--and he even tells a few jokes.  The graphics, and especially the proofs, are exceptional.  I watched four lectures per day, so it took 6 days to complete the course.  First Order Predicate Logic is described quite completely, together with modal logic and fuzzy logic at the end.  Just a couple of minor quibbles:  1)  the inclusive or is described, but not the exclusive or (xor), although an equivalent form is given.  2)  no mention is made of software to help logicians, such as theorem provers (including ""Expert Thinker,"" a software package I developed in 1988).  Most of us in the ""real world"" translate natural English to clause form, and it's also possible to translate predicate logic to clause form automatically.  (However, I do not know of any software which can directly translate spoken or written English directly to predicate logic or clause form.)  Regardless of my minor quibbles, I highly recommend this course.",1471478400,,1031,5.071428571428571
8756493,5,B01DO9K1ES,"This is another one of the great courses from the Teaching Company. I love these courses because they make the knowledge of some of America's top professors so accessible to the general public. As for this logic course, it's not super difficult. Definitely it is accessible to most beginners in the area. I've had some experience with logic before, and I found it quite accessible. I recommend it as a good supplemental resource for people who are struggling with their logic class in school or who just want to brush up on their critical reasoning.",1464739200,,549,4.7894736842105265
8756494,5,B01DO9K1ES,"A must for homeschooling children. Really it doesn't get better than this. For our children watching
television is a privilege that must be earned. However, the content of television that our children watch
worries us. This is not only educational and visually stunning, it teaches both our children and us at the same
time. A great buy!
I have received a dc for this review.",1464048000,,375,4.7846153846153845
8756495,4,B01DO9K1ES,"This is a course in what the instructor calls ""intellectual self-defense"", meaning part of the objective is to help the learner better discern what is rational and true. I enjoyed Dr. Gimbel's dry sense of humor. He throws in some pretty clever one-liners here and there. The content is carefully presented, one point building on another, and therefore making what might be overwhelming into something very understandable, yet not in the least ""dumbed down"". There is about 12 hours of content broken into 24 lessons. The included paperback ""text"" well summarizes the lessons and provides additional resources. I've purchased DVDs from The Great Courses in the past and have always been pleased. The content was perhaps not as engaging as some of the other courses I've watched (photography, drawing, writing) however that is a personal bias. I was fortunate to receive this particular course at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I depend on reviews to inform my own purchases and will always leave sincere ones, good or bad.",1463443200,3,1049,5.069364161849711
8756496,4,B01DO9K1ES,"I will start by saying I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I enjoyed this course more than I expected and it ended up being viewed by my husband and two home-schooled children as well. It was certainly more appropriate material for my high school aged son- but my 9 year old got more out of it than expected. I'm very curious to see what his response will be when he reviews it again in several years. This is a wonderful resource, though I have to note that I wouldn't have been able to afford it at the regular price. We enjoyed reviewing the course book before watching each segment and I feel this material was well organised and well presented. Thank you so much.",1463097600,,701,4.358778625954199
8756497,5,B01DO9K1ES,"I will admit to some bias when reviewing this product. I have used and loved The Great Courses for homeschooling my teenagers and continuing my own education, so we where already fans of this company before I ordered this. The information and courses have given my teens the knowledge they need to enter college early and test out of Biology and 2 American History courses. The really amazing thing is that my husband and I find ourselves buying for us and learning about things in depth from experts in their fields. It's a lot like sitting in a college class with a passionate professor. You learn just from their passion for their subjects. It's broken up in to bite size 24-30 minute lectures, giving you a chance to really learn and understand the material. The course book included with this is invaluable. I purchased this particular title for me, but my husband and 15 year old are watching it with me and its sparked some great conversations! I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review. I have and will continue to pay for the great courses for years to come. They are top notch and this title is no exception.",1462752000,2,1147,4.6
