1238617,5,B00000JSIP,"How tragic and disastrous that the DVD is only available used and for $160 dollars! That's more than Pasolini's Salo! This is a great little strange film and the words Oscar Wilde gives to Salome to try to seduce John the Baptist are some of the most wonderful lines ever written. Wilde's play makes so much of the scene that when I first saw this film in my early 20s, I decided to look up the passage in the Bible to see what really happened. The Bible passage as I remember was only a sentence long! So thank you to Oscar Wilde for elaborating on that historical event in such a lovely way. I loved the Moon too. Needs to be re-issued though so I can afford it.",1095552000,,664,4.1953125
1238618,5,B00000JSIP,"I have been wating for close to 5 years to have this movie come ut on a medium that is affordable.  For the longest of time the VHS version was close to $80.00.  Now that it is on DVD we can apreciate this film for less ...
  To say the least this is an excellent version of Oscar Wilde's Salome.  If you want to understand Wilde and his plays, you should pick this film up.  Not many people realize but Wilde and his friends would write plays and then act them out for fun.  So when you see this movie you are getting a pretty good view of what a Friday night was for Wilde and his friends.
  I mean to say,  wouldn't it be fun to write a porn and have your friends act it out with you as the star?  That was what Wilde did, that was why he was so controversial.
  But like I said, if you are a theatre major or even a fan of literature and history.  Watch this film and be amazed.",1014768000,13,882,3.8820224719101124
1238619,4,B00000JSIP,"Rather than film Oscar Wilde's play, Salome, as a stand-alone piece, Ken Russell uses the time-honored  technique of a play within a play, to present a fictional British premier of the play considered so decadent, the Lord Chamberlain banned it from the stage.  Wilde did not see a production of Salome in his lifetime.  In Mr. Russell's film,  the guests and employees of Alfred Taylor's brothel present a fully staged performance of Salome for Wilde as a birthday present.
Within this concept, Russell has each actor, except Wilde, play two parts in the film, one in the brothel, one in the play.  Most remarkable of these is Imogen Millais-Scott who, the first time we see her, is a very timid, slightly stuttering maid, but who, in the play within the play, is none other than the seductive princess Salome.  Besides having an intriguing face that can look thirteen one minute and sixty the next, she has a melodious, slightly odd speaking voice and intense line delivery.
Nicholas Grace is the sensuous, slightly debauched Oscar Wilde, Glenda Jackson commands the stage as a dissipated, but regal queen Herodias/Lady Alice, and Stratford Johns gives a detailed characterization as Herod/Alfred Taylor (the owner of the brothel).  Russell himself appears with a fairly sizeable spoken role.
There are only two extra features on this DVD: the inevitable trailers (not particularly interesting) and a commentary by the director Ken Russell which is both fascinating and enlightening.  Mr. Russell readily describes his creative process, explains some of the choices he made in the film, and relates a few interesting anecdotes about the actors, all the while dropping bits of information about the music he chose for the film and why.
This is not an appropriate film for children.  It contains nudity, some crude gestures, and sexual situations.",1006905600,46,1847,5.1096345514950166
1238620,5,B00000JSIP,"Much is made of risque film director's, loathe them or love them they are the ones mainstream Hollywood hacks very often ""borrow"" heavily from. And in doing so receive undo praise for innovention. Ken Russell is innovention personified! Like Cronenberg, Lynch and Alan Parker, he isn't afraid to takes the risks nessessary to make a highly provacative and compelling film. Salome's Last Dance is innovative, provacative, literate and well acted; brilliantly lensed on a miniscule budget (probably the budget of Spielberg's hair products durring one of his productions). Much praise to the lead actress, who's performance is nothing short of amazing! Grace as Wilde is particularly underappreciated in a subtle, yet alarmingly perverse performance that gives Stephen Fry's (in a different film) a run for his Wilde money. Odd, but sincere; bizarre, yet unique; I highly recommend t his rarely seen little gem!!!",989625600,8,910,5.370629370629371
1238621,5,B00000JSIP,"Nicely done version of the Oscar Wilde play.  Unlike Russell's film of THE BOY FRIEND, which drowned straightforward source material in an ocean of pastiche and camp, the framing device here (a private performance of Wilde's play in a brothel on the night of his arrest) actually illumines, rather than obscures, the text.  Nickolas Grace as Oscar himself is something of a nonstarter, but most of the cast rise (or sink) to the occasion; pleasant to see flashes of wit again from the usually sullen Glenda Jackson.  Good design, and a marvelous performance from Imogen Millais-Scott, looking like the love child of Joan Greenwood and Quentin Crisp in the title role.  Would make an interesting double-feature with Nazimova's notorious silent film.",982281600,3,748,5.1570247933884295
1238622,4,B00000JSIP,"Salome's Last Dance is a bizarre, yet well-acted film that mixes a campy performance of Oscar Wilde's French-decadent play, witty in-joke quotes, and a nose-tweaking of history, to eventually create a film that while may turn off many with its strangeness, is an interesting homage to the play's author and the period. The performances are wonderful, especially Glenda Jackson's Herodias and Imogen Millais-Scott as Salome.  I was a little disappointed in Nickolas Grace's Oscar Wilde, though.  He tries, but he's just no Stephen Fry, and his performance lacks a certain spark.  The other actors seem equally at home in the forums of period piece and camp drama, and although seemingly done on a low-budget, the film looks great.  I would recommend this to any Oscar Wilde fan, as well as anyone who enjoys just plain strange movies.",973036800,7,833,5.0583941605839415

1238625,3,B00000JSIP,"Ken Russell is kind of like stinky blue cheese:  you either like him or you don't.  If you like him, Salome is an essential work to add to your collection.
Russell tends to hit you over the head with his hidden  meanings, and this is one of the few films where he decides to let the  images do the work for him, mostly by sticking close to the text of Wilde's  original play.  This is to his credit.  The production design is lush, the  photography surprisingly brisk, although his camera movements (as always)  are just plain amateurish.
Imogen Millais-Scott turns in an astonishing  and bracing performance as Salome (interestingly, she never worked in film  again) and Nicholas Grace (Brideshead Revisited) turns in a somewhat boring  Oscar Wilde.

I had hoped for something a bit more 'mainstream', but it was roughly about Oscar Wilde's decadence and philandering complete with his persuasions.  I had hoped for a bit more of the writer's comedic talents; there were brief moments and, rightfully so, it was more about Salome.

However,the language is stunning; Oscar Wilde is a master of words.  The play is presented as a play within a play and that allows the viewer to distance him/herself from the very wicked things going on.  Salome's lengthy description of her passion for John the Baptist is amazing.  The somewhat ""moral"" ending was probably a sop to the critics and/or the audience.  Yes, have your unholy fun, but there will be a price. Good acting, but Wilde's words are the star of this movie.

The play portrays the corrupt household of Herod who imprisoned John the Baptist and Herodius played by Glenda Jackson.
Herod, the Tetrarch of Judea, was a corpulent self-obsessed hedonist who married his brother's wife Herodius.
To amplify the corruption of this household, most of the actors wore a minimum of costume--indeed many appeared topless.

I will readily admit that I reached for the remote a couple of times because I was misinterpreting what I was seeing on the screen. This is a production of Wilde's play -- a play that Wilde had never seen produced in his lifetime. To add to the oddity, it is staged in a brothel. In the context of this, the actors are phenomenal! I especially adored Imogen Millais-Scott, who plays both a very timid maid in the brothel and Salome on stage. She is a total delight. This is a film you have to watch, not run in the background while doing other things.

Don't waste time questioning whether this truly represents Russell's oeuvre, or whether it is faithful to Wilde's play  - this is definitely not an intellectual exercise.

1238654,4,B00000JSIP,Nearly a word-for-word reflection of Oscar Wilde's play from almost a century earlier.  Ken Russell's take on this Bible story is framed by his own original narrative that has Wilde and his lover arriving late at a friend's brothel where they are surprised by a staging of his own play that has just been banned in Britain.  An oddity that still rankles and provokes with its overt sexuality and sometimes striking imagery.,1323561600,,423,4.861111111111111
1238655,3,B00000JSIP,"This review is of ""L'Ultima Salome"" Eagle/Vestron's Italian edition of Ken Russell's ""Salome's Last Dance.""  Firstly, I have never had much luck with the Italian product, except glorious Criterion versions of Fellini and a Reg. 2 copy of Fellini's ""Casanova"" which was otherwise not available.  All of the Vittorio DeSica work I own in my collection is in poorly presented DVD editions.  But when Eagle Pictures takes a very British scandalous Ken Russell masterpiece from 1988 and presents it in a very soft, not crisp presentation, one realizes they were not given top quality work and that they have to look elsewhere for that quality.  You can select the film in English without subtitles, but Eagle had to stamp the ""L'Ultima Salome"" title as a subtitle on this otherwise clean copy of the film.  But the film is so soft it doesn't look digitized.  (The Spanish edition of ""Forever Amber"" was beautiful).  Although this is not a complete washout as a DVD purchase, it will suffice until Vestron Pictures, the original releasing studio, can manufacture another more crisp edition at reasonable prices, preferably in Reg. 1.  And for a film like ""Salome's Last Dance"" one needs to clearly see what is going on in the film, and can not be content with a sloppy presentation.  So keep up the hope that an American version can be produced soon.  The acting, writing, direction, especially Imogen Millais Scott as ""Salome"" are knockouts.

In my humble view, Ken Russel was a genius to thumb his nose at the critics for his masterful portrayal of the play ""Salome"" and I believe if Oscar Wilde had had the ability to get past Victorian morality this would have been the film he would have made. With shocking yet theatrical effects, it captures the mysterious and intriguing mood of the play, pouring drama and light and magic. Hopefully,the Koreans will get on this soon and have the film for sale under 10.00$ soon so the rest of you don't have to suffer through those wanting to sell you this film for over 50.00$",1261440000,2,779,4.454545454545454

Luckily, as with all technology, there are work-arounds. For those so inclined, there are ways to make this DVD function in America (or anywhere else), whether it be by purchasing a region-free DVD player, buying a cheapo DVD player and resetting its region to your region of choice (some even allow you up to three changes before locking permanently), or by transforming this Region 2 disc into something a bit more Region 1 friendly (And by the way, to those who want to know, the disc has only 4.19GB on it). Finally, you could try to find a region-free DVD player for your PC, although this may be a bit harder to do.

You can turn off the Italian subtitles, and watch it with the original English soundtrack. Except for the menus, region, and packaging, this is pretty much the same as the out-of-print Region 1 DVD release (in PAL format, of course, but that can also be dealt with).

Until the Region 1 distributors get their heads out of their butts, this is the only choice for anyone to watch this classic. Get it, even if you have to skirt the standard rules a bit. Oscar Wilde would agree.

Wilde wrote the play not as the supposed love poem that some ""scholars"" suggest, but instead as a parody of the melodrama popular at the time.  Salome was the first camp classic and now Ken Russel allows us to experience as it was meant to be seen.

Later Richard Strauss would turn Wilde's work into the odd sort of psychological drama of his opera.  And if that's what you want to see buy a version of the opera, don't try to force the play to become it.  Allow for the play to be what it is.

A very fun movie and campy isn't the only thing this movie is, its very irreverent in the best sense of the word, a most cheesy morsel of goods.  I love the words in this play and frankly think the director was a genius with the physical counterpoint to the language of the play.  I'm sure Wilde wrote the play

""straight"".  As a matter of fact he even acted in Salome & he played Salome, so maybe I'm wrong & he didn't write it ""straight"".

This film is sensationalist, yet boring--it attempts to follow in the steps of Jarmann, but is not nearly so inventive.

The person playing Salome was horrible, reducing her wonderfully paradoxical character in Wilde's play to nothing more than a Lolita knock-off with an oral fixation, with only one tone of voice for all of her lines.

Most of the sequences actually relating to Oscar Wilde were historically wrong--which could be borne easily enough--but also unimaginatively vulgar, and demeaning--which cannot.  I wouldn't be surprised if the take on Wilde and his circle portrayed here was based in large part on ""Teleny""--an ""erotic novel"" (I use both terms loosely) that has popularly been attributed to him, but which was most likely a simple (and poor) imitation of his style.

""The Trial of Salom&eacute; v. Wilde""____________________________>

Of all Glory authored by He in His trade,

No Beast of His likeness was properly made.

He fashioned from filings of immaculate grade,

His image, now mortal, and divinely portrayed.

From none He made one, and one into two,

The former, his function: the latter he'd woo.

One painted steadfast, built pious and true,

The other made lesser; of curious hue.

~

And she, insufficient, made minor a match,

For pomiferous persuasions from saurian Scratch.

""Behold! censored produce; sworn not to detach,""

Made ever more eager by Satanic dispatch.

That dame of fair beauty but runty resolve,

Resigned all resistance; let duty dissolve.

With proud mastication at once did devolve,

The grace and the virtue 'round each did revolve.

~ ~

So Adam, fell even, with whom he shared birth,

A guilt by relation had sullied his worth.

An exile from Eden, that Heaven on earth,

Our hero, now tainted, was cast from His mirth.

If blame is commissioned, and one falls to scorn,

Spare our true hero - from virtue was torn;

The blanche of perversion is hers to adorn,

Discolored devotion takes feminine form.

~

In honor of insults to masculine pride,

A host of harsh harlots have sought to misguide.

Since Eden's ejection, our faith she's defied,

It's fashioned in fables, and utters our slide.

With malice aforethought and sex her device,

A girl from Judaea draws violence from vice.

A jig in her skivvies had precious a price,

And bound by his honor, her wish, he'd suffice.

~ ~

A tart! A tyrannous! Through ages the scream,

Aptly termed wicked or so it would seem.

But truth of her purpose shall raise her esteem,

Amending the matter and favor, redeem.

Now poesy relinquish; with text, thus begin,

Descriptions of lust and of female sin.

This frequent of fables and subject of stage,

Forthwith shall it follow on subsequent page.

A great vehicle for Ken Russell, who in a surreal touch actually appears in the film as a photographer taking ""snaps"" of the performance. Dirty pictures? I thought all the cast - a veritable clutch of British luvvies including a Stratford Johns in sparkling form and a rather subdued (I thought) Glenda Jackson - entered playfully into this imaginary amateur private performance of the Wilde play (originally in French and performed there) characteristically banned by the Lord Chamberlain. Fans of ITV's ""Benidorm"" the British TV comedy series will recognise Kenny Ireland in his more salad - but equally plump - days as one of Herod's palace guards.

Ken is alive to the panto aspects of the Wilde play which in its operatic reincarnation, typical of Germanic humourless sang froid, were largely stripped out by Richard Strauss, though some of Strausss music is used in the soundtrack  (how could it be avoided?) there are also judicious snatches of Debussy and others. After all Russell was an avid classical music collector and connoisseur.

The most remarkable thing here is the sheer wit and elegance of Salome the play, which by directly setting the spoken text against this music proves two things. Secondly, something I have long thought, that Wilde's play, with substantial cuts, was the finest libretto Strauss ever worked with. And first and mainly, Salome is one of the greatest prose poems in the English language. A fact which has been more or less overshadowed by its musical adaptation and shortening.

The two key actors here are Nikolas Grace who is superb as Wilde and Imogen Millais-Scott as Salome. A virtual unknown at the time of casting I think she gives us a remarkable performance that is the consummate femme fatale who surprises even her loathsome mother, Herodias (Glenda Jackson) and the demi-monde provenance of her real life below stairs character as one of Stratford Johns/Taylors maids propelled into the starring role, exactly captures the late Victorian world Wilde moved in with its shadiness and secretive liaisons. I thought this was Salome in a nutshell.

Ken Russell is in top form here  notice the very last shot as the hapless Wilde and Taylor are carried off into the arms of the law (and the philistines) in the police carriage disappearing down the street   the camera pans down behind the black London railings giving a premonition of jail time!

This is a highly enjoyable Russell film that should be considered as a very educated view of the subject of the original play which has been rather smothered and diminished by its less than subtle operatic adaptation, and grouped with his discursive works on classical composers and classical music and NOT compared with his more substantial films such as Women in Love and The Devils.

One very artistic English film director paying tribute to what has evolved into an iconic work for the opera stage and the genius of Oscar Wilde. There is every reason to believe Oscar would have approved.",1491782400,2,3044,4.98422090729783

Presented as if Oscar Wilde's favored brothel keeper had staged it for him as a birthday present.  As with mah durn Netherlands, San Franciscan, and Boston clergy orientations, Wilde was presented as favoring homosexual relations rather than what was referred to as ""the missionary position"" with persons of complementary gender.  That it was all presented as occurring nine years prior to the end of the reign of the grotesquely antisexual Queen Victoria was demonstrated by the arrest of key players at the end of the film.",1476230400,,646,5.313725490196078
