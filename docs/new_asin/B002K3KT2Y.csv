8611810,5,B002K3KT2Y,"Laurie York and Carmen Goodyear's most recent documentary, ""A Passion For Rhododendrons"" is an incredible piece of filmmaking. I have lived among these magnificent rhododendrons for the past five years, but I don't think I truly appreciated their beauty, their simplicity, their complexity or their rarity until experiencing this film.

Now that I'm a steward to three dozen of these incredible plants on this acre on Mendocino coastline, in so many ways ""A Passion"" helped me understand not only how to take care of the wild things, but also why it is important to. The directors' affiliation with the Mendocino Botanical Gardens served only to solidify the legitimacy of team York/Goodyear.

The notion of hybridizing and cloning were well represented. Who knew that with such care and attention that hybrids so beautiful could be created by humans?

A huge ""don't miss"" factor of this film is the score, provided by Joel Hoekstra. His ""13 Acoustic Songs"" recording was well represented within the film, providing a moving and inspirational audio background for an already exquisite tapestry of visuals. (see cdbaby.com for more information)

I have so loved this film that I've launched my copy across the country on a trek to share with friends and family. I promise you will not regret ""A Passion For Rhododendrons""--these flowers do occur here in the wilds of California's Mendocino County. And when jogging along a side road and coming across a 20 foot tall rhodie in full bloom, one can't help but stop, take a big step back and celebrate the natural beauty this planet has to share with us.",1272585600,2,1599,5.0
