2524440,4,B000ENUL84,"While this DVD only contains snippets of performance videos and songs, it is billed as a documentary, not a video collection. Excellent and lengthy interviews are conducted with some key members of various incarnations of the Magic Band - John French, Mark Boston, Jeff Morris Tepper, Elliot Ingber, Ira Ingber, Jerry Handley, Doug Moon, Gary Marker, Eric Drew Feldman, Gary Lucas - as well as notable others - Beefheart biographer extraordinaire Mike Barnes for example (if you've not read his book ""Captain Beefheart"", get to it, skippy). Most notably, the makers of the film seem to really understand and attempt to communicate the importance and depth of Van Vliet's effect on rock music of the 20th Century. This combination of in-depth interviews and passion for the subject more than make up for the lack of performance material included. While I was disappointed that such an integral band member as Bill Harkleroad (Zoot Horn Rollo) apparently declined to be involved, no one should be too surprised that the Captain himself is nowhere to be found in the interviews except as a subject. Van Vliet has long since disappeared from public life - so much so that rumors of ill-health and a noted use of the past-tense in reference to him from ex-band members is common. Of course, Van Vliet still remains elusive and, yes, it would be easy to make a twelve-hour documentary regarding this amzing, confounding, enigma of an artist but in light of the other DVDs out there about Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band (Hello? Bueller?), this item is a welcome edition to my video library - and will be to yours as well.",1146355200,5,1620,4.8731884057971016
2524441,2,B000ENUL84,"You know, I got this DVD thinking maybe I'll get to see some ""rare musical performances never before available on DVD"" as they printed on the back cover. They only play a piece of these videos. So if you are looking to see some footage of the band performing at least 1 song in it's entirety this isn't the one for you. I did enjoy the interviews w/ past band members and their insight to the songs and albums. I only wish if they couldn't get Beefheart himself for an interview couldn't they find some old footage of him talking about some of these great albums.
This isn't a DVD that I will play often. It's a shame. I think the Captain would be disappointed w/ the DVD.",1146268800,17,672,4.2578125
2524442,2,B000ENUL84,"This DVD was quite disappointing. None of the musical footage is presented in its entirety, and sometimes people are talking over the music.  Also, even though a good number of Magic Band members are interviewed and a good number of anecdotes are provided, the interviews frequently contain such insights as, ""It did what it did"" (Elliot Ingber commenting on ""Alice in Blunderland"" solo).
In addition, the manner of interviewing people is really tacky: John French on a telephone in a tree, Eric Drew Feldman in a toy truck, Elliot Ingber in a parked car, Gary Lucas in bed with some weird blue nightlight.  This method of marketing the Magic Band as freaks just detracts from the content of the interviews. Overall, the production is gimmicky, with annoying graphics for each band member that go on far too long.  The opening image is just so tasteless, and really says it all about this DVD: the Captain's voice issuing from a doll's head.
Yet, the biggest problem is that there is simply too much talking and too little music. I found the DVD to be actually kind of boring, with many of the interview segments going on far too long.
So, I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this film, but rather to seek out a bootleg copy of the vastly superior BBC documentary ""The Artist Formerly Known as Captain Beefheart"" as well as a bootleg disc of actual live footage of the Captain and his Magic Bands.",1146268800,39,1393,4.677551020408163
2524443,3,B000ENUL84,"I feel I had to redo this review since I found myself watching this twice. The main problem is like many people said and the first thing I thought when I saw this DVD was, they show classic performance footage but have talking over it or show only half of the footage. Major disappointment because you get the feeling this could very well be the last word on Captain Beefheart. Any old footage will go into a vault and stay there. It is true that younger generations (hell I'm 24 myself) will continue to discover Beefheart but as the older people who were there move further away from the experience so much material is going to get lost forever. Makes ME want to get up and do something about it. Me and a friend had an idea of tracking down Don himself to see what he's up to but have heard many times that its not a good idea. Don's had 20 plus years to come back to say something or at least write some liner notes. Its heart breaking he doesn't hold his musical legacy with any regard whatsoever.

This DVD, despite its obvious flaws is exactly what it says it is, a critical review. Band members and a handful of music critics tell a basic story of Captain Beefheart and His (the) Magic Band and its pretty interesting stuff. If you give it a chance you'll find it pretty rewarding and far more interesting than any crap you'll see on TV. My only thing is there is just one side to it most, I was dismayed to hear bad words about Clear Spot and Spotlight Kid, two of Beefhearts most refined albums. The two BAD albums are rightfully torn apart and the last 3 albums are great no matter what is said on this DVD. But it is what it says it is, a critical overview. It just could have used some more perspective of say some modern critics or more recent musicians, hell, talk to Tom Waits, or Mike Watt for that matter. I feel alot of the critics are just too negative. Anyways, read the other reviews and decide for yourself if you think its worth spending money on, I bought this two years ago and hated it, the last week I watched it twice and found it interesting and entertaining but not ultimately satisfying.",1199664000,4,2119,4.31077694235589
2524444,2,B000ENUL84,"This DVD is mostly music critics analyzing various Beefheart albums. Some of the biographical material is interesting. The performances aren't. You'd be better off getting a copy of the excellent BBC documentary.  A bootleg called ""Portable People"" has that documentary plus some nice live footage.",1174262400,3,298,5.622222222222222
2524445,4,B000ENUL84,"I live and grew up in and around Los Angeles, and I've been a Beefheart fan since the early '70s.  I've seen him live several times and bought every album.  I've read Harkleroad's book.  I've taped a couple of interviews with him off broadcast TV.  I've also seen a limited amount of video footage of the band, and most of it was pretty poor quality.  I happened to catch the brief TV commercial that aired once in LA (channel 13? or was it 9) in the '70s, could hardly believe it, but now I have proof as it is shown in the documentary.  While as other reviewers have stated, it's unfortunate that the videos used in this documentary are not shown in their entirety, I was somewhat amazed that 1) there was as much Beefheart video that I had never seen, and 2) that the quality of it was often pretty good compared to what I have seen.  Most of the video is from European TV programs, but there's even early footage of Safe As Milk tunes and even Diddy Wah Diddy.  What's shown here is therefore the tip of the iceberg which gives a fan like me hope that someday it will be collected and released in its entirety.

But the fact the music is excerpted does not diminish the value of this documentary.  Beefheart made it higher up in the charts in Europe than in the US, and had a significant following there.  This UK based documentary is just shy of 2 hours long and is primarily interviews with ex-band members recounting various aspects of their experiences in the band, and interviews with music critics who had followed Beefheart through his various stages.  Each Beefheart album is presented in turn and discussed by both musicians and critics and provides considerable insight into the workings of the various versions of the band.  Essential for any serious fan, or those curious about the phenomena.  And while there are significant excerpts of songs, presenting entire songs is not the purpose of this documentary-- though it may help you to choose which album(s) to buy if you are new to Beefheart.

One thing about Beefheart that there can be no disagreement about, is that he is one of a kind.  But largely because of that he will likely never be mainstream enough to inspire big-budget documentary producers to produce something that would be acceptable on US television that could be more than about 5 minutes long.  The quality of this documentary is not bad, all things considered, and in my opinion is well worth the relatively low price.  On the other hand, skip the ""Low Yo Yo Stuff"" DVD, as that has very little to offer.",1172620800,4,2542,4.561674008810573
2524446,4,B000ENUL84,"This DVD is a review of Beefheart's career, album by album. For what it is, it's very good. No, it isn't a concert, nor does it purport to be. The rare live clips are excellent and hopefully someday they can be compiled, uniterrupted into a DVD collection. Look at this as an audio book with snippets of tasty music. There is so little available on Beefheart on DVD if you don't have access to BBC documentaries or bootleg live films. So the 2 hour length didn't bore me at all. It just made me want to listen to Clear Spot and find a record player to crank up my copy of Lick My Decals Off, Baby! The only thing the critics missed was how much of an influence the guitar on Alice in Blunderland had on Tom Verlaine and Television.",1168473600,6,731,4.228571428571429
2524447,4,B000ENUL84,"While others have harped about there not being long enough concert clips, we enjoyed the clips and the general flow of this documentary.  If the makers were to show us all the footage of every concert, then there would be no time left for the documentary.  It would merely be a concert DVD.  And if that's what you're looking for, by all means, put up your petitions to the powers that be.

But we loved learning more about the magic band members and seeing how time has ravaged or been good to them.  Their tales of behind-the-scenes goings-on were very interesting.  We also loved finding out where the next interviewee would be perched/lurking/hiding/sipping...

I recommend this DVD to all Beefheart fans and collectors.  It's just fun.",1168473600,4,740,4.817460317460317
2524448,5,B000ENUL84,"Most of the complaints among reviewers here are that the performances are not long enough. Well, this is a documentary, folks, and that is the way documentaries are made. Documentaries almost never contain complete performances, go watch some and see for yourself.

This is a relatively low budget documentary about a guy who is surrounded in controversy, who would not cooperate in the making of it, and whose bandmembers also did not all participate. So getting footage was not easy and getting interviews and info was limited. Combine that with the low budget, and I think the documentary makers did a very good job here!

First of all, unless you are a hard-core collector, this dvd has quite a bit of rare footage, and a lot of info and opinions I had not heard before.

It moves well, you don't get bored because they include snippets of music every so often, and yes, that is what music is for in a documentary. Okay, I agree, they could have left some of the performances a little longer, but for me it was about the Information, not the music. I have enough Beefheart music in my collection. This is a good overview of Beefheart and his rise to fame and his going into (intentional) obsurity.

I am one of the world's original Beefheart fans, having bought Trout Mask the day it came out, (okay, I know some of you were around since Safe As Milk, but still, Trout is early...), and I consider him one of the world's living musical geniuses.

I enjoyed this documentary and am glad I bought it. It's all we have unless someone comes along with more money to spend on one, and gets Don's cooperation. Unlikely.

Some day you will see a documentary about Don Van Vliet, the PAINTER, as his fame and respect in the art world grows. Chances are it won't be until after he dies. So enjoy this for now.

Meanwhile, go to youtube and beefheart dot com and find all kinds of rare footage and music.",1159920000,24,1898,4.51603498542274
2524449,3,B000ENUL84,"What keeps this from being a great documentary is simply some poor editing decisions.  Throughout the almost two hours-long program, the viewer is teased by scenes of Capt. Beefheart and His Magic Band performing - odd promos, concert snippets, and TV performances from the A&M Sessions/Safe as Milk era, all the way to Ice Cream for Crow time.  But every time one of these cool-looking clips appears on the screen, and just as you're settling in to enjoy it, someone starts talking over it and the camera cuts away to an interview segment.  Ouch.  But the interviews themselves are quite enjoyable.  Various members of the Magic Band, Beefheart's biographer, music journalists Alan Clayson and Nigel Williamson, et al, all offer interesting insights into the career of the Captain.  The musicians are upfront in describing both how wonderful and how impossible it could be to work with Beefheart, the analysts don't mind telling you awful they thought some of the records were, while also wildly praising some of the other records.  If the performances had been left to play through, and had there been just a little less talk, I would be giving this 5 stars.  I'm not sorry I bought it, but boy do I wish I could see some of those performances in full.",1156982400,10,1254,4.8
2524450,2,B000ENUL84,"...although it is subtitled ""A Critical Review"". Skip over the pompous  British critics and enjoy the too-short music clips. But it's always refreshing to hear John French. He always has some new stories about his years with Don. Worth a look, but hold out for the John Peel BBC documentary mentioned in other reviews.",1152489600,5,318,4.888888888888889
2524451,4,B000ENUL84,"It is a documentary , and for the most part a very good one .As it IS the ONLY one on The Captain , there is nothing to compare it to(except the BBC - produced one, that is seemingly  not  available here in the USA . ). I enjoyed it immensely even though there are no segments of Don Van Vliet being interviewed anywhere .It was filmed and recorded/produced very nicely and profesionally  ..BUT; I have one or 2 gripes .. yes , There COULD and SHOULD have been more footage of The Captain in action ..also It was a shame that we did not get to see Zoot Horn Rollo  being interviewed,(apparently he declined to go on camera) and  .. why do the critics come down so hard on Don,and the music? especially those Whiny English ones; Alan Clayson  was way over the top .. but on second viewing he was rather funny taking it all TOO seriously ! ..I don't want to put my fellow countrymen down...but in all fairness  These Brit 'Critics'  REALLY pan the 'Unconditionally Guaranteed' , and 'Blue Jeans' records .. Why?.. I think they are both  great! also we must remember that at that time  Don was trying to keep the various  band line -ups  together ,finding personnel when someone left , write material ,tour , record , and generally survive and keep it together  in the business , so you are not going to get musical consistency by any means especially from Don ! Following up 'Clear Spot' .. was a hell of a task ..maybe he should have retained  producer of 'Clear Spot' the great Ted Templeman ..maybe Virgin could not afford him (i'm not up to that point in the book yet! )..Considering all this, The music on both those discs(""Guaranteed"" and ""Moonbeams "" ) is miraculously wonderful.. Pompadour Swamp? -a classic !Back to the DVD ..I found the band members were very articulate in the interviews , I was a bit put off by the telephone in  John French's ear constantly ,as he had a lot of information  that I found  very interesting and , it would have made better video if only he would have hung up the phone .or at least CLIMBED the tree ,or  come up with a more original wacky antic  to do on camera ! ... I really liked his drum demonstrations though  ..I loved the quiz at the end.. nice touch .. also, there are  2 recent  Discs by the reformed Magic Band.. check em out; one is live the other is a studio recording('Back To The Front') they are both magnificent .. the live one( 21st Century Mirror Men)is a UK release ,and  comes with a DVD which is only  playable on your computer,if you live in  the USA  .Viva La Capitan , and Viva the Magic Band !It (The DVD)runs at a healthy ''almost 2 hours"" ..Fans of Captain Beefheart  should enjoy this ""critical breakdown"" for what it is ..maybe we will get a ""FULL Documentary"" with someone maybe coaxing Bill Harkelroad, and even Ry Cooder? onto a film interview ,and opening up for us ..and yes, MORE live, and lengthy  show clips .. hope we don't have to wait too long for the real thing to come along .. meanwhile this tasty  little thing will have to do .!!",1149292800,6,3016,4.354838709677419
2524452,2,B000ENUL84,"Short & sweet; I was thrilled that this DVD was made and it looks very professional but with Beefheart subject matter I feel the fans deserve more. Its unfortunate that the producers spent the money to (as John French puts it) fly 1/3 across the world to interview him (in a tree) but they don't include any extras worth watching like any complete performances ( why can some one just compile the concert footage and slap it on a dvd, that what we all want anyway). Any one who is a true Beefheart fan is not one simple because of the oddity of the band and its leader, they are folks that think ""out side the box"", folks that appreciate art and like to have there minds stimulated. I find it disconcerting that the producers found it necessary to interview the ex Magic Band members in such corny non artistic staging (ones in a tree, ones in the back of a grocery store kiddy ride, ones in a car in a garage, the list goes on). I find this a little insulting to what Don Van Vliet is about. If Beefheart fans buy this watch it for what it is and if your some one who is wanting an introduction to the genius that is Captain Beefheart I suggest you view a copy of a wonderful documentary called ""The Artist Formally Known As Captain Beefheart"" which is not legitimately available in American commercial release as far as I know at this time.... Hope this helps.",1148428800,11,1362,4.345098039215686

8111818,5,B000ENUL84,"Considering the obstacles (such as the unavailability of the Captain), this was an exceptional informative video of one of the 20th century's most original and brilliant musician. My expectations were low after reading the negative reviews by some customers on this site ...so I was prepared for the almost preposterous John French being an interviewed as if talking on telephone hanging on a tree branch. The interviews were generally intelligent. The pacing was well honed and the timeline comprehensive.  This DVD was well worth purchasing.",1238112000,,543,5.3882352941176475
8111819,3,B000ENUL84,"Musicians tend to spin towards idealism. Like Plato they obsess about the perfect version of an album. They notice that the work that they were involved with has not received its due, and when interviewed years later they agree with the negative comments expressed by these intelligent critics. It's all about tuning your perception antennae. Some come to view 'Trout Mask Replica' as the 'Ulysses' of contemporary music; apparently all the other albums are inferior by comparison. This is music viewed through a certain mind telescope to borrow a metaphor. Some of us, however, had other albums burned into our DNA that the critics and musicians, on this DVD, view as poorly produced or invested with soapy inspiration. Should we force ourselves to agree with these men? Should we denounce our profound appreciation as tarnished? Should we be embarrassed?

I love the last three albums equally, and find them as aesthetically pleasing as 'Trout'. Yes, they are more structured; yes, they are easier to digest. So what? There is magic in one style, as there is in the other. Don provided enough rocket fuel for both styles of his creativity. If your taste in music extends only to complex works, worthy of comparison to the great works of contemporary classical music, then only two albums by Don will tickle your radar. But if you trickle and shake to non-Nazi punk, reggae, experimental hip-hop and exquisite pop, then all the albums of Don will strike you as works of extraordinary charm. Take 'Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)' for example. Every time I play it the charm, the seduction of its beats and melodies transport me to that place that makes buying CD worthwhile. I don't care that musicians involved with this project are unhappy with the result. I love this album, because it weaves a spell that launches my mind to some other place from where I can endure another day on this violent planet. I don't care that some intelligent critic thinks it is second rate. I don't care that that articulate musician is disappointed with it. I only care that it performs the magic for me. Consider the following analogy: some declare that Shakespeare wrote 7 masterpieces; however, some of the other plays, when viewed with calm and attention, reveal mysteries absent from these pinnacles. Therefore, there were more than 7 masterpieces. The same applies to Captain Beefheart. And it even applies if Don, himself, denounced these works as unsatisfactory.
This DVD would have been better, if they had also interviewed people with considered views contradictory to those expressed on this documentary.",1236470400,4,2599,5.002309468822171
