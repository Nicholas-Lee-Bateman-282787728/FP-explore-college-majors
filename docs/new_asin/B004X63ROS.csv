This runs right at an hour long (62 min, I think), and appears to be the Corman final cut of the movie.  This is quite a cult movie, since it had a very convoluted history of various edits, including a first reshoot by Jack Hill, and then a later one by Stephanie Rothman.  Rothman apparently added the (rather nonsensical) vampire character, and viewers will be perplexed to see the corpse of Patrick Magee show up, since this is his only surviving scene!  I rather prefer the longer, choppier, public domain version that has more of the Jack Hill scenes.  Nonetheless, this is an attractive, clean copy.  Recommended.",1309219200,2,758,4.661654135338346

4492225,4,B004X63ROS,"Blood Bath,"" 1966 feature overseen by Roger Corman, has been given a luxurious box set release containing four different versions of the lurid horror tale.

William Campbell stars as Sordi, a painter who works in a bell tower, lures beautiful women to his studio, kills them, covers them in wax, and paints their pictures. He believes he is the reincarnation of his ancestor and the lovely Dorean (Lori Saunders) is also a reincarnation. In addition to all this baggage, it is suggested that Sordi just might be a vampire.

Corman invested in a Yugoslavian picture called Operation Titian just before it went into production. Insisting that it be filmed in English, he sent actors William Campbell and Patrick Magee and uncredited story editor Francis Ford Coppola to Dubrovnik to make a U.S.-friendly movie but wasn't pleased with the result. First he had it recut and re-scored to create Portrait in Terror, a film more compatible with the tastes of drive-in movie fans. Next he gave it to Jack Hill, then Stephanie Rothman, each director undertaking reshoots that resulted in a vampire picture called Blood Bath. When a TV version was required later on, scenes were eliminated and others added to create Track of the Vampire.

The 2-disc Blu-ray edition contains all four versions, newly restored. Bonus extras include a new interview with actor Sid Haig recorded exclusively for this release; archive interview with producer-director Jack Hill; stills gallery; double-sided fold-out poster; reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork; and limited edition booklet containing behind-the-scenes information about the cast and the making of the film.",1464652800,5,1675,5.313207547169811

Now a 2-Disc Limited Special Edition on Blu-ray
Amos Lassen
Blood Bath has quite a perplexing plot  to say the least. It is about an insane artist (William Campbell) who believes that he's the reincarnation of his ancestor, a madman burned at the stake centuries ago. Campbell lures women to his studio above a bell tower, paints their portraits, kills them, and then dips them in wax. There are four different versions of the film and all four are included in this release from Arrow Films. Track of the Vampire is  the television title of Blood Bath and it is ten minutes longer that the movie house version. The films history is quite interesting. It began as a Yugoslavian production called ""Operation: Titian"" that was helped set up by Corman himself who found the film to be unreleasable, but it later showed up on TV as ""Portrait of Terror"" (the second version). Then producer/director Roger Corman hired Jack Hill to shoot new scenes in California with Campbell, Sid Haig, Jonathan Haze, former playmate Marrisa Mathes, and others. Later, Stephanie Rothman was brought in to film even more scenes, mostly involving a subplot with Sandra Knight and the search for her missing sister.
Sordi (Campbell) is a painter who firmly believes  that he is the reincarnation of his ancestor and that the beautiful Dorean (Lori Saunders) is also a reincarnation. He e kills Dorean's friend Daisy
and Daisy's sister Donna (Sandra Knight). A group of comical artists come to the rescue and in the end,  we see several wax-covered victims come to life and turn on their creator.
In some cases the acting is terrible but horror fans will find it to be a treat.
For this release Arrow Video has searched through the vaults to bring you all four versions of Blood Bath, newly restored from the best materials available to provide a definitive release of one of Corman s craziest ventures.

4492230,2,B004X63ROS,"It was another cold mostly dreary winter day so I decided to watch two Prime video movies.  I'm really getting my money's worth out of my membership.  Today I went with off-beat Vampire stories.  Yes, I look for the unusual stories. The first was `Blood Bath' from 1966. Watching it I thought for sure it was Italian made.  Later I read up on it, turns out it was filmed in Serbia, of all places, and L.A.  It starred William Campbell.  I knew him best as Trelane in the original series Star Trek episode `The Squire of Gothos' and as a Klingon in another episode.  The story is about a Jekyll and Hyde like vampire.  At times he seems like a gentle but rather morbid artist. Other times he is possessed by a vampire artist ancestor of his.  The back story for his vampire ancestor was a bit confusing.  Nowadays he finds female victims and boils their bodies for some reason.  He boils them till they look like soap sculptures.  He also makes morbid death paintings of female nudes.  As in many films of this type there seems to be an endless supply of naive women victims for him to choose from.  Sometimes they're standing under gothic arches on dark streets late at night. Evidently they're waiting to become victims.  No they aren't there because they're hookers or anything close to logical like that.  Other times they`re swimming alone in bikinis on isolated beaches or hanging out alone by swimming pools at night. One female, after meeting him on the street admiring his art work in a window, is lured to his studio.  She then offers to do some modeling for him and strips without even being asked to.  Yes, even though his studio looks like it's in the Tower of London only not as cheery, the women don't seem overly concerned about the decor.  There are some attempts at surreal scenes in the movie where the director is trying to be artistic, the carousel scene for instance.  A woman is being chased on this carousel by the vampire, she begs for help yet either nobody takes her pleas seriously or they just don't care.  The best part about the film for me was the comments it contained on the nature of art and its value.  To me much of what is now considered priceless art is simply garbage in disguise; some of Andy Warhol's works come to mind as examples of expensive junk.  Is a painting  of a Campbell's soup can really worth a fortune? This movie seems to agree with me that it's not. There are some beatnik-like characters in it that think all kinds of junk are art.  One character even has what appears to be a prototype of our current paint ball guns and uses it to enhance his ""art"".  There are some very unlikely heroes that turn up. The film does succeed to some extent by being different and ends with pretty good scares even if the makeup is poor. For those reasons and its offbeat quality I give it a 2 out of 5 rating.  It was diverting.",1361750400,2,2868,4.4340344168260035
4492231,4,B004X63ROS,"Along with QUEEN OF BLOOD (also reviewed by me on amazon), BLOOD BATH is a remarkable achievement in hybrid cinema. The fact that they were intended to be seen together as a double bill makes for a fascinating study of contrasts as QUEEN is in vivid color and BLOOD BATH is in stark black & white. Never has a movie had a more convoluted history than this film which began life as a Yugoslavian film called OPERATION TITIAN. After purchasing it Roger Corman turned it over to Jack Hill who turned it into the story of a mad painter (William Campbell) who paints women in the throes of death and then covers their bodies in wax. This is intercut with humorous statements on the nature of art using hipsters in scenes very reminiscent of Corman's 1959 cult classic BUCKET OF BLOOD.

However Corman was not satisfied with Jack Hill's embellishments so he hired young up and coming director Stephanie Rothman to embellish it further. This she did by incorporating a story about the artist also turning into a vampire (who looks nothing like him). Mix that in with the beatniks, the mad artist and the Yugoslavian footage and all in 62 minutes and you have one wild, bizarre movie experience that manages to hang together into a fascinating whole. It doesn't make a lot of sense but then it doesn't have to. Later the original film was expanded to 80 minutes with more leftover footage and turned into the TV movie TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE. The original Yugoslavian footage was reedited by a young Francis Ford Coppola as the TV movie PORTRAIT IN TERROR.

Now for the first time since its drive-in run it's possible to see BLOOD BATH the way it was in the theaters. We're back to the original 62 minute print with the original widescreen aspect radio restored. What really makes the movie is the astonishing black & white photography which is beautifully highlighted in this MGM Limited Edition DVD-R. Ronald Stein's creepy score and the startling paintings (which would influence NIGHT GALLERY) make for a genuinely disturbing film. This is what creative, low budget cinema is all about and its great to have BLOOD BATH and its companion piece QUEEN OF BLOOD looking even better than they did when they were first released. Try and see them both if you can but only in the MGM Limited Edition versions.",1342828800,3,2294,4.689826302729529
4492232,4,B004X63ROS,"The remarkable low-budget horror film BLOOD BATH is an esoteric example of accidental art whose production history is as interesting as the film itself.

Uncredited Executive Producer Roger Corman hired co-director Stephanie Rothman (THE VELVET VAMPIRE) to complete an unfinished and shelved independent thriller directed by Jack Hill (SPIDER BABY), about a killer artist stalking the Beat art scene in Venice, California. Rothman's re-write transformed the villain into a vampire.

Corman embellished BLOOD BATH with ten minutes of rich atmospheric footage from a Yugoslavian film, OPERATION TITIAN, which in turn was revised by Corman protege Francis Ford Coppola as a very obscure feature released exclusively to television, PORTRAIT OF TERROR. This combined the dubbed and re-edited TITIAN with new scenes featuring actors William Campbell (STAR TREK) and Patrick Magee (A CLOCKWORK ORANGE), shot by second-unit director Hill during the filming in Ireland of Coppola's first commercial feature, DEMENTIA 13.

In BLOOD BATH, William Campbell's character retained the same occupation and name (artist ""Antonio Sordi"", or ""Tony"") from PORTRAIT. An early cut of the film contained even more footage from TITIAN which was trimmed for the finished theatrical edition released by American-International Productions.

For the television version of BLOOD BATH entitled TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE, Corman and Rothman expanded the 62-minute theatrical cut by eleven minutes, restoring some of the Yugoslavian footage and adding out-takes from the American version (including a three-minute interpretive ballet on the beach by Lori/Linda Saunders).

The most notable addition to TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE was a scene of Campbell and Magee from PORTRAIT OF TERROR, newly-dubbed to fit the existing story. The scene established a sub-plot which altered one of the supporting characters. (It also served as preparation for the nonsensical presence of Magee's ""corpse"" in the finale.)

These additions and restorations emphasized the patchwork nature of the film but also enhanced the unique sense of a bizarre collage.

The main debit is the jarring inclusion of awful improvisational black-comedy scenes, set in a Beat coffee-house, which look and play like out-takes from Corman's BUCKET OF BLOOD. These do, however, slyly satirize the very randomness of the film itself, enlightening us as to the ""cosmic"" effect of quantum physics on pretentious modern art. (The scenes were deleted from the TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE cut.)

The film's strongest assets are its beautiful black-and-white photography (by Alfred Taylor and Nenad Jovicic) and an eerie score by Ronald Stein. It benefits from a deeply creepy performance by Campbell, a striking one by Sandra Knight (of FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER and Corman's THE TERROR), and the bikinied presence of breathtaking Saunders.

In either of its variants, BLOOD BATH is a tremendously weird and compelling film that makes no sense at all on a story level but chances to succeed as low-budget surrealism worthy of Mario Bava. A dream scene effectively suggests the designs of Salvadore Dali; while a nightmarish sequence (shot with style by Rothman) of Knight tracking the vampire on shadowed streets approaches the haunting beauty of Herk Harvey's CARNIVAL OF SOULS.

The MGM Limited Edition made-to-order DVD-R is the original 62-min. theatrical version of BLOOD BATH, presented in its correct aspect ratio and rarely seen since its original release. This is a good print which looks and sounds dramatically better any any of the public-domain DVD's of the TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE version. Adjust monitor's sharpness control to minimum for intermittent excess grain.

RATING: 7/10 *** GOOD.",1339027200,7,3705,5.516754850088184
4492233,3,B004X63ROS,"What a weird little flick. This 62 minute quickie, directed by Jack Hill and Stephanie Rothman, is about as odd an entry as I've seen in this type of movie. It's set in Venice CA. though much of the architecture seems European. It involves an artist who is the descendant of another, centuries earlier, artist who was put to death for witchcraft, though somehow it caused him to turn into a vampire. He now paints women in the throes of death, kills them and dips them in acid.

I understand this was culled from other movies which explains having two directors and why the villain has two separate visages. But those other movies must have been pretty bad as they still only ended up with a 62 minute flick. The black and white cinematography, particularly in the night scenes, is stunning. And the story contains some odd notes. How many movies have you seen that try to fuse art with quantum physics? And one of the scenes is set up as though it were one of Salvidor Dali's paintings. It's a real eye opener. There is some fun jabbing at the sensibilities of artists and some pretty good cheese cake in the form of Lori Saunders in a bikini.

It's cool seeing Sid Haig in his early days but, like much of the rest of the movie, it's just a curiosity. The whole thing doesn't quite hang together. Plus, the villain resides in a church tower his ancestor resided in in the 11th century. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe there was a United States in the 11th century. Still, though, this is a lot of fun and it's short enough and whacked enough to warrant the attention of ardent film fans.",1320624000,,1607,4.425675675675675
4492234,3,B004X63ROS,"Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict -- ""With multiple directors it's somewhat difficult to determine who is responsible for what, but the overall atmosphere of Blood Bath is impressively creepy. Part of that is due to the actors giving some intense performances, but the lion's share of the credit goes to the nighttime black-and-white photography. It's not quite as stylized as typical noir or horror, but the darker scenes have an interesting edge to them, and even the scenes in daylight have an ""off"" quality. The idea of somehow capturing life or death on canvas is a good one. Sure Oscar Wilde did it with Dorian Gray, and it's been done in other pics as well, but the whole ""Dead Red Nudes"" concept is a solidly weird one. But the fact that the film throws in a bizarre vampire subplot to this already over-saturated tale just shows how off the rails an hour-long film can get.""",1310256000,3,884,4.709677419354839

If you read what I write on a regular basis then you already know that I have a love for all things Arrow Video. Its one of those companies determined to resurrect movies from the past that are overlooked, forgotten or tossed aside by their home studios and then offer them in pristine condition with enough extras to entertain but not overshadow the movie in question. That being said their offering of BLOOD BATH is the most comprehensive and exhausting endeavor Ive seen from them and I mean that in a good way.

Before delving deeper into the set be aware you're getting 4 movies here made up of one movie. Im not talking about sequels, extended editions or directors cuts. Im talking 4 different moviesall from the same original movie. To understand you have to realize that when it was made there was a drive-in circuit that movies played in with films that catered to those clients, more often than not teens looking for cheap and easy action, horror and racy flicks. Director Roger Corman made his career on these types of films and began producing as well. He produced a film in Europe that was called OPERATION TITIAN, a film about stolen art with cops and robbers involved. He decided the movie wasn't quite what he wanted so had it recut and changed into the film PORTRAIT OF TERROR. Still not quite what he wanted he handed it over to director Jack Hill and it became BLOOD BATH. Stephanie Rothman had helped with that version but before selling it to TV it was recut again with new scenes added and became TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE (the version I was aware of from horror hosts screenings years ago). What Arrow has done is bring all four version together in one package which makes for fascinating viewing for film fans.

OPERATION TITIAN is actually a well-made robbery film with some amazing shots reminiscent of the Carol Reed film THE THIRD MAN. The presentation here in black and white is amazing to see with a crisp, clear image that shows work was put into this presentation. PORTRAIT OF TERROR and BLOOD BATH offer the same footage in some places combined with a new story to offer a different tale, switching things from a robbery film to the story of an artist who thinks hes a vampire and boils his models in wax. Definitely different right? And yet both use some of the same footage. By the time you get to TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE a part of you wonders what in the world was going on. But the fact is that the movie made money in all four versions, a definite return on investment that many film makers would love to see.

As I said the quality of the movies as presented here is better than you would expect when you consider the fact that it was chopped up so many times, played the drive-in circuit and was never a movie a studio would consider preserving if they even kept it on hand to begin with. But Arrow has come through offering the most complete presentation of the film in all of its incarnations here.

In addition to that the extras should satisfy fans as well. They include high definition transfers of the films in 1080p, The Trouble With Titian a documentary featuring Tim Lucas that describes the long and twisted path the films took, an interview with Sid Haig who starred the later versions, an archive interview with director Jack Hill, a stills gallery, a fold out double sided poster featuring old and newly commissioned artwork, a reversible cover sleeve and a booklet about the films. The price is higher than most Arrow releases but again you're getting four complete films here folks.

Fans of Corman will find this a must have in their collection as will die-hard Jack Hill fans whose numbers seem to be growing with each Arrow release that he is responsible for. Horror fans will want to add it to their collection as a reminder of those days when horror host ruled the airwaves. Movie lovers will want to have it because of the historical value on display. In short it is an interesting development to watch from one film to the next and a nice addition to any collection.",1470700800,,4077,4.547683923705722

Another day and another boxset from Arrow Video. The more they crank out, the more I get to bask in the glory of kickass boxsets. One of the more recent ones to come out is Blood Bath. This one is a bit different than the others, as it is really one movie split up into 4 different films. There is a lot of history behind how this happened and the special features go into great detail about it all. As for this review, I will break down each film and whats in the box (come on, you know you read that in Brad Pitts voice) and tell you whether or not you should seek this one out. With that being said, lets get this review show on the road

Movie Review

The first film in the set is Operation Titian. Roger Corman bought the film before production started and it is the starting point for the rest of the films. Its not a horror film, but actually, a crime caper involving paintings being stolen, double crosses and a convoluted story. The film feels quite long, but has a better flow than the other movie on the same disc: Portrait in Terror.

As for Portrait in Terror, the directors Jack Hill and Stephanie Rothman go about shooting some new scenes and removing others. In relation to Operation Titian, the films starting point is a scene that was originally about 20 minutes into Titian. It also feels very choppy. Another change was a kill scene, which resulted in a different actor being shown on screen, who is clearly someone that wasn't in the film originally. And, they must have had to pay a lot for scuba gear, as they decided to shoot an extended underwater scene that ran way too long.

Having said all that, the two films pretty much tell the same story. However, it has a few twists and turns that should keep you entertained. If I was to choose one to watch, I would go with Operation Titian.

Now we get to Blood Bath. Somehow, the makers of the flick decided that a crime caper about stealing paintings could easily be turned into a flick about vampires. Yes, you heard right, vampires. Blood Bath has a tiny bit of scenes from the original Operation Titian, but for the most part, its an entirely new flick. However, that doesnt mean its a good flick, as it really isnt. Its a long drawn out bloodless affair  a vampire flick titled Blood Bath that is without blood?!? For shame!

Track of the Vampire is a TV film that blossomed from Blood Bath and its really the same flick, save for some new scenes that add absolutely nothing to the plot. They take a couple scenes from the original Operation Titian and try to shoehorn them into the film, dubbing over the characters to reflect whatever they are trying to convey, in this case, a side plot about a husband who thinks his wife is cheating on him. There is also a really long scene at the beginning of the flick that has a vampire chasing a woman down, during the day. Yes, the day. Also, I would be remiss in not mentioning the lengthy dance number on the beach. Why a dance number you may be asking? I haven't a clue.

Unfortunately, none of the films in this set add up to much. They are all rather boring and to be perfectly frank, bland. However, its not the film themselves that make this boxset so interesting, but the history behind it and the power of what a bit of editing and reshooting can do for a film. Which brings me to the special features on the Blu-ray

Blu-ray Opinion

The biggest reason to buy this boxset is because of one special feature in particular titled The Trouble With Titian Revisited. Its an 1 hour and 21-minute visual essay by Tim Lucas on the complete history of the films. It breaks down each one and goes into wonderful detail on how all this confusing mess came to be. The other features aren't as lengthy, with the interview with Sid Haig (who was in the Blood Bath versions of the film) is only roughly 4 minutes and the archival interview with Jack Hill clocks in at 3 minutes. Your money is definitely going to that one lengthy feature and one feature alone. As a note, the features are present on Disc 2 of the set.

As for the video and audio, things are a bit hit and miss depending on which version you are watching. Both Operation Titian and Portrait in Terror have bits and pieces of rough video and audio hiss. There are plenty of times where the video is clean, though. As for Blood Bath and Track of the Vampire, they fair about the same. They aren't perfect and still feature rough areas. These are films from 60s with some very rough materials and in the case of Operation Titian, some of the material was standard definition.

Verdict

Blood Bath is one boxset where I cant recommend it based on the movies alone, so it does make it hard to recommend if the price is high. However, if by chance you see the Blu-ray for a sweet deal and love special features and hearing about the crazy history behind a wacky movie(s), you're going to love it. Ill leave it up to you to decide.",1467072000,2,5000,4.373922413793103
8446158,5,B004X63ROS,"Ever since I first saw TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE a.k.a. BLOOD BATH (1966) on the Chicago morning program ""The Prize Movie with Ione"" back in 1972, I've had a special fondness for this low budget, patchwork of a movie. I found its premise of an artist/vampire terrorizing the beatniks of Venice Beach, California rather compelling and the location photography wonderfully atmospheric. Little did I realize then the complex back story about how this obscure horror gem came to be.

It all started in 1963 when B-movie maestro Roger Corman secured production of a Yugoslavian crime thriller, OPERATION TITIAN and, hoping to appeal to an American audience, cast William Campbell and Patrick Magee in principal roles. Unhappy with the result, Corman re-cut and re-scored the film, as well as added a few scenes and released it as PORTRAIT IN TERROR. Believing he could still fare better, Corman had the premise re-structured into a vampire tale requiring more extensive reshoots resulting in BLOOD BATH, which itself was expanded for TV distribution as TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE. Although he was the guiding force behind this convoluted venture, Roger Corman received no onscreen credit on any of the four BLOOD BATH incarnations.

In retrospect, the source for all the subsequent versions - OPERATION TITIAN - isn't bad at all, with fine direction by Rado Novakovi and fabulous location photography of the ancient, Adriatic coastal port of Dubrovnik. BLOOD BATH was directed by Jack Hill and Stephanie Rothman, and likewise generates great atmosphere derived from footage of TITIAN's  exteriors coupled with the scenes shot at Venice Beach which sort of resemble Dubrovnik. Indeed, they recall DEMENTIA a.k.a. DAUGHTER OF HORROR (1955) and Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL (1958), two other films that also make splendid use of Venice. PORTRAIT IN TERROR streamlines TITIAN's plot somewhat, while TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE pads out BATH's with re-dubbed scenes from TITIAN and two incongruous sequences: the vampire chasing a sarong-clad girl in broad daylight and a solo ballet along the beach that goes on forever. The severely underrated William Campbell is the only actor to appear in all four versions of BLOOD BATH as artist Antonio Sordi; his transformation into a vampire with a Zorro-type hat is played by an uncredited actor.

All the films are worthwhile in their own way. BLOOD BATH has some genuinely frightening moments, such as the gruesome murder of one of Sordi's models, former Playboy Playmate Marissa Mathes. Another great sequence is when Sandra Knight's character pursues the vampire Sordi and becomes pursued herself, meeting a grisly fate on a carousel.

Arrow Video is to be praised for finally giving this quartet of films their just due with a most welcome Blu-ray edition sourced from original film elements. I never thought I'd ever get to see OPERATION TITIAN, let alone an entire boxed set celebrating everything that led up to TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE. Bonus features include a superb documentary, ""The Trouble with Titian Revisited"" by Tim Lucas that chronicles the complicated history of BLOOD BATH's multiple versions, a new interview with actor Sid Haig, archival interview with director Jack Hill, a stills gallery, a double-sided fold-out poster and a limited edition booklet with new articles on all four films.

 As a fan of these underground cult classics, I would have to say that this is easily the most significant video release so far in 2016.

8446161,4,B004X63ROS,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

This movie is a doozy to reviewnot because it is a bad film, but because its actually four movies that were made from the same source material.  Confused?  Youre not alone; it took me a few minutes to map this out in my head as well.  Let me try to explain.

The infamous Roger Corman started off by shooting a movie titled OPERATION TITIAN.  This was done in Yugoslavia, of all places, but Corman was not happy with the end product.  So, after some tweaking, re-cutting, and rescoring, the film was released as PORTRAIT IN TERROR.  For some reason, two other directors jumped in a year later and added more footage, thanks to reshoots and some slick editing, which resulted in two more versions of the film:  TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE, a TV-safe version of what would ultimately be the final film, BLOOD BATH.

Sofour movies made from a single film.  Sounds like the stuff of Hollywood legend, right?  I guess you can say it is.  But regardless, the fine folks at Arrow Video and MVD Distribution have crammed all four films into a two-disc Blu-ray set for our enjoyment.  And while the films aren't too shabby themselves, the engaging story behind them is enough to warrant owning this piece of cinematic history.

So now I have to ask myself:  did I actually like the films?  Eh, Im a little on the fence.  OPERATION TITIAN was good, but PORTRAIT IN TERROR was even better.  But the vampire aspect didn't really work for me.  I think partly because it was such a large deviation from where the original film wanted to go.  But even though I didn't care for the latter two, they are still worthy of watching.

Each film is shot well for the most part, however you can certainly tell differences in the cinematography styles.  This is very evident in the BLOOD BATH, as the old and new footage sometimes clash in their atmospheres.  Does this detract from the film?  Not as a whole, but some of it is glaringly obvious.

The acting in each film is pretty bad, I have to confess.  I cant decide if its the actors themselves or the dialogue that makes it so, but Ive seen better line deliveries in some high school productions.

Still, I cant downplay the entertainment factor here.  The films are all entertaining in some form or fashion, although I cant say they have any true horror cred.  Quirky and strange, yes, but no real scares or bigtime gore.

Even so, I enjoyed this collection, and fans of Cormans work will definitely want to snatch this one up.",1464912000,,2526,4.522123893805309

8446163,4,B004X63ROS,"As one might expect from a career as lengthy as Roger Corman's, there are no shortage of colorful stories to tell.  But few are as complicated and convoluted as the history behind Blood Bath (1966), a 62-minute second feature made up of no less than three other films, which set a new standard for return on investment...even by Corman's standards!

It's probably best to start with the extras on Arrow Video's remarkable 2-disc set, most notably Tim Lucas' feature-length breakdown on the genesis of the film, which began as Operation Titian, an Eastern European crime-thriller which Corman commissioned but found to be unmarketable to a US audience (despite the fact that future auteur Francis Ford Coppola was in charge of the set).

An abridged version was released as part of American International's TV package, entitled Portrait in Terror.  But Director Jack Hill (Spider Baby) shot an entirely new film using bits and pieces of Titian as a backdrop for his story about an artist (William Campbell) who murders his models to create a series of gruesome still life portraits.  However, circumstances pulled Hill away from the final cut, and, under the auspices of Stephanie Rothman, Blood Bath was turned into a more traditional vampire movie!

This sort of cut-and-paste production was nothing new for Corman, who had already done the same thing with a series of Russian sci-fi films, incorporating the special effects footage into several different titles.  But Blood Bath's evolution didn't stop there; another longer cut was created for TV once again under the title Track of the Vampire, expanding the running time with a number of embarrassingly stretched out scenes.

So how are the films themselves?  Operation Titian is actually a very competent piece of Euro-filmmaking, presented here on video for the very first time.  The story involving the theft of a priceless painting includes a pair of strong performances (with great use of Patrick Magee as the heavy) and a stylish visual approach reminiscent of Orson Welles' canted camera angles and chiaroscuro lighting.  Blood Bath adds a dated bit of beatnik humor (inspired by Corman's own Bucket of Blood), nonsensical supernatural elements and mismatched characters, but still manages one humdinger of a ""wax museum"" finale.  The other versions of the film are curiosity pieces more or less, but the ability to view and dissect them is a fascinating achievement in film preservation...and an enlightening study in the bizarre backstage business machinations of the exploitation industry.

Arrow's boxset includes the essential aforementioned documentary The Trouble with Titian hosted by Tim Lucas along with interviews from director Jack Hill and co-star Sid Haig.  There's also a foldout poster, liner notes, reversible sleeve and outtakes.  But the crowning achievement here are the 2K restorations of Portrait in Terror, Blood Bath and Track of the Vampire along with a new reconstruction of Operation Titian using the original film materials and standard definition inserts.",1464739200,3,3046,5.277432712215321
