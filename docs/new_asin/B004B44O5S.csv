8421507,5,B004B44O5S,"Asian superheroes always ""kill off"" their villains and, sometimes, even die trying.

But this movie will have you cheering on this dagger-tossing, ""Forrest Gump"". ( Yes, that's basically what he is.) And he stumbles upon this female reporter ( that hot eastern girl from the first Transporter movie ) who discovers his superhuman abilities and just goes all ""Loius Lane"" over him.

The rest is just what you would expect: a good clash of heroes, martial arts, and crazy special effects.  Sweet!",1364169600,2,494,5.0
8421508,3,B004B44O5S,"Probably those who are looking forward to seeing some intense, Jet Li-type martial action stunts will be disappointed with ""City Under Siege,"" a sort of an answer from Hong Kong filmmakers to the current Hollywood superhero blockbusters. Unlike his ""New Police Story"" or ""Shaolin,"" Director Benny Chan takes a more light-hearted approach to the familiar story about good and evil, with special effects-ridden fights between a superhero and supervillains, but the end result is really a mixed bag.

The film is about ""Sunny"" (Aaron Kwok), a clown of a traveling circus troupe (and a son of a renowned knife throwing master). One day, while looking for gold in a Malaysian cave, he and other circus members including circus troupe leader Zhang Dachu (Collin Chou) are exposed to the chemical gas developed by the Japanese army just before WWII ended.

But you may skip the dull introductory part. About 40 minutes in, the real story begins with Zhang Dachu and his gang, who have transformed into superhuman ""monsters"" robbing the jewelry stores and banks in Hong Kong; and Sunny, who gained superhuman powers apparently without changing physical appearance. Shu Qi plays Angel, a TV reporter covering the story of Sunny. Wu Jing and Zhang Jingchu are special agents.

The film has a few action set-pieces that are watchable but not remarkable. Wu Jing and Collin Chou show what they can do in the martial arts action scenes, but there are not many, and cheesy special effects of flying knives do not help. Aaron Kwok's reluctant hero remains uninteresting, and so does Shu Qi's opportunistic reporter. Benny Chan attempt to explore the characters' inner psyche or soul by introducing romances and father-son relationship, but none is convincing.

Silly and uneven ""City Under Siege"" could have been a more entertaining romp with a tighter story and better effects.",1328659200,,1863,5.098360655737705
8421509,1,B004B44O5S,"I like Aaron Kwok. He has a lot of detractors who call him wooden and full of hot air, but I've enjoyed him in movies like 2000 AD and China Strike Force. But it really pains me to see him act like such an annoying and dense character in City Under Siege. It's supposed to be a running joke in the movie that he's an idiot, but it's not the least bit funny.

He stars as a circus performer in a traveling troupe. One day, they all discover strange chemicals underground, and for no reason at all, Aaron's fellow performers turn on him and become evil. Then they get mutated with augmented strength and start a rampage. Aaron also gets mutated which doesn't alter his looks, but makes him an expert knife thrower.

Shu Qi plays a news reporter who gets fired in favor of someone younger. .........Yeah right. She meets Aaron and they end up having some of the worst romantic chemistry of the year.

As mentioned before, the villains have no motivation to be villains and are just ridiculous. Colin Chou is their leader, and his mutant makeup looks awful. The script also requires him to be a whiny crybaby who has fits of rage.

Wu Jing also has a role as a cop tracking down the mutants. He looks like he should be the star of the film, but is completely out of place playing second fiddle to Aaron Kwok. His character also proves to be unlikeable when he proclaims that the mutants are freaks who need to be tortured and given autopsies.

One of the characters also has a girlfriend who dies simply to force emotion out of the audience, and it comes across as cheap.

After scoring big with New Police Story and Invisible Targets, it's a wonder how Benny Chan can direct a film with so little action. The fight scenes are very short, and instead of cool choreography it's a mix of gimmicky CGI and lame comedic antics.

This film is a waste of time, and I can't believe US distributors would want to expose this to potential audiences.",1323043200,,1936,4.421348314606742
8421510,5,B004B44O5S,"I first saw the review for this movie on G4 and they rated as one of the martial arts you need to add to your collection and they were right! The fight scenes and story line is very good. The characters in the movie inquire these supernatural powers want which made the movie and the special effects Awesome! I don't want to give too much away, you have to see it. It's one to get if you don't own it.",1322179200,,401,4.025
