2917494,4,B000UAE7IQ,"I personally saw Rick Larson at a church in Metro Atlanta two years ago give the Star Of Bethlehem presentation. This DVD is a shorter version of that presentation, which captures the essence of the presentation. I would have like for the DVD to include more extras that addressed questions that arise from the presentation. (example:Why does he say Herod the Great died in 1 B.C. not 4 B.C. like most scholars? He should give more background on the Wise Men). Answering these kind of questions would have made the DVD better, in my opinion.",1195603200,10,541,4.705263157894737
2917495,5,B000UAE7IQ,"A magnificent display of the evidence to support the claims made for the Star of Bethlehem. The presentation is an inquiry without presupposition that engages even the most hostile viewer in an entertaining and easily understandable way. The data and the methods of investigation employed are transparent to anyone wanting to repeat them for themselves - I have and find only more evidence for the claims he makes, the visuals and the music are a delight and the discovery will take your breath away. A great Christmas present for anybody open minded to sorting truth from myth and legend regardless of religious persuasion. The Bible always said the heavens declare the glory of God. If you don't see that, get this DVD.",1192665600,215,721,4.918032786885246

I have watched this production develop for the last 6 years.  The first time I saw it I was so impressed by the depth of research that went into it and ultimately how everything in the presentation could be supported by the scriptures and then by history and by Astronomy.  The whole story and the whole effect is just too amazing to express adequately.  I have already bought and past out 10 copies from last year and I have shown it to everyone who happened to come to my house and then I had three copies that I loan out repeatedly so there is no telling how many have watched my copies.  You will want to watch it again and again and you will want to study the details and in the end you will stand there all amazed at the story written in the stars before the fountation of the world.",1191888000,27,948,4.943396226415095
2917497,5,B000UAE7IQ,"Gives historical, biblical and scientific information about what the star was.  Very well researched yet entertaining and ""watchable"".  This is amazing for many reasons, but I like it because right now, this information is not well known.  Mr. Larson has put all of the pieces of the puzzle in-place.  I've purchased more than 20 of the previous version and have given nearly all of them away.  When I loan them out, I never seem to get them back because everyone wants to share the DVD with all their friends and relatives.",1191369600,62,524,4.714285714285714
2917498,5,B000UAE7IQ,"We also saw Rick Larson last Christmas at a live presentation and was amazed with the content of this DVD.  We purchased six of the DVDs at that time for giving as gifts.  We also showed the DVD 7 or 8 times to friends and family during the holiday season.  I have never seen this information put together in such a comprehevsive, well researched and thought out manner. Watching this DVD will now be a part of our annual Christmas Celebration. I will be purchasing more this year to give as gifts...it is just THAT good!  You won't be disappointed!",1189814400,30,549,4.46
2917499,5,B000UAE7IQ,"We bought this DVD as soon as it was available for sale through its original vendor.  Twice I've seen Rick Larson give this presentation live and it brought tears to my eyes BOTH times.  When the DVD came out I knew I wanted to buy it to share with others, and that's what I've done.  Before I viewed it for the first time I was eager to see how it would compare to the live presentation...it is wonderful!  I've pre-ordered more copies to give as gifts.",1189728000,148,454,4.244186046511628

2917532,2,B000UAE7IQ,To me it seemed like a whole lot of emotional religious blather surrounding one scientific fact (at least we believe they are facts)  about Kepler's mathematical principles being put into computer programs that allow us to recreate the movements of the stars and planets were at any given moment in history.  That was the one takeaway I got from this.  The rest was just annoying.  Larson was an annoying presenter; if I had him teaching a class on any subject I would likely find him patronizing and egotistical to point of walking out of the class.  I believe in God and the possibility of the virgin birth.  I don't believe this film offered anything of substance.,1514332800,,667,4.706896551724138

2917578,5,B000UAE7IQ,"Mr. Larson, a lawyer, finds NINE facts (clues) about the star of Bethlehem in the Bible. I only noticed three until I saw Mr. Larson point out the rest.  Then he reviews historical records and uses a new computer program (Starry Night, I think) to find the only explanation that fits all nine clues.  It made my heart leap and (as Mr. Larson says) the hair stood up on the back of my neck to hear what God did to show us these signs.  Don't skip the extra features; one of them has another eye opening observation. The video assumes the viewer has some understanding of astronomy. Before or after you watch this video, I recommend you look up the Solar System and the constellations of the Zodiac.",1494115200,,697,4.4296875

This is SO dry and focused on the presenter, Rick Larson, that my husband and I couldn't even get through 20 minutes of previewing it! I was so disappointed that I wished I hadn't invested in 2. The product is not engaging for the average adult, let alone teens! I decided to scrap this idea for the Epiphany celebration and show another film (""The Fourth Wiseman"") again this year. Also, this doc does a dis-service to the fields of science, math, astronomy and religion when the presenter continues to confuse the terms ""astrology"" and ""astronomy.""

Larson's information is far more up to date and has the advantage of computer-generated images of the skies to illustrate the points made.

Significantly, he confuses astrology with astronomy.  Astrology has nothing to do with Christianity and everything to do with satanism.  Astronomy on the other hand is a science. He makes assumptions about the magi, that they were likely Jewish. Not so.  Were they astrologers?  Likely. That is part of the beauty of the Star is that it announced to the whole world, including pagans, the birth of the Savior. He would be better informed if he read Scott Hahn's Joy to the World, as well as many of Pope Benedict's writings about the liturgy and creation, concerning the birth of Christ intertwined with the Crucifixion.  Mr. Larson cannot begin to have completed his study of this subject until he reviews Catholic Tradition, Magisterium (Teaching), combined with Scripture.",1482710400,3,1047,5.335365853658536

It is w/o a doubt one of my favorite Christian videos of all time.  The truths uncovered here by the author may make the hairs stand up on back of your neck, maybe bring you to tears, or in my case, perhaps a little of both.  I first saw part of this video in my Sunday school class last week, so I immediately wanted to know more of the story.  I will never look at the night sky, or God for that matter, the same way again.  Truly inspirational and quite informative from the author and creators of this DVD.  If you are a true Christian, this video is highly recommended for you, and may even spark an interest in non-Christians too.  I'm sure there will always be naysayers, non-believers.

2917702,5,B000UAE7IQ,"this presentation is a profound bit of research.  through the years i have heard a lot of ideas and theories for the star that lead the wisemen to the Christ.  i found Mr. Larson's presentation to be scholarly, well presented, and something that needs to be watched multiple times to gain real understanding of the material he presents.

one of the most credible aspects of this presentation is that he will tell you that often he had cold feet as he started to research this subject and that it was a years long search to find and present what you see in this presentation.

if Christ is God, if Christ was born as recorded, if the bible is trustworthy, there is a record of the even.  I think that if you will review what is presented, and critically test it...i mean put the screws to the material and test what is presented, it will hold up and you will know that the bible records the birth of the king of all kings...the Lord.

i really hope you will take the time to watch, and consider what is presented.",1481587200,4,1012,4.3563829787234045

I bought several of them and I am keeping one for myself; I gave one to the local library; I gave one to a local minister and I'm sending out the rest as the days go buy (right after Thanksgiving).

2917740,4,B000UAE7IQ,"This video was extremely enlightening to me. I will be ordering at least 10 more of them to share with my friends and family. Is the presentation perfect? No, it isn't perfect. And I think even Mr Larson will admit that much. But there is far more good information in it than the unintentional ""misinformation"".

For instance:

Most interpretations of the Revelation 12 sign miss its true meaning, particularly when it comes to the identity of the woman and her son. The woman is usually interpreted as either Mary, the mother of Jesus, or the nation of Israel. These interpretations fall far short of its true meaning. They lack the foretelling of the FUTURE and the ""Spirit of Prophecy"" consistent with the book of Revelation. Most students of the bible are well aware of the fact that the scriptures portray the Church as the Bride of Jesus Christ. This fact is almost entirely overlooked when interpreting this Great Sign in Revelation 12. The woman portrayed in this sign is indeed the Church. And the child with whom she is in labor represents the progeny of Jesus Christ. According to the Apostle Paul, this topic has been a mystery which was hidden throughout the ages. For we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to His WIFE, and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery, butI speak concerning Christ and the Church- Ephesians 5:30-32. This mystery will soon be fully disclosed with the ""apocalypse"" (the unveiling) of Jesus Christ. 

What does the Great Sign in Revelation 12 mean? The short answer is that a ruler is about to born from the union between Jesus Christ and His Church. It is the progeny of Jesus Christ who will rule all nations with a rod of iron, by the Spirit of Christ dwelling within them, having been unveiled and made manifest to the whole creation! ""For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God"" - Romans 8:19.

""...the mysterythat was hidden for ages and generationsbut is now revealed to His saints,to whomGodhas chosento make knownamongtheGentilesthegloriousrichesof thismystery,whichisChristinyou,
thehopeof glory."" Colossians 1:26-27

2917758,5,B000UAE7IQ,"Passover is a Sabbath. A Special Sabbath, although it can occur on any day of the week (like a wandering star) just like any of the other feast days the LORD established. These Sabbaths are in addition to the normal weekly fixed STAR sabbaths (Saturday). Originally, Passover lambs were slain at sunset (perhaps around 6PM?) on the 13th of Nissan (i.e. at the very start of Passover Day - 14th of Nissan). There was no Passover Preparation Day as there was at the time of Christ's death. The lamb was eaten over night, early on the 14th of Nissan. But at the time of Christ's death, Passover lambs were slain on the 13th of Nissan at 2pm on Fridays, or at 3pm every other day of the week [source: Jewish Encyclopedia]. This became known as the Passover Preparation Day. Joseph of Arimathea only had a couple hours to get Jesus down off the cross and in the tomb before Passover Sabbath began at sunset (around 6PM perhaps/sunset). He had to hurry to ""Prepare"" Jesus for burial. Appropriate since the Children of Israel had to hurry to leave Egypt in haste. Jesus was not even annointed we are told due to the time contraints. The Feast of Unleavened Bread starts on the 15th Day of Nissan (at even/sunset on the 14th of Nissan) and runs through the 21st Day. Unleavened Bread was eaten with the Passover Lamb on the Passover, on the 14th Day of Nissan (i.e. sunset of the 13th Day to sunset of the 14th Day of Nissan). Unleavened bread was to be eaten for 7 days beginning with the Passover Day (although a Separate Feast Day from the 7 Days Festival of Unleavend Bread). The first 6 days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, unleavened bread was eaten, but not on the final 7th day of the feast. So we have a combination of 1 day of unleavened bread being eaten on Passover + the first 6 days of Unleavened Bread, for a total of 7 days of unleavened bread being eaten. Jesus died on the 13th of Nissan at 3pm (A Wednesday in the year 34 A.D., on April 21st), the Prepartion Day for Passover. Sir Issac Newton believed he died on April 23rd, 34 A.D., a Friday. Not true. Jesus died on Wednesday the 21st because he died at 3pm when the ""other"" Passover lambs were slain. Jesus was THE PASSOVER LAMB. God knew exactly what time Jesus would die. God knew Jesus would be 3 days and 3 nights in the heart of the earth as Jonah (the intoxicating dove) would be 3 days and 3 nights in the belly of the great fish (astrological Pisces perhaps?). Sunset Wednesday to sunset Saturday is 3 nights and 3 days. Jesus rising from death at the conclusion of the fixed STAR weekly sabbath. GET THIS !!! No work was done by the people the entire 3 days Jesus was in the tomb from sunset Wednesday through sunset Saturday. Why? Because Thursday was wandering STAR Passover (a day of rest), Friday was the first day of wandering STAR Unleavened Bread (a day of rest), and Saturday was the weekly fixed STAR sabbath (a day of rest). The film I am promoting (The Star of Bethlehem) is on the right track, but they conclude Jesus died in 33AD instead of 34AD. I present my case for 34AD above.",1467936000,,3069,4.3954305799648505

The mind blowers for me are toward the end of the DVD and in the extras BUT you have to listen and watch the whole thing for it to come together in beautiful harmony.  Take notes.  This brilliant man explains it all quickly so someone like me can remember what was said just minutes before but the detail is such that I'm so glad I wrote verses & detail down so I could take more time to study and read it later.  I'm still gleaning so much and ask God to continue to build up my mind with these truths so He can use it to draw others to Himself.

The author uses scripture for clues and then uses state-of-the-art astronomy software to look at the actual skies in Jerusalem to actually see what the planets and constellations were doing at Christ's birth, which was approximately 3 BC due to problems with the Gregorian calendar. The DVD is very easy to follow as the author shows us step by step what he was looking for and why, as well as why other hypotheses can be discarded as being the Bethlehem star such as meteors, comets, etc. An amazing surprise as well was the fact that the skies also show an actual eclipse of the sun at Christ's death as recorded in scriptures as well as other interesting phenomena in the skies at the time, not only at Christ's birth but also at his death! A MUST have for any Christian. Very good for skeptics as well.",1441843200,,938,4.556213017751479

2918086,5,B000UAE7IQ,With all that is happening this is a great addition as a source for those who are curious about what the stars tell us.  The ancient people understood the signs in the heavens.  Docudrama from a lawyer who was tired of the commercialism of Christmas. He decides to investigate the star of Bethlehem  he shows us what the star looked like not only then but other times such as when Jesus was crucified.  Interesting that just last week the star of Bethlehem appeared again after 2000 years- if the news didn't report it as such the. Look it up & you will see.  This docudrama was so good I purchased additional DVDs as gifts for those in ministry.  Wonderful for even skeptics.,1436313600,,676,4.5

2918093,2,B000UAE7IQ,"First, let me say that I believe fully in the inerrancy and truthfulness of the Bible.  And, I have no doubt that Mr. Larson loves Jesus, but as a professor of New Testament, allow me to respectfully register some serious reservations:
1. The verses about the heavens/stars declaring the glory of God are not about some specific event predicted by celestial patterns, but about the wisdom and power of God displayed in creation.
2. Mr. Larson does not respect the specific meanings of the inspired authors in the texts he discusses.  For example, he takes Revelation 12:1 to be a code about the the constellation virgo, a literal moon, etc... If so, he is the first one in the history of the world to understand this passage (as he seems to claim).  Is it not more likely that this is apocalyptic imagery which the apostle John expected his original audience to understand?  John did not write something that could only be understood after a computer model showed us where virgo would be in a daylit sky.
3. Similar to the ""Bible Code"" approach to the Bible, if you look long enough with enough computer models, and enough creative re-interpretation of the biblical text and your other medium (constellations or letter patterns), you can find confirmation of whatever you are searching for.
4. Larson's very questionable interpretive method only works when he dates the birth of Jesus differently from virtually all scholars in the world - both liberals and conservatives.
This is only a sampling of my hesitations, but I felt I should express them.  I'm thankful Mr. Larson loves Jesus and wants others to know about him.  But, I do not think his approach to the Bethlehem star is faithful to the inspired biblical authors' intent.",1434412800,12,1732,4.83445945945946

This will probably make the hair stand up on your arms, but as for me- I cannot watch it without tears & I'm a dude, Veteran & an X-Trucker!",1429833600,,490,4.4222222222222225
2918151,5,B000UAE7IQ,"I loved Frederick Larson's presentation.  First, he is simply genius in some of his observations.  I know that much of this work was not original to him, nor does he claim that it is.  I have read some of the books and articles that probably first caught Rick's attention, they have been out there for some number of decades.  Still, Mr. Larson gives a remarkable presentation of this material, with expansive comments and observations which I have seen and heard no-where else.

Thank you for pointing out the differences in the Greek and Latin versions of Josephus; I looked up that author's paper on the subject and was blessed.  Everyone here can purchase a copy of it by buying ""Chronos Kairos Christos II"" Sep 1, 1998.  The article on Josephus' dating variants is included as one of the chapters of this book and it is available here on Amazon.

I loved this video, and I cried.  I cry still when I watch it.  Rick is right, the ""scholars"" don't treat the Bible seriously.  I am not Seminary taught either, but I too have made some discoveries about the Gospels that are entirely unique to my work.  My work, amazingly, matches Rick's work to a T.  I hope that when I publish, soon, that I will be able to share my discoveries with Mr. Larson personally.  I want to let him know what an encouragement his work has been to me.  I hope to be looking you up soon, Rick.

To everyone else, buy 10 copies, and give them away as gifts.  Have your entire congregation watch this video together at a Sunday night service.  Watch it over and over until you can explain it to your co-workers, friends and family.  This is truly a wonderful work of scholarship.",1429833600,6,1656,4.496644295302014

That is probably why this man has been asked to lecture at churches and Christians organizations, all over the U.S.A. and I think I remember in other countries as well.  He explains how he came to these conclusions.  He shows where in the Bible he got the answers.  This took him years of studying and finding the clues, right there in the Bible.  My eldest son is a pastor and has shown this film to all the youth groups in his church.  Many of the youth went to their parents,  right after their study group,  and told them that they had to buy this film.  They did.  When I saw this film I cried, to see how all the pieces fit together, perfectly.  Don't have a talkative audience because this film is a very interesting lecture that you want to give your undivided attention to.v It will blow you away.  You may want to watch it twice in the same day, to understand most everything he is talking about.  Share this with other Christians,  and to plant the seeds in others.
P.S. This will answer why Herod had to ask the wise men,  when they found the child,  to tell him where he was.  If it was just one huge star that everyone could see in the sky,  then why would Herod have to ask the wise men to tell him where Christ was?",1423008000,,1268,4.2125

Utilizing 21st century technology, it is now possible to provide evidence of a plausible answer to this puzzle; while at the same time glorifying God's majesty, as he perfectly wove together the heavenly bodies to create this one-time phenomenon.",1421020800,,559,5.054347826086956

This is so dramatic that I've seen people try to explain it away with no reasoning. Be prepared for very fast talking. And it could be confusing if you have no frame of reference to astronomy or astrology. However, hang in there to get past the first 20-30 minutes and then hold on.",1420502400,,453,4.404761904761905

Contrary to the info in the product description, this particular DVD, formatted as it is for Region 0 (international), will not play 'normal' Closed Captions. I tried it on three separate and entirely different players and got zip for captions. I personally need the CC function to work, especially when the dialog is as rapid-fire as Larson's presentation is. Unless and until Amazon.com makes available the Region One version, available from the author's website, I cannot give this one any better rating. To the credit of Amazon.com (no pun intended) I got immediate and hassle-free return and refund when this point was made to them.

Also watch the videos: The Search for the REAL Mt. SINAI, and The Exodus Revealed.

While I would not make this explanation an ""article of faith"", it's hard to come up with another explanation for the Star that is as good as this one.  This explanation using God's existing creation is as wondrous to me as any miraculously created event.  Given the clues that appear in the Bible, one could wonder if we were not intended to figure this out eventually.  Mr. Larson may indeed have.  The presentation appears to be a combination of group presentations and personal interviews with Mr. Larson, and therefore is a bit repetitious at times, but that does not detract from the incredible research and conclusions.",1417478400,2,709,4.97457627118644

This documentary style video shows how Fred Larson and some predecessors applied technology to nail down the precise times and other specifics of several key historical events memorialized in the Bible.  Having now reviewed this video easily a dozen times and finding no fault in it, I'm as confident as Fred is that I absolutely know what the Star of Bethlehem was, the exact date and time of day when Jesus died on the cross, and more.  Fred Larson needs some voice lessons to develop his narrator voice.

It is a great combination of some very responsible research in ancient history and astrophysics. The video also shows what was actually happening in the sky when Jesus died. Because of the precision of the movement of the stars and planets we can actually know what the sky looked like at specifice dates, times and places thousands of years ago.

2918497,5,B000UAE7IQ,"Very interesting book on how the star may have formed by natural occurrence, but especially on the birth of Christ.  Would God not just use a natural alignment of stars and planets on a particular cycle of movement of the stars and planets?  Maybe.  This DVD shows how going back in time on the computer sky maps to a date when the birth of Christ happened could have created a bright configuration in the sky.  It is not carved in stone, and I am open to a miraculous star that moved in the heavens and stopped over Bethlehem.

I would put him on the same plateau. I stay in the word. Talk to anyone I see about the word. And I am baptized and joined my church 40 years ago. All things can be done thru Christ. He gave his life for us. I can't imagine anything like that. I have faith and hope and prayer that all this anger will stop. Animal will be saved. And people will be saved. Behold I stand at the door and knock whosoever hears me and let's me in will have everlasting life. Amen. All these things are my thoughts.,1409443200,,639,4.039370078740157

2918534,5,B000UAE7IQ,"There has been much speculation over centuries about what the star that shown over Bethlehem at the time of the birth of Jesus might actually have been.  This presentation gives a well thought out defended explanation of how the alignment of planets and stars in that time period would have been unusual enough and symbolic enough to get the attention of the Magi and prompt them to make a long journey from the East.  Several other explanations such as a comet or a nova are considered and discounted.  For one thing, it had to be pointed out the Herod, but he was then able to confirm the signs with his own astronomers.

The explanation is presented in a compelling way, and some of the symbolism is absolutely profound.  Ultimately, it would indicate that the timing for the events of the birth and the crucifixion was determined when the planets were first placed into their orbits, so when Jesus said ""my time has not yet come"" for entering Jerusalem, we can understand just how fixed and just how precise that timing actually was.  If you are looking for evidence for God and for the deity of Christ that are outside the Bible, this will fulfill that purpose.

Similar to the mystery lost in time but solved centuries later of the statues at Easter Island being 'walked' upright from the stone quarries to where they were put on display, this DVD provides a detailed explanation that has so many pieces that fit well together that it is not easily dismissed.",1409097600,,1465,4.655038759689923
2918535,5,B000UAE7IQ,An amazing look into what the skies looked like at the birth of Christ.  The research that went into this video will intrigue you and inform you at the same time.

2918536,5,B000UAE7IQ,"I've been studying this subject for years, and have looked at other works on the subject including those proposing an alternate date like Filmer and Martin.  I came to the conclusion long ago that the 4 BC date for Herod's death was incorrect, and it's been great to see the sea change toward a 2 or 1 BC date.  I agree with every single point in the video - which is rare for me on a subject like this.  It covers a lot of detail of history and astronomy and biblical data, yet it's presented on a level that anyone can grasp.

Quality of the video is not bad for what it is.  Production is decent.  It's mostly done in lecture style, but it kept my attention throughout and mixed in decent graphics and interview footage.  Highly recommended.",1408752000,3,744,4.3478260869565215

2918592,4,B000UAE7IQ,This is not a super professional put together film but the content is very good and informative. It's just a filming of a lecture he is giving with some out takes for further explanation. Because of that you sometimes cannot hear him as he is talking to his audience and not the camera. He does not speak as clearly as an actor would but we can forgive him that. He also did not fully go over all nine of the criteria for the star.

I donated copies to my 3 parishes.  One of my pastors held a showing at the Church just before Christmas.  The other 2 have it as a loaner in the parish library - one of these two put a note about how great it is - a must see - in the parish bulletin.  If you are looking for some ""proof"" or just want to marvel at God's plan of salvation set in place at the moment of creation, this is the DVD.  I'd give it 6 stars if they'd let me.

  There is a student in the Catholic University of America (CUA)  working on some studies with astrology/astronomy.  It was mentioned  to me by a professor  at the  School  of  Architecture of CUA.  Would it be possible to send this book  as a gift for this CUA  student's  research? I do not have the detailed  info of  this student.

With the help of technology, he has been able to go back in time and view the heavens at the time of the birth of Christ and see what most likely happened to cause the bright ""star"" and how the star could have stopped.  It is both fascinating and inspiring.  He also shows how God could have caused the darkness at the time of Jesus' crucifixion.

2918630,4,B000UAE7IQ,"Overall, I feel positive about this idea, and when I am about to review something I felt was worth seeing or hearing, I like to look at some of the one or two star reviews to figure out why others are not impressed. Same with things I didn't care for: I read a handful of five star comments to see if I can figure out what I'm missing. In my 13 years of experience as an Amazon reviewer, I've found that religious books or films draw the most extreme reactions, pro or con, and that's true here. Some of the negative folks did not like the fact that there were Roman Catholics involved in this production, or preferred scriptural references not chosen by the presenter. Some of the fans of ""The Star"" were just appreciative that something promoting traditional Christianity even gets made in modern times. We do not KNOW absolutely that Jesus lived or died exactly as the Biblical books describe, for they do not fully agree with each other about it. At least in this life, the exact truth remains a mystery in terms of what most of us consider hard evidence. The human mind is a wondrous and varied instrument: some never depart from the church of their parents, some run as far from that as they can get. Some decide that no serious relationship with ""religion"" or ""the divine"" is needed for their happiness or their future beyond this world. Others bounce from church to church, like me: Presbyterian until 20, Catholic until 40, spiritualist for three years, on-line Unitarian for six, now attending (but not truly believing) a religious science expression (NOT Scientology.) I've always been fascinated with the Jesus story and His enduring claim on the hearts of billions, yet ""worship services"" have always left me kind of bored: the hymns have too many repetitious verses, the sermons have little spark, the prayers seem forced. I have no better explanation for this other than that I am a lazy, bad person. But I have read hundreds of pounds of religious books, have owned dozens of Christian CD's, and ponder the so-called ""eternal questions"" more than is healthy. Watching ""The Star"" is a way of pondering one more spiritual mystery, and I spent as much time reading some of its reviews as I did watching the show. If you are ""not sure"" the Bible is literally true in every word and phrase, but might be true in some, and if you tend to believe that the bulk of the religions we know of are more man-made than God- made, yet you can't shake the feeling that life has a purpose beyond the physical and part of us lives on, you are a bit like me. And I am glad I watched ""The Star.""",1395964800,,2591,4.538461538461538

2918645,5,B000UAE7IQ,"I have long had an interest of the planets and the moon and suns movements and especially the constellations and how did people from so long ago come to identify them as Aries or Leo or Orion , etc.  . I have only been a ""believer"" for a very short time of 34 years , which in perspective is not even on the charts of time . To have these connections and the understanding provided as The Scriptures confirm themselves / explain themselves in the light of these events blows my mind !  What a marvelous and unpretentious and perfect work Mr. Larson has done in his investigative work . The 5 stars allowed for his work cannot begin to convey my deepest satisfaction with his honest and open documentary ! I loved the way he questioned everything and then set out to prove or disprove what information was there in the Scriptures . Just Marvelous to me as I also love to uncover the things that lay hidden ,waiting for us to figure out . Prove or dis-prove . Openly , Honestly , without harm to others . No deceptions .  Loved his work and have quite joyfully shared this with others . Thank You , Mr. Larson .",1394064000,2,1109,4.271428571428571
2918646,3,B000UAE7IQ,"Hello,  My wife and I enjoyed this video, but didn't find it terribly convincing.  The presenter (who seems, by the way, rather pompous with his constant reiteration of ""Mr. Larsen"") is one of those people who often reasons from statements like: it seems clear or it stands to reason, and then works from those statements as if they were facts.  This is not the best kind of rigorous logic! Also, Mr Larsen is not, as he several times says, an astronomer. He works from a layperson's computer sky chart!  I think we can leave the weaknesses there.  On the other hand, the video is, for the most part ,pleasantly done.  It won't convince a skeptic, but it's not completely insulting to a thoughtful person.",1393891200,4,705,4.645161290322581

2918757,5,B000UAE7IQ,"Great for anyone with a scientific mind that is also a believer. Good scholarship, and just enough said about the author's personal journey of faith to draw you to the same conclusions. A very feasible explanation for what happened centuries ago, based on today's knowledge of astronomy. The Scripture references give a real foundation to the facts as they unfold. Usually we think Scripture first and stop there. This presentation supports and gives a proof of sorts to the skeptic of what we already believe from Scripture and Sacred tradition. No statement of what faith Mr. Larson is, but I suppose that is intentionally done to appeal to a wider audience without putting any group off. We had kids from age 12-18 watch it and they were glued to it. My adult friends as well thoroughly enjoyed it, and it made for lively discussions for us.",1390435200,,844,4.787671232876712

2918760,4,B000UAE7IQ,"The content is amazing.  Reccomend highly.
But!  Mr Larson needs to get a good video editor and let him (her) cut this thing down.
Sir, I say this with the greatest respect, but you drone on with unessential detail.  The first thing you learn
as a script writer or editor (I've done both) is that every scene, every bit of dialog needs to move the story forward.
There is so much extraneous stuff that it takes away from the almost increadible scientific revelation.

One more suggestion:  my favorite part is the well hidden extra bit on the heart of the ""lamb"".  After you
remove the useless detail, you should work it into the main part.  I suspect most people don't ever discover it.

Please forgive my blunt approach.  I only hope you will consider this dispassionate advice.  This is truly a five
star video if you will just let go of all the precious nuggets.  They may be precious parts of the journey to you
but the interfere with the message.

I think the extra bit mentioned above by itself is worth the price of the DVD.",1390262400,,1032,4.459893048128342

Larson's presentation is insightful, professional and reveals the depth of his investigative quest.  The efforts of his years-long study is rewarded with light into the Bible's clues to how the ""Wise Men"" tracked the stars, the Constellations they watched and the dates of the probable visit.  Very interesting and although it is too important to simply say ""entertaining"" the net result is that time flies past and the hour long presentation never gets boring.

It is so interesting & while the subject is of a religious nature, Larson appeals to our understanding by approaching it with science.

It was in a lecture setting with an audience and it seems to be just a part of a longer presentation.  Or, I could only hope so because it was sorely lacking.

I finally decided to take notes while watching it so I could keep up with everything!  It is certainly worth watching, re-watching, and sharing with others.  Just as Mr. Larson says in the movie, the cool thing you can take away from the research in this video is that we can ""press the Scriptures really hard"" and they hold up over time.  I am a student of God's Word and a teacher by trade, and I would highly recommend this wonderful documentary.  God's Word is true and sufficient, but what a privilege to have technology available to us now to see what the sky would have looked like around Christ's birth. It gives us just another glimpse of what an awesome Creator we have, yet there is so much more that we can't even fathom. I give this film 5 Stars!  However, I must say, that there is a LOT of information included in this presentation, and there will be some viewers (mostly the younger ones), who will have a hard time digesting this information.  Still, it's an excellent springboard for learning and further study of the Scriptures regarding the Nativity story and the Star of Bethlehem.",1388620800,2,1208,4.493150684931507

But putting the star into a natural setting, and asking, ""So why would these guys do this?"" over and over made a fascinating presentation. I bought several copies to share. Too good not to see!

2918859,1,B000UAE7IQ,"The man gives a very interesting presentation and I don't doubt that some of his points may have some Truth to them in their relationship to the Star of Bethlehem.  That being said when God's Word is taken out of context in order to help create his point (which has no solid Biblical foundation, but a shaky at best) and as a believer I am called to take every thought captive and submit it to the authority of God's Word, the points in this film fall short.  For me and my household, based upon our understanding and study of scripture, this movie is unprofitable because it takes God's Holy word out of context.

  To be specific (this is one example) when he presents the prophecy in Joel (2:31) and states that in Acts 2:22 Peter is saying that the crowd had witnessed the miracles and signs described in Joel.  It is clear to me that Peter was not saying they had seen the signs concerning blood, smoke, vapor, fire, and the moon but rather he uses the verse to validate that them speaking in tongues by the Holy Spirit was prophesied and Biblically affirmed.  Revelation chapter 12 and ALL of Joel chapter 2, as well as more scripture which tells us what the Day of the Lord is gives us understanding to know that the description of the moon turning to blood on the Day of the Lord refers to Jesus' second coming and is not an event that Peter was telling the crowd at Pentecost that they had witnessed.

Again this is just one example, please forgive my explanation as it may be poorly written.  There may be some Truth to the things he is discussing, but be careful brothers and sisters for :

Matthew 15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. 16 You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles? 17 So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. 18 A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.

If you find this profitable for you and your family eternally, I encourage you to look at the fruits of this mans life and I hope it will be exposed to you that he is sincere and his message is True, or that it is false and not edifying.

This video in my mind confirms that astrology to an extent is real.  Now we just need to study the ANCIENT stuff instead of modern psychological astrology that we all know is not accurate at prediction.

The wizards or magi (wise men) that found Jesus were ancient masters of stellar ritual and astrology, and could use The
Word (mantras) to create miracles for the benefit of all sentient beings.  In the Revelation of the Magi by Dr. Landau an ancient syriac document circa 300 a.d. was found that chronicals the journey of the magicians from Shir to Bethleham to pay tribute to the baby avatar, Jesus.  I think Jesus has been here many times, and is worshiped in many faiths.

2918957,1,B000UAE7IQ,"The Flawed Star of Rick Larson

When it comes to these types of alluring videos, you always have a bit of truth mingled with many lies. This is how the deceiver grips the hearts of those who do not fully understand their Bibles from Genesis 1:1 to Revelation 22:21. This is why true Christians must diligently study to show themselves approved unto God. We are not commanded to know the things of this wretched culture; however, we are commanded to love God and study His Word with an accurately translated version.

Of course, the Holy Spirit tugs at true believers' hearts when something sounds amiss when being taught, if they are walking hand in hand with their Savior.

Regarding this DVD, you must know that it was produced by an idolatrous, Catholic man--Stephen McEveety. You cannot expect truth to arise from a man who falsely worships the Mary of the Catholic Church and other satanic deities. God declares, idolaters are shut out of heaven--Revelation 21:8, 22:15, 1 Corinthians 6:9, etc. Please, also study 2 Corinthians chapter 6, verses 14f.

When referencing ""The Star of Bethlehem"" it is ""His Star,"" or the Star of Jesus Christ. (Matthew chapter 2, verses 1 and 2) Christ's bright and shinning star could go by no other regalia name; He being King of kings and LORD of lords.

It appeared when God created it and it shined for Christ's preordained time. No one knows when God turned off its light. God is omnipotent (all powerful) and omniscient (all knowing) and omnipresent (everywhere present). The earth is simply His footstool. (Acts 7:48-49)

The star's appearance induced the wise men to recognize the Biblical prophecies of the arriving Messiah-King. It was the vehicle by which they could come and worship God the Son, the universe Creator--Colossians chapter 1.

It takes faith to believe the Word of God. Sinful man desires to make little of the miraculous or eliminates it altogether. The unregenerate will simply give a so-called logical explanation. Catholics fruitlessly attempt to explain away the miracles of Scripture or make fun of them. This exposes why the lies are presented within this video.

Another subject Rick Larson addresses is the date of the appearing of the wise men at the home of the new family. It is unbelievably ridiculous for him to speculate that they arrived on Joseph's doorstep on December 25. No one knows the date. No star or group of stars can speak to us when it transpired, just as stars cannot speak to when an uncle last visited your home. Additionally, the stars cannot inform us of the number of days the magi remained in Israel.

It is true, as stated in the video, that the time was sometime following the birth of Jesus Christ. The family was in a home, not in a stable, as recorded in Scripture. (Matthew 2:10)

No one additionally knows for sure how many wise men presented themselves. It could have been a small or large number. They did create quite the stir, so it may have been a profuse company. They did bring three precious gifts for the precious child.

Rick Larsen appears to know little regarding some textual specifics. He totally misinterpreted Revelation Chapter 12.

The arriving events of this chapter will involve Israel. The first verses expound on that which is not revealed elsewhere in Scripture regarding the birth of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world through the Jewish nation.

The twelve stars referred to in 12:1 are the twelve tribes of Israel. Mary is not mentioned here, only the nation and Jesus Christ are the principal subject matters. In verses 2-5, we observe satan futilely attempting to destroy Jesus Christ at this birth through satan's dramatic ways of wrath.

Traversing further into this chapter, we read of Christ's eternal glorification and Israel's dreadful trials during the arriving, tribulation apocalypse. This includes the evil one maneuvering to destroy God's chosen people, the Jews, with a flood. God will graciously have the earth drink the rapids in rescue.

Satan's hateful, murderous, destructive power plays are the subject matter. Satan is not King Herod as Rick Larsen teaches. Herod did not have a long tail that hit 1/3 of the heavenly stars, causing them to fall to the earth due to his anger with the birthing of the Savior. This was satan's act of vile disrespect. Satan hates all that is morally right. He continually battles for control of everything. We do acknowledge through Scripture, Herod being an instrument implemented by satan in an assassination plot of infanticide to eliminate God the Son.

Few churches today bring the holy story of Christ's birth before the pulpit; whereby, all Scriptures are referenced regarding the nativity. This opens the door to grafted-in deception and the apostasy of the church.

Unfortunately, many fellowships want to add a great deal of fantasy or mysticism to the event to belittle it or to add a New Age frame to it.

Catholics do not believe Israel is God's chosen nation. They believe the Roman Church is God's chosen. They will not acknowledge the Jews prominent place in the book of Revelation and elsewhere.

Jesus Christ will rule from Jerusalem for a thousand years as her LORD and King. He will be Regent of all the earth; Zechariah chapters 12 and 14, Revelation chapter 20, etc.

Rick Larson has received Catholic praise for uplifting the goddess, Mary. He is applauded for exalting Mary through the star Virgo--translated ""virgin."" This is Mariology worship. This star, Mary, is illuminated by the sun according to Larson. This is the heresy of the Catholic Church.

Catholic  commentator--""secondly, when he (Rick Larson) identifies the time of the `woman clothed with the sun,' he figures out that the Virgo constellation is illuminated by the sun and that it is the crescent moon that is under the the Virgin's feet.""

It is all about Jesus Christ, not Mary, though we acknowledge Mary of the Scriptures was a godly woman. She did marry Joseph and had other children as a human mother, not different from other godly women who have lived on the earth. Though, of course, she was God's designated, virgin agent for the most blessed and miraculous birth in history. Mary did call Christ her ""Savior,"" being, she too needed to be redeemed as a lost sinner to receive eternal life in heaven.

I conclude with reminding, Christians are to live by faith, not by interpretive astronomy, astrology or Mariology.",1373414400,17,6403,4.901942645698427

2918985,5,B000UAE7IQ,"This is a very well done presentation by Rick Larson which explains in detail a strong theory as to when Jesus was born and when He was crucified. There is a large amount of information that is given in just over one hour, but with some diligent investigation, you will be rewarded over and over.

This is a two-part DVD, and as such, I will divide my review into two sections.

PART 1: THE BIRTH OF JESUS CHRIST (THE START OF BETHLEHEM):

I cannot underscore the resources that are available at Rick Larson's website enough. If you don't know the web address, simply search for, ""BethlehemStar Rick Larson"". There is a treasure trove of information for those who would like to go deeper into this.

Mr. Larson is to some degree standing on the shoulders of giants. He undoubtedly used information from Ernest Martin's book, ""The star that astonished the world"", but he has added value to it and has presented it in a nicely done, visual presentation. One of his initial assertions that is hotly debated is that King Herod died in 1BC and not 4BC. This is a crucial point since it either puts Christ's death before 4BC or allows it to happen up until 1BC. Larson does a good job defending his 1BC position both in the video and on his website.

The information flows quickly so this next part can easily be missed:

He assigns dates to 3 major occurrences using A) The latest astronomical software, and B) The biblical text.
These three are:

1) The conception of Marry by the Holy Spirit. (Jupiter 'the king planet' circling Regulas 'the king star' in the constellation Leo the lion.

2) The birth of Jesus. (Jupiter and Venus 'the mother planet' conjunction to create the brightest ""star"" of anyone's lifetime then.)

3) The visit of the wise men. When Jupiter actually appeared to STOP above Bethlehem when viewing from Jerusalem.

There is a foundational issue that you must personally come to peace with to fully accept these and other assertions put forward by Larson. This is the notion that God uses the stars, moon, sun, and planets as signs or signals to us. This is perfectly in line with the scriptures. Read Genesis 1:14-15. Also, much prophecy is described in terms of astronomical happenings such as ""Blood Moons"", ""The sun turning to darkness"", ""The stars falling from the heavens"", etc. In fact, if you're apprehensive about Larson's talk of the Zodiac, and you're so inclined to research the matter, conservative biblical scholar Dr. James Kennedy wrote a book in 1989 entitled, ""The real meaning of the Zodiac"" which investigates the history of this mostly misunderstood topic and how it relates to the bible.

In my opinion, Larson's narrative is compelling, captivating, and well researched. I believe that we can now know the exact dates of all of these happenings due to what is recorded in Matthew and elsewhere in the bible.

PART 2: THE CRUCIFIXION OF JESUS (THE DAY OF THE CROSS)

In this 13 or so minute presentation, Larson lays out the theory for a June 3rd, 33AD crucifixion. It requires a belief that Jesus was crucified on a Friday (and not on a Wednesday). I will again refer you to his website for a wealth of information to unpack this section. Basically though, he gives 4 reasons why the 33AD date is valid for the crucifixion of Jesus. These are:

1) The description of when the Passover and crucifixion took place according to the 4 gospels; (This actually only narrows it to either 30AD or 33AD)
2) The geo-political conflicts that arose between Pilate, Tiberius Caesar, and Sajanus point to 33AD
3) The ""prophecy of weeks"" spoken of in Daniel 9 point to the year 33AD (assuming that there was such a thing as an ""Ascension Year"" for Babylonian kings during Daniel's time.
4) Astronomical events that took place on the day/night of crucifixion that were prophesied hundreds of years prior.

This part is very well done, and you must, MUST, MUST watch the bonus track to get the full effect and understanding of what happened.

My only disappointment with this part of the video is when Larson tries to describe the Joel chapter 2 prophecy. The prophecy not only says that there will be a blood moon ""before the great and glorious day of the Lord"", but is says that the sun will be turned to DARKNESS. Well, you can't have a lunar AND solar eclipse at the same time! What's going on with the darkness part? The reason this is important is that many bible prophecy scholars (such as 119 Ministries in their 'Last Days' videos) use this verse for the 2nd coming of Christ - not the crucifixion. I wish Larson would have possibly made mention to the letter - a copy of which is in the Library of Congress - between Pontius Pilate and Tiberius Caesar mentioning the day turning to night when Christ was crucified. This discrepancy or omission is my biggest quarrel with the video.

IN CONCLUSION:
Rick Larson has put together a fascinating look at the dates of Christ's birth and death using the biblical texts and the latest astronomical software to decode these records. Thank you so much, Mr. Larson! May God bless you!",1368230400,,5058,4.690744920993228

Very worthwhile dvd, especially for the cinics, and athiests who always attack peole for believing. Steve Miz",1367193600,,299,5.0
2918989,5,B000UAE7IQ,"I'd never heard most of the information in this DVD about the astronomical signs that accompanied the first Christmas. It is definitely not a simple repeat of the Bible story, but an explanation of the scientific evidence that confirms that historicity of the familiar account. God's sovereignty is affirmed as His involvement in nature and prophecy are examined in detail.",1366934400,,373,5.233333333333333

2918994,5,B000UAE7IQ,This is much like a college lecture in style but will blow you away with knowledge that prove the scriptures to be acurate at a level we never fully understood without today's technology. Ask the disbelivers to disprove these facts and they will stumble and fall. Hopefully curiousity will be blossomed from this CD,1365379200,,315,4.851851851851852

But this brings out scientific data that he is multiples beyond anything I have ever imagined.  the significance of what I saw has had real implications for my life as I realize just how safe and secure I am in the depth of his love.  This Larson production gives greater attestation to the veracity of the bible in new ways for me.  If you like treasure hunts, this search of the cause of the movement of the start for the 3 magi and the cause of its stopping over Bethlehem, is astounding.
  Even greater was the final conclusion of the movie and the amazing orchestration of the entire planetary system. Also astounding is the story of a 1600 mathematician who came us with the mathematical equation that explains the rotational interplay between all of the stars and the ability to know exactly where each one will be on any date and hour moving both forward and backward.  It was the same equation used for our sending a craft to mars 400 years later.
  Your Christian friends will be especially touched by the terrific and documentation in ways that will certainly bolster their faith.",1364601600,,1166,4.5673076923076925

2919026,5,B000UAE7IQ,"This DVD will blow your mind.  It can explain, even to skeptics, how even science backs up the Biblical birth and times of Jesus--as it was told literally in the stars. .I would've liked the documentary to have been filmed in a different setting, but the story is quite fascinating.  Very much worth watching, and passing along.",1363824000,,328,4.7368421052631575

2919028,5,B000UAE7IQ,"A friend recommended this to us...I had never heard of it.  I tried to get it on Netflix but it was a VERY long wait so we bought it on the recommendation that it was worth owning.  Our friend was right!  The beginning is a little slow, he takes quite a while to get to his point but it does lay a good ground for those who may know nothing about stars.  This is not a heady or boring astronomy lesson, bear with it through the beginning and consider the wonder of our Lord and God who has such attention to details (God is in the details!).  It amazed me that all of this can go on and that God has allowed us to discover it! Really cool!  I won't say more because if I do, it will give it away but I do recommend to see it.  A great witnessing tool to help others see that God is infinately more than we can imagine or think.

The concept of the study is one that intrigues me.  If we can use this NASA program to look at star pattern from the past, can we look at them for the future?  Could be a tool to understand the timing of certain prophetic events to come.  Just sayin'  :)",1363046400,,1083,3.9400921658986174
2919029,5,B000UAE7IQ,"This video is inspiring and informative.  My wife and I were amazed all over again at the sovereign power and planning of God.  The video shows that God's divine plan is so much more beautiful than we suspect.  I highly recommend this video to believers and skeptics, especially those with a scientific bent.  I believe science reveals the wisdom, knowledge and majesty of God and this video is firmly within that same mindset.",1363046400,,427,4.808219178082192

The author demonstrates how to use general astronomy software to view the same key astronomical events shown in the video. He explains the why, how, and when... again, you just have to see for yourself. Don't want to spoil the surprise.. also, check out the bonus section on the DVD.

2919034,5,B000UAE7IQ,"My husband brought this DVD home from his men's group and we watched it together.  We were blown away!  It starts out a bit slowly, and it is a lecture with photos, not a movie, but by the end we were actually tingling and thinking about buying a copy for ourselves, people we wanted to share it with, showing it at our church, etc.  There is bonus material, which we also watched.  By all means, watch the bonus The Ram.  I think this would be great for revivals (not in a charismatic way) in the church.  Scientific, so it may also be of interest to skeptics.  Can't say enough good about this.  Especially if you are a Christian, you will not regret buying this DVD - and sharing it with your family and friends.",1362355200,,715,4.2835820895522385

Highly recommend, but could have watched a shorter video and it have done just as well.",1361318400,,226,4.380952380952381
2919055,5,B000UAE7IQ,"This shows a scientific approach to the Star of Bethlehem.  Yes, God, who can do anything, could also have timed the birth of Christ to coincide with the stars (actually planets).  What is truly fascinating is how the narrator ties it all together, explaining the science with the scripture in the Bible.  At the end, make sure you watch the special feature!",1361232000,,358,4.741935483870968

Before it ended I had a list of people I just had to give a copy of this to.  This isn't a Christmas story, it's not entertainment, there aren't any famous actors, it is the true story of how the stars aligned not only for Christ's birth, but for his death as well.

2919071,5,B000UAE7IQ,"Dr. Larson makes a powerful case for the Biblical event and for what happened day of Christ's Crucifixion and at the moment of His death. Although Christian thought, like Jewish thought, can vary widely if the mistake in Flavius Josephus' history regarding the death of Herod the Great can be substantiated then Dr. Larson has made his case.
Dr. Larson's website has an abundance of well documented historical amplification notes that those with a passion for history will find both helpful and illuminating.

2919084,5,B000UAE7IQ,"As a film goes it was brilliant - well produced, moved at a good pace, and told a great story.  As a documented detective story it was very cogent and persuasive.  As an inspirational piece it was second to none.

It totally convinced me - 'The Star' was a very real sign (actually signs) that occurred in history. In one sense there was nothing miraculous about it - it was fore-ordained in the clockwork mechanism of the universe.  But it WAS miraculous in that it was foretold, and that the coming of Jesus into this world was heralded in such an un-mistakeable way, and that it actually did lead the wise men to Bethlehem.",1359676800,2,626,4.464912280701754

2919088,5,B000UAE7IQ,"This documentary is a very good treatise of what the star of Bethlehem might have been. With the latest star map software, the author has made a reasonable guess at what happened in the sky to alert the Magi to the Jewish King's birth, as well as what might have happened astronomically on the day of the crucifixion. Well worth the time to take a look.",1359158400,,353,4.363636363636363
2919089,4,B000UAE7IQ,"The research for this DVD is extensive and quite convincing. The DVD itself is pretty crude, but well worth the viewing.

As a Christian, the star of Bethlehem has always been a ""sticky spot"". Having "" studied"" astronomy some, it just didn't seem possible that something that striking wouldn't have been seen and understood by everyone in that day.  Larson explains that well as only someone, like the ""wise men"" who studied the stars would be aware on the intricate workings of the stars.

I recommend the DVD to anyone interested in astronomy, and those skeptics who writ off the scriptural truth of Jesus because of the "" impossibilities"".",1359158400,4,642,4.871559633027523

2919105,5,B000UAE7IQ,This is an amazing documentary. Captivating and compelling ideas. The quality of video and the research on this topic make this product a great buy.,1358467200,,148,4.96

I am very grateful for how lawyer Frederick Larson delved into this subject with much gusto & I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the God of all creation & how He ""prepared"" all that we have before the foundations of the earth!  He is awesom & worthy of our praise & worship.  We will never unlock all our questions about mankind & the universe we live in this side of heaven, but God allows us to ""discover"" the truths of His Word as we live out our lives here on earth.  Only what's done for Christ will last...so, Have a Good Day!!!",1358467200,,706,4.318181818181818
2919107,5,B000UAE7IQ,This was most interesting.  And he backed himself up with proof.  Took you step by step through the bible and science to prove it.  Most interesting.,1358380800,,149,4.653846153846154
2919108,5,B000UAE7IQ,"What if you could look back in time to see what the Magi (""wise men"") saw?

What if you could find the sky signs that led them to Bethlehem?

What if you could know what was in the heavens over Jerusalem when Jesus Christ was crucified? Did the sky really darken?

What if you could explore the stars and maybe learn about what God is like?

Well you can.

Because today with astronomy software we can see the sky at different times and places including when Jesus, the Messiah, lived on earth.

So if you search long enough, in the right way, you might find the sky at the time when Christ was conceived. You might find the sky when He was born. And you might find what was in the sky over Bethlehem when the Magi rode forth into that village to find Him.

You might even find what was in the sky on the day of His crucifixion.

Well, somebody did that search.

His name is Frederick A. Larson. He's a law professor who set out to solve a mystery: Was there really a ""Star of Bethlehem""? Did it really ""stop,"" like the Bible says?

""Can a star stop? It can and it did, and I'm going to show you,"" Larson says.

And then he does.

After making discoveries, Rick Larson was welcomed to many places throughout the world, and was asked to tell the story he had found.

Out of that was born ""The Star of Bethlehem"" DVD.

In its beginning, Larson says, ""I'm going to be your guide to one of the great mysteries: the Star of Bethlehem."" He next takes you on a journey far beyond the moon--without leaving your home.

A great guide, Larson's well-organized, with a passion for the subject and a love for his listeners. He shows those in his audience what the software showed him. Larson has a knack for making interesting ideas understandable.

""The Star of Bethlehem"" is for curious children of all ages.

Atheists and agnostics are welcome.

This DVD doesn't require prior knowledge of astronomy or the Bible. It can be watched again and again, picking up details .

This is not about astrology or the occult--deceitful snares to stay far away from.

This is about the signs God planned for the sky at creation for us to find now.

When searching for the subject ""the Star of Bethlehem"" on the Internet, Rick Larson's Web site is found at the top. His work sparkles above others.

As its back cover shows, ""The Star of Bethlehem"" was called ""wide-ranging and insightful scholarship"" by a former President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, who also was Publisher and Editor of ""Scientific American"" magazine. It also has the Dove Foundation's highest rating.

Larson's web site has an area called ""What People Are Saying,"" clicking the heading ""About"" will bring it up. There are many quotes there and on his home page. They include these and more:

""About 99.9% of the Star of Bethlehem stuff is nutty, but this isn't that. It's well-researched and reasonable"" -- Ronald A. Schorn, Ph. D.

""A convincing case...a mystery solved"" -- Former Director, NASA Dryden Flight Research Center

""Well-researched and reasonable"" -- Former Chief of Planetary Astronomy, NASA, and Technical Editor, Sky & Telescope magazine

""Wide-ranging and insightful scholarship"" -- a former President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

""This explanation of the Star is compelling..."" -- a NASA Chief Engineer for the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station.

Visually powerful, ""The Star"" has a dynamic score by award-winning composer Julie Larson. It is available as a soundtrack called ""In the Fullness of Time""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Fullness-of-Time/dp/B001O54T66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Fullness of Time</a>.

The ""Star of Bethlehem"" has a brief but valuable bonus feature, ""Revealing the Ram"" that might shock you, only in a good way.

Optional Spanish subtitles. For English subtitles, use the TV's closed-captioning setting. Widescreen. About 65 minutes long. Unrated.

The Bible story being revealed here about the Magi and Star is found in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 2; it's the first book of the New Testament. Other Scripture references are given onscreen, though in small print.

""The Star of Bethlehem"" is a rare gem, blending the beauty of science and Scripture into magic of the best kind.

""I think you're going to find this completely fascinating,"" Larson says in the beginning.

I agree: Come and see this film of joyful discovery.

""The Star of Bethlehem"" is brilliant.",1358380800,,4494,4.937416777629827
2919109,5,B000UAE7IQ,"While its introduction could have been more direct in explaining the research and less about why and how the research began, it was a wonderful revelation about something we Christians take for granted with the story we hear from our childhoods. It's a wonderful revelation of one of God's messages; one that's been there since the beginning of His Time! Using Bible Scripture as a reinforcing reference to all Mr. Larson discovered makes it a wonderful Bible study!!  I enjoyed it so much, I bought 2 to give away and kept one to loan.  I've seen it 3 times and each time, I learn a bit more--that's how dense his reference material is!  For me, it's a must see for all Christians!

2919116,1,B000UAE7IQ,"Trying to connect the star that led three ""kings"" to Jesus at his birth with some kind of scientific accuracy is absurd. His exact date of birth is not known. In addition any attempt at legitimizing trek of the three Magi into a positive Christian occurrence borders on blaphemy. First the star: It led the Magi not directly to Jesus but to King Herod first. His desire was to eliminate any possible threat to his kingship. In other words, he wanted Jesus dead. He cunningly tells them that once they locate Jesus, return and notify him so he can honor Jesus also. Then the star directs the Magi to Jesus. However they are directed through a vision not to return to Herod. When Herod realized those ""wise"" men were not returning, he ordered that all males 2 years old and under in Bethlehem be killed. One has to wonder, who would supply a star that would lead to the Messiah's death? Second, the Magi themselves: They were Persian priests of the Zoroaster. That pagan religion relied heavily on astrology, which is strictly forbidden under the Law of Moses. Again one must ask himself, would God use men that practiced acts forbidden in his own law to publicize his Son's birth. Not a chance. The star was provided by God's enemy in an attempt to prevent humankind from receiving salvation.",1357948800,2,1291,4.641921397379913
2919117,5,B000UAE7IQ,"Excellent work.  Obviously thoroughly researched.  This is not a Christmas story, but rather it gives scientific, astronomical evidence for the star that heralded the birth of Jesus Christ, through the use of modern technology.  God's plan for man's redemption through Christ began before He created the world, and this attorney has given verification to any doubting Thomas.",1357862400,,375,5.543859649122807
2919118,3,B000UAE7IQ,"An interesting hypothesis, but it lacks substance.
An entertaining presentation, but dodges questions that are inconvenient to the theory.
And rewriting history in order to make it fit your theory is not good method.

Larson has a fan-base to be sure.
It does not surprise me much that Dallas is included.
It also does not persuade me.
That, by the way, would be to succumb to the propaganda technique called ""bandwagon"".
There are other Biblical scholars, and in my opinion - better scholars, than those at Dallas.

Don't take my word for it: You don't know me from Adam.
And I don't have a slick website, or or polished video to show you.
But there is solid, published (not internet) Scholarship available.
Research it, and THINK.

You are not stuck in a jury box,
you are not part of a sequestered jury pool,
prevented from outside research and discussion.
You are NOT limited by what the Judge and Lawyers want you to know.

Do your own research.
Think for yourself.
Thinking for yourself may mean getting and viewing this video,
but if you do so, then do not stop here as if he has provided the last word.

Larson has taken the time, personally, to point me to his website
(which I already HAD visited)
for more information on why he re-dates the death of Herod the Great.
I have been a student of these matters for decades.
I do not find the arguments for any date other than the 4bc date to be credible.
And I do not intend to argue the point here.

PLEASE, do NOT let Larson be the first and last word for you.
If you want to spend the $11.45 to get the dvd, you may be entertained.
(Price went up after I originally wrote this review)
But don't stop here.
And, by all means THINK.

If you don't like my review, please write one of your own.
You DO have that right, and it may even help others in their evaluations.

But, you don't need to ""answer"" / rebut mine.
Frankly, I don't have time for the argument. (Titus 3:9, 2 Tim 2:24, Proverbs 26:4-14)
And I won't give you the satisfaction.

ADDED NOTE:
By the way,
The following scholarly article is noted in the bibliography on Larson's site,
I will grant that is interesting, and appears to be thorough.
If accepted, it does lend some plausibility to Larson's acceptance of redating Herod's death.
I remain unpersuaded, and would like to see how Steinmann was critiqued in scholarly reviews.

Rick Larson is a likable guy and listening to him lecture is alright, but it gets tiring fast.  It's especially slow in the beginning.

The teacher in this movie makes a mistake when he claims that all four Gospels state that Jesus was crucified on a Friday. That is just not so. It is an erroneous assumption that many Christians have made because the sabbath draws near following His death. However, given that He died during Passover week, there was more than one sabbath. It is wrong to assume it was the weekly sabbath. In fact, it makes no sense, because Jesus could not have been in the tomb for three days and three nights if He was buried Friday and arose before sunlight on Sunday, as the Gospel accounts tell us.

2919177,5,B000UAE7IQ,"Let me begin this with a historical description to serve as introduction to the subject of this DVD.

The main occupation of the Magi was their interpretation of things they considered divine. They principally dealt with the evaluation of dreams, visions and astronomical signs. Astrological interpretation was of special importance to them. The temple of Belus in the city of Babylon was in their care. In particular, they were advisors to kings and princes.

Though Herod would have had his own court astrologers, he must have paid particular attention to what the respected Magian professionals from the east had to say about a newborn Jewish king. Their interpretations were especially sought out by prominent people because of the Magian influence in the royal courts of the east. In fact, the Magi were in such high regard in Parthia that some even became kings. Even the Magi who came to Jesus were also considered as being ""princes"" or ""kings"" in some early accounts. But when the Magi came to Jerusalem, they arrived to do homage to the new Jewish king and to give gifts to him. In the next century, Tiridates of the order of the Magi did the same thing when he visited the emperor Nero. It is no wonder that the arrival of such Magi caused great interest to Herod and Jerusalem.

In explaining to King Herod why they came to do homage to the new Jewish king, the Magi said, ""We saw his star...."" The Greek denotes it wasn't merely ""in the east"" that the Magi observed it. [So, our version of Matthew's Gospel is accurate: ""We saw his star at its rising"" (Mt 2:2) or ""when it rose.""]

Scholars realize that the Greek words employed by Matthew to record this event were the ordinary ones then used in Greek literature to describe the regular rising of the stars or planets. The plain meaning of the words suggest that the Magi had witnessed a ""star"" rise above the eastern horizon when making their normal pre-dawn observations of the heavens.

It was one ""star"" that intrigued them, though it must have been in some unusual relationship or aspect with other celestial bodies. The Magi were so impressed that they made their long, difficult journey to Jerusalem with costly gifts to present to the new king. After hearing their account, King Herod and all Jerusalem were equally persuaded that the ""star"" was significant.

What did they see?

First, remember: the position of the planets and stars can be calculated with accuracy back through history.

Computations, now used in planetariums, are able to show and explain what they saw. This DVD picks up there and does a fantastic job of it.",1353715200,6,2600,4.762222222222222

2919181,5,B000UAE7IQ,"As a seminary graduate and lifelong church professional, I am very close indeed to the issues raised in this video. I say ""issues"" because, while the express purpose of the video is to offer an extremely interesting theory about what the Star of Bethlehem actually was, the author's conclusions have broad ramifications.

Not only do we get an excellent (and well-produced) explanation for the Star recorded in Matthew, but by reclaiming historical credibility for the First Gospel, a great deal of what purports to be ""modern"" biblical criticism starts to look very thin and smokelike. With it wavers the foundation of an entire post-Christian agenda that has been pushed aggressively on the church for several generations. Bishop Spong won't like this program.

But the wider Church has the opportunity, in part through this excellent documentary, of reclaiming space to think and reason, and act, as the Church...as a temple of living stone, worshiping the Son of God in communion with the angels and saints.

In other words: after watching this program, it will be incumbent on any scholar or other seeker after knowledge to ask ""what else did Matthew get right?"" and ""what am I going to do about it?"" Bravo, Mr. Larson.",1350604800,,1224,5.019704433497537

Why did God command the Hebrews to not look to the stars (Heavens) for the answers to life? How is it that the star seemed to travel ahead of the Magi?

For two millennia, skeptics, truth seekers, scientists and theologians have pondered the star of Bethlehem. The Bible describes unusual or even impossible astronomical events at Christ's birth. Was it a miracle or mere myth? This wonderful DVD from Stephen McEveety ( a producer who worked on The Passion of the Christ) examines Scripture, ancient writings, indisputable astronomical facts and more.

2919194,5,B000UAE7IQ,"Astonishing, yet it rings true. If the TV detective Perry Mason had applied himself to studying the Biblical star seen over Bethlehem at the birth of Jesus, he might have approached it in this manner.  This film is beautifully, carefully, Biblically, and respectfully researched and presented in an engaging and visually spectacular format.  Our family just watched it as a Good Friday devotional, since the content ties together the entire life of Jesus.  The skies are almost more amazing at His death than at His birth!  Anyone who values the scientific advances of ""Intelligent Design"" in the field of biology would appreciate what a dedicated lawyer's detective work can discover as ""intelligent communication"" in the field of astronomy.  In other words, the probability that all these things are just chance occurrences (arising from purely naturalistic processes) approaches the limit of 0.

Is my review just a product of my natural bias as a Christian?  No.  Just out of curiosity, I looked for a 1-star review.  The most recent one was Feb. 12, 2012, in which the reviewer first accuses Mr. Larson of being a ""crackpot"", and then supports his assertion with two facts that are themselves incorrect.  1: Mr. Larson did not say the Magi ""had to be"" Jews, only that it was possible that they could be.  If there were still scholars of Jewish descent living to the east dating back to the Babylonian exile, it would not be a logical problem to understand their motivation for making the long journey to Jerusalem based on their observations of the unusual events they saw in the skies. 2: This same reviewer also claims that Jewish Magi would NEVER worship a human king as a god.  The reviewer misses the main point of the diety of Christ:  ""Immanuel"" = ""God with us"".

2919209,1,B000UAE7IQ,"This DVD is so nutty I have to post a review to warn anyone hoping it will be an interesting and insightful documentary.

First, I purchased my copy of this DVD using my credits on PaperBackSwap, and not from Amazon, so that's why it doesn't say ""Amazon Verified Purchase"" on my review.

I purchased this DVD hoping it was the same as the Bob Brier program about the Three Kings that aired on The Learning Channel (or it might have been the Discover Channel, I don't remember) years ago. It is NOT the same program.

In this Rick Larson DVD, the majority of the DVD is Mr. Larson lecturing a room of students (I can only suppose they are students, or extras) about his various crackpot theories about the Three Wise Men and the Star of Bethlehem.

He actually states at one point that he thinks the Three Wise Men must have been Jews from a Persian community of Jewish people still living in exile, since (his words!) who would worship a Jewish king except Jews. This is absolutely the most absurd thing I've EVER heard.

First century Jews absolutely NEVER worshiped men as gods. This is one of the problems they had with the Roman Empire, because the Romans wanted all their subjects to worship Caesar as a god. The Jews refused to do this. Anyone with even a rudimentary familiarity with the Bible would already know this!!!!!

Rick Larson's presentation and lecture style is circuitous, disjointed and jarring. I actually wonder if he's bipolar, and he went off his meds while filming this documentary? He doesn't so much lecture as he *raves*. As in: a stark, raving lunatic.

I'm a mainline protestant (Methodist) and a common-sense, sensible person. I would NEVER recommend this DVD to anyone. I especially do not recommend it to Christians, as it will give you only very distorted and inconsistent information about the Star of Bethlehem. If you use this DVD to share your faith with others, it will make you look stupid.

Purchase this DVD at your peril. Seek out the Bob Brier program instead, if it is available anywhere on DVD. It was one of the 3 episodes of ""The Mummy Detective"" that aired in 2004.",1329696000,9,2113,4.6310160427807485

I enjoyed it but would not recommend it to anyone without letting them know about the date descrepancy.

It isn't hard to research the date of the birth of Jesus it is very well documented in History.  It was the Emperor Constantine that choose the date of the Winter Solstice for the birthdate of Jesus.  Constantine just switched the birthdate of Tamuz the son of the Sun God that the pagans had been celebrating for centuries to the birthdate of the Son of the Creator of the Universe who was actually born during the Feast of Trumpets somewhere between September and October.

This DVD specifically explores the star the Magi (referred to in the Gospel accounts) followed to find the young child Jesus. Larson describes for us his near obsession with the description of the star, and his struggle with what he was finding.

2919220,4,B000UAE7IQ,"The author, a lawyer, obviously put not only his mind but also his heart in attempting to solve the mystery of the Star of Bethlehem. He describes how it is now possible to calculate the configuration of the celestial bodies going back thousands of years. He goes into a great deal of detail in attempting to squeeze as much informative detail about the Star from the Biblical account. In doing so, he has to rely a lot on inference.

Unfortunately, some of his premises are questionable. For instance, he dismisses a comet as the Star of Bethlehem because a comet would herald disaster, and this would not be a fitting announcement of a Savior. However, comets, in ancient times, portended major events. The events themselves heralded by the comet could indeed be disastrous, but they could also be beneficial.

The author claims that there is no evidence in meticulous ancient Chinese records of an obvious celestial event at the time. In actuality, there is. He is also quick to dismiss a comet or nova because, among other things, according to him, they could not ""stand over"" where the Baby Jesus lay. In actuality, some studies reconcile all Biblical texts with either a nova or comet as the Star of Bethlehem.

Indeed, I could hear the gears grinding of his legal mind, and applaud his passionate pursuit of the facts, and his excitement in possibly having uncovered the astronomical proof of the date of Jesus' birth!

As we celebrate Feast of the Epiphany today, it's good to recall the evidence from scriptures and the heavens which corroborate the promises God made with the birth of Jesus.

God Bless you, Mr. Larson for your scholarship and your faithful testimony!

I've watched it three times so far.

Does is definitively answer the question, is it the absolute answer?  I would say, no; but it is not a proposition without substantiation.  The presenter does a detailed research on the questions of the star using science, bible, historical sources from the era and prior research.  The science sources are some of the same as NASA uses for it's space program and have an impeccable record or accuracy and reliability, the historical sources are historians that lived in the era of the Star and some later all of which are accepted as reliable and accurate, much information is offered from common knowledge of stars, planets, that have regular habitual orbits and behaviors but which are unique to this question of the Star's existence, it's movement and behavior on the day of Jesus' birth.  The presenter is a lawyer, a christian and a teacher, one who started from the premise of answering a question that he didn't know, but wanted to have integrity when speaking of the Star.

The impact and research of one person's quest is done beautifully. The timing and dates are complemented by the web site. The passion and desire of the author and presenter, Rick Larson, is ""mapped"" out for the audience rather deftly.

The real show stopper is the message the heavenly Father gave/gives as a sign that His Son/Lord Jesus Christ is the Messiah. The biblical scriptures Mr. Larson quotes complement the astronomical and historical details. All centers around the Star of Bethlehem. The expanse of all the galaxies in relation to ours is impressive. The Cross of Christ and dating is added in under special features. Amazing and Awesome!

The movie is now one of our favorites as a go to and watch over and over again. Along with the Passion of the Christ with each viewing revealing something fresh. Explaining the difference between astrology and astronomy is a gem in of itself.

We hope others take their faith on a journey like Mr. Larson's. The heartfelt seeking and studying scripture and evidences presented are phenomenal.

I'd like to add that the Chinese astrologers/astronomers accurate records mentioned was a fascinating fact. Chinese characters/pictographs mirror the Hebrew's language. As a character/artistic language rich in depth and meaning, the Hebrew and Chinese use pictograms with expansiveness. Both decorated their homes with visual cues to surround themselves with their beliefs in sight and sound and  hearts. There's something more there too. Maybe the next film?

Love the wise men front lawn display too! Can't say enough good things about this film. Look forward to sharing with others as a gift. The one complaint is that it is too short as only an hour.",1323820800,3,1824,5.003300330033003

It's based on the painstaking research of lawyer Rick Larson, who used astronomy software to reconstruct the ancient skies, and ended up discovering a series of astronomical events that scream (divine) conspiracy, not coincidence. The Star of Bethlehem is packed with the evidence and arguments appropriate to a winning case argued before the Supreme Court, but it moves not just the mind but the spirit.

What I discovered was a wonderfully produced DVD with information that I was oblivious to. I won't go into the specifics and content of this DVD. Those who have seen it know the information presented and have probably formed their own opinion based on the evidence given, and those who have not see this program should view with an open mind and not be swayed by either side. I love the dedication, work and time put in by Larsen to discover astronomical ""signs"" that validate the God's plan for birth and death of Christ. The revelations are startling and comforting. It reminds me that God has a plan and purpose for us and comforts me knowing that he intended for us to discover this ""message"" to let us know that we are not forgotten and to let it be a reminder of the life of His son, Jesus Christ.

2919249,4,B000UAE7IQ,"I watched this some nights ago now, and though impressive, I thought it ended up proving a little disappointing.  However granted that I had high expectations; I thought the lawer-author could have drawn his conclusions somewhat more forcefully in the strict scientific and astronomical areas; but interestingly, that he should have pulled back somewhat, in the interpretation of scripture and prophecy.  How the the Third Person of the Trinity is related to the world, that is.  Not to say he is wrong, quite; but that his viewpoint, or perspective, might be slightly off.  Concerning the latter, and for instance, regarding the elucidation of Rev. 12: 1 - 6, the sun clothed women may well be a spiritual reality that is represented in the stars; yet I don't think the stars themselves are that reality, as he *seemed to intimate*.  Additionally, this was somewhat off point.

  Yet on the scientific (and for this film, really, the more important) end, I wanted Mr. Larson to knock the ball out of the park, so to speak.  And I believe he had the facts on hand to do it.  Yet he missed the opportunity, in that he did not present the matter as *convincingly and as strongly* as he should have.  This is the point; he could have been even more scientific, and pointed, in his presentation; and further, his facts lacked completeness, and scope.  For example: he could have provided us with various further information, such as what was the true magnitude of the star of Bethlehem, how rare is such an occurance, and a complete elaboration of its positioning in the night sky.  Though this still is a thought provoking film; and it may even be said that he proves his point; yet, it was a job that could have been better done, and as a result of this perceived lack of thoroughness, I believe it merely a four star video.",1323561600,,1822,4.673981191222571

2919251,5,B000UAE7IQ,"This movie really blew me away.  The few comments which complain about the ""amateurish"" videography during some of the sections have it WRONG.  I wasn't bothered by the presentation one bit...I thought it was exceptionally well done for what the budget probably was, exceptionally well done.  The animations of the sky were good too.  (Hey it was way better than Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth!)  This was part of the presentation, this was one man piecing through history, scripture and scientific information slowly compiling what is a very compelling theory of what the phenomena of the Star of Bethlehem might have been.  And when it's all knit together it is very compelling.  Will give you goosebumps and leave you a little bit in awe, thinking to yourself ""How great is our God.""

I showed it also, after viewing it myself, to my 6th grade CCD class last year.  6th graders can have a rather short attention span, especially when class if after school and they are kind of tired of being ina classroom.

As someone that is interested in Astronomy, as well as Biblical truth, I am overjoyed at the discoveries Mr. Larson has shared. Having read many of the reviews here, it amazes me how people can have such differing opinions about the presentation format, the info. shared, etc. I think the movie is very well done and presented in a great format. I have taken many on-line/DVD courses that were presented in similar fashion, so I was very comfortable with his presentation.

2919267,5,B000UAE7IQ,"I loved this documentary because it was Biblically researched, well thought out, and presented in a clear concise way. It was easy to find the Biblical references that backed up the research and therefore extremely sound. I have no doubt that others will question it and their own faith regardless of these discoveries. I have no doubt that ridicule will follow as it always does when a Christian proclaims his faith in God, creation, salvation, and the return of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

After seeing this movie, I also did some research and I was able to find references to Jesus and this event from non Christian historians of that time or very close to it. I was amazed that it existed because for all of my life I was told that the Bible was the ONLY historical document that spoke of Jesus Christ. That simply is NOT true.

Mr. Larson was clearly moved by God, directed by God, and God has made his voice heard around the world. I'm grateful for Mr. Larson's research and his ministry and I hope and pray that he's allowed to continue in God's good graces.

For those of you who doubt because you can do nothing else, the Bible also says ""...that hell is excited to greet you."" We were each given a choice in where our future lies. Mine is going to be with my Father God in heaven. This world is not the only one that has been created for me and all of God's children. I'm sure I will meet Mr. Larson there some day for he is my brother in Christ.",1321747200,2,1453,4.334558823529412
2919268,3,B000UAE7IQ,"As other reviewers before me, I consider myself as a born-again Christian with reasonable science background (engineering degree, licensed as a profession engineer for 3 decades) and theological background (doctorate in theology, co-pastor of a church). So I am not biased against solid evidence for the Christian faith which I believe is considerable. However, I believe there are numerous fundamental flaws in Larson's presentation. A couple of the most obvious, from a Biblical point of view which will be recognized by all viewers who are students of Scripture:

1) Larson makes much of John's vision of the ""woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of twelve stars"" (NKJV, Rev. 12:1) which he takes to be the constellation Virgo rising in line with the sun and the moon positioned below. This is presented as an important pointing to the significance of Jupiter's retrograde motion near Regulus in Leo as observed by the Magi. The big problem with this, of course, is that the book of Revelation was not written until A.D. 95 (or at least A.D. 64 for those who support the early date which I find unconvincing). How could the Magi of made any use of Revelation 12 in their interpretation of the night sky? Unless Larson is suggesting they had extra-Biblical revelation (perhaps handed down from Daniel)? How likely would it be that God revealed information of such critical nature to Daniel which was passed to the Magi, but never found its way into the OT book of Daniel? Without Virgo with sun and moon following upon Jupiter's retrograde motions near Regulus in Leo, the significance to ancient astronomers of the proposed Jupiter/Regulus interaction becomes even more dubious.

2) Larson's interpretation of Peter's use of Joel on the day of Pentecost is contrived. He suggests that Peter is pointing out to the people that they ""all know"" that Joel's predictions involving astronomical signs occurred and were fulfilled in the events surrounding the crucifixion. His preferred interpretation is counter to the meaning of the passage when taken at face value: Peter is citing Joel to explain the disciples speaking in unlearned languages due to the Holy Spirit having been poured out upon them. Peter refers to Joel's passage simply to say that it should not be unexpected by the hecklers that God would pour out His Spirit upon people and that they should ""prophesy"" (here, concerning the ""wonders of God""). He is saying nothing about other aspects of Joel being fulfilled - which Joel states are associated with the ""day of the Lord"" and as John's writing in the book of Revelation concerning events associated with the yet-future second coming make abundantly clear find their literal fulfillment. So Joel is not about the first coming and Peter's use of it does not support Larson's use.

There is no doubt that God has set the sun and moon in the sky to serve as signs (Gen. 1:14) as well as seasons -- as Joel's prophecy of the future events of the second coming makes clear. This is also the function of the sun and moon as witnesses to God's promises related to the preservation of Israel (Ps 89:35-37; Jer 31:35-37; Jer 33:20-26; Re 12:1). But the types of signs which Larson has found are not really signs in the sense that they are somewhat arbitrary and would never be recognized as such by most people -- even *with* the aid of Scripture.

The viewer is left wondering if Larson has made a good enough case that the Magi, even if knowledgeable observers of the heavens, would have interpreted the retrograde motion of Jupiter near Regulus in Leo along with a many-months later conjunction of Jupiter with Venus as a significant enough astronomical event to set out for Jerusalem -- even if guided in their timing by the prophecy of Daniel's 70 weeks (Dan. 9:24-27).

In summary, there are some thought-provoking tidbits in the presentation which is professionally enough done, but the misuse of Revelation 12 and Joel 2 in support of the presentation will not inspire confidence in those who have a good grasp of these passages.",1321315200,6,4093,4.875

Remember Genesis and that God created the Heavens before creating Man! So God knew before hand that Man was going to sin and made a way for our salvation thru Christ Jesus. Because GOD first loved us; but he is holy, holy, holy. HE wants none to parish...so his son paid the price for our sins. Further proof that God is the Alfa and Omega, infinity and outside our perspective of time. Equally amazing that this is released as we march into the last days...nothing is a coincidence with GOD and we will be found without excuse! Especially here in the USA.

These stellar events are documentable and irrefutable. The coincidence of the evidence is appalling and unchallenged.

The PERSONALITY of a CREATOR is right there shoved in your face. The PRESENCE of God in TIME and SPACE is undeniable.

We are seeing the Truth itself. We cannot deny we have seen it. We all stand for Judgment.

By or choices, by what we choose, we are defined. There is no other Bread and no other Light. And there is no alternative.

A HUMAN baby born of a Human mother....is foretold as documented in New Testament and Old Testament Scripture...as the Son of God.
REALITY can have only one Origin, Direction, and Purpose. God has been born a Man.

This documentary is probably one of the best Christian Documentaries because it proves that there was a bethlehem star. We have always been confused what it was.

2919309,2,B000UAE7IQ,"It was a very interesting video full of astronomical facts.  But he was wrong on the date of Jesus' death and resurrection.  He had Jesus dying on a Friday like it was a normal Sabbath coming.  But this was the Passover, and Jesus died on a Thursday NOT a Friday.  He was looking up where the stars were at Christ's death as if it was Friday, when he should have been looking up the stars for the day before.

""Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath..."" John 19.31a

""And on the fifteenth day of the same month (Nisan) is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the Lord; seven days you must eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no customary work on it."" Lev 23.6-7

So according to God's Word, the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread is a Sabbath NO MATTER WHICH day of the week it falls on.

So Christ was crucified on a THURSDAY, the next day was a special Sabbath (Feast of Unleavened Bread), and then the NEXT day was the traditional Sabbath.  Then Christ rose on Sunday, the first day of the week.  (If indeed Christ was crucified on Friday like most Christians believe, then He was NOT in the grave 3 days and 3 nights like He said He would be.)

Maybe Mr. Larson can redo his video with the correct time/date for the death of Christ, and see where the stars were then.",1305417600,6,1367,4.199233716475096

2919319,3,B000UAE7IQ,"I believe this study presents a correct understanding of the time of Christ's death but an incorrect understanding of the time of Christ's birth and thus of the star of Bethlehem. I believe the best and most thorough study of this subject matter... ever published is one done by Colin Humphreys. It can be read here: [...]
Humphreys' study presents a very compelling case that Christ was born in the spring of 5 BC and that the star of Bethlehem was a comet that history records then appeared in earth's skies. Though Humpreys does not discuss John the baptist in his study, I will here do so to add some additional validation to Humphreys' dating of Christ's birth.

Christ was crucified on April 3, AD 33. Agreed. And his earthly ministry lasted for three and a half years. Agreed. That puts the start of Christ's ministry in the fall of AD 29. And the Bible tells us that he was ""about 30"" when he began his ministry. Or does it? The Greek word Luke uses which is translated as ""about"" actually conveys a much greater degree of indefiniteness than a similar Greek word which is normally used to convey the meaning of our word ""about."" In fact Greek lexicons tell us that the Greek word Luke uses translated in our Bibles as ""about"" may be translated by the words ""as if."" Because Jewish men normally began their ministries to God at the age of 30, if Jesus had already passed that age he would have then begun his ministry ""as if"" he were 30, even though he had already passed that age three years earlier.

But what about the ministry of John the baptist leads us to believe that at the start of Christ's ministry he was already well passed the age of 30? John was a Levite. Jesus was not. By Jewish law Levite men always had to begin their forma...l service to God within a few months after they turned 30 years old. So since we know that Christ began his ministry at the conclusion of John's ministry, in the fall of 29, and since the Bible indicates that John was about 6 months older than Jesus, all we have to do to determine the year of Christ's birth is to determine how long exactly John preached before introducing the Messiah to the world.

If, as I will show, the Bible clearly indicates that John's ministry lasted for 3 and a half years, all we have to do to determine the time of Christ's birth is to count back 3 and a half years from the fall of 29 to the spring of 26 for the start of John's ministry, and then count back another 30 years from that date to find the time of John's birth. This would then be the spring of 5 BC if John began his ministry immediately upon turning 30, or maybe as early as 6 BC if John waited a few months after turning 30 to start his service to God. Either way, if John's ministry lasted for 3 and a half years Christ must have been born in the year 5 BC, since we know that he was about six months younger than John.

But how does the Bible clearly indicate that John's ministry lasted for 3 and a half years? It does so by comparing John to ""Elijah."" In fact John even dressed like Elijah to make this connection to his prophetic forerunner crystal clear. But what was the prophetic connection between John and Elijah? Elijah prophesied that no rain would fall in northern Israel ""for 3 and a half years"" and then at the end of those ""3 and a half years"" a very much needed rain finally came to Israel. Just as at the end of John's ministry he introduced to Israel a very much needed rain of living water, Jesus Christ its long awaited Messiah. In fact a messianic Psalm had in fact many years earlier foretold that the coming of the Messiah would be like a much needed rain falling on Israel. It is also very interesting to here note that nowhere in the OT are we told just how long Elijah prophesied before the rain finally came. But that information is very carefully given to us not once but twice in the NT, once by Jesus Christ himself. Why does the NT provide us with this information? I maintain that it does so to help us date the birth of Jesus Christ by telling us how long John preached before Christ`s own ministry began. If you disagree with this dating of Christ's birth, explain to me why John the baptist was called ""Elijah.""

Anyone who is serious about understanding the star of Bethlehem owes it to themselves to read Humphreys' article linked above.",1298678400,4,4325,4.3477722772277225
2919320,5,B000UAE7IQ,"Knowing now for quite some time that the HEAVENS IN FACT DECLARE THE GLORY OF GOD which is limitless and how the moon, sun and stars speak to us not only of the season but also is God's heavenly timepiece this DVD gives sceptics all the proof they need.  Unfortunately for so long we have believed a lie and steer for from what the world calls astroloygy using God's heavenly signs given to the Jewish nation and perverted its purpose.  Now as we awaken men's eyes are opening seeing the revealed glory of God and the message it still speaks to the nations of the world.  This is a part of that message.  When you begin a study of scripture beginning in Genesis all through scripture including the tribal stones (now called birthstones here in America) to the feasts of the Lord celebrated according to the moon yet have all be purposely kept from us to keep us believing a lie and not knowing the timing of God for he does nothing that he doesn't first reveal to his people.  All the feasts were known as PRACTICES and it is happening in the heavens as it happens here on this earth. (Gospel of The Stars)  Soon the last feast that has been practiced for two days (two thousand years to God) is soon to be carried out on earth as it is in heaven.  I highly reccomend this DVD to begin this journey.",1298246400,,1299,4.320987654320987
2919321,2,B000UAE7IQ,"Let me be clear about my bias. I am a Christian who believes that Jesus is the Messiah. Thus, I am not likely to speak against Christianity. My criticism is not about Christianity, but about Frederick Larson's research, and about the DVD. One of the negatives of the DVD is the background music, which is too loud and distracting, especially because Mr. Larson's voice often trails off. The presentation format was not particularly effective, and Mr. Larson as a lecturer did a below-average job. Perhaps my point of reference (medical school lectures) is placing the bar high, but given the importance of the topic, I think this is reasonable.

Regarding the astronomy, Mr. Larson should have clarified a number of points. I am not familiar with the commercially available software that he used, and I assume that most in the audience are like me. Therefore, it should have been clarified whether the software took into account the calendar adjustment of 1582, when the Gregorian calendar was implemented. Since the Gregorian calendar started by dropping 10 days (accumulated since the first council of Nicea due to the inaccuracy of the Julian calendar), the matter of correction is meaningful when Mr. Larson attempts to pin a celestial event to a specific date (December 25).

Mr. Larson did not state how often the described celestial events take place. He assumed that the three magi came from Babylon, and adjusted the software accordingly to view the night sky. He made this an important point in his presentation. Yet, he did not show how the same events would have been seen from other cities in the East. Mr. Larson described how the Star of Bethlehem ""stopped"" (i.e., the planetary movement stopped to reverse course), but how this would have happened specifically in Bethlehem (not visible from, e.g., Nazareth) was not addressed.

Mr. Larson spoke of Jewish scholars from Babylon as the three magi. This is a very dubious point. At the time when Jesus was born, east of Judea was the Parthian Empire. The magi were scientist priests of the Medes, related to the Zoroastrian religion. Their knowledge of the constellations (astronomy and astrology were not separated at the time) had its roots in Sumerian, Akkadian, and Babylonian civilizations. The interpretation of the Lion constellation is a plausible and interesting take, but one needs to recognize that is merely one of several alternative interpretations. One may even contemplate the fact that the present-day Judeo-Christian view was not the prevailing one during the first few hundred years AD, and Nestorian Christianity (which was declared heresy) had a significantly different take on the events, including the family tree of Jesus. Since the magi came from Parthia, where Manicheism, Nestorian Christianity dominated, their search for the King of Kings may have been rooted in non-Jewish traditions. I am not suggesting that this is necessarily the case, but I would expect any serious scholar to weigh the possibility.

Regardless what I think about it, I must mention the work of D.M. Murdock (aka Acharya S). She explains that the story of the Christ is a story written in celestial objects, and that the story is rooted in much older times. She also makes the assertion that Jesus as a historical figure did not exist, but the celestial events did. Let us stop here, and assume that Mr. Larson really proved that the Star of Bethlehem, as well as the celestial events associated with the crucifixion happened on those specific days. He was astonished by the accuracy how these events were planned by God at the time of creating the Universe. Everything happened like clockwork. However, if Murdock is correct (I am not saying she is, but I am considering the possibility), Mr. Larson may have strengthened her point. After all, Mr. Larson did not prove that Jesus was a historical figure.

Again, my criticism is about Mr. Larson's research, which lacks proper scientific rigor, and not about his faith. I think that he has made some interesting observations, and should continue his research to place his theory on more solid foundations (or realize that they are nor sustainable).",1296691200,16,4165,5.039187227866473

I was so impressed that I wanted to have my own copy, for more careful ""start-and-stop"" personal viewing and also to share with family and friends.  I enthusiastically recommend it -- for its educational value in astronomy and Bible history, but also (much more importantly) as another piece of evidence that the Bible can be trusted as a book containing God's truth!

It is an illustrated presentation by Frederick Larson, a lawyer (not an astronomy expert), who has been rewarded with very amazing findings -- resulting from diligent research effort (using careful Bible-study and historical analysis, plus sophisticated astronomy-projection computer-simulation programs), combined with ""outside-the-box"" thinking.

Traditional scholarly dating of events associated with the Bible's account of the Star of Bethlehem's appearance (in the 5 B.C. to 1 B.C. period) causes many learned ""experts"" to question Mr. Larson's conclusions.  However, the past astronomical events he has discovered (by going backward in time with the mathematically-precise astronomy software) certainly prove that the ""behavior"" ascribed to the Star in the Bible is both explainable and consistent with known natural and observable appearances of stars and planets, when viewed from a fixed position on a rotating and orbiting earth!",1296172800,,1378,5.605769230769231
2919325,3,B000UAE7IQ,"I found The Star of Bethlehem to be thought-provoking; I appreciate it for that.  I will adopt the same caveat given in the film:  I'm not an astronomer (nor astrologist).  Sill, in my consideration of what was presented, I developed several basic criticisms.  The first, already covered in previous reviews, was that the production -- especially the overly colorful splash of images during the introduction -- was amateurish.  The second was that the film should have been extended to anticipate and address simple criticisms such as these.  The theory presented, based upon one man using a modern software program, made a basic assumption about the date of Herod's death; the date settled upon appears to be in contention.  The remainder of the theory rests upon the interesting coincidences of planetary pairings and stellar-constellation pairings at points in time.  Other broad interpretations were made, such as the Revelation of St. John being interpreted as findings within constellations.  One specific critical question would be ""How often do things 'line up' in an interesting way in a one-year, a ten-year and a 100-year span of time""?  Also, no mention is made of why God would choose to recognize Greek pantheism reflected in the identification of constellations.  The proposed Divine illustrations using the constellations would probably have appealed to the Greeks; unfortunately, they could not discover these events using the Starry Night software. I also share another reviewer's concern that, even if Jupiter appeared to stop moving in the night sky, there is no reason to think that it would appear to stop moving over Bethlehem or over a particular home in Bethlehem (i.e., would it not always appear ahead and overhead?).  If the program had been extended, say 30 minutes to address the immediate criticisms, it would have been a good opportunity to buttress the theory.",1296086400,13,1893,5.211221122112211

They probably should have sought actual astronomers to verify and possibly expound on the claims; though such people have written positive reviews of the film, reading some critical reviews here on Amazon tells me that their expertise should have been embedded in the film itself. I also thought this documentary could have been extended a lot.

Specifically, although this would have taken it outside of its astronomical scope, I thought he could have talked a little about the place the New Testament gives to eyewitnesses at a time when they were still living in the context of Peter's statement that his listeners have seen the evidence for themselves. Also, in the context of God setting the whole ""clock"" if you will into motion, the idea of the Roman Empire and the nation of Israel developing in such a way to set the stage for Christ's ministry and the rapid spread of Christianity would have been neat to hear as well. I'm not really criticizing the film, I'm just thinking about what could have been added.",1295913600,,1177,4.764705882352941

when the firmament was created and set into motion? Or was this perhaps simply another chance event from
the ""Big Bang"" and Jesus just happened to come to earth at that exact time when the shepherds and the wise men from the East decided to journey to the small town of Bethleham, to seek the baby born in a manager?  Does Christianity require or demand that one's intelligence be put aside to believe, or is it in fact required to use rational thought to confirm ones faith.

I was enthused that there would be a scientific model that explained the existence of the star. I was hoping for something with a higher end production, a narrator who spoke slowly and gave the viewer time to consider and ponder what was being presented. I hoped for other scientists and astronomers speaking on camera that gave support to the evidence that was  presented - perhaps even offering differing opinions and leaving the viewer to draw their own conclusion.

I loved the information. I wanted the speaker to slow down, spend less time on camera, give more imagery, get out of the classroom (court room) and  take me on a journey. I wanted to see, hear, and feel the star in my heart...

It just didn't happen.

2919377,5,B000UAE7IQ,"This video does a great job of demonstrating how advanced computer software can simulate what the night sky looked like nearly 2,000 years ago when the magi followed the star of Bethlehem.  It's not just a boring documentary, however, as Mr. Larson's presentation is entertaining and inspiring.  He movingly explains how he came upon studying the information he discovered and then demonstrates what the magi must have seen; how the star they followed was an especially bright ""star""; how it did, in fact, move through the night sky during their journey; and how it then miraculously stopped over the town of Bethlehem.  The video is well done and words to describe it really do not give it full justice.  It is well worth watching!  My recommendation is you order now, watch it when it arrives, and then watch it again at Christmas with friends and family.  Not only will it fascinate you, but you will find it to be a wonderful witnessing tool.

By itself the video is absolutely fascinating, but what made it especially interesting to me was how it also related to a topic I like to study and write about: end-times Bible prophecy.  Some of the scripture Mr. Larson used can be found in Revelation 12:1,2 where we read, ""A great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head.  She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.""

As Dr. David Reagan explains in his book Wrath and Glory  (page 36), ""The first five verses of Revelation 12 tell the story in symbolic language of how Israel gave birth to the Messiah and how Satan tried to kill Him at birth"".  As one watches the video and relates that concept to the symbolic flashback we see in Revelation 12, it provides an amazing look at God's profound Word and omniscience.

The issue of how we can link the symbolic scripture found in Revelation 12 with scientific evidence that, in fact, a ""star of Bethlehem"" existed is not unlike how we see the literal fulfillment of Jeremiah 16:14-15 where we read, ""However, the days are coming,"" declares the LORD, ""when men will no longer say, `As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,' but they will say, `As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.' For I will restore them to the land I gave their forefathers.""

Unlike what many scholars must have experienced for many centuries after Jerusalem was destroyed at the hands of the Romans and Israel ceased to exist, we now have the luxury of knowing, without any doubt, that God's Word in that passage meant exactly what it said since Israel miraculously became a nation again in 1948.

Indeed only recently has end-times Bible prophecy become as understood as it is today, which is quite encouraging given what God told Daniel. Daniel wrote, ""I heard, but I did not understand.  So I asked, `My lord, what will the outcome of all this be?'  He replied, `Go your way, Daniel, because the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end'"" (Daniel 12:8-9).

As you can see, Daniel did not understand what God was asking him to record.  When he asked the Lord what the outcome would be, God replied that the words were not meant for Daniel to understand and, in fact, they were to be ""closed up and sealed until the time of the end."" Now, however, we have a lot being unsealed before our very eyes.  First, we have the Book of Revelation which is becoming increasingly more understandable as we watch today's news headlines.  We also have seen Israel become a nation just as the Bible predicted.  Finally, though not completely necessary, God allows us to make scientific discoveries, such as the Star of Bethlehem, that help us understand scripture more than ever.  The logical conclusion is exciting because we can reasonably conclude we are now living in ""the time of the end"".

2919447,5,B000UAE7IQ,"The first half hour is more talking and set-up. The last half-hour is the pay off. Essentially the argument is, according to modern astronomical software where we can plug in the time and date of when we want to look in the sky - we get a date by cross-referencing passages in the Bible as to when X,Y,Z must have occured (Josephus, Jewish calender, a Friday, Sabbath, etc, narrowing the window to a highly specific date) and we see what the Star must have been, and in fact that there was a unique astronomical event in the skies at this time. (and no, it's not really a ""star"" in our venacular, but they would have referred to it as one).

Fascinating documentary. And it goes into much more than simply the star itself, but also what happened when Jesus was conceived, and the sign in the sky when he died.

2919450,4,B000UAE7IQ,"I found the information in this DVD very fascinating-- HOWEVER Mr. Larson would have benefited from some ""disinterested in the project"" pre-screeening critics to help him sharpen up the translation of his information onto a DVD.  I am sure in person this presentation comes off better. I heard this DVD 2ce before actually being able to sit down and watch it. Hearing it was better only because the actual ""pictures"" of the constellations are not clear, his face is projected over what the viewer is trying to observe, it's boring to watch a man talking to some people in a small room. This could have been a much more enjoyable film; instead you are watching a lecture.

I am grateful that Mr. Larson has shared what God's grace and benevolence has allowed him to re-discover and make available to us (THANK YOU!!) something that was edvident to many long, long ago, but lost to many generations. This is of course, not ""new"" information at all, but a new way of seeing a truth from the past.

What I find most regretable though, is that as a Protestant, he has limited himself by not researching the Roman Catholic Church's great Saints, Mystics, and early Chuch Fathers. Some of his comments bear this out. An example even my kids picked up on was his misunderstanding of the book of Revelation (why would you attempt to impose a Scripture passage you admit you don't understand on to a constellation? that was a little strange-), Our Lady of Guadalupe revealed in the stars (Revelation 12)is clearly displayed in his own presentation but not mentioned, and the fact that the Virgin planet never ""becomes"" the Mother planet but REMAINS a VIRGIN planet.

This film details the journey of Frederick Larsen from his first moment of curiosity to his extraordinary findings - the coming and passing of Christ were both announced by the heavens.

Using Starry Software, first century manuscripts, and the Bible, Larsen was able to ascertain the critical date of King Herod's death, a date that eluded previous investigators including Johannes Kepler; the nine characteristics of ""The Star""; and information on the blood moon which was mentioned by St. Peter at the Pentecost. Larsen carefully shares his evidence and makes an excellent case on how the heavens announce the birth of the Messiah, mark the arrival of the Magi for the first Christmas, and mark His passing with a lunar eclipse (the Blood Moon) on the day of his crucifixion. The DVD also includes a short segment on the eclipse as seen from the moon - a solar eclipse - and its profound implications.

2919470,5,B000UAE7IQ,"This is an astonishing and compelling use of modern astronomical tools to confirm events surrounding Jesus' birth and crucifixion. In my view the lunar eclipse at the crucifixion -- something that might appear to be tacked onto the talk -- is almost more significant than the identification of the Bethlehem Star. Just for fun, here is my own accuracy score: I am 80% convinced that his explanation of the Bethlehem Star is accurate, but I am 99% convinced that his explanation of the lunar eclipse at Jesus' crucifixion is accurate. To put it another way, I may not be willing to go to the stake over whether his Bethlehem Star identification is factually true, but I would likely be willing to go to the stake over the factuality of the crucifixion eclipse. The evidence seems overwhelming that the crucifixion occurred on April 3, 33 AD.

Since this is a popular level talk, proper documentation is missing (although a good bit can be found on the author's bethlehem star website). I wish the DVD producers had added a page or two of supporting citations for the various assertions made in the DVD -- I say this as a scientist who is interested in such things. For one thing, the talk implies that the speaker had stumbled on the crucifixion eclipse on his own, but the information he gives was first (I believe) presented by Humphreys and Waddington (Oxford) in a paper published in Nature in 1983 -- see the Wikipedia article on the Crucifixion of Jesus.

I must admit that the heavy use of the names for prominent constellations and planets - Leo, Virgo, Ram (noted in the ""additional material""), Jupiter, and the star Regulus -- in support of his work is a bit startling at first, but on reflection it is probably legitimate -- after all, constellation names are mentioned in the Bible (while at the same time it condemns astrology). It is perhaps natural that a person who looks to the heavens to discern the signs, times and seasons would use star patterns and name them as a mnemonic aid. From my investigations, it appears that the origins of the constellation names is buried so far back in ancient times that nobody knows where they first arose.

Without explicitly saying so, this DVD makes some important theological observations. First, it is incredible that the star configurations that heralded Jesus' birth and mourned his death are just happenstance. God must have planned them from eternity past -- therefore the factual content says a lot about God's foreknowledge (and puts the lie to the notion that he can't look into or control future events) and about predestination.

Second, it is remarkable that the significance of the prophet Joel's and the Apostle Peter's reference to a ""moon of blood"" (a common ancient term for a lunar eclipse) was apparently lost to the church for nearly 2000 years. And its recent rediscovery testifies to God's use of modern science to proclaim his glory and handiwork to the modern world.

Third, the reference to the lunar eclipse in Acts 2:20 is a strong confirmation of the historical accuracy and historicity of this account, and should refute the claims by many critics that the events of Jesus' life are historical fiction.

In summary, this is an excellent DVD. It should be in the library of every evangelical church, and should be a strong challenge to those thinking people who see the Gospel account of Jesus' life as mere fabricated folk lore. My only regret is that the video production is relatively amateurish. The compelling and attractive subject matter deserves a more professional production.

Added Sep09: Here is my take on the issue of whether the retrograde change in direction of Jupiter on December 25, 1 BC satisfies the observation in Matthew that ""it came to rest over the place where the child was.""

First, the word for ""place"" is quite indefinite: it doesn't mean ""house"" as some versions say -- it might just mean that the direction change occurred towards the South, over Bethlehem, as the Magi were on the 5 mile trek from Jerusalem, in a sort of confirmation of the Micah prophecy that they had just heard. Of course the ""mathematician"" in the group would have known this already, it is not something he could actually observe visually (I assume). The confirmation consists in learning from Herod's query that Bethlehem is the ""place"" and the fact that Jupiter was at that time ""stopped"" -- in the South, on a compass (!) direction that passed directly over Bethlehem.

Second, Bethlehem was a small town (by modern standards), perhaps at most a few thousand people. In keeping with the times, almost everyone knew everyone else. The family had been there for over 6 months, and they were in any case related to most of the residents in the town.

Third, the wisemen knew the exact date that the star appeared the previous June. There probably was only one, and couldn't have been more than 2-3 infants that would be the right age. All they had to do was ask around, just as I do if I want to know where the farmstand is when I get to an unfamiliar town.

So, in conclusion, I consider this a non-issue, and certainly the star ""stopping"" does not require a miraculous intervention by God. The Jupiter direction change is more than enough.",1246406400,102,5230,4.774336283185841
2919471,5,B000UAE7IQ,"Star of Bethlehem

The first time I had the opportunity to watch this movie during the Christmas season of 2007. I was thumbing through the stations late night / early morning when I came across it on the Trinity Broadcast Network.  Had I not caught this movie by channel surfing, I probably would not have watched it. Knowing that just seeing the title of the movie, during the Christmas season in which it was, could have easily been assumed to be just another children's show, animated at best, telling the story of Jesus Christ and His unusual miraculous birth. Shows in which I had viewed many times over the years as being a children's pastor at my local church. I was truly pulled in greatly into his well put together documentary of the Star of Bethlehem, not just any star but the one true star that signified the birth of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ.
The movie begins as the narrator of this documentary opens up. First with his credentials, the reason he made the documentary, what set him upon its path and his research credits. Produced by Steven McEveety of the Passion of the Christ, and narrated / presented by an (at the time), unknown attorney, Rick Larson. Not knowing much of Steven and his works left little judgments from me on this piece of work with a few exceptions such as visuals and sound quality, which fall into his area as producer.
As for Rick, I liked the fact that right up front he brought to light his credentials. None in astrology, of which he uses for his theorized basis of his presentation. Other than what he had learned in researching the star or stars as his theory unfolds. But an attorney none the less. Trained in the art of methodology, to assist in bringing in the facts and weighing all the evidence for its actual value.
Even though he had mentioned the fact that he was a Christian still had not affected my initial judgment of him, being a Christian myself had made me more of a skeptic. Primarily because the term Christian can cause a person to thing things like: honest, good morals, non-lying, non-cheating and over all just a good person. None of which you would you would assign to the personality and live style of an attorney.
He had started looking into this several years ago around Christmas time, while he and his daughter were setting up the outside traditional Christmas yard decorations. When they got to the star, it made him think: ""what did it look like?"" "" Did it twinkle?"" etc.. Not wanting to misrepresent himself or the reference of the star. So he researched it to get it right, thus beginning the thoughts behind his theory. Seemed kind of analytical, but then again I (we) have also been accused of the analytical parts of life too. As he went on with his presentation he backed it up with facts of evidence just an attorney would want to do to win his / her case. The better the evidence, the better chance of winning
  He laid out his groundwork foundation of his theory from a scientific astrologist point of view using the Bible to sort the value of the evidence as with other literary evidence of the time, such as the writings of Josephus and others. Using a scientific approach to see how the Bible lined up with the science. Gleaning from the mathematical proofs of people such as Galio, Kepler and Newton as his guide, he went from there, searching the skies for the Star of Bethlehem, using today's technology to the advantage and ease of work as it was intended.  During his presentation he first formed the basis of the facts of astronomical science in which that all stars are like a large clock encompassing the earth, that they with the knowledge of Kepler and the refinements made by Newton, you can know precisely where each star will be at a certain point in time, as can be seen from any location on earth. In knowing the science, not only can you look forward to their placement in time but you can also look back in time.  In this he did for his theory. He searched the Bible for its evidence of the star's location, time and description, primarily from the book of Matthew. Finding nine proofs from the Bible, that must be met to be valid evidence of the star. Then, using historical literature and documentation from others, outside the Bible, as tools to validate the Biblical documentation of his evidence. Compiling them to decipher the evidence, for its times, location and descriptions, he laid out his theory.
 What little music played throughout the presentation was composed by his wife and seemed to have a sound of royalty yet mysterious undertones. Her work fit in well with his presentation as He walked through evidence of his theory.  With the use of PowerPoint slides and visuals of the computer animated program (A Starry Night) of the stars, placing them (the stars) in their place, according to the evidence gathered, at their precise locations in time according to the gathered evidence, he told his story. Continually building upon the evidence outlining his theory with more valid evidence.
Not being an astrologist it left a lot of questions for me as he leapt from one piece of evidence to another. The movie also has a website that also shows much of the same slides as were shown in the presentation, to include much of the written script outlining his theory. The real neat part was that he not only showed the star but also connected some other cool revealing things present in stars in the heavens during the period from Christ's miraculous conception to obviously His birth, but also what was happening in the sky at the time of His death as well. As Rick put it, it was a very awesome celestial dance in sky, in which God had created from the beginning of time. Knowing that from the moment God flung the stars into the sky, during His creation week that he would have to send a savior at a set point in time as well as know the set time of the saviors' death.
Concluding the movie with a powerful impacting statement of a question such as ""My God, My God, what have you done?""  The impact of the movie, as reality of the puzzled pieces were put in their place, left tears streaking down from the corners of my eyes, in a state of awe and wonder at Gods forethought and might, while disguising the history and future of His created universe in the stars, traveling throughout the heavens from the beginning of time as he created it. Recalling the final words of Jesus as he died upon the Cross, crying out to God, as Jesus looked into the heavens as well, ""My god, My God, Why have your forsaken me?""
In comparing the movie with other earth and scientific type documentaries, such as global warming flick, done by former vice president nominee Al Gore. The science was at least truthful and not something that the evidence was designed around the theory to make it seem plausible. Besides in all honesty the global warming hoopla is a real hard sell. For example this winter in the South East, Midwest and the upper northern territories in the US, not to mention the Canadian  country being even further north and always cold in the winter. Even our summers in reality are no warmer than they truly had been over the course of keeping records and over a average period of time.
It is not often a movie, especially a narrated one, can bring tears to my eyes. Not due to poor quality or quantity, but because it was allowed to come in and align thoughts in the back of your mind that were, until now, uncompleted thoughts of bewilderment. Giving complete meaning to what you didn't know.",1243641600,6,7521,4.572700296735905

2919492,2,B000UAE7IQ,"There are a great deal of issues that need to be addressed on Mr Larson's work, but let's just look at one, without even leaving the text of the bible.

Matthew 2:9 says that the star preceded the magi, until it stopped over the place where the child was.

Now, no matter whether you think the star was a comet, a supernova, a planet like Jupiter...a 'star' in the sky can't lead you to someone's specific house. It may lead you to a rather large area, but certainly not a tiny house.

You may contend, as Mr Larson seems to, that the star didn't lead the magi to a specific house, but to the city of Bethlehem. But does that follow the reading from Matthew?

Matthew 2:9 says that the star stopped over 'the place' where the child was. The bit question, then, is what is 'the place'? Is it Bethlehem, or the house where Jesus and family are staying? Since the verse doesn't say specifically, you have to look at the context of the surrounding verses to figure out what was indicated.

Let's assume that it's Bethlehem. We could paraphrase verses 8 and 9 as  ""Herod sent them to Bethlehem...the star preceded them, until it came and stopped over Bethlehem.""  This doesn't make much sense, because verse 8 already has them going to Bethlehem. Now verse 9 has the star leading them to the city they're already headed to.

Now consider if 'the place' is simply the house where they're staying. We could paraphrase it as  ""Herod sent them to Bethlehem...and the star preceded them, until it came and stopped over the house where the child was.""  This makes perfect sense as it reads.

Now look at verses 9 and 10 together. Read them as if 'the place' is Bethlehem.  ""...the star...came and stopped over Bethlehem...and on entering the house...""  Wait a second, what house? All the sudden Matthew is referring to a house, implying he has mentioned it previously. (No, I haven't skipped over any relevant text, read the verses yourself.)

Now read it as if 'the place' is the house where they're staying.  ""the star...came and stopped over the house where the child was...and on entering the house...""  Again, no explanation needed, it makes perfect sense as it reads.

Put simply, Matthew's chapter reads much more naturally when you assume that 'the place' refers to the house where Jesus and family are staying, as opposed to the city of Bethlehem. And if it does refer to the house, that's something a 'star' is unable to do. Read it both ways, and decide for yourself.

Also, if 'the place' is Bethlehem, consider this. They're following the star, it leads them to this city...and then what? They still have to find the house in a city of about 5,000. If 'the place' is a house, it leads them to a house, and they're done. The passage makes sense.

Lastly, if 'the place' is Bethlehem, consider this. The first 8 verses mention 'Bethlehem' twice in narrative, in addition to twice in Old Testament quotes. Then all the sudden in verse 9, does it make sense to all the sudden refer to Behtlehem as 'the place where the child was'?

As far as the rest of it goes...we haven't left the bible, and we already have a pretty major problem. We have another one when we consider that the consensus date for Herod's death is 4 BC, which if correct makes much of Mr Larson's argument invalid.

My experience with 'evidence' such as this tends to unravel the deeper we look into it.",1230854400,15,3370,4.5647840531561465
2919493,5,B000UAE7IQ,"According to the website [...] the DVD is currently on backorder until Feb 2009...

To satisfy his curiosity, this Bible-believing attorney has researched what the Old and New Testament scriptures say about the signs in the heavens, what all other historical sources say about the dates of Jesus birth and death, and what the latest computer modeling software reveals about the skies during the times of Jesus conception, birth, arrival of the wise men, and crucifixion in a compendium of starry poetry...

The outcome is astonishing and inspiring ~ be ready to have your breath taken away as the Star of Bethlehem is revealed like it has never been before... over 100 billion galaxies with over 100 billion stars each AND this presentation reveals that God's plans for the timing of Christ's arrival were made as He initially tossed all the stars into creation at the beginning of time.  Wow.

This 65 minute video/dvd is interesting, well made, and captivating ~ and after you've seen it, you'll undoubtedly want to include it in your annual Christmas traditions as well as share it with your family and friends.  You may as well order a couple of extra now to save yourself the trouble later  :o)

2919494,5,B000UAE7IQ,"Was the Star of Bethlehem as told in Matthew's Gospel of the New Testament true or was it a myth made up later by early Christians? What if you could go back in time and actually view the ancient skies at the time of Jesus' birth? This film attempts to answer the first question by doing the 2ND. Using state of the art software, the same as used by NASA and other agencies, it is possible to examine the skies of Bethlehem in the days and years surrounding the estimated date of Christ's birth. The stars and planets move in such mathematical precision that it is possible to project forward and backward with incredible accuracy using this software. That in itself is so amazing when you consider the 100 BILLION galaxies that contain 100 BILLION stars each. Each one has a precise orbit and path that never deviates. Is it possible for all this to be coincidence? What Frederick Larson, author, lecturer and attorney, attempts to show is that it was astronomically possible and indeed probable that at the time of Jesus' birth the Planets Jupiter and Venus converged into what looked like a very bright star to the naked eye. He lists the nine characteristics of the star outlined in Matthew and then shows how his theory satisfies all nine of those conditions. Does this prove the birth of Jesus or that He was God come in the flesh? No, but it is more evidence (not necessarily proof) as to the historical accuracy of the Bible and that the Bible narrative is not destroyed by science. If you are a follower of the one called Jesus, you will be encouraged and strengthened in your faith. If you are not, it will cause you to at least stop and consider the claims of this ancient, yet modern, story of the miracle of Jesus' birth. Worth watching just for the lesson on astronomy.",1229731200,12,1783,4.540372670807454

But this documentary film has totally opened my eyes to more of God's incredible majesty, and His amazing design and planning, even from the creation of the world.

A few days ago, two of our teenage boys (age 13 and 16) watched this DVD at our church youth group. They both came home SO excited and thrilled about the awesome-ness of God, and were trying to explain what they had seen in the film. We got the DVD the next day, and together watched the movie as a family, and all of us were so blessed. I personally learned so much (both about science, history, and the Bible), and I was amazed at how the whole film was so glorifying to the Lord. Even this morning, during our church worship service, I kept thinking about what I had seen in the DVD, and how incredible and awesome God is.

The part that stood out to me the most was Larson's concluding comment about how God had planned the exact timing of the birth of Jesus and the cross, even from the creation of the world. It totally goes along with Revelation 13:8, how Jesus is our ""Lamb of God, slain from the foundation of the world.""

I highly recommend this video. It is excellent for all ages, and is one of the most glorifying Christmas-related videos I have ever seen. Our family also homeschools, and this film is excellent for sparking a godly  interest in our children for learning more about the stars. It would also be an excellent tool to share with people who have doubts about the Lord, for people with an interest in astronomy, or I believe, for people from a Jewish background. Jesus is our promised Messiah, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, and the ultimate sacrificial Lamb for the whole world.",1228608000,5,1887,4.426512968299712

2919527,5,B000UAE7IQ,"Practically everything in the nighttime sky has at one time or another been proposed as the Star of Bethlehem.  I've seen a lot of documentaries on possible phenomena that could have been ""The Star.""  This is the FIRST, which has me convinced!

My only (mild) criticism is that the polish of Frederick Larson's presentation could use some work.  Some special effects might also add impact--although I admit that the simplicity of the format emphasizes the wow-factor of the information itself.

Mr. Larson has done fascinating research--Biblical and historical.  Furthermore, he uses a commercially available (and scientifically accurate) program (Starry Night Pro) to run the solar system backwards through time to see the actual nighttime skies over the Middle East at the time of Jesus' birth.  You can buy the program and verify this for yourself.  I've had the program for years, but never did the awe-inspiring research, nor found the jaw-dropping conclusions he reached.

The celestial conjunctions he describes (and shows) are 100% accurate.  The mathematics of how the solar system works do not lie.  His logical arguments on their meanings, based on historical research and astronomical symbology, are almost as difficult to assail.  The awesome implications of this material will have many shouting in excitement!  Interestingly, he also presents some similarly veined information on the date of Jesus' crucifixation which will also ""wow"" all but the most jaded hearts!

Whether you are convinced by his conclusions or not, if you aren't stunned and awed by the material in this presentation, you haven't understood it!!!

In my opinion, this documentary has a place in the home of every serious Christian.  Not to confirm your Faith, (although it may) but for its Scriptural journey and for the wonder and joy found in seeing the awesome majesty of the Creator's handiwork, written across the sky!",1204675200,70,1909,5.250825082508251

2919531,5,B000UAE7IQ,"Absolutely the best-ever presentation I have seen on the orgins of the Star of Bethlehem. 5 stars and an ""A"" for accuracy.  Check out additional reading at end of this review.

It was not a conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter (as previously thought), but of Jupiter (King planet), Venus (woman) and the star Regulus (King star).  The conjunction took place in the sign Virgo (Virgin, & the seed of the woman), and lasted just long enough to direct the 3 Kings to Bethlehem.  By the time they found where Jesus was living, He was a toddler.  King Herod found out where the three Kings went, and sent soldiers to kill every child under the age of two, but Jesus and his parents had already fled.  I also learned that God created the twelve signs of the Zodiac (the Ancient signs---not the new, pagen ones), and that the constellation Virgo was the first constellation, and Leo (the sign of the King) was the last.

The entire story of creation, birth of Christ, death of Christ, struggle with Satan, and Christ coming back as King is written in the stars.  This is the best kept secret in the world today.

It is NOT ASTROLOGY!!  This is using astronomy to read signs God has placed in the sky to announce what God is doing on earth.  The ancients knew this, they knew astromony---everyone believed in God or Gods back then.  Since that time paganism has corrupted the 12 original constellations and the fruit of that corruption is ASTROLOGY (fortune telling) which is forbidden by God.

I did some research on the precession of the stars (the movement of the constalletions over thousands of years), and found they move one degree about every 70 years.  That means it takes about 25,000 years for the constellations to revolve full-circle around the earth, and come back to where they originally began when God created the Sun, Moon and Stars!

Recommended additional reading:  ""The Gospel in the Stars"" by Joseph A. Seiss, originally published in 1882, but available at Amazon.com;, and ""Enmity between the Seeds"" by Bill Cloud (billcloud.org), 2004.
