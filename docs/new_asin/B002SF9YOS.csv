8379355,5,B002SF9YOS,"This DVD is very well done, and uses a mixture of real people and the cartoon characters of Jay Jay and his friends. Our four-year-old twins have loved the toy planes/jets/trucks and helicopter associated with Jay Jay, and now they've come to life with this DVD.  But even if a child did not have the toys, the DVD could stand alone as both entertaining and edifying to a child. I absolutely recommend it.",1272758400,3,405,4.5479452054794525
