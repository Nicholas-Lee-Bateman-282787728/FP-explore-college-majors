6609258,5,B00N47NNH8,Sweet movie.  It would never see the light of day now.  Peter Ustinov also a forgotten gem.,1415232000,3,91,4.294117647058823
6609259,5,B00N47NNH8,"A triple threat ( Writer-director-actor) from genius Peter Ustinov ! You will laugh, chuckle, smile and cuss at the same time !
How many movies can do all these ?",1414454400,3,162,4.433333333333334
6609260,4,B00N47NNH8,An amazing parody based upon Ustinov's play.....a rare gem,1413936000,2,58,5.555555555555555
6609261,3,B00N47NNH8,"While tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union rise, in the small European republic of Concordia, its President (Peter Ustinov) decides to play matchmaker to the American ambassador's daughter (Sandra Dee) and the Russian ambassador's son (John Gavin). Written and directed by Ustinov from his 1956 play, this is yet another film that shows nothing dates faster than topicality. While all the U.S. vs. Russians humor was very current and newsworthy at the time, today the jokes have all the relevance of a Bob Hope monologue on one of his 1960s TV specials. Take away the jokes and you're left with an anemic loose updating of Shakespeare's tale of two young lovers from opposing families. There are still sporadic moments like a family dinner in the Soviet ambassador's home where everyone is paranoid about spying on each other that bring a few chuckles but mostly it just fizzles. In a bit of irony, Gavin who plays the Russian ambassador's son eventually became the U.S. ambassador to Mexico during the Reagan administration. With Akim Tamiroff, Alix Talton, Tamara Shayne, Rik Van Nutter (THUNDERBALL) and Suzanne Cloutier (Mrs. Ustinov at the time).

Unfortunately the Universal DVD-r MOD is presented in a full frame transfer rather than its original wide screen aspect ratio. The transfer is a bit on the soft side.",1410134400,8,1329,5.040909090909091

6609263,4,B00N47NNH8,A treat for Sandra Dee fans.  The only problem with this print is that it appears to be missing a scene at the end where the two lovers meet in the garden.  I remember seeing this scene in a Canadian broadcast of the movie.  It would be nice if this missing footage could be restored to the American version.,1442966400,6,308,4.186440677966102
6609264,5,B00N47NNH8,It's a good print of a very old movie. I saw it after 40 years -and still loved it. An excellent light hearted comedy,1440892800,2,117,3.9166666666666665

6609268,5,B00N47NNH8,Romanoff And Juliet with Sandra Dee is great. A sweet film that might not get made now. Sandra Dee fans will like this the most.,1425859200,,128,4.16

6609270,5,B00N47NNH8,"Wonderful and sweet, this film is a true classic.  A tiny country initially overlooked by all the bigger nations until it suddenly holds the important vote in a UN initiative, now finds itself wooed by both the US and Russia with promises of aid the little country neither needs nor wants.  Peter Ustinov, as the country's leader, is delightfully adept at walking the political tightrope with much good humor.  The funny subplot of the romance between the US ambassador's daughter and the Russian ambassador's son is what gives the film its title.  The plot is in many ways a nostalgic look at a simpler, more peaceful time.",1421798400,2,624,4.803738317757009
6609271,5,B00N47NNH8,"This is a must see gem of a Cold War Comedy.  Peter Ustinov shows his delightful side in every word of the script.  It took a long time for this to come out on DVD and it was so worth the wait.  If you enjoyed other Cold War Comedies (One, Two, Three; Dr. Strangelove; The Mouse that Roared), you'll love this one as well.",1419897600,2,322,4.0
8676155,5,B00N47NNH8,"I have been looking for ROMANOFF and JULIET since it came out; I have a VHS broadcast copy, but I really wanted a DVD of this (dated) but marvelous movie. Peter Ustinov was a genius and the cast is marvelous.",1531353600,,208,4.225
8676156,1,B00N47NNH8,"Tried to play the video--didn't work.

Discovered that Windows 10 WON'T play DVD's without buying add-on software.  Bought (no money back) the MS product--still did not work.
Installed VLC, didn't work.  Called repairman, he could not make it work, finally he took it to the shop--two days and a hundred and two dollars later I have a computer that will play DVD's, but not this one--it goes to an empty-disc sounding error.

And I am now two weeks past the return date.",1490313600,,470,4.695121951219512
8676157,4,B00N47NNH8,"From 1961 comes a cute little cold war story written, directed and starring the wonderful Peter Ustinov. Ustinov is the President of a 5 mile square country called Concordia, no one else in the world seems to have a clue where it is, at a U.N. meeting a big vote takes place and it is a dead locked vote except for Concordia, everyone needs that vote to bread the deadlock and they have abstained because they don't understand the edict. Now this tiny country is in the position to have attracted the Russian and American attention and they don't want it at all. This is a sweet and cute movie, I will not say that I laughed out loud but it has some perspectives on the times that are right now both relevant and amusing.",1484611200,2,721,4.348148148148148

8676161,5,B00N47NNH8,This was a fun little movie that my husband wanted and it had been difficult for him to find. It's one of those old movies that is enjoyable to watch every once in a while. So I was happy to find it for him here on Amazon. Thanks!,1457481600,2,230,3.8125
8676162,5,B00N47NNH8,It is a fantastic movie skewering east west relation of mega-powers against the background of true love. It is very simplistic and one of Peter Ustinov's best.,1457136000,,159,4.925925925925926
8676163,5,B00N47NNH8,"Totally loved this movie, need more movies like this. Funny and smart. Just don't have actors and scripts like this any more. Such a shame.",1450051200,,139,4.6
8676164,4,B00N47NNH8,"A delightful bit of fluff. To add to the humor of cold war espionage, the actress Moura Budberg is, in reality, considered to a spy by the name of Baroness Maria [Moura] Budberg.",1447459200,,178,4.424242424242424
