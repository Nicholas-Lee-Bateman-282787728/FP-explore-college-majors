8241896,5,B0011MRX42,"I bought this movie only for Laureano Olivares. It's completely in Spanish with NO English subtitles. It's the story of a guy who rises to power & how he deals with the violence & protection of his family. The ending is sad, as is all his movies & I don't understand why that is. It's your basic naro-novela but in movie format as far as I'm concerned but 5 stars because the movie is almost all Laureano.",1330819200,,405,4.2727272727272725
