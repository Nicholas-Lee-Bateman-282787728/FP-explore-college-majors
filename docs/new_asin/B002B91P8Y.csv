8360851,3,B002B91P8Y,"After a while, despite enjoying the series of Tarzan films, they begin to become somewhat tiresome because the plots are so very similar. This is Lex Barkers fifth and last time as Tarzan. While in good form, he gave up the role rather than be type cast as the ape man and be unable to get other more significant acting jobs. Raymond Burr plays the main villain and he is probably the best actor in this movie, although he is quite fat. He was given the third credit line. As usual for this series, the title of the film is overstated and purposely sexist to draw viewers. The picture on the video cover is not in the film. She is the boss of the group killing elephants and taking their ivory tusks, but Burr is the main villain. Also, as in many of the Tarzan films, the natives are Caucasians rather than blacks. The elephant killers realize that Tarzan is hindering their ability to kill elephants because he calls out his usual call and, while we hear no difference in the sound, the elephants on a couple of occasions understand it to mean ""Get out of the area"" and on another occasion ""Come in mass and trample this enclosure and the people in it."" They try to stop Tarzan.",1312070400,2,1180,4.392694063926941
8360852,2,B002B91P8Y,"Before I review this edition of ""Tarzan and the She-Devil"", let me give you all the negatives; the Warner Archive Collection at the WB site sells this title for nearly $6 less than Amazon; there are no special features, subtitles, nor even a scene index; the encrypting process prevents this DVD from playing on any DVD player with recording capabilities (which means you probably won't be able to play this on your PC).

The final outing of Lex Barker as Tarzan (the role would next go to cowboy/lifeguard Gordon Scott), ""Tarzan and the She-Devil"" is a film of mixed blessings; while the production values are poor, the cast is actually quite impressive, with screen veterans Monique van Vooren (who is certainly no 'she-devil'!), and Tom Conway (""The Falcon"", and George Sanders' real-life brother) as greedy partners with the fabulous Raymond Burr (a few years before ""Godzilla"" and ""Perry Mason""). Although unshaven and overweight, Burr is magnetic as a villainous ivory hunter, easily stealing the film from the rest of the cast (Barker included).

The bad guys need big, burly types to round up elephants, and Burr captures the men of yet another Caucasian village in the heart of Africa, to do the job. Tarzan rescues them, thwarting the plan, and van Vooren decides to kidnap Jane (feisty Joyce Mackenzie, in her only appearance as Tarzan's mate), to force him to do their bidding. Unfortunately, Jane fights back, Tarzan's famous jungle treehouse gets burned down, and Jane, after escaping, contracts a fever that renders her unconscious (with fevered flashbacks of previous Tarzan exploits...including one, underwater, with JOHNNY WEISSMULLER!!!) Tarzan, thinking Jane is dead, is a broken man, and becomes a passive prisoner with the recaptured villagers. After being healed at the village, Jane confronts van Vooren, who takes her to Tarzan to prove she's alive (not very 'she-devilish' of her!) Despite being chained, beaten, and weak from hunger, Tarzan must find a way to save the day!

At a scant 75 minutes, cramming this much plot (as well as the obligatory Cheeta antics) into the mix gives the film a 'rushed' look, with a resolution so fast that if you blink, the film is over! In a sense, it was a shame that this would be Barker's swansong; he had grown into the role, and was a far better actor than he'd been at the start of his run. With the changes ahead for the Ape Man, he might have achieved the respect as an actor that would elude him, the rest of his life.

An interesting finale for a five-year Tarzan career!",1252022400,5,2543,4.87962962962963
