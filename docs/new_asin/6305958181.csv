1094231,5,6305958181,"A Jim Jarmusch film is always a celebration, and this one is no exception.  Probably his best ever, Jarmusch managed to combine a typical gangster  film, comedy,  and a touch of spiritual insights.
Forrest Whitaker plays  a modern day Samurai - a hit men for the Italian Mafia who follow the old  codes of ancient Japans's samurais: Faithfull to his master - and willing  to die for him not to show any disrespect, equipped with the latest  technology aiding him in his ""work""
The Italian Mafia men, are  portrayed as aging men lost in the modern world, attached to their old  codes, who find refuge watching cartoons on TV.
The film is accompanied  with great rap music getting you in the mood, and quotes from the samurai  book are woven between scenes.
Not too action packed - though corps are  stacked by the dozen, this film can appeal to both action seekers as well  as alternative film gurus.",961372800,,899,4.613924050632911

1094363,5,6305958181,"I love this strange and philosophical little action-drama.  And I have to agree that Forest Whitaker was a perfect pick for the lead role!

As I type this, Vinnie is alternately moaning and scolding my attention to this matter.  But Vinnie is an alpha-male by nature, a testosterone-driven athlete, just entering his prime!  I don't think Vinnie's Sicilian, or even Italian...  But Vinnie is a pigeon!  And he's currently my best friend...

Before Vinnie, there was my darling Bernie, my closest and dearest friend for better than eighteen years, right alongside my beloved wife (and she would smile because she felt the same way about him).  Bernie was a pigeon too.

You need to ""know"" these birds to understand just ""who"" and ""what"" they are.  What they are is surprising!  What they are is amazing!

If memory serves, the longest documented homing of a pigeon on record was some 10,000 miles, from Africa back to England!  Pigeons are so dedicated to this task, injured birds have been known to ""walk"" home, if they can.

Do a web search on The Dickin Medal (the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross).  In fact, Wikipedia's article and recipient roster is complete enough to make the point--you'll find more pigeons listed than dogs there!  And these don't even acknowledge the WWI heroes, like Cher Ami.  Sadly, the majority of pigeons that served were never recognized.

Only in the last hundred years or so have we come to disparage the noble pigeon, our ""Oldest Feathered Friend"".  Grow a little!  Check the Movies & TV, and Book sections of Amazon, to learn more about the impressive and surprising pigeon!  Human history is steeped in noble pigeon lore.

Through human history, pigeons nourished our bodies, fertilized our crops, delivered our critical--even lifesaving--messages, and they saved our lives.  And I can tell you firsthand that pigeons make excellent and rewarding animal companions.  I was never once lonely while in Bernie's most excellent company; and Vinnie is getting there.  Mike Tyson is onto something!

Oh, I also have considerable martial arts training and am into firearms and knives.  As Ghost Dog shows us, gentleness is not weakness, and belligerence is not strength; no one should confuse these things.

Anyway, you can probably see why this film has some special appeal for me...

That's all!  No point in reiterating what others have said...  If you enjoy the occasional, odd little philosophical action-drama, give this one a try!

I give it an easy Five Stars because it's beautifully executed and there's literally nothing else remotely like it--at least that I have seen!

RayB

P.S.  If we ever suffer an EMP event, the pigeon's unique messenger-homing abilities will become invaluable--again.",1499644800,,2742,5.044642857142857

1094569,4,6305958181,"The eponymous protagonist of Jim Jarmusch's 1999 film GHOST DOG is an African-American hitman (Forest Whitaker) working for an Italian mafia in New Jersey and living according to the Hagakure, Japan's samurai code. After a hit goes wrong through no fault of the assassin's own, his mafia liaison Louie (John Tormey) is sympathetic, but explains that his superiors now want Ghost Dog dead. The film follows Ghost Dog's revenge and depicts a clash between two ancient tribes that both seem out of date in this modern world: Ghost Dog's samurai code and Italian mafia ideas of loyalty.

Jarmusch has always been open about the fact that he soaks up a huge number of inspirations from earlier films, books, and music and then lets them reflect in his own work. Any cinephile will instantly recognize Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Le-Samoura/dp/B0087J47PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Le Samoura</a>&nbsp;as the point of departure for GHOST DOG. In Meville's classic, a Parisian hired assassin lives according to a strict code. But Melville didn't really know much about Japan, and even the quotation from a samurai text at the beginning of his film was just made up by Meville himself. Jarmusch seems to have decided, ""OK, I'll show you a hired-assassin film that's *really* rooted in the code of the Samurai"". Forest Whitaker quotes from Hagakure throughout the film, and there are also references to the work of Akira Kurosawa.

But GHOST DOG is not a remake, and Jarmusch takes the basic premise in a very individual direction. There's a lot of humour here, something missing from the serious Melville inspiration. In casting for the mafia dons, Jarmusch chose faces as brutal and distinctive as Dick Tracy's rogues gallery: Henry Silva as the don, and Cliff Gorman and Gene Ruffini as his righthand men. But Jarmusch then gives them the occasional zany line that cracks that chilling faade. Isaach de Bankole plays a supporting role as a French-speaking Haitian immigrant and Ghost Dog's best friend, a role that is pure comic relief because the man doesn't speak English and Ghost Dog doesn't understand French, but they always manage to understand each other.

Until the late 1990s, Jarmusch had mainly been known as a fairly low-budget independent filmmaker writing cute little stories about personal relationships in low-key American life. Jarmusch's America was consistently depicted as run-down neighbourhoods and overgrown vacant lots. With its generous budget, large cast and special effects, GHOST DOG marked a huge leap forward in Jarmusch's work. Still, it maintains Jarmusch's interest in America as a land of urban blight and seedy underbellies: most of the film takes place in an ugly New Jersey urban setting. Furthermore, instead of being glamorized, the Italian mafia is depicted as a spent force, mainly elderly men who can't rake in the cash and influence they used to, and even forced to pay protection money to Chinese newcomers. As the film reaches its shocking ending, the glamour is drained from Ghost Dog's warrior code, as well.

The music for GHOST DOG was provided by RZA, at the time still best known as part of the Wu-Tang Clan. The music mainly consists of wordless beats, though, with actual rapping only at a few points. Personally, I find the use of hip-hop a weak point of the film (Jarmusch looks like an outsider looking in to this scene, unable to organically make it part of his own work), and RZA's insistence on appearing in the film itself disrupts the rhythm of the film's climax.",1470441600,,3599,5.189328743545611

In December 2013 a crew installed the fiber optic cable up to our house at easy hookup for our telephone company.  I think the fiber optic cable installers were paid with government money aspart of a program to enable good internet in rural areas.  My phone company said they would hook us up to fiber optic cable by April 2014.  So far, the telephone company has not coonected us up to the fiber optic cable & when I call they always say they will hook us up in a few months (saying that for more than two years now).

1095187,5,6305958181,"Movies with great soundtracks which quote liberally from great books are a rarity.  This film introduced me to _The Hagakure_and the RZA.  Ultimately I found ""Afro-Samurai"" when looking for more RZA music.  If there isn't a sequel to this soon I'm going to write one.  The relationship between this cold-blooded assassin and the little girl with the lunchbox full of books will warm your heart.  It also muddies the traditional line between the shinobi (ninja) assassins and samurai defenders.  Ghost Dog is more of a preemptive strike kind of samurai guard.

The other beautiful thing about this film which it shares with ""Leon"" a.k.a.""The Professional"", aside from the New York City setting, is the clash of old and new cultures.  The Italian underboss singing Public Enemy lyrics to the aging Godfather-like boss as an attempt to explain Ghost Dog's street name is a scene which should be in film school curricula as ""how one culture misunderstands another"".

Jim Jarmush hides jokes everywhere in what appears to be a very violent and profane film.  Forest Whitaker's Haitian best friend is brilliantly played by an actor I've seen in many films subsequent to this one.  This is a movie to own.

Having to watch Forest Whitaker attempt to live a samurai/hit-man way of life was just pure torture and blatant disrespect to the actual samurai. I even feel like real hitmen would be pissed. Why does he flip a cd around before putting it in the CD player? Is it supposed to look cool or be some kind of ninja star? The sound the gun makes while he whips it around the place is just comical. Am I expected to believe this guy is so fast he cuts through the air when he pulls his gun out? Cmon!!! And why the pigeons?

Don Quixote crazily followed the nonsensical books of chivalry of his day and thought he could become a Knight Errant. Ghost Dog similarly models his life and actions on an old, alien book of rules for samurai warriors.

What a unique combination, and what a masterpiece this flick is.  For those of you looking for a one-dimensional action flick, this ain't it, but there is superb action. Consider the scene where Ghost Dog (after narrating from the Hagakure that it is best for a samurai to 'rush in headlong') goes in to the villa and pops all the gangsters, except, of course, his retainer, because of the samurai code.  That's one of the great action sequences ever filmed, surely, and very smart and funny at the same time.

Ghost Dog falls into conflict with them while still trying to be loyal toward his boss. The writing is clever, all the actors are all up for the game, and the movie is completely entertaining.

Ghost dog is about a lonely urban contract man.
He styles himself after a Samurai and gets into a conflict with some hoods that style themselves after Mafia gangsters.

This movie has some violence/shootouts and some hilarity - sometimes both at the same time, so if you liked movies like ""The Boondock Saints"", or ""7 Psychopaths"", that type of thing- you would probably enjoy this movie.  The little girl playing Pearline, does a great job.

The movie has a lot of cliches, but it doesn't try to take itself too seriously, so the cliches didn't bother me; I feel it is almost a send-up.

For example: The scene where Sonny tries to explain the use of the name ""Ghost Dog"", and they wind up making a judgment about street names.... It's obvious that Louie understands how ridiculous the conversation is but he can't laugh.

1096458,3,6305958181,"I liked this movie very much, but with reservation.

Ghost Dog is a man in a lonely place
and without hope of anything but the good death
that he sought.
He lives on a tenement rooftop where he raises
passenger pidgeons as a hobby and as a means
of discreet communication, necessary because
of his profession, murderer.

Having been rescued from death and living on borrowed
time, he serves his rescuer as an assassin following
a philosophical code from a book written by a Samurai.
Some passages from that book, short pearls of wisdom,
appear on screen and are read by Dog periodically
throughout the movie.

Dog's master is part of an Italian mafia family.
An extremely dysfunctional family.
This is the part that was mediocre.
The men of this ""family"" were portrayed as complete
imbeciles. Their world was punctuated by low grade
television cartoons in the way Dog's was by Samurai philosophy.
They were so goofy and idiotic that they became comic relief.
The film would have been so much better had the
Italians been taken seriously.

Therein lies the primary problem that I had
with the movie. It was certainly racist in intent.
All of the white people in the movie were so stupid
and destructive that it was better for them to be dead.

There is one scene that I don't want to spoil by describing
completely. It was very strange, apparently completely
disconnected from the plot, and the type of scene that one
usually finds in a special feature. Dog cruises in his slick
ride, dressed in a stylish suit, along a dirt road in the woods
and comes upon two ""white"" guys in camo who had just
killed a big black bear. Get it? Well, if you are a little slow
on the uptake you need only recall that Dog's friend thinks
of Dog as a bear. This scene must be very important for the
very reason that it seems disconnected.

Ghost Dog is not a nice guy.
He a murderer for hire and a thief,
but we are lead to believe, as he does,
that somehow it is alright because he lives
according some ancient code in a little book.
A gentle, intellectual, remorseless mass-murderer.
Whitey probably made him that way.
Too bad he didn't find a different little book.

What I liked a lot about this movie was the pacing,
the relationships he had with the ice-cream guy,
the little girl and the dog, the bird's-eye viewpoints,
the score and the mystical nature of the Ghost
part of Dog's persona.

Ghost could hide in broad daylight, move amongst people
unnoticed unless they were soul-mates,
even steal the license plate off a car with a clear line of site
to the owners of the car sitting nearby at a picnic table,
indicating a sort of divine (or diabolical) providence at work.

The pacing was slow and steady.
Nobody moved too fast.
Everyone seemed resigned to the fickle finger of fate.
Dog himself always walked and moved as if he had bricks
strapped to his shoes, even when practicing his martial arts.
There were long, but not too long, lingering close-ups
of facial expressions, even of a dog, and they were great.

The score was well suited to the images
to achieve the appropriate mood.

Dog's relationship with the ice cream man was great.
Dog speaks English, the ice cream man speaks French,
neither understands what the other is saying, but they
have conversations and shared experiences.

There's a man building a large boat on the roof
of a tenement building,
perhaps a symbol of the frustrated longing
to be somewhere else, anywhere else,
to have a different life, that,
time and circumstances conspire against
and an attempt to keep that dream alive,
at least in spirit.

Definitely worth watching once, maybe twice.
A unique and captivating dream that you are drawn into.
When it ends, it is like waking up.",1313366400,4,3706,4.6310975609756095
1096549,5,6305958181,"Wonderful movie that for me was a reminder on civilization. Too many people today don't understand what civilization and civilized behavior is. I think this movie is a highly complex multi-layered movie with several distinct meanings. Forest Whitaker, plays an assassin who follows the code of the Samurai. This basic idea is alone quite original. The movie explores several characters and some of the brilliance of the movie is in the lack of the expensive Hollywood sets, characters and multi-million dollars budgets typically seen.

The movie, at times appears to be slow and almost feels like a documentary but this is also what makes this movie unconventionally cool and thought provoking.",1309737600,3,694,5.252252252252252

1096551,2,6305958181,"When I watched Ghost Dog some time ago, I was confused but also very embarassed as I thought obviously either the protagonist or the writer didn't understand anything about the Way of the Samurai.  But having seen Melville's film Le Samourai, I can now explain Ghost Dog.  Le Samourai is a non-sequitur in which the title of the film has essentially nothing to do with the plot (assassination) or theme (solitude) of the film.  Ghost Dog is an homage re-make of Le Samourai that says ""let's try to make the title relate to the plot.""  It's that simple, and that's why the film fails.  The idea of a overweight, out of shape inner-city contract killer who derives some lifestyle from reading Hagakure and swinging around a samurai sword is ridiculous and not even clever or fun if you actually know anything about Japanese history, martial arts culture, or, especially, the actual contents of Hagakure.  Like Le Samourai, Ghost Dog depends entirely on fashion and film history for any success.",1307232000,2,992,4.840236686390533
1096552,2,6305958181,"This film was made during the height of the rap, ghetto, hoodlum, gangsta, bling bling craze. The movie is saturated with the stuff - giant gold medallions, repetitious drum rhythms, rap music, hooded sweatshirts, slow motion walking, possees, prestige cars, hoodlum hand signing, Ebonics, crab walking etc etc. (is this stuff still popular by the way?)

Every non-white person in the film reads books on philosophy, are kindhearted, gentle, one with nature (or pigeons at least), courteous, and principled...whether they are a gang member, a hitman, an eight year old or the ice-cream-man. Every white person (whitey I suppose) in the film is portrayed as an ignorant, prejudiced, flabby, cold hearted, dislikeable, unprincipled, racist slob or slut who's entire knowledge of the world comes from watching cartoons from the 40s and 50s.  No one is perfect but I really don't think the races are distinguished from each other as succinctly as this film professes.  What a message!

All the white actors performances either falls flat, are over the top, unrealistic or very stilted. A George Romero zombie actor does a better job. Even the usually excellent B action star Henry Silva's acting is poor or at least very very strange and he is way underused. I have to believe it is what the director wanted and is not the actors' fault.

Ghost Dog is really not an action movies in spite of a numerous killings. The film is way too slow for that but it's not a suspense film either as the pasty white mobsters are a bunch of soft, dimwitted, dopey, doughy, slow moving, cartoon watching, octogenarians with bad physiques and over cooked Bayonne, Brooklyn, Bronx accents(?) who could not scare a five year old.  By the way - they never do let you know where this thing is supposed to be taking place.  The Highway State? Where is that?

It's like watching a tired 80s screwball gangster disco movie only with rap and bling bling fashion instead of bell bottoms and flare collared shirts. A different fad a different time era. Just as dated, and pretty much as lame.

For anyone who is offended by language - Ghost dog is peppered - OK battered with the F word and the N word and not the N word with the ""ah"" sound at the end. It's the N word the way we don't like it, used liberally and loud in offensive ways.

Another aspect in the film is the re-occurring reading from the book of rules for Samurai warriors. These passages are read by our hero/hitman Ghost Dog - complete with blacked out title cards (just in case you might have problems understanding the Ghost Dog)  This comes off as a cringingly pretentious clich. I defy anyone to get anything out of these Samurai rules - at least from the way they are represented in the movie.  The only one that I can somewhat recall goes something like this - if it rains and you run fast and move from roof to roof - you are still likely to get wet. Well dahh. I guess we are supposed to apply this rule to other aspects of life. Like whenever we decide we need to kill someone I suppose.  I have to believe something got lost in the translation from Japanese to English - poor Ghosty - this book is his only guide.

A far easier to understand part of the film - is the re-occurring cartoons which worked to some degree as they are used to either comment on the action or to predict something that is about to happen.  The only problem is that the cartoons are for more annoying than not and the zombie-like mobster cartoon watchers lives revolve around these bad cartoons for reasons never explained. They are clearly not learning anything from them.

Finally to Forest Whitaker - Ghost Dog.  Forest is the redeeming aspect of the entire film.  Part of the reason for this is his very unconventional appearance for the role he is playing. Yes he is one of slowest, out-of-shape samurai warriors we will ever see. He even looks like a jelly donut when he is shot. He is big, wide and lumbers even when practicing his samurai sword moves. (if Ghost Dog comes after you - just run - There is no way Ghost Dog is going to catch you).  For no apparent reason Ghost Dog goes in and out of gansta body language and speech  - this inconsistency hurt Forest's performance. He also tends to play drab rap on his CD player to our great dissatisfaction as it serves as the soundtrack (Holst, Beethoven or traditional Japanese would have been far more bad ass).  But luckily Forest's face works for him and saved the film from a one star review.  His inner world is telegraphed by what is essentially a calm, kindly, sad, gentle, demeanor, and expressions, and his calculated actions and his long uncritical observant gazes give him the only character with some kind of believability. He may have the traits of a thug but he never comes off as one. Unfortunately Forest is often saddled with some pretty bad dialogue and illogical situations.  His ludicrous walk up the street at the end of the film for one. (That Samurai book is sure filled with some bad advice and poor Ghosty seems to lack the mental skills to think outside the box...er book.)

So if the film is not suspenseful and not an action movie - what is it?  I have to believe it is working from an artistic philosophical, and social point of view. Philosophically: maybe achieving excellence or duty?  Socially: maybe communication? Art - combining a bunch of film elements - French film noire, hit men films, mob films, Japanese martial arts films, spaghetti westerns, and revenge films, along with the gangsta/rap genre. But what you end up with (which one usually ends up with when you combine way too many elements) is a very uneven hodge podge with no real cohesion - kind of a mess.

The plot - and I do not believe this is spoiler - I won't tell the ending. Forest Whitaker's life is saved by a low grade mobster. Forest reads a book on the rules of the Samurai, changes his name to Ghost Dog and decides (from the book's advice) that he must be the mobster's servant or retainer as Ghost Dog likes to say. Which means the mobster is his boss for life meaning Ghost will ""take-out"" folks for this mobster guy at bargain prices.  Not ""wash the guys car"" or be his ""temporary man servant"" or ""send a card at Christmas"" mind you, but murder people for the guy. Why couldn't Ghost Dog have read a book by Dale Carnegie? or maybe had his life saved by a CPA? It would have saved everyone allot of trouble. The Samurai book has allot of very bad advice in it such as you must respect your boss to a very high degree - like let him kill you - if he so chooses. (You might want to check with your ombudsman first before you go along with that one)  Well as things would have it the mob puts a hit on poor ole G-Dog because G-Dog killed some dumb guy for them (which really made no sense at all) and after that its a pretty typical and predictable plot where the allusive and deadly hitman gets a hit put on him by the guys he does hits for.  It's not a new plot by any means but we could have lived with it if it had been done better.

If anyone is interested or patient enough to enjoy a ""thoughtful"" and very influential, subtitled in English, hit man movie.  I suggest you pick up the even slower, more cerebral, much cooler, much better, (and contains no racism), much older (but not as much dated film ) ""Le Samurai"" - A film that had to have influenced Ghost Dog and many other hit man films to no little degree.

Allot of people loved Ghost Dog - check out the numerous 5 star reviews - so maybe it's a cultural thing. I for one found it to have a very low believability quotient, very uneven, pretty dull,(very close to mind numbing) ludicrously acted, questionably scripted, very repetitious, and often annoying mob hit man revenge film with very heavy and dated the gansta/rap influences.

The films wide screen photography is very good and looks great great on DVD, crisp and clear and the sound is a decent 5 channel surround - not to many uses of the surround  but no complaints either.

On a final note - a real cute stray ""ghost"" dog showed up in the film twice -he was cool to look at - too bad he wasn't used in the movie more.  There was also a very nice opening aerial scene where the credits role - That scene contained the one piece of music in the film that I liked.",1306454400,5,8284,4.465871438038436

I'll review it better in future, but everything comes together. The music, the ""poetry"" of war (which is Dead Man theme also) and the meditative feel. Like Dead Man it has animism themes, the black dog. There's great lines in it that I get and the ""feel"" is right if you get my meaning. You sort of experience Dead Man and Ghost Dog, not watch it. It's just.... like a poetic experience, pigeons on a roof, reading a book, he understand his friend through the ""feel"" of him because he can't speak his language. Forrest Whitaker is perfect in it.

This follows a modern day hitman who acts according to ancient Japanese/Samurai principles. He is double crossed by the mafia bosses who hire him and his enacts his vengeance according to the same strict moral code. This is inter-cut throughout with passages from the Hagukure which gives an insight into the mindset of Ghost Dog and why he behaves as he does. This has a `made for TV' quality about it and the only big name is Forest Whitaker himself. The mob guys come across as clichd stereotypes who use stock phrases and mafia style names, but this is a minor issue and mainly serves to highlight that they are a parody of themselves throughout. This has gained minor cult status over the years and it is a fine film, it wasn't as great as I'd anticipated and it was a very slow starter, but it has a good enough story and kept me watching to the end. I wasn't kept on the edge of my seat and I didn't feel much tension, but I liked the idea of a modern hitman acting on ancient principles and this aspect was carried out very well.

1096556,5,6305958181,"""Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai"" is a movie that will cause the viewer to think and observe.  The mentally vegetative viewer looking for a couple of escapist hours will be completely bored by the melodic pace of the movie.

A victim of a racist attack finds honor, purpose, and commitment when his life is saved by a total stranger.  He consequently constructs a life balancing serenity and violence, a life built upon his interpretation of ancient eastern Samurai traditions.  His effort brings him respect from the many people who know him, and focused purpose for his life.  As the story progresses, you meet the people he knows.  The ice cream man, the little girl, and the mafioso daughter are all searching for meaning and purpose in their own way.

One can easily recognize the contrast between his meditation on the depth of the ancient ways and the superficial focus of one modern mafioso family.  The cartoons are one example of the crime family's simplicity, but observe closely, they also tell exactly what is coming next in the story.

Although unrelated to this movie, in the book ""The Great Santini"" there is a line that references a military general's demeanor.  The line states ""he has the quiet confidence of a man who believes in himself and doesn't need a structure to reinforce that belief.""

Other than that, while the premise of the movie was good, the story was very weak, the movie ""dragged-on"" terribly in some spots (ok, I can see that Ghost Dog can drive a car and listen to music, but how many scenes do we have to watch it, and for some many minutes at a time???).  Also , the actors that played the old-time ""mob"", I think the producer must have gotten some friends to act for these parts (I use the term, ""ACT"" very liberally here), they were so bad, and so cheesy, one of them reminded me of Rodney Dangerfield trying to play a mobster (I shouldn't say that, I liked Rodney, but this guy???).

The context of this film is built around the Hagakure and how those concepts have been internalized by the lead character.  This particular samurai totes a gun for his modern work but in every way is very, very samurai. It's actually more samurai than a lot of films that have more swords.

I liked the mis-en-scene and the way the character's progress the story.  I liked that there are no extra scenes; each scene has a story it tells that particularly informs the next.  I will warn, however, that the film is built like a short story.  This is not a film about layers and layers of people.  The actors give the film a sense of depth, but as presented the film is backdrop to understand how the lead sees himself through the lens of Hagakure and a samurai mythology.  In that way, the characters are frequently caricatures, but they're fun to watch.

The writer and director gives us some funny if also corny moments that stand out and make it one of those bubble-gum and pop-corn kind of movies that Samurai movie buffs love.  If that will bother you, move on to something else.  For example, there is a scene where the lead character is using his guns in a way that is very reminiscent of swords, including a spin as he completes a noto (resheathing).

Ghost Dog, in summary, sounds like a standard action or mob film. The title hero, Whitaker, is a black hit man in New York, working for the mob with a special personal bond of loyalty to one the mobsters, not the top guy. He gets entangled in a complicated farce of an honor issue of the senile and ridiculous gangsters that dominate the film. The top mobster, a ghost- like Henry Silva, decides that the hitman must be killed.
Ghost Dog has self-styled himself as a samurai, and he follows the code as he sees it from a book that he reads on his roof, where lives with his carrier pigeons. He fights back with restraints of loyalty.

Those who take the film as a normal action film will be disappointed. It is an absurd farce on the genre, with great dialogues and cinematography.

Forrest Whitaker is an exceptional actor and here he does not disappoint. He  IS a samurai, walking each step with compassion, yet keeping to his duty with calculated grace.

with a lone wolf hero taking on the mob a la Marlon Brando.  True, there are similarities.  Both Terry Malloy and Ghost Dog are more connected to children and pigeons than they are to the adult world - but the former is so because he remains a childlike and illiterate palooka whilst the latter actually reads, takes children seriously, and communicates more on a ""spiritual"" or emotional level than he does on a verbal level.  Apart from his pigeons, Ghost Dog (played by Forest Whitaker) connects or communicates best with a young girl with whom he discusses literature - including Rashomon, Frankenstein and Wind in the Willows - an ice cream vendor who only speaks French, a silent dog of the street, and intermittently with street rappers en passant. It is these elements too which remain central to the film, rather than the comical mobsters, who fumble and bumble their way through life and for recreation spend their time watching Felix Cartoons circa 1935.  It is quite refreshing to see gangsters or mobsters treated like this instead of romanticised as they usually are in such iconic works as THE GODFATHER trilogy and THE SOPRANOS.  Lets face it, there are similarities between ""the captains of industry"" and the so called mob in Western society - the means they use may differ but their purpose and intent may remain the same.
A marxist interpretation of this work is entirely plausible.  Equally, Hasidic Jews of Brooklyn would relate to it and understand its themes whilst deploring its violence.  Nevertheless, it seems to me one major theme is that of the Artist in a hostile and materialistic landscape attempting to survive. And surviving means self discipline, being true to one's beliefs, treating small things with great importance (his ice cream eating is undertaken with a reverence similar to a Japanese tea ceremony) and treating large things lightly (death is treated lightly).
But, the film is rich enough for the viewer to bring to it his or her own experience and enjoy on many levels.
Mr Whitaker holds the centre of the film with consummate skill - to me it's some of his best work. (To upstage Paul Newman as the laboratory experiment pool player in The Color of Money was pretty darn good too!)

At night he goes to work as a hit man, performing his tasks stealthily and invisibly, abiding by the codes established by HAGAKURE: THE BOOK OF THE SAMURAI, an 18th-century text.

One night, while on his latest hit, Ghost Dog encounters a mob boss's beautiful daughter, Louise (Tricia Vessey). Although Ghost Dog leaves her unharmed, her father nonetheless orders Ghost Dog's execution, to the dismay of Louie (John Tormey), his loyal retainer. As the mobsters struggle to locate the mysteriously untraceable Ghost Dog, he must find a way to protect himself while remaining loyal to Louie and the ancient codes that define him as an individual.

That choice seems prescient on Jarmusch's part - seven years after ""Ghost Dog,"" Whitaker's acting skills, wise role-picking and genial personality landed him at the top of the heap with his justly-rewarded portrayal of Idi Amin in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-King-of-Scotland-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000NIVJF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition)</a>.

Much of the tone of ""Ghost Dog"" is set by the score, drafted entirely by Wu-Tang Clan leader The RZA (who also makes a cameo appearance in the film - he's the guy in camouflage who greets Ghost Dog on the sidewalk towards the end).  RZA's presence isn't an afterthought - Jarmusch says he had in mind from the start a film with RZA as an equal collaborator.

Isaach De Bankol is a delightful presence as ice cream truck driver Raymond.  Also of note:  the scenes featuring a slightly younger version of Ghost Dog are, in fact, filmed with Forest Whitaker's younger brother Damon (thank you, IMDB).",1184976000,,1408,5.613207547169812
1096907,4,6305958181,"This is a very good film. The uniqueness of Whitaker's real-life persona enhances the unique character he brings to the screen. Ghost Dog displays all the discipline of a martial arts master but with a gun in hand. From this perspective he is far removed from the on-screen likes of Bruce Lee, Jim Kelly and Jet Li but equally as deadly. The film does not hide the fact the methods of destruction used by Ghost Dog are not only outlandish but straight out of a cartoon fantasy. This adds to its entertainment value: we know we're being taken for a ride. It's a fun trip. Whitaker's supporting cast round out this excellent ensemble work.",1179792000,,637,4.5964912280701755
1096908,5,6305958181,"Yesterday I tried in vain to encourage some of my friends, who had never even heard of Ghost Dog, to plan on watching it someday, and I obviously failed to give them even a mere glimpse of the magnitude of the story and its central character, Ghost Dog!

One friend said, ""I can't believe you would enjoy a movie about an assassin! It seems so unlike you.""

Yes, this is a movie about an impoverished, urban Black man, who survives by doing hits for his local Mob, but it is so much more, that it ranks right up there at the top of my favorite movie list.

Raised by a movie loving father who early on introduced me to independent American films and international films, such as Rashomon, with Tashiro Mifune and the French film, The Red Balloon, the sweetness of this very spiritual movie lives on and is one I know I will never forget.

I was already a Forest Whitaker fan, when I saw Ghost Dog for the first time, but since then, he has been firmly established, in my opinion, as one of the most poetic actors of our age. In this movie, he communicates at the highest levels of consciousness...sometimes by staying silent.

Ghost Dog is a masterpiece. Don't deprive yourself...rent it. Or better yet, buy it!",1178236800,5,1211,4.461538461538462
1096909,1,6305958181,"I would recommend viewing this movie, but only if you are a movie critic in training. It offers up a plethora of things to pick on. I bought this movie based on a 5 star review from another amazon.com customer, which makes me think he's just another online movie merchant.

I personally like Forest Whitaker as an actor, but he is horribly miscast for this role. He does not have the dexterity or physical presence to make the character he is playing believable. Even though he is a good sized guy, he is awkward and comes off as non-threatening. His movements are clumsy and comical. You almost feel embarrassed for him during his training scenes. With that said, with proper direction and editing it would have been possible to pull it off, but neither of those skills were present in this film.

The main villain appears to be dead throughout the entire movie. Though he is not, you would be hard pressed to find a pulse. The mob gang comes off as old, tired, and weak. If you were to meet one of them in a dark ally, you should come out the other end with their wallet. Some of the dialog is mildly interesting and you see a little humor in it, but the scenes are slow and don't move quickly enough. Not that fast in and of itself is good, but the material doesn't merit the time invested.

There is a lot of ""race"" tossed in to give the movie an authentic ""made by Hollywood"" feel. You can't miss the message, though they are talking to a generation already half in the grave.

When it comes to the writer/director of the movie, I am almost at a loss for words. The movie had potential but poor casting and direction puts it squarely in the ""sorry honey but the cover looked good"" annals of movie buying/renting.

A serious ""do not watch"" rating.",1172275200,8,1751,4.408668730650155
1096910,4,6305958181,"I always find Forest Whitaker engaging.  There is a pathos behind his characterizations that draws me in, no matter who the character is or what good or horrible things they are engaged in.  In this movie, he plays a man who, in flashback, was rescued as a boy by a Mafioso with a kindly streak.  Since that time he has felt a loyalty to Louie (played well by John Tormey).  This boy worked and studied hard and turned himself into a very skilled and professional murderer (hit man).  He lives totally alone, except for the carrier pigeons he raises and uses to communicate with Louie.  Whitaker's character has taken the name Ghost Dog and is known and respected in the neighborhood (ghetto).

He reads in the park and develops a small conversational relationship with a little girl named Pearline (played by the engaging Camille Winbush - whom you may know as `Nessa on the Bernie Mac Show).  His best friend is a man who sells ice cream from a van who speaks only French and understands no English.  Ghost Dog never knows what he is saying, but we do because of the subtitles.  We see that they pretty much know each other very well, even without actual conversation.  It is a very light a nice touch for a film that could have been quite dark and heavy.

The story involves a hit that Ghost Dog is hired to make.  He doesn't know that the person he is killing is a made mobster who has made the local family's boss quite angry.  Even though Ghost Dog does exactly what he is required to do, someone has to take the fall for killing a made guy.  Guess who?  Louie?

This mob family is quite a hoot.  They are on such hard times that they are behind on the rent for the place they use for their hangout.  The big boss even has his estate for sale.

Roger Ebert says that he got a better feel for the movie when he watched it with the view that Ghost Dog is insane.  After all, offering this loyalty to Louie when it is clearly not reciprocated and living by a code that only he has is not really rational.  I think Ebert has a point.

It is not a particularly bloody movie, but the language is harsh and the subject matter is murder.  Still, it has some very comical moments and memorable characters.  And it has Forest Whitaker, which is an awful lot.",1170633600,3,2254,4.3349282296650715

One must remember, throughout, that the Samurai must face death gladly and without fear and that one must, above all, honor one's retainer.  Forest Whitaker does a commendable job throughout and the rest of the cast does a decent job as well.  Most of the characters have some depth and the story is unique.

The core of this film to me is the interesting supporting roles, not to downplay Whitaker's fine performance.  Each and every one of them rings true, including the old mob guys, among whom the great Henry Silva is as usual superb.

My favorite example is the man building a boat, who like Ghost Dog is doing something he has a passion for though it is completely out of place in modern society.

Just the same there's enough oddities here for some enjoyable surprises.

The one problem I had with the movie was that they didn't seem to understand how carrier pigeons work... having a single pigeon flying back and forth delivering messages as if it were a bicycle messenger, but it's a minor problem.

Forrest Whittaker plays this role beautifully, believably, and memorably, moving from scene to scene with something akin to grace - I hesitate to say GRACE... for some reason, probably because it's a violent film.

The depiction of the aging NY gangsters is worth the price however. The wiseguys will remind you of relatives if you're from RI or Ma.

They are pathetic - Whittaker is Grace.

I watched an amazement on the first viewing, chuckling here and there. By the third viewing, I just laughing out loud throughout much of it. The dark, subtle humor in here is as good as I've ever seen on film....even though it may be classified more of a gangster film than a comedy.

The humor mainly involved the gangsters, who were a bunch of old Mafia men. A mob never looked this pathetic but they were characters. It was especially fun to see Henry Silva again, a man who used to be an effective villain back on a lot of TV shows in the 1960s. He didn't say much in this movie but the looks on his face were priceless. The funniest guy, at least to me, was the mobster who sang and danced to rap music!

The byplay between ""Ghost Dog,"" the hero of the movie played wonderfully by Forest Whitaker, and the ice cream man, who only spoke French, also was fun and entertaining. Almost every character in here was a strange, led by Whitaker who plays a modern-day hit-man who lives by the code of the ancient Samurai warriors. He also trains and communicates through carrier pigeons. Hey, I said this was a bizarre movie!

The violence was no-nonsense, however, nothing played for laughs and unlike Rambo-mentality, people who were shot at were hit and usually killed right away.

Along the way on this strange tale was a lesson or two on loyalty, racism, philosophies, kindness, communication, etc. How much of this you take seriously, and how much as a gag, is up to you, I guess. The more I watch this, the more I see it as clever put-on comedy....yet sad. It's not to easy to describe but you wind up getting involved with these odd people.

The movie changes rapidly as Whitaker does in this story. One minute he is a brutally bear-like hit-man and the next minute, the gentlest of

souls.

A very unique film. The title looks a bit stupid and one you would easily dismiss as moronic, but it is far from it. Great entertainment.",1145232000,4,2074,4.45646437994723

The elements I loved revolved around Ghost Dog himself - his rooftop lifestyle, the quotes throughout, his mysticism with animals and ancient paths, his training, his intuitive relationship to the ice cream vendor. While some of his scenes were dragged down by unsteady pacing, overall a great aura was created through cinematography, acting, and script.

But cue the Italian gangsters and suddenly it's as if I'm watching two movies at the same time.

I realize they were purposely designed to be parodies of themselves, but it doesn't work here. Save it for Naked Gun 19 1/2 or whatever. All the tension and mystique built up by Ghost Dog is wiped out by the cartoonish ineptitude of these gangsters.

Ghost Dog needed a worthy adversary, and not for one moment did I believe any of them (or all of them lined up for the picking in a scene right out of a video game) threatened this highly trained assassin in any way.

The action sequences had no tension as a result - Ghost Dog was always in control.

The core of the film and its wonderful premise do work great, though, and it is redeemed in the end. If Jarmausch ever wants to make a sequel featuring the girl. at least most of the mafia guys are gone, so he can't go back to that bag.",1143676800,2,1450,4.452830188679245

Like Tom Waitts' gravely voice that should have made him a failure rather than a succes as performer and song writer (often writing for Jarmusch's films) this movie is logical in a progression of Jarmusch's films.

Beginning with casting Forest Whitaker as the inner city Samurai, , who doesn't exactly sport a Bruce Lee physique, OBVIOUSLY this movie was never meant to be taken literally! In fact, Jarmusch may be the ONLY director who dares, and can pull off, a film that mixes hip-hop street culture with Mafioso wise guys, sprinkle it with quotes from The Book of the Samurai by Hagakure and not just ""get away with it"" but make it all work!

If you like Jim Jarmusch films then you'll love GHOST DOG. If you've never seen one of his flicks then go easy on yourself ... and take a peek at his 1991 film, NIGHT ON EARTH. If nothing else, you'll have a chance to see Winona Ryder in a wonderful acting role before she became, err, Winona Ryder. And let's not forget the other greats such as Gena Rowlands, Batrice Dalle, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and that terrific MOUTH (and body) Rosie Perez who made NIGHT ON EARTH what it is. How can you resist?

In GHOST DOG, Whittaker is a gentle pigeon raising philosopher who is repected and feared in his 'hood. By night, he does ""special"" hits for the Mafia because as any good Samurai, he is loyal to one of the aging lieutenants who saved his life when Whittaker was a youth. The man he does contracts for is more like a character out of the ANALYZE THIS! than from the GODFATHER The wise guys in GHOST DOG are a bunch of ignorant bumblers (one of them played by Victor Argo, a great character actor) who can occasionally become very dangerous. Mixed in with this stew is a little black girl who Whittaker befiends because the two of them share a love of books.

Whittaker character's best friend is an ice cream vendor who doesn't speak a word of English, having just recently arrived from Ivory Coast in Africa. Some of the best dialogue is between these two who are so intuitively tuned to one another that although their words don't ever match up in their bilingual ""conversations"" they can exactly guess what the other one means.

Anyhow, this end-of-the-millennium film spiritually spans centuries while its post modern style was just born yesterday. See it!",1138060800,3,2449,4.6336405529953915

Were Jarmusch ever to do a ""Director's Cut,"" (although I doubt the studio had much say in a film this idiosyncratic) one hopes that he may cut a few of these, although they do serve to transition between scenes.

Aside from this minor quibble, it's one of the best films of the 90's; all of the other reviews on here are spot-on ('it's a spaghetti western,' 'it's like a long poem'). Jarmusch uses classic cartoons to foretell sequences, which he does in other films, but never as whimsically and appropriately as he does here.

It has the slow, mellow, easy pacing interrupted by moments of intense violence, the intriguing but elusive characters who follow their own mysterious moral code even to their death if necessary.  It is funny, and even hilarious at times; it is political insofar as it plays with and criticizes racial and ethnic stereotyping; it has one of the best soundtracks of any films (done by the RZA of Wu Tang Clan fame); scenes are joined together by intertitles containing intriguing passages from the Hagakure: the Book of the Samurai, read smoothly by the Ghost Dog himself; it raises existential questions of how to live appropriately in the face of death and the collapse of the forms that give meaning to our lives; and, best of all, it stars Forrest Whittaker in the role he was born to play!  That alone makes this a dvd worth owning at almost any price; and at this price I can't see how anyone who loves film does not own a copy.

On a personal note: when I took one of my classes (on American Independent Film) to the Sundance film festival a few years ago, someone asked me whether I hoped to see any stars.  I hadn't really thought about it because I'm not that starstruck, I just like movies.  But then it came to me: the whole trip would be worth it if I could meet Forrest Whittaker.  And I did!

Forest Whitaker plays Ghost Dog, a black hit man who works for a small time mobster named Louie in New Jersey (although New Jersey is never named, you can just tell it is Jersey).  Louie and his aging mobster pals strut around like old roosters in the barnyard.  Ghost Dog could have been called ""Ghost Bird"" because of his affinity for feathered creatures.  His only friends are his tame pigeons, an ice cream man who only speaks French (yet the two understand each other perfectly), and later in the film, a little girl who carries her books in a lunchbox.

The film is two hours, and moves at a SLOW pace.  Despite the theme of ""samurai,"" there is no fast-paced martial arts or sword-wielding.  Ghost Dog uses his guns in place of swords.  Ghost Dog never moves past ""amble"" mode throughout the film.  But the screenplay is so good it is worth sitting through it.  The scenes of the lonely Jersey streets at night and the voiceovers (with print) of genuine Zen quotes from an ancient samurai master really touch a part of your soul you have long forgotten or didn't know existed.

The movie was made in the year of 1999. It is rated R for strong language and action scenes. Ghost Dog was produced by Richard Guay and directed by Jim Jarmusch. The genre of the movie is Action-Drama.  Composer of the music is The RZA.  The characters are Forest Whitaker as Ghost Dog, John Tormey as Louie, and Henry Silva as Ray Vargo.  I, Adrian Valles, am the reviewer. I watched the movie on May 10,2005. It was on DVD at my house I watched it.

Summary: A hit man (Whitaker), known as Ghost Dog, must defend for his life after his boss (Tormey) turns on him.  Ghost Dog lives in the forgotten way of the Samurai.  One rule that Ghost Dog must never forget is a retainer can never kill his master, even if his master betrays the retainer!

I give the movie an eight, from a scale from one to ten.  It is because; the action could have been better.

Movies I have seen similar to Ghost Dog are, The Big Hit, Assassins, and Desperado, because the main characters killed evil people and were betrayed by their superiors",1116374400,2,1053,4.326530612244898

It is all about being cool and free.

Although the title seems ominous of a darker action waiting to break out, theatrically it tends to impress more than when the fake squibs and dust start puffing out of ancient actor's jacket padding, and to this I say, go see a John Woo movie instead if you want more from that, there is a message in the way, that is very fundamental - `There is something to be learned from a rainstorm. When meeting with a sudden shower, you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road. By doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses, you still get wet. When you are resolved from the beginning, you will not be perplexed, though you will still get the same soaking. This understanding extends to all things.' - If you are going to get wet, get wet. So imagine this in the mind of an assassin.

There are many intimate moments between English-less ice-cream salesmen, little girls who can talk to strangers who won't abuse them, mafia hit-men who are so outside of the scene that even their landlord kick's them around - corky throughout, probably in order not to take itself too seriously, ends up doing just that, the director likes comedy elements in his films, here the comic interludes suite the style, but you just wonder how much darker ""Ghost Dog"" could have been, none-the-less we are blubbering, because it is very dark at times, and for of course for what happens to be one of the best natural characters visualized for the silver screen since Ash in ""Evil Dead II"", ""Ghost Dog"" is great in anyone's collection.",1111968000,3,2496,4.681093394077449

We are told that some time later the young black man comes to Louie and declares himself to be in debt; calling himself Ghost Dog, he becomes a contract killer for Louie, although he calls himself a loyal retainer. Ghost Dog follows the way of the samurai, which is laid out in the book ""Hagakure: The Way of the Samurai."" But where the book enters the picture is unclear. If he was reading it before the assault then he should have been able to disptach those two guys; he certainly does well against everybody else in this film. But perhaps it was afterwards.

 The key thing to understand is that Ghost Dog is a Don Quixote figure, both in terms of following a creed long forgotten by the world in which he lives but also because he is certifiably crazy. Ghost Dog is living by a rules that Louie does not even know about, let along understand. Yet this does not bother Ghost Dog any more than the fact that he only speaks English and his best friend, Haitian ice cream vendor Raymond (Isaach De Bankol) only speaks French. The major conceit of this film are the quotation from ""Hagakure"" recited by Ghost Dog (e.g., ""Even if one's head were to be suddenly cut off, he should be able to do one more action with certainty""), which present the philosophy of the Samurai and serve to explain his motivations.

 The problem comes when Ghost Dog does a successful hit on a mobster only to discover that Louise Vargo (Tricia Vessey), daughter of the big boss, Ray Vargo (Henry Siliva), is on the scene. She was not supposed to be there, but she was. Ghost Dog has no instructions about killing anybody else and Louise is reading ""Rashomon,"" so he leaves her alone (but borrows the book). However, despite the fact he is a successful contract killer, Vargo wants Ghost Dog killed. In one of the most surreal exposition scenes of all-time, Louie has to explain to Vargo, underboss Sonny Valerio (Cliff Gorman) and a senile Old Consigliere (Gene Ruffini) that he contacts Ghost Dog by carrier pigeon, trying to explain to the old school mafiaoses the bizarre relationship.

 For Vargo it comes down to Ghost Dog or Louie, and since Ghost Dog has objections to it being either himself or his ""master,"" he takes matters into his own hands. This guy might practice with a sword, but he is pretty good with a gun as well. Meanwhile, Ghost Dog has befriended a young girl, Pearline (Camille Winbush), trying to pass on something of the life he has lived and what he believes. There might be some message here about two outdated modes of thinking, that of the Samurai verus that of the Mafia, but ultimately this film is about Whitaker's character and his performance. Whatever problems there are with the storyline or the clash of disparate elements in the film are forgiven by what Whitaker does as he goes back and forth between living a life of meditation and being an efficient killing machine. Jarmusch wrote the script and directed this film, but ""Ghost Dog"" is Whitaker's film.",1091577600,36,3914,4.573466476462197
1097130,4,6305958181,"Most reviewers have already covered the basics of this film. There is just one observation I would like to add.

 This film is very Japanese, so if you watch it with an American viewpoint you will probably dislike it. Most Japanese love a *Tragic Ending* just the same as most Americans love the *Happy Ending.*

 In Japanese culture, there are many examples of this type of epic story. In most of these stories either the hero is killed after he completes his task, or the task turns out to be impossible.

 Also in Japanese films, most of the time there is *betrayal* in the final scene as the final battle is more often then not between two *friends* rather then two *enemies.*

 We Americans are not often exposed to *tragedy* endings in action films. Usually our action movies end up with a show-down of the bad guy that we already had spent 2 hours learning to hate. We see our hero kill him and we feel better (Classic *happy ending*).

 Japanese movies usually have us either liking the *bad guy* or at least seeing why the *bad guy* is doing what he does. They always try to blur the line between right and wrong. Then the resolution is something like the *hero* and the *bad guy* killing each other. Very sad ending is common.

 Japanese movies also have a tendency to have very serious storylines, and then for humor they throw in the most slap-stick / silliest things that they can. An example of this in Ghost Dog is when we have two mafia hit men discussing what to do about this assassin that killed someone and then all of the sudden they have to catch a pidgin that flew into the room.

 --

 What does all this sum up to? That Ghost Dog is a Japanese movie. It is a tragedy with the occasional very out of place slap-stick comic element. So when you watch the movie, if you watch it from that viewpoint you will be able to see what the director is trying to do and you can adjust your viewpoint so that the movie makes more sense.",1091059200,4,1948,4.354570637119114
1097131,4,6305958181,"Forrest Whittaker is certainly one of our most talented and underrated actors.  This role probably allows him the greatest latitude to express a wide range of emotions since he starred as Charlie Parker in Clint Eastwood's ""Bird"" or in the gender-bender ""The Crying Game.""  As Ghost Dog, he winds his way through Jim Jarmusch's script with grace & depth.
In adopting the way of the Samurai, GDog latches onto Louie, a mid-level mob boss played by John Tormey.  The mix of cultures is a familiar Jarmusch theme that is exceptionally well realized in this DVD.  One of the most interesting aspects of the film is GDog's relationship to his French-speaking best friend Raymond.  The two often converse, not understanding each other's language but almost mirroring each other's thoughts as the subtitled French indicates.  Isaach de Bankole does a great job as the ice cream truck-driving friend.  Also very pivotal to the film is the wonderful screen time given to Camille Winbush as Pearline, a child who GDog loans a copy of Rashamon to.  There is a great rapport between the two.
The Italian crime bosses are ironically played for laughs with Cliff Gorman's inept mob boss front & center.  As Vargo, Henry Silva who has such a great ethnic look and has played in ""Dick Tracy"" & ""Oceans 11"" does a great job of being hard-edged and incompetent.  His daughter Louise is a witness to one of GDog's early executions and eventually orders Louie to perform the hit on our star.
With the aspects of carrier pigeons and a guy building an arc on a city rooftop, we see numerous interesting cultural aspects and humor combined in the drama.  This is an interesting film melding Asian culture with modern crime, kind of a Hip-Hop version of Kung Fu.  Whittaker keeps us glued to the screen for a most interesting performance.  Enjoy!",1087344000,,1822,4.819935691318328
1097132,3,6305958181,"I liked this movie for the most part but it was the ending that put me off. I really did not want to see Ghost Dog die in that way, at the hands of a white man who did not understand him or his philosophy. I wish that Forrest Whitaker's character could have shown more determination to fight and survive, with more of what the samurai author of Hagakure would have called ""martial valor"". But then isn't it the juxtaposition of the cold, efficient samurai code with this gentle, somewhat bemused giant part of what makes the film interesting? Come to think of it, the samurai were more concerned with an honourable death than  with mere survival. A better ending, at least for me, would have had Ghost Dog choosing, at the very last moment, to survive rather than follow the samurai code into the grave.",1082073600,3,803,4.5
1097133,5,6305958181,"This was another gem from the director Jim Jarmusch, who previously brought us the incredibly underrated zen spaghetti western Dead Man.  Which mixes some of the same elements, taking several genres, and blending them together in a believable and respectful way.
Forest Whitaker is playing the main character.  A street punk who follows a bushido code and considers himself a modern day samurai.  He lives his life by this strict code of honor, and has pledged his life to a mobster who saved him.  So he works for this gangster as a contract killer.  Never questioning the reasons for his killings, just like a samurai, there is no good and evil.  You follow your the will of your master to the death.  Through all this you definitely get the feeling that he is alone in this world of his, duty is what concernes him.  His only friend is an ice cream vendor that doesn't speak english, just french, which Forest Whittaker's character doesn't.
The second part of this film is the Mafia themself.  A comical group of broken down gangsters who are starting to show their age.  They are having trouble making their bills, and are suffering from internal conflicts.  Obviously their glory days are long gone, and they seem to be waiting for the inevitable.
This movie blends to the two genres well, making them both entertaining and believable for the premise.  As we all know the Mafia lost most of it power through the late 70' to the mid 90's.  They show this with the age of the mobsters and the fact that they can't even make their bills.  The Bushido code wasn't practiced on a grand scale since World War 2 with the Japanese, when they lost the war, a lot of that part of their culture started to dissappear from their lives.  So you have two groups that were once held a great deal of power and respect, but now are a shadow of themeselves, being slowly forgotten.
He also manages to make this as surreal as his previous pictures.  Not like the sledgehammer to head stylings of Greg Arraki, or force fed surrealism of David Lynch, but more subtle.  Lots of people watch cartoons, there are silent interludes where ambiant soundtracks play and you just feel the intensity of the main character, the world has a subdued and detached feel to it, like you are looking from the outside in, the philosophies still hold relavence today despite their age,......
All in all it is a very good movie. Be warned it isn't an action movie, dont' expect any John Woo style gun fights or sword wielding killers, that isn't what this is about.  It is something deeper and more introspective.",1080518400,6,2578,4.628571428571429

One negative thing about this movie is that the so called Mob is very silly, and not like the real gangsters that controlls the streets.

If u are a hiphop-fan this is a very special treat, the music is composed by Wu-Tang member RZA (who also composed Tarantino's Kill Bill) and RZA does some of his best works in this movie.
If you are looking for straight action a'la Ninja stuff u might wanna go see KILL BILL instead, becouse this is a more realistic movie which could happen in real life, and it's more of drama flick than action.
The movie is about this hitman called Ghost Dog who's only friend (besides his birds) is a french guy who doesn't speak any english and Ghost doesn't speak any french neither but they get along fine even though they don't understand each-others words they still think alike...

1097209,5,6305958181,"After seeing all of Jim Jarmusch's films, I have to admit not a single one of them is easy to watch.  All of them are boring and slow, but I love them anyway.  Unlike all his earlier work, Ghost Dog is easily accessible yet still definitely a ""Jim"" movie.

The subtle beauty of this movie is quickly realized within the first few minutes of the film.  The start of this film is much like his earlier works, usually showing a run down part of a town with music playing overtop.  They seem to be the only shots he uses that have panning and movement with the camera.  After knowing his work, you realize this is because he hates showing the audience what to look at.  It is just one of the few things Jarmusch does that makes him the best.  But, back to the music.  Of all the soundtracks that he has had in the past 20 years, I must admit this one is the best.  He allows RZA (from Wu Tang Clan fame) to add music that enhances every scene, which is different from what he normally does.  These tracks are all awesome, varying from an outright Gangsta Rap song to the weirdest jazz ever created.

The rest of the movie is beautiful in every way.  Jarmusch once again uses poetry to create visuals that go along with his beautiful dialogue.  This movie probably has the most dialogue of any of his movies, yet it still isn't much.  There are things that take getting used to and seem like they are not important to the plot, but for some reason they are just really great scenes. A good example of this is the scene when Ghost Dog and his Haitian friend (who knows why Jarmusch made him not be able to communicate with his best friend?) are watching a man build a boat in an alley for no apparent reason.  There seems to be no logic to this scene, yet it has a certain charm that just adds character to all his films.

This, like a lot of Jarmusch movies, creates a movie that brings together many different aspects never put together before.  In this, he combines Eastern Philosphy, The Dying Mob Scene, and the Hip Hop generation all into one story.  That is something no director could pull off in a two hour movie.

As for the rest of this movie, I can't say enough.  With things like mobsters watching old (and a few Itchy & Scratchy) cartoons that seem to be foreshadowing, how can you go wrong?  Plus, the addition of carrier pigeons as communication, GENIUS!  You must understand that this movie is probabaly his funniest yet (tied with Dead Man) with the addition of Rapping Mob bosses and overall beautiful acting.  Robbie Muller once again proves why he's the best filmographer in the business, Forest Whitaker finally gets a role that he deserves, and Jim Jarmusch strengthens his greatness with another masterpiece to add to his library.",1064361600,54,2748,4.439121756487026

Yet the film is never heavy. Indeed it is a comic masterpiece with every actor playing with dead on accuracy.

The movie describes how a very alone (but probably not lonely) man practices years of loyalty to a criminal who saved his life as a teenager.  He finds moral authority, and therefore meaning for his life, from a book of samurai code that he reads and reflects on throughout the film.  The movie follows a couple weeks in Ghost Dog's life when we see him make several choices about his power to kill or nurture others who live outside the code, to evade or adhere to the code.  I think the movie asks the viewer to wonder about the meaning of life or the moral codes of those who kill other people today.  What are the rules they live by?  What would they say is their authority for choosing who lives and dies?
We might think of moral codes as good, but this movie shows that orthodox practice of a moral code can require the practitioner to destroy himself.

1. The DVD:
Good movie transfer and sound.  Unfortunately the extras are disappointing - just one tier up from having no extras at all.  A little bit of trivia is gleaned from the 30-minute 'in-depth study' feature; the feature is simply an interview with Jim Jarmusch, Forest Whitaker, and the RZA, along with screamingly bad editing and annoying camera angles.  Not on a level with the 30-minute 'What is Brazil' which should be a model to all DVD producers.  There is also an 'isolated music score' which is interesting if you're into how the music integrates with the film.  Apart from that the extras are duds, only 1 deleted scene, no audio commentary, etc.  But the movie is a classic, so the DVD is a must-have in my opinion.
2. The movie:
A powerful tale of a man (Forest Whitaker) living the Samurai code in a modern ""nameless"" city.  A man who belongs to another time (or does he?).  A sort of contrast between two ancient tribes, two codes - the italian mafioso code, and the way of the samurai.  The film has been described as a fusion between many genres - samurai, urban hip-hop, gangster, and western.  This is quite a challenge, and works for most of the film (although the humor and slapstick of the gangster characters goes a little far and doesn't integrate well with the other parts of the movie).  I like the fact that Jarmusch didn't cast the 'usual suspects' for his gangster characters, but instead made an effort to use stage actors, actors that haven't been seen widely in these kinds of roles, etc.
In the end, this is one of those movies that I find myself thinking about long after having seen it.  Not only that, it has inspired me to read Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai, and Roshoman.  Jarmusch has outdone himself.  Among his work I would rate this second only to Dead Man.",1049587200,3,1838,4.564024390243903

Here is a man who has disciplined himself to the lonely existence of a near Ronin Samurai who's only friend speaks no English, yet they seem to understand and even parrot each other.  Also, some of the hit scenes at the end were just marvelous in their clevernous.  I for one loved this movie for both the theme and Forest Whitaker's acting.

If you try to comfortably sit it in a box; action, comedy, drama, gangster flick, philosphical discourse, you will immediately have problems with this film. It is all of these, and none of these. It also defys some logic. It's a brilliant movie, but since it has a hard time being categorized, you'll probably see mainstream moviegoers, or people with an inability to think or view things abstractly or on different levels not liking it. It's a gutsy move, and one that is terribly lacking in an industry that usually rehashes old formulas.
Most pressing is the assassin's relationships with his mafioso boss (retainer) and also with his best friend. Interestingly enough, Whittaker and his best friend/ice cream man, never actually understand each other through the entire film. On the other hand, they understand each other perfectly.
I've also read the actual book, Hagakure. Quite honestly, it's as weird an eclectic mix as the movie is. On the outside it really is an odd book of philosophy. Ancient Japan, viewed from a western eye, was a strange, odd, mishmash of contradiction, honor, respect and seemingly lots of unnecessary sacrifice and killing, and although the movie alters a bit on certain aspects of the book, it does capture the essence of it overall.",1045353600,8,1328,4.959641255605381

This is a great movie - not great in the sense that it has a feel good happy ending or that it ends how you might want it to end. It's great in a way that makes you think about life and loyalty, about how two different cultures collide and what honor is and how it might lead to your undoing.
Forest Whitaker (a marvelous actor) is Ghost Dog, a samurai who has sworn his loyalty to a Mafia gangeter who once saved his life. Ghost Dog becomes a hitman for the Mafia, used when it's considered too dangerous for somebody else to do. He does his job well. but it confuses the Mafia simply because they don't understand his culture. Ghost Dog settles up his account with his boss once a year, he uses carrier pigeons to relay messages and lives simply - something the gangsters don't understand.
He reads from the ""Hagakure"" everyday, ontemplating the meaning of the way of life he has chosen. The gangsters are one messed up bunch - dysfunctional doesn't even begin to describe them - and thier idea of culture seems to be old cartoons on tv. (Although the one doing the rap song is hilarious.)
A hit goes wrong - well, actually it goes right but it's a political disaster for the gangsters. It is determined Ghost Dog must die. But how do you kill a samurai - especially one that seems to materialize from nowhere, hos no known address or phone number?
The rest of the movie concerns itself with that matter, as well as Ghost Dog's friendship with a Haitian ice cream vendor - though they don't speak each other's languages, hey seem to understand each other almost instinctively. And Ghost Dog befriends a young girl. These relationships help you understand more about Ghost Dog.
I won't give away the ending - the movie is very powerful and really must be seen to be appreciated. But it will leave you thinking about many, many things long after the movie is over and to me, that's a mark of a great movie.
It's not a movie for everybody - it's not a John Woo movie or Jackie Chan - those are both good, but this is a much different, darker type of movie. If you want to think as well as be entertained, this is the movie for you.",1041033600,7,2290,4.352803738317757
1097406,5,6305958181,"A fantastic movie that won't appeal to everyone. It is more of an art movie than action thriller. It warrants repeated viewings, not because events are easily missed, but some are not deeply appreciated with only one viewing.
The gangsters are a riot, as is the French ice cream man. The dialogs between Ghost Dog and the ice cream man are fascinating and, when you think about it, not that different to the disinterested dialogue fellow English speakers might engage in. In fact the understanding may be greater.
For me it was the soundtrack that stood out. I am not a huge fan of Rap, I like it but don't listen a lot. I found the glimpse into the roots of the rap culture fascinating, and they seemed more real than any other movie I have come across. (spike lee etc). Along with an interview I read recently with Matthew Johnson it is easy to see rap as the true successor to blues. And who could forget the rendition of Flavour Flav by an aging Italian Gangster.
I cannot recommend this film to everyone, but if you love movies that reward careful attention then you will really enjoy this - as I did. Four and a half stars.",1040601600,4,1129,4.4326923076923075

living life in a disciplined way
living according to one's own code

There were a couple of minutes during the start of the film when Ghost Dog is driving through the city where I got a bit restless, but this is the extent of my complaints.

1097410,5,6305958181,"Before anything else, I have to say that Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai is definitely a love it or hate it movie. As for myself, I absolutely loved it.
Why did I love it? Well it is one thing for a movie or story to be entertaining. Schwarzenegger and Stallone entertain. But for any story, whether it be a book, movie, or what have you stand out and be truly good, (at least in my humble opinion), it must do at least one of three things; move you, make you think, or be deep enough that you find new things every time you see it. Ghost Dog does all three for me.
As for the plot, you can read about it elsewhere, and it is not the main strength of the movie, so I will summarize it quickly. Ghost Dog is a hitman who religiously follows the code of Samurai. Ghost Dog is the retainer, or follower of a Mafia capo named Louie, who saved his life years earlier. Ghost Dog has performed a number of perfect hits for Louie and his crime family, but when the latest one goes awry, he finds himself at odds with the crime family, who are now trying to find and kill the mysterious warrior.
As I mentioned, it is not the plot that is the strength of the movie, but rather the characters. Jarsmuch's writing and vision, (and Forrest Whitaker's superb performance), help create an unforgettable character and do something rarely accomplished in film which is bring true humanity to a very odd, and at times, violent man. Furthermore, this is done with a rare appreciation of subtlety and minimalism, quite rare in this day when films, books and movies prefer to hit their audiences over the head with a sledgehammer as opposed to challenging them and take the dreaded risk that they might not get it.
As for making you think, Ghost Dog is very much a story of ideas and layers that take time, (and repeated, careful viewing) to fully come to light. For example, besides the obvious revenge plot of the movie, just a few of the other themes that are explored include; the study of a man who is a killer and yet is also a person we like and respect. A look at cultures and men on the edge of extinction. The bonds of friendship, and loyalty. The meaning of honor. What it means to devote one's life and purpose to a code of behavior. The clash of ancient ways versus modern ones. A look at a profoundly world weary man. The slow death of old cultures and myths in modern America. Reality vs. artificiality. Loneliness and reaching out to others. Looking at violence as both poetic (Ghost Dog's practicing martial arts and his battle against the gangsters in Ray Vargo's house), and cold-hearted and brutal, (the Mafia's violence on innocents, Ghost Dog's assassinations). The interaction between different generations, moralities, and codes of conduct. And this is just what I can come up with off the top of my head!
Secondly, Ghost Dog is also a film of tragedy; an art too often eschewed these days for the proverbial happy ending. The tragedies too happen on many levels and come from many angles, even some from the ""bad guys!"" First off, Ghost dog himself is obviously a tragic figure, both in the fact that he is man following a way of life that effectively ended centuries ago and then there is his fate, which I will not spoil. There is the tragedy of Ghost Dog devoting his life to Louie, an obviously lesser man. There is the spark of nobility we see in Ray Vargo, who knows that Ghost Dog is coming to kill him, and yet meats this with a calm stoicism to match Ghost Dog's.
And yet, for all that the film gives us, it also holds key things back, leaving us with unsolvable mysterious that make us wonder and keep guessing long after we first see it. For example, what caused Ghost Dog, an obviously gentle man, to take up the code of the samurai and become a remorseless killer? Who was Ghost Dog before these events? And then there are the things that can be interpreted endlessly, like the use of the cartoons, Rashoman, certain symbolism, etc.
And while I have to apologize for the length of this (although this is one of my favorite movies, I didn't mean to go on THIS long!), I have one last thing to say, and this is aimed at the people who claimed that the movie makes no sense or isn't realistic enough. It's not meant to be. The movie is a surreal look at things, and an allegory. It's not strictly based in reality. It's a case where the message or ideas the writer is trying to convey is more important than basing all the minutia of the story completely in the real world. In other words, don't take it too literally. Instead, sit back, keep an open mind, and maybe you'll enjoy a great movie experience.",1027987200,3,4622,4.4196951934349356
1097411,5,6305958181,"Jim Jarmusch doesn't do films like anyone else and let's all say a big 'thank-you' for that. With 'Ghost Dog', he demonstrates an understanding of Japanese culture and film traditions than far exceeds the likes of Tarantino, and at the same a connection to contemporary hip-hop, the likes of which hasn't been seen in celluloid since 'Do the Right Thing'.
The film centres around the eponymous hero, a black hitman, or 'retainer' as he puts it, for a local mafia clan, who follows the Samurai code, meditating and practising his swordplay in his modest rooftop hut which he shares only with his pigeons. In this role, Forest Whitaker puts in an outstanding performance full of understated power and pathos, at once bulky and balletic, that emphasises how criminally neglected he is, and indeed black actors are more generally (Washington and Berry's Oscars notwithstanding), by Hollywood.
Ghost Dog is estranged from the city as he struggles to follow his archaic code of honour, his only human connections made to a Haitian ice-cream vendor who speaks only French, and a little girl who loves reading. They aren't the only ones: coping with the absurdity of the uncaring city, its bleakness, poverty, lonelines and racism is a key theme in 'Ghost Dog'; those who survive need something to connect them to the real and to the transcendent: at one point, Ghost Dog and his Haitian friend come across a Hispanic man building a full-sized boat on a nearby roof-top, a labour of love that has no practical use.
The film is infused with genuine but very edgy humour: Ghost Dog's almost empathic understanding with the ice-cream vendor somehow transcends their mutual linguisitc imcomprehension is joyous and affecting. There are some genuine moments of slapstick and absurdity from the outdated, incompetant and decidely dishonourable mafia men who give Ghost Dog his orders and eventually decide to have him eliminated, in particular their leader's bizarre love of Public Enemy's Flavor Flav, and their inability to cope with Ghost Dog's carrier pigeons.
The sound-track by the Wu-Tang Clan's RZA is a far more complex jazz-inflected hip-hop confection than you might have hoped for, meshing perfectly with the moodily-filmed cityscpes, and he also makes a very brief - but perfectly judged - cameo appearance!
Occasionally you stumble across a film that turns out to be an unexpected delight. 'Ghost Dog' is one of them.",1027123200,4,2417,5.090680100755668
1097412,2,6305958181,"Anyone who cares about the way movies are made, what it takes to make the magic happen, has to admire writer/director Jim Jarmusch.  A pioneer and one of the driving forces within the new wave of independent filmmakers since the early `80s, he's an artist who is not afraid to take a chance and is constantly exploring new terrain.  When it comes to the arts, however, that adventurous spirit can also be a double-edged sword, and as another great artist, writer Ray Bradbury, will tell you, not every idea works; occasionally, what is created in the mind simply does not translate to the written page, nor to film, and for any number of reasons.  Which is seemingly the case with ""Ghost Dog:  The Way of the Samurai,"" written and directed by Jarmusch, the premise of which is powerful and engaging, but which simply does not materialize on the screen.
Ghost Dog (Forest Whitaker) is a hit man for the mob, loyal to and working directly for a man named Louie (John Tormey), who had befriended him some years earlier at a critical juncture in Ghost Dog's life.  Now, however, circumstances have changed, and the mob bosses want Ghost Dog removed.  Permanently.  They are about to discover, though, that getting rid of Ghost Dog will be no easy task, as he lives a reclusive existence and follows the code of the ancient Samurai warriors.  And one of the tenets of that code prescribes viewing life as a dream, which is exactly the way Ghost Dog lives his life.  And this is ""his"" dream; and to effect their goal, the mob will have to negotiate Ghost Dog's terrain on his terms.  He may be only one man, but as they are about to learn, this one man is a formidable opponent.
Jarmusch has crafted and delivered a film that is part philosophical character study, part action/drama, that comes across much as if Ingmar Bergman had directed ""Goodfellas.""  And actually, the philosophical ruminations and Ghost Dog's meditations work fairly well, presented as they are in ethereal terms that tend to be wistful and transporting in themselves.  In retrospect, what really does in Jarmusch and his efforts here is very simply a case of-- except for Whitaker-- extraordinarily bad acting.  The members of his ""mob"" are incredibly ineffective and unconvincing; what Jarmusch badly needed was a Pesci, a Joe Viterelli or even a Mike Starr to give some substance to his gang.  Unfortunately, he was stuck with the ""B"" team, and not even the brief presence of Henry Silva (as Ray Vargo) is enough to salvage much good from the results.  And it's a shame, because Jarmusch does have his moments here, and there is a powerful film hidden within, desperately attempting to break through.  But in the end, it never does, and the promise Jarmusch tenders remains uncharacteristically unfulfilled.
The saving grace of the project is the performance by Forest Whitaker, who successfully immerses himself in the role of Ghost Dog and creates a believable, convincing character.  With an introspective approach, he credibly attains that level of detachment that defines the code by which Ghost Dog lives, that sense of living life as if it's a dream, which ultimately enables him to play it all out as a character of his own design and within the parameters of his own reality, which is far removed from that of the rest of the world and those who dwell within it.  Purely as a character study, in fact, this film is riveting at times, and can be thoroughly intriguing.  And for that, Jarmusch, of course, deserves credit; it's Whitaker's work, however, that brings it to fruition.
The only other performance of note is turned in by Isaach De Bankole as Ghost Dog's friend, Raymond.  The fact that Raymond speaks and understands only French makes for some of the most engaging moments in the film, in fact, since Ghost Dog neither speaks nor understands French, but only English.  It's a novel touch that is so Jarmusch; and it's an indication of what this film could have been had Jarmusch moved more in that direction rather than toward the more questionable path upon which he ended up.
The supporting cast includes Camille Winbush (Pearline), Cliff Gorman (Sonny), Frank Minucci (Big Angie), Richard Portnow (Handsome Frank) and Tricia Vessey (Louise).  In any given medium, the true artist dances to his own drum, and that defines Jim Jarmusch.  Independent film, especially, and the cinema in general, owes a debt of gratitude to his inventiveness and creative vision, to that kind of spirit of which he is imbued, that has taken film to a higher level.  ""Ghost Dog:  Way of the Samurai"" may not be his most memorable film, and is far from his greatest accomplishment, but it does demonstrate that Jim Jarmusch is alive and well as he continues to seek out new cinematic territory.  And even in this film there can be found a magic that is all it's own; and in the final analysis, it's all a part of what makes up the magic of the movies.",1025395200,6,4921,4.76

Both have their own philosophies and codes of conduct and both are ruthless. Ghost Dog, however,maintains and retains his dignity throughout, whereas the others do not.
The scene which I felt was most telling, was the man who was building a boat in the middle of the city on top of a skyscraper. I think it was a metaphor for Ghost Dog. Ghost Dog is a sympathetic character. One almost feels'The Stockholm Syndrome'taking over while you watch the film, this man is after all, an assassin. The sound track throughout adds another dimension and gives you a clue to who Ghost Dog really is. I love this film. It took me ages to find this film on DVD in the UK.

1097461,4,6305958181,"How can an action film be slow, yet still be immensely enjoyable? By being hypnotic and visually beautiful, at least according to the rules of the eccentric filmmaking world of director Jim Jarmusch. This is a world of contradictions and ironies where a black man can be a hit man for a seedy Mafioso gang by convincing himself that he is a samurai warrior. While this setup allows for a great deal of incisive dark humor, it also creates a sense of profound sadness. At some points, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
Ghost Dog is played by Forest Whitaker. I have been a fan of his since ""The Crying Game"", and I think this is his finest performance to date. He creates an indelible character. What makes this all the more remarkable is that, except for the passages he recites from a samurai handbook, he has very little dialog. He conveys nearly everything through his body language.
When his life is saved by an old Mafia guy, Ghost Dog decides the man is his samurai master. That's why he volunteers to be a hit man. When a hit goes wrong, the local Don decides that Ghost Dog must die. This proves to be far easier said than done. How do you even find a man who doesn't own a phone and communicates solely through carrier pigeons?
This is an unusual movie that I found to be fascinating. Though there may be some deep hidden meaning to its story, I saw it as a brilliant satire of the crime genre. What it lacks in adrenaline-producing action it makes up for in humor and intelligence.",1020038400,6,1496,4.423913043478261

1097463,4,6305958181,"There isn't much to add to the reviews already written for this movie, but I thought I'd throw my two cents in.  First, a comment about the ""Action"" in this movie.  It seems that a lot of people find this to be one of the weaker parts of the movie, as Jarmusch is not an action director by any means.  Personally, I found it to be excellent.  The actions scenes are usually simple, clean, and beautiful.  The deaths are quick and efficient, just like the way a Samurai kills.  They reminded me of the style of Japanese Samurai films.  No extended firefights or brawls, just a few quick slashes of the sword, or in this case, a few quick squeezes of the trigger, and the enemies fall.  Jarmusch is like a Samurai director.  The camera lingers on the seemingly inconsequential and minor details, like a Haiku.  The most telling moments are in the inbetween conversations between characters, the moments of comedy and relaxation.  Then there is a sharp moment of some critical event, an assasination or some such event, and then the haiku flows again.  A beautiful film, with more than its fair share of comedy and insight.",1018224000,,1120,4.601010101010101

Director Jim Jarmusch seems to be an acquired taste, and I guess I ain't acquired it. The movie is WAAAY too long, and the meager plot is padded mercilessly by rapping Mobsters, French-speaking Ice-Cream vendors, a cute kid, a shouting old man, clothing thefts, etc. The movie takes avant-garde to a whole new level, and while there were parts that I enjoyed, it was just a little too weird for me to recommend.",1018137600,5,658,4.576271186440678
1097465,4,6305958181,"Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai is a fascinating flick - an odd hybrid, two parts gangster epic, one part philosophical journey of self-discovery. Forrest Whitaker (Phenomenon, Good Morning Vietnam) is Ghost Dog, a loner, who considers himself a ""retainer"" (servant/protector) to a mobster named Lou (John Tormey) who once saved his life.
Ghost Dog is a seeker, studying the Hagakure (The Code of the Samurai). Throughout the film, he reads passages from the Hagakure that highlight his own personal code. Passages like, ""Each day a samurai should contemplate his own death and consider various ways of dying, from being torn apart in the jaws of a wild beast, to falling from thousand foot cliffs, and during some part of the day, the samurai should consider himself dead.""
Ghost Dog's ""best friend"" is a Haitian ice cream vendor (Isaac DeBankole), despite the fact that Whitaker's character understands no French and the ice cream vendor doesn't understand English. His only other real human contact is with a young girl, maybe 10 years old, named Pearline (Camille Winbush).
Lou contacts Ghost Dog via carrier pigeon and pays him for his contract killings once a year...Lou doesn't know anything else about his contract killer, not his given name, not even where he lives. This becomes the fulcrum for some very dark comedy.
When a hit goes awry and Lou's associates look to eliminate Ghost Dog, Lou's inability to provide details makes for some darkly comedic confrontations. Veteran screen villain Henry Silva is cold and bizarre as mob boss Ray Vargo, while Cliff Gorman (Sonny Valerio) provides a comic absurdity (a mafia hit man who's also a rap aficionado) rivaled only by the communication between Ghost Dog and the ice cream vendor that transcends language.
Much of the background score is provided by the Staten Island based rap group, Wu Tang Clan, which gives it a real gritty, streety feel. Much of the film moves at a crawl and you get the impression that Forrest Whitaker wanted to state something more, that just doesn't translate onto film.
The story is dark and in spots absurdly ridiculous (the mobsters all seem obsessed with old cartoons), but it doesn't glorify violence the way many gangster flicks do. Still, it leaves you looking for more.
I've thought about this and part of it may be that Ghost Dog seems to be a reluctant hero in much the same vein as Brandon Lee's The Crow or Sam Rami's Darkman, but seems to fall a little short, but that may be an illusion. Both Darkman and The Crow are offered up as supernatural creatures (The Crow returns from the dead for vengeance and Darkman is supposedly bestowed with an almost infinite pain threshold due to nerve damage), while Ghost Dog is a living, bleeding, loner, so he can't be compared to those kind of protagonists.
The ending of this film, like that of Shyamalan's Unbreakable will probably leave many westerners cold. Here it seems almost taboo when good fails to triumph outright over evil.
I liked this film, even though I felt it reached for more than it could deliver, just as I liked Unbreakable (that may give you a clue as to whether this is your kind of film), but I'd recommend it with four stars out of five. If it had delivered all that it reached for, it would've been a sure fire five!",1017878400,,3302,4.794736842105263

He seems to be a lonely gunman and a last descendant of Samurai. The book which Ghost Dog read and store, is a the way of the Samurai. This book is packed with spiritual world of the Samurai for serving master. He risks his life several times for master, but these stories do not look like a masculine or heroic scenes.
It shows delicate differences by using three times flash back. In these scenes, the gangsters the point of the gun are different, it explains that same situation can be accepted differently as peoples eyes or consciousness. So, Ghost Dog, he accept the master who is a worthless and altogether unspeakable villain, as a being that he should be loyal no matter how he risks his life. He has a master who saves him from gangsters of the town and is a one of Italian family gangsters who become an enemy of Ghost Dog and are all old, infirm with grizzled hair, and fat-bellied. They swollen with pride about that, but they did not pay the rent of their hideout so when owner came to see them, they always are busy to avoid his eyes.
In addition, they like to watch an animation and sing a rap with ill matched. These Gangsters do not look like a gangster, they are the third rate, and this is a paradoxical expression. Ghost Dog, who looks like an isolated island, has a friend who can speak only French. Nevertheless, the language has no problem between them. They can understand each other no matter how they speak different language. In addition, Ghost Dog and little girl read a book, which is a scripture of Japan. This film is a story of communication that jumps over the boundary.

It appeared interesting at the time but I didn't see this film until i rented it at the local library,remembering the trailer I witnessed at the movie theater.
  I didnt't know what to expect but I did notice immediately that the movie began rather slowly but featured very elegant and awesome camera work during the opening camera sequence. The story picks up after some time as I became aware of the protaganist,(who is played buy Forest Whitaker, giving a great performance), Ghost Dog- a pseudonym being dervied from his reputation as doing professional work,""like a ghost"", and ""untraceable"". Ghost Dog is a professional killer who lives by the code of the Samurai of Feudal Japan. Ghost Dog is a retainer to Louie, whom is a member of a dysfunctional mafia, and serves him as an assassin. Throughout the movie Ghost Dog shows Louie absoulte loalty, like a the Samurai showing the same towards his overlord.

It's the only way to kill or be killed, without bringing pain upon oneself.  I thought that Jarmusch missed the boat in terms of allowing this idea to prosper.  Even though he liberally quotes from the Hagakure (""The Book of the Samurai"") before every scene, most of the tenets it espouses appear to be mere fashion tips, i.e., how to look like a bad mutha when walking through the neighbourhood.  That being said, Jarmusch does succeed in allowing the Hagakure's ideas to prosper in the choice and direction of his lead actor
Forest Whitaker is successful in his portrayal of Ghost Dog.  He moves slowly.  His lazy left eye, usually a distraction, is used to great effect here, showing his relaxed, Zen nature.  And when practicing his sword work on the rooftops of New York, Whitaker, a beefy man, moves with the grace and agility of a cat.  My favourite part of his work, the physicality of which was stunning, was how he'd re-holster his guns: he'd swirl them around as if they were samurai swords looking for a sheath.
Except for some laid-back narration, the role is nearly silent.  Whitaker plays this silence well, allowing his expressions or his body language to tell a further story.  When he does interact with people, the results can be hit or miss, but it's always unusual.  His best friend, a Haitian ice cream man, speaks only French (usually through a megaphone).  But the two men appear able to communicate with each other perfectly, without even knowing that they are.  These scenes provide a light touch that became tiresome after awhile, but still provided the film with some fine comic moments.  Other scenes, involving a curious little girl, allow Whitaker to show Ghost Dog's tender side.  Their scenes together are touching.  It's a typical Beauty and the Beast scenario, where she is able to cut through his gruff veneer to the gentleness that lives beneath.  And Ghost Dog's moments with Louie, a mobster who once saved his life and who now employs him as a hit man (a relationship that sets up the movie's narrative thrust, if a movie like this can be said to have a narrative thrust), go well beyond the you-saved-me-so-now-I'm-in-your-debt cliches, to create something truly ridiculous.
Louie is a man of tremendous ennui, who can barely muster the energy to react to horrific situations anymore (it's actually funny to see how quickly he becomes resigned to his fate, when a hit goes wrong and his bosses want to take it out on him).  He can't be blamed, however, for the group of mobsters that he works for and with are a buffoonish bunch.  Their a very dim gang who can't shoot straight, fitting all the mob stereotypes of more serious movies (fat, Italian men, who favour fancy suits or track suits, gaudy glasses, lacquered hair, giant Cadillacs).  Only they hang around their social club/hideout watching cartoons all day (on a side note: watch how the actions in the cartoons always translate to action in real life for these men, as if they are taking advice on how to live from Merry Melodies!).  It felt like Jarmusch was trying to throw a little mob-as-morons parody into his samurai flick.  They provided comic relief (one high-ranking mobster confounds his colleagues and the audience by breaking into a Flavor Flav rap!), and only sporadically took away from the solemnity of the film's themes.
The film's score, provided by Wu Tang Clan's RZA, is probably it's most unique feature (or at least that's how it was hyped).  Comprised of laid back hip-hop beats, it was effective and understated in helping to establish moods (like a good score should).  And at times it gives the film, which had a tendency to meander off-track, a solid pocket of groove to jam over.
Some people thought this film was too long.  I didn't.  A character like this needs a certain languid pacing to come off properly.  He is thoughtful and unhurried, and the film should be as well.  Just don't expect the story to move forward with any urgency, and I assure you that ""Ghost Dog"" will be a rewarding, if at times bewildering, experience.",1009324800,,4625,4.765370138017566

The Italian characters were more detrimental than positive with their attempts at humor and bumbling incompetence. Also, the movie tries to take on too many roles at the same time--a black man who listens to hip-hop, reads a lot, studies the way of the Samurai, employed by the mafia, befriends a little girl and a French-speaking ice cream salesman, and lives on the roof of an apartment building beside a pigeon coop. A lot of potential but I think all those different elements pull the movie in too many directions at the same time.

  Set in New Jersey, a black man who lives as a 20th century samurai is called on by a gangster. Ultimately, something goes bad and the samurai-ish hitman becomes the target.
  Sounds pretty cheasy, but it's not. The gangsters are portrayed very accurately. No ponytail clad pretty boys with Armani suits and Uzis. No, it's actually more like the Sopranos in that regard.
  And the protagonist, this black ninja, isn't the guy you'd normally expect for the role. What you get is an overweight Forrest Whitacker(sp)who, albeit awkward looking, really fits the character he portrays and adds a bit more dignity to the film in doing so.

Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai sucessfully mixes Eastern philosophy and hip-hop culture, art, (some) comedy and action (although it wouldn't at all be fair to call this an action movie), and some good dialouge as well as excellent acting all around.

1097588,5,6305958181,"The Dean of Independent Cinema, Jim Jarmusch, has always given us shockingly realistic and terrific films, but Ghost Dog is, in my opinion, truly his best.
Forest Whitaker shines bright as the hitman Ghost Dog, a very noble and loyal man who lives his life by the code of the Samurai.  Even though he is a killer, he looks at life in a differant way.  Everything is meant to be in his life, which he seems to believe follows fate.  The various mobsters are hilarious sendups of the very serious characters that have been created in Scorcese films and the Sopranos.  Sonny Valerio, who loves the old school rapper Flava Flav is quite honestly one of the funniest characters in any film this year.
Jarmusch has always been big on style and intelligence, and this film does not lack in either of the categories.  His camera is graceful and deliberate and the pure genius that went into the script is incomperable.  Everything in this movie, from the action scenes to the various interludes involving making silencers and electronic equipment used to break into cars is very, very smart.  Even the parts of the film that deal with the importance and beauty of animals and nature are stunning and terrific.  It's a wonder that Jarmusch hasn't been swallowed up by Hollywood yet.
I cannot recommend this film more, but, like many of my fellow reviewers have said, many viewers will not like this film.  It doesn't appeal to everyone and that is truly a shame.  The story will not relate to many people, and that is bad for this movie.  Only one word can be described when telling someone about Jarmusch's latest: great.",1000512000,,1613,4.684397163120567

The self-sacrifice of the main character Ghost Dog to his Mafioso master doesn't work, it's too easy, too formulaic. The character learns nothing in his exploits. He fails to see his chosen ""Master"" for what he is. The story would have worked better if Ghost Dog had stopped to realize that he was making a fatal mistake with his slave-like dedication to the samurai code. The action offers Ghost Dog many opportunities for that brilliant flash of insight but he is too dedicated and loyal to step off the warrior path to see it for what it really is.

His direction is focused and plausible, his writing is professional, intriguing and totally unexpected and his acting is unexplainably real. Jim is the bomb at facial expressions, you can almost see his eyes talking - it's an incredible performance that takes this African-American a step higher.

The story is pretty straightforward - but for only those that cannot look into the many layers of characterization of the killer. The best scenes definitely involve Ghost Dog's interaction with a little African American girl, to whom he seeks to bequeath his repertoire of books. Not only is the photography top notch (don't MISS the opening sequences), but also very human in the way it treats its subjects. There is no ""beautification"" of any character - everyone is presented the same way for the viewer to draw their conclusion. Even the expected, sad ending, does not really make one feel sad or sorry. It's so matter of fact that you wonder why other films are not the same way. A killer who is obsessed with the way of the Samurai, seeks to avenge the death of his friends (pigeons), and also owes his current Master, his life. Situations get very complicated, and he ends up getting tied down by the weaknesses of the cowardly mobsters. Of course you should see the whole movie to understand what's being said in the reviews.

I usually am not a fan of film noir, which I consider this film to be, however I was drawn into the plot and the acting was excellent.  The quotes from the Hagakure: The Way of the Samarai, throughout the film enhance the plot. I wouldn't be a bit suprized if the ""Ghost Dog"" also has Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War"" on his shelf as well.

Because of this, Ghost Dog promises his samurai based loyalty to this gangster. Ghost Dog lives as he thinks the samurai did. He reads about the culture and raises pigeons. His best friend is a French ice cream man who speaks no English. It works out well though since Ghost Dog speaks no French. And he kills people for money payable once a year on the first day of autumn.
My Opinion:  This is a strange little movie. It could have worked, but it's got some problems. The mobsters who are suppose to be the bad guys are never very threatening. They are all just silly cartoon characters. Yeah I know cartoons are a motif in the movie. But without a strong antagonist in the film, Ghost Dog is never really tested. His values, morals, and physical skills are never put to the test. This would have made things interesting. The attempts at comedy (and I'm assuming that they were really attempts at comedy) fall way short and end up being just plain sad. The way Ghost Dog and the French ice cream man say the same things without knowing it just does not fit in. It doesn't lighten up the movie, it makes it uncomfortable. The mobsters weren't funny either, just silly. Forest Whitaker does put in a very good performance and the excerpts from the samurai manual are interesting as well.

Its about this fat guy who lives in the ghetto who, after being beat up at the age of 19 decides to read a samurai philosophy book, and becomes a ""ghetto ninja.""  First he's a contract killer for the mob, then he turns against the mob which consists of the head bosses watching the roadrunner cartoons in every single bleeding scene that they are in.

I like how Jarmusch tried to fuse all the disparate elements in the film together -- worn down, ineffectual, deadbeat Italian gangsters watching cartoons and rapping Public Enemy songs in a Samurai story where the Samurai is an urban black man whose best friend speaks a language he doesn't understand, etc.  And it's really funny to boot although there is alot of graphic violence, which is usually unheard of in a Jarmusch film.

1097781,4,6305958181,"""Ghost Dog"" is the first Jim Jarmusch movie I've seen, and it was a quirky little treat.  The movie lopes along in much the same rhythm Forest Whitaker chooses for his character's walk, and the pleasure of a lope is that it may seem you're getting nowhere fast, but you are moving along and you get to notice the sights along the way.  The sights in this movie set you up for at least one double-take in every scene.  ""Did I really see that?""  ""Did he really say that?""  The mafia chieftans are painted with broad strokes - nobody's really that stupid, but it's their buffonery that makes them dangerous, and oddly charming. Almost every act of violence is foreshadowed by a cartoon clip that the cartoon-addicted mafiosi are watching before situations hit the fan.  It would be an evening of viewing just to compare the cartoons with the live action that follows.  Their code of honor certainly comes more from comic book absurdities than life.  They kill each other because they are cartoon characters, and that's what cartoon characters do. Ghost Dog's (Whitaker's) actions are foreshadowed by excerpts from the ""Book of the Samurai"" and as honorable as they may seem they are just as absurd as the mafiosi, and as lovable as he may be he's sad in his understanding that he's an anachronism.  Ghost Dog's interactions with his best friend, the ice-cream man, and his new friend, a highly literate little girl, are pure pleasure.  There is an affection that passes between the characters that is lovely to behold.  Jarmusch seems to have decided that absurdity plays best as deadpan, and this movie is a study in the best and most consistent deadpan I've ever seen.  Even the stray dog seems like a reincarnation of Buster Keaton. I recommend this movie in the same way I'd recommend ""Wings of Desire"" - settle back, hold your judgement, and just let the story carry you along.

Many directors will resort to certain tactics to keep the audience distant from the characters, but Jarmusch likes to hang on for a slightly uncomfortable amount of time, just to give you that little extra glimpse into their lives.

1097786,2,6305958181,"**1/2  Jim Jarmusch's films have always been an acquired taste - and ""Ghost Dog"" is, assuredly, no exception.  Not content to spin out straightforward narratives, nor to adhere to the standard strictures of any particular genre, Jarmusch at least deserves credit for his originality, iconoclasm and daring.  But such an approach to filmmaking comes with some built-in pitfalls and risks, and, in Jarmusch's case, the quality of his films has often been much less than the sum of their impressive parts.  Furthermore, a filmmaker who so deliberately taxes the patience of his audience may find more people leaving the theatre than coming in.
In both plot and style, ""Ghost Dog"" is a bizarre hybrid - made up of equal parts samurai adventure tale (though there is no sword fighting), urban street crime drama and Italian mafia gangster film.  Forrest Whitaker plays the mysterious Ghost Dog, a black man steeped in the ways of the ancient Samurai Code.  Having been saved from death eight years earlier by an Italian mobster, Ghost Dog now dedicates himself, according to the samurai oath of loyalty, to fulfilling the needs and desires of his new ""master.""  Thus, Ghost Dog spends his time gunning down ""contracts"" as per his leader's request.  But with his latest ""hit,"" Ghost Dog has struck too close to the mafia boss himself - and now the hunter has become the hunted.
The plotting, which is convoluted and inscrutable much of the time, is obviously not the area in which Jarmusch's heart - as both writer and director - truly lies.  Style has always been this filmmaker's main preoccupation, and ""Ghost Dog"" does manage to combine just enough ""slightly off"" elements effectively to create a world rich in mysticism and exoticism.  The mere concept of an urban black gangster adhering to an ancient Japanese code - involved with a group of Italian gangsters adhering to their own similar ancient code - somehow lends itself to the exotic.  Moreover, Jarmusch's methodical and deliberate pacing, his use of a slowly gliding camera, his reliance on a haunting urban soundtrack all contribute to establishing and effectively maintaining the air of surrealism found in the concept itself.
Yet, for all its undeniable virtues, ""Ghost Dog"" is, ultimately, not a very compelling film.  Part of the problem rests in the fact that, for all its originality of vision, the film emerges, finally, as a bit too pretentious, smug and self-satisfied.  We are supposed to see Ghost Dog as somehow nobler than his mafia counterparts because he seems motivated by a higher cause - the ancient samurai code.  Snippets of the code are read to us and flashed on the screen during scene fade-outs to make us appreciate the ""beauty"" and ""wisdom"" of this classic belief system.  Yet any way you cut it or gussy it up, Ghost Dog is STILL nothing more than a cold-blooded killer - love pigeons, dogs, cutesy ice cream vendors and adorable little girls though he may.  Just because the samurai code has the concept of ""tradition"" behind it doesn't make it necessarily worthy of respect or admiration.  And just because Ghost Dog is so dedicated to the rule of ""loyalty"" that he will mow down dozens of men because his ""master"" asks him to doesn't make him any more heroic than the mafia leaders who - not being as poetic by nature I guess - have the sad misfortune of couching their oaths of loyalty in much less self-congratulatory terms.  ""Tradition,"" as Tevye was forced to learn, is not, in and of itself, inherently superior to more enlightened thinking simply because it has managed to survive many centuries or even millennia intact.  The theme of the film then simply becomes offensive when it is obviously intended to be deep and meaningful.  Given that situation, we find ourselves less inclined to go along with the director's patience-demanding glacial pacing.
Thus, ""Ghost Dog,"" unless you are a diehard Jarmusch devotee, will probably end for you long before the closing credits roll by.",984182400,11,3977,4.925149700598802

What ever else you read about it, GHOST DOG is a truly remarkable film. It combines, on one level, the ever-present philosophies of the connoted 'ancient Japan' (Hagakure was written early 18th century- not that ancient!), the hip-hop beats of the wu-tang clan, the comic sopranoesque characters of the rather embarrassingly old, fat and senile second-rate mafiosa and yet behind all this lies hidden depths. The question of the importance of language and communication within our society, with particular reference to Lacans theories of pschoanalysis, are questioned, the codes of times gone are queried and fondly remembered, the issue of sexual equality is cleverly integrated, and overall, the entirety of the film is one which appeals to all. Admittedly, it combines some of my favorite film genres, so I'm gonna be a bit biased. In fact, for me, the only thing that could have made this film more complete would have been a martial arts showdown with a shadowy ninja, using matrix-style special effects aboard an alienesque spacecruiser.

Jamursch is great in the way he differs from the norm, he obviously tries to make the world ghost dog lives in a little different from the world we live in, but not so much that we feel a sense of detachment from it.  The style in this movie is great, everything has a dream like quality, which doesn't detract from the characters or the story.  The pace of the movie is slow, but never boring, ghost dog is just such a great character, that I never got tired of watching him.  The action scenes in this movie are very different from typical fare, they are subdued, with no obscene wire work or ridiculous gun play.  They fit the pace and style of the movie perfectly.  Last, the soundtrack is flawless, RZA of the wu-tang clan composed it, and it is breathtaking.  It adds to the atmosphere immeasurably.

Having the boys over for some drinks and having an MST3K party, or for a how not to make a movie. There were to many times the director tried to convey a message to his audience.

1097880,4,6305958181,"You have to let this film wash over you for the first few minutes; it might take a quarter hour to fall under its spell. But you will, if only because Forest Whitaker's Ghost Dog is one of the most interesting and sympathetic characters in modern cinema.
The drag you might feel at the start returns at times, particularly when director Jim Jarmusch puts his characters behind the wheel. As in his ""Night on Earth,"" Jarmusch seems to believe that the way people drive reveals their character. Perhaps, but not when Jarmusch is behind the camera. Another director might not have had the vision to put this near-masterpiece of intimate cinema together, but Jarmusch's great flaw of somnulescent editing infuses the film.
That said, this is a movie about characters living with outdated world views. We befriend Ghost Dog, who is a hired killer, and dislike the Mafia capos for whom he works. Yet both live by codes that have become obsolete, and both hurtle toward tragic ends brought about by strict adherance to their out-of-date ideals. Even so, there is grace and beauty in Ghost Dog's adherance to the samurai code, and his ideals allow him to embrace his inevitable end in a way that those around him cannot.
If Kurosawa was a young filmmaker today, this is the sort of movie he would likely make. It would be a better film in his hands. Yet despite Jarmusch's technical failings, he succeeds at creating an absorbing movie that is driven by fascinating characters and the brilliant performances of the actors who play them. The soundtrack, produced by Wu Tang's RZA, manages to bridge the tension between the characters and their very different millieus.

It is riddled to the brim with horrendous acting (except for Forest Whittaker, as always), flawed plot, nasty editing, and some truly pie-faced mafia boys who aren't convincing in the slightest. What is intended to be a serious film about the utilization of the samurai code into urban American society tends to fall flat on its face, and oftentimes, I felt as if it was the fault of the director, inept at bringing the essence of the storyline to the screen. I still don't understand the symbol of ""Rashomon"", which is a character study about a murderer in 18th century Japan.
If you're having friends over, this could also be rented as a great party flick; in the same vein as Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". There's one sequence where a ""Godfather""-esque character is upset about a family member's death, tosses up his arms, and the camera literally stays with the group for a minute afterwards as the actors kick dirt around and fidget, apparently anxious for the director to yell ""Cut!""

1097885,4,6305958181,"If you think its virtually impossible to create an original film about a hired killer working for the mafia, you have not seen Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai.  It's an imperfect film which will probably require about 20 minutes of patience before it absorbs you into its off-beat charms.  Sticking with Ghost Dog will reward you with a quirky, original, and at times very funny, dark comedy.  It's a film written and directed by indie film iconoclast Jim Jarmusch, and you'll find he remains very fond of fading out of scenes and creating interesting but not overly complicated visual motifs to play off of.  He of course finds some quirky characters and relationships to amuse us with-particularly a french speaking Haitian ice-cream vendor who speaks only a few English words, but is mostly perfectly understood by Forrest Whitakers' Ghost Dog.  Jarmusch also over-plays an interesting amusing idea (mobsters are always watching cartoons on t.v.) through repetition.
Forest Whitaker plays Ghost Dog, a character who lives by a strict Samurai code and is ready to accept-even embrace death at any moment without fear.  Whitaker's sleepy eyes and demeanor always add warmth to any character he plays, but what's surprising is how (like Hong Kong's Sammo Hung) Whitaker despite his size is able to move with a ballet dancer's grace.  It's his balance, centeredness and grace that makes the outbreaks of violence somewhat surprising throughout the film.
According to the samurai tradition, Ghost Dog has decided to live his life by, when a small time mobster (John Tormey) saves his life, Ghost Dog pledges utter loyalty to the mobster and is used as a contract killer by the mobster.  Ghost Dog only communicates with his mobster master through messages sent via the pigeons G.D. cares for.  The mobster contracts  Ghost Dog to wipe out a made mob guy  who's girlfriend is the mobster's boss' daughter.  The daughter is present when Ghost Dog kills her boyfriend. The mobster Ghost Dog kills is the uncle of another under-boss (Cliff Gorman) who demands from boss (Henry Silva) that his uncle's killer be eliminated.  Cliff Gorman really shines in his role as the under-boss who enjoys rapping to ten year old hip-hop hits by Public Enemy and Flavor Flav.  Ghost Dog has been such a loyal, efficient contract killer for Tormey however this creates a dilemma.  In one of the films' best scenes, Ghost Dog's master (Tormey) pleads for his servant's (Ghost Dog's) life and must try to explain the odd arrangements involving sending messages via Pigeon he has with the contract killer..  Tormey's mobster is told; ""Better Ghost Dog than you, right?"" and the simple plot of the film is set.  What happens is not always what you expect.  For instance, except for a couple of voice-over, Forest Whitaker doesn't speak any dialogue for the film's first forty-five minutes. He  is a loner who keeps almost entirely to himself but calls the French-speaking ice-cream  vendor (Isaach DeBankole) his best friend  and befriends a curious little girl (Camille Winbush) he meets in a local park.  At times the film erupts into brutal violence.
I was reminded many times throughout the film of one of Jarmusch's idols, Sam Fuller (the great,under-appreciated director who's best films were in the late 50's/early 60's and include Pickup on South Street and Shock Corridor).  Fuller would also find fascinating, original and somewhat experimental ways to present rather familiar plot lines to his audience.
There's also a reverance and appreciation of the contexts Jarmusch draws upon.  He does not do this in the somewhat plagiaristic fashion of a Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction specifically) but in a way that utilizes ideas in very diverse material (like Seijun Suzuki's 1967 film Branded to Kill, books like Ryunosuke Akutagawa's Rashomon and Other Stories,  Yamamoto Tsunetomo's Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai, and most surprisingly Mary Shelley's Frankenstein).  All of these are combined with GoodFellas set in urban setting with a hip-hop soundtrack by Wu Tang Clan's  RZA.
Hagakure in fact serves as  Ghost Dog's bible and is quoted (in English) with quiet voice-overs and inter-titles 13 times throughout the film.  It's a risky thing for a film to include it's own annotated footnotes, but Jarmusch pulls it off.
 The balancing act only fails when it turns in on itself and concludes in a classic Western showdown.  Even so, it's not an unsatisfying compromise, but a willingness of Jarmusch to submit to audience expectations and keep things within a defined conventional narrative.
If you're looking for an original, but still entertaining crime thriller, Ghost Dog should more than satisfy.

1097886,3,6305958181,"Jarmusch does some interesting things with Ghost Dog, a solidly artistic film, but a similar film, Le Samourai by Jean-Pierre Melville is an incredible film and a masterpiece in cinema.  Jarmusch uses some of the same themes that Melville used; a romantic and unrealistic look at a professional killer; an old-fashioned protagonist who cannot survive in the modern world; existentialist thought.  However, Melville managed to create a more subtle approach to his film, creating a different (and in my opinion, superior) approach to all of his themes.  Jarmusch has Ghost Dog (the title character) explain to an Italian Gangster what Bushido is, and has Whittaker continuously quote from Hagakure.  Jarmusch feels that he has to explain all of the underlying themes, that his audience needs to have everything clarified; this stands in contrast with the Eastern philosophy of restraint and minimalism. Melville however, presents the samurai aspect of Jef Costello (the protagonist) through subtle character development, and the Hare-Kiri at the end of the film.  Melville captures the contrasting elements of Jef--a lone schizophrenic--with much more restraint and subtlety than Jarmusch; Jef's dialog is minimal, his face a mask that betrays no emotion (which is very appropriate to the etiquette of a samurai and the tradition of saving face.)  Of course these two films are different, both directors do great things; but if you liked Ghost Dog (which I did) or even if you didn't, definitely check out Le Samourai.",977356800,8,1516,5.295833333333333

I particularly liked the segueing of the cartoons to the next action. If you pay attention and stay ""awake"" in the Buddhist sense, this movie will move you.

Excellent performances are also given in all the supporting roles, including the excitable ice cream van owner and some crazy mafioso. The movie combines the philosophical with the absurd to great effect. It's true strength lies in its originality - the contrast between Samurai, Gangster and Hip-hop culture is fantastic. Having said this, the slow paced style is not to everyones taste and if you're going to get hung up about realism or miniscule detail then don't bother. The point of the film is the exposition of themes and character. Personally I loved this movie. It is not really, despite the title, a Samurai movie.

Some of the scenes are simply amazing; for example, the training scene with Forest Whittaker on the rooftops practicing kendo and knifeplay in slow-mo is a superb adrenalin rush;  I also liked the shots of Ghost Dog's bird travelling over the city backed with RZA's sparse rhythm tracks.  And the way death is handled in this film is amazing - no dramatic flourishes or overacting, just death, raw, sudden and surprisingly businesslike.  The cast is nearly picture-perfect - I especially like Henry Silva as a steely-faced mobster.  And Whittaker has this amazing countenance which does absolute justice to the futile, insane, yet strangely balanced Ghost Dog character.  One moment he's a steely-eyed sniper coldly hunting his target from afar, and then a sparrow flutters, landing on his rifle and blocking his view, and he stops to admire the bird and smiles in gentle affection for nature.

It lacks the hustle and bustle of typical action/drama  movies, and in comparison to some recent releases, it's ""quiet.""  I would not have wanted to watch this type of movie in a theatre either.  Don't get me wrong, it is good and Forest Whitaker's acting is great,  but...it's different.  It's the type of movie I prefer to watch at home  while I savor a cup of hot tea or something.

I'm here to tell you that  Jim Jarmusch has made a work of art, but not a deep and complex work of  art, but an entertaining one at that. Seeing this movie made me think about  the code of honor that Ghost Dog lives by, and made me think about my own  way I live my life. I'm not saying this movie changed my life, but it made  me think, while entertaining me at the same time. You can't ask much more  from a movie than that. This movie has some great humorous moments (the  old, Itallian mafia guy rattling off his favorite rap artists is one of my  favorite) and while the action scenes aren't exactly nop notch, Jarmusch  films them with a certain flow. Besides, this movie isn't about action or  violence. In fact, there's a certain irony in a movie about a man who lives  his life with violence, yet the movie doesn't focus on it. To top  everything off, Forest Whitaker does an AWESOME job in this movie. He won't  win an Oscar... but he should. Go rent it. Buy it. See it. Whatever.

I was very pleasantly surprised to find this by  far his most mature work to date. Understated and poignant while never  boring, Ghost Dog is a highly stylized character study of a modern day  Samarai, a hit man who takes on the mob -- the same mob to which his master  belongs.
Jarmusch also had the supreme good luck to secure The RZA to  score this flick. His quiet, melodic, raw hip hop groove match the mood of  the action perfectly.

1098199,5,6305958181,"Ghost dog is the new offering by Jarmusch who still holds a very respectable place in the league of US indie film making. The film is based  on the story of an ancient Japan obsessed Samurai Type hitmen who chooses  to live his life under the guidance of ""Hagakure"" The book of  Samurai. Forrest Whitaker really portrays an anti hero who lives the life  of a long forgotten group of brave and noble as well as hardened and  fanatical band of Japanese warriors,in some fantastical acting. He basicly  proves that when given a chance he is able to portray his acting abilities  in full.  In a society where everything seems to be going downhill, Ghost  Dog lives his life devoted totally to a mafioso who saved his life years  ago. Jarmusch uses pages of Hagakure to help out the viewer throghout the  film in order to make Ghost Dog's actions more acceptable but If you really  want to get the deeper meaning of the messages it is better to have a go on  the Hagakure itself which is amazingly holding an alternative way of living  to our modern society and way of life in many ways.  Jarmusch has brilliant  ideas as always with birds,jokes about mafia (especially the ""they  wanted equality and got it now"" bit) and musical structure which is  placed when Ghost Dog drives stolen cars. Story is quite satisfactory with  many interesting characters like french speaking ice cream seller and  insane daughter of mafioso etc. But the character Ghost Dog is the  unforgettable one who will sure influence many viewers in one way or  another after watching the film. I personally enjoyed this film very much  and like evry other Jarmusch film the viewer is not required to be an  intellectual or a pretentious art house freak. Story is pure and simple for  everyone but If you want more complexity and psychoanalytical stuff, there  are many treasures buried to be find out by the spectator.

Whitaker gives a great  performance as the title character. He plays the character very understated  in a role which would usually be over the top.

It's full of  outstanding (often-understated) performances by the full cast with Forest  Whitaker, John Tormey, Isaach De Bankole and especially Camille Winbush  standing out. There's also a great little cameo by Gary Farmer in which he  states his races thoughts about ""the white man"" better in four  words than others have in hundreds! The story is about as basic as they  come -- an assassin for the mob is betrayed by them and seeks revenge --but  seen through Jarmusch's camera it takes on new dimensions.  You have a  group of men living by one code colliding headfirst with an individual  living by another code and something has to give. It's especially  intriguing how both groups truly belong in another age -- and they all  realize it. The picture is steeped in a mood that is taken to new levels by  THE RZA's brilliant score. There is even a nod to the great director Sinjin  Suzuki, in a scene that really makes no more sense here than it did in  Suzuki's film, but brought a smile to my face none the less. The DVD  contains a neat little documentary, a few interesting deleted scenes, a  music video and an alterative audio track containing only the musical  score.

The parallels made between the main character's lifestyle and that  of a Samurai warrior via on-screen text were all one-to-one, simple  comparisons.  There wasn't much substance to the coincidences therein.  Rather, when a Way of the Samurai quote was followed by its fulfillment  through the actions of Whittaker, it was cliche and kind of  one-dimensional, if not altogether weak.  To me, it seemed an easy job to  superimpose a criminal's actions over vague idioms such as those in the  Hagakure.  The irony the movie attempted to convey was lost somewhere in  the shallow character development and ordinary cinematography.  Just a  sporadic dollop of unique camera angle up the drain pipe, or deep  friendship transcending language barriers was too little to spread over 116  minutes of formulaically droll murders and poor acting.  Not that Forrest  Whittaker's acting was substandard, but he could have personally stretched  much more than the script and production seemed to allow.

1098265,3,6305958181,"Recently there have been several American films that attempt to compare, contrast, and mix Asian and American culture.  While films like the  Corrupter and Romeo Must Die were good attempts I feel neither did the  subject justice.  In the case of those films looking at Chinese  culture.
Ghost Dog successfully does this with Japanese culture.  Taking  Japanese feudalism, Zen Buddhism and applying it to a modern day inner city  hitman who works and then takes on the mob.
In Japanese feudal society  the Emperor was a figure head to the Shogun who really ran the show.  Under  the Shogun were Daimyo (Lords) who were the landowners.  Under the Daimyo  were the Samurai.  The Samurai were loyal to their respective Daimyo.  Samurai would rather face death or commit ritual suicide (seppuku) rather  than fail or betray their daimyo.  Samurai without Daimyo were looked down  upon.  These Samurai were Ronin.
Ghost Dog deals with all of the above  and applies it to the story of a hitman (Samurai) looking out for his boss  (Daimyo).  Interjected within the story are actual quotes from Japanese  writings on the role of the Samurai.
The film is slow at times.  It is a  very well done film.  The acting is great.  The music is perfect.  But it  is slow at times and that can make it tough to watch in spots.  But other  than some of the pacing its a brilliant movie.
The DVD has some cool  extra stuff.  The film is definetly worth watching.  The music is great and  the DVD does have good stuff in addition to the film.  But because the film  is slow at times, I do not know if its the type of film you will watch over  and over again.  Therefore, I can't recommend buying it.  Rent it, watch  it, and see for yourself.
Again, the film takes the Samurai and Japanese  culture and adapt it very cleverly to modern times.  An interesting concept  and film.

Like all hit men, Ghost Dog leads a solitary and simple  life, but what makes him special is that he's very reflective and dedicated  to the code of the samurai.  Throughout the film, various excepts from the  Hagakure text are flashed on the screen whenever Ghost Dog ponders on them.  These excepts from Hagakure will have you pondering as well because the  ones that are flashed are very profound.  When I rented this movie, I  rewinded over some of the quotes several times and although I took the  video back yesterday, I still find myself thinking about the quotes over  and over again.  My favorite quotes are the first one regarding meditating  on a violent and brutal death and the one about two things becoming one.

Throughout the movie Whitaker's character, ""Ghost Dog"",  reads passages from a Samurai warriors guide book.  I assume the readings  are supposed to give the viewer a philosophical look into the chaarters  ideology.  At first these readings are sort of amusing (again, I do not  think that is their intention) but later these reading become down right  annoying.

This Movie surpasses the usual 5 star rating, if I could I'd give it  a 10. The acting and directing are both perfect. Jim Jarmusch has done it  again, only this time even better.

My friends and I spent a great deal of time on this question, along with  ""Why in the hell did we stay for this whole movie?  I think the two  questions are related.
Ghost Dog is one of the worst films I have ever  paid money to see, period.  It is an art film gone very wrong. I tried to  justify shelling out the money to see this film in a first run theater.  But unlike some other reviewers, I lack the imagination to make up these  deep hidden meanings.
Ghost Dog kills with a gun and opens and starts  cars with some high tech device, he is no Samurai.  His training is the  book Hagekure: The book of the Samurai, which appears to have brainwashed  him.  The director stops the film to put up what seem like endless quotes  from this book, while Forest Whitaker reads them at a third grade tempo.  These were appropriate times for the audience to do a time check on their  wristwatch, or maybe make a cell call.  While some quotes appeared  philisophical, others mention putting on rouge when the Samarai wakes up to  keep him from looking pale.  How interesting.
Even worse were the  attempts to make the film break the 90 minute mark (it seemed MUCH longer).  On several occasions Forest would steal a car and drive slowly through the  city streets for the entire duration of a RZA track.  While perfect for  late night MTV, if they still played music videos, these scenes take the  film tempo from slow to comatose.
The attempts to lighten the mood with  humor were bombs also.  The lack of communication between the haitian and  Ghost Dog basically interpreting each other was only funny once, yet it  goes on and on.  The italian gangster rapping along to Public enemy was  silly and well over the top, especially in the presense of the mob boss.  The only real laughs I got were seeing Forest twirl his gun like a sword  before holstering it after each kill.  I don't believe this was intended to  be funny.
The showdown between Ghost Dog and Louie was anti-climatic at  best.  Why didn't Ghost Dog disembowl himself like real Samarai do.  That  would have been much more entertaining.
I'm not sure why film critics  give so-called art films so much more room to be blatantly bad and stupid  than the big Hollywood productions. Other reviews appear to have bought  into this hook, line, and sinker
I suggest to movie buyers to purchase a  great hit-man-with-a-conscious film like The Professional, or le femme  nikita.

1098522,5,6305958181,"Jim Jarmusch, idiosyncratic warrior and independent filmmaker extraordinare, has made another film that falls, both stylistically and thematically, into the director's long line of culture clash,  fish-out-of-water comic dramas. It is an offbeat crime comedy that, for the  most part, follows the genre's rules according to plot (most of it is  straight out of Le Samourai), but adds its own spin with oddball subplots,  allusions, and touches (all bearing the imprint of their director). The  film bears a number of similarites, in fact, with Jarmusch's previous  fictious work, the surreal, deadpan Western Dead Man, except Ghost Dog is  much more accessible to mainstream audiences.
Forest Whitaker, in a role  written specifically for him, plays the title character with the quiet  elegance, dignity, and grace of an early Charlie Chaplin. (Johnny Depp also  comes to mind for his performances in the aforementioned Dead Man and Tim  Burton's Edward Scissorhands.) Ghost Dog is an old-fashioned samurai, and  hit man,  stuck in an ever-changing world. (perhaps much like director  Jarmusch and his ever-fading romantic worldview and optimism). He lives on  the roof of a buiding, feeds pigeons, and keeps mainly to himself. His  relationships with a French ice cream vendor(think Night On Earth) and a  young girl (similar to that in Pi) are priceless. The light humor sprinkled  throughout adds much interest to the proceedings. Much of it comes at the  expense of the helpless Italian mobsters in the film. Perhaps Jarmusch's  only failure is not developing some of his secondary characters beyond  their stereotypes.
The DVD appears to warrant a purchase (I have mine on  pre-order) for its deleted scenes, documentary, and isolated music score.  The music is one of the most important, and surprisingly wonderful aspects  of the film. (This coming from someone who is by no means a fan of rap.)  The other extras should offer an interesting insight into Jarmusch's  directorial processes, although the lack of a audio commentary by the  director is disappointing. We are lucky, though, to get what bonuses we do  after MGM's no-frills release of Mystery Train on DVD.
So, if you're a  fan of Jarmusch's, of independent cinema, or just any type of unique and  hypnotically engrossing film, Ghost Dog would be an excellent DVD to look  into purchasing. While you're at it, consider buying Yamamoto Tsunetomo's  Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai, a major influence on the film. A film  recommended to any patient filmgoer over 15. It is one of my favorite films  of 2000 to date, and the best, funniest, and strangest crime comedy since  the Coen Brothers' 1998 effort, The Big Lebowski.",961891200,28,2692,5.152777777777778

I'm not saying this movie may have caused brain injury but then again...,1507161600,,399,4.405405405405405
