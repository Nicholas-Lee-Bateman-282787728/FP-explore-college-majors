6264113,5,B00II50JLE,"As I am new, yet big fan, of the Fairy Tail series I was more then eager to receive the latest available blu ray/ DVD combo. I was surprised however upon opening the package that the plastic case was slightly damaged. Thankfully it didn't affect the discs inside and I was able to enjoy the final episodes of Fairy Tail's battle with Grimoire Hearts to the fullest. I can't wait to get my hands on a copy of part 11. (However at over $40 for 12 episodes, I'll try to be patient and wait for a price drop.)",1403740800,,505,4.163265306122449

6264115,5,B00II50JLE,"Fairy tale is good fun. The art is beautiful, the stories are uplifting, and the voice actors are top notch. I fear that funimation does change dialog which irritates me, but I can't prove it. Just seems like some of the usual sexual humor that is found in most Japanese anime is tonned down or removed. Could just be my imagination. In any case, the series continues to be good, and is a nice example of the use of positive psychology to put a smile on every person who watches it.",1400889600,2,482,4.3076923076923075

6264146,5,B00II50JLE,"Fairy Tail is an ongoing anime/manga series about magic. It's main  male protagonist is named Natsu Dragneel and it's main female protagonist, Lucy Heartfilia. This is a fighting kind of anime and contains a lot of violence and a little bit of sexuality which, however has been considerably toned down by Funimation as compared to the Japanese version. This anime is currently on episode 192 and chapter 394.

The Fairy Tail 'Parts' are nicely packaged versions (but expensive) of the anime.  The only downside to them is that they contain only 12-13 episodes each. This high cost I believe is due to the fact that these sets are Blu Ray/DVD Combo Packs meaning they contain the same episodes on both Blu and DVD which are present in a single set.

(SPOILERS AHEAD)
Fairy Tail Part 10 Blu Ray/DVD Combo Pack:
This particular set contains episodes from 109-120 spanning the second half and the most intense part of the battle between Fairy Tail and Grimoire Heart. This set concludes with Fairy Tail's victory over the dark guild and Zeref infiltrating Hades' ship and threatning him leaving the audience in suspence and anticipation for the next set.
In terms of video quality this set is mind blowing. Fairy Tail is in 1080p HD and therefore it looks simply amazing on an HDTV on a decent blu ray player. I can't say the same for the DVDs in this set which fail to compare with the blu rays.
In terms of audio quality also this set is amazing and Funimation has done a great job in dubbing and the Japanese voice actors have also done a great job. However as usual Funimation does change the dialog of the characters a little bit but if you don't watch the Japanese version you will never even know the difference. This set offers two audio tracks:
1. English Dolby True HD
2. Japanese Dolby True HD.

This set was a satisfactory buy for me and I hope it will be the same for others.

Fun Fact: These 'Parts' have reversible covers with this particular set having a reversible cover portraying Juvia.",1406246400,2,2001,4.622535211267605

6264148,5,B00II50JLE,"The War on Tenrou island continues on the ravaged landscape. Fighting in what is left of the forests, scattered Fairy Tail members skirmish against the remaining Seven Kin of Purgatory members. Juvia, fighting to protect her 'beloved' Gray, takes on Meldy in a water battle that can only end in death. At the same time, Lucy and Natsu take on Kain Hikaru.

Unfortunately for Hades- with his ranks thinning quickly, he has but one option left to stem Fairy Tail's comeback: unleash his most powerful wizard- Sub commander BlueNote Stinger.

Other battles rage on the island: Gildarts, Freed, and Bigslow return to aid Fairy Tail. Gildarts and Bluenote go head to head in a 'Crash Magic' vs 'Gravity Magic' battle that sinks part of the island! After Azuma uproots the Tenrou tree, everyone's powers are sucked from them- well, everyone except Erza. Hoping for a challenging battle, and glory, Azuma decides to let Erza keep her powers.

Meanwhile, only one other Purgatory member is not fighting: Ultear. By a chance of fate, Gray happens to run into her while she is trying to carry Zeref back to the Grimoire heart ship.

I won't give any spoilers on these fights if possible, But part 10 ends with a 4 episode long battle with Wendy, Natsu, Gray, Lucy, and Erza vs Master Hades. Hades- with his ancient primordial magic, has ENDLESS flowing magic power that he can gather and use at his will. Though fighting with everything they have, Fairy Tail's strongest team looks beaten until an ultra powerful ex-Fairy Tail wizard shows up in an attempt to turn the tide once again.

Overall, this is my FAVORITE Fairy Tail part. I remember rewatching ""Erza vs Azuma"" the first day I saw it three times. Other battles like Juvia vs Meldy, I had to rewatch multiple times as well. The World's most powerful, and renown guilds square off in an all out, climactic duel in Fairy Tail Part 10!

8642170,4,B00II50JLE,"This is a good series, it filled the void that bleach left in me by its downward spiral in quality.  So far in this series there has only been two episodes I've had to fast forward past because the story and voice acting of the villain was terrible.  I enjoy the manga also but am kinda burned out on all the sexuality the author feels he needs to express.  I feel this story and the characters are strong enough on their own that they don't need panty shots and the nude scenes for shock factor.  Maybe the author is just sexually frustrated with his life and can only express those feelings through his manga?  I dunno but I'm not anti-sex its just this series is so neat and I feel it does not need any of that.",1439942400,,714,4.182481751824818
