8167794,4,B000MCIC3S,"Genesis was the first PPV under TNA's new creative writer, Vince Russo. From this PPV, new storylines were developed and would carry on to next month's Turning Point and into the following 2007 year.

Preshow: Eric Young Vs. Robert Rude - This was a short match. EY was wrestling in his blue jeans and was dragged into this match after Robert Rude and Miss Brooks came out and challenged Eric Young to a match right before EY could announce his ""big"" announcement. Rude cheated to win the match but the referee re-started the match after the fans told that Rude used the ropes. Therefore, Eric Young gave Robert Rude a dose of his own medicine to win the match in the end and to begin his relationship with Miss Brooks. 2.5/5

Voodo Kin Mafia Vs. Serotonin - This was just an opener for VKM to mock DX and to continue their ""mission"" against DX & Vince McMahon. Nothing notewrothy or special here and this too was a pretty short match. Afterwards, Raven was revealed as the leader of Serotonin and would give Johnny Devine beatings from a kendo stick for some kind of punishment. 2/5

The Naturals Vs. Jay Lethal & Sonjay Dutt - This was a very enjoyable tag team match. It was originally suppose to be The Naturals against Team 3D but Team 3D was unable to make the PPV so Jay Lethal & Sonjay Dutt became the substitutes. Overall, this is a solid and very good match. 4/5

TNA X Division Championship
Christopher Daniels Vs. Chris Sabin - This was a very good X Division Title match and one of the best matches of the night. Chris Sabin was still in his cocky and arrogant character here and he pulled it off so well in this match. The two told a good inring story with solid inring work and not really having any ""crash and burn"" spots that has made the X Division over the years. The end only continued the Sabin/Lynn feud and with AJ Styles helping Daniels in his match that would have a role to play later in the night. 4.5/5

Ron Killings & Lance Hoyt Vs. Alex Shelley & Austin Starr - This was just a filler match to further continue the Shelley/Kevin Nash angle of Nash showing favoritism towards Austin Starr and not Alex Shelley. A decent tag team match but only here for the Shelley/Nash/Starr angle. 3/5

Christian Cage Vs. AJ Styles - It's a shame that these two didn't continue feuding after this match because this match was really great. Their styles & inring work really meshed in well with each other and AJ Styles and Christian Cage produced a solid back and forth contest. The ending came when Christopher Daniels tried to save AJ Styles like Styles did for Daniels in his match but would only backfire that helped to begin the AJ Styles/Rhino feud for the next couple of months ahead. 4.5/5

NWA Tag Team Championship
America's Most Wanted Vs. Latin American X Change - A solid tag team title match but fell a little bit too short for people to take it as something great and memorable after the big, personal build up this match got. In the end, TNA Executive Jim Cornette came out and stripped L.A.X. of the NWA Tag Team Titles which the fans became very vocal about in a very negative way. 3.75/5

NWA Heavyweight Championship
Sting Vs. Abyss - Do not expect the same Sting that you previously saw in TNA up to this point. Sting stepped up his game tremedously, more then in his match at Bound For Glory against Jeff Jarrett. Sting was totally a complete, different wrestler in this match as he took it to Abyss early in the match. There was a mix of brawling and wrestling in this match as Sting focusing on taking Abyss out while getting very physical in the progress. Sting even taking a hard chokeslam back first onto the thumb tacks that may shock some people since Sting never done anything like that throughout his whole career. The match was getting very good up to that point but went downhill after Sting goes crazy and eventually would hang Abyss upside down and throwing Abyss off the stage through tables and barbed wire boards...while losing his NWA Title in the progress due to TNA's rule of losing the title on a Disqualification. Still, I think this match was good and it delivered from a stand point. 3.5/5

Kurt Angle Vs. Samoa Joe - For some people, this match was a disappointment as they expected a match like Kurt Angle's match with Shawn Michaels from WrestleMania 21 or Shawn Michaels' match with Triple H from SummerSlam. The match wasn't very long, but Kurt Angle and Samoa Joe went non-stop and delivering a very fast paced, high impact, exciting match that everybody will appreciate. In the end, Samoa Joe's undefeated streak came to an end as he tapped out to Kurt Angle's Ankle Lock. For being called ""The Dream Match Of The Decade"", this match delivered in my eyes and was a good way to end the show. 4.5/5

I recommend this purchase. Even though the two main events didn't deliver the way they should've, the overall card is very good and would be a nice addition to your collection.",1245283200,,4940,4.515659955257271

VKM Vs. Matt Bentley, Johnny Devine & Kazarian
Pretty good match to start off a pay per view although it could've been a little longer. Kip James was taunting DX throughout the match and that made it entertaining. Rating 3.5/5

The Naturals Vs. Jay Lethal & Sonjay Dutt
Dutt and Lethal work together real well as a tag team, Sonjay Dutt is amazing, I think he may be the fastest moving wrestler I have ever had the priviledge to watch. Rating 4/5

X Division Championship Match
Chris Sabin Vs. Christopher Daniels (C)
This started off slow but it turned into a pretty solid match with both wrestlers pulling off some nice moves. It gets pretty exciting at the end with all the near falls and the after match activity should set up another encounter. Rating 4.5/5

Ron Killings & Lance Hoyt Vs. Austin Starr & Alex Shelley
Nothing special about this match as a matter of fact it was quite disappointing, this contest probably would've been better if Lance Hoyt and Austin Starr would've been taken out of it. Rating 2/5

A.J. Styles Vs. Christian Cage
This is a great mid-card match, I wish it would've went a little longer Cage and Styles have some pretty good in-ring chemistry. Rating 4.5/5

Tag Team Championship
AMW Vs. LAX
Exciting tag team action and Hernandez does some pretty amazing stuff for his size. I didn't agree with the unnecessary after match shenanigans with Cornette. LAX was way out of line but they are the rightful tag team champions, doing what Cornette did just takes prestige away from the championship and you never want to do that just ask WCW their world title never recovered from the self inflicted damage. Rating 3/5

NWA World Championship Match
Good world title match, I can't believe that Sting got chokeslammed onto the thumbtacks. Sting chokeslams Abyss off the top of the entrance ramp and onto two tables with barb wire on top. While I do not agree with the ending at the same time I say TNA needs to seriously reconsider changing that rule. Once again TNA you don't wanna do anything that's gonna take prestige away from any of your title belts. Rating 3/5

Dream Match Of The Decade
Kurt Angle Vs. Samoa Joe
Great main event, easily the best match of the night. The whole time I didn't want the match to end I wish they would've gave these guys at least a half hour. Although this isn't the best of their encounters I have to say it is pretty darn good for being their very first match together. Rating 5/5

Well I gave this pay per view 3 out of 5 stars it probably would've gotten 4 if it wasn't for the way TNA disrespected their tag titles and their world title but I will say this dvd is definitely worth buying just for the samoa joe vs. kurt angle match.",1201651200,,2777,4.5602409638554215
8167796,5,B000MCIC3S,"5 star rating because unlike WWE, TNA know how to put on a decent wrestling show that actually has, gasp, wrestling.

Overall I'd have to say that the Genesis pay-per-view was better than Lockdown 2006, it had a decent card and only one or two disappointing matches. However, if TNA want to continue as 'the new face of professional wrestling' they need to exploit the good and eradicate the bad.

Voodoo Kin Mafia vs. Matt Bentley, Johnny Devine & Kazarian

If I was going to sum up this opening match in one word, I'd describe it as pointless since it was nothing more than a squash match. What is the point of the VKM? What do they offer TNA fans? On the other side of the coin, Matt Bentley (aka Michael Shane) & Kazarian were two of TNA's hottest up and coming stars, before they became Raven's lackeys. As for Johnny Devine taking those sickening kendo shots from Raven . . . . . . why TNA why? The match itself was what you'd expect, Jesse James got worked over for a good 5-10 minutes, before making the tag to Kip James who dominated all three of their opponents.

Rating 2/10

The Naturals vs. Jay Lethal & Sonjay Dutt

The Naturals are probably the best young tag team in TNA, but have they been given any recent title shots? Both teams showcased some excellent double team moves, as well as superb tag team wrestling during this match-up. Thankfully, the crowd warmed to their effort after the opening stinker. Andy Douglas & Chase Stevens continue to work effectively as heels (with outside interference from Shane Douglas), whilst the crowd cheered loudly for Dutt & Lethal. Particularly stunning was a double dive, with Lethal going through the ropes and Dutt going over the top, onto their opponents. Douglas & Stevens won the match after Douglas caused a distraction.

Rating 7/10

Christopher Daniels vs. Chris Sabin

A surprising contender for match of the night, with the X division title on the line. Although it started out slow, this was a superb match from start to finish, with Daniels and Sabin trading moves and countermoves, at a steadily quickening pace. Sabin's stunning Hesitation Dropkick hit its mark, as did a top rope splash from Daniels to the arena floor. Easily the second best match on the card; it had chain wrestling, technical wrestling, aerial wrestling, submission wrestling. Sabin deserves to ascend the TNA ranks for another reign as X Division Champion.

Rating 9/10

Ron 'The Truth' Killings & Lance Hoyt vs. Alex Shelley & Austin Starr

Let me just say that Shelley & Starr are going nowhere under the tutelage of Kevin Nash. Austin Aries made a big impact when he joined the TNA roster, but the new name/costume/gimmick doesn't work for him. This was kind of a boring match for me, mainly thanks to Lance Hoyt (aka Dallas) who had to fake an apparent leg/foot injury from early on. Shelley and Starr made continual tags for 10-15 minutes, before Hoyt managed to tag out and Ron Killings carried the match to its conclusive victory. A loss for Shelley and Starr which failed to put them over at all, what is TNA management thinking?

Rating 6/10

'The Phenomenal' AJ Styles vs. Christian Cage

You can always count on an AJ Styles match to offer something special and this didn't disappoint. Although it wasn't AJ's best match by far, his work ethic is exemplified by his ability to give 100% effort in any match. Cage played the heel, which meant this was billed as a grudge match from the off-set. AJ's signature moves included the pelay, back-flip inverted ddt, styles clash and that dropkick. I'm guessing Christian had a hard time keeping up, but he helped to make this the fourth best match on the card. An entertaining match which had solid wrestling all the way through.

Rating 7/10

LAX vs. America's Most Wanted

This was an intense tag team match for the titles which featured plenty of brawling, action, interference (by Konnan/Gail Kim), double-team moves, power moves, intensity and crowd reaction. Right now these are easily TNA's two best tag teams; AMW have been on a roll ever since TNA's inception and LAX receive an unbelievable amount of crowd heat as TNA's most dominant heel tag team. This match had everything a good tag match should have and more. Several times it descended into a free for all with Harris and Storm taking it to Hernandez and Homicide as only they can.

Rating 8/10

I'm going to skip over the Sting/Abyss match in favour of the main event.

Kurt Angle vs. Samoa Joe

The question most people might ask is could they live up to the hype? Although you shouldn't expect an Angle/Benoit classic, the TNA fans were completely into this match. It had plenty of pre-match tension which made their feud both intense and exciting. Angle's entrance was stunning as he came out to a big fight atmosphere, closely followed by Joe. The fans cheered for both competitors between their chants of 'This is awesome!' Joe took control in the early going and busted Kurt's head open, by swinging him head first into the guard rail. (Angle obviously bladed). Without spoiling the ending it was a superb match from start to finish, but a little too short.

8167797,2,B000MCIC3S,"Be aware, this review has lots of SPOILERS!!

Some people think that WCW's demise was almost exclusively the result of bad booking by Vince Russo.  The truth is a little more complicated than that, however this ruined show is perfect example of how badly Russo can botch the greatest of ideas.

This show had 3 main problems:

1) After a great tag team match, Jim Cornette decides to strip LAX of the tag team titles because. . . well, he just didn't really like them.  Mind you, LAX were the bad guys and Cornette was supposed to be TNA's voice of reason.  Mix in the fact that LAX just successfully defended the in a great match, and it was no wonder that the audience turned on Cornette and began to boo him for making a dumb call.

2) The match between Angle and Joe was no classic by any stretch of the imagination.  It was like good match in fast forward, there was no feeling out process.  Both men immediately started with their biggest moves and finished the match in record time.  The problem, however wasn't the match.  The problem was that Angle had just jumped from WWE to TNA and the audience was drooling over him.  They loved him and many people who had never watched TNA before were tuning in just to see him.  So, why on earth did decide to make his top good guy act so unprofessionally after the match? By refusing to shake Samoa Joe's hand and refusing a rematch, the audience began to boo Angle.  Their new top dog, who brought legitimacy to TNA by his presence alone, was now getting booed! Now this would be okay if Angle had been in TNA for a year or so and was losing some of his star power, but these fans wanted to cheer him.

To this day, I'm not sure if Angle is a good guy or a bad guy.  Sometimes he acts like a good guy, sometimes he doesn't.  I realize Steve Austin got popular by being a sort of heelish face, but Angle is already popular for his WWE years and his gold medal from the olympics! He's bringing new viewers to TNA just by being there.  Making him a shade of grey is more likely to confuse those new viewers and make them tune out.

3) Abyss won the NWA title on a disqualification.  Okay, at one point in TNA's history it was decided that belts could change hands on a DQ, however that rule was not enforced in so long that we all forgot about it.  Besides, Jarrett frequently got DQed and never lost the belt in the process.  If you're going to bring that rule back TELL US YOU'RE DOING IT FIRST!! We had no idea that rule had been brought back and were ticked off about it.  Further more, where did Sting cross the line that Abyss didn't? The match included ropes and thumb tacks, but the ref didn't see fit to DQ either man for those petty toys.  Jim Mitchell even grabbed the ref and nearly knocked him unconscious at one point, but no DQ there.  Sting shoves the ref for getting in his way, and suddenly that's grounds for disqualification? That seems kinda arbitrary to me.

All in all, this PPV represents Vince Russo's ability to advertise something the the fans really want to see and then surprise us with something completely random that makes no sense in the current continuity.  To paraphrase wrestlecrap's RD Reynolds, watching a Vince Russo show is kinda ordering a pizza and having them give you a newspaper instead.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense and you'll probably never order from that pizza joint again, but he sure fooled you, didn't he?",1178323200,,3414,4.359177215189874
8167798,4,B000MCIC3S,"TNA is a great company. Im a life long WWE fan, but I respect TNA. The X-divison is the best aspect of the show. I just want everyone to know by this fall Rob Van Dam will be Impact bound. His contract expires in WWE soon, so he is diffently sign onto TNA. I bet he'll be the world champion by the end of the year or at least early 2008. Just look at what the did for Christian Cage. WWE shafted him but WWE fans loved him, TNA made him a world champion. I know more WWE wrestlers will follow, do the easy schedule. One quick question: Kurt Angle was a Hogan like Acquisition. What did TNA do? They gave fans a dream match that didn't live up to standards, then gave him a title shot, and now in a feud with past his prime Scott Steiner. What will they do with RVD or any other talent for that matter?",1172707200,4,801,3.981366459627329
8167799,4,B000MCIC3S,"This PPV was the first PPV under the Vince Russo era & it surpassed the Bound For Glory event on so many levels.  Storylines progressed, there were plenty of suprizes, and a main event worthy of the hype it recieved.

Preshow: Eric Young vs. Robert Roode - This was just a short match between the two in which Roode cheated in the end to win but the referee restarted the match after the fans told him he cheated  in which Young pulled off a quick win & the crowd denied that Young cheated...when he did.  This began the Ms. Brooks/Eric Young storyline which would go on for the next couple of months.

Voodoo Kin Mafia vs. Serotonin - This was just an opener for VKM to mock DX & being their ""mission"" against DX & Vince McMahon.  Afterwards, it was revealed that Raven was the leader of the Serotonin group.

Jay Lethal & Sonjay Dutt vs. The Naturals - The Naturals were in full heel mode here and delievered a solid matchup with Lethal & Dutt.  Good match overall.

X Division Champion Christopher Danials vs. Chris Sabin - Sabin was always one of the most underrated X division stars but now he's got a cocky personality to make him standout above others.  This was one of the best matches of the night with solid inring work & not the ""car crash"" high spots that have sterotyped the X divison. The finish also helped further the Lynn/Sabin storyline as well & play a role later in the night as well with AJ Styles saving Daniels in this match.

Lance Hoyt & Ron Killings vs. Austin Starr & Alex Shelly - This was just a filler match to further the storyline of Shelley being jealous of Kevin Nash's favoritism towards Austin Starr which was apparent in the end when Shelley ended up losing the match trying to showoff for Nash.  It's just said that Ron Killings & Lance Hoyt (who's very athletic for his size) were nothing more than a filler tag team to further a storyline between two other wrestlers.

AJ Styles vs. Christian Cage - It's disappointing that these two wouldn't go on for a longer fued after this because this match went really well.  Second best match of the night as their different styles meshed well together.  The ending of this match came when Daniels tried to save AJ like he did earlier in the night but it backfired which helped set up the AJ Styles/Rhino fued for the next upcoming months.

NWA World Tag Team Champions  LAX vs. America's Most Wanted - Solid tag team match between the two teams but it was a little short to turn into something memorable & the bigger picture at the end of the match was Jim Cornette saying that LAX were stripped of the tag team titles to which the fans were very vocal about...in a negative way.

NWA World Heavyweight Champion Sting vs. Abyss - I was expecting to see Sting to do his usual stops throughout this match but Sting stepped it up in this match the way he should have at Bound For Glory.  There was a mix of brawling & in the ring action before it went hardcore with Sting even landing shirtless on tacks harder & stiffer than than Ric Flair got it in ECW months earlier.  However, when Sting absolutely loses his mind is when the match goes downhill.  He beats Abyss down, hangs him & beats him with his bat before putting him through barbed-wire boards...all of which took a while to set up each spot.  Sting ended up getting disqualified & Abyss wins the NWA Title due to a rule that has been around since TNA started up but people forgot about it because alot of the TNA title matches in recent years don't end with the champions getting disqualified or counted out.  It's something that ""traditional"" wrestling fans don't like & don't agree with.

Kurt Angle vs Samoa Joe - The match was a disappointment in most people's eyes because they were expecting the type of dream match Angle had with Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania 21 in which they put on a 30 min. rollercoaster of a wrestling clinic.  However, this heavily resembles Angle's WrestleMania 22 match in which it didn't go long (less than 15 mins.) but in that entire time, they went high impact & there wasn't a slow moment which left you wanting more as Joe's undefeated streak came to an end.  The crowd was heavily into it & the aftermath guarenteed that you would get a rematch.

In the end, this PPV delievered quality matches & had a main event that that wasn't a wrestling clinic but an enjoyable intense rollercoaster of a match.  I would recommend for a viewing.",1172707200,7,4413,4.468827930174563

Sabin/Daniels was one of the better X Division Matches of the year and Chrisitan/AJ had a really nice little match, they blended well together. I thought the feud with Rhyno was kind of random but after seeing this it makes sense. And Sting vs Abyss is being very slept on, awesome effort by both men, I thought it was a hard fought and very brutal match with a different ending that we don't normally see.",1172188800,2,579,4.2727272727272725
