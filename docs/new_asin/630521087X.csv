986582,3,630521087X,"Well....let's start with the 3 stars. John Barrymore for all his hamminess,was an actor of his time. ( i.e. ""everybody looks hammy"",there was no sound to emote a characters feelings in the silent era. ). Even Lon Chaney Sr. was a victim of scenery chewing. So,you have to see beyond that,first and foremost. The fact that this version of ""Dr. Jekyll"" uses the new process that eliminates all the silent film flaws,such as unscripted black outs,and cartoony movements,is a big bonus. It's a good movie,though a bit long winded,at times,by today's standards.
And now the bad bits,or where the missing 2 stars went:
1) The title cards are not complete originals,they go from decorative,to semi-decorative,to added in at a much later date.

2)The ""music"" score for this version is an absolute joke. A monkey on a caliope would've scored it better. Half of the music is nowhere near correct for the scenes.( Try to imagine a wind up jewelery box,playing during one of Dr. Jekyll's murderous rages.).I've heard a live organ accompaniment to this film,and this DVD version,isn't it.
3) The ""extras"" are nothing more than a ""feeble"" interactive quiz,a picture of a lobby posters,and a ""trailer"". ( Although I'm not sure they had film trailers in the 1920's.)
If you MUST have this film,the price is right,but by all means turn down the sound and put on your own choice of ""scarey music""....or a collection of music boxes if you like it that way.",1067126400,5,1437,4.865306122448979
986583,4,630521087X,"This film was originally done in 1920 with John Barrymore (one of the classic monster actors) in this adaptation of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic.  It is a silent movie, but this production by Kino Video is well put together.
Many silent films that have been converted to video bring with them the hiss and pop of the old movies.  They also bring in the various elements that keep you from having a clear picture of the action.  This is not one of those.  There is no hiss.  The music of the organ is very clear and fits the movie.  You still have the floating element, but just enough to give you the feel of an old movie.  Some of the backgrounds for the words don't seem to be consistent, but the story is not hampered at all.
The transformation from Jekyll to Hyde is on screen.  It may seem too easy in the day of the ""Terminator"" movies, but back then, this was cutting edge.
At the end of this edition is an old nickelodeon version done in 1911.  It does seem choppy (and the notes before the movie explain why), but it is still an interesting story.  There is also an excerpt from the 1920 silent film by a competitor company.  When you watch the transformation scene here, you will appreciate the one with John Barrymore.
For horror fans who love watching the terror staples, here is another must-see.",1015891200,12,1315,4.4149377593361
986584,4,630521087X,"Robert Louis Stevenson cranked out finely plotted, freshly original stories like clockwork. He was the Stephen King of his time and, like King, excelled at horror. John Barrymore was perhaps the most famous stage performer of his time. Known more today as Drew's grandfather and at the end of his short life, a sad alcoholic reflection of his former charisma. In this terrific 1920 version of ""DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE,"" Barrymore's early brilliance is showcased in this first great American horror film that holds its own in the 21st century. In fact, it even has an enhanced, eerie period feel that amps up the dangerous and ill-fated experiment by the curios doctor who discoverz the shadow side of civilization and self. The Mont Alto Orchestra delivers a fine score and the DVD bonus material features a rare 1909 audio recording of the transformation scene, a 1925 one-reel parody starring a goofy Stan Laurel, an excerpt from a rival 1920 version and more.",999820800,12,962,4.9079754601226995
986585,4,630521087X,"It may be surprising to audiences with modern movie-going sensibilities, given both the absence of well-established genre conventions and the obvious limitations imposed by the absence of sound, that most of the more prominent early movies of genre interest are rather good. The 1920 version of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, directed by John S. Robertson, for example, remains a solid entry among the many film versions of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic tale, arguably only eclipsed by Rouben Mamoulian's 1932 version starring Fredric March (mainly because of the latter's unintentional comedy). John Barrymore, originating the role of the ill-fated gentleman doctor and his beastly alter ego, is on top form, overcoming the limitations of silence with some superb physical character work. Proving the adage rather early though that Hollywood only knows about four good stories, at least six more versions of the story would be filmed before the advent of sound in 1928.",981417600,5,965,5.313725490196078
986586,4,630521087X,"Barrymore's stunning metamorphosis from kindly Dr. Jekyll to hideous Mr. Hyde is remarkably amazing in that he accomplished the effect largely through acting technique - because of that fact, he was justly proud of this performance.

I enjoyed watching John as he did his magnificant transformations from good to evil. I was also very impressed to see that  John Barrymore didn't use any makeup or cosmetic help for the first time he  turned into Mr. Hyde. Instead, he messed up his hair and bulged his eyes.

986588,5,630521087X,"Brilliant adaptation of Stevenson's short story. While not true to the book, it maintains enough elements to be recognizable. Barrymore is fantastic. His transformation into Hyde is spine-tingling and completely  realistic, especially considering that it is initially accomplished without  makeup.
The worst part of this film is having to watch Martha Mansfield  attempt to act. She's not very good at emoting ala Kevin Costner, which is  a very unfortunate drawback in silent films.",941587200,6,483,5.575342465753424
986781,4,630521087X,"An early silent film version of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic tale about the duality of man, as an idealistic young doctor (John Barrymore) attempts to give free rein to his baser nature without tarnishing his soul by developing a serum that will embody his id in a separate being.

Barrymore gives an extraordinary performance.  His transformation into Mr. Hyde is accomplished largely without any special effects, and the result is a truly loathsome character.  This is not the powerful brute that Edward Hyde is portrayed as in so many other adaptations, but a slimy character that inspires disgust in all who see him.  As such, he is truer to the films subtext as a metaphor for drug and alcohol addiction.  The story is very familiar to us, although I suppose it would have been much fresher at the time of the films release in 1920, but it clips along at a good pace.",1460764800,,876,4.699346405228758

986785,3,630521087X,"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a 1920 silent film from the 1886 Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-94) novella. The idea of the split personality was popular in the late 19th Century as the rise of Psychiatry brought into question the Victorian values.

Stevensons book spawned dozens of films beginning as early as 1908 and continuing into the 21st Century. The most famous versions (in addition to this one) were the 1931 version (Frederic March winning an Oscar) and the 1941 version (Spencer Tracy) along with the 1953 comedy Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (played by Boris Karloff).

John Barrymore (1882-1942) stars in the 1920 film. He was one of the greatest theatrical performers of the 20th century, but many of his screen performances are not nearly as powerful, and this is particularly true of his work in the talkies. In films like Romeo and Juliette (1936) and Twentieth Century (1934), which were essentially filmed plays, we get to see what theater goers saw, but in more dynamic vehicles like Rasputin and the Empress (1932) and Dinner at Eight (1933), much of Barrymores charm and charisma are missing. But here in this silent film his skills are fully in view. Moreover he is at the peak of his physical abilities.

The NY Times called it special and extraordinary and calls Barrymores performance flawless and one of pure motion-picture pantomime on as high a level as has ever been attained by anyone. However they said the production, is uninspired and it bears the unmistakable stamp of the motion-picture mill.

Among horror films of the silent era, this one certainly rates viewing. My top films are Nosferatu (1922), The Phantom of the Opera (1925), The Fall of the House of Usher (1928), The Hands of Orlac (1924), Un Chien Andalou (1929), The Unknown (1927), The Golem (1920), and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919).

I prefer the 1931 version with Frederic March, but Barrymores performance is well worth watching, and the special effects are effective for 1920",1445212800,,1999,4.902366863905326

986917,4,630521087X,"Opening title card: In each of us, two natures are at war - the good and the evil.  John The Great Profile Barrymore has the starring role in this 1920 adaption of Robert Louis Stevensons familiar classic.

The benevolent Dr. Jekyll is a philanthropist and idealist whose morals leave little doubt about his outstanding character.  Only Sir George Carew (Brandon Hurst) is skeptical.  He persuades Jekyll to visit a London Music Hall and introduces him to Miss Gina (Nita Naldi).  Jekyll rebuffs her advances and leaves; his baser nature has woken.  He searches for a way to separate the two natures.  How to yield to every evil impulse yet leave the soul untouched?

This 78 minute long early horror movie led me to ponder my evil side.  What would be the trigger mechanism that would lead me on the road to perdition?  Drugs, alcohol, greed, envy, an intense and deep hatred for Oakland Raider fans?  The quality was adequate considering the films age and the music was good.  Great art work on the title cards.  Excellent transformation scene and Mr. Hydes makeup gets more devilish each time.

Ive seen it several times and always enjoyed it.  Bonus stuff: Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pride, a Stan Laurel spoof; excerpt from another silent Jekyll/Hyde; audio from a 1909 78RPM record of Jekyll/Hyde; essay about Jekyll/Hyde; info about the music score.

986918,3,630521087X,"I would actually give 4/5 for the movie, John Barrymore does a great job as both Jekyl and especially Hyde, but I would only give 2/5 the new ""remastering"" for this blu-ray release. Does not look much better than my old dvd version. Obviously some work has been done on it but compared to most other Kino ""remasterings"" ( Metropolis, The Penalty et al) it hardly looks touched, very scratchy, I was very disappointed.",1405209600,2,417,4.648648648648648
986919,5,630521087X,"There have been several cinematic releases of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but this edition with John Barrymore in the leading role is my favorite. True, the use of lighting, the detailed sets, the convincing actors by the others, the cinematography (with those wide shots making the close ups so powerful) and choreography shine all at once, but Barrymore really is superb in his ability to transform himself from good-natured scientist and philanthropic physician Jekyll to the monstrous Mr. Edward Hyde. Although Barrymore had the aid of prosthetic fingers his facial contortions and body language, for example, show just how hard he worked to turn himself into Hyde. Moreover, Barrymores crazy stare and the way he smiled as Hyde delighted in doing evil impressed me greatly! I should also add that there are two main editions of this filmone from Kino that is slightly shorter (by about five minutes) and one from Image. The Kino edition has the orchestral score (as opposed to the organ score by Image) as well as the bonus features Amazon mentions above. Nevertheless, big fans of this movie may actually want both editions since the Image edition has the organ musical score instead of Kinos orchestral score and Image does, after all, give you the five or so missing minutes of footage.

When the story begins we quickly meet Dr. Jekyll, a progressive scientist who is relatively young and very generoushe operates a medical clinic at his own expense so that the poor have a place to go when they are suffering and ill despite the fact that they cannot pay for medical care. (Remember, this takes place way before social welfare programs came along.) Jekyll has his eyes on the beautiful and youthful Millicent Carewe (Martha Mansfield) who plays her role to perfection as a lady indeed!

One night Jekyll cannot make it to dinner at Millicents fathers home although he does arrive in time to greet Millicent as a gentleman, bowing slightly when he sees her and kissing her handbut it isn't long before the men talk alone amongst themselves while the women are outside in the living room. Millicents father, Sir George Carewe (Brandon Hurst), begins to argue with Jekyll that he is missing out on lifes pleasures by being a little bit too pure! (Youd think a potential father-in-law to be wouldnt mind potential a son-in-law to be like Jekyll but thats another story.) At any rate, George and his friends including conservative scientist Dr. Lanyon (Charles Lane) and Edward Enfield (Cecil Clovelly) convince Jekyll to accompany them to a club that isn't exactly all that respectable for its time (although what goes on there would be considered tame by todays standards) and Jekyll can hardly contain himself when the beautiful and seductive Italian dancer Miss Gina (Nita Naldi) essentially throws herself at him.

All of this leads Jekyll to work tirelessly day and night until he discovers a druga liquid potionthat can essentially enable him to do evil deeds while keeping the soul intactor so he thinks at first. The transformation scenes when Jekyll becomes Hyde and vice versa are excellent; as I stated above John Barrymore does this brilliantly.

Of course, the rest of the film shows how everything plays out for Jekyll/Hyde, Millicent and her father and the others, too. I won't write much more for fear of spoiling it for you (just in case you haven't watched this film yet) but suffice it to say that Hyde certainly becomes quite a monster! Look also for solid performances by Louis Wolheim as the music hall proprietor and George Stevens as Poole, Jekylls butler. Edgard Var&egrave;se plays a policeman and J. Malcolm Dunn has an uncredited role as John Utterson.

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde starring John Barrymore is a fine example of the early American horror silent film genre; film buffs and fans of the actors in this movie will want this for this collections. Of course, whether you choose the Kino version, the Image version or even both is up to you. I would, however, stay away from copies of this film made by other companies that may be not quite up to par.",1397088000,,4086,4.856527977044476
986920,4,630521087X,"As much as I love this movie, Kino's Blu-Ray edition is a textbook example of how high end resolution does not always benefit older movies especially when they haven't been restored. Of the many different versions of this title that I have seen from the 1999 Image edition to the 2001 Kino edition to this one, it is this one that most clearly shows the defects of the existing print. While some backgrounds are better defined so are the flaws. The missing footage from the first Kino edition has been incorporated here from 16mm footage and while it's good to have it, it looks worse than it did in the old Image edition thanks to Blu-Ray and HDTV resolution. I haven't seen the 2014 DVD version but I imagine it's pretty much the same. As someone who has the other versions I wish that an upgrade of the Image edition were possible combined with the fine Mont Alto score. However as this is the only Blu-Ray edition it will have to do until another comes along which won't be anytime soon.

The film itself is one of the glories of early silent cinema. John Barrymore is 38 here and was shootng this in Paramount's Astoria Studios during the day while performing Shakespeare's RICHARD III at night. On closer examination there are similarities between Hyde's mannerisms and those traditionally associated with Richard. Even the costume and posture Barrymore uses link the two together. Brandon Hurst's Sir George Carew borrows heavily from Oscar Wilde's Lord Henry in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY even having actual lines of Wilde's (""the only way to get rid of Tempatation is to yield to it"") incorporated into the title cards. Nita Naldi's Gina, Louis Wolheim's proprietor, and the tragic Martha Mansfield's Millicent add to my enjoyment. There are the Frederic March and Spencer Tracy versions and several later color ones (including two from Hammer Films and one from Amicus) but when I want to see DR JEKYLL & MR HYDE, this is the one I watch.",1393113600,6,1948,4.729411764705882
986921,5,630521087X,"The first important horror film originated in Germany with Robert Wiene's 1919 expressionistic masterpiece, THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI. In America, the horror genre's roots stem from a classic piece of literature, Robert Louis Stevenson's DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE. The story, about a noble scientist's attempt to expel the evil inclinations within the human soul, was the subject of a number of short films since the earliest days of cinema. In 1920, it was adapted into a feature length production in which the great stage actor John Barrymore had his first major screen role, and is generally regarded as America's first true horror film.

Directed by John S. Robertson, it is a fairly faithful rendition of Stevenson's novel and perfectly captures the period of 19th century London. Barrymore delivers a tour de force dual performance, and his transformation into the malevolent Mr. Hyde is a chilling study in pantomime. As the character degenerates further, Barrymore's features become more hideous, his movements more spider-like as he preys upon his female victims. One of these hapless women is played by the exotic Nita Naldi, who projects a potent eroticism that is enough to tempt the latent, lustful desires of Barrymore's good Dr. Jekyll.

Compared to later versions of the famous tale, this excellent silent classic holds its own and has a grim feeling of decay that the others somehow lack. Much of this is due to Barrymore - he really is creepy as Hyde, and while he did use some makeup, it's mostly through facial and bodily contortions that the characterization was realised. Add Roy Overbaugh's shadowy cinematography, and the final effect is splendidly eerie and atmospheric.

Kino/Lorber's Deluxe Edition Blu-ray has been newly remastered from a 35mm archival negative, and features an appropriately melodramatic music score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. The image quality surpasses Kino's previous DVD, although some minor wear due to age is still apparent. Two brief sections were obtained from a lesser quality source, but this is the only existing material on the footage. The film is presented with tinting that isn't overly saturated. The boost to HD definitely justifies an upgrade, and I enjoy watching DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE even more, what with all the detail clarity I can now see. Even with the physical ravages of time, this Blu-ray is the next best thing to seeing the actual print - which we would expect to contain wear anyway.

Extra features have been bumped over from the DVD: the 1912 Thanhouser version starring James Cruze; a 15 minute excerpt from a 1920 rival version produced by Louis B. Mayer; DR. PYCKLE AND MR. PRIDE, a 1925 parody starring Stan Laurel; and a 1909 audio recording of ""The Transformation Scene.""

986924,5,630521087X,"What is it that hides the baser self from our ordinary, day-to-day reality?  Is it our ignorance that denies such evil exists or is it purity of soul that both accepts and then seeks to quell the monster that lies within ... all of us?

Such a question is posed in 1920's, silent film version of  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde starring the o! so dreamy John Barrymore *be still my beating heart!*

Who hasn't seen one version of this film or another?  I'll spare the play-by-play storyline details and go straight for the jugular *as Hyde does in one incredibly creepy scene.*

This movie could give me nightmares.  The mood of the film is accented by the heaviness of the backdrops, the fog, dim gaslamps accenting poor houses of ill repute, the smoke created by the candle burning on top of Milicent's piano as she plays, opium addicts in the den near where Hyde has chosen to call home in Soho and a handsome face that immediately transforms into black madness without a stitch of make-up or special effects.  This effect is incredibly frightening.

Watching John Barrymore begin his transformation into Mr. Hyde is nothing short of stepping into the mind of a madman ... or a brilliant actor.  Done without make-up, you see/feel the psychological horror of evil overtaking a soul with a single sip of some vile liquid all through the brilliance of John Barrymore's talent.

Equally as creepy is a scene in which Dr. Jekyll, kind and benevolent philanthropist that he is, is sleeping in bed and through 1920's special effects, dreams that a near transparent spider *this totally simulates dreamland* bears down on him and bites his head.

Watch this film if you are into any kind of horror, silent films, incredible acting or stunningly amazing special effects.  You won't be disappointed ... this was my 3rd time in 2 months ...",1354924800,,1826,4.722397476340694

Visually, as in many silent films, it is utterly mesmerising and fascinating in their power, almost like a painting in the Louvre.  It is important for the history of cinema to witness this film.  You get the basic story of Jekyll/Hyde:  a good doctor is tempted to explore his dark side, finds a chemical elixir to bring his id out, and eventually, it takes over completely.

What makes this film so intelligent is the acting with a young Barrymore, the start of a first-rate hollywood dynasty.  In this film, he is in his prime, a handsome young man before he became so disillusioned with life as he in fact did.  I great enjoyed seeing him so young.

Technically, the film is fun.  Hyde is Jekyll, but with an elongated skull and extra joints on his fingers, expertly acted by a character change and plenty of grease.  His girl, Millicent, is strikingly beautiful, in despair at his neglect, first of his mission for good and later as Hyde dominates him - there are themes of infidelity, barroom depravity, and perhaps pregnancy, all controversial to imply, let alone portray.  This film advances all of these themes masterfully and unforgettably.

987059,3,630521087X,"Despite being one of his signature screen roles, John Barrymore's hugely successful 1920 version of Robert Louis Stevenson's oft-filmed tale is far from the definitive one - for that you'd have to see the 1931 Rouben Mamoulian-Frederic March film, which is still striking today. Despite a few moments of censor-baiting child cruelty and sexual exploitation, it's a rather flat adaptation, with Barrymore the main attraction. His Jekyll may be a bit of a milquetoast, but the ham in him knows that Hyde is the real meat-and-potatoes for an actor, and he devours it readily, showcasing his own remarkable makeup-free initial transformation achieved with little more than some expressive scrunching of his own features and some subtle lighting that is extraordinarily successful (later shots of him fully transformed did take advantage of some monster makeup, however). It's a party trick Barrymore repeated, perhaps even more successfully, in a scene in his later Don Juan, but where that had a great film built around it, here the transformations at times feel too much like the whole show. And it's certainly worth the price of a ticket at least once, even if the film itself is distinctly average even for its day.

As one of the most popular Public Domain titles on the DVD market, there's no shortage of truly terrible transfers - most poor prints, often running at the wrong speed, sometimes incomplete and often with hideous and irrelevant scores - so it's worth noting that Kino's Region 1 NTSC DVD release is probably the best version we'll ever get. Aside from a good print at the right speed, it also comes with copious and always relevant extras - an extract from the rival and much cheaper 1920 Sheldon Lewis version of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde that was offered to exhibitors who couldn't afford the more expensive Barrymore version, an early Stan Laurel short film Dr Pyckle and Mr Pride, detailed production notes that are far from the usual PR fluff you get on DVDs as well as a rare 1909 audio recording of a particularly hammy stage version of `The Transformation Scene.'

987060,5,630521087X,"Early silent version of the classic horror tale holds up incredibly well more than eight decades later. John Barrymore is the well-to-do doctor who concocts a serum that allows his dark side to find a home in his alter ego. But how long can this double identity survive before one of the personalities absorbs the other?

DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE works as well as it does thanks in no small part to Barrymore, the early screen legend. His amazing performance transcends the lack of sound, scratchy picture and obvious limitations. He is the definitive Dr. Jekyll and a suitably creepy Mr. Hyde. Barrymore's co-stars more than hold their own, proving that acting is an inherited talent, not something that is necessarily developed through years of schooling. Brandon Hurst in particular stands out as the upperclassman Sir George Carew.

DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE is a 1920 horror silent film based upon Robert Louis Stevenson's novella The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and starring actor John Barrymore.

987062,3,630521087X,"1920 saw two further film versions of Jekyll & Hyde that could not have contrasted more; one polished, thoughtful and kept in period setting; the other a cheap, rushed derivative set in modern America to save money on sets and costumes. The economy class quickie was produced by Louis B. Mayer and featured Sheldon Lewis, best known as the Clutching Hand in many a movie serial such as The Perils of Pauline (1915). Sheldon's Hyde was described in the film's sub titles as ""An Apostle of Hell"" who begins his life of debauchery by snatching a passing lady's purse.  Hyde's dastardly doings do get a little more ambitious, eventually earning him a date with the electric chair. But, as he fries, the trusty Thank-God-it-was-a-Dream cop out kicks in and Jekyll wakes up declaring ""I believe in God! I have a soul..."" The film closes with Jekyll safely escorting his fiancee to the opera

The audiences of 1920 could only be thankful for Paramount Pictures and their more seminal adaptation starring John Barrymore as both noble Jekyll and a very spider like Hyde. Screenwriter Clara Beranger expanded the romantic element by doubling Jekyll's sweetheart, Millicent, with a lust interest for Hyde; a sultry Italian temptress called Miss Gina whom Hyde shacks up in a Soho apartment and slowly sucks dry of all vigour - the spider and the fly. This externalisation allowed the sexual themes of the story to come more into the foreground and placed the hero between two woman who present different lures. On the one hand, there is the upper class virgin who is only sexually obtainable through the propriety of marriage. She is mirrored by the the lower class woman of easy virtue who exists in the dark underbelly of society; an area which a man like Jekyll would be seen to eschew, but in which Hyde positively revels.

The writer was also able to dispense with the customary Thank-God-it-was-a-Dream ending that afflicted previous screen outing and present Jekyll & Hyde as a real story. Beranger's revisionist structure actually owes more to The Picture of Dorian Gray than Stevenson's tale, particularly in the introduction of Jekyll's amoral mentor Sir George Carewe played by Brandon Hurst. The character of Miss Gina also owes some inspiration to Sibyl Vane, an actress who is seduced by Dorian Gray and later commits suicide. But Beranger's approach became the most well known interpretation of the Jekyll & Hyde story and also provided the model for the cinema's first sound take on the story in that followed in 1932, again courtesy of Paramount.",1231977600,6,2552,4.930232558139535

To see the heartthrob of the 20's with his dashing good looks to suddenly turn into a pretty scary looking creature was very unexpected to me!

True, Mr. Barrymore relied mostly on his eyes and the evil grin to ""get across his point"" as Mr. Hyde, but it works!!!

It was in terrible condition, as I assumed it would be for such an old movie, but the darkness and the graininess of the film just added to the horror of it completely!  I have seen many, many versions of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde but when I saw this version, it scared me to the core!  Now I understand why John Barrymore was considered a classic actor of his time.

987064,5,630521087X,"By the year 1920, there'd already been several different film versions of the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novella centered around duality. However, John Barrymore's take, directed by John S. Robertson, would become the best known silent adaptation of the tale. This was the one that put several plot devices on the map. For instance, it introduced the good girl, bad girl dichotomy that mirror Jekyll and Hyde's sense of desire for the pure and profane. It wasn't taken too far in this version but become more developed in the definitive 1931 Rouben Mammoulien version starring Fredric March. One element it did add which did not remain was a sort of Dorian Grey touch involving Jekyll's fiancee's father.

  Dr. Henry Jekyll, as opposed to the fifty year old private chemist portrayed in Stevenson's original, is here reimagined as a young and idealistic philanthropist who works late hours tending to the sick in his ward. His fiancee's father, Sir George Carewe, a more worldly man, tempts him by taking him to an ""not respectable"" bar where eyeing the women, especially a dancer played by Nita Naldi. He is inspired by the proposition of freeing man's baser nature from his more pure one. And, with that, he concocts a very potion that unleashes Edward Hyde, here seen as a spidery and disgusting manifestation of Jekyll's lower instincts.

  Hyde now indulges in all the pleasures he could not as Jekyll. However, the path of illicit pleasures soon leads to destruction as Hyde ruins the lives of whomever he comes into contact with, and eventually commits murder. Even so, Jekyll also loses control when the transformations become involuntary, and he goes to sleep as the doctor but awakens as Hyde.

  Many of the adaptations depict Hyde's growing evil in various ways. Here, its particularly interesting as Hyde's evil is represented in two, but comprehensive aspects. For instance, Hyde is pictured, as previously mentioned, like a spider, with pointed albino head, and elongated fingers; literally ""creeping up"" on his victims. The effects of his evil are metaphorically portrayed as disease-like; contagious and infecting all of his victims. This is made more clear on the DVD essay accompanying the movie which says the film was making subtle comparisons of Hyde's evil power with syphilis, which had been a horrible disease famous in the latter part of the 19th century, and still very much so at the time the film was released. Hyde's victims appear pale and weak with dark circles under their eyes much like those infected with syphillis. Hyde even goes so far to compare one fresh faced girl of the night he plans for his own amusement, to another he's already made use of and left behind who is now worn and sickly. Jekyll himself begins displaying signs of the sickness with dark circles under his eyes. Therefore, Hyde is a spider-like ogre carrying disease and vampirically draining the life force from his victims, including Jekyll (in a famous dream montage, Hyde is pictured as a giant spider crawling on top of Jekyll and sucking the life out of him; this causes Jekyll to change to Hyde).

  This is but one theme of the film, though. There is enough of the classic story for everyone to recognize. Disease metaphors aside, Hyde goes onto become quite a brutal killer. He beats one victim pretty severely with a walking stick, and stomps over a young child, both clearly echoing Hyde's brutality in the novel.

  John Barrymore, though pretty over the top by today's standards, gives a bravura performance as Jekyll/Hyde, even going so far as to portray much of the first half of the transformation with no make-up. More would indeed be added later on. He would use the Hyde make-up later on in life for practical joke purposes for which he was legendary. The rest of the supporting cast is quite good, especially the fiancee's father, Sir George Carewe, played by Brandon Hurst who helps lead Jekyll down his dark ""Dorian Gray"" like road. And, more would be made of the good girl/bad girl staple in later films, but it clearly marks a turn in adding a sexual motivation for, and component of, Hyde's evil. The film was one of the first horror movies, and is a classic staple of the 1920's silent pictures.",1191888000,7,4234,4.8774373259052926

987153,5,630521087X,"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde has long been hailed as a classic by critics and audiences alike, both the story itself and the classic with John Barrymore. The film was made in 1920 and is truly a silent film as the only noise in the whole film is the theatre organ. It is of course designed as a suspense/horror film and although the scares are mostly psychological, it is definitely a classic in the horror genre. This was one of the very first Jekyll and Hyde films preceded only by the 1911/1912 version starring famed director James Cruz; there was also ""Januskopf, Der"" also in 1920 but released in the UK and probably without the appropriate rights as was ""Nosferatu"" by the same director. And of course the third 1920 film with Sheldon Lewis that seems to get few accolades and is normally mentioned so people can get the good version with Mr. Barrymore. This version was directed by John S. Robertson and is definitely the best portrayal of the Robert Louis Stevenson story I have seen thus far.

The classic story line is of course known by many. Dr. Jekyll, a kind and decent paragon of society starts experimenting with various potions, and hits upon one that turns himself into a fully realized personification of his dark side. The person Jekyll holds responsible is the father of his beloved Millicent, whose cynical nature opens the door to his baser instincts and his fascination with the dual personality. Despite my familiarity with the story the script was very unpredictable right up to the ending, it was very difficult to tell what was going to happen next which for a silent film is remarkable. This is often considered the first US horror film, and even though the ""scare"" factor is not necessarily there..... the film is ungodly creepy which is normal of older horror films as they played more on suspense than sheer terror. I think this film ranks up there with the original ""house on haunted hill"" as one of the best suspense films of all time. The creep factor is very evident especially in some of the later scenes, and John Barrymore does an amazing job of doing Hyde with no facial makeup which in my opinion makes this the best treatment of the story. The basic concept of the story is a split personality so Hyde being a grotesque mockery of Jekyll's appearance versus an entirely different creature as in later films, stays truer to that concept. It also makes one get downright chills after the transformation. The only downside of this film is the soundtrack which seems to have no bearing on the events of the film at all and would best be described as church organ wankery, although even with this the quality of the film was not detracted from too much. Hopefully it will eventually get a new soundtrack such as ""Nosferatu"" did--but due to the fact the organ is the only sound, if I require sound next time I watch it I will just gather some classical music together. This film is difficult to watch for someone from the generation of talkies--I am quite used to older films, but silent films especially one such as this with very few title cards requires full 100 percent attention as it is very easy to miss things, and I did not realize until watching this film how often I space out for a minute or so. This fact shows how good a film it is, as once resigned to full attention you find yourself wanting to keep that full attention. This story is riveting and is much like reading a book as there are many things left to the imagination as there is much action and dialogue between the characters; but there are not title cards for all the dialogue. I found myself extrapolating and imagining what the actors were saying either based on the visuals or the title cards that have been displayed. Even though it may be difficult for the talkies generation, there are a wealth of silent films and any horror buff needs to see this to understand what the beginning of horror filming was like.

The star of this film is of course John Barrymore, whose acting is a standout among all the other principles in this film, through his grimace and general creepy way of moving as Hyde his is a standout performance above all the rest, and even though it is surprising that he is the only one of his siblings that has never been nominated or won any awards it is not surprising that he is now known as the best actor out of all of them. I will be honest, other than Martha Mansfield's depiction of Millicent, Jekyll's fianc, none of the other actors were particularly noticeable in their roles. Ms. Mansfield's emotions and acting as she grew more and more concerned about her fianc were a delight on the screen and as she had very few displayed lines on screen almost everything with her part was done visually. As for the other actors everyone did a decent job at their role but no one really stood out on an acting level.

The photography of this film was very basic, partially due to the time and also I believe the direction. There are many wide shots in the film, that jump to close-ups which make the actions very effective. There were very few heavy close-ups although there were some, it seemed as if they went out of their way to avoid any strong close-ups of Mr. Hyde--in some case the shot would widen out on his transformation, which was also a good illustration of how painful that transformation was. As disturbing as Mr. Hyde's appearance is, I am glad there are not any extreme close ups of his vile countenance. The other main  aspect I noticed was the film started out very light, and near the end of the film there were more and more low key scenes, leading up to the finale. And in regards to Millicent; most if not all of the shots that involve her are high key lighting, which further magnifies her character's virtuousness on the audience.

All in all my silent film experience was excellent, and I am glad that I picked one that was completely silent excluding the church organ. It was a very good film, and the comparisons between a silent film and reading a book are many. There is much more room for imagination on films such as these and due to the silent nature you cannot turn around or space a section as you can miss quite a bit. There is a large focus on characterization and acting as a whole--- even though there were few standouts, the actors have to work much harder in a film with no sound and low instances of dialogue to make the film a good watch. The imagination factor comes in on sound effects quite a bit as with this film there are none. Every scream, every hit of the club and every gasp have to be imagined, and for a horror film makes it that much scarier. Just like in older horror films where music is used minimally to focus on the events, having no sound effects at all really puts you in the hot seat as what we imagine is always scarier than what someone else can put on the screen.",1150502400,4,6861,4.4899919935948756

987157,4,630521087X,"Directed by John S. Robertson and starring matinee idol John Barrymore in the dual title role, 1920's DR. JECKYLL & MR. HYDE is sometimes described as the ""first American horror film."" That description is more than a little problematic, but whether it was or it wasn't, DR. JECKYLL AND MR. HYDE certainly put the horror genre on the Hollywood map.

Whether or not you happen to like this particular version of the famous Robert Louis Stevenson tale will depend a great deal upon your tolerance for the change in acting styles that has occurred between the silent and the modern era. Some silent stars--Lillian Gish, Ramon Novarro, and Louise Brooks leap to mind--were remarkably subtle and worked to create a new style of acting appropriate to the screen, but most actors played very broadly. John Barrymore, considered one of the greatest actors of his day, is among the latter, and was noted for his larger-than-life performances on stage. He brings that same expansiveness to the screen, where it inevitably feels ""too big"" to the modern viewer.

At the time, Barrymore's transformation into the evil Mr. Hyde was considered shocking in its realism, but today these celebrated scenes are more likely to induce snickers than thrills--as will much of Hyde's make-up, which seems excessive to the modern sensibility. Even so, there are aspects of the film which survive quite well, scenes in which one is permitted a glimpse into the power this film once had. For Barrymore's Hyde is, for all his bizarre ugliness, a remarkably seductive creature--and Barrymore uses his hands and eyes in a remarkable way. One feels the sexual pull as much as one feels the revulsion.

The 1920 DR. JEKYLL & MR. HYDE is available in several VHS and DVD releases. Some of these are quite good, but I particularly recommend the Kino version, which offers a good picture, good soundtrack, and several interesting bonuses. Other release versions should be approached with caution, and you should avoid releases by the likes of Alpha or Madacy as you would the plague. They may seem attractive in terms of price, but frankly... in this instance you get what you pay for.

987158,4,630521087X,"In this 1920 silent film version of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic horror story ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" John Barrymore shows why he was considered one of the greatest actors of his generation (a reputation that is not especially enhanced by what little of his film work remains from this period of his career). Pay attention to how little makeup or effects Barrymore uses to make his transformation from the genteel Dr. Henry Jekyll into the monstrous Mr. Hyde, because basically he just greases up his hair and goes bug-eyed.  In otherwords, it is a lot more acting than it is makeup (although the longer fake fingers helped).  I know Spencer Tracy wanted to do the same sort of thing when he played the role decades later, but he was not allowed to do so by the studio, leaving the approach to Barrymore.

Ironically, it is as Dr. Jekyll, horrified by what he has become because of his grandiose experiments, that is the stronger half of Barrymore's performances because it successfully conveys his character's torment. In both cases you can tell this was an actor trained for the classical stage, even if you cannot hear what he is saying. Martha Mansfield plays Millicent Carew, the good doctor's beloved, while Nita Naldi plays Miss Gina, the Italian dance-hall singer who first wakens the savage Mr. Hyde.  The film is fairly faithful to Stevenson's novella, but clearly the idea is to showcase Barrymore. This version also turns Sir George Carew (Brandon Hurst) into something of a villain, since it is his venality at a dinner party that prods Jekyll onto the road to damnation (I think the writers had read Oscar Wilde as well as Stevenson).  The film is a bit slower at the start, mainly because of the title cards necessary to get across the exposition on how Jekyll wants to have his cake (experience the sensations he desires) and eat it too (but keep his soul pure).

This silent version of the film is of more importance from a historical standpoint than from an artistic standpoint once you get past that impressive first transformation scene, since Barrymore gave the American horror film some much needed legitimacy by playing this part (Keep in mind that Lon Chaney was still five years away from making ""The Phantom of the Opera""). WARNING: This is one of two 1920 versions of ""Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"" produced in 1920.
