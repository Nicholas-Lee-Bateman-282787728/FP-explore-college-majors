8281963,3,B001B60Y8U,This low-budget movie and not the best nor worst.  It could have been Block Party Mess.  Not really worth buying.  I viewed it once and it went to my wall of DVD deaths.,1367798400,,169,4.0606060606060606
8281964,3,B001B60Y8U,"It was a big improvement from part 2!! If you watched that one you know what I mean, one question, how is AJ related to both CJ (from part 2) and BJ (from part 1)?! They don't even acknowledge CJ's character in this movie, they say BJ is in jail!! The acting is still bad especially George Boyd!! I recommend it if you watched the first two!!!!",1347926400,,344,4.149253731343284
8281965,3,B001B60Y8U,"This was a funny movie by all means, but the original is the best, the second fell off alot, and this one was trying too hard to be like the first Block Party.  If you saw the first one it brought back Action Jackson which was the reason the first was sooooo funny but like I said this movie tried too hard to be like the first and over exaggerated in some things.  Overall BP3 made me laugh definitly way more than the second, but if this is the first Block Party you see it will be a five star for someone else.",1254182400,,513,3.970873786407767
