I somehow expected more than a short grainy copy of a USNavy training film (warbly sound, flickering dust/fuzz on the lens and all) followed by a short, grainy silent 1950's B&W home movie of ""escape and evasion"" consisting of repeated scenes of naked GIs jumping into a cold ice and snow filled creek and doing naked push ups in the snow... and finally by a short 80's vintage disconjoined flick of the new base and some Marines in training.  This stuff is all ""public domain"" videos and, I believe, not worth the $30 price tag! (Plus shipping and tax)

Avoid the disappointment!!  I got much more out of the free YouTube online videos just by googling USMC Mountain Warefare Training Center, Bridgeport CA.  I believe those were History Channel presentations...",1437782400,2,904,4.806451612903226
