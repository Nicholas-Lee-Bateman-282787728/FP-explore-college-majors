4385606,1,B004IB04OE,"As a man in my twenties I had many fond memories of watching it when it first aired.  I had many of the action figures, clothes, and comic books in addition to it being the one show I must watch on Saturday.  I thought it instilled in me a good sense of the environment and how we must be accountable to it.

That said, after revisiting the series via Youtube a few months ago I must confess like many of my boyhood heroes, it has fallen.  Particularly disturbing is the episode in season one entitled ""Population Bomb"" which actually promotes birth control.  Regardless on where one stands on the issue, the fact that a cartoon is taking an active stand on an issue that really should be made by adults seems a bit disturbing.  I know I have no desire for my six-year-old to watch any program that says ""when it is your turn to have a family, keep it small.""  We don't need to have a conversation as how him having a new sister is not going to do irreparable harm on the environment.  Needless to say I don't think this series will be added to the DVD rack at home.",1300492800,12,1066,4.242574257425742
4385607,5,B004IB04OE,"Undoubtedly one of the most popular cartoons of the 90s, this classic is finally making its way to DVD.  Whether you are reliving your childhood or introducing this series to new kids, its sure to become a classic revisited or a new classic for some.

The show featured a Hollywood cast, great stories, music and animation.  A must have for all nostalgic cartoon fans or for those looking to find a quality well told animated series on DVD.",1295222400,2,440,4.615384615384615
4385608,5,B004IB04OE,"Oh my gosh! FINALLY this release comes out. My most memorable moments growing up were watching this show!  The messages I learned through Captain Planet and the Planeteers have never left me- even 20 years later. It was because of this show that I persued a career in environmentalism!! I can only hope that the children of this next, up- coming generation will be as positively influenced as I was.
More children should identify with nature, teamwork, and come together as the original Planeteers did to make a word wide difference.

Being a 26 year old Planeteer myself, I could not be more excited about this!

4385610,5,B004IB04OE,"Visionary then and valid now more than ever. As the first and only eco superhero for the Planet, its great to see entertainment with a timely conscience is back. It should be on television today and perhaps it is somewhere in Mozambique, at 2 a.m. Finally children will begin to understand what is happening to planet earth and some simple things they can do about it. It's kind've amazing the first episode, from twenty years ago, is about an OIL SPILL.",1294876800,22,454,4.617283950617284
4385611,3,B004IB04OE,"As far as superhero cartoons are concerned, Captain Planet will never be remembered as one of the better ones. The show is somewhat entertaining, but unless you happened to have seen the show during your impressionable youth (when we like just about everything we see on TV), I doubt you'll be wanting to buy this DVD set. I was born in 1971, so I was already an adult when I first saw this show, so there's no ""nostalgia factor"" for me in this show. If you're younger than me, you may very well enjoy this show far more than me.

The show's heart is in the right place - it wants viewers to care about the environment. I know I care about the environment - I like clean air, clean water, trees, and animals.

But I sense a certain propaganda in the show. The series seems to be inspired more by inaccurate doomsayers such as Paul Ehrlich and the Club of Rome, while ignoring the more realistic environmental ideas of people such as Julian Simon and Bjorn Lomborg. The truth is that we are not running out of essential resources, landfills only take up a tiny percentage of land, we can desalinize as much clean water as we want for less than 1/5 penny per gallon, food production per capita has been growing for decades, tree farmers plant more trees than they cut down, and the air and water have been getting cleaner and cleaner for decades.

I wouldn't normally point out the errors in a superhero cartoon, except that this one was created allegedly as a form of education.

But the show is somewhat enjoyable to watch, and its heart is in the right place. So even though there's a part of me that wants to hate it for its inaccurate portrayal of environmental issues, I have to admit that there's also a part of me that wants to like it.",1294704000,12,1742,4.400621118012422

Well  I've  been  there  done  that.  &  I've  decided  that  this  cartoon  is  worth  watching  &  enjoying.  Gaya  (Whoopi  Goldberg)  selects  5  teenagers  who  seem  worthy,  smart  &  responsible  enough  for  a  task  at  hand,  investigating  crimes  done  against  nature,  that  threaten  nature.  &  that  must  be  taken  care  of,  that  means  stopping  any  bad  guy  whose  taking  pleasure  for  himself  while  earth  suffers  &  things  are  at  stake.
She  gives  5  kids  rings  containing  different  powers,  Earth, fire, wind, water,  &  Heart.
They're  job  is  to  uncover  the  bad  guys  plot  &  summon  a  true  hero  when  they  combine  powers.  I  like  the  good  guys  &  the  bad  guys  &  captain  planets  jokes  while  he's  in  action  against  their  enemies.
&  I'm  pleased  with  their  tips  at  the  end  of  each  episode.  I  guess  for  children  its  supposed  to  be  kind  of  educational,  the  kind  of  show  that  I'm  sure  even  a  school  teacher  would  show  the  kids  for  a  learning  experience.  Several  yrs.  ago  I'd  get  up  around  5  or  5:30  in  the  morning  &  I'd  watch  this  show.  Gaya  I  think  is  a  good  leader  known  as  the  spirit  of  the  earth,  &  will  alert  them  each  time  there's  a  mission  for  them  to  go  on.  While  the  bad  guys  can  sometimes  temporarily  get  captain  planet  out  of  action,  the  planeteers  must  do  without  their  powers  for  a  little  while,  its  up  to  them  to  use  their  wits  &  their  ideas  &  revive  captain  planet.  A  perfect  way  to  save  the  environment!!

4385720,5,B004IB04OE,"If ever there is one thing most people remember about this show it's the theme song! Captain Planet was a very cool and fun show when I was a kid, and you know what? It's still an awesome and fun show even today! I loved it and I HIGHLY recommend it! It's a shame that this is the only season currently available. The one thing that should have been done with this show that almost all the popular animated shows got was a movie, interestingly IMDb has it listed that one is in the making for this year. Captain Planet is annoying in one area, that being the voice acting, only because some of the characters voices had drastic changes, some for the best, others not. Jeff Goldblum for example, he voiced Verminous Skumm and while his voice totally wasn't how the character should have sounded, it was weird, but it worked, then he was voiced by a different person and sounded just like you would expect, thus making him ordinary rather than unique.

My favorite villains of this show were always Hoggish Greedly, Verminous Skumm (Jeff Goldblum was my favorite person to have voiced him), Sly Sludge was cool too.

4385759,4,B004IB04OE,"After catching this classic show in the 1990's, I thought I'd check out season 1, although I later found out that there are over 4 series left!! 'Captain Planet' is an adventure series which shows people how to look after the environment on earth. A distressed Gaia, mother of the earth (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg) gives 5 elemental rings to 5 chosen young people: Kwami from Africa, Wheeler from Brooklyn, Gi from Thailand, Linka from Russia & Ma Ti from the Amazon rainforest. The rings react when their element is voiced by their owner - such as 'water!' by Gi - to perform helpful magics, and when all 5 of the powers combine to solve a tricky situation, 'Captain Planet' appears - the show's own eco-superhero. Gaia trains up her team of 'Planeteers' on Hope Island, the good guys' HQ.
PACKAGING 4/10
Looked like a budget job, what happened?..all that folded floppy card could have come out of any printer! But the artwork was right on par and the 4 disks looked professional.
ANIMATION 9/10
It's fantasy with a huge eco-twist, characters designed for blokes and gals...you might find yourself skipping some ep's to look for your favourite villains. Nothing has been left out - glowy magic ring effects, DIC's detailed character costumes, snappy dialogue etc...all the things I remember from the original run. Captain Planet himself is great to watch (I don't know what he's made of - diamond?). He narrates a little morale at the end of each episode (that's just before the cheesy end theme song) finishing it with 'the power is yours', meaning the viewer.
MUSIC 8/10
It's pretty funky and helps the viewer come away from the show feeling great. The sfx are nifty too - love the rings' magic sounds.",1341792000,2,1705,4.763513513513513
4385780,5,B004IB04OE,"The 90s always had important morals for those of us who grew up at the time. Probably one of the most influential of these was Captain Planet which taught the importance of saving and helping the environment. Growing up with this show actually taught me how to be the environmentalist that I am now.

Captain Planet follows the adventures of five youths called the Planeteers, each one of a different ethnicity and from a different continent and each one possessing five enchanted rings containing the elemental powers of earth, fire, wind, water and heart. Gaia, the Earth goddess has summoned them to counter attack all the pollution and destruction plaguing earth. When combined, they can summon Captain Planet, a super being with earthly powers and abilities. Captain Planet and the Planeteers use their powers to save the environment and match wits with the nasty eco-villains who want to not just to destroy the world, but make wealth out of their own evil doings.

Captain Planet is a fun show that can help teach both kids and adults the importance of helping the environment. I myself do my part in helping the environment and anyone else can to. We can be Planeteers to.

Here in season 1, we'll witness the Planeteers first receiving their powers, the first appearance of the eco-villains, learn a few things about helping the environment and more.

I was very happy with this and I was very happy with Shout Factory to release this out on DVD. I look forward to season 2.

Here are episodes in Season 1.

1. A Hero for Earth-Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, summons five teenagers from five different corners of the world to help her in the battle to save the planet. For their first assignment, the Planeteers battle Hoggish Greedly, whose oil rig operation is jeopardizing the coastline.

2. The Last of Her Kind-Wheeler plans to buy Linka an ivory necklace for her birthday, but Kwame recommends anything except that for a gift. Meanwhile, Looten Plunder is wiping out the elephant population of Africa, Kwame's native land, in order to gain a quick profit in the ivory trade. Wheeler learns firsthand the true cost of ivory trinkets, as he and the other Planeteers help return a baby elephant to its mother and battle to save the elephants.

3. The Dead Seas-Hoggish Greedly and Rigger scheme to catch and sell all the fish in the ocean with a fleet of illegal drift net fishing boats. When Greedly steals their rings, the Planeteers are forced to use their initiative to retrieve them and save thousands of marine animals from the eco-villains' deadly nets.

4. Pollution by Computer-Sly Sludge, Dr. Blight and her computer, MAL hack into the government's computer system in order to obtain phony legal documents allowing them to change all the national parks into giant toxic waste dumps. In addition, they falsify the criminal records of the Planeteers and cleans up Sly Sludge's background check to make him look like a committed environmentalist.

5. Population Bomb-The Planeteers learn that the world is very overpopulated and some countries try to slow it down. Wheeler soon finds himself on an island inhabited by human-like mice who are having an overpopulation problem of their own.

6. The Ozone Hole-Duke Nukem destroys the ozone layer over Antarctica so he can feast on the sun's dangerous UV rays. Captain Planet and the Planeteers battle to protect the Earth from Nukem's deadly radiation.

8. Rain of Terror-Ma-Ti battles self-esteem issues as the Planeteers try to stop the nasty Verminous Skumm from destroying a city with a giant cloud of acid rain.

9. Volcano's Wrath-The nasty Sly Sludge who claims to have solved the world's problems of waste management by inventing a shrink ray that reduces garbage, is making big bucks by having countries ship their garbage to him for disposal. However, Sludge is secretly only dumping the garbage into a volcano on Laipuno Island. When the volcano erupts, Captain Planet and the Planeteers must save the islanders from the lava flow.

10. Skumm Lord-When Verminous Skumm contaminates the water supplies of South America with a disease known as ""rat rot"", which turns its victims into rat-human hybrids, it's up to Kwame and Ma-Ti to find a cure when the other Planeteers become infected.

11. Deadly Ransom-Dr. Blight and Duke Nukem hold Captain Planet prisoner in Antarctica, demanding that the Planeteers give them a lifetime supply of nuclear waste in return.

14. Littlest Planeteer-A nine-year old named Jason who idolizes the Planeteers steals Wheeler's ring and tries to single-handedly battle Dr. Blight's newly-created smog monster, which feeds on air pollution.

15. The Conqueror-Zarm, a war-like god dazzles the Planeteers into telling them that they can create an environmental utopia on Earth and gets them to follow him instead of Gaia. However Ma-Ti soon realizes that Zarm is not what he seems.

16. The Ultimate Pollution-Looten Plunder sells firearms to two warring villages. It is up to two young from the opposing villages to help the Planeteers stop the destruction.

17. Meltdown Syndrome-When a scientist tries to cover up a radiation leak at a nuclear power plant, Duke Nukem zeros in on the ""hot spot"" and triggers a meltdown. With time running out, Captain Planet and the Planeteers are forced to cool off the reactor before an explosion occurs and contaminates the planet.

18. Don't Drink the Water-Looten Plunder, Dr. Blight, Verminous Skumm and Hoggish Greedly join forces in a plot to pollute a city's water supply so they can sell their bottled water to thirsty citizens at outrageous prices. Captain Planet and the Planeteers set out on a mission to find pure water and break up the ""Pollution Syndicate.""

19. Plunder Dam-Looten Plunder dams an African river and installs a large hydroelectric power plant, cutting off water supplies to the villages. With their crops dying and thirst-crazed elephants on the rampage, they enlist the help of the Planeteers to stop Plunder's terrible scheme.

20. Kwame's Crisis-Sly Sludge is burying a small town under garbage and the townspeople don't seem to care. Feeling he can't make a difference, Kwame leaves the Planeteers, but a young girl's single-handed recycling effort restores his faith.

21. Smog Hog-Greedly hijacks Jane Goodair's environmentally friendly automobile factory in order to manufacture his Road Hog, a smog-spewing nightmare, and city is soon choking on exhaust fumes. When his own son, Greedly Jr., falls ill from the pollution, Greedly must turn to Captain Planet and the Planeteers for help.

22. Mission to Save Earth Part One-The nasty eco-villains succeed in stealing the Planeteers rings and clone the rings into their own evil versions. By combining their diabolical powers, they summon Captain Pollution, an evil counter part of Captain Planet. The Planeteersm while being helpless without their rings meet Commander Clash, a soldier with a cold war mentality.

23. Mission to Save Earth Part Two-The Planeteers befriend Commander Clash and convince him to help them retrieve their rings and battle the awful Captain Pollution.

24. Two Futures Part One-The Planeteers' mission to prevent Dr. Blight and Greedly from travelling back in time to speed up global warming takes a turn for the worse. When Wheeler gets chastized for messing up, he doubts his own worth as a Planeteer. Dr. Blight sweet talks Wheeler into forgetting the Planeteers, and has MAL sent Wheeler back in time and alter his past. Wheeler accepts and convinces his past self to get rid of his Planeeter ring. However, Wheeler is then sent forward in time to the 21st Century, where he sees first hand how his actions end up drastically changing the future.

25. Two Futures Part Two-As Wheeler goes through time when he never became a Planeteer, he soon realizes the consequences. The worse is yet to come when he sees the ravaged future caused by him not being a Planeteer and Captain Planet not existing. Wheeler realizes how much he is needed and goes back to being a Planeteer.",1334534400,3,8628,5.0090845562543675

I watched the first episode so far and fell back in love with it. Or, remembered how much I loved and still love this show! And, the message that comes with it! I didn't even realize it back then and I was an older kid (middle school age). To me, it was just a cartoon to watch and enjoy. I am definitely satisfied with this product! Also, now that I read/saw Whoopi Goldberg was Gaia's voice, I can't go back to innocently thinking of just Gaia. Now, I picture Whoopi! Ha. I love how the message continued onto the package wrapping.

4385786,5,B004IB04OE,"Very few of the views given negative ""criticism"" have actually done so in a productive manner. Complaining about the case has absolutely nothing to do with the series, and complaining about a personal offence to an episode doesn't give an accurate argument covering the whole series.

The series is an environmentalist cartoon about five young people given great gifts to save the world from the careless and destructive actions of Eco-Villans intent on destroying the earth through pollution.

That is what it is about. If you have a complaint it should be about quality (which is excellent), sound (also brilliant, though there is no CC), or problems with the series as a whole, such as editing, voice acting, colouring, etc. Stop spamming this title with your false accounts or personal environmental views. People reading these reviews don't care about anything other than the product they are buying.

The packaging IS made of 100% recycled paper. That was stated in the item description, so why people act shocked when they receive a cardboard case covering housing their DVD's escapes me.

All in all, this is an amazing show! Still relevant (possibly even more so) for today's environmental problems, this show will rekindle the kid inside of you. I have a two year old daughter that absolutely LOVES this show.",1314662400,6,1319,5.036697247706422

The set is well done. Comes in a case that is made from recycled material, this set is nice a slim and fit on your shelf. The design and discs are pleasing. The menus are nice and the features are cool. And then you have the episodes themselves, the beginning of an epic series!

Totally worth purchasing if you want to relive part of your childhood or show your own kids a cartoon that has aged well and is still relevant today! Bring on season 2!",1311033600,,552,4.247619047619048
4385788,4,B004IB04OE,"Okay, there are two reasons I am reviewing this DVD set distributed by Shout! Factory.  One, Captain Planet is a secret unlockable character in the 3DS game ""Cartoon Network Punch Time Explosion"" for reasons seemingly unknown.  And B, I have been recently feeling eco-concious lately, with the fact I recycle more, use less electricty, and things like that, you understand.

The first season of ""Captain Planet and the Planeteers"" has 20 episodes on 4 discs all placed in a very eco-friendly packaging made of recycled material.  These episodes chronicle the adventures of Kwame, Gi, Wheeler, Linka, and Ma Ti as they receive magical rings from the spirit Gaia that not only contain the powers of earth, water, fire, wind, and of course, heart, with their powers combined, they summon the Earth's greatest champion, Captain Planet.  Only he, Captain Planet, has the super powers to put villains that harm the world and its inhabitants in their place.  But the Planeteers have their role in this effort as well; they can help clean up the earth and save the lives of harmed animals and people.  So basically, this series is not only action-packed, it also sends a message to everyone not to litter, use less energy, and be kind to every living creature.

Along with these epic episodes, there are some bonus features like character art galleries and a behind-the-series feature about how this show came to pass.

So if you're like me, i.e. you being a little more kinder to the earth or you own a copy of ""Punch Time Explosion"" and have no idea who this new superhero is, then GET THIS COLLECTION !!!  Trust me, you won't be sorry.  And neither will your environment.",1309392000,3,1666,4.810526315789474

This show is a must buy for all parents who are trying to teach their children how they can benefit the planet.

My only hope and concern, is that they continue to bring the series out for us, I would love to have every single episode of Captain Planet.

Ohh, and I'd love it in the most eco-friendly packaging please!",1303689600,2,730,4.2846715328467155
4385804,3,B004IB04OE,"The true paradox of this show is that what was supposed to be its big selling point - its environmentalist message - is completely garbled and wrong-headed. The environment is being destroyed by things like irresponsible to nonexistent family-planning, insufficient safety measures when transporting (Exxon Valdez) or drilling for (Gulf of Mexico) oil, and worst of all, the insane myth of ""green technology"", which involves such ecologically destructive practices as damming rivers for hydroelectric power and strip-mining for the rare elements needed for solar panels. It's not being destroyed by supervillains with names like ""Hoggish Greedly"" and ""Looten Plunder"" who are all like ""let's destroy the environment just for fun!""

The show accidentally succeeds, though, at being something of a pretty decent Saturday-morning animated drama in its own right if you ignore the environmental propaganda. I particularly remember the episode that explored Wheeler's troubled past. There's also the unbelievable voice cast; at one point or another, LeVar Burton, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeff Goldblum, Meg Ryan, Tim Curry, Sting, Malcolm McDowell, Martin Sheen, and a slew of lesser celebrities (like Margot Kidder of Superman fame) all had major roles on the series, and such celebs as Danny Glover, Mark Hamill, Neil Patrick Harris, Helen Hunt, Ricki Lake (???), Kate Mulgrew, Robert Patrick, Robert Picardo, Vanna White (???), and even Ted Turner himself made guest appearances. Of course, ""Voice God"" Frank Welker, who has voiced everyone from Nibbler on Futurama to Dr. Claw on Inspector Gadget, has his share of voices here, too. In fact, he's one of no less than four (probably more) Transformers alumni who lent their voices to this show, with two other notable examples being Peter Cullen, who voiced Optimus Prime in the original series and live-action movies, and Susan Blu, best-known for voicing Arcee in the original Transformers, reprising her role for Transformers Animated, and being the voice director for Beast Wars, Beast Machines, and Animated.

Anyway, all things considered, this is a fairly decent Saturday-morning animated drama with an all-star cast that accidentally botched the message that it was trying to deliver. All in all, I'd recommend a rental, but it's hard to recommend a purchase unless you're an extreme environmental enthusiast with kids of your own and you'd like them to watch the same episodes over and over.",1303516800,5,2441,5.387434554973822
4385805,3,B004IB04OE,"This is the cheapest and crappiest packaging and case Ive seen a DVD set come in. Its cardboard so thin that it came to me in the mail all torn up practically, also dented pretty badly as well and thats sad because amazon packages their products pretty well. The discs don't even have holders, their just slid in the VERY thin cardboard box right on top of each other and you have to grind the discs against the casing in order to get them out.

I expected way better than this, I mean come on its a GREAT show but that case it comes in makes this a bad buy because its just that bad and the discs are easily damaged. The least they could have done is put it in a better case with disc holders, after all it its only 4 discs and I have seen plenty of 4 disc sets packaged better.

I wanted this show so badly on dvd but now that I seen how it comes packaged, I'm ashamed to have bought it.

Im hoping very much that if they come out with season 2 on DVD that they give it a more appropriate packaging and case.

The show is very good to me and Im very happy to see it on DVD as well, I just wish the packaging was better, so if you don't mind the case, then by all means this is a pretty good buy and a great show!!",1303344000,10,1215,3.8870967741935485
4385806,5,B004IB04OE,"The first episode of ""The Adventures of Captain Planet,"" subtitled ""A Hero For Earth,"" was released in 1990. I have been a planeteer ever since. I even purchased a VHS copy of ""A Hero For Earth"" and ""Mission To Save Earth"" just because I love this show show much!

Now, ALL of Season One of ""The Adventures of Captain Planet"" are in one DVD box set. You get 4 DVD's. You get 26 action packed episodes. Let me explain what ""The Adventures of Captain Planet"" is all about. It is a show made for kids, so it is G rated. You have 5 Planeteers that control 5 different powers (Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, and Heart). When they (the Planeteers) combine their powers, they summon Captain Planet. It is a show meant to teach about saving the Earth. That is the main message of the show: saving the planet because, as Captain Planet always says, ""The Power is Yours,"" and it is!

Now, here are the episodes you get on each disc. Please keep in mind that not all episodes of ""The Adventures of Captain Planet"" have been issued on DVD. This is only Season One, so if you do not see a show title that you want, it is probably in another season that is yet to be released.

4385807,4,B004IB04OE,"...Al Gore, is that you???

Anyway, you obviously can't talk about a DVD of a television series without talking about the show itself at least for a little bit. So, for those who were deprived of television cartoons in the early '90s and weren't aware of this guy, the elemental powers of ""Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart???"" (yeah, sometimes it's best not to ask) worked individually or together. When combined together, along came Captain Planet. CP flew around the world, delivering roundhouse sucker punches to truck drivers and other random polluters and running off the eco-villains with his cheesy jokes (Al Gore takes a similar approach, buzzing around in a HUGE PRIVATE JET to preach about gas consumption and the ozone layer and boring people to tears by opening his mouth).

Anyway, we're not here to discuss Gore. We're here to talk about ""Captain Planet and the Planeteers: Season 1."" Whatever else can be said about the value of the show, Ted Turner over at Turner Broadcasting is owed an enormous amount of credit for revealing to the youth of the world that the Earth will not sustain itself forever unless we all pitch in and help out by cleaning up our own acts first and foremost. So, yes, Ted Turner found an ecologically-friendly soapbox to stand on for six seasons running but, whatever you can say about the cause, the man was commited to it. That being said, love it or hate it, ""Captain Planet and the Planeteers"" was proselytizing at its least subtle geared toward the most impressionable among us: children. Enough about that; lets talk about what made up the show.

The Planeteers: Alongside Captain Planet was the force that summoned him, the Planeteers. The Planeteers were five snotnosed teenagers who were commited to the cause of environmental issues and used their magic rings to clean up assorted global...messes, I guess...caused by pollution. Thankfully, these kids were from different parts of the world (pollution being the world's problem, don't you know?) because that was the only real differentiating factor between them. Oh, and because Ted Turner is oh so very politically correct, the insufferable tool hails from North America (Brooklyn, New York, to be more precise).

The eco-villains: You can't have heroes without villains; it doesn't work. So standing in the way of Cap and the Planeteers was the assorted...um...trash that composed the series' rogues gallery. The Eco Villains, not unlike the heroes, thankfully had different names because that was how you could tell the difference between most of them. Louton Plunder (and Hoggish Greedly and Sly Sludge and...) represented corporations run amok (and some muck) and the pollution caused by being capitalists. Dr. Blight (originally voiced seductively by Meg Ryan) represented science...if science were 100% about contaminating the environment.

Episodes: Season One is the best of the best compared to the drek that this became after Hanna-Barbera took over the project from Dic Enterprises around Season 3 or so. Anyway, Season One offers us such classic memories as (obviously) the premier episode, ""A Hero for Earth"" and both memorable two-parters, ""Mission to Save Earth"" and ""Two Futures."" Along with these episodes came my personal favorites ""Ozone Hole,"" ""Tree of Life,"" ""Last of Her Kind,"" ""Deadly Ransom,"" ""Polluting By Computer,"" and ""Beast of the Temple.""

Special Features: Character Art Galleries and an Interview.

Do not let my snide, snark review of the show itself set you off if you have never experienced this for yourself. Again, agree with him or not, Ted Turner is owed a debt of gratitude for taking this stand and if you are going to experience the series for the first time or reveal it to your children, Season One is once again well-worth the price of admission. The end theme song alone is worth the price of admission! ""The Power is YOURS!""",1302825600,,3874,5.04375
