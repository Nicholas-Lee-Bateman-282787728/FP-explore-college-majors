After watching it I even thought I had dreamed about it. But no, it is fantastic and has a story that rivals those of Gabriel Garca Mrquez, to make an example.
Fernando Solanas tells us Martin's (Walter Quiroz) story, a young Argentinian, who one day decides it is time to go look for his father. In order to do this, he has to leave behind his mother, stepfather, friends and girlfriend. Takes his bicycle and, without knowing how far he will have to go, departs.
His most treasured memento is a illustrated book his father drew for him before leaving. So, with his book and his bicycle, starts his journey from the very tip of the south pole, Patagonia, and travels his way up, ending in Mxico. All the time watching incredible landscapes and meeting incredible people.
Prepare to be amazed by this movie!",1316736000,,846,4.6466666666666665
