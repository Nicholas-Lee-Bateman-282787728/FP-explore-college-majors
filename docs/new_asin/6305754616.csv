7894190,4,6305754616,"When I first saw the Good Life (the British name) in the 1970s as an impressionable kid, I immediately loved it. Everybody was so nice and civilized unlike the glue-sniffing, head-butting ruffians at my local Scottish comprehensive school. I was so charmed that I almost wanted to become English, middle-class, and 'awfully nice.' I also developed a raging crush on Felicity Kendal.
This series was a product of the golden age of British TV when the BBC was more like a giant artists' collective than the faceless management bureau it has since become. The casting is incredible. The four main actors are hand-in-glove with their roles. Paul Eddington as the long-suffering but slyly rebellious Jerry is the perfect foil for Margot's innocent pomposity. Felicity Kendall's Barbara is both tomboyish and kittenish and serves as a welcome check on Richard Brier's naughty little boy act as the exuberant and mischievous Tom.
For those unfamiliar with the situation of this situation comedy, it concerns the efforts of Tom and Barbara Good to escape the 9-to-5, Monday-to-Friday, suburbs-to-city commuting rat race, by starting a commune in their own garden, and the effect this has on their relationship with their very strait-laced neighbors, Jerry and Margot.
Although this tape is labeled volume 4 it actually includes the 1st, 2nd, and 6th episodes of the first series. So, if you want to start chronologically, this tape should be first. The reason the order is so confused is because the BBC was not wholly committed to the project, selecting what they thought were the best episodes and putting them out on video in an ad hoc way. The 3 episodes and their original broadcast dates are:
(1) Plough Your Own Furrow - 4th of April, 1975
This episode has overtones of another great BBC comedy series - the ""Rise and Fall of Reginald Perrin"" - as Tom Good becomes dissatisfied with his job. Although designing small plastic animals for cereal packets is patently absurd, the other people in his office take it all very seriously. Turning his back on the false idols of success, he decides to jump ship from the rat race and seek a more meaningful life by using his large suburban garden to become self-sufficient. Barbara plays a key role in this episode, but Margot and Jerry hardly feature.
(2) Say Little Hen - 11th of April, 1975
Tom and Barbara's new life hasn't yet been established. Tom's neighbors, Jerry and Margot, making assumptions based on their own value system, try to persuade Tom's boss to take him back.
(3) The Pagan Rite - 9th of May, 1975
Although this is the sixth episode, it is thematically linked to the first two with Tom's former boss seeking him out to do some freelance work. Wanting some money to treat Barbara, Tom is tempted to give in to the forces of consumer materialism that their lifestyle is a rebellion against, but Barbara sees this as the thin end of the wedge.",983404800,2,2902,4.841046277665996
7894191,5,6305754616,"I saw this series when it came to US TV some years ago (thank you, forever, PBS).  I loved it then.  I love it now.  I've got the whole collection, finally.
Stars:  Tom & Barbara Good, played by Richard Briers and Felicity Kendal - whom I worship, and Margo & Jerry Leadbetter, played by Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington.
I also saw Felicity Kendal in a PBS replay of the BBC Shakespeare series with her starring as Viola in ""Twelfth Night"" and was so impressed that I named a daughter after her.
Felicity (and the other cast members) are believable, funny, and always in trouble, love, etc., with each other.
The setting...  Tom & Barbara move to a ritzy neighborhood and start a farm... well, more like they decide to ""live off the land.""  Try that in a swank neighborhood and I'm sure you'll end up with some of the problems they had.
Totally hysterical.  Very funny.  A must see.  Own it if you can.  Definitely for the whole family.",970099200,2,938,4.464705882352941
