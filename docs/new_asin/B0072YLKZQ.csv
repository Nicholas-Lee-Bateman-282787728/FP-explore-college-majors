Stroje bardzo dobre i ze jest to tylko jeden jedyny film z tego czasu historii to bardzo polecam dorzucic to kolekcji.  Warty oglodadania.  Nie mialem problemu z dostawa 5 gwiazd dla obslugi.

5053180,5,B0072YLKZQ,"I teach a classes for mature students at our local college about less known but significant military engagements in history.  The Battle of warsaw 1920 certainly falls into that category.  When I found that a movie had recently been made on this very topic I was delighted.  The movie is excellent and picks up many of the elements of the episode although one should have studied other written history materials to recognize them.  The ""commentary"" approach via a cabaret vehicle is interestingly done and many of the important comments are made in those segments.  Given the history of Poland since 1920 through WW II, Katyn and Communist Block it is not surprising that this movie has been long in coming.  Combat detail is not spared so be aware!  Movie was supplied direct from Poland in ""all region"" format.  Title is ""1920 Bitwa Warszawska"" and is subtitled well in English.",1349395200,6,880,4.859060402684563
5053181,5,B0072YLKZQ,"My Polish father, who himself served with the Free Polish Forces fighting alongside the allies in almost every theatre of the European campaign against the Germans and their allies, always spoke of how his father fought the Russians to ensure the liberty of a re-emerged Polish State. I have since read the historial accounts by Norman Davies and Adam Zamoyski.

Now we have none other than the very competent Polish Director, Jerzy Hoffman, bringing it to the screen in 3D. Sadly, living in Australia I doubt whether the blu-ray version for my region will ever become available. It is not yet available even in the dvd version here, and for that I thank the existence of Amazon which allows me to obtain recently made Polish films.

As a plot this film has it all. It has huge battle scenes, a love story and some historical terms of reference. However, it should be remembered that in 1919 Pilsudski wanted to re-establish a powerful confederation of states akin to what was once the great Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, he was somewhat imperialistic as well. What is also glossed over is that the Poles were not only fighting Russian Reds, but also Ukrainian, Belarussian and Lithuanian nationalists. They were also fighting Germans in Silesia. Furthermore, after defeating Russia the Poles took a lot of Ukrainian, Lithuanian and Belarussian territory and this lost them valuable allies against the German and Russian invasions of 1939.

Overall, although missing a number of historical reference points it is a beautifully shot film and a great story.",1347926400,21,1566,5.062015503875969
5053182,3,B0072YLKZQ,"If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best that this film has to offer; the rest is visually stunning (but uninspiring) filler.  Poland defeated the Bolsheviks decisively in the 1920 battle for Warsaw, but ""Bitwa Warszawska"" twists the ropes of that great historical encounter into pure bathos.

With a couple of exceptions (e.g., Adam Ferency as the rabid communist Bukowski, or Olga Kabo as his disillusioned ""war"" wife), the actors, especially the beautiful Natasza Urbanska, give leaden portrayals of the film's various fictional and historical personalities, and I was particularly disappointed by the stilted caricature of Marshal Pilsudski by one of Poland's finest actors, Daniel Olbrychski.  To be fair, though, the mawkish screenplay provided little in the way of theatrical nourishment for this film's characters.

Apparently, this is Poland's first foray into 3-D, but I bought the 2-D dvd, and thought that, in general, the video quality was very good.  It is also worth mentioning, though, that the musical score, so important to a movie of such grand pretensions, was a lackluster rehash from the director's ""Deluge"" trilogy, and could have used a fresher slant from a John Williams or Zbigniew Preisner. .

At the end of the day, if you're evenly remotely interested in the significance of this great historical conflict between Poland and the young Soviet empire (led by Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, et al), you'd be much better served by reading Adam Zamoyski's short book, ""Warsaw 1920,"" or ""White Eagle Red Star"" by Norman Davies.  You're sure not going to gain much insight or depth through this plot-challenged, battle-heavy, movie hodgepodge.  [There is also an interesting book, ""Kosciuszko, We Are Here:  American Pilots of the Kosciuszko Squadron in Defense of Poland, 1919-1921"" by Janusz Cisek, which adds a valuable perspective to this combat].

TECHNICAL POINT:  Although the product details indicate that this dvd is PAL (Region 2), the disc that I received from Poland plays on my regular dvd player. I have a region-free OPPO which plays both PAL and NTSC dvds, but when I first got ""Bitwa ..."" in the mail, I accidentally put it into my non-region-free Pioneer dvd player and ultimately discovered that it plays fine in both players.  [The product details on the back of the Polish disc jacket indicate that this is a DVD 9, and I've read that copy production flags or region codes can't ordinarily be encrypted onto these kinds of discs.  Consequently, they play in all regions].",1328745600,16,2515,5.134803921568627

8509098,5,B0072YLKZQ,"A really terrific film about one of the most important battles of the modern age. Marshal Pilsudski's magnificent victory against the Bolseviks at Warsaw in 1920 is often compared with Carl Martell's epic victory against the Arabs at Poitiers in the 8th century AD. If the Poles hadn't succeeded, then the communist revolution would have engulfed the whole Central Europe with devastating consequences. The film reconstructs the era in a marvelous way, the acting is very good and the battle scenes extremely realistic and breathtaking.",1432512000,2,536,5.317647058823529

8509101,3,B0072YLKZQ,"The Russo-Polish War to Poland is one of the great turning-points of 20th century Polish history. The Battle of the Vistula is considered the greatest day regarding Polish greatness (although Solidarity is pretty equivalent, but that is another story).

The narrative is muti-layered. Jan is going into the Polish army to fight Russia. He has just married a cabaret singer, Ola. Jan barely survives a series of trials (literally and figuratively), where, just about to be killed, he is miraculously saved. Jan, who seems ideologically solid in his beliefs, soon realizes (due to various characters and their ideologies) that he has been blinded by his own 'morals'.

The movie is just not about Jan, but is about the multi-faceted Polish people, and their struggle for independence. (The movie was the first Polish 3-D film, too, and this is noticeable in the battle scenes). The battle scenes are overdone and overly symbolic. There is a huge dose of melodrama on so many levels, that it is impossible to list them here. The director, Jerzy Hoffman, is a bit 'full of himself' and pompous to give this time of Polish history the respect it deserves. However, I can't totally fault the movie for being overdone. Some of the interesting Polish 'types' that Hoffman shows are quite fascinating, especially their interactions with one another and with other nationalities. Poland, who did not have a nation until they won this war (only to have it 'taken away' through the Hitler-Stalin pact and Stalin claiming it in the name of communism), did have quite a bit of dissention and bickering within its national community about what type of Poland there should be. This might not make sense, but I am sure a Pole would understand what I am attempting to construe.

I give 3 of 5 Amazon stars for the entire movie. It is simply a Polish-nationalist, feel-good, gung-ho, patriotic film with melodrama galore! It is pretty silly and mediocre at times, with little realism. The strength in the movie lies with the characters and their interactions: they are attempting to define their own Polishness and Polish Identity in quite interesting ways.",1385078400,2,2138,4.983193277310924
8509102,4,B0072YLKZQ,"The only war the Soviets lost was that against the Poles in 1920. It was a very big deal. In particular, the American aviators kept the Budyenny Army of the South
sufficiently harassed that they failed to join with Tukhashevsky's Army of the North. These were led by M.C. Cooper from Jacksonville Florida, who created the Polish
Airforce. Later Cooper wrote, produced and directed King Kong. He was the producer of the Ford classics such as The Searchers.

This movie is watered down to conceal the big differences between the Catholic Poles and the Red Army. The leading actress is portrayed as a former cabaret singer.
Much of the time in the movie is spent deflecting away from the serious life and death struggle faced by the Poles. As a former Party member married to a Soviet wife, Hoffman
was probably a poor choice for directing the film. However, I would recommend this film, since Hoffman is an excellent cinematographer. There is a 30 minute core of the film
which should have been fleshed out to replace irrelevant Liza Minelli like cabaret scenes. This War was a very big deal. The present post-communist government of Poland
does not like dwelling on such events. Most of the junior league of the old communists of the former satellites are now in power (with the exception of Hungary) and they don't like to be reminded of their training days with the Soviets. ""Plus a change, plus c'est la mme chose.""

I was in Poland when ""The March of the First Brigade"" was played on the carillon of the Sejm after Freedom came. A moment for moist eyes. The old Soviet ways linger on, and people are suffering from a government that does not understand the concept of a Free Market. But things are better under the post-communists than they were under the real ones. That a film could have been made about the Miracle on the Vistula is a sign of progress and hope. This movie may be playable on some American dvd players, e.g., Apex. The essential patriotic core of 30 minutes may be viewed on YouTube.

The best is the enemy of the good. If this film were available in American dvd format, I would definitely buy it.",1374883200,4,2120,4.618037135278515

This is an excellent movie about events of momentous importance to our culture. This crisis is not taught in English, French or American schools because this Soviet attack on Europe detailed in the DVD was a reply to the invading armies of the British, French, Americans, Italians, Japanese and ten other nations who had invaded the Soviert Union two years earler and were soundly defeated.

Good settings, accurate period costumes and equipment down to the tiniest detail, very good actors.

There is something for everybody in this movie, comedy, theater, combat, heroism and a love story. What is best it is not a work of fiction but entierly true.  I want to see more films from Poland!

I could describe the film as a 'mini-Doctor Zhivago' but with a lot more combat; the heroin is actally forced to strip off her red cross armband and take command of a heavy machinegun position to defend her patients",1368835200,3,963,4.847560975609756
