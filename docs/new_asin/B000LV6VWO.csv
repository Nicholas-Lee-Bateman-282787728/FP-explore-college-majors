8164372,3,B000LV6VWO,"As this series goes, this is one of the weaker episodes in terms of production quality. This uses more footage from other sources than any other episode and while the Porsche story is still well told, the impact is not the same as say the Jaguar episode. I still enjoy it, but wish it was as good as some of the others.",1501632000,,319,4.161290322580645

8164378,3,B000LV6VWO,"Having bought the Ferrari edition of this series first, I was expecting the same depth of production and film quality in this edition.  I was disappointed in the film quality,the collection of cars actually driven and the selection of historic footage.  Still an interesting watch if you like the mark, but a far second to the Ferrari series.",1351987200,,342,4.879310344827586
8164379,3,B000LV6VWO,"I absolutely love the Victory By Design series. Most of the episodes feature Alain de Cadenet driving lots of the cars he discusses. This episode is strangely lacking in that key aspect. He discusses the cars extensively, they intercut interviews with key players in Porsche's racing history, but he only does a little driving.

If your primary interest is in seeing a video that discusses Porsche's racing history at length, this episode will be perfect. It features a discussion of most of the significant milestones in Porsche competition cars and includes a lot of historical race footage.

But if you're like me and most enjoy the segments in which Alain actually drives the cars, I'd skip this episode; while I admit I haven't seen the entire series, every other episode I've seen features many more cars being driven than this one does.",1325548800,,843,4.929577464788732
8164380,4,B000LV6VWO,"This is a great video, full of cool old footage of Porsche's racing heritage.  Although it's really is great to see the old footage and interviews, after watching the narrator and director at work in the Ferrari DVD, this doesn't compare.  There are almost no scenes with de Cadenet driving the classic examples in Dolby Surround and beautiful modern detail.

I think they should revisit the Porsche topic and find owners willing to let de Cadenet wrestle their cars around gorgeous landscapes like they did with the Ferrari video.

This is a classic documentary DVD, but it fails in showing you what it's like to hear and drive one of these cars today.",1262304000,,653,4.752212389380531
