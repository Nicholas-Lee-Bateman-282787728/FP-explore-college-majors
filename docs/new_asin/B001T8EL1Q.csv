3788516,5,B001T8EL1Q,"I first saw Zaboomafoo 10 years ago when my grandaughter was young.  I wanted my 5 year old grandson to see this show because it is so much fun.  The Kratt brothers are great and Zaboomafoo, a talking lemur, looks so real.  They all have so much fun with the animals they bring into the club house while teaching children about them.  I would recommend this dvd and this show to anyone with young children.",1339545600,,406,4.373333333333333
3788517,5,B001T8EL1Q,So thankful to have found this dvd.  This show is so old but was a family favorite !  Thought is was a little expensive.,1332028800,,120,3.9583333333333335
3788518,5,B001T8EL1Q,"My two year old has been watching this since he was a year and a half.  What impressed me is how much he learned about animals from this show and how much his vocabulary expanded once he started talking.  The real shame is it used to come on Sprout on Verizon Fios but now it doesn't.  The best part is that his father and I have watched the episods with him a million times, it seems, without getting bored.  This is a must have for any parent.",1329782400,,445,4.080459770114943
3788519,5,B001T8EL1Q,My son (age 5) loves all the episodes included in this DVD.  He spouts off interesting facts about animals that he learned from watching the DVD.  Even his 8 year old brother enjoys the video.,1319328000,,192,4.457142857142857

3788521,5,B001T8EL1Q,"Purchased this DVD for my 3 yr. old.  He loves it!  We are a no-tv family and screen time is rare (only in the car on an insanely long 10 hr. car ride or when he is sick).  This is, hands down, the best kids tv show ever!  The Kratt Brothers are fun, upbeat exciting but not too exciting, inspiring chidlren to love all types of animals.  They even learn a lot of natural history while watching it.  I could do without Zabooland animation but my 3 yr, old likes it.  I highly recommend this DVD! (ages 3-7)  This Dvd has 6 full episodes.",1316476800,4,537,4.096153846153846
3788522,5,B001T8EL1Q,"My grandchildren are so thrilled with this multi-episode DVD that they giggled and laughed out loud.  They wanted to watch it again and again, especially ""Fling"" about a fun-loving monkey that flings things including cream pies.  Nice healthy and fun entertainment for children of all ages, even Grandma.  And we learn lots about the animals too.  Highly recommend this DVD to all families.",1315526400,5,390,5.142857142857143
3788523,5,B001T8EL1Q,I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it. Sees watches this show on Sprout TV and I looked in other stores and no one had it. Sure enough Amazon had it. I will be ordering another one soon for my niece. Delivery was excellent as always.,1301270400,4,245,4.125
3788524,5,B001T8EL1Q,"My son loves Zaboomafoo and this DVD has 5 or 6 fun episodes, some that we had seen on TV and some unfamiliar ones, but all good.  Its a fun program and hard to find on DVD format, so I was very very pleased to get it.",1298332800,5,218,3.6382978723404253
3788525,1,B001T8EL1Q,"i purchased this dvd because my son had the vcr tape of this cover on tape and it broke. so i thought this cover would have the episodes that were on the tape. which was the elephant one and it was not on it.
why put a picture on the cover and not have the episode on it. i was very upset and so was my son.
i tried to replace what he had and i spent $40 on this dvd and it is not the right one.

also if they listed which 6 episodes were on this dvd i would have not purchased it because it wasn't the ones that were on his vcr tape.

very misleading and not what it should have been..",1270944000,5,586,3.68
3788526,5,B001T8EL1Q,I enjoyed this show immensely as a kid and now my students are as well.  A great way to introduce kids to different animals.,1474502400,,124,4.166666666666667

3788534,5,B001T8EL1Q,My 5 year old is hooked! TV is filled with garbage shows that are trying to turn my Daughter's Brain to mush. This is helping me reverse the effects of Cartoon Network!,1452643200,,168,4.28125
3788535,5,B001T8EL1Q,"3yo and 5yo boys love this show. Wish I could find more episodes!! It is a little more fast paced for my 3yo than I would like (I prefer Mister Rogers for that age), but at least no cartoons (just not a huge fan of cartoons though we do Daniel Tiger sometimes). Very nice to have another good option for TV time.",1452124800,,312,4.048387096774194

3788539,5,B001T8EL1Q,Was the item I was looking for and was brand new like the seller described,1440979200,,74,4.0
3788540,5,B001T8EL1Q,"Our 6 yr old son loves the Kratt Brothers and this dvd did not disappoint.  I wish there were more titles available (not on VHS)
We are very happy we purchased this.",1435104000,,165,4.15625
3788541,5,B001T8EL1Q,"My kids LOVE the Kratt brothers as they watch Wild Kratts all of the time, but they never got the chance to see Zoboomafoo (only being 4 and 7, the show has been off PBS for a few years now). I got them this video and they really enjoy seeing all of the animals. They have asked for more episodes but it's really too bad that you can't buy additional DVD episodes!!",1432425600,,365,4.083333333333333
3788542,5,B001T8EL1Q,all good.,1426118400,,9,4.0
3788543,5,B001T8EL1Q,"My son and I love Zoboomafoo.  The Kratt brothers bring so much positive energy to this show. Even though most of it takes place in one place (Animal Junction) it's never boring.  Each show follows a format of guessing what animal they are going to meet, going to the closet and taking a trip, etc.  I think this show is infinitely better than Wild Kratts.  (The only thing not-so-good about the show are the clay animation segments.  Those are painful.) Highly recommended!  (This is a good DVD too because it has 6 episodes.)",1424476800,,527,4.612903225806452
3788544,5,B001T8EL1Q,Great experience! Would defiantly order from them again. Good quality merchandise for affordable price,1423958400,,102,6.357142857142857

3788547,5,B001T8EL1Q,My son watches it vonstantly,1407369600,,28,4.8
3788548,5,B001T8EL1Q,My daughter loves the Kratt brothers and is familiar with most episodes from Kratts Creatures all the way to Wild Kratts.  It was so long before we could find anything from them on DVD so we immediately buy everything when it does come out on this format.  This Zoboo edition fast and slow creatures and is very good.  She has memorized every detail about every animal that the Kratts have ever presented and tells me years later she got her animal facts from Kratts.  She like them far better than Jarod Miller.,1396051200,3,512,4.532608695652174
3788549,5,B001T8EL1Q,This show was on TV a long while ago and I remembered it from my babysitting days. My son loves the new show Wild Kratts so I bought this for him and he loves this show too. It is an active show that keeps your childs attention without conflict and loss stories. There is great learning potential for kids interested in animals or if not they may be after watching this show. The Kratt brothers know how to talk with kids and keep their interest. This video is worth it for kids ages 3-7 I would guess.,1394064000,4,502,4.185567010309279
3788550,5,B001T8EL1Q,"My nephew absolutely loves this show.  He watches it over and over and has a Zoboo plush, too.  The show is fun and educational.",1392768000,,128,4.291666666666667
3788551,5,B001T8EL1Q,"My 5 AND 10yo ladies, to be precise. My eldest is definitely more into Wild Kratts at this point but will still sit and enjoy these shows with the little one. She may even be okay with her friends knowing this fact, which speaks to the wide appeal of The Brothers Kratt. Of course the 5yo loves the Zoboo burp the most. ;)",1392249600,,322,4.126984126984127
3788552,5,B001T8EL1Q,"This was purchased for a 5 year old and a 3 year old, both of whom love animals and enjoy the Wild Kratts series.  They loved this DVD.  It is 3 full hours of learning and entertainment.  Highly recommend.",1386374400,,205,4.205128205128205
3788553,5,B001T8EL1Q,...loves this. He loves Zaboo but we moved from an area that carried the Sprout network to one that doesn't. This allows him to continue to watch this funny and educational program.,1380153600,,181,4.6875
3788554,5,B001T8EL1Q,"Great, informative, show about wild animals with the ever entertaining Kratt Brothers.  It's great to see a kids show where the endgame isn't about selling toys, video games or some other related product!",1378598400,,204,5.181818181818182

3788559,3,B001T8EL1Q,My son was not as interested in this one verses the other wild kratts cartoon style ones. It is cute and you still learn and see the real animal on the show. The show is playful and cute but my son did stay focused on show.,1367539200,,223,3.869565217391304

3788563,5,B001T8EL1Q,"Some of my kids got to enjoy this when it ran on TV, the rest are getting it this way.  I don't think it matters which of the series the Kratt brothers made, they are all great fun, great entertainment, and great for kids of any age.  We're watching the latest one on PBS now, and stocking up on the 'old' series besides.  Kids just love these nature programs, presented as they are in such a fun way they connect with so much more easily (though I bet they would have enjoyed Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom, too, seeing as that was all that was available back then!)  Great job, guys--are you planning another series already?",1355702400,,626,4.370689655172414
3788564,5,B001T8EL1Q,"Zoboomafoo is a great addition to my Wild Kratts DVD's. This is really for the kids.  Zoboomafoo Has great information on the animals.  I love that at the end they have warnings for the kids about NOT touching animals, because they do show, touch and work with wild animals. If you like this show you might also like Wild Kratts: Jungle Animals, Wild Kratts: Creature Adventures and/or Wild Kratts: Predator Power. :)",1346889600,,417,4.777777777777778
