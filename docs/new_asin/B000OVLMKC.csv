2801451,3,B000OVLMKC,"Dont Get me wrong, Miami vice is my ALL TIME FAV SHOW. Even though season 5 took a werid turn, just like 4, i still enjoy the mystery and mystque of the show. I really enjoyed seeing don playing a heel in the last episode of season 4 and early in season 5. He plays the bad guys well and you could sense through all the previous seasons that it was eventually going to happen. But when he came back to crockett, what the hell happend? The next episode Heart of Night, only featured don, in a 3 min scene and was never seen again in the episode? How the hell can you have a very climatic 3 shows about our hero going bad and then the next episode deal with a personal issue involving Castillo? It doesnt make sense? Why didn't they go into a major investigation, or at least a trial? But all we see is a 5 min tounge lashing in episode 4 Bad Timing? Then in Borrasca Don isn't even written in? Then to make matters worse ""Line of Fire"" (which happens to be a great episode) It seems like sonny never went bad and we forget he ever killed anybody? all in all  a near poor season. But what saves it from a 2 to a 3 is the stand out episodes, Lost Madonna, and Freefall. My 2 fav episodes of the post 87 year! I don't understand why most of the episodes, don wanst in them? I wonder if there was tension between Don and the shows writers. If you own all 4 seasons then you must get this to complete the collection, cause the 2 hr finale is incredible, but don't buy this unless your a true fan of miami vice.",1179446400,19,1504,4.046979865771812
2801452,5,B000OVLMKC,Don't miss this Season. To question buying the final Season of Vice disproves that you're a true blue fan ;),1179014400,6,108,4.45
2801453,4,B000OVLMKC,"After five trendsetting seasons of defining the cultural 80's vibe, Vice was beginning to lose its glamour and had overstayed its welcome by becoming as trendy and outmoded as yesterday's pastel-colored fashions.  The mood and feel of the show had shifted away from the pop-electric neon atmosphere of earlier seasons to a darker and edgier tone beginning with the two-part conclusion to the season four cliffhanger ""Mirror Image"" that ended with Sonny, believing that he is his undercover persona Burnett after suffering total amnesia in a boat explosion, races off in a speedboat after killing an undercover detective.  Tubbs has tracked him down somewhere near Ft. Lauderdale where he has been living for months as a hit-man for a powerful crime cartel.  The premiere episode ""Hostile Takeover"" begins with Sonny rising through the ranks of the Carrera's by doing the dirty deeds for the feuding family in an effort to take out the rival El Gato organization.  Posing as a Jamaican buyer, Tubbs rendezvous with Sonny at the Cape Florida Lighthouse in an effort to jar his memory but instead Sonny tries to kill Tubbs when it triggers a memory flashback and he remembers that he is a cop.

After the initial Burnett story-arc is concluded in ""Redemption in Blood,"" the remaining episodes seemed to turn somewhat anti-climactic.  What could have been an interesting season-long theme that that could have potentially played up Sonny-turned-bad masquerading as his undercover alter-ego Burnett is cut short prematurely and it's hard to believe that Sonny isn't indicted for all of his heinous crimes or at the very least is forced to turn in his badge.  There's a few moments with Crockett trying to reconcile his relationship with his son Billy in ""To Have and To Hold"" and coming to terms with his ex, Caroline, and an amusing light-hearted episode with his con-artist cousin Jack played by David Andrews in ""Jack of All Trades"" and also Tubbs reuniting with Valerie reprised by Pam Grier in the originally unaired ""Too Much, Too Late"" that help to wrap up loose ends but overall you can sense that the end of the line was coming and the cast and crew were just riding things out.  Don Johnson's wardrobe had gone from stylish slacks and casual loafers to denim bluejeans and cowboy boots and his long shaggy blonde locks made him look like he'd just walked off the set of Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man.  The absence of composer Jan Hammer is painfully felt and Tim Truman's commendable scoring gives it a very different overall feel compared to previous seasons and redundant plotlines involving South American drug smugglers had finally exhausted themselves but the payoff at the end of the final episode ""Freefall"" is emotional as the ensemble cast members say their goodbyes and go their seperate ways and almost as suddenly as Miami Vice had come to an end, so too had the fashionable decade of the 1980's.",1176508800,100,2920,4.930753564154786

2801458,2,B000OVLMKC,"The last season of Miami Vice was a disappointment, pure and simple.  Like so many television shows that follow the usual life cycle, there comes a point when the creative potential of a franchise has simply been exhausted. You notice it when plots deteriorate, storytelling is no longer ""tight"" and compelling, scene setups become lazy, production values are scaled down, old ideas, even some old scenes and footage are recycled, and lead actors who ultimately only saw a series as a springboard to further their own career become increasingly absent. The rats are leaving the sinking ship.

Miami Vice had been burning the candle at both ends, it used to be a tour de force of new things, new ideas and innovative television programming for its first two, maybe three seasons. It was the hottest thing on television at that brief moment that was the mid-80s. By season three, Michael Mann, whose style and obsession with detail defined the first two seasons, had turned the show over to Dick Wolf, who followed a very different approach and took the series into a whole different direction than the glittering document of 80s pop (and drug) culture that Michael Mann had created. This was ill-fated right out the gate, as declining ratings proved very early on midway through season three. Season four tried to revive Vice's old magic and return the show to its former glory, but it failed, and eventually, the producers stopped bothering. Instead, season 5 just killed its time until the two-hour finale. This was sometimes more obvious, sometimes less obvious, but its whole vibe which had turned yet more dark and cynical had very little, if anything to do with what had once earned Miami Vice a massive fan following. Even the most loyal fans were no longer tuning in. Including me.

At least by y season 4, on top of its own deteriorating quality, Miami Vice was also beginning to have to chase the competiton of new, similarly big-budget television shows, and the following year, its makers didn't even care anymore that they were so far behind the curve they couldn't even see it. I guess that's the point about fashion - one minute you create a trend, then that trend gets a following and you're riding high, but if you're not careful, before you know it, fashion will have moved on and you will just look out of place. Bad production decisions aside, season 5 was simply when the premise of two undercover cops in expensive clothing and a Ferrari chasing the bad guys all over Miami had been worn so threadbare that it seemed about as unfashionable as your dad's favorite coat from five years ago.

For what it is, some season 5 episodes really aren't all that bad. Somebody who has never seen a single Miami Vice episode before would maybe even say that the dark atmosphere of season 5 has its share of things going for it. But this is Miami, pal. A dark, broody mood, tone and atmosphere like that of season 5 just doesn't suit a tropical seacoast paradise like Miami. At least not when it's for the whole 46 minutes of an episode's run and not interspersed with even a dash of lightness and comical moments and characters, all of which had brought a bit of the good life to Miami Vice that could so easily be had in southern Florida. What season 5 did to all that made about as much sense as if you had moved Baywatch to Alaska.

For the sake of completing your Miami Vice collection, go ahead and buy this box set. For a look at how it all went wrong and if you've got nothing better to do with your money, also buy it. But if you've bought season 1 and 2, even season 3, and are hoping to get the same all-around entertainment value out of season 5, you will be disappointed.",1467331200,,3691,4.594840667678301

These are Miami novices who don't understand that there were five separate seasons of this show. This season was awful. Don Johnson was busy doing movies and was absent from many episodes, heck, he was absent in many episodes he was in. All of the main producers had left, along with the writers and directors. Jan Hammer left. Olmos was making movies. You were left with Phillip Michael Thomas trying to save the show.......yeah, exactly. Gone are the pastels and fashion flair of earlier seasons. Gone are the well-written stories. Gone is everything that was great about this show. This is one of my favorite shows ever, but season 5 is still almost impossible to sit through. Horrible stories, horrible production, acting, and editing. Heck, one of the episodes was not even a Vice episode, but a truly awful attempt at a spin-off.

The fifth season begins with Sonny Crockett turning into an actual criminal, due to
an explosion which gives him amnesia and he thinks that he is actually Burnett, his
undercover alias.  When he regains his memory, he goes back to Vice, an investigation
ensues as Crockett deals with the fallout.  It seems like they were trying to get back to
the team that they had during the first two seasons, but it seemed to me that it just
wasn't the same as before.  I would have preferred the Burnett arc to have occurred
in the fourth season and have some Trudy, more Switek, Castillo, Gina-centered episodes
instead in this last season.  Worth a watch.

Favorite episodes - Borrasca (needed more undercover Castillo, he was in the DEA!), Heart
of Night, Miami Squeeze, Asian Cut, Fruit of the Poison Tree, The Lost Madonna, Over the
Line, To Have and to Hold, and Freefall.",1431129600,,901,4.6

2801520,4,B000OVLMKC,"Sex, drugs ( a moral tale of why NOT to indulge), fashion, a good amount of awful 80's music, Sgt Castillo dead pan acting, Tubbs overacting, silly plots, bust up action, - you cannot go wrong with  any of these episodes. 80's was a unique time and you cannot compare it to today. This was a time when neon, glamor, new-punk, fashion was all the rave. I would die to have a body like Gina or Trudy and play the cope/streetwalker role. The series is very addictive with its moral tales of excess, greed, drugs and dated fashion that the likes of Lady GaGa has re-invented. Crockett and Tubbs are drool worthy and the cast of characters are always lively and entertaining.  One of the best part is seeing up and coming actors or media personalities on the show (Miles Davis, Don King, Sheena Easton) to name a few.

I downgraded 1 star due to the poor video quality of season 4 and season 5. I felt like these shows were recorded off a VHS tape.  The first two season were crystal clear and had great visual quality.  Another minor nitpick is the cases are flimsy.

  Few complaints, Don Johnson took half the season off, many episodes you only see him in the opening scene and thats it, totally gone from then on, many of the episodes feature Rico and Stan more than Rico and Sonny.  But it still works out great, Tubbs gets more of the starring role.
  Season 5 features the cult classic episode ""Miracle Man"", the silliest episode ever but it still works and it's funny to see them act all serious about Miracle Man, you gotta buy the DVD set for that episode alone!
  Great scripts and stories, not sure why Season 5 failed so bad in the ratings other than to think that after 5 years, the teenie boppers of the MTV generation graduated High School and moved on and the new younger crowd fed on other shows at the time instead like Full House and crap like that.

2801532,5,B000OVLMKC,"Judging a ground-breaking television show that defined an era without actually having lived that era seems absurd to me.
Why? Because the 80s was a decade that broke ground in so many levels.  A distinctive decade to say the least.  With all its
good and its bad.  A different decade.  A decade like no other.

I have loved the show since its first episode for many reasons:  the plots, the acting, the writing, the directing, the music and
of course the clothes.  In other words, the true vibe of the 80s.  Since I was living in Miami at the time (Miami Beach actually),
I was able to live the vibe as it was.  I was there.  In fact, I would sometimes see some of the scenes being shot on location
as it was happening.  Furthermore, oftentimes I would see some members of the cast in the area when not actually shooting.
Even a couple of years after the show had ended I saw Phillip Michael Thomas sitting in his car waiting for someone to come
out of a local health food store.  I struck a conversation with him -- not precisely about Vice, and he was extremely polite and
nice.

The point is, the show reflected everything the decade was about, and everything that Miami was at the time, no more
and no less.  And that is what I call EPIC. I doubt there can ever be another show like Vice.  It made an impact not only in the
United States but all around the world where the series was shown --  to high ratings, incidentally.  That is what EPIC means
and that is what VICE was.  All five seasons.  Different. daring, smart, funny at times, dark at others and even at times somewhat
silly.  But, that is precisely what had the viewer coming back for more week after week: the unpredictability of it all.  That is what
makes VICE one of a kind.  The 80s was a decade like no other and VICE was in many levels, its perfect MIRROR.",1307145600,3,1830,4.3049853372434015
2801533,4,B000OVLMKC,"Olmos is missing from several eps towards the end, Stan's gambling problem remains a problem, Tubbs gets short shrift for a while, the ladies get some decent screen time, and Sonny never mentions Caitlin again.  However, he is burned out by the end of this season, and Tubbs is not far behind. This is understandable, given the huge number of blows and injuries to the soul that Sonny sustained over the past few years.  The ending makes sense.

A few quibbles:  The Leap of Faith ep. features a bunch of other people instead of the main cast, and Sonny is conspicuously absent from some eps, as is Tubbs.

Otherwise, a great finale for a great show.",1301270400,3,650,4.568965517241379
2801534,4,B000OVLMKC,"My reviews of the other seasons of Miami Vice have pointed out that I did not watch this show while it was on, and am only a recent convert to the show.  I point this out again so that those reading this review know I am not someone whose eyes are covered with a blanket of nostalgia, but just as someone who enjoys watching a great show.  The final season of Miami Vice truly is a bit of a mixed bag.  While I don't know the behind the scence stories, I'd imagine there was some tension between Don Johnson and the rest of the staff as his stories showed a pattern of solely involing him, with the rest of the characters taking more of a back drop.  However, the stories he was not involved gave everyone else a real chance to shine, and show even the supporting characters could hold their own.  While this was an interesting change, it made the show a bit less effective.  The trouble is that the show feels a bit tired this season, though still very entertaining.  It's almost being such an cutting-edge show has weighed down the characters and creative talent, causing them to waiver.  While this didn't ruin the show, far from it in fact, it makes for a weaker season than those past.  That being said, there was still some great entertainment to be had, the return of lombardo, the season/series finale, and a host of others were really good.  But I think the show ending at this point was good, as they stopped just as the show was feeling a bit weaker.  All in all, I really was impressed by this ""80s"" show, though I first watched it two decades later.  I still recomend the final season for no other reason than seeing closure brought to one of the best cop shows of all time.",1289520000,6,1687,4.337579617834395
2801535,2,B000OVLMKC,"I was in a Miami Vice mood, and after listening to Tim Truman's Season Five soundtrack (songs like Freefall), I thought I would relive my late 80s teenage years and watch the final season of what was one my favorite TV show. Miami Vice has a few great actors: Don Johnson was one of them. Edward James Olmos was surely another. Philip Michael Thomas was also good; as were Michael Talbot (Switez) and Sandra Santiago, who had just one line in the final episode. Im remembering how great she was in the pilot episode of season one. There is a scene with her and Sonny Crocket on his boat, ""you can give me that fast talking cowboy story from now until doomsday...but I don't believe it.""  Another actress on the set probably wouldn't have pulled it off. And that is the problem I have with Season Five. There are a lot of episodes where secondary characters -- all bad guys -- just have too many lines and too much screen time. Like who is that blonde gold digger in ep 1 season 5 trying to win over Sonny Burnett (Crocket's deep cover name)? We, at least I, don't believe that Sonny can be so into this woman that he is willing to risk his life to include her in his plot to overthrow a mid-sized drug cartel. And what is with that terrible actor with the Flock of Seagulls hairdo who plays the son of the drug dealer? This isn't Anthony Yerkovich's handiwork anymore, clearly, and it shows. Too many bad guys we don't know, with too many lines. Season one's bad guy was Calderon, the Colombian drug lord. Like Jaws, we knew he was in the water, but we only saw him twice and he only had one line: ""You can't shoot me you lousy $500 a week cop. It's against the law."" That was enough, because the story was not about Calderon. Miami Vice is as much a story about relationships as Entourage on HBO is about relationships and not about moving up the ranks in Hollywood. It is about Crocket and Tubbs, Zito and Switek (Zito is dead in season 1 or 2, I believe). The last episode was decent and reminiscent of season 1. You can see where Michael Mann got the idea for the movie. A lot of it comes from the final episode: Freefall. Crocket and Tubbs go out on a limb to work for the DEA to fly to a Central American nation to rescue a dictator the US gov wants safe (because that dictator knows about official money laundering of Central American drugs). Again...bad guy gets WAY too much time. The story is right on target for its time (Reagan years, Iran Contra...MV episodes were political and they understood the cold war and the drug war in Central America and used it as MV's main narrative). It's just that there are too many important lines given to someone who had little screen time, we don't really know, or like, and he isn't the greatest actor either -- as is the case of the DEA chief and the local police chief working for the cartel. Watching Season Five I now realize how hard it is to find good actors; and how the writing is important, but the acting is even more important. A fine actor can do amazing work with a normal, average script. A fair actor will do a fair job with a fair script and will kill a great script. I don't know which is the case in Season Five. In short, Season Five tries to be too big and when it pulls us away  from the Crocket and Tubbs relationship and their comraderie, we get lost because we long for that in the series. Thats why Freefall, the ending scene, disappoints. Yes, Crocket and Tubbs quit the force and that all makes perfect sense. They get in the car and drive off -- Miami Vice style. It's okay. But instead of playing THE anthem of Miami Vice -- In The Air Tonight -- or even a newer version of the Miami Vice or Crocket theme by Jan Hammer, they play this song that I personally have never heard of and doubt mainstream MV fans have either. It gets played in a montage of season one and two clips, as a homage to the mainstay actors like Olmos and Santiago, who had no more than three lines in the last episode of one of the most innovative cop shows in US television history. That ending montage fell flat for me. It didn't affect the story, but it showed me enough about what to expect in Season Five: it's no season one and two.",1281484800,3,4190,4.289141414141414

The season starts off following the Burnett line, where season 4 left off. What the producers should've done is continued this track for more episodes. It falls off rather quickly and then goes downhill from there. While some episodes have redeeming value, there are others where the writers should have been shot. Yeah, that's rather harsh. But it is reprehensible to treat such good characters in so bad a way. Sonny's sharp clothes? Traded in for ripped jeans. Ugh...

2801542,5,B000OVLMKC,"""Vice"" was without a doubt one of the greatest TV series of all time, and that includes episodes from the final seasons. It is ridiculous to see that so many ""critics"" still to this day dismiss the groundbreaking content that this series delivered long after the early ""hot"" pastel phase of the series gave way to darker, far more serious, far more sophisticated, scary and politically prescient fare. This series nailed the government-covert operations-drug milieu, and it still remains relevant today. Nothing before or since has come close. Frankly, the darker the series got, the better it got. The shaggier and more agonized Crockett became, the better.

Give them credit for continuing to push the envelope. Dirty politics, reflecting both Bush and forecasting Clinton era narco scandals. It was also good to see them stretch, every now and then, into things like Florida's distinctive crime humor with occasional light episode worthy of Charles Willeford and Carl Hiassen. No Jan Hammer? Fine, Tim Truman provided an equally satisfying, grittier sound, that went with the grittier content.

""Freefall"", the series finale, was an absolute masterpiece, capturing everything great about ""Vice"" in a darkest ever movie-length farewell that had Crockett and Tubbs involved in a Manuel Noriega-esque covert operation, and the entire cast of characters, pushed as far as they've been pushed.

The plots are silly. Castillo disappears halfway through the season, only to briefly reappear at the final episode. Don Johnson disappears for several of the final episodes and there is an outright awful pilot about pretty boy young undercover cops that must be endured to be seen.

2801544,4,B000OVLMKC,"This 1988-89 Season was when MIAMI VICE tanked & started becoming more and more obvious that this police drama went downhill and that this show was about to come to end, since this police drama was going stale, going out of style, getting boring, and was starting to get quite a dip in ratings along with the fact that NBC was starting to pre-empty this show a lot during MIAMI VICE's 5th Season run when it became evident by the Winter of 1989 that this police drama wasn't going in the right direction, plus NBC had already cancelled MIAMI VICE prior to when NBC had cancelled this police drama permanently in the Summer of 1989.

In addition to why MIAMI VICE went down the tubes, everything on the show was going stale and it was like this police drama was running out of ideas to make interesting episodes with the plots and conclusions, plus Crockett(Don Johnson) and Tubbs(Philip Michael-Thomas) started losing their touch and the show was running out of steam, so you could say that Miami Vice reached its saturation point, even though this police drama didn't last that long, since it only ran on NBC from 1984-1989, despite the fact that these episodes of this police drama were shown complete & uncut & commercial-free as opposed to how they were shown in reruns on USA, FX, TNN, TV Land, and now COZI-TV, which showed every single episode with too many deleted scenes & too many commercial interruptions.

It's just too bad Universal didn't provide the original air-date listings to each episode like they did with the first 2 seasons of MIAMI VICE

2801550,2,B000OVLMKC,"Season Five of Miami Vice was perhaps the saddest and cynical of all of the series, because you could tell that the end was near, which, of course, was a microcosm of what was happening with the futility of the ""drug wars"" at the end of the '80s. The mood of the country had grown darker, and it was reflected in the faces of Crockett and Tubbs, who both had to know that they were up against overwhelming odds that they could not overcome.
  The frustration that I felt in watching that final season, was in the inconsistencies that I found in the storylines themselves. For one, why wasn't Crockett brought up on charges during his amnesic sojourn in ""Mirror Image?"" Surely, they could've gotten some mileage out of this where a sixth season could've been possible, but they completely missed the boat on that for some strange reason that is still unknown to us. Then, as far as loose ends went, there is still the unanswered question of exactly what happened to the son that Tubbs had fathered with Angelina, Calderon's daughter, back in season Two. I was surprised that there was no resolution to that mystery, which I found to be profoundly disappointing.
  Overall, Switek's gambling issues (fueled in part by a combination of his not getting that plum promotion out of vice/organized crime bureau and mourning over the death of his longtime partner Zito) was a side order that gave viewers a hint that Vice was over and done. Poor Trudy and Gina were virtually nonexistent in Season Five, which was a glaring oversight on Michael Mann's part. But, in the final two episodes, ""Freefall"" it was all spelled out for us in black and white, particularly in the song ""Bad Attitude"" where Crockett and Tubbs are grimly riding off into their final showdown, where the lyrics ""Out of date heroes/With no room to grow"" said it all--that the drug barons of the world, along with their despot/dictator puppets and a complcit U.S. government that is more interested in enabling the drug trade for ""American interests...and what runs counter to them,"" were too powerful and corrupt to be stopped by two idealistic Vice detectives.",1206921600,7,2123,4.776566757493188
2801551,5,B000OVLMKC,"""Miami Vice"" is the greatest cop show of all time and each season has always maintained innovative storylines. Season 5 is one of the strongest seasons of all in my opinion. The first two episodes conclude the Burnett trilogy where Crockett assumed he was his drug dealer undercover alterego. The next episode then features Castillo's personal life and showcases his character in the action very well. A few episodes later we come to ""Bad timing"" with Sonny recovering from his wife's death/amnesia ordeals only to come up against two of the worst baddies ever in vice. Episodes like ""Line of fire"", ""Borrasca"", ""To have and to hold"", ""Miami Squeeze"" and ""Asian cut"" represent straightforward vice at its best and are similar to episodes from series 1-3. On the other hand, episodes like ""The cell within"" (Tubbs reuniting with a sadistic murderer turned author), ""Over the line"" (akin to a similar bad cop episode in season 4), ""Too much too late"" (concluding the Ricardo/Valerie business), ""Hard knocks"" (introducing Stan's gambling problems that would also feature in ""Too much too late"" and ""Freefall""), ""World of trouble"" (concluding the Lombard-Lubrizzi mafia war first raised in season 1) and ""Victims of circumstance"" are all very strong and innovative episodes. More lighthearted episodes include ""The lost madonna"" and ""Jack of all trades"" where the duo face art and sales conmen.

Don't get me wrong, Miami Vice is one of my all-time favorite series.

But Season 5 was pretty much an ""out to lunch"" season.  Totally absent was directorial, musical, or writer innovation.  Don Jonson looked like he was on chemotherapy or some juiced member of a biker gang.  The stories were loud and largely ripped from other (BAD) popular series of the time.  Like the magical ray gun.  Or rogue cops.  The Gambler's Anonymous episode.  Or a Holocaust episode (in the Season of Holocaust Specials, three a year at least by the late 80s).  Etc.

I own now, all five seasons of this show & have been watching selected & favorite episodes from all seasons, and would like to add my additional comments to the others to ""add to the mix!""
Mr. Heeringens"" review briefly touched upon what I would like to expand upon.
Take all of the episodes, and look at them as one large opus, which through drama, supported by music, fashion, and visuals, exhibited how draining and emotionally effecting; the job of fighting the tidal wave of crime, can be on a group of people dedicated to their jobs.  This was mainly done with the character of Sonny; who started as a person who thought that right would always prevail, and who, then from betrayals, loss of loved ones, through divorce, death, and corruption of the system which he had dedicated his life to, became a tired, emotionally drained, shell of the person that he once was.  He no longer cared about his looks; i.e. hairstyle, and clothing. The visuals, music, tones, and colors of this show ever so slightly changed each season, as each character was beginning to be effected by the rising wave of crime & corruption that was overtaking Miami. Sonny was the focal point of this, but all characters showed its effect. I don't think that the actors were ""riding things out""; I think this was all to show how exhausting the job can be! How would you react to losing your wife through divorce?(though they still loved each other deeply); losing another wife through blatant murder, through a system which allowed a psychotic killer to manipulate it to his advantage. This also affects people who you work with day to day, and will change them too! I could go on to other examples, but I think these are some of the more ""life changing"" events, which Sonny experienced.
We have all seen the effect that wars have on people who have served in our Armed Forces, and I have known a few law officers affected & ""burnt out"", after years on the force.
I feel that Miami Vice did an excellent job of portraying the effect of the unending wave of crime, on people dedicated to fighting it, and this was excellently exhibited through its run! Try looking it as a ""Five Act"" show!",1183852800,14,2323,4.619854721549637
2801558,4,B000OVLMKC,"I'm a huge Miami Vice fan and I think season 5 was an improvement over season 4. I have to admit the first two episodes where Crockett has become Burnette was very interesting and they could've played out the story for another episode or two,I think it would've been cool to see Crockett actually complete his plan to take over and eventually Vice would bust him and then he would have remembered who he really is,instead the writers decide to do a complete U-Turn and the next thing you know he's back as Crockett. Honestly though,the moment in ""Redemption in Blood"" when Burnett/Crockett casually walks into the Police station and everyone draws their gun on him was one of the greatest moments in TV history,I totally wasn't expecting that and I was glued to the TV during that moment. It's obvious though as you watch the rest of the season that the show was falling apart and needed to end. I mean,there's a couple of episodes without Crockett,one or two without Tubbs and several back to back without Castillo,who was my favorite character. The strangest episode though was ""Leap of Faith"" which was an entire episode with a whole different cast,I mean,WTF?If this had been decided to be the last season why not dedicate yourself as writers and actors to making it the best season you possibly could. There was some good episodes toward the beginning of the season and then it just went off the rails,until the end episode ""Freefall"".This was a terrific episode and while watching this I had to think to myself,God,why couldn't the writers and actors put forth this much effort to make more episodes this thrilling and well written and directed,what a shame. I must admit I had very mixed feelings about the way it ended. For instance,there was no formal goodbyes said to to Trudy,Gina,or Swytech. And as great of an actor and character Castillo was they could've had a truly great emotional moment with Castillo,Crockett,and Tubbs expressing their respects for Castillo and vice versa. That seemed like the honorable thing to do for the character of Castillo and the fans. And the last scene where Crockett and Tubbs shake hands was way too short and weak. I mean cmon,all they say to each other is I'm going to miss you and briefly shake hands and that's it. These guys were like brothers and for the respect of the show and for the fans that scene should've been longer and more emotional than that. After all the great dramatic greatly written scenes of dialog from these two over the previous seasons(especially from Crockett),it just seemed that the ending scene was less than satisfying.

I used to think season 4 was weak but after watching it now after a long time I found it way better than I remember... hopefully season 5 gives me the same!

After viewing the dvd I have to say the last half of the season was just weak.  I say that because the music just ruined the vibe for me.  Some of the scripts were bad and some were decent but that music was so depressing.  The same guitar riff permiated every episode.  It never had much variation and it did not accompany the episodes at all.  Jan's music was a character in itself.  The last episode was just depressing as all gets.  No music to lure me into a feeling.  Poor quality of production was another reason I was feeling bleck.  The money was indeed not there to support the show by now.  Oh well.  It was a good time to drop it.",1180915200,3,1131,4.190697674418605
2801560,5,B000OVLMKC,"I didn't have to comment with anyone of the comments made about Miami Vice.  MIAMI VICE is what it is, ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL, THE BOMB, SONNY & TUBBS MADE SURE THAT WE WERE IN FRONT OF OUR TV's BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE WENT ON IN OUR LIVES ON ""THEIR NIGHT."" THE MUSIC WAS ON, SONNY WAS ON, CASTILLO WAS ON, RICARDO or RAPHAEL WAS ON & TRUDY (THE ORIGINAL MISS BIG BOOTY, read her name plate on her desk BigBootyTrudy) WAS ON and I don't say that to BE sexist to this critique, if you will...I am a very married straight woman and if I wasn't, SO WHAT! It is what it is! It's just true and I don't want to forget Gina who was always ON also.  Miami Vice is the best thing that ever happened to television.  The movie made with the WANNABEES portraying CROCKETT AND TUBBS WAS A SHAME! I HATED IT AND HAD NO INTENTION TO SEE IT, HOWEVER I WAS TRICKED BY MY HUBBY AND ASSOCIATES.  It would have been nice to see the older Crockett and Tubbs handle the intrigue they wanted or should I say they tried to portray in the different situations in the movie however, they didn't ask fans of the the TV series what we thought and it was TERRIBLE!!  If it wasn't one of a kind then special Television Shows, Movies, Innovative shows from the past would not exist in TVLAND, etc. If it wasn't one of a kind it would not be on at least 5 to 7 different channels at different times everyday of the week.  I am thankful we can buy our DVD's and watch them anytime we wish.  I look forward to the fifth season and I'll embrace it as if it were brand new.  It's so good we have something to look forward to with the DVD's because everything on TV now that is even close to the Miami Vice format is a rip off of Vice.  Watch very close, very close and you will see that Sonny and Ricco had already been there. SORRY, it is what it is and it's TRUTH.  DON'T YOU MISS THE MUSIC.  ROCK ON MIAMI VICE, ROCK ON FOREVER!!!!!  Think about it isn't this why they have TV LAND? TV LAND is for classic television right. THERE IS ALWAYS GROUND-BREAKING TV.  SEE YA OFTEN MIAMI VICE, YOU BROKE THE GROUND. I LOVE YOU ALL 4EVER!  IT MEANT EVEN MORE TO THOSE OF US WHO WERE STATIONED OVERSEAS, SERVING IN THE U.S. MILITARY AT THE TIME IT CAME OUT, WE MAY HAVE STARTED WATCHING MIAMI VICE 1 1/2 to 2 years late but it was well worth it.  WE HAD MIAMI VICE GET TOGETHERS, PIZZA NIGHTS, PARTIES, ETC. AND WE THANK SONNY, RICO, CASTILLO, ETC. FOR MAKING A WHOLE LOT OF OUR FAMILIES GOOD & FUN TIMES HAPPEN, THANKS AGAIN!!!!  P.S.  LOVED YOU TOO NASH BRIDGES, BRING IT ON!  MAYBE TV SHOWS COULD TAKE ANOTHER HINT AND PLAY SOME DECENT MUSIC TO YOUR DRAMAS YOU HAVE ON NOW.  MAYBE I'D WATCH..GOOD LUCK!!

SHOULD I DEFINE ON:  ON IS ON TIME, ON BOARD, ON MY TV, ON IS COOL, ON IS THE BOMB, ON IS WHAT'S HAPPENING, ON IS SOLID, ON IS FUN, ON IS INTERESTING, ON MAKES YOU THINK, ON MAKES YOU NOT MISS AN EPISODE, ON IS THAT MIAMI VICE WAS THE BEST TV AND PURPLE RAIN WAS THE BEST MOVIE, ON IS HOT AND ON IS IF YOU WANT TO SEND A LOT OF NEGATIVE COMMENTS TO ME, SAY I'M CRAZY, SAY IM OUT THERE, GO AHEAD.  I COULD CARE LESS. I'M ON AS YOU READ THIS...HAHAHA.

WITH ALL SINCERITY,

2801561,5,B000OVLMKC,"John Lennon said that before Elvis there was nothing. Of course, apart from a lot of teengroups, this was quite accurate. I would dare  to say that after Vice there has been nothing on tv that could equal, let alone surpass it.
I do NOT agree with reviewers saying that Vice ""overstayed it's welcome by becoming a trendfollower after having been a trendsetter in earlier seasons.""
It is true that indeed, as a reviewer so eloquently put it, ""the mood and feel of the show had shifted away from the pop-electric neon atmosphere of earlier seasons to a darker and edgier tone beginning with the two-part conclusion to the season four cliffhanger ""Mirror Image"" that ended with Sonny, believing that he is his undercover persona Burnett after suffering total amnesia in a boat explosion, races off in a speedboat after killing an undercover detective.""
Of course when Vice as a series progressed in tv time, so did the real decade that Vice was all about (or to use a chiasm; were the 80s about Miami Vice just as well?). The glamour of the earlier part faded away as the 90's with grunge music and a more negative feel were slowly emerging. It might have been a reaction to the glamour of the 80's as is often the case; decades that follow eachother are often like waves. Times do change all the time and so did Vice. Not surprisingly in the 90s and therefore of course the latter part of the 80's (albeit more invisible) the atmosphere would have to reflect somehow in the episodes of Vice as well, and it justly did.
Yes, even Sonny changed to stonewashed jeans and I think it was cool, since it was fitting. I think by then his character and the rest of the world had seen almost every pastel Versace blazer ever made by then, so this more down to earth look still gave a cool answer to the question `what could have been cooler than Sonny in silk blazers?'Well, how about Sonny in jeans? Think of it this way: would it have been fitting, or would it have been almost ridiculous, to have shot season 4 and 5 in the same playful atmosphere as the first three? Come on, Jan Hammer had great soundtracksongs, but the music still continued it's quality. Gloomier atmosphere, gloomier music indeed, but it still was great music, even today, that fitted the shows themselves.
Maybe the reviewers, including myself, cannot get to terms with the fact that in time generations become less and less naive, or in other words, the world becomes more realistic. Something's gained, something's lost. The price for living in more no nonsense times like now is the loss of idealism. The fun  in earlier seasons, with Sonny and Crockett making jokes in happy Florida was lost, but what was gained was a good timing in shifting the mood. Vice rightfully adapted to newer days without being trendfollowers and that clearly showed in the last seasons. What was gained as well was more excitement and action in the series, and I don't see how reviewers saw this as superficial or Vice becoming trendfollowers instead of trendsetters. Still even then, there was no better copshow or thrill than Vice.
The moodshift to more serious stuff to me was also that it seemed to act as a realistic mirror of the hopelessness of fighting the drug force, which it still is to this day. I mean, after so many seasons of fighting the 'vice', what did it amount to? A new episode with a new crime to fight. It had to end, or, the 'ennui' had to be shown in the series, as every good series develops, just like any story plot. It might be true the cast was, as reviewers said, 'riding things out' and things were coming to an end. Exactly, and fortunately this same development, or ennui, which reflected in the series themselves was fitting. Drugs is still impossible to fight, and cops like Sonny and Crockett that did their best in more than 100 episodes were likely to have become burne""tt"" out. Vice had to end, the only question how.
Atmittedly, especially in the last season it spiralled alsmost to the absurdly cool, with enormous white empty villa's and drugbosses in clothes that would make a video of Bryan Ferry look like the clip of 'cotton eyed joe'.
Sonny and Tubbs indeed became more abstract themselves in this weird atmosphere. Some call this 'one dimensional', but the first three seasons had shown enough introspection of the characters I think. And how about Sonny loosing his wife? That was a character-driven plot to me. Overall, the action, the acting and the music (although changed in style) still gave the series that extra over any other tv series at the time. Ok, it had become decadent, but all good things spiral out of control, especially the unforgettable stuff.
I simply thought Vice, and especially the last season was the best stuff our generation had the privilige to see in it's day when it was still new, with the Burnett episodes shot in eerie night blue, his revenge on the killer of his wife and of course the indeed very emotional end. When Sonny drove off in his white car after shaking so shortly the hand of his partner, not only the 80s were lost forever, but also the best show that has ever aired and it would not have been as good as it was without this season. I would like to steal a quote from the booklet of the Stones 2CD 40 Licks by saying: thanks (Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, Michael Mann) for touching our lives. Although people might say it was only tv, on some very rare occasions, tv transcends itself and defines a definite period in time. Vice did! Even though watching it now will never get you back to times lost, still...go for it!",1179878400,59,5573,4.594377510040161
