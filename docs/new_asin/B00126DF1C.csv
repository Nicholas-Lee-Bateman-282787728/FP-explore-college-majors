8244258,4,B00126DF1C,"I am not a Wesleyan, but I readily confess that Charles Wesley was a great man.  This film goes a long way toward instructing the public about the many admirable facets of his life and ministry.  His brother John has certainly gotten most of the acclaim of the two, but I am persuaded that Charles' life was much better balanced.  The number of his hymns is astonishing.

George Whitefield (I'm not sure why they pronounced it 'White - field"") is a great hero of mine, and I wish even more could have been said about the influence Whitefield had on both of the Wesleys.  See Arnold Dallimore's marvelous biography of Whitefield.  The fact that Whitefield and the Wesleys could maintain such warm Christian fellowship to the end of their lives, even in the face of significant theological differences, is a fact much to be commended.

Apart from a few minor points understandable in light of my differing theological perspective, I would recommend this film to all, evangelicals and otherwise.",1349136000,2,993,4.811764705882353
8244259,5,B00126DF1C,"This is a very interesting and enjoyeable documentary of Methodism and the part played by Charles Wesley in it.  There are some short tunes to enjoy.  The production flows well.  It is in a documentary format with narration, still photos and art, and commentaries by theologians. For anyone desiring to learn about the history of Methodism, this is a relaxing way to do it.",1226188800,10,373,4.796875
