8142308,5,B000HXDWY6,"Saartjie (Sarah) Baartman was a very beautiful Khoikhoi woman who was persuaded by her South African employer to go and seek fortune on the stage in early nineteenth-century England. Starting in 1810, he regularly displayed her as the phenomenal ""Hottentot Venus"" in Picadilly's freak shows. After the African Association and abolitionists brought a Court case against him, Sarah (who had been baptized) is taken to Paris by a French animal trainer. She is now displayed in Parisian salons and is brought to the attention of natural history scientists who measure and catalog her in every possible way. Her fame led the Muse d'Histoire Naturelle to ask for her corpse after her untimely death in December 1815. Saartjie Bartman's afterlife as
a scientific specimen raise troubling questions about 19th-century race theories.
I applaud Abdellatif Kechiche for the research he did and the aesthetic choices (especially the casting, the photography, and the narration techniques) he made. His film is really powerful.",1366156800,5,1014,5.383647798742138
8142309,4,B000HXDWY6,"I don't watch mainstream movies as they insult my intelligence so here it goes.
Chicks hot as hell and dress and undress every 5 or so minutes but thats about as far as it goes. Everything else is artificial and in 19th century France  and all music is Russian by comrade Chaikovsky and I am not sure why.
But nice to watch at least once.",1327795200,,338,4.2
8142310,5,B000HXDWY6,"Black Venus is a sultry romp. It is set in the late 19th century France and yet it isn't a heavy, stoic story. It is hot enough for the viewer who Loves hot love scenes.",1282608000,4,169,3.857142857142857
8142311,4,B000HXDWY6,"Movie is higher level B movie.  Not bad, not great, but not a bad movie to watch and the girl that plays Venus, well, it's no wonder she plays the part, she is absolutely gorgeous.",1264809600,2,180,4.142857142857143
8142312,1,B000HXDWY6,"If you like movies that have a thin plot (only sufficient to get the characters from one badly acted scene to the next), amateur actors and little to recommend (apart from plenty of bare flesh) then this is for you.  To call it erotic however is a joke.

If however you like realistic and well acted stories spiced with with nudity and erotic sexiness then try something like ""Original Sin"" (Antonio Banderas), or Zandalee (Nicholas Cage).",1186185600,7,439,4.7631578947368425
