8765565,1,B01HJCCLOY,"Instead of dealing with the legend in a manner to let the audience decide, the story was overlaid with a story of a modern-day charlatan, strongly implying a motive of complete deception.  Whether one chooses to believe the legend or dismiss it as a clever fantasy, the choice is made difficult by this poorly made attempt to protect a very corrupt church of that time period.",1495584000,,376,4.696969696969697
8765566,3,B01HJCCLOY,"My review is of the technical aspects of ""She...Who Would Be Pope"", released by E-T Pictures (Entertainment Treasures).
The menu consists of an abstract screensaver with only the title and a start icon.
There are no chapters, the only way to advance the DVD is by fast forward.
The box states the running time is 116 Minutes. It is actually 111 min ( 1 hr 51 min ).
IMDB states the original ""Pope Joan"" running time as 132 min ( 2 hr 12 min ).
The aspect ratio is 2.31 : 1 when played on my computer, but is displayed as 1.85 : 1 with the sides clipped off on my TV DVD player.
The DVD will not play at all on my Sony portable DVD player.
The contrast of the movie is too dark. In some night scenes only highlights are visible.
There are occasional flecks, flashes, wavering color brightness, and oval time markers in the image.
The audio is 2 channel, and there are no subtitles.
There are occasional pops, ticks, and the crackle of static throughout the movie.
There are no extras. The very end credits listing the restoration crew mentions "" DVD interviews used by permission of John W Henderson / Henderson Film Industries"", so somewhere there may be an edition of the movie with extras.
In spite of the above, I found this movie very entertaining.",1492041600,,1252,4.424242424242424
