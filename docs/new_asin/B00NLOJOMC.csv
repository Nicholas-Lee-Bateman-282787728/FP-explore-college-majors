8678950,4,B00NLOJOMC,"This was a good western and worth watching.  It had a very good cast.  Singing star Dennis Morgan played the lead and Steve Cochran the villain but the one to steal the movie was Patricia Neal as she played the scheming Ann who plays one off the other to get what she wants - the Challon ranch.  Neal matched the hard core style of Barbara Stanwyck in her strong performance as a ruthless woman doing what ever it takes to get what she wants.  Also in the cast was Scott Forbes ""TV's Jim Bowie"" as a banker who she also takes advantage of.",1419465600,6,539,4.203883495145631

8678952,5,B00NLOJOMC,Raton Pass is  one  of those  well  made  Warner Brothers  movies  from  the  past. The  cast is  excellent. The  only  thing  that  would have  made it  better  was if it had  been  filmed in color.  If you love  Westerns  try  this  gem.,1416787200,4,239,4.119047619047619
8678953,5,B00NLOJOMC,"In a sharp black and white print, this Warner release is a fine, very entertaining little Western, featuring a rare appearance in the Western genre by Patricia Neal (she creates an excellent ""bad gal"" here!). Dennis Morgan and Steve Cochran also star. The film has all the hallmarks of quality Warner production...my only complaint is that it was not a bit longer, to flesh out some of the characters and plot line. Nevertheless, this is good, old-fashioned entertainment, well worth an investment. Recommended.

Let's hope this series will continue.....Thanks, Warner.",1415664000,4,569,5.322222222222222
