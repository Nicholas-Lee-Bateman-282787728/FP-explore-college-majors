5738038,5,B00CT1JQG2,Loved the show in the 70's and still love it. Randy Mantooth and Kevin Tighe deserve stars on the walk of fame. They are both fabulous actors.,1382486400,6,142,4.296296296296297
5738039,5,B00CT1JQG2,"This show was on tv when I was a teen. I enjoy it even more now then I did then. The interaction between the actors is wonderful, filled with action, daring, surprise and life lessons. Is truly an inspiration to all who view these shows. I highly recommend these shows to everyone.",1382400000,11,281,4.423076923076923
5738040,5,B00CT1JQG2,"This was always my favorite tv show, and I never thought I could own the
entire series, considering the price of each individual season's dvd sets.
Thanks Amazon for offering the entire series (including the movies) for
under $100.00.",1382313600,4,234,5.0256410256410255
5738041,5,B00CT1JQG2,"After watching the series on television the past few months, and hoping that what we were seeing was public domain copies (damage, frames missing, poorly edited), we took the chance and bought the whole series for a great price. Were we ever pleased with these sets. Although the stock footage showed heavy grain and slight to moderate damage, to be expected, we found the programs themselves to be complete, pristine, and a delight to watch.
  We were slightly concerned with the Universal ""flipper"" discs for Seasons 1 and 2, but the problems encountered from the earliest reviews have been addressed. We are also watching them upscaled through our blu-ray player on a 1080p television. Very nice.
  I would recommend Emergency: The Complete Series to any fan of Johnny, Roy, and the rest of the Engine House.",1382227200,4,811,4.9411764705882355
5738042,5,B00CT1JQG2,This was a fun show to watch when I was young and am enjoying it as an adult. Would recommend these shows to people of all ages if you like the order TV show.,1382140800,,158,3.676470588235294
5738043,5,B00CT1JQG2,"All 3 of our kids started watching this series several years ago and still enjoy re-watching them yet today. Not everything has to be all blood, gore and killing. It is fun to see real type people doing a job and loving what they do. Yes, the vehicles are aged  but who cares. It is nice to sit down and watch something as a family just as I did with my parents.",1379548800,22,362,4.027777777777778
5738044,1,B00CT1JQG2,"I loved this show, but $99 ....oh......my....

This reviewer has coded......push 50 ccs of lactate ringers and get me the crash cart!!",1379289600,10,134,5.090909090909091
5738045,2,B00CT1JQG2,"I watched Emergency when it was new, when I was too young to know what I was watching.  A young mind tends to forget the exposition, the filler, it focuses on the exciting, the potential for something exciting.

Today's eyes would see Emergency as slow, small, and really boring.
Another way to phrase it would be honest, genuine, and patient.

Emergency is a series to be watched by someone who loved the original.  While it is a charming show in it's own way Emergency will not and cannot relate to the new generations that have been raised on ever more intense spectacles.  Some elements are fantastic.  The respect for institutions, for society, the lack of cynicism in it, the characters aren't so much hokey as small.  Interesting but not compelling.

Revisiting the series left me conflicted. I appreciated the era, the cars,  clothing, hairstyles, music, the sincerity, the technical details for the time were accurate but the show never grew beyond it's premise.

P.S. Emergency is the story of a local Firehouse and the every day occurrences they deal with, most of the show is told through the experiences of 2 paramedics, John Gage and Roy DeSoto.

P.S.S. With 120+, hour long episodes and 6, 2 hour long movies you won't be bored from lack of content, Enjoy & good luck.",1379289600,14,1283,4.760180995475113

5738103,5,B00CT1JQG2,This was a forerunner to such shows as Code Black but it is interesting to see how emergency care has evolved,1525996800,,109,4.238095238095238
5738104,3,B00CT1JQG2,Well I was highly pissed this did not say that the emergency final rescues was included. So now my father has 2 of the same DVDs. I did not know until he opened it for his birthday.  Now it's too late to return the extra dvd. Would have been nice to say all the seasons and extras.,1525046400,,281,3.9298245614035086

5738117,4,B00CT1JQG2,"A must-have 70's staple.  I would have given it 5 stars, but as others have noted, some of the episodes are very poor transfers.  Season 3, disc 2 for example, is loaded with dust on the film and more importantly, it just doesn't look close to crisp or dvd-clarity.  Which is funny, because the earlier discs looked really good, imo.  I am watching it chronologically, so I will update this review, as I watch more discs.  This show was a show I grew up on, in prime time (Saturday nights at 7pm I think) and my kids also watched it with me.  They are now involved in the EMS fields.  Too bad today's shows are only concerned about CGI, lesbians, and terrorists.  Times they have changed.",1524268800,,688,4.404761904761905
5738118,5,B00CT1JQG2,Just received these today. So far ... everything is awesome! Counted and made sure that all of the disks were there. The picture quality is just like the tv programs of today. Been trying to get these for awhile. So glad to have them in my collection. The only problem that I've found so far ... is there are two episodes missing ... the one that has Kareem Abdul Jabarr and the one that's shown in the opening credits in seasons 5 and 6. Is there any way to get those two episodes?,1524096000,,482,4.193548387096774

I have not gone through the other DVD's yet, so it is unknown if they even work or not.  Long story short, check your order and make sure you are not ripped off as I was.  I WOULD NOT HAVE EVEN GIVEN IT ONE STAR BUT THAT WAS THE MINIMUM RATING.",1520121600,4,360,3.8904109589041096
5738160,5,B00CT1JQG2,"(english as 2nd language, thanks for overreading mistakes)
The Box contains ALL episodes and seasons incl. ""the final rescues"", all of them are uncut.
Unfortunatly, Season 4's Audio is clipping in quiet all episodes, especially with loud (background) noises as the sirene and horns of the Engines and Squad, or using of tools.  Season 5 and 6 are overscanned, the colors are way to bright.
The other seasons are fine.
The box i got delivered had some damaged DVD-holders, but that may be due to the overseas-delivery.
5 stars for the complete Box and the reasonable price, as that made it possible for me to see the complete series for the first time in my life (german TV stopped in the middle of Season 5, the final rescues were never shown here)
Also, a compliment to amazon, as the delivery only took a few days instead a few weeks!",1519862400,,836,4.610738255033557

Season 1 case broke where you open it. Can't hardly get it open.
Claw broke- DVDS loose and sliding around.

Season 2- DVD holder broke in middle. Can't flip the DVDS back and forth.

Season 4- plastic ripped on front

Season 5- claws broke. DVDS loose and sliding around in case

5738300,4,B00CT1JQG2,"This is still a very enjoyable show and depicts the early years of the paramedic program. Of course comparing it to current shows like Chicago Fire (which also features a Firehouse 51), and Chicago Med, the techniques and the equipment have vastly changed.

 I agree with many of the other reviewers that the latest complete set, which was released in 2016, lacks the picture quality in many of the episodes. The versions on Netflix were of much better print quality. That's why it gets 4 stars. Obvious film spices and imperfections can be seen in many episodes, unfortunately. It does not appear that Universal used the original masters in compiling this complete set. In addition, incorrect opening credit sequences are used throughout with many instances the sixth season opening being used in place of the original openings.

Also be aware the six tv movies are included here. Amazon still insists that they should be bought as two seperate items.",1490486400,2,952,4.9748427672955975

I love how the acting is a bit tight in the pilot movie, but as you get into each subsequent season, the actors become more comfortable and truly grow into their characters.  The historical significance of this television series is also not lost on me whenever I watch it.  What Emergency did for EMS and paramedic programs not only in the U.S. but around the world is unparalleled.  As a kid, I watched every episode on Saturday nights back in the 70's.  And when I take the time to sit down and watch them now, it really is a wonderful sense of reminiscing.  I still can't believe we wore clothes like that.",1490140800,5,709,4.358778625954199

5738320,5,B00CT1JQG2,"My husband and I love this show. We watched it as children and then on Netflix...until Netflix decided to remove it when we were 2/3 of the way through. So, we had to buy the set to finish it. It was the best purchase decision because it turns out, there were episodes missing from Netflix (we discovered due to legal reasons). We watched the entire series and we were so sad when it was finished. We felt like we were saying goodbye to family. We really enjoyed this. Well, except or the final rescue episodes....they were duds. It was not the fault of the series but clearly the result of late effect of drugs and free love of the 60's. There was some weird psychedelic perspectives in the productions. The rescue episodes (except the last one of John and Roy reminiscing) had so little to do with the series it was offensive. Clearly, the producers were trying to engage spin-off series but the acting was horrible, the plots also terrible and the music was perplexing. They inappropriately played happy carnival music during death defying rescues that were way too drawn out. Everything was constantly exploding and people survived inexplicably with no blast injuries. The most unbelievable though was one of the rescue episodes featured a small rickety commuter plane that crashed into a airliner which then crashed into a residential area which JUST SO HAPPENED to have the John and Roy in a house the plane crashed into. Yes, there were many explosions. But most unbelievable was the small rickety plane survived not only crashing the big plane and then plummeting to the ground but then survived crashing into a concrete culvert and the passenger walked away without any major injuries. What? How could everything else blow up but not this plane? I just couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to go along with it all. We just decided that these really don't belong int he series so we mentally exclude all but the last one. Otherwise, it is one of the BEST series ever. We will watch it over and over again because it is that great.",1488931200,5,2038,4.711484593837535

5738326,5,B00CT1JQG2,"Few shows stand the test of time, advancement of technology, social attitudes, and audience maturity. Emergency is one of those shows that is as enjoyable to me now in my 50s as it was when I was less than 10 years old. Its surprising how much I missed when I was that young, and whats more surprising is how much I leaned and still remembers from over 40 Years ago when I saw this show. I do get a surprise guest star such as John Travolta and Cathy Lee Crosby and many others before they became house hold names in the near future.
Current issues at the Time related to Race, Indigenous Americans, Human Rights and Women Lib with some episodes dealing with Female Police Women, Reporters, and Doctors breaking into a Mans World, things we take for granted now. Issues such as drugs taking and the generation gap between parents and children. My Young Teenage kids enjoy the shows and get a surprise and two on how things have changed in 40 to 50 years from the 70s to now.
The interaction between the characters is well balanced and enjoyable. Love the Show!

5738344,1,B00CT1JQG2,"Love the series, 5-Stars for one of my old favorite television shows. This review is not of the show but rather the DVD product quality.

Im giving 1 star because the audio/visual quality is hit-or-miss at best.  Many episodes really appear to be direct copies from either the deteriorated master or used VHS. This is a disservice to fans, especially customers shelling out $80 or so for this box set. While I realize this was not remastered, a LITTLE care to clean up the mess. Color is faded or very orange on many episodes. Muddy picture and sound on others. Some episodes, the audio track is so faded, in order to hear it, the volume needs to be cranked but the sound effects, e.g., sirens or music nearly blasts the viewer out of their seat!

EX:  Disc 1:  Wedsworth-Townsend Act is acceptable but Mascot & Botulism are fuzzy & the red really overpowers.  In some episodes,  I actually caught a few production markers.  Most episodes are riddled with anomalies and video noise which really is not that difficult to fix.  Discs 4 & 5 contain some of the worst examples.

I must add that the clips used for previews look very well restored, a shame they couldn't put even half the effort into the rest.

Bottom line is, had Great-tv-shows .com taken just a little time and care, this would have been better quality. Granted, it would cut a little into their overall profit but if they just spent a little more time and yes, money, they probably would have seen better profit in the long run. The old saying Bad press speaks louder than good applies here. This was pretty blatantly You want your favorite shows on DVD, here you go with high prices to boot. Since I received this set as a gift, I won't be so crass as to return it. Since these are watchable, if many barely so, I am thankful to at least have access to this series.

EDIT: 4/19/2017 ~ I've been running through the series disc by disc and really have to point out how TERRIBLE Season 4 transfer is. Greattvshows.com REALLY should be ashamed of themselves for the lack of quality and sloppy editing.  Episodes really are nearly unwatchable. I could not even make it through Disc 3, let alone skipping through much of the other two. Volume is low, picture is unbearably poor, nearly ""pirated"" quality. At the VERY least, I think they should go back and clean up the master and reproduce Season 4 and send replacement copies to everyone that owns this!

(It's unfortunate that Amazon lists ""Verified Purchases"" as if everyone else's opinions who received as gifts or purchased elsewhere do not matter. This was bought from Amazon,I'm just not about to tell her how disappointed I am with this, she would feel like I don't appreciate the gift, which I do, I just don't appreciate the quality (or lack thereof) put into this DVD set!)",1486598400,11,2796,4.588353413654619
5738345,4,B00CT1JQG2,"The production value on this series is incredible, the stories are well told and gives a true appreciation for the real heroes that live among us everyday and are literally just a phone call away. This series brought the paramedic service around the entire world by exposing the benefits. It also highlights the perils of not having access to the emergency services. Several episodes highlight issues the emergency services encounter such as people who fail to yield to emergency vehicles or interfere with a rescue. Some episodes get a little preachy, but most are told in a straightforward manner. The people of Station 51 and Rampart General Hospital are representatives of those people who will rescue and protect you and your loved ones in your city, village, neighborhood, wherever you are.

In classic Universal Studios style, the episodes tend to end with a large explosion or other somewhat exaggerated rescue that most fire departments will encounter less frequently than once a week. Additionally, some very out-of-the-ordinary types of rescues are shown - Rescue from a nuclear disaster, rescue from dangerous and exotic animals, etc. Watching this series can help you understand the perils you have in your own neighborhood.

Also, the series has a tendency to encourage you to understand when to call emergency services, how to perform CPR and use AED, to keep disaster preparedness kits in your cars and homes. However, this show is not instructive on how to perform techniques, and no attempt should ever be made to perform hazardous actions, such as the ""precordial thump"", without proper training. Information on lifesaving techniques can be found at the American Heart Association's website.

The reason for the four star rating is simply the poor quality of the print on these discs. When this show was on Netflix, they used a high quality print that was clear and sharp with no dirt, no scratches, very clean audio. (Cultural references, styles, and technology aside, you could have believed that was produced just a few years ago.) In contrast, this was made from a moderate to poor video transfer. There are a lot of scratches, the audio is only so-so. The poor quality is beyond simply the difference between high definition and standard definition video. If you were hoping for a clean print this is not it.",1486598400,6,2332,5.036269430051814

5738365,5,B00CT1JQG2,"I have been a fan of Emergency! since I was a young kid. I was too young to enjoy it when they were still filming the series, but enjoyed watching it in syndication, starting in the late 70's. This is my favorite TV show from that decade!! I have been currently watching this show on METV.  When the Complete Series of this show became available, I bought it, and enjoyed going through the DVD s. There have been a couple of issues though. First of all, unlike the episodes that they have been showing on TV, the ones on the DVD have not been digitally restored and, sometimes, there are some glitches.  The Episodes from Season 6 onward are in better quality though.  The Second issue: although they show the crossover episode from ""Adam-12"" where characters from ""Emergency!' briefly appear, it is sad that it does not contain the episode of the short-lived TV series ""Sierra', in which Gage and Desoto appear. That episode is absolutely fascinating and would had been a great bonus to the package. It was likely left out because""Sierra"" has never been released on DVD and might never see the light of day. Oh well, I should not complain, as it has been a real treat to see these episodes at my beckon call, and it is worth buying.",1478822400,8,1233,4.520179372197309

I'll wait until the release,  and see if those who purchased before me will have the answer.",1462579200,3,461,4.3882352941176475
5738391,4,B00CT1JQG2,"I miss this show I grew up with. I'd love to pick it up but I can't see spending that kind of money on such an oldie. Contrary to the reviewer above me, I think single-side disc is the worst format to realease TV on DVD. TV shows take up a lot of space. The manufacturers are often determined to make the packaging compound the problem. I do everything I can at home to reduce the amount of room I need to devote to my DVD/BluRay collection, and manufacturers would get a lot more of my money if they scaled down packaging and switched over to dual side formats. It would be cost effective for both parties and the money I save would mean me buying a lot more of their products.

The Complete Series and where it says Frequently Bought Together it has Emergency! The Final episodes DO NOT BUY!!! The Final Rescues is included in the Complete Series package so please don't be a dummy like me and inadvertently buy The Final Rescues twice, please.

5738400,3,B00CT1JQG2,"This rating is for the DVD transfer and not for the series itself, which rocks.  Whomever did the DVD transfer for Season 4 ought to be ashamed of themselves.  It's like they purposefully went and located the worst super-8 film copy and took it to Walgreens for a transfer.  It's chock full of film scratches and artifacts all over the screen.  The audio quality sounds like you're listening to it underwater.  Emergency is currently airing on MeTV, so I've been watching and comparing the same episodes aired OTA.  The copy that MeTV is airing is far superior with no scratches and decent audio.  I ended up having to turn the subtitles on while viewing my DVD, because while even blasting the volume you could not understand what the actors were saying.  I'm not sure if the rest of the seasons are like this, 1-3 were OK but I haven't binged to 5 and 6 yet.  Whoever packaged this for sale (great-tv-shows.com???) should be forced to do it again and give the customers that paid too much for this a decent copy!",1433030400,36,1014,4.558011049723757

I was so excited to get the entire series on DVD. You can tell that it is older a  the quality isn't the best but it is at least 5 times clearer and better sounding than on TV.

5738416,3,B00CT1JQG2,"This show did more for public acceptance of pre - hospital care than any other media type blitz could have ever done. I was a dustoff medic in VN, 1966 - 1968 and it was very gratifying to come home and be involved in getting people treated during the ""golden hour"" and seeing many survive who otherwise would not have . Our EMS system today is the product of those times.
That being said, I'd really love to own this series because the reruns have disappeared from my local TV, but the current Amazon price of close to $190.00 is way, way too high. I'll wait and if the price comes down from the stratosphere I'll revisit this review.
Until then, I'll start an IV with Colombian hi-test coffee, sit back and relax.
NOTE: I'm giving only the 3 stars, not for the content, but for Amazon's exorbitant pricing. If the price comes down, I'll be happy to go higher.",1389830400,,861,4.3875
5738417,3,B00CT1JQG2,"This series features the adventures of the paramedics of L.A. County Fire Dept. Station 51, Johnny Gage(Randolph Mantooth) and Roy Desoto(Kevin Tighe). Together they respond to emergencies ranging from false alarms to major disasters. As at this time, the Paramedic program, which is designed to keep emergency patients alive long enough to get to medical facilities, is still a relatively recent service, the paramedics must be guided by licensed medical personnel through radio contact on site.

This is where the staff of Rampart Hospital come in with doctors Kelley Brackett(Robert Fuller) and Joe Early(Bobby Troupe) as well as Head Dixie Nurse McCall(Julie London) providing the necessary instructions for the paramedics to do their jobs. In addition to that, we see the work of the medical staff on their own as deal with the medical problems they encounter.

Race to the scene with paramedic Squad 51 and the emergency staff of Rampart Hospital with the complete series of EMERGENCY! With 6 action-packed seasons, this engaging series by Jack Webb whom is best known as Sgt. Joe Friday of DRAGNET, stars Kevin Tighe and Randolph Mantooth as heroic paramedics and is loaded with all the suspense, humor and heart-tugging decisions that could only come from real-life drama.

Rediscover the show that pioneered realistic television portrayals of everyday life-savers in all 124 thrilling episodes and television specials in this 25-disc collection pertaining to EMERGENCY's 5-year run on NBC, from 1972-77.

8585972,3,B00CT1JQG2,"Emergency! is not only classic 70's TV, it's a series that literally changed how fire departments handle medical emergencies. Few people knew what a ""paramedic"" was before Jack Webb and his team made them famous. It's great to see the entire series in one box, including the final movies. *However*--it's marred by a shameful presentation of Season 4. Most of the episodes are from dirty, scratched 16mm syndication prints--in some case, horribly damaged film. The degradation of video and audio is what you'd expect in a 16mm reduction print. The entire series was digitized years ago from the original 35mm negatives, so why not present the best available? Also, the syndication prints carry the 5th season opening titles, not the original. So they're not only horribly damaged 16mm reduction prints, they're also mangled from the original release prints. Far below the standard that DVD series buyers have come to expect. Ironically, the final episode of season 4: ""905-Wild"", a ""backdoor pilot"" for another Webb series--is a 35mm transfer with the correct opening titles Finally, Season 5 Disc 1 starts with 5 minutes or so of commercials for other series, WHICH CANNOT BE SKIPPED!
