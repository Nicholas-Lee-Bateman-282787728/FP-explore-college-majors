8423623,4,B004CTGACM,"Intersting sequel.  High paced and full of twists and turns.  The ending was crazy was hard to get.  Need to rewtch the end again to understand all the character evil connections.  It had to be hard to follow in the path of October Moon which was excellent.  Its tough when you lose all but one of the main characters in the last minutes of the prequel end, and then lose the final characer goine in the first minute of the sequel.  Bravo!  Very exciting, fun movie.

Yes, we should have seen Eli naked!!!  Damn he's got great biceps, delts, and abs!!",1528502400,,551,4.376237623762377
8423624,1,B004CTGACM,"A film filled with love, loss, revenge, a mothers' love was what i was hoping for, instead it appears that someone walked through some horse poop, scraped it off their shoe, and slapped it on some film.  horrible acting, sets, sound, and absolutely terrible camera work.",1515801600,,270,4.869565217391305
8423625,1,B004CTGACM,"1 1/2 Stars. Convoluted...no where near as good as it's prequel, October Moon, which I consider to be one of the better low-budget films I've watched, with a good plot, locations, and excellent acting.  During the first two-thirds of November Son, the movie just meanders about, with the last third being somewhat better. Again, I really enjoyed the first movie as it was more probable in nature, with most everyone knowing characters (and situations) they could relate to in real life. November Son is more like a B-grade horror movie with an unrealistic plot, and acting that was very sophomoric at times. It's a shame the sequel lacks in all departments. Spoiler alert: just like in the first movie, the ""good"" guy with a heart dies at the end. Sorry to say this falls into the category of films where the gay lead/s end up dead...like their not capable of having an HEA. Sad, especially considering this is where the director wanted to take both of these movies...making a conscious decision to do so. I so want to tell him that it does not make a movie more memorable or ""better."" Just the opposite, it's a bummer, making me more inclined to avoid his future work (if I want to be depressed, I'll watch the nightly news).",1497830400,,1226,4.649769585253456

8423627,4,B004CTGACM,"October Moon 2, to my surprise, managed to be almost as good as the first one. It has a very complex, twisted plot that had me scratching my head at some points and asking myself what was going on exactly. But it's all wrapped up in the end and I was surprised to find out who the villian was. And it's always nice to see Debbie Rochon and Brinke Stevens, two of my favorite actresses. There's no nudity in this this, but there is some male candy courtesy of the actor who plays ""Eli"". He is shirtless several times. An interesting watch!",1475712000,,538,4.284313725490196
