The story line ,which seem to attempt  to  address some popular issues of the day ,was weak and often predictable! Too many cliches!!!A pure waste of time and money.",1484870400,,249,5.048780487804878

8565746,3,B00BC1UP8I,"Not much depth to the storyline.  Not much follow up to assist in the help that is needed for these women individually.  They just keep bickering and the true value of developing deeper relationship and friendship is missing.  Also lacking in compassion.  The 'slap in the face' showed lack of trust yet no healing was followed up with proper reconciliation and counseling.  Different backgrounds which is good to show different needs, but there is no development and growth as Christians to show maturity as Church Wives.",1374019200,5,522,5.023255813953488
8565747,2,B00BC1UP8I,"I have seen many low-budget, independent films. As long as the acting and the story line are good, I can enjoy them. That was not the case for Church Wives. This movie was horrible, I cannot believe that I wasted my time and money on this garbage. Do not rent this movie. The actors were horrilbe.
This could have been a great movie, if Tyler Perry would have produce it.",1371427200,5,371,4.314285714285714
8565748,3,B00BC1UP8I,"It's ok. I thought the movie would have been better.  It touched on domestic violence, drug addiction, impulsive marriage as the character was very materialistic.  She wanted a Mr. Right now and was very quick to marry.  Another character was verging on being a super busybody.  The movie was just okay for me.",1369440000,3,310,4.7924528301886795
