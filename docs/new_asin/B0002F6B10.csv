2090179,5,B0002F6B10,"I really like this workout. I found the pacing just right and the information superb. This is one workout video that I can actually follow. I didn't know anything about pilates before I saw this DVD, but the techniques I saw really speak to me. I am going to incorporate these exercises into my current program. I thought the instructor was wonderful, even if she is my beautiful sister. Great job Tracey!",1095897600,12,405,4.638888888888889

The next day, I thought I will be terrible but I feel a little pain not to bad. I recommend it.

2090208,5,B0002F6B10,"I bought this after reading reviews about the ""inexperienced"" Pilates person. Turns out I'm more experienced then I thought. It's still a good work out for beginners and maybe intermediates. Hardcore folks won't find it beneficial.",1382832000,,231,5.444444444444445

2090213,5,B0002F6B10,I have used this DVD for years. It is a great workout without being overdone. I am now in my 50's and still enjoy doing it about three times a week. I find Tracey very easy to follow and think she explains things well.,1354406400,,218,3.977272727272727
2090214,4,B0002F6B10,"I really enjoyed the standing pilates routine.  I am always sweating by the end of it and the ballet moves are really fun to do.  I use the standing routine on the 1st half of the DVD regularly.

I did not like the mat workout at all. I did not feel like I my abs were well stretched or worked during the mat routine. I prefer Denise Austin's 20-minute pilates mat workout.  (I just wish Denise's voice didn't remind me of Jim Carrey's Vera De Milo impersonation.)",1346025600,,464,4.2988505747126435

It's very manageable and will set you up to get into shape. The initial standing exercises are gentle and thorough.  The mat exercises are very effective and will help you build you build core strength GENTLY.",1340928000,,376,4.253521126760563
2090236,5,B0002F6B10,"I've never done Pilates before and was always a little hesitant to try it because it looked like it was all about toning an no aerobics or cardio.  But when I saw this dvd at my local library and it said Pilates For Weight Loss, I decided to try it.  I have no Pilates experience ever (I have done other cardio workouts before, but nothing past the beginner/low intermediate level) but was able to follow this workout well.  I like how the host demonstrates the move before having you try it (and also lets you hold a somewhat comfortable position while waiting for her instruction).  The pop-up tips (which I suppose is standard for the ""For Dummies"" workouts) ranged from nice to annoying, depending on when they occurred, but they did have a voice-over saying the tips so that you didn't have to look up from an awkward position to read it yourself.  The host also does a very good job of reminding you to breath, keep the core muscles engaged (naval to spine), and to keep the moves as smooth as possible.

I did have trouble holding the planks due to lack of upper body strength (though I don't know if I was doing it completely right) and doing some of the mat work where I was on my stomach because my larger chest got in the way.  The video does offer modifications to some moves, both to make certain ones easier or to make them more challenging.  I always like workouts that suggest modifications for those of us who have trouble with the original move.  For example, a standard modification for a move that uses both arm and leg motions can be to omit the arm movements.  The key is to keep moving.

The dvd has a 20-minute standing workout and then a 15-minute mat workout.  By the end of the standing workout my muscles felt tired, so I was a little less coordinated by the time I got to the mat work, but it was all doable.  Overall good pacing, good instruction, good reminders, and effective moves.",1340323200,2,1914,4.434285714285714
2090237,5,B0002F6B10,I love this work out.  It has helped me keep my back in shape.  I have Osteophorsis and must keep exercising to keep it in check so this really works well for me. I am not trying to loose weight but have so it works well for weight loss also.,1332115200,,242,3.82

Turns out... I LOVE IT!  All the reviews are right on the money with this DVD.  I usually do the 30 Day Shred w/Jillian Michaels which is a great workout video but it's grueling and I just don't feel like subjecting myself to that beating every day!  This pilates DVD is 35 mins... when I got done I felt like I had only been doing it for 15 mins lol!  My heart rate was up, I could feel the burn and I was sweating (mostly ""after"" the workout) but I was relaxed and didn't feel like I hardly worked out.  When I say that, it's not because I couldn't feel it, but it was relaxing, the whole thing in general.  Tracy is fantastic and I plan on buying more of her DVD's.  I'm also buying this again today for my mom, think she'll love it as well.  Enjoy it!",1309478400,,925,4.005464480874317

I got the dummies cause I like to learn basics, I don't always catch on quick and hate flailing around while the DVD continues without me. This DVD is amazing. I have done it four days in a row, it is almost an addiction already because I feel the workout. I am inspired by the grace I have been walking with the last few days and my summer time goals actually feel attainable. Don't be turned off by the dummies title... this is an awesome awesome workout and if you don't sweat like hell after, you are either 1. in really good shape or 2. not trying hard enough. Good luck and enjoy!",1307923200,2,687,4.134328358208955
2090243,3,B0002F6B10,"I was given this DVD because it was GOOD FOR ME. I need something to tone me up, or so I have been kindly informed by thoughtful people.

Believe me, there is nothing I so much enjoy in this world as to be told that something IS FOR MY OWN GOOD. Oh, yeah.

And I must say that the DVD looked good as it sat on my desk for all those months. People would see it, pause and pass by smiling, warmed by such clear evidence that I was doing something FOR MY OWN GOOD. And it looks almost as good on the shelf where it now resides. It makes my feel no end of virtuous.

And I fully intend to take it down. One of these days. Soon. Oh, very soon. After all, it's FOR MY OWN GOOD. Unfortunately, before I can really get to it, there are all those important tasks that must be attended to. Those pencils really do need sharpening. And that novel I began in 1983 is calling insistenly. And the garden, oh, yes, the garden.

Well, you know how it is.

But I'll get there, don't you doubt it, and I know I'll enjoy it, just as I have been so kindly and so authoritatively told I will--because it's FOR MY OWN GOOD!",1285027200,2,1101,4.0091324200913245
2090244,5,B0002F6B10,"I was always really athletic during high school and did yoga quite often, I wanted a work out that wasn't going to kill me but that would also tone me up and maybe shed a few pounds. This workout is Amazing! It flows very nicely and gets you sweating pretty quickly, I do is so often I have it memorized. Tracey explains everything well and gives you reminders at the right time to make sure you are doing the exercise properly. I gained some weight a while ago and remembered I bought this (for really cheap compared to other dvds) and since I have been dieting and doing this on a regular basis I have lost weight, so much that other people have even noticed! Overall, a good workout that is for people that want to stick with it, the first time may be a little hard, but it gets easier!

This workout is also good for beginners or people who have been out of the exercise loop for a while as it is easy enough to tackle but you still feel like you got a good workout.  If you are a regular exerciser this won't be a huge challenge for you, however, because the workout is so nicely done, it is still worth using on a light day or, as I do, at night to supplement your morning exercise - to burn some extra calories, get in some extra toning - especially abs and legs - and it will leave you feeling more refreshed unlike a more intense workout that can leave you feeling wired at night.",1274313600,,745,4.054421768707483

Tracy is very plesant to listen to and she describes the moves very thouroughly.  It's not a high impact video but it does get my heart pumping during the standing portion.  It's only 30 minutes total so it's probably not enough if you're looking for cardio, but it's a wonderful way to change up your routine.

I hate sit-ups and crunches because I stress my neck and shoulders.  The floor mat part of this DVD introduces so many alternatives to work the ab muscles - LOVE IT!!!
It is very much Pilates for beginners (like me).  Not only am I out of shape but I lived a very sedentary lifestyle with lots of TV watchign.

2090312,5,B0002F6B10,"I'm 46 years old and though I'm on my feet all day and moving around, I'd noticed that I was groaning every time I had to bend down to pick something up off of the floor. My knees and legs were behaving as if they belonged to someone else and weren't all that interested in listening to what my brain told them to do. So, I went in search of an exercise routine that wouldn't require me to start out by using heavy weights or bouncy balls - both of which you need muscles and coordination to use. If I had those, then I wouldn't need to exercise! Anyway, I found Tracey's wonderful workout dvd and I couldn't be more pleased with how it's making me feel already - just in two weeks!
Each exercise is broken up into small sets. You don't feel like you've been doing the same routine over and over and over until you're ready to just switch it off and go have a bowl of ice cream. She keeps things moving and you really don't feel like you're working too hard, even though your heart's pumping and the sweat starts trickling down your face.
You end the workout feeling like you've had a real workout but not feeling like you'll ""never do that again!"".
I feel like my body is moving more fluidly and I can bend over without groaning. My legs and knees aren't ignoring me anymore, either!

Yes, I highly recommend this workout for people who are starting out with pilates, or just starting out with exercising, period! It will help loosen you up, get you a bit stronger and ready for more challenging exercise if you so desire!",1222300800,2,1523,4.325174825174825

2090314,5,B0002F6B10,"I just did this program a few minutes ago and wanted to review it while it was fresh in my mind.

I've been working out regularly for well over 20 years using a variety of disciplines. I also have enjoyed using ""media"" (VHS/DVD's) at home for many of those years along w/ working out at gyms.

I find it always interesting to see how various teachers put together exercise programs and the variations they use to challenge your body in different ways. Variety in exercise helps keep workouts fun and actually makes them more effective since you're body isn't always doing the same movements.

This program starts w/ 20 minutes of standing work which incorporates a lot of plie' type work which really targets your lower body. While lower body work like this isn't really ""cardio"" (in terms of challenging your aerobic or anerobic system very intensely), you still burn calories since you are using larger muscle groups.

The last 15 minutes of the program is mat based pilates. It's not the classical sequence (no ""hundreds"") but there are still several familiar mat exercises (""rolling like a ball"", ""single leg stretch"", a variation on ""teasers"" etc.).

I found Tracey Thompson to be an upbeat, yet not overly perky, teacher who explained things clearly and demonstrated beautifully! Also, the ""dummies cues"" were well done in terms of providing options and tips without becoming overly distracting.

This program had a great flow. It moved along better (IMO) than the ""Pilates for Dummies program"" w/ Michelle Dozois. This is not to knock that program or Ms. Dozois who is an excellent teacher. That other program did need more explanation due to the nature of the exercises, so it's understandable that it had less flow. Still, this workout w/ Tracey Thompson, has a flow that I believe would be more enjoyable to use more long term.

I highly recommend this workout for any level because even though I'm an advanced exerciser, this workout isn't exactly like any other workouts I have. This stimulates your body's neuromuscular system in a different way. Also, for an advanced exerciser it can be used as more of an ""active recovery"" type workout, just enough challenge to stimulate your body without overdoing it.

For a beginner, while they might find it somewhat challenging, you can always modify moves to accomodate your current level of fitness and build up to harder versions of the exercises as you feel more comfortable. NEVER try to do more than you can do if your form suffers, just find a way that is enjoyable and comfortable for you while giving yourself enough of a challenge so that your body will adapt and improve.

 Highly Recommended!",1213660800,5,2659,4.875831485587583

A lot of my weight is in the middle, so I thought that anything that works the core would be a good thing. I love that I can do this barefoot with NO equipment. I feel leaner, longer and stronger after doing it. This is a no frills workout with a pleasant instructor. One slightly annoying thing that happens is that just as she is changing a move, the camera zooms in on one part of her body, so you are not really sure what to do with the rest of yourself until you see the bigger picture.

2090340,5,B0002F6B10,"I'd never tried Pilates before buying this DVD, and I was amazed by just how much you feel the workout. The DVD is a little over a half an hour long covering stand up moves the first half, and floor moves the second. The stand up moves actually go into a lot of cardio, and the first time I tried it, I worked up a sweat. The moves are pretty simple and if you're like me who has very little balance and flexibility, this will be good for you. The floor moves were harder, and there were a few that I just couldn't do very well because I'm not strong enough yet. But I have to say, the next day I was in SO MUCH PAIN! I was shocked at just how much I'd worked when I really didn't feel it while I was doing it. Every part of me hurt, and that's a good thing. It told me it really did what it was meant to, and it worked a lot of muscle groups I'd never worked before. I also really liked the instructor. She seemed patient, and very thorough with her explanations of the moves. She also wasnt' overly happy or fake. I also liked that it was just her, and no other people in back of her. I'd rather just focus on the instructor because I find others in the background to be distracting.

Yesterday I tried this dvd out and was hoping that my abs would be sore, but I barely worked them. I did the exercises and breathing as instructed; maybe the intensity needs to be higher?

The only time I feel muscle pain (during this workout) is with one position (lying on my side)that is only about one minute of the video.  I am sure it doesn't hurt others and with a mat it's not as bad.

I tried this out with several friends and they all love it!!  It is amazing that you can really feel the difference when it seems you are hardly even moving.  One of our favorite things about it is that we feel more awake throughout the day and do not feel exhausted afterward, a complaint I've always had after exercising.

I love how short it is - no excuses for not doing it almost every day!

It's fun!  Well, mostly -- the beginning is difficult (hmmm... how many squats/""plies"" can I do in rapid succession before my thighs, hips, or knees give out on me?), but I still actually look forward to this routine.  It seems to lean more toward the dance-type moves than just exercises, even more than the (admittedly few) other Pilates DVDs I've seen.  Also, she doesn't make you do so many of any one given exercise that you get bored -- or she adds moves or changes the routine slightly, so you feel like you're doing a different exercise (which you kind of are).  And the clincher, of course -- it's having an effect on my weight & muscle tone.  The instructor is a pleasure -- very likable, and her movements are very graceful.

My only complaint would be that I could use a bit more instrucction on the right positioning for each movement but that might be hard to do without slowing down the solid but comfortable pace of the workout.  For example, on one of the mat exercises, I realized just a couple days ago that I didn't have my legs quite right and studying her position better made a big difference.

I do modify some of the floor work since I cannot lie flat on my back right now but the standing portion is excellent. All this to say that if a 6 month pregnant lady can do this and feel great, then anyone can. I would suggest that you do some additional back stretching when you are finished each time.

Her explanations are clear, and easy to understand without being patronizing.

The video has two parts: twenty minutes of stand-up, cardiovascular stimulation, and fifteen minutes on the mat. The mat work has some nice stretches and good ab exercises. Go easy on yourself when starting this video. It can be difficult at first. The effort is worthwhile.

Remember; don't be disappointed if you don't lose a lot of weight with this video. You will gain muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat.

The 20-minute standing part of the DVD involves a quick warm up and then the routine with lots of step-and-bends which can be tough on the knees if your feet aren't facing the correct direction. Also, there are lots of arm movements which can be quite tiring on the arm muscles. The 15-minute mat work can be very effective on your abs and buns if you're using the correct posture and I find that after the first few moves, my abs are burning.

This DVD has given me better posture, balance, and stamina. I find that even just walking down the street, I want to tighten up my stomach and work out my abs because of this video.

It moves at a quick pace and the only equipment you might need is a chair.  I have lower back problems and I was able to do most of the exercises whereas other Pilates routines are often too tough for me.
