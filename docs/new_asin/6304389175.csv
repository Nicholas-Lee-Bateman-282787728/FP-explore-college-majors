857276,4,6304389175,"SSSS makes up in suspense and b-movie star power what it lacks in production values. Strother Martin is a classic 2nd string villain. Dirk Benedict, you might remember him from battlestar or A-Team. And the female  lead,Heather Menzies, played one of the Von Trapps in the Sound of Music.  She was also in Captain America with Reb Brown,who has a small part in this  movie too!

857432,5,6304389175,"This is one of my favorite retro,campy, creature features. This was released in 1973. Starring the very handsome (Dirk Benedict) who later went on to star as Face on (The A Team). The effects were quite impressive for the time period and visually effective.

It wasn't scary but the story was good and you as a viewer really felt sorry for the fate of Benedict's character (David Blake) as he was slowly and graphically turned into a king cobra. My favorite part was the storyline about the assistant before David who was half snake ,half man and sold to a freak show as an attraction.

He was so freaky looking and made such heart wrenching sounds. I love anything to do with freak shows. I think most horror\Syfy lovers will really get into this. It actually still holds up today.",1483401600,2,782,4.578571428571428

857435,4,6304389175,"And here we have from 1973 one of the silliest but most fun movies of the 70's. When you view this (and you will view this) you have to take it as silly and campy fun. Except for Dirk Benedict (who is the very best in this) everyone else is way over the top. One interesting note the snakes and the handling were all real. the fun everyone else is having is infectious, there is no doubt you will know what is going on and you just have to go with it. No mystery here all is vey obvious. As I said the actors aren't the greatest but for the best actor....Dirk Benedict and for the worst.....Heather Menzies as the daughter/romantic interest. She is really bad! All the other actors including the snakes and the mongoose and the bunny were just having fun. Not for everyone.....you have to be able to not roll your eyes.",1467417600,2,819,4.290322580645161
857436,2,6304389175,"The fear of snakes is one that goes right to the core of our human nature. Creepy-crawlers, who slither and hiss, will always invoke a visceral reaction. So, when you watch a film like ""Sssssss"" and your reaction is to yawn, you know things are not working.

The story revolves around a less-than-sane doctor (played by Strother Martin), with a more-than-healthy fascination with snakes, who uses his lab assistant (played by a very young Dirk Benedict) in an experiment to turn a human into a snake. Albeit, without the assistant's knowledge.

The premise seems sound enough, even if a bit hokey. But it is so badly developed and delivered, that it lacks any of the scares or dramatic punch that some 70's kitsch should have. The reasoning behind the doctor doing this is never made very clear. His motivation almost feels like an afterthought, once it is revealed. There's a romance with the doctor's daughter (played by Heather Menzies-Urich, who is named as Heather Menzies here) and the assistant, which never really goes anywhere. Even when the doctor forbids it, you never really get the sense that any of it means anything, as it all come to nothing. There the stereotypical bully jock and snooty colleague, which the doctor does in with some snakes, but neither of these deaths brings any real scares. All the while, the story just plods along and you never really care. And in the end, the doctor is done in by his own stupidity and the assistant suffers a fate we are left to never know, as the ending of the film, with the daughter screaming in horror, is as perplexing as it is abrupt.

There really isn't a lot here to give you any real sense of dread or fear. The snake handling in the film, as almost all the scenes of them were of actual real snakes, is a bit interesting at times. And the doctor's ""dance"" with a king cobra is probably the best scene in the film. But even Dirk Benedict's performance can't save this turd (although, since this in one of his first acting gigs, he might not have developed the roguish charisma we've come to know and love from him).

In the end, ""Sssssss"" is all hiss and no bite. It's hard to believe anyone was actually scared by this in 1973, much less that anyone today would be. It's harmless fare, that anyone over the age of five could never see as frightening, but which is ultimately pointless and disappointing. You'd get more chills watching the snakes in your local zoo. In short, this film Sssssssucks!",1464739200,,2465,4.621004566210046

857639,3,6304389175,"Released in 1973, the curiously titled ""SSSssss"" is about a modern Frankenstein-type (Strother Martin) who experiments with snakes and human beings in the desert hills of Southern California. David (Dirk Benedict) is hired by Dr. Stoner (Martin) as a lab assistant after his previous lab assistant mysteriously went missing. As the youth falls in love with Stoner's daughter, Kristina (Heather Menzies), the doctors begins injecting David with some king of snake serum.

This is a pretty decent horror flick that has the early 70s written all over it, but I can't give it a higher rating because it comes off as a TV movie more than a theatrical release. Remember the TV movie ""Gargoyles"" from 1972? ""SSSssss"" has the same tone and look, but it's not as good even though it was theatrically released. Why? Because ""Gargoyles"" has a better topic and, at only 74 minutes, it lacks the padding of ""SSSssss."" Still, there's enough good in ""SSSssss"" to make it worthwhile for those who like these kinds of movies. There are a couple of carnival scenes, which are always good for horror flicks.

Martin is effective as the mad doctor and Reb Brown as a pompous jock, but Benedict and Menzies come off bland as the youthful lovers. Then again, they're playing intellectual college nerds so I'm sure that's how their characters were written. Nevertheless, IMHO Menzies is pretty forgettable here; she's better in 1977's ""Piranha."" Kathleen King plays the only notable babe, but her part isn't much more than a cameo. Needless to say, bad job on the female front.

The film runs 99 minutes and, although there is no listing on IMDb was obviously shot in the greater Los Angeles area.

If you do not like these ridiculous outrageous impossible features you won't like this one.  The premise alone lets you know that it's just a crazy B horror flick and if you look at it for just entertainment value it can be hilarious fun.  Lots of big and poisonous snakes in this one (and not just the same yellow and white boa they show in every movie).  In making this movie Strother Martin was bitten by poisonous snakes several times.  He was not joking when he was in a scene and a black mamba bit him and he adlibed,  ""You wasting your time I'm so full of anti-venom --"".  They had five large King Cobras recently caught and full of venom that were used and milked in the film, a different one with each take.  None of the snakes were defanged for this movie.  Heck for reality the scene with Strother Martin giving Dirk Benedict a shot, Martin really jabbed him in the arm with a real needle (Of course there was no evil serum in it!).  Not a film for people scared of snakes.",1418083200,,1147,4.215596330275229

858073,4,6304389175,"This fun oddity from 1973 actually delivers on some tension and suspense and, if you're young enough or don't like snakes, some terror!  Some of the kids at my work (I work with juvenile boys) were watching this throwback tonight and were very much into it, so much so that I was able to walk up behind one of them during a scene where a man is wrestling with a python (anaconda?) for his life and I shook the kid by the shoulders and he nearly jumped up into the ceiling!  Good fun!

I first saw this on t.v. probably in the late 70s and remembered it being both scary and sad.  The story revolves a mad herpetologist interested in turning back the theorheitcal evolutionary clock by secretly injecting a snake serum into his assistant.  He had succeeded before as we find out when our protagonists (Dirk Benedict of Battlestar Galactica fame and Heather Menzies of the Logan's Run TV series) find a half-man half-snake in a circus sideshow.  This was both a success and a failure to the beloved mad doctor (played by Strother Martin doing his best to come across as both brilliant and slightly addled); the success was in the beginning of the transformation from man to snake but the failure was in not getting the man all the way to snake.  Well, not to fear as Mr. Martin sees his task through on the unwitting Dirk Benedict.  You can see the ending coming from a mile off but it is both effective and sad.

The information on the snakes is not always accurate (I don't recall the hognose snake to be an actual danger to a human) and I think that they switch out pythons for anacondas (or vice versa) in some of the man-versus-snake scenes but there are plenty of snakes to be seen and we also get to see a few people graphically get bit!  The special effects are also quite effective and the scene at the end with the King Cobra rising stiffly straight up off of the restraint bed staring directly into the camera is genuinely creepy.  I would love to see a contemporary director recreate this movie, but with restraint (no Eight Legged Freaks or Snakes On A Plane here)!  I think that they'd see some benefits at the box office.

You have Dirk Benedict sharing the lead with an unattractive, untalented actress and Dirk wouldn't develop his acting chops until 'Battlestar Galactica'. On top of the bad acting and boring and non sensical script, you also don't get anything you would expect from a movie like this. You get maybe 45 seconds worth of snakes attacking. You get a stupid looking snake man before Benedict's transformation into an actual snake. Not even good enough for a laugh, much less a decent horror or sci-fi picture.

858077,3,6304389175,"This is pure b=grade sci-fi/ horror. If you like that sort of thing, you'll love this film. If not, you'll hate it.

The film concerns a young college student who is unwittingly a part of a ""mad doctor's"" experiment that is intended to transform him into a snake.  This film uses lots of real snakes, some of them very dangerous. There are some moments that are very unnerving.  One of them is when we meet one of the doctor's failed experiments: a half-man, half- snake mutation without arms or legs that is placed in a carnival side-show.  Creepy stuff!

The downside is the film's acting and goofy 70's fashion.  The most annoying part of the film for me was Heather Menzies, who plays the Doctor's daughter.  Her hair style and glasses are goofy-looking even by the standards of the 1970's and she can't act. Worse still, the movie's most inane lines of dialog belong to her.

Old dude apparently thinks that life on Earth can only survive forever in snake form and he's working to make that happen. Boy falls in love with Old Dude's daughter while, at the same time, becomes the Old Dude's snake ginny pig. (Note: There are no ginny pigs in the movie, just snakes).

The cops keep wanting to know what happened to the last boy that worked for the old dude. He doesn't really know because you know how kids are. They just take off sometimes. Meanwhile, there is a carnival nearby that features a MAN-SNAKE sideshow attraction.

If you know someone that loves snakes to the extent they have a pet snake this is a movie you need to buy for them. This is a great snake education. The actors in this movie are really brave. It's easy to make things look real when they are real. Few things scare most people like REAL SNAKES!",1303689600,2,1351,4.353174603174603

Anyone with a fear of snakes, beware! SSSSSSS boasts an array of live snakes that the actors handle, including the deadly King Cobra. It is impossible to take the film completely seriously, but thankfully the even blend of comedy, horror, and romance give the quirky characters and silly plot plenty of room to breath. Like Willard and Stanley before him, Dr. Martin uses his fanged friends to exact revenge against his trespassers, which provides a decent little body count as the snakes bite and crush their way through the locals. Unfortunately, the final creature design fails to impress because of its aged make-up and special FX, but SSSSSSS still manages to be an entertaining killer animal entry from the early 70's!

It was different seeing him younger and seeing him in a role like this but it was a good different. Dirk Benedict did a great job in this role and he did it in a believable way. I've also seen Strother Martin (Much Younger) in the early black and white episodes of Gunsmoke that are recently coming out and like in his guest appearances on Gunsmoke he's a quack and he did this crazy scientist role extremely well. Another thing that made this movie believable was the fact that all the snakes used in the movie are real snakes and that really helped the movie. I guess the only bad part about that part was it's said in Strother Martian's bio on the net that he was bitten by one of the snakes while on the set, so yeah that's the only thing that sucks about using real snakes in a movie but still, it did help the movie.

858208,4,6304389175,"Watching ""Sssssss,"" along with ""Frogs,"" on television in the mid-seventies fueled my interest in snakes and other reptiles.  I almost became a herpetologist.  Instead, I owned several species of frogs, lizards, and non-poisonous kingsnakes throughout my life.  Dr. Stoner, the mad scientist of ""Sssssss"" reminds me of a combination of Frankenstein and Hitler.  He wants to create a new, more perfect race of humans - a race that will survive the coming fuel and food shortages.  He sees himself as God, creating new life.  In fact, there are several Biblical paintings throughout his home depicting Adam and Even in the Garden of Eden and the Serpent tempting them with fruit from the Tree of Knowledge.  His lab assistant, David, and his daughter, Kristina, remind me of Adam and Eve.  Dr. Stoner is more like the Serpent than he is God.  He seeks to create new life by destroying life that already exists.  And he will kill anyone who tries to get in his way.  The movie is nicely paced with creative death sequences.  I would've given ""Sssssss"" five stars if the cobra bites had actually been seen rather than suggested.  The ending reminds me of the one in ""Night of Dark Shadows"" when Kate Jackson sees her transformed husband and the ghost of Angelique and screams hysterically nonstop because she realizes the hopelessness of the situation.

Even during the more lighthearted moments of ""Sssssss,"" there's an ever-present tension that never quite goes away. Yes, the plot is cheesy as hell; sure, the acting is a bit second rate (except by Martin); and yes, ""Sssssss"" is one of those mysterious movies that somehow got made and has hung around long enough to develop a cult following, not to mention get the DVD treatment. But, to its credit, this flick has remained somewhat relevant after all these years -- just check out its fair share of positive reviews here on Amazon.

I first saw ""Sssssss"" many moons ago on the CBS ""Late Show"" during a sleepover at my grandma's house.

858291,4,6304389175,"Snakes...my girlfriend hates them...and when I say `hate', I mean she loathes them to the point where she won't even look at images of them.  Myself, I have a fear of spiders, particularly those large, hairy ones (I think it has to do with all those legs), but at least I can enjoy films that feature them.  Needless to say, Sssssss (1973) is a film I'd never be able to get her to watch with me...at least not without some serious sedation.  Directed by Bernard L. Kowalski (Attack of the Giant Leeches, Krakatoa, East of Java), the film stars Strother Martin (Cool Hand Luke, The Wild Bunch), Dirk `Eggs' Benedict (""Battlestar Galactica"", ""The A-Team""), and Heather Menzies (Hawaii, Piranha), probably best known for her role as Louisa von Trapp from the film The Sound of Music (1965).  Also appearing is Richard B. Shull (Splash), Tim O'Connor (Across 110th Street), Jack Ging (High Plains Drifter), and former USC football player and professional boxer Reb Brown (""Captain America"", Yor, the Hunter from the Future), in his first silver screen appearance.

Strother Martin plays Dr. Carl Stoner, a herpetologist (one who studies reptiles) who specializes in the filed of ophiology (snakes), assisted by his daughter Kristina (Menzies), both of whom live on the outskirts of a small college town.  Seems when the good doctor isn't collecting venom samples or engaging in snake handling demonstrations for the slack jawed yokels, he's busy working on a serum derived from snake venom whose purpose has yet to be determined.  In need of a new assistant (his previous one `left' under mysterious circumstances), Stoner contacts an acquaintance at the college, a professor named Dr. Ken Daniels (Shull) who offers up a young student named David Blake (Benedict).  David accepts the opportunity and moves in with Stoner and his daughter, where the doctor immediately begins David on a series of `inoculations', supposedly intended to build up his immunity to snake venom for protection in the event he gets bitten (yeah, right).  Anyway, David and Kristina start getting chummy (precipitated by a skinny dipping incident in a nearby lake, one that includes some carefully placed foliage), and David starts noticing some very subtle changes in his body to which Stoner brushes off as perfectly normal side effects to the inoculations (oh, those scales are the result of an allergic reaction...sure).  After some business with a local jocko a-hole college football star (Brown) who's got the hots for Kristina, David soon finds himself in a world of trouble as the changes, while still occurring, aren't so subtle anymore.  Stoner, learning of Kristina's involvement with David, tries to warn her off, but she sees the attempt as purely interference from an overprotective father (seems she's unaware of her father's experimental activities).  As you can imagine, things start going seriously downhill from here...

While Sssssss was a feature film, it does have a made for 1970s TV feel about it most likely due to the fact most of the performers (with the exception of Martin) and the director previous experiences were limited to television work.  I did enjoy this film, but there really wasn't a huge mystery in terms of what was going on or where the film was headed as the story, especially the opening sequence, tended to give away enough for an experienced viewer make their own conclusions early in the feature.  Despite this I still thought the film was a lot of fun, as it moved along well and featured enough creepiness to keep me engaged throughout (the transformation bit at the end was seriously warped).  I thought Strother Martin did pretty well, as he wasn't really an evil scientist, but a seriously demented figure who took the whole naturalism gig a little too far, able to rationalize his activities (to himself, at least) for the sake bettering mankind.  I did learn a number of things from this film including the following...

1. Old men and snakes enjoy a nip of booze now and again.

2. Never go sticking your grubby mitts into a herpetologist's car.

3. People tend to fear snakes for same reason they fear minority groups.

4. In terms of snakes, the king cobra seems the most uppity.

5. The Leather Tuscadero mullet hairstyle seemed oddly popular with women in the early 1970s.

6. The ability to shoot accurately apparently isn't a prerequisite for becoming a law enforcement official in a small town.

7. Never get into a tussle with Reb Brown as he'll toss you around like a rag doll.

8. Reb Brown doesn't have to pay for it...never has, and never will.

9. Nothing gets a woman you don't know in the mood for action like climbing up the side of her house and sneaking in through her bedroom window at night while she's sleeping.

10. Never get on the bad side of a herpetologist as they may just toss a poisonous snake in the shower with you.

11. Snakeman have a really annoying preponderance towards whimpering.

12. Strother Martin had a lot more guts than I ever will as far as his willingness to mess about with poisonous snakes.

It should be noted most all the snakes depicted in the film were real.  Whether or not any were harmed during filming is unclear.  The film is rated PG so the violence is pretty low key i.e. safe for television broadcast, but there are a couple of nekkid sequences involving the showing of male bumcakes (primarily Reb Brown in a shower with a semi-opaque shower curtain).  There's a really funny bit where David and Kristina go skinny dipping, and both strip down, most of their naughty bits obscured by some strategically placed leaves.  I thought the makeup, specifically in relation to David developing reptilian features, quite good, at least for the time the film was made.  One aspect of the film did seem a little strange, and that was the ending.  While it was downbeat, it also felt abrupt as if perhaps the writers had painted themselves into a corner and had nowhere left to go, so they just ended it as best he could.  Regardless, the film is still a lot of fun, especially if you dig on ookie creature films of the 1970s.

The picture, presented in widescreen (1.85.1) anamorphic, looks very good, showing the occasional sign of aging (a few dust specks here and there), and the Dolby Digital 2.0 comes across well.  There's not much in the way of extras except for a rough looking theatrical trailer and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.

If you dig the animal/nature themed horror flicks of the 70s, you'll probably dig this.  Ssssssstrother Martin is a mad scientist who believes that man is very close to extinction, so in order to survive upcoming plagues and holocausts, he wants to turn everyone into snakes.  Sounds reasonable enough.  His guinea pig in this experiment is his new assssssistant played by Dirk Benedict, who you may remember as Face in The A-Team.  Face has no idea what's awaiting him, he thinks the injections Martin gives him are a venom vaccine.  Face falls in love with Martin's nerdy snake studying daughter, and soon introduces her to a kind of snake she's never seen before.  Before long his face is getting messed up, his skin is shedding and he's always feeling cold.  Never once does he catch on to what's happening until it's too late.  Produced by the guys who gave us Jaws, this film actually seems to be taking itself seriously.  Things really don't start happening until the one hour mark.  Before that it's actually more of a drama than anything, but the body count eventually starts.  Martin is really what carries this film.  His performance is very much above the average for the kind of mad scientist character you usually see in this genre.  This film is only gonna appeal to fans of the cheesy big monster genre(and maybe not even them!), everyone else might as well stay away.  There are quite alot of interesting snake facts throughout, so the movie isn't a total loss coz you come away a bit wiser about snakes.  A point must also be made about the title.

It isn't very gory and the nudity and sex is kept to a minimum, but it has a certain appeal because of the acting and effects. (Fair warning to male viewers: there is somewhat more male nudity in this film than female nudity.)
If you like Strother Martin (and I do), you will find that this is one of his best roles. Compared to other roles in his career he underplays it here (a considerable achievement because his character is as nutty as a fruitcake). The underplaying of the mad doctor's character helps to lend credibility to the silly plot and it is easier to suspend our disbelief. I give lots of credit to the director if it was his idea to play it this way. We get to see a side of Mr. Martin's talent that we  don't usually see - and his acting is very good. It looks like he really handles the snakes in this movie (although they may not really be the dangerous species that the producers would lead you to believe). Dirk Benedict and Heather Menzies give adequate performances for their characters.
The plot is silly and really unbelievable: a mad doctor wants to create a new race of intelligent snakes by transforming humans. He is certain that there is going to be a cataclysm which will destroy the human race because of our lack of responsibility with the environment. His super-snakes are supposed to be able to survive the disaster. He achieves transformation by injecting his victim with snake extract (or something like that).
The effects in this film are quite good, especially considering the time when this film was made. (The effects would be much better today, of course, with existing technology.) There are some fairly suspenseful scenes showing the handling of snakes and  extraction of their venom. There is one fairly lame scene (both in technique and acting) of someone being killed by a python. There are two really yucky scenes showing one of the mad doctor's failures. The transformation scene is very good.
Overall, I would say this movie is good fun to watch if you leave your brain on the shelf. It also has some value as a nostalgic film of the 70's with dated dialogue and styles of clothing. I would recommend it for people who want a good horror film that doesn't go too far on the scares. However, because of the brief nudity, this may not be a good film for children. I gave it three stars (rather than four) because the plot is so hokey and because it is a dated film.",1039564800,8,2489,4.541202672605791
858536,4,6304389175,"Yes, Ssssssss will never be considered one of the ""great"" lost 70s films, but it is a lot of fun to watch.  The plot (almost scene for scene) was appropriated by Full Moon to make Curse of the Puppetmaster, so campy is definitely the word to use here.  The craze of the time of skinny dipping is done here and the hair styles and slang are oh so 70s.  The chiller is effective though, especially at the end.  The carnival sideshow adds chills effectively, as well.  This would make a GREAT DVD double feature with Race with the Devil.  C'mon studios!",1024358400,21,550,4.396039603960396
858537,4,6304389175,"I first saw this movie in the early 80's.  For several years I've been searching for ""Sssssss"" to add to my collection.  Overall, this is a sssssuperb movie.  The acting needed impovement.  But, for its time  (1973) the effcts were good.  The end was somewhat a disappointment; I was  expecting a huge snake to emerge.  Nevertheless, I would like to see a  sequel to this movie; an updated version with modernized effects and the  great Dr. having the ability to make a larger more gigantic snake.  With  the special effects capablities of the 90's a sequel to ""Sssssss""  would be a Ssssssstupendous, Sssssssuperlative movie.",954892800,5,625,4.894230769230769

7869406,4,6304389175,"Weird, for sure.  So I thought when I first saw this flick in the 1970's.  But it draws you in.  Okay, it is not in the league of the original Dracula, Frankenstein, Invisible Man, and Wolf Man movies.  But it is in the line of them.  I detest snakes, but the killing of the snake by the punk made me want the dude have revenge upon his paltry self, which occurred. It is moving in spite of -- or perhaps because of -- its subject.",1504224000,,431,4.023529411764706
