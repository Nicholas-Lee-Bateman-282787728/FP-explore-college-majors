8176724,5,B000003K7G,"This episode involves the discovery of an orphaned Jem'Hadar infant, and its rapid growth on the station under the care of Odo.  As a single episode, this is highly interesting and original.  More importantly, it  serves to indicate future issues which will develop as the Jem'Hadar wage  war against the Federation.  Overall a well-made and highly fascinating  study of the Jem'Hadar, the first totally inhuman alien race encountered in  the Trek sagas.",956275200,4,454,5.222222222222222
