7343624,5,B0128GGLRO,"Wow! This is a great movie about Jesus. It is so real and very believable. If I wasn't already saved, this movie alone would get me saved. I have already ordered 2 more DVDs. You should watch this and have your friends and family watch it. Just amazing!",1448841600,4,253,4.291666666666667

7343626,3,B0128GGLRO,"I'm still looking at this, I fell in Love with Mary!, I do have the ""The Nativity Story, and it's outstanding"" amazon, (JESUS, the Bible Stories; amazon, I did not like the fact that (Bruce Marchiano appears to be about 40 years or older!, and not 33 as (Yeshua Ben YAHWEH, Lamb of GOD!), JESUS! (c. AD 30-33 aged. c. 33 at Crucifixion) ""The appearance of the Angel, it also through me off a little!, but when I saw that Mr. Bruce Marchiano, was the same one whom,  played JESUS, in (MATTHEW) The Visual Bible; amazon, It, was a great performance, I did enjoy this! I do love the effort!"" I also have the, (SON OF GOD!) amazon,
 ""The Portuguese Actor Digo Margado was not, Spectacular!, ""In fact the worse that, I've seen, but still, about the right age!"";
 I do still love, Ms. Roma Downey Jr. ( In Touch By An Angel!) I think that I saw, every one of her programs.
""And I think that, I could play this part great! But I'm 70 yrs., and will be 71 this July 13th. ""Don't worry!, I do know when it's time to quit! :)""
This why 3 stars, (I still watching this, I love, Ms. Mary, very Beautiful!) ""Be Blessed!!!""",1466899200,,1109,4.246445497630332

7343628,4,B0128GGLRO,"Would have given it 5 stars but the transitioning through life stages was segmented, didn't flow.",1464652800,,97,5.125
7343629,5,B0128GGLRO,Amazing retelling of the story of Jesus through his mother's eyes.  Beautiful!,1464652800,,78,5.5
7343630,4,B0128GGLRO,This is a good movie.  I expected to see more of Mary with her son.  It was mostly about Jesus and his teachings.,1464393600,3,113,3.869565217391304
7343631,5,B0128GGLRO,"I think it is lovely.  People complain about the respective ages of the actors.  They do such a good job it just doesn't matter.  If you like this you might enjoy Don Francisco's - I Believe in You, a lovely song about Joseph finding out that Mary was pregnant. It is on utube.",1460592000,3,277,4.188679245283019
7343632,2,B0128GGLRO,Not bad but  Bruce is a little too old to keep playing Jesus,1460073600,,60,3.6153846153846154
7343633,2,B0128GGLRO,"This movie is poorly cast in the part of Jesus. A 60-year old trying to act like someone 30-something just doesn't fly. It's especially awful in the crucifiction scene, where his mother Mary loos younger than 20. The acting on ""Jesus'"" part is also lacking. He seems more like a boring History teacher than the messiah.
As an educational piece the movie is okay, but if you expect to be entertained along the way, you should look for something not as low-budget and more professionally made.",1459036800,2,491,4.72093023255814

7343643,3,B0128GGLRO,"I liked the way Jesus was presented, as kind, compassionate, and merciful. The acting was a little stiff at times, and the actor playing the role of Jesus looks like he is significantly older than the woman playing the role of Mary, his mother.",1453680000,,244,4.568181818181818
7343644,5,B0128GGLRO,Love this move and have other movies in which Bruce Marchiano plays the part of Jesus. Must see.,1450915200,3,96,4.388888888888889

8725567,5,B0128GGLRO,"Beautiful film that goes into the heart of Jesus Christ's mission on earth with a wonderful treatment of Mary's point of view. I agree with other reviewers wishing that it were longer, however it is wonderful as it is: humble, heart-felt, and accurate to the Scriptures.
