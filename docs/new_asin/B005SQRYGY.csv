4886143,3,B005SQRYGY,"For all its hype I am a little disappointed in it. They spent WAY too much time away from the main character the feral Woman and yammering on about the screwed up family. I honestly felt they needed to add more gore and action to the movie. I cannot believe some idiot at the film festival got upset? I could tell McKee was backing way off on the gore scenes. No heads, arms, or legs cut off at all. I wish the Woman would have caused even more havoc at the end. I think Polyanna McIntosh does a GREAT job playing this character. I would have had her start picking up more English words as the show went along. If they do have another movie in this series lets show more of the Woman less of some lame family. McKee stop hiding all the gore scenes.",1327622400,,748,4.13013698630137
4886144,1,B005SQRYGY,"THE WOMAN has a truly repulsive villain in Chris Creel, expertly embodied by Sean Bridgers.  Pollyanna McIntosh is frightening as the titular feral captive.  Angela Bettis (MAY, the CARRIE remake) is effective as Creel's submissive wife and ZACH RAND and CARRIE ANNE STANLEY do well as the teenaged children.  But THE WOMAN is a mess.  The plot jumps all over the place and its ""Who is the real animal"" theme becomes a moot point by the film's preposterous climax.  What transpires in the ""doghouse"" makes no sense at all.  This is not entertainment, merely a repulsive example of glorified torture and violence.  Good performances in vain.",1327622400,6,640,4.981132075471698
4886145,1,B005SQRYGY,"Wow, I gave this movie a shot originally and fell asleep,  after awhile of contemplating to revisit the film and convincing myself to give it the bennefit of the doubt and that originally it was the cheap whiskey I had drank before I began to watch it that put me to sleep, I gave this another shot.  While not entirely without cause (but... pretty much entirely), I cannot fathom why this stands out on so many occassions as a film held in high critical regard...  the acting was laughable at best, the characters were completely unbelievable along with the script and casting decisions all together to think of it (the daughter's ""concerned"" teacher was completely misplaced and utterly unconvincing as a valid part of our lineup.) Bummer, I was really looking forward to this as I am a HUGE Jack Ketchum fan and had heard such great things.  Worst of all was the films horrendous choice of score.  The soundtrack was a collection of pop/garage/emo/grunge/teen-angst-ridden rock songs that not only failed to convey any emotional impact toward the experience but tended to overwhelm it in a very distracting way...  I am generally pretty easy to please but with the expectations that were set this felt like a complete disjointment... better luck next time!",1326672000,9,1259,4.887323943661972
4886146,5,B005SQRYGY,"THE WOMAN is sort of the rural-American version of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. It's all about human monsters amongst us. Pollyanna McIntosh plays the brutal / brutalized, title character so well that it's (refreshingly) disturbing! Watching her is like watching a wolf or tiger in captivity! She gives off a wildness like I've never seen before! Angela Bettis (MAY, TOOLBOX MURDERS) is excellent as the abused, emotionally-deadened spouse of the psychopathic husband (Sean Bridgers) who instigates most of the film's horror. The Cleeks are a seemingly normal family, until the layers of normalcy begin to chip, peel, and fall away completely! THE WOMAN is intense, unpredictable, and insane. A horrific marvel...",1326672000,20,704,5.467889908256881
4886147,3,B005SQRYGY,"Thought the premise sounded interesting, and I was right. The only thing that surprised me was what a great villain Chris Cleek made. You love to hate him and end up rooting for ""the woman""--or, really, the women. Also, I absolutely loved the soundtrack. I would have given this movie a higher score had the acting not been weak in some areas and the fact that it just overall reminded me too much of ""The Girl Next Door,"" which Lucky McKee and Ketchum both had to do with, if I'm not mistaken. The ending also was a little too ridiculous, but horror movies can easily get away with that. One more thing--the makeup was ABSURD. They made a beautiful girl look absolutely disgusting, and I loved that.

I heard a lot about this movie being a ""feminist film."" I don't know if I would agree with that. Sure, it shows a strong female character, but what is the point other than the fact that she's strong-willed? I can understand some of the theories, especially with the ending (which I won't ruin), but still...I guess I need to read a good essay on this movie.

If you like a good gore movie that also centers around issues that we globally face today, I'd definitely recommend this movie. TRIGGER WARNING, AND POSSIBLE SPOILER: If you're not much for torture films or anything reminiscent of rape, domestic violence, verbal abuse, etc., please do not watch.",1325462400,7,1357,4.603305785123967
4886148,5,B005SQRYGY,"This is a very entertaining movie with a novel story. Although i was neither horrified nor scared, I was completely entertained from beginning to end. Pollyanna McIntosh is very mediocre as ""The Woman"", but Sean Bridgers really stole the show as ""The Man"". He is so ridiculously ""over the top"" that i had to laugh at a few unbelievable scenes. This story pushes boundaries ""oldboy"" style.

 Every character in this movie is ""sick"" including the 6 yo cannibal girl. And for all the crybabies always complaining about ""woman hating"" horror movies, then here is your chance to watch a man-hating ""feminist"" horror movie. I, on the other hand, can enjoy all movies without being a sexist.

 This is definitely a top 5 horror movie of 2011, but both ""I Saw The devil"" and ""A Serbian Film"" tops this by far! Be sure to watch all 3 ASAP!

Enjoy!",1324598400,2,838,4.635135135135135
4886149,5,B005SQRYGY,"The most original and Gut wrenching film of 2011. This is a must see for fans of Horror, Jack Ketchum, Lucky McKee & great films. Lucky McKee comes into his own with this one. Definitively his greatest effort thus far; proving he is one of the top horror/exploitation directors of this generation. Could technically be considered a sequel to The Offspring as both are from the Jack Ketchum Dead River book series. Both films star Pollyanna McIntosh, who in this film plays the woman to perfection. All around the cast is great. Sean Bridgers and Angela Bettis are both excellent additions to the cast. Sean Bridgers plays the misogynistic father & trust me you'll hate that bastard. Zach Rand; The little boy will leave you sickened, but that just proves how well his part is played. I highly recommend this movie. Spectacular finale with enough gore to satisfy the most jaded of horror fans. I'm buying the blu-ray for sure! The cinematography and scenery will look beautiful in  high definition.",1324166400,,997,4.864705882352941
4886150,4,B005SQRYGY,"(Semi 'SPOILER' Alert).....

Well, except for the pop punk, (or whatever), 'rock' in the background, which did not fit whatsoever in the opening scene, as well as many other places, this movie is captivating, and difficult to take your eyes off of.
It starts out with 'the woman' wondering through a stream in search of food and shelter in the forest, trying to take care of a cut or something on her side with mud. Not too far a way, a family lives out in the country- a lawyer, his obedient wife, troubled teenage daughter, 12 or 13 year-old unhappy son, and a little girl.
One day while hunting in the woods, the lawyer spots the wild girl, and spies on her while washing herself in the stream, admiring her semi nakedness. He then hatches a plan to capture her, which he eventually does.
Strangely enough, his entire family, (somewhat reluctantly) go along with his idea of keeping her chained up in the basement part of their barn!
All of this can only add up to a potentially fascinating story of how the man attempts to tame this wild person, and it does begin to fascinate, but soon things start to contradict each other a little.
For example, though domineering at first, the man and his family get along fairly well, and they seem to tolerate his ways- likely because he seems to be the one making all the money. However, for some inexplicable reason, he starts to get physically and verbally abusive here and there, whereas he didn't seem to before. Also, his intentions at first seem to be to break the girl out of her wild ways, and educate her, but once he sees her beautiful naked body cleaned off, he starts to get other ideas. Toward's the end of the movie, he completely flips and gets himself into more trouble than he could possibly get out of, again for no logical reason! His son too, suddenly sides with his dad, (and suddenly adopts his dad's weird ideas), which doesn't quite add up.
Then, even more incredibly, what could have developed into something fascinating, denigrates into just another flesh-eating 'zombie-like' movie during the last fifteen minutes, replete with the sudden appearance of a goofy wild zombie boy barking and acting silly!! Except for that, and a lot of the music, this could have turned into something really exceptional! It's almost as though the people behind the film suddenly ran out of ideas and thought, ""uhm, what'll we do now?!"" And someone responded with, ""I know! Zombie movie!""",1322956800,2,2440,4.687645687645688
4886151,4,B005SQRYGY,"The film opens with Pollyanna McIntosh as a feral woman. She has an injury to her side and hunts and kills a wolf. Her legs look pretty darn good for a person who has lived outdoors their entire life, not one scrape,scar, or even hair on the legs...and her armpits are shaved!

Sean Bridgers plays Chris Cleek, an unlikeable man of wealth. He sees our feral woman in the woods behind his house while out hunting. He has a mousey wife (Angela Bettis), a teen daughter, a son who has trouble with his free throws and a young daughter who likes to kiss boys to the horror of her mother. Sean Bridgers orders his family around who pretty much obey him, like zombies, without question.

He captures the wild woman, and rather than turn her over to the authorities, he chains her up in their basement/shed. He is very open about it and shows her to his family who are completely dumbfounded. Chris Cleek rules the roost and doesn't like to be questioned. He reminds me of a creepy Will Ferrell. Their task is to civilize the woman, a woman who wants no master.

The two older children Peg and Brian are portrayed as abnormally reclusive self imposed social outcasts, signs of an abnormal home life. We know this is true because of the lame indie music soundtrack that plays when they are on screen by themselves. Having a scantily clad female chained up around a teen boy brings about some natural curiosity tendencies.

The wife and older daughter feel like a prisoner, like the feral woman who symbolizes their imprisonment. Sean Bridges symbolizes the ""system"" which imprisons women. There are scenes showing violence to women that were hard to watch, even though we don't see the actual strikes, we see the arm movement and hear the blows.
The movie starts semi-normal, goes to odd, then downright weird as Sean Bridges fights to be the master of his world filled with rebellious women. Sean's son sides with him to give us the full symbolism of the battle of the sexes with men being aggressive controlling rapists and women the victim.

Many of the actors in this film are new to the industry. In spite of that, they did a solid job.

F-bomb, Full frontal nudity (Pollyanna McIntosh), rape, torture, blood, gore. While I give this movie 4 stars, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1321142400,54,2280,4.631188118811881

In all honesty the main reason I bought this is because I love Angela Bettis and this is one of the few movies she has a big role in, shes a great but unknown actress who deserves to get her name out more.

4886199,3,B005SQRYGY,"If you like quadrupling the volume then setting it back every 30 seconds, this is the movie for you. When dialogue is taking place, this becomes a silent movie. It looks like the characters are trying to mouth something but you can barely hear it. So you turn up the volume, and before you know it there's an ear-splitting scream and a high-pitched cry for help waking up your neighbors. Like any sensible person, I sought to resolve this issue by turning on subtitles. So I turn them on, and there's a 15-second delay on the script. So you have to wait fifteen seconds to see what someone's saying. Meanwhile, the movie is proceeding and all of the emotion is taken out of the scenes because of the delayed translation. I know this is to be expected from the horror/suspense genre, but this movie is more guilty than any other.

It uses a bit too much hyperbole to be considered reliable social commentary, but taken as a horror story in the vein of Audition, this movie is enjoyable. I'd give it 4 stars if not for the sound issues.",1489536000,,1034,4.470899470899471

4886218,2,B005SQRYGY,"I've really liked Pollyanna McIntosh in other films and this had such good reviews by so many that I thought I'd give it a try. I really wish I hadn't.

The movie feels very low-budget and the characters seem really one-dimensional. Perhaps they were trying to make a feminist statement about taking back power...but it mainly just felt overly sadistic and violent. I can handle violence and even gore if there is a gripping story or a lot of character development, but I didn't think this movie had either. It simply showed torture, rape, murder, cannibalism, spousal abuse and implied incest as a way to shock. I didn't feel like there was some big statement about the abuse of women. It just showed women being abused.

If you really enjoy gore and sadism, watch this film. If you're looking for something with a bit of substance behind the brutality, keep looking. It isn't here.",1478822400,6,883,4.7272727272727275

4886246,2,B005SQRYGY,"I just watched this film. I had read an intriguing review of it in Video Watchdog, by Eric Somer, & wanted to see if it was any good. It isn't.

 It appears to see itself as a feminist treatment of standard horror & psychological tropes involving the degradation & subjection of woman. As it turns out, however, it is only a poorly written, unmotivated, blatantly misogynistic gore-fest pretending at a pro-feminist message, poorly acted by the male lead, who appears to be doing an impression of Will Ferrell parodying George W. Bush. Obviously, the filmmakers don't care for that president, which is understandable. However, this performance, among so many other things, makes the film impossible to take seriously.

In the documentary accompanying the film on dvd, it is described as a character study, which it isn't. It's a caricature study. All of the characters are indecipherable 'types' with no life or motivation beyond the actions which they are made to perform or react to. They are only there to do what the script tells them to do.

This film is motivated only by the expectations of a largely male audience who are used to seeing women degraded in every manner imaginable. Aside from the more jaded gore-hounds, this film will not disappoint. Attempting to put a feminist gloss on it is an insult to women. The misogyny is apparent in how each female character, with the exception of a small child, is systematically brutalized by the lead male character &/or his son. Pretending that this level of abuse & degradation, whatever its so-called 'context,' is in service of a feminist manifesto  does not pass the B.S. test.

The sole social value of this benighted project is as an example of how filmmakers can delude themselves (& others who should know better) that
they are promoting a sensitive pro-female sensibility, when in fact they are playing on the same old woman-hating shtick that women over the generations have been fighting against.

Cluelessness of its negative impact in no way absolves the writers & director of the real message that they are sending to a primarily male audience, that women will inevitably be raped, imprisoned, physically & sexually abused & degraded by men in positions of power, & nothing that they do can protect them.

4886250,5,B005SQRYGY,"I never have seen anything more violent, brutal, horrifying inhumane movie like this before. My dvd was European version and was 104 minutes long and it has some more footages even.
The movie remindes me of such films like <THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT-REMAKE>, <I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE-ORIGINAL>, <MARTYRS><DEADGIRL><THE GIRL NEXT DOOR> and so on. It is a fine mixture of revenge, raped, toturement.

There is this faminly man looking guy who happens to find a woman who is a savage wandering around the forrest half naked wonded. He decided to bring her home and make her civilized. But I think he has something more in his mind too.
He is not just a family man but also a brutal, monarchy kind of a guy who even hits his wife if he thinks he needs to without any sorry feeling.
when he brings this savage woman home and cained her, he tells all of his family and asks to participate educate her.
He cleans her, he feeds her. That's fine but at night, he rapes her too. She was a toy for him after all.
His wife instantly felt that. Even his oldest son witnesses his father's behavior and enjoys masterbating in front of her making her naked when no one is around later.
The mother found out what he did and tells the father that she cannot take this anymore and she is leaving with her daughers.
The father hits her brutally.
Then the father and the son become 'SAVAGES'.
The oldest daughter's teacher came because the daugther didn't came to school and she became the first victim. The father put her in the barn where this savage woman is and suddenly a woman who seems to be the savage woman's colleague came out and bites her skin apart and ate them to death.
Then the revenge. The savage woman and her colleague kills the father and the son the most brutal way.
The ending is very original.
When the youngest daughter, who is the most beautiful and cute girl sees the savage woman and gives her the water bottle, and she gives her some blood from her hand. The girl leaks the blood and follows them and become one of them.
The older daugter left alone alive.

The movie is again very brutal, viloent, sexually assaulting, horrifying and vomitable.
If you still want to watch be prepare to do so.

Do you want to compare this movie with others? No thank you. Because there are none.
If I insist, there are a few horror films you really have to watch which is not easy to access, <A Serbian Film UNCUT><MARTYRS>< Cannibal Holocaust UNCUT><The Woman><The Girl Next Door(Now this one, if you watch, you will feel really really bad for at least a month. I threw away the bluray right away and never ever watched it again)><THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT 2009>< I spit on your grave 1978> <INSIDE>So far this much you should watch.

A perfect example of how a horror movie can make a real political statement. Lucky McKee is a self-proclaimed feminist, and I think this movie is one of the strongest feminist statements I've ever seen. While the central supporting column of this movie is The Woman, played brilliantly by Pollyanna McIntosh, a feral human being, raised by wolves to have a taste for human flesh, the real horror of the movie is Sean Bridgers as Chris Cleek, an attorney used to having women serve him. On a hunting trip, he discovers the woman, traps her, and binds her in the basement. And when he's ready, he brings his whole family down and announces that taming the woman will be the new family project. As the project continues we witness the onion of Cleek's life, fresh on the surface and rotting at its heart, peeled back layer by layer. Especially disturbing is the performance by Angela Bettis (best actress in the world--call me maybe?) as Cleek's ""good wife"" Belle, who enables every bit of her husband's evil behavior.
In an era where UPS will accommodate a driver who loses his license in a DUI but fire a pregnant woman if her doctor tells her not to lift heavy objects, this movie has an important, if brutal, message to convey about what will happen to a society that denies women's rights.",1418169600,2,1307,4.662337662337662

4886295,3,B005SQRYGY,"So this review is not the one I thought I would write, but I actually expected more action and gore. I am not at all a gore person. I thought the premise of the movie was worthwhile, which, when reading reviews, seemed to me to be that it's easy to be afraid of something that looks evil and different, but the more insidious and despicable evil may be living next door or blend in with you. I debated getting this movie due to it being ""bloody disgusting"" and hearing that people left the theatre in disgust or to vomit, because I am not at all a gore hound. However, really, the only gory scenes are at the very end, and it may be an indication that I am too jaded to horror movies, but I didn't think they were that bad. I think the content can be abrasive, but understanding the intent is to highlight that evil is not just that weird looking guy and that that weird looking guy, inversely, may not be evil, I did not mind that aspect. And actually, most of the acting is fairly good. Especially the father and the woman. I will say that I never have seen the prequel or read the books, so I only know the context I found in reviews, but I don't think that you would necessarily need to know it. Just be aware that the first scene is going to make no sense; it's some spiritual moment with a wolf that I totally did not understand. :) I would say, not as gory as I thought it would be.

4886327,5,B005SQRYGY,"Nine Things About the Movie The Woman (USA, 2011)

1. This upsetting movie is based on Jack Ketchums novel of the same name. If you don't know Jack Ketchum, he writes award-winning, and controversial, horror novels.

2. Its the sequel to the movie Offspring. But you don't really need to have seen that movie first. In fact, Offspring was pretty terrible. This movie pretty much stands alone..

3. Theres a very early scene in the film during a barbecue, when a boy named Brian witnesses a girl be bullied and abused by other kids. Brian just looks the other way and shoots basketball. Its a very chilling scene, and lets you know right away that something is Not Right.

4.  The main plot is about about a feral woman roaming the woods outside of town (if you have seen Offspring, you get the backstory of that). She is found by Chris, Brians father. He is a nice conservative lawyer, and he takes her back home. Then he chains her up in the cellar.

5. Chris wants to make the woman he found civilized, which really just means he wants to do terrible things to her. He makes his family witness and participate. He especially wants to make sure his son follows in his footsteps.

6. One thing that makes the movie so disturbing is the way we learn about the rest of Chriss family - his wife and two daughters. Nothing outright is told to us, but we slowly figure out that the whole family is disturbed for different reasons.

7. The performances of the cast are all solid. Given the sensitive and horrific subject matter, the actors stay true to their characters. This is especially true of Zach Rand, who plays Brian, and Pollyanna McIntosh who plays The Woman.

8. The final act of the movie is outrageous and savage. Its a combination of physical violence, psychological terror, and unexpected plot twists that made my jaw drop. Its up to the viewer to decide if it has a happy ending or not.

9. The Woman goes into the Hall of Fame of dysfunctional family movies. It is mercilessly misogynistic and yet ferociously feminist. Its not for all audiences. But it is a very effective portrayal of the various cruelties that humans put each other through.",1407715200,13,2155,4.5595854922279795

Well, there's one thing worse, and it's a movie that confuses cleverness with an endless stream of taboo-violating shock for shock's sake.

There's maybe an interesting movie in here somewhere, but I couldn't find it through all the smug pretense on display. Lucky McKee really seems to think he's elevating the crazy cannibal movie to high art, but it fails as horror and as commentary. He's trying so hard to shock and impress that believability, relatability to the characters, consistency of tone, motivation, dialog...everything goes out the window.

4886353,3,B005SQRYGY,"I had to watch this movie after I saw it at my local entertainment store. I was so confused by the ending (where did the other feral monkey-woman come from???) I started reading reviews on here to try and figure it out.
  Parts of this movie were hard to watch, particularly the torture scenes. The father does look like a skinny, dark-haired Will Ferrell who seems like a typical family guy until he goes hunting and finds an unclean, scantily-clad woman in a creek. Bursts of distracting rock music clue you in on his sexual attraction to her as he watches her through his gun scope. He goes home and commands his family to clean out the cellar to make room for something ""better than a mountain lion"" then he returns to the woods and catches the woman forcefully. Down in the cellar, he uses chains and a winch to suspend her arms out from her sides. She is covered in dirt and she is apparently non-verbal. Her hissing is creepy and unnerving. I decided to keep watching after she bites one of the man's fingers off.
  His wife and daughters are sympathetic to the captured woman, but the son is as much of a misogynist as his dad. The boy and his father torture the woman at different times, and she is raped by the father. (It was actually harder to watch the pressure-washer scene than it was the rape scene.) When the mother finds out her son becomes sexually aroused by torturing the woman, she confronts her husband. When he refuses to discipline his son, she snaps and says she is leaving him. She mentions something confusing about ""the dogs"" being reason enough to go to jail. He proceeds to beat her up in front of the children and everything goes to hell in a hand-basket after that.
  The sad part is that while much of this movie is unrealistic, the parts where the men rape and torture a captive woman are believable. Misogyny and male-dominance are key themes here, with all the women (the feral women, the wife, the pregnant daughter, the concerned teacher) being victims. That is, until the captive woman teams up with the other feral monkey-woman and they start killing people with their teeth!

I even did a bit of research and discovered that the movie was even more complex and well-thought-out than I originally thought. Acting is top-notch. McIntosh (the woman) is amazing. I've been a fan of Angela Bettis since ""May"" and she made no mistake in accepting this script. Excellent film. Not for kids or teens.",1401840000,,663,4.876106194690266

If I could do it over again I would call over a bunch of friends, turn the lights off and turn them back on, at the end, just to see everyone's faces. This is more of a cult classic-ish movie. I'm in dire need to discuss the ending right now. What in the blue Hell???

I will say this: Where do you get a snap-on dress? I think a particular character met their end because of the dress, I'm just saying.
And, who knew Will Ferrell had a brother?

AND what does Jack Ketchum have against women? I haven't read his books but I did see ""The Girl Next Door"" and I see a trend.... a very disturbing trend. I like it better when I thought Jack Ketchum was actually country music singer Hal Ketchum.

Another thing the explanation of what the son was doing and what it looked like he was doing were two different things. Now that I think about it I KNOW they were two different things.

I found myself wondering who the good guys were and who the bad guys were. It's not clearcut in this movie.

The plot moves slowly. But it moves slowly for a reason. It wants the viewer to experience certain things so as to understand later events. But at a certain point, when the viewer is most certainly ready, the plot takes off and things get resolved, if you want to call it that.

It's an interesting movie, and although I had to turn away during a few scenes, I found it entertaining and a tad thought provoking. But bear in mind that I like horror films.  Oh, it's not a pschological thriller or Citizen Kane type of movie. It's not ""deep."" But it gives you enough reason to question what is right and what is wrong.  Is it a horror flick?

4886360,4,B005SQRYGY,"The Woman (Lucky McKee, 2011)

What almost everyone knows about The Woman who knows anything about The Woman is that is has caused, and continues to cause, a firestorm of debate in the horror community as to whether it is meant as a feminist film or a misogynist one. (I lack an understanding of why this debate exists, given Lucky McKee's previous filmography; everything he has done has had a marked feminist streak.) I am unsure how many of the people involved in this debate have actually sat down and watched the silly thing, the third installment in a series that began with Jack Ketchum's novels Off Season and Off Spring, both of which have already been filmed (both by other directors, and both not nearly as well as this). It's not McKee's best workin fact, in McKee's entire filmography, including Red (for which he received no credit), I ended up rating The Woman the lowestbut that does not mean it is not a good film, nor that you should not see it as long as you have the stomach for it; Lucky McKee bringing his C game to the table is still better than about 90% of dedicated horror hacks bringing their A games, and McKee has a light touch with savagery compared to a number of other recent enfants terribles (Eli Roth, anyone?), so that while he's making a film that is just as nasty as the ones being made by those guyseven more, in many ways, just as it was in Sick GirlMcKee is good about leaving things just enough offscreen to trick you into thinking you maybe saw a lot more nastiness than you did. That's an impressive trick to pull off. It also has the unfortunate side effect of fueling those debates, but you can't have everything.

First off: if you have not seen Off Season and Off Spring yet (or, preferably, read the novels), go on, we will wait. This is not a stand-alone film in any way, even if those other pieces were directed by other folks; I think at least part of the debate is fueled by those who are unaware of the backstory here. The titular, and unnamed, Woman (Exam's Polyanna McIntosh) is the last surviving member of the cannibal clan who have been roaming the New England coast for decades, and whom we first met in those previous works. Without the family system in place, she is confused and somewhat weakened (think the teen protagonists of We Are What We Are, but far more savage), and she is eventually captured by Chris Cleek (Nell's Sean Bridgers), a backwoods lawyer with a thoroughly cracked family, delusions of grandeur, and a mean streak as wide as the Hudson. Originally, the Woman's presence, and Cleek's intent to civilize her (if you've got comparisons in your head to Bub in Day of the Dead and Ketchum's own The Girl Next Door, you're right on target), only affect Cleek himself, but that particular disease grows to infect the rest of the family, as sure as you can imagine, from Belle (McKee regular Angela Bettis)'s weird fascination with her to Brian (Ghoul's Zach Rand)'s sexual attraction. (According to IMDB's trivia, there was an entire subplot excised from the film about Peggy, Cleek's wifeand if you haven't read the novel, that alone may well be reason enough to seek it out, because that feels missing from this movie.)

The thing is, it's tough to get into the whole feminist/misogynist debate without revealing every major spoiler for the film, because that question is not answerable until the last sequence, but it seemed to me obvious once you got thereeven if you're not already familiar with McKee's work (and this is not a spoiler alert: Lucky McKee wouldn't touch a misogynist project with a ten-foot pole, and nor would Angela Bettis, judging by both's past records). Putting that aside, how's the rest of the movie, Mrs. Lincoln? Lucky McKee has, traditionally, excelled at one thing (among many others): taking B-list and character actors and getting A-list performances out of them. The Woman is no different in that regard; you have never heard of most of these people, though in some cases you should have (you've never seen Exam? Go. Now.), and you will exit this movie wondering why. McKee is also very good at knowing where to stick a camera for maximum effect and minimum special effects. Normally, in his movies, this leads to perhaps lighter ratings (and lower budgets), since you rarely see as much nastiness as your brain believes you are, but there was no way this one was getting around a hard R. (To McKee's credit, had he taken the Bill Zebub show-everything route, this might not have even managed an NC-17.) Whether you buy into the misogyny talk or not, there is no denying that certain pieces of this film are difficult viewing, and it would be remiss of me to not add that at least one scene in the film is seriously triggering. (Depending on your particular neurosis, hell, the whole film may be triggering.) Approach with caution, but if you are a Lucky McKee fan, still approach. And if you are not already a Lucky McKee fan, go get your hands on May and Red and become one before watching this. *** ",1394150400,2,5014,4.636670416197975

The good thing about it is that the shock does add up to express something important which is something a lot of other horror films can't lay claim to.

The story clearly addresses the question about who the real savages are in life. That answer can easily be answered by watching the evening news, but this story really throws the answer in your face.  The performances of all of the actors (especially the crazy little boy) are top notch. The ""the woman"", played by Pollyanna Mcintosh, is such a believable character that you pray that people like her don't exist, but you can never be quite sure they don't.

4886394,4,B005SQRYGY,"The Woman follows a abusive father, Chris Cleek, who one day captures a feral woman while hunting. Chris brings her home and makes her a ""project"" for the family, as they try to civilize the beastly women; but, who's really the one that needs to be civilized? The Woman is a disturbing and haunting film.

The story in this film will be taken in differently by different people, of course. Some will take it at face value and see a brutal, misogynistic tale; some may even see it as a man-hating film that blatantly makes all men evil; others will see it ""nature vs. nurture"" type of tale where you'll question who the real monster is and why. For example, there is a lot of domestic abuse in this film where the Chris beats his wife and scenes where he takes advantage of ""the Woman""; this will likely, and rightfully, offend viewers. Then you witness scenes where you realize these sinister traits are being passed down to the son- scenes that show the kid become more and more like his devilish father; the ending will also support the ""who is the real monster"" concept, although I won't spoil it. The final sequence, although though-provoking and having it add a wicked twist, felt a bit rushed and unrealistic; although the film is already violent enough, the ending takes it to ridiculous levels that felt out of place. Also, the film has little bits of dark humor spread throughout, using witty dialogue and music. The acting was great, the special effects were great, and it had a great, unique choice of music.

Overall, The Woman is a brutal and disturbing film; you may be left offended, but if you can ultimately understand the message it tries to convey it shouldn't be a significant issue. As of 5/14/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, a purchase is recommended for gore and horror fans, a rental otherwise.

4886400,4,B005SQRYGY,"I recently discovered Hulu (I am a dinosaur, I know).  I love horror movies and stumbled upon this one.  I read some reviews on Amazon and thought, ""Why not?""  There is not much I can add to the discussion at this point in terms of plot and reactions.  There are some failings in the movie.  I'd have liked a little more background about the Woman.  People assume she was last of a cannibal clan, but even that is speculation.  In the opening she kills what appears to be an injured animal that is taking shelter in a kind of cave; to me it seems unlikely that she killed a wolf when in flashback it appears she was ""raised by a wolf.""  So right there is some confusion:  is she from a clan or was she raised by the wolf we seen licking the blood from an infant's arm?  The woman attempts guttural communication after her capture, so I am tending to the raised by wolves theory.  As for being a cannibal, if I were being held hostage by a sociopath and had the guts, I'd probably bite off his finger if I had the chance, too.

But perhaps I am being too serious.  I will say this:  sociopaths frighten me more than any vampire, werewolf or other beastie EVER will.  I am unlikely ever to encounter one of these creatures in my life; but considering that we have a variety of narcissistic sociopaths in congress and other high places--and they wreak horrible damage on the rest of us with impunity--Chris Cleek is a terrifying monster.  Moreso because he DOES exist.  Just read the newspapers.  Families like this DO exist.  Maybe they don't capture feral women who, in the end, escape and kick butt.  You kind of wish this were true.  More likely you find out that some daughter was held in captivity for 16 years, bore 3 children by her evil father, meanwhile mother let it all happen.

Production values were pretty good; as an educator, the character of the sympathetic teacher was laughable.  She was by far the weakest actor of the bunch.  I am not sure where the idea of a teacher who wears HIGH heels and short dresses and quite a bit of makeup comes from.  Most teachers I know, myself included, need comfortable shoes and more professional clothing to be hired and keep our jobs.  Honestly.  She also had the presence of a soggy pancake and she's supposed to be a geometry teacher.  Puh-leez.  That said, all the other performances were quite strong and that did surprise me.  Descriptions of a psychotic Will Ferrell are totally on the mark.

I found this movie ""misogynistic"" insofar as it does reflect what happens in real life, where we know woman-hating does exist.  The Taliban recently shot a young girl in the head for saying females have the right to an education.  Fortunately she survived.  Many do not.

I do agree that it was sort of ridiculous that the Woman had shaved arm pits and hairless legs etc.  Her tattered clothing was also stupid; I sew a lot and tattered clothing does NOT look like that.  Strips of clothing were sewn together to make her ""skirt"" and vest, which showed off her fit body nicely, but nope, the clothing was totally false.  I also wonder why we depict ""feral"" people as filthy and having bad teeth etc.  Predators of other species need to keep very very clean so that their prey cannot smell them. Aboriginal peoples are not filthy; Amazonian Indians are not filthy.  Why do we insist on squalor in this Woman, and as a trope in movies in general?  I suppose it is to signal degradation and wildness.  If you think about it logically, if the Woman had such bad teeth, she'd be in awful pain, and probably couldn't feed herself properly.  In nature, a lion with ONE abscessed tooth can die, for example. So the bad teeth are sort of gross and scary but gratuitous. Again, perhaps I am being too serious.  What it all did remind me of was Milla Jovovich in one of her action roles.  Sigh.  But I digress.  Go in with an open mind and this movie isn't half bad.  A little gory but not over the top in my experience.  So much is alluded to through the first scenes, when Chris seems almost normal.  You have to catch the clues:  the littlest girl kissing and almost engaging in frottage with a little boy; the candle Chris uses, that is also on Peggy's night stand.  The ""dog"" we don't see but hear out in the ""kennel.""  Not a great movie,but by far not the worst, either.",1365811200,,4318,4.441326530612245

4886416,3,B005SQRYGY,"To call Lucky McKee's ""The Woman"" a horror movie would be misleading because, ""bloody"" and ""disgusting"" as it may be, the film itself is not scary. Obviously, to scare is not its aim. The seemingly absurd story of a father ""keeping"" a feral woman in a cellar, written by the director and Jack Ketchum (writer of the book upon which a 2007 film ""The Girl Next Door"" is based), serves more as a metaphor for gender conflict than as vehicle for mystery and suspense. So please don't expect something like a super-gory French horror.

The story itself is rather simple. Chris Cleek (Sean Bridgers) is a successful lawyer, who has recently captured a ""monster"" woman (Pollyanna McIntosh) in the woods and is determined to ""civilize"" her. As the film goes on, we learn a few more things not about the woman, but the Cleek family. Obviously something is not quite right with the family, though what part is not clear yet.

Gore is comparatively restrained in ""The Woman."" Instead, the film is rife with symbolism, mostly related to sexual desire (the boy's obsession with basketball, for instance, also seen in Pedro Almodvar's ""Live Flesh""). You can discuss the undercurrent themes and subtexts for hours, something academics love to talk about in cultural studies. Lucky McKee knows what he is doing, and with the talented cast including Angela Bettis (star of McKee's the better received ""May""), he has made his point pretty clearly.

So, does the film work? Yes, but only with limited success. By presenting men-women dynamics in a brutal way, ""The Woman"" only repeats in a more explicit and straightforward fashion what other films, whether horror or not, have done before. That is not to say ""The Woman"" is not worth your time, but most moviegoers would find the film, with an exception of the final 15 minutes (including the bizarre post-credit scene), essentially not all that different from other works in the past.",1359590400,,1917,4.892307692307693
4886417,4,B005SQRYGY,"Chris Cleek discovers a feral woman living in the forests behind his home, and decides to capture her and lock her away in his family's cellar so that they can begin to ""domesticate"" her... Or so it would seem... Offensive, appalling, and dangerous are just three of the terms that could accurately be used to describe Lucky McKee's exploitative shocker THE WOMAN, a film conceived from the novel that he co-wrote with critically-acclaimed author Jack Ketchum as a follow-up to The Offspring.

Where the violence and torture in THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is often condoned for its connections to True Crime, and the movie adaptation of THE OFFSPRING is typically shrugged away as being Survivalist trash, there is something profoundly disturbing in McKee's handling of THE WOMAN that makes it such a harrowing viewing experience. McKee's sharp, cynical humor finds its way back in to every scene, but given the difficulty of the subject matter, the audience simply is not prepared to use laughter as a safety net for the horror. It is clear, from the very brginning, that McKee is toying with his audiences, using bright, cheerful colors and an upbeat Indie score to purely contradict the dark overriding themes. The constant disruption of mood only works to amplify the director's twisted sense of humor. He never asks us to overlook the horrifying impact of the images or events on screen, he is simply highlighting them for their inherent absurdity. The torture, rape, and abuse found within the film are meant to be as disgusting and enraging as perceived in order to drive out an emotional response in the viewer. This is consistent with the gut-wrenching reactions to other ground-breaking Horror entries like THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, or more recently, MARTYRS and DEADGIRL. THE WOMAN also returns us to the all-too-familiar theme of ""Civilization Versus Savagery,"" which has been frequented by directors like Wes Craven and Sam Peckinpah in their films THE HILLS HAVE EYES and STRAW DOGS.

The cast is certainly not to be forgotten beneath McKee's choices as a director. Each of these actors and actresses are equally responsible for carrying out the unbearable acts on screen without so much as a wink to the audience. Sean Bridgers plays Chris Cleek as if he were Ted Bundy. Calm, cool, and collected on the surface, but hiding a soul of absolute evil. His wife and children are undeniably oppressed, with both Angela Bettis and Lauren Ashley Carter reaching deep in to the dark recesses of the mind to find where abused women go to shelter themselves. They are utterly believable on screen. Their son Brian, played by Zach Rand, has inherited his father's sociopathic tendencies through constant psychological abuse as well. We pity him for becoming a victim of both nature and nurture. Interestingly enough, ""The Woman"" for which the film was named is but a side character, a catalyst used to reveal Chris as the film's true villain. He is infinitely more frightening than his new ""houseguest.""

THE WOMAN is not for all audiences. It is upsetting and morally questionable, but it is extremely effective in achieving its desired goals. Fans of Lucky McKee's work will find this to be his darkest project to date, but one that strictly keeps in line with the director's peculiar style and sensibilities.

4886444,5,B005SQRYGY,"Let me state right off that this is one disturbing movie and it's not for everybody.  If you hate horror movies then this is one you should avoid.

The Woman is about a family that tries to tame a feral woman.  The woman has no name and has only known the wilderness as a home.  Chris Cleek, a well respected lawyer in the community, spots the woman crossing a creek one day, and becomes enamored with her.  He quickly sets about to capture her, and once he does he brings her back to his family's house, strips her and strings her up in the basement of the family barn.  He tells his family that it's his intention to rehabilitate the woman, but over the course of the movie it becomes clear that Cleek's only intention is to dominate the woman just like he does his family, even when it becomes clear that the woman is dangerous and is a threat to them  all.

The Woman is a damning critique of traditional family roles.  Cleek is the head of the family and has a big ego.  He orders around his family as if they were nothing more than his servants.  His wife, played by the talented Angela Bettis, does little to stop his manipulating ways and often complies with his demands even when she knows her husband is wrong.  Out of all the members of his family Cleek favors his son, and is grooming him to be just like him--to seek complete and absolute control of any situation that may be come his way.

The Woman created quite a stir at Sundance last year.  I believe part of the problem (and still is to this day) is the fact that little background information is given to the audience about the woman.  The movie is based on Jack Ketchum's and Lucky McKey's novel of the same name, and it is the third book in Ketchum's Dead River series.  In the series the woman is a part of a clan of feral cannibals who roam the Main wilderness.  The clan was decimated during a shootout in the second book of the series.

4886450,3,B005SQRYGY,"This is one of the movies that you aren't quite sure what you saw when the movie ends.  The story is about this creep and woman-hater Chris Cleek who finds a wild woman in the woods, captures her and shackles her up in his cellar.  He's out of his mind and doesn't try to hide the woman - so he introduces his family to her and claims that he's taken her so they can ""help"" the woman and ""civilize"" her.  His brand of helping her includes rape and torture.  Equally sadistic is his mean-spirited son who goes along with whatever his dad has in store.  The woman impacts different family members in different ways - Chris' submissive and out-of-it wife goes along with Chris but finally reaches the point of being done with his cruel ways; daughter Peg who may be pregnant protects the wild woman and feels horrible for all the tortures she is enduring; the youngest daughter seems as if she doesn't fully understand the situation but comforts the wild woman with music and generally takes a liking to her.  When a well-meaning teacher visits the family to discuss the possibility that daughter Peg might be pregnant, the movie crescendos into a strange finale including the discovery of another eyeless wild woman who thinks she's a dog, cannibalism and some gory deaths.  To say this movie is weird is an understatement.  Not much scares me but admittedly the hissing, black-toothed wild woman with a look of death in her eye was so convincing I got the chills.  I'm not sure if they were trying to hint that Chris had also had incestual relations with his daughter and that's why she was pregnant, but it seemed that's what the movie was trying to lean towards.  Oddly enough Chris Cleek reminded me of George W Bush or at least that's what I kept thinking.  I'm not sure what I got out of this movie and the ending seems to leave some guesswork.  The person who played The Woman was excellent in her role and really nailed the primal requirements to be such a person.  I can't say this is a great movie - it's just very different and you will stay hooked to it to see exactly what's going to happen - especially when the movie escalates.  I guess I might watch it one more time to get over the initial shock of 'what the heck did I just see' but to me the story follows the lines of many of those torture type movies with a small twist.  Watch it if you want to see a horror movie about a cave woman who is actually quite scary and you want to see a whole bunch of strange crap going on.  Don't watch it if you are sick of capture and torture movies.",1341705600,14,2553,4.365750528541226

4886474,4,B005SQRYGY,"I liked this film a lot. It's ugly and mean but it's not shallow. It fits in comfortably  with the few books I've read by Jack Ketchum, or movies I've seen based on his books.

Here's the scoop. Chris Cleek is a lawyer and runs his house with an iron fist. He's misogynist, a true male chauvinist pig, and is teaching his son to be the same. While out hunting he comes across a feral woman living in a cave. He captures her, imprisons her and is determined to ""civilize"" her. This is an oversimplification but pretty much everything else in the movie is driven by this.

This is some rough stuff. Cleek is an ugly individual and it hurts to see the sweet, upright exterior he shows the world juxtaposed with the disgusting individual he really is. The way he treats his wife and older daughter killed me. They're terrified of him. And that he's passing these traits down to his son is saddening. Then there's the way he treats ""The Woman."" Not to spoil, but he shows her not one iota of kindness. The ending will slay you. Certain things you want to happen do happen, but there's is much unexpected as well and it goes down rough. It was all very surprising.

Jack Ketchum helped write the script so my guess is it sticks close to the novel. The performances were mostly very good. The production was as good as it had to be and the directing worked well. I had issues with some of the soundtrack and sound mixing. I had to turn the volume way down in some scenes. And, as others have mentioned, the Woman's shaved legs and armpits didn't make sense, which is odd given how fierce the vision is in this movie. But, that aside, this is well worth a look. It's not for everyone, particularly the feint of heart or weak of stomach, but it's really good.",1338249600,,1750,4.358895705521473

*** WARNING: SPOILERS!***
The locations are cheesy. Cinematography is for spit. Neither do a thing for creating a mood, or atmosphere. Quite the contrary, the way this movie was filmed detracts from a movie that needs every apsect to lend to it's authenticity. I did NOT find Chris Cleek the least bit intimidating, chilling, or threatening. He seems awkward and miscast. He looks, and speaks as if he is on the verge of cracking up. I agree with the reviewer who compared him to Will Farrell. Its like any minute the movie would be interupted by G.E. Smith's freaking sax, and Cleek was going to turn to the camera and say, ""Live from New York, its Saturday night!!!"".
Okay, the incongruities, the ""woods"" where the father is hunting, and comes upon this feral woman looks like its 100 yards from the local mall. This feral woman who has survived in the ""wild"", where did she come across the clothing? A mini skirt if memory serves? Her hair is slightly unkempt, not matted down and covered in filth, as one might expect. In fact it looks like she gets frequent trims, the ends are cut straight across, nice and even. No excess body hair. Apparently, razors and depilatories are readily available. The teacher that just drops by her student's house; uninvited, unannounced, to tell the parents of what she feels is an emotionally troubled girl, that she she believes the girl is pregnant. Perhaps this woman looking for a career change? Why else would she behave so ludicrously? Surely she would be fired, and possibly have legal action taken against her. Guess, in the frenzy to express her concern, she overlooked that.  And I guess the notion that perhaps the reason for the change in the girl's demeanor is the result of dysfunction at home? Hey, anyone could have overlooked that, right? And what was with the other feral, pseudo dog girl?! I'm sorry, that was just so hokey, and corny. And finally, the way youngest daughter just scurries off with this strange woman. Come on.

When Chris captures a lone feral woman from a cannibalistic tribe, things change...and it isn't long before they get even worse than anyone could possibly imagine.  Definitely not for everyone, The Woman is an unforgettable piece of horror that surprisingly comes off as something all too-real.  It's hard to watch and leaves a more than lasting impression on the viewer, which is just what you should come to expect from a film of this type.

4886483,5,B005SQRYGY,"The Woman - perhaps the most important horror movie of the year.  Although, people will rush to see this because of the splatterpunk theme, I can assure you the message presented is much more that just civilizing a cannibal.

Ok, I'm going to make this part short and sweet and then you go from there.  The acting, directing, effects, etc were beyond amazing.  This movie bleeds, no pun intended, talent and good story telling. Here's the synopsis of the movie.  Big time law official kidnaps a cannibal in the woods and tries to torture her into being civilized, however, although this is his excuse, he's just looking for a reason to brutalize women besides his wife and pregnant teenage daughter, which suggestively the movie insinuates that he is the father of his daughters unborn fetus.... Incest rape is only indicated here, not shown.

Here's where I'm going to ramble. The mother/wife of the family is a personification of the ""1950's Good Wife"" image where she doesn't doubt or question her husband, and if she does she gets a slap in the face.  This is further indicated as her character is mostly found in the kitchen, tending to the children, cleaning house, and grocery shopping. She is the Bette Crocker mold of Stepford perfection.  Although she is really dying inside from the abuse that her husband has inflicted on her, her daughters, and the cannibal woman, her refusal to help herself, or anyother female, shows that she has accepted her role.

The cannibal AKA The Woman on the other hand is the opposite. The cannibal is a personification of the liberated female, one that can walk on her own, provide on her own, and defend herself.  Even through all of the abuse, she not once bows to the man figure, she simply bides her time.  When the two time periods interact, you can tell by body language that the liberated female is asking the repressed female for help.  Even though the repressed wife has the opportunity to help, she doesn't, as she is dominated by her husband.

SPOLIERS
When the cannibal is released, she kills the wife/mother because she allowed her children/herself and the cannibal to undergo unspeakable abuse without ever attempting defense.  Therefore the ""1950's Good Wife"" figure is just as guilty as the villain since she never tried to help anyone.

The cannibal kills her captor and his son, because his son is just as twisted as he is.  By the way, the perversities and sadism of the son is shown frequently in the movie and when the son's disturbing behavior is noted to the father, he practically pats the boy on the head and says, ""Boys will be boys."" This shows how abusive fathers try to condition their boys to be the same as them. The liberated female killing father and son indicates, in order to advance forward we have to eliminate the repressed way of living no matter how young or old.

Finally, the scene where the daughters are rescued by the cannibal is a representation of females leaving behind the 1950's women's slavery trend and walking into liberation.  However, in order to atchieve this, they have to give up all material items, the Bette Crocker world, so they can live in a world free of repression. This brings me to note, the ending is simple but powerful.",1335830400,2,3232,4.730837789661319

Bemused, I had watched the disturbed, angry individuals who were so incensed at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and could not wait to have a truly horrifying, experience. I loved this film. The actors are all excellent. Sean Bridgers was right on the mark as a genuinely ""normal"" looking monster. Pollyanna McIntosh is truly amazing with her uncanny ability to capture ""untamed animal"" eyes. It does have a ""Who is the monster"" and ""Battle of the Sexes"" theme and if you think real hard you can find a few more. But this is a horror movie. The genre is supposed to horrify. That is the point and the goal. Most people will not like this movie. Or they will say they don't like it because they are the type who don't want to admit they rubberneck at accidents and are drawn to the dark side. Because that's what it's like. You are watching this horrible, nasty, gory accident and you can't take your eyes away from it. In fact, you're sorry when it ends. After all, it's happening to ""those"" people. It could never happen to you. Wrapped in a cocoon of false security you pompously talk about how ""sick"" it was to everyone who will listen. Why were you there in the first place? Was I scared or horrified? Not really. I think I am immune to horror because I've read it and watched it for so many years yet I still relish the genre. However, if you are an aficionado, you will like this movie. It has some funny moments,(like Bridger's Chris Creek character's nonchalance about his severed finger) some gore, and some nudity. Lucky McKee and Jack Ketchum do not disappoint with ""The Woman"". It's grotesque, dark, and bizarre. I believe another horror classic is born.

4886491,5,B005SQRYGY,"** This review contains spoilers. **

Chris Cleek is a seemingly normal family man and lawyer. His family seems perfect in every way with a loving wife, a successful son, and two obedient daughters. One day when hunting, he finds a feral, cannibalistic woman bathing in a lake. After forcing his family to prepare a space for her in the cellar, he captures her to civilize her and save her from her savage ways. His perfect facade crumbles as he ""educates"" the woman and the sick person inside emerges. With his perfection, the family's veneer also falls away, exposing his son's violent tendencies, his daughter's pregnancy, and his wife's complacency despite her anger and her abject horror at his actions. Who will be victorious: the savage woman or the civilized man? Who is the more monstrous?

I heard about The Woman during last year's Women in Horror Month and wasn't able to watch it until very recently. I expected to like it, but I was blown away by the film. I absolutely loved it especially because of the wonderful performances of the actors and the underlying message. Chris Cleek is a very creepy character. Gleefully sadistic, he is magnetic and repellent at the same time. He acts as the ideal patriarch of the ideal nuclear family who just happens to be insane, ruling his family with an iron fist. All the women in his life are cowed and fearful as a result of his mentality that women are inherently inferior to men, except for his youngest daughter. His wife, Belle, ignores his abuse to the detriment of her children and his daughter, Peggy, escapes into her music and books to cope with her pregnancy (most likely the product of incest). Even the women and girls seen in passing in their neighborhood are victimized and abused by men outside of the Cleek family, showing that this isn't an isolated incident. His son, Brian, on the other hand, is being groomed to be exactly like him. The process proved to be successful with his disturbing, budding serial killer behavior.

Based on this view of the family and the brutal treatment of the Woman, it's easy to just assume that it's propagating misogyny. At its core, The Woman examines women's roles in society and views women in a much more favorable light than it appears. The Woman is a strong character untouched by the influences of civilization. When faced with Chris, she is the only woman to fight back. After continued abuse and the fact that Chris wields superior weapons, the Woman backs down, but is never fully controlled. The minute she is released and catches Chris off guard, she kills him and his son brutally. This shows that misogyny and the idea of women as the weaker sex are conventions of society and not inherently true. Belle is the first person killed after she is released. Many people are upset by this because they feel sorry for her as a victim of her husband. However, I feel it was justified because she allowed her children to be abused and warped by her husband. By doing that, she is just as guilty as Chris, if not more so. She could have left with her kids or called the police long ago and she chose not to, allowing the abuse to continue for years. Also, Chris Cleek is shown to be more brutal and less civilized than the Woman, the only living member of a savage and cannibalistic tribe. His family dynamic calls into question the traditional patriarchal family unit, proving that nostalgia for the past is supporting this dynamic in reality and perpetuating abuse. The world that surrounds these characters supports misogyny as a part of everyday life, with the only exception being Peggy's math teacher, Miss Hindle. This aspect is a commentary on the atmosphere in our own society and how we are numb or blinded to the misogyny we are bombarded with every day.

The Woman is a commentary on how women are treated in our society in the present and the past. The film had a few surprising twists and turns, including showing Chris to be way more depraved than I thought, which is saying a lot. The ambiguous ending leaves just enough to the imagination and also leaves the story open for another installment. I really like this film and hope Lucky McKee and Jack Ketchum work together on other projects in the future. I would recommend this to people looking for a challenging, thought provoking, and (at times) difficult to watch film.",1329696000,,4351,4.69109947643979
4886502,1,B005SQRYGY,"Spoilers blah blah blah

Let's just jump in shall we? The story is a guy and his son find a feral woman living in the backwoods and shoot/kidnap her, and decide to hold her in their basement, in order to 'civilize' her; pretty interesting so far no? The women in the household are more than a little concerned about this new situation but the dad is headstrong in his 'mission' while the son is eagerly tagging along.

Let's just get the good aspects of this film out of the way, the production values are excellent, the cinematography, the music, the pacing of the film, it's all very well made. The acting is good but nothing special and the design of the woman is pretty gritty, which was nice.

This sounds like a pretty good horror movie, but here's where the story gets royally stupid. So obviously we find out that the feral woman isn't the REAL monster here, it's the men of the family, aparently they're still living in a super patriarchal mindset and all woman are dumb servants that need to be beaten all the time. Ok I guess, but why is the father like this? Oh we don't know and we're just supposed to accept that he's bad without any reason or sign? ZOMG 5 STAR MOVIE ALL THE WAY, DEAR LORD THERE JUST AREN'T ENOUGH STARS TO THROW AT THIS MOVIE IT'S TOOO GOOD! No.

The men are all violent wife beating rapists, and all the woman are nothing more than quiet subservient doormats. The Woman is storywise that black and white, men r bad, women r good lols. There is no depth, logic, or subtelty at all in this movie, we're just shown that men are horrible through shock value. And it's not just the father/son either, the daughter is shown at school and her male classmates are also misogynistic pigs, so really all men are apparently horrible people in this movie's universe. If we apply this same black and white assumption that a group of people are evil to be anything other than white men, it would be labeled offensive and stupid, but because it's against white men it's not just ok, it's critically acclaimed since it's politically correct! Give me a break...

For example there's a scene where the son sneaks into the cellar and sexually tortures the feral captive, but when the mom who found out tells the dad, he just turns around and beats her for thinking the son's sick in the head. If you're going to show people get abused there has to be some sort of reason behind it, but here we get no reason. Are we just watching torture porn here? I mean I get that there are sick people in real life who abuse their family like this, but in this movie's universe all men are violent women-hating rapists without any sort of reason, background, or logic; there is no grey morality, nothing to question or think about here, men are simply monstrous pigs, that's all you need to know. Now please continue with the applause and 5 star reviews.

This would be fine if this was just a subplot to a bigger story going on and the psychopathic father was just a blatant cariacture of how people shouldn't act, but the movie centers around his poorly written character, and that's the whole movie here is watching him beat women up. There's zero subtlety, zero character development, and zero entertainment value, it's just a director that likes to slap you in the face with a blatant social commentary that cheaply capitalizes on white man's guilt.",1329523200,19,3356,4.520593080724876

Don't get me wrong, I watch just about every off the wall movie I can because you never know when you're going to find a diamond in the rough. This however, is more like a cubic zirconia in the lint.

4886504,4,B005SQRYGY,"Written by Jack Ketchum, this would be situated after the events of OffSpring (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Offspring/dp/B002I41KMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Offspring</a>- and no, these movies are not connected intentionally by directors, but they do share the same main character. It picks up with The woman wandering, alone, her children dead because of the child. She looks for shelter, has a dream of the kid, and begins making herself at home again. then the man enters. He, along with his wife, small child, older daughter and son, take her in to ""civilize her."" The problem is that the family is not civilized themselves, and the woman is not as weak as the man thinks she is.

First, this is really like the book. There are a few differences at the end, sequence wise, but the book plays out more like Ketchum's work than I thought it would. That says a lot both about the way the source material was written, about the realism, and about the things the actors did. In my mind, they really managed to capture these characters and transfer them to the 102 minute showing.

As far as a story, it can seem flawed in some ways. It simply picks up with a wild woman wandering the woods, and with this man finding her. That's not to say there isn't a lot of detail, but it seems disconnected as a stand alone film. As far as the woman goes, she seems incomplete. That's why I mentioned Offspring. Everything from the wound she has to the motivation she carries sits in that film, and it makes this more than understood. As far as the family goes, it is pretty complete except for one part. I do not want to spoil anything so I will only say the thing with the dogs to anyone who has seen it, noting that this piece just seems like another piece to say the man is not a good guy. I did like the oddity to it, but there was no ""who"" attached to it.

I'm giving it a 4 out of 5, noting I am a fan of Ketchum and enjoyed this as well. I might not have known it existed otherwise, but knowing and seeing - I'm happy with it. My friends who enjoy horror will enjoy it I'm sure, liking the way the family turns into a character study on a small scale with each of them until the end comes. Sometimes, in that respect, people are creepier than any monster that comes along. The woman is a thing in nature, roaming, doing her part. The man - you really have to ask what he might be.

4886506,1,B005SQRYGY,I'm a various writer but even this I could not write; this was just plain sick.  The only good part to this movie was watching the a$$hole get his.  I would not recommend this movie unless you are a demented freak; you will not like it.,1328140800,5,236,4.108695652173913
4886507,3,B005SQRYGY,"Imagine if Quentin Tarantino decided to remake the 1987 comedy Walk Like a Man as a modern grindhouse thriller; you'd basically have the recipe for The Woman. One of the best horror films I saw in 2011, The Woman centers around a lawyer named Christopher Cleek, who discovers a feral woman living in the woods, captures her, and brings her home to his family in order to civilize her for modern society. Of course, the woman turns out to be more than Christopher bargained for, and before long, the family is forced to defend themselves against an unfamiliar enemy with the upper hand. Despite its familiar explorations of gender and human nature, The Woman is an ambitious, unabashedly strange, and ultimately effective thriller that builds tension toward a brutal, no-holds-barred climax.",1328054400,,790,5.038167938931298
4886508,5,B005SQRYGY,"My wife & I watched this last night. I've been a Jack Ketchum fan since 1981 when I read his novel Offseason, along with Richard Laymon's The Cellar, and thought, ""at last, this is what real horror fiction should be"".

It's good to see films of his works. Red was very well done and Off Spring (the sequel to Offseason) was good. The Woman is better. Psychological terror at its best.

Pollyanna McIntosh is amazing as the feral woman. My wife, a costumer, immediately noticed her walk: like a beast, not a woman (or man). Her full-body makeup should earn an Oscar, as well as her acting. Angela Bettis, as the broken-down wife, was also outstanding, and Sean Bridgers, as her sadistic, psychotic husband, had just the right amount of quiet lunacy to carry off the role. It's good to see Sean in a starring role; he's worked hard for it.

The only complaint I had was that some of the music was too LOUD (it distracted form the script) and some of the lyrics had no relation to the action. I've always believed the music should further the action, or strengthen it (The Big Chill).

There was one very gross moment early, that made my wife turn away, but that I thought was the sexiest, most sensual, eating scene since Tom Jones. Look at the woman's expression while she chews....
Highly recommended, as is the book by the same name.",1328054400,,1334,4.522821576763485
4886509,4,B005SQRYGY,"As a fan of Jack Ketchum's work...I had to see the movie too!  This (with most horror films) isn't for the faint of heart, or for people easily offended (for some reason I feel if you are searching for this movie I shouldn't have to point this out).  The movie is based on a man finding and keeping a feral woman...for his own twisted reasons.  I found that although this in itself was disturbing, the rest of the relationships in the movie were just as screwed up and to some extent even worse.  I liked the fact the movie didn't look ""cheap,"" I watch quite a few horror flicks and sometimes it's difficult to get very far because the movie is just so poorly put together...not the case for this one!  The psychological thrill ride is great!  A must for the Ketchum fan or horror fans in general!",1327881600,3,797,4.351351351351352
4886510,5,B005SQRYGY,"Wow!  Having loved the book I couldn't wait to see if the movie would be true to the story line.  It definitely was and then some!  I actually feel dirty after watching the film, significantly disturbed by the images I witnessed.  The perfect horror movie full of delightful twists, turns and secrets.  I will say, the gorey parts were a little hokey, more rubbery than sinewy but that is my only complaint.  Highly recommend for the horror buffs out there like me!",1327795200,,465,4.609756097560975
4886511,5,B005SQRYGY,so twisted...great horror movie for any horror fan.....a must see for sure.........a bit slow in the beginning but its worth the wait..........loved the characters...controlling dad played perfectly...repressed wife.....son who was a serial killer in the making LOL & a daughter too scared to even breath wrong....they all portrayed their characters wonderfully.........and oh the dogs...great storyline there...and with a twist...one u will not guess (at least i think one won't )......loved it........!!!!,1327708800,7,507,6.154929577464789
8485325,2,B005SQRYGY,"Come with a strong stomach for this one. Extremely depraved behavior with some unnecessary carnage and innocents brutalized. And now for the spoilers: I think this movie would have been redeemed if the Woman only went after the men and left all the women as survivors, but that did not happen. Not sure why the mom got killed or the teacher. I suppose it was an attempt to make this a horror that will leave you empty inside.",1529452800,,425,4.461538461538462

8485329,5,B005SQRYGY,Incredible movie if you can deal with it. The woman is amazing and knows what she needs to do because she just survives. The dysfunctional family is played well to the point where you believe the feral woman is more righteous...and she is.,1522886400,,239,4.5813953488372094

8485331,5,B005SQRYGY,"absolutely fantastic...a sad, all too many times true tale, of misogyny to the extreme degree...and what's coming to those ignorant fools.

Pollyanna Mcintosh is fantastic as the ""monster"" from the woods...but we discover quickly who the real monster(s) are in this family.

The post-credit bit is an acid trip, but to see the little girl again is worth it...she's a cute fantastic little actress.",1518048000,,397,5.1875
8485332,5,B005SQRYGY,"It's Oct 25th (2016) and my first feature of the day was Jack Ketchum and Lucky McKee's The Woman, a sequel to Jack Ketchum's Offspring. A powerfully dark and disturbing tale of extreme horror, made in a beautifully unique way, with an explosive climax in film history!!! It features Pollyanna McIntosh, Sean Bridgers and The Iconic Angela Bettis, with their mind blowing Oscar worthy performances. Great special effects, great soundtrack, and so many more great things about it. The movie itself truly deserves an Oscar, but we all know movies like these don't exist at the Oscars. A movie I will never stop watching and personally one of my favorites!!!",1517961600,,655,4.963636363636364

8485334,5,B005SQRYGY,"!!! Got this as a gift for my dad who is a huge horror movie buff and I was so AMAZED AND GRATIFIED when he hadn't even heard of it before. (Actually I found it on a listicle somewhere of the ""Top 10 best horror movies you've never even heard of"") and he and I both loved it. Super creepy but well-done. I didn't think it came off low-budget -- the story is very character-oriented and doesn't require a super high budget I think. More of a psychological thriller that just happens to have a ton of gore.",1515628800,,504,4.153061224489796
