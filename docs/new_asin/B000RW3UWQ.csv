God Bless America!  Wait, he already has......

Great video for discussions, teaching and getting people to think about wealth.",1317340800,,209,5.46875
8202663,5,B000RW3UWQ,"We used this video to help people think about stewardship.  It was very effective with all age groups (even our resident 90 year old called it ""powerful"").  The backdrop is confusing (it's something about a car, commercials, and old and new), but the message is not.  And it is full of the truth about being rich and good news about being rich.  Fabulous resource and only 12 minutes long!",1222560000,,389,4.594202898550725
8202664,4,B000RW3UWQ,"There are better Nooma's out there, but this one brings up some interesting points.  If you are new to Rob Bell, and the Nooma series, they are great ways to bring about small group discussion by presenting this 10-15 minute video which are based on various relevant topics facing Christians today.  Really, he has some of the best material out there, and I have yet to find one that wasn't relevant.  This one is quite relevant, but not quite his best work.  Recommended.",1216080000,,472,4.650602409638554
