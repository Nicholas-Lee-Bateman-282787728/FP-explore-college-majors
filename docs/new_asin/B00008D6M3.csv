7981613,3,B00008D6M3,"Other videos by Lefty are excellent.  This one is good but not great.  Overall it is a good place to get started with fly fishing for Bass.  There is good content, but as an experienced warm water fly fisher, I didn't get any major insights from the video.  If you only fly fish for trout, you should learn a lot from the video.",1167868800,,328,4.158730158730159
