7950790,5,B00005QJHI,"I'll be honest and say that the video for this song doesn't particularly move me one way or the other- was actually hoping for something a bit more risque from the cover photo. It's actually reminiscent of a more famous Queen video called ""The Miracle"" in which kids play the Queen members. But I have to give this video single 5 stars for being such an amazing return to form. How is it possible that New Order reunites and makes a song (and, frankly, CD) which is so worthy of the New Order legacy? It's almost like they didn't miss a step. This song is genius. It would be great from any band but it's unmistakably New Order in their prime. New Order has a brilliant second act (or, if you include Joy Division, Third Act) ahead of them if they can keep it at this level. Bravo!!!",1072396800,,783,4.297297297297297
7950791,1,B00005QJHI,"My god, this was a disapointment! When I got this I thought it might have the extra features that the import version supposedly had. No dice, instead I'm stuck with a DVD containing two videos for the same song. Pretty damn bad, and even though I'm a diehard New Order fan this had no place in my collection. Don't waste your money, surely they'll do a DVD video collection as that seems to be the latest craze.",1053129600,3,411,4.35064935064935
7950792,5,B00005QJHI,"Yes it only has two versions of the same song on it. That is no secret here when you order it. That's why it is in the new format of ""DVD Single"" Key word there folks. But as for the music, I can't get enough of NO. I collect these things so the fact that it only has two songs on it does not phase me. I have the UK version of the DVD as well with other tracks on it and  in it's own way, it is just as collectable. And New Order keep the strong tradition alive of not appearing in their videos in any great capacity. Cool! That is fantastic!! Wait until you see the 60 MPH video!!! Too funny.
So if you are not stuck in 1987 (Read: Eighties)and can pull yourself away from the the old boring versions of ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" and ""True Faith"" then the choice is ""Crystal"".",1007337600,,776,4.006451612903226
7950793,2,B00005QJHI,"Far from what I like. If you like ""True Faith"", ""Blue Monday"" or Bizarre Love triangle, then you'll be as dissapointed as I was when I got this song. The remix is acceptable, but not what New Order was for me, if this song shows how the album is, then be sure I will not buy the album. The video is as stupid as anything you've seen before. The remix version video was made with $10 at most.
If you like the old New Order (80's), then forget about this DVD. try instead the new Pet Shop Boys live concert - Montage.",1006560000,3,515,4.0588235294117645
7950794,3,B00005QJHI,"Well, it is what it says:  the Crystal video on DVD.  The UK release did have some Reading tracks on it but only very short teasers.  I would recommend the full length New Order DVD above either of the Crystal DVDs if you really want to get a feel of the band.  If you want to complete a collection then shell out the cash for this one.",1004486400,4,336,3.970149253731343
7950795,2,B00005QJHI,"I just got this in the mail, and I have to say I'm disappointed. Why? Because it's only got two tracks -- two different versions of the ""Crystal"" video! I mean, it's a great song and an entertaining video, but crikey, what a ripoff!
I saw an import of this, and it included an audio b-side, plus three DVD clips from Reading '98 -- this has none of those!
So if you've got ten bucks to drop on one song, do so. Meanwhile, I'm gonna return my unopened, and lament the fact that there's no product information for this disc!",1003449600,7,522,4.23
