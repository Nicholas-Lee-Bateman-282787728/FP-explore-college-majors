7797779,5,1572527048,I really liked the movie.  It was somewhat on the light side with some eccentric characters and an interesting variety of personalities.  The con man husband and the drifter who fancied himself a lady's man.  The sincere young fellow who the young lady leans on.  The Priest and church are trying to encourage some of the characters at the same time some of the characters are trying to use them as a front in their scam.  I just thought the movie cut across many of our human emotions and the struggle we all have between doing the right thing or the selfish thing.  It does it in a rather humorous way with some serious moments too.  I haven't watched it in a while but had been trying to remember the title.  Glad I found it on here.,1394928000,,736,4.321167883211679
7797780,2,1572527048,"THE BIG SQUEEZE (1996) tells a story of a fight between a man and
his wife  over a medical disability and health insurance claim paid
out by an insurer to them, in a lump sum.

Although this isn't made clear at all in the outset (the film
suggesting a sinister plot) much of the film, unfortunately or not,
is a parody of fundraisers done by NP0's, such as religious
organizations of all kinds, that are in dire straights in this day
and age from the taxman's cut, the need to meet construction codes
of building in public use, and from atheism in the population.

The target audience is obviously the below 21 bracket, considering
the obsessive, idealistic or utopic outlook on life, that revolves
centrally around what may or may not happen at a specific bar,
specific people, not excluding the essential lovemaking scenes.

There's the Michelle Pfeiffer lookalike, Lara Flynn B0yle (in look,
mannerisms and acting), as well as a Ted Danson clone in the form
of Luca Bercovici or a young Geraldo Rivera cameleon Danny Nucci,
all doing fine jobs on screen, in projecting an aura of innocence,
youth, calmness, a relaxed friendliness throughout the 90 mins.
This allows the movie to  bring forth the human, personal aspects
of the characters, that is important in keeping people interested
and the gags alive.

They organize a fund raiser for chuch repairs required by a revised
municipal building code for earthquakes, and is led by Peter
Dobson, who plays a mix between playboy, grifter and conman,
setting up the mark, Bercovici, in anticipation of cashing in on
the insurance cash that the latter refuses to split evenly with his
wife, Boyle.

The fact that a pan and scan format was chosen is an omen. This is
not a visual movie (aside from projecting the charisma, good humor
and freshness of the cast), but rather a comedy, such that the
focal point is the dialog, the twists and the reactions of the
characters to each turn in events.

The soundtrack for the most part is adequate, skillfully composed,
although the band playing some covers of 6O's numbers will make
some cringe.

They plan to score $120k,  and to blow town, splitting the amount
among themselves, with little fear, remorse of bilking a church, an
entire community, or so they plan to... it's ""time to make lemonade
out of the lemons"" by squeezing the marks, says Dobson.

Overall, this picture is not spectacular enough for theatres unless
you are in the target demographic, but the makers should be
congratulated for making a funny and interesting movie, indeed, on
a taboo topic of fundraisers.",1182038400,,2572,4.809523809523809

One that's mellow, that's subtle, that lies on your tongue and slowly melts... One of those movies is  this one. Subtle. Delightful. Funny. Just like great chocolate!",940550400,3,287,4.519230769230769
