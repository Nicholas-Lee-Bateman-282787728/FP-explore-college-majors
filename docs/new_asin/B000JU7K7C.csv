8639335,2,B000JU7K7C,"I'm a big Enigma fan and I had high expectations for this DVD.  While the ""A Posteriori"" album was itself quite good, this DVD was not.  It was basically the album playing to what looked like a poor, shaky, very low-res Windows Media visualization.  The (no doubt) hastily-thrown-together Cretu interview did not make it worth the price, nor did the ""photogallery"" of 6 or so Cretu close-ups, nor did the inclusion of 4 remix tracks set to slightly better-quality visualizations.  I am quite disappointed, really, and I recommend spending your money elsewhere.",1168387200,5,560,5.054347826086956
