8026276,1,B0002CR0EK,"I'm familiar with Josh's work having read his guide to paranormal investigations.  All I can say is finally there is video evidence at how LEMUR is so L-A-M-E!

This film in short is Josh, who presents no evidence at all that ghosts exist in this house.  It has him repeatedly using words like ""Ghastly"", ""Creepy"" when there is no such thing on site.  He starts off by showing some pretty cheap ""atomic"" clocks and temperature sensors that can barely be accurate.  Yet he didn't have a laser temperature reader?  Really?

He used a mic with a dish that amplifies sound... so a normal crick or creak in an old house will be amplified, then he says how amazed he is by this noise.  Frankly, I find all that noise amazing too but with the soundtrack, trusting this gypsy sideshow film producer is difficult.

What are the orbs?  Simple... Josh was using led or low light emitting flashlights.  After he ionized the air and ran around a bit... or even ran his fan, the dust in the air started to flow.  Simple as that, dust will start to look for places to cling to when an ionizer is used.  In fact, this is why the sell them in department stores for homes to help eliminate odors that are carried by ""airborne particles""  not ghosts Josh!

Want to see how silly this fiasco is?  View it on netflix or get a pirated copy.  22$ for this disc?  Really?  It's 25 minutes long and is full of crap!

This should be retitled... Alone... cause I have no budget... Or Alone on tape because I have a car payment. Discredits all the former work he has done... glad to see this and glad I didn't have to pay for it to see it.  You absolutely should not!",1293580800,,1639,4.343234323432343
8026277,1,B0002CR0EK,"I'm so glad I saw this as a Instant Play on Netflix because I would have been highly upset if I actually paid for this.  It wasn't ""spine-chilling and deeply thought-provoking.""  It was lame.  Warren was extremely annoying and melodramatic.  The ""scary"" monster voice made me laugh.  I felt more like I was watching a mockumentary than a documentary.  Don't waste your money!",1262476800,,375,4.873015873015873
8026278,1,B0002CR0EK,"Yes, I'm mad! But as I always cope by looking for ways things could've been worse, at least I paid the Amazon.com discounted price for it. Because if I'd have paid $27.95 for this thing like the producers of this DVD wanted...pissed off is not the word. This was a GYP. Gyp, ya hear me - GYP! If Mr. Warren was only gonna show me insects getting caught in a light & call them orbs...or spend too bloody much time explaining the workings of how his equipment operates...you'd think SOMEBODY would have advised him to stretch the time a little more.  At least STAY in that house UNTIL YOU CAME UP WITH A GHOST. Please, future filmmaking salespersons - DON'T do this kind of thing again. It was highway robbery. -J.G.",1249430400,,714,4.450381679389313

8026281,5,B0002CR0EK,"As a longtime ghost hunter, this documentary is the most realistic depiction I've seen of an actual ghost investigation. The host presents the material in an honest, straightforward way, and allows the viewer to see what does, or does not, happen. It's by far the best video I've seen on how to conduct a ghost investigation using a wide range of different tools. This documentary is not intended to be some cheezy scare fest, or a thrill ride. It's mainly an instructional guide for serious people who want to understand how to properly research a haunted house. The host not only explains how equipment works (like EMF meters, night vision scopes, etc.) but also theories about what a ghost might actually be. If you want to be scared, don't buy this documentary, but if you want some serious, mature, intelligent insight on professional ghost hunting, this is a perfect addition to your library. The location is wonderful and the documentary is never boring, especially considering it was a 100 percent one-man project. Warren has a lot of experience and it shows.",1104105600,4,1067,4.900552486187845
8026282,1,B0002CR0EK,"I'll admit it.  I bought this dvd over the internet based on its title and the premise, so in some aspects you can say it was my own fault.  I like trashy movies and reality shows about haunted houses.  But THIS!  ALONE IN A HAUNTED HOUSE is a rip-off from start to finish.  Notice the technical details.  What's missing?  NO RUNNING TIME is LISTED.  Why?  Because this ""documentary"" is only about 25 MINUTES LONG!  I thought something was amiss when ""paranormal investigator"" Joshua P. Warren, who speaks with a delivery from the William Shatner/Adam West/Raymond Burr school of acting, says about 10 minutes into the show that it's 1:00am!  So you sit back, expecting the next 80 minutes to be slam-bang, only 15 minutes later, it ends!  No slam, no bang!

The pompous Mr. Warren shows up at a haunted mansion in North Carolina to spend the night alone and record whatever supernatural data he can.  He shows no signs of anxiety whatsoever, even though he says he's somewhat nervous.  He shows us the gadgets he intends to use to record on videotape, digital photography and audio any ghosts that may be inhabiting the house.  And what does he get?  Glowing dots called ""orbs"" and clanking, bumping sounds on audio.  That's it.  Is the house, in fact, haunted?  Maybe, he declares at the end.

""Ghost Hunters"" on Sci-Fi Channel is creepier, more involving and generally displays more exciting paranormal activity in any one of its hour-long episodes than ALONE IN A HAUNTED HOUSE does, and is a much better bargain when you see ALONE's $20+ price tag.

Treat ALONE like a vengeful ghost...and BEWARE!",1099440000,15,1602,4.7700729927007295
