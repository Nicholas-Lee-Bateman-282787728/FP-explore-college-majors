I am amazed that Marshall uses his hands while painting with some pretty toxic materials but when I googled him 4/2017 he is still alive at 80. My art professors would be having fits about exposing your skin to the paints and mediums. I do have one disappointment. The video refuses to play past a certain point in the section called ""Scared Monkey"" I have used two different DVD players and I get the same results. Does anyone know why this is happening?",1493164800,,537,4.489795918367347

The man himself is extra interesting because he's not only so talented but  self-effacing as well, but in a healthy , fun way.  He does not take himself seriously, and shares EVERYTHING regarding his technique.  He holds nothing back like so many instructors do.  The man appears to be amazingly transparent.  The camera work is first rate, nothing is missed.  He does not use brushes but mainly his hands as well as various implements.  I'm buying this one for my own library.  Highest recommendation",1335916800,5,632,4.571428571428571
