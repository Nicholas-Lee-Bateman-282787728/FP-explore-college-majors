7027031,5,B00U0QX3JY,Bleach is probably my favorite. Its a shame they didn't continue along with the manga. Set 26 is all I need to complete the set now. I've been irritated to have to purchase so many sets to complete the collection- Viz you are greedy.,1462492800,,233,4.318181818181818

8703703,4,B00U0QX3JY,"Of the official manga arcs of Bleach, this is my least favorite. It's ten times better than any of the anime filler arcs, but it just doesn't have heart or the rest of canon Bleach.

Some parts are too silly, some serious material is not treated properly.

It's a redemption Arc where Ichigo tries to get his powers back, but I found it to be boring in spots which I can't really say for the rest of canon. It's mostly a training Arc that isn't nearly interesting, fun, or silly as the ones with Urahara, Yoruichi, or the Vaizard.

I bought this to watch with my kid because they don't play it on Adult Swim anymore.

I personally don't think you'd be missing anything if you just read the manga and skipped this arc of the anime. They cancelled the anime before the final conclusion of the manga arc, so you're not really missing anything to skip this one.",1529798400,,857,4.371069182389937
