5699436,1,B00C8CQ5SO,Don't be misled by the comparison to the movie kids.  This is a pg13 movie with little plot line and build up.  I'm pretty sure kids in Europe do more interesting stuff than what was shown in the movie.,1380326400,6,202,4.153846153846154

5699440,3,B00C8CQ5SO,"Lots of nudity aimless dialogue..teenagers adrift with little sense of purpose, goals career...living for the moment,little thought of tomorrow...provides aEuropean contrast to the American experience..rather scary in its portrayal of aimless drifting..what happens when these types wake up middle aged losers?",1378252800,3,310,6.585365853658536
5699441,4,B00C8CQ5SO,"""Klip"" (aka ""Clip"") probably will not appeal to a wide-ranging audience, and there are several potential reasons for that...
It is made in a documentary style, and may be considered somewhat boring because it essentially just depicts a few weeks in the life of a Serbian teenage girl. Also, it is in Serbian language with English subtitles; and many people don't enjoy having to 'read' movies. Plus, it may offend some viewers with it's hard-hitting depictions of teenage drinking, drug use, and sexual promiscuity.
However, beyond those potential limitations, ""Klip"" is actually a competently made and well acted movie. And the kind of movie which is capable of leaving the viewer pondering what they have seen, long after the end credits have finished rolling.

""Klip"" gives us a brief glimpse into the life of Jasna. She is a 14-year-old girl, living in a decayed Serbia. She has a dysfunctional relationship with her family; she seems to have contempt for her mother, and essentially ignores her father and younger sister. Jasna also enjoys partying, drinking and drug taking far too much. And in her attempts to secure the affections of a boyfriend, she essentially allows herself to be used and abused by him.

Isidora Simijonovic gives an inspired performance as Jasna; realistically conveying teen angst, anger, sadness, bewilderment, excitement, and desperation. (I also was surprised by how much I thought Isidora resembles the American actress Emma Roberts).
First-time writer and director Maja Milos has successfully made ""Klip"" a low-key but thought-provoking movie. And I believe this movie is a commendable starting point for potential international career's for both it's Writer/Director and Lead Actress.

Quite simply: A very good movie, which is likely to only be appreciated by those viewers who can comprehend and accept what it is... rather than what they mistakenly think it should be.",1375056000,112,1908,5.249180327868852

I liked the photography and the creative use of various camera types and angles. I don't want to spoil the movie by saying too much.

My advice to susceptible audiences is:

If you don't like foreign style movies, this is not for you.
If you think that the credits scenes at the end of the Hangover movie were awful, you might not like this movie.

5699584,3,B00C8CQ5SO,"""Clip"" is a downer that will make you realize that American teenagers aren't the only despicable pieces of s--- on the planet...apparently Serbian teenagers not only are just as bad, they might even be worse.

(Inevitably that leads you back the ultimate problem, which is adults--specifically, parents. But I digress.)

Jasna (Isidora Simijonovic) is a loser, a drugged-out, oversexed 14 year old who is selfish, emotionless and generally just disgusting. If there is one thing positive to say about her, what we see in this movie at least is that she is pretty monogamous. Except that she gloms onto just about the worst possible male that she could have, a total sicko punk a couple of years older than her that gets off on (just to name a few) making her act like a literal dog and telling her that she's no good for anything other than hard anal sex. And all of the other girls want this guy too. Go figure.

""Clip"" refers to Jasna's constant video recording of so many of these moments in her life to share with others, using a mobile phone. Oh yeah, this definitely could have been set in the United States and not Serbia. Although one thing that does paint Serbia as particularly ugly is the way that the school system functions--or, more accurately, doesn't. Nobody is paying attention, students get up and wander around of their own free will, sex is taking place in the bathrooms (and even hallways) throughout the day. Drugs are distributed and used stem to stern. The teachers have no control, the students don't care and there seems to be nothing even approaching discipline. We can at least say that school isn't like that in our country.

Jasna's home life isn't the best, with money problems and a father who is dying of cancer, but her detached, unfeeling way of dealing with it will make any decent human being want to scream at her. And really, that's exactly what the writer/director was going for here I think. She's painting a bleak picture, but it's a real image--just not a very entertaining one. Newcomer Simijonovic puts in a flawless performance, and the maturity that she brings in delivering such an immature character is just brilliant.

However, it isn't until we get far into the movie, when Jasna visits an orphanage, that this film actually held my attention. A little girl immediately takes a shine to Jasna, and for the first time she seems human. (The little girl also did a fantastic job in this role.)

Unfortunately it doesn't hold long, and Jasna goes back to being gross and seeing her gross boyfriend, so we're free to hate her and her whole generation again.

As an American you can take a certain amount of solace in knowing that teenagers aren't acting this way only here in the States. As a resident of our Earth it's a bit petrifying to realize that maybe they're all this bad no matter where you go.",1400371200,13,2849,4.674650698602794

The thing about the movie that really struck me, and I think it relates to the reality experienced by everyone in today's civilized society; the separate worlds that the girl inhabited, the one that went on inside her head and the remote, real world from which she had been tragically removed.  There was the real world of her family; mother, sister, dying father, grandparents.  Then there was the synthetic, electronic world of the smart phone where she filmed herself and posted herself.  Her friends, even though they were real people, only existed insofar as they were related to this made up world that was destroying her life, as well as theirs.  The drugs, the sex, the raves even the politics, were for the most part meaningless, other than how they related to the World Wide Web and mechanisms of escape.  Her blood, her excrement, her vomit that convulsed out of her resulted from this mindless detachment and violence of this fake world that sucked her in and spat her back out all for the sake of escapist entertainment over reality.  Through it all, reality continued, life went on and death loomed.  Her dying father that she could no longer see (much less feel), had been erased from her life into the trash bin of the fantasy world that had taken her.

5699606,1,B00C8CQ5SO,"The cover of the DVD says it all - young slut taking a pornographic ""selfie"".  The girl - name of Jasna - is a smart-alecky teen who carries on as sluts do apparently all over the world.  The template is pretty clearcut:  Dress like a slut, go to a dance club and dance like a slut, do drugs, drink, meet a boy and do with him what sluts do.  Oh, and act all cold and distant toward your parents (especially your father, who's dying of cancer).

This move is a piece of s***.  Don't believe the hype on the packaging.  There's nothing uplifting about it at all, no artistry to the cheap, sordid and bleak production.  The age of the actress who played the girl is unclear, but even if she's over 18, doing the sort of pornogrpahic things the character actually does in the move could subject the producer and director to charges of having produced child pornography given that she's playing a 14-year-old character.

I know the neoliberal economic order has done a number on Serbia, as it has many other countries around the world, but that in itself cannot legitimize the boorish behavior we see depicted or the production, which adds nothing positive to the world and engenders in the viewer neither identification with nor sympathy for any character, save the little ho's suffering parents (the mothers hysterical tears, captured on the girl's cellphone camera being the only true emotional moment of the film).  Yes, I know Milosevic was a monster, but I doubt this sort of trash would have been openly produced while he was in power, and there's something to be said for that.",1386028800,7,1581,4.634408602150538

5699609,1,B00C8CQ5SO,terrible movie with completely boring plot. The behavior of the young girl that bounces between intense sexual desire and her lack of interest for her family makes no sense what so ever. Don't waste your time.,1384819200,3,209,4.833333333333333
5699610,5,B00C8CQ5SO,"This film was very good, but difficult. It follows 14 year old Jasna and her relations with her family and friends. As for her family relations, I guess some would call it dysfunctional. There is a lot going on there, what with her father having Cancer. Jasna finds her escape with her friends and the club scene. This leads to experimentation of all kinds. In my opinion, she is used by her boyfriend, but I guess she allowed herself to be used. When I was watching this, I was reminded of Larry Clark's KIds and to a lesser degree, Ken Park.  Isidora did a great job in her first lead role. It is said that she was 14 when the filming started , but turned 15 during filming. It was also a good start fro the Director's debut film.",1384819200,33,732,4.266187050359712

Nice glimpse of what appears to be Eastern Europe life (aspiring middle class in the midst of poverty) for their teens.",1383264000,21,385,4.602941176470588
5699612,4,B00C8CQ5SO,"The acting was perfect. Isidara was marvelous, and the story was told as it should be told. People don't SAY what they feel so much as directly SHOW it in their actions.

The camera is, however, trained far more on male private parts (at least one of them rubberized) than female. That's unusual, so I'm not sure I should criticize the braver choice, even if I don't prefer it.",1381708800,27,377,4.463768115942029
8578724,1,B00C8CQ5SO,"Absolute waste of time.  This masquerades as ""art house"" - it isn't. It contains virtually no redeeming value. The characters are shallow, and you end up not caring about any of them. The lead character - as hard as the film begs you to sympathize with her - is so devoid of morality or anything but pure selfishness and an entirely unexplained love affair with her own debauchery and violence - that you really don't care anything about her or whether she lives or dies.  The most disturbing thing about it is that it is pornographic. Don't get me wrong - I like indie films and have no issue with erotica. In fact, I'm a published writer with a few erotic books under my belt. This isn't erotic. It's straight up, mean-spirited, empty, for-titillation's-sake PORN.  To top that off, turns out the lead actress was in fact a child when it was filmed - 15 at end. There is explicit frontal nudity of her, masturbation, and her performing fellatio - explicitly. In other words, this is child porn. Thanks for the warning, Amazon.",1531094400,,1028,4.60655737704918
