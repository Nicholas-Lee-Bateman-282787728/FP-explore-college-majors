683068,4,6303581307,"The Burning Bed,"" based on actual events, is the story of Francine Hughes (Farrah Fawcett), who set fire to her home with her sleeping husband Mickey inside. After confessing to murder, she is arrested and as she relates her story to her court-appointed lawyer, we see flashbacks providing background on the incidents leading up to her crime.

Francine marries her small-town high-school sweetheart Mickey (Paul Le Mat, American Graffiti) only to discover his temper is short and his behavior violent. Subjected to repeated beatings, she makes several attempts to escape, but finds little help. Urged to hang in there by her family and an overwhelmed, broken social welfare system, she suffers continuous abuse until desperation leads her to end Mickeys abuse once and for all.

Ms. Fawcett, who achieved fame on the TV series Charlies Angels, is extremely effective as a woman trapped in a bad marriage. Francine is fearful that her kids will be harmed, and is frustrated by her inability to get the help she needs. Her plight, unfortunately, is shared by many women in similar circumstances, and that is why the film resonated so strongly when first aired in 1984. The Burning Bed was one of the first movies to deal with a subject that had been taboo for years.

Bonus materials on the unrated Blu-ray release include an interview with director Robert Greenwald and a trailer gallery.",1511308800,2,1387,4.995670995670996

I wanted to make sure that it wasn't scratched or anything, that was my biggest fear. I bought the most expensive one because it was used but in new/almost new condition. It was a lot for a movie, so I really wanted to make sure that every penny spent was on a scratch free DVD. It arrived, I opened it, and was very pleased. The disc wasn't scratched anywhere, it's caseing was beautifully clean, & watching it was amazing. Is it worth it?

683175,5,6303581307,"Saw this on TV when it came out as a SPECIAL. A harsh look at women's abuse at the hands of their 'loves'. For those who were strong enough to flee an abusive relationship it gives closure to know you are not alone or misunderstood. For those still in denial, it is an eye opener. The bottom line.....NO MAN HAS A RIGHT TO STRIKE HIS SPOUSE FOR ANY REASON. Or as a final lesson in this film, if you can't find help, keep looking ladies. These abusers are not real man in any sense of the word. There is absolutely NO LOVE behind their actions, YOU are not at fault, you are WORTH more. ",1465084800,6,586,4.140350877192983

What women went through especially in the rural 60's and 70's. This would not be allowed now. If people needed to recieve help and really advocated for themselves. there is help. Some women are ""stuck"" and scared to get help fearing for thier lives and children. The abuser instills a fear so deep within them all they can do is hope for a good day! {being alive} This woman begged for help but family{the mothers on both sides} and law had an excuse for everything and or simply looked away. I do not believe in killing at all!!!! No one gave her an out. Whether temporary insanity or i think self preservation{also for her babies}she hadnt a CHOICE. This movie should be seen by all early in puberty then again maybe is psych classes with long discusions. Well made and The acting amazing!

I was captivated with Farrah Fawcett's performance and how truly realistic and emotionally traumatizing a life like this would be.  The acting was exceptional by the entire cast, and I feel despite all the hooplah about Fawcett's performance in Extremities, it pales in comparison.  Fawcett should have received an award for her performance in this film, and I feel that due to the sensitive nature of the subject it was pushed under the rug.  Once the topic of wife abuse became more recognized later on down the road anyone and everyone was making films on the subject, but not a one of them could compare to this truly well made rendition.  Once the DVD version became available, I had to buy one but at a price, as it was a rare, hard to find commodity.

This TV-movie is the one that really put Farrah on the map as a serious dramatic actress when it originally aired to great acclaim back in 1984.

The sad thing is, the subject matter is still relevant today, and the film itself is in no way dated.

It spans the years 1963-77 and Fawcett plays Francine Hughes, who meets and eventually marries the slightly older Mickey Hughes, played by Paul Le Mat.

Though Mickey displays early signs of abuse toward Francine, she tolerates it because of his apologetic nature following each incident, and the fact he has trouble finding work and is stressed by having the couple living with his parents.

Speaking of the parents, I found them to be much scarier than Mickey because of they way they turned a blind eye and refused to help and sided with their son, despite his violent nature.

James T. Callahan (""Charles in Charge"") plays Farrah's father-in-law, and Grace Zabriskie plays mother-in-law Flossie, a backwards-thinking Southern woman who lies on the witness stand to protect her son. She gives a chilling portrayal and was only six years older than Farrah in real life!

The final beating showcases Fawcett's acting chops as she conveys sheer terror with only her eyes, and the climactic courtroom scene is also a standout when she tries to hold it all together.

The best TV role of Farrah's career came at the end of the '80s in ""Small Sacrifices"", but this one is a great runner-up!

683569,5,6303581307,"One of the greatest TV movies ever made, Farrah Fawcett proved she was an excellent actress that could do more than just be a pretty face from her days on  ""Charlie's Anegels"". I remember vividly when this movie made its debut on NBC in the fall of 1984. The network spent thousands promoting the film both in print and on the airwaves as the film became a must see event. ""The Burning Bed"" was based on a nonfiction novel written by Faith McNulty about a Michigan housewife and mother who is battered both physically and mentally by her husband for years. Finally one night after having too many beatings she sends her children to the car and sets her husband ablaze while he is sleeping. She eventually goes to the police and confesses what she did. The film is heartbreaking, well-acted, emotional, and most of all extremely graphic in its depiction of family violence. Farrah Fawcett actually suffered bruises from filming the physical abuse scenes. Paul LeMat plays the husband superbly and as a viewer you want his character to pay for the harm he has inflicted upon his wife. ""The Burning Bed"" went on to enjoy the highest ratings for any TV movie of the 1980's and is widely used in college classrooms as a tool in educating students on domestic abuse. Farrah Fawcett also recieved an Emmy Award nomination for Best Actress in a movie made for TV, but unfortunately lost.",1262736000,,1379,4.674897119341564

683571,5,6303581307,"""The Burning Bed"" is a made for tv movie based on the life of Francine Hughes while she was married to, divorced from, and after killing Mickey Hughes.  The movie displays the story by starting with the burning bed incident.  We see Francine coming out of the garage and into the house with a gas can in her hands.  The kids are already in the car when she sets fire to the bed.  They drive off after the fire is going and Francine turns herself in at the police station.  After that the story progresses through a series of flashbacks while undergoing preparation for trial.  Francine is found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity.

It feels like you are on the journey with Francine as she tries to get help from local law enforcement and social services offices.  Her efforts are fruitless not due to her lack of pursuit, but due to the negative responses from those who should have helped her.

What I don't think some people realize is how true this situation can be for others.  I have heard people dismiss the film as a piece of ""feminist tripe,"" which is too bad.

I felt claustrophobic while watching this movie, but obviously that was the intent of this story. A wife who could not escape the death-grip of her controlling and violent husband.

While the husband is a sick-bastard, Francine(Fawcett) does make some bad choices that help continue her trauma. Since this movie was made in the mid-80's, there are some familiar faces that you usually see popping up in made-for-tv movies from the late-70's till the mid-80's. Good but depressing movie.",1252540800,5,630,5.0576923076923075
683576,5,6303581307,"1984's THE BURNING BED was the movie that literally shocked America for two main reasons. It brought out of the closet the hideous reality of domestic abuse, as well as made people realize that FARRAH FAWCETT has amazing depth as a dramatic actress. This bit of cinema so helped the situation for so many struggling women, and made the general public see that FARRAH was so much more than a pretty face. Her perfomance was Emmy nominated and deservable so; and for the next twenty years MISS FAWCETT churned out many stellar performances mostly in television features. This piece holds up well twenty-five years later, and I highly recommend it, despite its often intense and uncomfortable subject matter. FARRAH FAWCETT recently died, and I found that sad as I thought she was a kind woman who was a much underated creative force. Other excellent performances worth noting are SMALL SACRIFICES, JEWEL, POOR LITTTLE RICH GIRL: THE BARBRA HUTTON STORY, DOUBLE EXPOSURE: THE STORY OF MARGARET BOURKE WHITE, THE SUBSTITUTE WIFE, and EXTREMITIES. Less well known is the fact she was a wonderful painter, sculpture, and most importantly a devoted mother. Rest in peace FARRAH as you will be much missed.........",1250640000,,1206,5.035

It often takes a famous person to bring out important issues into the limelight.  She has portrayed a domestic violence victim very well in this movie.  It's great that she chose to act in this movie to show how much she cares about women's issues.

You start to feel deeply for the children and their mother who suffer great abuse at the hands of their father/husband. This movie is full of vivid horrendous scenes that feel very real. You start to feel immense hatred towards the husband, his parents, and her mother. How can they sit back and do nothing when their son is beating on his wife infront of his children?! How can her own mother tell her to go back to her husband, that no matter what, her place is by his side?!

683592,5,6303581307,"The Burning Bed is the true story of a woman who endures years of abuse mental and physical from her husband before finally snapping and killing him. The subject matter is still as relevant today as it was when it was released to much acclaim in 1984. In fact it should be essential viewing and therapy for any abusive person to see how they destroy lives.
The movie would not have worked without the powerful central performance of Farrah Fawcett who deservedly was nominated for an Emmy and Golden Globe. She is abley supported by Paul Le Mat as the abusive husband and Garce Zabriskie as the apathetic mother in law. Although Fawcett had already turned in good performances in the 1981 movie Murder in Texas and on stage in Extremeties,it was this landmark tv movie that finally brought her recognition as a serious actress. Its a harrowing subject unsensationally handled and brilliantly written and acted.
Plaudits to MGM for releasing it on DVD however given the importance of the film and its subject its unfortunate that there are no 'extras'

How many times did nicole brown call the police on him and nobody did anything.how many women are killed by their abusers? statistics are staggering. a woman is victimized every 6 seconds, those are reported cases only. i am not saying it is right but when backed into a corner you will fight back the only way you can.",1167350400,4,715,4.188405797101449

The book blew me away, there were several horrific parts that should have been added to the movie to really tell the true story, its shocking.

683596,5,6303581307,"This was one of the first TV movies to deal with the serious subject of domestic abuse, which is still an ongoing problem.

Farrah Fawcett proves that she is much more than a pretty face with sparkling white teeth as Francine Hughes, a young woman who falls for a slightly older high school dropout, Mickey (Paul Le Mat), but after she marries him, discovers that he has some major anger issues, and, finding herself trapped in a nightmare of horrible mistreatment, seeks help, but her family and in-laws (whose bizarre denial almost calls for straight-jackets), basically tell her to stay put. On top of this, social services seems all too willing to look the other way.

Francine tries to make the best of her situation, she finds herself drawn back to him, and even after she manages to obtain a divorce, Mickey is still able to insinuate himself into her life, insisting that they need to be a family. No matter how many times she leaves him, or attempts to escape, he is always right on her heels, and uses their children as leverage in order to coerce her into reconciling with him. Even when law enforcement intervenes, it does not deter him. Mickey blames his behavior on his drinking, inability to hold down a job, and on Francine, and, like many abusive spouses, does everything and anything he can to rob her of her independence and sense of self-worth. He feels threatened when she even looks at other men, wears revealing clothing, and attempts to further her education. When he is severely injured in an auto accident, he is not above manipulating the situation to his advantage. Finally, Francine snaps. She douses the bedroom with gasoline as he lies in a drunken sleep, and lights a match, fleeing in her automobile with her offspring.

It then must be determined if she committed premeditated murder, or if she was temporarily unhinged.

The jury's verdict is in favor of the defense, and as people file out of the courtroom, Francine cuddles her children around her . . . . . .

People who have not experienced domestic violence themselves or studied this crime may not be sympathetic or understanding toward what these victims experience. There is indeed a string of victims, not just the abused partner in question but also the children. Ignorant individuals sometimes blame or second-guess the victims, typical questions, ""Why didn't she leave earlier?"", ""Why didn't she call the cops?"", or, ""Why does she keep going back to him?"" This film should be aired frequently, and has recently been released on DVD. Kudos to the cast for their realistic and heartbreaking portrayals in this true life story. This is an ongoing and serious issue that still needs to be addressed. Recommended.",1141171200,27,2705,4.833693304535637

683598,4,6303581307,"I watched this for the first time when it came on tv on Monday October 8th, 1984. It's still one of the most disturbing tv movies, and I still find it more disturbing than ""Amelia"" the movie with Ted Danson who plays a father who molests his daughter Amellia. I saw the actual beatings that Francine would experience in this movie where the actual seducing of Amellia was non-existent. I feel bad for Francine through this movie as she's feeling trapped at times, but there are also moments where she shows that people enjoy stomping on a heart that's good. I had watched another movie called ""Intimate Strangers"" with Dennis Weaver and Sally Struthers only 2 months earlier. There's a difference in the 2 movies. in Intimate Weaver's character admits he was physically abused by his father here there may have been some abuse that happened to Francine's husband, but it's not really disclosed. He does have a drinking problem, but there's one element that's explained here, and that's there's no excuse needed for a person to start abusing another person only the will and desire to do so. Francine's husband had the will and desire to do harm to her; it was well-veilled in the beginning, but then it only took for the husband's family to barge in on them shortly after returning from the honeymoon. It appears that the husband resented having his family show up unannounced, and probably uninvited, and he dind't handle it too well which leads me to believe that he would've abused Francine regardless that day. Who knows? However, once it started it grew more and more disturbing with every time it happened, but the last time was the worst because it showed that he was probably getting off from hitting her, and this was after she complied with burning her school books, but this was to foreware her if she ever did it again. I applaud what she did as she felt there was no other recourse. I say this because I did exhibit abuse behavior towards my wife. Not necessarily striking her physically, but slamming doors, pounding my fist, the terrifying glare, and alot of put-downs and painful words. I do need help with this as it makes me an abuser. I know alot of my family would think that I'm too drastic with my reasoning, but let's face it I needed to keep the upper hand on things to keep me from slamming myself down, or feel like others were. I need help with this before getting involved with another woman. This is something that all schools should show to help people with relationships.",1136678400,3,2502,4.650112866817156

While he did take it to the extreme, I have to agree that she deserved a whuppin' for making him a TV dinner. After a long hard day o' drinkin' a mans got to have some supper!

683635,4,6303581307,"The prelude to this 1984 NBC-TV movie was a massive media blitz about Farrah Fawcett's chances of proving her acting worthiness. It was, and still is to some extent, unfortunate because it detracted from the purpose of the film: to bring the then-generally hushed family secret of domestic violence into the light and elevate it as a matter of public policy. Fawcett, of course, proved beyond anyone's doubt her acting prowess, and watching her as a deglamorized, demoralized and traumatized physically battered wife was a shock of extremities at the time. Before ""Burning Bed,"" who saw Fawcett as anything other than a giggly sex kitten? The film opens with a clearly beaten Fawcett nearly roboticized in the mechanics of carrying a container of gas into the bedroom where her drunken husband has passed out after what we learn later is his latest (and last) in countless wife-beating episodes that lasted for nearly a decade. It is no consolation watching Fawcett's character of Francine douse her husband and then ignite him and his bed with a match. What follows is the obligatory murder trial where, in mostly flashbacks by way of interviews with her court-appointed attorney (unflappably played by Richard Masur) and trial testimony, Francine and corraborating witnesses recount the years of spousal violence. Through it all, at a time when domestic violence shamefully was pretty much still in the closet as one of those family embarrassments that no one discussed, director Robert Greenwald hits us with a painful and disarming portrait of the results of family violence. But Fawcett is shattering! She manages to project her character not only as someone to be pitied and as someone truly desperate but who, somewhere in all the demoralizing inflicted over 10 years, finds some courage within to end her vicitimization, even at the risk of a death sentence. And Fawcett's acting when her character takes the stand in her own defense is nothing less than riveting! Fawcett's truly beaten-down character makes it very easy to hope the worst for her victimizer (Paul Le Mat as the bullying wife-beater) and his nauseating supportive mother (character actress Grace Zabriskie in a magnificent portrayal). In the wake of ""Burning Bed,"" Fawcett herself appeared in public service announcements empowering battered women not to endure anymore, and the subject of domestic violence gained a status in the national diaglogue that it hadn't before. The film's message is still relevent and important today, unfortunately. But now, unlike the days when the real Francine faced her legal judgement, victims have more choices than the only one open to Francine. If for no other reason, though, Fawcett's performance is a must-see, and she'll numb you. It remains perhaps her greatest acting achievement!",1046044800,66,2799,5.1946902654867255
