8206130,5,B000SNUR8Y,"This is one of the most brilliant movies you've never seen!

It may initially appear to be nothing more than low-budget parody of 1950s schlock -- namely that one B-movie that has luchadores and vampires in it -- but after a mere three minutes, viewers will find themselves far beyond the tepid wading pool of pastiche, and floundering in some truly deep and strange waters indeed!  Just as the Venture Brothers starts from a foundation of Johnny Quest parody and expands into a uniquely mad universe, Mark of the Damned uses 1950s sci-fi/horror cheese as a launchpad from which it blasts off into a wild world of Eric Millers' own making, a world of half-sentient ""danger rings,"" of vampiric Aztec were-eyeballs who worship a face-pulling Lovecraftian god, of a zombie epidemic that has already become old hat to its denizens, and of a telepathic mad scientist who wishes to utilize the terrible power of the hypnoband (a little known segment of the electromagnetic spectrum) to transform himself in a way you'll just have to see!  All of the elements come at you so fast you'll have to watch multiple times to catch them all, but they reference one another in a way that creates a shockingly coherent world, one might even say . . . AN AMPLIFIED WORLD!

Comedy?  Yes, it is a comedy, with brilliantly awkward dialogue overdubbing all the actors' mouth movements; it would be the height of absurdity not to recognize the farcical nature of this awesomely fun flick.  The wacky milieu of Mark of the Damned, however, has so much depth that it deserves far more than its small-scale DVD release -- I'm talking Blu-Ray, big-time fandom, a guidebook, heck, maybe even a tabletop RPG!  Buy it, watch it, spread the news and make it happen!",1482710400,,1735,4.763333333333334
8206131,4,B000SNUR8Y,"Mark Of The Damned, while obviously inspired by the equally awesome Santo vs. las Mujeres Vampiro {Samson vs the Vampire Women}, is a movie all its own. I can assure you that even if I were to sum up the plot, there would be so much left out, so many quirky gems, that I couldn't do it justice.  Is it a good movie?  Not even close.  Sometimes a movie doesn't have to be good to be great though.  I wish it were captioned, as it would make it much easier to follow in places, but otherwise, it's a great combination with a favorite drink and a bit of free time.",1395964800,,561,4.072727272727272
