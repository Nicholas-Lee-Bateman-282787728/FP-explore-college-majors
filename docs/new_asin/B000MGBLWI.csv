I really identified with Phillip, not being  the cool guy in any situation I'm in. And of course the love interest is just amazing to watch and listen to.

The acting is a little awkward at times, the ending is a bit rubbish, and half the time you're even wondering why Marie would even care about the blond one, but the charm of the movie is that it's a really cute independent film.",1344816000,,525,4.188118811881188
8168503,1,B000MGBLWI,"Ok, I have seen some poor movies, but never have I experienced anger over the feeling of being robbed of both money and time.  But there's always a first, and this is it for me!  Flip A Coin is one of those ""independent"" movies, this one being from Britain, but doesn't deserve to be associated with a country that is known on this side of the pond for producing so many high quality features. This one is rubbish, amateurishly produced, stupid storyline, unconvincing acting, and an exceedingly annoying narrative that attempts to put cohesion to a failure of a story.  I got this movie in the bargain bin, but it's not even worth a tenth of the four dollars I paid for it.  And I can't believe I'm the first to write a review of it here at Amazon.  Maybe that should have been an indicator of the movie's total lack of merit.  Be warned!",1245196800,,839,4.380645161290323
