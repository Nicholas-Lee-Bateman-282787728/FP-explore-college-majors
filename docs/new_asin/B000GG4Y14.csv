2608927,5,B000GG4Y14,"ha ha very good andy. i haven't seen season 1, just dived straight into this season. it's silly and charming and funny. it borrows a bit from tim & eric but it adds enough of its own to stand up by itself. the other cast members are really funny in their own right especially larry and the guy who shouts. some of the ""on the street"" bits aren't that good but almost all the sketches are. the end.",1321747200,,397,4.102564102564102
2608928,5,B000GG4Y14,I loved the first season and the second season is just as great and original as the first.  I highly reccomend this set.  There is nothing out there that can compare to this show.  It is in a league of its own!  I hope season three comes out on DVD!,1312070400,2,249,3.92
2608929,4,B000GG4Y14,"If you like wierd comedy sketches that don't make sense and innocent bystanders on the streets of new york being subjected to the absurdity that is andy milonakis, you will love this item.  If you liked the first season you will like this one too because it is just more of the same.",1249344000,,283,4.339622641509434
2608930,5,B000GG4Y14,"This DVD release includes all 8 episodes of season two! It is packaged differently than Season One. It now has two slim cases with episode descriptions on back! This season features guest appearances by Paul Wall, Juelz Santana, Nick Carter, All-American Rejects, Mike Jones, Seth Green, Jimmy Kimmel & Shaun White. Special feautures include:
15 Un-aired Skits
Outtakes
Season 2 Music Video
Un-aired Credit Bits

Definitely buy if you are a Andy Milonakis fan. Hopefully Amazon will release season 3 through its CreateSpace program.",1237939200,,532,5.333333333333333

8131727,5,B000GG4Y14,"I laughed, I cried, I shot snot out of my nose trying to imitate Mutti.  I've watched The Complete Second Season of The Andy Milonakis Show so many times that my IQ has dropped 24 points.  But do I care?  Absolutely not.  Andy Milonakis' flawless satire has brought joy to my life and I would recommend this to every man, woman, child, and unsuspecting pizza delivery man.",1364860800,,372,4.507462686567164
