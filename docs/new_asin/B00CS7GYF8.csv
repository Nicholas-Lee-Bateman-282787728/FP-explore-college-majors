5737286,4,B00CS7GYF8,Waited so long for this movie! Love this movie. Love that it is on DVD! Now it's at my mom's house! Wonder when I'll get it back! I had it just a week when she asked to borrow. That has been a month maybe longer! She loves this movie as much as I do. I did not have to wait long for it to arrive.,1374883200,,296,3.5692307692307694
5737287,5,B00CS7GYF8,"Loved it! Handsome Michael Grey Eyes, the lead Native American character, performed  with sensitivity and restraint. Would like to see him in more roles.",1374883200,,153,5.375
5737288,5,B00CS7GYF8,"I cannot praise this movie enough.  I taped it when it was on TV in the late 90s and I watched a lot, fast-fowarding through the commercials.  Now that I have it on DVD, I watch it at least once a week.  If you're hopelessly romantic, you will love it.  Michael Greyeyes is an absolutely wonderful actor.",1374710400,2,304,4.280701754385965
5737289,5,B00CS7GYF8,"Very different to the average westerns but enjoyable to watch, The storyline is fabulous and the cast fantastic playing their parts. From beginning to end was keeping the interest alive in the movie you didn't know what was coming next. There are the hero's and the baddies now I wonder who they are. The Indians attack a wagon train and capture two woman than decides to let them go. Because of a vision he finds the woman out on a farm with a younger girl friend and takes both, There is action not that you see it, so this is more slower pace than the others I have seen but still holds your viewing and  found I wasn't disappointed after buying it. I rated this an A grade plus. So go collect your popcorn pull up the chair in front of the television and watch with delight a romantic kind of show that will keep you intrigued all the way through and something very different to most. Enjoy!",1374451200,51,895,4.3273809523809526

5737299,5,B00CS7GYF8,This is one of my favorite Michael Greyeyes movie.  Even though the movie is loosely based on a true story the story line didn't follow true to what really happened with Anna and Tokalah but it was a truly wonderful love story.  After I read how the real story was with these two I am so glad the producer/writers decided to make it a happy ending and the the true ending of Anna's life.  If you love this type of movie I highly recommend it.  I have watched it several times and never get bored with it.  Michael is a wonderful actor.,1517184000,2,535,4.205882352941177
5737300,5,B00CS7GYF8,"After reading some of the negative reviews about this DVD, I was almost afraid to watch it because I was hoping that it would play alright,  and I  could watch the whole movie, not just clips, and in English that I could understand, especially since it had those dreaded words on it, Disc Made in Mexico! Well, I  must have a very good player, it is a Blu-ray player and I  had no problem playing the DVD, the picture quality was decent, and it played full-screen on my brand new super wide-screen TV! I love the story, I wish that the story had ended as it ended in the movie,  not the real story! I love Indian stories, especially those in which the white girl falls for the Native! I could watch this movie over and over, just to watch Michael Greyeyes; he is so gorgeous and boy, can he act AND KISS! If I  were in Anna's shoes, I would definitely say, ""Take  me, Tokalah!"" A wonderful piece of escapism and romanticism this is for this type of movie, and the only flaw that I  could see was the pause where the commercials must have been cut, but that was done pretty well, and was pretty minor!",1517011200,4,1100,4.2548076923076925

5737302,1,B00CS7GYF8,I love this movie!  However my player has a hard time reading the media about 2/3 of the way through and I can't watch the rest of the movie.  Very disappointed in the quality.,1513296000,,176,4.147058823529412

Unfortunately this is not what ended up happening to her she was forced to go back and wished she had never been found the child they had together died and she ended up dying in a mental ward of some sort because she fell apart after going back. Very sad, so Im glad they gave her a happy ending in the movie.",1507075200,,548,4.169811320754717

5737318,3,B00CS7GYF8,Good made-for-TV movie.  I especially liked the depiction of the pompous Custer and the white Indian haters.  Also did a fair job of showing how women were treated as property by whites.,1491523200,,186,4.78125

5737321,5,B00CS7GYF8,"This is the best romantic movie I've ever seen!  While the storyline has been used in many films (White women captured by Indians), it is the two leading characters, Anna and Tokalah, who captured my heart. Michael Greyeyes as the handsome warrior, Tokalah, is a skilled actor in that he could say more by his facial expressions and eyes, than most people could say in words. Janine Turner as Anna, and the woman loved by Tokalah, went from fearing him to loving him as time went along. Willliam Schockley as General Custer, Dennis Weaver as the gruff, cynical Capt. Farnsworth, and Ted Shackleford as Stewart Brewster, gave memorable performances as well. Rodney A. Grant, a well-known Native actor, portrayed Tokalah's close friend and supporter. Jean Louisa Kelly portrayed Sarah White, who became Anna's friend since they were captured together. For all romantic movie buffs, this is the movie for you!!",1489881600,,907,5.046666666666667
5737322,5,B00CS7GYF8,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I recorded it on a VHS in the 90s, which we know is not great quality and VHS players are not a big thing anymore. So, the fact that Amazon is selling it on DVD is awesome. I would like it even better if they had it streaming on Amazon Video. Anyway, the love story is so amazing in this video. Realistic, no. Great acting, no. Good looking people, yes. Amazing plot, yes. The love story puts me in such a great mood even if the story line is not accurate. I like that the writers changed it up and romanticized it.",1489276800,,562,4.026785714285714

5737329,4,B00CS7GYF8,I honestly don't know why I liked this film so much.  I think it must all boil down to the chemistry of the Tokalah/Anna characters (despite Ms. Turner's makeup job--eyeliner?!).  Just a note on history: the true story was a tragedy; perhaps the writers should have changed the names for this movie version.,1480636800,,307,4.773584905660377

5737341,5,B00CS7GYF8,"I first saw this movie years ago on TV. It still is good and very realistic in its portrayal of a Sioux warrior and a white woman that destiny brings together. Each has their own axe to grind about the others people. The reality of the acting of Gen. Custer showed well the two faced lies that the indians had to deal with constantly.
It is an all around slap in the face 'reality check' when seeing both sides of the Indian and white problems of the times.",1468368000,,457,4.204545454545454

5737349,1,B00CS7GYF8,"I bought this movie for my mum for x-mas. She had been talking about it for years, since it had aired on tv, in the late 90's, I believe! So I was very pleased to have even found it & because it is not a popular title, ok with the $25 price tag.
  Point is; the DVD is missing a hefty part of the movie. The DVD itself, looked like a ""homemade"" job, which would have been fine by me if, the whole movie was on the disc. & my mum being busy, did not watch the movie and find that it was missing a part, until after the refund/replace time had expired.

I thought the whole cast was great and the actor that played the role of General George Armstrong Custer was SUPERB!  (William Shokley)  The chemistry between Tokalah (Michael Greyeyes) and Anna Brewster (Janine Turner) was palpable.  Michael Greyeyes is such a charismatic actor.

5737415,4,B00CS7GYF8,"The title pretty much says it all though I would have given it another title myself, and one that is not so 'romantic' i.e. 'Cut Grass', because that is pretty much what Tokala had done (cut someone else's grass).  And I can't help wondering if Tokala's 'vision' is really another kind of 'dream' (if you know what I mean)?  It doesn't matter that she (Anna) happens to be married.

The real story had a harsher reality, with the 'real' Anna going back to the 'white man's world', pregnant with Tokala's child, the child dying 2 years' later, and her bearing other children to her lawful husband, Daniel.

However, there is no shortage of good looking actors/actresses, including Michael Grey Eyes - the Canadian (Cree) who plays Tokala, and Rodney Grant (Dances with Wolves fame) - a guilty pleasure for anyone with a Native American 'fetish' (isn't that known as 'prairie fever')?

Great actors, great story, makes you want to be there, experience it all, feel what they felt...especially when you look in Tokala's eyes, he speaks with his eyes. I am sure there were many similar, true stories like this one. Perhaps, one of them mine :)
I am not a native American Indian woman, at least not in this life...but in all my past lives! (sure of it, feel it with every breath that I take) I wasn't even born in America, a foreigner, and yet since childhood I felt an invisible connection with these amazing people.

5737453,5,B00CS7GYF8,"I always refer to as a guilty pleasure anything that I know is absolute crap but that engages me so much that I have to look at it.  I have this on VHS taped from t.v. years ago and, I'm ashamed to say, have looked at it several times.  It is right up there with a regency romance novel for being something I'm ashamed to admit I like.  I do not read romance novels but I guess I can't brag about that because I continue to look at this movie.  Janine Turner is only a so so actress in it but I guess she does the best she can with the script and she looks so beautiful that you don't care. When she and Michael Greyeyes lock eyes your heart will roll over in your chest.  I've never seen anything like the electricity between them on screen before. This story may indeed be based on a true one and I'm sure in that period of time it happened more than once.  Kidnapped woman falls for her captor - don't they call it brain washing or Stockholm syndrome or something modern like that. Michael Greyeyes is gorgeous and there is wonderful palpable chemistry between them. I don't know why he wasn't cast in more movies as a romantic lead. Shades of Valentino - what this guy can do with a look.  Some of the acting by the other characters is good, some adequate.  The ending is not plausible not because of what she does but because nobody will believe she could have found them again.  But, hey, it's a great romantic story and I think everyone should indulge their lower tastes once in a while. And, I'll confess.  I bought the DVD.If you have a romantic bone in your body, don't miss this movie.",1400371200,4,1596,4.237623762376238

5737455,5,B00CS7GYF8,"I saw this movie when it was first aired by Hallmark back in 1997 ( I believe).  I LOVED it.  Michael Greyeyes is my favorite Native American Actor.  So handsome - it made my heat go pitter-pat!  Janine Turner was awesome as the ""Captured Woman"" in this. Her eyes especially revealed her emotions and you could see in them when she began to fall in love with her Indian captor.  It is a movie based on a TRUE STORY.  I read the real account of what happened at my local library.  I have Indian blood in my ancestry and am wanting to do some research to find out about the Indian girl my grandfather's grandfather married back in 1856. Her father was a full blooded Cherokee Indian Chief and his daughter ran off with a white man she met and fell in love with (that is the oral history of it anyway).

First off, this was a TV movie that after support from the fans was finally put on DVD, so don't expect a Hollywood blockbuster. I, being a fan of both history and romance, love every single second of the movie from beginning to end. If one is not so inclined toward sweeping romance and historical fiction than you probably won't find this film nearly as engaging as others. The chemistry between Michael Greyeyes and Jeanine Turner is electric. The hard part to believe is that Ms. Turner's Anna would have resisted Mr. Greyeyes' Tokalah for so long!

As I look back, it would have been nice had they added more details to their life together in the village and draw the movie experience longer. Michael Greyeyes  is most every woman's dream of a 'captor'. In reading his Bio. you can see why he was in such great shape in this movie. My husband has been in shape like that, so I feel I can get away with the comparison and watch this movie over and over! I loved the chemistry between Tokalah and Anna ( who surprised me, liked her character much better than as ' Maggie' in Northern Exposure). I can only hope that more similar movies will be made in the future! Heck, they could re-make this movie and add the things more people would have liked to see included and I'm pretty sure we'd be buying all over again!

How many Indians truly ran around with a potbelly?  The acting was good, and the story was wonderful.  This is based on a true story.  I looked up Anna's true story and felt sad about her actual life.  I bragged this movie to friends and family.  They did not believe how good it could be until they actually saw the movie.  I hope to see other movies, so well done, to come out in the genre.",1387929600,,552,4.1415094339622645
5737481,5,B00CS7GYF8,"While the plot of this story is very loosely based on a true event, is less than historically correct, the presentation is excellent.

I found the depiction of the Lakota people a little off-putting in one regard, having a woman attacking the captive of a chief without provocation and then mistreating that captive despite being told otherwise. The Native American culture[s] generally took captives and used them to replace persons killed or captured by other tribes. They wanted these people healthy enough to work, so abuse is not part of their traditions. This, of course, according to the many books I've read on the subject. I realize Hollywood has a habit of disregarding real historical facts, but in this tale, they overdid it.

Since this was a made-for-television movie from Turner Television, this disregard is excused. The movie is a good one despite the misrepresentation of some of the facts.

Plus this warrior and his tribe didn't take her. it was another tribe that took her and they traded her. Anna also had blonde hair, not red which I wish they had a blonde hair actor. Anna and Sarah were both in their teens, Anna had a very hard life. She had it hard even when she was returned. I loved this movie. because they made it into a romantic story.

5737514,5,B00CS7GYF8,"I just happened to come across a trailer for this movie while searching another Native American/White Woman love story and I was hooked instantly. I bought it & watched it the day the DVD arrived & as a lover of the whole Indian kidnapping the white woman who falls in love with his gentle and sexy ways over the ""savage"" white man, I sure was not disappointed by either the characters of Anna and Tokalah and the secondary characters, nor the stunning actors that portrayed the two.

An overview of the amazing movie following:

Anna on her way to marry a white man she is yet to meet is ambushed by fierce Sioux Indians, many are killed but Anna is spared by the stunning Tokalah as he has had visions of her that we learn about later. Anna marries but not long after Tokalah finds her and kidnaps her with her friend Sarah. Anna in time falls for the gentle, sweet and gorgeous Tokalah and gives in to her temptations, having told him she would never betray her husband.

With the love comes the heartbreaking decision of making a choice, save Tokalah and his people and return to her husband, brother and life she knew before or remain and risk their death. However, is the U.S Cavalry trustworthy and going to keep their word and can Anna stay away from a life and love that have captured her heart?

I know reality would have been different but I still love the fantasy that comes with this genre of books and movies that I completely get lost in",1380067200,54,1452,4.426966292134831

I love the romance in this movie; it's so well-paced and developed. It had my heart melting and soaring all at once. And, by the way, the Native American lead actor is a hottie. I would've fallen in love with him too! The fact that this was a made-for-TV movie endeared me to it even more. I highly recommend this. I'm excited to show it to my mom tomorrow night.
