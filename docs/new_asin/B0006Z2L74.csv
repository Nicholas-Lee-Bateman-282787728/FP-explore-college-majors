8043820,4,B0006Z2L74,"As a mid-40s Gen Xer, the Reagan/Bush years were formative for me.  And Ronald Reagan and his Vice President turned President George HW Bush are the archetypes for me of what American presidents should be.  That being the case, I feared the documentary would be overly infected with liberal bias, given its source.  But the video is a surprisingly balanced and fair portrayal of the Reagan presidency.  To be sure, it reflects some excessive progressive bias in that it seems to see his positive accomplishments mostly in foreign policy for playing a major role in peacefully bringing to a conclusion and winning the Cold War.  In contrast, it seems skizophrenic in its treatment of his domestic economic policy accomplishments, at once acknowledging the at the time ""unprecedented economic boom"" they launched, but also parroting liberal talking points on the supposed failure of supply side economics.  But while some conservatives might wince at anything that is not a hagiography of Reagan, after watching it I find it hard to believe that any fair-minded person would view it as anything less than on balance a sympathetic portrayal of Reagan as a man and an acknowledgment of his considerable accomplishments and transformative presidency.  I think it fits squarely in an emerging consensus among even many liberal academic historians and political scientists that Reagan was one of our most consequential presidents, and one of the near-great or great ones, the conservative version of FDR, and his temperamental if not his philosophical heir.  Watch this and then read HW Brands biography of Reagan to be reminded of an era when an American icon provided the nation resolute, inspirational, graceful, optimistic, and successful leadership.",1491696000,,1747,5.258992805755396
8043821,4,B0006Z2L74,This would have rated a 5 Star except it wasn't closed captioned. The program is an excellent reality of the Reagans.,1475280000,,117,4.619047619047619
8043822,4,B0006Z2L74,"I was really pleased with the balanced review of his life.  I know that my parents adored him and thought he could do nothing wrong but the DVD was balanced and fair.  He did do many great things but, being human, he was not perfect.",1389484800,,233,4.155555555555556
8043823,5,B0006Z2L74,"Why was Ronald Reagan unable to have close friendships?

Why was he eternally optimistic about America? Why did he believe he was able to save the world from evil?

Answers can be found in experiences in his early life that shaped his character. In my human development course, I show the first 20 minutes, and we identify 12 nonnormative events (unusual experiences).

For example, he saved 77 lives during his summers working as a lifeguard. Think how your perspective on what you could do with your life might be different if you knew you had saved the lives of 77 people. Everything that explains Reagan's adult character can be found in his early experiences, all here in this well-done film.

I regret that the other American Experience programs on U.S. presidents lack such careful analysis of early experience. The TR program is equally good; the Lyndon Johnson one describes only a single revealing early experience, which may have shaped his adult character: As a boy, his mother refused to talk to him for days when he brought home less than perfect grades. She did not treat her other children that way.",1369526400,,1115,4.821989528795812
8043824,5,B0006Z2L74,"This is a very complete history of Ronald Reagan and term of the 40th president. It's long, nearly 4 1/2 hours, but it covers a lot of ground. Love him or hate him, it's hard to resist his infectious optimism. For a historical look at Reagan's presidency I couldn't imagine a better place to start.",1354924800,2,298,4.4363636363636365
8043825,4,B0006Z2L74,"I was in my late teens and early twenties when Ronald Reagan was in power and despite liking him, he scared me, as he seemed out of touch with reality sometimes. I think Ronald Reagan was a genuine nice guy and overall a good President, but in the mid 1980's, I was resigned to the fact, that it was more likely that I was going to die in a Nuclear War, then in my own bed. This is a excellent documentary about Ronald Reagan from the cradle to the grave - warts and all.",1330387200,,471,4.0212765957446805
8043826,1,B0006Z2L74,"I was very sad by the way Pres. Reagan was portrayed in this DVD. If a person who did not live at the time sees it today would think that he  was a stupid, inept and disabled president. The commentaries were biased from a liberal view and tried to distort history. A President that was elected and reelected by huge margins as he was, could not be that bad, could he?(Maybe all the voters were even worse!) That's a shame. Having people like Chris Matthews talk about Reagan's ability to govern was simply idiotic! The image of one of the greatest American Presidents cannot be tarnished by people like these, who had the only agenda of distorting reality. If you want to see vintage footage of his time, it is ok, but beware of the political and personal analysis that are provided. The other sad side of the story is that I bought this at the Reagan Library in California this past January. I think they should be more selective on the products they have for sale! To sum up, I wish we had a President like him in Brazil, but from what I know from this country, it would never be possible. A man of his integrity, caracter, and strengh would never be chosen to lead in so a leftist nation. Americans are lucky to have such a person in their formidable ranks of Presidents. Don't let anyone destroy this great history of yours.",1301443200,21,1328,4.420408163265306
