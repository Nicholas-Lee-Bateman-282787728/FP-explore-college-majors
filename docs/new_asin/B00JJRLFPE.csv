6362482,4,B00JJRLFPE,Quite an interesting look inside the Royal family!,1410480000,2,50,5.375
6362483,4,B00JJRLFPE,"This little movie is a well produced gem of a documentary as one would expect it to be when the subject is the royal family.  You get to see a rare view of the family's collection of personal items that consists of drawings, watercolors, and assorted craft items that go all the way back to Mary, Queen of Scots.  It's as if we have been invited into assorted rooms in a palace to see some handmade items made by a friend's relatives.  In this case, it's the hobby craft of an exclusive lot that reveals their private needs for self-expression, or in some cases, something to do before you get your head chopped off.  But it's Charles, HRH, the Prince of Wales, who is our guide mostly, and we see this much maligned gentleman in his most relaxed and witty manner, chatting off the cuff and making us all feel very welcome.  You see, they are humans too, much like the rest of us, but only slightly different.",1407801600,21,909,4.386904761904762
6362524,5,B00JJRLFPE,Great,1463529600,,5,5.0
6362525,5,B00JJRLFPE,Very well done.  I have a book of Prince Charle's Watercolor works from many years ago.  He is an exceptional artist.  The program covers a wide variety of art from the Royal Family artists throught the years.  I enjoyed it and re-visited it a few times since on PBS.,1463443200,,267,4.387755102040816
6362526,4,B00JJRLFPE,Fasinating look into the royal family and art. Also how important art is a child education.,1455667200,,91,4.75
6362527,4,B00JJRLFPE,Members of royalty have serious artistic abilities.  Who knew?,1454284800,,62,5.888888888888889
6362528,5,B00JJRLFPE,"I enjoyed this so much when I saw it on WCVE, I bought it to watch again. The ability to see and replicate is something I didn't learn until my twenties, as a scientist, and this video confirmed that children gifted with example and time can excel at the arts. Something not mentioned is that of course, the royals had time and resources to practice their art through the years. Other children (in earlier centuries) were working and struggling to eat. It's not good or bad, just what it is. The Prince of Wales, throughout the piece, is conversational, relaxed and interesting - quite open and even caring. A rare glimpse of something intimate in the lives of artists...highly recommended.",1449273600,2,690,4.758333333333334
6362529,5,B00JJRLFPE,It came in good time and condition and was an interesting look at the royal family.  I never thought of them as artistically talented but many of them are.  The history was interesting.,1445212800,,185,4.575757575757576
6362530,5,B00JJRLFPE,"Very, very interesting documentary. So many members of the British royal family's ancestry were quite accomplished artists. The idea presented is that developing drawing/painting skills was expected of them by their family and culture, so they did. I believe anyone who would like to learn these skills but feels they have little or no artistic ability would be very encouraged by watching this.",1439596800,,395,5.285714285714286
6362531,4,B00JJRLFPE,A well done documentary.  Perfect for anyone who is a fan of the British Royal Family as well as anyone who is a watercolor painter.,1438387200,,132,4.28
6362532,3,B00JJRLFPE,oh my... a little slow,1435276800,,22,3.6
6362533,5,B00JJRLFPE,Worth watching. The information on the artistic talents of the Royal famly was most interesting and have recommened others to watch it. A five star rating.,1434499200,,155,5.0
6362574,5,B00JJRLFPE,shows a warm and deeper side to Prince Charles and loved the history of art in this family,1434412800,,90,4.055555555555555
6362575,5,B00JJRLFPE,I enjoyed this and the history of art in the Royal family.  Its a step up from the refrigerator art most of us have! LOL I thought about how the family's saved the work over the years.  If one enjoys art it will be interesting to you.,1434412800,,234,3.9574468085106385
6362576,5,B00JJRLFPE,"Interesting history, some things I hadn't thought of.  It may seem slow, but take it in step and you'll learn a lot about the past art and the meager materials they had to work with.  I enjoyed watching it.",1434412800,,206,4.256410256410256
6362577,4,B00JJRLFPE,"I had no idea the royals were so artistically inclined, nor that so much validated evidence of it exists today.",1434153600,,111,4.6
6362578,4,B00JJRLFPE,Enjoyable,1433721600,,9,9.0
6362579,5,B00JJRLFPE,Really fascinating. Not only are the Royals rich they are pretty talented as well.,1433721600,,82,4.928571428571429
6362580,5,B00JJRLFPE,Very good program.,1433116800,,18,5.333333333333333
6362581,4,B00JJRLFPE,Wonderful insight to the royal family.,1433030400,,38,5.5
6362582,5,B00JJRLFPE,I loved this video.  It was nice to see Prince Charles in a more relaxed setting.  His artwork and his comments were very touching. It somehow showed us the real person that he is.,1433030400,,180,4.264705882352941
6362583,5,B00JJRLFPE,Nicely done,1432944000,,11,5.0
6362584,4,B00JJRLFPE,Enjoyed watching.,1432944000,,17,8.0
6362585,4,B00JJRLFPE,I don't know why but I love learning about the aristocracy in Greater Britain,1432944000,,77,4.571428571428571
6362586,5,B00JJRLFPE,"This movie covers some of the art  from royalty present and past.  There is a special royal art museum, evidently,  where the paintings and sculptures are housed.  Prince Charles does a very good job of showing and explaining the various pieces of art as well as giving a little biography on the artist.  I think anyone would find this movie interesting and be surprised at the degree of talent many of the royals possessed.",1432944000,2,424,4.675675675675675
6362587,5,B00JJRLFPE,Loved seeing this side of royalty specially a prince Charles,1432944000,,60,5.1
6362588,5,B00JJRLFPE,This was such a great show - thoroughly enjoyed watching it.  I am British  now living in the US and enjoy watching shows that feature the royal family.  This was very different in that it covered a part of the royal families history which hasn't been covered that I know of before.  It's known that Charles enjoys painting but to learn who else in the royal family have painted and to see their work was fascinating.,1432857600,2,417,4.447368421052632
6362589,2,B00JJRLFPE,Prince Charles seemed as though he was discovering these family treasures for the first time. He is a total bore.  God save The Kingdom from him!,1431648000,,145,4.576923076923077
6362590,3,B00JJRLFPE,"The subject matter is engrossing but could have been better if we did not have to listen to HRH the Prince of Wales waffle on. The fact that certain artistic talents have been ""handed down"" within a family is understandable. The fact that all that artwork has been saved over the centuries is truly remarkable. An interesting movie even with Charles.",1431302400,,350,4.754098360655738
6362591,5,B00JJRLFPE,I loved this !!  The Royal history and priceless art work from past royals was a treasure seldom seen.  Thank you to HRH Prince of Wales - His art work and shared comments  were inspiring.  The archives  does a great job  preserving  art.,1430956800,,238,4.395348837209302
6362592,5,B00JJRLFPE,"Fascinating program.  I didn't know that the Royal Family were such talented artists.  Queen Victoria and particularly her daughter, Princess Louise were extremely talented.",1430956800,,173,6.166666666666667
6362593,4,B00JJRLFPE,interesting peek into the royals as artists,1430956800,,43,5.285714285714286
6362604,5,B00JJRLFPE,"If you love art and history, then this video is for you..not only do you see another side of Prince Charles, you always learn facts and talents through the generations of the Royals.",1429488000,,182,4.545454545454546
6362605,5,B00JJRLFPE,Great for adults even though it's in the kids section.  Enjoyed it!,1429056000,,67,4.583333333333333
6362606,4,B00JJRLFPE,"Royal Paintbox provides an interesting view of Prince Charles's art, as well as some of the paintings in the British Royal Family's collection.  Prince Charles is an accomplished water colorist, and many of his works really capture the light and atmosphere of places he's visited around the world.  However, as with all interviews with royals, there's a certain distance involved here, so the viewer is left without much emotional understanding of the paintings.",1428796800,,462,5.315068493150685
6362607,5,B00JJRLFPE,Very interesting show,1428710400,,21,6.333333333333333
6362608,4,B00JJRLFPE,Excellently produced.,1428278400,,21,10.0
6362609,5,B00JJRLFPE,fascinating and informative. Prince Charles is funny and interesting and the artistic achievements are impressive,1428105600,,113,6.6
6362610,5,B00JJRLFPE,A very interesting and surprisingly charming show.  Recommended to those with an interest in the British royal family and art.,1428019200,,126,5.3
6362611,5,B00JJRLFPE,Loved it.,1427414400,,9,4.0
6362612,4,B00JJRLFPE,"Interesting, never knew their were so many talented Royals !",1427414400,,60,5.1
6362613,3,B00JJRLFPE,Interesting the number of artistic Royals.  A little more about each artist would have been better.,1427328000,,99,5.1875
6362624,5,B00JJRLFPE,A very enjoyable look at Prince Charles and the history of Art in his family.,1427328000,,77,4.2
6362625,4,B00JJRLFPE,"This provides a very interesting look into the art created by many generations of the royal family, on both sides, and I thought of how very fortunate they are to have sketches and watercolors of places known and loved 200 years ago, by their family members, who spent time at many of the places we read about today. It also provides a glimpse of Charles that's rarely seen--he seems relaxed, obviously knows and loves these works, and seemed to genuinely enjoy speaking of them. He's a ""bit dry"", but much more avuncular than his more public persona.",1427241600,5,551,4.690721649484536
6362626,4,B00JJRLFPE,Very interesting.,1426636800,,17,8.0
6362627,5,B00JJRLFPE,I thought this was a very enjoyable realxing program. Afterwards I bought it for my mother who likes to paint.,1426204800,,110,4.55
6362628,2,B00JJRLFPE,"Interesting, but somewhat dry.",1426032000,,30,6.75
6362629,5,B00JJRLFPE,This was a great movie and to have the prince of wales narrate made it all the better.,1423699200,,86,3.8333333333333335
6362630,5,B00JJRLFPE,Great video!  I felt as if HRH were talking directly to me.,1418428800,4,59,3.9166666666666665
6362631,5,B00JJRLFPE,Excellent and informative saw on tv and had to have dvd,1417564800,,55,4.090909090909091
6362632,5,B00JJRLFPE,"This program was interesting and informative. Following the artistic heritage within the Royal Family was surprising, though it shouldn't have been. Learning that Mad King George had, in fact, been an amazing architectural artist before his illness overwhelmed him, intrigued me. Knowing that his children were isolated by his illness caused a ripple effect of his daughters becoming competent artists in their own right. True they had tutors, but skill is skill.
The current Prince of Wales is very talented in his own painting. I found it fun to see his own process.",1415145600,10,568,5.118279569892473
6362633,5,B00JJRLFPE,"I was very happyv with the dvd. It opened my eyes as to the Royals ,how talented they were ,",1413763200,2,92,3.65
8651425,5,B00JJRLFPE,great,1530921600,,5,5.0
8651426,5,B00JJRLFPE,"I found this documentary very interesting. I knew of course that the Prince of Wales painted, but I didn't realize to what extent, or that he was such a supporter of the arts in general. He's quite talented. The history of the royal family and their individual works was also fascinating, bringing forward a lot of previously unknown (to me) info. Really enjoyable.",1523750400,,365,4.809523809523809
8651427,5,B00JJRLFPE,"This is a spectacular documentary.  It's fascinating to wonder, did the Kings and Queens of the past, present, and future become artists because they were genuinely talented, or is this the only way they ever get to express themselves genuinely?",1520640000,,245,5.125
8651428,5,B00JJRLFPE,"I was so elated to discover the artistic caring of Prince Charles, Queen Victoria, King George and other members of the British royal family.  The prince emphasized how important it was to ""see"" and appreciate the beauty of nature.  It showed him sketching the countryside at Balmoral and expressing the awe of nature.  There was such an expression of humility the likes of which I never would have otherwise imagined.  Very genuine and heart warming indeed.",1516320000,,458,4.9868421052631575
8651429,5,B00JJRLFPE,unbelievable the amount of talent.,1515456000,,34,6.0
8651430,1,B00JJRLFPE,"I thought this was really bad. It's mostly about Prince Charles' water colors and his voice put me to sleep (literally). I thought it would show some of the many art works done by very talented royals from the past, but instead you get one glimpse and the Charles compares his many paintings to that one painting. His ego is gigantic. SO if you need help falling asleep, rent this stinker.",1509321600,,389,4.492957746478873
8651431,3,B00JJRLFPE,I thoroughly enjoyed this program.  I thought it well done.  Not the usual information one gets from a program about the Royal Family both past and present.,1496016000,,156,4.7407407407407405
8651432,4,B00JJRLFPE,very interesting has is the case w/all PBS product,1490227200,,50,4.666666666666667
8651433,5,B00JJRLFPE,Anyone who loves art and Art History would really appreciate this show.  Who knew so many in the Royal line were as skilled and expressive. It's a wonderful insight also into what it is like to be an artist amidst so many other roles and responsibilities facing all creative people.  This production is an important contribution to the body of historical materials.,1469232000,,365,4.870967741935484
8651434,3,B00JJRLFPE,"Charles and his family (like Queen Victoria and Prince Albert) were quite accomplished visual artists. Charles' watercolors are quite good. For a man without formal training. What the Royals lack in cleverness, I suppose they make up in modest artistic talent.",1468627200,,260,5.365853658536586
