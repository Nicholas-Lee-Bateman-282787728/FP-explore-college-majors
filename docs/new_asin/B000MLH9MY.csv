8169802,3,B000MLH9MY,"""the cowboy and the ballerina"" is definitely an obscure film. Not sure exactly why? The cast is amazing, the production value is great, and story is wonderful. Lee Majors (Bionic Man ) plays a rodeo star that develops a relationship with a beautiful Russian Ballerina. Majors plays a cowboy who wants to regain his title as World Champion bronco rider. Natalia ( Leslie Wing ) is a Russian ballerina classified by her government as a national treasure She defects not for political reasons but rather with hopes of visiting her mother a Soviet exile now remarried and living in New York. When she runs away from the ballet company she seeks refuge in a truck, the cowboy's truck! A compelling love story between two very unlikely people. Watch for a small early appearance by ANJELICA HOUSTON. The video release is Color and 96mins.",1209945600,3,832,4.825174825174825
