4156578,4,B003N9ASF2,"This movie contains almost a child like view of the world. The Americans are somewhat all knowing and wise while the British are naive. It is almost as if the British have done a total reverse of their post ww2 view that the British felt that they were the smart ones in the relationship. It cast doubts as to whether there is a special relationship between Britain and the US, and it also contains the view that Tony Blair was not a progressive which the films sees as a criticism of him.

The filming itself was good. There were times, I was stunned how seamlessly, the movie was able to merge the movie into historical films. I also thought that Dennis Quaid played very well.",1293235200,10,679,4.432
4156579,4,B003N9ASF2,"How you feel about this HBO Original Film - which garnered FIVE Emmy Nominations will definitely depend on your political beliefs and how you felt about President Bill Clinton and his ""personal"" problems while in office. There's no denying that. The film doesn't really take sides but there is a bit of a slant to it.

Actually the film - a co production with the BBC - is just as much about British Prime Minister Tony Blair and is the third in a trilogy about him, all starring Michael Sheen as Blair. He looks a lot like him too. Clinton is played by Dennis Quaid and looks very little like him. And his drawl is almost a caricature. It takes a long while to not be distracted by this Saturday Night Live- type imitation. And this was the most disappointing part of the film for me. Hope Davis as Hilary Clinton, however is spot-on! She looks like her and captures her body language and speech patterns even better than Tina Fey channels Sarah Palin. If the ever make The Hilary Clinton Story, Davis needs to fill the title role!

The period covered in the film is just 5 years and its recent history to us. Maybe over time the Clinton impression will seem less off-putting. And the use by Director Richard Loncraine of real footage near the end of the film makes the role seem even more miscast.

There is only ONE bonus feature: A less-than five minute ""making of"" featurette that adds nothing of value to the film.

One of three recent Emmy Nominated HBO films to see light on DVD this fall (the others were the five star films  You Don't Know Jack and Temple Grandin), this one is unfortunately not up to the usual HBO standards, in my opinion.

4156580,4,B003N9ASF2,"The movie centers primarily on Tony Blair and how the political genius of Bill Clinton helped him along until student became master. Hope Davis owns Hillary Clinton. She did a better job portraying her than perhaps Tina Fey does Palin. Quaid had down Clinton's speech but he simply didn't look like him. The movie starts with an obscure Blair studying the US 1992 campaign to see how the Democrats turned things around. (It is easier for a political party to change its views than it is to change the views of the people.) Cherie Blair is envious of Hillary because Bill shares his power with her as she is his closest adviser. The movie then moves to Ireland then goes through the Monica scandal and climaxes with Blair becoming the master politician over Bosnia-Kosovo genocide. Ominous music is played when Bush is elected (hint at liberal bias). I found the movie to be extremely interesting and more entertaining than I expected. What the movie doesn't show is how Blair got dismantled over his special relationship with Bush and the Iraqi war, although Clinton's final words were that of a warning to Blair NOT to get close to Bush and questions if Blair is a true progressive. There is some sex talk over the Monica affair and Hillary does drop the f-bomb once.",1292716800,6,1268,4.716216216216216
4156581,5,B003N9ASF2,"Let me begin by saying that I enjoyed this BBC-HBO production immensely, largely because of Martin Sheen's nuanced portrayal of Tony Blair. I have to acknowledge, however, that viewer reactions might be based upon how one feels about both Blair and Clinton.  Some might find the film either too pro- or too con, because of the writers' and director's determination to keep the scenario firmly anchored in the middle of the political road, allowing the viewer to make up his mind on whether Blair began his political career as a novice, learned the political tricks of the trade (no pun intended) from a master conjurer, and then surpassed his mentor in dealing squarely with political reality.

The director is particularly neutral in his attitude toward the present Secretary of State, well acted by Hope Davis, while he allows (constantly munching) Dennis Quaid as her  philandering husband to suggest a cringing leer, when she questions him about the truth of the scandal; and Helen McCrory's Cherie, suggests, not-quite subtly, a crypto-Lady MacBeth in waiting. Not really over-the-top performances, but almost!

Michael Sheen's often-underplayed portrayal of Blair, however, keeps the film on track. He shows us a combination of vulnerable charm that soon emerges as infectious charisma, that the original does possess, whether one approves of him politically or not. Watching Sheen's portrayal, I found myself, at first, constantly readjusting my perspective, telling myself: ""no, Sheen doesn't look like Blair."" Soon, however, I forgot about my initial scepticism, accepting him without reserve as Tony Blair.

I therefore wish that the cinematographer had photo-shopped Sheen in the final newsreel scenes, because the sight of the real Blair brought me back to reality, but perhaps a sudden dose of reality is exactly what the director had in mind.",1291593600,2,1856,5.299319727891157
4156582,5,B003N9ASF2,"Michael Sheen is to Tony Blair what Raymond Massey was to Abraham Lincoln.

Massey may have had an acting advantage, since there were no movies or sound recordings of the 16th President that could be used for comparison, but Sheen has certainly employed the modern technology to his benefit.  Indeed, there are many moments in his portrayal of the former British Prime Minister when you forget that you are not watching the real man.

THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP, from HBO Home Entertainment, marks the third time that Sheen has played Blair on screen.  Since the plot centers on him, rather than, for example, Queen Elizabeth, his portrayal in this film is much more comprehensive than his earlier efforts.

Set against world events, Peter Morgan's script is, in essence, a story about a ""student"" learning from and then surpassing his ""teacher"".

The ""teacher"" in this case is President Bill Clinton (Dennis Quaid in a remarkable performance).

Clinton was nearing the end of his first term as President when Blair became Prime Minister.  There was an immediate rapport between the two men and, both being liberals, they pledged to make their ""special relationship"" work and together bring the free world to their political way of thinking.  Blair stood by Clinton when the President's embarrassing sexual affairs nearly brought down his Presidency, but the two friends butted heads over the war in Bosnia.

Directed by Richard Loncraine, this fine film examines the nature of friendship in the world of politics.  Hope Davis presents a credible performance as Hillary Clinton and Helen McCrory, as Blair's wife, steals every scene in which she appears.

The DVD includes a ""Making of"" featurette.

4156583,4,B003N9ASF2,"Unlike others boasting of Clintons greatness or blasting him and Blair for their horrible atrocities ...I'll review the movie. I received a ""screener"" and its an hour and a half ..not the 5 or 600 minutes that Amazon.com lists.

Its a good movie...Quaid is very good and Sheen as its already been noted has played Blair twice before and is fabulous. Hope Davis is also terrific as Hillary. If you enjoyed Frost/Nixon, The Queen, or The Deal...you should enjoy this drama.

I can't give it a 5 star review although I was tempted because its a bit lighter weight than say Frost/Nixon which is a solid 5 in my humble opinion.

If you have an axe to grind in either direction on this you may wish to avoid...if you can check your party politics at the door and just enjoy this deliciously well acted big time political ""soap opera"" then I heartily recommend. Personally ....Quaid laying on the bed with a small television  in his lap and continually pounding down Doritos was almost worth it for me...good fun,  interestingly written a great diversion for an hour plus...and better in my opinion than most of the 3D and CGI filled theatrical releases of the day.",1285200000,44,1158,4.6568627450980395
4156584,5,B003N9ASF2,"While he was, undoubtably, the best President the US has had in at least the past fifty years, Bill Clinton's personal misdoings were overamplified by the press and the conservative right-wing hate mongers. This film is an effective overview of the relationship President Clinton had with Tony Blair, who made his own mistakes, but allowed himself to listen to and work well with our Commander in Chief. I'm looking forward to what should be some interesting bonus features on the DVD.

Thanks, HBO!",1284681600,,499,5.0120481927710845
4156585,4,B003N9ASF2,"Tony Blair must be quite the double-edged sword for Michael Sheen. He's played him twice before (in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Deal/dp/B0010X73Z6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Deal</a>&nbsp;and, of course,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Queen-Blu-ray/dp/B000NTPDK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Queen [Blu-ray</a>]), and now returns to the role that's made him famous playing opposite Dennis Quaid as Bill Clinton. That he's played the role in three different films speaks volumes to how good he is in it, though I'm sure he's looking forward to not doing it anymore.

This particular movie tells the story of the relationship between Blair and Clinton, with a particular focus on the events surrounding NATO's intervention in Kosovo and the Lewinski scandal. As such it's got a very different style than ""The Queen"", and isn't quite as good, but is very entertaining.

I particularly liked Sheen's performance, again. Helen McRory does an excellent job as Ms Blair. Dennis Quaid... Dennis Quaid acts quite like Clinton, but looks nothing like him. In fact in several scenes he looks quite a bit like Al Gore, which is a little startling at times.

But beyond that rather odd bit of casting the movie works and works well. You get a real insight into the way the ""special relationship"" between the US and the UK works (and you certainly come away knowing who the junior partner is). At no point was I bored and if it's note quite as excellent as ""The Queen"" that's mostly due to a somewhat drier plot. Recommended if you can get it on HBO and if you cannot, buy the DVD when it is out!",1275696000,5,1687,5.556420233463035
4156586,4,B003N9ASF2,Dennis Quaid does a remarkable portrayal of President Wm Clinton. This docu-movie details the relationship between Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair (Martin Sheen). Clinton reached across the ocean to help Blair win in 1997. Blair returned the favor by supporting Clinton when the Monica Lewinsky affair surfaced but then learned that Clinton had not been honest with him which led to strain in the relationship. There is something for all whether a Clinton advocate or a Clinton detractor. Hillary is featured throughout and is characterized as calculating.,1479859200,,562,5.3977272727272725

I always enjoy Dennis Quaid, and will often choose a movie just because he is in it.  I was very impressed with his portrayal of President Bill Clinton...the voice, the look, he had it all.

4156669,4,B003N9ASF2,"I was prepared to be bored by this film but I was pleasantly surprised. This is a tight if not thin script on the relationship between Blair and Clinton ending with Blair's choice to stand by Bush. It portrays Clinton in quite a good light as a flawed yet steadfast man who despite infidelity had a strong marriage. Blair is portrayed as a lot cleaner than Clinton but in the end he's shown to be the slithering reptile all Brits understand him to be. Its not a grand film but I did like it, especially the ending which really sums up the films point of view which is that Blair stood for anything that would bring him personal glory. In short he has no fixed political agenda save which way the wind is blowing. I give it four cocks up, two for the men portrayed and two for their wives.",1402099200,,788,4.26

Blair has always been regarded as a  dweeb, only after his own grandisement, and I get the impression that Clinton was more given than Blair in this relationship, and considering he didn't have to be, it makes me like Clinton more than I did",1401235200,,304,4.611111111111111

4156677,4,B003N9ASF2,"The movie centers primarily on Tony Blair and how the political genius of Bill Clinton helped him along until student became master. Hope Davis owns Hillary Clinton. She did a better job portraying her than perhaps Tina Fey does Palin. Quaid had down Clinton's speech but he simply didn't look like him. The movie starts with an obscure Blair studying the US 1992 campaign to see how the Democrats turned things around. (It is easier for a political party to change its views than it is to change the views of the people.)

Cherie Blair is envious of Hillary because Bill shares his power with her as she is his closest adviser. The movie then moves to Ireland then goes through the Monica scandal and climaxes with Blair becoming the master politician over Bosnia-Kosovo genocide. Ominous music is played when Bush is elected (hint at liberal bias). I found the movie to be extremely interesting and more entertaining than I expected. What the movie doesn't show is how Blair got dismantled over his special relationship with Bush and the Iraqi war, although Clinton's final words were that of a warning to Blair NOT to get close to Bush and questions if Blair is a true progressive.

There is some sex talk over the Monica affair and Hillary does drop the f-bomb once.",1341532800,,1270,4.716216216216216

4156680,4,B003N9ASF2,"For the 4th time... I believe , Michael Sheen inhabits the personage of Tony Blair in this version of the ""special"" relationship between the UK and USA and more specifically between said Blair and Bill Clinton. This was an HBO film and finally arrived on DVD in the US but this UK Blu Ray is worth sorting out if you enjoyed the film. For starters it does have some limited yet still bonus footage and behind the scenes material. However the most material difference is that this is cropped to 2:35 aspect ratio rather than the 1:78 that is presented in the DVD.... so you get the more cinematic scope and YES..this is a UK blu ray but it plays on my non modified player so it must be ALL REGION and NOT PAL.

4156683,4,B003N9ASF2,"The film analyzes the relationship between the United States and Great Britain under President Bill Clinton (1993-2001) and British Prime Minister Tony Blair during the second term of the Clinton administration. The film has a great cast. Dennis Quaid really becomes Bill Clinton and not a caricature on Saturday Night Live. Hope Davis does a very good job in capturing Hillary Rodham Clinton's character. It's really Michael Sheen's performance as Prime Minister Tony Blair and Helen McCrory's performance as his wife. They played the same roles in the film, ""The Queen."" Anyway, this film might be useful in the schools regarding international politics but the Lewinsky scandal and vulgar descriptions make it hard to pass the censor.

Regardless, I didn't find the story that intriguing except that Blair comes across as idealing Clinton as some hero. It's really Blair's story about Milosevic and the horrors in the former Yugoslavian nation. Blair comes alive when he's fighting for injustice.

I just wished that they added more features regarding the history and the background of two important players in international politics.",1304467200,,1136,5.340782122905028
4156684,4,B003N9ASF2,"We know the faces of the protagonists so well that no portrayal can be entirely convincing. The faces here are good, but no one who'd followed the period in question would mistake them for a moment. Neither of the actors are actually as transfixing as Blair and Clinton.

That's distracting at first, but the movie is so well made that after a few minutes, the viewer forgets it, and only the occasional newsreel clip distracts.

More persistent is the feeling that the most crucial and the most compelling of these events are so private that no-one could possibly know if anything like them actually occurred. Only two (or occasionally three or four) people would know, and they ain't sayin'.",1299369600,,693,4.815126050420168

Martin Sheen was excellent as Tony Blair  whose character was the Main thrust and interest in the movie though Quaid Did an excellent portrayal of President Clinton, their was no meaningful, believable exploration of  his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and it's fallout this as i say this a exploration of Tony Blairs period in office at this time.",1501372800,,646,4.908256880733945
