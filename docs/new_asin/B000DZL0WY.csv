8230254,1,B000DZL0WY,"After watching for only 20 minutes, I had to shut it off as it made me feel really sick in the stomach.  The camera was moving so much that it was hard to watch.  I was rather disappointed with this purchase.  I can only say that it did offer a glimpse of the real hike, which I hope will be truly an amazing experience.",1207526400,3,320,3.96875
8230255,3,B000DZL0WY,"This is definitely an amateur video (from the dates on the footage, it appears to have been filmed in May of 2000). Most of the footage was taken while individuals were hiking and thus the shots are quite shaky. The film quality is that of your average camcorder (back in 2000).

If you're looking for an overview of Machu Picchu or a history of the Incas this is not the video for you. Instead, you should purchase The History Channel's ""Lost City of the Incas"" video (also available on amazon). If you want to see a quick glimpse of what the experience would be like if you made the hike, then this video is for you.",1167609600,11,618,4.327586206896552
