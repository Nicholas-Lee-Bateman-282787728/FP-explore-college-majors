8494406,5,B0067R3PPM,"Lo-fi for sure, but the bit about ATF is worth the view. This show used to be on Cable Access in Seattle back in the early 2000s.",1478822400,,129,3.814814814814815
8494407,1,B0067R3PPM,Boooooring! Poor quality video and dull commentary.,1478563200,,51,6.428571428571429
8494408,1,B0067R3PPM,This is a very low quality show.  This looks like a high school project.  The camera work is bumpy and the audio quality is poor too.  The interviewer is not polished or professional... sorry... I should ask for a return of my payment.  This should have some sort of trailer for others to judge for themselves.,1474588800,,310,4.482142857142857
