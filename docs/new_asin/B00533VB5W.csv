8454953,1,B00533VB5W,"After watching this fishing video I had to ask, ""Where's the beef?""  I can hardly believe that 30 years experienced fishermen would have so little information to impart.  Everything was covered in such a trivial manner.  For instance, they mention don't hold the fish vertically, but never say how you should hold the fish horizontally without damaging it.  Their main advice on locating Muskie is to look for drop-offs...duh.  Mostly the video consists of watching these guys reel in Muskie on various types of bait.  In fairness they did have a few good bait tips, but it was a long time in coming.  There was one unintentionally funny scene where they netted a Muskie which proceeded to beat itself senseless on the side of the boat as they chatted. Then when they get around to releasing the poor stunned and damaged fish it floats unmoving on the surface and one guy says ""Don't worry, it will swim off in a few minutes.""  Save your money and don't get this video, any internet article on Muskie has more useful information.",1330646400,,1029,4.709497206703911
