3659729,5,B001JT6Y8S,"This DVD includes three 20-minute Yin-like Yoga segments + one bonus 10-minute section. You can do each one separately or together for a full 70-minutes of Yin-like Yoga. It is not traditional ""Paul Grilley"" Yin Yoga (where you hold postures for 3-5 minutes with passive stretches and specific postures that are connected to meridian system), instead Mimi holds the postures for about 1 minute and somewhat passive like traditional Yin Yoga. All of the routines are entirely on the floor (no standing postures). The music is lovely, but a bit loud (especially on the first segment) and it is a bit difficult to hear her describe the postures.

Here's the line-up:

Session 1: Back Stretches
Session 2: Legs and Hips
Session 3: Neck and Shoulders
Bonus: Challenging Poses

This is an excellent routine and I especially like using it in the early morning and a wake-up routine. It can be used by all levels from beginners to intermediate Yogis.

Also check out Mimi's other DVD called ""Back in Shape"" which is an excellent theraputic practice. Also, please check my other Yoga DVD reviews on Amazon.",1237075200,86,1097,4.9135135135135135

Until I discovered Mimi's BACK IN SHAPE program, back pain curtailed my dancing.  I've been following Mimi's healing routine for years, and while I've never tired it, I am thrilled now to add DEP STRETCH to my repertoire. ""Feel pleased with your efforts and confident,"" says Mimi as she guides gently, clearly throughout the DVD. I am now playing DEEP STRETCH in the background as I write this comment.  The music fills me with calm as does Mimi's encouraging voice.  ""Flexibility gained through intelligence is more permanent than that gained through force,"" she says.  And thus I am filled  not with a regret for what I cannot do, but with anticipation of possibilities...the promise of dancing with grandchildren for years to come.

This DVD is permanently in the DVD player so that we can do it first thing in the morning and also at intervals during the day.  I work a lot at the computer and the lower back gets stiff.  The DVD is organized in short segments - so you can concentrate on just Neck and Shoulders, or Back, Hips and Legs, etc.  I try to do the Full Stretch program at least once a week.

 I also went with her and a group of other women on a yoga trip to Malaysia and Thailand.  Mimi's yoga practice helped me rehab from  my hip replacement, and now helps me control my back problems. Her deep stretch class is one that I often enter feeling tight, and always exit feeling like a new person.

I was looking for something deeply relaxing and this is just that.  Great music by Anugama, sooo relaxing.

She holds the stretches a long time -- time to breathe, become aware, let go, transform.  I love that.

Deeply nurturing.

Starts off on the back, and stays on the mat.  No standing poses.  So, no huffing and puffing.

The stretches are fairly demanding; you'll feel the great benefits in things loosening up nicely.

All in all in a certain way, it's a very interesting yoga routine in that it's non demanding in the huffing and puffing department, but still an excellent workout -- though hugely relaxing.",1429574400,,676,4.75

3659749,2,B001JT6Y8S,"When i first got this video, I did not know much about yin yoga, but loved the concept. It is hard to find yin yoga dvds.  I got this one but found her voice irritating and her cues distracting, rather than helpful.  Also the postures were not held long enough.  She did not discuss modifications for the positions, nor gave tips about detecting the difference between healthy sensations and sensations that indicate possible nerve damage, etc.  I wish she would redo this in true yin yoga way, as the postures themselves are great. But her method of teaching them is off. If this was true yin yoga, there would be suggestions for props, modifications and one would be cautioned against going for maximum stretch. also cautioned about the different sort of sensations one can feel and what to do if one detects unhealthy sensation.  Tingling is sign of pinched nerve, and one ought to adjust position to ease this. After learning more about yin yoga and experiencing yin yoga sessions by genuine experts,  I do not recommend this dvd for anyone.  It sounds like yin yoga, but it is not the real thing.  There are some good websites to learn how to do yin yoga safely, and at least one online yoga website offers wonderful yin yoga classes.  This dvd is misleading. and potentially dangerous.  It is impossible to relax deeply when body is stretched to limit.",1418428800,6,1358,4.69198312236287

While this video was very relaxing and Ms. Solaire describes the set up and action well, my understanding of yin yoga is not simply holding selected Vinyasa/Ashtanga poses for longer then normal so I think calling it deep stretch is fine but calling it Yin Yoga is not.

I got it specifically for some yin yoga instruction and here is where the content and technique fall short.",1411603200,2,591,4.514018691588785

You can do a short practice by doing one sequence or you can do all three sequences for a longer practice - your choice. I don't think of this as 'yin yoga' though as you don't hold the poses for very long. If one wants a truly wonderful yin yoga dvd, look at Mark Latham's dvd.

3659763,2,B001JT6Y8S,"I purchased this to replace a lost copy of Rodney Yee's Ultimate Power Yoga, which, in addition to some basic standing pose and sun salutations, has a great 10 minute ""Power Restoration"" section. I know this sounds like a contradiction in terms, but when done daily, it gave me great results on my tight hamstrings because he holds intense stretches for longer than usual.

I was hoping for a longer, more full-body version of that 10 minutes, but the poses here didn't do much for me. There are no standing folds at all. There were a lot of reclining twists and not a lot else. And she doesn't actually hold the poses that long. Rodney Yee actually holds his longer despite the limited time (or maybe it seems longer since they're slightly more challenging). Basics like downward dog only appear in the bonus section of more ""challenging"" poses.

Finally, she doesn't actually give very good guidance. I knew most of the poses, but didn't know where she was headed. Since you're lying down for almost all of the video, you have to crane your neck to actually see what she's doing. Her alignment cues were almost non-existent. So it doesn't even seem like it would be particularly good for beginners.",1401840000,4,1200,4.70952380952381
3659764,5,B001JT6Y8S,"This DVD is becoming one of my favorites and the one I really look forward to practicing.  Having stopped working out  for a few years - after an injury - I quickly discovered  I was not ready for the Power Yoga I used to practice with ease.  Decided to start again at Beginner's  level  and ordered  Mimi Solaire's  Deep Stretch and a few  other's,  (Rodney Yee Power Yoga Collectio; Kundalini - AnaBrett & Ravi Singh; Yoga Conditioning, Suzanne Deason;)

I am 66 - have arthritis and Mimi's, Deep Stretch/Yin Yoga  is a wonderful  method for not only those getting back into Yoga or  any kind of work out routine;  it's  a 'keeper'  for beginner to advanced levels period.  I've  practiced  Hatha Yoga since the early 70's  and was lucky enough  to have found excellent instructors  who learned their craft in India for 13 years before returning to the States to teach.  Mimi  brings me back  to that kind of  what I call 'Real Yoga'  feeling - and yet  most of her poses  are in a seated position;  making it easy for those who aren't  into  or  not ready  or just plain tired  of  repeated  'Sun Exercises' etc..

Rest assured,  as  'easy'  as  it is  - you 'will'  get a very decent workout too boot!",1389571200,6,1205,4.425233644859813

3659768,5,B001JT6Y8S,"I downloaded this video several months ago when I was in the middle of training for a half marathon and weekly injuries were part of the territory. Once I cut out 10-milers, the injuries stopped and I forgot about my purchase. That is until I pulled a muscle in my right leg. When the pain began radiating from my calf up through my glute, I remembered I had this video in my collection. I just did it and immediately feel a release in the tension. I plan on making it a part of my daily exercise regiment once again.

The colors are mainly white, so it's visually relaxing (though, I can't wait until I have the routine memorized so I can do it with my eyes closed for greater relaxation) and there is light music and soft instruction, so it is audibly soothing. There are three segments, each 20 minutes long, along with a bonus segment. This makes it easy to do the whole video if you have an hour, or focus on the part of the body that is ailing you if you only have 20 minutes. I plan on only doing the hips and legs segment, though I imagine I will do the video in its entirety when I need more stretching/relaxing.

I definitely recommend this as pre or post workout stretch for runners. Your muscles will feel released, you will gain flexibility which will help with your gait/speed and you will reduce the risk of injury and muscle fatigue.",1383436800,,1349,4.349206349206349

Now I stop at 48 minutes as the neck and shoulder stretches bother a degenerated disc in my neck. The rest of my back, legs, hips and body feel great as if I had a swim. Part 4 is too advanced for me but I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who needs a good stretch. I never realized how tight my joints were and how good you could feel from hatha yoga. Being a meditator, this program is amazing because it can give bliss without mantra or intensive pranayama.

I'm pretty limber, but with back pain, and pain from fibromyalgia I'm a little slow. Thus, my search continued for a yoga dvd that I could handle. My search ended when I found Deep Stretch/Yin Yoga With Mimi Solaire. I can keep up, I can do the poses, and best of all the stretches are easing my back and fibro pain! I do the whole hour every morning before breakfast, and afterward I feel great.  I know that exercise is supposed to cause your body to release endorphins that make you feel good. Truthfully, I used to go to a gym and work out.  I never felt anything but tired and sore.  For the first time, with this DVD, I have actually experienced what that release of endorphins feels like. I've been doing this DVD for about 6 months now, and plan to continue. Maybe in time I'll advance to Paul Grilley's DVD's.  Oh yes, I also just purchased Mimi Solaire's other DVD, back in Shape.

3659776,5,B001JT6Y8S,"I'm writing this review for other active 20somethings.  This DVD had very high reviews, but I wasn't sure about it.  All of the reviewers seemed to be grandparents or inactive adults, and I worried that this DVD would be too easy.  I'm also generally anti-yoga, and was looking for a stretch dvd not a yoga dvd.

So, why did I buy this DVD?  I have a full time job, a part time job, a mortgage, and I'm a year into a two-year executive MBA program. I feel tense most of the time, and I was looking for an outlet for all of that stress.

I felt different after just one session with Mimi.  I'll tell you now that you might not feel like you're doing anything while you go through the DVD (I didn't), but you WILL see and feel results.  I'm a former figure skater (15 years) and dancer, and now I run.  I honesty don't know how I lived my life before Mimi.

Mimi is calm and encouraging, and while I was initially skeptical, I now completely trust her. Her program allows you to relax completely and deeply.  It's a time to take inventory of both your body and mind. Many of us have very busy schedules, and the only time we stop moving is when we're asleep. I've found this DVD to be both a physical and emotional experience. If you have stress in your life, unacknowledged emotions you need to work through, or if you're just looking for some peace and self reflection, buy this DVD.

This one was my first choice and some of my friends got addicted. We love the music. I have a back and a knee problem and this DVD really helps. She warns you if there is a chance of injury if you get to ambitious. We are all surprised that it works for me. I actually like it better than the other Back in Shape DVD - also pretty good. I feel that with my friends we will use it for many years. It became a nice routine. I memorized some poses and do it before my workout in the gym.

Solaire's voice is a bit too monotone and can be annoying but she is very good with her instructions without being too wordy. Not the best music but ok. Too many birds. This will not make you a Yin expert but it does a good job at releasing tension and relaxing the body. Overall, I would recommend this dvd for the average user looking for a good stretch and alignment.",1254873600,15,631,4.3559322033898304
3659781,5,B001JT6Y8S,"This DVD offers three relaxing yoga practices, each focused on a different area of the body.  While this is not true Yin yoga (ie, most poses are held for two minutes or less, not three to five to ten minutes, as is traditional in Yin yoga), instructor Mimi Solaire did study under Yin yoga teachers Paul Grilley and Sarah Powers, and you can certainly see their influences here.  I also find Solaire's style somewhat similar to what we see from Barbara Benagh in her Yoga for Stress Relief and AM-PM Yoga practices.

As the Main Menu plays, Solaire explains that you will need a towel and a strap for the routines (a yoga mat is helpful as well, although Solaire herself practices on a fuzzy white rug).  The Main Menu offers the following options:  Full Program - Back Stretches - Hips & Legs - Neck & Shoulders - Bonus Super Stretch.  Solaire provides voiceover instruction during the practices, and (with the exception of the bonus segment) she generally does not name the postures.  She comes to relaxation pose (savasana) at the conclusion of each practice and encourages you to remain there for as long as time allows.  I have broken down each segment in greater detail below.

BACK  STRETCHES
This entire sequence is performed on the floor in either a reclined or seated position.  Solaire begins with a lying stretch, then moves into reclined knee-to-chest pose.  Flipping onto her stomach, she performs several repetitions of a gentle cobra pose, and then she comes to hands and knees for cat/cow stretches.  A seated twist follows, and then it is back to the floor for bridge pose, finishing with a reclined twist and relaxation.

HIPS & LEGS
Solaire begins here with reclined cobbler's pose.  This is followed by a thread-the-needle stretch and a thread-the-needle twist.  She then uses a strap for an extended reclined leg series, stretching the hamstrings from several different angles.  Next, Solaire comes to seated for head-to-knee pose, and she concludes the practice with relaxation.

NECK & SHOULDERS
This practice begins by using a rolled towel under the neck as a ""jelly roll.""  Solaire relaxes here with the arms out to the sides as well as with the hands on the forehead.  Removing the towel, she performs a stretch with one arm moving underneath and across the back; this is followed by a reclined twist.  Additional stretches include child's pose with one arm stretched across the body and eagle arms performed on each side.  This sequence concludes in a lying position with the rolled towel placed under the shoulder blades as a bolster.

BONUS SUPER STRETCH
Solaire cautions that you should not attempt this segment unless you have warmed up with the other sections of the DVD first.  She begins with a backbend, bow pose, and then moves into a very intense stretch, reclined hero's pose (no modifications are shown).  This is followed by downward-facing dog, full seated forward bend, and an eagle legs reclined twist.  A slightly longer relaxation ends this sequence.

With the exception of the Bonus Super Stretch (which personally, I believe should have been left off this DVD, as it really does not fit with the other routines and is significantly more intense), the practices here are very accessible and would be appropriate for those new to yoga; furthermore, Solaire herself is very non-threatening and non-intimidating.  I would definitely recommend this DVD to both beginners and more experienced yoga practitioners who are interested in short, focused yoga stretching practices targeted to different areas of the body.  My overall rating is 4 1/2 stars.",1252886400,42,3593,4.961538461538462
3659782,3,B001JT6Y8S,"Overall I like this video because of the format where you can either choose to do the whole body or just do sections. I also like that it does focus more on stretching than just relaxing however, for me, there is still a bit too much relaxing. I don't do yoga and am not particularly flexible so I'm not looking for something super challenging but I am looking to feel like I got a good stretch and I felt like this video was lacking a little.",1250640000,5,443,4.162790697674419
3659783,5,B001JT6Y8S,"This is my absolute favorite stretch video.  I own several but always seem to select this one to use, time and time again.  When you have finished one, two, or all of the segments you feel wonderful.  I would recommend this to anyone.",1242086400,3,234,4.395348837209302
3659784,5,B001JT6Y8S,"I'm fortunate to live in the Valley of the Sun and enjoy Mimi Solaire's live deep stretch classes at At One Yoga. When outta town or not able to make the studio session, I pop in the DVD for some awesome stretching and find the mental release is as great as the physical stretch. Feels like I've had a massage afterwards. Also, gifted my 88-year-old Nana Val (in Omaha, Nebraska) with a DVD. She's always boasted of being a flexible yogini, and she enjoys the remote healthy exercise with Mimi via DVD. Treat yourself to (or give the gift of) deep stretch with Mimi Solaire. Cheers!

8313706,5,B001JT6Y8S,excellent dvd! great stretch workout. I believe there are 4 different routines or combine them to make one. It is effective and the background music alone almost put me to sleep.
