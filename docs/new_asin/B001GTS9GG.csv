3620057,5,B001GTS9GG,Wonderful tool for capturing the attention of first graders while teaching them a difficult subject that they have trouble relating to. I was very excited to find [[ASIN:B001GTS9GG Schoolhouse Rock: America Classroom Edition [Interactive DVD].

3620079,5,B001GTS9GG,"This DVD has some great songs that even my 3 yr old is starting to memorize so I definitely think it will help my kids learn about American history. The only thing that drives me crazy about this DVD is that it only plays the first song automatically and doesn't advance without manual input. I usually play it in the van and you have to manually select the ""Play All"" feature so that it will go once over all the songs. It is quite a few clicks to get to that option too so it makes it hard when you can't see the screen to know if you're on ""Play All"". Otherwise you select one song at a time and since they are pretty short you have to do that often.",1368662400,,653,3.9923664122137406
3620080,5,B001GTS9GG,This collection of songs with video is exactly what I wanted to catch the students' attention. They love it. It is very handy to have all of the ones I use in one place instead of having to locate them on Youtube.,1360108800,2,213,4.095238095238095

Helped me learn many things as child before I even knew I was learning. Started school and realized songs I sang were now my classes. Shipped quick excellent quality.,1357689600,,341,4.666666666666667
3620083,5,B001GTS9GG,"These videos take me back to Saturday mornings as a kid.  They used to air  during commercials between cartoons.  My husband and I both can still sing these educational tunes- they just stick with you.  I was doing homework with my son and watching him struggle with verbs, adjectives ... Etc. When I started to sing these tunes to him he started laughing  So, the next day I ordered the a few of the videos and plan to order them all.  He loved them and as we did homework he sang the tune and wa- la he got it! The videos are reto old school but still awesome.",1332115200,,562,4.157407407407407
3620084,5,B001GTS9GG,"I graduated 8th grade in 1978, and thanks to School House Rocks mini-songs in between after school cartoons I was easily able to remember the Preamble & sing silently to myself during test time to write it down in 8th grade. Now my little ones 5 & 12 watch the video's in the car while traveling. I sneakily have only educational DVD's (also love Liberty Kids)in our van, because while we are traveling I have a captive audience. My now 12 year old at 1st said he was to old to watch them & before you knew it he's in the backseat eyes transfixed to the video. I pretend not to notice his avid interest, but hope that he will find learning this way will eventually be useful for his tests as well. School House Rocks!!! Do check out Liberty Kids as well, you can buy the whole series here on Amazon & very educational as well.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Liberty-s-Kids-Complete-Series/dp/B001B73PO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Liberty's Kids: Complete Series</a>",1320883200,4,1003,5.159509202453988
3620085,5,B001GTS9GG,I donated this edition to my son's first grade teacher and it is a big hit with her class. I can't think of a better way to learn about our government and history than school house rock.,1312934400,3,186,4.054054054054054
3620086,5,B001GTS9GG,"For anyone who grew up with the Schoolhouse Rock commercials as a kid you'll know how helpful these were to us as kids.  Since I was never taught much about the U.S. history or the Constitution in school, most of what I learned was from these videos.  Sad I know.  Well now I'm quite interested in U.S. history and the Constitution and I teach the Citizenship in the Nation merit badge to our Boy Scout troop.  Depending on the age of the boys, I frequently use the Schoolhouse Rock:  America because who doesn't want to know how to sing the Preamble to the Constitution?  Did you know that Gouvernor Morris wrote the Preamble because he believed that the citizens of this country wouldn't read the Constitution?  Well, that wasn't the case when the Constitution was new, but it sure seems to be the case now!  For anyone who wants to light a fire under the next generation, Schoolhouse Rock: America can sure help with its catchy tunes. It helps make the learning fun!",1306800000,22,969,4.5606936416184976
