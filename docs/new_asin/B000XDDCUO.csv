8228002,1,B000XDDCUO,"I have no idea what the actual product would have been........had I actually received the product that I ordered.  What I received was NOT a collectors set, but just some little DVD of a Cabbage Patch story. - about a 30 minute DVD...certainly NOT a collectors set like I ordered.  When I sent a complaint to the seller, I got absolutely NO response, so I would not purchase from them again.",1293667200,,391,4.492957746478873
8228003,5,B000XDDCUO,"On this DVD, Cabbage Patch Kids appear in stop motion in five fun and sweet short stories, jam-packed with music and humor. The DVD cover doesn't depict the films, nor the characters that appear in them. The characters look like claymation, but they remain true to the Cabbage Patch Kid look. Younger viewers may at times, however, have a difficult time following who is who since the characters occasionally have ""wig"" changes from episode to episode, but the bespectacled Norma Jean is typically a central character and is as easily identifiable as she is endearing.

The New Kid
Norma Jean Becknell has just moved to town, and is beginning school at Mount Yonah Elementary School. She gets there just as they are planning a school talent show. She's excellent with the fiddle, but well-meaning Melanie instead says she's good at baton-twirling and tap. The misunderstanding ultimately costs her a place in the show, which instead features a magic show, ventriloquist act, and musical numbers. Despite losing her chance, Norma Jean is put on the spot and eventually helps out in more ways than one, proving that she's a wonderful addition to Mount Yonah.

The Clubhouse
It's a battle of boys versus girls when the boys claim girls can't build tree-houses. Mary Beth makes it a bet. The prize for who builds the best tree-house? Pizza. The boys choose their supplies from a junkyard, while Mary Beth and the team of girls she assembles use connections to obtain professional building materials. The girls have a sleepover; the boys, a campout, and Vernon's fears of the dark and heights complicate the tree-house building and sleepover. Vernon likes ""the sisters,"" two girls who think a bit too much of themselves, and when they spy on the operations, Vernon must prove he is bigger than his fears.

The Screen Test
The children are all given an assignment by their teacher Mrs. Norris (though adults never really appear in any episodes) to profile a ""great act of bravery."" ""The sisters"" decide to write a report, while the rest of the kids work on a movie about a nurse who saved an explorer's life. Unfortunately, the camera and other supplies they have are outdated, the kids argue, Vernon accidentally erases ""the sisters'"" project, and the sound machine makes a hole in the boys' new clubhouse!

Saturday Night
This story stretches believability a bit, depicting elementary students (!) going to a school dance--and all the awkwardness that goes along with first dates. Despite the somewhat unrealistic plot, it's a really fun story. Travis' friend Seth is visiting town, and the girls immediately fall for him. Wonder of wonders, he likes less-than-beautiful Norma Jean! Jealous that they are not chosen, ""the sisters"" argue and break up their friendship, but eventually make up and decide to give Norma Jean a disastrous makeover that will be sure to cause Seth to dump her. The makeover is something not to miss! But what will Seth think of it?

The Sing-Along
This really isn't an episode, but rather a collection of the songs that appear in the other episodes. Unfortunately, without captions, it really isn't a sing-along, but more of a concert. However, the music on all the films is catchy and original.

Vernon's Christmas
Vernon wants to learn how to snowboard. Unfortunately, his friends think he already knows how. Even more disappointing, they live in an area that hardly receives any snow. Meanwhile, his two young cousins Amy and Henry are visiting for Christmas, and he hopes to make sure Santa visits them, especially after ""the sisters"" claim Santa went away on vacation. The Cabbage Patch Kids come up with a way to make sure Santa really visits Amy and Henry . . . but the plan involves the snowboard Vernon only pretends to know how to use.

All of the episodes are fast-paced and fun to watch. For young viewers, they offer messages of being kind, friendly, and cooperating with others. For older viewers, they will bring back pleasant memories of childhood. I only wish more episodes had been made.",1292457600,3,4028,4.9147058823529415
