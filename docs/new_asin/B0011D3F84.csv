8241392,5,B0011D3F84,"John Cleese  is superbly hilarious. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loved it. We seen all 0f the series and even sat down with our 9 year old granddaughter, who I thought was going to roll off the couch. We seen them in 1975 but wanted our own collection. Great work John Cleese!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1262304000,5,311,4.456140350877193
