1178340,4,B0000039D1,"Jennie Garth is the perfect ""Crystal Wyatt"" because she is just like her character in the book.  However, I was a little upset that they changed the story line from the book. The setting in the book takes place  after World War Two, not after Vietnam!!  Also, Crystal Wyatt was supposed  to go to Hollywood to act, and singing was secondary. I'm an avid Danielle  Steel reader and yes, the movie differs somewhat from the book, but the  actors are great, and this movie will definately have you in tears if you  are a romantic!!!",936921600,3,529,4.505263157894737
1178341,1,B0000039D1,Can't play the CD because it states that its a region error. Didn't say anything about region when I purchase it. I got rip off.,1426118400,,128,4.16
1178342,1,B0000039D1,This movie was a waste of my time. It was not moral. The main stars kept committing adultery. The main actor was fickle and frustrating. It was not a pleasant movie to watch. I did enjoy the promise very much.,1425427200,,209,4.25
1178343,4,B0000039D1,This movie is my all-time favorite. I enjoyed watching it.,1421712000,,58,4.9

1178346,2,B0000039D1,"I liked this movie because I like Craig Bierko, he's such a hunk.  The acting is mediocre though with the exception of the actress that played Bierko's wife.  Jenny Garth is not a good actress, but if you like sappy chick flicks, you will like this movie.  I have yet to see a Danielle Steel film that is as good as Lace, which is the best film of all and extremely hard to get.  This movie was predictable.",1286582400,,407,4.17948717948718
1178347,5,B0000039D1,This is one of my favorite Danielle Steel movies. I have seen it over 10 times and I just cant get enough of it. An amazing love story.,1280534400,2,135,3.857142857142857
1178348,5,B0000039D1,"I love Danielle Steel books more than anything, i find them so intriuging, and star is one of my favorite books, and so i really want to watch this movie, although i have seen the danielle steel movies, fine things, and once in a lifetime, i recommend these movies (and books) to any avid danielle steel reader.  If you have any information on where i can find this book, please let me know.....",1052784000,5,395,4.410958904109589
1178349,3,B0000039D1,"""STAR"" is my favorite book and I think that all the actors were cast perfectly and were wonderful but the movie and the book are sooo different! The movie was good enough that I read the book, but then realized the movie lacks so much of the detail that makes this story great-which I guess is expected for a TV movie. Knowing the full story makes it easier to like the movie-if you don't you'd think it was cheese.  If you are a die-hard romantic, and/or a Jennie fan, this is definitley the movie you'd want to see.",1014249600,5,517,4.275510204081633
