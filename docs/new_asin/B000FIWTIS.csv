2569516,5,B000FIWTIS,"What a delightful film.  My grandchildren love it.  It is entertaining as well as educational.  For cognitive development everyone should be able to speak and understand a foreign language, at least at a basic level, and for our country Spanish is the one most likely to be used.  This DVD is a pleasing and fun way for young children to learn basic Spanish vocabulary.",1146441600,7,369,4.71875
2569517,5,B000FIWTIS,"I instantly fell in love with this video! I loved the catchy music, adorable children, lovable puppets, and the colorful teaching of phrases! My husband and I find ourselves after watching it singing the songs and practicing the phrases as we get ready for bed. Buy this video for yourself or a gift for someone special. All ages will enjoy it!",1146441600,6,344,4.655737704918033
2569518,5,B000FIWTIS,"We really wanted our kids to have an early exposure to Spanish.  This was fun and so easy.  Our little ones love the Chihuahua and dance along to the nursery rhymes.  We all loved ""The Five Little Monkeys"" rap song.  This DVD also has numbers to twenty and simple commands.  We learned to say ""Te amo - I love you"" and say the nightime phrases every night.  The puppets are cute and the children in the video are all having fun and are using very basic, simple vocabulary.  The scenes with the girl and the dog are amusing and cute!  We also watched the first one and this one is much better for lots of reasons - mostly our kids really pay attention to the entire thirty minutes.  It has more music and better graphics.

  Our kids have picked up many new words and phrases and so have we! We Recommend this DVD to others beginners. Buenas suerte y buenas noches!",1146355200,4,864,4.298136645962733
8123486,5,B000FIWTIS,"I knew what I was purchasing prior to ordering this dvd. I had rented it multiple times from the library. This is not to be relied upon in order to truly teach the language, but is a great introductory and educational tool. I put this on as opposed to just sticking my little one in front of sprout.",1360108800,,299,4.172413793103448
8123487,5,B000FIWTIS,My son loves this. He is 4 and is quite entertained by this. He also loves to sing and repeat what he's hearing. It definitely works. He repeats back all the words and has a blast doing it.,1355443200,,189,4.0
8123488,1,B000FIWTIS,"We just finished watching it and I was very disappointed. There were several instances of incorrect Spanish, misspellings (one example: quatro instead of cuatro) and the speaking parts weren't even done by a native Spanish speaker. Also, both my 5 and 8-year old did not like it even though the packaging said for ages 3-8. There are so many other options out there. I would not recommend this one at all.

8123489,4,B000FIWTIS,"This is the second in this series that we have purchased. Our son has enjoyed the first (Tengo Hambre) since we got it when he was about 2 1/2.  He's now 3 1/2 and he really enjoys this new sweet dreams dvd as well.  It really holds his attention (suprisingly!) and it's a nice, quiet soothing dvd that's great for an activity near bedtime.  I've tried several other dvds / brands, but this series is by far the best I've found. I highly recommend both dvds.",1201392000,,458,4.3023255813953485
8123490,1,B000FIWTIS,"THis video is so bad I threw it away.  It features a bunch of gringos (I am a gringo too so don't take that the wrong way) speaking ""spanish"" with such a horrendous accent that it is actually difficult to understand what they are trying to say!  I have about 20 different spanish videos for my kids, put out by several different companies, that are great.  But this one is so full of mispronounced words that I did not want my girls to watch it even once!",1193875200,5,455,4.206896551724138
8123491,1,B000FIWTIS,The video is visually poor but the worst are the mistakes in Spanish and the horrible pronunciation. You don' t want your kid to learn this. Buy Plaza Sesamo in Spanish. That is great.,1178064000,4,184,4.4411764705882355
8123492,4,B000FIWTIS,"I'll be honest, I'm not crazy about this DVD. First of all, no one in it has an actual Spanish accent.  Second of all, it has a very ""home-made"" look to it, with cheap puppets, cheap graphics, etc.  The puppet segments make no sense and don't add anything to the learning experience, in my opinion.  But all that aside, my 3 year old son loves it and the first time he watched it, he wanted to see it over and over and over again.  He even repeated many of the words.  So even though I do not like it much, I have to admit that somehow it appeals to my child and so grudgingly, I recommend it.",1168300800,3,593,4.034188034188034
8123493,5,B000FIWTIS,"I purchased the first CD and my child loved it from the start.

She is 4 years old and knows most of the phrases and words from

the ""I AM HUNGRY"" CD.  Now we have purchased and watched the new

CD ""SWEET DREAMS"".  She loves it and now recognizes some

of the kids that speak on both CD's.  She loves showing out by

saying the words and acting out the phrases.  Her teacher for

Pre-K Spanish thinks the CD's are enhancing her eagerness to learn Spanish faster.  We love both CD's but ""Sweet Dreams"" is

our favorite. As the mother of a gifted child it has been

recommended that she learn a second language.  My child once said to me ""mommy if I clean up my toys in your room, can I watch my ""Sweet Dreams"" CD""? That tells me something!  In my opinion, children learning from other children tops all learning tools. Like me, I know their are other parents looking for something to start off or help their kids with Spanish. I am happy to be able to share my experience with other parents.

Thank You",1148947200,6,1001,4.24468085106383
8123494,5,B000FIWTIS,"This video teaches Spanish using repition.  My son thought that the video was ""funny"".  He has asked to watch it again and again.  The video displays an object then pronounces the spanish word.  The best way to describe this is video flash cards.  The video does a great job of showing the spanish word.",1147564800,3,303,4.537037037037037
8123495,5,B000FIWTIS,"I have three children ages 3, 6 and 10 and they all loved this DVD.  It really emphasizes every day houshold items and reinforces the spanish language very well.  The bright colors and happy music make this a video which is not only educational but very entertaining.  My kids have watched it over a dozen times and are excited to show me how much they have learned.  This video is unlike others in that it reinforces the same words throughout the entire video using fun puppets and bright kids.  If your serious about teaching your children spanish in a fun and entertaining way, this is a must buy for your household.",1146700800,4,619,4.54054054054054
