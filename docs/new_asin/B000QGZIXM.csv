8196465,5,B000QGZIXM,"Unlike the other three from Season 1, this is structured as a stand-alone episode.  And what an episode it is!  Besides the extraordinary Doreen Jacobi (actress, model, software executive, etc.), we are treated to Rutger Hauer in his most eccentric mode (love his gold makeup!).  Even writer/creator Lex Gigeroff makes a notable onscreen musical appearance.

The story itself is top-notch, taking (at least this reviewer) some time to fully comprehend.  Characters are as colorful as could be, the action well-paced (though perhaps the first 20 minutes could have been 10-15 minutes).  Things do descend into silliness by the climax of the tale, but this matches the tone of the later seasons well.  Hauer is simply unforgettable, and helps make the entire movie unforgettable for any (open-minded) science fiction fan.",1374710400,,819,5.3023255813953485
8196466,5,B000QGZIXM,"I, as I have said before, enjoy a great deal of science fiction. This series is a corker. I have not had any disappointments.",1359676800,,125,4.25

8196468,5,B000QGZIXM,"This is the most unique show I have ever seen on TV. During its Hey Day, I would

  watch every episode, more than once.  It's weird, adventurous, sexy and humorous

  all roll into one.  Just get it, i don't want to explain too much. Just be prepared for

  anything because it is Lexx...",1322697600,,289,4.264150943396227
8196469,5,B000QGZIXM,"On the run from the devine shadow & looking for a safe place. Stan the captain who is a coward,Zev love slave & half cluster lizard,790 robot head obsessed love of Zev who would like to get rid of Stan as he sees him in the way of his love for Zev which I saw as goofy & the only chacter I did not like. Kai dead assassin kills whoever Zev or Stan wants him to or to get them out of trouble there obsessions get the into. Finally Lexx the most powerful wheapon in the two known universes & a living bug ship who can destroy whole planets & does so at the whim of whoever is captain but needs organic matter to live. As good as the first in the series but expensive for an episode under two hours. Worth a look if you want to pay the price.",1185580800,,739,3.9006622516556293
