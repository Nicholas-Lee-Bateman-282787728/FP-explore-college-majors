7694777,5,B01CZ3K23E,Great 80's tv show about a hi tech military helicopter. Awesome packing and picture quality! Highly recommended but the $100 price is a bit too much. You can find it half that price elsewhere.,1463184000,2,192,4.676470588235294
7694778,3,B01CZ3K23E,"I love Airwolf.  I admit it; I have a particular fondness for the show.  But this release by Mill Creek is lacking.  The sound and video quality is what you expect of a show made in the mid-80s with a 4:3 aspect ratio and 2 channel Dolby Digital but that's where it ends.  For those asking about subtitles I'm sorry to say you are out of luck.  I've checked multiple episodes on multiple discs and I haven't seen any subtitles/captions.

The packaging is mediocre to the extreme.  Mill Creek, a company know for 'quality' packaging is at it again with delightful cardboard sleeves; 2 discs to a sleeve.  Every disc in the collection has light scratches on the bottom and though I have yet to run into any issues caused by it I still find it unacceptable.  The sleeves themselves are in a larger sleeve that slides up into the outer casing.  The outer box itself was slightly mushed on the corners.

All in all this is a mediocre release of the series but at least at a budget price.  4 stars for Airwolf; 2 for Mill Creek.",1463184000,62,1022,4.377659574468085

7694780,1,B01CZ3K23E,"First off, let me say that I am a HUGE!!!! Fan of Airwolf, I have been since it first aired on CBS back in the 80's when I was a kid. I followed it all around TV especially enjoying its run on WWOR Channel 9 (man I miss those days) Anyways i was curious and anxious when i first read about this blu ray release, having been curious also about the UK release(which I was this close to purchasing) What a way to screw up a good thing...Mill Creek Did a good job with the transfer, however.......WHY????? No Extras!!!....NOTHING!! I really have a hard time believing that there is nothing hanging around the Universal Vaults that could have been put on this set, for us the die hard fans. There could have been so much more done with this set....Oh, and if any of you out there already have the original DVD releases for all 4 seasons.....hang on to them...Once again we have subtle changes for the transfer. The first thing I did was put in Season 4 (yes, I know) but I wanted to see something. On the DVD release, Universal was nice enough to keep in the commercial break bumpers, in which there is music and different shots of Airwolf flying around the beautiful countryside...well these are GONE...on the blu ray...Also, on the discs, there is no music or sound on the main screen, or thumbnails per episode. Folks, Had i not found this at such a low price, I would be even more upset, Keep your DVD's, anyone that wants the blu ray check EBay, I have a copy that is going up for sale real fast!!!!!",1462838400,6,1500,4.360714285714286
7694781,5,B01CZ3K23E,"""AIRWOLF"" was truly a product of ""High Tech"" 1980s entertainment! competing with ABC-TV's version of ""BLUE THUNDER"",based on the 1983 movie,the CBS series from Belisarius Prods. and Universal Television was an exiting and fast paced action adventure show,that didn't fail to deliver!
created by Donald P Belisario,""MAGNUM,PI"" co-creator,the concept of an advanced high tech helicopter,with Mach 1 speed capacity,was about as realistic as it got! Jan Michael Vincent and Ernest Borgnine was perfectly cast in the show,along with Alex Cord,and later,Jean Bruce Scott,as the series involved around the dangerous events of a coup over the hijacking of a top secret helicopter by it's demented inventor,played by the late David Hemings,and the introduction of ""The Firm's"" former top pilot ""Stringfellow Hawke"",who along with friend & mentor ""Dominic Santini"" are assigned to recapture Airwolf from its Libyan location. but the conditions of this covert mission were unique,,Hawke will do the mission,in return for The Firm's help in locating his Vietnam MIA brother St John Hawke,,so as this 1984 TV series got underway,the pilot episode was well made,and well scripted (and directed!) and it didn't hold back on the action and adventure! ABC's ""BLUE THUNDER"" didn't make as big an impact,though it was enjoyable,it was no match for ""AIRWOLF""s TV run,during its January 1984 debut! the helicopter itself,a beautiful Bell Jet Ranger,was actually the true star of this show,equipped with extremely ""high tech"" gadgetry,both realistic and very believable,and hidden in an unknown part of the American Desert called Valley of The Gods,in a response to The Firm's unethical actions that they took (stealing Hawke's art collection,as insurance to commitment to the mission) to guarantee their efforts to recover his MIA brother,before he returned the copter,and fly on dangerous missions,,engage,and blow away enemy aircraft,,and basically save the day!! this was a great TV show,but unfortunately like most prized jewels of Primetime,and the executive politics of the TV network business,""AIRWOLF"" barely managed Three seasons on CBS,and after its cancelation in 1986,the USA Cable Network picked-up the rerun rights,and a Fourth season of the show,,but it wasn't the same thing! gone were Belisario,who still got credit over his TV creation,the new version of the series was in the hands of an inexperienced producer named Arthur Annecharico,who,under Universal,shot this new version in Canada,where it was cheaper to produce,budget-wise,,and it went down the drain,as it just didn't have the same production values that the CBS show had! viewers will see this,when they purchase the BluRay box set,which i seriously recommend to people,who knew and enjoyed 80s TV at it's best! the CBS version was better,as was the casting,,and is still widely enjoyed by a new generation of viewers today! worth the ownership for serious collectors,and total fun,as Universal Television in the 80s cranked-out great TV shows like ""THE A-TEAM"",KNIGHT RIDER"",,and of course,""MAGNUM,PI""-but ""AIRWOLF"" was a superior product of that studio,and the stepping stone that led Donald P Belisario onto greater things,like ""QUANTUM LEAP"",and his long running series ""J.A.G."",and the spin-off,""NCIS"" in 2003,still enjoying its run,with two spin-off shows currently running!",1461801600,4,3339,5.653386454183267

Every episode is the same: A heart-stringy plotline, villains with fighter jets or a high performance attack helicopter, and the plotline resolution which begins with the Airwolf theme music, and ends with the bad guys being shot out of the sky. Airwolf is kept in Arizona, and Hawke's cabin is in Colorado, yet he can jeep there in 20 minutes. At its home base, Airwolf is never fueled, fixed, armed, maintenanced, or even washed, yet it is always there ready to go. I won't even elaborate on  the impossibility of transonic helicopter flight, or the perils of flying over mach at 20 feet AGL. Three decades since this series was produced and looking back you wonder what you were thinking back then by watching this nonsense. And then for USA Network to raise this shipwreck in the fourth season and expect it to float? It didn't, it just sank again.",1524268800,,937,4.511764705882353

7694795,5,B01CZ3K23E,"Airwolf(1984-1987) was a great TV show created by Donald P. Bellisario. It was an homage to the action movie Blue Thunder(1983).
The government spends money for a mad scientist to build Airwolf. ""Airwolf"" was played by a modified Bell 222 helicopter. The mad scientist kills a bunch of people and defects to Libya. Archangel recruits Stringfellow Hawk(Jan Michael Vincent) to steal Airwolf from Libya. Stringfellow Hawk's brother St. John(""sinjin"") is a POW lost in Vietnam. Belinda Bauer plays a secret agent who falls in love with Hawk. You feel his pain when the villain leaves her to die in the desert. Ernest Borgnine played Dominic Santini, Hawk's friend. The first season of Airwolf was ""mature"" and filled with 1980's Reagan era patriotism. CBS wanted a more ""kid friendly"" tone for the second season. Things went downhill in seasons 3 and 4; the producers used more stock footage, a stunt pilot was killed and the star of the show was dealing with substance abuse. The fourth season was made on the cheap and tried to create new characters, but it was too little, too late. There was an Airwolf Nintendo game that was awfully similar to the Top Gun video game. Sylvester LeVay's synthesizer-driven Airwolf music is really cool. Airwolf is classic 1980's era TV.",1521158400,2,1270,4.9392523364485985

7694803,5,B01CZ3K23E,"I am glad that I was able to watch the entire series. I think the first 3 seasons were the best. The 4th season, while not the same show, did offer some closure. For me, any Airwolf is still better than no Airwolf. I think if it weren't for Vincents drinking problem the show would have been much different in Season 4. I understand the need to have more episodes so the show could go into syndication. The Season 4 actors did the best that they could under the circumstance.

I think I read somewhere that Jan Michael Vincent was the highest paid actor at the time the show was being made and its too bad that he had a drinking problem. In general the story lines were good as well as the actors and various guest stars.

Alex Cord (Archangel) played his roll well. Often times he was mixed up in some questionable deals (the enemy of my enemy is my friend), Ernest Borgnine (Dominic Santini) and Stringfellow Hawke (Jan-Michael Vincent) play well off each other. Jean Bruce Scott (Caitlin OShannessy) was a guest star at first and turned into a series regular. The show had everything going for it and just ended too soon.

I wish that producers would make an ending show in the event that the series was canceled that could be aired or at least included in a box set to wrap up the show. I new Airwolf movie would be good too. Even if they could not film the ""ending"" show, at least have a story line that could be included in the notes or read by someone as a special feature.",1516492800,7,1480,4.316546762589928

I too would like closed captioningit isn't here.
Some complain about the Blu ray qualitythe episodes I've watched on my DVD set are very clear (I'd say cheaper cameras on Season 4, not as clear but still good). On a big enough screen (and maybe upscaled in resolution on your player) you might be able, in the pilot, to read the information plate on the landing gear that the lizard briefly rides onthat indicates a good image to me. They had some great helicopter piloting in many of the episodes.
The sound seems good as the pictures on the episodes I've watched.
If you want the sort of episode list that should've been provided at this writing Amazon has it in their product description. Season, episode number and title, date of broadcast (but no episode description).

behind the scenes clips with a simple menu (play all or episode select).  I got this
for Season 4, which I had only seen I handful of episodes and I wanted to re-watch
episodes from Seasons1-3

Season 1 only has 11 episodes and I like them all as we get to know Hawke, Dom, Marella,
and Archangel.

Season 2 brought Caitlin and stories like rebellion, biological warfare, and others as the
Airwolf crew and Marella and Archangel from the Firm tries to stop them.  I still like all
these episodes.

Season 3 still has Hawke and Dom.  Caitlin is learning and growing more.  Marella is gone
replaced by other operatives since Archangel is not in every episode.  I do not like
every episode and it seems like everyone is going through the motions.

Season 4 - I first saw some of these episodes on the MeTV Channel several years ago.
This is with a new cast.  St. John seems to be a more laid-back version of String, John
Locke is a shadow of Archangel (Archangel seems to have more experience than Locke),
and I do like Jo Santini and Mike Rivers.  It would have been nice to have Marella or Archangel
look for what happened to String or even Caitlin.  The episodes seem to be a rehash of episodes
that have already occurred in the previous seasons, but I did like the dynamic between the
characters, who fought at times but would help each other.  Must watch!  Don't expect any frills.

It takes more than a month to view all the discs.  Mill Creek is unresponsive to replace bad discs. On the other hand, Universal has been wonderful on replacing any bad discs, but this is not handled by Universal, unfortunately.",1494115200,2,675,4.487804878048781

7694878,4,B01CZ3K23E,"AIRWOLF: The Complete Series on Blu-Ray

Long time fan of this series.  It is the first show I remember recording and saving all the episodes as a kid.  Owned the tv movie on VHS.  Later bought season one on dvd through Columbia House and eventually later season dvd sets when they were released.

So when the region one blu-rays by Mill Creek were announced I was hesitant.  Do I really want to double dip, or triple dip, in this instance?  Plus, Mill Creek is notorious for being cheap on production and packaging, so would I feel ripped off?  But in a moment of impulse buying weakness I picked up the complete collection...

So was it worth it?

In terms of blu-ray quality, for a show over 30 years old it is pretty decent.  It is definitely better than my Airwolf original dvd releases.  But compared to my beloved BATTLESTAR GALACTICA which was released on blu a couple of years back, and is even older than Airwolf, it pales in comparison.  Classic BSG on blu looks amazing, I would give its video quality a high 9 out of 10.  Airwolf, I would give a 7.5.  The typical talking head scenes show their age, but the aerial combat scenes, with the blue skies and open horizons look fantastic.  Also, the framing of this older series compliments 16x9 nicely if you want to zoom in (cinema tv mode) to fill up your big screen tv, not too much is cut off and as I said the air combat looks incredible.

No surround sound audio.  No bonus features.  Each blu has 5 or 6 episodes.  Each season is in its own plastic case, though the disks are stacked on top of each other, not separated.  Though this is slightly better than Mill Creek's usual of putting all their dvds is paper slips and piled on top of each other.

How does Airwolf still hold up?

Airing from 1984 to 1988, the series was created by Donald P. Bellisario (Magnum PI, NCIS, JAG, Tales of the Gold Monkey) and starred Jan-Michael Vincent as String Fellow Hawke (what a name!!!) and Ernest Borgnine (nicest guy ever!!) and Alec Cord.  And features one of the greatest tv themes ever by Sylvester Levay.  It was the most expensive tv series on the air at the time, with Vincent pulling down a pay check of $250,000 per episode.

Season One
This season is pretty damn near perfect 80s action drama.  In many ways, it was ahead of its time.  Dark, moody, sophisticated, political and gritty.  A cold war espionage thriller grounded with complicated and engaging characters performed by a charismatic cast.  Only 12 episodes as a mid season series replacement and all are still highly entertaining and rewatchable. 10/10

Season Two
Like all networks, CBS could not leave a winning formula alone, and ordered the show to be less dark, less topical and less international.  More domestic threats were created, though over all the series still has a nice balance between lighter fare and some very substantive grim episodes. And even though the show's very formulaic story structure (every final act was Airwolf in combat) was obvious, solid character writing and casting kept the show very entertaining.  Jean Bruce Scott joined the cast as a potential love interest, but that never materialized since Scott and Vincent reportedly did not like each other.  Also, Vincent's abuse of drugs and alcohol were significantly affecting his performance.  8/10

Season Three
After fighting with the network for two seasons, Bellisario departed the series and the show was watered down even more to be family friendly.  It was not Knight Rider-level drama, but it was not far off either.  Also, Vincent had sadly spiralled even deeper into drug abuse.  Many times over the years I have watched a season one ep back to back with a late season 3 ep, and it is shocking to see the obvious deterioration in the man.  It is so sad.  There is a handful of decent adventures, but most are forgettable.  6.5/10

Season Four:
CBS cancelled Airwolf, but the rights were picked by the USA network for a fourth season.  Vincent appears in the premiere but is killed and replaced by Barry Van Dyke as Hawke's missing brother SinJin.  All new, boring, bland cast, almost no continuity to the previous seasons and seemingly zero tv budget.  All the Airwolf footage was recycled from the previous seasons and the stories were average fare.  Was this last season as horrible as many say?  On it's own, it ok, mindless entertainment.  There are actually a few episodes I enjoyed.  But when compared to the previous season one and two, this just painful to watch.  4/10

So is the complete series on blu ray worth buying for only two out four great seasons???  Even at 50bucks, that isn't a bad price, considering the original dvd season sets used to cost $25-$35 a piece.  And as I said, the picture upgrade is noticeable.  It isn't awesome but it is an improvement.  So if you are an Airwolf fan or have been curious, I can think of worse ways of blowing 40 to 50 bucks.",1487030400,22,4903,4.630662020905923

That said, keep this in mind when you get it:
The format is in a 4:3 aspect ratio.  If you are like me, even seeing the same cut scenes of airwolf fighting in nearly each episode (lol), it doesn't matter.  The picture looks great.

7694985,4,B01CZ3K23E,"It can be said that Airwolf was television's answer to the hit movie Blue Thunder. However the two are very different animals as their plotlines, characters, and even the super-choppers themselves were wildly different. Airwolf was a television series that lasted four seasons, and not only featured the seminal aircraft, but also a cast of characters that held just as much, if not more, importance to the series. This is one of those shows where the earlier seasons are the better ones, and things taper down from there until you get a completely new show by the fourth season. If you're a fan of the show this is about the best transfer you are going to find, but don't expect an amazing release.

Airwolf is about the reclusive Stringfellow Hawke (Jan Michael Vincent), who has recaptured a super-high tech helicopter (Airwolf) for a secret government agency (The Firm). He refuses to return Airwolf until he learns about what happened to his brother (who has been MIA since Vietnam). A love/hate relationship builds between Hawke's crew and the Firm as they carry out independent missions of national security. All the while Hawke still tries to find out what happened to his brother and the Firm keeps trying to find ways to steal back Airwolf.

The first season to me is the best of them all. It felt topical with all the cold war talk going on back in that day, and this made for a kind of serious storytelling you just weren't seeing on prime time in 1984. The seminal Airwolf actually played second fiddle to the characters and storyline, which is a good thing. Season two is where the studio stepped in and started to make changes, trading international espionage with more localized action. Also they started to put said action on the forefront of the series instead of character and story development. By the time season three rolled around the new formula was getting tired, and apparently the network agreed and unceremonously cancelled the season. Then USA picked up the series, essentially rebooting the series with all new characters. They did manage to answer a lot of the questions left behind when the series was cancelled so at least there was that. So with that in terms of having just the best of the series you could do with just getting Airwolf Season One, however if you can't just leave questions unanswered you will need to see the whole thing (well at least up to first couple episodes of season 4).

Acting on Airwolf was actually a good balance. Jan Michael Vincent is a bit of a straight man, and was likely casted for his looks and demeanor as much for his acting chops. This gets balanced out with the highly charismatic Ernest Borgnine as sidekick and co-pilot. Alex Cord plays the anti-hero leader of the Firm in such a good way you can't help but have a love to hate (to love) the character. The second season brought in Jean Bruce Scott as a romantic element, and she succeeds in changing the cast dynamic in a good way. Of course what every kid was really into were the aerial fight scenes and even though they generally didn't pop up until the end of the episode there were well worth the wait in terms of excitement and action. These actions scenes were done using practical effects for the most part. Airwolf would destroy really good looking models of jets and copters with just a slight amount of animation added for missiles firing and hitting targets.

This collection has been restored from the original 35mm film, and is presented in full 1080p resolution in its original 4:3 aspect ratio. This sounds wonderful, but we are talking about a 30+ year old television show that didn't garner a lot of studio support. The transfer is not bad, but don't expect the kind of high definition experience you are used to seeing with other older films. There is a noticeable amount of blemishes that are likely part of the original print that weren't digitally removed, so this isn't a remaster or a full restore. Just a transfer. Visually it's going to have that 80's TV look, but it's at least clean and looks better than previous transfers.  Still I would rate this as a really good DVD quality instead of high def just to set your expectations in the right perspective.

Audio has the same issue with it being a 30+ year old show that was broadcast in mono back in the day. Luckily the show was recorded in stereo, so at least you get two channel Dolby Digital. Still not going to be a sonically satisfying experience as the audio has not be remastered and is just a straight transfer. Now for the extra features.... oh wait... there are none. That's right ladies and gentlement. This is a bare bones release with no extras to speak of. Not even the two extra language options the old DVD set had.

So if you're looking for the ultimate Airwolf collection this is not it, nor does it exist yet. What you get is a collection that is visually superior to the DVD transfers previously made, slightly better audio, and the inclusion of the previously neglected fourth season. If you are a big fan of the show and must see it again this is a pretty good way to go. It's just not great, and there is no telling if there will ever be a ""great"" release of this show. It's a gamble for me to say wait on a better edition since oftentimes this is all you get, and fans will make them rare over time (and much more expensive). It's a tough call, so I can say is get it if it calls to you and it really excites you get the entire series in one package finally.",1464652800,6,5489,4.560851926977688
7694986,4,B01CZ3K23E,"I never could have dreamed we'd get Airwolf in high definition on bluray but thankfully we have and the picture quality is stunning!  I never would have imagined that it would have taken more than 30 years just to see Airwolf in its proper Dupont Phantom Gray Metallic color because it looked black when it was broadcast on standard definition televisions and even on the DVD.

The episodes were scanned and restored from their original film prints and the picture quality looks sharp with high detail resolution.  I noticed a couple of episodes though were incorrectly encoded interlaced in 1080i on ""Once a Hero"" and ""Out of the Sky.""  I doubt Mill Creek will fix these and offer replacement discs so I had to rip them and de-interlace them myself to improve the picture quality.

Sadly the audio is just mono 2.0 Dolby which is how the sound was originally mixed and broadcast.  Only a handful of shows like Miami Vice were being broadcast in stereo by the mid-eighties.  Still, it would have been nice to have heard the show remixed in a pseudo 5.1 Dolby surround to hear the howl of The Lady flying past or hearing Sylvester Levay's awesome high-tech electronic themes arpeggiate in a true stereo mix but unfortunately the original composer session tapes are presumed lost forever.

I was also surprised that Season 4 was also included as it was produced by a Canadian production company for the USA network on shoestring budget with an entirely different cast using only stock footage of Airwolf and the quality of the production resulted in a low-rent shadow of the original show but at least they have been included to make this a ""Complete"" box set.

Overall I'm quite pleased with the release.  While some may bemoan the lack of any extras, the episodes are the real ""meat and potatoes"" here.  There was an interview with Ernie Borgnine prior to his death that was included on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airwolf-The-Movie/dp/B00555ZTQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airwolf: The Movie</a>&nbsp;DVD from a few years ago that they probably could have included and there are plenty of interviews with Jan Michael Vincent on the internet to watch if you want to hear about his tragic fall from grace post Airwolf.  I prefer to remember Stringfellow Hawke as the hero he was from my childhood.

For the first time in over 30 years I can now watch Airwolf as it was meant to be seen and no matter how many times I see her she still takes my breath away!",1464480000,33,2506,4.923990498812351

I will give kudos 1stly 2 Amazon, 4 the price & their delivery ahead of the scheduled date!!!! Also I will tell them later about their packaging in their feedback section!!!! Next, Mill Creek, u r applauded by most ppl 4 your releasing the ""complete"" series, yes, the 4th season is included! It's always been a thorn in the side 4 most ppl, as we debate it's existence or relevance to the much loved series!!!
Now, the packaging of this dvd boxset is absolutely atrocious!!!!! It's pictured by another reviewer below & the ""cardboard"" hubs, r a definite way 2 scratch the discs, unless u r a skilled surgeon or a able-bodied crane operator!!!!
It does appear that there seems to be some sort of clean-up done videowise, but a full & proper comparison with the original Universal dvd boxsets is something that will be done in due course. But an initial observation is that Mill Creek has packed more episodes on less discs!!! The original 1-3 season boxsets consisted of a total of 12 discs, while this boxset for the aforementioned seasons consists of a total of 10 discs!!! I'm hoping that there aren't any compression or skipping problems, again I'll update this in time. It would be  wise to place these discs in individual boxset cases because the present packaging plain sucks!!!!!
So relive the adventures of the Lady, Stringfellow Hawke, & Dominic Santini et al which we enjoyed over 30 years ago & yes, diehard season 4 fans, enjoy the ""further"" adventures of Airwolf!!!!",1464048000,11,1507,4.751908396946565

7694992,5,B01CZ3K23E,"Airwolf finally sees light of day on blu-ray for the region 1 release and being an avid fan of the series, I had to have it. I also had the luck of purchasing the UK R2 release when it went up on sale for discounted price, not knowing if R1 would ever be released; so I went ahead and got R2 first. Now if you're reading this you may already know about the series so I will keep this brief and use this opportunity to describe differences between the R1 and R2 release of the blu-ray sets. As far as visual and audio quality goes, there is no discernible difference between the two, considering this series is over 30 years old from time of this review and not nearly as popular as say Miami Vice from that era, this release received a good treatment. Don't be fooled, this set is a vast improvement over the earlier DVD releases so if you had to decide between the two: this set would be the ideal choice. The hazed look of the DVD is gone and the picture appears much sharper, and colors more vibrant. The audio could have used some fine tuning and upgrade to surround (come on it's Airwolf, it would have sounded amazing) instead of the passable stereo sound we have here, alas that was not to be. Both releases look and sound the same. Even season 4 looks much better than its' earlier DVD release. The footage shot on 16mm transferred well to blu-ray considering the age of the series, although the near-frequent switch from that to standard video quality makes for a jarring experience at times.

The difference in this set, at least far as I have explored up to this point, is that it corrects the issues that plagued the UK release. For one, episode Bite of the Jackal is fully intact, no scenes have been cut for this release. Secondly the episode Once a Hero does appear to be interlaced (if that's the correct term for the visual issue) as it did on UK release. However, in episode Proof Through the Night there is a slight audio stutter/ issue in the scene where the duo is driving to the lair of Airwolf, this issue is present on this set as well: probably a problem with original source. Other than that everything seems to be in order, the song Money for Nothing is present in the last episode of season 3 in both sets. I have not yet checked each episode, but if there is a problem I will come back to edit it in here. As far as German release goes, the only upside to that set is that it has subtitles (aside from music less German track) which is lacking from UK and NA release. From what I gathered of German set, that release does not contain any of the teasers for episodes but both R1 and R2 sets do.

The packaging for this series comes off cheap but in contrast to Shout-Factory's recent releases, at least I was able to remove discs with ease (despite being stacked). The menus are static as is usual for Airwolf's release in NA, I never understood why they never bothered making menus a little neater and animated as R2 releases. Lastly, there are no bonuses in this set or the UK one, and this is where Shout is amazing, they always provide some bonus features and they did for Airwolf, but only the movie version of the pilot that they released. With all that in mind, I would say that this set (R1) is the definitive release of Airwolf on blu-ray if you don't care for subtitles.",1463702400,11,3308,4.3424878836833605
7694993,5,B01CZ3K23E,"I've always enjoyed watching Airwolf when it was shown on the USA Network everyday in the afternoons. That was until the original episodes quit being aired and the not so great fourth season episodes became the norm, and then the show no longer was on the air. I did eventually buy the first three seasons on DVD, which cost more than then I paid for this set. Season four came out, but I had no interest in buying it, and if you ask me with this set it's really just seasons 1-3 with season four being the extra feature. Airwolf is TV show a lot ike Knight Rider, and pretty much every episode is about the same, some situation arises, and Stringfellow Hawke flies Airwolf, a modified Bell 222 which kind of resembles a shark, in to complete the mission. Even though I enjoy the show, it does show signs of low production values. As you go through each episode, a lot the shots of the helicopter flying are usually recycled from previous episodes, probably to cut down on cost. Even the cockpit interior shots have this same issue, with the crew have those helmets on you can't see there mouths moving so syncing is not an issue. Every now and then old grainy stock footage is edited in where needed, usually it's old war time footage from the Vietnam and Korean wars. Often times locations and even supporting cast are recycled as well, you see one person play one character, and then play yet a different and unrelated one in another. Seasons one and two are the best, while season three falls short at times. Season four is not unwatchable, but I did not watch any of the episodes before I did this review. For it being an 80's TV show, and was made for television at the time, the aspect ratio and the audio is the same as the Universal DVD's, 1.33 to1 and typically mono sound. The picture quality is very good, I can see the grain from the 35mm, which was something I could barley see on the DVD verions. The helmets worn in the helicopter cockpit, I have noticed have a metallic look to them, while they looked flat grey on the DVD. It's hard to say what this set was mastered from, the 35mm camera negatives, or the high resolution broadcast tapes, either way it looks pretty good. Some might complain that they didn't master the image to fill the 1.77 to 1 aspect of todays TV screens, but to do that they have to crop the image accordingly to do so, and besides none of the other shows I have are like that. While there is no extra features or anything like that, but there is one that is missing that I don't miss, that annoying Universal logo that was on the front of all the DVD discs.",1463616000,17,2599,4.360824742268041
