5926573,5,B00EKQOULU,"The writing on this is superb.  The twists of the story are innovative, and you never know if the main charactor or the gun will win in the end.  The number of big name stars in this series are many.  The only thing that they all share, is this absolutely gorgeous gun that appears to be a special Army Colt that gets passed from person to person.  The gun is pure evil.  So, does evil win, or does good triumph over evil?  I wish they had made way more than the episodes they did.  isnt' that always the way with the good stuff?",1314748800,7,529,4.077669902912621
5926574,5,B00EKQOULU,WONDERFUL. VERY NICE AND CLEAN. WAITING FOR NEXT ONE. THIS IS JUST WHAT I EXPECTED IT WOULD BE. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE.,1312848000,,124,4.208333333333333
5926575,3,B00EKQOULU,"unfortunately, I had no way of knowing that there was NUDITY in this series.  Quite shocking.  Not in all of the episodes, but there was nothing to indicate that this could be expected.  Some of the story lines are a little simplistic, but they are short and there are enough interesting ones to make up for it.",1304467200,5,311,4.421052631578948
5926576,5,B00EKQOULU,"This Western series that was billed as a cross between ""Gunsmoke"" & ""The Twilight Zone"" when it orignally appeared on Showtime in the late 1990's has finally been released on DVD & it has been worth the wait!  Each episode revolves around the story of a cursed gun that brings misery to whoever possesses it.  Ominously narrated by Kris Kristofferson, each episode is a different story with a completely different cast, the gun being the only thing central to each episode.

Alliance (Universal) has done a magnificent job of presenting crystal quality of the episodes on each disk.  In season one you get every episode that appeared in the series INCLUDING the first three episodes (The Great McDonagle, Fool's Gold & My Brother's Keeper) which were originally shown on Showtime before Dead Man's Gun was made into a series and NOT usually seen in the reruns on TV.

This Western series is a little off the usual path of westerns but the excellent writing & suspense places it a firm notch above the norm.  It's a shame that only 44 episodes of this series were made, but all 44 were quite well done.

If you like westerns, you'll like this!!",1300233600,14,1143,4.685
5926577,5,B00EKQOULU,"""The Imposter"" is an easy to view, fun film about a meek, nave, and somewhat foolish peddler, who frightens easily, who finds a dead man and his horse outside of town in the Old West. The horse had apparently bolted when it saw or heard a rattlesnake, and the man fell off and broke his neck. The man was carrying a letter that offered him a job for $25 a month, much more money than the peddler ever made. There is no indication what the job is. The man was wearing a beautiful gun. The peddler decides to take his place. He arrives in town saying he is the hired man and finds out that he, a meek and oft-frightened man, has been hired as the town marshal.

 Viewers will enjoy seeing how he handles his job. He faces gun fighters and brawlers. He has dealings with a prostitute and naively thinks she is a ""nice"" woman, and she turns out to be nice. His deputy forces people to pay protection money and he needs to deal with this. He discovers that the casino owner is rigging his tables. He needs to stop a bank robber who is racing out of town and has to deal with his deputy and the casino owner who try to ambush and kill him. All this and he can't shoot the dead man's fancy gun.",1299542400,7,1187,4.134199134199134
5926578,3,B00EKQOULU,"The 22 episodes in this series are much closer to fables than classic western yarns, each episode encapsulating a 'moral lesson' that is ultimately taught by the Dead Man's Gun at the cost of lives.  ""Twilight Zone Western"" may be a good way of describing it in the sense that there's a supernatural twist to the gun's effect on the characters, and the effect has a decidedly evil bend to it.  Episodes stand alone and appear to be in no chronological order (initially I thought that one episode may tail into the other).  Storytelling draws on classic western archetypes (the charlatan, the huckster, the wandering cowboy, etc.).  Story arc is as follows.  Usually a person of little consequence discovers the gun, then the gun brings their darkest desires to the surface, and lastly the manifestation of those desires does them in.  Throw in a couple pretty ladies in western dress, a typical PG-13 sex scene, and an occasional recognizable actor, and you have the first season.

Shot in British Columbia for (I'm guessing) Canadian television (they describe the west as the ""American West"" in the intro), it's a very different looking west.  It is not the dusty tumbleweed west of Clint Eastwood but rather a soggy, green, misty mountain northwest.  I also found it odd that the gun on the cover jacket is a Remington New Model Army revolver, while the gun in the actual series is a Smith & Wesson Second Model Schofield.

Episodes 1-7 are simplistic in their story telling and rough to watch.  Then Showtime shows up in the opening credits (intermittently) and things start to improve.  The last ten episodes are better, with subplots, richer sets, and an overall better use of screen time.  It's clear that the show benefitted from success.  Two or three episodes are worthy of 4 - 4.5 stars, but none of them exceed typical television series expectations.

Case and discs seem fine.  It is a standard width case and I don't think there was any real materials inside other than the discs.",1442620800,,1993,4.80058651026393
5926579,4,B00EKQOULU,follows a method story line but still good stories.two thumbs up,1416355200,2,64,4.909090909090909
5926580,4,B00EKQOULU,"The idea for this one is interesting. Canadian made, you've got to give our northern neighbors props for trying to be original.",1383177600,2,127,4.818181818181818
5926581,2,B00EKQOULU,"This series is weak primarily in the scripts and the basic premise that somehow an inanimate tool like a gun is in and of itself good or evil.  It is a series that should have never been made.  The acting is adequate for the time, but there is no way to over come the general weakness of the basic premise that all the stories are based upon.

Save your money and if you want early TV westerns, look to Wanted Dead or Alive, Have Gun will Travel, or Maverick, or any number of other TV westerns that are better than this one.",1378166400,,525,4.127450980392157
5926582,5,B00EKQOULU,"I purchased Deadman's Gun DVDs via the Internet about 6 years ago(from what I later found out was an on-line scam artist from China).  The quality was terrible and 85% pixelized.  Luckily, I was able to get a credit to my credit card account.  I recorded the entire 44 shows from the Starz/Encore Western Channel presentations and transferred them to DVD (quite a task).  Now . .  on to this (legal) edition.  When I saw these disks became available, I ordered them immediately, and am very pleased with it.  I shall keep my semi-legal copies, but will enjoy this, as well as the Second Season's disks.  The show is excellent (somewhat slow at times, but overall excellent acting and production).  Great",1377648000,2,703,4.743801652892562
5926583,5,B00EKQOULU,"Being a western buff from childhood and a regular cowboy action shooter with real guns ,I was thrilled to discover Dead Man's Gun.
This has certainly proved an unusual concept with only the gun as a connection to each episode and a variety of temporary owners who attach themselves to it and discover there are consequences that will change their lives -for the good or the bad results.
I was pleased that each episode is for the hour rather than thirty minutes so you can get involved with all characters.
I got excited to find ,too ,that a second season is available and now await it's arrival. Life is good. Having many gun books I am trying to ascertain what model the gun is. Friend and I are going for a Remington and a further search may reveal the truth.
Am interested to know as well how each episode can enfold with different presentations as well as suburb actors.
Part of the fun is identifying from their early movies and the movies that followed the making of this television western/mystery. Thanks heaps for entertaining myself and family.  Pete R.",1369872000,3,1064,4.62962962962963
5926584,5,B00EKQOULU,"This television series is one of the finer things that has been produced for entertainment. I have always wanted to own it and see it from the beginning but I never believed they'd release it! Thank goodness they have because at this price and the amount of stars that appear it's definitely worth it. The first episode has John Ritter while many other famous stars appear in the other episodes. I wish it had lasted for longer than 2 seasons, imagine 4! OMG",1364083200,4,458,4.530120481927711

5926587,5,B00EKQOULU,"I recently started to record this show, wish I had done it earlier, I loved it! It is like a western Twilight Zone/
The Dark Side! I recently watched the episode called: The Ripper, OMG, I was so intrigued to know who the killer really was, but the ending really surprised me! I plan on ordering seasons one/two, since most shows on the local networks suck so bad! Keep them coming Mr. Winkler, you have a hit on your hands!",1346630400,6,424,4.3125

8606440,3,B00EKQOULU,"The Three-Star Rating isn't for the Service or Film Quality, it's for the Incomplete DVD Collection. I Purchased Season Two a Year Ago and enjoyed the Series immensely. I Received 4 DVD's with a total of 16 Episodes.
Season One, only Two DVD's with only Eight Stories with Several Prized Episodes Excluded! I am so Disappointed since I waited for the (over) Price to come Down. This Late Nineties Series Filmed in Canada was a Good Saturday Night Viewing, but since it is no longer Aired in My Area, I am still missing Episodes that I would have liked to see!
Also, there isn't Close Caption on Season One like Season Two.
The Packaging, Video Quality, and Arrival were Fine.",1506384000,,675,4.633333333333334

I have been really pleased with the high quality of the product and have been watching a few episodes every evening.  Now if I could just get my hands on similar quality DVDs of China Beach and Northern Exposure, sigh

8606447,1,B00EKQOULU,"Alright, I only watched one episode - the first of Season 2 - and I can't imagine watching any more.
 I can say with incredible confidence that no one involved with this show is going to show up at the Academy Awards and/or Emmys.
 This is cheap garbage (IMHO).  I don't think they even sprung for actual cowboy clothes, just got some clothes from the Goodwill.  It's remarkable they got a horse - the best actor in the show.  His scenes were remarkably brief and his last scene has him running off - wish I'd taken the hint.
 The town is lifeless: i.e. who wants to hire a bunch of extras (or a writer or a director or a cinematographer for that matter, but I digress)?  The writing is bad, surreally bad, hocum bad, the sort of thing Rod Serling might have penned a week after he was dead.  Acting does it no favours, and for that matter they didn't even spring for a real cowboy hat.  That someone managed to point the camera in the right direction is surprising.
 Highly unrecommended unless you're studying all the ways not to make a tv show, not to act, not to direct.
Just so you can't say you wasn't warned.  Save your money, buy Maverick or The Rebel or any of a dozen other westersns.  God this was awful.",1460073600,,1215,4.3039647577092515
