70425,4,0783235674,"And now for something completely...different? Although he probably didn't think this would be his last film, Hitchcock certainly picked an interesting project to go out on. FAMILY PLOT is about two criminal couples who paths happen to cross in a surprising way. Perhaps more than any film in his corpus (that I've seen so far), FAMILY PLOT has a lighthearted tone while maintaining that edge that Hitchcock was so well-known for. The plot is a bit convoluted, as is to be expected, but the way in which it all comes together at the end was something to behold. I may have criticized his earlier films for their endings, but he seems to have come up with the perfect one here. Not to mention, the final sequence was as suspenseful as anything he did in his prime. Here, he collaborated again with writer Ernest Lehman, who he worked with on NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Perhaps that's why the films feel so similar, at least tonally. There's also a hilarious car chase sequence which fares much better than Cary Grant's in NXNW, although the process shots/rear projection was just as noticeable. However, he worked with a new composer this time: a pre-Star Wars/Superman John Williams. While I wouldn't count this as one of his best, or most memorable, scores, it certainly fit the quirky tone of the film. If I had to describe it, the score (and the film) is somewhere between Monty Python and Matlock, if that makes any sense. As with his last couple pictures, this one doesn't really have any star power behind it, although I did recognize Bruce Dern from his small role in MARNIE. They all give decent if unspectacular performances, and their characters were reasonably developed. Of course, I loved all of the Hitchcockian touches in the camera-work and editing. Despite being advanced in age, he still could put together a great set-piece. Overall, this isn't top-tier Hitchcock, but it certainly made for an entertaining and satisfying swansong to an incredible career.",1439683200,,1966,4.871641791044776

70450,4,0783235674,"Family Plot is a very different Hitchcock film and it was his last as well. His last 2 films were very good and while Frenzy was the better one, Family Plot has a lot to offer and is one of the more complex plots in a Hitchcock film. Frenzy was a very dark film with many graphic scenes throughout for Hitchcock, the production code was over and it let him be more shocking. Family Plot is a lot lighter in tone but it does have it's moments and it's overall atmosphere has a somewhat dark, surreal feel to it which gives it a unique edge. Family Plot delivers the humor as well and it might be the best humor Hitch had done since The Trouble With Harry. Family Plot is a fairly light, humorous film in many parts but oddly dark in other ways. Family Plot works well which has a very different plot for it's time and for Hitchcock with Barbara Haris who plays a false fortuneteller and is paid ten thousand dollars by a woman to find her son who went missing and was supposedly dead. Karen Black and William Devane play the villains who kidnap people for ransom and weren't the best villains Hitchcock had written but they were unique enough to be memorable. Family Plot is far better than critics and fans made it out to be at it's time of release and like many Hitchcock films, it gets better with age and takes more than your first impression to enjoy. Family Plot is unique, modern Hitchcock which despite it's flaws Family Plot is still Hitchcock and still good.",1431648000,,1467,4.377289377289378

Family Plot, his last and most comic thriller shows the master at or near his peak form, using facial expressions and reactions to carry the story.  Unfortunately, this particular blu ray transfer is extremely grainy, unlike the transfer I watched in Frenzy and The Man Who Knew Too Much (Stewart version), which is tragic given Hitchcock's visual style.  How a film from the seventies would look so poor against his VistaVision films of the fifties is beyond me.  One would think that the studio would have had more respect for the master when issuing this film on the latest digital format. This film needs restoration and a new blu ray transfer.  I give it five stars anyway because the art is more important that the film technique.",1423612800,4,863,4.688741721854305

70472,5,0783235674,"1976's FAMILY PLOT was Hitchcock's final film. In an interview with Franois Truffaut, Hitchcock stated that in today's films you no longer had to close the picture with a kiss. The audience no longer needed it or expected it. The romanticism of the motion picture was dead. If not for the performances of Barbara Harris as a phony psychic and Bruce Dern as her taxi driving-detective-boyfriend this film would have indeed lacked any hint of romanticism. In a complex plot that involves the location of a missing heir, the lives of Harris and Dern become intertwined with the villainous pair of this piece (William Devane and Karen Black). Ultimately the film seems more akin to ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS than to Hitchcock's previous films. Yet it seems our beloved Alfred Hitchcock left us with just a hint of romanticism via the wacky on-again-off-again relationship of Harris and Dern throughout this film. The last frame of the film, and Alfred Hitchcock's final cinematic shot of his long career, has Barbara Harris winking out at the audience. Many critics at the time were dismayed by that wink as being hackneyed and clichd but in retrospect I think Hitchcock was just saying that he had a good run and it had all been fun.

70498,4,0783235674,"There may be spoilers.  This was Alfred Hitchcock's 53rd and final film.  And it is the last one in the Blu ray ""Masterpiece Collection.""  It is the story of 2 couples whose chase of a dollar intersects in a typical Hitchcock way.

Blanche Tyler (Barbara Harris) is a phony psychic who is working Mrs. Rainbird (Cathleen Nesbitt), an elderly widow.  The old woman confesses that her now departed sister had a son who was whisked off into the unknown shortly after he was born.  The wealthy Rainbird family couldn't withstand the scandal of a bastard child being born into the family.  Mrs. Rainbird offers to pay Blanch $10 thousand if she can locate the now 40-something man who will inherit her fortune.

Blanche's cab driving boyfriend, George Lumley (Bruce Dern), agrees to do the legwork in an attempt to locate the man.  It turns out the man he seeks is a kidnapper and ransom seeking jeweler now known as Arthur Adamson (William Devane) who killed his foster parents in a fire and faked his own death.  Adamson's partner in crime is Fran (Karen Black).  Together they kidnap powerful people who are known to have expensive pieces of jewelry.

This Hitchcock film is a bit of a lark and quite whimsical at times.  Blanch, in particular, is a little wacky.  There are too many plot holes, instances of scene continuity, and in one case, a downright ridiculous scene (Blanche and George racing down the mountain with no brakes), to say that this is one of Hitchcock's best films.  Still it was mostly enjoyable and fun to watch.

This particular Blu ray disc is certainly not of the same video quality as others in the Hitchcock collection.  I didn't have a DVD to compare it to but I can't imagine it would be much different.  Everything you would expect on a Blu ray transfer is missing here.  Poor contrast, color, scene variations.  Not good.  It has a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  It comes with English SDH and Spanish subtitles.  The audio track is DTS-HD Master Audio mono and it is very clear and very good and features a John Williams score.

70516,4,0783235674,"""Family Plot"" is usually only remembered for one thing: being the very last movie that the great Alfred Hitchcock directed.

And that's a shame. While it's far from his greatest work, ""Family Plot"" is a charming little blend of suspense and comedy, with a quick wit and a clever, twisty little plot. But the greatest strength -- aside from the writing -- is the two pairs of sketchy lovers, one whom you root for and one whom you root vigorously against, working in parallel against each other.

Fake psychic Blanche (Barbara Harris) is given a difficult task by the elderly, wealthy Julia Rainbird (Cathleen Nesbitt) -- find Julia's long-lost, illegitimate nephew, so she can make him her heir. If Blanche and her boyfriend George (Bruce Dern) can find him, Miss Rainbird will pay them $10,000. The only problem is that they don't know the child's name, his location, who adopted him, or even if he's alive.

Well, he is. Having killed his adoptive parents and struck out on his own, he is now Arthur Adamson (William Devane), a successful jeweler. He and his girlfriend Fran (Karen Black) have a side business of kidnapping important and/or wealthy people, and demanding the ransom in valuable gems.

So while George and Blanche snatch up whatever clues they can find about the former Rainbird child, Arthur and Fran are setting out on their latest kidnapping plot: a bishop that Arthur has a personal dislike for. But the whole deal is complicated when the kidnappers believe that George and Blanche know what they're doing... and having murdered before, Arthur's not opposed to doing it again.

""Family Plot"" is one of those movies that is often overlooked in a director's ouvre -- not a defining work (""Psycho"") or a misunderstood classic (""Vertigo"") or even just a sleek attention-grabber (""North by Northwest""). This is a smaller movie, with a clever blend of comedy and mystery that aspires to be nothing more than what it is.

Hitchcock showed considerable skill in juggling the two plots even as he intertwined them together. On one hand, we have a fake psychic and an actor/taxi driver who are trying to find someone, snatching at little clues that thankfully lead to bigger ones. On the other, we have cold-blooded kidnappers/jewel thieves who believe that the other couple are on their trail. And they don't quite collide until the very end.

And Hitchcock's screwy sense of humor permeates even the more serious scenes (Blanche turns out to be the worst person to be stuck with in an out-of-control car). He also gets a lot of humor from the scenes of fake psychic stuff -- long before Shawn Spencer, we had Blanche seeking spirits in the kitchen and raving about trees. Even the kidnapping has an oddly humorous air -- the churchgoers watch in befuddlement as the unconscious bishop is dragged out of the cathedral.

All the actors do a pretty decent job here -- Harris and Dern have some nice sparky chemistry as a pair of lovers who use his detective skills and her manipulations to make a living. Devane is particularly good as the villain -- a charming psychopath who is skilled at getting others to do the dirty work for him, and smiles toothily as his eyes harden into flint.

""Family Plot"" is no ""Psycho,"" but it's a genuinely charming, fun little movie with that timeless Hitchcock touch -- and it leaves you a bit sad that this was the last one.",1393891200,2,3369,4.784853700516351

SYNOPSIS
A phony spiritualist (Harris) and her ill-tempered taxi-driving/out-of-work actor boyfriend aim for a 10K payday from an elderly millionairess.

70583,3,0783235674,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give a few thoughts on this Alfred Hitchcock movie...

Family Plot (1976) was director Alfred Hitchcock's final movie in his long and storied career.  This movie is serious at times, funny at times, and is generally seen as a black comedy.  One of the strong points of this movie is the musical score by John Williams.  It's not overpowering or bombastic, but rather just right for this '70s movie.  The acting is pretty good as well, particularly by Bruce Dern and Karen Black.  I like anything that Karen Black is in.  Bruce Dern had a small role in another Hitchcock movie, Marnie (1964).  Another strong point of this movie is the driving sequence which reminds me of two other Hitchcock movies, To Catch A Thief (1955) and North By Northwest (1959).  Overall, this movie doesn't have quite the ""Hitchcock feel"" of his earlier classic movies from the '30s, '40's, '50s, and early '60s.  It has sort of a mid-1970's TV movie feel to it.  The suspense factor isn't as powerful as his earlier movies, either.  Also, this movie seems to swing back and forth from serious to funny, back and forth, back and forth.

This is not a great movie, but it isn't bad, either.  It certainly does not rank among his best movies.  If you're new to Hitchcock's movies, if you've never seen one before, then I don't recommend watching Family Plot as your first Hitchcock movie.  Instead, I recommend hit movies such as Rebecca (1940), Shadow Of A Doubt (1943), Strangers On A Train (1951), Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958), North By Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960), The Birds (1963), Marnie (1964), and Frenzy (1972).

The Blu Ray's picture quality is quite grainy.  This Blu Ray is an example of how Blu Ray technology can actually accentuate already existing flaws in film, such as grain, scratches, etc.  The Blu Ray technology actually brings it to the surface more and makes it even more noticeable.  Overall, though, a decent Blu Ray and a decent movie.",1351987200,,2020,4.730659025787966
70584,3,0783235674,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.

Hitchcock's fifty-fourth, and what would unfortunately be his last, film (he was planning to direct another one when he died) is an intriguing movie that, as I guessed from the title, involves a tombstone...and that is all I will say regarding the synopsis of the picture. Brilliant decision by The Master to have the blonde woman not say a single word for about five-to-ten minutes when she is first on screen (reminds me of the first 15 minutes of The Good The Bad And The Ugly). The actors here do a good job, especially Mr. Devane and Ms. Black. Spot-on.

Good score by John Williams (who had recently written a certain theme for a certain movie about a great white shark which also catapaulted a certain director to fame).

I give the film three stars because of the frequent pairing of God's name with a mild profanity, thereby making it into a strong-and irreverent-profanity. ""Thou shalt not take the Name of the LORD thy God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain.""

Rated PG (mild-to-strong profanity throughout and some violence), but I'd give it a PG-13 for the frequent religious profanity.",1347321600,,1191,4.684210526315789

Bruce Dern is a wannabe actor who is currently driving cab, Barbara Harris is a phony psychic who is commissioned by a rich old lady to find her missing nephew.

Have I whet your appetite? Good! Hitchcock, as you know, was in the habit of making cameo appearances in all his films.

While this is by no means one of Hitchcock's greatest films ever I always felt  that it was among his most entertaining.  ""Family Plot"" was a departure from Hitchcock's standard fare for a couple of reasons.  First and foremost,  Hitchcock employs liberal doses of humor at various points throughout the film.  In addtion, the film is shot entirely in color which is a radical change from his previous theatrical releases and long running television series which were all filmed in glorious black and white.

""Family Plot"" revolves around a missing heir named Eddie Shoebridge now known as Arthur Adamson (William Devane) who turns out to be a rather notorious jewel thief.  Adamson is being sought after by the unlikely duo of would-be psychic Blanche Tyler (Barbara Harris) and her con-man boyfriend, a cab driver named George Lumley (Bruce Dern).

There are plenty of twists, turns and chuckles along the way to hold your interest.

""Family Plot"" features fine performances' by both Bruce Dern and  William Devane who is the absolute personification of evil in this film.

70627,5,0783235674,"Alfred Hitchock's Family Plot is not only his last movie, but highly enjoyable and the final chapter to a career full of brilliant filmmaking.

Barbara Harris shines as Blanche Tyler, a phony psychic who hits it big when one of her wealthy clients offers her $10,000 to track down her dead sister's adopted child who is the last remaining heir to the millions she will pass along. With the help of her boyfriend George (Bruce Dern), the two set out to find the nephew, going by the name Arthur Adamson (played brilliantly by William Devane), who has blossomed into a prominant jeweler, diamond thief, and murderer. Eventually Blanche and George track down Arthur and his girlfriend Fran (Karen Black), but with a chilling conclusion that is pure Hitchcock magic.

The film delights with its strong lead performances and witty dialogue. Although obviously not Hitchcock's best work, the film is solid, and keeps the viewer enthralled throughout.

The DVD contains a digitally remastered version of the film, with improved audio and video from its original state. The bonus features on the disc include an imformative 48-minute documentary entitled ""Plotting Family Plot,"" which chronicles the making of the film from pre-production to casting and filming. It also includes behind-the-scenes footage and stills as well as interviews with cast members Bruce Dern, Karen Black, William Devane, composer John Williams, and Hitch's daughter Pat Hitchcock O'Connell.

The audience no longer needed it or expected it. The romanticism of the motion picture was dead. If not for the performances of Barbara Harris as a phony psychic and Bruce Dern as her taxi driving-detective-boyfriend this film would have indeed lacked any hint of romanticism. In a complex plot that involves the location of a missing heir the lives of Harris and Dern become intertwined with the villains of the piece (William Devane and Karen Black).

Even Frenzy from 72 was a far superior film, actually one of my favorites.  But I must say I was highly disappointed in this pitiful film.  The only good part was the down the hill in the car scene.  And Barbara Harris is pretty entertaining lady.  Other than that, it was quite hideous.  ""Frenzy"" should have been his last flick for sure.  The question is, ""Is it a comedy or suspense?""

Aside from the opening title sequence, it does not feel at all like a Hitchcock film, but rather a run of the mill talking head detective mystery of the 70s, with rather bland/dry acting.  There is little of the Hitch suspense throughout, aside from a decent ending, it's fairly conventional and doesn't really scream Hitch at all - and in fact at times, feels more like a TV movie.

Frankly I'd say this is a rental only and I'd save the cash for any of the other 60 films Hitch made.  Transfer was a bit subpar as many of the blacks are washed out, which is odd since the film is not that old.",1157846400,3,796,4.245033112582782
70632,2,0783235674,"It's hard to believe that this is an Alfred Hitchcock film. If this is any indication, Hitch was beginning to lose it at the end of his life, and bowed out just in time.

Even Hitchcock couldn't save a bad script, which is 90% of the problem - his quality control seems to have been totally shot when he read it and thought it was a good idea. It's not so much the structure of the plot -- Hitch could have easily worked within its comedy/drama/mystery setup. Plot holes abound (for example, a jeweler's home with ZERO burglar alarms?), but these could have been tightened up with a few script revisions.

However, the dialogue and characterizations are simply atrocious. The dialogue has way too many profanities and little of the wit, style and real humor of most of Hitchcock's classic scripts. The two ""heroes"" are totally unappealing, and the acting doesn't help. Barbara Harris' Blanche is supposed to be ditzy and cute, but her performance makes her shrill and stupid. George, played by Bruce Dern, comes across as a boorish, vulgar jerk. It's hard for them to establish any romantic chemistry when they spend most of their time bickering.
On the other hand, William Devane and Karen Black, as the villains, come off as wooden and lifeless . My wife was rooting for all four of them to buy the farm at the end!

Hitchcock's direction is uninspired. There is one interesting shot (the graveyard sequence) but, at best, we've seen it before (the out of control car). The film looks like a tacky 70's TV movie or a poor episode of ""McMillan and Wife"", rather than a film from one of history's great directors. And the ending, to say the least, is anticlimactic and dumb.

This one is only for Hitchcock completists and those who want to see every one of his films, like my wife and me. But do NOT let this be your first Hitchcock movie, or you might never want to see another. Go for ""Psycho"", ""The Birds"", ""Strangers of a Train"" or ""North By Northwest"" instead.",1150934400,7,1966,4.592592592592593
70633,4,0783235674,"This isn't a scary Hitchcock. Perhaps it suffers a little from being undecided about exactly what its tone should be. Is it a serious drama, or is it a comedy? Is the action in earnest, or is it satiric, with that knowing wink of the eye at the end?

But even though it doesn't fit Hitchcock's or any usual mold, it is engaging. That might be because it was made a few decades ago, when movies still took their time. You see process here. It isn't just cut to the chase. You actually hear kidnappers Karen Black and William Devane arguing about which of them should empty their victim's chemical toilet. When two people walk down a staircase together, it happens in real time. And this doesn't slow down the story, the dread bugaboo of modern directors. To the contrary. It gives you time to be with the characters - to walk with them, get to know them, and identify with them. And these characters are worth getting to know.

The bonus materials on the DVD version of this film are also especially good. You get to see Hitchcock at work on this, his last, movie.",1147305600,7,1063,4.418367346938775
70634,5,0783235674,"This was not suppose to be the final film of Alfred Hitchcock.  He was in the planning stages of his next film when his poor health finally caught up with him and he gracefully retired.

But while ""Family Plot"" is not up to the level of his greatest works, it is a very entertaining and enjoyable romp that I have watched around a dozen times. And it is just as fun to watch the first time as the 12th time.

The plot is typical Hitchcock, two sets of couples who's lives are about to cross.  Yet the tone of the film is more wry comedy, rather than pure suspense. I will not give away all the details, suffice to say that this film has the feel of an old hand in charge.  Scenes flow with an ease that young directors can only dream of accomplishing.

For this DVD the print has been remastered and it looks great.  A vast improvement over the grainy prints we've been delt with over the years which made this film look more like a tv movie of the week.

Also included is a wonderful documentary detailing the experiences of this film complete with new interviews of Bruce Dern, William Devane, Composer John Williams, & Karen Black (who's career has mirrored Barbara Harris in some ways).  All three actors tell delightful stories about the making of the film and it comes as no shock that the best Hitchcock impression comes from Karen Black. Sadly, Barbara Harris is missing along with Katherine Helmond (of ""Soap"" & ""Who's the Boss"" fame), she has only one scene where she speaks, but she does deliver the most memorable visual of the film, the kicking over of the tombstone.

Other DVD extras include storyboards for the car/mountain scene, production photos, & trailers that promoted the film.

This is a very neat, very complete package for the DVD presentation of this film and I hope that the others in this series of ""Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece"" Collection live up to the standard set with ""Family Plot"".

Tidbits:

- Hitchcock ""appears"" much later in the film (about 45 minutes in) that was typical for him.  After ""Notorious"", Hitch usually appeared quite early in films (like during the opening credits for ""North by Northwest"") because he found out that audiences sometimes missed plot points while waiting for him to appear.

- The movie ""Dazed and Confused"", which is set in Texas in 1976, has ""Family Plot"" on the drive-in movie marquee seen early in the film.

- The kidnap victim seen early in the film (and the subject of an extended interview by the FBI) is none other than Nicholas Colasanto, who later played ""Coach"" in the NBC comedy series ""Cheers"".

- One nice side product of the improved print of the film is that it's quite clear that in the first ""kitchen"" scene with Karen Black (after they leave Mr. Colosanto at the golf course) that she is wearing nothing underneath her quite tight sweater.",1146441600,7,2828,4.612774451097804

70647,5,0783235674,"By 1976, Alfred itchcock, I think, knew his days were getting numbered. He was overweight, was getting old and had a pacemaker implanted. Despite these health issues, he wanted to make one last film before he died. Fast forward a few months later. Hitchcock's last film, ""Family Plot"", was released. While not as great as ""Pyscho"" or ""Vertigo"", it still manages to hold its own against Hitchcock's best work.

The lot of this film is, as may reviewers say, a very convoluted one. One deals with a faux pyschic (Barbara Harris) and her boyfriend (Bruce Dern) conning an old lady of her millions by pretendign to find her nephew (William Devane). Devane is a jeweler with a criminal edge, as he and his girlfriend (Karen Black) have abducted a wealthy Greek businessman and are holding him for ransom. Somehow, the lives of these four people collide and it results in one of Hitchcock's best movies. The ending is a great farewell to the Master Of Suspense.

The extras on the dvd are extraordnary, probably the best on any Hitchcock dvd. This is a must have for any Hitchcock fan.",1128038400,4,1079,4.703703703703703

The screenplay was seamless, the characterizations were perfectly there, the idea of good and evil misunderstanding each other and being at cross-purposes was so good and well done it almost seemed subtle.  I did not find it particularly funny, but it was light and almost lighthearted.  I've seen it several times, and just again 15 minutes ago. I love it.  Maybe next time I'll remember what happens before I watch it, though I always remember outstanding scenes.",1125187200,4,589,4.959183673469388

From the fake psychic to the greedy boyfriend to the scariest car ride I've ever seen (I was screaming at the top of my lungs as the main characters' car careened down the winding road with no brakes), this movie is a classic. Also loved the cameo of Hitchcock at the police station.

Mr. Hitchcock went out in style!",1123200000,3,414,4.421052631578948
70650,5,0783235674,"Alfred Hitchcock was a grand tease and the more he teased the more his audiences loved it.  The operative word was suspense and The Master had a genius for milking the action to maximum effect, keeping his faithful audience on the edge of its collective seat.

Hitchcock bowed out on an interesting note by concluding his brilliant career with ""Family Plot"" in 1976.  He was mightily assisted in his efforts by one of Hollywood's most skilled screenplay authors, Ernest Lehman.  It was the second time they had teamed up, the earlier effort being one of Hitchcock's most successful films, the 1958 classic ""North by Northwest"" starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint and James Mason.

In ""Family Plot"" Hitchcock's grand tease was built around a variation of the theme that helped make ""Vertigo"" perhaps the director's finest effort.  That impressive 1957 release was structured around a bogus effort on the part of mastermind criminal Gavin Elster, played by Tom Helmore, to convince retired policeman James Stewart that his putative wife, played by Kim Novak, was under the possessive influence of prominent nineteenth century San Franciscan Carlotta Valdes.  Stewart is led on a bogus chase around San Francisco that includes a phony suicide attempt as Novak jumps into San Francisco Bay.

Hitchcock, a film genius who knew how to make the most of a good theme, used this basic concept from ""Vertigo"" in the basic plot of ""Family Plot"" with one essential difference - this time the con artist was not seeking a foolproof way to kill his real wife by having a fall guy reduced to useful fodder in a criminal enterprise.  On this occasion Barbara Harris played the role of a fake psychic who, upon receiving valuable information during a ""reading"" concerning a relative that a wealthy older woman, played by Cathleen Nesbitt, would like to leave with her large inheritance.

Bruce Dern, a cab driver who hopes to eventually catch a break in his acting career, has nothing but scorn for Harris's sance performances, but is enticed along on a journey to find the prospective heir when it is revealed that the wealthy older woman Nesbitt will provide them with $10,000 for a successful effort.  The story then spins into a two-part focus in which William Devane, who has changed his name and gained his freedom by killing his adopted parents, has embraced a life as a jeweler moonlighting as a kidnapper, and who receives expensive jewels as payment from his victims.  He also has a girlfriend, Karen Black, who is a reluctantly partner like Dern.  She goes along with the kidnappings but hates to even consider the idea of killing anyone, an element that Devane as a pragmatic and ruthless opportunist is willing to resort to in fulfilling his objective to become a wealthy man.

The ingenious story spins into dual efforts where Devane knows that the persistent pair of Harris and Dern is pursuing him, but he is in the dark as to the reason.  He believes that they are aware of his criminal activities.

Hitchcock teases viewers into wondering with increasing anticipation what will happen when the two parties ultimately meet.  He places plenty of the familiar Hitchcock obstacles and dodges in the road during the interim.

""Family Plot"" is the polished effort of one of Hollywood's most imaginative directors pooling forces with one of the industry's most skilled scriptwriters.  Hitchcock and Lehman prepare a delicious stew for audiences to savor as the last feast of a master of film.",1121558400,22,3487,4.940068493150685
70651,4,0783235674,"Surprised?  I am a fan of Hitch's lesser-known films, including ""Rope"", ""Rebecca"", and ""Strangers on a Train"".  Yes, they were all great movies, but not the first when you think of Alfred Hitchcock, certainly.

It's really not as bad as you might think ~ Barbara Harris is Blanche, an intentional floozy who is also ""psychic"".  With the help of her supernatural guide Henry, she finds longlost relatives and ""contacts"" people who have crossed over to the other side, for a price of course.  Bruce Dern (who I despised in ""The Cowboys"") is great as her henpecked boyfriend, who drives a taxi when he isn't out doing Blanche's dirty work for her, usually under the guise of a private detective or a lawyer.  This time around Blanche is hired to find a longlost nephew to a wealthy woman, who is dying and wishes to leave her vast fortune to him.  The nephew turns out to be cunning and smarmy jewel thief William Devane, who with nervous cohort Karen Black, kidnaps wealthy men and has their ransoms paid in diamonds.  Nobody here is entirely innocent, and nothing is quite what it seems.  This is a slightly complicated plot, but is relatively easy to follow.  The cast is solid, the storyline is intriguing, and there is suspense and humor in all the right places.

Seriously, if you ever come across this movie to rent or buy for cheap...check it out.  Granted, its not quite on par with Hitchcock classics like ""Psycho"" or ""The Birds""...but it is worth watching.",1118620800,2,1464,4.698039215686275

70653,5,0783235674,"This nice psychic thriller must have been done by a complete pervert, and everyone knows of course Alfred Hitchcock was THE perfect pervert. Such a plot only happens in the USA, not to speak of California of course. No proper records of births and deaths. One can navigate from one identity to the next in a jiffy. But then imagine two sisters. The younger one gets pregnant out of wedlock. The family is a big name on the local urban stage. So the child had to disappear. It is adopted into anonymity by the chauffeur of the family. But no luck the kid with his local friend, and accomplice, set the house on fire, killing the two adoptive parents, and the child, but no one finds the body, but who cares? So he is considered dead though never officially recorded as such. He gets a new life under another name and becomes, who knows how but we can imagine, a rich jeweler. But to be rich is not enough. He has to get richer but by dangerous and exciting ways. So he becomes a professional abductor of rich people that he gives them back against big diamonds. A big professional first and then the bishop of the local city, Los Angeles probably, at least that's all we can see. The main character though is a psychic who is dealing with the older sister of before  who is going to die and she wants to clean up her plate, and her soul not to speak of her mind, before going into the ground. So she is managed into revealing her secret and the son of her sister has to be found. And the surprises are going to start there. Good luck and enjoy the rest of the film. Of course there will be a lot more innuendo, qui pro quo, salmagundi and baloney. And the prize will be so much more than the initial payment envisaged for finding a lost heir because of the two criminals and the latest two diamonds. Why did Alfred Hitchcock bother to produce such an entertaining little thriller at the end of his life? Because there is a tremendous amount of humor, like the rodeo or chase or crazy gig on the winding road in the mountains over Los Angeles, and they will manage to survive their dead brakes and the killing mechanic will end up in flames in the scenery. And the scenery is really beautiful. Humor in how a priest gets a rendezvous with his girl friend up in the mountains by taking four kids on a hike up there. And the poor taxi-driver cum private-eye cum chauffeur of the psychic cum savior of her cum catcher of the criminals is so funny in his multiple unpaid professions and his multiple perambulating over-exploitations by his own girl friend. And so many other funny little situations. But the film has another charm: it is the social irony and light sarcasm that Hitchcock aims at this hypocritical society of California and Los Angeles. Alfred Hitchcock was settling some accounts then with his adoptive country, without burning the house to kill the adoptive parents: they did not deserve that much. And of course he managed to get us lost and give us a complete vertigo with his favorite tricks of staircases going up and down, right and left, to and fro, front and back and even catty-corner and all around. It is of course a metaphor of the society he is depicting but it is also a representation of his inside and crooked mind. Stairs are an obsession in  that man and he is trying to entangle us into them to enslave us to their steps, to his steps, and we just can follow, enjoying each step and all the mezzanines between the flights, and fly we do, quite a lot indeed, with the perverted wings of that psycho psychic.

The audience no longer needed it or expected it. The romanticism of the motion picture was dead. If not for the performances of Barbara Harris as a phony psychic and Bruce Dern as her taxi driving-detective-boyfriend this film would have indeed lacked any hint of romanticism.

70679,4,0783235674,"This was Alfred Hitchcock's final film, and he was already in his late seventies when he made it. I think that at this point in his career, after fifty years of movie-making, he KNEW he no longer had to prove himself; his place was already set in history. Therefore, instead of making a film along the lines of Psycho, Vertigo, or Rear Window, he made a fun, lighter film along the lines of To Catch A Theif or The Lady Vanishes. The script of Family Plot was written by the same guy who wrote North By Northwest, which means there is a lot of clever, witty dialogue. The California locations are also a typical Hitchcock touch, and the fun car chase scene in the California hills is a classic. People expecting a SUSPENSE film will be disappointed, but I always felt that the ""Master of Suspense"" was a misleading title for Hitchcock, because his films are about much more than just suspense. Even so, Family Plot is not a masterpiece, but a treat for Hitchcock buffs.

70680,3,0783235674,"As a child growing up I was consumed with a passion for film, which has continued to this day and one of my all time favorite directors of film is Alfred Hitchcock.
The film Family Plot came was released in 1976 and for a young teenager growing up in Southern California, this was my first and only opportunity to see a Hitchcock film in it's initial release.
The plot in this film is sort of silly in spots, it concerns a phony psychic who while working as a medium is hired to find a missing heir to her family's fortune. The only problem is that the missing heir is now a jewel thief who faked his own death years ago and wants no part of being located once again.
Bruce Dern plays a cabbie who is also a boyfriend to the psychic, played by Barbara Harris, the jewel thief is played by William Devane, and Karen Black plays his accomplice/love interest.
Mr Hitchcock on this film employed many of the people who had made his subsequent films so successful including screenwriter Ernest Lehman, who penned North By Northwest amongst others for Hitch, Edith Head multi Academy Award winning costume designer, as well as Henry Bumstead who handled the fabulous set designs.
This DVD release is quite impressive for one of the least impressive films of Alfred Hitchcock, but the features make this a worthy addition to your collection nonetheless.
The disc is released in anamorphically enhanced widescreen which is presented in it's original aspect ratio of 1:85.1 and looks vastly superior to the old LaserDisc and VHS copies of this film that I have viewed over the years.
The soundtrack is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 mono and the composer is John Williams in a subdued but effective score.

There all also the standard addition of trailers two to be exact, as well as production photos and some behind the scenes photos as well.
Overall Alfred Hitchcocks 54th and final film is not something that film historians will be citing as a milestone in his career, however I think that anyone who is a film collector or Hitchock fan should add this to their DVD collection.

70681,4,0783235674,"FAMILY PLOT has earned a place in cinematic history simply because it turned out to be Alfred Hitchcock's last production.  While the film was a financial success, like most Hitchcock pictures, it got mixed reviews because many found it too comic in tone and not ""suspenseful"" enough to have been directed by the Master.  It is true that FAMILY PLOT is far from being one of Hitchcock's best films, and it is not the ""great"" movie one might have expected from this director after the spine-chilling and sordid FRENZY, FAMILY PLOT's immediate predecessor - it is not an ambitious production.  However, although the tone of the film is the lightest and funniest of any Hitchcock movie since THE LADY VANISHES in 1939, this does not mean that FAMILY PLOT is free of some disturbing undercurrents which linger in the mind and demand repeated viewings.  Like all the characters in the movie, FAMILY PLOT is not what it seems to be.  On the surface, we have a light, comic thriller involving a psychic (Blanche/Barbara Harris) and her cabbie/actor boyfriend, Lumley (Bruce Dern) who have been hired by a rich old woman to find her missing nephew, the heir to a huge fortune.  The missing nephew turns out to be the thouroughly repellent Arthur Anderson (William Devane), a sociopath who, with the help of his girlfriend Fran (Karen Black), kidnaps important people and holds them for ransom.  But Anderson is not just a thief - he is also a killer.  When he realizes Blanche and Lumley are trying to find out information about him, and that they know of his hidden identity (which I won't reveal here), he assumes that they are undercover agents looking to expose him as a kidnapper.  Of course, Blanche and Lumley know nothing about this, and thus put themselves in great danger without realizing it.  The plot of this film is very complex and I won't say any more about it for those of you who haven't seen it.  The comic tone of the film is belied by some exteremely dark moral undercurrents.  The dominant characters, Blanche and Anderson, are very similar to one another although in dramatic terms one is the heroine and the other the villain, and this put us in an uneasy relationship with all the people in the film.  Anderson is a liar, a thief, and a con artist.  Blanche (a fake psychic who bilks lonely old women out of their money) is also a liar, a thief (she essentially steals from the women she ""consults"" by faking her ""powers"") and a con artist motivated by greed.  Both heroine and villain also dominate their lovers - Blanche uses her sexual hold over the rather dumb (but loving) Lumley to get him to adopt all sorts of identities to further their plans, and Anderson does the exact same thing to Fran, forcing her to assume a false appearance in the course of furthering his kidnappings.  Although one couple is labelled as ""good"" and the other as ""bad"", morally, they are not so far apart from one another.  Indeed, everyone in the film has manipulated and lied to others to achieve none-too-pleasant ends.  Even old Julia Rainbird, whose guilt over ostracizing her dead sister and the girl's illegitimate child sets the story in motion, has used and deceived others for her own selfish goals.  The vision of humanity in this film is essentially dark - people are monsters of greed and deceit, willing to use anyone and everyone, and even risking the lives of those they love in the process.  This makes the film's undeniable humor even more disturbing - what are we really laughing at when we laugh at these sad and confused people?  The performances by the four principals are top-notch, especially by Harris as the ditzy ""psychic"" who isn't the dumb blonde she appears to be, and by Devane as the evil killer who presents himself as a respectable businessman.  Although there are no spectacular Hitchcockian ""set-pieces"", a scene where Blanche and Lumley are trapped in a speeding car is scary and funny at the same time, and the movie is filled with little Hitchcock touches that are simultaneously amusing and fetishistic (as when Karen Black idly throws the blonde wig she uses to disguise herself into a bin in the refrigerator - I don't know why, but this struck me as uproariously funny in context).  This is a greatly underrated film which may not be the ""masterpiece"" people were hoping for from Hitch, but I think that reviewers have done this movie a disservice by comparing it to earlier films and not judging it on its own, considerable, merits.  Hitchcock always gave us what we didn't expect, and FAMILY PLOT is no exception.",976579200,28,4559,4.7272727272727275

A comedy about thieves & con artists, two parallel stories that intersect

7790667,5,0783235674,"The cover of this film reveals that Alfred Hitchcock directed this film when he was 76-years-old. I do not know why this information is important; perhaps I should add that I watched it when I was 81 years old. We do not see Hitchcock in this film as we usually do, only the shadow of his face. Is this why we are told his age? The film is a comedy, a good one, worth seeing.
There are two plots that converge. The first is about a couple. She fakes being a psychic. She is told by one of her customers that if she could find the child of her now dead sister who was given up for adoption, she, a very rich lady, would give the psychic $10,000. The psychic sends her boyfriend in search for the now some 40-year-old missing adopted boy. He finds that the boy allegedly died in a fire with his adopting parents, but this is not true.
The second plot concerns a couple who steal diamonds from very rich people. During the search for the missing heir, a man who he speaks to thinks the boyfriend is questioning him because the boyfriend suspects that the man he is speaking to set the fire that murdered the adopting parents, which he did. He and the man he is working with decide that their best act now would be to kill the boyfriend and the psychic.",1506297600,3,1249,4.2301255230125525
