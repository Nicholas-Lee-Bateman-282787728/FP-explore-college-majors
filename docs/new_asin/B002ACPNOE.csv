8359330,5,B002ACPNOE,"Informative must-have DVD for anyone considering a leap into a business venture, or for those who just have questions or concerns about funding!  Video is well presented and displays information and explanations in an easy to understand format.  It touched on more than one aspect concerning funding that I had not considered, and supplied to me many answers for which I had questions.  There were other funding avenues explained that I was not aware of and I was very thankful that this video brought them to light.  Thanks to the informative DVD,  I was able to better pick which choices were right for me as I gained a fuller understanding of the process.  If you are looking for a clear spoken guide on how to get funding for a business or project, this is an excellent source that will answer many questions and save you footwork.  Highly recommended to all for the informative nature, and really appreciated that it was written by someone who knew the subject through experience and hard work.",1313971200,3,999,4.773255813953488

Alicia funded nine companies, and thus knows exactly what to do and what to avoid when trying to become an entrepreneur.

The video explains what type of investor you should choose, how to get funding, how to balance income, assets, and outgoing money, and also why companies die.

I think this video is a must for everyone who wants to start his or her own business, even if you do not think that your idea might be worth a million dollar (you might be pleasantly surprised)!",1289692800,5,764,5.626086956521739
