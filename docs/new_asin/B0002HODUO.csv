8028071,3,B0002HODUO,This DVD was not a very good copy.  Therefore I was very disappointed in this purchase and would not recommend for others.,1327104000,,122,4.545454545454546
8028072,1,B0002HODUO,"While this compilation could have had some potential, the production quality of this DVD is poor at best. Very sloppily put together, the chapter breaks do not even match up with the program beginnings and endings. Just a cheaply made product slapped together that could have been so much better.",1293753600,,296,4.94
8028073,4,B0002HODUO,"Over three hours of classic Christmas-themed entertainment from the golden age of television.  Feeling a bit disillusioned about the lack of Christmas magic?  Throw this DVD in the player and go back to a more innocent time when laughs seemed more genuine and the talent on TV was undeniable.

Amongst the treasures you'll enjoy here is the ""Freddy and the Yuletide Doll"" special from THE RED SKELTON SHOW.  So popular that it was actually brought back for an encore performance the following year, this musical episode sees Skelton's beloved ""Freddy the Freeloader"" character join forces with a Raggedy Ann doll that comes to life on Christmas Eve, played by Cara Williams.

Two great episodes from THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES - ""Home for Christmas"" sees the Clampetts return to the Ozarks for a special reunion with their kinfolk...but not before they board a plane for their first ever experience of flying the friendly skies!  In ""Christmas at the Clampetts"", Mr. Drysdale buys the family a yacht for Christmas and parks it in their driveway, but the family mistakenly believes that there has been a major flood sometime during the night!

There are also two episodes apiece from THE ADVENTURES OF OZZIE AND HARRIET and THE JACK BENNY SHOW.  These episodes (plus countless more) are also available in much the same quality in Mill Creek's four-disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Holiday-TV-Classics/dp/B00198PJNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Holiday TV Classics</a>&nbsp;set.",1288224000,6,1518,5.62719298245614
8028074,5,B0002HODUO,These nostalgic Christmas episodes made me remember why I have always liked Christmas so much. The ads really bring home how times have changed or in some instances stayed the same.,1286496000,5,181,4.870967741935484

8028076,5,B0002HODUO,This is a Christmas favorite for me. It is one of several I dig out every years and play.  We don't seem to have any music on TV any more so these will have to do and it brings back fond memories.,1258156800,2,196,3.6666666666666665
