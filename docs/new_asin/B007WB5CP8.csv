THE OPERAS ARE:

AIDA by Verdi (4.4 stars)  1992
Maria Chiara is Aida. Kristjn Jhannsson is Radams. Dolora Zajick is Amneris. Nello Santi conducts the Orchestra of the Arena di Verona. This is a visual extravaganza on a giant outdoor stage. The singing and acting are mostly excellent.

8522442,3,B007WB5CP8,"In this set, you get three productions, only two of which are really worth seeing. CARMEN and TOSCA are both entertaining, impressively grand productions, bursting with a vitality and energy that mostly compensates for their shortcomings, but this AIDA is a creaky, dull, dated affair.",1359590400,,285,5.355555555555555
