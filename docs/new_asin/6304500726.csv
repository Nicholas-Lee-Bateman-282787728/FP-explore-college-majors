892066,3,6304500726,"I can't say this movie has the 'rewatchability' of the other great classic Disney films. There are a few catchey things, like that little latin phrase on the back of the ring, and the cut away special effects where they gradually glued more and more hair on him was semi-believable.

I would get this, but unfortunately I removed the VHS player from my entertainment system last year. Peccato.

If you want to research the Italian version, it's alternately titled ""Quello strano cane... di papa`"" (I don't think there was ever a HV release either DVD or VHS, but RAI TV in italy, as well as TelePace (American Free To Air satellite) may run it one of these days!",1110585600,,662,4.601694915254237

892068,4,6304500726,"I agree that these entertaining movies for children are great. However, when one of these movies comes out everyone wants to own an Old English Sheepdog. This is a HIGH maintenence breed, stubborn and NEED a great deal of training. They can be head strong and because they are a herding breed are NOT good around very young children. They view the children as sheep that are to be herded and contained. Children do get knocked down and hurt. Before you entertain the thought of getting one of these dogs reseach the breed and make sure you know what you are getting into as many a cute puppy are given up to rescue groups because they nip and require a tremendous amount of work on the owners part. The little 10 week old puppy can grow to weigh well over 100 lbs. I work with an Old English Sheepdog Rescue and the last thing we need is more abandoned sheepdogs and puppy mill puppies.

892272,2,6304500726,"Oh dear, I wish there was something nice I could say about this belated sequel to the 1959 classic.  Whether or not you will like this movie depends entirely on how well you like and/or appreciate the cast involved.  It features a lot of stock actors over utilized in television and infrequently in feature films.  Actors who depend on playing the same character no matter what the project.  The names may change but Keenan Wynn blusters as the same villain he's played in countless films.  The same goes for Dean Jones as Dean Jones supposedly playing the adult version of Wilby Daniels who's trying to run for the position of District Attorney (but it's just Dean Jones doing what he always does).  No surprise, Vic Tayback is typecast as a thug in organized crime.  Warren Berlinger and Richard Bakalyan play crooks.  Tim Conway stumbles and bumbles as the owner of the dog Wilby keeps changing into.  He's involved in a running `gag' trying to get the dog to speak or sing to win a bet (it wasn't humorous the first time they used this bit so doing it repeatedly didn't help).  Dick Van Patten lurks while making funny faces.  Jo Anne Worley was not a film actress, her claim to semi-fame was Laugh-In.  Pat McCormick has a bit part as a bartender.  Suzanne Pleshette was not used to great advantage.  It was nice though to see Hans Conried wander through as a professor and expert on the ring in question.

Billed as ""light satire of American politics,"" this comedy suffers from repetitious jokes and silly setups to help promote the particular humor of the actor involved.  It also features a scene of a neighbor taking a potshot at the dog/Wilby with a shotgun.....within the city limits, in a neighborhood, no thought to who might get hit.  This is never a funny joke.

There's the obligatory chase sequence and in utter desperation, there's also a food fight with pies.  (I'm still trying to get over Piglet (John Fiedler) trying to kill Wilby in the dog pound.)",1422748800,,1971,4.660869565217391

892472,4,6304500726,"1976's THE SHAGGY D.A. was Disney's long-awaited follow-up to their beloved comedy favourite ""The Shaggy Dog"", which had in fact been the highest-grossing film released in 1959.  The biggest mystery is why it took almost 17 years for Disney execs to greenlight the further adventures of Wilby Daniels.

We follow the now-adult Wilby (Dean Jones) as he once again falls prey to the cursed Borgia ring and turns into a sheepdog - but this time, the stakes are much higher.  City lawyer Wilby is campaigning for the position of District Attorney against corrupt ""Honest John"" Slade (Disney favourite Keenan Wynn), who canoodles with criminals and profits from a team of burglars who recently terrorised the Daniels house. Those same crooks pilfer the Borgia ring from the museum where it has lain dormant since the events of the original ""Shaggy Dog"".

Realising that the ring will be near-impossible to dispose of, they sell it to Tim (Tim Conway), an unsuspecting icecream truck driver who plans to give it to his girlfriend, co-worker and roller-derby champ Katrinka Muggelberg (Jo Anne Worley).  It doesn't take long until the magical words written on the ring are recited and Wilby trades places with Tim's sheepdog Elwood - and once Slade discovers the Borgia curse and it's link to Wilby, the Daniels family must race against time to track the ring down before Wilby's sheepdog persona becomes permanent!

This is a typical Disney comedy from the 1970s, packed with all the ingredients which became standard features for most of the live-action product for the studio during this period.  The emphasis is heavily geared toward slapstick, silly car chases and pratfalls.  When the Borgia ring is believed to have accidentally fallen into the mixture for a batch of cherry pies, cue the obligatory pie-fight scene.  It's all very charming and entertaining, but the Disney films of the 70's, sadly, do all tend to blur together through their reliance on cartoonish antics rather than solid storytelling, which marked most of the live-action product released during Walt Disney's lifetime.

The casting is fine.  Reuniting for their 3rd and final Disney pairing (following ""The Ugly Dachshund"" and ""Blackbeard's Ghost""), Dean Jones and Suzanne Pleshette play Wilby and his wife Betty; though one wishes that Pleshette had a slightly larger, less reactive role to fill within the story - in the last portion she barely even features.  While the Disney traditionalist in me wanted to see Tommy Kirk return as Wilby, I can understand why long-standing Disney comedy leading man Dean Jones took over the part.  Tim Conway and Jo Anne Worley are fun in their supporting roles.",1352764800,,2671,5.08466819221968
892473,5,6304500726,"Dean Jones takes over Tommy Kirk's role of Wilby Daniels, the average guy turned English Sheepdog as the victim of a curse on an old Borgia ring. We catch up with Wilby as a lawyer and family man in 1976, married to Betty (Suzanne Pleshette) and father of young son Brian (Shane Sinutko). The family comes home one day to discover their house has been robbed, the latest target in a series of robberies plaguing their town. At the source of it is a crime boss(Vic Tayback) and a crooked district attorney (Keenan Wynn). Wilby becomes determined to reverse the tide of crime in his fair city by becoming the new district attorney, but running against D.A. Slade proves to be a dangerous undertaking with his criminal ties, and it only gets more complicated when Wilby's old problem comes back. After some crooks steal the Borgia ring and read the inscription on the back, Wilby starts turning into a dog again for the first time since he was a teenager, and it is severely affecting his political campaign! As Wilby's war against crime and bid for district office get more intense, not to mention his dog-time difficulties, he enlists the aid of not only his family, but also a local ice-cream salesman named Tim (Tim Conway) who is the owner of the dog Wilby is currently merging with. With pie fights, late night dog pound escapes, and faceoffs with the criminal underworld, not to mention more great Disney stars like Hans Conried, Richard Bakalyan, Jo Ann Worley, and Dick Van Patten, among others, this is definitely a Disney film not to be missed. Keenan Wynn is as wonderfully nasty as ever, and Dean Jones is his charmingly frustrated Disney-self too. Suzanne Pleshette is a perfect comedic match for Jones, and little Shane as Wilby's son does an excellent job of filling the void left by Kevin Corcoran's Moochie character (Wilby's little brother). For my money, this is among Disney's best family comedies. Love the characters, love the humor, and I even adore the opening song, sung by Dean Jones!

Disney takes some heat for its often silly comedies of the 1970's, but this is definitely one of the best and is lots of fun. It's a wacky premise, but just like with the original 1959 film (The Shaggy Dog), the outstanding cast of Disney legends sells it beautifully, and the film maintains that classic Disney feel that not all the 70's era Disney films achieve. There's plenty of fun to be had here if you can just sit back for a clean, old-fashioned comedy with plenty of lighthearted fantasy too (love how the regular dogs are able to talk to Wilby in this one). The DVD is actually a pretty good release from Disney, as not only is it enhanced widescreen with beautiful picture and sound, but it also has bonus features! Yes, bonus features! And darn good ones, too! Though, it does lack any theatrical trailers, we actually get a commentary here. The commentary is with actors Tim Conway, Jo Ann Worley, and Dick Van Patten. It's too bad they couldn't get any of the leads in for this one, though Tim's role was pretty big and all these stars get a decent amount of screen time. It's nice to hear their memories from working with Disney, even the less appealing ones like the unpleasantness of doing a pie fight scene, ha. The only other shame about this commentary is that it is not done together, but separately and then edited together. Still, it is a welcome and appreciated inclusion on this disc, as are the two featurettes, which are an interview with the make-up artist on the film (which has some great make-up effects) and an interview with Dick Van Patten and Tim Conway. This is definitely a great one to have in your collection, and I recommend getting the original as well (or, you can get the double feature DVD release). They are unquestionably two of my favorite Disney comedies. And, if you're a total Shaggy Dog nut, you also may want to seek out the 80's TV movie, ""The Return of the Shaggy Dog"". Despite taking place in the 80's, it is actually set in-between ""The Shaggy Dog"" and ""The Shaggy D.A."" and focuses on Wilby's wedding to Betty (it also includes a full-grown Moochie, though none of the actors are the originals, ha). You'll have to try to find it online somewhere though. It has never had an official release. And, if you're a merchandise collector like myself, you probably won't find anything besides posters and comics from ""The Shaggy D.A."", however, I did discover a few years ago that there ARE ceramic sculptures from the first film in existence. I have one of Wilby as a sheepdog in pajamas, and it's pretty neat. I believe there are at least 2 other versions. Anyway, that's enough of my Disney fanboy babbling. Pick up these movies! They're awesome! Oh, but I can't really recommend the Tim Allen version. I'll have to get to reviewing that one sometime... It might not be as bad as I remembered, and it's closer to a remake of Shaggy D.A. than Shaggy Dog, though, in truth, it's totally its own thing. There was a TV remake of The Shaggy Dog in the 90's though, and that one is okay. Nearly forgot about that one.",1339545600,,5074,4.619047619047619

892477,3,6304500726,"This movie was a sequel to the clever 1959 movie ""The Shaggy Dog.""  That movie was charming and clever, packing a lot of humor and numerous subplots into a relatively short film.  Unfortunately, this film is a pale shadow of the earlier film.  The jokes are often forced and a viewer can easily see that the special effects used to make the dogs talk are film loops of dogs chewing.  I recommend this film only for people who are loyal Disney fans or fans of the numerous well-known actors in this film.

Wilby Daniels (Tommy Kirk) encountered a Borgia ring in the 1959 movie ""The Shaggy Dog.""  His transmutation into a sheep dog stopped at the end of the movie and the ring was put into safe keeping.  Seventeen years later Wilby Daniels, now played by Disney regular Dean Jones, is an attorney living in a town full of corruption, lead by district attorney ""Honest"" John Slade, played by another Disney regular, Keenan Wynn.  After being a victim of the rampant crime in Medfield, Wilby decides it is time to challenge Slade for the position of district attorney.

Unfortunately for Daniels, the Borgia ring has resurfaced and has already worked wonders for his hair; and his nose; and his tail!  In a reprise of the original movie, we see Wilby turn into a sheepdog at the worst possible times.  Wilby also manages to vex Tim Conway, who keeps trying to win a bet that his sheepdog Elwood can talk.

The rest of the movie is routinely scripted with slapstick jokes and scenes that are variations of similar jokes and themes from 1970's-era Disney movies, which is really the problem with this movie.  The movie is okay, but uninspired.  The movie struggles to be funny.  The minimal tension in the movie is forced and generally unbelievable.  The movie comes across as being tired.

In spite of the rehashed plot, the tired jokes and the slapstick, there are things to like about this movie.  Somehow Suzanne Pleshette rises above the script in her role as wife Betty Daniels.  Though the character of ""Honest"" John Slade is a stereotype of similar characters in other Disney films, Keenan Wynn is always fun to watch.  The movie had other shining moments.  The cherry pie fight scene was funny.  Though the talking dog bit was over-used, the dog pound breakout had humorous moments.

Other well-known stars from that era include Vic Tayback (a regular in the television show ""Alice"") as crook Eddie Roschak, Dick Van Patten (""Eight Is Enough"") as Slade's assistant, and Jo Ann Worley (whose first role was in ""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis"" in 1960, but became famous on Rowan and Martin's ""Laugh-In""; Worley also appeared in the 1962 Disney space comedy ""Moon Pilot"") as Tim Conway's roller derby girl friend Katrinka Muggelberg.

In the 1950's and the 1960's Disney excelled at light comedy.  The movie ""The Shaggy Dog"" is one of those light comedies.  Unfortunately, Disney struggled in the late 1960's and in the 1970's with weak plots and weak scripts.  This sequel to ""The Shaggy Dog"" was one of those that suffered from a weak script.  Fortunately, there are just enough moments in this movie to make the movie worth having if you are a Dean Jones fan, a big Disney fan, or a fan of any of the other actors in this movie.  I am usually comfortable with my rating for a movie, but if I could I would have rated this one three and a half stars.

Good luck!",1172361600,10,3366,4.646362098138748
892478,3,6304500726,"Disney's ""The Shaggy D.A."" is an inferior follow-up to the original classic, ""The Shaggy Dog.""  The film stars Disney regular, Dean Jones, as Wilby Daniels (the part originally played by Tommy Kirk), who is now married to beautiful Suzanne Pleshette and is running for district attorney.  Some crooks steal the cursed ring that was responsible for turning Wilby into a sheep dog when he was a teenager. The crooks thought the ring might be worth a fortune but discover no one will buy it, so they sell it to Tim Conway, whose an ice cream salesman and owns a big shaggy sheep dog named Elwood.  Of course, he reads the encryption on the ring and Dean Jones turns into the sheep dog!  Tim Conway saves ""The Shaggy D.A."" with his comic genius and has several funny moments throughout the film.  Dean Jones is one of my favorite Disney actors, but this isn't his finest film.  His best performances are in ""Blackbeard's Ghost,""  ""The Snowball Express,"" and the classic ""The Love Bug.""  The dvd receives a very good transfer and is in the widescreen format.  Extras include a making-of documentary with interviews with Tim Conway and Dick Van Patten, which give some insights on the film's set during production.  I recommend ""The Shaggy D.A."" to Disney dvd collector's and fans of  Dean Jones, and especially Tim Conway.  ""The Shaggy D.A."" is a fair companion to ""The Shaggy Dog"" and a nice addition to the Disney dvd library.",1142467200,3,1423,4.739837398373984

The animation compared to these days is actually pretty funny and the kids enjoyed that a lot.  But the classic comedy of Dean Jones, Tim Conway and Suzanne Pleshette were wonderful.  We just rented this but I've added the DVD to my Christmas wish list so we can watch it again and again!",1481241600,,402,4.194805194805195
