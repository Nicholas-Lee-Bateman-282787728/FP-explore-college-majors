3720982,1,B001NPD9PE,horrible movie. horrible story. horrible effects and all. the ONLY GOOD ACTOR was mike duncan green mile guy i feel bad that he was misled into the position. kruek i mean krook did a horrible job in EVERYthing. bottom line ur better off watching the first street fighter the effects are about the same,1243123200,4,301,4.592592592592593
3720983,5,B001NPD9PE,"Well, I am not sure how many people actually saw this movie at the movies but I did...only because of Kristin Kreuk. I can easily say she played her character extremely well given what she had to work with. Kristin has a solid background in martial arts and you can tell by how she moves in the movie and she is a bright shining star in a poorly written movie. This movie suffered from one of the most horrible acting performances you have ever seen, Cris Klein as a gruff cop. It was so bad it went past comedic, past hokey straight into mediocrity at best. (Keep in mind I am being kind) Bad casting aside, the story was not fluid and was all over the place. Elements were thrown in it seemed to pad a thin script. They had all the basic elements to make this at least a noble attempt: cute actress, revenge plot, mentor teaching student and it was filmed in Thailand. This was a missed opportunity to just make a cool martial arts movie...I gave it 5 stars for Kristin cause she was good in this and for that to show through this script took super talent...",1243123200,7,1060,4.278606965174129
3720984,1,B001NPD9PE,"I do know a little bit about the Street Fighter game and the characters. I can not believe why they decide to make the movie in the first place. Who approved the script? The premise is ludicrous! Acting is horrible except for the girl that is playing Chun-Li. Her acting was alright but the rest of them....they have downgraded their resume when they signed up for this movie. I would not even recommend a red-box rental. Can I consider it as B-rated movie? It's not even good enough to be B-rated. The cinematography and the cheesy direction reminded me of movies made from the 70's or 80's. Moon Bloodgood, what ere you thinking?? You were so good in Journeyman! You did a fantastic job in that serie that shouldn't have been cancelled! I think most of the bad video game translated movies from the past were 10x better then this latest debacle! I never trash a movie like that before but this is just a terrible movie. Amazon doesn't let me do Zero stars so I have to settle for one.",1242777600,5,986,4.45303867403315
3720985,3,B001NPD9PE,"I would have given this movie five stars, but both Chris Klein and Taboo took away two. Chris Klein because his acting was as most people on here are saying. It was horrendous to see him play one of my favorite characters from the Alpha 3 game. And Taboo because they did very little with Vega. He's only shown twice and his fight scene with Chun-Li is under a minute and he gets owned big time. I mean, yeah you want to see Chun-Li come out victorious, but, you also want to see Vega making it hard for her to. I thought other than that, the acting was decent. Kristin made a good Chun-Li and Michael Clark Duncan was an excellent Balrog. He shined in all of his scenes. Now to Neal McDonough as Bison. He doesn't look or dress like Bison, but, then again, this is a prequel, so, we get a little bit of a different version. He's also Irish. Which, this would be a problem for me had they not explained his origins. Once they did, it made more sense. And the fights, though short, were well crafted, especially the one with Chun-Li fighting the goons in the alleyway and the fight between her and Bison. Also, Robin Shou as Gen was decent. He wasn't as old as in the games, but, he was still pretty cool and helped to create a great scene involving teaching Chun-Li a special technique. The story with this has pretty much been told before in films but done better. Still, not bad enough to take a star off. All in all, this film was decent and I will be picking it up on Blu Ray. It's like I tell people, don't watch this expecting a Street Fighter movie, watch this expecting a Chun-Li movie.",1242604800,11,1594,4.264026402640264
3720986,5,B001NPD9PE,While the movie didn't exactly burn up the box office with a rather questionable story line this DVD package does come with a 2nd Bonus Disk that contains the complete Street Fighter: Round One - FIGHT! animated motion comic (available at amazon) that features all the main characters of the Street Fighter universe - including Ryu & Ken.  So this perhaps isn't something to pass-up.,1242518400,8,383,4.892307692307693
3720987,1,B001NPD9PE,"Alright, so let me offer a disclaimer.  I didn't go into ""SF:TLOCL"" with high hopes.  The reviews had already come in as horribly bad (5% on RottenTomatoes and dropping).  So, I wanted to be entertained, much like I was when I went to see ""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Seige Tale"" or ""Babylon A.D.""

My main complaint with this movie is that nothing really happened in it.  I was extremely bored for an hour and a half.  The director took one of the stories from the original ""Street Fighter"" movie (Chun-Li wants to get revenge for what M. Bison did to her family) tried to make a serious movie, only based on that one story.  There just isn't a lot there.  So, to pass the time, we see Chun-Li mourning her mom's death, a woman who had a total of two lines in the whole movie!  Also, we have Chun-Li crying as she leaves her house to go to Bangkok, saying goodbye to each of her house servants, who are also people that we care nothing about.  Then we see Chun-Li living in Bangkok, walking around, looking around, sleeping.  I mean, what the hell?  You might think I'm exaggerating, but trust me...nothing happens.  The fights are short, poorly choreographed, and few and far between.  The movies should have been called ""Street Cryer"" or ""Street Walker"" or ""Chun-Li tries being Homeless.""  The fighting takes a back seat to the artificial drama that the film is trying to create.  There's also a supernatural aspect to the film which is poorly developed and felt like it was tacked on.  I will say this, though, that Kristin Kreuk does the best acting job by far in the movie, which is a much better performance than the movie deserved.

Some final comments should be made about Chris ""American Pie"" Klein's performance as Charlie Nash.  In a word, it's legendary.  I mean, his delivery goes beyond over-acting.  He must have thought that he was in the previous Street Fighter movie with how campy his performance was.  And as my friend noted, why do they have an American portraying an Interpol agent, and one that seems to take on a southern accent at times!  I yearned for more scenes with Mr. Klein, if only to break up the boredom.  If you like watching awesomely bad acting, then you owe it to yourself to see his portrayal.",1236211200,13,2240,4.514925373134329
3720988,2,B001NPD9PE,"Based on Capcom's popular video game, ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li"" stars Kristin Kreuk (""Smallville"") as the titular heroine. As you know, Capcom's original game has already been made a feature film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme in 1994 and then Chun-Li was played by Ming-Na. Now I saw the new film and I can say pretty confidently ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li"" is slightly better than Van Damme's terrible film. Well, just slightly.

Actually, it is not a bad idea to follow the journey of Chun-Li, who is to become a beautiful concert pianist-turned-fighting heroine looking for her missing father. The film starts off promisingly with an enjoyable fight sequence between Chun-Li's father Xiang (Edmund Chen) and Balrog (Michael Clarke Duncan). There are some nice moves and tricks using props like bottle and table. But then something goes wrong.

The biggest problem for me is the film's pacing. Action scenes themselves are decent, and at some parts very well-choreographed (by Dion Lam, action director of ""Doom""), but they are often too short (for example, Chun-Li's battle with Vega) and not many enough. I don't care the film's weak story and corny one-liners. I can ignore the unnecessary voiceovers. For martial action scenes (which are helped by editing) they obviously used stunt people, but it is OK. They did great jobs. I just want more actions.

Some say Kristin Kreuk doesn't look like Chun-Li. Right, you don't find exactly the same blue-colored costume and hairstyle as the game (except one scene, as for the latter), but Kristin Kreuk is surely gorgeous. Chris Klein and Moon Bloodgood appear for no other reason than to unnecessarily complicate the story. And I really like Neal McDonough, but he is simply miscast here. I miss Raul Julia.

""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li"" is directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak who is known for so-so action films such as Jet Li's ""Romeo Must Die"" and ""Cradle 2 the Grave"" plus ""Doom,"" another not-so-great movie inspired by a video game. With its wonderful cinematography shot in Thailand, ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li"" is not a terrible film. It just doesn't deliver the goods it promises.",1236038400,,2183,5.055555555555555
3720989,3,B001NPD9PE,"I wish people wouldn't write this movie off completely because it is worth watching...at least once. What you heard about Chris Klein is true. He gives the worst performance of the decade. And I'm not kidding. One reviewer said he couldn't even walk convincingly and they weren't exaggerating. It wasn't that the script was bad. The guy was hamming it up even when he wasn't speaking at all. There wasn't a second in this film where he showed any acting skills.

Take Chris Klein out of the film, and Moon Bloodgood for that matter, and the movie is actually pretty good. Kristin Kreuk does a great job as Chun Li. Her action scenes look good and her acting skills are pretty good as well. This could have been a great movie for her and launched her movie career if only everybody else around her wasn't doing such a poor job.

There's one scene (and character) that should have been taken out of the movie completely. It's where Chun Li goes to a nightclub to hunt down one of Bison's goons who just turns out to be a lesbian. In order for Chun Li to get the lesbian alone, she seduces her on the dance floor. The scene is painful to watch and adds nothing to the story.

There is some poor acting by pretty much all the other actors in this movie but Klein is BY FAR the worse. The action is, at times, very good. The storyline could have been better. The only thing to watch for is Kristin Kreuk. If there was an option on the DVD to take out Chris Klein's scenes, the movie would be far more enjoyable.",1236038400,19,1506,4.333333333333333

3721041,5,B001NPD9PE,"Kristin Kreuk is in it. Not only is she in it- she provides a voice-over narration through much of the film. These producers and directors clearly understand what a gift her soft smoky voice is to her adoring public.
If you think you don't buy 85 lb Kristin tossing around martial arts guys, you ought to see her in her pencil skinny True Religions doing combat stances with some huge sidearm in her current Beauty and the Beast incarnation as a DHS agent. She keeps appearing in contexts so ridiculous, out-of-character, and just plain dumb that fans develop a certain empathy for her. That to revel in her breathtaking embracability (no kissability. She is the greatest kisser on any screen in any era flat out.

Michael Clark Duncan is what he always is, for good or ill. My only real complaint is Chris Klein. I don't know if it was the way the character was written or if he was just really poorly cast, but he just comes off...greasy. I can handle all the other flaws in the film, but I really wish they'd gone with a different actor--or a different approach--for that character. But oh well.

3721181,5,B001NPD9PE,"I am a big street fighter fan, and I remember seeing the trailer for this film while sitting at home watching tv. So I just had to see it. So the day it was released I went to go see it with my sister. I loved it so much I went to see it a second time! SPOILERS BELOW!!!

STORY

Chun-Li moves from San Francisco to Hong Kong with her family. While practicing to be a concert pianist, she learns Wushu from her father Xiang, a businessman. For a while, her life is perfect until one night, Xiang is attacked and abducted by M. Bison's henchmen in front of Chun-Li.
Years later, Chun-Li grows up and becomes a talented pianist. At the end of her concert, she receives a mysterious scroll written in ancient Chinese text. Shortly after, she loses her mother to cancer.
Meanwhile, at Shadaloo headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand, Bison announces his complete control of the organization before he has the other shareholders executed by Vega. It is also revealed that Xiang is still alive and working for Bison.
The next day, Thai detective Maya Sunee meets Interpol agent Charlie Nash, when both are called to investigate the murder of several crime syndicate families in Bangkok. Nash informs Maya that this is the work of Shadaloo.
Back in Hong Kong, Chun-Li has the scroll translated by a wise old lady, who tells her she must travel to Bangkok and find a man named Gen. Chun-Li then leaves her home and travels to Bangkok, living homeless and searching for Gen for several days until a fight with thugs leaves her exhausted and unconscious, and Gen appears and brings her to his home. Gen informs her that he was once comrades with Bison and he knows how to find her father, and for the next few days, he teaches her his style of martial arts. Chun-Li also learns more about Bison, who is operating Shadaloo publicly, and is holding the families of property owners hostage in order to force them to sign their property over to him. While spying on Bison's henchman Balrog, she overhears that a property owner is asked to hand over the rights to a docking harbor, allowing the shipment of the ""White Rose"".
Later that night, Chun-Li goes to a nightclub and confronts Cantana, one of Bison's secretaries. She obtains information on the location of the White Rose before escaping from Shadaloo's thugs and Nash and Maya. As a result of this incident, Cantana is used as a punching bag by Bison the next day.
Gen tells Chun-Li more of Bison's origin. The son of Irish missionaries, Bison grew up an orphan and lived his entire life as a thief. Many years later, as a means of becoming completely evil, he killed his pregnant wife and transferred his conscience into their prematurely born daughter. After telling Chun-Li to go and fetch some food, Gen is attacked by Shadaloo soldiers before Balrog uses a RPG to blow up his house. Chun-Li runs off when she is attacked by Vega, whom she soundly defeats and leaves hanging by the side of a building.
The next day, Chun-Li interrogates a harbor employee into telling her the arrival time of the White Rose. She returns to the shipping yard that night, only to fall into a trap as Bison and his soldiers capture her. Tied up and brought into an undisclosed house, she is reunited with Xiang, only for Bison to break his neck. After Bison and Balrog leave the house, Chun-Li uses her skills to defeat the guards and escape. During the escape, she is shot in the arm by Balrog, but is reunited with Gen, who heals her wounds and continues with her training.
Despite being taken off the assignment, Nash is secretly asked by Chun-Li to back her up in taking down Bison. Nash and Chun-Li, along with Maya and her SWAT team, arrive at the shipping yard, where they engage in a shootout with Shadaloo forces. Maya is wounded in the shootout, but her SWAT team manages to dwindle Shadaloo's numbers. Meanwhile, Chun-Li enters a ship and discovers a girl who speaks Russian before leaving her to continue her search for Bison. On the other side of the ship, Gen faces off against Balrog until he impales him with a liquid nitrogen pipe. Bison takes the girl - who is revealed to be his daughter Rose - and flees the scene by helicopter.
Chun-Li, Gen, Nash and a SWAT officer arrive at Bison's headquarters, where Nash and the officer take Rose out to safety while Chun-Li and Gen face Bison. After a long battle, Chun-Li hits Bison with a bamboo pole and drops sandbags on him, stunning him. She then charges up a Kikoken and shoots it at him, knocking him off the scaffolding before she jumps and twists his neck with her legs. Nash tells Chun-Li to leave the scene as Thai police arrive.
Chun-Li returns to her home in Hong Kong and settles down when Gen pays her a visit. He shows her a newspaper ad for an upcoming Street Fighter tournament, telling her that a Japanese fighter named Ryu might be a recruit for their cause. She declines the offer, telling him she is home for now.

The story is the telling of the street fighter story from the beginning, before Bison died in the game. The story was so thrilling, it really explains to you who chun li is, and what her role as a street fighter character is. If you don't know much about the background of street fighter, this movie will lecture you on it, with action! I like it just as much as the 1994 film, which was amazing.

CHARACTERS

The characters were portrayed perfectly from the game. Balrog is a boxer who works for bison. Bison is an evil tyrant plotting to have absolute power. Vega was twisted just like always. Charlie nash was great. Maya (C. Viper) was smart and tough like in street fighter IV. Gen was done really well, the movie tells us how he was once a member of shadowloo. I loved chun li. Rose is a little girl at this point, not the adult as seen in the game, but I like that they're giving information on her character, since Rose is such an inscrutable character.

CASTING

Kristin Kreuk as Chun Li
Neal McDonough as M. Bison
Chris Klein as Charlie Nash
Michael Clarke Duncan as Balrog
Moon Bloodgood as Detective Maya Sunee
Taboo as Vega
Robin Shou as Gen
Edmund Chen as Xiang
Josie Ho as Cantana
Elizaveta Kiryukhina as Rose
Katherine Pemberton as Young Chun-Li
Cheng Pei-pei as Zhilan

The casting was great, the actors portrayed the characters just right, they acted just like them. Kristin Kreuk is half chinese, so she really looks chinese, and she really looks like chun li.

ACTING

Great acting, Kristin Kreuk really put a lot of emotion in her role. Chris klein's performance was great, and neal mcdonough as bison was fantastic, he is a very underated actor. Michael clarke duncan was as good as always. Everyone was great!

COSTUMES

All the costumes were well elaborate, some were changed, like vega, which I kinda like. During the club scene we see chun li's outfit from the game. This is before bison died, so at this point, he is not wearing the outfit from the game, but he is wearing a business suit. So yeah, the costumes were great.

SPECIAL EFFECTS

Kick ass special effects, you'll notice this especially when chun li throws her projectile in the end of the film. Nice explosions, great cgi work!

FIGHT SCENES

During the club scene, chun li performs her spinning bird kick. When I saw that I was like ""Woah!"" Then there was the chun li vs vega fight scene, like in the animated movie, she steps on his face, great fight scene. Then there's the final fight scene, chun li vs bison, awesome scene, I love how she twists his neck. Then there's gen vs balrog, another great fight scene! All the fight scenes were great, that is what's needed to make a great video game movie, such as street fighter.

FINAL WORD

I'm glad capcom helped make this film, because it was a fantastic hollywood creation. I simply had to see this movie a second time. This is on my top 10 favorite video game movies ever made. This film is flawless, I recommend it to all street fighter fans, if you loved the van damme film, you're gonna love this version! I wish they would do a sequel already! I want to see ryu. I may review the van damme version sometime later if I'm still up for it, but keep up on my reviews as I continue to post, because I love writing reviews.",1364601600,2,8810,4.571337983513
3721182,5,B001NPD9PE,"I really enjoyed this film, as it was very entertaining. Being a huge Kristin Kreuk fan, and very interested in the Martial Arts, I decided to purchase this product. I am very supportive of her career as an actress, and I look forward to many more films of Kristin in the near future. The movie itself  I am not too sure of its past reviews, but I am pretty sure the ratings were inaccurate. This is one of the best action films I have saw in a long time. Great work Kristin Kreuk .... Great work ! I wish her great success in her project series, "" Beauty and the Beast "", as I do hope it will last a few seasons. I do regularly watch the series, and the plot is thickening ....  great storylines for the characters Catherine Chandler and Vincent.  I wish her great success and happiness in her journey as one of the best future actresses in Hollywood to date .... hugs and kisses Kristin ! Keep the roles coming baby. Besides she is from Canada and we all love her ! I am looking forward to future purchases with your club.

  Thanks Amazon !

Missed seeing her. Now shes on Beauty and the Beast. Still it was good seeing her in an action packed movie. She could really fight. I rate it only 4 stars, for lack of a better script.",1360195200,,363,4.27536231884058

3721186,3,B001NPD9PE,"This movie has the potential of becoming a cult movie one day.  It's almost so bad that it's good.  If you've read any of the other (scathing) reviews you'll know that there's just some goofiness going on here such as our female heroine (played, as an adult, by an attractive Kristen Kreuk whom will, with the aid of lighting and how she's wearing her hair at the time, make you wonder exactly what ethnicity she is) being obviously asian as a young girl and hardly obviously asian as an adult.  Also, Bison (a platinum dye job Neal McDonough) just always knows too much all of the time and does not fit into the exotic locales.  Still, the movie can win you over with its sense of wonky earnest faux-asian spirituality-ness.  This is a revenge story served jumbled but don't worry, the narrative's not hard to follow.  The action is acceptable (although there is a brutal bit between Chun-Li and Cantana, Bison's #1, with a bit of lesbian sizzle thrown in--it all seemed odd...and contrived as if the filmmakers were checking off boxes on how to appeal to the demongraphic(s) that would be watching their movie).  Robin Shou of Mortal Kombat fame is the sage Gen who leads Chun-Li toward fulfilling her fighting abilities.  The attractive Moon Bloodgood is paired up as Detective Maya Sunee with Chris Klein's masterfully named Charlie Knash and they operate from the side of the law which is supposed to be the everyman's view of the proceedings I suppose.  In all honesty it is a bad movie in many ways and that's why there is so much invective thrown its way.  But I kinda liked it for its wackiness (as if the scripter, director, and producers didn't really care about things like consistent chronology), for the entrancing eyes of Kristen Kreuk, and for it packing more action than I expected.  That said I'd probably only recommend this (minus the brutal lesbian fight) to boys between the ages of 13-15.",1353196800,,1911,4.708708708708708
3721187,1,B001NPD9PE,"I bet Van Damme is feeling pretty good about himself, now after this wasted plastic garbage is out. I wounder if the director of SF (Steven E. de Souza)and Andrzej Bartkowiak are related to each other in someway. Both are lousy directors. I swear that most of these directors are coming strait out of collage to show just how low the lack of imagination can go, and how far up the head can reach.
If this is what you call a Chinese action flick now-a-days, then I'd stick to the old faded Chinese action films that are choppy and worn and where you see cut-scenes that are out of sequence.  Anyone with a brain stem would gladly trade this movie in for a Bruce Lee clip any day.
Ok so, you've got Bison who is a crime lord and NOT a military leader, (way to stick to the story Andy) whom has a better chance at selling me a infomercial of Sham-wow then running an over populated area. So running eviction notices is a crime... Well hell if that's the case, then she should brake George Bushes neck at the end. Opps! I gave away the ending. Awe well, if anything I did you a favor. You're welcome, now do yourself a favor and never EVER buy or even rent this movie. If this movie is anything like the Ring, then a small part of you will die after watching it.",1352678400,,1258,4.219917012448133
3721188,5,B001NPD9PE,"This was a low budget movie& I didn't think I would like it, but I have to say I really enjoyed the movie&for the Price you just can't beat it!",1351209600,2,143,3.8
3721239,1,B001NPD9PE,"There have been tons of bad video game films over the years. The bad Tomb Raider films to the even worse Hitman and BloodRayne, and perhaps the worst of the all in Double Dragon and Super Mario Brothers, but Street Fighter: The Legend of Chung- Li could be the worst of them all. When it came out in theaters I skipped it knowing it would be terrible. When it came out on video I didn't rent it. I didn't even think it was worth the few bucks it would cost to rent the film, so here I am writing a review of the film. I ended up watching it on a questionably legal streaming site. I had time and was bored so I decided to watch it since it was free to me and even with it being free I wish I could sue Capcom and the other film companies who made this piece of absolute garbage for mental stress and wasting my time.

Now on to the c*ckamamie plot the film has. The story follows Chung Li (Kristin Kreuk) who as a child lives with her family till Balrog (Michael Duncan Clark) and M. Bison (Neal McDonough) attack and take away her father. I know just visualizing those two makes me laugh, but I'll get to the casting in a second. Anyway back to the really bad script. Years later Chung Li is a musician living a normal life till she receives a scroll during a performance that changes her life. The scroll sends her to Bangkok to find a man named Gen. Gen informs her that her father was a live, and proceeds to teach her a years worth of martial arts in a few days so she can be ready to fight Bison. Meanwhile Bison has taken over Shadaloo. The plot gets even more ridiculous and funny when they go into Bison's back story about how he became pure evil killing his pregnant wife and then decided to transfer I guess his soul into his premature daughter. You'd think a person willing to kill his own wife and possible his daughter just because he wanted to become pure evil was already pure evil or at least that's what I thought. Now if this story wasn't already a big pile of sh*t the obviously room full monkey writers decided to add another terrible side plot in Interpol agent Charlie Nash (Chris Kline) and Bangkok detective Maya Sunee (Moon Bloodgood). These two added into the mix are investigating the death of local crime bosses who Bison killed. The worst part of the story is the way it ends as if the writers actually thought this film might garner some kind of sequel.

I want to be hard on the cast of this film, but I think I have to put more blame on the studio, director and writers for this garbage. Still I do have to blame the capable actors for signing up for this film. I like Kristin Kreuk. I loved her on Smallville and she is a beautiful and capable actress, but she just plain sucked as Chung-Li. I can only fault the crappy dialog for so long till I have to look at her acting in the film, which was average at best. Let's move on to Neal McDonough. His performance as Bison is just plain laughable. I never like the actor and in this film he confirms that point with his terrible acting job. I know the writers gave him nothing to work with, but even with that said his performance sucked. Michael Duncan Clarke well he just looked like he was having a good time. I think the deceased actor new what kind of film he was in and just had fun with the role not taking it seriously. I think the man just enjoyed life and brought it to every role he played no matter what kind of film he was in. Now on to Chris Kline who I haven't seen in many films, but he obviously can't act with his laughable dialog and his hobo look. I swear he looks like a bum I'd find on the streets of Portland. As for Moon Bloodgood she did a decent job, but she was wasted in role and storyline.

The action/Martial arts scenes are just terrible. You can tell none of the main stars had any previous experience. You'd think if studios were going to make a movie based off the street fighter games that's actually get some actors who were had little knowledge and could knew how to make the fight scenes believable. I don't think Capcom could find a respectable director to direct this...this...well you know what I've repeated a few times before. Any way I'm sure every respectable director ran away, and the only one willing to take this film on was cinematographer Andrzej Bartkowiak. Andrzej had mainly done cinematography for films, but what really surprised me was that he directed Romeo Must Die, Exit Wounds, Cradle to the Grave and Doom, so this guy has experience directing martial arts films working with the legendary Jet Li twice. You'd think he would have learned something from those films, but he must not have. I really don't know what Capcom was thinking by making this film. Didn't they see with Tomb Raider, Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat and all the other video game films that it doesn't work if you half ass it. They should know that the only good video game films are anime ones or anime series based off of them. Hollywood and movie studios just don't take them seriously. I think the only way a video game film will truly go main stream is if it gets a major studio, respectable director and actors along with good writers. If that doesn't happen I don't see any video game ever truly breaking out here in the United States.

Overall Street Fighter: The Legend of Chung-Li is one of the worst video game films I've seen, and one of the worst films I've ever seen. It has some of the worst writing and dialog you will ever see in a film and badly miscast with average to downright terrible acting, and ever worse action/martial Arts. I'm sure most of you know how bad this film is, but avoid it at all cost. If you see it on television change the channel. If you see it on your computer unplug your computer and run an anti-virus program to wipe all traces of it from your computer. If not just like in the Ring it will come out and take your soul and drain years off your life.

I'll have my review of Looper up sometime in the mid afternoon. I can't wait to see a good film after seeing this piece of sh*t.",1350086400,,6035,4.290350877192982
3721240,4,B001NPD9PE,"I like this movie more than the original Street Fighter movie. legend of Chun-Li gives the viwer an inside look at Chun-Li the story is loosely based on the Street Fighter franchise. The modern updae to Chun-Li's story is decent. The introduction of Nash was interesting, but poorly done. Nash should have been preented as military not as a police officer. As movies go the plot was good, the action was good, and the acting was good. The locales added to the story. It was not the greatest fighting movie but it was above average. It is far better than its predecessor and the somewhat watchable King of Fighters. I rank Legend of Chun-li on par with Tekken live action film and a step down from the first Mortal Kombat. Enjoyable movie with a forgettable M. Bison.",1349222400,,766,4.598540145985401

First off, the chick playing Chun-Li was barely freakin asian, which I'm sorry, but how can you make an asian film about an asian character, and then put a barely recognizable asian chick in the place of chun-li? Really??? Hollywood, you know better. Second, the acting was mediocre at best, as was the fighting styles and choreographed fights. Oh and if that wasn't disgraceful enough, they put her in a blue outfit and stick her in some club nad that's where she does her signature move, and guess what, folks??..it blew ass. Big ass. Donkey ass. It was a terrible film, and you know what? I could have actually forgiven it, if they did not stick one of my favorite martial arts actors in the movie...Robin Shou...why, lord...why? I mean sure, Mortal Kombat 1 and 2 was super cheesy, but in the 90's hey! That was the best that we had, and despite the Duke Nukem type pix-elated graphics of that time period, at least the movie stood for something and didn't perpetrate the characters in a way that you'd never recognize them.

Since my grandson is taking Tae Kwon Do, I thought this video might add a little extra exercise in self-defense which Chun Li demonstrated in more ways than one. I especially wanted him to see how a female can also get into martial arts and working with the bamboo. It was significant that bamboo fight scene since he drew copying an image of a ninja posed with a stick of bamboo, so ironic, because he drew that image on a piece of wrapping paper for his mom's birthday gift among other images he drew which was a treasure for his mom to keep. Quite a little artist and tae kwon do artist. His master wants him to join their demo group to participate in the nationals next year in Colorado. His parents, myself are proud to know that he is focused and does extremely well for his age in this form of activity. Your video gave him an expected, eye-opening look at what this form of art is really all about, and appreciated. It was a fine video, full of action & story telling with great actors.

Fans of the video game took it particularly hard. It became the common opinion that a worse film based on the arcade franchise was impossible; and though I personally thought the JCVD vehicle was okay, it seemed clear that a future attempt would have no choice but to do better. Fifteen years later, we were collectively proven wrong when director Andrzej Bartkowiak - former director of cool stuff like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romeo-Must-Die/dp/B00003CXGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romeo Must Die</a>&nbsp;but more recently responsible for junk like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doom/dp/B000CNER1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doom</a>&nbsp;- took the least inspired and least faithful ""Street Fighter"" script he could get his hands on and made one of the most disappointing movies of the decade. You'd think that filmmakers go out of their way not to learn from history...

The story: years after the kidnapping of her father by the nefarious underworld boss Bison (Neal McDonough,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minority-Report/dp/B00005JL78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minority Report</a>), the young heiress Chun-Li (Kristin Kreuk,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smallville/dp/B00005JLKB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smallville</a>) acts on a mysterious message and submerges herself in urban Bangkok, trying to find clues leading to her father.

Yes, I know that Kristin Kreuk has Chinese heritage, but the fact that she in no way looks like it strengthens my opinion that Hollywood is afraid to put Asian performers in starring roles. However, she's the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the film's flawed casting choices: Michael Duncan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Armageddon/dp/B00000G3PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Armageddon</a>) is a no-brainer for Balrog and I think Jaime ""Taboo"" Gomez had potential as Vega, but Neal McDonough as Bison and Chris Klein (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie/dp/B000031WD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie</a>) as Charlie? Forget it. I think highly of Robin Shou (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>), but no amount of makeup or bad wigs can convince me that he's an old man (Gen). Video game unfaithfulness aside, the alternative storyline the film entertains is disappointing: a fighting tournament would have been a better place for these one-dimensional characters to kick it about, but as an intrigue thriller, nobody is particularly interesting enough to follow willingly (some, like Charlie and his non-canon partner played by Moon Bloodgood&nbsp;], are almost entirely superfluous to the plot and only exist to kill time). The acting's okay enough, but poorly-written characterizations and dialogue stifle any dramatic talent the performers have.

Wholly, the fight scenes may be an improvement over the 1994 film's, albeit a minor one. The opening battle, wherein Chun-Li's father (Edmund Chin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Eye/dp/B0000AVHAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Eye</a>) takes on Balrog and some goons showed a bit of potential, but it's mostly downhill from there. Action coordinator Dion Lam has done decent work both in America and Hong Kong, but his wranglings here are tired and uninspired: not only do the nine fights fail to simulate the back & forth style of the games, but the one or two moves it does lift from them look so stupid that they're enough to make you laugh. Unconvincing wire-fu is overutilized and most of the brawls are rendered choppy by post-production editing. The only fight I was really interested in - the Chun-Li vs. Vega battle - is so short and one-sided that it defies the build-up the latter character had been afforded. Sorry, fellow Vega fans - our boy's a real chump in this film.

What surprised me more than anything else in the movie is how cheap the CGI looks: there's only a bit of it, but man is it weak. It upsets even the film's aesthetic appeal, and therein secures the movie's poor rating. The world will apparently need to wait another decade-and-a-half for the possibility of a superior live-action ""Street Fighter"" movie; I only hope I'll still have my patience for bad cinema at the time for another potential disappointment.",1336089600,3,4800,6.6752

3721247,1,B001NPD9PE,"I don't know how this movie got to be in the theaters, but it wasn't worth watching there. I think the name Street Fighter threw everyone off and they put it in the theaters for that reason only. I know I went there for that.

If you saved your money and got to watched it at home, that's good. This is just a B movie with ok special effects. Actually, the special effects were better than the costumes though.  They should fire the costume designer. Vega's metal mask looked so stupid and heavy. Really?  I think the customer designer wanted to make Vega look scary, but that wasn't the point of the mask at all.

How is Vega supposed to fight in that? There is a reason why his mask is supposed to be light - he's a speed fighter!  Sure, if he was a power house fighter, you can give him a heavy mask, and that wouldn't matter, but he's not a powerhouse. Also, if he was a powerhouse, he wouldn't care about his face as much and wouldn't even need a mask to cover it. He would be like Balrong and get cuts all over his face and still keep going. But, Vega not like that and therefore needed a light weight mask.

Kristin Kreuk is a good actor and pretty cute, but she just doesn't make a good Chun-Li. I think they should had gone with a different actress.",1312243200,,1258,4.177685950413223

3721262,1,B001NPD9PE,"But I do know that for months now, this film has been a kind of private joke amongst some friends and I.  Sometimes simply saying the title alone will provoke laughter.  I guess it was only inevitable that I'd see it someday.
Well, the film is exactly as I thought it would be.  Sure, I went into it with the same level of expectations I had when I went into Kazaam, so my opinion was a bit jaded right off the bat, but look at the movie we're talking about here.  It did meet expectations however.
So, in this film we have little Chun Li, a very Asian looking girl, who is taught the martial arts by her father.  Dad is kidnapped by the evil M. Bison and his henchman, Balrog(Michael Clarke Duncan!), and used in his dastardly plan of buying real estate and killing off the competition.  As soon as Chun Li grows up into a very European looking young lady(she's about as believable as a Chinese lady as John Wayne was as a Mongolian when he played Genghis Khan), she junks the idea of becoming a concert pianist and seeks out Bison to whoop his butt and free her dad.  She goes to a very English savvy and predominantly white Bangkok, where she meets up with Gen(Robin Shou, who played Liu Kang in the Mortal Kombat movie).  Gen is a former buddy of Bison, now a kind of all around do-gooder.  He trains Chun Li with every Mr. Miyagi-ish cliche imaginable.  He's also mastered the ancient art of mediocre CGI, so he is able to create swirling vortexes with his hands, and heal Chun Li's wounds as well.  Soon, Chun Li is ready to take on Bison and his evil real estate plan.
Bison's trail of bodies is being investigated by Detective Maya Sunee(Moon Bloodgood in trademark sexy cop mode) and Interpol agent, Charlie Nash(played by Jason Lee impersonator, Chris Klein).  Nash listens to loud hip-hop music in his car, so he's supposed to be cool.
Teaming up with Chun Li and Gen, Nash and Sunee take on the evil Bison and save the day(that's not a spoiler-you knew that already).
Needless to say, this movie is jam packed with just about every action and martial arts movie cliche in the book.  One scene has Sunee and Nash on a stakeout, where they suddenly have to start making out to throw off the villains when they glance at their car.  I can't count how many times this has been done!  Don't you think villains would have caught onto this cheap trick by now??  All we're missing in this film is the action/chase sequence where we see a naked couple interrupted while having sex in their car.
As expected, this film is done in that tacky Matrix-y style of slo-mo projectiles and ultra sped up martial arts.  Sickening.
Like any teenager of the 90s, I played my share of the Street Fighter games.  I didn't follow the animated saga or anything(but I was one of the lucky ones who saw the original Van Damme classic in theaters!), so I don't claim to know alot about these characters and their origins.  I do know that with this film some major artistic license was taken.  Bison wears a business suit, Balrog is missing his boxing gloves(though it makes sense that a guy wouldn't constantly be wearing boxing gloves), Chun Li herself seems to have a whole different wardrobe.  Vega is played by some guy from the Black Eyed Peas, further devastating any shred of redemption for this film.  Vega looks, well, like a guy from the Black Eyed Peas with a silver mask and a metal claw.  Wasn't Vega from Spain?  Not to say that some guy from the Black Eyed Peas couldn't be from Spain and all, but I gotta say that this doesn't look like the Vega you remember.  In fact, in a way he looks more like a shrimpy, children's Halloween costume version of the Predator.  I never understood why movie makers insist on altering the appearances and costumes of characters from video games, comic, cartoons, etc. when they make films out of them.  I mean, you know people are gonna bitch, right?  Don't they always?
And finally, why Chun Li??  Couldn't a more interesting character have been tackled here?  I don't know one person who gives two s$#@s for Chun Li, let alone how she became to be.  Now, The Legend Of E. Honda-Now we're onto something!  How he became obese and mastered the Hundred Hand Slap.  That might have fared better at the box office.

3721263,4,B001NPD9PE,"I bought Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li for a couple of reasons.  First, I had only seen the last half of the movie on cable and wanted to see what I had missed.  Second, I like Kristin Kreuk and enjoyed the part of the film that I had seen.  Finally, when I saw that this was a three-disc set for a terrific price, I knew I had to get it.

The blu-ray doesn't disappoint.  Like other reviewers have stated, the quality is excellent, crisp sharp transfer and astounding sound.  The discs are loaded with extras and the behind the scenes footage is informative and entertaining.  For die-hard fans there is even a full length animated movie (and believe me, the animation is very limited) that looks at the origins of Street Fighter.  Personally, I skipped that disc after the first five minutes and stuck with the other extras and the film, which, incidentally, comes in both the theatrical version and the unrated version.

I know this movie for the most part was savaged by the critics, but watch it and enjoy it as a guilty pleasure.

So great you can actually develop it just by being born Irish, without ever going to ireland, or meeting an irish person....apparently.

Where is the name of god (or as Bison would say it ""Where in the name of shamrocks and shenanigans""), did he get that accent????
He grew up in Thailand!!! His parents died when he was a baby!!!
Unless he was sent to Thailand in a spacecraft haunted by the ghost of his dead father he could hardly have heard an Irish accent in Thailand.
Much less learned to to mangle one so Offaly (get it).

Also, Inez Yan who played the young Chun li and Kristin Kreuk ARE NOT ALIKE!!!
One is chinese, the other is Kristin Kreuk.

PROS:
 - About a minutes worth of scenes of bangkok are great, and show the character of the place.
 - Some of the characters names are used, this can make you feel nostalgic if you pause the dvd and close your eyes and don't turn it back on.

CONS
 - Chun Li was apparently placed in a race changing machine as a child in a scene we never saw.
 - Bison is placed into an accent changing machine so he can have an accent no Irish person would equate with any particular Irish region.
  Actually it would have been more realistic if he didn't know how to speak english at all.
 - Bison punches an unborn fetus!!
 - Chris Klein is awful in every scene he's in. He has power-ranger levels of awfulness mixed in with dialog so bad it could have been written by repeatedly kicking over a scrabble board.

This film will make you feel have you wasted a whole year of your life.

3721266,1,B001NPD9PE,"A burgeoning concert pianist, Chun Li (Kristen Kreuk) adores her father, the man who taught her martial arts.  When Bison (Neal McDonough) and some henchmen - Balrog (Michael Clarke Duncan) among them - abduct her father, and Chun Li's mother eventually dies, there is nearly nothing left for which to live.  When she receives a mysterious Chinese scroll providing guidance, her path eventually leads towards a criminal element and the training of Gen (Robin Shou).

Meanwhile, Interpol agent Charlie Nash (Chris Klein) descends upon Bangkok and meets up with a local detective name Maya (Moon Bloodgood) to investigate the recent mass murder of all the crime syndicate bosses.  The only criminal mastermind left is Bison, who's been busy buying shore-front property in the slums, sending in his secretary Cantana to participate in the least seductive girl-on-girl dance scene in cinema history, and hiring a killer named Vega (Taboo from Black Eyed Peas) who gets it started, gets some boom, boom, pow, and takes a few lovely lady lumps from Chun Li's feet.  Bison's biggest plan, however, involves the shipment of the mysterious White Rose.

Let's get one thing straight: this movie is ridiculous.

Aside from titular actress Kristen Kreuk's cuteness, and goods of Moon Bloodgood (which nearly fall out of her shirt in most scenes), the only real highlight of this film is the cinematography from Geoff Boyle.  His gritty renditions of Bangkok almost made the storyline of a 105lb. girl with the face of a model who survives on the street believable.  Almost.  Nothing, unfortunately, could save the sub-moronic script.  None of the actors really stand out from the crowd in a good way.  Chris Klein, however, manages to brood so horribly in his ""supposed to be edgy""-role that every line uttered is a punch-line; and every scowl evokes snickers.  The only way it could have been worse would have been if his role was animated by Pixar.  If the intent was to hire him as a distraction for the script written in crayon and the scatter-plot directing, then it only partially worked.  Only the combined beauty of Kristin Kreuk and Moon Bloodgood stopped Hollywood from getting a restraining order against Chris Klein.  And don't even get me started on the Neal McDonough as Bison miscast.  RIP Raul Julia.

The special effects are limited and well done - which I appreciate - but the remaining wire-fu is nearly intolerable.  If I see one more scene of Kristin Kreuk running through a maze of machine gun fire without taking a hit.  Shoulda been Moon Bloodgood.  Shoulda been slo-mo.  You're telling me John Woo couldn't have brought in his doves for this one scene?

I know you won't believe this, but since I've logged literally hundreds of hours playing the original Street Fighter game, and I'm the undebateable master of Jean Claude Van Damme movies, I can honestly tell you that the JCVD movie adaptation was better than this one...and that should be enough to avoid this affront to film stock.",1281312000,5,2999,4.954
3721267,1,B001NPD9PE,"I watched this last night with my wife. The previous night I had gotten a full night's sleep, but that didn't matter. 20 minutes into this yawn-fest, I was nodding off. Even the sparse action scenes weren't enough to respark my interest.
I really wanted to like this movie. Chun-Li is one of my favorite Street Fighter characters, and not just for her sex appeal. Her moves kick serious butt! I love her in the new SSF4 and she is awesome in 3rd Strike. I've played as her in every SF and versus game that has come out, and my image that I have of her is completely different from how she was portrayed in this movie. Don't get me wrong; I'm not hatin' on Kreuk- she is a fine actress and a very attractive woman- but she is NOT Chun-Li. And it's not just that she doesn't have Chun-Li's legs or hips nor is she even Chinese- her mannerisms and dialogue pretty much have nothing to do with the video game character. But even the movie as a stand-alone is nothing but boredom due to bad script writing and uninspired action sequences.
And it's not that I had high expectations for this film either. I wasn't expecting a Street Fighter dramatic masterpiece. I have seen the Van Dam release and even the anime movie. They weren't great or even really that good, but they were at least fun to watch. I guess that's what I was hoping from this movie; and hour and a half of action-packed, mindless, dumb fun. Instead, I got 90 minutes of drifting in and out of catnaps and trying not to drool on myself. My wife at least was able to stay awake. She liked it a little more than I did.

3721309,2,B001NPD9PE,"I just finished watching this Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li with my hubby and I can not say that the movie was good. I sat down to see the movie with few expectations and while I was entertained for one and a half hour, so the movie was not all bad, I am not really impressed. The movie have a few really serious flaws.

1. Street Figther: The Legend of Chun Li is supposed to be a Martial Arts movie. I usually love Martial Arts films, however when you have a lead actress, and most of the bad guys who can not perform Martial Arts so all you have is creative movie editing and special effects to make it look like they can, then the whole point sort of vanishes.

2. Why is Chun Li Caucasian? I mean seriously there is allot of skilled Chinese actresses why not hire one of them. I had a hard time getting into the movie when the man character who is supposed to be Chinese is a Caucasian. It reminds me of old movies where Asian and Indian and so on characters always was played by white stars in make up as the movie companies did not think a non white person in a lead role would sell tickets to the movie. But seriously are we not past that time by now.

3. The lead actress is horrible. In Smallville Kristin Kreuk only need to smile and show off how pretty she is. She is superposed to be the homecoming queen, pretty teenager is about the whole of her character as Lana Lang. However when she now is supposed to play a character who is a little bit more Kreuk fall flat on her butt. Her lines sounds like they are read directly from a script. Even the scene where a major character dies have no emotional impact. Kreuk do not manage to carry this movie at all.

4. There are two police detectives in the film, and they really do nothing, it is just a little side plot which just feels added in there to make the movie a little longer. Why not bring in some more Street Fighter characters than to try to make this into a cop movie, which it is not.

5. There are to few Street Fighter characters in the movie. There is some nudges to the fans, like Chun Li having her hair in buns on the side of her head and wearing blue in one scene and that she at one point kicks Vega's mask of his face, little things like that and that give the movie a big plus in my book, however there is to little of it. When I watch a movie named Street Fighter I want to see character's and things that remind me of the games, there is to little of that here.

All in all this movie is not horrible. The story is generic and clich but it is ok. While some hate Bison in this movie I kind of like what they have done with the character, he might not have the look of the original Bison but he definitely get the personality right. Ballrog was spot on. The movie get two and a half stars from me, it is a slightly bellow average action movie. There are many and better movies of the same type out there. But if you are a Street Fighter fan and you can get the movie cheap then you might like it for all the little references to the games that you will find.",1276473600,2,3049,4.056478405315614
3721310,2,B001NPD9PE,"Whatever this movie is, I wouldn't call it Street Fighter.  It has the characters from Street Fighter, it mentioned the Shadaloo (or ShadaLAW as it calls it) and the location of its whereabouts from Street Fighter, it had a few fighting move nods from Street Fighter, but instead of just following the source material to being fun and silly, ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li"" barrens that material to try and be a realistic story through Chun-Li's tragic path to vengeance.  In this movie's view of realistic, Bison is a ganglord trying to take over part of Bangkok (of course?), Balrog is a bouncer, Charlie Nash is a cop, Vega's a Black-Eye Pea wearing an ugly ski-mask with an equally ugly voice, and Chun-Li's half-Asian; to the film's credit, the latter is a fine excuse to make Kristen Kreuk somewhat believable, although I find it odd that her child self looks Asian and grows less Asian as time passes.  The film's about poverty, controlling the housing, syndicate, and other predictable plots for a b-grade action film.

If the film was called by a different name, it would've been soluble popcorn entertainment.  But no, it wanted to be a Street Fighter movie, so it occasionally adds floaty, unrealistic wire-fu action scenes to make the fight 'stylistic', and in the most absurb direction for a 'realistic' film, Chun-Li was taught by Robin Shou to use actual fireball attacks; not even the first Street Fighter movie had fireball attacks.  Now that I mentioned it, as flawed as ""Street Fighter: The Movie"" is, at least it's a Street Fighter movie in heart and spirit.  The biggest problem with this film is that it couldn't decide what kind of film it is, and ends up being confused and messy.  None of the actors make their roles work, especially Chris Klein who is laughably miscast as Nash.

The plot is just uncalled for.  Never mind the extreme violence for a PG-13 movie, it's the plot that went south.  There's a sub-plot regarding Bison's Irish past and who had a child through some disturbing ritual, which he wanted to use for some reason about exchanging goodness or something, but the sub-plot is basically forgotten by the time the film got to the boring climax.  Most scenes don't make sense, like how Chun-Li teamed up with Nash even though she never met him before.  It's an amalgam of lazy and sloppy, and the director of ""Doom"" continued to not give a darn about making a film cohesive.  He may have the nice cinematography, but he couldn't make the movie even remotely cult-worthy.  As much as I don't like ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li"", at least it has the budget to make it look above crap, but it's still crap.",1275696000,2,2661,4.729437229437229
3721311,5,B001NPD9PE,"Seriously.  Pay no mind to all the negativity written about this movie. As a part of the generation of the cult phenomenon that is Street Fighter, Chun-Li was my favorite person to play since I am a chick, obviously. When you beat M. Bison with Chun-Li, it tells the story of Chun-Li losing her father to him. When I heard this movie was coming out I was absolutely ecstatic (a whole generation later!). The producers and the directors decided to make the movie as REAL as possible--NOT ""videogamish""... which I thought was a great creative decision. If you are looking for Street Fighter ""The Video Game Movie""--don't watch this movie. Watch the original one with Jean-Claude Van damme or the many other animated movie versions of this series out there.

The way this movie turned out is a Chun-Li fan's dream, IMO. It left me satisfied, at least. Once again... if you are true Street Fighter fan... pull yourself away from the video game world for just a little bit, and remember the remarkable stories behind each and every unique character we love so much. That's a BIG reason why I enjoyed the game, at least. Every character had a wonderfully unique story and journey they were embarking upon while they were after Bison's head.

A dream come true for me would be a movie/legend made for EVERY Street Fighter character (at least the characters from Street Fighter II). Anywho... this movie entertained me from beginning to end, and I enjoyed the realism of it tremendously. I really didn't expect too much from it, either, even as a huge Chun-Li fan. But I have to say I was pleasantly surprised, and EXTREMELY glad that I ignored all the negative reviews. Do the same thing. Decide for YOURSELF.",1274918400,7,1702,4.723905723905724

Bison was more ""paramilitary"" and there were the other supporting characters like Riu (he's mentioned at the end after Bison is defeated)?  Ken wasn't even mentioned.  The anime plot actually is more believable than Chun Li's dad being a ""power broker"" who can singlehandedly manipulate the world's power base even years after being reported as kidnapped?!!  The rating system doesn't really fit (it wasn't that ""i didn't like it"" while it really wasn't ""ok"", but maybe a 2.5) since I did enjoy the fights and special effects, but the plot really was a distraction.  I was also disappointed that the plot diverged so radically from the anime.  I always wonder why screenplays diverge from what seems to be a ""successful"" storyline.  Mortal Combat was a much closer match to the anime version.

Bison is changed from a criminal warlord into a crooked property developer whose master plan is to drive up the crime rate and buy land cheap.  Chun Li shuns her trademark China dress for tank tops and sweat pants.

The Hollywood cliches include an ancient master, a training montage and lots of wire-fu.  For a film set in Southeast Asia the cast lacks Asian faces.  Along with Amer-Asian Kristins Kreuk and Moon Bloodgood most of the named heroes and villains are white.

The deleted scenes go some way towards fleshing out the characters and filling in the plot holes but it's hardly a good sign when the director chooses to cut out a good chunk of the plot.

I was looking forward to this movie for that one reason. But, when I saw this movie, I just couldn't believe what they did to it. I thought the last movie was awful but this one just blows that one out of the water. And, of all things, I thought Kristen Kreuk would be the one redeeming quality to save this film. Yet, even with all her beauty, it wasn't enough to save this film.

Folks, no joke-- this movie is bad. Real bad. I tried watching this movie twice and fell asleep during it both times. I barely made it to the end the third time. Thank Heavens, though, I did.

What gets me is the trailer made this movie look so good. Too bad, it was such a big disappointment.",1261094400,3,811,4.225806451612903
3721347,3,B001NPD9PE,"I can't speak to the additional disks, but I did see the blu ray unrated edition of the movie.  The most important thing I can convey to you is that the writing for this movie is terrible.  Absolutely terrible.  Some movies pull off bad writing with a ""cheese"" factor where you can watch with friends and laugh at the goofy nature of the lines.  But this movie seems to be trying really hard to be serious.  So I guess the director of the movie thought they could manage to make the awful script work that way.  I feel bad for the actors.  They tried.  And in some cases you can see how professional they were being, but the writing defeated them.

To further clarify my assertion of bad writing, the story introduces all sorts of potentially interesting tidbits that could be stories of their own, and then rushes through them.  Predictably though, these tidbits end up being used later in the story without any real reason to use them.  For example, Chun Li goes through intense training (meditation) in order to be able to gather chi/ki energy into a visible cloud that she can then throw at an opponent.  They make a big deal about how she has to let go of her anger to accomplish it.  And then in the big climactic fight, she's beating the tar out of the bad guy (Bison).  Then comes a point where's staggered, and Chun Li's trainer yells out ""you know what you have to do!""  Of course she hits Bison with the chi/ki blast and he goes tumbling off a building.  But this big special attack she spent so much time working on doesn't finish the job.  Instead, she jumps off the building to use some other ""Street Fighter"" attack to snap Bison's neck.  So that powerful chi blast thta you spent half the movie setting up was really pretty crappy?

Don't get me started on the lines.  The worst lines come from the police officers that they focus on in parts of the movie.  I'll leave it at that, and let you decide for yourself when you watch it.

Which implies I think you might want to watch it.  I did give the movie 3 stars.  There's some fun stuff to watch in there, and the special effects are decent.  Also, Kristin Kreuk is beautiful... so I had to bump up the rating some for that.",1259798400,,2191,4.350617283950617
3721348,4,B001NPD9PE,"After seeing both original Street Fighter movie and this one, this movie has a lot more back story than the previous version, the script was much better written and much more realistic.  The only blemish that I could notice is the miscasting of Nash and Chun-Li (even though there are some limits on Chun-Li's casting as the issue of finding a suitable Asian actress to play that role was quite limited).  As for casting of Gen, Balrog, and Bison, as far as I'm concerned, they were more spot on.  I actually enjoy this movie more than the ""atrosity"" from the first movie (although the only people should be faulted are the writers).  The fight scenes are as good as the original, if not better.  Overall, while it's not perfect, the movie has much more teeth.

In addition, I have realized there was one important factor that led to some of the changes that has upset many Capcom fandom, and that is everything to do with the politics in Thailand, specifically the fact that the military and the royal family in Thailand can NEVER be questioned and can NEVER be casted as villains.  This was especially true after coup d'tat in 2007 against then Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and its subsequent political turmoils for the next 4 years.  Based upon that fact, I maintain the point that this movie is not as bad as Capcom thought it would have been.",1258848000,4,1358,4.629166666666666
3721369,2,B001NPD9PE,"Unlike many of the reviewers here, I am not a video game player, but I do enjoy martial arts-themed films, so I thought I might enjoy ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li"" without the potential disappointment of an unsuccessful game adaptation. Well, I discovered you don't have to be a player to be unhappy with this film! As an action film, it lacks momentum, and the martial arts tradition of ever-increasing virtuosity in battle as the stakes are raised. As drama, it often seems little more than a poor imitation of Bruce Wayne's karmic quest from ""Batman Begins"". As a star vehicle for ""Smallville's"" Kristin Kreuk, it showcases her exotic Dutch/Chinese features beautifully, but also reveals a lack of screen charisma, that magnetic quality that captures your attention over all others whenever she is onscreen. Ziyi Zhang has that quality, and I found myself wishing she'd played the lead (although, in this movie, it may not have helped!)

The supporting cast doesn't offer much in support, from Neal McDonough (usually quite good), who displays an Irish(?) accent that comes and goes throughout the film, to Michael Clarke Duncan, whose performance seems to consist of flexing his biceps and looking crazy/happy, or crazy/angry. The most painful performance, however, comes from Chris Klein, offering a 'drama school dropout' interpretation of a macho hero...he is simply awful! The lone decent performance comes from Robin Shou, as Gen, who lacks much of a mystical quality, but at least seems to 'fit' in this kind of film.

Bison (Neal McDonough).  And that's pretty much the one thing director Andrzej Bartkowiak gets right.

The mismatched cast play their stereotypical action movie roles to their hilt, the script has more holes than Bonnie and Clyde's car, and the movie crew simply didn't consider the ramifications of taking a video game story this seriously.  The first SF film was silly and over the top, but that's where you found a hint of charm.  What does this entry offer?  Pretty locales, a so-so fight choreography, the mandatory movie explosion, and Chun Li seductively dancing with another woman.  OK, that's two things Bartkowiak gets right.^_^

I found movies such as DOA which is more unapolgetically cartoony to be more enjoyable to watch, plus DOA had some hot women in it.

3721378,5,B001NPD9PE,"I have always been a street fighter fan, particularly of chun li, so I was pretty excited when I heard they were doing an origin type film on her character. My excitement grew tenfold when I heard Kristin kreuk was cast as chun li, as she has always been a favorite of mine. I was disapointed when no theater around my area showed the film, but being a B-movie, I understood.

Now, after picking up the blu-Ray edition, I can say that this was a very entertaining film for me, particularly upon repeat viewings. The first impression was bad, as Klein is just awful. And the epic finale effect was poorly done. However, I still liked th movie after the initial viewing. On further screenings, after I knew what to expect with certain characters and cgi, I found that I very much enjoyed it. Kreuk's acting is always fantastic, even though some of the casting was questionable (particularly vega), most of the characters did a fine job. I especially liked bison, even though many street fighter fanatics were disgusted at the way the character was written and portrayed. I thought the exact opposite. It breathed new life and motive to bison, and the character was well executed by the actor.

Many street fighter fans disliked this movie, as did many critics, but this reviewer had a blast watching it, and continues to enjoy subsequent screenings. The blu-Ray is excellent quality in both picture and sound, the digital copy is a great addition, and the comic-style amine that's included is fun.

The plot is pretty weak - basically Chun Li (Kristen Kreuk) fighting to save her father from Bison (Chris Klein), who oddly enough is an evil corporate gangster in a three-piece suit in the film - not the guy in the red military uniform from the game. Furthermore, Bison's alleged powers come from having transfered his conscience to his daughter so he would not be hindered in pursuing his dastardly plans. And just what are those great plans? To evict squatters in Bangkok so he can build luxury real estate projects. I kid you not. The evil antagonist of Street Fighter fame has been reduced to being a dirty landlord. While I'm not in favor of kicking people out to further elite business interests, it happens all the time and isn't particularly evil (just see what happened in the U.S. after the Supreme Court case of Kelo v. New London).

3721410,1,B001NPD9PE,"For the first 30 minutes or so, my friends and I had a good time laughing at this movie's ridiculousness.  It was moving in the ""so bad, it's good"" direction.  However, you can only tolerate so much crap before it becomes ""it's so bad, i can't stand to watch it anymore.""

Nothing in this movie was done right, well, or even competently.  My favorite scene in the whole movie was Nash's introduction.  It was about five seconds of completely amateurish ridiculousness that makes Uwe Boll look like a true artist.  I believe it should become the new Rick Roll.  When I get a chance, I may extract that scene, and post it to YouTube, so that I can Nash Roll my friends.

The acting and dialogue are terrible.  I've seen porno films with better.  For some actors, it can't necessarily be blamed on them.  The script seems like it was pieced together from George Lucas's prequel trilogy cutting room floor.  The film exhausts the credibility budget almost immediately by never even giving a single reason for any character to do anything.  The situations will have you constantly wondering how and why the characters are in them.

The movie is painful.  Perhaps most painful are those scenes focused on Bison.  The film attempts to give the vile dictator some sort of pseudo-sympathetic backstory, then shows how he abandoned all good.  It is terrible.  It's insulting.  It's putrid.  It's beyond comprehension and/or justification.

There is nothing worthwhile in this film at all.  Do NOT waste your time.  Even a group of friends with beers in hand couldn't enjoy this movie beginning to end despite taking plenty of opportunities to mock it.

By the way, the bonus feature is a motion comic.  It is the first issue of Udon's series as a motion comic.  It is also garbage.  It's terrible, but it's not nearly as bad as the feature presentation.",1250899200,2,1843,4.73186119873817

They cast an asian child for the role of young Chun-Li who then grows up into Kristin Kreuk...a rather noticeably non-asian woman?!... This is the first few minutes of the film and it only gets worse from there. The fight choreography was lackluster, the plot holes are big enough to drive a herd of elephants through, Kristin's acting is acutely sub-par, the movement from scene to scene is nonsensical at times, and they completely wasted Robin Shou...who is the main reason i watched this film. It does not matter whether you are a fan of the game or not, this is an absolutely abysmal waste of celluloid. Badly scripted, but horribly executed. The only positive notes were the performances of Neal McDonough and Michael Clark Duncan who play their parts with ferocity. I cannot even recommend this one for fun because the flaws are so apparent they destroy any simple escapist pleasure that might have been had otherwise.

Now when you are a fan of a book or in this case the video game you expect certain things.  One thing I have found that when it comes to comic-to-movies or videogames-to-movies they are never what you want or hoped for.  This movie was a great mixture of many things.  It was fasted paces, which was perfect for the storyline, full of actions, had stunning and believable fight scenes, and the characters shared an amazing chemistry with one another.
The acting was incredible in my opinion. When you looked at Kristin Kreuk, you saw the emotion she was feeling. Whether it was the pain of loss or the pain of an injury, she made you feel what she felt. Chris Klein did a great job, which shocked me. Though not a fan of the movie my sister forced me to watch American Pie.  This really opened my eyes to his acting ability I hope to see Chris explore other movies such as this one.
The best part of this whole movie is that it didn't turn into a love story. Now I am a huge romantic but the movie would have sucked of they did that. Sure there is heavy flirting between Nash and Maya, but it doesn't go beyond that.  As I said adding something like that would have taken away from the movie, and would have just seemed force in.

3721414,4,B001NPD9PE,"While this movie is not a masterpiece, it is the most entertaining martial arts movie I've seen this year. Kristin Kreuk was a badass Chun Li that exceeded Ming Na's performance in every-way possible. She gets hit so completely hard in this movie that you will shudder when she fights M. Bison. For this alone it is worth buying on Bluray or DVD and warrants at least 4 stars. Kristin Kreuk is also alot warmer of a person and is able to bring a depth to Chun Li that has never been seen before.

Contrary to other people, I liked Chris Klein, mostly because Moon Bloodgood is more like eye candy than a joker and is not really funny. Without ""Nash"" the extra cop scenes would have been dry. I could seem him as a Jean Claude Van Dam type character or Ryu if they had given him more to do and better costuming or showed muscles. There is no way that you did not at least smile at his lines. He was funny and a big dork, and underused.

M. Bison is also completely and utterly evil in this movie. His backstory is OUTRAGEOUS and awesome. While not the same as Raul Julia, the actor who plays him, who won't stop popping up in every **** movie I rent, delivers his best performance yet. We also see how Shadaloo was formed which is really cool. Opposite an amazing Balrog, as the big guy from the green mile, we get a huge opposition for Chun Li to fight.

Criticisms: I think this movie could have been a bit more fun with the amped up costumes, but this story happens BEFORE the tournament, and is focused mostly on Chun. Also its hard to symphatize with Chun when she strikes it out on her own in Bangqok, because we already knew she was rich, and Kristin is so beautiful, however on the plus side, these scenes were beautiful and showed the warmth and adventurous side of Chun Li. There was also a scene where Chun harasses an office worker in a shipyard that was a little too much and could have been edited. It would be horrible to be working some lame job, and Chun just comes in and beats you up for info LOL! Also there is some nastiness when we see that M. Bison tortured chick making the violence level of this movie goes up. Its just a warning though, I actually like the fact that a movie wasn't afraid to show violence against women. A lot of violence and hatred has been unnaturally focused on men lately, and I'm glad that this movie doesn't protect anyone. Also one CG shot in particular involving a piano concert was no good...These are all minor complaints, as the movie is overall very fun and manages to be slightly better than the original SF movie. I deduct one star for these because I think the plot was actually written to be solid, and gave us more eastern insight into the spirit of the warrior, which you can apply to real life.

This is a very positive movie underneath and exceeds the original SF in my opinion. If you combine that with the great fights, in particular involving M. Bison falcon punching Kristin Kreuk so hard my sound system almost exploded, this movie is a buy for any Street Fighter fan, a movie the kids can blow some time on in the summer, or for someone wanting to add a decent martial arts movie to their collection, this is it.

While this movie doesnt stay completely true to either, its still a very entertaining action/martial arts movie. After reading all the bad reviews, i still wanted to see this one and i'm glad i did. SPOILER ALERT: The things that were complained about the most are  1. the fact that the characters don't wear their typical game/anime costumes. I personally think they atleast should have worn them at some point in the movie but it never happens. Thats one negative. Another negative is that Chun li's fight with Vega is super short and quick. Its a good fight but they didn't make it lengthy at all Chun Li made it look way too easy. I think the reason the movie makers might have done this fight this way though is because if you'll notice, she didn't kill him, she only roughed him up alittle. Chances are We'll be seeing more of Vega in the future and a possible rematch between him and Chun li would make alot of sense in the next movie. Hopefully, it'll be alittle more epic. I'm really looking forward to the next street fighter movie being made most of all because i want to see my favorite, Ryu kick some a** with Ken. Overall, a good movie, but not a great street fighter movie. But, it had alot of potential and i think the next street fighter movie will be even better. Watch this movie.

Not a lot of difference except some of the more bloody parts that are shown on the uncut are toned down on the theatrical (particularly the Bison beatdown of a woman and Chun-Li's ending fight with Bison).

The film, overall, was a vast improvement over the Van Damne version of Street Fighter back in 1995! Kristen Kruk as Chun-Li Xian was excellent. The fights, for the most part, were believable and I also liked how they kept it real world rather than follow the game.

Didn't much care for Chris Klein, who played Charlie Nash. He seemed useless almost. Same goes for the lady detective that was his partner here. I've heard both are actually good actors but it seems they didn't really have much to work with here.

Overall, not bad at all! I only hope if they continue to make Street Fighter films that they take what worked here and develop it more with a better storyline and better roles for the actors.

3721430,5,B001NPD9PE,"This film had the unenviable task of taking Street Fighter and making it ""realistic"" for live action audiences.

How many of you are familiar with the actual storyline from the Street Fighter games?  IT'S RIDICULOUS.  The official Capcom Street Fighter story is filled with green mutants, people coming back from the dead, men who wrestle bears, levitating crime lords in bright red clown suits, and two men (that's right TWO) who can stretch their arms and legs a good 10 - 20 feet.

Stuff like this simply cannot be translated to live action very well.  I'm sorry, it just can't.  For this reason, I can respect their decision to approach this movie in a more realistic way, unlike the first live action SF movie featuring Van Damme...rest assured, this movie is much more reasonable than that one.

Once you accept the fact that this is an ADAPTATION of the Street Fighter STORY and not an IMITATION of the GAME, you will probably enjoy this movie much more.

It's your typical action flick.  If you dig those, you can dig this one, too.

Especially if you can appreciate strong female leads, which are too rare in the martial art/action genre.  Kreuk plays Chun as respectable and tough...cute, but not ""over-sexified"".  A fine balance.

Bison is an enjoyable villain.

Nash is hilarious.  If you don't take him (or yourself) too seriously, you will laugh at him at least once.

And, is that...Crimson Viper?  Hmm...check out the bonus features to find out...

Bottom line:  Don't strain your brain too hard.  It's a martial arts/action film based on the SF franchise.  It's not Gone With the Wind.  It's not Titanic.  Relax people and let yourself enjoy.",1246752000,15,1659,4.804964539007092
3721431,4,B001NPD9PE,I just watched the movie today. I read all the reviews but it didn't deter me from watching it. It didn't disppoint. Great martial arts. Great action movie. This is not a drama movie so don't expect amazing acting ability from the stars. Wonder if there will be a follow-up from this movie. I wouldn't mind watching a second and third installment.,1246752000,4,347,4.612903225806452
3721432,2,B001NPD9PE,"The awesome ""Street Fighter"" video game franchise was first brought to life by Hollywood in 1994 featuring a ""cartoonish"" Jean Claude Van-Damme, Ming Na-Wen, Kylie Minogue and Raul Julia as the despot named Bison. The movie was a disaster and it was no wonder why it failed miserably in the box-office. Hollywood should've taken pointers from Japan for ""Street Fighter: The Animated Movie"", which was undeniably the best movie adapted from the franchise to date. Director Andrezj Bartkowiak now brings us another film very, very loosely based on the enduring video game franshise in ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li"". Nope, it isn't any better than Van Damme's movie. So why did I waste my time watching this movie? One name: Kristin Kreuk.

Many years have passed since a criminal mastermind named Bison (Neal McDonough) has abducted Xiang, the father to a girl named Chun-Li. Now, Bison rules the streets of Bangkok under the empire of Shadaloo; with his cohorts Balrog (Michael Clark Duncan), Vega (Taboo), and vixen Cantana (Josie Ho). They strike terror and panic into the hearts of its inhabitants. Chun-Li (Kristin Kreuk) is now grown up and has traveled to Bangkok in search of a mysterious man named Gen (Robin Shou) so that she may find her destiny. Under the tutelage of master Gen, Chun-Li learns how to channel her CHI and become a better fighter. Now, the young female warrior must try her best to take Bison down, with Interpol agents Nash (miscast Chris Klein) and sexy Maya (Moon Bloodgood) hot on her trail...

I am puzzled as to how and why this movie would carry the ""Street Fighter"" moniker. The film is a departure from the 1994 movie and carries very little references to the video game franchise. The movie only features a few characters and while I understand perfectly that this is a movie about Chun-Li, but it doesn't really fit into any of the ""Street Fighter"" mythos. The movie does abandon a cartoonish feel, and replaces it with a straight-forward revenge premise; it is grittier and concentrates on Asian mysticism while adding the workings of a crime drama. The once colorful characters are replaced with a feeling of realism with the screenplay exercising a serious tone. Writer Justin Marks desperately tries to make the characters his own by incorporating new mythos, sidestepping video game tie-ins and resisting the temptation for the film to become another fight saga. The ambition is there, but sadly, this is a ""Street-Fighter"" movie and fans would like to see a lot of mano-o-mano brawls.

I wouldn't really mind a re-imagining of the mythos and I can appreciate a bold approach but the direction just fumbles the ball. Andrezj Bartkowiak's resume includes ""Cradle to the Grave"", ""Exit Wounds"" and ""Romeo Must Die"", so how can he end up with a project like this? What were they thinking--that someone who directed movies starring DMX can pull off a project like this?! The storytelling is rather a little clumsy with holes that open so wide that the state of California may be able to fit. I also felt that it was edited badly and since I saw the deleted scenes of the film in the Dvd, there were significant scenes that were edited out from the unrated cut. The inept directing and storytelling skills of Bartkowiak is on display as the movie slowly looses any small momentum it may have gained from the opening act.

All right, everything can be forgiven as long as an action movie has loads of action right? Well, the fight scenes choreographed by Dion Lam looks rather flashy with elaborate use of wire work accompanied with a `street-fighter-like"" finishing effect. Some moves are decent, but most of them feels more like a simple exhibition than real encounters full of intensity. The set-ups are quite formulaic and I think the movie was restrained by its budget as the camerawork and editing of the fights could have been better. Kristin Kreuk did some of the stunts but most of the fights are unusually shot in a manner that intentionally hides the faces. Neal McDonough looked real clumsy in the fight scenes as he stumbles in counting off his moves much like John Saxon in `Enter the Dragon"". Robin Shou has more experience in action movies after ""Mortal Kombat"" so he looks comfortable. Note to Hollywood, it is better to teach a martial artist how to act than to teach an actor to do martial arts.

The acting by Kristin Kreuk is as competent as in her performance in the TV show ""Smallville""; sure it is decent but the direction can offer Kreuk very little support. Chris Klein looks like a metro sexual ""Dirty Harry"" as he tries desperately to look like a ragged, unkempt tough guy. Klein is just horrible in his portrayal and his character so one-dimensional. Moon Bloodgood is a sight to behold, and her sexy looks are definitely a welcome distraction for the viewer. McDonough's Bison is horrible; another note to Hollywood, a villain should be evil enough to be hated and loved enough to hate.

""Street Fighter the Legend of Chun-Li"" should have done better without the ""Street Fighter"" brand then maybe I'll give it a higher rating. The film is so lacking in video game tributes and when you have a member of the Black-eyed peas and Chris Klein, you know it's headed straight to the cleaners. It would have acceptable if the drag-out brawls were spectacular but the movie is just hampered by bad editing, direction and budget. I like Kristin Kreuk and Moon Bloodgood but not enough to become interested in its hinted-at sequel although it does promise to right several mistakes in this movie. (Here's hoping that Chris Kattan and Will Farrell doesn't star as Ryu and Ken) Well, just give me Japan's ""Street Fighter"" anime instead.

Skip it! [1  Stars]

Video/Audio: 2.35 ratio anamorphic widescreen. The transfer is for the most part good, although a bit soft on certain scenes. Black levels are good though. The dvd is better when up-converted to 1080p. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is powerful enough and clear.
Extras: The deleted scenes are worth checking out as it fulfills the film's plot gaps.",1246752000,5,6068,4.826923076923077
3721433,1,B001NPD9PE,"There comes a time when ""actors"" should just say no.  No to lousy scripts. No to low budget arcade game movies.  But when you're a 2nd rate actor with no martial arts skills and zero fighting skills whatsoever, well of course you'll say ""YES!"" to a low-budget martial arts flick.  The ""fight"" scenes were truly pathetic.  Come on - Chun Li was so slow, I'm surprised she didn't grow roots.  I guess part of her ""intensive training""  included telegraphing every move and hamming up every scene.  I don't remember Chun Li having a diet of Red Bull, sugar and Meth.  A simple run from roof top to roof top has to include  enough flips, twirls, spins, and pirouettes to make a ballerina dizzy. Oh yea - she also makes about as much noise as a buffalo wearing a dozen cow-bells walking over loose sheet metal while knocking over drum sets in an echo chamber, while at the same time chewing on bubble wrap.  Seriously. Yet  the silver mask wearing drop-out  from a 2nd rate Karate school can't hear her?  I guess the mask was pinned to his ear-drums.

Kristin Kreuk - Can't act, can't fight. I'm sure there was full time employment for the three people it took to constantly hold up cue cards and help her remember her lines. I hear her fight trainers are hiding in shame. Or laughing at the money they made training her. I can hear them now...Trainer #1 ""OK, when she punches, let's have her wind up, step back and squint!"" Trainer #2 ""Come on, that's nuts!"" #1 ""We'll tell them it's a secret Thai fighting style, seldom seen by westerners!"" #2, laughing ""Great idea! It worked on Van Damme!""

Chris Klein - another graduate from the Keanu Reeves school of bad acting. More ham than a Thanksgiving Dinner.

Robin Shou - the only decent fighter in the movie, and surprisingly, the best actor.  A dull pearl cast among the trash.

Michael Clarke Duncan - Huh? Michael Clarke Duncan? Is he this desperate for money?

Clich&eacute;s? This movie has more than you can count.  Some areas of dialogue are nothing but a dozen clich&eacute;s strung together.  Often, you know exactly what they are going to say and what every reply will be.  Rip-offs? I can think of lines stolen from Terminator, Predator, most martial arts flicks, and a lot of action movies. It was almost like there was a brain storming session, where a bunch of action movie fans yelled out the good one-liners they could remember from all the movies they had ever seen, then picked random ones and added them to the, er, script. Of course the term ""brain storming"" is applied loosely here.

I swear there was an ""I'll be back"" - I was waiting for ""Come with me if you want to live!""",1246752000,9,2640,4.534883720930233
3721434,2,B001NPD9PE,"Now, I went into this wanting to like it, I wouldn't have bought it otherwise, but you can want in one hand, and well you get the idea. Gone is the self aware tongue in check humor of the 1994 movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Instead we have this slow moving, not much martial arts for the first thirty minutes, movie that dosen't even realize that it is so silly. The Van Damme movie knew it was a joke, and succeded quite well, I should add. Here, we have gravity defying wire fu, but this one is supposed to be more ""realistic."" I love the term realistic, action movies are about as realistic as porno movies, weather it be Die Hard or the Transporter, in real life, this stuff dosen't happen.",1246579200,4,701,4.358778625954199
3721435,3,B001NPD9PE,"no doubt that the Street Fighter purists will be sorely disappointed in this movie. i'm an old school fan of the game as well as the cartoon series, but that doesn't make me want to hate on this film.

it's not great. in fact, ""The Sauce is weak in this one."" LOL! but i still found it entertaining.

Kristin Kreuk actually shines in the film, but she does so without the support of a single character in this movie. bad actors, weak storyline, and fight scenes that are too short. and yet the movie was still moderately entertaining. but i'm a fan of cheesy fight flicks, so take from that what you will.

with such a weak plot and storyline, there just REALLY needs to be more fighting!

but i have to take my hat off to Kristin Kreuk. she's not just a pretty face. she used what she had to work with and gave a great performance. shame on the rest of these clowns!",1246579200,3,867,4.236363636363636
3721436,3,B001NPD9PE,"The Street Fighter franchise has been a wonderful video game series that captured our attention, most importantly with the release of CAPCOM's ""Street Fighter 2"" in the early 1990's when it was first released in the arcades.  Since its release in 1991, there have been many ""Street Fighter"" related games that have been released in the arcades but also on the consoles with ""Street Fighter IV"" being released in 2009.

One of the iconic characters of ""Street Fighter"" has always been Chun Li.  The Interpol agent who has been desperately looking for her father and uses the ""Street Fighter"" tournaments as a way to get closer to the crime syndicate known as Shadaloo run by M. Bison. (Balrog in Japan).

With a film released back in 1994 featuring on a large cast of characters which included Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile, Ming-Na as Chun-Li, Raul Julia as M. Bison and Kylie Minogue as Cammy but receiving a lot of criticism for its convoluted story and too many characters, the film remained on the list of a staple of films based on video games that were not that good.

In 2009, CAPCOM with Hyde Park Entertainment and Twentieth Century Fox decided not to repeat that mistake and focus on their character Chun-Li.

""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li"" was directed by Adrzej Bartkowiak (""Cradle 2 the Grave"", ""Romeo Must Die"" and cinematographer for many films which include ""U.S. Marshalls"", ""The Devil's Advocate"" and ""Lethal Weapon 4'), a screenplay by Justin Marks (""Unbroken"", ""The Stranger"" and ""Fast Forward""), music composed by Stephen Endelman (""Samurai Girl"", ""The Net 2.0' and ""Now and Again"") and cinematography by Geoff Boyle (""Mutant Chronicles"" and ""About a Girl"").  Producing the film were Patrick Aiello (""The Other End of the Line"") and Hyde Park Entertainment Chairman and CEO Ashok Amritraj (""The Other End of the Line"", ""Traitor"", ""Virus"" and ""Double Impact"" ).

The film would bring together a diverse cast with Kristin Kreuk (""Smallville"") as Chun-Li, Chris Klein (""American Pie"", ""American Dad!"" and ""Election"") as Charlie Nash, Neal McDonough (""Desperate Housewives"", ""Walking Tall"" and ""Traitor"") as Bison, Robin Shou (""Mortal Kombat"", ""Death Race"" and ""DOA: Dead or Alive"") as Gen, Moon Bloodgood (""Day Break"" and ""Terminator Salvation) as Det. Maya Sunee aka to ""Street Fighter IV"" fans as ""C. Viper"", the US debut of Hong Kong actress Josie Ho (""The Twins Effect"", ""For Bad Boys Only"" and ""Purple Storm"") as Cantana, the US debut for Singapore actor Edmund Chen (""The Eye)"" as Chun Li's father Xiang, the Black Eyed Peas member Taboo as Vega and Michael Clark Duncan (""The Green Mile"", ""Sin City"" and ""Daredevil"") as Balrog.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li"" is featured in 1080p with an aspect ratio of 2:35:1 and AVC@28MBPS.  For the most part, the film receives an awesome transfer on Blu-ray.  Outdoor scenes of Bangkok are vibrant and a lot of detail can be seen with the characters and their surroundings.  Flesh tones are natural, blacks are nice and deep and I spotted no sign of compression artifacts.  The picture quality is quite solid!

As for the audio, the film is presented in 5.1 DTS HD-Master Audio and action scenes sound great as you can hear the sounds panning from your left surround to your right.  LFE is utilized quite well throughout the film and you can expect your subwoofer(s) to be utilized while watching this film.  From the bass of the music, the booms of the thunderstorms and the many gunshots heard throughout the film.  Audio is well-utilized throughout the film.  Dialog and music are quite clear through the front channels.  Overall, a solid lossless soundtrack.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH, Spanish and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li - Unleashed and Unrated"" features a good number of special features.  The Blu-ray release comes in three discs.  The theatrical and unrated feature on disc one, disc two contains the digital copy and disc three contains the full-length animated Origins comic movie ""Street Fighter Round One: Fight!"".  Included are:

DISC 1:
# Unrated Cut Audio Commentary by Producers Patrick Aiello and Ashok Amritaj and Actors Neal McDonough and Chris Klein - For the most part, the commentary was on the positive side.  About working with the various talent and  fight choreographer Dion Lam.  Also, the experience of filming in Bangkok.  And a hint for a ""next one"".  Could that mean a Ryu, Ken or Guile film on the horizon?
# Street Fighter In-Movie Enlightenment - Optional factoid while watching the film.  You can learn about the character Chun-Li and her video game history and power moves and also behind-the-scenes of the film and more.
# Deleted Scenes - (15:31) Around ten or so deleted scenes (no individual selections, just play all) which is actually quite interesting because the deleted scenes had interesting background on why the Bangkok neighborhoods were protective over Chun-Li and more character development between Chun-Li and Charlie Nash.  Also, an alternate ending was included.
# Marvel vs. Capcom 2 Sneak Peak - (1:13) I'm guessing this is the XBOX Live HD version of the popular fighting game.  Even more interesting is how the ""Transformers"" (animated film) theme song ""You Go the Touch"" is used as the background theme for the sneak peak.
# Becoming a Street Fighter - (17:41) Interviews with the cast and producers and CAPCOM staff of the popularity of ""Street Fighter"" and brief summary on the history of the video game franchise.  Chun-Li's character and how Kristin Kreuk had to undergo five weeks of intense training, filming in Bangkok and having an international crew/cast involved in the film.
# Chun-Li: Bringing the Legend to Life - (6:38) Writer Justin Marks talks about the prequel to ""Street Fighter 2"" and what they wanted to accomplish in this film.  Also, the wirework and training and working with fighting choreographer Dion Lam (""Spider-Man 2"", ""The Matrix"", ""Romeo Must Die"" and ""Young and Dangerous"").
# Fox Movie Channel presents Making a Scene - (9:26) The alley scene and the importance of the fighting scenes of the film.  Interviews with Dion Lam and his first impression of Kristin Kreuk and how she was serious with her training and worked with him in making sure that credibility is important with the fight scenes.
# Recreating the Scene: Arcade to Film - Using the remote of your Blu-ray player to show side by side comparisons of the actual characters from the video game and the talents.
# The Fight in Black and White - Storyboard Gallery - Using your Blu-ray remote, you can view many of the storyboards of the film.
# Behind the Fight - Production Gallery - Using your remote, you can view the production gallery images.

DISC 3:

Street Fighter Round One: Fight! - This is a full-length animated origins comic movie from Eagle One Media features a total of six chapters.  Each chapter is around 15 minutes long.  There have been quite  a good number of comic releases on DVD and Blu-ray featuring voice acting and the animated comic panels with or without word balloons (this is optional in the menu).  But overall, I felt the inclusion of this DVD with a Blu-ray release was a great addition.

The main special feature on this disc are the trailers for ""Dragonblade"" and ""Voltron"" but also a cover gallery.

JUDGMENT CALL:

The ""Street Fighter"" franchise has its dedicated fans.  With each version released at the arcades and on consoles, casual and competitive video gamers are always anticipating something big with ""Street Fighter"".  And as there have been critical responses to the Japanese animated versions of the series, the same can be said with the two live action films.

Suffice to say, that with Kristin Kreuk as the lead actress to play with Chun-Li, many fans of the series were a bit mystified because Chun-Li was a woman that had muscular characteristics (known for her muscular thighs) and typically her storyline centered as an Interpol agent working alongside with Guile to find her father and put a stop to M. Bison and Shadaloo.

So, when there is a change, especially a major change to the characters, the film is going to cause its fans to cry foul.

Needless to say, having grown up with ""Street Fighter"", going to the arcades and spending a massive amount of quarters on the machines and even covering EVO tournaments on various ""Street Fighter"" related video games and the people who compete, as a reviewer I had to let my love and knowledge of the video game off-the-hook and just pretty much watch and see what changes the producers and writer needed to change in order to make ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li"" a commercial film.

With that being said, after watching the film, I was entertained.  By no means is this the worst video game to film adaptation.  There is actually an entertaining story behind the film but its loosely based on the video game series.  The film has its flaws and I can see clearly, hardcore ""Street Fighter"" fans are not going to enjoy how the story of this film differs greatly from the video game.  If anything, its just the names and certain fight moves that retain its ""Street Fighter"" video game correlation but it's as roughly based on the video game series as the HK martial arts film ""Avenging Fist"" was to ""Tekken"".

Kristin Kreuk brought her talent to the film as we have watched her do for years on ""Smallville"" and it was great to see that she underwent the five week intense martial arts training to get her prepared for the film.  It's one thing to understand that finding a talent to play the definitive Chun-Li would be challenging but if anything caught my curiousity was the casting of five year old Chun-Li who looks very full-blood Chinese, while Kreuk and Katherine Pemberton (who plays the ten year old Chun-Li) are not.  Many viewers don't think Kristin Kreuk as an action star but she was able to carry her own throughout the film.  But judging by the amount of time the producers had to get this film ready for a US and Japan premiere, I would imagine that casting had to be made quickly.  But if you are still looking for a Chun-Li action film with her trademark blue outfit and muscular thighs, there is always Jackie Chan paroding the character in ""City Hunter"".

Neal McDonough can always play the nefarious villain.  His role on ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""Walking Tall"" are good examples of that.  But to play the role of the evil Bison is another challenge because viewers have a picture in their head of what M. Bison is and how he should be.  I wasn't expecting a similar Raul Julia (from the first ""Street Fighter"") type of Bison with Bison to be in his red garb but to watch Bison in a business suit was a bit surprising and just didn't feel right.

But the video game and film adaption of the characters differ greatly with other characters as well.  Chris Klein as Charlie Nash is another character that greatly differs from its videogame counterpart but there is actually a storyline focused on his character and why he is so driven to go after Bison but it ended up on the deleted scenes portion of this release.  Moon Bloodgood (who I enjoyed in ""Day Break"" and ""Terminator Salvation"") does a good job playing Det. Maya Sunee but also differs from her videogame counterpart  ""Street Fighter IV"" character C.Viper.  The swashbuckling, handsome and egotistical Spanish fighter known as Vega also differs in its film counterpart as The Black Eyed Peas Taboo plays him.  Mainly as a hired thug for Bison.

Michael Clarke Duncan actually compliments the character of Balrog as in the video game, he was just the boxing thug for Bison.  And I actually found Robin Shou's Gen as interesting, definitely casting an older character would not work.  So, overall, I was more accepting of the character of Gen and how he was utilized on the film.

I did enjoy how the casting went into finding Hong Kong actress Josie Ho (""For Bad Boys Only"", ""Purple Storm"") for the role of Cantana and Singapore actor Edmund Chen (""The Eye"") as Xiang. And I did enjoy watching the setting of the film in Bangkok.

Part of the reason that I found the film quite entertaining was the awesome picture and audio quality.  Twentieth Century Fox has been releasing awesome HD transfers for their Blu-ray releases and this is no exception.  ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li - Unleashed and Unrated"" definitely gets a wonderful High Definition transfer and along with the special features included, the addition of the third disc of ""Street Fighter Round One: Fight!"" was a great addition.

I know that there are many differences between the live action film and the video game and of course, to make a film more commercially accepted by the general viewer, difficult choices had to be made.  Especially, considering that the filmmakers didn't have much time to mess around since they had to get the film done within a years time for a US and Japanese release.  In fact, the filmmakers talk about how this film went to the wire in post-production and getting the final cut ready for its theatrical premiere.

But despite the problems I had with the film, by no means is ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li"" the worst video game film ever released.  In fact, there were far more video game live film adaption stinkers out there and this film definitely does not need to be clumped with those.  It's not exactly a film that will receive a lot of praise, especially of its character and storyline difference from the video game.

But I accepted the film to be totally different from the videogame beforehand and that made my viewing experience much more enjoyable.  Especially to hear this film with my sound system and just being impressed by the picture and audio quality (a pleasurable High Definition visual and audio experience can definitely enhance a film's enjoyability) definitely made a big difference.

In the end, is this film worth the blind buy?  It truly depends on the viewer.  For those who enjoyed the film, I can tell you that the Blu-ray High Definition transfer is solid.  I can also tell you that if your a ""Street Fighter"" fan, a third disc (DVD) of the ""Street Fighter Round One: Fight!"" animated comic book is included with the release.

But if you are expecting video game Chun-Li and other characters to come to life on film and be exactly like their video game counterparts, you may be disappointed.  But if you take the film for what it is and see just watch and see how everything plays out knowing it will be different from the video game but still in the ""Street Fighter"" universe, then you may enjoy it.  For the most part, I was not distraught or overtly disappointed by the film.  It's not the greatest and it's not the worst video game film to be made to a live movie.  In the end, I was entertained.",1246579200,18,14849,4.8132387706855795
3721437,1,B001NPD9PE,"I'm a big Mortal Kombat fan and I am glad to see that street fighter has created a sequel that is almost as bad as MK 2. Chris Klien is by far one of the worst actors I have seen on the big screen. I wouldn't blame the editor more than I would have the director and caster, maybe the editor was trying to cover up bad fight scenes and poor camera angles.

How right they were!  This is by far one of the most misguided films I've ever seen.  The phrase ""its so bad its good"" fits this movie perfectly.  When a movie has a flashback of something that happened seconds earlier, unexplained floating magic orbs, and very little to do with the source material, you know you have a ""winner.""

This is partially why I don't give it 1 star.  It really is so bizarrely bad that it is entertaining to see where they take it to next.  And Chris Klein has to be seen to be believed.  He turns just about every line he has into a one-liner, even if it wasn't intended to be so in the script.  Its like a bizarre combination of Keanu Reeves and Mark Wahlburg in the Departed.  He somehow manages to steal the movie with this absolutely ridiculous performance.  I actually was disappointed every time he left the screen after his entrance into the movie.

I openly admit I had a blast watching this at theatres.  It managed the make the 90s movie seem like a masterpiece.  That truly is saying something.  I was stunned, amazed, and laughing out loud throughout the flick.  Its no masterpiece, thats for certain, but its a trainwreck that was actually enjoyable.",1246492800,4,1383,4.485943775100401

It's not entertaining or enjoyable in any way whatsoever and the only thought involved while viewing is how could so bad a film have possibly been made. The characters from the game that actually DO appear in the movie are completely ruined. At least the first one had actors that kinda resembled their video game counterparts. This one might as well have a different name entirely, several of which I would have to censor in order to have this posted. So why bother with this review in the first place? Good question. Watching the film was a waste of time, yet writing about it was satisfying in the sense that a film as bad as this sort of puts things in perspective when you're having a bad day or something.

3721481,4,B001NPD9PE,"The arcade games of the 70s and 80s were rife with storylines that not only developed the game play but led to countless books, comics and late on movies. But for some reason these game films never quite took off. Granted a few were disastrous (HOUSE OF THE DEAD) while others were puff pieces for stars like Jean Claude Van Damme in the first STREET FIGHTER film. Now we have another film to add to the list.- STREET FIGHTER THE LEGEND OF CHUN-LI.

Kristin Kreuk makes the jump from small screen (where she plays Lana Lang on SMALLVILLE) to large in the role of the title character. Beginning with her voice over narration telling us where it all began, we see a young girl who dreams of being a concert pianist. Encouraged by her father, he also trains her in Wushu, a form of martial arts. Good thing because her father is later kidnapped by Bison (Neal McDonough) and his right hand man Balrog (Michael Clarke Duncan).

Years later, the dream is near reality as Chun-Li is about to make her debut as a pianist. But an ancient scroll in Chinese arrives and she finds someone to interpret for her. This interpretation leads her down another path where she is eventually introduced to Gen (Robin Shou) who beings her training in the hopes of helping her find her father and to take on the evil empire being created by Bison.

As this story unfolds we are also given the tale of her father who has been kept a prisoner to help Bison in his plans. His only payment is to get glimpses of his daughter on occasion via pictures and video. We also get to glimpse the true treachery of Bison as he eliminates his competition to take over a vast underground criminal empire.

Not enough story for you? How about an INTERPOL detective played by Chris Klein who is working with a Bangkok detective named Maya Sunee (Moon Bloodgood) to try and take down Bison. Then there's the whole revelation of how Bison came to be as bad as he is that involves ritual murder and his unborn child.  Yes, it may be based on a game but you can't fault the film makers for wanting to have plenty of story.

Chun-Li trains with Gen, learning to harness her anger and delve deep inside to find that power that will make her a formidable opponent. At the same time she sneaks out to learn more about the world around her, Bison and his gang and where she can find her father. The answer to that last part is a sad moment indeed.

A final showdown between the main fighter based characters is inevitable. The skill with which these fights take place ranks high, involving gymnastics, martial arts and wire work that gels nicely. Stars not known for this sort of performance do well in their roles and come out on top.

I am sure that many who played the game will find something to complain about. Either Chun-Li doesn't wear the same outfit of do her hair right or something else. Having never been a big fan of the game I walked away thinking I'd just seen a decent action film with more story than most.

Sure there is a lot of lose ends that seem to be tied up too neatly by the film's end. And a lot of circumstances might be hard to believe. But let's review shall we? The movie...note I said MOVIE...is based on a video game. This is not KING LEAR. It delivers plenty of action, enough martial arts sequences to be acceptable to fans and a fun time for viewers just looking for a bit of escape.

Kreuk does a great job in the lead role, taking on the mantle of Chun-Li as if it were laid out for her long ago. McDonough does his usual despicable bad guy turn and does it well. He truly seems evil. And Robin Shou, who I thought I recognized (he played Lui Kang in the MORTAL KOMBAT films), turns in a fine performance as the mentor who deals with an unwilling pupil who learns and grows as the film progresses.

This film is not high art. It is not deep thought. It is pure fun and entertainment. If you go in thinking this you'll walk away finding a satisfying time. Depending on who else is watching it in your home, the film comes in rated and unrated editions, the unrated offering a tad more blood and violence. But then again, wasn't that what the game was all about? Still, use caution with younger children.

One final note. In deciding whether to give this film 3 or 4 stars I went back to the best question I could come up with. Would I sit down and watch this movie again? The answer being yes made me vote 4 stars. Its not the best film ever, but it was fun to watch.",1246320000,4,4456,4.329736211031175
3721482,1,B001NPD9PE,"This movie is, without a doubt, one of the poorest efforts by hollywood in DECADES.  The plot is ridiculously lame, the villain is the illigitimate love-child of Donald Trump and Michael Flatley (from Riverdance).  Claw-weilding, mask wearing Vega is explained as the ultimate assassin, killing an entire room of asian mafia. 10 minutes later, Vega is taken down by Chun-Li in 2 seconds.

Robin Shou is wearing HORRID ""old man"" makeup. Special effects are cheaper than the worst low budget Sci Fi channel movie. Chun-Li's fireball is literally two frames of animation (the one step up from the 1994 movie, since that movie only had a single white frame as a 'fireball')

I'd rate this movie as zero out of 5 stars, but Amazon won't let me.",1246320000,4,739,4.7952755905511815
3721483,3,B001NPD9PE,"Kristin Kreuk plays Chun-Li, whose father is kidnapped when she is young, and she becomes an inspiring piano player. But when her mother dies, she is lured by a master named Gen played by Robin Shou which seemed kinda interesting that the guy who played Lui Kang in Mortal Kombat is chosen to be her martial arts master.

Bison is played by Neal McDonough who is a crime lord of China who is taking out the heads of the crime bosses and creating crime on Bankok to lower the property values and buy it all up for housing developments.

With a few days training, Chun Li becomes a master of martial art mumbo jumbo and is off to take on Bison and rescue her father. Bisons henchmen consist of Vega and Balrog who is played by Michael Clark Duncan.

All these actors seem to do a decent job of playing believable characters once you get past the idea that Chun Li doesnt even look Chinease.

The downfall comes from two out of place characters who need to be cut from the movie. In some sort of attempt at eye candy they cast Moon Bloodgood to play Det. Maya Sunee, in some scenes you can stand her, but in others it's her co star Chris Klein playing Charlie Nash that makes you want to cringe in there scenes. They seem like the only two that watched the original Street Fighter movie and took inspiration on how to play a bad character from that... tho it could just be the lack of talent of Chris Klein. Either way, if someone could cut there scenes out, the movie would seem a hell of a lot better.

Something different from the movie I like is that Chun Li actually does fight in the streets against villains, you get this feeling she is going to become a super hero vigilante on the street, but soon focuses her direction to stopping Bison and his Shadowlou minions.

The other reviewers here seem to be newer fans to the Street Fighter games and wanted a bunch of stupid cartoon characters with humongous eyes to satisfy there ideas for a SF movie. Being someone who lost interest in the franchise after Super-Dooper Street Fighter II: hyper-turbo-special-champion-gold-remade-for-the-100th-time-mortal-f-o edition, I really could not care less.

Compared to a lot of movies based off a video game, this is one of the much better ones. Give it a rent at least, it's far from the worse movie you will ever see.",1246233600,2,2314,4.508353221957041
3721484,3,B001NPD9PE,"This is a good Street Fighter movie. Chun-Li is dope! Kristin Kreuk does a great job portraying her even though she is mad skinny! If you play street fighter..you should watch this movie. Really, it's that simple :)",1246147200,,215,4.684210526315789
3721485,1,B001NPD9PE,"I very rarely do this with my reviews, but to save you the time of reading about everything wrong with this movie, I'll give you a couple of words to sum it up at the start. This was just awful, really awful. In fact, it was so awful I would rather sit through a 1 and a half hour Matthew McConaughey movie. Now that brief hatred is over, I'll begin to tell you just exactly what I hated about this movie in separated paragraphs. Sort of like bullet points, only filled with 50% more hatred.

The Story: Despite what some of the official plot summaries will have you believe, this is not based on the popular video game franchise. This is simply a movie that has stolen a title and character names in order to try and get more people stupid enough to be drawn in and watch this movie. Unfortunately I was stupid enough. The movie starts with Chun-Li narrating her childhood as she witnesses her father be kidnapped by Bison with the help of his head goon, Balrog. A few years later Chun-Li comes into possession of an ancient Chinese scroll which inspires Chun-Li to find her true self.

Elsewhere, Bison is determined to take over Bangkok by firstly having the heads of the major criminal families murdered. Investigating Bison and the crime are clich American cop types, Charlie Nash & Maya Sunee. She's the feisty pretty one, and he's supposed to be the charming cool type but just ends up coming across as an even more terrible version of Keanu Reeves. Many following events lead to Chun-Li meeting a man who will teach her all she needs to know about finding her true self and eventually seeking revenge on Bison

The Fights: Of course, if you have a movie labelled with the Street Fighter logo, you will be forgiven for expecting a plethora of heart pounding, adrenaline rushed fight sequences. This is why those involved in making this movie can't use the Street Fighter name without fear of a hateful backlash as the fights were just terrible. They were short, badly filmed, badly choreographed and used too many wire supported moves to be even considered credible. Worse still was it didn't even think to utilise the many cool moves the characters had made famous in the video games.

The Cast: OK, I'll admit that I can think of one good thing to say about this film and that is... I liked Neal McDonough as Bison and Michael Clark Duncan as Balrog. They seemed to look the part and if the movie makers didn't try their best to bring these characters and fit them into the real world, this movie could have worked on quite a few levels. Chris Klein as Nash was just horrible. I mentioned a more boring version of Keanu Reeves, and in retrospect, I think that was a bit cruel to Keanu Reeves. Chris Klein's performance in this movie can be used as a means of torture for Guantanamo Bay detainees. It can be used to interrogate suspected terrorists and can even be used to keep Rush Limbaugh at bay. Moon Bloodgood (WTF?) as Maya Sunee worked only as a decent amount of eye candy and nothing more. She served only that purpose and I think that if I were to indulge myself by watching just her scenes, I should fear that I may lose my sight.

The main character of Chun-Li played by Kristin Kreuk was all wrong. I would much rather they had gone for a Chinese born, little known actress than this talentless shard of disappointment. Her fight sequences were dreadful and it is understandable why they didn't last too long as it's obvious she wouldn't have been up for the task. Her narrations made me want to beat her to death with my shoe, or continuously hope that Balrog would get it over with and throw her off a cliff. She was horrible, just horrible. She didn't look the part, didn't act the part and did I mention that she was just horrible? There was one point where they had a go at making her look like her video game counterpart, but she just didn't and I think the director would have had to be a complete dimwit not to notice that, but obviously it will have been too late into the film to recast it, so they stuck with the garbage.

Oh and Taboo from Black Eyed Peas as Vega? What were they thinking?

There's so much that I could ramble on about how this movie is so terrible, but I just don't have the time. All you need to know is that this is possibly the worst movie of the last 5 years, and there's some tough competition for that reward. I believe that this was meant to be the start of a series but hopefully, the financial failure of this will ensure that any sequels will not happen. The Street Fighter franchise is something held dear in many hearts, and this will only seek to tarnish that image. If they had taken the idea of a new Street Fighter movie and kept it in the same bizarre, cartoon world of the games and created a storyline around that, then there's no doubting that it would have been massively enjoyable. I liked the original Van Damme Street Fighter movie, as it was camp, fun and kept itself in that world. It didn't contain an ego and think it could adapt the characters for a real world movie, the makers of the original kept it in that world and didn't let their ego's influence any insane belief that they could create a Street Fighter story that would fix itself in the real world.

Stay away from this, it's for the best.",1246147200,7,5278,4.422839506172839
3721486,1,B001NPD9PE,"Capcom's Street Fighter games will always have a special place in my heart, which makes it all the more sad whenever Capcom's long running and massively successful franchise makes the jump to the screen.  A majority of the various Street Fighter animes have been decent, but the debacle to end all debacles occured in the mid-90s with the first live-action Street Fighter flick, which starred Jean-Claude Van Damme and Raul Julia.  Well, after watching Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li, you'll be longing for the Muscles from Brussels.  Directed by Doom and Romeo Must Die helmer Andrzej Bartkowiak, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li focuses on the title character (played by Smallville's Kristin Kreuk) as she hunts down her father's attackers.  Seeing various Street Fighter characters like Chun-Li, Bison (Neal McDonough), Balrog (Michael Clarke Duncan), Vega (Taboo), Charlie Nash (Chris Klein), and Gen (Robin Shou) get mishandled is one thing, but when there aren't any decent moments of action to speak of is something else entirely.  The entire film as a whole is just boring and incredibly uninspired, from the fight scenes to the actors themselves.  The kung-fu flick cliches don't help matters either, and neither does the fact that Kreuk, while indeed gorgeous, just doesn't have what it takes to hold your interest.  All in all, no matter how much of a Street Fighter fan you may be, you'll more than likely wind up seeing Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li at some point, but by all means, avoid it if you can.",1245024000,10,1536,5.0236220472440944

I on the other hand have played the game but was not as into it as other gamers, So I went into this movie expecting another hot action film and that is exactly what I got! There is a lot of wire work but its no worse then other movies that are out now! The lead Kristin Kreuk is hottness, and her acting is raised pretty high if you put her up against her co-stars! Shes the light that shines in this movie. The fact that she did pretty much all of her own stunt work just adds to the pot! It's a female taking control, a female ruling the screen and a female kicking butt and thats what I love to see in my action films! The movie was geared towards gamers but a girl like myself who enjoys watching actions films such as Tomb Raider, Underworld where women are strong, Independent, kicking butts and taking names, this movie can easily join the list...my list and will! If you pay attention to only the negative reviews (1 star & 2 stars) and you've never seen it before you are going to automatically have their negativity inplanted. I say read the positives first, watch it and come up with your own conclusion!

It followed in the tradition of the slightly cheesy, martial arts movies based on video games from the 90s, and if you are just looking for great choreography and nicely done fight scenes, then it will not disappoint.  This movie differs from the Mortal Kombat movies in that it does not rely too heavily on CGI abilities, only one or two abilities that are dependent upon graphics, with the emphasis being on the actual fighting techniques.
