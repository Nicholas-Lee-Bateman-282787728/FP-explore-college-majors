8276600,5,0967500478,"Hi all

As always, I enjoy not once but many times each time I watch at Tour de France DVDs but I would rather prefer a 12 hrs DVD set, this is too short, thats the only thing I would suggest, the rest is just excellent for spinning while watching, for motivating porposes and for collection

8276601,2,0967500478,"Wow, imagine trying to watch Lance Armstrong win an exciting mountain stage of the Tour while some synthesizer/porno music that is so loud you can't even hear the inane commentary of Phil Liggett or Paul Sherwin plays over the imagery? Well, this is what watching this DVD is like. And just as inexplicably as this ""music"" begins it sometimes, blessedly, ends. Sometimes it ends before the best part of the stage is over and sometimes not. Apparently the production team was high when they dumped this garbage on top of the video, or they were watching a porno and just happened to record some of the music. Either way, you'll have a hard time ignoring it. I say to myself, how dumb do people really have to be to think that something like this is actually a good idea? Well, look at who's president.

8276602,5,0967500478,"This is a DVD you must have if you like cycling and especially the tour de France. You get a good impression on how beautifull the Alpes and the Pyrenees are and how hard it is to clim these mountains.  Of course Lance Armstrong is the central figure on this DVD, and he deserves it.",1027555200,10,283,4.1454545454545455
