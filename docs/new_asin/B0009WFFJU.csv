8068032,4,B0009WFFJU,"I don't believe I have ever seen a better performance than the one Betty Buckley delivers here.  This is a lifer.  Professionals should study this.  Too bad she isn't in more of it.  Brilliant.  I had no idea.

Actually, at least half the acting in this film really is excellent.  I think someone else also mentioned that in an earlier review.

In my opinion, that's the reason to see it.  Be wide awake when you start it, though, as other reviewers have also referenced in some form, you may miss the best parts due to slumber, and the flow is inconsistent, maybe intentionally due to the circumstance.  In any case, because of some exceptional lessons in (or insight into) acting, I'll go with four stars anyway.",1200096000,4,714,4.595238095238095
8068033,4,B0009WFFJU,"This film was pretty much one long indoor scene in the diner and anyone who says it viewed like a play is right.  It did and it seemed like a very good play.  Clare Kramer was great in this movie.  Lori Heuring was also very good, but I thought maybe a bit too pretty for the part she was playing.  well, not a bit too pretty - A lot too pretty.  I will be honest...I loved this film.  Sarah arrives at this diner and begins a weird conversation and relationship with a young woman running the diner (Lori Huering).  Sarah then meets mom (played by Betty Buckley) who is a real piece of work then she meets the two boys.  Sarah goes through a lot in this movie emotionally. It was quirky, dark and obviously not for everyone, but it was moody,and suspenseful.  It had good performances from every member of the cast.  Not a lot of action, but enough.  One line though really stood out:  ""I have no hopes.""  that was sad.  Sad, but true...sigh.",1179446400,5,943,4.284090909090909
8068034,4,B0009WFFJU,"I guess I was expecting a horror or thriller type film and this was neither, or was it?  I'm a big fan of Klare Kramer and with Betty Buckley in it as well I gave it a try.

  It starts out with an attractive woman driving through the deserted country on a stormy night.  She ends up at a roadside cafe and thus begins a tale that slowly (much too slowly), unravels a history of incest, rape, murder and insanity.  She has stumbled on this odd bar/cafe at random and begins meeting it's inhabitants.

  It was a quirky, uneven movie and I felt like I was watching a play most of the time.  That was explained in the extras when I learned it was based on a stage play.

  The family that runs this little cafe puts a new twist on the term DYSFUNTIONAL!  The acting is excellent, the mood creepy but again it seemed to drag on too long.  The last 15 minutes when all the truths are exposed were the most interesting.  Was our heroine's arrival so random? Where did the mummy come from?  What is Ma's big secret?  Why does the younger man look so familiar?(Pay attention to the credits for that one).

  If you like plays, movies that make you think, or just oddities, try this movie.  But be prepared for the sllloooww pacing.",1157328000,9,1224,4.276315789473684
8068035,1,B0009WFFJU,For a little I thought I was in for some Texas Chainsaw type of movie. But this movie was basically about a screwed up family. That was a hiding a secret,1133222400,,153,3.967741935483871
8068036,1,B0009WFFJU,"This film reminds me of some horribly written stage play. What is Betty Buckley doing in this mess? Actually, I would give it zero stars.",1123804800,3,137,4.52
