7847651,5,6303451632,"Wondering how it all might go down at the end? This may be an accurate depiction of the end of the world as predicted by Nostradamus. Giant bugs, kooky sailboat death cults, and a beautiful love story make this a story for the ages. Gouge out your critical eye and remember how movies used to be made. With creativity and art! A VHS treasure. Don't let it pass you by.",1487548800,,368,4.271428571428571

7847653,3,6303451632,"When Godzilla waned in l975, Toho Studios took on more enviromental themes for films, with the ""monsters"" being pollution and the effects of war. In 1974 they did a ""follow up"" to the highly successful SUBMERGENCE OF JAPAN(1973) by remaking(loosely) the l961 film THE LAST WAR, this time as PROPHECIES OF NOSTRODAMUS. It's an ambitious and impressive film in it's original cut. However, the now defunct UPA acquired the film sometime in the late 70's and recut it down to 90 minutes, re-framing it completely, and calling it THE LAST DAYS OF PLANET EARTH and in essence turning it into a docu-drama complete with a narration akin to the old Sun Classic Films. It was obvious UPA wanted to cash in on the wild and truly questionable ""docu-dramas"" of the 70's such as THE LATE GREAT PLANET EARTH, CHARIOTS OF THE GODS and THE SEARCH FOR NOAH'S ARK all of which were part of the time of he mid 70's.  The result of the editing is an uneven mess, a skeleton of a film much more epic in scope. Oddly, the very scenes which got the film banned in Japan after it's release, are included in the truncated US release! The stand out scene and it's genuinely weird and creepy involves two mutant/human things who fight over a worm on a blasted nuclearscape. This scene alone made the film on Laser Disk highly sought after in Japan-even as a full frame, dubbed movie!

The film never showed in theaters as a general release here, UPA syndicated it to independent TV stations in the early 80's onward. It showed up regularly for instance on the old TNT on late night or on their old ""Monstervision"" show.

A film very much of it's time.",1123286400,9,1624,4.554794520547945
