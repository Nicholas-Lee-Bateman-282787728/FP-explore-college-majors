1563379,5,B00005JPK8,"Chris Brown was RAW in this movie even though he died 5min in the movie. Dances was RAW. Meagan Good, one word SEXY. I wish I can be in this movie",1172361600,3,146,3.7419354838709675
1563380,3,B00005JPK8,"Okay folks, if you've seen Drumline, you've seen this already. Just substitute stepping (and ""krumping""-the street dancing of the West Coast) with Black marching show bands and you get the idea.

The stepping (which the film does NOT acknowledge as having its roots among the gumboots and ""careful treading"" styles of the Zulus of South Africa) and Krump dancing scenes are entertaining. But as for the story, you've seen it all before. Arrogant street punk goes to college and learns the meaning of friendship, love and teamwork, etc. etc.

It is true that the only similarities between this film and ""School Daze"" are that stepping is shown (in only one scene in ""School Daze"") and they are both based at fictional Black colleges in Atlanta. The only reason I really liked School Daze THEN was because I was in college at the time and could relate to it. From a perspective of some 20 years, I realize now that it wasn't that hot. This film likewise will find its biggest audience among the college crowd and the hiphoppers. As Jerry Seinfeld would say, ""Not that there's anything wrong with that.""",1171929600,2,1100,4.78421052631579
1563381,5,B00005JPK8,"Hip-Hop and CRUNK dancing has becoming a growing influence in the black culture and this movie excels in showing that influence. The plot is very typical, someone loses a love one, person goes off in search of self for redemption, falls for local hothead's hottie, gets in trouble for it, and comes back to save the day and get the girl.

 The untypical style to this movie,is that it included some of the hottest dancing you've seen in awhile in a 'dance movie'. 'You got served' came close to this, and 'Step Up' was to me under the version of what this movie accomplished in showcasing raw talent. When they show you that even an overweight jerk can get into a groove and dance his butt off, thats a good dance movie.

 It had some good social issues where, Columbus Short's character had to learn more bout doing for others than for himself, and learn that respect for the two is a tangle web of give and take.

 Someone posted bout Good dancing, Poor Fraternity movie?!?! If you thought the movie plot was bout fraternities you are - errrr wrong!! The fraternity aspect was brought in to sell the prospect of you growing beyond your own little bubble and learning that if you help others share with others, the results you all can share will be better.

 Cant wait for it to be on DVD, and big ups for everyone who made it the #1 boxoffice movie in its first week out, when alot of critics had snubbed, belittled and written off this majority black cast film.",1170115200,3,1464,4.456928838951311
1563382,4,B00005JPK8,"After his younger brother Duron is killed following a misunderstand with a rival dance team, Los Angeles native DJ moves to Atlanta to live with his aunt and uncle. His aunt works as a real estate agent and his uncle works as a groundskeeper at hisotrically-black college Truth University, where DJ enrolls in school. College has never been DJ's goal, but he goes because Duron wanted to graduate from college and because he feels responsble for Duron's death.

Almost immediately after arriving on the campus of fictional Truth University, DJ realizes the south is nothing like LA. When he sees a beautiful girl (Meagan Good) that he simply has to talk to, he makes the mistake of breaking the invisible line created by one of the fraternity step teams and is immediately put in his place by Sylvester, head of Theta Nu Theta. DJ quickly learns that Theta Nu has been in a vicious battle with rival fraternity Mu Gamma for the last seven years to see who will be crowned the national step champion. Theta Nu has lost the last seven years in a row--and DJ has lost the girl he wanted to talk to.

It just so happens that the girl, April, happens to be dating Grant, second-in-command with Mu Gamma. When DJ sees the way that Grant treats April, walking all over her and making her feel like she's lucky to be with him, he decides to put him in his place. Breaking out all of his moves from his LA dance battling days, DJ pretty much serves Grant in front of all of the Truth students at a dance club one night. Though he's embarrassed that he got served, Grant has grudging respect for DJ and tries to recruit him to join Mu Gamma. Then DJ spews my favorite line of the whole film, ""I don't step. I battle."" And you just know it's going to be on from that point.

Long story short, DJ's roommate convinces him that joining a black fraternity is about more than just stepping. It's about honor, history, and being a part of something bigger than yourself. He convinces DJ to join Theta Nu with him, with the hope that DJ's fresh moves will bring the Theta Nu step team out of the dark ages.

Stomp the Yard is a must-see for anyone who enjoys teen dance movies like Honey and You Got Served. Yes, the plot does bear some resemblance to YGS, with the addition of a college campus and a sense of purpose to take the place of drug deals and gang violence. Columbus Short (who plays DJ and is a former backup dancer for Britney Spears) dances his [...] for most of the film, and I've got to say the dance sequences were way better in this film than in YGS. In fact, there were a lot of familiar faces if you're into hip hop and R&B with DJ's roommate played by young star Ne-Yo and his younger brother by Chris Brown of ""Run It"" fame. Additionally, it was nice to see a movie targeted at young people where the romance was used as a nice backdrop to the real plot of the movie instead of its sole focus.

If you're interested in an ""urban"" movie with great dance sequences and people getting served that isn't just about life on the streets, Stomp The Yard should be right up your alley.",1169769600,3,3082,4.371727748691099
1563383,3,B00005JPK8,"I agree with Kurupt: If you've seen ""You've Got Served"" and/or ""Drumline"" then you've already seen ""Stomp The Yard."" The plots are very similiar. And if you've seen ""ATL"" and remember the conflict with NuNu and her father, you'll find a similiar conflict with Megan Good's character and her father in this movie. Other than that the music was just okay and the dancing was great- it was like watching a music video. The only similarities ""STY"" has with ""School Daze"" is that both deal with fraternities on HBCU campuses and that's pretty much it; ""School Daze"" has more depth to it. Overall, ""STY"" is a fun, entertaining movie geared towards the younger crowd. Even though Chris Brown wasn't in the movie for long, he did a good job and I'd like to see him in more movies.",1169769600,3,772,4.601449275362318
1563384,2,B00005JPK8,"I was taken to see this movie by a female friend of mine. I didn't know anything about the movie except that there would be stepping in it and a fraternity story tied into it. So of course I expected to see a movie that was right along the lines of school daze. Totally wrong!!!!! Stomp the yard should have been named You got served 2 or drumline 2 because it was more focused on dancing than on Frat life and stepping. The average  age in the movie theater was around 14 years of age so this movie really wasn't geared toward a 30 year black greek. When stepping was shown, (which wasn't a lot of the movie) the scenes were decent. I was more impressed with the B-Boy dance scenes when the actors were break dancing. I made sure to ask some friends of mine that are in other frats (alphas, ques) what they thought of  the movie and they all felt the same as me. The movie did not show the positive aspects of the frat (community service, mentoring) and only made it look like frats are about partying and dancing. For an outsider looking in you will probably think that this movie is great. But if you know anything about frats or you are in a frat/sorority you most likely won't like it. Yo! to the NUPES!",1169596800,9,1208,4.247826086956522
1563385,3,B00005JPK8,"""Stomp The Yard"" is an easy mark for critics. It's a glorified music video that features lines like: ""You're not good enough for my daughter!"" It's set at a university, but nobody attends a class.

It also has energy, sincerity, pluck and performance lust. And a guy named Columbus Short. He looks good, he can dance, and he has it. His lead character is a walking clich, but Short, with a look or a smirk or a mumbled insult, injects a little mystery where there shouldn`t be any. It's hard to decipher cool, but Short is, and ""Stomp The Yard"" burns his wick to its advantage.

Short is DJ, a hip-hop ""battle"" dancer from Los Angeles who specializes, from the look of it, in ""crunking,"" a hyper kinetic series of violent-yet-rhythmic convulsions that culminates in a leap, flip or some other form of levitation. The movie opens with a battle-gone-bad, as DJ watches a dance rival murder his brother Davon (Chris Brown, in a cameo).

DJ is sent to Atlanta to attend Truth University - a historical black college - under the eye of his uncle (Harry Lennix), a campus landscaper. At Truth, the scene revolves around two fraternities that field teams in stepping. If you've seen ""Stomp!"", you seen stepping. It's a choreographed dance-and-chant performance that grows more elaborate as the movie progresses.

Both frats want DJ. DJ wants a cute girl named April (Meagan Good). April dates the captain of one of the teams, who doesn't like DJ, who finally decides to pledge with the underdog, while learning to be part of a team, as the girl begins to fall for him...

OK, look. The story's a shaggy dog. But it doesn't apologize for it, and the performances lack the self-consciousness found in ""Dreamgirls.""  The dance scenes, directed by Sylvain White, are terrific. Especially the opening battle, which combines ""You've Got Served"" with the grit of the stage in ""8 Mile.""

Short is such a veteran of ""Stomp!"" and dance he could perform half these routines sedated. But he also gives DJ a quiet, impressive certitude. Short has more than the charm of the misunderstood thug - he's sly and understated. DJ's courtship of April isn't frantic, nor exploitative. Good  flounces around with her breasts all bunched up and exposed, but she's a good-natured movie vixen otherwise.

White delays the climactic stepping competition with plot nonsense for a half-hour before DJ and his team finally deliver the dance moves. The musical production seems right out of a Bollywood musical (or a Wes Anderson film) but, somehow, this seems in line with the movie's spirit. Happy. Passionate. Sweaty.

In a performance film, give me exuberance over calculation. And ""Stomp The Yard"" over the acclaimed ""Dreamgirls."" Any day of the week.",1169337600,4,2720,4.8806941431670285

1563786,4,B00005JPK8,"It's not an award-winning film (that I know of), but it's a lot of fun.

STOMP THE YARD (Sylvan White, 2007) is the story of a street dancer from LA (Columbus Short) who gets sent to a fictional Historically Black University after his equally talented brother gets killed while competing, where he gets drafted into the local fraternity rivalry because of his impressive dancing ability.  He doesn't think much of frat life at first, until a gorgeous coed (Meagan Good) opens his eyes and heart to it, inspiring him to join the perpetual underdog Theta Nu Theta in their quest to defeat their seven time champion step show rival Mu Gamma Xis.  Thought DJ (Short) has talent, old rival forces behind the scenes, long predating his arrival at school conspire to keep him and the Thetas from ever achieving victory.  Can DJ overcome these obstacles by successfully ""stomping the yard (dancing)?""  That's the film.

And it's admittedly a very predictable one, with a story whose twists and turns and outcome you can pretty much see coming a mile away.  But as I always say with movies like this, it's not about the story, but about the execution, and STOMP THE YARD has that in spades.  The dancing is spectacular, the directing is reasonably good, and the cast is really talented.  If you like this sort of thing, of if you enjoy dancing and dance movies in general, you will definitely get what you pay for.  STOMP THE YARD is fun, the music is great, and it has a noble heart to it that deserves mention, making it a cut above other movies in this genre.  Check it out!",1446422400,2,1568,4.60431654676259

1564392,5,B00005JPK8,"When DJ's brother was tragically gunned down( played by Chris Brown ) in the beginning of the movie, he moves to another state which is a clean slate to be with his relatives: Atlanta, Georgia. On there, DJ, a character played by Columbus Short went to an all Black historical college Truth University. DJ was from L.A. and when he moved to Atlanta with his uncle and aunt, that suddenly changed. One thing is when you're ready to go to Truth, there's brotherhood is always there for you. First, Mu Gamma Xi, a crew led by Grant ( Darrin Henson ) who won seven times easily and the president of Mu Gamma is Zeke ( Laz Alonzo ). As soon as the beef comes between DJ and Grant after DJ schoolling him, Theta Nu Theta's leader Sylvester ( played by Brian White ) came to DJ's rescue. When DJ turned down on Mu Gamma Xi, he went to the Theta crew along with Rich (Ne-Yo) and Noel (Jermaine Williams) joning with DJ. Meagan Good, who plays April (DJ's love interest) finally saved the movie when Theta Nu & Mu Gamma faces head to head for the competition. What I do love about the movie is the hardcore move: Krumping! April's father Dr William Palmer wasn't interested with DJ because he's a troublemaker thanks to DJ's rivalries Grant and Zeke. But that didn't stop it, April and DJ's aunt Jackie (played by the sweetest Valarie Pettiford) came to DJ's rescue for the second time. Final scene is the greatest scene in my opinion when Theta Nu Theta win that competition for the better. Stomp The Yard is 100% excellent with much more extravaganza and Stepping is the one who does it all for the rest. You gotta love the Martin Luther King's quote before the closing credits. Huge music, huge scenes, huge dancing, huge battle and extremely.....HUGE MOVIE. You got to see this movie if you had You Got Served.",1380240000,,1805,4.48936170212766

1564458,3,B00005JPK8,"Great choreography and dance sequences. I also like that this film tries to shed light on one subculture's social life at historically Black colleges. As is with so many typical Hollywood productions, lots of focus is on the protagonist's love interest, and there's lots of 'bad boy' male ego and aggression, blah blah blah... The plot is predictable and formulaic - not much in the way of suspense, tension, or surprise. The level of this film is about that of most middle school students, though some parents might object to those elements that helped it get an 'R' rating. I do wish that this film tried more to draw the viewer in to college life (and higher education in general) for Southern Blacks; that was the piece that interested me the most.

(Just kidding) but it is a movie that I will never get tired of because to me it is one of the movies where you can watch it over and over again and feel like you are almost being manipulated into watching it so many times. That is litterally how good the dancing is. Not to mention being a female and seeing handsome men workout makes it that much better but that is beside the point. I do not notice any flaws and because of this movie, not only has chris brown I think grown in acting skills but Brian white is also now one of my favorite actors after seeing him in the movie ""Fighting"" but also Columbus Short is a really good actor as well. They both can pull off a position, any one given to them and they can do it. Definitely keeping this one on my kindle.",1349136000,,836,4.042168674698795
1564533,4,B00005JPK8,"I write this review as a GDI (BGLO speak for well...somebody who isn't a member of a Black Greek Letter Org). I have however aspired to join one after attending my 1st Howard U. parade 12yrs ago. Of course, over the yrs I grew to learn that BGLOs are about much more than stepping, having attended many events & probates hosted by the different orgs. but stepping will always be a part of the history, tradition & culture of Black Greek Life. That being said, I was ecstatic about this movie & made sure that I was one of the 1st in line for a ticket on opening night. I know that Hollywood is all about what's going to entertain and box office statistics but it didn't take long before I realized that it wasn't going to be a amazing portrayal of Black Fraternities and Sororities...not at all. First off, I have never in my life seen two orgs present new members at the same time. Maybe on the same day, at different times that may overlap but that's it. Secondly, it's no secret that some chapters in all 9 orgs still haze but at least they could've offset the negative with a positive like hmmmm I don't know...the vast amount of community involvement and their collective purposes/what they stand for. They did at least pay respect to some of their more notable members such as Maya Angelou and Dr, Martin Luther King Jr. Another thing I just have to mention is that I felt like I was watching ""You Got Served"" or one of the ""Step Up"" movies. While there's no doubt Columbus Short is a good dancer and choreographer, there was just TOO much dancing!! Considering that the writers and producers are men of Alpha Phi Alpha, Inc, I was surprised that they didn't push for a more accurate portrayal. All in all, if you want a movie to get you hype about dancing and [somewhat] the art of Stepping, here you go. But if you're using the movie itself to decide whether or not to pursue membership, do some REAL research or you're probably not going to get very far.",1347062400,2,1963,4.410468319559229

1564685,4,B00005JPK8,"Yeah, I'm kind of shocked too.  I mean, I like stuff like this sometimes, but as a rule I usually avoid these kinds of films.  It just so happened that my wife was sick and in bed this weekend and happened to watch this film simply because there was nothing else on.  I came in about halfway through and it sparked my interest, so I made her rewind and we watched it together.

I'd watch it again.

The story is very much `Romeo + Juliet' meets `Drumline', with MTV editing and a whole lot of `stank face', but that combination works rather well here.  I wasn't a fan of `Drumline', but this one kept my attention.

When DJ's brother is shot and killed, he finds himself living with his aunt and uncle.  Hoping for a better life, with a good education, DJ's uncle pulls some strings and gets him into Truth University.  Immediately, DJ finds that he doesn't quite fit in, or maybe it's that he fits in too well.  He makes rivals with an arrogant `stepper' named Grant who happens to be dating mega-hottie April, who seems to have eyes for DJ.  When DJ is pressured to pledge with the fraternity Grant is a member of, he opts to join his rival, using their tradition of `step' competitions (an aggressive hip-hop, krump-like dance style) as a way to `battle' his new adversary.  All the while, DJ is pining for April's affections, causing issues with DJ's education, especially when her father gets word and pushes to have DJ expelled.

But love, and dance, prevail.

The storyline is a tad overdone, but it works here thanks to some high intensity dance sequences, some really good acting and some sizzling chemistry.  Columbus Short can dance and act, which is a plus here.  He has a `Vin Deisel' baritone and a smooth delivery (not to mention some modelesque good looks) that makes him rather irresistible, and his screen partner (the ubber-gorgeous Meagan Good) is more than enough hotness to make them a tantalizing couple.  You just WANT to watch them.  Darrin Henson is a pretty bad actor, but he's a convincing dancer, so he's forgivable.  I really liked Brian White here too.  He has a suave yet commanding presence.

And then you have the killer dance scenes that just get better and better as the film progresses.

Yes, `Stomp the Yard' is brainless at times and even a tad corny (the forced sense of `tension' in the films finale is rather laughable) but it also has rare and unexpected moments of touching and moving `heart' (the ""I love you"" even made my wife go ""WOW"") and for a film claiming to offer a fun, good time, `Stomp the Yard' definitely does what it sets out to do.",1269216000,,2590,4.536637931034483
1564686,5,B00005JPK8,"STOMP THE YARD... A riveting, musical/dance extravaganza!  The plot is captivating; acting is competent/compelling; and dance is mesmeric.

But his efforts to get an education and woo the girl he likes are sidelined when he is courted by the top two campus fraternities, both of which want and need his fierce street-style dance moves to win the highly coveted national step show competition.
I really enjoyed this movie, and I appreciated the fact that lessons could be learned from such a movie. In my opinion it is a must see if you want a refreshing change.

1564693,3,B00005JPK8,"The choreography is visually impressive and carries a mostly plodding script on tragedy, redemption and the power of friendship/love which centers on DJ Williams (Columbus Short) and his journey from Los Angeles to Truth University in Atlanta.

Williams is torn from his family after an evening that goes terribly wrong - his brother is murdered in the aftermath of an underground krumping competition - and his mother sends him to Atlanta to live with an aunt and uncle.

There is tension on the campus grounds as Williams pursues his love interest, April Palmer (Meagan Good), while attempting to achieve new personal growth, though his talent in dancing may ultimately prove to be the path to triumph.

The morality play has no real twists that would keep the ending in suspense, though the message of doing the right thing - no matter what the odds - is refreshing.",1229385600,,869,4.8979591836734695

The story was very well done and the characters show immense growth.  DJ goes from ""all about me"" to a ""team"" player, even swallowing his pride to do so.  April went from an insecure girl who was just hanging on to 'big man on campus' to please others to a woman who made her own choices for herself.  And Grant, the nemesis of the movie was consistently shown up for his underhanded and too controlling ways.

The dancing/stepping was awesome and a beautifully primal example of the fullness of being alive.  The beats were all culturally significant and hinted at the old spirituals of days gone by.  In a sense they spoke to the same strengths of the people.

Columbus Short was really an amazing dancer.  I'd watch him again and again.

I think that even though this story was about African Americans and the dances were predominantly from that culture, the story and the moral of the story transcends any race.  It's about respecting each other, about love, about teamwork and about being your best.

1564814,3,B00005JPK8,"I saw the previews for this movie and was enticed by the soundtrack of the movie.  I figured that if there was anything else good about it then that would only be a bonus.

Well, I found little else to get excited about.

First of all, the music was not disappointing.  When I cranked up my home theater I not only heard the music but felt it.  I really enjoyed the beat, rhythm, and tempo.  But I think I would have been better off if I had just fast forwarded through the rest of the movie.

There is a love story, but it is unrealistic and, at best, silly.  There was the whole emotional thing about the main character's brother, but the main character really didn't seem to have much trouble putting that stuff behind him except for one scene that was completely comical (""Do it for your brother!?!?!?"") and obviously written where the director was expecting an Oscar or something.  There was the Fraternity thing about brotherhood and togetherness, but it was touched on so lightly that it just became background noise.  Good grades and education?  Hardly mentioned.  Hard work?  Same.  And if there are any rules to ""stepping"" or ""stomping"" or ""battling"" or whatever they want to call it, I had trouble following it.  The only rule that made sense was that the winner was the one/group who made the audience most excited.  But I was struck how little, stupid, mindless silly things would get them excited.  So..... *shrug*

It got so bad that my wife couldn't take it anymore after about 2/3rds of the movie and pretty much fell into a Mystery Science Theater 3000 movie mockery which is entirely not like her.  But I couldn't blame her, it was the only way to make the movie interesting.

So, if you love a killer soundtrack with a great beat then pick it up for that.  If you are looking for a touching, life altering story that will stir the emotions and inspire your spirits... this isn't it.  There are better ways to spend two hours.",1183680000,,1945,4.528735632183908

1564816,2,B00005JPK8,"""Stomp the Yard"" is a film that exists solely for its dancing.  All else is mere filler.  That includes the plot, which revolves around a young L.A. street dancer named D.J. (Columbus Short) who enrolls in Atlanta's Truth University and immediately finds himself caught up in the rivalry between two fraternities specializing in what is called competitive ""stomp"" dancing.  The film also chronicles the lovelorn lad's near-stalker-like efforts to woo April (Meagan Good), the provost's beautiful daughter, despite the fact that she is already going out with a self-centered, super creep of a boyfriend (Darrin Dewitt Henson), who also happens to be one of the leaders of a rival fraternity.

Although the plot complications are relatively straightforward and easy to follow, you just might want to keep a ""street slang-to-English"" dictionary handy to help you through some of the dialogue.  Unfortunately, the predictability of the storyline and the triteness of the romantic entanglements pretty much vitiate the attractive novelty of the context and setting.

That pretty much leaves just the dancing, which isn't all that terrific, actually, thanks to the frenetic, hurdy-gurdy quality of the editing, which breaks up the movements and prevents the dancers from establishing a smooth-flowing rhythm and style.  We see their dance routines only in fragmented bits and pieces, a technique that does little justice to the vision and hard work of the performers, who clearly possess an impressive store of untapped energy and talent.  At least that's more than can be said for the acting, which ranges in quality from the merely passable to the distressingly amateurish.

There are moments of inspirational racial pride sprinkled in among the melodrama and dance sequences, but they are quickly swept away by the contrivances and cliches that ultimately inundate the film.

The best thing about it is when it touched on history of university educated Black men and women, so for that alone I am giving 3 stars.  The rest of the movie rated lower in my opinion.

I thought the story was trite and had a lot of holes in it.  But who cares, that is secondary to wanting to see the Stomping.  Some of the dance scenes were good but there is a lot of flashing light so you can't even see the real action -- not a good sign.  The big ending seems unrealistic, does a fraternity really put together a rock star show with smoke and blacklights?  The ending scene reminded me of -- horrors -- the disney movie, Jump In.  In fact, the story line in Stomp the Yard is a lot like Jump In, just more corny and fake.  The only good thing was the honor of the guys in the fraternity.  But everyone else is a scumbucket, even the university leaders, that's weak.

If you want to see a really really good movie with hot moves and poignancy try The ATL (also set in Atlanta).  ATL also has a guy going to college.  The love story is similar but better told.  The moves are more real, and I have never seen the team skate thing - it's hot.  It is just a way better movie of this type and hasn't got the attention it deserves.

After dancing in a battle and winning a hat full of money Dj ""Columbus Short"", his brother ""Chris Brown"" and his team beat the wrong team this time. While walking home in a dark alley the other team jumped them to get their money back but bad turns to worst and DJ's brother is shot and killed. DJ is sent to live with his Uncle and aunt in Atlanta and is expected to go to college. When he arrives on campus he sees some things he's never seen before like fraternities and stepping and it's all downhill from there. During this film DJ learns things that boys need to learn to become men especially love and even gets to do what he loves most while he's there. He ends up becoming a major key to one frat in dieing need of something fresh.

The first time I saw the preview for ""Stomp the Yard"" I automatically thought, ""Wow, the stepping version of Drumline"" but at the same time I felt it would be pretty good. Though this movie does resemble Drumline the story differs a bit. The first being ""Darrin Henson"" (Soul Food the series) who is a good actor but a dancer and choreographer first and I would say a better choreographer than actor since he probably makes more money off of it. Of course the others being ""Chris Brown"" and ""Columbus Short"", most of the cast are dancers acting unlike ""Drumline"" where Nick Cannon was an actor who had to learn how to play the drums. Even the two frats remind you of ""Drumline"" one frat has an old school style and hasn't won in 7 years and the other has a grimey aggressive new shchool that never loses.

Darrin played his character well and though Chris Brown wasn't in there that long he did ok but Columbus Short danced better than he acted and it took a little from the movie. He didn't show the same feeling and emotion in his acting as he did in his dancing. You can see this in the film when he loosens up when he dances and then starts to get really tight when he goes back to acting. There was only one big problem I had with ""Stomp the Yard"", the first being how the story is told. In the middle of the movie when DJ is pledging to get into a fraternity his pledging is basically skipped and he's in.

The stepping and overall choreography is amazing and gets better towards the end of the film. The acting was cool as well as the story but still the dancing outshines them. The history told in this movie makes me proud and gives the movie that extra something. It would've been really cool though if they shined a little more light on where stepping came from and why it's so important in black colleges today. Overall this is a very good movie that was made very well but I have to say that I think women will enjoy this more than guys, when you see it you'll know what I mean.",1179705600,12,2844,4.262962962962963

1564986,4,B00005JPK8,"STOMP THE YARD comes as a pleasant surprise to those of us who have yet to be introduced to 'stepping' - a sport/dance form that is not break dancing, not hip-hop, not modern dance, not clogging, not ballet, but instead is an exhilarating display of rhythm, physical dexterity, and creative choreography that makes this little film well worth watching.

The story is minimal and hackneyed and serves basically as an outline for the dance performances.  DJ (the enormously talented dancer/actor Columbus Short) is sent from Los Angeles to Atlanta's Truth University after his conviction for street brawling, a fight in which his brother (Chris Brown) was killed. Once on campus DJ is works for his uncle as a gardener and is soon courted for his step dance skills by two rival fraternities. One fraternity gains DJ's attention and he pledges. Of course there is the requisite love conflict (the beautiful Meagan Good as April), who just happens to be the girlfriend of the rival fraternity step leader (Darrin Henson), and the usual undercurrent of familial dichotomies between DJ's humble background and April's influential father bring the tension to the front: the result is DJ's triumphant performance in the annual stepping competition between the two fraternities.  The ending is predictable but sensitive and with a message.

The real star of the film is the magnificently choreographed and executed dancing, performed by the actual cast members.  Director Sylvain White and his choreographers center their attention on the big sequences and the result is very fine entertainment.  In addition to the gifted Columbus Short and Darrin Henson the cast includes such fine actor/dancers as Brian J. White, Ne-Yo, Laz Alonzo, Oliver Ryan Best, Richmond Duain Martyn, Justin Hires, and many others.  It is difficult to resist the excitement of the commitment of this fine cast to the introduction of step dancing to the public at large. So much talent! Grady Harp, May 07",1179619200,7,1971,5.140625

Now I know this movie takes from Drumline, You Got Served, etc.  But really, I saw more similarities to another movie.

What I took away was an incredible respect for those who built Truth University, and the famous people who attended that school.  Also, the big message to me was integrity.  Being honest to and with yourself.  And of course, there's no ""I"" in ""TEAM"".

1564993,5,B00005JPK8,"I personally thought that Stomp the Yard was a great Movie Everything about it was great. It so sad to see that people can never give credit where it due. Stomp the Yard was a good movie i mean what more could you expect from the title.  It did remind you of other movies like Drumline, You got Searved and Maybe even Step up but you cant look at those and expect to get the same thing out of it  or even talk bad on because it wasn't what you WANTED to be. To me the movie touched in to a little bit of everything romance, talent history,college and being new to something and showing what you got and also made a point about learning lessons.

  As far as the comment from Betty Burks I disagree with everything that was said because all of it was negative My advice would be to grow up and get up to dated we are no longer living in the old days so there was no need to compare the movie to people you felt like have already done things that ewere done in the movie. And the statment about Violence come on where was that at I really missed that part and if I didn't and wasn't Violence in the movie to state that comment itjust showed how some kids with talent react to certain situations A nick name is something that sticks with you and matches your personality or appearance if you didn't have one.....that just explains you The dances were more of a updated version of the latest dances The Telescope comment wasn't called for amd and the noise you heard that was so loud was called Surround sound its located in practically all Movie theater Please Find Something positive out of it atleast I give the movie 10starts its a Must see film GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!! **********",1176163200,3,1690,4.26875
1564994,5,B00005JPK8,"Its funny to me when I read some of these reviews. People mention the drugs and violence in this movie but yet there isn't one instance of drug use ever mentioned or shown in the film and the SO MUCH SO CALLED Violence only takes up about 1 Minute of screentime. One reviewer says how they used to go to a school where noone would tease you at recess and she never had a nick name. Guess what you're the type of person who ends up being so overly senstive to everything. I mean to complain to the manager about 1 minutes of violence and it's not even anything graphic WOW! This movie is about STEPPING which is a tranditional form of dancing in BLACK FATERNITIES and not the UNDERBELLY of the AFRICAN AMERICAN culture. The underbelly? These are COLLEGE educated youths who are pursuing a first rate education to become LAWYERS, DOCTORS, JUDGES, PROFESSORS etc so how is this the UNDERBELLY of AFRICAN AMERICAN Culture. Just becuase you can't understand something from your (and I'm not sure but going out on a limb)Lilly white Glass house doesn't make it the sludge of society. Look yes we've seen this story tons of times before but its a entertaining movie where the DANCING really shines like no otherd ance flick in it's vien before!",1176076800,5,1237,4.551569506726457
1564995,5,B00005JPK8,"She referred to black culture as the ""underbelly"" of America.  What an ignorant comment.  African/Black America culture is American culture.  Without us, the descendents of West and Central Africans, America would a hellified, boring excuse for a country.

Anywhere there are African people, there is greatness.  She is pissed, that black folks have smarten up.  By the way, Betty Boo, pissed is a Black American expression. In addition, the mainstream uses this word everyday, as if they created it.  As always, we are the innovators and inventors, and you the appropriators. She is mad that a movie was financed, produced, and acted by people of African descent held the coveted spot for three weeks.

Betty guurrrllll don't hate. Emulate. Celebrate! Participate. Get that stick up out of your [...].

I apologize to the other posters for this rant. I know it is not the right place.  I don't normally read posts by people who rate books or movies low, when the majority is overwhelmingly satisfied.  They usually have some serious issues and a beef to fight.

We must remember that African American culture is innovative and exciting.  There will always be people who are envious and threatened by it.  In other words, you can always expect haters.  But even haters are entitled to their opinions.  I just put them on ignore.  These same people will try and copy our style and call it there creation.

For example I saw a suburb community having a double dutch. I laughed.  The double dutch is ancient history in Africa America.  We did it first.  Now they are doing it.  My mama was a double dutch champion in the neighborhood in the early 60s.  It is simple the nature of the beast.  We are just fantastic and interesting people.  These haters know it, and they are bothered.

I love this movie.  It is so much fun to watch.  I wasn't a part of a black Greek organziation, but have been to my share of step shows and have a couple of family members involved.",1173225600,3,1963,4.694117647058824
