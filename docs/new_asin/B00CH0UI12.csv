8581668,5,B00CH0UI12,"This 1987 Hong Kong action-drama won Chow-Yun-fat a best actor award in HK.  The 1980's was a golden decade for Hong Kong action flicks.  Many of which hold cult status nowadays and have been quoted and copied by many contemporary Western/Hollywood film directors.  One of them being Quentin Tarantino, who supposedly based his Reservoir Dogs (1996) partially on this film. I honestly did not see any similarities between the two, except for maybe the ending.  There is practically no kung-fu action in City on Fire.  This film is more of a police story/shoot them up similar in respect to many Hollywood produced cop-robber flicks/ or as they are also known: heist films.  But what really makes this film worthy of seeing is a terrific story-line, well shot action scenes, great music selection, and the charismatic portrayal of the protagonist in the film by Chow-Yun-fat.  He can be a scumbag, a comedian, an arrogant and viscous policeman, and a friend all at once.  The scenes with him and his stubborn and obnoxious fiance where he is trying to get her back at the beginning of the film are---- very funny and show Chow's multiple talents.  I will definitely need to check out more films by Ringo Lam.

There is a Polish film from 1992 by the name of Psy, directed by Pasikowski, which in parts is similar to City on Fire, even more so than Reservoir Dogs.",1451606400,,1362,4.733050847457627
8581669,5,B00CH0UI12,"DVD Review: Pertaining to the Universe version. The picture is not formatted to widescreen TV but it's an old DVD so it should be expected. Overall the picture quality is great because it's not HD! I HATE HD!!

Movie Review: Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino, BLAH BLAH BLAH! WHO GIVES A F***!? This is a great movie with an excellent story, bloody violence, character development and so forth. Definitely vintage Ringo Lam!

In conclusion: 3 1/2 stars for the DVD and 5 stars for City On Fire.",1423526400,,486,4.705882352941177
