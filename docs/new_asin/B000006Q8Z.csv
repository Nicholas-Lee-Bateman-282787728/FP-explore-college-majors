7904611,5,B000006Q8Z,"David Lettermann has stated that he basically was recreating Steve's 1950's shows when he started doing Late Nite with David Lettermann in the early 1980's.  When you watch this biography you will see how apparent that is. Steve Allen was the very first host of The Tonight Show, thus inventing the late night variety talk show comedy format.  He was truly an innovator of comedy dialog, skits, audience participation, etc.  He was also a brilliant author, having written many books.  Besides this, he was an excellent musician and a very prolific song writer.  His taste in choosing his musical guests was exquisite.  He actually picked the musical acts that would be on his shows, unlike today whereby it's a Corporate decision.  He had jazz geniuses like Errol Garner and Chet Baker on regularly, along with Pop, Rock'N'Roll & Country artists of the day. He also ""discovered"" many talents, booking virtually unknown performers on Live national TV, who auditioned for him personally in his office. ""The Killer"" - Jerry Lee Lewis, 2nd inductee ever into the Rock'N'Roll Hall of Fame, for one. Like Jerry Lee, these acts became Over Night Sensations, going from obscurity to Stardom instantly, thanks to Steve (Jerry Lee named his first son Steve Allen Lewis). Mr. Allen also had highly controversial guests like beat poet/writer Jack Kerourac and comedian/social satirist Lenny Bruce on his show. Steve Allen did all of these things, despite having to endure a very cruel, difficult childhood.  I highly recommend seeing the video/DVD of Steve Allen's 75th Birthday celebration in addition to seeing this excellent Biography. On the 75th Birthday show, Steve got to demonstrate what a first rate musician he was.  One book I highly recommend is ""Vulgarians At The Gate"" by Steve Allen.",1257897600,,1786,5.089041095890411
