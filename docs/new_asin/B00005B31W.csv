8204823,3,B00005B31W,"Released to TV in 1976 and directed by Bruce Bilson, ""The New Daughters of Joshua Cabe"" chronicles events in Wyoming when homesteader/interim Sheriff Joshua Cabe (John McIntire) is falsely accused of murder and sentenced to hang in thirty days. His three adopted daughters (Louise Williams, Renne Jarrett & Lezlie Dalton) hatch a harebrained scheme to smuggle him out of a nasty cave prison before going to the gallows. Jack Elam plays Uncle Bitterroot, John Dehner the warden and Geoffrey Lewis the neer-do-well. Jeanette Nolan is also on hand.

This was the third in a trilogy of TV movies, the first two being The Daughters of Joshua Cabe (1972) and The Daughters of Joshua Cabe Return (1975). The producers could never get the same people to play the main characters with the exception of Elam returning as Bitterroot from the first film.

The Western locations are actually good and realistic, but they're obviously the same locations used for 70s TV Westerns, like the Kung Fu series. The best part about New Daughters is the likable cast, particularly the three girls, with Louise Williams standing out as the spirited brunette. Lezlie Dalton was on the soap Guiding Light for a couple of years before leaving acting; its nice to see her again.

New Daughters isn't a Western comedy, but rather a lighthearted Western drama. Despite the quality locations and cast, the story (by Margaret and Paul Savage) is thoroughly contrived in the manner of TV show Westerns. If you can handle that and like the cast its fairly entertaining.

The film runs 73 minutes and was shot in Southern California.

8204826,1,B00005B31W,"The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI Eclipse version.
""The New Daughters of Joshua Cabe"" is from the Aaron Spelling factory of made for TV movies from the early 1970's. This film is a sequel to ""The Daughters of Joshua Cabe"" another made for TV movie.
In the first film Buddy Ebsen did an admirable job of turning the script into an amusing outing. The same cannot be said of this film which has John McIntire taking over the role as head of the family Joshua Cabe. The three ""daughters"" (ladies Joshua has rescued from the seamier side of life) are played by unknowns from the Spelling stable. The only saving grace is casting Jack Elam in the role of Bitterroot, their neighbor.
When an evil land baron makes the Cabes life miserable and Joshua is wrongfully imprisoned, it's up to the daughters and Bitterroot to rescue him. Ho-hum.
While the film is a harmless piece of fluff suitable for the whole family, it's best to avoid it, as it offers nothing new, cheaply filmed and at times, just plain boring.
The transfer was made from a print which had seen better days. The right side of the screen at times was much darker than the left and the middle. Brentwood/BCI does feature their usual extras. Six chapter stops, a DVD dictionary, trivia game and a Hal Roach ""Little Rascals"" short. This movie is also in a 10 pack of westerns at about triple the price for this one film from Brentwood Home Video called ""The Wild West"" and is available from Amazon.com.",1079308800,3,1500,4.559259259259259
