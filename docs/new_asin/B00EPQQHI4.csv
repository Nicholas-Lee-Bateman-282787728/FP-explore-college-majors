8608213,1,B00EPQQHI4,"Terrible, at least the first ten minutes I could make it through.  Listed as History so I thought it would be a doc.  Guess I should have read more thoroughly and noticed two actors listed.  But, it's poorly written and the actors are not anywhere close to believable in the roles.  The dialogue does not sound like Miles and Trane.  Did the writer do any research or just decide to make a statement on music and civil rights?  Pass this one by and watch ""Round Midnight"" or ""Miles Ahead"" or just one of the concerts with Miles and Trane",1469059200,2,537,4.373737373737374
8608214,3,B00EPQQHI4,"I thought there would be a bunch of clips of the two legends performing, but this was two actors, pretending to be the two men and there wasn't much music at all.",1433376000,,162,4.09375
8608215,5,B00EPQQHI4,"Well, coming from someone who actually read the Product Description, I didn't expect the ACTUAL ""Trane & Miles"" to be Starring in a Newly Released, High-Definition, In-Color Film (that would just be stupid).
Therefore, I can actually give a Well-Educated, Honest Review of this Short Film/Documentary.
In my opinion, for a Short Film such as this, you could tell it was Very Well Produced. (This ain't no Student Film or something made in a Basement somewhere.
These are Union Actors, who each played these Characters with total confidence & conviction- While the Film as a whole, conveys the utmost respect to honor these Legends.
Everything you would expect in in a Full-Lenth Feature (as far as production quality and budget), compacted into 20 min.
Very well directed by an Up-and-Coming Director out of Orange County - Scott Essman (I've only heard of a couple times, but am now convinced we'll be hearing a lot more about soon).
So for a 20 min. Short - FIVE STARS all the way.",1400716800,,983,4.822485207100592
8608216,1,B00EPQQHI4,We were hoping/expecting a 20 minute snippet of Trane and Miles playing together. Instead it was actors talking about playing together. Huge disappointment.,1388707200,2,156,5.826086956521739
8608217,3,B00EPQQHI4,Not what I expected. The acting was pretty bad and the staging wasn't too good. I thought it was more along the lines of the history behind these two.,1381708800,2,150,4.206896551724138
