And when behind Discovery Channel finds ways to help his team.  But still I have all of the seasons and wish they kept it going!!",1528934400,,287,4.035087719298246

8663290,5,B00L1WJK7K,"Excellent adventure reality series by National Geographic--four teams, three seasons in all. Beautiful rugged areas in Alaska traversing over icy rivers, waterfalls, across glaciers, through forest, rain, etc. Only complaint is National Geographic cancelled Season 4 commenting that material had been depleted--can't imagine with a state as big as Alaska with with such varied terrain.",1465516800,3,385,6.0181818181818185
8663291,5,B00L1WJK7K,"Fun stuff, but it seems apparent to me that the military guys are told to throttle back just to make it seem more interesting. No one who knows anything will believe 'anyone' could best those guys. Especially by just a few minutes, as they would have you believe.
 Edit: watching more, this is as phony as anything I have seen. Still fun to see the scenery.",1449532800,,357,4.409090909090909

8663293,5,B00L1WJK7K,It's an adventurous and entertaining TV series that kept me on the edge of my seat each episode. Teams race across different remote parts of Alaska to reach an extraction point. The scenery and places they go are beautiful but dangerous and it is amazing to watch how they are able to get to one place to another. I would definitely recommend buying this series and hope they create a third one.,1413072000,,395,4.5
