7861168,3,6304098421,"The one with the baby is a little too much, and often too disgusting. Mr Atkinson should stay away from this lavatorial humor.
In the do-it-yourself sketch, Mr Bean starts out celebrating New Year's Eve, then proceeds to the January Sales, and ends up painting his living room in his very own - however efficient - way. An OK episode but not at all as entertaining as the funniest of Mr Bean!",976579200,,392,4.458333333333333
