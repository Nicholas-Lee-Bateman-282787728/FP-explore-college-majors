8187133,5,B000OXLWTG,"Tim Gray is easy to understand and his teaching are right on.  For the first time the Bible comes together in the right way.  I think of his work as putting together the peices of a puzzle, in fact, the found pieces that were missing for me.  You will be amazed at how the Bible comes alive in a new way, if you choose this study Mark or any other of his works.  I read all his books and hope to own all his DVDs.  I also enjoy his MATTHEW DVD; it is about Christ's Kingship.",1178150400,,475,3.90625
