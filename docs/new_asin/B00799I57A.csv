5064126,5,B00799I57A,"As a lifelong fan of Yamato (I still have episodes of Star Blazers that I recorded off TV broadcasts in 1979), I am tickled pink by the new, big-budget version. It's got just the right combination of new elements that make it more than just a retread, but respectful of the original. And how delightful that the Japanese blu-ray disc has English subtitles! My only real issue is that it's only the first two episodes, and kind of a steep price (I haven't yet gotten the later episodes due to similar pricing considerations).",1377302400,7,524,4.645161290322581
5064127,5,B00799I57A,"Space Battleship Yamato has been around for nearly forty years. There's a fine line to walk when you're reintroducing the original storyline to new and old fans alike. The production team working on Yamato 2199 deserve all the praise they've been getting. They've done a wonderful job by keeping the original sound effects, the musical score should be familiar if you've seen the tv show, the updates to the mechanical (ship) designs are eye candy (it's very detailed), and the character designs have been updated with a military flair but still retain that Leiji Matsumoto flair.

Please keep in mind that this first volume only has the first two episodes. Future volumes should have four episodes per BD/DVD disc. Oh, it also comes with English subtitles. I can't help but recommend this series to fans of classic anime. You won't be disappointed.",1341273600,44,849,4.97887323943662
8512605,4,B00799I57A,"The series itself is quite interesting and a well-made update. I do have one complaint, however.
TRANSLATE THE FRICKIN' MENUS!!!
Is the manufacturer just expecting us to guess?
While I'm delighted that they did not attempt to dub the series (always a disaster), it would be nice if some thought had been put into the fact that, since this is a US release, the menus might be put into English for the benefit of those who can't read kanji.",1513296000,,438,4.556962025316456
8512606,5,B00799I57A,"This entire series re-done is a beautiful homage to the original. Vast improvements  both in the art style, story, and plot twist. It stays true to the original story while being very different and fresh. They also did this without insulting the fans of the original.  So many reboots tend to try to change too much  trying to make a mark for themselves often alienating or insulting the original fans.

And season two is already on Blu-ray in Japan still being produced. Already have two blu-rays from that season and I am insanely happy.  Hidden carryovers of the story from one season to the other have been down that could not have been done in the original series because they did not know to set hints about the next season. And the video in between let you know the scale of  the coming Comet Empire/Galantis Empire....

A vast epic story. With a good moral that is also entertaining.",1502150400,,891,4.60126582278481
8512607,5,B00799I57A,"This is a stunning rework of the original series, and will certainly be enjoyed by fans of Japanese animation and space opera alike. My kids 4 and 5 also love the series, even despite the fact that they cannot fully read all the English subtitles yet.  But, I do believe hearing regular spoken Japanese is helping there general language skills. The only negative is the cost of buying and importing the whole series into the UK. At $70 plus per BluRay the full set it quite pricey and you also need a multi-region BluRay player.",1477958400,3,528,4.557894736842106
8512608,5,B00799I57A,"I used to rush home from school to watch this show when I was a kid.  This remake has held true to the original albeit a couple extra characters and instead of the Yamato being a resurrected WWII battleship - this is a brand new one only sharing the name of the old.

For those new to this series - this might be more a four star because of the steep price.  However, that being said, this is one of the best anime series ever and worth every penny to die-hard anime fans and nostalgic collectors.  The artwork, musical score and character development are top shelf.  These episodes were released as movies in the theaters in Japan and garnered rave reviews.

It's refreshing (to me anyways) to find a quality manga that makes perfect sense without having to read/watch it three times.  If you love anime and manga, sci-fi and star wars type movies - you will love this series.",1462665600,14,877,4.44375
8512609,5,B00799I57A,"This is one of the greatest animes I've ever watched. Brilliant characters with strong motivations fill the cast of this trans-galactic adventure to save Earth. What at first appears to be a generic, evil, faceless enemy empire is quickly revealed to be much deeper, with well-written, sometimes even sympathetic villains and a rich culture. The spaceship battles in the first few episodes look a bit wonky, but the action quickly gets its footing and becomes one of the finest examples of space warefare animation I've ever seen. I can't recommend viewing it enough.

That is all for the show itself. The DISK however...

There are five volumes of this show, each are around $80 here on Amazon. The first disk only holds two episodes according to the product description. I might, MIGHT, pay $80 for the entire show, but as good as it is it's nowhere near worth $400. If you can find a place to get it with a reasonable price do so, but the prices I'm seeing are outrageously inflated.",1441238400,7,986,4.726744186046512

8512613,5,B00799I57A,"They have batted the ball out of the park with this new series!  If you were a fan of the original you will not be dissappointed with this!  Graphics and animation rock, soundtrack and especially the slight tweaks to the story.
Turned my kids onto this and they love it.
An absolute winner!",1389139200,10,290,4.452830188679245
8512614,5,B00799I57A,"In the early 1980's at the age of 8 I saw the preview for a new and upcoming cartoon series called ""Starblazers"".  This cartoon looked nothing like anything I had seen at that age and decided to wake up at 6am pst to check it out for myself.  After seeing the first episode I set two wake up alarms to ensure I would never missed a single episode.  I saw ever episode of season 1 and season 2 in sequence. I then repeated this same practice when Robotech Macross Saga came out.  Recently I stumbled onto the remake of my childhood favorite cartoon and bought blu ray disks 1-6.  Aside from technical mumbojumbo I am attempting to create a fair and objective review of the collective blu rays available, those being 1-6.

Allow me to begin with the negatives.  There is one episode, since the Japanese can never resist this, that ventures into the bizarre world of psychedelic Japanese animation to some degree. I may need to watch that episode 5 times to figure out what that hell is going on.  It is a bewildering and trippy episode no matter what state of mind I view it in.  Only watched it twice and I am still fairly clueless.

As with the motion picture... they have left out thus far the iconic ring of asteroids being used a form of ship defensive.  To anyone that might be listening PLEASE plug this in I do not care how or where you do it.

Now for the positives

1. The original ""Starblazers"" as it was known in the Americas was very much like the smurf village in that there was only 1 main female character aboard the ship.  Nova and Smurfette were both completely alone among horde of strongly developed male characters.  Space battleship Yamato 2199 has greatly balanced out the role of the female sex with multiple females playing crucial roles.

2. The characters and plot are extraordinarily more complex than the original series.  From individual crew members, to the Gamilon empire itself, there is a great deal more depth to the story being unfolded.  Combined with clever historical and genre twists I was pleasantly surprised and will divulge nothing here.

3. With the exception of the psychedelic episode every other episode is exquisitely crafted to the storyline.

4. Space submarines now function as you might think they would.

5. The blu rays are all graphically equal in quality to that found in Ghost in the shell Innocence... for a series this is amazing.

6. It is without a doubt the new bar for storytelling, animation, and remake of a Saga.",1377302400,10,2477,4.594533029612756
