This is one of my son's favorite in the series. Truck  driver Dave and Truck driver Becky add to the program with their banter.",961545600,,288,4.433962264150943
573139,4,6303144217,"Our toddlers love this video and will watch it over and over again.  I agree with other reviewers, Becky is highly annoying, but Dave almost makes up for her.  It will get toddlers to sit still long enough for you to do  something for about 30 minutes.",939427200,2,252,4.319148936170213

He asks for ""truck"" when he wakes up, ""truck"" when we get home,  ""truck"" after dinner.  He thinks it's the greatest!",915840000,,240,4.222222222222222

7839201,5,6303144217,"I have most of the ""there goes a..."" series.  My grandchildren visit often so I like to have videos that are educational for them to watch instead of cartoons.  My 4 year old Grandson recently announced that I needed to buy There goes a Truck!  He was so excited when I told him it arrived.  He has watched it 3 times very attentively.  It's realistic, informative, educational and visually stimulating for a child.  Well done by Becky & Dave!!!  I even caught his Dad watching it with interest!  Fortunately, I kept my VCR because they don't come in DVD version.  Treat your child to this ""Must Have"" video and you'll have plenty of free time to do the dishes or cook dinner!  It's a win-win.

7839202,3,6303144217,"My 23 month old son loves this video and asks to watch it over and over.  He loves wathcing the different trucks work, but loses interest during the scenes where Dave and Becky are talking and arguing.  Also, he gets upset about seeing the tow truck back into the car and then drop it and about watching the garbage truck drop the garbage can and then roll away.  I'm ordering other truck videos hoping he'll get to see more of the trucks (the part that facinates him) and less of the silly stuff (that upsets him and annoys us).",1093305600,,529,4.3232323232323235
7839203,5,6303144217,"I ordered this for my 4 yr old grandson and he loves it. The first section about a firetruck doesn't interest him, but the others do. His 16 month old brother watches as well. Even though, I found it corny, the boys didn't. ""I want to see it again, Grandma"" means it's a winner to the target audience.",1063929600,,301,4.206896551724138
7839204,4,6303144217,"Truck Driver Dave and Truck Driver Becky are up to their usually goofy antics as they explore the world of trucks here.  We have about ten of this series and I would rank this in the middle -- on the plus side, there is the good-natured banter between the two affable leads and the over-arching mystery of what they are hauling in their 18-wheeler, on the minus side there is at least one lengthy segment from another video in the series, and our toddler doesn't really like it when a car is damaged.
Dave and Becky look at tow trucks, garbage trucks, a monster truck and the biggest truck in the world, which hauls the Space Shuttle out to its launch pad.  They also visit shipping facilities that work with large truck containers.
Dave and Becky work well together, and this video is popular in our house.  Chances are, your child will like it too.",1036627200,3,850,4.470967741935484
7839205,4,6303144217,"My son can watch this over and over again, and as a result can point out to me which trucks are which!  He is only 18 mos.old.  We try to limit it to just few times a week, but it is truly his favorite video.",1022976000,,208,3.6
7839206,4,6303144217,"This is the first ""There goes a ......"" video I have purchased and it absolutely captivates the attention of my 2 year old. Definitely well worth the money spent on this one.  He is fascinated with trucks when we're out & about and gets upset when we pass them by too quickly to have a good look. So, this video is perfect; he gets a close up look at a variety of trucks. I think it's pretty entertaining too, as does my 12 year old (believe it or not).  The humor between Becky and Dave is a little corny, but most things that captivate kid's attention is corny and I think it does add something to the video for older kids to be amused by. The only downfall is I wish it were longer, maybe shooting a few scenes for each type of truck.  I find myself rewinding it again and again so he can watch it over and over; thus prompting me to purchase a few more of the ""There goes a ......"" videos from the series.  I haven't received them yet, but I've ordered ""There goes a bulldozer"",  ""airplane"",  and ""Train"".  I'll let you know if they're as good as I think this one is.",990489600,3,1071,4.144927536231884
7839207,3,6303144217,"I own this video and also ""There Goes a Garbage Truck"", and the garbage truck video is the one my two-and-a-half-year-old son prefers.
This tape seems to have more air time devoted to Dave and Becky engaged in petty argument, and not as much interesting footage of different kinds of trucks. Also, my son seemed a bit worried during the part of this tape where Dave messes up his duties as a tow-truck driver and not only backs into a car, smashing its front end, but then puts it on the flatbed tow-truck wrong so that it falls off when he drives away. Since my son is an absolute fanatical zealot when it comes to things with wheels, he didn't enjoy watching the car being damaged (even though it appears to be a Monza, which is arguably a good candidate for destruction).
The segments with Dave and Becky bickering with each other seem meaner, and more pointless, than in the garbage truck video. They actually argue over who ate all the potato chips, which at best is off-topic, and at worst is encouraging imitation. In any case, I found it very irritating to endure.
There are some very good segments on this tape, however, such as the one showing the ""largest truck in the world"" which carries the Space Shuttle to the launch pad. My son said ""Oh wow!"" about this part.
This tape might be better for older kids who will be more appreciative of the slapstick comedy of Dave and Becky, and less bothered by the smashed car and the monster truck that chases the duo.",984528000,7,1470,4.4888059701492535
7839208,5,6303144217,"My three kids love this video.  My 4-year-old daughter loves to watch it and my 2-year-old twins (boy/girl) ask for it all of the time.  Heck, I'm 30 and I love to watch it, even after seeing it 500 times with the kids.  The only downfall is that now, when we are in the car, the kids love to yell at all of the trucks.  Time to get ""There goes an airplane"" and ""There goes a helicopter"".  Also, Becky and Dave, the hosts, are hilarious.",975196800,,437,4.094117647058823
