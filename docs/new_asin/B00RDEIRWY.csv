6928554,5,B00RDEIRWY,"This film is a spoof of ""Fast and Furious"" done in ""Airplane"" fashion. Dale Pavinski plays the bald headed Vin Serento aka Vin Diesel. He is abused by his GPS navigator who compares his head to the male organ. His sister is named Jordana (Lili Mirojnick) for Jordana Brewster. The main character is White (Alex Ashbaugh) who goes from undercover cop to criminal. They want to rob Juan Carlos de la Sol (Omar Chaparro) who keeps his money at a fast food taco place. They are pursued by detective Rock Johnson (Dio Johnson) whose running gag is to oil his muscles and he is a ""rock."" Vin has a girlfriend Michelle (Andrea Navedo) aka Michelle Rodriguez. Her running gag is that she is bisexual. Michelle Rodriguez is an open bisexual in real life.

The film was stupid, but I had to laugh. I am sure there was satire that I missed.

Good spoof.

6928594,2,B00RDEIRWY,"It's still not a good movie (or one I found funny at all) and once again the directors decide to put in an excruciating dance number but at least the duo are trying to refine their targets.  Of course the ""It's suppose to be dumb"" crowd will love it so take my rating for what it is.",1441584000,,283,3.9649122807017543

6928600,5,B00RDEIRWY,"Personally, I've always been a fan of their weird crazy silly spoof movies. (Epic Movie and Vampires Suck are my favorites) After the trainwreck that was 'Disaster Movie' it feels like they stick with spoofing one main franchise at a time now rather that spoofing multiple movies and characters into one. This time, they are spoofing The Fast & the Furious franchise. The franchise has gone from sexy street racing to pulling off heists like Ocean's Eleven. Superfast did a great job at spoofing this long drawn out series. Making fun of the cliches like having a black guy, an Asian, a greased up guy, and a hot supermodel in the group. The guy playing Detective Rock Johnson was hilarious and had Dwayne Johnson's mannerisms down perfectly. Listen, this movie isn't meant to be some boring drawn out Award winning masterpiece, it's just meant to be funny and give you a couple of laughs, so please don't judge it so harshly.

Undercover police officer Lucas White enters the world of underground street racing to join a gang of street racers led by Vin Serento to get closer to a crime ring led by Los Angeles kingpin Juan Carlos de la Sol. Lucas and Vin very quickly become BFFs and dates his sister, Jordana. They put together a group to take down Juan Carlos and steal $100 million. Hot on their trail is a dim-witted detective who keeps rubbing his body with baby oil. It all leads to a high speed chase and plenty of hilarity. I highly recommend SUPERFAST!!!",1430870400,2,1465,4.656370656370656
6928601,3,B00RDEIRWY,"I never thought i'd see the day when I actually say Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer made a decent parody film. These guys had something to do with Scary Movie, and then went on a rampage of making horrible parody movies over the last ten years. Just about any parody film you heard of with something ""Movie"" in the title was the brainstorm of these two clowns. These two have only had success in the parody industry with Spy Hard, Date Movie and their somewhat involvement with the Scary Movie films, but everything else like Epic Movie, Meet The Spartans, Disaster Movie, Vampires Suck, The Starving Games and god knows what else have caused fans of parody to lose hope in there ever being a decent parody film ever made again in Hollywood.

Somehow tho this one managed to slip under the radar... those two obviously have blown any chances of getting a theatrical release for their films now, but this direct to DVD parody of the Fast & Furious franchise manages to give me hope that parody films are not as doomed as it seemed.

I had no idea those two where even involved with this film till it was over and I saw their names pop up. Wow, they proved me wrong and can make a decent parody after all!

The plot is pretty much the beginning of the first F&F movie, then brings in elements of F&F 5. It's the same story, just told funnier... an undercover cop joins a group known to be involved in something criminal, and blah blah race blah blah explosions blah blah blah... I can't imagine you'd go into this without having seen the F&F movies prior. It actually pretty much sticks to just making fun of F&F and the actors within it. It took a few other stabs at some movies and pop-culture things, but it looks like those two clowns who make these things have finally realized you don't just cram a bunch of current films together and expect it to be funny. Which is probably why this one actually works! There is no stupid scene inserted anywhere going from a F&F race to a dumb shot of Jack Sparrow or something looking on from the side of the road.

This is not to say tho that it's a great parody. I might watch it again in a few months/years when I've forgotten it a bit and will remind myself here it is ok for a second viewing later on down the track, but with that said, I wouldn't bother buying a copy as it's not something nearly as re-watchable as say ""Airplane"", ""Naked Gun"" ""Spaceballs"", ""Men In Tights"" etc...

Overall: Worthy of a rental for one nights viewing pleasure.",1430784000,2,2489,4.4021739130434785
6928602,5,B00RDEIRWY,"Its been a while since we have has a good comedy spoof of a particular movie franchise, I think this movie does a brilliant job of taking on the fast and furious franchise, the comedy is genuinely funny and not too stupidly over the top, the movie only parodies these particular movies and not other movies like some comedies have done in the past, the story pretty much is based on the original movie with bits of the later sequels like part 5 etc mixed in, this movie was directed by Jason Friedberg who was responsible for meet the Spartans and epic movie and disaster movie but I feel this is much better, the cast is spot on perfect with some hilarious performances especially from Dio Johnson playing Detective Rock Johnson who is always rubbing baby oil on his muscles and has Dwayne Johnsons facial expressions perfect, the rest of the cast are great too, vin, Michelle, Jordana, all the main characters are spoofed plus the rapper cameo and the cool Asian guy and the model turned actress! this is a genuinely funny movie with a decent budget cast and story that's actually worth picking up for a good laugh, it will appeal to fast and furious fans especially if you really know the movies well, check it out!",1429747200,3,1218,4.566210045662101
6928603,5,B00RDEIRWY,"I have no idea why a parody of the Fast & Furious took so long to get made, but they sure did it right!  This movie is a perfect combination of characters and story telling that (if a fan of the original series) you will love!  They found the perfect group of actors to portray all the characters and I'm really not sure it could've been better?!  This movie is INCREDIBLY stupid,...but in the best sense of the word!  It's exactly what I look for in a parody.

In all honestly, there really isn't a whole lot to be said about it.  The story follows Vin Serento (Dale Pavinski) and his crew as they attempt to get rich by stealing 100 million dollars from the vault of Cesar (Joseph Julian Soria).  Officer Lucas White (Alex Ashbaugh) comes in to the mix as an undercover agent to bust Vin, but quickly falls for Vin's sister, Jordana (Lili Mirojnick).  Aside from that, there's really not much ""story"".

Final Verdict:  WATCH IT!  Great cast, great characters, over the top sequences!",1428278400,4,985,4.508474576271187

Other then that, it is a spoof and a decent one at that.
Seen better and seen alot worse.

Warning not related to this review.
Amazon have shortened their return policy from 90 days to 30 days.
I lost 600.00$ on an HP Laptop because of this.
I guess you need to verify the return policy everytime you buy on this website from now on, because it used to be 90 days.
(Ebay has also done the same)",1520812800,,465,4.1098901098901095
