8028768,5,B0002L7ILG,"Anything to do with Miss Garland is a must. This is no different a wonderful review of Judys career. She was the greatest entertainer the world has ever seen, and I'm sure she will always be unequalled.

8028769,4,B0002L7ILG,"This is by far the best Biography conceived on the great entertainer Judy Garland.
Excellent interviews by Ann Miller, June Allison and other M-G-M stars.",1379203200,,154,5.2
8028770,3,B0002L7ILG,"I read a biography of Judy Garland in 1993 and this documentary hits on all the same points.  This work was more fact-based; the film ""Me and My Shadows"" does a better job in diving into her personality.  This work may have been a Biography episode that A&E then expanded upon.  It has a fairly equal mix of female and male interviewees.
It does mention the rainbow flag nature of her father and Liza's first husband.  However, it doesn't touch upon speculation that her death played a key role in the Stonewall Riots.  It turns out that she was a Democrat, but then again many have written that Hollywood supports my party.
Something else really hit me.  Many celebrities are actors and musicians, but she got famous doing both in films.  Yes, ""Moulin Rouge"" and others have done well recently, but I'd still say the days of Hollywood musicals are over.  A more prominent trend now is for those in the music world to become actors.  Will Smith, Queen Latifah, Harry Connick, Jr., Justin Timberlake, and many others exemplify this.
Further, if you love Liza, there's a hearty amount of her here, sans Mr. Gest.",1259452800,5,1110,4.651282051282052
