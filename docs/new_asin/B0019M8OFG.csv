3441517,5,B0019M8OFG,An amazing film. WATCH THIS FILM AND WORK TO PROTECT OUR ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER! Seeing the clips from Ohio in 2004 brings tears to my eyes everytime.,1219104000,4,149,4.555555555555555
3441518,5,B0019M8OFG,"I asked the producer/director of the movie, David Ernhardt, to show this film at Middle Tennessee State University (near Nashville) earlier this year.  It was an eye-opener to say the least.  The students were absolutely blown away by it.  I've seen a few other videos (one on HBO) on the horrors of ""black box voting,"" and UNCOUNTED is just better work.  More compelling, more professional looking, with a greater sense of history and narrative story telling than the others.  It's accessible to high school and college students, great in a political science or government/civics classroom, or just to show at your next Rotary Club or church group meeting.  All citizens that love this nation and want to protect our fragile democracy need to see this film.  I cannot recommend it to you more highly.",1219104000,5,801,4.932835820895522
3441519,5,B0019M8OFG,"UNCOUNTED is one of the most important films of the past decade bringing to light many of the verified cases of voter suppression and vote count irregularities that threaten our very democracy.  It features powerful, testimonials from insiders and documents facts the corporate media would never touch.  Documentaries such as UNCOUNTED are the only way to create broad awareness of the critical issues needed to motivate the public to demand corrective action.  But don't be discouraged - VOTING is still the most powerful weapon we have.  It's much harder to steal a landslide so VOTE!",1219104000,4,586,5.136842105263158
3441520,5,B0019M8OFG,"We screened Uncounted back in January as our first Gold Circle Screening - which represents an ""off-season"" film which we have discovered outside of our regular submission process.  It was a double first - the film's first formal screening away from the filmmakers' hometown and the first time we had attempted a stand-alone screening apart from our regular Festival schedule - and it was a great success.

I had first heard about Uncounted, by chance, listening to David (the filmmaker) being interviewed on the radio and, as soon as I was able to watch it, I knew we had something powerful in our hands.  Uncounted has the surprising ability to inform and outrage both the newly passionate observer of elections and election fraud, and also the veterans who might think they have seen everything on the topic, but haven't.

The content is presented at both the aggregate level, with statistics and poll results, and at the personal level, with compelling eye-witness testimony regarding wrong-doing and attempted wrong-doing.  We were impressed enough by it to screen it again last week as an Official Selection of the 9th Annual Sacramento Film & Music Festival and I would heartily recommend it to anybody who cares about elections and the democratic process.

3441541,4,B0019M8OFG,"This is a great documentary. I showed this to my students (college) when we discussed governmental deviance and white collar crime. It sends a clear message and I liked watching the students write furiously when the statistics would flash on the screen in bold black and white. After the election I asked how many of them voted using a paper ballot and they all yelled ""I DID!"" The end of the documentary sends a clear message about the importance of our democratic process and how we must work to preserve it. My students said they learned to never take it for granted. They also learned some ways that they can get involved to make sure everyone -- no matter who they vote for -- gets the opportunity to vote.",1227484800,3,711,4.51937984496124
3441542,4,B0019M8OFG,"Voting is a matter of simple mathematics. The victory in any election is supposed to go to the candidate who has the largest number of votes, pure and simple. But precisely because voting is such a simple matter of tallying up ballots, the act of voter fraud is not that difficult to come by, and this is especially true during the electronic age when the outcome of an election can be altered significantly with the some simple altercation of computer software.

Uncounted is a documentary about the problems with accuracy in voting and specifically the fraudulent activities that took place in the 2004 presidential election. Many authors have written books about the 2004 election and the final vote count that favored Bush by a significant margin over Kerry. This documentary continues this theme of fraud, exposing some of the tactics used by determined election officials, election volunteers, and even the candidates themselves who will stop at nothing to make sure victory is declared on Election Day.

Voter fraud can take on many forms and several methods are described in this documentary. Purging voters from the rolls of eligible voters; reducing the number of machines at specific polling places to create long lines; falsifying or deceiving the public about election/campaign information; and tampering with electronic voting machines are among several ways that a candidate and/or his workers and supporters can rig an election. Among these, the most startling is electronic voting machine fraud and this type of activity receives much coverage in this documentary. Because there is no paper trail produced by these voting machines, there is no way to prove or disprove how an individual actually voted. A few clicks of a mouse are sometimes all that is necessary to create a computer program that will switch the outcome of an election.

What I like best about Uncounted is its use of expert testimony, citizen testimony, and numeric facts to back its claims. People like U.S. Representative John Conyers, U.S. Rep Jim Cooper, former Green Party Presidential candidate David Cobb, and many others come forward to challenge the use of electronic voting machines due to the ease at which fraud can be committed. Ordinary citizens also speak out about their own experience with voting in 2004 and they point out the many tactics that were used to prevent them from casting a vote.  There are also plenty of statistical facts presented in this movie and many will shock the average viewer. For example, there were some counties in 2004 that showed a final tally of presidential votes for Bush that exceeded the total registered voters in the county. If this isn't proof that something is wrong with the system, then I don't know what is.

Uncounted is a strong documentary with many pieces of evidence that point to obvious wrongdoing but one thing that could have made the documentary a little stronger would have been the inclusion of more instances of fraud that favored Democrats. As it stands, most all of the fraud uncovered in this documentary is fraud that favored Republicans, making it look like conservatives are the only ones attempting to rig elections. The various speakers in the documentary make it very clear that the issue of voter fraud is non- partisan and what matters is that everyone has the opportunity to vote and that votes are calculated fairly. I believe the different speakers are sincere in their desires, but the documentary could have helped to back them up and added to its own credibility if it had included more examples across the board and wasn't  so lopsided against Republicans.

Election fraud is certainly something that needs to be taken seriously. Voting is a great privilege, but if we are prevented from voting in the first place or if our vote isn't counted accurately, then can we really claim to be a true democracy? I think not, and Uncounted is a very good documentary for its exposure of these different forms of voter fraud, its use as a citizen rallying tool, and its general educational value. Something needs to be done to ensure that every vote is counted and counted accurately, and voter awareness and the resulting citizen activism is the place to start.",1225670400,,4226,4.977337110481586
3441543,5,B0019M8OFG,"This is a documentary about the votes that go 'uncounted' for various reasons during elections. There are a variety of reasons, some through negligence and human error and others through deliberate attempts to sabotage our voting system. The story is mostly told from the Democratic' viewpoint, although it does try to be impartial. Obviously, the Democrats have been on the losing end of the national elections this century until 2006. The Republicans have no incentive to tell the story. Stripping all the politics away, this is a report about how susceptible our system, especially the electronic voting machines, is to to fraud. It's almost unthinkable that we are using a system that virtually has no check and balances to detect fraud. The same people, Diebold, that manufacture our ATM machines and verify who we are before it dispenses or takes our money and then gives us a receipt to verify the transaction, are responsible for much of the electronic voting equipment used in America. They alone have access to the computer code that control the machines so the government can't even check to see if the code has been altered after an election. It has been proven that these machines are easily rigged, yet they cannot provide equipment even as good as the ATM machines we use every day. Those with high blood pressure and heart disease may want to beware before watching this film. It will make you angry that our Democracy rests on such fragile legs and that we cannot be assured that the real winners of our elections actually get into office. The one check and balance is the exit polling that is done on election day. In both the 2004 & 2006 elections, the exit polls were significantly different from the tabulated results. Statistically, they were way beyond the margins of error from the final vote totals. Who was wrong and what went wrong? You decide. A secure and honest system is all that lies between us and the regimes that govern the countries we so oppose. [...]",1223769600,2,1988,4.815789473684211
3441544,5,B0019M8OFG,"This documentary presents a very sobering view of the vulnerability of the election process in this country. It presents chilling evidence that the outcome of the last two presidential elections may have been influenced by a variety of means.

People who try to discredit this film as ""paid for by the DNC"" or dismiss it as ""liberal propaganda"" clearly don't get the message, and all I can say is: Wake up!

This is not about any particular party, this is about the danger of private corporations potentially manipulating the outcome of elections in this country. All parties and all voters need to be concerned about this.",1222041600,,623,4.867924528301887
3441545,5,B0019M8OFG,"Well documented and scary documentary on how our elections process has 1. either serious problems that need to be investigated and fixed, or 2. outright fraud that needs to send someone(s) to jail.  In either case, we must make our elections completely fraud proof so that every vote counts.  If the elections can be fixed, whoever is in power will be tempted to do so.  We need to fix this now!!",1220918400,,396,4.549295774647887
3441546,5,B0019M8OFG,"With the 2008 elections approaching quickly, what better way to celebrate than with a critical look at our U.S. voting system!  As a fellow documentary filmmaker, I thought Uncounted was well-crafted, well-researched, and entertaining.  David Earnhardt & Co. have done a great job tackling a topic that has many, many levels.  Watch this film and then make sure your voting place has a system that is verifiable.  If not, you might be wasting your time as this documentary elegantly enlightens.",1220313600,2,494,5.1375
3441547,5,B0019M8OFG,"A revolution is afoot in these United States.  But unlike, say, the American Revolution, this one is not of the people.  No, it's anything but.  This revolution has silenced the people, strangled our democracy and made a mockery of Constitution principles.  The revolution?  The privatization of the American electoral system.

How did this happen? How did the concept of one man, one vote get so skewed that partisans interests now design machines to register and count votes, in secrecy, with `proprietary' equipment that can't be independently reviewed and verified?  How did so many of us become disenfranchised - without even knowing it? It's mind boggling.

And it's at the heart of UNCOUNTED.  The film gives historical perspective on how our electoral system was slowly given over to those who do not have the good of the republic in their hearts, but rather see how our system can be manipulated toward their own aims; it lays bare the idea that our elections are fair and reflect the true will of the people; and it proves in all too painful detail how this electoral revolution led to the installation of the most corrupt administration in our nations' history.

Buy it, watch it, show it to your family and friends and everyone you know who cares about our future.  Because as UNCOUNTED shows, there is a tipping point, and we may have already passed it.",1219622400,6,1366,4.844827586206897

I was shocked to find that if we look at what happened with the voting in 2004 and 2006, we find similar election patterns. I believe after watching this film that the upcoming 2008 election could possibly manipulated and fraud could occur again. However, as US citizens, we must get out and vote and we must help get others to vote. Call your party's headquarters and offer to transport voters to their precints.

Though mysteriously failing to make headlines, many of these problems have been well documented through books and film.  A handful of outstanding documentaries have hit the screens, most of them focusing on Florida '00 and Ohio '04, but none gives so clear an overview, and none spells out so well what we are up against in 2008, as David Earnhardt's ""Uncounted.""

Prior to watching this, I thought I was well informed on what happened with the two Bush W. elections, but this film showed stuff, that had it happened in a small country, or an African country, the U.S. would be bombing then by the end of the week... OK, maybe not bombing then but the international community would list them as a corrupt terrorist regime that is a threat to worldwide democracy.

*SPOILER* How in the world can you have 3 times as many people in a voting district vote for you than are actually registered to vote there!? And then we give it a free pass and keep on moving? America? AMERICA? Come on now.  And how do you have electronic voting machines that are less secure and reliable than a private company's ATM?  If an ATM gives me one dollar less than I'm supposed to get, I'm screaming bloody murder, but here we have voting machines screwing up on a much bigger scale and everyone let's it happen.

8274652,5,B0019M8OFG,"No conspiracy theory's here, cold hard facts, some of which have been voiced over and over in the past, but also new facts which beg the question: Why is no one being held accountable?  This documentary cuts into the heart of America, exposing the graft and corruption that finally broke through the revolving door and blew it off it's hinges in 2000. Today we are suffering the end result of that breach, the final phase of a planned op that allows corporate control of our government.  The recent supreme court ruling allowing corporate to spend limitless amounts for the promotion of their candidate of choice is the final result (to date, fasten your seat belts) of the last vestiges of democracy being flushed down the toilet.  The strongest point this documentary made to me was the fact that traitorous crimes have been committed over and over since 2000, and the perpetrators should at minimum be in prison.  Our forefathers would have hanged them from the lamp posts, yet not a single entity has been held accountable.  This is a statement about who really runs this country, and a must see for anyone who believes in democracy.",1264204800,7,1137,4.780612244897959
8274653,5,B0019M8OFG,"It is astonishing to me that even today a huge number of people are unaware of the huge number of problems that occurred in the 2000 and 2004 elections. As one of the interviewees in this documentary explained, there were over fifty tactics used in Ohio in 2004 to alter the outcome of the election. The evidence is overwhelming that the election outcome in both 2000 and 2004 was manipulated. The result was that George W. Bush ""won"" both elections. Actually, the efforts in 2000 would not have been successful had the U. S. Supreme Court not intervened to stop the recount in Florida. One of the most underreported news stories of this decade is that the Republican appointed judge in Florida was going to order a recount that took into account all under votes and over votes. The result, based on the NORC analysis of the ballots, would have been a several thousand vote victory for Al Gore.

The documentary does a good job of outlining several ongoing problems that affected the outcomes of the 2000 and 2004 elections. These can arise again if two things happen. First, there have to be enough states in play to make stealing votes a viable strategy. In 2008 Obama had way too great of a lead over McCain to make it possible to steal. But there is a second major consideration. The Right (and every bit of evidence indicates that the vast majority of the vote stealing is generated by the Right) did not really embrace McCain. If in 2012 Obama has less of a lead and the Right has a candidate that it likes, they will engage in the kind of ruthlessness (ruthlessness justified by the Manichean view of the world whereby they see themselves as the forces of good able to do anything to defeat the powers of evil, even if it means thwarting the popular will and stealing elections) that they did in 2000 and 2004. The film details such strategies as undervoting (where someone votes for other offices but not for president, which in some states resulted in huge vote losses for Democrats, like in New Mexico in 2004, where over 20,000 undervotes occurred, in a state where Bush won by only 5,000 votes -- but remember, this is only votes stolen by undervoting). What they did not fully explain in the documentary is that these tactics can usually only succeed in states where those stealing the votes also control the State's Attorney's office. This was a major factor in the Republicans winning, despite exist polls, in Ohio in 2000 and 2004, but not in 2008, when the exit polls and the final vote tallies corroborated one another. Key state officials, most notoriously Ken Blackwell, were accused of disenfranchising tens of thousands of voters and his office was responsible for the distribution of electronic voting machines. This meant providing large numbers of voting machines for predominantly GOP voting districts but exceptionally few machines for Democratic districts. The film shows the long, long lines of the 2004 election in Ohio, lines that were created by Ken Blackwell. In 2008, however, with a Democratic Secretary of State, there was a more equitable distribution of voting machines.

The film explains some of the problems with electronic voting machines. Their lack of clarity is terrifying. The New York Times did a great column a few years ago contrasting electronic voting machines with slot machines in Nevada. The article went into great detail about the tests that state officials submit the machines to. They examine the source code in excruciating detail, while Diebold has not allowed anyone to examine their source code. Diebold and other electronic voting machines are intensely secretive and do not allow their machines to be examined in detail, in contrast with slot machines, about which we know virtually everything.

What is scary is that the documentary barely touches on vote suppression techniques, such as the constant purging of voter rolls. The GOP strategy in the past decade has been to form a coalition of special interest groups, enough to get close to the margin needed to win, while trying to disenfranchise as many likely Democratic voters as possible. Republican Secretaries of State across the U.S. engage constantly in huge voter purges, without informing those removed from the rolls that they have been so removed. When they show up to vote, they are unable to. The trends of the two parties has been very different. Democrats want to enfranchise as many people as possible and get them out to vote, while Republicans want to turn out their base while reducing the number of registered voters likely to be Democrats. There have been a long string of such stunts by the GOP, while relatively few on the side of the Democrats. The biggest controversy being the registration of people either already registered or nonexistent by ACORN paid workers, though there is no evidence that the falsely registered voters actually voted, leading most observers -- though not fringe journalists like Glenn Beck -- to conclude that these ACORN workers were simply trying to get their sheets filled up so that they could break off work more quickly. But what is lost in the ACORN controversy is the huge disparity in numbers. The number of invalid ACORN registrations ended up at around a couple of thousand, while nationally hundreds of thousands of voters beyond expected numbers have been purged from voter rolls. The GOP strategy has been obvious: reduce voter roles, dissuade people from voting, limit their ability to vote by not placing sufficient numbers of machines in heavily Democratic areas, and steal votes both by use of software (such as the counties where Bush received more votes than there were voters by an 8 to 1 margin) and manual means. The result is a strategy of undermining the will of the people.

I completely agree that this should not be a partisan issue. I am opposed to all rigging of elections. While recent accusations of vote fixing has been overwhelmingly directed at the GOP, if the Democrats began doing it on the scale that the GOP currently has (I'm sure that some Democrats have done this on a local level, though there has been little evidence of anything significant recently). I want everyone who wants to vote to be able to vote and I want their votes to be counted. One reason I turned against Bush in November of 2000 (before that I bought his moderate rhetoric) was his opposition to any recount. This runs counter to everything that I believe as an American. I could have tolerated his winning if the recount had taken place and it had showed him the victor (ironically, under 8 possible recount scenarios in Florida, Gore would have won, the only one under which he would have lost being the recount that his team was requesting -- we know, however, that the judge in charge of the recount was not going to carry out Gore's recount, but a more wide ranging one that would have given him the victory).

There are so many things that we could do to make the nation a more effective democracy. I believe that all Americans should be automatically registered to vote. Tie it to social security. Have the voting machines run by the federal government instead of private industry and if the government buys privately produced machines, demand complete access to the source code and make sure it is safe. Have absolutely no voting machines that do not also have paper ballots. When hearing all these crimes against the democratic process, I keep wondering what someone like Thomas Jefferson would think. He believed that there could be no successful democracy without an educated citizenry. Now we not only have an increasingly unenlightened electorate but a corrupted voting process in which huge numbers of Americans are denied their right to vote. Until we demand a safe and protected voting process democracy itself is in danger.",1258156800,,7820,4.859070464767616
8274654,4,B0019M8OFG,"Uncounted: The New Math of American Elections focuses on both confirmed attempts to rig elections and suspected attempts to rig elections right up to the national level of president. Of course, this is a highly charged and controversial subject; and it's primarily but not exclusively presented by Democrats who assert that elections were rigged using electronic voting machines, voter intimidation and other ""techniques"" to get a particular candidate to win a political election and thwart our cherished democracy. It is important to note that this film was made in 2007 before the recent presidential election. Therefore, this film does not criticize or praise the way the most recent presidential election was handled.

It is absolutely fascinating to see interviews with people who were victimized when they tried to blow the whistle on Diebold, a company that made electronic voting machines but then added extra computer code to ""flip"" votes. The idea of ""flipping"" votes is simple. If one candidate gets 51% of the vote and the other gets 48% of the vote, the machine automatically changes it so that the first candidate now has only 48% of the vote and the other now has 51%. We meet and see a computer programmer who testifies before a congressional hearing that he was required to write computer code to make that happen; and it was great to find out that he resigned and even rejected a million dollar bonus to stay with the company.

Another story that was particularly interesting was that of Scott Heller, a night shift word processor at a legal firm that represented Diebold. He discovered documents and information that proved Diebold was rigging votes using code in their computerized voting machines--and wow, how they punished him. At the time this was filmed he was a felon on parole for stealing evidence from the law firm; and of course he did make unauthorized copies of confidential information. On the other hand, however, his attorney points out that this sent a very negative message to anyone who wants to be a whistle blower out there. In addition, we get great interview footage with Bev Harris, founder of Black Box Voting, who campaigns tirelessly for fair vote counting if we use computerized voting machines.

We also meet Bruce Fink, a Republican in Utah who was an elected official--before he was kicked out of office. However, one flaw I found here was a lack of more detail about Bruce's story. I would have preferred the documentary to explain more about how other people were able to get rid of Bruce Fink.

Finally, we see voter intimidation specifically in the national elections of 2000 and 2004. For example, many people in African-American and Latino communities were told that if they didn't go away and park elsewhere they'd get a parking ticket; and in one predominantly African-American district there was no electricity in the building despite the fact that the building just across the street had electricity! Others had to wait up to fifteen hours just to vote when there weren't enough voting machines.

This documentary is somewhat skewed; it usually shows Democrats being shut out by Republicans as a result of faulty voting machines. On the other hand, it does make its point very well and it uses hard facts to back up its assertions. This film should stimulate some lively conversation about a very relevant topic fundamental to our democracy.",1238371200,3,3401,4.980633802816901
