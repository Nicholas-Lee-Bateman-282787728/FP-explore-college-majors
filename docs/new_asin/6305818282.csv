1079779,4,6305818282,"This is a wonderfull tale of fantasy and legend. It blends many of the familiar childhood faerie tales together to form a remarkable world.  there are moments in this show's 480 mins where they get a bit... um..  family(?sappy?) and times when the humor and subject matter is suggestive.  Overall, however, it has a great story, a well acted characters, especially  on the part of Wolf (fantastic)and Kimberly Williams, and is beautifuly  set.  Should be enjoyable to viewers of all ages.",952387200,2,488,4.962962962962963

1079782,5,6305818282,"The 10th Kingdom is one of the best movies I have ever seen!  It is full of great fairy tales and adventure.  Trolls, evil queens, magic, and haunted forests, fill the movie with excitement.  The scenery is  magnificent.  The forests are huge and the castles are very detailed.  It  has a great story line and great actors.  I have watched it on NBC for the  last couple nights (I want to know what happens and I will watch th eend of  it until it is over)and every night it is on, I get excited!  Once you turn  it on, it's hard to turn it off.  I think NBC should put it on again.  The  end is always suspenseful and that makes you want to watch it more.  The  10th Kingdom is the BEST movie I have ever seen!",951955200,14,711,4.036231884057971

1080079,4,6305818282,"I, like many of you, have been looking for a reasonably priced version of this series on a physical format for years now. I was shocked to see a Blu-ray release of this fantastic series for such a reasonable price. If you haven't seen The 10th Kingdom and are a fan of fantasy, what are you doing reading this review go out there and watch it right now. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say its one of the best fantasy series ever produced, not that there's much competition. The series itself would get a 5/5 rating from me without a moments doubt.
This set however, isn't quite as great as the series deserves. The cover of this Blu-ray looks like it was printed on the same home-printer that dvd bootleggers use to print covers for Hollywood movies they sell while they're still in theatres, thankfully the film quality is much better. I believe this is the highest quality of the series to ever be released, so for fans its hard not to justify a purchase at this price-point. For the '15th Anniversary' it would've been great to see a bit more in terms of special features, but only the bare-minimum is included.
I remember seeing the series on DVD at a friends home when I was still a child, and looking online only to see that it was out of print at an unreasonable price to purchase new or pre-owned. While I wish the series was given more respect in the treatment of this release, its one of my all-time favorites, its still well-worth the money for such a great series in the best quality I've ever seen it.",1503446400,4,1521,4.4163701067615655

1080081,5,6305818282,"I saw the 10th Kingdom as a kid and loved it then, even down to the deliberate campy acting on the part of the trolls. I have seen it several times as an adult, and it has nothing to do with nostalgia. I've shown it to friends who love it (once they realize it's long and we're not going to successfully marathon it). Absolutely adore it!",1502755200,,338,4.136363636363637

This has been a family favorite since my husband and I watched the miniseries many years ago when it first came out on TV.  This is the 3rd or 4th copy of this movie that we have purchased.  We owned it first on VHS Tape, then on DVD, and DVD again (This version had fewer discs).  Now  we own it on Blu-ray (It has SUBTITLES!!!)  The movie was clear and bright.  I was able to see details in the costumes and scenery that were a blur in earlier formats.  I did not have any trouble with the menus or the soundtrack.  This was money well spent!",1500940800,3,649,4.203252032520325

Would have given 5 stars if there hadnt been any problems with the discs. *update* I decided to try again an reordered it. No issues this time and I am completely satisfied.

It's incredibly long, so prepare yourself for a marathon type movie session. But it's a great mix of all these different fairytale stories that we all grew up with. Throw in a young woman from New York who gets sucked into this crazy world, a prince turned dog, leather obsessed trolls, and One smitten wolf.....well, you've got quite a story!

I watched it with my 4 year old son recently and he loves is just as much. It's really a great movie for the whole family.",1496966400,6,608,4.28695652173913
1080128,5,6305818282,"this particular movie has been a family favorite of ours since our kids were little. the three principal characters Virginia, Tony, and Wolf, respectably played by Kimberly Williams, John Larroquette, and Scott Cohen bring life to many of the Grimms fairy tales that are highlighted in this particular story about nine mythical kingdoms that the three principles find themselves trapped in, and their desire to locate the magic mirror that will take them back to the 10th Kingdom of New York.  Daniel Lapaine plays Prince Wendell who finds himself turned into a dog by his wicked stepmother who has her eyes set on ruling the nine kingdoms. There are trolls,  dwarfs, goblins, all sorts of characters who make up this world and even snow white makes an appearance. Transferred from DVD to Blu-ray, this movie now takes on a whole new dimension with its beautiful photography, stunning landscapes, and castles that make up the settings that are characters find themselves in. A long movie at 447 minutes, but a wonderful weekend getaway, so grab the popcorn, close to drapes, kickback and find your way to the 10th Kingdom.",1496966400,5,1122,4.962765957446808

1080172,5,6305818282,"I love this series SO MUCH!!!!! I've found it to be a wonderful take on many well known and loved fairy tales/nursery rhymes delivered in a very unique way.

The synopsis: there is our world and there is a magical world. The magical world is referred to as The Nine Kingdoms with each kingdom being ruled by a different fairy tale character such as Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, The Troll King, etc. The story begins when the heir to the Snow White kingdom is, through a series of unpredictable magical events, transported to New York City. There he meets a disillusioned young woman who is looking for adventure and her disgruntled, overworked father. The prince is pursued by foes, and the three of them wind up going back to The Nine Kingdoms to help the prince claim his throne and restore order. On their adventure they encounter a plethora of fairy tale characters, tropes, and locations as well as some new ones. There is a darker, more sinister side to the story as well, but I don't want to spoil anything.

Admittedly The 10th Kingdom is a little campy, but it's just because it's whimsical and doesn't take itself too seriously. I would liken it to that same quality found in Doctor/Dr. Who where it has its campy moments but is ultimately a really good story with compelling characters. There are a few painful moments (singing ring anyone?) but overall I and everyone I've shared it with have thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. There is a balance between silliness and seriousness, and the story has just enough action, romance, drama, and comedy to keep almost anyone interested. I first watched it with my dad when it aired on TV forever ago and it has remained a staple in my fantasy schlock collection alongside titles like Hallmark's ""The Magical Legend of the Leprechauns"", Terry Pratchett's Discworld films (namely ""Hogfather"" and ""The Colour of Magic""), ""Merlin"" (the one with Sam Neill), ""Labrynth"" (with David Bowie), ""Legend"" (with Tom Cruise and Tim Curry), and the like. My husband and I binge watch the whole thing about once a year or so and it's a much loved tradition.

Honestly, I wish there was more, but I feel like this came out just a few years before its time. As the title of my review implies, I think that The 10th Kingdom would be much more widely known and have been better received if it had come out as a Netflix series, or even if it had been on the Syfy network. In fact, I think The 10th Kingdom has a similar feel sometimes to the Syfy Channel's Merlin series (which I also really enjoyed). There have been a lot of Amazon reviews of people who absolutely hate The 10th Kingdom because they were expecting something like the TV show Once, and honestly they are nothing alike (other than their use of the same fantasy characters). Personally I prefer The 10th Kingdom, but to each their own.

One final note. There have been other reviews that say it's inappropriate for children. I would tend to disagree, having been in 11 years old when it came out and I first saw it. Additionally, my elder brother, his wife and I, would watch this with my young nephews (aged 8 and younger) and they all found it charming and hilarious. However, my parents chose not to shelter me as a kid, so I think that certainly has something to do with it. And with young children they are usually innocent to a lot of the more mature jokes and references being made anyway. But again, to each their own. For curious parents, there is no overt nudity or sex, the violence is usually magical, slapstick, or implied via dialogue rather than shown on screen. There are a few words used that could be considered inappropriate for young viewers (again depending on your parenting style) like ""kiss my ass,"" but certainly no F-bombs or anything like that. There are some suggestive situations like people drinking alcohol/being drunk or people being overtly flirtatious, but it never amounts to anything. So I would leave it up to parental discretion.

To sum up, The 10th Kingdom is awesome and just a whole lot of fun. It's a seriously underrated fantasy gem and you should give it a try. Honestly, Amazon Video has it for a few dollars, the DVD is $5 and the BluRay is $15. I think I bought my DVD copy in 2004 for close to $30, and it's been totally worth it. I didn't even realize there was a BluRay until today and I'm totally buying it because why wouldn't I? So seriously, what have you got to lose?",1486080000,,4426,4.597468354430379

Their whole shtick about the ""Brothers Gibb"" is priceless. Wolf was of course awesome and you can't beat John Laroquette. This miniseries was also made back before sci-fi/fantasy had to be more adult and dark with all the monotone grey and green we have been subjected to since the reboot of Battlestar Galactica.

While there are some gory spots in this miniseries, overall, the colorfulness and fun are what is missing from a lot of entertainment today. Don't get me wrong, I love Grimm and Once Upon a Time, but this reminds me of how much more lighthearted America was prior to 911. (It's perhaps ironic that the twin towers are shown ""falling"" in the opening credits.)

ABC's Galavant is perhaps one of the few things that has come out today that recaptures that sense of whimsy. I think we were lucky to get two seasons out of that. If you like this, check out Galavant.",1472947200,,1052,4.362244897959184

1080618,5,6305818282,"This review is for the Mill Creek blu-ray, which was released in 2015. This release is a huge improvement over past dvd efforts. It is offered here in widescreen. It has not been cropped or zoomed from the original 4:3 television airing; you are here seeing much more information on the sides than ever before. It also features a remarkable isolated score option which spotlights the nice and underestimated music by Anne Dudley. An isolated score option for a television mini-series is very rare and much appreciated. The picture quality is much better than the dvd but the CGI effects were probably not prepared in modern 1080p; they look upscaled from 720p. The resolution for some of them is not very good, but that's the way the movie was shot; no effort was made to reshoot or upgrade them. The quality for the rest of the scenes is about 10 times better than previous home video efforts--it's night and day. Black levels are terrific; color saturation is just right and you will see a much sharper picture than ever before. The mini-series was aired on five different nights; therefore there are five different episodes including beginning and end credits. Previous dvd releases had edited the five segments into a single ten-hour movie. This blu-ray restores the segments to their separate five episodes as originally broadcast, including the proper credits. This release has dropped some minor dvd features from the original release including the 10 kingdoms map and cast and crew click-through features. It does still include the ""Making Of"" featurette. The mini would appeal to anyone a fan of fantasy films in general, Lord of the Rings, Once Upon a Time and so on. The film is good for familiy viewing, as it was a Hallmark release. There are a few slightly gory scenes with the Troll king, minor violence with arrows hitting their marks, scary moments with the Witch and so on; it would probably be rated PG if it were released to theaters. Probably best for children ages 8 and up. This release is highly recommended to those wishing to upgrade, or for those wanting to see the mini-series for the first time.",1448409600,29,2124,4.821917808219178

1080814,4,6305818282,"Amazing movie!  A's this is one that will stick with you.  An amazing story set in the realm of fantasy, but many, many, many years after our story book hero's have lived and mostly died.  I only with there had been more of these made, ore even a series started..  there was a lot of depth that could have been probed with the extra characters, other kingdoms, items laying about that may have needed returning, all kinds of ways to go with that.

I saw this when it originally aired.  Then found it again at a local Blockbuster (remember those?) But that one was on two discs; parts A and B being on disc one that you had to turn over, and the third on it's own.

A few years later I found it on sale at another Blockbuster (what are the odds?) So I snatched it up.  My version is full-screen and is on three discs with their own snap-in section.  Also the movie plays like a movie should and not like a tv series, with opening credits for where the studio breaks would be for nightly airings.

So, for as much as I'd love to order a new one just to get a HD version, I'd really hate to get one with the ""episode breaks"" in it and spoiling the movie atmosphere I've come to love.",1421712000,,1180,4.135964912280702

1081026,4,6305818282,"I like this mini series for what it is.  It's not a spectacular miniseries, and I don't think the acting talent was used to their fullest, but it's a clever story that should hold your attention for the several hours that it runs.

I don't have too much to say about it, other than it is a made for TV production, and therefore has that feel to it, in spite of being shot on location in both the States (NY) and Europe (Austria or Switzerland).  The CGI is okay, the acting from the A-list talent is decent enough, and there's enough production values injected into this thing to hold some of the more jaded viewers.

Relationships and blood oathes abound as ancient hatreds and curses confront true love and other things that make fairy stories interesting to read and watch.

Give it a shot.",1393372800,,793,4.479166666666667

I highly recommend this as a magical interpretation of original fairy tales with a modern twist; everyone I have shown my well used copy to has wanted their own copy. I cannot wait to get more copies in March, and I hope you get yours too.",1359158400,3,558,4.427184466019417
1081115,5,6305818282,"This was a very interesting, entertaining, silly, creative, and adorable miniseries. To be frank it is a bit cartoonish, campy, and ridiculous. However, once you accept that fact and just go along for the crazy ride, then you will surely love this story. Those wishing for a realistic story or a simple fairytale should look elsewhere. The first 30 minutes of the miniseries moves very slowly, and is a bit boring. However, once you get into the storyline you will enjoy it immensely. The story is basically a compilation of all of the Disney fairytales, the Brothers Grimm stories, Aesops fables, and Mother Goose rhymes, It takes place 200 years after all of the famous fairytale stories concluded. The story in itself is basically a hybrid of the tv show, ""Once Upon A Time"", the movie ""Stardust"", and the tv movie, ""Jack and The Beanstalk - The Real Story"". If you enjoyed any of the previous mentioned stories then you will definitely enjoy this one. It has a great deal of wit, goofiness, and heart. As I stated before, the acting ranged from terribly cheesy, decent, to wonderful. However, all of the characters were charming in their own right. That is why I was able to focus on the story, and zaniness of the characters rather than the quality of the acting. My one complaint would be that they never made a continuation of the story as the ending suggested they would do. Had they avoided the last couple of sentences then everything would have ended nicely. Personally, the Wolf was my absolute favorite character. He was adorable, hilarious, and charming. He was a joy to watch. I also greatly enjoyed the music, especially the use of modern music. In short, this is definitely worth a rental.",1358553600,,1706,4.747474747474747

Still it was a great cast and seems to have offered ideas for newer series such as Grimm and Once. Worth the investment and the screen time.",1357948800,,323,3.953846153846154

1081161,3,6305818282,"I bounced back and forth from being entertained by this movie, to being utterly bored.  There were just so many flips of character, changes of scene, and other things that made it hard to rate the movie as consistent, and at times I even felt like I was watching a completely different movie.

Virginia has grown up with her father in New York City after her mother left them at an early age.  She's bicycling to her job as a waitress when she accidentally hits a dog that runs out in front of her.  She quickly realizes this is no ordinary dog though when a group of trolls and a strange man come after her when she takes him home.  They are chased into a magic portal (along with her father) where they learn the dog is a prince under a spell and an evil queen is trying to kill them and take over the nine kingdoms that are in this world.  Virginia and her father just want to get home, but a strange sense of duty, and a very persistent Wolf who fancies himself in love with Virginia, make getting home difficult.

Characters:
Kimberly Williams as Virginia Lewis
John Larroquette as Anthony Lewis
Scott Cohen as Wolf
Dianne Wiest as Christine White
Daniel Lapaine as Prince Wendell
Rutger Hauer as The Huntsman
Hugh O'Gorman, Dawnn Lewis, and Jeremiah Birkett as Burly, Blabberwort, and Bluebell (Trolls)

I have to say, the only character I really enjoyed in this movie was Cohen as the Wolf.  There wasn't something so endearing about him, and I just couldn't help think that Virginia didn't deserve him.  Now maybe this is just my knack for picking psychotic men, but I really thought Wolf was cute and worthy of love, despite how strange and sometimes enraged he could become.  At least he honestly did seem to have feelings for Virginia, even if he was spurned so many times.  And he was funny, his mannerisms and little speeches did have a wolfish quality about them and even though some of the humor was groan worthy, he by far was the most entertaining character.  I wish I could say the same for Virginia and her father but they were slightly idiotic and selfish and never seemed to redeem themselves throughout the series.  They'd be on their way to doing something good when one or the other would be distracted by something they wanted instead.  And while I normally like Williams in a lot of her roles, I can't say she did a fantastic job in this one, it was just too all over the place in terms of acting.  Wiest did a good job as the evil Queen and she appeared to be the only other genuine character in this movie that was there to make a point rather than a laugh.

I couldn't figure out what the main point of this movie was.  Whether it was just for the comedy, or if there was an actual lesson buried under the humor.  Certainly it was very funny in parts, but it almost had to be to hide the matricide, murder, violence, filicide, and sexual innuendos.  This is not a kid's movie but rather for adults fond of the fantasy genre.  And it doesn't scrimp on the violence because we actually see someone get kicked brutally or a severed head waved around or other like things.  I don't have a problem with such scenes, but I know a lot of people do, and they probably shouldn't watch this series.  I do have to say that the plot was almost a journey, they went from point to point searching for something and while they didn't necessarily learn anything along the way, they still had adventure and it was interesting to watch.  There were a few slow parts (especially when Wolf wasn't there) that I could have done without, but I didn't think there was too much of the movie that shouldn't be there, even if it is hours and hours long (466 minutes).

The cinematography was pretty well done in this.  Some of it was cheesy, like the graphics in the Kissing Town, but I think it was supposed to be that way.  And I liked the costuming and other effects that were used to make this movie seem as if it were in a fairy tale kingdom.  And while the graphics for the mirror were a bit sub-par, the rest were well done.  The music, I can't say I particularly enjoyed any of it, but it didn't want to make me rip my hair out either.  It was kind of just there in the background.

This was a funny, entertaining show, but it did have a lot of flaws.  I probably wouldn't watch it again, which is why I'm rating it average.  But it did provide some amusement for a one time view.

I highly recommend it for anyone who likes semi-fantasy stories.  It is about 8 hours long and my husband and I spend a whole day watching it.  It had great actors, lots of action, and a pretty good story.  I have never been disappointed in any video or dvd bought from Amazon.  They are the best.",1350604800,,468,4.133333333333334

The cast is phenomenal, and the heroes are extremely likable, and the villains you love to hate. Kimberly Williams is totally convincing as the ""girl next door,"" daughter who just wants to be happy, and John Larroquette is perfect as her lovable goofball father, both are who extremely relatable to anyone who feels stuck in their usual ordinary lives. The fairy tale characters are no less memorable, especially Scott Cohen as Wolf, and Dianne Wiest as the Evil Queen.

Though the movie is over seven hours long, it never gets boring.

There is some mild violence, so I wouldn't recommend it for very young children. This isn't Disneyfied versions of classic fairy tales, and it does include the darker parts of traditional stories.",1345507200,,1224,5.6775956284153
1081212,1,6305818282,I didn't get a chance to see the movie.  I didn't know that it was a Region 2 version.  I saw the 10th Kingdom when it first came out and I enjoyed it so I decided to order a keepsake which turned out to be a bust.  Just be careful about what you order.  I didn't know that there was more than one version.,1343001600,2,306,3.734375
1081213,5,6305818282,I love this miniseries! We have the Vhs...which is about worn out. Now we've got the special edition Dvd. :)  the book does follow the film so very completely.  It is a great family film but there are some very adult scenes. Not for children under 7-8.  Well worth the six (I believe) hours!,1342483200,,291,4.351851851851852
1081214,5,6305818282,"I had been searching for this movie for years. Then I gave up looking for The 10th Kingdom on DVD and started looking for the movie on VHS. Thank goodness that I still have a VHS machine that works great. Bingo I found a great company to supply me with the movie that I have been searching for for so long. Its on VHS but that is ok. The 10th Kingdom puts a whole new spin on a modern Fairy Tale. Every minute of this film is exciting and it just keeps moving. It dosen't matter what way you watch this movie just watch it, it is like no other!!!",1341792000,,546,3.9727272727272727

Before it was available for ITUNES or Amazon instant video I downloaded the movie into my phone.  Now the Blu ray HD just came out.  I am an avid fan and viewer of the movie so yes I bought the HD blu ray and the HD Amazon instant video!  Then I also downloaded the entire audio from the movie into my IPhone.  Sounds fantastic just like an audiobook.  I have watched this movie with my family many times over the years.  About the blu ray/instant video there is a huge difference in color, clarity and sound.  Looks fantastic, couldn't be happier.  Watching the movie with just the soundtrack is very interesting, in a good way.  Also the one special feature of the making of the movie is not the same as the DVD.  I prefer the DVD version with John Larequeete.  Don't know why they did this.  Overall extremely satisfied.  I highly recommend this blu ray.",1338163200,3,967,4.324022346368715

Other than that, I love this movie and am glad to own it!  Even though it's a region 2, it works on my laptop as well as on my region-free DVD player.  It's a cute, funny story, with some rather ridiculous parts, but if you can take those in stride, it is enjoyable.  I'd recommend it to anyone.",1335916800,,450,4.126436781609195

1081264,5,6305818282,"This movie is one of my favorites. I would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy. Everytime I watch this I see different things in it I didn't see before. The one warning I will give is,it is a very long movie since it was a mini-series on tv about 10hrs long. It is worth the time to watch it though. Hope you enjoy it!!!",1333497600,,325,4.015384615384615
1081265,4,6305818282,I LOVE this movie and have been looking for it on DVD for years but I don't understand why everywhere I look it's $100.  That's completely stupid.,1333324800,,146,4.407407407407407
1081266,3,6305818282,this movie is a good movie. It is really ment for people that are between the ages of 8- 12. Good fairy tale movie and funny twist to fairy tale stories. However any at any age it is a good movie for the kid at heart.,1332028800,,217,3.739130434782609

1081268,4,6305818282,"When this miniseries first came out, I was hooked.  LOVED the Wolf. When it came to DVD, I noticed there were scenes missing that could have easily been included on the DVD.  But, it is still very imaginative and enjoyable.",1331164800,,223,4.55
1081289,5,6305818282,"First of all I wish I would have bought this when it was widely available, but It's certainly not out of the question for this to get a re-release on DVD and/or Blu-Ray, so I wouldn't spend $80.00 on this movie even though it is pure entertainment gold.  I'm quite partial to Hallmark movies and realize that what is seen on screen is done with a limited budget, so I applaud them for how good everything looks in spite of being relatively low budget as compared to today's Hollywood Blockbusters.  If you like movies like Jack and the Beanstalk, Gulliver's Travels and Arabian Nights you'll love this movie.  Although this movie is only for those who are still able to suspend their disbelief as adults...",1330992000,,706,4.632
1081290,2,6305818282,"When I was deemed old enough to watch it at 14 y/o, I liked it. It was interesting to see where the characters went, and other people/creatures they met. I didn't care for the overdone sexual inneundo, though.
Now some nine years later, I cannot enjoy it as an adult. I guess as a teen, I took in the little romantic story and the occasionally funny joke. Laroquette's character is the typical fumbling dad, who complains about his job. Four fairy tale creatures come into NY via a mirror, God only knows why the mirror exists. The three most annoying characters are the trolls, who yell ""Suckin' elf!"" every five minutes. It wasn't even funny the first time. The main character, Virginia, accidentally goes to the fairy tale kingdom with her father and the fairy tale characters because of a hackneyed series of events. Most of the story then is trying to find the last mirror so Virginia and her dad can get back to NY, and Virginia's werewolf love interest trying to keep himself from eating her and/or having sex with her. There is no content, only silly, slapstick jokes. Stay away from this. Oh yeah, and for the last time, THIS IS NOT INTENDED AS A KID'S MOVIE (see parents' angry reviews).",1328313600,,1197,4.598130841121495
1081291,5,6305818282,"I first saw this when it aired on television ten years ago and immediately ordered the VHS tapes and mailed them off to a young friend in Australia. I don't think I have ever given so much pleasure with a single gift. She and her friends watched them obsessively during their twelfth and thirteenth years.

I recently decided to revisit this series via rental and was pleasantly surprised, so much so that I am determined to own this DVD set as soon as possible. Virginia is a young woman who lives in New York with her hapless father. While walking through Central Park, she rescues a dog, actually an enchanted prince in disguise, who has escaped from one of the nine fairytale kingdoms into our world through the magical auspices of a mirror. The requisite evil queen has sent trolls and a werewolf to re-capture the dog and thus the adventure begins with Virginia, her father, the dog Prince Wendell and Wolfy all going back to the nine kingdoms and then trying to find the magic mirror and their way home.

All of the classic fairytales and fairytale characters are here, but they have been delightfully twisted for a modern audience. The character wolf is wonderful and funny. During his sojourn in our world he falls for Virginia and seeks therapy for this: ""I don't know if I want to love her or eat her!"" he wails to a stone-faced therapist.

The 10th Kingdom is funny, moving and intricate and while others have complained that it drags, I have to disagree with that assessment. I was enchanted as I was meant to be. Appropriate viewing for the entire family as any off-color jokes are designed to be amusing to the adults and over the heads of any little ones. Recommended in its own rite and as a means of introducing children to the classic Grimm tales through further reading. Wonderul!",1327276800,,1800,4.61875

1081294,5,6305818282,"I was referred to this DVD a few years ago and thoroughly enjoyed watching it as a DVD. If it were released today, it would be a huge hit. The concept is similar to the new TV series ONCE UPON A TIME or GRIMM but done with the style and deft touch of the first SHREK. It is a play on fairy tale characters interacting with modern day New Yorkers. There are scenes - one in particular of two villains in a rowboat - that make you laugh so hard you can't breathe. If you look at the credits, you'll be amazed at the well-known actors in this not so well known film. I've watched it twice now and will likely do so again...and again.",1324512000,4,630,4.048
1081295,5,6305818282,"I watched this with my family when it initial came out on NBC.  Years later I was talking to my husband about it and found out he had not seen it, so...off to Amazon I went to find it, because of course Amazon has EVERYTHING.  I love this series.  It takes childhood fairy tales, puts them into modern day perspective, and adds a little twist.  I will say that while overall the theme is pretty innocent there are certainly pieces of this series that should be known about before airing to children.  Not because they're bad, per se...but because as a parent you should be aware of what may be getting ready to influence your kids.

There are a family of trolls in this show who, aside from looking ugly, don't look scary.  However, their favorite phrase is ""Suck an elf.""  Not cursing by any means but...if your kid has a habit of picking up on things that are said repeatedly (as this term is)... make sure you're aware that it's in there.  I remember being younger when I watched it and my parents making it known they weren't real keen on that phrase.

The second thing is that there are 2 times (that I can remember right off hand) that characters in the movie go to the evil queens grave.  It's not bloody or murderous or anything of that nature, but it has a certain creep out factor (as they show the evil queen who is portrayed to have been dead for many years) and she's a little creepy.  Mind you I was also the kid who had nightmares over ET.  She's pretty much bones, there might be a very thin layer of skin over her, and I believe she's in a gown so it's not a full skeleton.  But...if you have a kid that freaks out and gets nightmares easily be it because of their age or their personality, you may want to be aware of where those parts are if you're going to let them watch the series with you.

Those 2 pieces aside, the rest is pretty harmless and all in good fun.  It's not animated (at least until the characters travel to kissing town) so it probably won't hold the audience of a really young child.  I think I was about 12 or so maybe when this was on NBC and I enjoyed it then...",1322524800,,2104,4.22

It is such a well-rounded story, sprinkled with both overt and subtle references to the fairy tales we grew up hearing and reading about.  The end of the series hinted at a sequel, but after 11 years and no news, I assume either it hasn't been written or it hasn't been picked up by a network.

I popped it into my DVD player, and it worked! Bonus: I got it for less than half the price of the previous copy I bought! I love Amazon. Oh, and the person I got it from also included a note for me in the package. I love getting notes like that. I feel like my purchase is valued, unlike other places like Ebay.
The 10th Kingdom takes all the fairy tales you read as a child and morphs them into one. It has romance, action, adventure, horror, ect. all in one! I definitely recommend watching this movie.

We had owned the movied for several years, which is how he fell in love with it, but then something happened to the DVD and it was unfixable.  Thinking it would be easy to replace, I put off doing so until just before he came to visit when I found that the movie is hard to find and even if you can find it it is very expensive.  Enter Amazon.  Found it for less than half than I did elsewhere and received it in time for his visit.  Now to the movie......

How do you describe the indescribable?  Virginia, whose father is a building superintendent, is a waitress who lives near Central Park.  Meets a dog, who in reality is a prince, and travels via a mirror to a distant land where she encounters trolls, an evil queen, a prince who in reality is a dog and actually becomes part of several kids' fairy tales.  In the end, good conquers evil and everyone lives happily ever after.  See what I mean by indescribable?  A really fun, family movie.  Wish they had made the sequel.

Ordered a ""used"" VHS of The 10th Kingdom (1/4 the price of a new one) and got it within 1 week.  You would never know it was used because it was in a new jacket and plays very clearly with no commercials.  Thanks Amazon :)",1308787200,,349,3.7534246575342465
1081345,5,6305818282,"I remembered liking the 10th Kingdom quite a lot when it aired on TV, but it had been 11 years since then, so I was a bit fuzzy on parts of the story line and what I particularly liked. I bought the DVD set quite some time ago, but had not watched it. Recently I discussed with my son if he thought our 11 year old grand daughter might enjoy it. He had also watched it when it originally aired, and so was familiar with it, and agreed that she might. We decided on an informal schedule of get-togethers, and the plan and the program have been a hit with the family (again in some cases).

The 10th Kingdom was one of the last of the old style mega-mini-series ... before a mini series mostly became four hours of a story aired on two consecutive nights. We haven't even seen much of that type in a really long while. Evidently reality programming which airs multiple times a week has killed the mini-series, at least for the time being. It runs 10 hours, so its not one of your pop it in the player on a whim selections.

Its story is interesting and funny, as a father and his grown daughter are drawn by unusual events into a fairy tale world filled with the descendants of names we're all familiar with. They fall into helping a prince, who has been turned into a dog, reclaim his rightful place, and in doing so they must match wits with an evil witch and her servants.

John Larroquette (try typing THAT three times fast) provides much of the comedy as the greedy but good hearted father. Scott Cohen almost steals the show as the always hungry but good hearted werewolf. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is solid as the pretty daughter, often indignant at the actions of others around her, but possessing the good sense to keep everyone somewhat grounded and on course (yes, she's good hearted). Ed O'Neill isn't given a lot to work with as the Troll King, but his three children and their fascination for the BeeGees are VERY funny. Their conjecture and subsequent alibi for being trapped in an elevator could be laugh out loud funny for some. Daniel Lapaine as Prince Wendell see-saws between being the irritating spoiled price, and an engaging hero. Let's just say that similar to Hoffman in Tootsie, he is a better Prince as a dog than he is a Prince as a man. Rutger Hauer provides a seriously scary tone as the murderous Huntsman (not good hearted). Dianne Wiest is also seriously ominous as the Evil Queen (also not good hearted).

Throughout most of the 10 hours, our trio of heroes journey through the fairy tale Kingdoms, encountering interesting and amusing situations which will all remind you directly and indirectly of elements of fairy tales by those such as the Grimm brothers or Hans Christian Anderson. This is one of those rare pieces of programming that is equally fun for adults and kids at the same time, while containing no content that parents will have to wince at and hope the kids missed.

However, I don't recommend that you pay the full price listed as of the date of this review (more than seventy dollars ... I think listed by an ""Amazon Associate""). There are plenty of used copies to be had for MUCH less. I routinely buy used copies of DVDs and Blu-ray's, and I've never once had cause to regret the money saved. Every one I've received has played flawlessly.",1308441600,,3292,4.526050420168067

Years later, when I was not longer able to access that Tape, I looked this up. I was definitely not dissapointed with the product. It was simplistic, but exactly what I needed.

The actual effects within the movie can seem tacky, and the movie kind of runs on. It doesn't buy you in the first fifteen minutes.

You have to give it a chance, and once you do it will sell itself. It really is, excuse me, an enchanting story that twists the fairytales and gives it back the flavor of the Grimm Brothers that Disney sort of took away.

1081405,5,6305818282,"A miniseries that originally aired on Showtime, The 10th Kingdom is a very well done fantasy movie that flows steadily from one segment to the next. Based loosely on most of the childhood fairy tales we grew up with, the plot takes a father and adult daughter into an enchanted land made up of 9 kingdoms.  The ""real"" world is christened ""the 10th Kingdom"" by troll siblings when they accidentally stumble through a portal created by a magic mirror into our reality.  It is this portal that transports the father and daughter pair into the fantasy realm, where they must try to help an enchanted prince reclaim his throne while searching for a way home.

The 10th Kingdom is highly recommended family entertainment, which is more suited to ages 13 and older. Some mild profanity (""suck an elf"") and sexual innuendos may not be suited to young children.",1295827200,,852,4.743243243243243

I also admit, I find the first hour or so to be dull, but after that, when Virginia and her father come to the kingdoms, the pace picks up and the storyline is much better. I have so many favorite parts that I can't pick just one or two, but I recommend this to my friends- and I got one of my friends hooked too!

What kept me glued to the story was seeing how they were going to acquire the mirror to the modern world every time they came close but always being foiled and constantly having to pursue it again and again. The father and daughter found out that they had more courage and determination in them at the end of their journey then they had at the beginning of the story.  Being chased by trolls, gypsies, and a huntsman-- The girl being cursed with endlessly growing hair and her father being cursed with bad luck-- They are accompanied on their journeys with a guy who is half man, half wolf-- and an ending that you can only see by buying this dvd!

Larroquette is basically on autopilot. The most prominent character (whether you like it or not) is Wolf, played by the obnoxious Scott Cohen. To be fair, Cohen does his best with what material he's got; with his unshaven wild-eyed demeanor and flowing coat, he actually makes a cool hero... when he's not snarling and muttering about bacon every two seconds.

Kimberly Williams is bland at first, but eventually starts to grow on you. Particularly Worthy of note is Daniel Lapaine, playing dual roles as Prince Wendell and the dog. As the retriever trapped in Wendell's stolen body, he steals every scene.

The effects budget is good -- for ten years ago -- and is accompanied by gorgeous, Irish-seeming outdoor scenery. (Where did they film this, anyway? It looks great). Story-wise, 10K takes a while to get going:  Things finally pick up when Kimberly & co. begin touring the Nine Kingdoms; my favorites are Little Lamb Village - run by a medieval analog of Paris Hilton - and a cheesy Las Vegas parody called Kissing Town.

1081553,4,6305818282,"Architecturally the mini-series is sound, it has all the right elements to make a memorable experience. The plot moves at the right pace and throws in a couple of curve-balls. There's a diverse range of locations and characters and it really helps to immerse the viewers in the world.

The major gripes I have is how the DVD itself shows it's age. The content does a little, but it's not nearly as detrimental to the experience as the package itself. Aware of the age of the DVD itself, and the newer release (pretty much un-available anywhere) the way the DVD's were composed is definitely not the best way to do things. Unfortunately I didn't have the chance to see the original broadcast, but I can imagine I would've preferred that ""method-of-delivery"" a little better. Originally the series had 5, two hour episodes. This package places them all into an ""episode-soup"". There are no clear distinctions between the episodes save for the obligatory made for tv fade outs. Each disc has a chunk of the entire story, and simply stops when the space on disc has run out - prompting for the next disc. However, the authoring has left out the fact that the updated version uses 3-Discs instead of one double sided disc and one single sided - meaning the prompts ask for the next ""side"". It even has the gall to ask for the mythical Side C, which has led me to believe the DVD was authored in another one of the 10 Kingdoms where DVD's have three sides.

Assuming (however unlikely it is) the series gets a newer, updated version, I can definately say the viewer would be more entertained by a collection of 5 discs, each with their respective 2 hour episodes. DVD manufacturer prices have dropped far enough that the extra two discs would cost next to nothing to make, and the issue of waning attention span near the 3 hour mark on the same ""episode"" would dissipate.

Lastly, Region 4 is completely left in the dark with this release, I think we had the VHS all those years ago, but it's pretty much impossible to find here.

1081620,5,6305818282,"...but it certainly kept me riveted to my seat for 7 hours straight. The 10th Kingdom is something I remember seeing in the video store over and over again when it first came out, but it was never enough to tempt me to watch it. Honestly, I believed it would be a little sub-par on every level, and was biased because it was made-for-TV. Even now, after finally deciding to watch it, I was looking at the case and having second thoughts. Finally, last night, I decided to watch one episode, and if it was no good, I could just turn it off and never look at it again. And you know what? I never turned it off. Not until it was done, and then I wished it had gone on forever. I was hooked almost immediately.

I've adore mythology, fairy and folk tales, so it was nice to see so many winks at those stories of old. Especially some of the more original, non-Disney tellings of the better known ones. Like the wicked queen poisoning Snow White three times, with the corset and comb. Not to mention how they weaved in so many others, such as Rapunzel and Little Red Riding Hood. Plus, I'm every bit the sentimental romantic, and the story of Virginia and Wolf was pitch perfect the whole time. the

A small word of caution on how this will ""enchant audiences of all ages"": I ended up watching this with my 11-year-old sister, and even though it's from Hallmark and was classified as family entertainment, there were more than a few moments that were clearly meant for adult audiences. The evil villains are truly evil, and there is a good deal of violence and a smattering of language, and the story took the opportunity to explore the wolf's legendary identity in fairy tales as a lecherous predator (see Neil Jordan's film, The Company of Wolves).  I adore gritty, violent, lusty fairy tales, and these not-so-family-friendly aspects surprised and delighted me, but I still think it's worth noting before you sit down for a family viewing with the little ones.

So, in the end, if you are ever in a situation similar to mine, and don't know whether or not to pick this up...do yourself a favor, and just watch the darn thing!",1230768000,,2122,4.489637305699482

1081678,5,6305818282,"10th Kingdom was a mini series originally aired on NBC in 2000.  Although the ratings at the time were not what everyone hoped they would be, the series did, and still does, have a loyal following - and with good reason.

A stellar cast, attention to detail, witty, intelligent writing, beautiful locations and good old fashioned fantasy make this 'movie' great.  I've often described it to my friends as a ""believable fairy tale.""  The characters from the fantasy realm are truly believable and very seldom campy.  The main characters from 'the real world' are believable in their interaction with the fantasy world because they accept they're there, but still question why you have to ""guess my name before you can have my magic axe"" and other such wonderful scenes.

If you enjoy fantasy or fairy tale type movies (I'll say it's somewhat akin to Stardust although 10 Kingdom is more reality based) that are family friendly but made to cater to grown-ups, you should definitely watch 10th Kingdom.  And if you're looking at this review, you're likely considering purchasing it, in which case you're probably already in love with it.

1081684,3,6305818282,"The Tenth Kingdom
After a television showing on NBC in the late 90s, this cult classic took off. Despite its horrible ratings when appearing on NBC, The Tenth Kingdom has gained a huge following. The original airing showed this series in five two-hour episodes. This video collection shows it on three separate VHS tapes. There are no cuts between the shows. You will see no openings or credits for the show, so it all feels like one big epic tale and not just a television show.

Virginia, a young waitress, is living with her father, Tony, and living a fairly normal life. Little do they know that their epic tale was about to unfold. In another dimension, trouble is brewing. Trolls have attacked Snow White Memorial Prison and they have unleashed an Evil Queen. Snow White's killer herself trained this Queen. The Queen quickly explains her plan to take over the Kingdom with the help of the Trolls. Prince Wendell arrives at the prison shortly after in a stop before he reaches his coronation ceremony to be crowned King. The Queen casts a horrible spell on him that makes him trade places with her dog. Wendell escapes in dog form and finds his way to a magic traveling mirror.

The mirror leads him to Virginia's world, which is New York. Virginia ends up hitting Wendell with her bike and has to help him. As time goes on, eventually her and her father get sucked into the Fairy Tale world where Wendell is from and must try to escape. They have Trolls, Hunters, and others trying to stop them.

This Series isn't one of my favorites. I personally feel that most of the acting just isn't sincere enough. Virginia may be about to be killed, and all she can mutter is ""Ouch, stop hurting me."" There is no real emotion drawn from the characters. The Troll Siblings are very annoying characters. The only real character that I felt developed well is Wolf. Wolf accompanies Virginia on her journey, but he could possibly be under the influence of the Queen. He is probably the only character I liked in this tale.

The series is one that progresses well though. Most of Part 1 is boring to watch. Once you pop in the second tape though, it appears to have gotten slightly better. The third tape finally reveals some emotion from Virginia that I wish had been there the entire movie. If you can just stick with it, the series actually turns into a pretty nice show. Most of what happens is predictable, but that doesn't seem to take away from it.

Most of the show they are looking for the traveling mirror that just seems to keep escaping their grasps. Virginia often focuses on trying to help others though when she has the mirror and ends up losing it in the process. Eventually, you just get the feeling that they are never going to get that mirror.

One huge problem I had with the series was the Evil Queen. In the beginning, she is made to look weak. The Troll King often hinders her, despite her being an all-powerful magical Queen. The Queen never comes off as a threat or as even powerful. With her being the antagonist in the story, this is not good at all.

I won't say this is the worst series I've ever watched. I had fun with it, but the acting just isn't sincere enough. The funny parts aren't funny enough and the serious parts aren't serious enough. Still, the story does feel like an epic tale when you look back at all they have done. I wouldn't run out and buy it, but it is something to check into if you have some spare cash.",1217808000,6,3450,4.475357710651828
1081685,4,6305818282,"When I first started watching this story, it was a little slow at first. It took awhile for me to get into the overall plotline, although it was quite funny and entertaining at times. Virginia's father (played bytheway by John Laroquette) was the most annoying character in the entire story, but he slowly and surely redeemed himself, at least to me.

Since this whole thing is so long, it has plenty of time for character development. I don't really recall specifics very well of this, but I do remember being impressed with the job done here. I would agree with those who say this is NOT a kids' show, but at the same time I think there's plenty of non-kids'-stuff that would go over the heads of most little ones anyway.

It is also perfectly acceptable for the main characters to be so self absorbed that they did not help the prince to get his kingdom, but even put him off at times (I don't understand why Prince Wendell didn't complain or run off and find a way to fight the queen himself). With teen pregnancy rates being so high, we don't need another movie that treats sex so lightly. Neither do we need to promote a selfish lifestyle, but rather a life which includes the courage to fight for something bigger than yourself.

1081709,5,6305818282,"I have watched all seven and a half hours (or so) of this miniseries many times, and I still haven't gotten tired of it. And that is from someone who normally only watches even really good movies only once or maybe twice. Why do I love this one so much that it is in my top ten, and is also in my top ten viewed movies of all time?

The very basic plot is that Virginia (played by the very talented Kimberly Williams), a young woman still living with her father (played by the equally talented John Larroquette) in New York City, encounters a dog who is actually an enchanted prince from another dimension, the Nine Kingdoms, in which all our fairy tales actually happened.

The prince came through a magic traveling mirror to get to New York. He is followed by a trio of trolls, Burly, Blabberwort, and Bluebell, who are a bit less than the brightest bulbs in the bunch. These trolls were sent on the behest of, of course, a wicked queen (played perfectly by Dianne Wiest) who wants to take over the Nine Kingdoms, and she doesn't care who dies on the way. She's also sent Wolf (played wonderfully by Scott Cohen), a man who is part werewolf and considerably brighter than the trolls, after the trolls to make sure they do a good job.

Trolls, prince, Wolf, Virginia, and her father all end up back in the Nine Kingdoms. Through various events, Virginia and her father quickly find themselves trapped there, and much of the movie *seems* to be about the two of them, traveling with the prince, trying to find the magic traveling mirror again while being pursued by the trolls and the wicked queen. After many plot twists and turns, the story comes to a grand climax, with everyone getting pretty much what they deserve.

I say ""seems to be,"" because there is a much deeper story line going on, which I won't reveal because it would be a major spoiler. Suffice it to say that it is beautifully developed, makes perfect sense, and rounds the story out even more richly. It is partly for this more serious story line that I love this movie so much.  I would love to discuss this story line, but I know a lot of people dislike spoilers. Suffice it to say that it has to do with a theme that not many movies seem to address.

In addition, the writing is unaffected and the story is fun. It can seem a bit episodic at times, but each event contributes to our understanding of the characters and their stories. Some of these are low key and gentle; others are not. And I haven't even touched on some of the characters, such as the frightening Huntsman, played by Rutger Hauer, or others, all played well and convincingly.

There is plenty of humor in this movie (I especially love how the troll siblings take to the Bee Gees!), but not all fairy tales are free of blood, and this one has some truly chilling moments in it. Because of that, and because of the major story line that I am not revealing, this might not be suitable for smallish children who are easily scared. Otherwise, it is an excellent movie.",1214179200,3,3003,4.439201451905626

1081713,1,6305818282,"Wow. No, seriously. Wow. The 10th Kingdom clocks in at just under seven hours and I only made it thirty-nine minutes before I resigned myself to the fact that I could by no means in good conscience finish the movie.

Allow me to put it plainly: The 10th Kingdom is the worst thing I've seen in memory. There may have been worse. I just can't remember anything as bad.

Some may think it unfair of me to judge a story of which I have only experienced 9.35% its entire product, but I can assure that the rest of the movie could be Citizen Kane and the still not redeem the horror foisted upon viewers in the first hour.

Where do the problems lie? Chiefly in the acting. Or over-acting. Painful over-acting. The only thing inoffensive to me was Kimberly Williams - though I suspect I may be here influenced by the childhood crush I fostered from her work in Father of the Bride. The story I had no such past affection for and I was thence unable to overlook its stench. Even the musical cues were overwrought and painful.

Still, I imagine that ten-year-olds might get a kick out of the show and think the writing witty and urbane. Take that for what it's worth.

P.S. Since originally penning my review, I have been subjected to the rest of the movie (as my wife had to watch it at the bequest of her sixth-grade students). Dreadful, dreadful stuff. Those first thirty-nine minutes were perfectly indicative of the grave horror we were to play victim to over the following nights.",1212969600,2,1479,4.483271375464684

This is an excellent movie to watch if you loved the fairy tales as a child.  I rate this up there with The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter.  I am a 35-year old woman and I never tire of watching a good fairy tale.

While this is about fairy tales, some of the parts might not be good for children to watch (it may scare small children).  This has all aspects that a good movie needs, i.e. adventure, romance, slight scares, mysteries, etc.

And yes it does have some violence yet Hallmark seemed to trust the directors (and screenwriter's) ability to keep a balance for the younger crowds.

The humorous Larroquette, Troll Kids, Bee Gee's 'Night Fever', mushroom island's comedic shrooms and especially Scott Cohen's Wolf character were some of the many, many highlights.

Then there is the romantic aspect which after seeing a singing ring's rhyming chimes for the first time was the tip of the melting snow cone of Kissing Town's charm.

We loved the weaving of the fantastical fairy taie worlds of which we grew up reading as children) with the everyday life of a couple of middle class New Yorkers trying to eck out a living, thinking 'this is all there is' in life, and then adding to the mix the element of powerful emotional release and family matters, well, this is actually a movie for the not-so-faint-of-heart because it will deeply touch your heart.

The evil queen (done beautifully by Dianne Wiest) touched our hearts deeply with her own tragic story.  We're not used to seeing Wiest in this type of role so it was a great pleasure seeing her step up to the plate and pull off a very convincing character.  Usually she has a squinty-eyed soft/vulnerability but this time it was wide-eyed and powerful (even if it was evil), and was thrilling to witness.

Cohen's Wolf stole the show completely and it was as if he slipped into the role so seamlessly that the role appeared effortless and second-nature; not knowing the person, we feel he did a heck of a job fleshing (or furring) out this complex character.

The magic of this movie continues to sit with us as many of the classic character's lines and quips pop up in our daily life.  Truly an enchanting fairy tale.  Yes it was long, and we loved every single second.  Well done!

A word of caution to parents of children under 10:  View this first then you decide, you know your kids and what they can handle, what is violent to them, what is prudent and what is considered to be an adult theme; you have the power to use your own discretion, so use it here.

The most important thing to consider is that the fairy tale stories we all grew up with held the very same elements this epic tale presents: the violence, adult themes of morality and responsibility, etc. are all there to teach lessons, and help guide and direct, showing consequence for every action.  This is exactly what the original fairy tales did.  Hats off to those that wrote, directed and produced this project and who chose not to shy away from or water down the power that these tales present in real life.

Mostly, enjoy this adventurous fairy tale romp of fun, excitement, romance and ultimately happy (surprising) endings!

I think a lot of it was directed toward the late '60s, early '70s hippie types so some may not appreciate the humor in many of the scenes. One that comes to mind is John Larroquette and Kimberly Williams walking through the woods with the weird magic mushrooms and begin hearing the Procol Harum tune ""A Whiter Shade of Pale.""

One character I love in particular in this is the neurotic Wolf. Wolf is a half-wolf (werewolf) and apparently a descendant of The Big Bad Wolf. Wolf becomes the love interest in the story.

There are some amazing acting talents in this mini-series including Diane Weist in her very first villain role. It's shocking to see her out of the sugary sweet motherly role we're used to such as her role as Peg in Edward Scissorhands and the mother role in Lost Boys.

Another thing I like is the beautiful yet full figured woman who played Snow White- the actress from the practice. The writers paid close attention to detail in remembering that the original Snow White story's protagonist was fair and plump and they didn't follow the modern trend of the sickly-thin conception of beauty.

The fairy tales return to their roots with this mature- yet decent enough for people of all ages- fantasy. It's simply beautiful.",1186704000,,1463,4.7936507936507935

It is inventive and enjoyable. I have watched bits and pieces since the first time I watched the entire thing at once.  Everytime I watch, I see something I didn't see before.

Scott Cohen as ""Wolf"" is totally amazing.  He is the perfect lead male in a twisted fairytale. He is charming, sexy, daring, and yet flawed in a number of ways.  John Larroquette is great as ""Tony"" and he has the comic timing down pat.  Kimberly Williams holds it all together while being brave and vulnerable all at once.

The only truly great character here is Wolf (Scott Cohen), but you just can't help but root for Kimberly Williams and John Larroquette's characters as they trod through this crazy world as one absurd thing after another befalls them.  I thought it was clever how they introduced so many fairy stories into one big plot.

The middle of the story is the best part when the trolls aren't around, but knowing that the story is supposed to be a little silly and even makes fun of itself from time to time, usually through the eyes of John Larroquette's character, it's all just a fun 7 hours.

1081932,4,6305818282,"Having seen and enjoyed The 10th Kingdom at the age of twelve, when it first aired on television, I decided recently to reconnect with it, although I was unsure of how my perspective would change after seven years.  Although flawed, the movie's oddball personality has kept it largely fresh and entertaining.

The movie concerns Virginia, a waitress living in New York with her dead-beat dad Tony--until some magical intrusions into their normal lives thrust the two of them through a magic mirror and into the fairy tale universe of the Nine Kingdoms.

Despite its considerable length, the movie runs at a fairly brisk pace, especially once it hits its stride around the two hour mark.  And although lots of things happen during the course of seven and a half hours, the story isn't too difficult to follow.  Admittedly, the plot often serves simply as an excuse to drag the main characters from location to location.  But even though the movie could possibly do with a trim, the settings are so interesting and so eccentric that I didn't actually mind.  In fact, the movie works best when it allows itself to explore the quirks of the fantasy world and to plumb the comedy that arises from the clash of fairy tale tradition with modern sensibility.  A favorite is an update on the Big Bad Wolf archetype, a half-man, half-wolf played out by Scott Cohen as an addled, desperate-to-reform schizophrenic, who takes an interest in Virginia.  Imagine a cross between the Grimms' granny-eating glutton and Tex Avery's extravagant, wolf-whistling rake, and then throw him (literally) onto a therapist's couch.  Also, Tony's response to the old riddle of the two doors and their guardian who ""always lies"" makes for what is probably the most hilarious moment in the whole movie.

However, as good as it can be, the movie also contains some truly cringe-worthy moments.  Daniel Lapaine, as a dog who has switched bodies with a prince, doesn't get much to do apart from pant and bark.  The plot does take some time to get past all the set-up and exposition, and can also get bogged down in trying to bind together the various threads of quest, romance, and political intrigue.  Not to give anything away, I found the last chapter to be particularly unconvincing.

For those with complaints about the darker and more adult overtones of the movie, it might be worth remembering the frequently dark nature of the original fairy tales from which the movie is drawn (these fairy tales are called ""Grimm"" for more than one reason, after all).  I would consider this movie suitable for most children over the age of nine or ten.  Most of the innuendo (some sexual, plus a couple of slantwise drug references) would go right over a child's head, and the more disturbing scenes of violence occur off-screen.

To cut straight to the point, this is an enjoyable movie--strange, silly, and great for anybody interested in experiencing the old fairy tales in a new way.",1180137600,5,2948,4.850299401197605

1081934,5,6305818282,"I won't go into a long drawn out description of the movie, but I will say this movie has been a lifesaver!

For any woman who is stuck cleaning her house, this is the movie for you.  Picking up my husband's socks from the coffee table and trying to free Polly Pocket's shoes from my carpet has been the most miserable part of my existence for three years.  Truly, it gets me down, because this is a process that repeats itself daily.  This movie not only gives me the romance and adventure that this daunting task requires to keep me going, it is inspiring.

I have read complaints that the movie is too long.  Clearly, these people have never tried doing an overhaul on their house to this movie.  The length is perfect, and DVD chapters insure I can take it from room to room, not missing or rewatching.  If you get blue from cleaning, I urge you to buy this movie.  You will thank me!  This is the best cleaning tool I have found since I discovered the Magic Eraser.

My only complaint is the ending leaves us hanging.  It was written so that a sequel could be made, but low viewers in 1999 prevented this from coming to fruition. Several attempts are being made by avid fans to change the minds of RHI Entertainment (they recently purchased Hallmark Entertainment), and a sequel would be much appreciated.  I won't hold my breath though.

In conclusion, the unrewarding and unappreciated task of picking up after a messy family no longer bothers me...at least it won't after I order my DVD now.

1081986,5,6305818282,"When I first saw this one as a teenager, I thought it was really lame. But, man oh man, has it grown on me. It's actually quite daring in the fact that it doesn't shy away from the violent brutality and sometimes-grotesque sexuality of fairy tales, that is, the fact that fairy tales were written for adults. In a very Jungian and Campbell like way, the miniseries reminds us that fairy tales were once culture's way of dealing with human psychology and behavior, and even helping us to grow. Here is the true human drama of the fairy tale. Virginia, our heroine, is an amalgum of Cinderella, Red-Ridding Hood, and Snow White, and yet is distinctly modern. She doesn't have faith in herself to do great things, nor is she trusting enough to fall in love (particularly with an animal-like creature, our ambiguous Prince Charming/Big Bad Wolf). My favorite character of all is the delicious Wolf (played amazingly by Scott Cohen).  He absolutely embodies the folk tale male (the male version of the witch, the werewolf)--the animal, id creature, the trickster, the creature of appetite. He's a perfect blending of both the sexual appetite and the food appetite (""I don't know if I want to marry her or eat her.""). That's the Big Bad Wolf of the Red Ridding Hood tale. Most of all, I love that he goes through PMS, which is ironic for a character of animal masculinity (a juxtaposition of the female forces of the civilization as presented in the shepardesses). It is so refreshing to see a film that really understands the complexities of folk and fairy tales, but to do it in--well, frankly--just a very *fun* way. Not only is this film very well-written, but the acting and special effects and scenery all are wonderful. I love this miniseries.

1082024,5,6305818282,"Years and years after this came on tv, I am still in love with this movie.  This is what mini-series are meant to be. Heck, this is what good story-telling is meant to be, I don't care about the medium.  Sure, it's lengthy, but if you are a simpleton with a short attention span it is your own problem.  Length is what this story needed to make its full impact. If they had needed more time, by all means, I would have not complained.

This is a show made for the people who love fairy tales (not that the layman wouldn't fall in love with the 9 Kingdoms).  There are jokes and allusions that go surprising beyond your basic Cinderella and Snow White.  I have laughed at the various intricacies that too-well show the nature of fairy tales.

The plot is based on fairy tales. Without fairy tales, this movie would not exist, along with so much of our modern culture. What so many people fail to realize is how imbedded into soceity fairy tale and their eternal themes are.  The story itself is a fairy tale, the tale of a servant girl (actually, she's a waitress in Central Park, but close enough) who goes on a journey to a magical world in the attendance of several quirky companions, meets various adventure, and ultimately becomes something more than a ""just a waitress"".  It's a classic fairy tale plot, and it is one that will never die.  It is a story that is timeless.  Not only is the story a fairy tale itself, it's gosh-darn chuck-full of fairy tales, albeit a wild and thoroughly entertaining blend.

The 10th kingdom is actually our world, but the other nine exist in a parallel world oddly similar to Europe (the source of many well-known tales and certainly those brought screaming and kicking into the show).  This is the world where fairy tales are real and a part of life.  Most attention is on the 4th kingdom, but the DVD happily provides intricate information on the others until quite the little culture is developed.

At first glance, it seems that the fairy tales are wickedly mocked, but closer insight shows a touching respect for all of them. So what is wrong with having a little fun?

The main fairy tale is that of Snow White. A major character, Prince Wendell, is the grandson of Snow White.  The woman herself is shown, in an incredible theme that goes beyond the traditional, weakened, damsel-in-distress Snow White.  It's truly powerful and heart-felt what this plot line shows.

Beyond the story, there lies the characters.  Wow.  How can you not fall in love with this ragged, weird, and terribly quirky band of characters?  Characters drive this plot with every odd personality flaw available to them.  Their complexity is certainly admirable.  The best part is how 2-dimensional they originally seemed.  Just a bunch of fun goofballs. But as the show progresses, more and more is revealed about each of them until they are entirely human (or wolf, or whatever).  The perfect actors were chosen for each character, and I cannot imagine anyone but them playing their parts.  Applause to all of them for an incredible thespian job!

The DVD itself is also very respectable. I mentioned the info on the other kingdoms.  There is also character and actor information.  The making of- feature was delightful, and heck, even the menus rock.

Sometimes the movie seems too long, but it's the kind of movie you never want to turn off because every scene it's something new. One of the best magical journey movies I ever watched. I really love the message it's trying to say too. I really love the acting, which started out kind of choppy, but gotten a lot better during the movie. I'm also very drawn to Wolf, I guess like ever girl out there is. Hehe. This is a great family movie, but I probably wouldn't let really young kids watch it.

1082077,5,6305818282,"Until the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy this movie was the most complex fantasy ever attempted. In some ways the story rambles, but the intricate elements are woven together so coherently that they fit smoothly into the quest undertaken by the principal characters.

Virginia and Tony Lewis (Kimberly Williams and John Larroquette) live in a New York apartment. One day a dog enters Virginia's life. However, the dog is not just any ordinary dog, but is Prince Wendell (Daniel Lapaine) changed into a dog by an evil Queen (Dianne Wiest). Soon trolls appear along with magic, and the story begins.

Virginia and Tony travel through a magic mirror into the land of the nine kingdoms (with New York being the 10th kingdom). It takes Virginia and Tony little time to realize that the world they have entered has very different rules from their own. Their goal is to find a mirror that will allow them to travel back to their own world, and the quest for the mirror forms the heart of this story.

During their quest for the mirror, both Virginia and Tony, but most especially Virginia, are on a voyage of discovery about themselves. Through a series of vignettes they learn the history of the nine kingdoms, and learn there are mysteries related to that history. One of the most startling revelations is that Virginia and Tony are somehow involved in the nine kingdoms, but it is not until we get well into the movie that we understand the nature of their involvement.

The plot is generally coherent and I had little trouble keeping track of the parallel stories. I admit that there were a few things that confused me when I watched the story in its original television debut, but my confusion was cleared up by watching the DVD version without the commercials and all in one 7+ hour sitting.

The acting talent in this movie is phenomenal. Rutger Hauer plays the Queen's woodsman, with his own poignant story. Warwick Davis is Acorn, a criminal with a tongue-in-cheek character. Ed O'Neil is perfect as Relish the Troll King. Scott Cohen as Wolf took a little getting used to, but once I realized how he fit into the story I enjoyed his antics and characterization. Camryn Manheim makes an interesting Snow White. Ann-Margret brings class to Queen Cinderella. This list is but a fraction of the cast possible by the epic nature of this movie.

The story is an adult fairy tale. There is violence in the movie as well as a number of intense scenes that are likely inappropriate for children below the age of 7 or 8. However, for everyone else this movie is fun and complicated. If you enjoy fantasy, and you can be open-minded about a unique approach to fantasy, this movie could be perfect for you.",1155081600,2,2694,4.6849894291754755

1082081,5,6305818282,"I first watched this when it was on NBC.  Bought the VHS version immediately and now that it's out on DVD, I had to get that.

The plot is basically this:  It seems that the land of fairy tales is real.  Those make up the 9 kingdoms.  Our world is the 10th kingdom.  Prince Wendell is about to be crowned king, but to prevent that, the evil queen/witch exchanges his body with that of her dog.  The dog jumps through a mirror and lands in central park.  He finds Virginia who takes him home.  Turns out that he can communicate with her father.  Anyway Prince Wendell takes them back through the mirror.  The rest of the story is about their adventures along the way to saving the prince before he turns permanantly into a dog.

This is a PG13.  There are a lot of adult themes.  My college-age kids & 16-year old LOVE it and watch it frequently.  It has staying power.  The story is complex and interesting.  It reminds me a LOT of the light-hearted nature of the Princess Bride - which is not a kids story, either.

I wonder what ever happened to the ""part 2"" - which was hinted at at the very end of the movie (""but that is another story""), but has never materialized.

1082106,5,6305818282,"Whats better than a fairy tale?  How's about a whole slew of fairy tales intertwined together.  That is what this movie is about.  A single father and his daughter fall into a world of fairy tales (primary Disney ones) and go on an adventure of a lifetime.

There they encounter a man wolf, singing fish, trolls, magic mirrors, and a whole slew of other characters from famous fairy tales in western literature.  They get caught up in a power struggle between a niave king whose been turned into a dog, and an evil witch, which turns out to be her mother.

1082137,4,6305818282,"The 10th Kingdom, so the summaries say, is a mini-series (now out on DVD) about a girl, Virginia, living in New York with her hapless janitor father, who passes through a magic mirror in Central Park and lands in the land of fairy tales, the Nine Kingdoms ruled by descendants of Snow White, Cinderella, and the like, and populated by lascivious wolves, trolls, swamp witches, and fairies.  A wicked witch escapes from prison and enchants Prince Wendell of the 4th Kingdom, putting his spirit into the body of a golden retriever, and the poor retriever's spirit into the body of Wendell.  Virginia, her dad, and Wolf (who has a thing for Virginia as though she were Red Riding Hood), must overcome the Witch and return Wendell to the throne.

Since this series seemed a nice blend of adventure and fairy-story, I thought it would be a good family choice, but I was mistaken on two fronts.  First, the screenwriters seem genuinely confused about their audience - much of 10th Kingdom is way to goofy-silly for adults, and a truly surprising amount of it is quite INappropriate for kids.  For example, when Dad and Virginia get lost in the swamp witch's swamp, they eat some magic mushrooms, hallucinate, and think they are hearing Procol Harum's song ""Whiter Shade of Pale.""  I guess someone thought that would be a kind of hip cultural reference, but it was too goofy for this adult, and the hallucinogenic mushrooms took it out of the realm of children.

But wait - it gets worse!  Turns out that the Wicked Witch was actually Virginia's MOTHER before she abandoned the family when Virginia was only 7.  Turns out (as the Dad says), ""I loved her so I married her even though she was sleeping around.""  Some fairy-tale marriage, eh? Turns out the big love scene between Virginia and the Wolf consist of him chasing her through the forest, felling her like prey, jumping her bones, and impregnating her with a little wolf (thus convincing her at last to marry him).  Worst of all, turns out the wicked witchmother left because she had tried to drown Virginia in the bathtub, a scene which actually appears on screen.  It's hard to imagine the child who wouldn't be a bit traumatized by this.  I can only assume that the screenwriter(s) had read Bettelheim's famous book, ""The Uses of Enchantment,"" which psychoanalyzes fairytales and deconstructs them as stories about the tortured psychosexual relations between parents and children.

Virginia made for a pretty good heroine having to come to terms with a past that she can't wuite recall.

Tony makes great strides to overcome his selfishness and cowardace, and becomes a lovable and strong character.

Wolf was by far my favorite. Aside from being completely hot, he's so wonderfully sweet when he's not trying to eat everyone. As a half wolf, struggling to stay on the side of humanity, wonderful performance by Scott Cohen. He's probably one of the most complex characters of any film. He goes back and forth between trying to help Virginia return to NY and trying to keep her in the 9 kingdoms with him. Some of his choices aren't always the best and it gets him in trouble, but he's trying.

This movie is more geared towards teens and young adults, a lot of the content (violence, some of Wolf's behavior) isn't appropriate for young kids, and some of the older scene might not appreciate the slightly random/fantasy aspect of the movie.

Watch this movie. Split it up if you have to, but all at once is much more enjoyable. Make a day (or a night) of it. We just had a party and watched all seven hours in a row. It might have been four in the morning when it was over, but it was sooooo worth it.",1138406400,3,1400,4.287878787878788

I often wish they'd scale some of these up for an adult audience, and this is something of an attempt to do that while still straddling a well under PG minor.

An army friend of mine got hooked on this as easily as the girls do, so there's enough of Kim William's pretty eyes to keep the boys watching... Though there's not much more in the way of anything sexy.

the Trolls are hilariously good - the wolf is best when wolfish - when he's in love.. well... the girls will dig it.",1138406400,,626,4.1652892561983474
1082191,3,6305818282,"I have to say that after reading the Amazon review and the first review listed here, then buying this based on the high rating overall from so many reviewers, I was expecting much better.  This movie is silly, but I have an open mind and was willing to watch despite this totally different 'feel' than I expected.  It doesn't take itself very seriously, and it knows it's silly.  I am a huge fan of fairy tales and complex plots, so the reference in the first review here that mentioned Lord of the Rings sold me.  But this plot is so simply my four year old could follow, yet this movie is not for children.  And adult fairy tale is what I wanted, but this one was a bit too silly.  I did laugh, and I myself liked the sexual innuendoes.  But the silliness was a bit much.  Each night I watched, my husband would give it a half hour before he gave up, rolling his eyes, and went to bed to read.  And the special effects were cheesy for the most part, but this didn't bother me.

The story was about the young (maybe early twenties) Virginia and her father being transported by a magical mirror into a fairy tale dimension.  And the movie is about their many adventures during their quest to find the mirror to transport them back to Manhattan, which happens to be the 10th Kingdom.  They are accompanied in their quest, for most but not all of the way, by Wolf (a man who is really a werewolf and has a huge crush on Virginia) and and also by the prince who has been changed into a dog by the evil queen.  Some of their adventures are quite entertaining and have humorous moments.

My favorite character by far was Wolf.  I found his quirkiness funny and cute and the man himself was very hot.  I have to say if the actor who played Wolf wasn't so good-looking, I might not have kept up watching this very lengthy movie so diligently.  I guess there was no actress hot enough to keep my husband watching.

My biggest complaint is the very end.  After watching such a very long movie, especially a fairy tale, I expect a complete happy ending.  Even Lord of the Rings, a much more complex and dramatic film (that truly shouldn't be compaired to this fluffy miniseries anyway), completed their trilogy with a happy ending.  Well, The 10th Kingdom gives us a happy ending, then tears it down with the last line (trust me, this won't ruin the movie for you, but may help take some of the disappointment away when you hear it after sooo many hours of viewing): ""I'd like to tell you we lived happily ever after, but we didn't for long because of more trouble in the Kingdoms soon to happen.  But live life and be complete, even if it's not a long life.  This was just my story and the first book in The 10 Kingdoms""  Huh??  After all these hours of watching, THIS is what I get??  After I was happy with the ending (although, I was already a bit disappointed in the direction it took at the very very ending), the voiceover throws in these lines to ruin it?  This is not an exact quote of the voiceover, but is close enough.  Well, after all that watching, I want a complete story without some voiceover coming in to ruin it by saying things don't last happy for long and there will be a sequel (which I'm confident there will never be).

Despite these problems, it was an entertaining watch if you have time on your hands.  I am continuously disappointed with movies I rent, so purchasing this one for $10 with plenty of hours is a good buy.  I don't regret watching this silly fun miniseries, I just have to pretend I didn't see the last minute of it.  And I definitely enjoyed watching Wolf.

At about 7 hours long, it's a great way to lull away a free day (like any of us has those just laying around).  Be sure to watch it at least once.  I'd recommend it for kids 12 and up.

But, being an avid reader since childhood of fairy tales and myths and the strangest stories I could find, I knew I was going to watch the movie.

And I did. Every night.

It was an unexpected mixture of modern and medieval, fun and dead seriousness, outright silliness and intelligent humor. As a writer, I appreciated the intricacy of the plot, of what was required to blend all those familiar fairy tales into this new and magical story.

Although most of the humor is aimed directly at the adult viewer - and, let's face it, this is the grownup version of the Brothers Grimm - children will find much to enjoy, too, such as the dog whose really a prince, or the three troll siblings who fall in love with a boombox.

For those who think it's too silly, learn to laugh! And for those who think it's too juvenile, there are profound themes that will resonate in the mind long after the credits have rolled.

I highly recommend this movie.",1123632000,4,1071,4.523316062176166

1082282,5,6305818282,"From the first haunting notes of the movie's visually stunning opening sequence to the final words of Virginia Lewis, this epic tale glues you to the couch through 7 hours of cinematic magic.

John Laroquette (Tony), Kimberly Williams (Virgina), and Scott Cohen (Wolf) lead an all-star cast though a Faerie Tale world of murder, revenge, and romance.

Janitor Tony Lewis and his daughter Virgina live on the edge of Central Park.  One evening, on Virginia's bike ride to work, a golden retriever (Daniel Lapaine) runs out in front of her, thrusting Virgina and her father into the middle of an Evil Queen's (Dianne Weist) quest to reclaim the throne. On the way, you'll meet three bumbling trolls and their Warrior King father (Ed O'Neill), a prince who is really a dog and a dog who is really a prince, a roving band of gypsies, a meadow of magic mushrooms, Snow White (Cameron Manheim), Cinderella (Ann-Margaret), the Huntsman (Rutdger Hauer), Kissing Town where everyone falls in love, and much, much, more.

As with all Hallmark movies, the visual effects are mesmorizing, the plot is full of twists and turns (most predictable, but still very enjoyable), and the project a bit over ambitious (as the best are).  Seven hours is a LONG time to sit and watch a movie, and this one does drag about 2/3 of the way through disk one.  However, once you get past this and into disk two, it's one Not-Happily-Ever-After plot twist after another.

Parents should note that though this was made for TV, there are still some scenes that maybe disturbing to children.  Virginia's mother abandoned her as a child, and Virginia must deal with some startling memories of her mother.  An entire family is presumably killed off screen, and there is a non-explicit sex scene between an unmarried couple.  All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone with a little bit of time.  Cancel all your appointments, and keep the popcorn handy as you settle in for an All-Day family event.  The 10th Kingdom is an adventure waiting for you to hit play.",1110672000,5,2035,4.782857142857143
1082283,5,6305818282,"I thought the movie was very good & a different take on the fairy tale formula. It was slow in the begining but once it got going it got going. I did like that they did show the other side to fairy tales & what couldve happened after the ""Happily Ever After"", the original grimm fairy tales were very violent and served as a warning for children, so they did keep a darker side instead of ignoring it. The Trolls were annoying after a while with there 3 stooges slapstick. Some complain about the contemporary themes but then again, they story is about two people from Now going into a ""Fairy Kingdom"" so u expect some modern themes to come thru.

I watched this DVD with my niece and nephew and they love it...they like the fact that it is modern and isn't a boring fairy tale to them, its holds there very short attention spans and not too many movies can do that. I liked it, enjoyed it and its a good way to escape on a rainy/snowy day.",1109289600,,940,4.222222222222222
1082295,1,6305818282,"Warning: This movie is definitely not appropriate for children! As an adult fantasy/sci-fi buff, I'm at a loss to what anyone else would like about this disturbing film.

I can simply sum up my feelings by one pivotal scene where a single man commits a brutal act of mass murder to three generations of an entire family. Here we are graphically shown the  murder by magical bow & arrow of every man, women and child totaling over a dozen people. What warranted their death sentence? The crime of poaching! Who were these people? A caravan of Rom, better known as Gypsies. Forget the racist stereotypes of an ethnic group that was targeted for elimination during WW 2, for a moment. Here's a group of people whose only crime is trying to survive in a rather hostile environment. Sure their ethics are far from perfect. But did we need to view an act of mass murder to make a point? Seeing an entire family, including a child, brutally murdered is not my idea of a good time!

To add insult to injury, this mass murderer is also a kidnapper and it doesn't take much imagination to conclude, a rapist to boot!

I'm very disappointed Hallmark would lend its name to such rotten trash! What does this teach our children? I guess it's a clear reflection of the sheer ugliness that exists at the heart of American society!

1082296,5,6305818282,"I remember being so excited to see The Tenth Kingdom when in first premiered in 2002. I've always been partial to fantasy, fairy tales and adventure and when I saw the previews The Tenth Kingdom appeared to be all of that. I would sit glued to the television for two hours every night that it was on. It is a wonderful story that pulls you in and can entertain for hours and is great even on repeated viewings. Don't be put off by the length, time will fly by and it presents the opportunity to go into a characters background, subplots and misadventures. The people that populate the Nine Kingdoms are some offer some of the best parts of the movie.

John Larroquette is hilarious but offers touching (for lack of a better word) acting near the end. Kimberly Williams is convincing as the emotionally hurt but resillient main character. Scott Cohen is everybody's favorite character as the lovable Wolf. All of the characters are complex and three dimensional, even the evil Queen isn't black and white.

I have not seen many children's movies that could also pass as an adult adventure. Many movies that claim to be for everyone in the family offer not-so-subtle innuendo and graphic situations or language. But this truly is for everyone. I've watched it with my younger siblings many times and then had my own friends come together to watch it. We all love it. If you love fantasy, you'll love this. If you don't you probably still will love it as there's plenty for everyone. ""Suck an elf"" has made it's way into the venacular of our world.

Minor 'gripes' (heh). The trolls. Their goofy physical comedy isn't so funny. They get annoying at times but it's nothing big.

The effects are cool, kind of. This IS a TV movie so it's not like I was expecting The Matrix of mini-series but they tend to look a little weird some times.

The DVD quality is great, with about the amount and quality of special features that you'd expect for a made-for-TV movie. Nothing to write home about but this is a huge step up from the taped VHS version I had. I caught it the second time around when they trimmed about two hours out of it and I had forgotten about some of the parts. It was good to discover them again.

Don't expect ""High Art"" as one reviewer put it. This isn't a masterpiece of film and/or television and it wasn't meant to be. This is meant to be fun  and entertaining and it acheives those goals wonderfully.",1108166400,10,2415,4.5125858123569795

Virginia (Kimberly Williams) and her father Tony (John Larroquette) are a simple pair, living in a shabby apartment building in which Tony is the primary, and only, janitor/maintenance bub. Years prior, Virginia's mother went missing and her father still will not discuss the specifics of the night she dissapeared.

However, time has passed and both have, at least apparently, moved on. The story truly begins when Virginia meets up with Prince Wendell. In dog form. In Central Park. After a whirlwind of activities, it is established that the dog is Prince Wendell. Prince Wendell is the soon-to-be crowned King of the 4th Kingdom. The 4th Kingdom is another dimension in which Fantasy is reality and reality is what you make of it.

The story progresses with the trio accidentally ending up in the 4th Kingdom, Wendel trying to reestablish his throne, and the father-daughter pair attempting to make it back home. With the help of a two-faced wolf-man (Scott Cohen) --who, with the help of Dr. Phil type self help books, finds the man within the wolf within the man, and ends up falling in love with our heroine-- the group resolves mysteries, learns histories, and solves fairy tale stories.

1082300,2,6305818282,"The 10th Kingdom is a very unique and interesting idea and gives a unique approach to the fairy tales of our childhood. Unfortunately, the slow-paced plot, terrible acting, and over-the-top directing doom this miniseries. Too many opportunities to explore the stories of Grimm brothers are passed up so the viewer can instead listen to the four main characters whine and complain about each other and their lot in life, not that you'll blame them since you can hardly stand them yourself.

  Kimberly Williams, (Father of the Bride, Life According to Jim) as Virginia, is the only bright spot of this ten-hour bore. Her spunky pluck and charisma carry the movie through the by-the-numbers plot and plodding dialogue. Virginia's father, Tony, played by John Larroquette (The John Larroquette Show) is a pathetic, money-loving, dolt of a father who is constantly looking for short cuts through life. The audience knows how and why his plans are going to fail long before they do. Joining them is Prince Wendell, but wait! Prince Wendell is a dog voiced by Daniel Lapaine (Brokedown Palace, Helen of Troy) who also plays as a dog masquerading as the prince. Neither performance is adequate even though the prince is the merely the formulaic, soon-to-be-king, spoiled brat figure. But the worst of the worst is Scott Cohen (Private Parts) as Wolf. He is a were-wolf type character who is so over-the-top annoying that the viewers are left cringing whenever he dominates a scene, which he gets to do a lot since he's either talking to himself alone or trying to win Virginia's heart by waxing poetically, or so he thinks. These monologues, I think, exist to provide conflict and create suspense, or maybe they are the comic relief. They do neither, which is why you've probably never heard of Scott Cohen since.

The villains, the Evil Queen (that's what they call her!), her huntsman and Acorn the dwarf are all played capably enough by Dianne West, Rutger Hauer, and Warwick Davis respectively. Only the huntsman really succeeds though as a villain worth fearing and is the only complex character of the movie as even in the end you hold out hope for his redemption. Ed O'Neill (Married With Children) as the Troll King, Relish, is merely Al Bundy with a violent streak put in and any sense of humor removed.

The sets are pretty good, creative and unique, and each setting does a good job of adding some depth to story but in the end the fairy tales, which are only alluded to vaguely in the main story-line, are always keep tantalizingly out of sight and reach or the viewer. What could have been a great story is reduced to a drawn out tale of angst with four underdogs trying to stop the stereotypical evil queen from ruling the magical land you don't get to see enough of. The first two hours take place mainly in New York City for heaven sakes! In the end most viewers will be left wondering why it took ten hours to tell this tale when it probably could have been done in a little over three. Best unintentional comedy? The open ending that shows that the producers wanted to make a sequel! Oh the horror!",1106870400,7,3109,4.728782287822878

I personally do not think that this movie is appropriate for any age, because it has stuff like magic and goblins etc. that little kids would like more, but theres something rather sexual about this movie, and sometimes they say some things that gave me friends and i a pretty good laugh, but considering we have a very perverted sense of humour, i do not think that is a good thing.",1106352000,2,498,4.423913043478261
1082303,4,6305818282,"Here is an intriguing concept.  What would happen if you took all of the major fairy tales (Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Jack and the Beanstalk, Peter Pan, etc), threw in an archaic fable (King Midas), added fables of Wishing Wells and Valentines Day, sprinkled in a little bit of The Lord of The Rings and then put them all in a blender?  Well, the present film answers that question.  You would end up in a fairy-tale world where everything is mystical and magic is as common as springtime rain.

The story will take some patience on the part of the viewer as it is very drawn out.  The pacing of it is pretty decent for the most part, however.  One of the most interesting facets is how it takes the viewer through many enchanted realms that represent different fairy tales.  The motifs of all the various fairy tales are almost certain to be depicted at some point along the way.

The acting of the film is of a high calibre.  Rutger Haur is a perfect fit as the huntsman while Scott Cohen delivers a considerable performance as a half-wolf.  However, the primary reason to pick up this DVD is Kimberly Williams.  In a word, she is simply adorable as a cross between the girl-next-door and a fairy tale princess.  I've seen her in a few other films and have always been impressed with her charming screen presence.

For a HALLMARK movie, the film has a surprising amount of sexual innuendo.  Most of it will not be picked up by children, but it was nonetheless a bit unexpected.  Of course, in a way it is fitting for the film to have it as so many fairy tales deal with sexual coming-of-age (Snow White especially).

So, if you still have some kid left in you (and I do hope that is the case!) this DVD will be an elegant addition to your collection.  Just be sure and get it before the clock strikes midnight!",1104624000,9,1827,4.438438438438438

It's about a young waitress who never thinks that anything interesting will ever happen in her life...little did she know that her life was about to change as she knew it.  She enters a magical fairy tale world, and she must learn to adapt to it because she and her father are stuck there until they can figure out a way to get home again.  Along the way they meet a friendly half wolf half human friend, lovingly named Wolf.

I have watched this many, many times.  The story is excellent, the action is great, holds you on the edge of your seat, and the acting is just brilliant.  This is one of Scott Cohen's first big acting jobs, but you can't tell!  He plays the part of Wolf and is just wonderful.  This is what got his career kicked up, and you can see why!

I loved the characters in this movie, they were all just so great.  And the relationship between Wolf and Virginia is just excellently put together!

It was made as a mini-series, and because of this fact, I thought that the movie quality, the acting, and all in all the entire film would be poor...but boy was I wrong!  I fell in love with it the first time I ever saw it, and have even become a bit obsessed with it!

I must admit, though, that the first few minutes of the film are kind of slow.  It doesn't start to get really good until around the time that the character ""Wolf"" is introduced.  But, the rest of the movie completely makes up for this slower beginning.

1082329,5,6305818282,"I am a huge fan of The 10th Kingdom, and am writing mainly to address the following points raised by a previous reviewer:

***WARNING -- THERE MAY BE SOME MINOR SPOILERS -- nothing earth-shattering, but if you like to watch with absolutely NO knowledge, then skip this review. ***

1. ""...the writers couldn't decide if they were going to do a fantasy or a fairy tale.""  The whole show hinged around a juxtaposition of different genres, time periods and stories.  That was the point, and what made for so many unexpected and clever twists.  Anyway, perhaps I'm not aware of the differences between fantasy and fairy tale, but I don't particularly care!  (Oh, and by the way, you forgot to mention nursery rhymes -- the Peeps reference!)

2.  ""I feel the character of the Huntsman was completely unneeded as the trolls were already doing pretty much the same thing.""  This I take huge issue with.  The Huntsman provided a much-needed element of darkness in the actual pursuit of (and threat towards) the main characters (especially the physical pursuit, since the Queen was in the background most of the time).  The Trolls are bumbling comic relief (and not my favorite characters, by the way), but the Huntsman was the real threat (an unredeemed version of the huntsman in the Snow White story).  His relentless evil presence overshadowed all of the short-term threats to the main characters, and was absolutely essential.

3.  ""I also found both the Peep encounter & the Kissing Town rather unneccesary.""  Well, I'm not sure how, since they seemed essential to both advancing the plot and expanding the dimensions of the characters.  And, darn it, they were just plain fun!!

I do agree that not everything was perfect in terms of continuity and plot gaps, but it's a small price to pay for so many hours of outstanding entertainment.  And, by the way, I bear no malice towards the reviewer (who gave the show 3 stars, after all), but I just HAD to address those points, in the interests of fairness and open debate.  :)

Thanks for reading!",1101945600,3,2042,4.78
1082330,3,6305818282,"Overall this can be entertaining and a nice way to spend several evenings despite a rather large number of plot gaps, continuity problems, and just plain bad scenes.

For one thing the writers couldn't seem to decide if they were going to do a fantasy or a fairy tale so we get quite a jumble of themes thrown together. And a lot of the costumes and sets did not really fit either a fantasy or a fairy tale.

I feel the character of the Huntsman was completely unneeded as the trolls were already doing pretty much the same thing. I also found both the Peep encounter & the Kissing Town rather unnecessary and felt they really slowed things down but this is more of an editing than a writing thing.

Despite the problems there a a lot of good, cute, or just plain funny scenes and characters. Most of the effects are done rather well also.

You'll more or less have to watch and decide for yourselves if you like it.

I must have a different idea of what 'family viewing' means as I found it to be in extremely bad taste in parts and to promote (even if subtle) not such great values.  It's a 'realistic' view of fairy tales and certainly tries to shatter the idea the girl marrying the prince and living happily ever after.  Sure that's not always realistic, but these are fairy tales and why try to change a good thing in my opinion.  I really thought a lot of this was nightmare material for some children (and possibly adults).  The characters seem to run from one horror to another and it felt like it would never end.  This may not be a popular review because so many people apparently liked it, but from a Christian perspective I found this movie to be quite disgusting.  I want to add that this is a Hallmark production, but not a Gold Crown Edition Hallmark video.  Believe me, there is a difference!",1100390400,12,1002,4.407608695652174
1082332,5,6305818282,"In a land called the ""Nine Kingdoms"" where the Grimm Fairy Tales of our childhood and history actually happened the great-great grandson of Snow White; Prince Wendell is in danger of loosing his kingdom to his stepmother, the ""Evil Queen"" through a rather elaborate and complex plot. When he accidentally ends up in New York City through a magic mirror he fell into while running from his Stepmother and through a rather complex set of events has to try and save his kingdom with Tony Lewis and his daughter, the heroine Virginia. With three rather bumbling royal troll siblings, children of the Troll King and a feisty half man half wolf (played by Scott Cohen), in pursuit of the Prince; who happens to fall in love with Virginia and is unsure of whether he wants to eat her or marry her.

A Hallmark movie that was supposed to be NBC and Hallmarks television miniseries blockbuster, opened up to rather dismal ratings in terms of what NBC was expecting. Despite the cult status the movie has achieved, the movie is considered a flop in regards to the amount of  money that was spent making it.  Over seven hours long and encompassing four DVD disks, the movie is an epic undertaking to watch but well worth it.  But these aren't the dumbed down Disney Fairy Tales versions that most children and adults are familiar with; but rather the original darker versions originally intended for Adults only.  Virginia and Tony soon learn that Happily Ever After, doesn't last as long as they imagined. Aside from visuals and a fascinating background and history of the ""Nine Kingdoms"", the best and most appealing part of The 10th Kingdom is perhaps the characters themselves.

Virginia and Tony are expertly played by Kimberly Williams Paisley and John Larroquette. Williams-Paisley has the right amount of cynicism and  humanity as Virginia. A young woman who still secretly bears the pain of loosing her Mother. While most will remember Larroquette as the sleazy and promiscuous Dan Fielding from the show ""Night Court"", Larroquette doesn't stretch too far in in terms of character development as Tony Lewis a rather pitiful, good hearted yet bumbling man who's past failures as a business man and single father. But what Larroquette, does as Tony and did as Dan, he does well and still manages to earn our sympathy and approval despite his sometimes less then honest motivations.  Scott Cohen plays Wolf, with relish and while he obviously seems to be enjoying his job. All other characters, The Evil Queen played by Diana Wiest, Ed O'Neil as Relish the Troll king and even Cameryn Maneheim as an aged Snow White make an appearance.

 As the movie goes on, the plots grow more intricate and darker as the characters and past histories all intertwine and some very dark disturbing subjects are perhaps brought to life but not dwelled upon as everything comes to a resolution. Without spoiling anything  a sequel is hinted at towards the very end of the Mini-Series and while it's creator Simon West expressed his desire and plans to continue on with the story it's unlikely this will happen. Despite that sad bit of news, the movie still deserves much more praise and attention then it gained when it first aired.

Later on, I recieved this present for my birthday and after watching it, I was quite glad. It might be 8 hours long but that just makes it better. It is the type of movie where after only seeing 2 hours you wish it didn't end, except with 10th kingdom it doesn't end until all 8 hours are over.

The story takes place in both a mythical world (known as the 9 kingdoms) and in the real world. A magical mirror in the 9 kingdoms allows passage between the two. The land of the 9 kingdoms is supposed to be the land where all the farie tales took place, though the story takes place, I believe, around 200 years later (and during modern times in the real world). The characters are well developed, the plot is interesting and the movie was well thought out. There are a couple places where it gets a little corny (especially with a dog that ends up getting trapped in a human body), but overall the movie is an excellent way to spend 8 hours of your time.

Who could endure this many interactions with children's storybook characters?  Luckily, my wife sat me down and we began this lengthy process.  To say the least, I was impressed.  Directors David Carson and Herbert Wise did a spectacular job of bringing the magic and detail of fairy tales to the small screen.  Through the voyages of our three main heroes, we see so many of our childhood escapes.  Places where only our imagination took us before, we are guided through the images of modern television.

Imagination is only part of this miraculous tale.  This film keeps with the modern idea of fairy tales with some very dark thematic elements.  The scenes with the Trolls and with Snow White were spellbinding.  You could literally get lost in this film and never want to escape.  John Larroquette and Kimberly Williams are decent in their roles (about average for television), but it is Scott Cohen as the Wolf that literally steals every scene.  He plays his part to the fullest extent.  Ed O'Neill and Rutger Hauer also contribute well to this story.

Overall, this was a beautiful (if long) story that continually pushed the boundaries of a television mini-series.  I never knew where it was going to take me next or which fairy tale it would dive right into.  There was never a dull moment and it is a story that can be watched over and over again.

This series is so bad as to be almost unwatchable...in fact, it is unwatchable. I forced myself to sit through it, since I shelled out considerable cash for it in high hopes that it would be the awe-inspiring series mentioned on the back and in reviews.
The problem seems to lie in that the film couldn't decide whether the main audience should be adults or children, and consequently fails miserably to reach either. All of a child's favorite fairy-tale characters are included, which would be fine, but the story had to be ""modernised"", apparently on the presumption that today's ""hip"" kids wouldnt appreciate it and that adults would get bored (it is about 10 hours, after all). So, to spice things up, the writers added gratiuitous sexual innuendo and profanity (like the pathetic ""butt"" kissing episode, but the word used wasn't butt, and I cannot repeat it here since Amazon.com wouldn't allow it and deleted my last review for content...ask yourself if you want your kids watching a film with language Amazon.com won't allow in a review!). How to pick up chicks and pop psychology are thrown in, apparently to amuse the adult audience, but the whole thing just seems grossly patronising and you actually feel a bit insulted and offended while watching. The story line is moronic, and the interplay between the evil queen and her daughter would be deeply disturbing to some children (in short, you are a burden to your parents, and they would do anything, including murder, to get rid of you). The acting is so bad you feel uncomfortable watching it...three notable examples are the babbling, neurotic ""wolf"", the three ""hip"" maniacal troll children and Laroquette's character, who tries and fails to convey that he takes this whole romp seriously. you actually feel sorry for all of the actors in this series, and hope that the poor acting is a result of an irredeemable script and not lack of talent. There are some cute moments, like an obese Snow White (the fairest in the land?) and a geriatric Cinderella (or Sleeping Beauty, I forget) whose youthful face belies bone cracking agony whenever she is invited to dance. All in all, adults will find this film completely unwatchable, and kids will find it weird, incomprehensible or just boring, perhaps a healthy dose of all three.
The sad fact is there was SO much potential here, and the special effects really are spectacular (the opening sequence in particular), and the series' failure to deliver just leaves one angry and wanting to mash the tapes into tiny, little bits, especially after ten hours of hoping that it will somehow get better.
See ""Arabian Nights"" with Leguizamo and others. It tackles the same theme and manages to deliver with much more humor and entertainment in 1/5 the time.",1089331200,27,2907,4.886639676113361

Go, see it! You'll love it!",1088208000,,531,4.977528089887641
1082386,5,6305818282,"I bought this miniseries on a whim.  For less than $13, what's to lose?  Absolutely nothing -- this is a totally engaging and wonderful tale.
From the hilarious predicament brought on by the magical dragon dung wishing bean, to discovering an escape clue in a dungeon written by one of the Grimm Brothers, to the heart-wrenching gift of Snow White's rosebud, this movie is a constant delight for lovers of fairytales and for those who still want to believe that no trollish trial, sorcerous snare or mortal misjudgement exists that can't lead an unlikely hero -- or heroine -- to a ""happily ever after.""  With a little luck, that is, and a helping hand from some unlikely friends.  Like a repentant ""wolf"" who must frequently fight his urge to eat toothsome children or shepherdesses.  Or a pampered prince who learns how to be a king thanks to a spell that turns him into a golden retriever.
It is perhaps not surprising that this film was more popular in Great Britain than in some other locales.  It's witty without being boringly slapstick, whimsical without being maudlin, mature without being embarassingly crude, wise without being conceited or preachy.  Like the old fairy tales, it offers levels of appreciation and enjoyment that go beyond the instant gratification of seat-shaking special effects or in-your-face social moralising.  This film, little spoken of and available at an incredibly low price, is in my opinion a genuine ""Sleeping Beauty.""  If you love fairy tales, I suspect you'll find yourself enthralled with this ""continuation"" of the old stories.  Consider doing yourself the favour -- you'll be as safe with this one as you would be in a ""uh...uh... a brick pig house.""
""Ratings"" Caveat:  There are two or three examples of mildly ""grown-up"" language and situations in the course of the film.  It's not an infantile ""children's story"" to bemuse the very young. But then it's not ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror"" either.",1087689600,2,1944,4.929447852760736
1082387,4,6305818282,"The mini-series/movie was really good.  I thought that it was a typo when I saw how long it is.  It is that long, though.  Being that long, it tends to drag a bit, but overall, it was a wonderful story.  The only thing that I didn't like about it was that the ending was left wide open and there is no sequel in site.  This is supposedly based off of a book, but I had a heck of a time finding it online, let alone buying one.",1085443200,,426,3.8505747126436782
1082388,4,6305818282,"Very funny, witty and mostly entertaining. Once you start waching, you want to watch all the discs straight through. The menu's ""intro"" of this miniseries is absolutely amazingly beautiful, watch it first. If there's anything negative about this film, it's that not all of the jokes work(-which is practically a law in these kinds of films). Some of the funny things end up being just silly and almost stupid. But there's only couple of those. All in all; this movie will move you as well as make you laugh.
The cover and the intro might give you the idea that New York is being transformed into a fairytale land in this film. Fortunately this isn't the case, there's a good plot and most of the events take place in another kingdom- the 9th kingdom. And another thing you don't want to be fooled in: this is a fairytale for adults and teenagers, not for children.",1084579200,2,864,4.580645161290323
1082389,4,6305818282,This is a great movie. It's a wonderful way how they were able to connect a lot of the fairy tales together.

1082390,5,6305818282,"When this Miniseries orignally premired on NBC in 2000, many critics gave it mixed reviews.  They all found it to be an intertaining story, and with its merits, but they all said that a 5-part miniseries spread across 3 weeks, is not the way to tell a story.  And in a way they were right.  The Ratings for part 1 were great, but with each passing episode they got lower, and lower.  The movie eventually left the TV and the minds of America.
But then came the DVD, which is the best way to view this film.  With the DVD a new legion of fans surfaced, and they made this movie a cult classic.  With a running time of a little over 7 1/2 hours, this movie will take 2 or 3 nights to finish, but It is well worth it.
The movie itself centers around a young woman who lives in New York City who wishing something Exciting would happen to her, and she gets her wish, when a young prince from the 9 kingdom's literally runs her over.  But the prince has been turned into a dog, and he needs the girl and her father to return with him to the 9 kingdoms so they can overthrow the his wicked stepmother, and become the king he should be.
The movie has numerous jokes hidden within it, like the ""Tooth Fairy,"" and the ""7 small beds,"" and other surpsies hidden within it.  But the one bad aspect of this movie, is that fact that it will not be understood by younger children (I have found that my 5 year old neice doesn't understand it, but my 13 yearold cousin, does understand most of it).  I myself watching it again 4 years later understand and get alot more of the adult humor (i was 12 when i orignally watched it).
This is a great movie to add to any collect, and you can't beat the price for a DVD that runs more than 7 hours.",1083456000,2,1724,4.122388059701493
1082391,5,6305818282,When I received this movie I cried i was sooo happy! This movie is a modern day fairy tale and can be enjoyed by people of all age!! If you have not seen this movie I strongly advise u to see it post haste!!!!!!!!!! Keep on rocking the free world!,1082505600,2,247,3.96
1082402,5,6305818282,"I was sitting at home in the dark thinking about how the muppets from the Dark Crystal were after me, and that Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) would be there to save me. Help! Help!  When a knock on my door shattered the darkness.  I thought it was it another door to door sales man trying to sell re-runs of Stargate SG-1 the series.  Thank god it wasn't!  It was my girlfriend holding a movie she bought.  It was called The 10th Kingdom.  I never  heard about this mini-series before, until my girlfriend showed it to me.
At first I was only going to watch the first disc, but I found myself taken in by the first ten mins.  The 10th Kingdom is a great DVD to own.
Its got all the things you loved about those classic fairy tales.  Snow White, Cinderella, Bean Stalks, Wolves, Bo-peep and her sheep, and much more.  From the openning, I could tell this was a work of magic.  Watching New York City change into a world where anything is possible.  The CG work is very excellent.  Its easy to get behind all the characters.  Who ever thought that Dianne Wiest (from Parenthood, Lost  Boys, etc.) could play such a evil wicked lady.  I always thought she was so nice and frail till I seen her in this movie.  John Larroquette is hilarious!  Janitor? Criminal? Father? He definetly brings his touch of gold to this film.
And Scott Cohen and Kimberly Williams...can you say chemistry?  Can you say...WOOF! WOOF!  And Ed O'Neil can't seem to get away from being the father of troll children.  And Rutger Hauer  is terrifying as hell as the Huntsman.  A man that lives in the forrest, that never misses his target.
The writing is funny, yet serious at times.  A very great blend.  Such so, it reminds me a bit of Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer).
There really isn't enough words that can express how much I enjoyed this movie.  It was worth the wait.  If you loved all those Fairy Tales as a kid and wish to see what it would be like if in some universe or other planet...like Pluto.  Those stories really were true, and they really did live happily ever after.  The 10th Kingdom shows us were they got those stories from.  A place were dreams are reality, reality is a nightmare.  I give two thumbs up to Simon Moore (EXCELLENT DUDE!).  If you don't have this in your private collection of movies next to David Bowie in spandix singing ""Dance Magic Dance."" I'll send you a basket of apples from the evil Swamp Lady...har har har!!",1082246400,2,2430,4.427601809954751
1082403,1,6305818282,in my perspective this movie was a complete waste of my time and a complete waste of money for the producers. I wouldnt reccomend this at all. Save yourself and don't buy it...ever.,1081728000,4,181,4.515151515151516
1082404,5,6305818282,"Incredible...the adventure begins before you know what hits you, and keeps you enthralled (in the best fairy tale sense) until the end. You find yourself saying ""Be careful what you wish for...you might get it!"" to some of the characters, and the film's creators even managed to get in some sly comments about ecological practices, and make you wonder about the diversity of life in the Nine Kingdoms, and how it came to be. The masterful way the ""real"" story blends with the fairy tale, and the hidden horror underneath the stardust that you are never given full view of until the very end makes this a fantasy that will live in your heart far longer than the monolithic grandeur of The Lord Of The Rings. This movie proves that heroes can come from those we reject, and their victory will surprise not only us, but themselves as well.",1080259200,2,836,4.617449664429531
1082405,5,6305818282,"I stumbled across this miniseries when it was on television.  I was flipping channels and an image of a man being tried by a jury of sheep caught my attention--as I think it would for most people.  I then rented the short version from the video store, but discovered that I would need my own copy, so I ordered the full movie from the NBC store.  If you loved fairy tales as a child, this series is for you.  It answers the question, ""What happened next?"" What happened after Snow White married the prince?  What did the dwarves do after Snow White left them?
The movie follows Virginia and Tony Lewis, who travel through a magic mirror to the Nine Kingdoms, where the Grimm Brothers fairy tales are all history, not fantasy.  Virginia and Tony must travel through many of the kingdoms in pursuit of the mirror before they can return home.  The spoofing of fairy tales is excellent, and the more familiar you are with fairy tales, the more you'll enjoy this series.  It can be dark and violent, like all fairy tales, so I wouldn't recommend it for young children.  Unlike fairy tales, there is plenty of humor to move the story along--an appearance by Ann Margaret as a 300-year old Cinderella who has apparently had magic surgery done, three bumbling trolls who believe Virginia to be a powerful witch because they return from the ""10th Kingdom"" (a.k.a. modern day New York) with a stereo that only seems to play ""Saturday Night Fever"" by ""the brothers Gibb,"" and a sheep-song singing contest which features a very suggestive ""Little Bo Peep"" song and a very rousing ""We Will Sheer You"" that Queen is probably not too thrilled about.
It's simply delightful IF you are a fan of fairy tales.  Highly recommended.",1078617600,3,1711,4.635761589403973

this is a remarkable movie that lifts you into another world! i did not find any part of the movie boring or stupid. it was so entertaining, i forgot i was sitting in my house, i felt like i was there.
my husband saw me watching it one time and he thought it looked so stupid. the next time i watched it, he was bored,
so he sat down next to me and after 5 minutes, he was hooked. he couldn't believe it. now when we are trying to deceide which movie we want to watch, he always says, ""let's watch the tenth kingdom!""
Also, my sister and her husband are not into these 'fantasy' type movies, but i made them borrow it from me and they couldn't get enough. they watched the whole movie in almost one, constant sitting.
this is truly one of my favorite movies. i wish there were more like this. any time i want to 'escape', i put this movie in.
all you have to do is look at how many people gave this movie 5 stars on the reviews and that will tell you what a great movie it is.
there are alot of great celebrities in this movie. JOHN LARROQUETTE is hilarious! he's my favorite character in the movie. i love his sense of humor and pessimism.

When I started watching it I had never heard of it and I had no clue as to what it might be. After I finished watching the first dvd I was absouloutely infatuated with it. It was excellent. The next day I watched Side B and C in the same sitting and I am not very capable of sitting there watching a movie for hours on end, (even *cough* Lord of the Rings, which I just adore the books) but when I watched The 10th Kingdom I was caught up and very impressed. It was EXCELLENT! I cannot imagine no one ever not being able to take pleasure in such a enjoyable movie. I recommend this to anyone, its pleasureable exciting and Wolf (Scott Cohen) steals the show.

In other words, people die, and sometimes in an awful way, but also there is a kind of wisdom and moral that is also passed on despite bad events. Mention is made of the wonderful special effects. They're ok. Good enough (but I just saw Return of the King -- so I'm spoiled).  But it's the script that wins you over (and the acting).

1082433,5,6305818282,"Originally viewed on television, this movie is 7 hours long. That 7 hours takes a while to get through, but it's a fun adventure.

Though it's called the 10th Kingdom, most of it is set in the 9 Kingdoms. The 10th kingdom is actually the world where the main character, Virginia, and her father live. That is, right outside Central Park. When Virginia stumbles across a dog that seems to understand what she's saying, she's caught up in the plot to take over his kingdom (the 4th kingdom). Along with her father, Virginia goes with the dog (whom they've adequately dubbed 'Prince') through a magic mirror into another world.

This world of 9 Kingdoms is a fairy-tale kingdom - or really, THE fairy tale kingdom; you meet Snow White, Cinderella, 3 German mice, a nameless woodsman, the shepherd Peeps, and many other well-known fairy tale characters. In their journey to get back home, Virginia and her father encounter werewolves, dwarves, goblins, magic mirrors, an evil stepmother, and a poisoned apple.

Adventure, humor, romance, war, and intrigue, this movie is great for children (ages 6-18 proven!) and adults alike.",1072742400,,1123,4.962765957446808
1082434,4,6305818282,"It seems everyone has pretty much said a lot about this movie, so I'll just add points I think are key to the movie.
This movie will appeal to those who read lots of fairy tales when young.  It was fun to find the fairy tale stories in this movie.  Knowing the original fairy tales made the spoofs of them comical.  If you've never read fairy tales or don't enjoy them, you likely will think this movie is very stupid, pointless, and not worth the time.  If you don't like the Wolf right away, don't bother watching the rest of the movie.  If you don't like his romance with Virginia, you won't like anything else about the movie, since it will be 7.5 hours trolls and a manic murderer chasing Virginia and the dog (a prince transformed by a spell).  Additional plots develop near the end of the movie to help explain the evil queen's true self (Virginia's mother), leaving nearly the whole movie for you to wonder where she came from.
If you have kids that like to watch a certain movie over and over and over and over and... Well, try this one.  For the price, it's cheap entertainment.  At least you won't have to watch a 70-minute movie over and over (ever watched the Pokemon movie over and over days on end? UGH!), you can break up the monotony by stretching it out to almost 7.5 hours.
CAUTION:  This movie is NOT recommended for children under about 6-8.  Almost every scene involving the trolls contains quite a bit of serious violence that is probably rated R.  The scary trolls may even give young viewers nightmares, since their only goal during the whole movie is to find the dog and later Virginia and kill everything that gets in their way.  Throughout the movie the Huntsman coldly pursues Virginia, the dog, and any one getting in his way.  He's like a methodical, calculating serial killer with all the charm of a serial killer.  Not nice. Eventually after chasing Virginia and the dog for hours and finding no success, the Huntsman convinces the trolls to join him.  Great, 3 bumbling dangerous trolls and a serial killer teamed up to serve the evil queen for even more violence.  Toward the end of the movie, the theme of Virginia's mother (the evil queen) trying to kill her when she was 7 by drowning her in a bathtub, played over and over and over, ought to bring shocking chills that is more graphic than Trolls committing their own violent acts. The queen attempts to justify the attempted murder by telling Virginia that she was nothing more than a mistake when conceived.  I'm sure every child likes to hear that.  (Everyone knows trolls are scary and dangerous, but to graphically demonstrate a mother attempting to murder her own child might be a bit much for little ones.)
The Wolf really DOES steal the show.  I found myself only mildly amused by the overall plot of the movie and kept watching.  However, I found the plot of romance between Virginia and the Wolf to be the theme worthy of waiting to see what happens next.  This could have been a story in itself and been a wonderful movie.  What lady could resist a cuddly cute guy that's a little quirky, yet strong enough to get in touch with his weaker side (in order to tone down his violent wolf nature through self-help books)to gain Virginia's attention.  His persistence eventually pays off with a wild romp in the woods, wolf style.  You know that part of the story ends well, since Wolfie insists that wolves mate forever and he's found his love.  Virginia's father never actually acknowledges his acceptance of Wolfie pursuing his daughter (doesn't every father like to see his precious daughter pursued by a wolf right before his very eyes?). He seems to suspect the desire of Wolf's pursuits, and later, eventually after seeing how well Wolfie takes care of Virginia (who's often bratty and snotty to her father because she's stuck in a fairy tale), convinces Virginia that maybe she likes Wolfie more than she wants to admit.  Virginia thinks about it, and seems to agree, from then on she surrenders herself to Wolf.  Wolf leaves just enough wondering to keep you guessing until the end if he is the good guy or the bad guy, since he's really working for the evil queen and has an agenda to capture the dog and Virginia and bring them back to her.
I rated this a little bit less than perfect because of the unnecessary violence in the plot.  The troll scenes are just plain annoying.  Also, each world Virginia and her father pass through is essentially to introduce as many fairy tales as possible and none of the fairy worlds is more than a passing spoof.  (If you desire a well-developed fairy story, LOTR series is better at placing the roles in the plot.)
Hope you find my additional comments useful.",1072396800,,4703,4.584229390681004
1082435,5,6305818282,"I saw this on TV and had to get the movie; mine came on three VHS tapes, so I don't have the extras for the DVD version.
The movie is about a girl named Virginia who lives with her father in New York city. Her father's a janitor, and she's a waitress, and she has a pretty pessimistic view on life.
Then one day, some trolls and a wolf-man from the nine kingdoms of fantasy come through a magic mirror into the modern world looking for a prince who'd been turned into a Golden Retriever.
Virginia and her father get caught up with the trolls, the wolf man, and the prince, and the wolf-man falls in love with Virginia, even though he's pledged allegiance to the evil queen and Virginia is for the good side.
This is an epic movie with great music and actually a really good plot for a movie on TV. I would definitely recommend getting this movie if you can sit through a, like, five hour long movie in one stretch.",1069977600,,914,4.228571428571429
1082436,5,6305818282,"Until the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy this movie was the most complex fantasy ever attempted.  In some ways the story does ramble, but the intricate elements are woven together so coherently that they smoothly fit into the quest undertaken by the principal characters.

Virginia and Tony Lewis (Kimberly Williams and John Larroquette) live in a New York apartment.  One day a dog enters Virginia's life.  However, the dog is not just any ordinary dog, but Prince Wendell (Daniel Lapaine) changed into a dog by an evil Queen (Dianne Wiest).  Soon trolls enter the story along with magic, and the story begins.

Virginia and Tony travel through a magic mirror into the land of the nine kingdoms (with New York being the 10th kingdom.  It takes Virginia and Tony little time to realize that the world they have entered has very different rules from their own.  Their goal is to find a mirror that will allow them to travel back to their own world, and the quest for the mirror forms the heart of the story.

Along the way both Virginia and Tony, but most especially Virginia, are on a voyage of discovery about themselves.  Through a series of vignettes they learn the history of the nine kingdoms, and learn there are mysteries related to that history.  One of the most startling revelations is that Virginia and Tony are somehow involved in the nine kingdoms, but it's not until we get well into the movie that we understand the nature of their involvement.

The plot is generally coherent and I had little trouble keeping track of the parallel stories.  I admit that there were a few things that confused me when I watched the story in its original television debut, but my confusion was cleared up by watching the DVD version without the commercials and all in one 7+ hour sitting.

The acting talent in this movie is phenomenal.  Rutger Hauer plays the Queen's woodsman, with his own poignant story.  Warwick Davis is Acorn, a criminal with a tongue-in-cheek character.  Ed O'Neil is perfect as Relish the Troll King.  Scott Cohen as Wolf took a little getting used to, but once I realized how he fit into the story, I enjoyed his antics and characterization.  Camryn Manheim makes an interesting Snow White.  Ann-Margret brings class to Queen Cinderella.  This list is but a fraction of the cast possible by the epic nature of this movie.

The story of ""The 10th Kingdom"" is an adult fairy tale.  There is violence in the movie as well as a number of intense scenes that are likely inappropriate for children below the age of 7 or 8.  However, for everyone else this movie is fun and complicated.

1082504,5,6305818282,"A thoroughly enchanting tale.
I began watching it on NBC when it first aired and missed the third instalment.  I didn't want to spoil it for myself, so I refused to watch the others and immediately bought it on VHS from ncb.com.  I have since bought it again on DVD from amazon.  Can you tell I love the movie???
Anyway, the characters are all fabulous.  All have depth and all give sterling performances.  My favourite scene (there are so many) is the courthouse (what a jury!).  In fact I loved the entire farming village portion of the movie.
The engagement ring is a real scene stealer - imagine a RING stealing scenes.  That could only happen in a fairy tale!
The ""ratings bust"" referred to in the editorial I believe came about because it was so long.  Hard to get home every night for 6 nights at the same time to catch this epic.  (Don't bother to mention 'Roots'.  Those were different times and a completely different matter altogether).
The saddest part of the lack of good ratings is that it will probably retard (or completely prevent) another instalment.  If the Video/DVD is selling as well as I think it is though, who knows, we just might get a straight to DVD sequel.

Having been abandoned and living with the pain of that.  Never happy, running from here to there, flirting with danger, making poor choices. The best part of the movie was when Virginia met up with Snow White.  The words and wisdom spoken by Snow White forced Virginia to look at herself and her life.  After this brief encounter, Virginia was empowered to live life on her own terms.  Virginia grew up.  That was a powerful moment.

1082507,3,6305818282,"I am somewhat hesitant to write a negative review for 'The 10th Kingdom', as it seems everybody else loves this mini-series, and we all know that you don't give helpful votes to reviews that actually *are* helpful, but on whether or not you agree with the reviewer's opinion. And here's mine: the 10th Kingdom did not get good ratings on television, and it was for good reason. Although it is colourful, lively, lengthy and entertaining, it is very deeply flawed, and many times this escapist bit of fantasy brings you jarringly back to reality.
Virginia Lewis is a waitress in New York, living with her janitor father Antony Lewis, with a mother that abandoned them when she was just a little girl. Neither of them are particularly satisfied with their lives. Meanwhile, in the parallel lands of the Nine Kingdoms the Crown Prince Wendell White has been trapped inside a labrador's body by the ""Evil Queen"" (the Queen of what exactly?) during a prison visit, and stumbles into an activated Magic Mirror, transporting him to New York City. The Queen makes her escape, sending three trolls, the children of her ally King Relish and another escapee Wolf into New York to retrieve Wendell-in-Dog, whilst she takes Dog-in-Wendell to her estate with a plot to take over the realms.
The two stories collide when a disorientated Wendell stumbles through Central Park and is hit by Virginia's bike on her way to work. In the cataclysmic events that follow Virginia gets the fairytale adventure she's always wanted - but it's not exactly what she expected.
To go into anymore detail on the story would mean exceeding the number of words I'm allowed in a review - the movie is seven hours long, safe to say: lots of stuff happens. But the plot itself is somewhat choppy and confusing and can be divided into three main chunks: Antony and Virginia escape the police; Antony and Virginia try to find the mirror to send them home; Antony and Virginia save the kingdom. This last plot thread undoubtably sounds the most interesting and exciting, however most of the seven hours is taken up with the two of them travelling through various lands after the mirror; everything they do is somehow motivated by simply wanting to get home again, back to those boring lives they take such great pleasure in complaining about.
One wonders why the writers didn't choose to edge into this far more interesting 'kingdom-restoration' narrative rather than the limited wild-goose chase. The reason seems to be (rather shockingly) that the Nine Kingdoms aren't *worth* saving! Throughout the entire story there are barely any sympathetic or worthy people in the fairytale world, and the few that are usually end up dead. To illustrate my point: the governers in Wendell's castle are more interested in Wendell's coronation celebrations than their Prince's safety; the gypsies chase our heroes, intent on murder and then curse them; the dwarfs of the mountain try to execute them twice; the denizens of Kissing Town seem friendly enough, but when a mirror is broken they turn into an angry mob; and a pastorial town has within it murder, theft, a fixed justice system, a fondness for stake-burning, and worse of all: annual beauty pagents! Even the benevolent figure of Snow White is guilty of making her stepmother dance in red-hot slippers.
Also in question is the presumption that this is a kid's movie. Perhaps if it had been shot in darker, more mysterious moods and colours I would be more content in this regard (after all, the original fairytales were intented for adults), but the colourful props and costumes and the bright beautiful scenery suggest a children's movie. A warning to parents of young children: this is *not* a kid's movie, and some of the content may be hard on even older viewers. For instance: the trolls are prepared to torture Virginia, a decapitated head is dangled out of a window, a gathering of trolls is painfully poisoned, a tribe of gypsies is graphically murdered (which presumable includes a young boy that Wolf earlier befriended), a grandfather kills his grand-daughter, and a mother repeatedly attempts to kill her own daughter.
Despite the huge running time, the protaginists have no depth or development at all. Near the start, Tony seems to have no scruples about sleeping with another man's wife whilst she's under a spell, and at the conclusion, Wendell encourages him to make full use of his status as ""national-hero"" to impress the court ladies eying him up on the other side of the table. Virginia fares a little better, but parents might be shocked to see the 'tail stroking' and the 'hide and seek' game between her and Wolf, and the relationship between her and her father (and her mother for that matter) is never fully realised.
However, this movie does succeed in one very important area: it's ENTERTAINING. Most humour is very good - especially Tony's increasing frustration at the quirks and cliches of the fairytale realm, and Wendell's neverending snobbery though he's firmly trapped in the body of a humble dog. The romance between Wolf and Virginia is quite sweet, and out of everyone Scott Cohen puts on the best performance, moving from puppy-dog love to wild frenzy when his werewolf character emerges under the full moon. The scale of the movie is very impressive, as is most of the visual elements: scenery, costumes, makeup and special effects, and most European fairytales are included in one form or another.
It's a fun ride throughout, just not as wonderful as other reviewers would have you believe, and as it is, the movie ends with betrayal, insanity, matricide, and an unwanted pregancy...oh, but its a happy ending!",1054166400,15,5661,4.916405433646813
1082508,4,6305818282,"I was bullied into buying the DVD by my flatmate who told me that since I enjoyed the Harry Potter films, I'd like this one.  And she was right!  I really did enjoy it.
It was very different than I'd anticipated a ""fairy tale"" film to be.  There is a lot of depth to the underlying story of Virginia Lewis and her father, and I appreciated the fact that the scriptwriter didn't have them being the perfect father/daughter pair.  They love each other but get mad at each other and blame each other when things go wrong, just like real people.  Yet, they surmount the mundane in how they ultimately deal with being thrust into a universe that is as far from their reality as can be.  Reluctant questers, they didn't intend to save the Nine Kingdoms, nor find out the truth about themselves, but in the end they do both.
The comedy, for the most part, is adult-oriented, although handled relatively discreetly, and would probably go over most small children's heads.  While there is sexual entendre in a lot of the humor, it's handled adroitly enough that younger kids (and maybe some older ones!) won't pick up on it. The tragedy and violence in certain sections--particularly the ruthlessness of the Huntsman--might be too much for youngesters to take, so I advise that parents view it first without the kids and make their own judgment on appropriateness.  These are grown-up fairy tales.  If you've had access to the original works that the Brothers Grimm recorded, you'll find much of the darkness and frightening bits in here along with the fantasy and pretty bits.
There's plenty of the pre-Victorian morality tales tucked away in the subtext of the script, if you choose to look for it, but you can also watch ""The Tenth Kingdom"" superficially to just enjoy the story, the character interaction, and silliness as well.
Being a child of the 70's I was rather amused by the Troll kids discovering disco, and laughed at the Mushroom Island scene.  I went ""awwwww"" at Wolf's romancing of Virginia.  But the sequence that chilled my blood most was when the Evil Queen asked what the apple orchard family had been told about what happened to the prince, and responded with ""Oh, I'm afraid that's quite the wrong answer.""  You don't see the aftermath--but you know this cold, evil woman did horrible things to a father, mother and little girl, just like in the original versions of wicked Stepmothers before Disney got hold of the concept.
It's not a perfect film.  There are moments when I think, ""come on, already, get a move on,"" when a scene drags unnecessarily, but that's not too often.  And Tony's (John Larroquette) reaction to the frog and the two doors was easily the most hysterically funny moment in the film.
Overall, I enjoyed it enough that I'll watch it over and over again.  I  might skim through parts that aren't as exciting as others and I will probably fast forward through the Troll kids' stuff after the third or fourth time.  But the main story is really good, and I don't consider it a waste of money or time to have bought and watched this DVD.",1053993600,3,3068,4.662337662337662

1082528,5,6305818282,".... TO truly enjoy this movie you must realize that modern versions of fairy tales are not the original. ""Happily ever after"" was invented by disney and has only intensified since the early 20th century. In most FTs the main character was tortured or died to bring the moral accross to the children. With that in mind this movie brings ""the true nature"" of fairy tales to light in making the characters 3d. Although there is a fair bit of cynicism. Since it is a mini series there is a lot of ""slap stick"" involved to keep the flow going. The actors usually deliver a decent performance but there are weak points.

Aside from which there are laughs a plenty from the truly astounding supporting cast and enough nastiness to keep even big boys happy.

The story is good, the filming is excellent, and the actors and actresses are even better, and that's saying something.  Never before have I ever seen such beautiful landscapes either.  When I first saw the commercials for this miniseries, I was like, 'This is the movie for me.'  It's got everything: From adventure, to mystery, to drama, to romance, and of course, fairytales, this movie had everything I had hoped.  Although this movie is a whopping 10 hours long, and you probably wouldn't be able to see it in one sitting, (although, I have -_^)  I still highly recommend you AT LEAST rent this movie twice (you are gonna have to)  It is enjoyable for anyone.",1029456000,2,733,4.635658914728682

1082686,5,6305818282,"I first heard of this movie when it aired as a mini series on television-but I had been preoccupied and missed it all. It never realy crossed my mind to rent it or see it until my friend recommended it to me as one of her favourites. Even then I didn't see it for awhile, until my dad rented it unexpectedly when we were in need of something to watch.
With my three younger siblings, and my older sister we started it out, not exactly sure what to expect. The first 15 minutes did not prove to us that this movie was worth watching-especially with my younger siblings in the room. It had a few doo-dads (aptly so quickly into it) that made us sure it had been rated TV 14. So we turned it off, and they all watched something else.
But, due to my friend, (who has so much in common with me it's truly frightening) her recommendation of it nagged at me-if she liked it, it must be at least semi-good!
So, by my self, I watched the first tape. It was truly amazing to me how much more fun this movie got in it's progression-and by almost the end of the frst tape I found my self in love with it all, the story, truly original, the characters thoroughly loveable, (especially Wolf, who I find temptingly cute. ;) and the movie's magical attribute, that made you never bored in the slightest and on the edge of your pants seat. The trolls halarious and crazy antics and Wolf's love-stricken statements about Virginia had me in fits of laughter.
I waited to surmise the magic on the second night, slipping in the rest of the first tape with sweet anticipation. My older sister, who was apprehensive sat down also in interest. I had to explain a bit to her-after all she only saw the first fifteen minutes and was now skipped all the way to the Gypsies, but before long she was also wrapped into it.
We finished the first tape and immediately stuck in the second. The beginning of the movie clearly was not the whole thing! We laughed and gasped and bit our nails, having the most fun we've had in a long time. Kissing Town-throughly sickening and funny at the same time (to quote our without-a-doubt favourite character, Wolf 'Everyone falls in love in Kissing Town') and the throughly surprising aspects of the entire thing makes it the funnest and most enchanting movie I've seen in a long time.
Pure delightment, fun, and entertainment, The 10th Kingdom will hold you hard once the movie starts up, and it grasps with a hard and exciting grip until the very end. I loved it-and my sister loved it too. We could not have been more mistaken about this movie in our first opinion, and I can't wait to purchase it, to be able to watch it many, many more times.

They are on a quest to find the mirror that brought them to this place of wonders and go back!
They meet friends such as the dog (who is really a prince under a spell!) and the gorgious Wolfie (Played by the hunky, handsome Scott Cohen!)
They also meet some enemies such as the evil queen and the Huntsman.
When the mirror is in there grasp it goes forever. there is only one way back - and that is through the evil Queen - who turns out to be very familier!

This production also has beatiful score for the background and listening to the soundtrack itself is very melodic and special. (Also available here on Amazon.com!) This is fun as much, if not more, for adults than it is for children. It is a long mini-series, but it is fanatstic to watch the Wolf, Snow White and the performances of Johgn Laraquette and Diane Weist (As the Evil Queen).

Virginia Lewis, a waitress from New York, thinks nothing interesting will ever happen to her. That's before she meets Prince, a prince-turned-dog from a different dimension! She follows him back to his world, and the story begins!
Kimberly Williams is great as Virginia, John Larroquette the perfect Tony, Dianne Wiest as the evil queen is so scary, Scott Cohen is dashing and handsome as the conflicted wolf, and Camryn Manheim as Snow White--- good choice!

 The story is AMAZING and the cast pulls it all together beautifully. The adventures as Virginia, Her father Tony, Wolf, and Prince have as they travel the 9 kingdoms looking for a magic mirror to get back home always keeps you on your toes. There is never a dull moment. If the magical qualities of this movie do not entertain you, then the romance that blossoms between Virgina and Wolf surely will.
 Speaking of Wolf, Scott Cohen did such a fantastic job of pulling this character off! I could definitely see how the wrong person cast in this role could've turned the whole movie into a bad experience. However, Scott Cohen is so vibrant and full of life that he illuminates every scene he is in.
The entire cast was phenomenal and perfectly portrayed their characters various nuances.
This movie is great for the entire family as it is full of action, romance, magic, and will surely keep you captivated through its entirety.

1082739,5,6305818282,"""Merlin"" with Sam Neill comes close, but in the end it's ""The 10th Kingdom"" that takes the prize.
This is due in part to Simon Moore's excellent script.  Although it's more than 400 minutes long, never once does ""The 10th Kingdom"" get boring or lag in anyway.  The bit near the end with the singing magic mushrooms is funny beyond all reason.
And this is also due in part to the superb acting.  Rutger Hauer is chilling as the predatory Huntsman, while Dianne West is ice cold as The Queen.  Ed O'Neill brings just the right mix of evil and idiocy to his role of Relish the Troll King, while Hugh O'Gorman, Dawnn Lewis, and Jeremiah Birkett are hilarious as his children Burly, Blabberwort, and Bluebell.  Daniel Lapaine is very good as both Prince Wendell and the canine impostor, Kimberly Williams gives a great performance as Virginia Lewis, and Scott Cohen almost steals the show as Wolf.
The one who DOES steal the show--at least, to me anyway--was John Larroquette as Tony Lewis.  His sarcastic asides and continual flipping between optimism and pessimism make him possibly the best realized character, and John Larroquette does a magnificent job portraying him.
All in all, I HIGHLY recommend ""The 10th Kingdom.""  Just be sure to make plenty of time, because once you start, you won't want to stop.",1012435200,33,1305,4.773333333333333

1082741,5,6305818282,"I almost didn't watch this show because of the length.  I'm glad I did because I would have missed an absolutely wonderful story otherwise.  A young waitress, somewhat disillusioned by life, and her ne'er do well father are thrust into a thrilling adventure in an alternate dimension filled with fairy tale characters from the Brothers' Grimm.  Led by a prince turned into a dog and joined by a half man/half wolf they journey to the 9 Kingdoms where the Prince's stepmother, the Evil Queen plots to take over her stepson's kingdom.  The quartet are pursued by trolls and an evil huntsman, and along the way encounter gypsies, seductive shepherdesses and other magical creatures.
Don't let the length deter you.  Once I got into the story it mezmerized me to the point where I couldn't wait to see how it ended.  The visuals are marvelous to behold as well.  The locations are spectacular, from the Krimmler Waterfalls and Burg Hohenwerfen in Austria to locations in France and England.
The acting by all the major characters is excellent as well -- Kimberly Williams, John Larroquette, Dianne Wiest and Rutger Hauer do full justice to their roles.  However, what kept me glued to the screen was the absolutely fantastic performance by Scott Cohen as Wolf.  Unknown to me before this movie, he blew me away with his portrayal of a half man/half wolf.  He made it easy to believe that he really was part wolf.  His scenes in Little Lamb Village were chilling to see.  Remember his name, because I have every confidence he will be a big star some day.
It's funny, adventurous, scary, and romantic.  There's something there for everyone.  I highly recommend it.
As for the DVD, which I play on my computer, the color is extremely vibrant, and at times it almost seems 3 dimensional.  The extras are fun, although the information about some of the characters in incorrect, i.e. Wolf is NOT descended from Little Red Riding Hood -- that information was made up by the NBC people who didn't consult the writer, Simon Moore, before putting that on their website.",1010880000,,2055,4.781869688385269

The big losing streak for me were the three troll siblings who displayed the worst acting that I've seen since Jeremy Irons was in Dungeons and Dragons (if you haven't seen it...don't!).  Without the impossibly lame acting of the trolls this movie would have deserved five stars in my opinion, but I often found myself wincing when they commentend with such things as ""Nicey Nice"", or danced along to Saturday Night Fever.

If you want a serious fantasy film look elsewhere this is more of a comedy. Mixing a mordern day new yorker girl and her father in fairy tale land was a great idea.
The whole cast was great, but the standouts were Dianne Weiest who gave an excellent performance as the Evil Stepmother and Scott Cohen who was absolutely charming, or should I say ""Scrumptious"", as Wolf.

And maybe the Witch and the Wolf are the only completely convincing actors, but everyone else is above mediocre.  An excellent film overall. Quite enchanting.
I was a bit disappointed at the sexual content at the end. Wolf and Virginia have a little romp in the grass, which shows nothing and probably goes over children's heads, but you're going to have to explain why she has a baby in her tummy at the end. I would have been more impressed with the movie if it could have stayed moral to the end in true fairy-tale style. And when you first see the ending with Virginia and Wolf it says they do not live happily ever after and that upset me, but if you listen carefully it's essentially just saying that tragedies and trials come, but they're still together.
I especially loved the scene where you hear the song Lighter Shade of Pale and they eat the mushrooms, extremely entertaining, and any drug insinuations are not apparent to children. It is a movie worth seeing, more than once.",1007510400,,1147,4.531400966183575

But there were just too many STUPID STUPID things... like the CGI hearts in one scene (sooooo tacky), the trolls singing along to disco music and their very 3-stooges interaction, the terrible overuse of slapstick, the horrible ""We will rock you"" meets ""Miss America"" meets Dark Ages set design... oh, it was just too much.  I sat through the whole thing, expecting -- no, hoping desperately -- that it would get better, but at the end, I felt only that I had lost 6.5 hours of my life I'd never get back.  I think the real capper was a scene filmed somewhere in picturesque mountains... and they didn't bother to edit out the POWER LINES.

You don't see regular super heroes here instead you get a smiling wicked queen (Diane West), an independent cute New York girl (Kimberley Williams), who looking for a good guy finally pairs with an unconventional Wolf (Scott Cohen).

Not to mention and wonderful cast such as Kimberly Williams (Father of the Bride), new comer Scott Cohen as the dashing Wolf, who has racked up a really large fan base since the movie came out, Ed O' Neil (Married with Children), Rutger Hauer, Camryn Manheim as Snow White (The Pratice), the lovely Ann-Margret as Cinderella, Dianne Weist as the Evil Queen (Edward Siccorhands), and John Larroquette as rather the misunderstood father. This movie told a little of the darker side of fairy tales and how it was really told by the Grimm Brothers who wrote these stories, with a little twist of course. Simon Moore did a beautiful job in putting together this wonderful movie for TV. However, it did not do well in the ratings but it did get a lot of fan base on websites etc. I have both the DVD and the VHS and I just absolutely love the DVD version. It's so clear and has great special features such as the Behind the Scene's look inside the Tenth Kingdom (With bloopers, and how they did all the visual effects), Tour of the Tenth Kingdom with a small game. And tons more about the cast and characters. It's fun for the entire family and young children may even love this movie as well. Just advise that parents need to maybe be present with some of the scene's. Other than that it's a great fairy tale for almost all ages.

1082887,5,6305818282,"Tired of sitcoms and news programs? Are you a fantasy buff who can never find anything sufficient to ease your desire for the magical? Well, look no further than the Tenth Kingdom. I admittedly did not watch the miniseries when it was on TV- I instead watched it on DVD after my father purchased it.
Let me tell you, it was great.
One thing that always gets me, in either books, games or movies, is characters. The Tenth Kingdom thankfully has enough wonderful characters to keep me fully satisfied. There's the lonely Virginia, who is played very well by Kimberly Williams, and her bumbling father Tony, played humorously by John Larroquette. Evil characters there are plenty, including Ed O'Neill as the Troll King, his three rather clueless children, Rutger Hauer as the Huntsman you'll love to hate, and of course, Dianne West as a deliciously evil Queen. And no, I haven't forgotten Scott Cohen as Wolf- I was simply saving the best for last. Who can fail to be delighted watching this hungry wolf fall in love with the 'succulent' Virgina and his various conquests thereof to steal her heart?
The basic plotline is thus- The Queen, naturally planning on taking over the Nine Kingdoms, turns Prince Wendell of the 4th Kingdom, grandson of Snow White- into a dog. The prince, Virginia, Tony, and Wolf meet up through various circumstances, are swept away into fairy land, and undergo a quest to find a magic mirror- the only thing that will bring them back home.
The movie is incredibly long- but it has to be, in order to tell its tale. You won't get tired of it- believe me- I once stayed up all night to watch the entire show with a friend. I reccomend this DVD to anyone who enjoys a good, rollicking fantasy full of adventure, comedy, and more Fairy Tale allusions than you can shake a stick at.

1082895,5,6305818282,"living in japan, i had not even heard of this movie. when i saw the cover and the price for 7 and a half  hours, and had the longing to see a good fantasy movie, i decided to try it out.  little did i know that this would become one of my all-time favorite movies!  why?
...well, a few good reasons...
  -the writing is brilliant!  taking many folk lore legends and integrating them seemlessly appears to be a simple deed for these writers.  simply amazing...
  -the incredible cast...something on the package that caught my attention happened to be the cast.  john larroquette! ed o'neill!  al bundy is in this film! i had to get it, i was hooked on the star power alone.
  -the settings...ah, the settings.  i was awestruck that some of these places exist on this earth.  since so much of this movie was filmed outdoors, the crew needed to find places that would be fantastical; something out of a fairy tale.  and find these places they did.  right on!
  -the special effects.  is this a mini-series?!  a made for television event?!  really?!  one is hard- pressed to find effects on ""the big screen"" with this level of believability.  the idea was to have all the eye-candy happen on the screen, but not to over= shadow the cast and plot.  this movie is saturated with awe-inspiring special effects, but these effects never take the place of the terrific acting.  they are timed with precision accuracy.  phenomenal!
  -the length.  after watching this movie i was left longing for a sequel.  i wanted more!  how could one watch for so long but still want more?  like so many good stories, there is so much more to tell!  the plot is so diverse that this movie had to be long.  having a great  story to tell, the producers(robert halmi sr. and jr.) did not want to rush it.  they wanted the whole story. they got the whole story they wanted, but sparked a gigantic world with myriad stories.
  as the viewers, we are brought into this magical world with a guy(john larroquette), and a girl(kimberly williams).  any viewer can relate to, and be put in the place of, these ""normal everyday joes"".  when the ""real"" world and the fantasy world are connected by a hapistance event, our chauffeurs are introduced to this amazing world, and the story unfolds.
  the story is vast and the journey is whimsical, so make time for this epic...it is more than worth it!
  ...by the way, (spoiler alert!)to get to the ""hidden"" 10th kingdom on the dvd special features, simply access the map(the one with details of all the kingdoms), then highlight the main kingdom and press left...ta-dah!",991353600,4,2581,4.6128318584070795

1082959,5,6305818282,"The 10th Kingdom is a truly epic fantasy story, coupling a wonderful
script with good acting, beautiful scenery, and lovely special
effects. It may be seven hours (417 minutes) long, but it never gets
dull. It's fantastic, over the top, and even silly at times, but if
you have a taste for fairy tales, this is not to be missed. Scott
Cohen does an incredible job of portraying Wolf, as does Daniel
Lapaine as the dog turned prince (and the dog plays well, too), and
all the other actors do a very memorable job. And of course it never
hurts to have a cute leading lady such as Kimberly Williams :) The
transformation of New York to a fantasy kingdom in the opening titles
is one of the most incredible scenes I've ever seen.
I've had
problems playing this DVD smoothly on my computer, even when
overclocking my Celeron 300A to 450MHz, and coupled with an ATI
XPERT@Play 98, which supports motion compensation. This is certainly
the most demanding DVD I've ever played. It does pay you back with
very good image quality. Sound is only 2.0 Dolby Surround (which is
fine by me, since I only have stereo speakers). My sound system isn't
that good, so I can't really comment on the quality of the sound, but
it was clear enough for me.
The movie comes on 3 DVD
sides. ""Disc A"" includes 166 minutes plus the special
features - a ""making of"" featurette, which also includes a
couple of bloopers, and textual features about the actors, characters
and the 9 kingdoms. ""Disc B"" (the other side of A) says it
contains 84 minutes, and ""Disc C"" 167 minutes. However, I
think that these figures must be switched. Haven't really measured the
times, but I think that C was shorter than 2.5 hours, and it certainly
contains less data than B, when viewed in Windows.
I thought that it
would have been better to split the DVDs such that the movie is on
just two sides, and leave the special features on the 2nd DVD, if
necessary (although I don't think it's necessary). This is not a major
complaint, however, as you're not likely to see this movie in one
sitting, anyway, and I guess that it makes some sense to break it into
83 minute episodes (which may be the way it was originally
aired).
My biggest complaint is the lack of subtitles. The movie is
closed captioned, but I much prefer subtitles. For one thing, my DVD
player doesn't support closed captioning. The other thing is that
subtitles look better. Since the text is available, it shouldn't have
been too much of a problem to add subtitles. I find subtitles very
helpful in understanding what the actors are saying. Still, this
doesn't detract much from what is a very good movie.",978220800,28,2625,4.540084388185654

I never had a chance to watch it on tv, as it was too long.  However, being able to watch it without commercials is great and at my own pace.  The locations and scenery are beautiful and help to transfer you into the dream world.  Special effects are not too bad, sound and acting is good.
The nice part is the story is familiar as you delve into the world of snow white, cinderella, et al after 200 hundred years.
Unlike most movies that can max out after 2ish hours, this leaves plenty of enjoyment and keeps giving where a conventional movie would stop, and since it is so long in running time, allows for great character development, like a good book.
Well recomended for people who like movies such as ladyhawk, princess bride, conan and the like.

1082964,1,6305818282,"As I write this, I wonder whether it's possible there were two entirely separate ""10th Kingdoms"" released, and I just bought the evil twin version! This series is so bad as to be almost unwatchable...in fact, it is unwatchable. I forced myself to sit through it, since I shelled out considerable cash for it in high hopes that it would be the awe-inspiring series mentioned on the back and in reviews.
The problem seems to lie in that the film couldn't decide whether the main audience should be adults or children, and consequently fails miserably to reach either. All of a child's favorite fairy-tale characters are included, which would be fine, but the story had to be ""modernised"", apparently on the presumption that today's ""hip"" kids wouldnt appreciate it and that adults would get bored (it is about 10 hours, after all). So, to spice things up, the writers added gratiuitous sexual innuendo and profanity (like the pathetic ""butt"" kissing episode, but the word used wasn't butt, and I cannot repeat it here since Amazon.com wouldn't allow it and deleted my last review for content...ask yourself if you want your kids watching a film with language Amazon.com won't allow in a review!). How to pick up chicks and pop psychology are thrown in, apparently to amuse the adult audience, but the whole thing just seems grossly patronising and you actually feel a bit insulted and offended while watching. The story line is moronic, and the interplay between the evil queen and her daughter would be deeply disturbing to some children (in short, you are a burden to your parents, and they would do anything, including murder, to get rid of you). The acting is so bad you feel uncomfortable watching it...three notable examples are the babbling, neurotic ""wolf"", the three ""hip"" maniacal troll children and Laroquette's character, who tries and fails to convey that he takes this whole romp seriously. you actually feel sorry for all of the actors in this series, and hope that the poor acting is a result of an irredeemable script and not lack of talent. There are some cute moments, like an obese Snow White (the fairest in the land?) and a geriatric Cinderella (or Sleeping Beauty, I forget) whose youthful face belies bone cracking agony whenever she is invited to dance. All in all, adults will find this film completely unwatchable, and kids will find it weird, incomprehensible or just boring, perhaps a healthy dose of all three.
The sad fact is there was SO much potential here, and the special effects really are spectacular (the opening sequence in particular), and the series' failure to deliver just leaves one angry and wanting to mash the tapes into tiny, little bits, especially after ten hours of hoping that it will somehow get better.
See ""Arabian Nights"" with Leguizamo and others. It tackles the same theme and manages to deliver with much more humor and entertainment in 1/5 the time.",974764800,38,2907,4.886639676113361

I was about to write it off after the first five minutes but then I kept watching and soon it started to grow on me, probably because of the Wolf character (played by Scott Cohen).  It is one of the better fantasy epics that I have seen and even though the play time of about 6 hours may seem daunting, the character development and story have no great slags, after you get into the story.  And while I tried to come up with some part that could have been cut to make it shorter nothing came to mind.  Now I have passed the DVD on to friends and family and they are all hooked on the story and characters.  The bumbling of the main characters, Tony, Kimberly, Wolf, and Prince Wendell (as a dog), give the whole atmosphere of the fairy world an endearing and slightly off center comedic turn.  Other notable characters that really bring the story alive are the three Trolls and their father, the Troll King, the Huntsman (masterfully played by Rutger Hauer), and the deliciously evil Queen (played by Dianne Wiest) who might look like a sweet lady and but is really the biggest witch in the nine kingdoms. I would also like to mention one of my favorite scenes that revolves around a certain swamp and some nasty mushrooms, just watch it was hilarious.  My only complaint is that the story leaves off with Kimberly saying that this is the first book of the story of the 10 Kingdoms.  I WANT MORE!!!",972086400,,1485,4.374545454545455

Scott Cohen steals the show, but the most unexpected pleasant surprise is how the story changes halfway through (I won't spoil it).  You're going along for a couple of hours thinking you know what the final resolution has to be - then it takes a dramatic twist just when you figure you're in for 4 hours of ""almost make it"" re-hashing..

My younger sister and I were searching for something equally  pleasing to our totally different tastes in television (I like X-Files, she  likes anything on Nickelodeon). I turned on ""The Tenth Kingdom""  and we were intrigued. After the first commercial break, the remote was  never touched. The characters, especially Wolf, were lovable and  interesting. The plot was twisty and unpredictable, though it dragged at  times. The scenery was gorgeous, and the opening sequence made my jaw drop  and left me speechless. Some language I wouldn't approve for children under  9 or 10, but other than that it was appropriate for all ages. I even  checked out the web site the next day.

The  characters were outstanding and it was very funny and romantic and full of  adventure.  A real mixture of everything you could want in a great story.  So I bought the DVD and was finally able to watch the whole thing from the  beginning and trust me, it was one of the best investments I've made!  It  may not be for everyone, but I personally thought it was one of the best  things I've seen in years.  I truly felt as if I had walked through that  mirror with them and into another world.

I would have preferred not having  to explain to my children why Wolf and Virginia were having a baby without  being married, it would have been nice if that little bit could have been  left unsaid.  95% of this movie is very fun and most of the double  entendres went right over my kids heads, which I appreciated.  It's a great  movie for parents and kids to watch together because mom and dad get all of  the jokes and the kids just enjoy the silliness of the whole thing.

So I obtained the video copy and was _again_ disturbed to see  that it, too, was edited! But each one was edited in a different manner!  For example: Parts about the Queen were left out of the second TV version,  but were left in the VHS, while one of my favorite scenes (the Mushrooms  trying to convince Tony to put them in the omelette) was left out of the  VHS version!

I was so excited I could hardly speak that day, and with those  eight exciting words (And now, NBC prodly presents: The TENTH KINGDOM) I  was put into a world of what seemed to be the nine kingdoms. Through the  breathtaking introduction inwhich Manhatten is turned into a fairyland,  through the transformation of Prince Wendall, through the plotting of the  queen, the mirror transportation of Virginia and Tony, all the way to the  point the evil queen told the dog ""I shall finish her work, and  destroy the house of White forever, and pity the fool who tries to stand up  to me!"" I was officially hooked.  Scott Cohen, who portrayed a  werewolf who guides Tony and Virginia along their quest, stole the show  with his humourous antics.  Camryn Manhym portrayed a Snow White like no  other, but was not exactly what I would call the fairest of them all.  The  trolls were the only things in the ENTIRE movie that dissapointed me.  Their acting ability, excellent I must say, but the way their costumes and  make-up was done (them and Clayface the Goblin)was inexcusable.  With all  the other special effects, I would expect something a bit better then an  ungly person in chainmail.  But none the less, the movie was one of the  coolest I've even seen, and I would suggest it to anyone, it brings out the  child, the fairy-tale lover, in all of us.  It makes one forget their  problems for a breif(i'm sorry, any word but BREIF should be used in  there)for a long 7 hours in which we can return childhood and hear a new  fairy tale that noone but Hallmark Entertainment could dream of.

1083020,4,6305818282,"From talking mirrors to magic beans, werewolves, wishing wells, and troll dust, The 10th Kingdom is an experience you'll never forget. With an all-star cast, incredible special effects by Artisan and a truly unique premise, this modern-day fairy tale will cast a spell over the entire family. It involves laughter, tears, many valuable lessons, and a shocking plot twist. This kind of modern blend between The Princess Bride and Snow White hasn't been successfully done until now... but Hallmark pulls it off with kid gloves.

Perky, blue-eyed Virginia Lewis (Kimberly Williams) lives on the edge of Central Park within biking distance of her workplace, a half-rate diner where she spends most of her time. Her father Anthony (John Larroquette), once a successful businessman, is now an underpaid, overworked and often ill-treated janitor at their apartment building. The two share a boring existence, barely standing one another and desiring for a more exciting life. Virginia has resigned herself to the fact that this desire will never come true... but little does she know the adventure that is about to envelope them all in mystery, magic, and danger. The 9 Kingdoms have lived in peace since the imprisonment of the Evil Queen, Prince Wendell White's stepmother. But with the young and selfish prince's coronation forthcoming, he has been asked to make the rounds of his province, including a routine visit to the prison. The Queen (Dianne Wiest) has awaited this moment and formulates a daring plan with the aid of the Troll King.

Wendell's manservant is murdered and the prince himself is imprisoned in the body of a dog, stripped of his rights and his voice. In his place, the Queen places an imposter... her doggy friend (Daniel Lapaine). But her plans go terribly wrong when the dog manages to escape into the cellars, and from there through a magic mirror into modern-day New York. After him she sends Burley, Blabberwort, and Bluebell, along with one of the prison inmates, a werewolf imprisoned for 'sheep worrying' (played by Scott Cohen). Prince leaps out of the mirror into the Park at the precise moment Virginia speeds by on her bike. There is a violent collision and she takes the dog with her to work, little knowing a pack of strange magical creatures will soon be on her trail. After that point, strange things begin to happen to Virginia... from a dog that seems to want to tell her something to three trolls who invade her home, terrorize her father, and steal her shoes, and even to a insane guy who breaks into her grandma's apartment and tries to cook her.

Through a series of comical and unexplainable events, Virginia, Tony, and Prince are forced to flee through the mirror and into the 9 Kingdoms where nothing is as it seems... talking mushrooms, wishing wells, invisibility shoes, poisoned apples, talking birds, evil huntsmen, and fairy-tale creatures run rampant, from a 200-year-old Cinderella to the Tooth Fairy. The story is alive with myth, humor, and surprisingly two-dimensional characters while packing every gag, fairy tale character, and pun ever invented into a hilariously amusing story with a surprisingly dynamic climax. If you can't see the humor in the werewolves, elves, fairies, trolls, dwarves and blind woodsmen that traipse across the screen, you won't understand the messages that the film also has to offer about family, friendship, loving compassion, and forgiveness.

The production is a captivating and highly entertaining saga of mystery, magic, and romance that actually leaves you with something to think about. Hidden beneath the silliness are true lessons about learning to trust yourself and others, forgiveness, not fleeing from your problems, and being courageous even when the stakes are down. Now that's magic.",965088000,2,3782,5.105008077544427

I'm pleased that it was nominated and I do believe it  deserves to win, but why am I not surprised it wasn't nominated for  Outstanding Mini-series or any of its actors nominated for anything at  all?
1) It's not an established and well-known story.
2) It's not a  true story.
3) It's not short enough to hold the average attention  span.
What is it?
In a word, `different'.
All hail the mighty Simon  Moore, unafraid to create something that contains disturbingly dark events,  and combine them with something so sickeningly sweet that you're afraid  your teeth will fall out from such sugary goodness.
But how about an  intro...
WARNING! CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST PART!
Virginia Lewis is  a waitress who works on the edge of Central Park. Still living with her  father, Tony - a janitor - she has pretty much come to the conclusion that  her life will always be boring. Nothing exciting has ever happened to her.  She has no romance in her life, and seems to face said life with an  attitude that it's something to get through rather than something that  should be enjoyed.
Meanwhile...
Two hundred years after the reign of such  well-loved Queens as Snow White, Cinderella, and the Lady Rapunzel, dark  times cover the 9 Kingdoms. Happily ever after didn't last as long as  everyone expected.
After being held in Snow White Memorial Prison for  seven years, the Evil Queen escapes and promptly turns her stepson - Prince  Wendell, who is soon to be crowned King - into a dog.
Fleeing in dog  form, Prince crashes into a mirror which - unknown to him - is a travelling  mirror. The mirror activates and seeing no other way out, Prince leaps  through...
...and finds himself in The 10th Kingdom.
Otherwise known as New  York.
Quickly bumping into a bike-riding Virginia, both of them crash to  the ground, unconscious.
Back in the 9 Kingdoms (specifically The 4th  Kingdom), The Evil Queen is determined to catch Prince at any cost. As well  as sending three Trolls after him through the mirror, she enlists the help  of a prisoner who is half-man, half-Wolf, and always hungry. But things are  not always as they seem...or not for long.
Thus ends the  introduction.
Intrigued?
I hope so.
Not intrigued?
Fair  enough.
To be able to watch this and enjoy it, you have to have a good  appreciation of the absurd. If you have that, you'll love it.
Let's talk  characters:
Virginia Lewis: Portrayed by Kimberly Williams, best known as  the daughter from The Father of The Bride movies with Steve Martin. This is  her story, and it's an understandable and well-portrayed role. Essentially  she's not a likeable character, but she's someone we all associate with and  understand. We've all been where she is now.
Tony: Greedy, put upon,  inconsiderate, laconic. But he's funny. Really. Brilliantly portrayed by  John Larroquette, he has just the right amount of humour to make him  likeable - not to mention the dose of reality he brings to the frankly  bizarre events surrounding him. Along with other things, he plays the part  of `the audience' - just as things get a bit too weird, he cracks some line  that the audience will agree with and laugh at.
The Evil Queen: Brrr.  Dianne Wiest. Oooo. Just that bit too evil to be that which separates the  good and the bad. Killer rings, too.
The Huntsman: Rutger Hauer rocks. I  think that's all we need to say.
The Troll King: Ed O'Neill. Al Bundy in  make-up, and about as likeable. But that's the point.
Saving the best for  last...
Wolf: Scott Cohen.
The 10th Kingdom is Virginia's story, but if  anyone makes it their own story it's Wolf. Stealing absolutely every scene  he's in, this is a man who ACTS for every single second of his screen time,  and then some.
Child-like, enthusiastic, enjoying life with an effort  that is a joy to watch, acting on all of his instincts as soon as they  strike, desperate to be a good person but unable to resist his wolf nature  to tie people up and eat them.
This is, ladies and gentlemen (pigs and  sows, rams and ewes), an award winning performance. Forget the Emmy awards.  This man has cultivated a huge following in an incredibly short amount of  time.
I've forced many of my friends to watch The 10th Kingdom (all seven  and a half hours, and yes - they are still talking to me), and though  differing in overall opinions (some loved it, some thought it was too  romantic, some thought it just daft), all of them agreed that the best  thing about it is Wolf. In their words he is ""funny"", ""gets all the best  lines,"" and ""carries the entire thing.""
Whether or not I agree with their  statements is beside the point: this actor and this character made an  impact, and continue to do so.
Overall...
The 10th Kingdom is far from  perfect. The Troll King's children are unbelievably irritating. It does  drag in places. Kimberly Williams makes me laugh when she cries.
But it's  not that far from perfect.
If you've always enjoyed fairy tales, if  you've always enjoyed romance, if you've always enjoyed humour, if you've  always enjoyed things that are just a bit daft...watch The 10th  Kingdom.

I think all performers  turned in an excellent job in the acting, but what captured me the most is  the scenery. Throughout the movie, the scenery was absolutely beautiful and  breathtaking.  I think the best part about the DVD is the behind the scenes  special hosted by Larroquette.  Though only a half hour, it was very  interesting.

It was  also quite humorous with such jokes as one of the Grimm Brothers being  locked in the same cell as the main characters (200 years prior of course),  and the hysterical antics of Wolf.

Scott is a perfect compliment to the other zany characters, and he plays his role so well that several yahoo clubs have popped up to celebrate it!  From rpging clubs, to discussion-type clubs, this movie's made an impression on many folks, but as for me, well, I bought the book, the CD and the VHS tapes!  I want (and will buy soon) the DVD for the behind the scenes parts.
It is a long sitting, but after all it's five nights worth of mini-series, so what else would one expect?  I bought the Cd just for the theme song, and (disappointingly) Protocol Harum, which wasn't on there: Whiter Shade of Pale, the backdrop to a rather humorous section of the show.  Thank goodness the Gibb brothers wasn't on there, tho!  Buy this and see what trolls can do to the brothers' Gibb's music!  Diane is a perfect evil queen, and the actor behind Al Bundy is a terrific troll king. At least 75% of the movie has you laughing, and the rest has you thinking deeply.

1083094,3,6305818282,"I would characterize the 10th Kingdom as a plot-driven epic, not a character-driven story. Plot-driven stories depend on the twists and turns of the story's sequences to keep one's attention. Character-driven stories  depend on the development of the characters in response to the plot to keep  one's attention. Although the 10th Kingdom has all sorts of possibilities  for character development, none of it really pans out. That weakness will  be discussed a little later.
The overall strengths and weaknesses of this  story are centered in its plot.  The length of this film should be the  first clue that the story is epic in nature. Although the plot initially  suggests a restoration theme, it soons switches to a search (initially for  the means to return to their own world), and finally becomes (to rephrase  the theme in PC terms) a parent quest.  Cambell's studies on Mythology,  reintroduced to the modern world the epic concept of a son searching for  his father and thus coming to understand his identity. The 10th Kingdom is  really about Virginia searching for her mother and coming to understand her  identity.
But this is not a nice fairy tale. Unlike STAR WARS, which had  the same theme, the 10th Kingdom does not concern itself with redemption.  Rather the child becomes directly responsible for the parent's unredemptive  death. This should have been  a tragedy, but everything is neatly swept  under the rug with the excuse that the mother was insane (in other words  beyond redemption), hence the strange Happily Ever After Ending.
The  ending of this story could lead to an interesting discussion of the nature  of Fairy Tales in our lives (Happly Ever After, Inspite of insurmountable  barriers), and other dramas, such as INTO THE WOODS, have discussed the  same issues. I understand that the primary purpose of the original Brothers  Grimm was to try to  understand the German national character by examining  its Folk Tales. These were indeed dark stories: recall that Hansel and  Gretel were not sent into the woods by their Step-mother. No, their mother  was responsible for trying to leave them in the woods to die.
The Fairy  World of the 10th Kingdom is full of (as Tony puts it) homicidal maniacs.  There is a great suggestion of insanity everywhere. Even Snow White (in the  history of this world) is responsible for torturing her step-mother at her  wedding. A huntsman is tricked into killing his son, yet serves the person  who tricked him instead of seeking revenge. Bo Peep is a little creep and  is killed by her Grandfather. The reason that this horror doesn't become  overbearing is that most everything is played for laughs.
The plot  becomes the first major weakness of this epic. We see all sorts of dark  (and also amusing) versions of our fairy tales, but few of them really lend  themselves to any of the quests, rather they seems like unnecessary side  trips. And  there are so many of these side trips that don't seem to add  anything to the story progression, that one begins to wonder if the trips  are simply an excuse for the writer to poke fun at another tale. Well, if  that is what you like, OK, but  one of my children got bored to tears about  half way through the film and gave up. She didn't even care to know how it  turned out in the end.
Then there is the problem with the characters. In  this entire cast, there are only two characters who show any level of  multi-dimension. Let me take a moment and explain what I mean by  multi-dimension. It is a character, whose decisions can surprise you  because there are many dimensions to their motives. If the character's  behavior is predictable, then they are one-dimensional. This film is  unfortunately chock-full of single dimensional characters. That is  unfortunate because the potential for better characters is clearly  there.
For example, Virginia is described as having changed by being more  self reliant, but anyone who has seen the film knows that isn't true.  Virginia is just as self reliant at the first of the story as at the end.  The only thing is that she may have realized it more, but that doesn't lend  itself to character development. Tony is suppose to have become more brave.  Does anyone really belive that?
Is it any surprise that it is the Wicked  Stepmother and Wolf who show any level of multi-dimension, although even  they become predictable near the end of the story.
Do I recommend this  film? Yes, but it is not a five star movie. My daughters and I ended up  watching this film in 1 1/2 hour sessions.",960768000,10,4549,4.779639175257732
1083095,5,6305818282,"I didn't get to see any of this on TV.  The trailers looked interesting, but I thought it would probably be a bit cheesy.  But I bought a new DVD player, and I thought, ""Hey, 7+ hours of entertainment for the price  of 2.  That's a bargain for me!""
I was wrong about it, though.  It  was perfect!  The acting was all excellent.  (The big bad wolf in  particular was amazing--I've never seen anyone look so flamboyant while  still coming across as very hetero, and the wicked witch was really evil  without being a flat character.)  The story, although of course very long,  was improved by having sort-of intermediate endings, and the script was  clever and involving.  The special effects were good without being  obtrusive, and the scenery was just right.
I think it would have been a  lot worse on TV, because there were obviously commercial breaks very  frequently, and it loses the mood of the fairy tale to have it interrupted  every five minues by a Sentra ad (or whatever).  If you saw some of this on  TV and ""just couldn't get into it"", give it another try.
The  ""Making of..."" was included on the DVD.  It was pretty bad.  It  appeared to be something that might have been shown separately on TV.  If  you just saw the ""Making of"" thing, don't let that bias you  against the real thing.",960249600,7,1297,4.474137931034483

Luckly, I did  know the time for the last part (part 5) and taped that.  When I was  finished wathing that, I knew I had to watch the whole thing.  When I found  it at my Blockbuster, I rented it, even if it was the ""edited  version.""  After I saw the ""Edited version"" I knew I had to  own the entire movie.  So I went to nbc.com and ordered the ""10th  ertainmentpackage"" which has the book, soundtrack CD, and the 3 TAPE  set of ""The 10th Kingdom.  Since this version has more tapes then the  version at amazon.com, I'm guessing this has the complete 10 hours of the  movie minus the commercials!!!!!

While the make-up and special effects are OK, the acting, with the exception of ""Wolf,"" is mediocre, and the story line is weak.  Beyond that,  though the plot seems geared to pre-teens, the subject matter is definetly  not for children.  Unlike the fairy tales on which the setting is based,  there are no moral stories here to encourage youngsters (and oldsters  alike) in development of strong characters.  Instead, we have ""good  guys"" who waste their six wishes on beer, revenge, slothfulness, and  other selfish desires.  We have Wolf admiring Virginia's ""succulent  breasts.""  We have ""heroes"" stealing and cheating to win a  contest, then gambling to raise money.  We are shown premarital sex with no  remorse, and a father whose only reaction to his daughter's moral failure  is to roll his eyes.  By the end of the movie several characters do display  a  selfless act or two, but we are left with a story whose characters, at  their best, are still poor role models.  Art has the ability to ennoble us  or to coarsen us, and this movie definitely leaves the viewer far short of  anything noble.  For a good moral tale, I would recommend First Knight  (1995, Sean Connery), where the characters struggle with understanding and  fulfilling moral principles, or Beau Geste (1939, Gary Cooper). ...",959126400,17,1436,4.895397489539749

1083146,5,6305818282,"Although a little slow to start, this miniseries soon has you captivated.  Imagine Grimm's Fairy Tales, 200 years on and everything is not Happy Ever After anymore.
Virginia and her father, Tony, (from New York) pass  through a magic mirror to aid Prince Wendall, who's been turned into a dog  by an evil Queen.  They are joined and guided on their journey by Wolf who  is half-man, half-wolf.  Initially controlled by the Queen, Wolf changes  his alliance when he's meets Virginia and falls in love with her.
The  adventure is fantastic, along with the effects.  Each character is  carefully drawn and essentially the movie is about each of them finding  themselves and then each other.
Virginia starts out cold and in tight  control of her emotions, resenting that her mother left her when she was  young. Wolf eventually manages to break through her defence with his  passion and enjoyment of life.
Tony starts out a whining coward but ends  up a hero.
Prince Wendall starts out spoilt and a snob but by the time  he's restored to human form, he's a wiser man.
And Wolf, well, he's a  tortured soul that wants to be good and due to his love for Virginia he  finally manages to overcome his wolfish side - although, thankfully, not  totally!
To explain Wolf's dilema it's easier to quote him. While talking  to a therapist about Virginia he says: ""I've met a girl that I really,  really like but I don't know whether I want to love her or eat  her.""
Scott Cohen who plays Wolf definitely steals every scene he's  in but having said that, the other actors are excellent too and they all  work well together.
Lastly, I just wanted to mention Rutger Hauer who  plays the Huntsman.  It's another great baddie role for him and he is just  wonderful - he has such quiet menace!

We have the heroine, Virginia, a  New York waitress who lives with her father and longs for something to  happen when she hits a dog in Central Park who isn't really a dog at all.  We have her father, Tony, who is approached by Wolf - supposed minion of  the queen who falls in love with Virginia - and given six wishes, all of  which he uses to great comic effect. And this, you realise, is only the  first episode set in New York.
The 10th Kingdom is stuffed full of faery  tale elements which help to keep the story going along and interesting:  trails of breadcrumbs, magic mirrors, dwarves, dragons, a Midas touch,  poisoned apples, evil queens, bad luck and wishes, princesses and quests.  It's the story of Virginia and Tony's struggle to get back to New York,  woven in with Wolf's pining for Virginia, the plottings of the Queen for  Wendel's kingdom and half a dozen little subplots and ideas woven in. Just  when you think the story's getting stale, something else bursts out and  livens everything up.
This is a brilliant series with a snappy script and  special effects which add to the story rather than becoming it. The  characters are interesting and fun, and the dialogue is hilarious.

Acorn the dwarf was a nice touch, my heart  wrenched when he showed up in the swamp as the Swamp Witch.  I thought  really thought he was the witch.  What an amazing cast.  The trolls were  especially funny, they sang old 70's songs and had such lines as  ""three trolls with the courage of one"" and ""we haven't heard  anything, we've been gold.""  What a creative and daring concept.  I  only wish I were this creative. There was alot of foreshadowing, but not so  much it gave away anything except the stuff you already knew.  Everyone was  connected to everything that happened there.  Minimal cussing and violence.  A short scuffle towards the end, but the Queen and huntsman were  responsable for it.",956188800,,876,4.564935064935065

I  know, in reality, that can never happen, but this movie lets me live out  that fantasy, if only for a short time.  The soundtrack was excellent, as  were the costumes and scenery.  The roles were perfectly cast.  The actors  and actresses did an outstanding job.  I love this movie so much that I  could not wait for amazon and others to carry it, so I bought it from NBC.

The movie was quite  long and might be to much for a young person to handle.  But for adults,  it's a trip back to your childhood where at one time, all this was real to  you.  The only problem I had with the movie was the actress cast as Snow  White.  She just didn't have it.

Well written, so it  kept me stuck with TV for 6 hours straight (only went to the bathroom when  the trolls came out).
The main point of the movies may be too complex for  kids younger than 12 years old. However it is very funny and romantic. Mr.  Dad and Mr. Wolf did a great job, so did Verginia. Too bad NBC did not give  them enough credits in the promotion, I did not even remember their names.  I taped this movies, watched 3 times and decided to buy a DVD.",953337600,3,733,4.466165413533835

He had class, was able to pull of a truly magnificent part of a half man  half wolf. Not to mention that he was so handsome.  The story takes place  in the 9 kingdoms, you'll have to watch it to understand that better,  formed by Cinderella, Snow White and Little Red Riding Hood.  Virginia, a  girl from Manhatten, is pulled into the kingdoms by traveling mirrors and  is sent on a journey with her father, Wolf, and a dog that can talk ( I  know it sounds cheesy but you have to watch it, really ). Throughout the  journey their goal is to retrieve the mirror so they can return to New  York, but as they come closer to the mirror it becomes harder to get. They  have to enter contests and raise money to get a grasp on the mirror, but  all the while a magical love story unfolds between Wolf and Virginia,  making it more complicated.

Diane Weist made evil somehow dignified, Kimberly Williams did a  great job of playing the modern twentysomething (whining and all) even  while surrounded by talking dogs, singing rings and the occasional troll or  dwarf.  It was great to see John Laroquette again, and Scott Cohen (why had  I never heard of him before?) took a great character and made him  unforgettable!  The one flaw I've always seen in fairytales is that the  love interest is a bore - he either doesn't have much of a personality, or  only shows up at the end to save the day with a kiss.  Replacing Prince  Charming as the love interest with this wolf was a stroke of genius, and  Cohen gave us his all, making Wolf walk the line between criminally insane  and flat-out charming - sweet, edgy, naive, earnest and frightening all in  turn.  To those who are concerned about the length: It flew by and I was  sad to see it end at all.  This is not to say there weren't flaws.  The  trolls were way overdone, there could have been tighter editing, and I was  a little dissapointed in the resolution, but any production that could hold  my attention for ten hours over a two-week period and leave me wanting more  had to be doing something right.",952732800,11,1378,4.599173553719008

I certainly know that I will be watching it  over and over and over again!  I wish with all my heart that I was able to  travel to the Nine Kingdoms.  I know I wouldn't want to come back, not even  for all the gold Wendells in the 4th Kingdom!",952646400,,939,4.174157303370786
1083342,5,6305818282,"I missed the first part, but I ordered the NBC package offer (good idea!). I found it to have various aspects of suspense, humor (lots of that), romance, and sadness, that makes it a great Made-For-T.V. movie. I  especially liked the character ""Wolf"", I thought he was very  funny. This movie is a great family movie, but I probably wouldn't  recommended this for younger viewers. Job well done, NBC!",952560000,,400,4.768115942028985
1083343,5,6305818282,"I've seen too many mini series to recount here. I read the TV guide review of the 10th Kingdom and almost didn't watch it. What a mistake that would have been. For the first time since I have been able to remember, they put  something on after 9pm at night that didn't involve sex and violence. The  10th Kingdom is something the whole family can enjoy. And with Rumours of a  weekly series starring Kimberly Williams, John Laroquette and Scott Cohen,  I can't wait. Wolf stoled the show completely, he's got a fan in me, I'd  play hide and seek with him any day! The 10th Kingdom has something for  everyone. The Kids will love the fairy tale aspect, the adults will love  the jokes that go over the kids head. Its for everyone who ever did believe  in fairy tales.",952560000,3,766,4.382978723404255

But i seemed to like the fairy tales better than the movies, and  delighted telling my friends what the real story was of Cinderella and Snow  White. We all were overjoyed when we learned about this mini-series, we  watched it in delight and talked about it the day after. I bought the book,  and started reading it, but i can't wait for this enchanting tale of  courage, love, and loyalty to come out on tape. I absolutly loved it when  we learned how they knew these stories, very well done! Highly Recommended!",952560000,2,667,4.426229508196721

1083373,5,6305818282,"This movie is terrific! I first saw it on NBC last  week,and after the 2nd part I ordered it off of the NBC website. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat,and you never know what will happen next! It keeps you  guessing till the end! It all starts when Virginia Lewis finds a dog who  was formerly a prince. Virginia and her father Tony follow the dog into  another world known as the 9 kingdoms. There they are joined by Wolf, a  half human-half wolf hybrid and they must find a magic mirror to get home.  Anyone who likes fairy tales should watch this movie. But be warned: it  does have a TV 14 rating. Don't watch this movie if you don't want to see  the other 4 parts, because you will get sucked in!",952473600,6,713,4.115942028985507
1083374,5,6305818282,"The 10th Kingdom ranks as one of the more clever and certainly the most visually rewarding miniseries in many years. The idea was a tough one to pull off--after all, how do you mess with not just ONE classic fairy tale,  but a whole slew of them!  10th Kingdom works because it treats these  great fairy tales with reverence, wit, and good old fashioned panache; it  combines these gems in a story that is fresh and very well-imagined. Kudos  to the writers, who rarely displayed the kind of smug self-indulgence so  common on tv today. The cast was also superb in every way, particularly  Kimberly Williams, who lights up the screen with both her assured acting  and pixieish charm. John Larroquette scores as well in his role, as does  Dianne Weist as the recalcitrant Mother from Hell. Note the appearance of  Warwick Davis (of Willow, Leprechaun fame) as Acorn! All in all, a fine,  original spin on some timeless themes. Perfect for romantics, fantasy buffs,  and ANYBODY that appreciates good entertainment on film.",952473600,2,1021,4.838150289017341
1083375,5,6305818282,"I watched all 5 nights of ""The 10th Kingdom"" on NBC and then orderd the video.  It's a magical, compelling production.  First, the script is excellent.  Simon Moore has written a textbook example of  craftsmanship.  His characters develop over time, his dialogue is clever  and always has a purpose, and every plot detail is well set-up and  resolved.  I never had the sense that I knew exactly what would happen or  that anything was unbelievable or a ""groaner"".  The love story  sub-plot was beautfilly paced, highly-charged and compelling.  But even  better than the technical details of the script, I admire Moore's sense of  invention.  There were many original and delightful ideas in the  screenplay, from the mushrooms singing ""Shades of Pale"" to aging  fairy tale queens to the tongue-in-cheek hilarity of ""Little Lamb  Village"".  Wolf, in particular, was one of the most colorful and  intriguing characters I've seen in some time.  He begs comparison with  characters like ""Data"" in Star Trek (though Wolf is more  interesting).  The production details were everything that was necessary  to bring such a difficult special effects script to life.  As in  ""Noah's Ark"" and ""Leprechauns"", the effects were  top-notch, surprisingly sophisticated for television.  I also thought the  casting worked well.  I particularly liked Kimberly Williams, Scott Cohen,  and John Larroquette (though I'm not typically a Larroquette fan).  It's  difficult in a short feature film to draw a story that has depth and  weight, that really pulls you in like a good, long book.  ""The 10th  Kingdom"" does that.  I haven't been as emotionally involved in a  series since ""I, Claudius"".  I'm 37 and a big reader.  My  step-daughter, who's 7, loved it just as much as I did.  If ""the 10th  Kingdom"" can please both of *us*, you'll probably like it too.",952473600,5,1837,5.040404040404041
1083376,5,6305818282,"This was a wonderful movie!  It held my usually non-television watching body spellbound to NBC all 5 nights.  The characters are well defined, the relationship just terrific, and the special effects breathtaking!  I think  that the Singing ring was the best part!  I will not regret watching it.  I  also will admit that I now have a crush on Wolf!

7895591,5,6305818282,"I have very few things that I remain a dedicated life-long fan of, but 'The 10th Kingdom' will always be at the top of that very short list.  I first saw it when it originally aired on NBC back in February and March of 2000, and it's stayed with me ever since.  Ten hours long (including commercials at the time), it wasn't dubbed 'The Epic Mini-Series Event' for nothing.

The story is set two hundred years after the ending of the fairy tales that we're all familiar with, but we find that 'happily ever after didn't last as long as we'd hoped.'  The evil step-mother to the grandson of Snow White plots to overthrow the entire fairy tale world, and the only ones who can stop her are a father and daughter from New York City.  There are plenty of nods, parallels, and throwbacks to familiar fairy tales and nursery rhymes, as well as all manner of fantasy creatures from trolls to goblins to elves.

But 'The 10th Kingdom' is not merely another movie for children.  While it's certainly family-friendly, it's actually more of a 'fairy tale for adults.'  Simon Moore has written a wonderfully rich and sophisticated story that examines life and our place in the world around us.  Are fate and destiny truly the rulers of all things, or do we ultimately have the final say in what happens to us?  The characters are multi-dimensional and complex, and are never as clearly defined as just 'hero' or 'villain,' 'good' or 'bad.'  They are constantly faced with decisions of morality and doing what is right over what is easy (or what they want/would rather do), and they have to face the consequences of their actions.  The threads of responsibility and family are woven intricately throughout the entire series.

And that's actually where the mini-series format allows 'The 10th Kingdom' to shine.  While it could have easily been made as a standard theatrical film, or even just a two-part T.V. movie, the decision to opt for the mini-series format gives 'The 10th Kingdom' the attention and care that it deserves.  The story is not rushed, nor does it feel at any point like it drags across the long run-time.  The unfolding of the plot is well-paced throughout the five episodes and feels completely organic.  The characters (well-played by actors such as Dianne Wiest, Scott Cohen, John Larroquette, and Kimberly Williams-Paisely, just to name but a few) grow and evolve as people in a very believable and real way that would have been stunted or forced in any other time format.  You care about these characters, and will both cheer and cry for them by the end.

The production value is also high.  The bulk of 'The 10th Kingdom' was shot on-location throughout the U.K. and Europe, and that lends a sense of scope and reality that never could have been achieved strictly in-studio on a regular television budget.  There's no loss of detail with the costumes, sets, and props, either; and the creature make-up keeps in the tradition of other live action fantasy titles by using prosthetics instead of CGI.  In fact, there's very little use of CGI in the entire mini-series.  Opting for mostly practical effects over the computer actually allowed for what little CGI there is to be worked on and refined to the point where it could be integrated into the film in such a realistic way that it's almost completely unnoticeable.  Despite having been made in 1999, the computer effects in 'The 10th Kingdom' actually hold up much better than some of the big-budget studio films that have been released during the past decade (such as Marvel Studios' 'The Incredible Hulk').

It's impossible to give 'The 10th Kingdom' a worthy review that properly does it justice, due to the sheer epic scope of the piece: from the story to the characters to the score by Anne Dudley, and every aspect of production in-between.  But it has endured for eighteen years due to its high quality and engaging story, and it's a thrill to finally see it back thanks to streaming services and the recently released Blu-Ray.  'The 10th Kingdom' will never disappoint.",1524960000,,4041,4.76867816091954
