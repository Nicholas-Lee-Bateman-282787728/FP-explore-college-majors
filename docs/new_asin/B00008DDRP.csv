7981910,4,B00008DDRP,"I thought about buying this for some time to use in my classroom since my seniors read the play, but I get so sick of having to buy my own curriculum materials only to find that the kids do not appreciate or understand the work any better. That was not the case here. They liked it a lot and really understood the play much better.",1402617600,6,331,4.107692307692307
7981911,5,B00008DDRP,"This was a great production when it first aired and it stands the test of time. The DVD picture quality is fantastic. Great acting, great sets and costumes. I use it for Theatre History and Period Styles classes.",1397865600,3,212,4.605263157894737
7981912,5,B00008DDRP,I pity the kid who picks this up in lieu of Cliffs Notes. Several scenes have been excised. Or rewritten. Or placed in different sequence.,1361145600,2,138,4.56
7981913,4,B00008DDRP,"A crisp production negotiated with wit and flair, this delicious confection offers a tantilizing glimpse of the mores and manners of Sheridan's 18th century England.  Guided with a sure hand by Michael Langham and Nick Havinga, this handsome production is well paced, wittily acted, and far worthier than the sneering commentary of the reviewers below would have you believe.",1173916800,14,375,5.3559322033898304
7981914,1,B00008DDRP,"This Broadway Theatre Archive production took one of the wittiest, most sparkling 18th-century comedies--and ruined it.  The costumes are intentionally absurd (think Beach Blanket Babylon), the acting is way over-the-top-camp, and the incidental music could not be worse.  The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century.  The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.

I like ""The School for Scandal"" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production.  But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn't ever sit through this one again.

The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what?  Anyone who actually likes this play will be revolted by this DVD.",1139875200,38,974,4.761904761904762
7981915,2,B00008DDRP,"Classic drawing room comedy, period piece. Cleverly written in a time when the audience needed a bit of a nudge to figure out each character. Each person's name describes how you should feel about each! Charming idea from the 1700's. If you've never had a chance to see one of these comedies, take a look. This is a famous play and well done. Must see for theatre students.",1125792000,6,373,4.5
