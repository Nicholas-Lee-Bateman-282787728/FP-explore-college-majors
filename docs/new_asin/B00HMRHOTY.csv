8633616,3,B00HMRHOTY,"NOTE: This is a one disc version of the previously released 3 disc set featuring only the documentary & bonus extras that were included on the first disc of the original set.

The 1980's is known to most people as the ""BOOM"" period of professional wrestling with Vince McMahon taking his WWF promotion worldwide resulting in crossover appeal into different forms of entertainment media never before seen along various territories in the National Wrestling Alliance expanding in popularity to the point where some of them broke off into their own individual promotions achieving a level of success with the biggest promotion in Jim Crockett Promotions attempting a national expansion of their own, and some of the biggest crowds in wrestling history including a worldwide indoor attendance record.  Now this is one of those documentaries that we've seen on various projects such as the ones on superstars of the 90's & 2000's where where certain wrestlers are selected and their important moments of the 1980's are profiled with ""Mean"" Gene Okerland hosting this set.  It should also be noted that at this time the only footage WWE owned besides their own was WCW (and all the territories that the promotion evolved from) and AWA so key figures & footage from other promotions such as WCCW, Mid-South/UWF, CWFH, and other territories are not on this set.

Superstars & profile highlights include:
Bobby Heenan - His time in the AWA, involvement in WrestleMania I & III, The Bobby Heenan Family, ""Weasel"", Gorilla Monsoon & Prime Time Wrestling, The Bobby Heenan Show

Junkyard Dog - His universal appeal & popularity breaking racial barriers, his ""juke"" dance, ""Grab Them Cakes"", his time in WCW/NWA, his death, Hall Of Fame.

Sgt. Slaughter - How he got into the business, becoming Sgt. Slaughters, time in the AWA & NWA, his Alley Fight with Pat Patterson, feud with Iron Sheik, his heel run in '91, Hall Of Fame

Greg Valentine - 2nd generation wrestlers, NWA career, Dog Collar Match vs. Piper at Starrcade, WWE Intercontinental & Tag Team Championships, Hall Of Fame

Roddy Piper - Setting a record in his first match, first big break, relationship with Ric Flair, ability to talk, Dog Collar Match vs. Greg Valentine at Starrcade, War To Settle The Score & WrestleMania I, feud with Mr. T, Piper's Pit, Hall Of Fame

Bonus matches also include the Starrcade 83 Dog Collar Match between Roddy Piper vs. Greg Valentine, Sgt. Slaughter vs. Iron Sheik from MSG, Intercontinental Champion Greg Valentine vs. Tito Santana in a Lumberjack Match, Junkyard Dog vs. Randy Savage in the finals of the Wrestling Classic tournament, and Ultimate Warrior vs. Bobby Heenan in a Weasel Suit Match from MSG.

Now the profiles themselves were good as they pretty much ran a summary of their influences or highlights of their career of the 80's & beyond with some profiles going into more details than others.  However the big negative here is that with this one disc set, you don't get all the profiles as they were spread across all three disc of the original set & with the original set being close to a decade old, you could probably find it used or a heavily discounted price to get all the profiles & other extras including matches.  In the end, overall it was a nice presentation on the superstars showcased here but I would recommend finding the the entire 3 disc set unless your only interested in the names listed on this one disc version.",1396569600,,3435,4.863013698630137
