174362,4,0982056737,"Let me start by saying that I'm totally on board with the message of this documentary. I attend a family-integrated church and firmly believe that there's a serious problem with the entire concept of age-segregated ministry. Likewise, I recommend that every Christian take the time to watch this film. That said, I have a few quibbles that I will address below.

REVIEW: The film opens with Ken Ham painting a sobering picture about the state of Christian youth. Quoting statistics and experiences, the film makers clearly show that an alarming number of young people are leaving the church. The rest of the film is dedicated to diagnosing that problem and suggesting a remedy.

The film then goes around interviewing different people. The film maker talks to young Christians and questions them on basic doctrine and Christian living. As expected, the answers are not reassuring. He then proceeds to suggest that the Church's current approach youth mentorship is inherently flawed as fails to put the responsibilities of discipleship on fathers. Several men are interviewed to support this position. Notable among them are Paul Washer, Voddie Baucham, Doug Wilson, Scott Brown and R.C. Sproul, Jr. The films end with a challenge for Christians to defy the current trends and do things biblically.

A QUIBBLE: Again, I agree with the premise of the film. I think they have their finger on pulse of the American church's youth culture. However, I think they shot themselves in the foot by not showing the other side. While the film does interview one proponent of youth minister and a few youth groupers, they're pretty much straw men. In other words, the film makers pit intellectual Bible scholars against some teenagers and a rather crude women with a bad makeup job. In doing so, many proponents of the status quo method, rather than being ""converted"", will likely be offended by the unfair portrayal. Rule number one in polemics is to always portray your opponent in the best possible light so that they will take you seriously when you raise objections.

As it is, I wouldn't recommend this movie as a robust defense of the FIC movement. However, I would recommend it as a launching pad to get people to confront the issue and maybe start a conversation. Scott Brown's book, ""A Weed in the Church"", does a more thorough job of presenting the FIC case.",1329782400,2,2356,4.926952141057934
174363,5,0982056737,"I watched this for free on the movie's home page, and found it be a wonderful documentary. It delivers a great introduction into the idea of youth ministries being more harmful than helpful.  My personal opinion of youth ministry has been evolving over time and I have come to this same conclusion.  An interesting point is brought up in the movie about one of the problems being that many families have given up their responsibility to teach their children, and handed it over to the youth ministry.  And in actuality, it really needs to be turned back toward the family's responsibility to train up their own children.

Deut 6:5-7  "" You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.""

I also really appreciate the argument that children should be in the church with their family during service.  I wholeheartedly agree.

Great movie. I think everyone should watch it.  :)",1329609600,,1163,4.526315789473684
174364,4,0982056737,"A new documentary DVD sponsored by The National Center for Family-Integrated Churches, is beginning to make some waves. ""Divided: Is Modern Youth Ministry Multiplying or Dividing the Church?"" explores the pitfalls and problems of how we've done church for the last thirty to forty years (and more).

I found the DVD thought provoking and definitely worth my time in watching. Age segregation is a new concept in the church, and has only been around in the last hundred years or more. There is a strong argument to be made that it has contributed to many of the problems in the church.

The documentary interviews current youth ministry gurus, youth ministers with misgivings, and former youth ministers. Also included are interviews of church leaders in the Family-Integrated movement such as Douglas Phillips, Scott Brown, and Voddie Baucham, Jr. as well as other leaders less known for their preference for Family-Integrated churches, like R.C. Sproul, Jr., Ken Ham and Paul Washer.

The movie itself flows at a nice pace, tracing the investigation of Philip Leclerc into the problems surrounding youth ministry in the church. The filming is superb and well-planned, interesting shots abound. The setting of the interviews also are visually appealing and the whole movie is a great production. The Leclrerc brothers criss-cross the country interviewing leaders and digging into this problem.

Still, after all the interviews and the questions have been presented, I don't think the case against modern youth ministry is as fool proof as the documentary claims. At our church, children age 5 and up sit with us in the worship service and that alone contrasts with what many churches do. We have age segregated Sunday School classes, but also foster a unity in spirit throughout the church cross-generationally. More could be done though. And just opening eyes to the questions in this debate can make a big impact.

I recommend you take the time to watch Divided. You may want to pick up a copy of the movie to have it in your library and show it to your church leaders. Learn more about Divided at DividedtheMovie.com. You can purchase a copy of this movie direct from the movie's website, or through Amazon.com.",1311552000,3,2214,5.038251366120218
174365,2,0982056737,"This movie is a documentary made in conjunction with the National Center for Family Integrated Churches. The views expressed in this film come directly from this organization. I believe that they are correct that something has gone terribly wrong with modern youth ministry. The first third of the program documents that well. However, the difficulty that I have with the film has to do with the solutions it offers.

The first major problem is the reasoning from history. The film points out similarities between modern age specific education and the teachings of Darwin, Plato, Rousseau, and Dewey, and thus, they conclude that modern age specific education is pagan in origin. However, the Bible itself has similarities to the Gilgamesh Epic [the flood story], the Egyptian Memphite theology, the Baal epic, and the pagan rituals at Emar. According to the logic of the film, that must mean that the Bible is pagan in origin.

Worse than that, I am deeply concerned about some of the ambiguous language that was used in the film. As someone who is studying to be an exegete and who also is interested in linguistics, I was annoyed at the gross oversimplifications of those interviewed in this film. The first example was the constant harping that the only examples you can find in the Bible of education is age integrated. First of all, that is something we don't know, as many times the Bible does not even mention the ages of the people in the crowds. Worse than that, the argument makes no sense, because one can also find no example of people collecting water with anything but a bucket in the Bible. Does that mean that the pipes that bring water inside our house are sin because they are breaking with the Biblical pattern? You will also find that all instances of the Lord's Supper in the Bible are a full meal. Does that mean that it is sin to only have bread and wine, because it violates the ""Biblical"" pattern?

The problem is that the term ""Biblical"" is ambiguous. For example, the other day I found a humorous anecdote called ""Ten Biblical ways to find a Wife."" The first was, ""Find a prostitute and marry her"" [Hosea 1:1-3]. The second was, ""Purchase a piece of property, and get a woman as part of the deal"" [Ruth 4:5-10]. Now, are these ways ""Biblical?"" Yes. However, would anyone seriously suggest that you can't find a wife in any other manner than the way the characters in the Bible did? Some of them, such as Samson, found a wife sinfully. Yet, there is a sense in which what Samson did is a ""Biblical"" way to find a wife.

That is why I wholly believe that the issue is one of pragmatics and not one of semantics. The issue is, ""What is the Bible intending to do with its language?"" Of course, this gets us into elements of speech act theory, and deals thus with, not what the Bible says semantically, but what the Bible intends to accomplish by saying what it says. For example, just recently there was an accidental death at Texas Rangers game where someone fell over a fence to his death. Last year, a man fell from the upper deck into the lower deck in that same stadium. Just recently, the stadium has increased the height of its railings in order to prevent that from happening again.

However, I have to ask whether such an action is Biblical. Where in the Bible do you find sufficiently high railings at the edge of the upper deck of a baseball stadium? There are no baseball stadiums or upper decks in the Bible. However, there is another sense in which having sufficiently high railings *is* biblical. Take a look at the following passage:

Deuteronomy 22:8 ""When you build a new house, you shall make a parapet for your roof, so that you will not bring bloodguilt on your house if anyone falls from it [NASB].

Now, one might immediately object that we are talking about a baseball stadium, and not a house. Also, they might object that we are talking about the upper deck and not the roof. However, what is this law trying to accomplish? Most people will recognize that this law is seeking to protect human life from accidental death. Hence, it would apply, not only to the roofs of houses, not only to the upper decks of baseball stadiums, but also to things like amusement park ride inspections.

However, are amusement park ride inspections and railings at the edge of the upper deck ""Biblical?"" In a sense yes, and in a sense no. I would argue that we have the same thing with Sunday schools and youth groups. What we have in the Bible is the command for churches to teach. The point of such a command is to get churches to teach those under its authority, including children. Hence, youth groups and Sunday schools are an application of the command for the church to teach, in the same way that amusement park ride inspections and railings around the edge of the upper deck are applications of the command to protect human life from accidental death. So, in a sense they are Biblical, and in a sense they are not.

The problem here is a basic confusion of meaning [the church must teach] and significance [the church should therefore set up youth groups and Bible studies in order to teach]. The dangerous things about this confusion is that, if the significance of a text must be limited to what is specifically laid out in scripture, it will result in syncretism, because the significance can never go beyond the text itself.  We would have to speak in the pronounciation of ancient Hebrew, wear robes of animal skin, make houses of fired brick, eat only foods that you would find in the Bible, etc. All other things must logically be ""unbiblical.""",1311206400,8,5591,4.6156941649899395
174366,2,0982056737,"Summary
The movie was fifty minutes long. The producer, Mr. LeClerk, takes the viewer on a grim journey into the heart of youth ministries. He interviews church kids, youth ministry experts, statisticians, and pastors.

In an ever-spiraling descent into marketing madness, the film ably portrays the deep-seated pragmatism of the teenagers and their would-be pied-pipers. One youth leader bluntly told the camera that the youth did not need more Biblical truth but more practical things, more relationships, more fun.

Mr. LeClerk then ""discovers the shockingly sinister roots of modern, age-segregated church programs..."" The roots do not begin with Mr. Raikes of late eighteenth-century England but with Plato and Rousseau. And even more, there is no biblical precedent for such programs. Therefore, the solution is to tear down the entire youth ministry--branch, root and all.

To rescue a lost generation it will take churches and families following the Word of God. Churches should stop usurping parental responsibilities. And parents should take back their God-given duty to train and nurture their own children. This will rescue the next generation.

Analysis
The movie was created in conjunction with the National Center for Family Integrated Churches (NCFIC). The president of this organisation, Mr. Brown, figures predominately in the movie.

The photography, mood and music were spot-on. This is obviously a professionally made film. The pacing was good. Its presentation was not over-the-top or in-your-face, but subtle and dramatic. Aesthetically, the movie deserves full marks.

But presentation aside, what of the content? Given the applause at the end of the Friday night showing in Denver, it grabbed the audience. Setting the problem up with multiple teen-interviews, peppered with real-time video of Christian ""rock concerts,"" LeClerk masterfully guides the audience through the entertainment-minded youth ministries of today.

This is a serious problem. Children, teenagers and youth alike are baptized in a sea of childish entertainment all for the sake of ""relevance."" If the statistics are only partially accurate, they are astounding enough. Too many youth are leaving the church.

And the parental problem is equally heinous: too many parents feel godly sending their children off to youth camp while neglecting family worship, home discipleship and basic doctrinal fidelity. Added to this problem are too many churches willing to accept the status quo.

In fact, a Pew study shows 57% of confessing Evangelicals deny that Christ is the only way to heaven. Barna numbers suggest that being a homeschooler is no sure defense either: half of those polled believe that salvation is not by faith alone.

Although the show does a good job presenting the youth problem, it misses the wider context of that problem. With such wide-spread doctrinal ignorance, is it any wonder the youth leave the shallow churches?

Unfortunately, the history section leaves much to be desired. Pointing out that Plato wished to send children to the state schools is not the same as proving this as the intellectual source of today's age-segregation. The omission of the fact that the Reformers and Puritans practiced age-segregation is another problem.

What of the solution: to demolish youth ministries and incorporate family discipleship?

The solution is wonderful...if understood correctly. But proper understanding cannot come from the movie since it leaves out important pieces of information. For instance, Mr. Brown believes there are times and occasions for the family to be separated (see his book, A Weed in the Church). Likewise, Mr. Phillips thinks there are times to speak to teenagers as teenagers.

In other words, the rhetoric of the movie would forbid any and all age-segregation. When in actuality the leading proponents have a more nuanced position. If the film were twenty-minutes long this lack of nuance could be tolerated.

What family discipleship entails was lightly touched upon. But the proper role of the church was not clearly articulated. In contrast, Mr. Brown's book helpfully clarifies that the pastors and laymen have a role in the life of the youth.

Overall, the movie delivers the content and delivers it well. The problem is that the content is one-sided. There is a youth problem but there is a larger problem of Gospel ignorance. It would be better to read the book, but at least the movie will challenge Christians to rethink the role of youth ministries.",1308787200,15,4499,5.342291371994342

7795048,2,0982056737,"Back in the day, I was a big fan of the kind of thinking contained in this documentary, but it says a lot that even back then I could find some problems with the execution. It's all the more clear to me now.

This movie attempts to present the viewpoint that any sort of ministry that separates ages, e.g. most of modern youth ministry, is destructive and unbiblical. It does a good job showing that there's clearly something wrong with youth ministry today, but does it prove its specific point? Not really. It gets distracted by side issues like the supposed horrible worldliness of Christian rock and supposed necessity of young-earth Creationism. Worst of all, it claims there's lots of biblical support for its viewpoint without ever actually showing it. I think there's a special feature that advises you to look in some book or study guide for the biblical support. In the end, it does show a disease, but fails to provide proof that its cure will be effective.

If you're really interested in this subject, Scott Brown's A Weed in the Church book is much better than this documentary, though in the end I would treat it with a bit of suspicion, as it tends to have a bit of a paternalistic and legalistic flair. There's nothing wrong with family-integrated churches, in fact I currently attend one, but requiring it from a rather legalistic basis is something I would be wary of.",1441584000,,1387,4.680327868852459

Have we even looked at where they spend most of their time? Family, school, playing video game? This film is good that it promotes the value of families but does a poor job of placing ALL the blame on youth ministry. Members of the church should step up here too.

7795055,3,0982056737,"Let's be clear.  Divided is not the sort of film I typically review on this site.  For starters, it is a documentary, which greatly reduces the likelihood that it will have any measurable impact on the greater society as a whole.  Even the best, Oscar-winning documentaries barely move the needle on the cultural Richter scale.  Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, Divided is a documentary that calls into question one of the most sacred cows of contemporary Christian culture: youth ministry.  So while certain church leaders may be prone to watch for the sake of gleaning a few truths, the chances that this might be seen by large segments of the Church body are infinitesimally small.

Nevertheless, is Divided worth seeing?  Sadly, I have to offer a bit of a mixed review.  On the upside, the documentarian, Philip Leclerc, is asking a set of questions that desperately need to be asked in light of the sobering statistics related to young adults abandoning the church.  There is a clearly a problem in the way that many within the church are approaching youth ministry.  In their fervor to retain the kids, it would seem that many are more interested in creating a carnival atmosphere with hipster pastors than they are in teaching the time-honored truths of Scripture to a generation that is desperately famished for spiritual nourishment.  So for the courage it takes to question this contemporary methodology, I applaud Leclerc for his stand.  Moreover, I applaud him for some of the counter-cultural conclusions he reaches, as they are worthy of consideration.

Having said that, it would seem that Philip Leclerc has seen a few too many Michael Moore style documentaries.  And what I mean by that is that he in no way attempts to present this issue in a fair and balanced manor.  In support of his seemingly pre-ordained conclusions, he lines up a cadre of notable leaders such as: Ken Hamm, Voddie Bauchman, and Scott Brown.  As their counterparts, he offers up a motley assortment of teenagers including a multi-pierced girl whose mohawk won't stay up because she's been in the ""mosh pit"" at a local Christian rock concert.  And it's this pervasive sense of imbalance that ultimately prevents this documentary from being a truly noteworthy look into this critical issue.
