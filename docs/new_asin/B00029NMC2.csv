8175559,4,B00029NMC2,"Great movie from Argentina about two friends who dream of a better life, but turn to criminal activity to realize that dream. Really nice friendship movie, with some surreal touches and fantasy sequences. I only subtracted a star due to the dvd transfer, which is unfortunately 4x3 fullscreen, the shape of the older tv's. But I'm happy that this rare title is available at all.",1452816000,,378,4.8307692307692305
