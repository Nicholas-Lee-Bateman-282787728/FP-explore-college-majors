5708754,5,B00CA4S024,"Warner Archive is true to their word, Volume Two is right on schedule. Believe me the prints here look EXCELLENT! It seems all the films are from 35mm prints. The Bowery Boys films have changed hands several times. The last time was when Warner Brothers bought the television rights back in the early 1970's. Most prints are several generations away from the camera negatives, yet this collection looks beautiful. Even ""Spook Busters"" (which has always been a problem) looks better than ever.

An extra bonus is having ""The Bowery Boys Meet the Monsters"" & ""High Society"" in their original 1.85 Scope versions! It's an absolute joy!

Support Warner Archive, and get this set. BRING ON VOLUME THREE!!!",1366156800,56,700,4.9743589743589745

5708797,5,B00CA4S024,"As I've mentioned in my reviews of the first and fourth volumes of the collection, I believe disclaimers for inflammatory content, interviews and commentaries by fans, researchers and surviving cast and crew should've been included. However it sure is nice to have these films in such well remastered condition, I am grateful to WB for this.

It is sometimes hard to believe that these films were done during times that included Japan's occupation by US forces, mainland China going communist, Stalin spinning out of control, John Nash losing his beautiful mind at Princeton, the Korean War, the second biggest G.I. Bill payout in history, Joe McCarthy and television making the kind of economic and cultural inroads that the internet is making today.  So much fear and suspicion spread around, so much on the verge of dramatic, painful change, no wonder folks went to the movies in droves to see the Boys.

And with so much growing up as the changes right through today have forced upon us, no wonder we still love these homies. In a 1982 interview, a young David Letterman asked a 62 year old Huntz Hall if they could've reached a point where he and the gang would've been too old to go on playing the Kids, and Huntz flatly replied 'No.' He said deep down we are all kids, and the skill is in the performer's ability to connect with that 'kid'. You listen to Huntz and you find out why Leo liked and respected him so much on and off camera. I'd pay double for this collection if they included interviews like that one.

My favorites in this set are Clipped Wings, where sharp dressed Sach keeping step with the lady troops in his spit shined shoes is beautiful to behold, Loose in London, where I marveled at the sights from over 50 years ago and where Sach's London facts kept me busy on Wikipedia / Britannica / Fodor's London for days, and Hold That Line, which I SWEAR had to have been a large part of the inspiration for the 1983 film Trading Places. I didn't expect cast other than the Boys in The Bowery Boys Meet the Monsters to crack me up so much but that's what happened. That film is just plain funny, my favorite line from that is Sach's 'Say hello to your uncle.'

Here's what I'm into singing now, thanks to Bowery Buckaroos: ""Oh Louieeeee, don't you worry 'bout us, if the ol' jalop don't make it we'll be home on a bus.'

So I'm recommending already!",1413590400,4,2370,4.53864168618267

5708812,4,B00CA4S024,"The Bowery Boys,Vol#2 starts out with their feature Spook Busters(Aug/46)and ends with High Society(April/55).Like Vol#1,this release while in order movie wise,has tremendous gaps throughout. They couldn't have just released the first 12 in Vol#1,the next 12 in Vol#2 and so on. Nooooo,that's too easy I guess. Why Warner's did it this way,I will never know. Don't you ever accuse Warners of being smart,I won't stand for it. Sit yes,but stand no.
The big fault in this and the other sets is the condition of the prints. Very little to nothing has been done to bring these films up to any kind of proper standard. They are all filled with unnecessary defects and artifacts connected to films of this age,which could/should have been taken care of if remastered properly. The print qualities run from poor to less than average to good.
There are some really funny laugh out loud films in this release. They are all best enjoyed with friends and families present. They were  originally,in theaters.
The films from the beginning to the early 50s are all full screen,but the later ones are w/s,which I have never seen before.
All in all while the prints are less than stellar,the films themselves are an absolute joy to watch. It is entertainment for the whole family that you'll want to watch again and again.",1400803200,4,1306,4.882882882882883

The third and final volume has a number of episodes after Leo Gorcey's uncle banard died after making dig that uranium, and later he left the group leaving "" Sach"" Huntz Hall left to carry on the Bowery Boys tradition. A time when comedy was strictly something funny to laugh at.  These are made to order from Warner Bros. Vault made from their original film stock, digitally restored.

5708830,4,B00CA4S024,"Decent transfer quality and good selection of relatively rare films in this volume, especially THE BOWERY BOYS MEET THE MONSTERS, the most commercially successful film in the series. Recommended as a ""must have"" to fans of the Bowery Boys.",1389312000,,239,5.153846153846154
5708831,5,B00CA4S024,"Being a big fan of the Bowery Boys' movies, I was very happy to see that Warner Brothers finally released their films on DVD in 2013.  Admittedly, their movies only average around 65 minutes or so, and some movies are funnier than others.  However, it's remarkable that the Bowery Boys made 48 good to great movies in 12 years, which averages out to one movie every three months!  Volume Two has my favorite film, ""The Bowery Boys Meet The Monsters"" (1954).  In addition to the usual slapstick and Slip's malapropisms, it includes two mad scientists, a sexy female vampire, a butler named Grissom (who they keep calling Gruesome), a robot that keeps losing its head, a gorilla, and a crazy old lady (Ellen Corby) who keeps a man-eating plant as a pet.

Volume Two also includes two of their better films, ""Spook Busters"" (1946), and ""Ghost Chasers"" (1951).  The video and audio qualities of the movies are very good.  Before I heap too much praise on Warner Brothers, I have some bones to pick with them.  The movies were not released in chronological order.  There are no extras - no animated menus, no chapter stops, no commentaries, no theatrical trailers, no descriptions of the movies, and no bonus features of any kind.  After waiting all these years, I think they could have put more effort into their releases.  Still, the release of these movies is cause for celebration.  The good news regarding the twelve unreleased Bowery Boys' movies can be summed up on the back of the Volume Three DVD.  ""Slip, Sach, Duke and the boys will be back for another round in Volume 4.""  That will help make 2014 a very good year!",1388361600,,1622,4.665492957746479
5708832,4,B00CA4S024,"Yes, these are the best prints we've seen, but that doesn't mean they're great.  Contrast is very poor, even in some daytime scenes.  But if you're mainly interested in the content, I've come to the seclusion that you should be happy with these movies.",1386547200,,252,4.704545454545454
5708833,5,B00CA4S024,Finally we are seeing the entire Bowery Boys series get released on DVD. They located the best possible prints for the transfers and did a good job of cleaning up the sound and picture on them. Each movie is crisp and bright with good sound unlike many of low quality collections we have seen of them in the past. These are the classic Bowery Boys films we watched for years on Saturday Afternoon. Volume two picks up where one left off. 12 more more classic films on 4 DVDs. Just simple packaging a standard DVD case that houses the 4 movies. But hey who cares we are buying these for the movies not the packaging. I will highly recommend you grab this high quality set while they are available.,1383782400,2,696,4.403100775193798
5708834,5,B00CA4S024,"My husband has a passion for the old Bowery Boys movies. He was really impressed with this volume and says it's ""better than the originals."" It arrived in a timely fashion, safely and carefully packaged. Thank you!",1383609600,,214,4.8108108108108105
5708835,5,B00CA4S024,"The Bowery Boys are part of my growing up so it was something that I would always wish would come back to television. Thankfully, with the video industry becoming what it is, they are now on DVD. This was always part of my Sundays and now once again they are part of my Sunday morning. I watch just one episode each Sunday, because that is the way it used to be. And I don't want to get through all of them too quickly. I also have the Dead End Kids so I have my complete library of Slip and the gang. Even when he went by the name of Muggs.",1380499200,,541,3.9272727272727272
5708836,5,B00CA4S024,"As a Bowery Boys, East Side Kids fan since my youth, this collection was awesome! Rarely do I laugh out loud at anything I see on TV or movies, but with the Bowery Boys, I have actually had to pause the DVD because I was laughing too hard to see the screen. ""Clipped Wings""...I am giggling now at just typing the title. This is true comedy, clean, fresh, funny, and ageless. If you are new to the B Boys I would suggest learning something of the history before watching. Much of it was pure improvisation, the boys rarely stuck to the script. Leo Gorcey was the master of improv and this series will show that. Pair him with Huntz Hall and it's pure magic. I never tire of these DVDs.",1377820800,11,684,4.269230769230769

5708848,5,B00CA4S024,It was great to see these films again. Used to watch them on Sundays and now I can watch them over and over without missing a moment . Am looking forward to Volumes 3 & 4.,1376697600,4,171,3.7777777777777777
5708849,5,B00CA4S024,"So glad I ordered BOTH volumes at the same time!  The seller is one of the BEST I have ordered from and the movies came in a matter of a few days.
Quality is superb for such old prints and I received the pressed version of Vol 2 as well.
WB has done a great job considering the masters were not in that great shape.
Until the remaining 24 movies are released, I will have to fill in the blanks with the 'bootlegs' I ordered back in 2008 which cost me in excess of $200!
Watching bootlegs is better than nothing at all until WB releases the other 24.
Along with the East Side Kids, the Bowery Boys remain classics to be enjoyed over and over again.
Let's hope WB bumps up further releases so we can all enjoy these classic B movies!
I cannot recommend The Bowery Boys Vols 1 and 2 highly enough for a slice of what things were life when I was in elementary school in the early 1950s!  AND the price is right.",1375660800,8,907,4.089887640449438

5708851,5,B00CA4S024,"Most adventures begin in Louie's Sweet Shop in the Bowery district of lower Manhattan.  Louis Dumbrowski is the shop's owner;  he is short in stature but big in heart.  He has a special affection for his regulars - the Bowery Boys may not spend much but they certainly can make a shop keeper's life interesting.

The boys - actually young men - are led by Terrence Aloysius (Slip) Mahoney;  he is a natural-born leader.  He doesn't have a high education, but he works hard at trying to impress everyone with his knowledge of big words.  Unfortunately, the words he uses may sound right, but they are often the wrong words - in ""Ghost Chaser"", when Louie faints, Slip suggests to the guys, ""Maybe you ought to give him a little artificial 'perspiration'!""

Slip's main man is the very funny Horace Debussy Jones (a.k.a. Sach).  He approaches everything with a child-like innocence and wonder.  He is a natural-born ham - hamming it up with exaggerated animation.  He can easily slip into a make-believe state - in ""Clipped Wings"" he fantasizes that he is a pilot while he sits on a 10 cent-a-ride mechanical airplane.

Usually there are 3 or 4 others in the gang - most recognizable is Whitey, who appears only in the first six films.

Overall:  This is a great set of funny films dating from 1946 to 1955:
""Spook Busters"",  ""Hard Boiled Mahoney"",  ""Bowery Buckaroos"",
""Smuggler's Cove"",  ""Ghost Chasers"",  ""Let's Go Navy!"",
""Hold That Line"",  ""Loose in London"",  ""Clipped Wings"",
""Private Eyes"",  ""The Bowery Boys Meet the Monsters"", and ""High Society"".

Print quality is far superior to what has been previously available to collectors. The asking price is also generous when compared with single movie purchases. Viewers with a nostalgic streak will enjoy the antics of Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall and the rest of the boys  as much as I did. I first saw these pictures in syndication on Australian television  during the mid sixties as a pre-schooler. English was my second language then so you  may imagine my confusion as Gorcey continuosly mangled the language I would soon adopt when commencing school.
