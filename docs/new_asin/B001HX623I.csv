3645581,4,B001HX623I,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this video, but I ended up enjoying it very much from start to finish.  It consists of four short films of varying lengths.  Every one is well-conceived, well-executed, and well-acted, with professional-level production.  Each in its own way, the four shorts all have something to do with coming of age or coming to terms with a gay sexual orientation but in very different ways.",1384646400,,413,4.788732394366197
3645582,2,B001HX623I,"it was not what I expected for a gay themed movie. IMO, it seemed more STR8 than gay, in theme. Also, why is it that a gay character or a gay themed movie, must always end  being unresolved or immersed with tragic overtones?  Hey, being gay is a very positive experience for those of us who are, and we do have fulfilling livers with happy endings; riding offf into the sunset with your lover, in anticipation of a wild night of sex!",1382486400,,433,4.2682926829268295
3645583,5,B001HX623I,PRETTY GOOD SHORT STORIES! I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE IT HAD MANNY MONTANA IN IT FROM THE NEW HIT SHOW #GRACELAND (WHICH IS AWESOME BY THE WAY...LOL ) BUT BACK TO THIS THE STORIES MADE SENSE AND WERE PRETTY GOOD....,1375574400,,210,4.410256410256411
3645584,4,B001HX623I,My favorite was the first one. They are all well acted. I chose it because it was raining outside but didn't want anything too involved. This was perfect.,1370044800,,154,4.535714285714286
3645585,4,B001HX623I,These are for the most part successful short films. Ready? OK! has a great story about a mom and son - could be expanded and fleshed out into a longer pieces. El Primo is a good film about hispanic cousins... again I wanted more. Four Degrees is also strong - interesting true premise... made me know what happened next. You can skip the closer Coffee - it's just typical gay drek.,1369008000,3,381,4.380281690140845
3645586,2,B001HX623I,"Amazon keeps asking me to review this film I purchased, but I Don't even remember the movie.  Guess that says it all.",1358899200,,117,4.318181818181818

3645588,2,B001HX623I,"This was a low budget movie.  It wasn't bad enough to make me turn it off, but it wasn't memorable either.  Keep looking-- you can do better",1341705600,,140,4.148148148148148
3645589,5,B001HX623I,"This is such a fun little movie.  I especially love Daniel Marin!  He's refreshing and inspiring, an up and coming actor for sure.  Everyone must see !!!",1251072000,,153,4.592592592592593

8310133,1,B001HX623I,Yuk!! Remove this as soon as possible.......  Not even worth the $1.99.,1439769600,,71,4.916666666666667
8310134,1,B001HX623I,Very amateurish shorts,1439078400,,22,6.666666666666667
8310135,4,B001HX623I,"A decent collection of short stories, in some cases a little too short.",1435968000,,71,4.538461538461538

8310137,2,B001HX623I,"This title was terminally dreary. I almost never post a bad review, but I gotta make an exception with this one.",1432080000,,112,4.380952380952381
8310138,1,B001HX623I,waste of time and money,1426291200,,23,3.8
8310139,5,B001HX623I,Most of the short movies were of a side of being gay that was honestly portrayed.  Happy and fun it was not but if anyone who wants to see the other side of the life style and that it is not all peaches and cream it was very real,1418688000,,229,3.673469387755102
8310140,1,B001HX623I,"GROSS! Get some help fast dude! When a writer and actors have to resort to pedophilia to get 'entertainment', call for help. First, help the children being sexually abused to play such a role! Second, put the writers in jail and get them some counseling fast!",1406678400,,259,4.6521739130434785
8310141,1,B001HX623I,"Not my cup of tea. To me it lacked a plot. Don,t waste money to watch this movie. After only 20 minutes I dumped this movie from my watch list.",1398211200,,143,3.8
8310142,4,B001HX623I,"Sometimes a movie like this is difficult to watch. It can almost feel a little disjointed because each piece is like a moment in time. Saying that, I do remember when boys could not be cheerleaders because it just wasn't done. Never mind the guy was better than all the girls, I am so glad we have gotten beyond some issues; we do have a lot further to go. In particular  I found interesting the young man's visit to the ahhh-- Lady of the Night. Being female and straight this created a new point of view, which lead to greater understanding. I do recommend this film and will watch similar films in the future. I believe we all need to have greater clarity of the world around us.",1390003200,2,682,4.328125
