2825678,3,B000PMFS1Y,"In the early to mid-1970's a novel hit the best sellers list called ""The Happy Hooker.""  It was an autobiography written by Xaviara Hollander in the 1970s and was published by Dell Publications.  It became a Number One Best Seller.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Happy-Hooker-My-Own-Story/dp/0060014164/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Happy Hooker: My Own Story</a>

Xaviara Hollander came from Holland.  She was the daughter of a doctor.  For a time when she first came to the United Stes, she was working as a translator for the United Nations in New York City.

She had been through some failed relationships and soon found herself self-employed and later running a luctrative escort service eventually having a serice on Park Avenue in New York City in the late 1970's.

She had hired a technician to install a series of hidden cameras in the various rooms of her establishment so she can monitor as to what was going on in the rooms in case something should go wrong between the girls and the customers requiring her to intervene.

Unknown to Xaviara Hollander, the technician, however, had installed a transmiter in the cameras so that he could pick up on the transmissions and look in on what was going on.

Thigs backfired as the TV sets of the people in the area were also picking up on the transmissions on the UHF fequency.

Teh police received a number of complaints and located the source of the transmissions.  The New York Police Department then raided the establishment of Xaviera Hollander.  She later was even deported from theUnited States since she was not a citizen.

This made the media, and as a result, Xaviera Halander wrote a book which was published by Dell Publications in the 1970's and became a Number One Best Seller.

The book sarts with Xaviara's place being raided by the police, and then she goes back to how it all began back in her early days in Holland.

The movie version that stared Lynn Redgrave as Xaviara Hollander was turned into a comedy and got paned by the critics at the time for not being true to the book.

The two sequels made were also comedies:  ""The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington"" staring Joey Heatherton as Xaviara Hollander as she and her lawyer played by 'George Hamilton take on a convervative U.S. Senate Committee on morale decency and family values, which aslo has Ray Walston as one of the senators.  The other sequel was ""The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood"" stars Martine Beswick as Xaviara Hollander who takes on the Hollywood machine pitting her wits against Hollywood bad guys played by Aam West and Richard Deacon.

The novel ""The Happy Hooker"":&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Happy-Hooker-My-Own-Story/dp/0060014164/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Happy Hooker: My Own Story</a>

As I said,, the book was a bes seller, but the critics did not like the movie at all.  It was not true to the book at al.  It was turned into a comedy, which the book was not.  The two movies that followed were out and out camp comedies.",1240617600,,3078,5.136546184738956
2825679,3,B000PMFS1Y,"Title ""The Happy Hooker"" is very misleading.

I'm not sure what the director/s were trying to do with this film. Frankly the story was all over the place.

Heck ""Saturday Night Fever"" has more ""ACTION"" shots than this movie. However I am a Lyn Redgrave fan, so I'll say this movie is just SO, SO. Not really worth buying.",1143072000,,321,4.423728813559322
2825680,3,B000PMFS1Y,This movie was a story about a woman who breaks up with her fiance and finds herself in an American city sleeping with many different men.  She deciedes instead of doing it for free she should start charging for her services.  She eventually becomes a madame and ends up in jail.  This is the basis premise for the movie.  There is not much else to this movie.  I found it to be funny.  It was not meant to be a comedy.  I think it was made in the seventies.  It has all sorts of cheese ball outfits. It is the perfect stereotype of a bad 1970 era movie.  The style reminds me of Shaft.,1020038400,5,586,4.0701754385964914

2825683,3,B000PMFS1Y,"This is not nearly as fun as ""The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington"".  This is a minimally entertaining sitcom-like biography of Xaviera Hollander similar to the Brady Bunch to dumb down the humor.",1390348800,,195,4.909090909090909
2825684,4,B000PMFS1Y,"These movies are not going to be transforming one's life. I found them to be campy and basically enjoyed them. My favorite was ""The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood"" which also featured Adam West. There is a scene where the happy hooker skinny dips with Adam. They stand naked on the diving boards and dive in together. I had always thought that Adam was hot. It was great to see Batman bare his buns. Nice.",1375401600,,402,4.445945945945946

2825686,1,B000PMFS1Y,The Happy Hooker series is a lot of vintage fun.  I am out of that era and truly enjoy the actors in these films.  If you are looking for a zesty romp back to the 1960s/70s these films are for you. They are B films with first class leads.  I enjoyed them.,1358294400,,255,3.8653846153846154

2825688,2,B000PMFS1Y,"Joey Heatherton, Martine Beswick, Lynn Redgrave, Adam West and Larry Storch - How can you possibly go wrong with 70's camp of these colossal proportions? Well, somehow it's wrong on EVERY level. Three horrible movies, painfully bad acting, no storylines to speak of, nothing at all to do with the best-selling books, the worst of 70's fashion style, no comedy, no drama, no camp value, and the greatest travesty - no real sex or nudity to keep you in your chair! WTF! I have a high tolerance for the ridiculous, and even I fast-forwarded through all three flicks in spite of loving Joey Heatherton and Martine Beswick. Insulting on every level - avoid this collection of garish crap at all costs.",1282348800,7,696,4.760330578512397
2825689,3,B000PMFS1Y,"This is a not too serious movie collection about a truly talented lady in her field.

The first of the three shows is the best without a doubt. Lynn Redgrave defines the Happy Hooker as a subtly shrewd, business woman with the ability to truly enjoy what she chooses to do. There is none of this poor girl forced to sell herself stuff. Just an, I like this & can make a good living at it portrayal.
Redgrave's acting is never over the top or too innocent, too air-headed or too harsh. The Happy Hooker gets 5 stars.

Happy Hooker goes Washington is the stinker & Joey Heatherton is the stinkee!
She plays this part as if she is giving phone sex to a thirteen year old boy. She never once displays any kind of business savvy or ability to adapt to different personalities. She acts like she is happy as on drugs. 1 star here.

Happy Hooker goes Hollywood has the best cast. Look it up my fingers are tired.

It also has Martine Beswick in the lead role. She is a two time ""Bond Woman"" she is in ""From Russia with Love"" & ""Thunderball"". She happily restores the understated business acumen to the role while also stepping up the sexual aspects. No complaints from me. This is probably the way most people would expect Xaviera Hollander to be portrayed & since I unfortunately have no personal knowledge of the real lady I can't argue. Adam West of Batman fame plays a movie studio executive in an unexpected manner you'll want to see. The Trilogy, OK, you should skip #2 & go from 1 to 3.",1265587200,,1486,4.353790613718411
2825690,5,B000PMFS1Y,"Soy fan de Xaviera Hollander y la primera parte, la basada en el libro, es la nica pelcula buena de ste paquete.  Las otras pelculas son realmente psimas.  La segunda parte es la que se lleva el premio mayor de lo mala que es, la tercera parte es mala, pero la segunda si es el colmo.

Si compran ste DVD piensen que slo estn comprando la primera parte y, que las otras dos son un ""regalo"" que no importa.",1248652800,,405,4.10126582278481
