1862627,5,B00008V5RO,"I believe ""Angel and Avenging Angel"" were absolutely on the money; ""angel III"" not so.  I enjoy watching the first two movies of the series because some of the scenes and some of the music bring back memories of my own time in a big city.  To this day I watch them now and again.  Even though there is violence they are kind of feel good movies.",1318550400,,345,4.119402985074627
1862628,3,B00008V5RO,I have the original trilogy of the Angel movies and wonder why they aren't including the 4th movie in the series...Angel 4: Undercover? It's not a fantastic movie but it's a part of the series none the less and only available on VHS.,1314230400,7,233,4.441860465116279
1862629,5,B00008V5RO,Been looking for a long long time to find this movie.  Amazon made it possible.  Thank you so much.,1251244800,,99,4.157894736842105
1862630,5,B00008V5RO,"Angel was made in and put out in 1984. Angel"" Starring Donna Wilkes- ""Father Murphy""-""Days of Our Lives"". Angel is a Film set today 25 years later is still a smash hit in many homes. Only if they knew! Donna in her 20's Playes a young girl Molly. Molly was left by her parents at a young age. Being Mollet is only 15 has to provide for her self to only sit and wait for dreams to never come true. In fact Molly's world is about to crash in this hit. Molly is a great honor studet by day. Hollywood Hooker by night. As the story sets off Angels friends are being killed one by one. A sick minded killer is on the run. As the girls need there money to support them selves, The more they find them one less firend. Angel""Wilkes"" plays an unforgetable roll in this film. Convincing not only the Killer but herself Enough is Enough! Molly is soon to be turned out by a group of studs at her school. As when you think it couldn't get any worse for Molly & Angels world's are now about to collide. Leaving no room to feel sorry for herself with a killer on the run. Molly turns to help her male cop firend Andrews'Cliff Gorman'. Now it is her chance! Her life! Her will! Will she be the next vitim for the killer""John Diehl"" or will the tables turn and Angel make his last trick not be a treat? I give this film a 10 why cause 25 years later it still somehow sticks with us at home. The audience can relate to the film'd making as it happends in our very own world. Donna Wilkes to play Molly-Angel went on to a private life. However the film set sail for some sequels! However I am not to judge but Angel 2-4 is more of a comedy then Angel 1 With Wilkes. Not to mention the acting then played in Angel 1 By Wilkes and Co-Stars such as:Dick Shawn- Susan Tyrrell-Rory Calhoun & Donna McDaniel is very believeable in part 1. If you have seen the movie you know what I am talking about. If not? & your looking for a reality non stop pumping action, along filled with Donna's Grace and beauty alone will have you stuck to the set. As moving on. far as the remaining sequels? Well if your looking for an early age Betsy Russell""Saw (who is amazing as Jill)"" in tights and a plastic gun then I would say grab the set! As Avenging Angel (Angel 2) is funny-good with a 5 stars from me. As for the set? Don't get disapointed as you go to put 3 in and see Mitzi Capture"" Silk Stalkings"" just not to silky as our next Molly-Angel. With a 3 Stars I say leave the 3 in the box. Last but least Angel had so much to offer as if it were taking in the right steeps. However they were walking with 2 left feet in this case. Angel 4: Undercover- My stars i give it a 1 why? Cause I feel sorry for Donna being degraded by 3 more Mollys-Angel's to be palyed all by differnt woman with horrible rolls. Less be known Molly now is blonde and is played by Darlene Vogel ""Farscape"" Leaves us with an Angel that never ment to be in the series but ended up in there! Leaving us with a blonde a gun shot boom poof its over. So if you haven't seen it DONT pay 50 bucks for the vhs as it is not on dvd or in The Angel Collection. I would say if your in need to have to watch part 4. Wait till you see it on Ebay for buy it now for a few bucks But with free shipping. However we all have our own taste and my taste is in for Donna Wilkes. Great acting 25 years later its a must see from vhs to dvd to boxed sets to posters still to this day. There is just something about the Angel we all fell in love with. Thank you Angel Anes!",1238803200,,3490,3.994277539341917
1862631,4,B00008V5RO,"I enjoyed this trilogy. In the first part 'Angel', a teen-aged girl abandoned by her parents leads a double life, by night she is a hooker and by day she is an honor roll student. She is hiding the fact that her mother doesnt live with her but she manages to support herself, including paying her own private school tuition and tells the neighbors that her mother is ill and handles the household bills. It all hits the fan when a serial killer begins killing off her hooker friends and she gets targeted too. Her landlord gets killed, she be-friends a detective and he takes her under his wing after they catch the killer of course.

In the second film, 'Avenging Angel' Now Angel is in college...to be a lawyer. An undercover cop posing as a hooker gets killed and the detective that took Angel in gets murdered, she goes back to the streets to find the killer.

In 'Angel III' it gets a bit cheesy, Angel finds her Mom and the sister she never knew she had. Mom gets murdered and she has to rescue her sister from a life of prostitution, in this one Im a bit confused because Angel is a photographer, not a lawyer. It was okay but not as good as the first two.

Hope you enjoy!!",1232841600,2,1181,4.3108108108108105
1862632,4,B00008V5RO,"In 1984, I fell in love with a cheesy drive-in movie named Angel. It starred soap star Donna Wilkes, Dick Shawn, Rory Calhoun, Susan Tyrrell and Cliff Gorman (in one of the best roles of his career). This girl was a high school student during the day, a hooker at night. The reason she started hooking was her mom just left her and she need to get money somehow..WOW a great reason to be a lady of the evening! It had T & A, but kept the sleezibess  in a small amount. Molly (Angel tried to solve the murder of her friend, another hooker. It was well done for a small grindhouse film.

A year later 1985, (that five years in movie time  for you), A sequal came out. I wanted to stop and say NO, but I went anyway!  I was not disaapointed. Betsy (Tomboy) Russell took on the role of Angel. In this film, Molly is graduating college and out of hooking. Her police guardian Detective Andrews, who is now played by Robert Lyons, is shot death. Molly realizes the best way to get information is to be Angel. Flanked by Kit (Rory Calhoun) and Solly (Susan Tyrrell), they flesh out who killed Andrews. With Ossie  Davis in this cast, it brought a bit of class to this small film. At the end of this film ,you thought this film series was over when Molly spouted the film line ""You know I never had a family Before.""

A year later, 1986, Angel III: The Final Chapter. Angel is played by Mitzi Capture, who later did the show Silk Stalkings. Angel finds her birth mother and knows she has a sister. Her sister is involved with a slavery ring headed by Maud Adams, who also appeared in James Bond: the Man with Golden Gun. The piot thickens as Angel's Mom dies and tries to find her sister. Richard (Shaft) Roundtree plays the detective she befriends and helps her.

These Angels would never win best in show, but surpasses most of the GRINDHOUSE/Drive-in Cinema stuff. If anything, it is good for a night's entertainment. It does not  like look cheap and the supporting  casts are good

1862633,4,B00008V5RO,"I have been looking for the Angel movies for quite some time. I expected to maybe find them very used, and on VHS. I never thought I'd find them on DVD, much less together in a box set. Awesome!! It was pretty cool trippin down memory lane, watchin these movies. Glad I finally have them. Thanks Amazon!",1202688000,,303,4.333333333333333
1862634,4,B00008V5RO,"The original ANGEL, released in 1984, was a surprise sleeper hit all over the world; garnering a cult following during it's runs on late-night cable.  Donna Wilkes plays Molly Stewart, a 15-year-old schoolgirl who moonlights as a hooker (called Angel) on Hollywood Boulevard.  Abandoned by her mother, Molly is taken care of by eccentric landlady Solly (Susan Tyrrell), transvestite Mae (Dick Shawn), and former cowboy Kit (Rory Calhoun).  Molly's world is shattered when a serial killer starts offing her fellow toms, and becomes the next target when she points him out of a police lineup.  ANGEL is filled with thrills, spills, campy one-liners and some equally over-the-top performances.

This box set also includes the two sequels, AVENGING ANGEL (released in 1985), and ANGEL III: THE FINAL CHAPTER (released in 1988).  AVENGING ANGEL is the better film, because we get to see more of Susan Tyrrell and Rory Calhoun reprising their roles of Solly and Kit.  Law student Molly (Betsy Russell) returns to the streets in order to track down the gangland killers who mowed down her guardian, Lt. Andrews (Robert Lyons).  Betsy Russell, one of the main pin-up beauties of the 80s, delivers a good performance as Molly/Angel.

ANGEL III: THE FINAL CHAPTER follows Molly (now played by Mitzi Kapture) as she tries to track down her mother and long-lost sister, bringing down a white-slave trade ring in the process (run by former Bond girl Maud Adams).  The third movie doesn't really work because the story and characters surrounding Angel are so dark and serious.  The earlier ANGEL films were the perfect mix of comedy and action with endearing characters; you won't find that winning combination in the third movie.  However, Mitzi Kapture does come closest to the spirit of Donna Wilkes in her performance as Molly/Angel.

The ANGEL trilogy is a perfect addition to your DVD collection, especially if you love 80's kitsch.",1179446400,12,1924,5.089171974522293
1862635,5,B00008V5RO,"Angel Our Fav 1980s Hooker Is Finally a released on dvd..But please note that the 5 star rating for this dvd is for the first Angel movie ONLY..Movie 2 Avenging Angel is about 3 stars..And the 3rd movie here is barely a 2..I can't say too much good about 2nd and 3rd movie..But the first and original Angel movie starring a sexy Donna Wilkes..Who was at the time in her mid 20s playing a not quite 15 year old schoolgirl hooker..This is one of my favorite movies of the 1980s..The videotape had many Moons ago burned out so the release on dvd is welcomed..The first movie is so good it is worth the price..She is by day a cute little schoolgirl innocent in pigtails..And by night a ""hot child in the city"" as that song said..This movie really brings that song to mind even though it isn't played in the movie but it should..Hooker by night walking the streets along Hollywood Blvd..Little top short black leather skirt just wished she would've kept the pigtails here too but hey who is complaining..She walks the streets along side some wild characters..Including 2 veterans of film (i may have their names spelled wrong if i do forgive me) Rory Calhone he lampoons the cowboy that he had played in so many old western movies..And the best one is played by Dick Shawn picture half Frank n Furter from Rocky Horror Picture Show meets Milton Berle..You may remember Dick Shawn as LSD/Hitler in movie ""Producers""..Can see some of his character from Producers here too..He is hilarious in the movie..And political correctness thankfully is no where to be found which makes it a welcomed sight in this day and age of political correctness..This is sort of a Jack the Ripper kind of tale set in 1980s Hollywood Blvd..Where Angel tracks down the serial killer who is killing off her co streetwalkers..Both her innocent and hooker portrayals is the sexiest you will see in any 80s film..Yeah it is cheaply filmed we could've filmed the movie ourselves..Like i said what i wrote here is about the first movie only..One question how can they call a the complete collection..
For there was also a Part 4 to this sexploytation movie series..Part 4 had found Angel treading into the world of Rock Groupies..And it is NOT here in this set..So it isn't complete..Sad it isn't coz that one was the best one next to the classic first movie..I recommend this set ONLY to get the first one coz it is the only way can get it on dvd..There are NO behind the scenes here wish there was..Would love to see more of Donna Wilkes...She Lil Angel during the day but a Lil Devil by night..Donna Wilkes is piggytails sex and candy wittle schoolgirl what HOT dreams are made of...Schoolgirl Mmmmmm Daddy Like......",1076284800,3,2684,4.6645569620253164
1862636,5,B00008V5RO,"If you're on this page then you probably already know the basics about the Angel films. I beg to differ with the previous reviewer about Angel III, i found it quite entertaining. It's not perfect I will admit...but not all that bad.
Anchor Bay has released yet another quality DVD set with ""The Angel Collection"" containing 3 DVD's for parts 1 through 3 of the series. All three are presented in 1.85:1 Widescreen (16x9 Animorphic). As far as the picture quality is concerned, these movies look just about as good as they possibly could on the DVD format. I never noticed any dust artifacts or other imperfections in the film prints used for the transfers. The sound is presented in Dolby 2.0 Mono, since they were all originally released with Mono soundtracks I suppose. It is crisp and clean, also about as good a sound as an old Mono track can provide.
The Special Features of ""ANGEL"" (Disc 1) are two Theatrical Trailers, and several Deleted Scenes with no sound (sound was lost) but with English subtitles so we know what the original dialogue was.
The Special Features of ""AVENGING ANGEL"" (Disc 2) are two Theatrical Trailers, and a nice still & poster gallery.
The Special Features of ""ANGEL III: THE FINAL CHAPTER"" (Disc 3) are one Theatrical Trailer.
All in all, a nice trilogy set of this cheesy 80's series of movies. Obviously these movies aren't for everyone, but if you're a fan you really can't go wrong.",1056758400,7,1419,4.7028112449799195

1862657,3,B00008V5RO,"The ""Angel"" series is good campy late-night B-movie fun....even if only to laugh at the cheesy dialogue of this sexploitation film about sexploitation.  ""Angel"" has some heart-wrenching moments, since there are all too many under-aged prostitutes on America's streets. Runaways, the outright-trafficked sex slaves...and the abandoned, like this film's heroine.  The title character is convincingly-portrayed by Donna Wilkes, even if she was a 24-year-old playing a 15-year-old. The silly doggie-ears hairstyle was lame, though - no girl in the 80s would have been caught dead in the schoolgirl wardrobe, either. Oh well. Moving right along.

""Avenging Angel"" finds the title character about to graduate law school four years later in time.  The filmmakers should have lured Donna Wilkes back, because Betsy Russell isn't as convincing or attractive.  The script is worse than the first, and the acting is worse than the worst script.

""Angel 3"" is simply bad all around.  Angel is now a photographer in New York (law school seemingly gone by the wayside).  I'm not sorry this set DIDN'T include ""Angel 4"" because it was a horrid piece of crap that makes the first three look like Academy Award fodder.

Still, these movies are good for a late night when there's nothing better to do, and you've got plenty of popcorn to enjoy this cornball entertainment.",1476489600,2,1354,5.174311926605505

Hey, hookers with guns will make most with a street crime entertainment fedish at least crack open a cold soda and bust a bag of chips and patiently wait. Donna Wilkes was the star of the collection, in my world, but those adorable gazing eyes of Betsy Russell would make a man turn Ben Siegel for Virginia Hill. The Final Chapter was more informative than action packed. Mitzi Kapture can still join us at the table because I still wanted to see the ending.",1412467200,15,610,4.504504504504505

1862734,3,B00008V5RO,"The original is the best and if you like your early 80's 'revenge films' with thin plot, campy characters, and graphic nudity and violence, this collection is for you. So what ever happened to Donna Wilkes? She was goregous and sexy and could show steely nerve outgunning the bad guys while remembering to bring her biology textbook and get to class on time! Revenge is sweet. Angel kicks ass and yes, she's a callgirl, too. This film would get a remake today, but it would be produced by those clowns who made 'Buffy'  or the worthless crap on KTLA 5. Then it would be released with a safe PG13 rating and sanitized. Back in '84, we could still enjoy a sleazy Charles Bronson movie or Angel or a Porky's ( all hard 'R' with multiple scenes of female nudity) but sadly, today somebody somewhere would be offended. They don't make em like they used to. Check out Betsy Russell, who wasn't shy at all about her hot body in ""Angel 3"".",1396224000,6,931,4.444444444444445

1862757,4,B00008V5RO,"One thing about the Angel Series is that it is different.  I wanted to buy ""Avenging Angel"" for years, I don't know why I wanted it, but there it was on my wish list and it was always too expensive? Then IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT released the Angel Trilogy on a single disc.  There aren't alot of extras, just the original previews and the movies.  What I will say is that these are pretty good quality for what they are.  IE managed to clean up the films so there are no streaks or skips like many old movies copied from VHS tapes, these are the real deal and were good to watch.  There are three different actresses playing Angel but they look enough alike to not be a distraction.  If you like the old ""B"" Movies this is a great set for the price and there is some fun watching some of these crazy characatures.",1346371200,7,808,4.248366013071895

1862761,4,B00008V5RO,"Years ago I owned the original Anchor Bay release of ""The Angel Collection"" but being a broke college student I had to sell the thing as I was strapped for cash. Oh, those were sad days. Since that time I wanted to rebuy the set but it went out-of-print and was selling for ridiculous amounts of money so I decided to wait and low and behold Image Entertainment reissued the films in their own triple feature set... but it's not as good the old Anchor Bay counterpart.

Unlike the Anchor Bay set which has each Angel film on a separate disc, the Image set has all three on one single sided, duel layer disc. When I purchased the set I assumed it would be a double disc set and was rather disappointed to see all three films crammed together on one disc. To my surprise however the films' picture quality doesn't suffer too much with having all three films compressed onto one disc and the digital flacks common with compressed films was kept to a minimum and didn't bother my enjoyment of the films at all.

Overall I would have preferred this release to be a 2 disc set much in the vein of the Shout! Factory Roger Corman triple features but for the price the picture quality of these films wasn't bad. If you are a die hard fan of the films then you might want to hunt down the original Anchor Bay release as it is of higher quality but for casual fans this set will do just fine.

On a side note after all these years I still hear people complain that the set doesn't contain the fourth film ""Angel 4: Undercover"". The reason for this is because the rights to that film are owned by Lionsgate Entertainment. Knowing their track record for older films it will be a miracle if it ever gets released. Still keeping my fingers crossed...",1334707200,51,1736,4.368421052631579
