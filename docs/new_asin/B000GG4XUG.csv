2609265,5,B000GG4XUG,"THE DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT is a European horror movie concerning the quest for a magical ring. Mark Damon is excellent in a dual role as the Schiller brothers who are in search of this ring, but the movie belongs to Rosalba Neri (credited as Sara Bay, as she was in the legendary LADY FRANKENSTEIN). Her incredible beauty is used to the hilt as she portrays Countess Dracula, the possessor of the ring. This is a psychedelic, shock-filled ride into the upper echelons of Euro-horror!

I got this movie as an episode of the original ELVIRA'S MOVIE MACABRE (from the early 1980's, to be exact), and it is a fun trip back to the heyday of horror hosts! In this particular episode, Elvira's Auntie Virus (played by Eve Smith) takes over the show! While the print on THE DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT, needless to say, has seen better days and is scratchy, it is the best the movie has ever looked and will look for some time. Elvira's hosting segments provide a nice breather from the scary atmosphere the movie creates, but you have the option of seeing just the movie. Enjoy!",1337731200,9,1064,4.6
2609266,5,B000GG4XUG,"... my take on the devil's wedding night is that this film is italy's answer to the challenge of hammer's karnstein trilogy -- the name karnstein is even mentioned in the film ...

... this movie could be classified as a dracula picture. neri lives in the deceased count dracula's castle and was attached (?) to him at some previous point in time. according to the aurum encylopedia of horror, an alternate title for the devil's wedding night was countess dracula and it's much better than hammer's rather lame countess dracula from '71 directed by peter sadsy. the blood bath sequence from the devil's wedding night is one of the best ever (the one in eli roth's hostel part II is the undeniable champ though) ...

... the italians amped up the sex big-time for the devil's wedding night. and if you've been bitten by rosalba neri's sexy beauty (like i was when i first fell for her in lady frankenstein) this film showcases her magnificence in all its splendour. and it seems the devil's wedding night was shot by none other than the legendary joe d'amato himself! the camera work and the production design is spectacular ...

... and on top of all that, elvira's (and auntie virus') hilarious commentary makes viewing this dvd a religious event ...

8131766,5,B000GG4XUG,"Not only is the movie itself great stupid campy and  mind numbing, but what American male can take their eyes off of ""them"" ?",1392681600,,125,4.208333333333333
8131767,1,B000GG4XUG,"This movie must have been made in the late 20's
It has all kind of film marks, pops and scratches. It Just SUCKS
I do love Elvira.
Not recommended!",1390867200,,147,4.103448275862069
8131768,1,B000GG4XUG,Terrible movie.  It looks like it was made in someone's basement.  The only good quality is Elvira's outfit and her body.,1389657600,,121,4.714285714285714

8131770,3,B000GG4XUG,"Typical Elvira schtic, fun to watch for the campiness and seeing Elvira back in her hay-day. The actual movie was quite bad but Elvira made it fun anyway.",1384387200,,154,4.535714285714286
8131771,1,B000GG4XUG,I did not realize the Elvira hosted these types of shows.  This show was shocking.  I will keep looking for other shows.  Mistress of the Dark was hilarious.,1381104000,,157,4.535714285714286
8131772,4,B000GG4XUG,"I think Amazon needs to allow us just to rate the things, rather than have to write a review every time. How about it Amazon.

The movie is bad, the jokes older than me, and it is only a romp if you are in the right mood",1375574400,,220,3.6808510638297873
8131773,4,B000GG4XUG,"Good but not great, but then one should not expect excellence from a film such as this. Mainly for horror film collectors.",1368921600,,122,4.590909090909091
