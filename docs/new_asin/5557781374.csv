7802630,5,5557781374,"I bought this kit at a conference featuring the authors, Dr. David and Lisa Frisbie. The Frisbies are family counselors from southern California; they are the authors of this ""Couples Night Out"" DVD/CD kit from Group Publishing.

There's a comedy clip (on DVD) and a comedy script (on CD) and basically everything you need to plan and lead a ""Couples Night Out"" for your small group, church event, or other marriage ministry. Everything is right here: you don't have to be creative, dream something up, or etc. There's a multi-page guide that explains every step you need.

There are at least two more of these DVD/CD kits from Group under the same name. I haven't seen those yet, but I highly recommend this one ""Mastering Your Money"" --- it manages to be light and funny while also tackling a tough subject for many couples: spending and money management.

I also recommend anything by these authors: Dr. David & Lisa Frisbie. You can find a lot of their resources on-line including at the website for the new FireProof movie, which they worked on and helped with.

Very helpful --- for anyone trying to help marriages succeed.
