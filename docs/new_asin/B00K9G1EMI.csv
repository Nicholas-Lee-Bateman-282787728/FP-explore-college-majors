8656878,4,B00K9G1EMI,"Engaging and engrossing documentary that feels almost like a cerebral fictional thriller. Commodities entrepreneur Jean-Yves Ollivier recounts
his behind the scenes efforts to help broker the beginning of the end to apartheid in South Africa. While most attention in that historic transition has rightfully gone to Nelson Mandela, the ANC, and those fighting for freedom on the ground, the story of this clever chess-player using his Machiavellian business skills to gently coax together people and nations who weren't even speaking is a fascinating look behind the door at how complex, and not always 100% pure, the impulses behind change can be.

Ollivier seems no fan of apartheid morally, but he freely admits his first impetus for change was realizing it wasn't a sustainable model for a businessman like him trading with South Africa. So he tried to usher in the end of the old order with minimal violence and social disruption.

Occasionally we get the sense we might be hearing a bit of a cherry picked, self-serving version of the story  theres not a lot of hard questioning of Olliviers version of events, or his importance to them. But whatever the details, theres no question this unlikely hero had a serious hand in bring to a close one of the most shameful episodes of the 20th century.",1440460800,,1300,4.981566820276497
