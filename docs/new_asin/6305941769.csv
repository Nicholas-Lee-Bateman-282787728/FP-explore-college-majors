7898570,5,6305941769,"I have had this Video for ten years.  All the young grandchildren enjoy Spot and can't wait to watch. The first thing they ask when at my house is ""watch spot""!",1168300800,,160,4.161290322580645
7898571,5,6305941769,we watch Spot at least 3 times every day.  He just can't enough of this little Puppy.  I wish they would do more of them.,1127865600,,121,3.8
7898572,5,6305941769,"This is a wonderful video for children.  It follows the books by Eric Hill very closely.  There are five stories about a little yellow dog with a big brown spot on his back.  He lives in a nice house with his Mom and Dad and he has lots of friends including Helen the Hippo, Steve the Monkey, Tom the Alligator, and Claire the Turtle.  These are gentle, loving stories that children can easily understand.  Each story teaches a positive and valuable lesson and is very entertaining as well.
In the opening story, ""Spot Goes to School,"" Spot is starting school for the very first time.  He is a little nervous at the beginning, but once he gets to school, he sees his friends and has a good time with them.  The teacher is very nice, and there are lots of interesting things to do.  The students paint, and build with blocks, and play dress-up.  As it turns out, school is a very fun place to be!  At the end of the day, Spot's mother picks him up, and the first thing Spot says is, ""Can I go again tomorrow?""  I think this story would help any little child who is nervous about going to school.
In ""Spot at the PlayGround,"" all of the friends get together for an afternoon of fun.  They play on the Jungle Gym and the Teeter Totter and the Slide.  They learn how much fun they can have sharing and playing together.  They also learn to be careful and watch out for one another.  Having fun CAN be safe!
In ""Spot Makes A Cake,"" Spot is on his way out to play with his friends.  He reminds his mother that she promised to make a cake for the school fair.  She asks if he would like to help.  Of course he would!  But only after he finds his Chef's hat.  This was my favorite scene in the video.  Spot is a fat little puppy who stands on a stool and mixes the cake batter while he wears his hat.  He is SO CUTE!  He makes the cake with his Mom, and winds up having more fun than he expected.  He learns that it can be fun to help around the house.  And best of all, when he takes the cake to the school fair, he wins it right back again!  Spot's Dad is especially happy about that-because he REALLY wanted to eat it before it went to the fair!
In ""Spot In the Woods,"" Spot and his Dad go out for an afternoon walk.  Spot asks everyone he meets along the way if there are any lions or tigers or elephants or bears.  ""Oh Yes, lots of them,"" the birds and foxes and squirrels reply.  This worries Spot, and he decides he wants to go home.  His Dad is puzzled, but he says okay.  After Spot leaves the woods, out pop a lion, a tiger, an elephant, and a bear!  Sometimes the things that children imagine or fear, really can come true!  But when that happens, it's also true that a loving parent or grownup can protect you and take care of you!
The last story is ""Spot's Winter Sports.""  It is a cold and snowy day, and Spot wants to play outside with his friends.  But first he must dress warmly!  He has a snowball fight with Helen the Hippo and takes a ride on his sled with Steve the Monkey.  Helen and Spot work hard at building a snowman.  They ask Steve to help them, but he is too busy doing something by himself.  Spot wonders what is so important that Steve can't help.  Actually, Steve is working on a surprise for Spot-a snowman that looks exactly like Spot!  And best of all, he builds it on  Spot's sled so that he can take it home and show his Mom and Dad!  Aren't friends great!
As you can see, these are sweet and charming little stories.  There is nothing rough or violent or scary in them.  Around our house, we like to watch these stories in the evening when we're getting ready for bed.  They are so calm and quiet, they make you feel like you are ready to relax and go to sleep.  This video is a MUST HAVE for small (and even not so small) children!!",1017187200,12,3763,4.133977900552487
