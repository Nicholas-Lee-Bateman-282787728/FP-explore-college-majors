8432984,1,B004KIZFLC,"Wished the movie itself was as good as the picture on the cover.  Watch it if a fan of the cast, otherwise what you witness can not be erased with decades of therapy.  The ridiculous script is mainly to be blamed, the plot and dialogues are even a bigger joke.  I can't wrap my head around it, why would actors of this status get on board this project. What a shame.",1459382400,,366,4.126760563380282
