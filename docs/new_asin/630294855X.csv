7832938,5,630294855X,Lilias is great to begin with yoga.  She is so gentle with people who haven't a clue what they are doing starting out.  She can really get you going so slowly and not hurt you.  Where so many people can get scared just from the work yoga she doesn't do moves that scare me or hurt me.  This is a great way to start,1385078400,,314,3.859375

7832940,5,630294855X,"Lilias is a wonderful teacher. She is what made me feel like yoga was something I could do. This tape is two half hour classes. They are not very demanding and focus more on how to approach the asanas in a quality performance rather than quantity of asanas. She emphasizes how you should be feeling as you go in and out of the poses. The workout is pretty easy and she takes you into relaxation at the conclusion. I still use these tapes on days when I am not feeling up to par physically. I highly recommend this tape to anyone interested in learning yoga. Lilias is one of the best teachers that I am familiar with. Of course, you cannot learn yoga from any one tape and all instructors have something to offer in the way of doing better yoga for your personal needs. But you have to start somewhere and Lilias is a wonderful introduction to what yoga is about.",1164412800,,863,4.333333333333333
7832941,5,630294855X,"I was having terrible pains in my arm. It would throb and go limp.  Since 1998 I could not lift my arm above my waist. I purchased Lillians video in 11 2000. I immediately started feeling better with just one listen. Most of the time I have just laid in bed and just listedn to her voice and not do only the deep breathing. This is my testimony.  I've never before experienced someone's voice alone creating a healing in the body.  I now can lift my arm and do all sorts of acrobatics, put my hand on my hip.  All the pain has left. Before I purchased her video I was ready to take all sort of expensive test with my doctor, but I'm happy to say that is not necessary.  Not only my arm but other parts of my body is having a positive reaction to her theory.  I can't say it enough There is healing in her voice and techniques Thank you Lillian

7832942,5,630294855X,"I would highly recommend this video - it's very good to use after you've been doing Lilias' ""beginner"" tapes for awhile.  They're many of the same postures but much more strenuous, and at a quicker pace.  I find  the ""downward dog series"" is really improving my posture, which  is poor after 4 c-sections.
Prospective buyers should be aware that this  is a 2 cassette, 120 minute tape.  Also available and listed under the very  same name is a 1 cassette version, only 60 minutes.  I think it's just the  1st cassette, sold separately from the 2nd.",952905600,28,548,4.625
