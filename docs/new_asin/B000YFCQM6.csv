8372222,5,B000YFCQM6,"This series is terrifically funny and creative.  Marc Labreche is a superb and versatile actor who plays a doctor, his triplet brother and triplet sister, as well as the grandfather.  Anne Dorval is deliciously delightful playing the part of a broadcaster and her nurse twin sister.  The supporting cast are all consummate and hilarious comedians and actors.  The dialogue is hilariously histrionic.  The show is a precious parody of all the soap operas that have ever been created.  It's worth learning Canadian-French for! (I'd write this in French but I'd probably make too many errors.)",1369094400,,590,5.157894736842105
