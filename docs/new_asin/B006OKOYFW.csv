They are better than the movie, with Jack Lemon and his partner.
I want Them, again.",1360540800,,117,4.363636363636363
5009619,4,B006OKOYFW,"Okay, I'll start with this:  ""The Odd Couple"" is my favorite series ever.  With that said, this 8-episode collection may be ""fan favorites"" based on an internet poll, but as a true ""best of"" it fails miserably.  ""The Blackout"" from season 1?  Really?  It's a fine episode, but hardly among the best, especially when measured up to other episodes from later seasons.  (Season 1 of ""The Odd Couple"" was undoubtedly the show's weakest, and I don't think I'm in the minority on that one.)

To really get a grasp of how great this series really was, you need episodes like ""The Fat Farm,"" ""Felix the Calypso Singer"" (my absolute favorite episode), ""The Flying Felix,"" ""The Sleepwalker"" or ""The Ides of April.""  Release those episodes on a single disc and that would be a much more impressive ""Best Of.""  The ""Password"" episode is on here, and that is the one episode I agree with as far as a ""Best Of"" is concerned.

The studios should have just called this DVD ""Fan Favorites"" and left off the ""Best Of"" part of the title.  Fans may have chosen these as their favorites, but that's not necessarily the ""best"" of the series.",1358294400,13,1119,4.601010101010101

5009621,5,B006OKOYFW,Glad I bought this impulse purchase.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching this dvd.  Brought back memories of watching this show with my parents (on a black & white tv of course). Nice to see it in color. Makes me want to buy the entire series. The years haven't changed me: I still strongly relate to Felix. :),1356307200,2,305,4.428571428571429

5009644,5,B006OKOYFW,"Great selection of some MY favorite episodes as well (the password episode is incredible!) of one of my favorite TV shows.

5009650,5,B006OKOYFW,"""The Odd Couple"" is one of my favorite shows of all time-The chemistry that Tony Randall & Jack Klugman had was spectacular-Hard to believe that both of these performers are no longer with us-Randall died in 2004,Klugman died in late 2012-This DVD gives you eight classic ""OC"" episodes,including the ""Password"" episode which is priceless-Definitely worth purchasing.",1367366400,,366,5.553571428571429

8502018,4,B006OKOYFW,"I really wanted to buy the complete series, but I just won't do it since they edited out so much of it.

Since I don't see them listed in the product description, here are the 8 episodes included:

The Blackout
Security Arms
I'm Dying of Unger
Password
Take My Furniture, Please
The Murray Who Came To Dinner
