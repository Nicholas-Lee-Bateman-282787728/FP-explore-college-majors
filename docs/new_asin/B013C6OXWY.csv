8727232,5,B013C6OXWY,"Oh man, is this a terrible movie.  If you break it down, this hour long movie is mostly padding of repeated scenes, telephone calls, and scenes from another one of director Millard's movies.

But still...

Our Death Nurse is running Shady Palms clinic.  Patients check in, and they are soon killed so our Nurse and her brother can cash in.  That's really the plot.  (Very similar to Millard's Cemetery Sisters).  More patients show up, people ask about missing patients, and our Nurse dodges scrutiny, and keeps on killing.

So okay, this isn't a well directed or scripted film (terrible in those departments), but it still falls under the fun SOV bad movie category.  Odd moments like a dude scooping ice cream into a bowl for WAY too long and a scene where our Nurse and her brother chase a cat that has stolen a heart is hilarious.  DN is great fun if you're a bad movie horror buff.  If you're a regular horror movie fan (nothing at all wrong with that), you might want to understand what you're getting into first.

This movie deserves close study.  I can see colleges teaching this in film school.  Death Nurse 101.  I'd love to teach it.

Special Features are aplenty.

If you own a single SOV horror film, and you dig it, you should snatch this one up quick.
