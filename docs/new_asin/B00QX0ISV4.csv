6889086,1,B00QX0ISV4,"SPOILER ALERT
Oh dear - what passes as  moronic entertainment these days.
The  sad and immoral fans of this terrible series will tell you that it's all about a cool group of guys on motorcycles who demonstrate their cool behavior by killing, whoring and breaking any other laws that are going with their depraved lifestyles, when the REAL TRUTH is that these criminals are all gutless cowards who never had the inner strength of character to live lives of moral decency towards their fellow man - or in the end - even towards each other !
The lead loser in this farce is Jax Teller - or Wobble Head - seeing as he spends the entire 7 year run in a perfect imitation of his own bobble head figure by being utterly incapable of keeping his head still whilst talking to anybody, is nothing but a weak-willed MOMAS BOY who lacked the guts to severe the umbilical cord that connected him to 1 of the most vile, immoral women who ever had the misfortune of putting her repulsive face onto a tv screen !
The awful series itself has got to be the ultimate in laugh-out-loud, ""I'm so in denial about my homosexual feelings towards you,"" comedies (outside of Top Gun) I've ever seen - with endless moments of grown men hugging each other whilst proclaiming in choke-filled voices ,""I love you, man !""
Absolutely hilarious !
Kurt Sutter has obviously learned nothing from his time working on The Shield and thinks that the only way to write a tv series is to cram it with pointless, tedious, monotonous musical montages throughout and then gives us 1 of the most absurd series finales that simply beggars belief !
Old Wobble Head is now wanted by the law for all of his latest acts of cowardly murder, yet when a police officer has him cornered talking to dear dadsy at his roadside memorial he makes no attempt whatsoever to arrest him but instead  leaves him there yakking away to popa for about half an hour before then letting him  just ride away - cop of the year this guy aint !
This laughable nonsense has to happen so that we can now be given an even more ridiculous scene of about 100 cop cars pursuing Wobble Head in what has got to be 1 of THE slowest police chases EVER, as Wobble Head is only doing about 20mph and yet at no point do any of the police simply try to overtake him !
Sutter is so desperate to give his leading loser a moving send off but instead laughably ends up showing his audience just what a moral weakling Wobble Head was all along, by being utterly incapable of living with his degenerate actions over the last 7 years - like destroying the lives of both his wife and eldest son - he takes the cowards way out instead !
What courage !
What a hero !
So if you want to waste your time and money - for a fool and their money are easily parted - watching a dreadful tv series that contains the worst examples of humanity (outside of the deluded fans who continue to defend it !), then SOA is clearly for you !  But then what does that say about your own lack of moral standards ?  Not alot !
(I myself only continued to watch it because I'm a huge Ron Perlman fan and will check out anything - no matter how lame or bad - with the great man's name attatched to it.)
If however you're expecting a quality written tv series that isn't ruined by a leading man who's only been hired for his looks and who can't act and who laughably looks like he's having some kind of a fit with his vibrating head - that has any kind of moral decency to it whatsoever - then I suggest that you dump this boxset into the nearest rubbish bin where  cheap trash like this so obviously belongs !
Finally I'm not remotely interested in comments by fans of this series who can't handle the slightest criticism against their beloved turkey  and who are as morally bankrupt as the criminals that they idolise, and who therefore are unable to tell what even constitutes as decent behavior these days !
But by all means  keep leaving your  comments where they're not welcome, comments which I never bother to read anyway, and comments which I will take great pleasure in deleting !",1430870400,5,4071,4.358839050131926

6889089,5,B00QX0ISV4,"Most people who are reading this have watched most or all of SoA, and many other reviewers have covered the show in their contributions, but I MUST review the packaging the set comes in.

Most complete season sets come in 'books' with cardboard sleeves that you slip the discs in and out of. Not this one! Inside the cardboard wrapper was two gigantic hard cases that look like, and are the same color as, a regular blu ray.

These cases are the same height as a standard blu ray case, and just a little bit deeper by roughly 1/8 of an inch. Inside these cases are two Rolodex-style blu plastic holders that you flip through for each disc. This is a far more suitable option than cardboard sleeves that constantly rub the readable surface of your discs each time you pull them in and out.

I've included pictures, probably far too many pictures if I'm being honest (sorry). But if I'd seen what the set comes in ages ago when I first considered buying the box set? I would have bought it then strictly because of the lack of those terrible cardboard sleeves.

Hopefully this review is helpful to someone else out there like me, who values the container nearly as much as the contents.

Thanks for you time, hopefully someone finds this valuable.",1522195200,11,1245,4.540178571428571

6889183,5,B00QX0ISV4,"I have to admit that at first I didn't think I would like Sons of Anarchy. I tend to prefer more political, legal, and medical dramas, but when browsing Netflix one boring Saturday I randomly decided to watch an episode or two of SoA just to see if I could get into it. Surprisingly I was hooked after the first couple of episodes and ended up more or less ""binge-watching"" all seven seasons over the course of a couple or three months.

Kurt Sutter really has written one of the best original TV series ever with Sons of Anarchy, and the actors are top notch when it comes to how they interact and often struggle with each other, but ultimately end up coming back together as an extended family. The gritty, raw emotion and mostly realistic portrayal of a California-based MC and how it works both for and against the outside world is also very well done. While the performances by every cast member was great, those of Katey Segal (Gemma), Charlie Hunnam (Jax), Ron Perlman (Clay), Maggie Siff (Tara), and Mark Boone Junior (Bobby Elvis) in particular deserved so many more awards and accolades than what they received for their performances. From the very first episode all the way through to the totally AWESOME series finale, I don't think there was a single moment when I got bored or tired of watching the show. And speaking of the series finale...what an absolutely fantastic way to go out!! What was being shown on screen, coupled with the ending song ""Come Join the Murder"" will likely (hopefully?) go down as one of the greatest series endings ever. I'm not afraid to admit that even I shed a single manly tear when watching it all play out.

Even though a new series is currently being developed to focus on the Mayans MC, I think Kurt Sutter would be wise to develop another one about the early days of SAMCRO, John Teller, Piney Winston, Clay Morrow, Lenny the Pimp and the other ""Original 6"" founding members.",1484092800,,1924,4.606413994169096

However these shows are not listed in the table of contents  so technically they're not missing from this set. I remembered what happened from watching the show on TV is how I discovered this. I then googled the synopsis for season 2s finale to verify my suspicion. This is the only reason I gave 2 stars. If it wasn't missing that episode I would have gave 5 stars for sure.",1483142400,3,476,4.348314606741573

6889225,4,B00QX0ISV4,"The series takes place in a fictional town in California called Charming. It focuses on a large biker gang called SAMCRO and their relationships among each other, girlfriends, and with the law/town officials. They are a group of outlaws who are into the gun running business and later take on the interest of pushing drugs for the Mexican cartels, and eventually get into the brothel/escort service as well. My favorite actor in this series is Ron Perlman.

The things I don't like about this series that it contains bloody scenes that are extremely gory without any censorship, however seem to be afraid to show any type of graphic nudity. I mean they can show people getting chopped up into pieces with an ax, however don't even show one woman's breast! It just didn't make sense to me. Also, they seem to intentionally not include any bar scenes in the entire series even though in real life, many bikers like to hang out in biker bars. Background music is also terrible....should really have been southern rock and country to fit the setting.  I also feel that some of the dialogue scenes were too long and strung out and the storyline was very slow moving. It didn't have to be stretched out threw so many episodes. Although the plot was great with a lot of suspense, it did seem to drag a little bit and probably could have been condensed better. Otherwise, I definitely recommend it. A few actors in this series were are also members of the Hells Angels in real life.",1458950400,3,1474,4.64367816091954

6889233,5,B00QX0ISV4,"Charming. ""Pleasing or delightful"". That's a definition. In ""Sons of Anarchy,"" Charming is something much different.

A month and a half, or so, ago, was looking for something new & different to watch on TV. ""Justified"" was over. None of the shows airing currently really grabbed me other than to serve as a sleeping pill to an insomniac. OK ... I won't go into this again. But, in case you ever find yourself in a similar conundrum, here's my take. Sorry for repeating myself [from previous posts] and in an effort to avoid spoilers I must mince words.

First of all, the show features graphic sex, some real weird depravity, uses the name of Our Lord in vain - routinely - and is one of the more violent tales you are ever likely to see. Got you chomping at the bit, don't I?

So, in ""Sons of Anarchy,"" Charming is the name of a town - their town - and it serves as a metaphor, or maybe a euphemism, some kind of literary word ... it represents the idyllic, ""pleasing or delightful,"" small-town America. Finished the Seven Season Long Movie late last night. It started, it seems like eons ago, with a couple of crows in the road. It ended with that same scene. All hell breaks lose in the interim. Still wrapping my brain around it. Very few television shows - or, movies even - leave me as emotionally spent as this show did. I will carry it around with me for some time.

""Sons of Anarchy"" is dark & dirty and not the easiest show to watch. You'll have to commit. Perhaps, watching only the first 2, or 3, or 4 Seasons - maybe up through the first few episodes of Season 5 - and then just stopping is the way to go. You might feel semi-fulfilled without the weight. I don't know, because I didn't stop.

Why watch then? Well, it's worth it, if you can make it. The cast is A+. You will get to know the many layers of each and every character. They are not the most loveable characters, but you will be inexplicably drawn to many of them. There is depth to them. The banter is wonderful; just enough of it to lighten up things just a tad and provide you with a chuckle just when you need it most. All the production stuff is impeccable. The show's use of music is probably done as well as I have ever seen a show utilize a soundtrack. Some of the songs, coupled with accompanying character vignettes, tell a complete story within themselves. And there are many stories.

And that, is the main reason you should watch. Despite the pain and darkness, despite an unusual turn-off for a few episodes during Seasons 6 & 7 - a side bar that, for the life of me, the relevance I cannot figure out. A part of the story that we really didn't need to see - especially, if you are a ""Justified"" fan. Despite those things, it is an amazingly compelling, complex, well spun yarn. Very well written. They just don't make 'em like this very often.

So, it's over now. All 7 Seasons in several weeks. The rest of TV Land will seem like so much pablum ... until, at least, I can shake off the effects. There were points there, especially in the later Seasons, where I didn't know whether I could make it through. But I did. You won't feel happy when it's over ... I don't know what you'll feel ... but you WILL feel. Maybe, you'll have a better feeling for the meaning of life. Charming, though, it's not.",1437350400,9,3291,4.3241491085899515
