8286464,3,B001CB6RTE,"I'm not sure how many episodes are on volume 1 because it's out of print, but I just picked up volume 2, and while there are 12 episodes of Fraidy Cat on one disc and 2 discs with 6 episodes each of Ghostbusters, the flip side of the Fraidy Cat DVD has the Groovie Ghoulies episodes--and it's only 4 of them. Here's the episode breakdown--note that the Fraidy Cat menu doesn't list episodes, they are just numbered:
