8149811,1,B000J6H1B6,"I'm always, well I used to be, keen to check out flicks about the undead. Yet in recent times, the poor old flesh-eating zombie has been molested by inept young gits who flounce about with the nerve to call themselves directors. It's amazing how some people really believe in themselves, when in fact there is nothing to believe in. WAKE UP!!!! Stop abusing the dead by making pitifully acted, zero-budget tripe. I feel cheated!!! I know, I'm the fool for buying it, but there should be a law!!!! Poor old George Romero must be rolling in his grave, and he ain't even (un)dead yet. Leave it to the masters. Go mow lawns or something. In short, AVOID THIS 20-minute DIAHRROEA!!!!!",1200787200,6,679,4.666666666666667

Unfortunately, I found too little here to like.

The film begins with a man named Eric killing a zombie. Soon, Greg and Jesse show up, claiming their car has broken down and asking for shelter. Eric reluctantly takes them into his RV and then begins with a series of statements redolent of macho nonsense. Since he has the gun, it seems Greg and Jesse have no choice but to go along. And yet they don't.

The main problem for me with this film was the combination of stilted acting and the characters' ill-considered choices. The 23-minute film is not long enough to explore the claustrophobia that was so effective in Romero's film, and the characters (or actors) are never really free to escape their one-dimensional roles.",1198368000,3,1021,5.7105263157894735
