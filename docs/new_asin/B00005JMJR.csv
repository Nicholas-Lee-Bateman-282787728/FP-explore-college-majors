Not only should this movie still be on VHS, but I think it is deserving of being on DVD as well, and perhaps even released in theaters again.  Anyone who had never seen it would have no idea how old it was, and us old farts who did see it would no doubt enjoy seeing it again.",1117065600,22,417,4.0120481927710845

1514764,5,B00005JMJR,"""The Hellstrom Chronicle"" is an insect film that has deserved a DVD release for some time (not just for inspiring entomologists who lean towards the speculative literatures in their leisure hours) but the Olive Films release, while merciful, is not nearly as high of quality as it should have been. The transfer of the film is a bit grainy, a bit off color, and obviously not remastered. I am so disappointed that Green was not asked to contribute an audio commentary. I realize that sounds nerdy to some, but he is a great documentary director (known today for providing the story for Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"") and conceptualist. He could have at least been interviewed. Why Seltzer wasn't interviewed either is still a mystery. I can't believe that there are no archived interviews about this title--it was unique in its day because it was a film (maybe the first?) that blended the genres of science fiction thriller and quasi-documentary film for a truly unique approach to crafting a film experience. The script really is fun, as it blends fact, fiction, and paranoia, as well as entomological commentary. I can't give the product (DVD) three stars--the rating that this issue deserves--because I so love the film itself--Green allows us to dip low into the insect world and, truthfully, there is never a lack of interesting images to see in this picture. Even the somewhat interjecting comments by Nils Hellstrom do not distract from the fascinating insect footage. We've seen so many improvements in close photography and computer-printed movies that it seems as if this title will only be treated as 'archaic' by film historians when they head back to it in future. But, for me, it's a timeless divergence into the little seen world of insect production and (as Seth Brundle would say) politics. Not the best DVD that we could have gotten, but at least the wait is finally over.",1390953600,3,1890,4.909375
1514765,5,B00005JMJR,This film has so much information and super great macro photography... It shows we are clearly at a disadvantage when it comes to nature and its inhabitants,1390435200,,156,4.814814814814815
1514766,5,B00005JMJR,"Ever since having viewed The Hellstrom Chronicle during its initial theater run in the U.S. in 1971 I have thought of re-watching it numerous times.  I am very happy to now have this on blu-ray.  The film's macrophotography in 35mm made, for that time, a truly awesome and impactful impression on me.  The message of the ""documentary"" was also impactful, but less so.  Because although I was young I still sensed the humor of the, ""Well...maybe not in our lifetime"" tone tittering just under the narrator's direst warnings.  Perhaps I had already been by then inured to such alerts from too many PBS programs.  Today's viewer, however, witnessing the apocalyptic destruction of humanity by insects would likely have an even more healthy dose of cynicism and be  much less impressed due to the exponentially overwhelming number of entire cable network channels dedicated to bringing disaster programming to viewers on a daily basis.  After all, how is a colony of ants rampaging against a DDT armed human more of a threat than that of a runaway asteroid or super volcano against which humanity's only response could be to just stand gaping in awe at their own imminent demise?  That was what witnessing The Hellstrom Chronicle was like in 1971. It may have been a bit ahead of its time for a ""documentary"" film of such subtle satirical terror.  But, there have been many other attempts to repeat its success and achieve its recognition for effort from an Academy Award committee.  For example, An Inconvenient Truth comes to mind.  Oh wait, was Al Gore serious?  Well, then how about Sharknado?",1389484800,,1593,4.899253731343284
1514767,4,B00005JMJR,A movie that makes you think.  A what if movie that plays like a documentary.  Very convincing so.  What if the insects toke over the world.  Very scary.  Watch it and you make the best choice.,1384473600,,193,4.25
1514768,5,B00005JMJR,This is a great film.  It allows one to understand the true nature of nature.  The film uses great images and metaphors to communicate humanity's ultimate end.,1371600000,,159,4.851851851851852

1514853,4,B00005JMJR,"Nils Hellstrom the host of the 1972 Oscar winning documentary ""The Hellstrom Chronicle"" doesn't exist and never has. A documentary-thriller written by David Seltzer (""The Omen"")and directed by Walon Green argues that bugs, plants and other small creatures will inherit the Earth and we, humanity, are but temporary passengers on our planet.

Using fascinating microphotography (which was cutting edge at the time), ""The Hellstrom Chronicle"" allows the host (actor Lawrence Pressman who confides in us early on in the documentary that what he is about to tell us has cost him friends and faculty positions)to document with often stunning photography WHY we don't and won't deserve to inherit the Earth. Cleverly promoting the film as if it were science fiction thriller, producer David Wolper, Seltzer and Green created a fascinating film that used truth to lure in unsuspecting audiences like a venus flytrap to educate while entertaining.

Olive films presents ""The Hellstrom Chronicle"" in, what it claims, is the original aspect ratio in 1.66:1 pillar boxed (with black bars on the side). The international Movie Database claims that the film was originally presented in 1.85:1 but it's possible that the film was matted in theaters after the film was shot. Olive films has often released films that were independently produced, have become public domain or were orphaned and not owned by a major studio.

The visual presentation of the film is somewhat mixed ranging from stunning with bright, bold colors to clearly in need of restoration. For example, there's a scene early on where Hellstrom talks to us in a public park and the source print has clearly faded (and it's on one side of the frame). After the somewhat uneven presentation in the beginning the film (particularly the microphotography sequences) improves with bold colors and good detail.

There's also speckling evident throughout although it's not bad it could easily have been digitally removed with a bit more careful restoration. I'm sure the film would look much worse if not for some of the adjustments done to the image during the transfer process to Blu-ray and DVD.

No doubt the flaws I mentioned won't be quite as noticeable on DVD as they are on Blu-ray.

Image quality varies from quite good to soft. On the whole the presentation is good for a 40 year old film that hasn't had extensive restoration. Surprisingly, the live action footage of the Hellstrom is the softest looking in this presentation. Film grain is visible throughout the presentation.

Audio sounds quite good with a solid mono presentation. The music by Lalo Schifrin (the ""Mission: Impossible"" theme among his many credits) adds considerable to the mood of the film providing the narrative glue much like Pressman's narration.

There aren't any special features which is a pity because director Walon Green is still alive (he is a producer/writer on ""Law and Order: Criminal Intent"" among other series)and even actor Pressman (still alive and performing in such as ""Crossing Jordan"", ""The Mentalist"" and other shows)as is writer David Seltzer and any one of the three could have been hired to provide a commentary track, appear in special features about the making of the film if contacted, etc.

Although the visual presentation isn't anywhere near flawless, the film looks decent even if it could have used restoration and is a marked impovement over the previous ""gray market"" releases of the film on DVD. The lack of special features is disappointing as well but isn't a deal breaker for picking up the movie.

I'd still recommend ""The Hellstrom Chronicle"" as it's a fascinating movie and a nice companion piece to the cult classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phase-IV/dp/1606730266/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phase IV</a>which takes the next step from this film.

Presentation: 3 stars
Audio: 4 stars

I haven't seen it for well over 30 years and I can remember pieces of it as if I saw it yesterday. The film is beautifully shot with some incredible footage even by today's standards.

7940413,5,B00005JMJR,"I purchased the Blu Ray version on Amazon about a year ago. But, I see that the  Blu Ray version is not currently offered. I think that Blu Ray was the only version offered when I purchased it.

I saw the film in 1971 in the theater, and I remember it being billed as a horror film. I used to go every Saturday to see horror film matinees. This is a thing of the past. But, I remember being confused about Dr. Hellstrom. Was he real? The note at the end seemed to say he was not real. I remember thinking: we are doomed. Insects will take over the world.

I never saw the film since 1971, but I had often thought about it. I looked online over the years -- but never found it until about a year ago. So, I was excited to see it again.

This film is definitely a documentary, disguised  a bit, to scare the viewer into thinking about the bigger picture. Everything in it is as true today as it was back in 1971. And, the photography is incredible, standing up to anything you've ever seen before on any Nature doc or Science Channel doc. That's why I was pleased to have the Blu Ray version. But, it is not widescreen, and there are no extras. Just the film.

The film depicts a wide array of ""monsterous"" insects in their natural habitat, gorging on plants or one another or on animals. Also shown is a variety of reproduction methods used by assorted insects. All filming is ultr-close-up. Dr. Hellstrom is the narrator who explains what is going on, and who's thesis is that insects will always be here, no matter what man or nature does to destroy the earth. They simply multiply so fast that any obstacle can be solved rapidly by simply evolving to confront the obstacle. Humans, on the other hand, cannot evolve so rapidly.

This is basically true. But, Dr. Hellstrom does not delve into the beneficial aspects of insects -- except briefly for bees. He presents the viewer with an endless variety of terrifyingly-efficient killer insects and relentless eaters. So, while everything he says is true, there are other reasons that we do want insects-- at least, some insects. The insect is not properly placed within the context of nature as a whole. Still, it is scary.

This is an excellent film to show to high school students. It can generate a lot of thought about the place of Man in the universe, evolution, the rapidity of evolution (which is now seen by science as occurring more rapidly than previously thought), ecology, etc. The only thing fake about this film is the fictional Dr. Hellstrom.",1511136000,,2506,4.492307692307692
7940414,5,B00005JMJR,Not a science-fiction movie but a science-fact film in a semi-documentary format. The theme is that the insect world is more than capable of surviving conditions that could very well be an end to the human race. Insects are much more adaptable to changes in the world around them which has allowed them to be so successful for millions of years.
