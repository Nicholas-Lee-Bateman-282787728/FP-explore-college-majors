8066507,4,B0009U5DEY,"This is an interesting dvd of neo prog pioneers. I have read that this band has been called Punk Floyd by some. This is not really an accurate name. This band is unique- not really sounding like anyone in particular. They created a unique sound that blended prog, rock, punk and some new wave tendancies. Pallas and Marillion took a  ""Genesis"" approach in a lot of their work. This band has a little bit of that but forged a different sound not really reminding me entirely of Genesis. Thus, I think they were the most creative of the lot. Weird but nevertheless very interesting music that holds your attention. Great bass player too! As a matter of fact all 5 are great musicians. Creepshow is a good longer composition while the Ceiling Speaks is a good opener. Worth a look...too bad this band is not around anymore.",1142726400,,820,4.578231292517007
