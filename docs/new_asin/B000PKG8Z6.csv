8192011,3,B000PKG8Z6,"Cool film, very difficult to find. Too bad the render is such crap.

Five stars for the film. One star for the DVD production. Average to three. Sorry about that.

Incidentally, the 'video short' on this page is for a totally different, more recent, film of the same title.",1427328000,,273,4.551020408163265
8192012,3,B000PKG8Z6,"Static had the potential for a phenomenal movie but mediocre acting, a slow pace, an uninteresting first half and an underutilized storyline ultimately drags down the rating to a 3.

It's about an attractive blonde, her mild-mannered friend, and another friend (with a SERIOUS attitude problem) get a chip installed in their brains.  This chip has special powers that apparently allows them to read peoples minds and predict what's going to happen before it actually does.  Unfortunately it takes a REALLY long time for this crucial aspect of the storyline to make an appearance- the first hour of the movie (which is about 65% of it) is occupied with pointless communication between the three friends involving flirting (between the blonde and the other guy) and trying to calm down and rationalize the quick-thinking, touchy and explosive other friend.  Oh, and the guy with the attitude and the blonde positively HATE each other.

Only when a certain segment arrives while the two guys are sitting together at a diner does the storyline finally get going.  We're also introduced to Jimmy- the brother of the mild-mannered guy, and even though it was never stated, I believe he was mentally challenged.  What's odd is that whenever people approached the guy they treated him with silence and fear like he was unstable and going to explode at any moment.

Anyway the suspense comes whenever static and frequencies in the air interfere with the chips that the friends installed in their brains.  This interference can come by way of radio signals, radio towers, and other things.  First a nose bleed occurs, then a sensation and an awareness that peoples personalities are changing to a more negative one comes next.  This is the function of this special chip which had a LOT of promise upon reading the description for the movie but unfortunately this aspect was never thoroughly explained nor did it ever take us through a healthy amount of suspense.  You can tell it's a low budget film by the quiet tone that takes place for much of the movie.

Overall, not really very appealing, but I guess if you're willing to wait about an hour a few good scenes will arise.  Expect disappointment though.",1335744000,,2197,4.902702702702703
8192013,1,B000PKG8Z6,"When will Amazon take this company's illegal, garbage-quality DVD-Rs (they're not DVDs if you burn them in your living room from an old VHS tape) off their site?

CAVEAT EMPTOR - you have been warned.",1314921600,13,200,4.714285714285714
8192014,5,B000PKG8Z6,"First of all, this DVD doesn't look so great with a fuzzy picture (I can swear my vhs release has a better picture) and it's not a 1:85 aspect ratio as Amazon lists, it's only 1:33 (full-screen 4x3).  At least it's now on DVD, that's a start.

STATIC is a flawless example of what independent film is all about, even if Mark Romanek seems to not want to talk about this film much.  He should instead be very proud of this, as it has strongly affected everyone I know that has seen it and in a very positive way. Nowadays indie festivals are too chic and filmmakers are trying too hard to get the status that winners of those events get.  If they'd only look back to 1985 and to STATIC, they'd learn a thing or two.

The story is quite simple: A young man named Ernie, not quite over the death of his parents, uses his skills as an inventor to come up with a device that may or may not monitor images of heaven and hopes to see his parents. Through the interaction of several eccentric yet not exaggerated characters, they (and we) learn lessons about desperation, hope, and acceptance.  Is Ernie a genius or just a little off?  It really doesn't matter, and you'll see why.

STATIC paces itself, and while never snappy, it uses its time wisely. While a melancholy mood prevales, we are still affected in many ways by the different characters we are introduced to.  The use of desert landscapes add a lot to the feeling of loneliness (instead of film economics), the careful selection of songs for the soundtrack actually ties in with each scene-- from songs like the now-famous ""This Is The Day"" by The The and even to artists like Elvis! Goes to show you don't have to look for trendiness or a hit soundtrack to sell, which can date a film and make it lose its power over the years.  Static was made in 1985 and hasn't lost an ounce of effectiveness.

There are so many little nuances that will have you hooked, from Ernie's collection of defective crucifixes to Ernie asking Julia why she kissed him: ""'Cause you're a strange boy ...I wish I was more like you,""  it's brilliant.

After all these years, this is the one film that I cherish most and everyone I've suggested it to has said it has stayed in their minds. I still get emotional each time I watch it. Without any dialogue to sum it up, the film's final lingering shot along with Amanda Plummer's thoughtful expression says so much more about feelings than any other film ever could!

This DVD treatment from the company Substance is extremely disappointing especially for such a high price, but it'll have to do until someone gives it a proper release.  Get past that and focus on the film itself, and you'll be glad to have it.",1207267200,8,2690,4.45010183299389

8192016,4,B000PKG8Z6,"Static stars Keith Gordon (Christine, Dressed to Kill) as a strange young man that works in a crucifix factory (yes, really) and takes home the ones that don't quite meet quality standards..in fact he has a rather large collection.  When he's caught taking one he's fired, but he's good with that, that gives him plenty more time to work on his invention, which is a machine that shows Heaven.  The problem is, except for him, no one can see anything on the monitor of this machine except: static.  Amanda Plummer also stars as a ""new wave"" keyboard player who needs a break from performing so goes home to her desert town (yes, of course, this very same one) and manages to get in on this whole strange little situation.  A very strange and quirky little film, definitely off-beat and guaranteed to delight those who enjoy strange little films.  A mid-80's delight.  4 out of 5 stars, and I can't wait for the DVD!",1178236800,4,915,4.58282208588957
