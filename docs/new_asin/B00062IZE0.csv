8227255,5,B00062IZE0,"Packing Heat is a good budget item to get. Death House is my favorite. It was released in 1987, and starred Dennis Cole. He is a chauffeur who is framed by a Mafia boss and sent to prison. Then it  turns into a pretty gruesome horror film. Not for the kids. This will hold your interest though, as it is a pretty good B-Film. Fans of Dennis Cole will like this the most.",1469664000,,370,4.068493150684931

BROKEN REALITY-- Hollywood homicide detective investigating his girlfriend's death becomes the prime suspect.

DEATH HOUSE-- An interesting movie that shifts genres midway through. For the first half-hour it's a car-chase/mafia action film-- later it becomes a horror flick where government drug experiments on death row inmates transforms them into an army of zombies. Directed by John Saxon.

A KILLING AFFAIR-- A woman living in rural West Virginia shelters her husband's killer from his pursuers.

STINGRAY-- Two drug dealers shoot the cops attempting to sting them. They flee with $1,000,000 and stash their drugs in a classic Corvette, unbeknowst to the car's new owners who drive off. Comedy action flick stars Robert Mitchum's son Chris.
