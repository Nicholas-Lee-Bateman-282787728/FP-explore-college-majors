8230048,1,B000XW6CO8,"We have every dvd in the Teach 2 Talk series. This Noun dvd is acceptable.

But be warned that all of the later dvds contain very lengthy promotions for each individual Teach 2 Talk dvd for sale. And these lengthy promotions are at the beginning of the dvd, and are programmed such that the dvd player will not fast forward through them. So you get your child to sit down and focus, and then you have to wait over 5 minutes while the other dvds are advertised. This advertisement should have been done at the end of the dvd and not at the beginning. Very greedy.",1254960000,10,562,4.30188679245283
