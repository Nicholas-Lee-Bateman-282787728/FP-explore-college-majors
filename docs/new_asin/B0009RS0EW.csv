Larry Shultz is a excellent instructor, and he shows it again once more in this dvd! I've learned alot from this dvd, i even modelled my first character!

Thanks larry for again another bag of training material!",1117411200,,417,4.777777777777778

I bought Larry Shultz World Tour CD's in 2003 too!

After the Next Dimension Tour lessions a must have ""LW Trainig""

It's here the same as the Next Dimension Tour Training, Larry explain his 9 hour lessions as always so easy and exact!

I must say thanks for another 9 houes of lession in Lightwave (it's a eye-opener), a big thanks to Wes Beckwith's Kurv Studios, because he offered Larry's World Tour so cheap as always all his Products!

Hope we can order many many more LW Training like this from Larry Shultz!!!!!!
