It begins with a running herd of Hereford cattle (white faced). [This breed was preferred because of the quality of its meat.] A newspaper tells of the terror caused by the violence from outlaws. Ranchers are attacked and run out of the valley! Can the outlaws be run out of the valley? The ranchers want to organize. Bill Carson follows one man, there is a meeting of the outlaws. But Bill is attacked, they will use him in a scheme attacking small ranchers. Can Bill escape? [Theres a chase for action.] But Andy Jones is wounded and dies. The leader behind the outlaws shows up. The lands will become more valuable once the railroad and settlers come to town. Andy Jones brother arrives to say goodbye. The outlaws send out forms to warn their victims.

 Carson and Jones ride back in the dark, the two intruders are scared of by Andys ghost. The outlaw gang rides away to see Andys grave; it still has the body. Can they trick the outlaws again? The leader doesnt want any of the outlaw gang to leave! The intended victims gather to get rid of Thorn and his gang. Carson fights a gang member, who then names their leaders. They go to Doc Packards office, he tells who else is in the gang. The good guys go to see Bentley. Wheres Thorn? Thorn shoots Bentley to silence him, there is another chase. The good guys show up to stop an attack on a rancher. Thorn captures Fuzzy. Carson rides to the rescue. Will Fuzzy sign a paper? No. The other good guys show up for the rescue.

This is an about average story at best. It is inspired by the events of the Johnson County War where big corporations hired gunmen to attack the small ranchers and homesteaders so they could confiscate their lands. Since there were more armed small ranchers than gunmen the plot failed.",1461542400,,1796,4.483180428134556

7833839,1,6303005012,"This film is one of a series starring Buster Crabbe as Billy Carson, a rancher who spends a good portion of his time attempting to better the lives of sharecroppers and others who run afoul of varying murderous plotters; in this instance, a friend of Carson is killed and replaced by his twin brother, causing consternation amidst the villains who are convinced that the twin is a vengeful ghost. Most of this short (54 min.) work consists of two small groups of extraordinarily confident horsemen who canter about, chasing and shooting at each other, in essentially non-stop fashion; since most video releases of the work have no titles or credits, one's attention becomes drawn to spotting the interchangeability of the good and bad guys......nothing else here warrants a viewer's concentration.",1118448000,,797,5.138461538461539
