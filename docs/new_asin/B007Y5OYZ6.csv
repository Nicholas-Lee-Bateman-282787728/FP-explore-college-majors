8523066,5,B007Y5OYZ6,"This is the unedited Urotsukidoji. It contains 5 OVA episodes as follows: 1. Birth of the Overfiend, 2. Curse of the Overfiend, 3. Final Inferno, 4. Legend of the Demon Womb and 5. Battle at the Shinjuku Skyscrapers. The first 3 OVA comprise the ""Legend of the Overfiend"" story, while the last 2 OVA comprise the ""Legend of the Demon Womb"" story. This was put out by Anime 18 who also put out the ""Legend of the Overfiend"" disk that was an edited and condensed version of the first three OVA episodes. These OVA are subtitled and there is no English Dubbing, whereas the ""Legend of the Overfiend"" condensed version put out by Anime 18 was dubbed into English, as well as a version of ""Legend of the Demon Womb"" that was also available. The combining of the three original OVA into a condensed and dubbed film version seems to have something to do with the ability to edit out some of the sexual content of the three OVA, but also to package them into a shorter film version which would be palatable to an actual film release (1993 Angelika Film Center in New York City for example), while also providing an English language version. I first saw the condensed 108 minute version years ago on VHS, and recently replaced it with the disk version of the same.
This uncondensed version certainly has more unedited material in the sex scenes (although the edited version was by no means completely devoid of sexual content). Just about every sexually based scene in the original OVA was edited for the condensed version. But censorship still exists in this unedited version as the more explicit shots are still shown with a ""fog"" or ""cloud"" effect - which varies from ineffective in most scenes, to rendering some shots almost impossible to view (such as when Akemi is actually impregnated with the seed that becomes the ""true overfiend"").  So this is by no means completely free of censorship - and I don't believe there was ever any version that was. There is one scene in particular with Magumi that didn't appear at all in the condensed version. Also this unedited version makes some of the story a bit more clear than the condensed version - such as the part about the great Kanto earthquake being caused by Suikakuju to prevent the rise of the Overfiend - this part is just kind of shoved into the condensed version, in this collection it is actually quite extended as the beginning of OVA episode two. As for the ""Legend of the Demon Womb"" OVA, again not dubbed into English, I didn't detect anything really that seemed to be cut from the English dubbed version. It seems to be the same. There was some censoring in this OVA version during the ""falling from the skyscraper"" scene that I didn't recall from the English dubbed version, but I haven't had or seen that version in some years ( I will probably purchase it again soon if I am able to find it). My one complaint about the Legend of the Demon Womb OVA is that it is virtually impossible to decipher the subtitles in the beginning of the film when they are speaking German. This is where the English dubbed version is preferable when it comes to The Legend of the Demon Womb. I bought this used for under 80.00 and had no issues with the quality - so If I were you I would not give some sellers the satisfaction of buying their new and unused versions for hundreds of dollars. The Perfect collection isn't worth a Perfect pickpocketing. When it comes to this collection settle for used -something less than perfect. I am very pleased with the purchase. I switched the box with one of the same dimensions, but having three disk mounts instead of two, and put my Legend of the Overfiend condensed English dubbed version in it. Now if I find the Demon Womb dubbed version I'll have to find a four mount disk box of the same dimensions and then I will have the Urotsukidoji complete and super perfect collection.",1481760000,4,3866,4.5706051873198845
8523067,5,B007Y5OYZ6,"Wow, the mother of all hentai anime, still the most shocking, and epic in it's possibly best format. It's about some nerd in highschool who is actually a demon called the Overfiend, that will destroy the world and build a new perfect world. Featuring the best demon designs, truly demonic acts of sadistic cruelty, sexually charged violence, and an epic feel on the order of ""Ten Commandments with tentacles"": this movie is more than just hentai. It actually delivers a surprising human tale, has excellent pacing, and direction. There is also a subplot of a man named Nikki who hates the main character and is turned into a demon by the demons to destroy the Overfiend. This part of the movie is incredibly relatable to anyone who has been abused and wished for power.
The character design and animation is dated but has surprising amounts of detail to it. The demonic depictions of hell and the monsters themselves are truly out of this world and have influenced every other anime and videogame desing since.
This set also includes the legend of the demon womb which is a side story of a Nikki like character but expanded to be it's own OVA. This one is good to with good animation and still kept the raw feeling of the original tale. Cool monsters scenes and enjoyable.

Now I'm going to go off the rails a bit because to really describe this movie I have to not follow proper grammar. People who have seen this have been horrified by the level of rape and violence often in the same scene. These things are shocking and distasteful but I can only tell you that everyone in this movie meets their reward for their actions. The ""bad guys"" are truly evil. You get to see why they should be despised and cheer when they get justice. Another aspect of this anime is that ""THERE IS NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT"".  Truly, I have never seen another anime like this or remembered it years later as something so forbiden, yet epic, and fantastic. The characters are surprisingly relateble and the plotline weaves them all in a tragic trajectory to the epic finale. If you get a chance to see this, you should if you can stomach it. It's amazing. Hopefully Kitty Media will re-release the perfect collection on Blu-ray some day to give it the respect it deserves.

There is a blu-ray version of the movie but it is highly censored and does not include the second OVA. There is also a third edition called Return of the Overfiend which is still pretty good although starting to veer off the main storyline. The fourth one ""Inferno Road"" was really terrible and almost feels like another anime completely so there is your breakdown.",1431993600,5,2615,4.619354838709677
8523068,5,B007Y5OYZ6,"What a film,,,,saw this when I was 16 and was SHOCKED and AMAZED....over the years I have really grown to really like the story line, very solid idea and the man the characters, dialogue and voice acting are super, not to mention the violence, action and sex!",1426118400,3,259,4.531914893617022
8523069,4,B007Y5OYZ6,"This is possibly the most important release of possibly the most notorious work of animation of all time. While this edition isn't 100% uncensored ... it's about 95% uncensored and features the original Japanese audio with English subtitles, which is so far the closest the west has ever come to officially releasing a proper edition of Urotsukidoji.

Still, I only gave this 4/5 because it needs to be digitally remastered and there are still some faint moments of censorship -- specifically, the use of 'fogging' during some explicit scenes -- albeit they are few and far between.

If marketed properly, a future edition of Urotsukidoji (digitally remastered, subtitled and completely uncut) could be a real money maker and attract some enormous crowds (from geeks to art critics). Hopefully, someone out there will make it happen",1397088000,12,832,5.155555555555556
8523070,5,B007Y5OYZ6,"This anime dvd is one of the best out there.  The scenes and everything was totally awesome, I would recommend this to anyone who loves demons and lots of steamy scenes.",1364774400,5,169,4.451612903225806
8523071,5,B007Y5OYZ6,Groundbreaking cartoon that doesn't hold back in any way shape or form. I highly reccomend it to any one into japanese adult animation.,1356566400,5,135,4.913043478260869
8523072,5,B007Y5OYZ6,"This is the grand father of all hard edge anime. It's a crying shame it's out of print, fetching such ridiculous prices for used copies floating around... Somebody should immediately re-issue these films, in their original, uncensored form, so new generations can enjoy them, experience this series that led the way for all the others in the genre.",1336348800,21,348,5.017241379310345
