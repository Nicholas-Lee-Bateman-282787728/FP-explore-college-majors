559275,4,6303102476,"and a good actress.  I saw this movie years ago on a Sunday afternoon when I was a kid and loved it.  Ms. Darnell was so stunning, and the story wasen't too corny.  She played a simple farm girl who had big ambitions.  If you can look past the men swaggering, calling each other out and the laughable ""Come here wench!"" dialogue, it's really kind of a modern woman wanting more for herself than what men think she should have and be happy with.  George Sanders is at his sarcastic, snippy and sleazy best, as the king.  Wish this was on DVD.  Enjoy!",1158192000,5,549,4.271844660194175
559276,2,6303102476,"I recently finished the 1944 book, giving it a 5-star rating.  I was intrigued when I discovered the movie.  It is roughly edited and the plot is very choppy.  I was glad that I had read the book prior to its viewing. There are too many characters with little to no background explanation or development(and they all look alike).  The storyline is abbreviated (leaving out major segments of the book and its plot development), but you do get some idea of the culture of King Charles II's court and times, and Amber's ""Me 1st attitude"" and total self-absorption. Not worth the buy, but rental an option for a rainy day.",1140134400,13,618,4.590909090909091

559278,3,6303102476,"Forever Amber is one of my favorite trashy great movies.  I remember vividly seeing it in original release as a small child in Cleveland Ohio.  Even then, the lavishly filmed story, with its memorable theme music, almost accurate costumes and exciting period detail, burned itself into my memory.  Darnell was surprisingly good as the ""forever under"" (a second title when the book came out, among wags) Amber, who's tail was for sale, as the book put it.  It is still fun to watch, the theater performance scenes at Drury Lane, among the most fun, as are the Restoration Court balls and of course, who can ever forget George Sanders' regal bearing as Charles II, and his adorable little ""children""--the--what else--King Charles spaniels that follow him everywhere.  The script is witty, Preminger's direction very daring for this time.  By all means watch it if you like a good old fashioned period drama, as only Hollywood could produce them in the days when details were real and not computer generated images.  I just wish they would issue a good digitally remastered DVD version with all that murkiness lightened up so it can be seen as it was released!  The Great Fire of London sequences, especially when Amber's evil old husband is thrown into the fire by that wonderful Italian giant of a manservant, and the Plague sequences, are also excellently filmed!  Watch it soon!",1090195200,52,1379,4.9094827586206895
559279,4,6303102476,"The naughty (and controversial) first novel by the much-publicized and photogenic Kathleen Winsor came out in 1944: it was an instant best-seller competing with the likes of Maugham's THE RAZOR'S EDGE & A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN by Betty Smith. It became THE top selling book of 1945 and eventually sold a total of over 3 million copies in both hardback and paperback versions. Linda Darnell plays Amber St. Clair, a poor English lass who sees promiscuity as the only way to wealth and happiness. Amber bed-hops her way through lovers Wilde, Russell and Langan and eventually winds up as the favourite concubine of Sanders, who plays King Charles II. But promiscuity has its price...The lavish 7 million dollar budget (which included lush Technicolor) was a sort of consolation prize: the film suffers from its inability to detail the eroticism of the source material - which gave the novel its distinction. Originally the English actress Peggy Cummins was cast (and partially filmed) as Ms. St. Clair, but it was decided that she wasn't quite right for the role. Regretfully, the beautiful Darnell was somewhat miscast as well: her performance is rather lacklustre and her naturally lovely looks were altered for the part by bleaching her raven-black hair an unsuitable blonde (they would do the same thing to Elizabeth Taylor - in 1949 - when she portrayed Amy in LITTLE WOMEN: neither actress looked particularly convincing as a blonde, somehow).",1031702400,37,1448,5.062761506276151
559280,3,6303102476,"This movie was *such* a disappointment, but then most movies are if you read the book first. One of my favorite books, Forever Amber captures the heart and soul of Amber, a 17th century village maid who scrambles her way to survival, power and fame while facing the challenge of a heart consistently broken by the one man she would die for: Bruce Carlton(even as she becomes mistress to the King himself!) The most powerful passages in the book (dealing with the plague; and her trip to America) are left out of this movie that I suppose just couldn't encompass the entire scope of the book, unfortunately. The most distasteful aspect for me, though, is the ending, which makes a judgment about Amber without the ending the book carries, which is Amber's triumph in spite of the judgments of others. It is a triumph of the spirit, and one that makes the book a classic read, though a forbidden one to those the age I fell in love with it: 15. I would love to see this movie remade in the true spirit in which the book was written. I would even like to take a crack at the screenplay!",1006300800,14,1083,4.42
559281,4,6303102476,"One of the most infamous ""trash"" novels of the 1940s was Kathleen Winsor's Forever Amber, the story of a beautiful but poor young woman (though of noble birth) who sleeps her way up the social ladder until  she becomes mistress of King Charles II of England. Her heart, however,  belongs only to the roguish Bruce Carleton, who continues to elude her at  every turn.
When 20th Century-Fox announced they were going to film the  book, howls of protest emerged from the Catholic Church and other  organizations devoted to film censorship. Undeterred, Fox went ahead with  the film--and what emerged was, surprisingly, a lavish, witty, and  bittersweet look at a daring young woman tripped up by her romantic  heart.
Originally, the lead role was to have been played by the young  British actress Peggy Cummins. (And actresses as diverse as Maureen O'Hara  and Angela Lansbury have admitted they had hoped to win the role.) After  filming began, however, Cummins was replaced by Linda Darnell, playing her  first lead role in a big-budget, prestigious picture. Darnell--a native of  Texas and nearly a ten-year veteran of the screen in 1947, although she was  only in her mid-20s--makes a memorable impression in the role. Her bearing  is regal, her accent (though not truly British) is cultured--and she is  spectacularly gorgeous in the many stunning gowns and hair-dos designed for  her.
The technical aspects of the film are also memorable. Director Otto  Preminger (he and Darnell never did get along well) makes effective use of  a sort of sooty, shadowy Technicolor; certain scenes resemble the paintings  of the 17th century. And David Raksin's majestic score is among the finest  ever written for a film, period.
I heartily recommend Forever Amber!",960940800,106,1754,5.08421052631579
559282,5,6303102476,"I have seen this movie only once....probably 25 years ago.  This was one of the best movies I had ever seen (right up there with Gone With The Wind).

559406,3,6303102476,"Forever Amber is my favorite of all the books I have ever read.  I asked my daughter for the DVD for a Christmas present this year.  I am not going to rehash the story as you have either read the book or have seen the movie.  I do have my comments though. When I unwrapped the DVD there was a sticker on the back that was in Chinese so figured they must have reproduced the DVD overseas.  How much could it cost to reproduce DVDs in America? I was glad the movie was in English as I was concerned about the Chinese sticker on the back as I did not know if the movie was in Chinese or English.

My next concern was the length of the movie.  It was 2 hours 10 minutes.  Having read and relished every word and scene I was concerned that this version (only version) was too short to do the novel justice.  I was correct.  That is why the movie got 3 stars instead of 5.  They need to re-shoot the movie, as it is a classic IMO, and scenes were either cut out or too short to do the novel justice.  I would like to see a remake of this movie and/or a 2 day miniseries.  The movie should be at least 3 1/2 hours or a 4 hour movie.

Make-up, hairstyles and period clothing were excellent.  I thought the scenes were visually too dark during much of the film.  The bubonic plague,  fire of London, debtors prison, and marriage to the Earl seemed to be cut very short to fit it into this film and therefore did not do justice to the novel. My last comment was the end of the film.  It has been many years since I read Forever Amber but the story does not end with Bruce walking out with his son down the driveway.  One of the best parts of the story was the ending to the novel which they did not include in the film.",1451260800,,1709,4.005917159763314

I still loved it and so did my daughters. Often compared as a Gone with the Wind knock off,  I like it much better than that hit that bores me.  I actually saw someone post that Linda Darnell wasn't as beautiful as Scarlett,  are you kidding me!  She is incredible. I am amazed how this is still a hard to find little gem of a film.

Unfortunately, her first man that she meets in the outside world is a privateer and frankly, not that interested in her.  However, she doesn't understand that and when he abruptly leaves her, she tries to figure out ways of making it in London society.  She ends up defrauded of her money and imprisoned in Newgate.  She is able to get out via Blackjack and then she finds more loves along the way, eventually, ending up as the mistress to the King of England.  However, her unrequited love returns and takes their son back to Virginia, leaving her all alone.  The main flaw of the movie is somehow we don't end up really caring for any of the characters.

559576,2,6303102476,"The Almighty did not give people eyes to read that rubbish!  so spaketh Australias right honorable Minister for Customs, Senator Keane upon the 1944 publication of Kathleen Winsors Forever Amber; an incendiary novel set during the 1644 revolt in English parliament and spanning many tumultuous years under the reign of Charles II. Winsor could afford to bask in the fervor her book had inspired. Over 100,000 copies sold within the first week; the eventual tally of 3 million, by the time Keane and the Catholic Church had had their say, doing little to stop its runaway success. In fact, it probably helped.  Nothing appeals quite so much to the general public as sin  particularly viewed from the strictures of button-down conservatism run amuck.

Indeed, not even the widespread condemnation of the novel as pornography in fourteen U.S. states could prevent it from becoming a best seller.  Winsors fifth draft caught the eye of publishers, though they elected to distill her prose to one-third their original size, the novel still sporting a formidable girth of 972 pages.  Still, contained within them were references  or, at least inferences  attesting to seventy acts of intercourse, thirty-nine illegitimate pregnancies, seven abortions and ten rather blatant descriptions of women undressing in front of menshocking! In her own defense, Winsor was to reply some years later, I wrote only two sexy passages and my publishers took both of them out. They put in ellipses instead. In those days, you know, you could solve everything with an ellipsis.

By todays laissez faire standards, allegations of smut are laughable. Forever Amber is nothing if a well-written and expertly concocted pulp about a womans desire supplanted  and ultimately destroyed by her own folly. Implied or not, Forever Amber comes from a particular ilk in historical romantic fiction perhaps having reached its zenith with Margaret Mitchells Gone With The Wind. In the wake of Mitchells zeitgeist and, of course, Selznicks immortalized and celebrated movie version, other studios began to scramble for like-minded fare; tales of headstrong female protagonists defying the social conventions of their time  and occasionally, also the wisdom of their male superiors  to bring about scandal and reformation; though ultimately wreck and ruin upon their own heads. Such was the tortured suffering of the fictionalized female martyr; ringing truer still to the American woman circa 1942 and beyond. As the menfolk went off to fight in another war, the home front became a bastion for the pursuit of meaningful work outside of the home. Hence, the independent woman rising above squalid circumstances by her wit and stubbornness alone proved an elixir of the times.

Alas, Forever Amber presented Darryl F. Zanuck with a considerable quandary. For the novels Amber St. Clair was something of a truly unrepentant harpy; deliciously vial in spots and maliciously inclined to stir mens hearts to her own advantage, whatever the sacrifices made along the way. In some ways, Amber and Scarlett OHara are kissing cousins; although it is unlikely either could have been friends: too much similarity and competition. Translating the book to the screen also presented deeper concerns. How to tell the tale of an enterprising creature who effectively wenches her way into Charles IIs court, gives birth out of wedlock, murders a nurse and is responsible for the death of at least two men  one, her lover, the other her husband. Surely, Hollywood censors would objectand did! To be sure, Winsors novel counterbalances such overt debaucheries with selfless acts of human sacrifice; Ambers devotion to Bruce Carlton; the heroic officer who cannot recognize her qualities beyond a brief nights interlude, resulting in a child; her never waning devotion to him (nursing Bruce back from the plague) despite her frequent dalliances with courtiers and the King.

Zanuck was forced by the Production Code to omit virtually all of the novels more salacious moments. As a result, Otto Premingers Forever Amber (1947) became something of a sissified wan ghost flower of its source material, the emasculation utterly complete by the casting of fresh-faced Linda Darnell as the fiery and uncompromising vixen; herein more prone to sulking and skulking about the antechambers and bedrooms of some well-heeled suitors.  Screenwriters Philip Dunne and Ring Lardner Jr. did their utmost to suggest the tawdry appeal of the novel; their efforts submarined by Zanucks inability to spend as lavishly as he would have preferred. Hitherto, the novels reputation as a provocative page-turner had also begun to cool. Although Zanucks publicity department gave the movie a big build-up, Forever Amber was something of a modest success to meager disappointment for the studio.

Removed from all of its timely hype, Forever Amber  the movie  is a fairly enjoyable romp, never entirely prone to bouts of tedium, though occasionally veering dangerously close to becoming a wordy critique on classicist social mores, vices and virtues. Moodily lit and photographed by cinematographer, Leon Shamroy, exquisitely scored by David Raksin, and, given over to the visual aplomb of production designer, Lyle Wheeler and costumer, Ren Hubert, Forever Amber emerged as something of a lush and lovely, eye-popping spectacle; Foxs trademarked use of Technicolor at its most gaudy and glistening, yields to a ravishing milieu that tragically and singularly fails to enthrall.

Perhaps audiences of the day expected better  or at least  more of the novels combustible and scintillating ardor. The movie equally suffers from the miscasting of Linda Darnell and Cornel Wilde; two undeniably handsome people who fail to generate the elusive spark of on-screen chemistry to make their passionate love affair click. It doesnt help the screenplay keeps its lovers apart for the bulk of the films138 minute run time. While Darnell is in virtually every scene, Wilde floats in and out of the story  each time with a little more abject contempt and self-righteous piety for our sexually adventurous heroine.

On paper, Forever Amber is a fairly ambitious and compelling tale of a womans self-destruction, made wholly and unnecessarily complete her ill-fated lifes decisions. On film, however, the plight of Amber St. Clair becomes little more than rank melodrama, gussied up by A-list production values. The Dunne/Lardner screenplay does an impressive job of distilling the novels timeline into a manageable would-be epic. At 138 minutes, Forever Amber falls short of the road show spectacle Zanuck had originally envisioned, in part, because the movies rough cut was eviscerated in the editing process at the behest of the Production Code: whole scenes excised and/or reshot to receive its approval. Zanucks clashes with the code are legendary. In hindsight, his reoccurring battles on Forever Amber, having to veer so far away from the novel in order to make any movie based upon it, were a primary reason Zanuck would later cite for leaving Fox at its zenith to make pictures independently abroad. If Forever Amber lacks narrative impetus or character motivation, it is arguably the fault of Zanucks inability to win his battles with censorship rather than Zanucks fervent desire and meticulous pre-planning to transform the novel into a screen spectacle on par with Gone With The Wind.

Sadly, Forever Amber is no Gone With The Wind, despite its all-star cast and the immeasurable gifts bestowed upon its production by those toiling being the scenes. Whats there is always expertly crafted, if leadenly realized by Linda Darnell and Cornel Wilde. Curiously, Darnell seems reticent to portray the sultry Amber in all her ruthless objectives. Darnell was hardly a stranger to playing the vixen as she had already amply proven with Chihuahua in John Fords My Darling Clementine (1946) and would illustrate again, as Lora May Hollingsway two years after Amber for Joe Mankewicz in A Letter to Three Wives (1949). As Amber Darnell is stiff and uninspired: pitiably nervous at times too and simpering to a fault. Amber ought to have been a fiery wench who could either gingerly cut her teeth on any mans heart or trample it into the ground. Darnells viper is little more than a wounded lamb in wolfs clothing; lost, confused and totally out of her depth.

Cornel Wildes career has always fascinated me. Here is a man who rarely rises above his material, and frequently pandered to the crowd by unabashedly displaying the obviousness of his own physical prowess as compensation. Even in his own time, hunks were considered a dime a dozen; rarely given the opportunity to progress beyond B-grade matinee idol. By comparison, Wildes career is downright enviable, playing everything from a flamboyant trapeze artist (The Greatest Show on Earth 1952) to Frdric Chopin (A Song to Remember 1945). Along the way, he appeared opposite an enviable roster of A-list leading ladies and worked for some of Hollywoods biggest directors. To what fairy godmother does the actor owe his career? Hmmm. In Forever Amber, Wilde seems moderately hampered by his effete wig; given shoulder pads that would make Dynastys Joan Collins envious. Hes competent - though just barely and mostly forgettable and flat. Forever Amber would have immensely benefited from the presence of a Clark Gable or William Holden. But Wilde was under contract to Zanuck, so we get his particular brand of mediocrity instead.

Mediocre is a good way of describing Fox Home Videos efforts on their MOD DVD program in totem. I have avoided reviewing their burn-on-demand product thus far because, frankly, some of the discs Ive seen coming down that pipeline have turned my stomach; Cinemascope movies presented in non-anamorphic or pan and scan transfers, elements culled from old VHS or 16mm archives slapped out to disc without so much as a generic clean-up; non-progressive and badly faded video (rather than film) based elements, et al. Yuck and who needs it?!? So, it was with some trepidation I undertook to screen Forever Amber; oddly, the first transfer I am prepared to write about without making myself physically ill.

As we all know by now, Fox junked its original Technicolor separation masters for virtually all their product pre-1970, leaving badly contrasted and garishly undernourished Eastman transfers as the only resource from which to do further remasterings of classic titles. It is important to remember also that, though this is a travesty akin to painting a black moustache across the Mona Lisa, weve also borne witness to what the studio can do when time and money are correctly spent to resurrect and properly update tired old transfers in 1080p; Niagara (1953) being a prime (though not the only) example.

Alas, Forever Amber is not a Blu-ray. Nor is it a legitimately authored DVD, but rather a burn-on-demand disc that, at times, Id consider nothing better than a Frisbee. Remarkably, most of the image is free of age-related artifacts. Not so remarkable is the clumpy, chalky color. In no way does Forever Amber even minutely hint to replicating vintage Technicolor. On occasion, the color genuinely pops with surprising sparkle. I was amazed by the scenes at court, where color suddenly became exceptionally vibrant. Alas, a fair amount of Forever Amber takes place at night and these sequences suffer from lower than average contrast. There are moments where only disembodied heads are discernable, floating in a sea of blackness. There are also some misalignment problems with the Technicolor, resulting in very annoying halos. Certain scenes are very softly focused. Badly done.

As expected, fine detail is wanting, though not uniformly.  Finally, the Fox logo appearing at the beginning of Forever Amber is not indigenous to the period  but rather from a vintage owing to the late 70s and significantly grainier than the rest of the image that follows. Regarding film grain  its virtually non-existent. True, Technicolor was a sort of grain concealing process. But this just looks scrubbed  either digitally or, presumably, from being derived from an older video master made when VHS was king and things like film grain were a non-issue.  Finally, theres modest gate weave factored in and some sprocket damage that causes certain scenes to wobble.

Forever Ambers original mono audio has been faithfully reproduced with minimal hiss and virtually no pop  impressive on the whole. Alas, Fox hasn't given us ANY extras. I could forgive this  almost  if Fox had taken the time to encode the disc properly so its time stamp wouldnt periodically appear. Alas, no chapter stops either, though one can advance at ten minute intervals throughout this disc. Bottom line: Im going to do some heavy praying the people in charge of Foxs MOD program get their act together - and soon - instead of continuing to release substandard product like this to home video and just hope the rest of us haven't figured it out just yet. To Fox executives responsible for this travesty: you're winning no points simply by making such drivel available in lieu of quality. Not recommended.",1403481600,4,13161,5.18426013195099

Greene never got the acclaim he deserved and is best remembered today as playing ROBIN HOOD on TV.  George Sanders more or less steals the picture as the King.

Amber used her stunning good looks to manipulate wealthy men into taking her on as a mistress or wife.  If she was attached to man A and a wealthier or more powerful man B came along, she would use her charms to become attached to man B.  She did this almost automatically and without remorse.  Women like my wife who cannot stand to watch other women shown in that light will probably hate the movie.  I saw it as illustrating why I did not remain interested in women I dated who resembled Amber on a more amateur stage.  I failed to see it as an example for young women to follow by copying Amber.  Toward the movie's end, the extent to which Amber was punished for her ways should suggest to young women how to avoid becoming a super loser in life.

Carroll) flees to London to make her fortune. Though in love with one man (Cornel Wilde), a profiteer on the seas for the King, she sleeps her way to top of court society until she becomes the King's mistress. Based on the ""scandalous"" best seller (it was banned in fourteen states and condemned by the Catholic church) by Kathleen Windsor, it's hard to see what all the fuss was about based on resultant and considerably cleaned up Otto Preminger film. What we end up with is a colorful costumer about an ambitious vixen and while the heroine is a ""wicked"" slut, as played by the appealing Darnell, you can't help but like her. Still, all in all it's too tasteful when it should be a bit more naughty or, yes, even vulgar. I mean when you have a sexy wench manipulating those around her and sleeping her way to the top, it should more fun, no? And Darnell could have used a livelier leading man than Wilde who seems too enervated here. The plague and great fire of London sequences are handled very nicely.

She's not half as lusty or ambitious, prone to debauchery, and calculating as depicted in the novel. They altered the ending too. In the novel, after Amber's confrontation with Bruce's wife, Bruce's feelings for her completely dissipated and was replaced with disgust as he soon realizes what Amber had become (and so had Almsbury). Amber, in the end, was wealthy, ridiculously wealthy, titled...but with no true friends left. The novel ended with her making plans to leave for America, still intent on chasing after Bruce-an empty dream of no substance. The film's ending wasn't as powerful as the novel's ending, with Amber's downfall (yet, she still doesn't realize it).

She missed many opportunities for happiness because of her greed; she simply wanted too much, and in the end she still doesn't realize that the money and the titles were not worth very much. Her character did not evolve at all, did not experience any growth...a reason why Bruce refuses to marry her. He once said that Amber was a woman a man would rather have as a mistress than a wife; Amber is beautiful and lusty, which are good qualities in a mistress, but at the same time she's greedy, ambitious, unfaithful, calculating, manipulative.. etc. etc.

This sedate version of Forever Amber doesn't do the novel justice; what made the novel memorable for me was Amber's character, how risque the novel was, and the ending, all of which the film fails to capture.

Linda Darnell they claim did not get along with Preminger, but he cast her numerous times like other actors who later became his customary ""whipping post"" on each subsequent film that allowed themselves to later join the cast of another Preminger film (notably Tom Tryon who was ""destroyed"" during the making of ""The Cardinal"" but appeared several years later in ""In Harm's Way."")

Based on Kathleen Winsor's lush and scandalous (at the time) book, this film is a beautiful example of Technicolor spectacle at its finest. Sadly, the DVD version advertised here (the only way to see this film on DVD) appears to have been minted from a VHS copy, and a poor one at that. The film was censored and trimmed almost beyond repair before its release, and this print (like the existing VHS copies) eliminates the final scene, in which Amber accepts the invitation of King Charles' secretary to be his mistress, and the opening prologue, in which it was promised Amber would ""pay"" for her casual sexuality. The image itself is muddy, often too dark to see in night scenes, and grainy, so I'd advise DVD buyers to think carefully before spending too much money on it. The movie itself would rate five solid stars: it's not a towering masterpiece, but it is a wonderful example of forties style and excess. The DVD, unfortunately, is a letdown, and some fans may wish to wait for a full restoration, and hold on to their existing VHS tapes. NOTE: Amazon also sells a REGION 2 DVD of this film which has a much superior print, but one needs a region 2 player to watch it, of course. Be aware a better print is out there, but might be harder to see in America. UPDATE: In 2014, a Fox Archives edition of the film was released on DVD, with a picture that is vastly superior to the existing VHS and DVD copies currently available. Sadly, the film's original ending, in which Amber begins her climb up the social ladder, is still missing, and this excellent print does cut off with the shot of Linda Darnell at the window of Whitehall palace. Hopes are dim that the movie will ever be fully restored or released on Blu-Ray: it doesn't seem to have the following that would precipitate such decisions.

The violin and cello solos are heartbreakingly beautiful. Surely it's worth seeing the film for the music alone.",1176681600,4,428,4.876712328767123

7837355,4,6303102476,"The movie is very true to the book which has become one of my most favorite. The book is way out of print, but very worth the effort to purchase. Be forewarned, it is quite a tome. But I love long book.
The movie would have been absolutely stunning if most of the background wasn't dull and gray.
Linda Darnell is excellent, but I wasn't too keen on the actor they chose for her main lover.
This was quite risque' when the book was written in the early 1940's.
I tried to read her other book, ""Star Money"" but couldn't get interested in it because I didn't like the character.
The art of this book and movie is like Gone With the Wind. The main character does all kinds of either immoral or unethical things, but you still route for them.
I also didn't get how her hair was different shades of red all the way through the movie.
I sure wish they would re-publish the book and re-make the movie.
It had to take a very long time to write this book, and it makes me wonder if she wrote this before or after she read Gone With the Wind. It was like GWTW in London's high society with Charles II many centuries ago.
The book is as good as GWTW, not the movie.",1488067200,2,1154,4.133333333333334
