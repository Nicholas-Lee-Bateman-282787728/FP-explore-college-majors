6729467,4,B00O8SIA3E,"Well, people call it a true original film but I see it not all original since there is <RUBY SPARKS> and <STRANGER THEN FICTION> already.
Meaning?
The story is about this blind woman who is not satistied about here husband creates her own enviornment and charactors through writing and sometimes she even got confused between what is real and what is fantasy.
And it involves her sexual desire too.
Usually we seek for the main charactor to be pretty. But this woman is not all pretty. She is just plain.
Nothing to be fall in love type.
She is not sexy either. She is maybe in her late 40. Her shape is crushing down. We see this by when she is showing her naked body.

She creates this young woman who's got a child and an ex and this man who lives alone who is crazy about sex videos and constantly peaks on his neighbour - young woman who's got a child and an ex.
She even makes the young women a blind one all of a sudden. She is confused to be a blind since it was so sudden.

The movie is about loneliness above all since this blind woman is staying in her apartment all her life after becoming blind. 24 hours she doesn't even want to go out.
Even when her hudband want her to join her to go to some place together.
She has to do something and she choose to write and imagine things.

What makes this movie keep watching is the motif of her loneliness and how she manage to live her daily life.
It is not her creation world that really matters.
It is her face expression, some serious, some humorous. It is her joke to her husband - for example doing this thing that makes sound to show what color of each objects are. She puts that machine to her husband's ass and the machine says baby skin color.

The music is good and helps the movie to be more enjoyable.

We don't have a lot of chance to watch Norway movies and this is the one maybe you should.",1465171200,,1860,4.184357541899441

6729470,4,B00O8SIA3E,"Interesting first feature by acclaimed Norwegian screenwriter Eskil Vogt who has worked with Joachim Trier( Oslo,1st August [2011]) about a beautiful blonde woman Ingrid(Petersen)who has just gone blind. It is an exploration about identity, reality vs. fiction, what the world looks like vs ones memory of the world. With the loss of control comes withdrawal into ones own mind space, then imagination as reality, with a dialogue between fantasies, desires and fears. How can one adapt to this new reality and who can one trust? Does her partner smile when he sees her, does he find her attractive, is he unfaithful, is he watching her in secret? Her inner life is explored through her telling stories on her laptop, of infidelity and online pornography from her paranoia and anxieties about her relationship with her architect husband,Morten. The visual conception of the scenes is complicated when reality and fiction( she creates two characters,Elin[Vitali] and Einar[Kolbenstvedt]) merge with Ingrid and Morten. These are alternate versions of herself and her husband. Her husband especially gets to meet Elin, a blonde single mother, having an online affair and sex with her. He also gets to meet Einar, an old friend,though theyve lost touch. Einar is a slob and watches a lot of online porn; he also spies on his neighbour Elin. He also chats her up.

Vogt films the loneliness of human beings, cut off from reality and relationships like Einar, and Ingrid through her loss of sight, incapable of establishing a mutual relationship with her husband, unable to share her inner thoughts with him. He also depicts the solitude of the writer. She inflicts blindness on Elin and we get to see the effect on her relationship with Morten. What is presented as real is not always really
happening, so that the scenery around people changes during their meeting or the landscape and furnishings of the flat Ingrid lives in changes, at times becoming bare. The best part of the film is when Ingrid is just alone in her flat. She expresses her inmost feelings by pressing herself nakedly against the window pane or walks on tip toes trying to touch the ceiling,or listens to a track of music on her laptop. She tries to wipe up something shes spilt, or she picks out each background sound and reacts. Hofstedes score follows the rhythm of her thoughts. Bakatakis's (Dogtooth)s cinematography uses natural light, and gives a pale wash over many scenes. There are some playful and humorous bits in this journey of self-rediscovery. Not fully articulated but well conceived.",1439769600,6,2567,5.025821596244131
6729471,4,B00O8SIA3E,"Ingrid has lost her sight and has taken to being a recluse in her apartment where she feels safe removed from what she once knew. Her husband is appearing to become more and more distant and she is alone in a World where she feels she will never go outside again- spending her days in front of a window with a view she will never see.

Now if that isn't bad enough she also fantasizes about what could happen and the film can be a bit surreal at times. There is also a fair bit of porn on show here and some nudity - but they are incidental themes and not the main thrust of the film.

We have lots of imagined moments and one is often left bewildered as to what has actually happened. As a study in the mental anguish of being blind - you would have to have experienced it yourself to be able to comment. As a visual representation of being blind it does come across as both relevant and moving. In Norwegian with good sub titles - this runs to 91 minutes; this is a good and well made film, but it will be far from everyone's cup of tea and you should avoid totally if you are looking for anything even slightly in the realms of a `feel good' film.",1439424000,9,1150,4.084070796460177

8682617,3,B00O8SIA3E,"No wonder that guy went mad, killing more than 70 people (which the director treats in the film) with a high powered rifle as they swam for their lives.

Norway is an incredibly lonely society, dark and terribly gloomy more than half the year.

In this matrix of doom and gloom Einaar lives, masturbating to porn and going to movies by himself.  He lives on the fringes of society, as an example of how dysfunctional modern life can be.

Then there is Ingrid, the star of this movie, a woman who loses her sight and chooses to hole up in her apartment.  Her husband, meanwhile, finds a woman amvia the internet.  He has sex with her right after she manages to go blind.  This actress, whose name escapes me but goes by the moniker Elin in the movie, does an amazing job of acting blind (actually, Ingrid, the main star, does too).  Einaar, the lonely guy, manages to hit on her too.

Anyway, this is a story of infidelity and loneliness, and love trangles and what have you, set in ultra expensive Norway.

Three stars, Rick says check it out if you wish to see a couple of sighted people faking blindness, and if you have little else to do.",1510876800,,1141,4.390476190476191

8682620,3,B00O8SIA3E,Watched entire film simply to see if there was a point to it .. don't think there was. It is a film about two women coping with lose of eyesight abused by two creeps . The film also  jumps forward across time at a different rates for the two women. Maybe this was intentional but probably just poor editing.,1493424000,,307,4.203389830508475
