Storage (2009) *** / 4
D: Michael Craft
C: Matthew Scully, Robert Mammone, Saskia Burrmeister, Damien Garvey
P: After the death of his father, a young man (Scully) moves in with his uncle and starts a job at an underground storage facility, but his suspicions quickly arise as to what one of his customers is up to after witnessing the customer put a gun in his storage unit.

On a technical level, Storage takes what could have potentially been a very drab looking setting and gives it a strong visual appeal, a striking look that manages to effectively portray the menace and eeriness of the film's principal location. The cast is solid, but newcomer Matthew Scully is the one who stands out. He's a charming, boyish lead, a breath of fresh air. However, what stands out first and foremost about Storage is the film's story.

Storage is one of those films that sneaks up on you, one of those films that takes you by surprise. You go in thinking you have it all figured out, but then Storage goes off in unexpected directions with a twisty, unpredictable story. Thankfully, Storage keeps in mind plausibility and character motivation while weaving its story, which makes the film's various twist and turns work. Storage is one of those film where the less you know about going in, the better. So with that in mind, I won't dare give away the film's secrets. I will say, that Storage is an underrated, under appreciated, under seen gem that got lost in the crowd, but is worthy of being re-discovered by horror fans.

Between Craft and cinematographer Tony Luu, you're treated to great lighting and an amazing opening title sequence.  The film, more of a psychological thriller than a horror flick, is the first I can remember that is set in a storage facility.  So in addition to great visuals, you're presented with an original story for once.

I was happy with Aussie actor Damien Garvey's performance as Uncle Leonard, and also with Robert Mammone as the dark and mysterious client Francis.  The exceptionally hot Saskia Burmeister made a nice addition to the skeleton crew cast, though I wasn't impressed with the casting of Matthew Scully (his first real film) as our lead character.

The first half of the film is unpredictable, and keeps you intrigued.  But as the movie nears its conclusion, it's not difficult to see where the film is headed, and that's why I'm giving it three stars instead of four.  Despite being able to guess how it will probably end, there are definitely a few ""I didn't see that coming"" moments that made the movie worth watching.

So check this movie out for the great visuals, a totally original story, and a few shocking surprises.",1268179200,,1392,4.7866108786610875
