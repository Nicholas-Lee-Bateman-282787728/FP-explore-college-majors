7919030,5,B00003M5HE,"This whole ""MISS WORLD"" pageant that is perfectly documented from start to finish that is center on in this flick set's the bar for demented. I LOVE IT... kept me glued to my seat. It's sick... and it's wrong... and it's the most entertaining thing I've seen in a long time.",1522108800,,274,4.392156862745098

7919032,5,B00003M5HE,"Before ""Rupaul's Drag Race"" and all the legendary balls in NYC, there was the ""Alternative Miss World"" pageant. A wonderfully funny, creative, and provocative drag contest from 1978 London (with Divine as the cherry on the cake of the celebration). A little raunchy but a whole lot of fun! Pay attention children, this is drag history!",1437696000,,335,5.0
7919033,5,B00003M5HE,"Divine and Nell Campbell are only two small components of this ultra-camp glamour fest.  The names of some other mentionable performers/contestants: Miss Piss, Miss Windscale Nuclear Reactor, Miss Carriage (Miss Linda Carriage) and the ever lovely Miss Peru.  You've gotta get up pretty early in the morning and bone up on your Pop Culture from the late '70's to appreciate this one!  If you're one of those lucky fanatics of Camp metaphor you'll be in heaven.
Beauty Queen is Dragumentory par excellence!  This is not a Divine movie, though she does lend her considerable girth as the ""contest's"" Mistress of Ceremonies.  A punch in the face to all ""Beauty Contests"" and a perfect expose' on the excesses of the '70's entertainment/gay subculture.  It's British so the humor is more viscerally well-placed than in-your-face.  You've gotta hunt through this one but it's worth it for the divine social metaphor it presents.
It's not perfect, but it's perfect for you!  Don't look for production quality here anymore than you would in ""Eat Your Makeup"".  Look for stunning Beauty Contestants, A perfectly droll and esoterically dry and irreverent running commentary from two ""reporters"" of the event and a winning Beauty Queen riding on a Donkey with hysterical results.
A perfect picture for any self respecting counter-culture cynic!
You are what you eat!",1013299200,5,1356,5.155251141552512
