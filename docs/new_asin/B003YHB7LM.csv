8409287,4,B003YHB7LM,"Zurich Condoll (Trevor Jackson) aka number 4 is pledging Lambda Fraternity at Frederick Douglas University. The hazing process is all underground since it has been outlawed. It is very physical and humiliating. Zurich has trouble maintaining his studies and the hazing after taking several kicks to the rib on the first night. The hazing also weighs heavily on his personal life, but being a part of group of a-holes is all he wants. Quitters walk home.

There is a message in the film. ""If there is no struggle, there is no progress."" However when the message is applied to a physical hazing, it leaves much to be desired. Acting wasn't that great. The film is about message which could have been better developed.

Guide: F-word. Sex. No nudity. 3 1/2 stars",1491868800,,759,4.786259541984733

8409289,1,B003YHB7LM,I watched it and it was really fake. Did not show anything that I wanted to know. It was not very informative. I guess it goes by just going through the process,1403827200,,160,4.03125

8409291,4,B003YHB7LM,"if you're thinking about pledging (or what to determine why you shouldn't), then this movie may be helpful to you.",1388361600,,114,4.75
8409292,5,B003YHB7LM,Its not meant to be a movie its a documentary and its purpose is to inform. I think it did well.,1364688000,2,96,3.619047619047619
8409293,1,B003YHB7LM,"Let me just say that I didn't have high hopes for this film, but I'm glad I watched it alone before I made a fool of myself and watched it with others. This is a terribly constructed film from start to finish. You could find similarly made films on youtube for free--and you might get more out of them!",1301011200,10,302,4.135593220338983
