5928179,5,B00ENFS0FK,This has my fave episode on it. Tess gets Altzheimer's.  Her work in that role is so touching.  This episode is also quite uplifting if you or a loved one are facing this terrible disease. I also found it quite thought provoking on the topic of aging in general.,1385683200,,262,4.326530612244898
5928180,4,B00ENFS0FK,"I just received this and started to watch it.  I may be premature to judge it this early, but so far the plots are not as good as the earlier years.  However, it is still inspirational and a wonderful alternative to most of what is on TV.",1385596800,,238,4.042553191489362
5928181,5,B00ENFS0FK,I love touched by and Angel. And with this set I now have the complete set. And with this final set I am looking forward to watching all of the dvd's.,1385510400,,150,3.870967741935484
5928182,5,B00ENFS0FK,"Mandy & his GLORIOUS, GOD-GIVEN voice was always my favorite portion of the entire series.  Every time I watch it, I want to (and frequently do) cry.  I haven't bought any of the series, yet.  My finances, in this economy, are waiting for it to become available to Prime Instant video members.  If I could afford it, I'd get it now!

5928183,5,B00ENFS0FK,"Having been warmed through our southern winter by Touched By An Angel The Eighth Season, I think I need cooling down now with this announcement of The Ninth and Final Season.  Thank you so So SO much CBS Paramount and Amazon for this perfect Christmas gift.  I so look forward to reliving the heartwrenching two part ""Remembering Me""; ""As It Is In Heaven"" (featuring a compellingly beautiful performance by Lesley Ann Warren); Wynonna Judd's outstanding  performance as she brings her character's storyline to a conclusion in ""At The End Of The Aisle""; and the fan favourite ""I Will Walk With You"".  Although there can never be another tv series quite like Touched By An Angel, fans who were hooked when it first went to air, PLUS, a whole new generation can now be ""Touched"" by the fact that the complete series is now available to enjoy for many years to come.",1379376000,14,862,4.688741721854305
5928184,5,B00ENFS0FK,"I started watching this show starting in season 3 and caught up as the series went on, and as the years went by I never missed an episode. When this show finally ended (w/ me in never-ending tears during the finale), I was heartbroken, but I had recorded each and every episode on CBS and all the reruns that I didn't have on PAX TV, but that was back when VHS was still popular, so when this beloved series finally made it's way onto DVD, you can bet how excited I was! Until season 4 was released all those years ago and then it just...stopped. Every time fans tried to figure out when the remaining 5 seasons would be released, all we got back where, ""They probably won't."" I was more then disappointed, I was livid. This show was the only show on TV back in the day that was wholesome family TV, a show you could watch safely w/ your family and a show that ended much too soon and one that had a huge, supportive fanbase, so to hear we might not get the remaining seasons...you can only imagine what I was feeling.

Until last year when suddenly, out of the blue, season 5 was released and just a few months after that, season 6 and so on and so forth and now, in just 3 months, the final season will be out and I couldn't be happier! :) Thank you so much for giving this to us, those that are still fans of this series (myself included) are incredibly grateful that these have been released in such a timely manner.",1377648000,4,1420,4.201465201465202
5928185,5,B00ENFS0FK,"After such a long hiatus, I was beginning to doubt we'd get the entire series. I'm so glad I was proven wrong! No other show touched me like one does! Thank you CBS and Paramount for making my favorite show available!",1377043200,14,217,4.317073170731708

5928188,1,B00ENFS0FK,I have only watched the first dvd but the color is awful and the sound quality is bad. It has a constant buzzing during all episodes. Disappointing,1506729600,,147,4.481481481481482
5928189,5,B00ENFS0FK,All of the Touched By an Angel seasons are excellent.  Morals and kindness as well as unexpected outcomes in every episode.  Struggles and triumphs that you are sure to have experienced yourself at one time in life.  We love these DVDs and have every season.  This show ran for 9 seasons!,1506038400,,288,4.588235294117647

5928191,5,B00ENFS0FK,"I no longer watch this on TV because well, I don't know. Thank you for offering this DVD series. I bought the last season because the last two episodes were by far the best. Monica standing up for God, our father not knowing his face tougher my heart.

Now my collection is complete, as i will treasure this forever. :) Although i do wish they put some bonus features on the final season dvd. Like outtakes (Nobody is prefect all the time when acting. I'm sure even the actors/actresses have their trip up lines sometimes, before the final take) or a special message from the cast in crew, or even a backstory on how Touched By An Angel was created. We had 9 years of this show, and kind of would like to have something special for the final season dvd. Just something. But still am glad that CBS took the time and released all 212 episodes onto DVD so that we can watch re-runs whenever we want to now.",1417219200,4,705,4.30827067669173

5928265,3,B00ENFS0FK,"I recently checked this out from our library to see if I wanted to purchase it. Hmmmm, I never saw any of the 9th season, but I think other viewers touched on this...it just doesn't have the punch or pizazz of the other seasons. The story lines, were average, not spectacular. The last 2 part story just wasn't a good send off for a series that had been highly inspirational. I found it to be a huge let down, strange, and not very representational of what the show portrayed in previous episodes. And on the last season dvd, why isn't their any extra features, quite baffling. After 9 seasons, they could SAY anything about it???? Ok, and why did Carol Burnett do the sound bite intro for the last one, that was unusual, and out of no where.",1400457600,,742,4.384057971014493

5928271,4,B00ENFS0FK,"Today,I received  my first copy of the Touched By An Angel Season 9 dads. It's such a wonderful show I gave it four stars, but I've waited for so many years, and there are absolutely no extras.....you'd think they would include at least one or two interviews of cast and crew that are not on the first season. (I have that already.) I mean they made us wait for ten years, and probably would never have got these released had it not been for the millions of loyal fans bugging them.  Still I am a big fan of the show. I love Roma Downey, I think what she's doing with the new theatrical movie,Son of God, is wonderful. I wish her and the whole cast of Touched By An Angel (minus John Dye, who died in 2011) well and lots of love and blessings in the future.",1395964800,4,757,4.142857142857143

5928274,5,B00ENFS0FK,"If possible, each season of ""Touched By An Angel"" gets better than the last. The angels are placed in real-life, exceptionally tough situations (taken from blends of true stories), there to support and help guide people through some of the hardest things life can throw at them. Each episode's story line is impactful and the acting is excellent.

These are emotional, first rate productions that entertain as they teach, and leave you filled with a very real hope.  I cannot recommend them enough. We bought ALL seasons and never tire of replays. They are THAT good!",1392940800,,567,4.895833333333333

5928278,5,B00ENFS0FK,I rated it as a five although we haven't gotten a chance to open and watch it. Now the other one touch by an angel holiday one we attempted to watch it and to our disappointment it was scratched and defective. I sent it back 3 or 4 weeks ago and still have NOT gotten credit nor postage and handling fees that I incurred. Also on the Spurs glasses I had to send them back like over 2 months ago and I had to send them an e-mail that the peeling of the letters peeled the first hour and it was missing a letter. They e-mailed me back and said they thought they already did and it looks like they're still sitting on my postage and handling that it cost me. Both were bug time inconviences.,1390867200,,688,4.0661764705882355
5928279,4,B00ENFS0FK,"I have the entire series and love all of them. Seasons 7 & 8 were so powerful that I couldn't watch just one episode at a time. However, the writing and production of this last season just can't match the previous two seasons. I find it much more difficult to get caught up in the stories. I guess I was expecting the final season to be the best. It just isn't. However it's still wonderful and I highly recommend it.",1390867200,,417,4.225

5928293,5,B00ENFS0FK,"At long last we are able to complete our collections of this wonderfully inspirational series. The episodes encompassing the series finale are worth the price of the DVD on their own. We can only hope there will be a series continuation in the form of 2-hour TV movies, to let us know what the angels are up to now. What work did Tess go into? How is Monica developing as a supervisor? Do Tess and Monica ever work together again?",1386288000,3,430,4.3875

8606973,4,B00ENFS0FK,"The 9th and final season repeats the trials of everyday life, including troubled parent/grown-child relationship; suicidal intent and crowd's reaction to it; Alzheimers (2 separate episodes); an invention that was destroyed; violent video games; etc., but as  always there is the message of forgiveness, encouragement, restoration, hope, and of course God's Love.  The two-part finale revisits Monica's actions of prior seasons as she is evaluated for a promotion to case worker.  Her last assignment is to a town where a terrible tragedy has occurred.  There is a surprise ending. Former characters included were Joey and Wayne (Paul Wittenburg and Randy Travis), Sophie (Marian Ross); also Patty Duke and Patrick Duffy star.  Other actors during the last season were Wynona Judd, William Moses, Paul Winfield, to name a few. Thus was the end of this long, popular, and delightful TV series..",1517788800,,893,5.35

8606978,5,B00ENFS0FK,"Touched by an angel has always been one of my favorite sitcoms. It's too bad we don't have many shows like this today. The show deals with family, friends and relationships, suitable for all ages to learn and grow from. This final season is, in my opinion, better than the rest, I think because it focused on topics that we see more of in the world today. This final season also brings back characters from previous seasons, so it wrapped up the seasons in many ways. The final three episodes really wrapped up the series with claiming your faith and not being afraid to express your beliefs. The final two episodes deal with evil, the devil and Jesus Christ in the midst of it all. I would highly recommend this series to anyone wanting wholesome family entertainment. And although it is a show dealing with angels, it doesn't shove religion down your throat, but subtly allows you to accept the message in your own way.",1509408000,,921,4.587878787878788
