5769393,4,B00D2UMI7I,"An unexpected spin-off from the 'Family' skits on ""The Carol Burnett Show"", MAMA'S FAMILY reunited audiences with Vicki Lawrence's sharp-tongued Thelma Harper and introduced her extended brood of wacky family members. As the show opens, Mama isn't too pleased about the arrival of her son Vint (Ken Berry) and his two teenaged kids Buzz and Sonja (Eric Brown and Karin Argoud), who've decided to stay indefinitely following Vint's wife's departure to become a Las Vegas showgirl...er, cocktail waitress. Vint later hooks up with Thelma's floozy neighbour Naomi (Dorothy Lyman). Also living in the house is Thelma's spinster sister Fran (Rue McClanahan); frequent visitors include Thelma's squabbling daughters Ellen (Betty White) and Eunice (Carol Burnett).

MAMA'S FAMILY originally debuted on NBC in early 1983. It was cancelled in 1985 but brought back in first-run syndication the following year; finally wrapping in 1990. ""Golden Girls"" fans will get a kick out of seeing Betty and Rue together here; Carol Burnett's guest appearances in several of the better episodes (including the two-part ""Wedding"" and ""Cellmates"", arguably the best episode in the first year) are to be savoured.

This ""Best Of Season 1"" collection includes the following episodes:

""Vint and the Kids Move In"" - Vint's chinchilla business has gone belly-up, leaving him and the kids homeless... but Thelma had promised the spare room for Fran to use as a writing studio...

""The Wedding"" (Parts 1 & 2) - The day has arrived. Vint and Buzz head off for the buck's party, leaving the girls at home to amuse themselves. Cheap wine from Food Circus soon livens up the proceedings but Ellen still has a secret involving her husband's secretary. Eunice wants to sing ""Oh Promise Me"" at the ceremony, but not even a tray of chilli dogs will sway Thelma.

""Cellmates"" - Ed (Harvey Korman) and Thelma surprise Eunice with a birthday celebration at the Bigger Jigger... which soon dissolves into a fiasco when Eunice uncovers the reason why a childhood boyfriend left and never called on her again.

""Family Feud"" - Vint arranges for the Harper clan to appear on ""Family Feud""... will it all end in tears?

""Positive Thinking"" - A new Eunice? That seems to be the case when she starts a regime of positive thinking cassettes, and lands a small role at the Pepper Pot Playhouse. Guest stars Gloria DeHaven.

""Mama's Boyfriend"" - Thelma has a date... The Harper clan don't know what to make of this unusual occurrence.",1378425600,12,2484,5.041463414634146

8588761,3,B00D2UMI7I,I wish it was just the show without the singing. You have to watch forever and listen to a bunch of quest sing or be interviewed before the show. The show it's self is good. Sometimes too silly but I would recommend it a lot more if it just had the skits on it only,1528416000,,265,3.8363636363636364

8588766,5,B00D2UMI7I,"""Mama's Family"" is still one of favorite sitcoms of all time. I remember watching the sketches of ""The Family"" from the Carol Burnett Show. I couldn't have been happier when they developed a sitcom for NBC. The sitcom ended after two seasons with only 35 episodes. ""Mama's Family"" later turned up more successful in syndication.

This DVD contains seven of the thirteen episodes from the first season. Future Golden GIrls stars, Rue McClanahan and Betty White played Aunt Frances Crowley and Ellen Harper Jackson along with the amazing Vicki Lawrence as the family matriarch Thelma Crowley Harper. Ken Berry and ""All My Children's"" Dorothy Lyman played son, Vinton and his second wife, Naomi. There are occasional appearances by Harvey Korman as son-in-law Ed Higgins and also as Alistair Quince (spoof to ""Masterpiece Theatre""). Carol Burnett reprised her role as Eunice Harper Higgins in a few episodes.

I loved watching this series on DVD with the Alistair Quince introductions and the different opening and closing credits. I haven't seen these episodes since they ran first on network television. I am grateful that Vicki Lawrence introduced every favorite episode and the episodes are more intact with more time and scenes than before. Syndication edited many memorable scenes. This DVD shows the episodes intact.

The seven episodes include the first pilot with Vint and the kids moving in with Mama Harper; two part Wedding episode; ""Cellmates"" with guest star Yvonne Wilder (West Side Story); ""Family Feud"" with Richard Dawson; ""Positive Thinking"" with Gloria DeHaven; and ""Mama's Boyfriend"" with guest star, William Windom.",1481673600,,1634,5.301158301158301
