7990983,5,B00009KTW2,"From the moment you first hear, or rather read, ""It has been 50 years that you finally re-appear"" or ""Arresy her"", you know you're in for a classic.
Evil cat is a tribute to the legendary Master Cheung, whose family has been fighting Evil Cat for the last 400 years. Only by ending Evil Cat's ninth life can he hope to finally save humanity- and end the 50 year cycle of violence.
-See amazing action such as an investigation concluded entirely by walking in one direction and then the opposite. The power of Cheung!
-See the horror of grown men posessed by Evil Cats who live a depraved life of sneaking around taxi cab drivers' backyards with a fish in their mouth. ""Mom, he is an evil."" Boy howdy.
Cheung finally begins to put the pieces together when he notices that his mom is bringing an uncooked fish to Mr. Fan. ""The jig is up!"" (tm). At last, after some light stretching, he teams up with Mr. Cheng- the taxi driver- to fight the evil Mr. Fan. Er, Evil Cat.
How will it end? You'll have to buy ""Evil Cat"" to see for yourself!",1086220800,12,1034,4.335051546391752
